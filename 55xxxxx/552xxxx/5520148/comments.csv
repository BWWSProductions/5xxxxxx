[V],ParrowJack,2010-04-29T21:19Z,Neither of the comics you have mention are scanned.  Once they are scanned they will be included in a pack.

[V],ParrowJack,2010-05-02T03:12Z,"Salem's Daughter 04 opens without any errors on my computer.  If you're still seeding or opened the file as soon as it finished downloading you could encounter problems.  

I would recommend re-downloading it or waiting until you have finished seeding and try opening the file again."
