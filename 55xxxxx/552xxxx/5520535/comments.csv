,shreddir,2010-05-03T07:42Z,"I have a really crappy out of date PC with a weak Pentium CPU that normally would not be able to playback 1080i in software.  However since these recordings are the original broadcast .ts video, my HD tv tuner card can play them just as if I were watching the original broadcast with hardly any CPU load.  --Thanks"
