â€œPapua New Guineaâ€ is a 1991 song by the electronic music group Future Sound of London. It was the groupâ€™s debut single and later appeared on their full-length album Accelerator it reached #22 on the UK singles chart. The track has been remixed and released many times since its original release, both legitimately and in bootleg format on CD, Vinyl and Cassette.

The song became a popular rave and club track almost immediately upon its release. The original mix notably samples the bassline from Meat Beat Manifestoâ€™s proto-jungle track â€œRadio Babylonâ€, vocal samples of Lisa Gerrardâ€™s singing lifted from the Dead Can Dance song â€œDawn Of The Iconoclastâ€, from their 1987 album Within the Realm of a Dying Sun and â€œShelter Meâ€ by Circuit. â€œPapua New Guineaâ€ was perhaps FSOLâ€™s most club-oriented track; most of the remixes on the single are very dancefloor-friendly. After Acceleratorâ€™s release, however, they moved in increasingly ambient and experimental directions.
