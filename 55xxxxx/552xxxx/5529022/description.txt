Paul Orta born 1957 in Port Arthur, Texas (hometown of Janice Joplin) was first influenced by Louis Armstrong at the age of 7. After 9 years of playing the coronet in the school band, Paul Orta quit because the band never played blues or Jazz. Within a half a year he picked up the Harmonica and in three months, he was in his first professional band (The Bayou Boogie Band) when he was 16. They played in Golden Triangle (southeast Texas) and Louisiana for three years. In 1979 Paul Orta moved to Austin, Texas and he won Kerrville Folk Festival in 1980. Later he formed 'The Backdoor Men' with Port Arthur native Bill Jones (guitar) and with help of Eddie Stout (bass) evolved into 'The Kingpins'. Afterwards he entered the 'Antones the University of the Blues'. Playing with blues greats as Jimmy Rogers, Snooky Pryor, Eddie Taylor, Sunnyland Slim, Hubert Sumlin, Luther Tucker, Ted Harvey, Matt 'Guitar' Murphy, Pinetop Perkins, Wayne Benett, Willie 'Big Eyes' Smith, Henry Grey and Robert Lockwood Jr.
