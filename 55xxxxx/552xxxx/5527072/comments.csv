,TheColdTruth,2010-05-07T08:14Z,Is dogmeat telling the truth?  Feedback anyone?
,Unit3727,2010-05-08T04:32Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5508143/Beat_Hazard

After i fresh install that and apply this update, the game runs without problems.

Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit.

No viruses, don't believe anyone that say otherwise. Or ignore me and don't update, either way it doesn't effect me."
,Unit3727,2010-05-09T01:28Z,"Oh and after you update you should download the beat hazard fix so you can save.

This one doesn't fix the saving issue."
,Oscar_nf,2010-05-17T00:18Z,"Yeah, don't download this update, won't work, it will ask for that "".dll"" D0gmeat said about."
,Unit3727,2010-05-28T03:49Z,Don't listen to em. It worked for me so it works for everyone >:O!
,i4ig0,2010-05-28T21:40Z,Works perfectly with the non steam version of the game and the fix. I've got Win Vista 32 bit

,equazcion,2010-07-04T20:52Z,"This worked for me on the cracked non-steam version of the game. Nothing got messed up and it still works fine, doesn't ask for steam files or anything. Win XP. If yours stops working I'd try applying the original crack again after updating."
,thng1503,2010-07-18T16:53Z,"Works perfectly with the Beat Hazard update IF you have Steam installed, if not, just grab steam.dll from here: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?steam and stuff it in the BH folder."
