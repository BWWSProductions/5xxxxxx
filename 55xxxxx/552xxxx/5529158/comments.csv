why spoil an already great release with bs?

,43wg3hyw435yh,2010-05-06T20:51Z,People deserve to know where to find the original untouched release and not this repacked crap. Why would you even repack something anyway?
,Matagi,2010-05-08T19:06Z,I apologize to 43wg3hyw435yh if he in some way was offended. My previous post was meant for michelinman - he's the one uploading bs.
