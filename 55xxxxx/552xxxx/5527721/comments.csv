,chikasu,2010-05-02T20:03Z,somebody please tell me if this is legit. I'm so tired of downloading fakes.
,MaRINoL69,2010-05-02T20:07Z,It's legit.  Compressed version of the torrent I threw up here yesterday.  Both torrents were taken from Demonoid.
,chikasu,2010-05-02T20:22Z,"this is legit. Its a bit small, but the only good one ive gotten so far. Thanks!"
,rshkhsee,2010-05-02T20:39Z,"Yeah this is a good rip, no bullshit. I flipped through a few scenes to see first and quality is good. Thanks for the trouble! I was waiting for this one....now waiting for english subs for Robo Geisha..."
,foooooote,2010-05-02T20:40Z,its real like chikasu said its a little bit small but its watchable
,rshkhsee,2010-05-02T21:27Z,"well no, now i notice, actually i meant the quality for the dvd-r version was good, im not sure about this compressed one..."
,junkman,2010-05-02T21:50Z,"This film is the most badly acted, badly directed, most utterly incompetent peice of trash outside of Ed Wood's z-grade output. Total amateurish inept garbage.

However it is pretty disturbing, only because of the vomit inducing concept of the ""Human centipede"". The concept is so gross that the movie could be regarded as being sicker even than much of the ""torture porn"" of recent years, such as the Saw series and Hostel etc. Even though it is not very gory at all. It's probably not as gross as ""Cannibal Ferox"" or the equaly vile Chinese film ""The Men Behind the Sun"" detailing Japanese atrocities during WWII. (worth a look if extreme nastyness is your bag.)

Worth watching once just because of the gross-out concept, but you'll never want to see it again as it is so third rate and badly made."
,agent_monkey,2010-05-03T06:18Z,"Yes, legit and decent quality - better than zero-quality of the many fakes...re-read the clearly-posted screen-size description above (?Res: 320x240?) before crying about it. @MaRINoL69  - thanks...1st good up on the webs. @junkman - pull the poop out your pajama-flaps and make + get your own flicks out there before you rant about Mr. Six? wonderful magic being ?inept garbage?...your jealousy is all over your gore-lovin? brow, dawg."
,metallica1977,2010-05-03T12:06Z,Great qaulity upload thanx.The film however is a bag of shit.Terrible writing.unbelievably bad acting.Whoever was responsible for this should have kept the idea in their head.Pretty disturbing idea.
,icecreamshampoo,2010-05-03T17:16Z,This is a legitimate copy.
,junkman,2010-05-03T21:39Z,"@agent_monkey

I don't need to have to produce my own movies to be able to tell when one is badly acted, poorly directed and a third rate production. Get the poop outta my pajama flaps???? What's that in English? I wasn't aware that pajamas had flaps. A pocket maybe, but I wouldn't keep shit in it.

Just to re-iterate - lousy film."
,talassa,2010-05-04T17:42Z,"I saw this movie for the first time in an international film festival. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is well thought out.
Maybe a little to the genre of the movie 'Nekromantik' by Jรถrg Buttgereit, but with a slightly larger budget. =P
Anyway, thanks for the upload!"
,xxLYNCHxx,2010-06-15T10:40Z,"I dunno why, but I was laughing uncontrollably throughout the whole entire film.. "
,nyzdp4,2010-07-07T04:26Z,cuz yer scared
,Wundermutt,2010-08-07T23:05Z,"Yuh gotta wonder how someone came up for the idea of a ""human centipede""........probably a German if I had to guess hahaha."
