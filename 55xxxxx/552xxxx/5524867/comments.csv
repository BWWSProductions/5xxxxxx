,bboy2,2010-05-28T12:01Z,"Awesome, thanks so much for this. Windows live movie maker is so shit. Why Microsoft would replace a good movie maker with a shit one is beyond me. Windows 7 is meant to be an improvement not a downgrade. It's kind of like how they removed the option to install extra languages except in Windows 7 Ultimate. What a joke."

[V],LosslessDude,2010-10-04T16:03Z,"Windows Live Movie Maker 2011 Just came out a few days ago. Although it doesent have the timeline feature the program is MUCH better than what I have posted here.   

It maintains much higher quality levels and you can now choose custom profiles."

,bashful-llama,2010-10-08T05:17Z,wow. its nice that you made this torrent but its not that you made it so average joe's dont know how to use it. and you dont provide good instructions. sorry the whole world isnt computer hackers.
,Samuelthemad,2010-10-11T21:22Z,"When I click the rar file the the install.cmd thing and click ""any key"", it says:

The module ""wmm2ae.dll"" failed to load.

Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path of debug it to check for problems with the binary or dependent .DLL files.

The specified module could not be found.

I have the whole thing in C:/Program Files/

HELP PLEASE!!!!!"
,thedecking,2010-10-24T12:59Z,"Sam:  You've probably done what I did.  Once you've extracted the files you'll have a ""Windows Movie Maker 6.0"" folder.  This is NOT the one to copy.  Open it and you'll have 4 files/folders one of which a ""windows movie maker 6.0"" folder.  This is the folder to move to program files.  The run the install from where ever it is.

Unfortunately my video card isn't up to running the program though :-("

,ibrokamel,2011-05-14T18:30Z,"There is no install icon. When I download the file there's the MOVIEMK.exe file. When I run it, it runs the program right away without any installing. The program won't copy any of my videos or photos. Probably because I didn't install it. But the program itself is working!"
,DukeNukem513,2011-05-14T18:52Z,This version of movie maker still sucks because it doesn't let you capture video from a capture card like movie maker on windows xp does.
,Jesus91,2011-06-05T19:54Z,"It worked for me after I found the right thing to do. 

If you are having problems read through all the comments. Reading throught the comments is the least we can do.

It helped me. My main problem was that I put it in Program Files x86 and not the basic Program Files folder.

Many of you may even not have read the README text.

Thank you for great torrent! 

Now I can do the video editing job for my father witch I get payd for."

thank you :)"
,xambo,2011-07-28T16:50Z,"For people having problems installing. One thing everyone left out and did not say. 

After moving the Movie Maker file folder in the Program files you also have to move the ""install moviemk dlls"" file into the folder too. Then you can run the file as admin. 

This seems basic to many people but some dont know it."

,madgeth,2011-09-22T04:13Z,"Ok, I can consider myself a noob, that's why I am the one who's about to solve your problems! 
(first of all sorry for my english, I am brazilian..)

1- Open the file with winrar
2- extract the file (probably will go to your desk top)
3- In this file will be 4 things...
a) windos m.m.6
b)install...
c)read me
d)unistall...
4) Ok, so you have win7, so click on your start button, than computer, than local disk, that program file.
5)You will move the first thing of your desk top file (win m.m 6) to the program file, and leave the other 3 there...
6) In your desk top file, click in the first one (instal mm...) with the right button and click run as administrator.. Than click ok,ok,ok.,.... 
7) after sucssefully finishing the instalition, go to your program files again, find win mm 6 file, right click 'Create short cut'.
8) A short cut will be created on your desk top, open it, find Windows movie maker aplic. And run it! 

FINISH! 
I hope it will help you! :) "
,Malasky,2011-09-24T22:19Z,"Works like a charm! Thanks guys. Been looking for this for a while. Followed madgeth's instructions. After creating shortcut, deleted the file that was left on the desktop and everything works great. A proper Movie Maker on Win 7! At last!!"
,Kealy5,2011-10-18T11:32Z,"hey guys, I know a lot of people are having problems with the dlls files, and what ended up happening was my AV was blocking them without me knowing. So for those of you having trouble, just check with your antivirus. Other than that, the torrent worked great! +1"

,POISONistheCURE,2011-11-30T13:59Z,Downloading and seeding (: This is the best movie maker. It sucks I have to re download something that should have still been on W7 though.
,POISONistheCURE,2011-11-30T14:14Z,"Nice torrent. Got it up and running and it works perfectly! And to answer every ones questions.
1. It doesnt go in the folder ""programfiles x64(or)x86"" but just ""programfiles"".
2. Even though it may appear to be installed all ready its not... So run the install as Admin and continue by pressing any key. Keep pressing enter as it should say success or w/e.
3. Create a shortcut and put it on desktop or w/e and your good to go! (:
Hope this helped."
,banginmex17cmbab,2011-12-07T21:48Z,will this work on XP?? HELP cant find one for it!! 
,skeelol,2011-12-28T00:38Z,"Works pretty good for me, although it froze up on after going to options and I about shit myself because I was going to lose a movie I spent 2 hours making. 

Windows process details said it was hanging on csrss.exe, and Googling showed problems with Chrome and this Windows process. I closed out all my Chrome windows and it unfroze, praise the lawd...so kill Chrome if MM freezes up on you.

Other problem is if I view the movie at a specific spot and not the beginning, the audio is not in sync. I suspect this could be related to fddshow audio codec and will disable it in options next time I make a movie to see if this solves the problem. 

Anyways, thanks a lot for this, and F U Micro$oft for ruining a great video creation program. Latest Moviemaker is such garbage, the main reason being no timeline. "
