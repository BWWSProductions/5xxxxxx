Nik began his showbusiness career at the young age of 14. By the age of 16 he had joined a 6-piece band and toured Scandinavia.


It was during this time as lead vocalist and lead guitarist that he began to learn about perfecting the use of harmonics, along with the technical side of sound production.

Song writing has always been a passion for Nik and in 1991 he won a major British song competition with a song called 'Could This Be Love'.

Nik has worked for ITVV for a number of years now, producing all the programme music.
