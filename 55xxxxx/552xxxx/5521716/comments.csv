you know , one where you actually can put subtitles under :/
useless to me
thnx anyway"
,m9o,2010-05-13T07:17Z,"@fatie
you can put subtitles on ANY video format. maybe it's time to change the way YOU do it?

I use VLC player. just put the proper *.srt with the same file name of the movie in the folder and the player will load it."
