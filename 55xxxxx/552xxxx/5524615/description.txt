The Far-Out Son of Lung and the Ramblings of a Madman is an EP which was released by Future Sound of London in 1995 to promote the album ISDN. Unlike the bandâ€™s other EPs, there are no variations on a theme here, simply album versions of the tracks segued together in a new way. The only exception is Snake Hips, which appears in an extended version sometimes referred to as â€œSnake Hips (Parts 1 & 2)â€.
