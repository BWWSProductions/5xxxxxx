,Loki240SX,2010-04-30T06:15Z,"There's been a LOT of fake Fringe and The Office lately. Lots of peers at first but then it's just a 10 second scrambled video when I download it. Complete BS

Hopefully this is real, I haven't had problems with eztv yet!"

,Renown(S),2010-04-30T08:40Z,"Great series from a great uploader, thanks."
,psico_kinetic,2010-04-30T08:53Z,"this is the worst Fringe ever!, No more Fringe for me"
,tacojew22,2010-04-30T17:27Z,This was the most retarded episode I have ever seen. It reminds of a Happy Days filler. This must be a joke.
,bobthebuilder1227,2010-04-30T18:18Z,Is anyone else having trouble while viewing this episode... I tried going back and playing previous episodes to see if it was just my computer but they play fine... I tried in WMP and VLC and both keep skipping for like 5 second intervals... I don't see any comments regarding it...
,patientx,2010-04-30T23:02Z,"Aaaarghh!!!!

Looking so forward to my favourite series and they make this stupid musical episode going back to the 30's,40's or 50's whatever !!
This series was so damn good in the sci fi genre...now it's behaving like the X Files,,,,,silly episodes here and there because the writers are running out of good storylines....keep with the script...keep with the story or else we wont see the next season because guys like me will switch off........you guys are ruining a potential hot season........DAMN !!!"
,patientx,2010-04-30T23:04Z,"Use KM Player....I dont have any problems playing the episodes...but this one I have stopped watching because it's bloody aweful>

,elbald90,2010-04-30T23:35Z,i have to agree with the other comments this is awful 
,arildus,2010-05-01T09:49Z,Thanx;)
,Aulpay,2010-05-01T12:18Z,"You are all idiots! They were asked to make an ep like this by the TV network, it wasn't their choice and anyway it will keep you in suspence for the next ep, no one is gunna switch off and they aren't changing the layout its one ep, enjoy it for the bit of craic it is."
,nedthehead,2010-05-01T13:45Z,"I agree it was a really bad episode, like a bad episode of 'Moonlighting' - shame as the series is great usually. Shoot who ever thought it was a good idea to try it."
,read2128,2010-05-01T18:05Z,"Remember, this episode started with Walter smoking a bowl of Brown Betty and progressed to a story Walter was telling the little girl. So basically, this was a fantasy fueled by marijuana and Walters warped imagination. Take it with a grain of salt or smoke a bowl yourself and just enjoy it for what it is. Escapism, not ""high art""."
,breakercase24,2010-05-03T10:07Z,highly recommended!
,psico_kinetic,2010-05-03T22:16Z,"also cellphones on the 40s? WTF, the writers should have more imagination."
,Sattori,2010-05-04T18:48Z,"With all due respect this was a bad episode with the musical theme. I admit that I am not a big fan of this stuff but they could have done it WAY better. It was very uninspired by all standards. For example take the musical episode of Buffy way back then, that was great and full of spirit and even I liked it. But Joss Whedon plays in its own league."
,zhool,2010-05-15T02:02Z,"No matter how big a tolerance for Fringe bs you have, do yrself a favour and skip this episode. Srsly."
,axilleaszz,2010-05-16T14:09Z,thanks
,P2P_DownUnder,2010-05-22T17:00Z,Cheers ;)
,colbyfizzle,2010-05-23T09:40Z,"I also had some problems viewing the episode using VLC...wasn't that big a deal though, it was only a few sections of the episode where the video would freak for about 5-10 sec, audio was fine.  Noticed a LOT of complaints about the episode itself, but I actually thought it was a good episode, simply because it was DIFFERENT!!!  Fringe has tons of filler episodes where the plot line doesn't really go anywhere, and they're just WAY too predictable:  Something creepy happens, the team gets called in, they figure it all out by the end of the episode.  Those episodes bore me to tears.  If I wanted to watch some CSI bullshit, I would.  At least this episode was original, and I actually thought it provided great insight into what Walter is going through and how his brain is interpreting his relationships with the other characters.  Making the story into a musical, and one that takes place in the early 20th century with modern technologies just serves to remind us that it is WALTER'S head we're peaking into.  He wouldnt be a very good mad scientist if he wasnt actually a little nuts.  I thought it was great.  Def worth watching."
