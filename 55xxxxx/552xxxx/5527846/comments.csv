,xylent,2010-06-17T14:15Z,"umm..do you still have to update this in order play?when i try mount the iso, it says ""original cd cant be authenticated""...plz help..thanks"
,alyx930,2010-07-06T06:13Z,"The game won't start without the original CD, the serials don't cut it. There are no cracked files or noCD crack on the ISO's, nor any kind of detailed instructions except: ""simply mount the game, install the game, insert the serials given, and enjoy"". Tnx for the upload anyway."

,Camjam,2011-02-03T14:47Z,When it gets to file #1117 of the download it says there's an error and stops downloading. If I start it back up it downloads everything else but just when that file is about to be fully completed it shuts off. Is it downloaded and it's just a glitch of some sort or what?
,SubzWhoopAssWhillie,2011-03-27T12:32Z,Seed please!
,virusboy,2011-03-28T02:16Z,"The serials should still work, i got this game from the library mind you.  If you have issues with no CD being detected burn it.  as for you Camjam must be you.  "
,xxquietusxx,2011-06-02T21:00Z,IN CAPS TO BE SEEN.  THIS DOES WORK.  DO NOT USE THE CRACKS ON THE DISK IMAGES.  DO NOT USE A NO CD KEY.  THIS WILL FUCK UP THE GAME.  FIRST INSTALL NWN 2 THEN UPDATE.  UPDATING WILL SUCK AND YOU WILL HAVE TO HIT UPDATE A FEW TIMES UNTIL ITS FINISHED; IT WILL SAY WHEN IT CANT FIND SOMETHING.  IF IT TIMES OUT DOWNLOADING JUST HIT UPDATE AGAIN.  THIS TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR.  THEN INSTALL MOTB AND UPDATE; PROCESS WILL BE THE SAME AGAIN.  TO PLAY MOUNT THE MOTB IMAGE.
,hamsterus,2012-03-18T02:08Z,"xxquietusxx is right - if you update the game it will owrk.

But you dont have to update basic version first. install everything then expansion and then click update and wait till it ends - took me 10mins to have it all updated. works fine with no cracks/I used CDkey from the torrent"
,midnight68652,2012-03-29T04:10Z,The iso's are miss named NW2 Game is named NW2Motb while MW2Motb is named NW2.
,RumataDEstor,2012-04-19T19:55Z,thx! all is working properly after update patching. copy/paste serial in setup and then just mount that iso in you virt dvd drive and enjoy))) thx again
