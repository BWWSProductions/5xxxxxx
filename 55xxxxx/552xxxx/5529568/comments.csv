,Godoid,2010-05-03T21:20Z,i didn't see that and i didn't get the 'already uploaded' thingy. But if you want i can delete it. Sorry :) Just thought i'd post it here cos it worked for me and there were people asking me for a workaround for the mac. I don't think they saw your file. Thanks for letting me know though.
,RitchieRich,2010-05-03T21:59Z,"@Godoid
The more info to share the better. Yeah this script works very good that's why I uploaded it. "
,Godoid,2010-05-04T13:14Z,:) Thanks
,76dragon,2010-05-05T16:34Z,"For all of you that have problems with installation
I thought it would be useful to post step by step installation instructions. I already posted them at the ""Adobe CS5 Master Collection [MAC]"" torrent on The Pirate Bay. In particular read the ""REMOVE....."" section of this post if you have problems with your Adobe installations. With respect to where to go for your installation packages: I prefer to get them from the torrents. They are the same as what you download from the Adobe website. However, there has been some discussion on Demonoid about Adobe matching registration info with your IP address when you download the package. I'm not sure about the validity of this claim but I prefer to play safe and get the packages via torrents.

If you follow the steps below you will not have to run the ""Block Activation"" script included in this torrent. Basically the ""Terminal"", ""TextEdit"" and ""Finalize Adobe CS5 Installation"" steps below guide you manually through the automated ""Block Activation"" script. Please install CS5 in the way that you prefer.

You may notice below that I recommend to ""turn off Airport"" during installation and to run ""sudo dscacheutil -flushcache"" after updating the /etc/hosts file. I'm not sure if these steps are necessary but I recommend to do so anyway. Also notice the link to Acrobat 9 Pro at the bottom of the post:

REMOVE OLD ADOBE INSTALLATIONS (IF APPLICABLE) BEFORE INSTALLING ADOBE CS5
Remove the following Adobe applications, folders and files before installing the Adobe CS5 Master Collection (but check notes below this list first):
/Applications/Adobe... (everything with Adobe)
/Library/Application Support/Adobe
/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher
/Library/Preferences/com.adobe... (everything with com.adobe)
/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Acrobat
~/Library/Preferences/Acrobat
~/Library/Preferences/Acrobat Distiller Prefs
~/Library/Preferences/Adobe... (everything with Adobe)
~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe... (everything with com.adobe)

A few notes:
- / is the system root folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the hard drive icon at devices)
- ~ is the User folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the home icon at places)
- I strongly recommend to delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" and ""/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher"" folders if you have old Adobe applications installed. Keeping an old version of this folder can cause a variety of licensing errors. It will automatically be regenerated with the CS5 installation.
- Obviously, if you're attached to your old Adobe application preferences, don't delete the preferences files in the system and User libraries. There is no harm in doing so, they'll be automatically regenerated but by deleting them you will loose your user preferences. I prefer to start with a clean system but that may not be the case for everybody.

INSTALLATION OF ADOBE CS5
Disconnect from network/internet (Turn AirPort Off). Double click ""CS5_Master_Collection.dmg"" to install the Adobe CS5 Master Collection. Whilst installing CS5, ensure that you choose ""Install this product as a trial"" and DO NOT enter any serials. If you've already installed CS5 applications using a serial, load any of the installed CS5 applications and select Help > Deactivate. Quit all of the installed CS5 applications.

TERMINAL
Launch a Terminal window (in /Applications/Utilities) and copy and paste:
sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts

Hit return and type your admin password.
The ""hosts"" file should automatically open in TextEdit.

TEXTEDIT
If the following lines are already part of the ""hosts"" file close it and continue with the ""Finish"" section. If not hit return (in the opened ""hosts"" file) and copy and paste following lines:
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com"

,76dragon,2010-05-14T19:29Z,"@Sh  You don't need to be a member and you don't have to log in to Demonoid to download the Acrobat pro 9 torrent. Besides, there are many alternative torrent sites (e.g. btjunkie). Try to Google ""adobe 9 pro mac torrent"" and the top link is actually from The Piratebay.

After installing Acrobat 9 run Adobe Acrobat > Help > Check for Updates? multiple times until Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro is up to date (version 9.3.2 at the date of this post). "

,PirateKid77,2010-05-24T01:39Z,"I'm having problems with my CS4. I've installed  everything by the instructions and everything has been fine  when i run these programs:
Adobe After Effects CS5
Adobe Contribute CS5 
Adobe Encore CS5

I'm asked to install additional codecs, file formats or effects but the install never completes. Anyone have any ideas?"

,garmin123,2010-05-27T19:53Z,"@Godoid, Ive followed all the instructions and everything CS5 wise works well - thanks :-)
However Im now faced with a fairly big problem if I can't also have CS4 installed. I need to be able to save down to InDesign CS3. This is only possible from CS4. So can I reinstall CS4 or is that gonna mess up the script?
Also, I use Mobile Me's Back to Mac to connect to my home laptop from work. Since installing I can't connect. Could the block-script also block this - my mac will sync all my other data (ical, mail etc) but just Back to Mac isnt working. Cheers in advance!"
