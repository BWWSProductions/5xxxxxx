HBO Mini series THE PACIFIC - Part IV


The Pacific was produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman in association with HBO Films, Playtone, Dreamworks, and Seven Network. Seven invested in the project for the right to broadcast it in Australia. Nine Network has previously broadcast the HBO productions of The Sopranos and Band of Brothers. Nine had a broadcast deal with HBO's parent Warner Bros., but then HBO started to distribute its own productions separately.

In April 2007, the producers set up a production office in Melbourne and began casting.

Filming of the series in Australia, started Aug. 10, 2007,[8] and finished in late May 2008.

The score was written by Hans Zimmer, Geoff Zanelli and Blake Neely and was released on March 9th. The series premiered on March 14, 2010, on HBO.
