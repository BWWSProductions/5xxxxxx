No review was available for this double album so i made up my own with info about various artists featured on the album.


In the early 1990s, Imbruglia was known to audiences as Beth Brennan Willis in the popular Australian soap Neighbours. 
Three years after leaving the program, Imbruglia launched a singing career with the international hit, Torn. 
The subsequent debut album Left of the Middle (1997) sold over 6 million copies worldwide.

Kim Carnes (born July 20, 1945, Hollywood, California) is an American singer-songwriter.She is a two-time Grammy Award winner, noted for her distinctive, raspy vocal style; like that of Bonnie Tyler, her voice has often been compared favorably to that of Rod Stewart, and indeed, she and Tina Turner once toured with him during the period when Turner was reviving her own career.In 1981, Carnes recorded the Jackie DeShannon and Donna Weiss song Bette Davis Eyes, as the
first single released from the album Mistaken Identity, it spent nine weeks at number one on the US singles charts and became a worldwide hit.
