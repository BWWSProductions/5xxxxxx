,hwb3517,2010-05-01T19:20Z,thx but am wunder if series?
,SchoolyardKiller,2010-05-01T23:11Z,"^ If you're wondering if it's a series (and I didn't misunderstand), the answer is no. It's just a movie made for TV, no other parts following it."
,bppharv,2010-05-06T18:29Z,"Thanks for the upload, but this isn't HDTV. It's 688x288TV. Just sayin. Nevertheless, I appreciate it :)."
,jinXc,2010-05-18T18:44Z,"BONE means it was recorded from an HDTV broadcast (just like the TV torrents you see here that say HDTV) but it is not in an HD resolution, a torrent will say 720P or 1080P (I've even seen 576P and 480P) in the title generally if it's in HD"
,Don_16G2,2010-05-30T12:56Z,why does it say it's only 97 min when on imdb it says 134(ish) min ????
,ZoOMBeE,2011-06-04T01:50Z,"@jinXc - What good is to declare it was ripped from HDTV if it's not 720p?? The name of the release is in did deceiving and should have been TVRip.
hanks anyway @.BONE."
