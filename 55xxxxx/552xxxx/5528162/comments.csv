Thanks for Battleship Potemkin and The Fall.Really appreciate your work.

P.S Please try to keep audio bitrate at atleast 192Kbps VAR even for foreign/silent movies. Just a suuggestion."

Because it's corrupted.. I had to convert it to XviD just to get it to play properly. =("
[V],room101bellboy,2010-05-06T15:49Z,"Joe, I don't know what you are up to since the file is flawless. You made me see the movie again all the way through and it's a long movie! 

Have you got CoreAVC and Haali Media Splitter installed? --they're recommended for H264 playback. 

And also, you make no sense when you write ""Because it's corrupted.. I had to convert it to XviD just to get it to play properly."" 

1. If the file was really corrupted, the corruption would remain in your XviD re-encode or the re-encoding would simply stop before completion.   

2. Around 1000 downloads so far and no one  has complained about file corruption. Hint... hint.

3. The bad ratings I get on all my TPB torrents is due to Child Models / Child Porn uploaders abusing the system. We, Mods and bad torrents reporters, are suffering from this abuse. It's been discussed on the forum many times.

You could have PM'd me on the forum instead of posting such a misleading comment. :/

Yes, I have CoreAVC installed and Haali Media Splitter is included in the CCCP that I also have installed.. this H.264 isn't the first (or the last) video I've watched, just the first one that wouldn't play in Quicktime Pro (gave an error code) and played to about 1/2 way through in VLC then video froze and audio continued playing. This is where the word ""Corrupted"" stems from.  =("

The problem is with VLC not the movie.
VLC uses it's own codecs. The movie was corrupted when I played it with VLC, but ran like a charm when using MPC. 

Thanks Bellboy, always the best!"
