Cant get keygen to work, Can hear the music but nothing else works... I'm on Windows 7 Ultimate.

hmm, I tested it on windows xp sp3. but I have a 2nd rig with windows 7 home Premium 64bit ill have to test on. ty for the report.

try right click, go to properties &  check unblock from another pc? i noticed 7 tends to block many apps from another pc. aside from that contact me at GhostWarriorTheGeek  on you||tube & i can give you a bunch of keys  to try if needed."
