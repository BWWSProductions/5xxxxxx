Catch all the doom and gloom from Clif and George as they read the future with their Web Bot Project. They send little virtual spiders or bots out to search the web's blogs and forums for millions of postings in all the primary languages. All these postings are then distilled down into how the posters unconsciously feel about the future.

The theory is that if enough posters feel a certain way about a future event, it will happen that way. The problem is that strong negative feelings in people's postings are much louder than positive feelings. This results in much of the data having a negative slant.

According to the bots, we're in for a rough ride this year, starting with the economy in early July, and with World War 3 on schedule to start in early November.
