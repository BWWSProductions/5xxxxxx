Depressive/Atmospheric Black Metal from the Netherlands.

Beyond Light was formed in the middle of 2007 by Belfalas. Influenced by depressive black metal bands of that time, the Demo 2007 with raw quality was released soon after. In December 2008 the second demo-EP was released called The Blessing Of A Dead Sun.

In 2009 the third demo AfterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Before was released. Belfalas also made a re-arrangement of The Blessing Of A Dead Sun that year, and re-recorded it including new elements as The Scars Of Daylight.
