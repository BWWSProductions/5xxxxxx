SwordBrethren & William Finck interview Kevin MacDonald on The Culture of Critique


Cultural Marxism and the Frankfurt School Part 3 with Kevin MacDonald

The Jewish role in subverting the USA and the rest of the world for that matter...

Episode Notes: "Kevin MacDonald will be on with Bill Finck and SwordBrethren to discuss Cultural Marxism and one of his (Kevin MacDonald) books, The Culture of Critique."


An excellent discussion that covers a wide array of topics.

Each one of the topics deserves at least an episode dedicated entirely to it.


*** A must-listen.
