                  The Autobiography of Frank Lampard

It's a long walk. Those who have done it say it can be a harrowing experience just making your way to the penalty spot in a shootout situation. I know how tortuous it is. The second you break from the arms of your team-mates and take the first step you are very much alone, wondering where the journey will end.
For a footballer, there can be few trips in life as significant as the 60 metre path towards a moment that will remain with you as long as you live - like the walk down the aisle to be married or a sombre march to say a final goodbye to a loved one who has died. In those circumstances, though, at least you know what to expect.
The long walk to take a penalty invokes a similar intensity of emotion but without a pre-determined outcome. It's the world cup quarter-final and the hopes of your family, friends, and team-mates, never mind those of a nation, weigh on your shoulders as you propel yourself towards destiny.
