This is an update to the landmark guide to foodborne diseases and how to prevent them.It is estimated that more than 100 million foodrelated illnesses are recorded in the United States alone each year, from undercooked fastfood hamburgers to chicken contaminated with salmonella. Today, there are added worries due to increased potential for food contamination on the global market, the prospect of terrorism against the food supply, and the lack of adequate regulation of food products and handling. Food safety has become a daily concern. Written by renowned food expert Morton Satin, "Food Alert!, Second Edition" provides an up-to-date and comprehensive examination of the causes, dangers, and prevention of foodborne diseases.New and updated topics include: the deficiencies of modern food handling that allow germs and bacteria to thrive; protection and prevention from exposure to foodborne illnesses; immediate steps one should take if food poisoning strikes; the 20 most common causes of foodborne illnesses in the kitchen; increasingly complex food labeling; the growing threat of bioterrorism; new government, industry, and consumer advocacy initiatives; up-to-date information on inadequate reporting of foodborne disease incidents; and, more.
