In the year 2691, San Dimas, California. It is a very peaceful, tranquil community. Unfortunately, not everybody was happy about it. A man named Chuck De Nomolos is planning to change history and create his own society torn up by war and violence. He is doing so by creating cybernetic duplicates of Bill and Ted and send them back into 1991, where the real Bill and Ted are preparing for a concert contest called the "Battle of the Bands". What the robots have to do is kill the real Bill and Ted, take their places and give out a different speech for De Nomolos. However, they do succeed in killing Bill and Ted and sent them to the afterlife, Bill and Ted had defeated the grim reaper "Death" and were given a chance to be alive again. But, they must now stop their robotic doppelgangers and save not only their girlfriends Joanna and Elizabeth, but the future. Written by John Wiggins
