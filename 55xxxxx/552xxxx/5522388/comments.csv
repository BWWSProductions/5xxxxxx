Works fine until about 58:15, then the video freezes while the audio continues normally, and the timecode slows down to about 1 second every 10 actual seconds.  Tried ripping it with Handbrake, and it screws up in the same spot, although the result is slightly different.  The ripped video plays a different scene in slow motion while the audio continues normally, completely out of sync with the scene that's on the screen.  No way to fix this, it was probably ripped from the original DVD with a DVD ripper that screwed it up.  Too bad, the quality was fine and it took a long time to download."
