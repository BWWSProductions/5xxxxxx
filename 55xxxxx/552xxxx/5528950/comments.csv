,honeybunny28,2010-05-03T07:40Z,it is not fake.
,spiderr,2010-05-03T07:53Z,"lol, fake or not, there are more seeds/peers on the VIP TvTeam torrent."
,rrmerlin51D,2010-05-03T07:54Z,YES IT IS A FAKE!!!
,honeybunny28,2010-05-03T08:15Z,has any of you actually downloaded this before commenting it is fake?
,rrmerlin51D,2010-05-03T08:21Z,Crank your 2 brain cells.  Look at the anon.  WMV.  Already a legit one by same name.  This is FAKE!
,honeybunny28,2010-05-03T08:27Z,I posted this and it is not fake. But it's funny to see how everyone creates such a fuss :))
,ATLdev,2010-05-03T08:29Z,this guy ALWAYS posts a fake. sometimes before the show even airs. magic! and the sad thing is some people dl it anyway
,honeybunny28,2010-05-03T08:41Z,"LOL, anyone can upload a torrent as Anonymous. There is not ""a guy"" :))"
,rrmerlin51D,2010-05-03T08:53Z,Don't download as anon. and play games by giving a name later.  Don't mess with people.  It is still FAKE as some sort of game.  Get your jollies by diddling yourself.

,Ezel,2010-05-04T12:17Z,"I downloaded it. It is NOT a fake! It works like a charm in my VLC and, even though I haven't looked it through properly yet, skimming through it I don't recognize the scenes so it really is the new episode 8. Big ups to honeybunny28. Thanks!"
,asb123,2010-05-05T02:32Z,This is no fake. I have downloaded a lot of the episodes from him.
