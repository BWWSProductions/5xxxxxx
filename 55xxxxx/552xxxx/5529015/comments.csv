Personally I have about ALL of Johnny Cash CDs, ao I can compare.  For the purest that prefer all original hits then this is not the torrent for you. However the versions on this set are all very high quality, much better quality than the older versions from the 1950s. There are also a couple original hit versions on this set as well, while 90% of the songs are his remixes over a decade after most of these songs became Country Music Hits. All in all, I would say it is a MUST HAVE for die hard Johnny Cash fans, as the audio quality is very very good AND it contains some songs that are difficult to find on his other CDs."
