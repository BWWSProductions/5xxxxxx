,scandanathian,2010-06-13T08:40Z,"I created an iso image from the files and used VLC to watch the movie. It worked out great for me. I did not want any subtitles to show except the English subtitles when Navi was being spoken, and I got exactly what I wanted.

Good audio & video quality.
ALL spoken English (except for the Navi, of course)!
Thnx Beebe85! "
