If you like what you hear from this torrent release, the bandcamp copy is the same release.  $1.00 is all it costs to keep a starving beatmaker from starving to death. $1.00, that's not too much is it?  That's 4 cents a track. Thanks for considering helping me.  Thanks more, if you actually buy it though!"
