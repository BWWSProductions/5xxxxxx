     It is the mid-1960s. The Cold War is          
       raging. The world is still reeling from        
       the assassination of JFK - but has yet to      
       lose his kid brother Bobby. In the midst       
       of all this, a reluctant hero by the name      
       of Lucien Rivard becomes enmeshed in a         
       web of global political intrigue and           
       corruption. The United States, Russia and      
       France are embroiled in a strategic            
       battle over Third World natural                
       resources. To keep the upper hand, each        
       of their secret services has joined            
      forces with various organized crime            
     factions.
