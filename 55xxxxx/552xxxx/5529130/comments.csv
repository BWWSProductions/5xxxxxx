,johnnybop8,2010-05-03T18:48Z,"Hi Mr. RiddlerA, thanks a lot for your great releases, I know you got a lot of requests, but is there any chance you could please upload ""Down in the valley""? I can't even find decent Q rips nor english subs for that and it's weird 'cause Ed Norton & Evan Rachel Wood starred on it: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398027/ greetings!"
