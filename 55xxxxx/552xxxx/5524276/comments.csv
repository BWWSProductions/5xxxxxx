,lennysglue,2010-05-02T19:53Z,"There we go, nice one! I'll seed this for a while."

,zadmiral2,2010-05-03T04:42Z,nevermind. thanks for the post
,perenne,2010-05-03T14:16Z,"My PT 8.0.3 M-Powered wonÂ´t run TG Mastering Pack plugins, the others run fine. Anybody with the same problem? solutions?
Thanks a lot for your post."
,Madmax93,2010-06-08T19:20Z,How exactly do I install this? Is there any cracks etc. that need to be done? I'm just asking before I try anything because there's nothing in the description. Thanks for the upload though!
,landros,2010-06-12T10:34Z,"I install, replace by cracked plugins but pt stil asks for authorisation?!? I'm on PTHD 8.0.1 w/ ppc mac"
,KorparalAnal,2010-11-13T20:17Z,does this work with logic?
,Endtrend,2010-12-13T06:32Z,"Yes, it works with Logic. Read the title: AU = Audio Units; Logic Plug ins. Do a little research, damn. "
,dingoproductions,2010-12-30T01:38Z,"I have the Leftnut and Rightnut extracted but there is 6 RAR files, i have no idea what to do..

..if anyone can help me with some steps please email me @ dingoproductions@yahoo.com"
,guitargamer,2011-01-05T12:17Z,"With this vst pack i just will trow out t-racks and waves--this is just the best ever!! thanks man this is my first torrent download i hope not to go to jail and i hope even more that this works, guys feel free to check my original music channel at youtube by the name of  bbuteo"
,jaeden77,2011-02-16T10:27Z,"Thanks for the upload!
But can anyone tell me where I copy the cracks to on a mac please? I really cant seem to find where these plugins get installed

Switched to a mac just a couple months ago and kinda still a mac noob :)"
,-human,2011-03-09T21:18Z,"if you didn't know how to play the guitar... but you really wanted to learn... i wouldn't give you a guitar... and then give you shit for not knowing what a Dm7 chord was... or what a simple pentatonic minor scale is...  
so... with that in mind, this:  ""Just install the developer's package first, and replace the plugins with the cracked plugins in the xvx folder. We trust that you all know where these go ;)"", is insufficient information.  I'm really looking forward to these plugins.  I really appreciate the work thats been done to get them into my greasy little hands.  You may presume I'm an idiot but don't lord what you know over the rest of us with a pixelated wink and a smile.  Running the install package doesn't seem to create an App Support file like all my other plugins have, nor does placing the AU components into the Library/ Components (with ALL the other plugins i've installed successfully) seem to have an effect... what am i missing?  Please and Thanks"
,-human,2011-03-14T13:35Z,"ok... sorry for being so sassy in my previous comment.  Anyways... I got a Fidelia (a very nice audio player) that can chain up to three effects together for enhancing playback of the library.  These abbey road effects work in Fidelia but not in Garageband so it may be that for whatever reason, I've correctly installed the AU's but they just aren't compatible with Garageband.  Can anyone corroborate this?"
,-human,2011-03-15T13:37Z,"so i found another thread about some other plugin having been installed but not showing up in the list of available AU effects in GarageBand.  The suggested solution was to delete the cache item:  library/ audio/ cache/ (""...audiounit..."").  I couldn't find it.  Then I looked for it starting from my ""user name"" instead of from the ""HD"" in Finder.  Found it.  I don't know why the two starting points (HD/ ""username"") look identical but do not have identical data however, they definitely do.  Deleting the cache allowed Garageband to scan for new AU's when I then went to open a project... it tells you new AU's are detected and that it will take a moment to recognize them...  IT WORKED!!!  I have an amazing new set of plugins now available to the most seamlessly  integrated DAW around.  If the Beatles did it with these effects and analogue tape, then what more do you REALLY need?  ;)"

,-human,2011-03-15T13:47Z,"i typed an inaccurate directory for the cache item in question at first... ""username""/library/cache/com.apple.audiounits.cache... thats the one.  "
,sylvain24,2011-03-29T01:43Z,"hello i agree with others ,i have installed many cracked vst b4 and i can't see where to install the cracks here , i dont mind to put them in my plugins folder ,but im  pretty sure b4 to try that 's not gonna be the right manipulation,so if someone could stop pretending to think is a genius little geek of 13yo dropping salivae on baywatch ,and give an bright explanations ,that will be nice of him"
,sylvain24,2011-03-29T01:53Z,"ok all my excuses ,it's going to the plugins folder .....   :-/"
,Endtrend,2011-06-07T20:02Z,"So what's the deal with the Keygen.exe file? I'm assuming you have to get on a PC to get a auth code...? The mastering plug-ins are working in Pro Tools, but the other ones are, at least in Logic 8...weird. "
,shabbamanuk,2011-12-10T19:52Z,"Right listen..if people here are having issues with uploads,why dont you pastey cunts help out?...There is no discription,and i myself who have 2grammeys as an engineer have had issues with this torrent on a mac...where ever i put the cracked plugs,it dont work,it just repeats the ilok question.So,uploader,and downloader alike.if youv had success here,share it."
,zo0o,2012-02-05T17:14Z,"Again thanks so much to the XVX team. This goes to Logic users which already managed to install everything in order (which means swapping the components in the plug-in folder as well). I seem to have a problem with the Brilliance Pack.
Inside the folder there's a folder (I think it is for Pro Tools users) and then a file that says AU.RTAS.VST   !!!? How u get around this!!? Thanks for your time. Zoo"
,zo0o,2012-02-05T17:51Z,ok. managed to do it with FXpander..dodgy way though I guess..x
