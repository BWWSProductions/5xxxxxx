Screw Houston Start Screaming! plays a raw and energetic mix of hardcore in the veins of Comeback Kid, Gallows, This is Hell en The Bronx.
In the summer of 2009 they recorded a 4 track EP themselves. 
These 4 songs were mixed and mastered by Patrick Delabie at Studio 195.
You can listen to our entire EP on myspace or download it here.

With this EP some cool shows followed.
The band played with some cool bands like Otis, Omission, Holding On To Hope (US), Draft (FR), Noyalty, Brackets Closed (aut), Soey (aut), Homer, Ten Threats & Don't Mention The War.
With an avarage of 2/3 shows a month SHSS! is really becoming a band to keep your eyes and ears on.

7 Inch Records already did and asked the band to be part of the 'In Transit' compilation (release date march 2010).
SHSS! will be on this compilation along side great bands such as A Wilhelm Scream, Giving Chase, Atack Vipers! and many more.
Also the band is already writing new stuff and hopefully somewhere in the near future there will be a new release of some sort.
