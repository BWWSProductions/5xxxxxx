
Edge Of Darkness [2010] DvdRip XviD [AR 1.82]

The plot is simple, but the story is interesting. Mel's daughter, home on a visit, is shot and killed. The rest of the plot is Mel, who is a cop, tracking down the killers, and finding out why this happened. It is the intrigue he uncovers that is powerful. The writing is excellent; scenes are suspenseful with an underlying coldness that does not pander to stupid people. The filmmakers clearly have a lot of respect for the audience.
