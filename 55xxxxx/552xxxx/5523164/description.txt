Rambo 1 - First Blood

Plot:  

First Blood (also known as Rambo or Rambo: First Blood outside the United States), is a 1982  action/thriller film directed by Ted Kotcheff. The film stars Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam War veteran, with Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) as his nemesis, and Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) as his former commander and only ally. It was released on October 22, 1982. Based loosely on David Morrell's 1972 novel of the same name, it was the first of the four-film and ongoing Rambo series. Unlike the following sequels which were war adventure films set in foreign countries, First Blood was a post-Vietnam War psychological thriller set in the United States.

Since its release, First Blood has been a critical and commercial success, and has had a lasting influence on the genre. It has also spurred countless parodies. The film is also notable for its psychological portrayal of the after effects of the Vietnam War, particularly the challenges faced by American veterans attempting to re-integrate into society.

In 2008, First Blood was chosen by Empire Magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.

Rambo 2 - First Blood, Part 2

Plot:  

Rambo: First Blood Part II is a 1985  second film in the Rambo series and is an Action/War film starring Sylvester Stallone as Vietnam veteran John Rambo. Picking up where the first film left, this sequel is set in the context of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue; it sees Rambo released from prison by Federal order to document the possible existence of POWs in Vietnam, under the belief that he will find nothing, thus enabling the government to sweep the issue under the rug.

Rambo: First Blood Part II was ghost-directed by George P. Cosmatos (actually directed by Sylvester Stallone), who later 'directed' the movie Cobra with Sylvester Stallone and Brigitte Nielsen. It was later revealed that Stallone had most of the directorial control on Rambo: First Blood Part II.

Rambo: First Blood Part II follows First Blood and was followed by Rambo III in 1988 and Rambo in 2008.

Rambo 4 - Rambo

Plot:  

Rambo (also known as Rambo IV or John Rambo) is a 2008 American Action/War film starring Sylvester Stallone returning and reprising his famous role as legendary Vietnam veteran John Rambo. Stallone also co-wrote and directed the film. It is the fourth installment of the Rambo franchise, twenty years since the last film Rambo III. This film is dedicated to the memory of Richard Crenna, who played Col. Sam Trautman in the first three films; he died in 2003. Unlike the previous sequels, this film attempts to keep the serious tone of the original film.

Rambo holds the record with the most kills out of the entire Rambo series, with 236 kills[2] â€“ Stallone justified this in a press conference by saying the violence in the film was to draw attention to the ongoing problems in Burma. Including the intake of $41,368,619 in DVD sales, the film's total gross revenue is $154,611,774.
