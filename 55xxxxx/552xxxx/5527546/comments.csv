,nicermog,2010-05-02T18:46Z,is there any order to watch ashes to ashe/this one?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-02T19:06Z,"Well, I bring it up today because in recent  discussion here was amplified How good LoM was and How much was better than later US copy/version. In my opinion, UK version is so much better, that comparing UK original with ""faded"" US copy cannot be done without using of improper wording.
Second, last episode of A2A has direct reference to Sam Tyler and hence...
Third - one single episode of BluRay is 3.03 GB (same as this one is 720p) and by that fact alone pretty much over the heads of many people who wants to know who was Sam and how good LoM was.
So, watching LoM after 3 seasons of A2A may be considered as needed information or memorabilia. Hence."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-02T20:42Z,"@dirtysins: I really cannot. Please read torrent description on any [quark] and you'll see (I hope). In short, it goes against my belief.
BTW, 720p as 350MB is fine, perfect file-size for such resolution."
