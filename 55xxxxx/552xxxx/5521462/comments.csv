,Namibio,2010-04-30T22:34Z,"Ok, this movie is blurred like hell. If you don't want to wait, download it (you'll have to wait, anyways).
But, take my advice, wait for a scene release. Or go to your local movie theatre."

Thank you uploader, nice try, but this is unwatchable. There are some scenes where my 5 year old Sony Ericsson D750i mobile phone camera could have done a better job."
