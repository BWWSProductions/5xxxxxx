|  Ember is one of the hottest bands to emerge from the live music capital   |
|  of the world: Austin, Texas. With hook laden, powerful music and an       |
|  incredible stage show, itÃ†s no wonder that Ember has begun to ignite.     |
|  Since their inception, Ember has performed across the US including        |
|  California, New York, Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. They released an       |
|  independent EP Under Pressure in 2006, produced by Sylvia Massy Shivy     |
|  (Deftones, Tool, Red Hot Chili Peppers) at Radiostar studios in Weed,     |
|  California. Shortly after, Ember signed with The Price Agency under the   |
|  direction of J. Price. Following that union, the band started to flash    |
|  all over the radar, playing shows with major mainstream acts such as      |
|  Blue October, Theory of a Deadman, and Black Stone Cherry. Ember quickly  |
|  became one of the top requested bands on internet radio and gained        |
|  endorsements from Rock Revival Jeans, Incredible Ears, Gibson, Mesa       |
|  Boogie, Sabian, and many others. After becoming a member of Armed Forces  |
|  Entertainment, Ember scored the main support slot for multi-platinum      |
|  rock powerhouse Hinder, and was then asked to headline the Fall tour in   |
|  September of 2009.                                                        |
