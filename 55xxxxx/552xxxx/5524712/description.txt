`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - APRIL 2010        `
     ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This month: New Foals, Kate Nash, LCD Soundsystem, Crystal Castles,
Tanlines and more! Actually, a double dose of Tanlines this month (to get
you in the mood for summer, of course). Plus, Simian (pre-"Mobile Disco"),
classic Feist, remixed Emily Haines, Mark Ronson covering Radiohead and
a bunch of other stuff too. Lots of new music this month -- yay!

HAPPY APRIL! And just a heads up: this is going to be one of the last CTC playlists for a while. I'm putting CTC on hiatus after next month, CTC's
second birthday.
