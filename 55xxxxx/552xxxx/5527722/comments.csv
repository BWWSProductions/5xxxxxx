,T-Minus420,2010-05-04T23:36Z,yeah it is a VHS screener that is why everyone is complaining about all the so-called DVDSCR's out there of this movie... i think a lot of people assume all SCR are DVDSCR... you would think... cant complain although i hear this movie is full of a whole bunch of idealistic christian propoganda BULL anyway...

,ZombiePanda,2010-05-07T23:33Z,"Screw it, I can't be bothered to wait for a DVDRip anymore, I'm downloading this, even if it isn't a DVDSCR."
,lambofgod1688,2010-05-13T08:35Z,sometimes i think ppl just love to complain..no it is not a dvdscr..it is a vhsscr..no the quality isn't the best but its far from poor..v-8/10 a-7/10..definitely worth the dl if u don't want to wait..these ppl complaining are probably the same ppl that dl a cam and complain that the quality isn't stupendous lol
