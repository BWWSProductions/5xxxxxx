His pacifist philosophy brought one of the world's great powers to its knees. He proved that violence is not the only road to change.

Mahatma Gandhi's life was a study in contrast and paradox. He saw himself as doing God's work, yet recognized only personal conscience as the highest authority. He was a charismatic leader of millions who confounded intellectuals. This documentary profiles the small man who took a great nation on his shoulders and changed the world. Trace his rise to power and fearless campaign of truth, non-violence and non-cooperation with injustice that defeated the British Empire. Biographers offer insight into his surprising personal life, while historians explore his remarkable accomplishments. Hear from his grandson, Arun Gandhi, and, in a rare interview, the Dalai Lama reflects on Gandhi's incredible life and enduring legacy.

From the formation of his philosophy to changing the face of the world, this is the complete saga of the Pilgrim of Peace Mahatma Gandhi.
