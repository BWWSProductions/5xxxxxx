,Igneous_X4,2010-06-20T03:51Z,"Download THIS torrent. Excellent A/V fidelity. The uploader clearly knew their stuff.

The series itself is highly recommended. One of the few western animation series actually worth watching, IMO."
,believenu,2010-07-03T23:42Z,thanks for this. great torrent .great quality. seeding is sharing
,xchiamiov,2010-07-13T08:07Z,"These files are from ZangetsuZero (Z-Z) on Demonoid.  While he gets poo-pooed a bit in the fansubbing world, what I\'ve seen of his have been much better than the crap non-fansubbers tend to put out.nnJust FYI."
,Rayor,2010-07-30T13:12Z,"I'd like to point out that episodes 53-55 don't have actually have the commentary track in them. I have no clue if they're actually there on the DVD or not, but they're not in the files. They just have a second copy of the normal audio track."
,trucos,2010-08-03T23:07Z,its only tri audio for book 1 and book 2 ..book 3 is only English....... when i play these on my ps3 the audio lags... otherwise good shit 
,ProtoX4,2010-11-13T09:40Z,"Grr, why do they all have ghosting or out of sync audio? (This has ghosting)"
,ibschmitty,2011-01-18T03:56Z,Great torrent but i have a problem. Are the commentaries tracks lost after the file is converted? I cant seem to get any episodes with commentary.
,aew23456,2011-11-14T11:58Z,"Hey dude, on nicktoons today they will be airing Avatar Extras at 12 P.M. Eastern Time, could you please record them then upload them on the bay?"
,aew23456,2011-11-14T12:42Z,"I'm sorry, I thought for sure the commercial said today, but I think it's sometime this week, I'll try to find out when."
,aew23456,2011-11-21T18:12Z,"Sorry about before, but I just found out it comes on 11/21/11 at 12:00 P.M., which is right now, so can you please record it and put it on here?"
,MizuDrops,2012-05-09T22:31Z,"Thanks to everyone who is seeding, every bit helps. I hope this will be high quality, I read different things. What is ghosting exactly? Does this really have ghosting and if so, how bad is it? 

Please seed and keep up the good job. :)"
