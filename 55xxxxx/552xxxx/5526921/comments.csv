,AllTheFun,2010-05-02T16:59Z,train?  really?  this is a terrible torrent
,D0gmeat,2010-05-02T21:05Z,"Some of the songs are not what they're named as. Others are just misnamed tracks. Most of these are oldies (pre-90's).  Probably why the poster opted not to include the CD back for the right song list.

Nothing new about the list; there are other compilations on other torrents."
