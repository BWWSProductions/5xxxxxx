- Universal "all in one" solution
Zoner Photo Studio is a tool that includes a complete set of tools for 
processing digital photos. It is broad enough in scope to meet the needs 
of a wide range of users. Zoner Photo Studio will reliably replace 
the multiple independent, non-interconnected, and uncooperating programs you could end up using without it.

- GPS Support
Tell your photos where they were taken! Then let them show you the same, 
on an on-line map like Google Maps. Photos can store GPS dataâ€”the longitude, 
latitude, and even altitude where they were taken, and Zoner can help 
you automatically bring this info in from any GPS deviceâ€™s track log or 
hand-enter it and can then use it to show shot locations on a map. 
No other photo manager can do this!

- Web Galleries
Web galleries mean no-hassle viewing of your work for anyone youâ€™d like to share with. 
And the web galleries wizard in Zoner Photo Studio means no-hassle creation of web galleries. 
No need to learn a special languageâ€”but you still get to offer your visitors advanced features 
like discussion forums and GPS support: they can easily see on a map where you did your shoot.

- Batch Editing
Digital photography can easily mean hundreds of photos per shoot. 
Even after you toss the bad ones out, brushing up that many photos 
can drive you crazy if you do it by hand. So donâ€™t! Use the new batch 
filter feature in Zoner Photo Studio 9 to make any combination of edits 
you want to any set of photos you want. You can can even save and re-use sets 
of edits. Let Zoner Photo Studio make the computer do the hard work!
