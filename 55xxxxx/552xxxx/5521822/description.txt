Various Artists - Studio One Archives Vol. 2

These were all carefully ripped from original, long out of print,
Studio One vinyl singles. These are old Jamaican vinyl, 
so the quality varies as you might expect, but overall 
is pretty good. 

There are 48 volumes of this stuff. Let me know if you like it.
Each volume contains both sides of about a dozen singles, and fills one CD.
If people like it, and keep seeding, I can work on getting
the rest of them up here.
