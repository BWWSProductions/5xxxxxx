An M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.

Alice in Wonderland:
â€œAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do â€¦â€ .. and from that moment onward we drift with Alice into another world. When she sees a White Rabbit as it runs through the tall grass (looking worriedly at the watch it takes from its waist-coat pocket), she runs after it and drops into a strange dream. The world is full of chatty animals, from a rather stand-offish hookah-smoking caterpillar to the friendly Cheshire Cat which only sometimes goes to the bother of having a body. And everyone seems to be ordering her about â€¦ or telling her to recite poetry! â€¦ and all those verses that she once knew so well seem strangely distorted.

In this book and in â€œThrough the Looking Glassâ€, Lewis Carroll affectionately brought together many of the wonderful stories he told to Alice and her sisters on long summer boating trips.

Through the Looking-Glass:
The sequel to â€œAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandâ€ finds Alice back in Wonderland and a pawn in a surreal chess game. This weird and wonderful book includes the poems â€œJabberwockyâ€ and â€œThe Walrus and the Carpenter,â€ a talking pudding, and that immortal line â€œJam yesterday, jam tomorrow, but never jam today.â€ Lewis Carroll was the nom de plume of Charles Dodgson (1832-1890) an Anglican clergyman, photographer, and mathematician.
