,Chouonsoku,2010-05-09T19:46Z,"I'm not sure what ""other ones"" you're referring to, I uploaded episodes one through three before this one:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5509409/Adventure_Time_with_Finn__amp__Jake_S01E01-03_480p_WEB-DL_AAC_2.0_H.

I can't upload episode five until it shows up on iTunes, which has taken longer than usual this week. As soon as it downloads for me on iTunes I'll upload it here. "
