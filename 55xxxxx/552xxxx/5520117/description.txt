              Release Date....: 2010.04.29
              Genre...........: Drama

       Suffer in Silence
       A man attacks the wrong person in a misjudged effort to take 
       revenge on a boxing coach who abused him during his childhood. 
       When the real culprit is found, still working with children, 
       Banksy has trouble persuading other witnesses to open old wounds 
       and testify against him. It is Neil who persists and gets the 
       vital break, even though he is distracted by the news that his 
       son has leukaemia.
       Lee Ross (EastEnders) and Robbie Gee (Desmond's) guest star.


       NOTE: Dispite the absence of the 'ITV1 HD' logo, this was 
       broadcast in HD. Comparing with previous episodes and other 
       content from the same channel (both HD and SD) it's clear this is 
       indeed HD.
