As a member of the original Delaney & Bonnie & Friends, Bobby Whitlock evolved considerably since that prestigious band disbanded.

From Delaney and Bonnie, Whitlock, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon joined Eric Clapton to form Derek and The Dominoes. Bobby Whitlock wrote about half of the songs on the first Dominoes album â€œLaylaâ€, that has become one of the true classic albums of rock.

This album â€œRock Your Sox Offâ€ features a multitude of guitarists including Jimmy Nalls, Ricky Hirsh, Dru Lombar, Les Dudek and Larry Howard. Kenny Tibbetts played bass, and Jerome Thomas handled the drums. Other sidemen were a.o. Jimmy Hall (sax), Leo LaBranche (trumpet)  and Chuck Leavell (piano)
