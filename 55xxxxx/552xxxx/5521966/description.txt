"Made in the famous "Ãgua de Meninos" market, the greatest popular market in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Salvador is revealed without prejudices, from the world of high finance up to the sordid environment of exotic cabarets."

"Realistic, poignant, almost crude story related with a real - life fire that destroy completely a popular fair located in Salvador, capital of the State of Bahia in Brazil, in the beginning of the sixties. The movie focuses its view on the lives of the poor merchants, prostitutes, sailors and other kind of special population who swarmed the place until its destruction by the fire. The most impressive work of Roberto Pires where he develops a convincing and passionate style with some resemblance with the style of other great directors like Vitorio de Sicca. Great performances by Helena Ignez and Geraldo Del Rey. One of the most estimated Brazilian movies of all time." Quotes from IMDB.
