Any way don't forget to skip from download the separate AC§ dub files if you don't need them."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-05-08T07:58Z,"Those with Win 7 64 bit seem to have issues with playing back seccondary or external audio tracks & subs etc.
Much better then k-lite pack(too complicated) is CCCP ( http://www.cccp-project.net/ ) using the same player MPC) When installing leave all as it is (default). When finished open the player, click View/Options/PlaybackOutput/check Evr Costum Pres & chose System Default under DirectShow Audio.Under Internal Filters - Source Filters should be checked DirectShow Media, Matroska & MP4 and Transform Filters should have H264/AVC(DXVA) checked & next (FFmpeg) unchecked. Now I can even play Blue-ray m2ts being able to switch between Audio tracks by clicking on the Haali Media Spliter on the task bar bottom right."

#1.This is full 1080p. 1 920 x 1 072 because the missing 8 pixels were black bars, just like here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5528589/Avatar_2009_BluRay_1080p_DTS-HD_MA_5.1_x264_-Wrath

Nothing was cropped from the picture.  good luck with your encoding, when you're you're done compare the quality of the two files, lol..

My torrent (1 920 x 1 072 )
snap shot of the same frame as the AMIABLE's:

You see no black bar at the bottom of my picture and my picture has more natural colors, the other has more red/violet in it(it could be the source but also one can manipulate with the colors when ripping with ripbot, I never change the colors).

#2.What I said in description about subtitles refers to TextSubs (srt) not  VobSubs(idx/sub).

es automatikusan megmutatja a felirat listán, vagy rakd be(muxold be) az mkv-ban az mkvmerge GUI -al (   http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix   )"
,SyrinXeno,2010-05-11T19:56Z,"Great torrent, great quality. I used mkvmerge GUI to remove french audio and all subtitles except the english one, reducing the file to 12.4 GB (I did not try to extract eng sub though, cause i want it to be included).

I have Win7 64bit and use VLC media player for playback and everything works fine.

However, to see a sub/translation when they are talking Na'vi I have to turn on a sub, would be nice if they could be displayed without sub too somehow, maybe by including it in audio for showing the right translation?, but i don't know if that's possible.

After all, it's great, I love your multi torrents mkvonly, keep up the good work!"
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-05-12T02:52Z,"English subtitle (I tried it and is good) only for the Na'vi dialog:

http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3672095/avatar-en

Rename it to 
Avatar (2009) BDRip 1080p x264.Eng Na'vi
in the same folder then you should see it in the list of subs as Eng Na'vi. cheers"
