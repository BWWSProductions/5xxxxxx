Hip Linkchain was born Willie Richard in Jackson, Mississippi on November 10, 1936. His father and older brother both played the blues, and Hip followed in their footsteps. He has played the blues all of his life. Linkchain made inroads on the competitive Chicago circuit during the '50s and '60s, playing with harpists Dusty Brown, Willie Foster, Lester Davenport and his own band. During the '60s Linkchain cut a handful of very obscure 45s for the tiny Lola and Sanns logos prior to the emergence of his debut domestic album 'I Am on My Way' for the French MCM label in 1976 followed-up by Change My Blues (recorded:1981-1983) and Airbusters (recorded:1984-1989), his last before his death in 1989. Cancer struck guitarist Hip Linkchain down before he could shed his status as a Chicago blues journeyman. Hip was an experienced blues guitar player and vocalist. He has played with Little Walter, Magic Sam, Junior Wells and Jimmy Rogers. Here is a chance to hear and enjoy Hip Linkchain caught live with headliner Jimmy Dawkins in Champaign, Illinois in the spring of '82.
