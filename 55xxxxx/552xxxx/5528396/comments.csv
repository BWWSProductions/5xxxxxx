,Blogoman,2010-05-03T05:46Z,"The user ""sundaramanikandan"" is uploading SPAM. I downloaded Iron Man 2 and all I unzipped was a txt note saying:

""Hello there,
Please read carefully, 

* Just for you know, I spent a lot of works to make my torrent online, (about 60-90 minutes uploading this movie from
  my local pc to my seedbox.

and now I need your time 1-5 minutes, it's nothing to lose and it won't hurt you, only 5 minutes to gimme support.


Question and answer

Q: So why it's protected by password
A: I just want you to appreciate my effort, and gimme support + feedback

Q: How?
A: Easy, just visit my site, follow the instruction. It's more than enough for me, you only need spending a few minutes.

Q: So how about the password?
A: You will get the password immediately!


Q: What's your benefit?
A: I just want you to make a litle effort for me, is it fair? if you think it's unfair just delete the rar file, and forget 
   for watching the movie.

Please visit http://www justcooldeals com to start it"".

PLEAE STOP THIS GUY. BAN HIM OR WHATEVER.
