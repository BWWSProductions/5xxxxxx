Throughout his career, Charlie Murphy has done it
all. As co-star of Comedy Central's top-rated
Chappelle's Show, writer of the DreamWorks comedy
Norbit and voice on the critically acclaimed
cartoon The Boondocks, Charlie Murphy has made
quite a name for himself. His film credits have
spanned the last 20 years, ranging from Harlem
Nights with Eddie Murphy to The Perfect Holiday
with Morris Chestnut and Gabrielle Union. Now,
drenched in the same "in your face" style of
comedy that has made him a fan favorite, Charlie
Murphy delivers his debut stand-up performance, I
Will Not Apologize, as only he can...raw and
uncut.
