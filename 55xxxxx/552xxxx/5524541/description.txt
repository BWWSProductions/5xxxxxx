â€œWe Have Explosiveâ€ is a song by The Future Sound of London, released in 1997. It is a digitized mix of big beat drums, mono-tone basslines, aggressive guitar stabs, robotic voices and clinical electric beeps.

The successful standout single from FSOLâ€™s Dead Cities LP was, as with other FSOL singles, released with a plethora of remixed versions of it. It is a harder, more techno-oriented song, which is rare for the band; the track became well known to many after being featured in the 1996 hit video game wipEâ€™out" 2097. The song is the first track on the soundtrack, remixes of it were also featured on the other versions of the soundtrack; the â€œHerd Killingâ€ mix was used in the intro sequence.
