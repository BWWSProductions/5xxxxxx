NOTEZ:
First off, NO, there was no uncensored version of
last weeks (s14e06 "201) episode released! The episode
did not even reair on comedy central, and was not posted
anywhere, not even streaming on the SP site! Also the
previous weeks episode (s14e05 "200") was removed from
everywhere aswell at the same time, so luckily we got
it before that happened. It is all because comedy
central censored last weeks episode for the first
time in 14 seasons due to a threat against the creators
by a US Muslim orginazation. The bleeps were not a a joke,
and the creators even stated the final speech was about
intimidation and fear, and they had no idea why it was
bleeped! So now that that's cleared up, here is this
weeks episode uncensored & logo free! Encoded from a
720p Digital VOD file like always. According to the
schedule they have held up, this should be the last ep
until October when the second half of the season will
likely begin, enjoy!
