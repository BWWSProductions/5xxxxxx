Megabit(Mb)/8=megabyte(MB)
So 20/8 = 2.5

You can't download faster than 2.5 MB/s"

,Affas,2010-05-04T20:30Z,"@sciman
I can't help you there, sorry. I am using Vuze. While downloading, limit your upload speed to around 90 kB/s, but I'm not 100% sure on that.. I'm on a 24/1Mb (DL/UL) connection and I have limited my upload speed to 100 kB/s.
Make sure you have forwarded a port if you are using a router.

I would recommend that you switch to Vuze because its easy to use. :)
Hope it helped!"
,dawgy62,2010-05-05T01:54Z,"Watchable, but for all the wizardry and effects u need to hold out for the real deal. Quite a few times it goes outta focus and the sound is tiny with seat creaking noises.

However for the release date and put out service this man deserves his SKULL

A = 5, V = 5-6ish

thanks for the download TZONE!! "
,bluebull64,2010-05-05T04:41Z,A-3/V-8
,bigdaddysouthern,2010-05-05T06:13Z,"A-4
v-6
very watchable best one i've seen so far. fuzzy at times and audio is a little muffled but over all a good download until an R5 comes out."
,sciman,2010-05-06T16:54Z,"Affas i am going to switch once the 5 torrents i have left are finished wont be long but could you run me thorugh the ratio setup once i am ready or if you could just post now how to do it i'll copy and paste it into a word file,you are the geezer"
