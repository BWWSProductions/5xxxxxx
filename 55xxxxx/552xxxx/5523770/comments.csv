,pauliux11,2010-05-31T14:55Z,whats the product key?
[T],sk4nz,2010-06-02T12:57Z,"@pauliux11
Maybe you didn't have applied the crack with succes... There is no serial needed if you do properly the copy/paste of the crack."
,takipogi0930,2010-06-09T19:18Z,is this only in french language? can it be changed to english?
[T],sk4nz,2010-06-13T18:35Z,"This is a MULTI9 : EN/DE/FR/ES/IT/NL/NO/DK/SE 
For installation, you must :
1) Burn or mount .iso and install the game.
2) Execute patch ""assassins_creed_2_1.01.exe"" who is located in the ""UPDATE"" folder.
3) Copy files who where in the -=SKANZ=- folder and paste them in the installation directory
4) Launch the game with ""AssassinsCreedII.exe""

Enjoy !"

,Epiziarh,2010-06-21T16:19Z,"Ok, i dont know what im doing wrong but by your directions its not working.Just need to check if there is something i missed for starters...
In the SK4NZ folder there are 2 files. 
A system information file and a dll file.
ubiorbitapi_r2.dll
I did paste the ubiorbitapi dll in the instalation folder and its not working (it did not prompt for replace file if that means anything)
i updated and everything.Im gonna try to put it in binaries and a few other folders but i doubt that will work.
You said skanz files and that made me believe there are more files in the skanz folder(im guessing you didnt count the system information file in that)
I downloaded some crack alternatives but they say the version doesnt match(they are made for the russian version) but that was after the update. gonna try and apply them without your update.
If you see im doing something obviously wrong please tell me in the comments but i followed the instructions you posted exactly."
,ddcarson,2010-06-22T22:30Z,I have the CD-key problem too. I can install game but when I run it there comes an Ubisoft Registration box and it asks for cd-key.. And it won't start the game when I close the registration. Help?
,ddcarson,2010-06-22T23:37Z,"Plz answer quickly, I want to play this game so badly. And the whole installation and all has worked perfect."
[T],sk4nz,2010-06-23T07:08Z,"You must copy the ""ubiorbitapi_r2.dll"" into C:/Program Files/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher/ and erase the existing file. After you can lauch the game with C:/Program Files/Ubisoft/Assasin's Creed 2/AssassinsCreedII.exe ."
,ddcarson,2010-06-24T01:57Z,"It worked!! I got into the game. Yes, no sleep tonight, awesome!!!! THANKS!!! :)))"
,Epiziarh,2010-06-25T18:14Z,"Aha, i see where my problem was then.
I instaled the game in F:. so when i copied the dll in the instalation directory it didnt work... 
I copied in the game launcher directory (which is always in C: no matter where you install the game) and it works fine now.Tnx for the great torrent just wish you mentioned the gamelauncher thing earlier :S"

,baba1100,2010-09-13T20:10Z,"If anybody is unable to launch the game even after cracking it just down load ""Assasins Creed 2 Crack by iamezaz"" from torrentz and follow the instructions.
I had the same problem and could do nothing for 2 days,then I found it.Just follow the steps,modify ur system's host configuration file,turn ur PC into an offline server for AS2 as instructed.when ur done first run the offline server and then run the game.It runs smoothly."
,baba1100,2010-09-13T20:20Z,"Now I need some help from those who have played it.I have a serious problem,I don't know whether it is due to bug or I am missing something.

In the begining of the game Lucy asks him to get into the animus.when in animus it shows a cut scene of a lady giving birth to a child.then I am being told to press space button to through the child's leg and then i am asked to press another button to punch.I am doing as instructed for 15 mins but the game does not progress. It keeps on asking me to punch.Is it a bug or I have do something else?
please help someone."
