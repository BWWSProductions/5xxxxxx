Hello all you happy campers!

It's surprising that HomerSp has not uploaded this yet. It's the latest installment of his awesome patch that now works for 4.1 and 4.2. it was launched with build 15 but i think it will work for future build as well (seeing that i just used it on build 18).


In this torrent I've added a few things that you might find useful. For more info take a look at the Description.txt in the extras folder.


Enjoy this fine release!
