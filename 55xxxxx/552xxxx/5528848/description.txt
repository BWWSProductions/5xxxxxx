Instructions:
-------------------
1. Download.
2. Extract.
3. Copy extracted folders to your WoW/Interface/AddOns folder.
   - Both Horde and Alliance folders are included, if you don't play both, don't worry, WoW will only load the appropriate guide.
4. Launch WoW.
5. Once you are logged in and at your character screen, click the AddOns button and make sure that ZygorGuidesViewer and ZygorTalentAdvisor are checked.
6. Launch the game and enjoy.


Notes:
-------------------
* FYI, Warcraft AddOns should never include executable files.  With the exception of addons that include graphics or sounds, you should only find LUA, TOC, and XML files.  WoW AddOns do not have the capability to act as a keylogger or virus unless they have that executable in them that shouldn't be there!
* Seeding makes everything go faster!
