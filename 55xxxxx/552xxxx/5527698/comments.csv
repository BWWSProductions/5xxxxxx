,Rajeev334,2010-05-12T22:41Z,Can anyone comment about the quality pls! Thx....
,thefrozen999,2010-05-16T19:03Z,"quality is unmatched as always.

Bluray, just like the 50 Gb version, except 8 pixels difference in the resolution(1920*1072 instead of 1920*1080, as the 50 GB original bluray has).

Shouldn't be a problem.I mean, it's better to download 4.33 Gb instead of 50, don't you think?Yes, now you will all complain about the sound, sound channels etc.

Now everybody has a system and I'm fucking sure that this video will play just fine.

Believe me, zektorm is the best deal ever when it comes tp small size and best quality bluray rips."
