Sorry, that's just not true.

Per http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/trial/faq/:

""Adobe Acrobat® 9 Pro is not available as a trial for Mac OS. Adobe Encore® CS5 software is not available as a trial. Encore CS5 will be installed as part of the trial for Creative Suite 5 Production Premium and Master Collection but will not be available for use until you purchase. The trial versions of Adobe After Effects® CS5, Adobe Premiere® Pro CS5, and Soundbooth® CS5 software do not include some features that depend on software licensed from parties other than Adobe. For example, some codecs for encoding MPEG formats are available only with the full version of these products.""

-Trial doesn't include Adobe Acrobat, which is part of Master Collection.
-Features left out of Soundbooth, Premiere, and After Effects in the trial. From what I understand, these features are provided as downloads when you buy the full version from Adobe. 

However, someone mentioned on another torrent for Master Collection (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5524722/Adobe_Creative_Suite_5_Master_Collection_MAC_OSX-HOTiSO), that if, for example, you start a Premiere project it will download the missing features automatically as needed. I have not tried this personally so I don't know if it works. I am not even sure you could download the stuff if you are blocking Master Collection from ""calling home."""
,bradmajorsok,2010-05-03T03:05Z,"Oh, and another difference between the trial download and a full version: The trial version only includes 64-bit versions of Premiere and After Effects.

Per http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/trial/faq/:

""If you decide to purchase Creative Suite 5 Master Collection, Creative Suite 5 Production Premium, Adobe Premiere Pro CS5, or After Effects CS5, complimentary 32-bit compatible versions of Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 and After Effects CS4 will be provided with your purchase."""

1) / is the system root folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the hard drive icon at devices)

2) ~ is the User folder (which you can find in finder by clicking on the home icon at places)

3) I strongly recommend to delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" folder if you have old Adobe applications installed. Keeping an old version of this folder can cause a variety of licensing errors. It will automatically be regenerated with the CS5 installation.

4) Obviously, if you're attached to your old Adobe application preferences, don't delete the preferences files in the system and User libraries. There is no harm in doing so, they'll be automatically regenerated but by deleting them you will loose your user preferences. I prefer to start with a clean system but that may not be the case for everybody.

5) Acrobat: If you follow the ""removal list"" in my first post you will also get rid of Adobe Acrobat. You can get the latest version from Demonoid (on the Demonoid website search for ""Acrobat Pro 9.0 + 9.1 Update + SN"")."

To fix your Acrobat problem:

- / is the system root folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the hard drive icon at devices)
- ~ is the User folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the home icon at places)
- Open the Acrobat or CS5 (or older CS4) application and re-enter the relevant serials for these products, respectively since the FLEXnet Publisher holds the licensing info.

I have rules in Little Snitch to block the Adobe servers (again) as a pre-caution; the Adobe servers are the only rules set up to block.

If so just burn the downloaded folder containing as such to the double layer DVD, copy the folder from DVD to the Mac and install by double clicking the dmg from the Mac hard drive. Much easier would be to get an 8 or 16 GB USB stick. I recently bought a 16 GB KINGSTON USB stick for $25 on Newegg. Also keep in mind that you'll Mac uses a different file system. It can read Window's FAT32 but FAT32 does not allow files larger than 4 GB, that would be a problem. Google for answers on a solution for that. My 2 cents."

Great upload and explanation. Works good and with no problems. 

Thanks for the upload!"
,76dragon,2010-05-14T16:02Z,"@jimmyk79  I don't think you get how it works. Adobe already has these serials blacklisted regardless of updates. That's why you should block the server list (in /etc/hosts) to prevent communication with these servers. Updating your Adobe CS5 & Acrobat applications won't make a difference. It was the same for CS4. If you had problems then you did it wrong. See my posts on page 2 for details and a tutorial, also on how to fix problematic Adobe installations. I personally don't use little snitch since it's not neededand as a matter of fact, if you use both the server blocker and little snitch conflicts could occur."
,76dragon,2010-05-14T16:04Z,"@sebjavw Yes that's correct, however I personally prefer to get the installation packages from the torrents and bypass Adobe completely."
,76dragon,2010-05-14T16:06Z,"@carleoni, Great it works well for you. Just to let you know, CS5 is not installed ""over"" CS4 and is installed in a separate folder in /Applications. Read my posts on the second page for details on how to remove Adobe files."

Adobe Creative Suite 5 Master Collection
==========================================================================
Step 1 - Remove old Adobe CS4 before Installing Adobe CS5
Root folder
/Applications/Adobe? (everything with Adobe)
/Applications/Utility/Adobe?
/Library/Application Support/Adobe
/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher
/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher
/Library/Preferences/com.adobe... (everything with com.adobe)
Users folder
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Acrobat
~/Library/Preferences/Acrobat
~/Library/Preferences/Acrobat Distiller Prefs
~/Library/Preferences/Adobe... (everything with Adobe)
~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe... (everything with com.adobe)

Step 2 - Disconnect from network/internet (Turn AirPort Off).

Step 3 - Install CS5 MC in Trial mode, select trial mode at the Welcome screen.

Step 4 - Edit the hosts file to prevent the Adobe registration client from contacting its servers.
============== activation server blocks ==============
A. open the terminal.app (found in Applications/Utilities/).
B. type ""sudo -s"" [without quotes]
C. if asked, type your root password and hit enter
D. type ""pico /etc/hosts"" [without quotes]
E. copy the list you find in the post of bookmarks (below) and past in your terminal (at the end of this hosts file)
F. ctrl+x to exit, y to save and enter to confirm the same name and modify your hosts file.

bookmarks list:
# Block Adobe Activation
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-2.adobe.com

127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com

Step 5 - Blocked activation servers
In Terminal copy and paste:
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
Hit return (and type your admin password if asked for it).

Step 6 - Finish Adobe CS5 Installation
A. Start up any CS5 program again (I used Photoshop)
B. Punch in a new serial

You don't have to remove old installations. However, If you have problems with opening any of the installed Adobe applications I  recommend to delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" and ""/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher"" folders and re-enter the relevant serials (CS5, CS4 & Adobe) upon opening an Adobe application. By keeping your old FLEXnet Publisher folders you may run into licensing errors. "

,76dragon,2010-05-18T22:14Z,"@lambos2k  A few things, the free Acrobat Reader is not the same as Acrobat pro. If you have trouble with any of the installed Adobe applications my recommendation is to remove all traces of all installed Adobe software and install CS5 and Acrobat again. See the re-post by st16121 above for instructions.

To get Acrobat 9 pro (not included in the CS5 torrent) Google ""Acrobat 9 pro mac torrent"" and the top link is actually from The Piratebay. There are many alternative torrent sites (e.g. btjunkie) and again Google is your friend for finding them.

After installing Acrobat 9 run Adobe Acrobat > Help > Check for Updates? multiple times until Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro is up to date (version 9.3.2 at the date of this post). "

,76dragon,2010-05-20T05:07Z,@fdejesus1969 Yes you can download and install Adobe updates. I recommend to do so since it fixes bugs in the Adobe software. It won't compromise the server block or have any other negative effect so by all means install the updates.

But I have a question about updating this whole package. I installed everything last night, today when I turned my Mac on, Adobe Extension Manager popped up and asked me to update the whole package (CS5). I had no clue but I wanted to get the lastest updates of course. So I started to update the whole package, after 15 mis. it quit unexpectedly. 

What should I do next?
Update CS5 again?
or just leave it like this with no update?

1) Removing the old CS4 (or older) will remove as well the presets you've added yourself, like particular brushes.

When opened one of the programs enter again the CS5-serial number. This has only to be done once, the other programs will open without asking for a SN.

(see the comments)


Ok guys I have had some trouble getting this to work on lion but this is how I got it working after much trial and error!

1. open terminal
2. type this sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
3. copy the instruction stuff so it looks exactly like the example host file
4. CTRL+O
5. Enter
6. CTRL+X
7. flush as in the instructions
8. then Instead of trying to deactivate, just when it pops up with continue trial or register box just put in the key code provided in the instructions file... the bottom one worked for me!

~~~~~~

Everyone that has upgraded to Lion, Apple have locked the hosts file so using the old Sudo code won't work.

In order to access hosts now open terminal and enter (sudo nano /etc/hosts) Without the brackets of course.

Once you're in paste the text as it says in the instructions, you must use your arrow keys to scroll down and across inside the terminal. Once you have done this press ctrl + x followed by enter. Do not use cmd + S as this will only save the file into your documents.

Enjoy!"
,FilipG5,2011-08-23T01:41Z,THANK U!!!
,mugwort,2011-08-29T05:39Z,"Instructions have you install as a trial, then block access to Adobe license servers (create hosts entries mapping them to localhost, and turn network off) when providing one of the provided license keys.

1) Is it possible to install some components now, and some later on as needed? (CS5 MC requires 26G.) Or must any installations be done in the first, trial phase?
2) What's the recommended procedure to upgrade to CS5.5?

Many thanks for the package!"

,liamteystee,2011-10-20T00:08Z,"This does not work on OS X Lion 10.7.2, I've been trying all day. The activation blocker codes work in the hosts files and so does the flush even the serial numbers! But only when disconnected from the internet. As soon as you hit Wifi: On and open one of the applications it says that you have an invalid serial number!

Anyone know what's gone wrong? or is this happening to a lot of people?"
,richthek545,2011-10-27T12:40Z,"Hi, Im having problmes too since downloading and updating my mac os to 10.7.2

the terminal isn't accepting the line 'sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts' anymore either. Looks like they've got a foot in front of us. 

I don't fancy downloading a Keygen from an  uploader I don't know so will give that a miss. Surely it would just stop working again once internet is reconnected.

Looking forward to the next hack/suggestion. Thanks to the uploader and 76dragon for all the help btw."
,richthek545,2011-10-28T23:46Z,"Dont believe the comment saying to visit a web site for serials, its a geygen download. That isn't the problem.

I just bought a Mac very recently and I've tried to install some Adobe products, incl. the Master Collection, but I just can't seem to do it successfully.
I find Mac a bit strange and difficult from the PC environment, and I simply don't know how to install or patch, edit host files (even if it says in the instructions, because I followed the instructions, and it didn't work).

Please, can someone walk me thru the installation process of the adobe products? Please, someone? I REALLY need the Adobe programs, it's for school work.

Please, someone, add me on Skype, my Skype name is isidor.floros

I hope someone can help me.

,marcblau,2012-04-11T00:11Z,"All the supposed ""full versions"" on Piratebay are ""non expiring"" but never the less ""TRIAL"" versions.

Quote from Adobes webside:

""The import and export of some formats are not supported in the trial version, such as AVC-Intra, AVCHD, HDV, MPEG-2, MPEG-2 DVD, MPEG-2 Blu-ray, and XDCAM""

Any kind of ""trial"" version, even though it might be unlimited in terms of expiry date is completely useless to me and to a lot of others.

If you are not working for Adobe and intend to confuse and discourage people from finding a suitable torrent please do not call your download ""full"" if it is just an UNLIMITED TRIAL

AND PLEASE CORRECT SUCH MISTAKE!!!
