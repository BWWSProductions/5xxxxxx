If people want any of the Now albums from 1 all the way to 75 they come to me to get it which includes this one Now 75.  I notice that this was made recently, whoever did shouldn't have wasted their time.  I have all the best rips of each and every single Now album on the whole internet.  It is stupid to release more of these when I am clearly the main uploader now.

I'm not being funny but really people if they're gonna upload an album first they really should check to see if somebody is already sharing it and their torrent is popular.  Obviously this person didn't do that and just jumped straight into the torrent pool with this.  I have the best version in mp3 of Now 75, no doubt about it.  Plus the earlier albums also.  Maybe one day people will learn that you get them from SpandauBaby now.  Now is owned by me!  Come and download from me and forget all these other uncorrectly tagged poorly made versions..."
,Geiixx,2010-06-23T00:47Z,"@SpandauBaby Maybe you should stop spamming and being so fucking arrogant! You don't even have the freaking album, you have a collection of them all together which some people like me don't want. Pink skull my ass, the reliable people I get torrents off don't spam and put other uploaders down! You own Now? Bullshit, you're just another pirate. Now get your stupid fat head out your own ass and stop freaking spamming, it's pissing me off.

Oh and BTW, thanks uploader :)"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-06-24T00:30Z,"@Geiixx: LOL you moron, there's no need to download them all from me you can just cherry pick the ones you want.  Are you some kind of fucking tool?  Oh and by the way I earned my Pink Skull for releasing my Now albums all as one collection because I have saved a lot of people a lot of time and effort.

Wake the fuck up or just don't address me second thoughts because you are getting way over your own head here.  My Now albums are the best selection of rips that have ever appeared on any torrent site on the whole internet.  If you truly understood how much work it took me then you wouldn't say these things, obviously the person who uploaded this did it in about 5 minutes.  Go figure all that lot out..."
