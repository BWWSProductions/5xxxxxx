multiple commercial web sites that sell access to a vast collection of sexually oriented videos and
pictures. Defendant promotes these sites through an affiliate program, known as

affiliate program also provides a number of other services to affiliated webmasters, including
marketing and promotional tools, and access to detailed sales statistics.

is defined under CAN-SPAM, of the email messages sent by its affiliates that promote and market
Defendant?s web sites. In addition, because Defendant?s web sites are being advertised or promoted
by such messages, Defendant is also a sender, as that term is defined under "
