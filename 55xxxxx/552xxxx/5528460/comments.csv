,schniederzero,2010-05-03T03:52Z,"EZTV is the best! i do have  a question though, how do you upload all of these shows? are you recording off a dvr? and how do you get them to your PC? . Thanks for the help and the great quality shows. "
,weej2008,2010-05-03T03:59Z,thx :)
,oversoul53,2010-05-03T04:44Z,"dude... this can't be right. Family Guy S08E17 hadn't been on yet when u uploaded this, matter of fact, it JUST got over... soooo, what episode is this?

u have it marked as episode 17, but that can't possibly be right, cuz the file is under 400MB and episode 17 is an hour long. episode 17 is called ""Brian & Stewie"" and it's where they get locked in a bank vault. it's their 150th episode.

so either 1. this is fake, or 2. u named your file wrong. which is it?

,Humero88,2010-05-03T05:03Z,"175 +175 = 350mb, so its right for one hour episode, well 40 mins long."
,can_o_whoopasss,2010-05-03T05:44Z,"This is definitely the right episode, 42 mins. Oversoul you must not know eztv very well, he's super human and never uploads fakes. Cheers eztv!"

,Tamarind777,2010-05-06T20:21Z,This is perhaps the worse Family Guy episode I've seen. Looks like the writers are running out of good and funny ideas.
[T],faptokids,2010-05-07T21:35Z,"Tamarind you lame. I guess your sense of humor is underdeveloped, cuz dis shit be dat kill!"

,clamsquadron,2010-05-12T11:25Z,"great quality and speed. 
(since theres no commercials, its 40 mins) the first half an hour is stewie & brian in a room and the last 10 mins are fam guy songs. i cant say i laughed once.. brian eats stewies shit and licks out his asshole and its half an hour spent in a room. not doing anything funny. waste of my life. worst episode evrr"
