      Ray Mears follows some of the world's most dangerous and
      beautiful wildlife. In this episode, he visits the magnificent
      Sawtooth mountain region of central Idaho, which is a prime
      habitat for the notoriously secretive wolf. Ray tracks a large
      pack of these incredible predators, but he has only ten days
      before wolves are taken off the state's endangered species list
      and become prey to be hunted by humans.
