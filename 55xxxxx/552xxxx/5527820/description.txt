                              MOSLEY V MAYWEATHER                          
                                                                           
   Floyd "Money" Mayweather is an undefeated five time world champion. His 
   record is impressive by any standards, with forty straight victories,   
   and 25 knockouts. His skills, speed, and style are flashy and his       
   precision in the ring is striking.                                      
                                                                           
   "Sugar" Shane Mosley, who has scored 39 KOs in 46 wins, is the reigning 
   Welterweight World Champion, a distinction he has held three times. He  
   has beaten the very best in the sport.                                  
                                                                           
   The entire boxing world is buzzing as this dream match-up is now a      
   reality. Its a battle of Speed verses Strength, Flash verses Force,    
   Perfection verses Power.                                                
                                                                           
   This is the first mega-fight of the decade.                             
                                                                           
   Mayweather is part of the Las Vegas social scene and has attained major 
   celebrity status, while the quieter Mosley is headed for the Boxing Hall 
   of Fame once he puts the gloves away. No stranger to the bright lights  
   himself, Mosley twice defeated Oscar De La Hoya.                        
                                                                           
   The motivation for victory is simple  a showdown with the Pound for    
   Pound king, Manny Pacquiao, in what would be the biggest grossing fight 
   outside the heavyweight division, in boxing history.                    
                                                                           
   It's also personal.                                                     
                                                                           
   Mayweather is renowned for his verbal sparring, and in Mosley hes found
   a willing combatant. The taunts have been flying thick and fast but     
   while this ensures the tension remains in the build-up to the showdown, 
   it will mean little once the opening bell sounds.                       
                                                                           
   With an ego matched only by his boxing ability, Mayweather faces the    
   biggest test of his career in Mosley.                                   
                                                                           
   In what's set to be a Classic Showdown as two of the best fighters of   
   their generation collide.
