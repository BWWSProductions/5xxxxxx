This is a fan made compilation including the entire 2001 Greatest Hit release, Big Boi and Dre Present...Outkast, as well as the singles that came after and a couple of songs where OutKast was featured.

I have taken the time to attempt to tag these as a compilation album.  I think I got it right.  There are 31 songs.  I cannot seed full time, so if you like it please help keep it alive!
