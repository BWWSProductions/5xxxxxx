,Sophyah,2011-07-09T06:46Z,Dude your so great for this you pick all the AWESOME OutKast songs !!!! Congrates on the best music torrent i downloaded thus far !
,MuseLeak,2011-08-19T22:31Z,"god dammit my friend... did you know that you can easily all make that by yourself with couple clicks of mouse. So you dont need to depend of other basters on the net. Be the king of the hill or be nothing.. ;D
& dont forgot to buy music, cause the artist is the only one who really deserve full thanks.. not the guy who just put it on the net... is a loser!!!"
,ebimoz,2011-09-07T19:17Z,Yes the artist deserves full credit. Of course some idiot yelling at you about DLing while they are here doing what? That's right you hypocrite moron.

,chunky_monkey1968,2012-04-09T05:57Z,"hey MuseLeak, your name sounds about right, snatcher of music leecher. What the hell you doing here DLing. STFU and keep your comments to your self. And by the way we are giving praise to the person who uploaded this torrent because he wanted to share it."
,Hancock79,2012-04-27T17:03Z,"like anyone put much thought into downloading this torrent, go preach somewhere else MuseLeak"
