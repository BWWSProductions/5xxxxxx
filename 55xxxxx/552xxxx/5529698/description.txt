Deliberate Jeopardization is a new band
from the area of rotterdam.
For years they play and create music what
they call "experimetal"
(that means that they use all the
beautiful elements of the music they like)
With influences of bands like Machine Head, System of a Down, Led Zeppelin, Dry Kill Logic & Hatebreed Deliberate Jeopardization strives
to make their songs interesting.
With rhythm changes, beautiful breaks,
moody intro's, fast riffs and a powerfull hardcore drive the band has shown in past gigs that their music makes even the biggest 'n meanest metalfan smile like a baby.
This is a band that you HAVE to witness live !!

The past years Deliberate Jeopardization
has worked hard to stay alive.
Bandmembers left, inspiration was gone and
the search for new (capable)bandmembers
seemed to take forever.
but after all these years of fighting and writing new songs they've formed the perfect collective that Deliberate Jeopardization needed al those years.
And now -with all the weak elements out of the band- Deliberate Jeopardization can show the world that there is only one band to
fill your needs.
Go see 'em ... NOW !!!
