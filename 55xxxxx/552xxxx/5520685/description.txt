PlayStation-Ready HD Movie Trailers
April 29, 2010


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p.

Yup, another delay. Those will be happening, since it's summer
and there's lots of things to do besides collecting trailers.

Also, I'm stopping to seed old trailer packs: only 12 weeks
of history from now on. Use sources listed below if you cannot
download needed pack.
