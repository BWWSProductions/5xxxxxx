(If it matters, I'm in the US)

Thanks thethingy for the upload, wish I could have actually tried it out. "
[V],thethingy,2010-05-06T19:24Z,"LunchBoxDuh, all torrent files are watched, turn on encription and use a vpn"

,shadow_764,2010-05-29T11:23Z,"thethingy, I've tried quite a few torrents that claim to have one (iso's, so you cant tell until you've downloaded it) and most just have the modded hosts file instead. does this one contain a keygen?"
[V],thethingy,2010-05-31T21:06Z,"shadow_764, i dont put keygens in any adobe torrents as you dont need one and av's pick up viruses, there are a list of serial numbers though"
,the_one_one,2010-06-01T00:13Z,"Perfect and as easy as 1, 2, 3."
,syndre,2010-06-12T01:15Z,"thanks thingy! I appreciate your work, and I totally understand why you run run the keygen yourself a bunch of times and just paste valid reg codes in a nfo... If people want the keygen there are hundreds of other places to get it."

,1PotH3Ad,2010-10-04T06:03Z,"Nevermind, I got it working, I didn't read the Read me thoroughly. Thanks a lot for uploading this, works great."
,AlmightyDread,2010-10-17T00:18Z,"This is one seriously sweet download: files clean, instructions clear, plus my hosts file is stronger than ever. A note to the wise: if, like me, you use MVP hosts, you obviously don't want to delete those entries. You don't have to replace your entire hosts file to keep Adobe under manners. Just open your hosts file (Notepad is all it takes), copy the 21 lines beginning with ""127.0.01"" from the instructions, and paste them at the end."
,avist,2010-10-17T08:49Z,Another awesome upload by thethingy. Works great on win7 x86

,User897,2011-01-27T03:26Z,"I installed this and it worked great, EXCEPT....

For some reason, the TR2N font won't work on this copy for me.  I had to revert to Fireworks MX to get it to work.

Weird."

,Haidenai,2011-03-10T10:51Z,"I appreciate your uploads the Thingy, but why one earth did you split the patches and the app into two seperate torrents? Currently I have a load of crap I dont need on my disk, when all I really need is the DLL and a text file saying ""Patch your host file""...."

,ckyui69,2011-10-21T10:04Z,Is it normal for the Adobe Fireworks CS5 to ask me for a Product ID # every time I open it? I entered both of your Product Key's and now it says they don't work. I can still open the product. Is this normal?

No problems whatsoever installing this with the other Adobe software that I already installed from you (with the same host file)"

,helpful_comments,2012-04-25T06:22Z,"Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.

Seems to work flawlessly. I didnt replace or edit the host file... It looked similar already. I have other torrented Adobe programs so maybe that's why... but I honestly never touch the host file. I always just install and replace the dll. 

Which brings me to this... 
I have a 32bit dll and 64bit dll, from another Adobe torrent. 64 bit didnt work, seeing how it installed as a 32bit I figured that.. Not sure if I missed where I could choose this ? But 32bit works fine. Everything goes well.  "
