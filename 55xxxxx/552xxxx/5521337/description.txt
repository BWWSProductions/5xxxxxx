This is a cleaned up and revised version of this torrent:
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3589676/Secrets_of_lock_picking

Included a .PDF version with images inserted and an editable .odf file (open office format) so you can make a better version if you have the inclination.

The author claims it's "secrets of lock picking" by steven hampton, but it's all a bit sketchy.  I think it's just some thing written by some shameless haxor looking for some credit.

I'll let you be the judge.
