,onelung5,2010-05-01T00:26Z,Finished downloading...the video is great....but what is wrong with the sound???
,dazul69,2010-05-01T15:54Z,"Sound is only good in VLC player. Other then that, not very good converting/burning to a dvd.
I wouldnt call this a DVDrip. It came from a R1 NTSC DVD9. Hence thats why the sound quality is not up to standards."
