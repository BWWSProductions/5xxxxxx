Aired April 29th 2010. Episode: Brown Betty
According to the scene groups and a couple of misinformed websites, this is S02E20. For anyone who actually watched the Jan. 11th airing and looked up the truth, we know this is wrong.

Initial speed will be slow, please help seed if you can, thanks.

Compatible With DivX DVD Players (720x400 Resolution).

Method used:
VirtualDub MKV Plugin:
Lanczos3 Resize Filter and Saved uncompressed @ 50GB
Compressed With DivX 2-Pass @ "Insane Quality" Setting
Resolution: 720x400
Bitrate: 1999
Audio: AC3 ACM 5.1 Channel @ 256kbps @ 48,000hz

Note: I switched resizing from the encoding step to the uncompression step, which made it possible to use the better Lanczos3 resize filter. I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.

So feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.
