So this is my first torrent here.

As the title says, this is the fourth chapter of the fourth book of the Inheritcance cycle, by author Christopher Paolini, named King Cat.

It was released with the paperback edition of Brisingr on April 13th 2010 in the US and Canada.

When I realized it wasn't available on any torrent website, I decided I had to do it.  If you're like me, you didn't want to buy the Brisingr in paperback, because you already had it in hardcover.

For those interested, the original transcript can be found here :

Though because the website was copy protected, I had to do some hacking in order to get it.

So envoy !
