,Cespur,2010-05-01T01:46Z,"Oh, and PT (I really, really hate people doing requests but for this one time): Any chance you'll be adding chapters into the files? Makes watching them easier!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T02:20Z,"if you press the down arrow on your apple tv remote you can skip around pretty easily.  Wish chapters I would just have to make them all generic, every 5 min skip to something, which is the same function as pressing down arrow is it not?"
,Cespur,2010-05-01T14:11Z,"When I wanna show someone else something in a movie on the iPad or iPhone I can skip right to that part with chapters. But it doesn't really matter, you and HR (same person?) have almost single handed filled my entire movie collection."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-01T19:22Z,does the ipad play the brrips ok?
,Cespur,2010-05-02T00:50Z,Perfectly!
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-02T07:44Z,"watched this movie this evening.  you can't tell me that john wouldn't of totally taken her when she made it so obvious she still wanted him and in bed at that.  Gimme a break, lol, with that much history and passion he definitely wouldn't of walked out of the house.  That was just loony, lol."
