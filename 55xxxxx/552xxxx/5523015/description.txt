(NEW IN 3.0) Shotgun Gunfighting- Gabe Suarez

The shotgun, if used correctly inside its performance envelope is, potentially, the best CQB weapon in existence today. This dynamic DVD presents a reality based, aggressive, close quarters combative method of deploying the shotgun. We discuss the various generations of shotgun development, as well as common-sense accessories that the viewer will find useful.

Filmed outside, in the Northern Arizona back country, we had the freedom to do as we pleased with regards to setting up shots and angles to capture every nuance of handling the weapon. There is some wind evident in some parts of the production, but it does not detract from the presentation of the information. All four generations of shotgun development are discussed and shown to include the double barrel, the pump action, the semi auto and the magazine-fed semi auto, as well as what each generation brings to the table. Most demonstrations are conducted with the Remington 870, the Remington 1100, or the Saiga 12.

Most shotgun schools spend a great deal of time discussing modifications and additions to the shotgun, or try to convince the viewer to turn this CQB weapon into some sort of a rifle suitable only for range games, or gun school scores. That is happily not the case in SHOTGUN GUNFIGHTING! In this DVD you will learn what the shotgun is REALLY for, and perhaps as important, learn the weapon's limitations. After a brief overview of the fundamentals, we progress quickly to advanced reality-based drills such as Hostage Rescue Shooting, Ambidextrous Work, and Ammo Transitions. This is the Shotgun version of Close Range Gunfighting.

This will not only keep everything organized, but will make future additions much more easy to manage.  This way, whenever 4.0 comes out, you have have it grow right into your original 3.0 torrent, so you don't have to download 40GB of repeat files all over again.  Fair enough?  :)

I have said this time and time again, but nowhere will you find such a large torrent for this kind of content.  A very useful torrent if you take advantage of it.  Enjoy. :)
