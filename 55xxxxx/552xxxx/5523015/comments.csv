,sparks1000,2010-11-06T09:07Z,"Because this type of torrent material is rare, unusually large, and I am 'very' grateful to the two people who put it together & uploaded(with valuable upstream). I have being up-loading this torrent for 2+months(24/7), 168.5GB uploaded at a ratio of 6.81. I hope you guys starting, or now leaching bandwidth, will do like-wise with this type of difficult to get material, as long as we have a free Internet ! ( Anti-American-Anti-2nd Amendment rights 'Senator Jay Rockfeller' is trying to pass laws to shut-down many educational torrents services just like this one). Invest in large portable HardDrives(that will run with Laptop USB power) & Burn loads of hard copies to DVDs and distribute freely to friends also(do not depend on the Internet), and kick back a few bucks to the guys who made the films to begin with, if you possibly can, by buying some of their other great DVDs."

,cognus_amaurosis,2011-02-24T02:00Z,Just starting to download with 17 seeds and 90+ peers... I'll be seeding for a long time to try and improve those numbers.  Thanks for the great torrent!
,bobgkh,2011-04-28T05:27Z,I have a video (Kalashnikov Armorer with Jim Fuller and Gabe Suarez) that I would like to give you for any future updates. What's the best way to get it to you?
,aushunter,2011-07-17T09:59Z,"Thank you for this great training download. Took a while but i did it.
Will seed forever so other like minded patriots can benefit. "
,prasnto,2011-08-03T22:57Z,"The file GabeSuarez_CombativePistolMarksmanship.avi in the 3.0 folder is incomplete, it cuts off at 01:18:23 in mid-sentence. If anyone has the full version they can please upload that would be fantastic.

And please, when you're encoding a rip double-check it before uploading to make sure that it's the complete video!

And bobgkh, why don't you just make a torrent of the video so we can all get it?"
,prasnto,2011-08-03T22:59Z,Small correction: the aforementioned video cuts off at 01:19:28 (but is still incomplete...).
