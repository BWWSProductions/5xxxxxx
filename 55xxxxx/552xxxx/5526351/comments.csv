Your welcome. Thanks for the first comment! I put a lot of time into this torrent trying to make it perfect."
,Fireholder,2010-05-15T19:08Z,Thanks a ton! :D
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-05-17T09:33Z,"Fireholder-

You're very welcome."
,vhscampos,2010-06-17T14:39Z,"Hi, can you tell if the first albums are the remastered versions or not?

By the way, Kings and Queens from Draw The Line is not the complete version. :("
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-06-18T06:06Z,"vhscampos -

I don't know if the first albums are remastered or not. But they sound decent in 320 Kbps.

Kings and Queens is on 3 different albums in the torrent. One is 3:46 (Greatest Hits) 3:48 (Draw The Line) & 5:33 (Pandora's Box Disc 3). Cheers!"

No worries mate."
,Avl180,2010-09-13T19:09Z,Lots a messed up tracks!!  Nine lives  and a couple other albums are missing alot of the first part of most of the songs.  Its like they have been cut off.  
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-09-13T21:09Z,"Av1180 -

Thanks for letting me know.  All in all I think most would agree that this is a good discography.

Cheers!"
,hijones,2010-09-15T17:09Z,"seriously, one of (if not THE) best torrents out there!  thanks!!"
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-09-15T17:39Z,"hijones

Thanks for the props. Your welcome!"
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-09-15T20:38Z,"Here is the link to my ""GOOD COPY"" of ""Nine Lives"" to replace the bad copy in this torrent. Thanks.

,Adveser,2010-12-26T15:56Z,"I really hate to be the asshole here, but all the albums except for Permanent Vacation have all the high frequencies brick walled (meaning there was a filter applied to wipe out the highs) to the point that the files are worse than 128Kbps. Either these were upconverted from a horrible copy or the filter makes the bitrate absolutely irrelevant.

I mean I wouldn't complain about the highest of highs because most can't appreciate or tell what that does, but there is absolutely no fidelity on these copies.

A appreciate it man, but this is seriously the worst encoding I have ever seen, compressed down to 8-track levels of muddiness. Where are the cymbals?"

,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-29T13:22Z,"sorry vtwin but the quality is SO bad, it actually seems you downloaded a 128kbps discography and converted it to 320, sorry bro"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-29T14:11Z,^ I HATE making comments like that :( especially to such a well organised and pretty discography..
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-01-30T21:00Z,"It's interesting the varied comments that I received on this torrent. I believe some of it is good & some of it is not so good.
This was my very first upload. Trust me, my uploads are a lot better now. All comments are always welcome on any of my torrents. Don't feel bad telling me that it sucks if it does! Practice makes perfect. Cheers!"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-31T09:14Z,"I actuallly kind of want to take it back now, when I downloaded albums ""Gold"" and ""Pandora's box"", quality was excellent, but ""Get a grip"" was horrid. Nonetheless this is an OUTSTANDING collection which is beautifully organised.

Did u do cd-rips im just wondering?"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-02-03T13:35Z,"This is deadset the only collection of aerosmith at 320, some songs u cant even find with 320 on torrents...

Please re-do this collection with better quality :)"

,moonerman100,2012-05-23T01:19Z,"Thanks... Just one problem, in the ""Nine Lives"" album, the first song (Nine Lives) is ripped bad. It starts from a few seconds into the song, then jump back to Steven's imitation of the cat."
