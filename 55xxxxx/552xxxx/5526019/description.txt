For the encore of the Foo Fighters' show on June 7th of 2008, they played the Led Zeppelin songs 'Rock and Roll' and 'Ramble On', with none other than Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones joining them to do so. (Led Zeppelin guitarist and bassist, respectively)

Rock and Roll had Taylor Hawkins on vocals and Dave Grohl on drums.
Ramble On had Dave Grohl on vocals and Taylor Hawkins on drums.

Dave Grohl had a few words to say before the start of the encore. Some of those words had four letters in them. :)
