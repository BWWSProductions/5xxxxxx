"THE ART OF DISCOURSE"

After Pierce (Chevy Chase) crosses a line with Shirley 
(Yvette Nicole Brown), the group is forced to choose 
between the two. Meanwhile, Jeff (Joel McHale) and 
Britta (Gillian Jacobs) face off against a group of 
young bullies, and their mother (guest star Lisa 
Rinna). Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) 
embark on a college bucket list of things they must 
accomplish before they graduate.

Enjoy :)
