,ch3573r,2010-05-07T21:44Z,"Does not work in Xbox! Xbox 360 will not play 6-channel audio. I tried using MP4demux to remove the 6-channel audio, and add the 2-channel .MP4 file includes in this torrent... but it still won't work.

Mp4demux cannot add a .mp4 file for an audio track. It won't even let you open it. I tried changing the file extension of it to AAC and then tried multiplexing it... but there was no audio when the video played.

What can I do to get this to play in my Xbox?"
