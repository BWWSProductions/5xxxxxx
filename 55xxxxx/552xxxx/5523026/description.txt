Geoff & Maria Muldaur - Pottery Pie - 1967

Ok.  Now I'm digging way, way down.  This is the first of two recordings by Geoff & Maria Muldaur after they left Jim Kweskin's Jug Band.  It's a little folksy, a little bluesy and a little jazzy in the New Orleans tradition.    This cd was released on the Hannibal label in 1993.  Sorry, I don't have "Sweet Potatoes" by Geoff & Maria, or any Jim Kweskin stuff....my vinyls are long gone.
