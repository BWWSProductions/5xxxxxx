Thanks for the upload."
,ockyilson,2010-05-03T07:02Z,appreciate it as always. thx
,dracownsu,2010-05-03T07:05Z,Many thanks.
,GSPitman,2010-05-03T07:18Z,can anyone vouch for this one being real?
,jt07,2010-05-03T07:22Z,1.46? Why so much bigger this week?
,hortonofdoom,2010-05-03T07:25Z,Why is it 2 times bigger than the normal ones? and why do i get a stream of 0.4kb a sec? with a bandwith of 24mb/sec
,yazychnik,2010-05-03T07:27Z,"Good on ya, TVTeam! Gratzi, Bedankt, Merci, Spasibo, Danke & Thanks...just to cover more possibilities ;) 

and GSPit, sure it is good 2 go. They would not have a VIP icon in their corner if it was garbage 8-|"
,dkporn,2010-05-03T07:31Z,It is 1.46gb because it is a 720p release. They're always that size. The smaller 500mb releases are not HD quality.
,GSPitman,2010-05-03T07:44Z,"This is the normal size for 720p torrents, but there have been fakes floating about.  I hope this is real.

Is ANYONE getting any download speed on this?"
,JeffInHamburg2,2010-05-03T07:45Z,Is anyone having trouble with this downloading?
,Neo2109,2010-05-03T07:46Z,"Waiting on regular 550MB release, thanks :)"
,SIKPRODUCTIONS,2010-05-03T08:02Z,"I am glad to see an appropriate file size..Previous releases were on par with my quality expectations.
Thankx for the upload!
I will post when finished with my observations relating to quality."
,frivalousMC,2010-05-03T08:08Z,"Its the 720 p version that is why is 1.4 gb, I personally dont need a file so big so I will wait for the 550 mb version.  To the other guy its slow because there are no seeders, and thanks for tvteam upload I have no doubt its legit im just gonna wait for the smaller version.
I suspect that the smaller version isnt up becuase EZTV doesnt have it up on their site and they are usually the ones who upload that copy."

,n3llo,2010-05-03T09:34Z,peace
,frivalousMC,2010-05-03T12:08Z,"I just finished the download and it works, BUT...not on xbox cause its a fucking MKV file or whatever you call it, I will seed it for a while for you guys though and watch it on windows media player"
[V],TvTeam,2010-05-03T17:00Z,"over 3000 leecher at once and only 1 seeder, it takes time to get more speed.

We are doing our utmost. :)"
,RALSTON8358,2010-05-03T20:19Z,Many thanks!
,dracownsu,2010-05-04T02:23Z,"Finished DL will seed for a few weeks for everyone. Definatly the real deal, and good quality to boot. 

The episode however is WAY too focused on a love story that no one gives 2 shits about. This is supposed to be about WAR ffs not love lost. 

Anyway, Thanks again for being the goto guys for this."
