,damdam69,2010-05-01T05:34Z,of course it doesn't work on a mac. it is a keygen for windows!
,rainhaven,2010-05-01T06:42Z,previous versions use same serial in Windows and Mac; but seems not anymore in this version
,jant30,2010-05-01T07:02Z,Is there a mac version up yet? or in progress??
,jammeke,2010-05-01T09:52Z,Allot of users need a keygen for Mac. Who's goiing to be the first to apply a working keygen & activator for Apple?
,Grundit,2010-05-01T11:37Z,Works fine with windows as stated. I could really use a mac serial as well if anyone has one.. They Windows keys do not work on Mac. 
,griffo1000,2010-05-01T12:22Z,"This is a keygen for CS4, not CS5!!!"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-05-01T15:11Z,@griffo1000 stop trolling dude...
,gendoikari1,2010-05-01T15:30Z,For some reason when I open it it says that it is a CS4 keygen. Would it still work with CS5?
,Arlo5000,2010-05-01T16:06Z,"Deactivaded CS4 then uninstalled.

Installed windows cleanup tool rebooted.

Ran Adobe CS4 clean Script rebooted.

Start CS5 install, provide serial number.

Run Keygen. Answer is ???????

1330-1054-5518-7749-9186-5808

This serial number not valid for this product!!!!!

Host file is Patched.

,GolemdX,2010-05-01T18:14Z,"It IS the same keygen as one that was used for the CS4 products, BUT an Adobe Master Collection CS5 option is included."
,kustok,2010-05-01T21:25Z,"Ok, hosts don't work, you have to block the access using a Firewall like ESET, once you block any attempt to phone home, it will work, except Premier Pro, PPro doesn't start unless you give it an access to internet, it just hangs in there at splash screen, but when you let it through it barks the serial, something has to be done about it."
,kustok,2010-05-02T11:09Z,"@iluvwarez

thanks for the update, however it doesn't solve the problem. Premier Pro, After Effects and Encore don't start unless they are given the access to the internet, they all stop initialization with a splash screen that says ""Loading ExporterQuickTimeHost.prm"", this solution makes video editing impossible. I think the actual files need to be patched so they don't have to phone home. At least this is how it was done with CS4 MC from Mazuki.

Also some more info (not related to above proble, but helps in general): 

After its done installing(Do not run any app yet), head over to:

C: > Program Files (or x86) > Common Files > Adobe > OOBE > PDApp > UWA >

Rename or Add a word at the end of these:

Adobe Application Manager (Updater)

AAM Updates Notifier

,kustok,2010-05-02T12:41Z,"I should specify, the programs eventually start, but it may take over 10 minutes. It appears as if it's something Quick Time related, however it starts easily if you let it access the internet, minus key invalidation.

Using Trial from Adobe plus this keymaker with host blocked and ESET firewall.

If you are reading this and know the solution, please share for all."
,tjaeger5,2010-10-13T10:49Z,Worked perfectly for Flash Builder 4. Thank you!
,JBGTPB,2010-11-03T20:07Z,"Hey, can someone please verify this is working fine
'cos all I see is complaints about mac and a possible troll who suspects it is CS4
cos I mean, HOLY SHIT THIS IS CS5 MASTER COLLECTION for free
:O :O :O
pretty huge
anyways, my ISP is pretty harsh on torrents so a 202kb file is still gonna take a while, so I wanted to check it is working. it seems... almost too good to be true!"
,JBGTPB,2010-11-03T22:51Z,"Managed to download it, completely virus-free despite AVG's incessant warnings. gives you keys for most standalone products as well as the master suite cs4 and 5. you can change the name. I had to open CORE10k.EXE, not sure what I did but it worked after computer restart
just downlooding the trial version now, I will see if the serials work or whether I have any ""phone home"" issues, though any tips in advance would be appreciated"
,Lolmen,2010-12-02T21:05Z,"If U look better, u'll see that near the Photoshop Keygens, there is also one which is uppercased alot, which is the one you want to be using. ;)"
,I0I0,2011-01-15T05:47Z,AVG reports a virus on this keymaker :(
,halphprice,2011-03-19T20:09Z,"OK, so this IS for CS5, it's in CAPS by adobe photoshop name.  

THIS IS VALID AND GOOD, I can understand the confusion.  SUCK TO BE YOU MAC-USERS :D Time to goto Boot Camp"

,svetkopetko5,2011-10-31T12:56Z,this is full of viruses and trojans like every MAFIAA torrent and it does NOT work. it's not even for CS5 obviously...
,spar12tan,2012-03-15T09:53Z,"It worked perfectly... until it crashed. Won't open.. Other than that the keygen works fine. AVG tends to kick up warnings as its mood takes it. Temp Disable avg, run keygen, copy paste to text doc, close keygen, enable avg.."
