,xhizorx,2010-08-10T01:50Z,for X64 you need the patch from microsoft.
,Vb08H4x,2010-08-12T08:34Z,So is it just a download and install or do you have to mount it?
,natchos,2010-11-02T12:32Z,"Uh guys you do know that you can get this for free from Microsoft themselves?

And also about the trial thing, you can get a registration key for free by opening up the help menu, clicking register product and filling out the forms. It requires you to have a MSN/Hotmail/Live login but its free."
