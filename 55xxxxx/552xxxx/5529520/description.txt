The Postmaster
The Postmaster Nandalal (Anil Chatterjee), a young man arrives from Calcutta as the postmaster of a small village Ratan (Chandana Banerjee), a pre-adolescent orphan girl, is his housekeeper/maid. Though only a child herself, she cooks, cleans and cares for Nandalal. 

Nandalal, a city bred young man, is like a fish out of water in the village. He is bored. On an impulse and probably to kill time, he begins teaching her to read and write. She responds eagerly. A tender bond develops. Ratan is devoted and waits on him. For Nandalal, however, she is just a pastime.

When Nandalal contracts malaria, Ratan nurses him back to health. But he has had enough of the rural life and resigns. Ratan is heartbroken. He prepares to leave without realizing how attached to him Ratan has become. 

Ratan is hurt when Nandalal offer her some money as a tip for her services. We see her passing by Nandalal carrying a pail of water. She has been crying but too proud to accept the tip. A few moments later we hear her voice. She is informing the new postmaster that she has brought water for him. 

Nandalal is overwhelmed by emotions as he stares at the money in his hand. Putting the money back in pocket, he walks away.
