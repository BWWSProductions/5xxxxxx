Pete Drummond introduces a concert from Queen Mary College with Ian Dury
and the Blockheads, Chaz Jankel and Dr Feelgood.

Ian Robins Dury (12 May 1942 â€“ 27 March 2000) was an English rock and roll
singer, lyricist, bandleader and actor who initially rose to fame during the late
1970s, during the punk and New Wave era of rock music. He is best known as
founder, frontman, and lead singer of the British band Ian Dury and the
Blockheads, who were amongst the most important groups of the New Wave
era in the UK.

As a lyricist, his authorship of popular songs of the time, in particular the single,
"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll", was underplayed at the time by critics, though it
has been performed and quoted by countless musicians since it was written.

Dr. Feelgood are a British pub rock band formed in mid 1971. The name of the
band, Dr. Feelgood, is slang for heroin, or for doctors who are prepared to
overprescribe drugs. In 1962 the name was originally adopted by the American
blues pianist and singer Willie Perryman (also known as "Piano Red") who
recorded his song "Dr Feel-Good" under the name "Dr Feelgood & The
Interns". The song was covered by several British beat groups including
Johnny Kidd & The Pirates, who used it as the B-side to their 1964 single
"Always and Ever". It was this recording that influenced the band to adopt it as
their name.
