Private detective InÃ©s infiltrates the employees at a multinational

face with a difficult emotional and ethical decision. Eva, just back
from maternity leave, is juggling work and family obligations when 
she discovers that her partner IÃ±aki is hiding something fundamental
to their future as a couple. Carmen, the most experienced of the 
three, observes and tapes Sergio's marital collapse but can't see her
own marriage is dead. While working at the detective agency run by
