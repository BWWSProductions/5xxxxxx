Home shopping channel host Hyo Jung (Eugene) and four other girls are enrolled at a mysterious yoga center that promises eternal beauty to one student after a week of intense training. To master the class, however, they must abide by the center's rules, including fasting, not looking at mirrors, and breaking contact with the outside world. As the week wears on, strange things begin to happen, and it becomes increasingly clear that there is something very wrong with the yoga center and its gorgeous young trainer (Cha Soo Yeon).
