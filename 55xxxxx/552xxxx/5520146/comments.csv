[V],[HB],2010-04-29T20:25Z,Ya it's 2010 version..!
,HOT-LIPS,2010-04-29T20:33Z,THANK YOU.
,grizzmo,2010-04-29T22:33Z,"Thank you,

but what is better: this or driver genius pro or even drivermax, which found drivers that the others didn't find."
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-04-30T01:19Z,"@grizzmo

IMHO, Driver Genius is probably the best. But, it's hard to find a reliable ""crack"" that will keep it working?"
,grizzmo,2010-04-30T10:02Z,"@TheEmpathicEar

thanks for your opinion. I agree.
Time the groups release a nice working keygen if possible."

Use 'driverscanner.exe'"
