find out for yourself"
,Nansin,2010-10-30T19:03Z,"There is nothing wrong with the 'serial' (as it has been called). You need to generate a new one using the keymaker. For a little more detail see the comment here:

(You do not need to download the '32 & 64 bit' torrent at all.)

But the installed version doesn't. Whether I use the keygen, or the included key file, it says it's invalid."
