,shreddir,2010-05-04T12:52Z,"does anybody else notice frame skipping during playback.  I have a weak PC--Northwoods Pentium 4 cpu with AGP Nvidia GeForce 6200 video card, but since I use AVC decoding software with Media Player Classic home cinema player  most other 720p X264 encoded videos play back perfectly. Not this one?  Is the Dimension 720p recording on the other torrent uploaded after this one better?"
