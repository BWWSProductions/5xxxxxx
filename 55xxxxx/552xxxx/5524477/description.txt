This albumâ€”or soundscape, as it could be describedâ€”is quite simply spellbinding. Released during an especially productive period for the loosely termed â€œambient music,â€ LIFEFORMS had considerable impact upon the musical picture of 1994. Few (if any) outfits could claim to have bettered FSOLâ€™s epic offering that year.

LIFEFORMS equally rewards both intensive and passive listening. Intensive listening reveals a taut structure, with long periods of timelessness suddenly pushed onward by contemporary dub and house beats. Passive listening gives a 90-minute collage of sound that provides a chilled-out antidote to the pace of modern life. Running water, distant chants, tribal rhythms, and various Eno-esque noises are all presented here in glorious surround-sound. Listening on headphones reveals the beauty of the soundscape even more brilliantly. FSOL must have spent many a late night learning how to employ sound technology so well. Itâ€™s time well spent, though, as LIFEFORMS is a masterpiece that stands comparison with great ambient albums by the Orb, Brian Eno, and the KLF. Recommended without reservation.
