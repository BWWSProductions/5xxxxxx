Glad to see TPB is back on-line. Lets hope it stays up for 'non-VIP' members. Such as excellent contributors like your good self.

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon

@ALL - This is from testing on my system, - A PS3 with HDMI to a 32"" LCD.

The 'audio' encoding of the [quark] has been changed so now no tricks needed to play it. I have a basic 'quad+woofer' system (enhanced stereo basically) and I CANNOT tell the difference between this and a 272p file.

A/V quality for [quark] (on my system) in now 10/10.

20-40 - the legend, the genius - has done it again - something I did not think I would ever see. Compression with no loss of 'real' quality.

Don't ask me how, he tried and it I  understood very little, to use a methaphor, dogs hear differently from humans. This is a bad methaphor but it's all down to what humans can hear and distinguish.

I'm not an 'audio-phile' and it was massive geek speak to me & I consider myself reasonably intelligent and a geek).

I bow before the master!!!!!

His contribution/invention of [quark] should ALONE elevate him to VIP (green skull).

Humbly
Jon"
