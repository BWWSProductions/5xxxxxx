,bones42,2011-08-20T10:27Z,"For some reason I cannot get this to work.  I have had my PC in the ""Need Activation Key"" stage for probably about a year now because it wasn't harming anything, but now its just kinda annoying.  I have tried both ways to do this but it still says that I need to activate windows.  Any ideas?"

There are two activators in the torrent, just extract, and run one, if that one doesn't work, try the other. 

Please comment and seed!"

,TaiTheGuy,2011-10-09T13:38Z,"I format, upgrade, tend to, brute force, reinstall windows on &  fix & sell computers ALL THE TIME.
I've used this patch about a dozen times now, over the past year or so, and I just wana say that it's awesome!

I somehow managed to misread or otherwise screw up the process on my 1st attempt, long ago. But ever since then, it's worked like a charm.
I don't even think I need the directions anymore- I pretty much have the sequence memorized.
