,History_Mystery,2012-06-03T05:44Z,"@Rashid123 - If someone learned English from 1977 material, would thier English be different from what we speak today? No. There are minute Grammatical changes, but the words of the language remain the same, and will for many more years. The only new words that surfaced in the german language have to do with modern technological terms, as have many other languages. German dialect and the words that it consists of have not changed. Before you post and spread false information due to an uneducated opinion, do research."
