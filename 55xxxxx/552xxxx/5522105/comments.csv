,dick4brains,2010-05-02T19:04Z,"thanks.  great stuff.  Saw them the other night at HOB in Houston.  Short set, but very good.  They also played Like a Prayer (Madonna) and Flight of Icarus (Iron Maiden).  They were much better than the headliner, HIM, imho...  I think Valo just doesn't have much voice left and he was just buried in the mix much of the time.  These guys though...  go see them live when they come to your town!!!  especially if they headline their own show..."
,rarvai,2010-05-03T00:37Z,This is complete and total bullshit. This is a transcode. Sounds just as shitty as my 128 version. I have very expensive headphones.
,hypnotic21,2010-05-03T22:46Z,Can you get the new album from Anew Revolution?????
,ObeEbe,2010-05-04T22:32Z,"Thanks djsforfun! =) This is great music. The sound quality is not that good, though. 

Could you please upload a lossless FLAC-version of this album too ? Would be most appreciated..."
,PhishShticks,2010-05-06T19:56Z,"i agree. some of the songs on here on of horrible quality and hurt my ears. seriously, re-rip this shit at a constant 320 or something comparable cuz i can't bare to listen to this distorted shit. good attempt though."
,ktmp,2010-05-09T05:53Z,thanks. great stuff.

[T],PeteSapai,2010-07-09T15:27Z,"Yes, this very much still sounds like shit. (Why does SOM feel the need to release so much shitty quality?)   Quality release here:   http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5677952/We_Are_The_Fallen_-_Tear_The_World_Down-2010-VAG"
,ThilAP,2010-07-29T14:02Z,Why do people still download this? It really doesnt sound good. Go to Pete's url!
