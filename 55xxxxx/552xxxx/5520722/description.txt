This is sourced from VHS. I actually got this from here and just made the audio MUCH better. I doubt a better copy of this will ever be seen unless there is an official release, someone feels like doing a better VHS transfer, or someone fixes this video up a bit. I don't really know anything about video editing so I stayed away from that. This hasn't been transcoded from the format I got it in so to keep the quality at least as good as it already is.

1. The video is untouched.
2. Audition was used for noise reduction, high-quality time stretching of the replacement music, and dubbing of the highest-quality copies of the songs I could find on top of the existing music.
3. VirtualDub was used to mux the 192Kbps MP3 audio in to the AVI.

Note: The reason this file is so much smaller than the source AVI is because the audio is MP3. The original audio was wave.
