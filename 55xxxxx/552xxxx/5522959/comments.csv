hulkslim is right. episode 19 - Charade - aired 23/4/2010. episode 20 - Sacrifice - aired 30/4/2010. The confusion arises from episode 11/12, which aired as a 2 hour special on 5/2/2010. So, in short, you're wrong.

Thanks for coming out."

The producers consider ""Absolute Justice"" two separately produced episodes. However, The CW broadcasted them as a single episode, and later packaged it as a single episode in the season nine DVD. Therefore, ""Absolute Justice"" is both the 185th and 186th episode produced, but only the 185th episode aired.

So you're both right."
