[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-02T17:30Z,Agreed and your welcome :P
,vache11,2010-05-03T01:08Z,"Nice choice, as usual :).  This isn't a criticism or anything, but do you really think making it 24/96 offers a noticeably quality improvement?  The 16/48 records you've ripped that I've downloaded sound great, even with ATH-AD700 headphones with a nice sound card.  Downloading a 300-500MB file is a lot more convenient than an 800MB+ one.  "
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-03T03:44Z,"personally i do think they sound better, mostly because they're quite loud, and the higher bit rate allows higher db with less distortion.

sorry if the torrents are above average in size, but i feel that vinyl needs to be recorded at that quality to get the best out of how it sounds"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-03T03:45Z,"**the other torrents were done with an inferior turntable, that didnt peak the db meters ever, so it wasnt needed."
,samtskins,2010-05-21T23:50Z,"You're a boss good sir.  I have three suggestions:

Derek and the Dominoes - Layla
Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack

I forgort the third, I'll get back to you.

We appreciate your work man! 10/10!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-22T09:11Z,"lol i just bought a layla 45 of ebay, but it turned out to be a radio edit, so none of that great piano bit at the end, i'll wait to get layla and other love songs. and i defently want to do the snf st, that record is in every record shop about 20 times lol, i could get it for a buck"
