"SECRETARY'S DAY"

Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim (John Krasinski) work on their 
first sales pitch together to Donna (guest star Amy 
Pietz), the manager of a local restaurant. But Michael 
(Golden Globe winner Steve Carell) keeps misreading the 
signals shes putting out. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn 
Wilson) encourages Kelly (Mindy Kaling) to try out for the 
minority training program.

Enjoy :)
