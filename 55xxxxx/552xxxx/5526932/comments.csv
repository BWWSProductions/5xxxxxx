But people, you've gotta SEED! Come on! SEED!"
,Jacobveng,2010-05-03T04:58Z,"I will be seeding a little bit later.
Also I am going to be uploading some more torrents once some trackers get fixed which is why some of mine are down."
,livetorrents,2010-05-03T13:51Z,Please seed. I would like to get this sometime today. Will continue seeding!
,livetorrents,2010-05-03T16:30Z,"Ey! Come on? What's the point of uploading if you're not seeding? I'll help you once I get 100%, I have 100mbit."
,livetorrents,2010-05-03T20:39Z,"Still nothing happening? 

Come on dude! I'll help once I've downloaded."
,livetorrents,2010-05-03T20:55Z,"Downloading from somewhere else. But it's named ""rest"" at the end. I think it's the same file, so I'll continue seeding here."
,livetorrents,2010-05-04T11:29Z,"Hey! Screw you people for not seeding. I've uploaded 5 GB the last few hours, and you're not seeding.

I'm the only fucking one seeding. I think I'll quit soon."
,Jacobveng,2010-07-03T04:32Z,Since this upload wasn't seeded enough. I am going to be uploading a pack with Mandriva Powerpack 2010. Sorry for the those who actually tried to seed.
