,EnemyDrone,2010-05-02T20:05Z,@issorg you fucking moron it is a screener..just a VHS screener def not a dvd screener
,KNIGHTWATCH903,2010-05-02T20:09Z,"@ issorg
You Cannot Stop The Hungry Lion. Spammer!!!"
,MP3Nova,2010-05-02T20:13Z,hahaha :D nice one issorg
,LH-oswald,2010-05-02T20:22Z,"thanks MP3Nova

@hey issorg i heard your girlfriend and your sister are one and the same...any truth to the rumour :)"
,tiss2,2010-05-02T21:21Z,"Sample tells a tale about a release that sucks, it's nowhere near dvdrip quality. 

Check the sample before download at least. "
,issorg,2010-05-02T22:49Z,hahaha....VHS screener...hahahaha....probabli sent for screening purposes on some fancy Festival...but got stolen...and then ripped via very professional hardware equipment....good work on a sample
,scorpion1979,2010-05-03T00:35Z,how do we check out the sample? never have figured this out 
,tapper101,2010-05-03T02:09Z,"1000 seeders and 10000 leechers haha, this is gonna take a while."
,WashingtonDC1911,2010-05-03T05:44Z,"Thanks, looks good on my HDTV. People should stop complaining about free stuff."
,Matt90977,2010-05-03T07:56Z,"not complaining, just informing....it looks like crap.  seen ts that are better and I hate ts.  waiting for something better.  It is free though so if you are desperate....."
,Matt90977,2010-05-03T08:16Z,"perhaps I should clarify. I have seen ts of other movies that looked better than this, not of this movie. furthermore, the quality of this is a step above that of a normal ts. I just want people to be aware that it is nowhere near dvd quality."
,Vu1kan,2010-05-03T08:36Z,A/V?  Anybody?
,WashingtonDC1911,2010-05-03T10:02Z,"@Matt90977

Thank you, your opinion has been noted, by the way no 700mb or 1gb file is anywhere close to DVD quality. And you have a right not to download TS if you 'HATE' it so much. Do have a nice day and don't crap on everything."
,AuRteam,2010-05-03T10:02Z,"To stop the complaining/bitching about this release, it is NOT DVD quality. Now, thats not to say its cam quality, not at all, its actually fairly  decent quality. Not sure where they got the DVDSCR part from, this has got to be a TS. If you want better quality, wait a week or two. For now, this is the best its going to get. Not that bad of quality even IMO, when the movie first came out the cams for it were atrociously bad. You guys need to stop whining, its a free movie and it looks fine, sounds fine, and hell, the movie isn't bad.

Audio-9
Video-7"
,Lucky13s,2010-05-03T10:25Z,"Dont you think its funny how when 1 person finally gets a release out, about 5-6 more people get it that day, but with slightly edited or compressed video?
Seriously, everyone else who just released this same movie on the same day within a few hours, most likely stole it from the first guy and just edited it and reposted it."

You sir, is a mother fucking retard."
,leprechaun25,2010-05-03T18:06Z,"Appears to be TS quality. Colors are washed out, it's blurry, and too dark. No idea how this is labeled DVDSCR.

V: 6
A: 8"
,fakroman,2010-05-03T20:10Z,have no sound at all...any suggestions?
,dudew8,2010-05-03T22:23Z,"this is free.

good job (Y)"
,Lucky13s,2010-05-03T22:32Z,"Still pretty bad, just wait for the DVD rip.

Seriously, when people say shit like:
A-9
V-7
""For A Cam""

Its fucking confusing. Just state the A/V we all want to hear, IS IT ANY GOOD?

Answer: No, in comparison to the version 'WE ALL WANT TO SEE (THE DVD RIP)'
Its still pretty bad:

A-6
V-5

Blurry, dark, bad coloring, annoying fuzzy black thinger on the bottom of the screen, the audio is improved since the last but still bad.

Cameras are always bad, no matter how high you rate the A/V and people will misinterperate this as a good quality. Just say it straight up, its a cam and its a shitty quality, wait for the dvdrip."
,codex66,2010-05-03T23:39Z,"FFS if its been done with a camera is not a screener, move the fuck on and stop miss labeling things."
,lokbrok,2010-05-04T00:34Z,"@Lucky13s

I luv you!

Couldn't agree more.  People are motherfucking idiots! For christs sake!"
,EliteBubba,2010-05-04T02:50Z,"Quality not all bad after I tweaked light and color a bit with ffdshow. Movie is pure religious bullcrap, though - evolve and move the fuck on already. Glad I didn't wait for better version. Thanx for sharing :)"
,mufuti9,2010-05-04T07:22Z,"HORRIBLE QUALITY

In the world of people watching CAMs and VHS screeners on their 15 inch pc monitors it might qualify as a V:8/A:6

In the real world this is a
V:4
A:5

however.

Not a DVDscr, not at all acceptable quality.

Have been told repeatedly the movie is crap though, full of unsubtle christian propaganda, so you might not care anyway."
,hydra679,2010-05-04T12:39Z,thx lucky13s. the uploader's a moron - he should clearly state in the heading it's a cam.
,MP3Nova,2010-05-04T15:45Z,"Fuck off and die, hydra679."
,T-Minus420,2010-05-04T23:32Z,First of all this screener has already been uploaded a skillion times.  And you have it labeled as DVDScreener.  At best this was a VHS Screener and from the other comments it sounds like it was actually a CAM.  So YOU fuck off and die and stop bullshitting people.  Just say what it really is and everyone will be happy and no one can complain.
,kinvore,2010-05-05T00:49Z,"mp3nova, you're a stupid cunt for not knowing how to categorize your upload.  ppl probably wouldn't care if you didn't try to deceive them.  this is NOT a dvd screener, fuck you for claiming it is.

i don't give a rat's ass if it's free or not, you're wasting time and bandwidth when you pull this shit."
,shifty420,2010-05-09T20:14Z,thanks to all the honest commentator's. and to anyone who says quit you're complainin because it's free. well ofcourse we are gonna complain if we download something that's mislabeled. obviously not a dvd screener so why the hell would the uploader say so. what do u get out of this mp3nova? there's a reason why you're not trusted or a vip. 
,blueblood95,2010-05-11T09:46Z,"Another deadshit who misleads downloaders.
"
,Matt90977,2010-05-16T23:20Z,"@WashingtonDC1911

What? You really are retarded.

Seriously, This is the best quality out at the time of this post, but it says it's a dvdscreener and it's clearly not dvd quality.  I'm simply informing my fellow downloaders.  Why should I be flamed for that?"
