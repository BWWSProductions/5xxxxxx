Was it from a 203 or 204 vehicle, as it makes a difference when burning..."

Thanks for the file man. 

I have a CLC200 Komressor with Command APS and Linguatronic. The sales guy told me it's the current system they sell in new Mercs (as of March 2012 but it was installed in March 2009 and the maps are old and out of date.

I'm a bit of a newbie at this though. I burnt the file to a DVR+R disc using the burn facility in Windows 7 and the Merc's Command APS system just says ""Unreadable Disc"". Any clues?

I really don't wanna pay Mercedes $500 for them to update the maps (rippoff!!) when according to the manual it should be just a matter of sticking the DVD in and letting it run for an hour wshilst it does it all automatically. You'd think the system would come with lifetime map upgrades for the hefty price they hit you for at the front end.

The manual says it will tell you if the info in the DVD is not compatible so I thought I'd give it a go. So anyhow, rather than saying ""Incompatible"" it's just saying ""unreadable"" so I'm sondering if I did something wrong in burning the disc. Should I not be using a DVD+R disc?
