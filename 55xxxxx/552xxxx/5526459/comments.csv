,oc3ddie,2010-05-02T11:06Z,"The file is in asf if you have VLC player you can watch the fight, like I mentioned before the quality is so so but watchable. "
,flexninja,2010-05-02T11:56Z,"Awesome, thanks homie, plays with almost every player. For some reason media player classic doesn't like it, and with the proper codecs, it does everything. but several players, including VLC and windows crappy media all played it great. Quality could be better, but you were the first. I will seed for a good while."
