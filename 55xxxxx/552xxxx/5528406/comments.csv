,jared1107,2010-05-03T06:41Z,"I love all these ""no RAR"" crybabies. For Christ's sake, your already getting your content for free and super fast, how about just getting a copy of WinRAR here at PB and dry your fkn eyes.

Thanks for the Up AiTB. It flew at a nice 1.4Mb/s DL speed. Use RAR, .avi, fuckin smoke signals, who cares. Thanks again.

Of course the show stunk anyway. I thought for their 150th Ep, they would have done better."
,imjoaquinu,2010-05-03T10:28Z,"Rars are unnecessary and discourage seeding.

Who wants to keep a rar after they've unpacked it? Therefore less seeding.

Not to mention the recent flood of fakes out there...you never know when you've wasted your time with a rar only to find out it's passworded and probably not the real thing anyway.

Sure we're getting our stuff for free, and if this is legit, then AiTB has done a great job - but that doesn't mean we can't make requests.

The show appeared to be an homage to playwrights like Samuel Beckett or Arthur Miller or something like that. But yeah, not as many proper jokes."

,vandergraaf100,2010-05-04T10:06Z,Thanks man! Dreadful episode but thanks for bothering! And what diffwerence does it make what your seeding? RARed or not just seed it!
,shayweis,2010-05-07T23:05Z,"the worst episode ever! so they finally figured that they could never be south park, and so they've decided to go and be as disguisting as possible. i am done with this show."
