I have played this in PS2 which is modded.... I have completed this game twice and has no issues at all.

Regarding playing in PC with the emulator - i am sorry as i have no idea about this."

,orchlon,2010-10-20T15:17Z,I have downloaded this and i tried to play in on PCSX2 The Famous Emulator. I've managed to get to the great chasm without any problems and then i couldn't play past it. This might be caused by PCSX2's lack of disk swapping capabilities. I've managed to get my hands on a save file beyond the icarus fight and i've played from there on the 2nd DVD. But there's a problem that happens only on PCSX2 and not on a real PS2. The black screen after the translators game freezes on reviving the phoenix and stabbing zeus with the blade of olimpus. What I'm saying is you will need a DVD9 version to play on PCSX2 and you can use this to play on a real ps2
