,comefly,2010-05-01T06:03Z,"@Stun thanks for the answer!

@iluvwarez ESD stands for Electronic Software Distribution"
,0vi,2010-05-01T12:26Z,"thx for this.

,mrpras,2010-05-01T16:35Z,so if it's just the trial with a keygen how about posting the keygen alone? Thanks!!
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-05-01T17:01Z,"@Blaccdove101 and everyone else here... Stop point leecher's to Adobe, its release for a reason, and NO its not faster at adobe because its capped to 1MB/s"
,tpiom,2010-05-01T19:42Z,"I can confirm that this works! 

Follow the instructions and you'll do fine ;)"
,tpiom,2010-05-01T19:43Z,"Forgot to tell you, it's the Final version too!"
,Dr-Greenthug,2010-05-01T19:53Z,"Why the hell did they made After Effect for 64 bits only ?!
Will there be a plugin for 32 bits systems?"
,dong6241,2010-05-01T23:47Z,wait how is this final version?? even pre-release version is 3 times larger than this
,TranceGuy,2010-05-02T02:28Z,"Although this is the final ESD, I would wait for the final DVD release to come out because there's more content coming. The Production Premium ESD is even larger than this at 7.17 GB."

,fanch,2010-05-02T12:10Z,"Just installed Photoshop, it works like a charm. Thanks a lot!!!"
,fanch,2010-05-02T12:13Z,"Twatboy, don't try to open the rar file, use the Mastercollection.exe file to open it instead."
,c10b10,2010-05-02T12:32Z,"Is this the trial download on Adobe's site?

Cause it lacks Acrobat, and that should be included in purchased DVD.

Also, the included keygen does not have and CS5 options."
,ettin,2010-05-02T22:03Z,"If you're wondering why this (the trial) is so small compared to the beta:

From adobes site:

Thank you for your interest in evaluating Adobe® Creative Suite® 5 Master Collection software. The trial version offers almost every feature of the product for you to test-drive.*

    * 64-bit OS required for Adobe After Effects® CS5 and Adobe Premiere® Pro CS5
    * The Adobe Acrobat® 9 Pro trial (Windows® only) is available separately* from the downloads page

From the trial FAQ:

*Adobe Acrobat® 9 Pro is not available as a trial for Mac OS. Adobe Encore® CS5 software is not available as a trial. Encore CS5 will be installed as part of the trial for Creative Suite 5 Production Premium and Master Collection but will not be available for use until you purchase. The trial versions of Adobe After Effects® CS5, Adobe Premiere® Pro CS5, and Soundbooth® CS5 software do not include some features that depend on software licensed from parties other than Adobe. For example, some codecs for encoding MPEG formats are available only with the full version of these products.

You are better off using the beta until the retail version comes out, otherwise you may encounter some technical difficulties. "

,alentz627,2010-06-10T15:29Z,"The Keygen works fine and Adobe says the serial is correct, but then after a few launches I am prompted to enter an Adobe ID.  After creating one it tells me that the serial number is invalid.  Please help!!"
,RDTorn,2011-01-28T14:58Z,"@stun: Thanks a lot men!!!...This is awesome!!..

Anti-virus will detect the keygen as a trojan..and at some point wont allow you to run it..

You can disable it or add an exception then you are good to go.."
