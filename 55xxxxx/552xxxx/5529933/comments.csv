,jgoodwin27,2010-05-05T07:34Z,"appears to be fine, adobe is up and running perfectly fine, not sure if the .exe put a virus on or anything though, seems to be clean."
,dcoryh192,2010-05-05T09:22Z,"Ran in sandboxie. All it does is just detect what adobe products are installed and copy over the amtlib.dll files. No changes to the hosts file. And the amtlib files are working for me.
Although i didn't run the installer on my actual windows. I just transfered the amtlibs from sandboxie to windows."
[T],DjAligator14,2010-05-06T11:41Z,For me it dosen't work from hosts to block it so that's why i search with amtlib.dll files. Photoshop it shows to me as extended and Illustrator it show as tryout but it close when i want to close it. You have some problems with the Suite you installed.

,jbtito1,2010-05-11T22:37Z,Didn't work for me.  Still getting prompted to enter a new serial number each time I start Photoshop.  I'm running a 64bit version.
[T],DjAligator14,2010-05-15T08:31Z,"No ideas because for me they work. Illustrator  it go into tryout but every program remains like it was. Photoshop is extended for me.

(Win 7 x64 ) "
,crashd5,2010-12-28T07:53Z,"It worked on one of my computers, but the other one is installed in non-default location (separate drive), the program didn't work automatically. I just made a duplicate of one of the folders (eg. Adobe Photoshop CS5) in the default location (win 7 64, c:\Program Files) and copies the exisiting amtlib.dll to that location. Ran the program, had to disable AVG, but it replaced the old amtlib.dll with a new one. Then copied that file to the folder for each adobe program you have. This is almost exactly how CS4 is cracked too. Thanks for making this."
