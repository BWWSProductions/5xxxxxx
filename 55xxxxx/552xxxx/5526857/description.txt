The resolution is 608x352 and the video quality is quite watchable in my opinion.

Series Info: The Smart Woman Survival Guide is a half-hour hybrid that is part lifestyle and part comedy. Lifting the â€˜Ironed Curtainâ€™ on a Martha Stewart Living-type show, the series takes place behind the scenes of a fictional lifestyle program called Smart Woman.

The series stars Tricia Braun as Lana Pearson, the demanding host of Smart Woman, and her trusty staff, Liz, played by Siobhan Murphy, Nat, played by Laura McLean and Brooke, played by Joanne Alderson. As the women attempt to navigate the challenges of their personal and professional lives, the audience is presented with tips, how-tos and information for todayâ€™s â€œsmart womanâ€.

These include real-life Olympians, Nobel Peace Prize nominees, celebrity chefs and New York Times bestselling authors.
