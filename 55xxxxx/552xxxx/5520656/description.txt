Through the course of Cursiveâ€™s sophomore full-length, listeners get to endure raging tempests, sermons that inquire more than they preach, and finally, a lull with the onset of a new season. With Tim Kasher on guitar/vocals; Matt Maginn on bass; Stephen Pederson on guitar, and Clint Schnase drumming, the Omaha-based band divides its songs into two acts: man vs. nature, and man vs. himself, straying from one-shot efforts on Such Blinding Stars for Starving Eyes and establishing a loosely based concept album. A lot of the songs on this release seem to harp on the idea of being frustrated with incomplete thoughts and, like many so-called emo bands, the inability to put together the right string of words to accurately describe a feeling. See â€œThe Rhyme Schemeâ€ and â€œThe Semantics of Sermon.â€ Though his voice is unbearably whiny at times, Kasherâ€™s lyrics are right on target and clever, showing hints of self-deprecating humor and offering apologies for the limitations of their chosen art form â€” the math rock/pop song structure â€” which becomes more pronounced in Cursiveâ€™s later releases. While Cursive incorporate many of the same devices that bands like Fugazi, Chavez, and Burning Airlines have used, The Storms of Early Summer is ultimately a great melodic rock album with angular rhythms and explosive guitar work that tells a story of confronting frustration and loss and asking what it takes to keep forging through oneâ€™s daily existence.
