,ig33ku,2010-05-10T21:13Z,Test comment.
,ig33ku,2010-05-10T21:14Z,"I have the corrected subs of the original. It took me a while to find the same subs as the this version sans the spelling mistakes and another 2 hrs synchronising the timings.

So to Rrince Subber please Bat your rice so that you'll have more enemy to QC your work."
,ig33ku,2010-05-10T21:28Z,Here is the torrent in case anyone wants it. Will seed for 1 week. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5550608
,karih1,2010-06-14T18:00Z,"god damn this is a big file. 


Hows the quality? I imagine its great and all but dang..4,3gb!"
,karih1,2010-06-14T18:01Z,also pls dont stop seeding! I havent seen this movie in 5 years! :D
,tkdb13,2010-06-17T04:22Z,"I think something's wrong with this torrent; I kept losing data when I tried to run it -- as in, it'd say I had (for instance) 100 MB completed, then it'd drop back down to 60 for no apparent reason. I never got more than 150 MB completed. Other torrents were fine, it was just this one that gave me trouble."
,LEVEL_99,2010-06-22T16:34Z,video is a lil blurry as compare to other video of this size
,vulbastick,2010-09-05T16:22Z,how do i access the japanese audio man? i hate dubs
,tomslayer92,2010-10-18T01:48Z,"so doeas anyone want to clear this up? is the VIDEO good quality, or doeas anyone actually have a torrent with good video, that isnt in 2 parts?

@ vulbastick if you'e using windows media player or vlc, just right click, click either audio, or something like that and choose the other track"
,typehydro,2011-02-06T16:57Z,Not worth the 4.29GBs or the Disk space.  This is an upscale from 480p and no where near the quality a 4.29gb download should be.
,turlis,2011-02-22T07:18Z,Poor subtitles and seemingly poor video quality as well for 4+gigs. Get another version.
,childproof,2011-05-14T14:37Z,Remember the power of the seed.
