,SC162,2010-05-03T20:39Z,"cant wait to watch this. one question for you slick, is there a difference between CBS coverage and speeds coverage? all the speed footage is crystal clear but for some reason every CBS race seems a little smokey and a little slower......and i just realised i never got around to giving that donation....my bad, onto it this week. thanks for all your work :)"

,Freitrain711,2011-01-02T07:46Z,"HI slicknick, i was wondering if it would be possible for you to make a single torrent or a couple torrents which have all or some of the rounds in each? just from 2010 will do.

Cheers!"
