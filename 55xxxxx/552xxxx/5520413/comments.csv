,Jenna_PT,2010-05-01T01:28Z,"I don't understand why this torrent is so slow.  It should be downloading @ at least 200 kb/s, like these torrents normally do, and considering the # of seeders, but yet I'm fluctuating between only 15 and 25 kb/s.  It just doesn't make sense!"
,Jenna_PT,2010-05-01T01:34Z,"These torrents from eztv are usually super fast and I usually have the show downloaded within a half an hour of starting the torrent.  At the rate of speed I'm downloading at right now I'm looking at 4 & 1/2 hours before it's finished.  Just wanted to throw that in there.  Again, this just doesn't make any sense!  What's going on out there people!?!"
,deablo13,2010-05-01T05:46Z,Don't know what u guys are talking about but mine downloaded at a mb a sec. Was done downloaded with in 8 mins.  you guys need to look at ur internet connection.  thanks for the upload 
,Jenna_PT,2010-05-01T07:29Z,"Wow, I don't know what's going on, but I have been downloading this torrent for like 6 hours now and it's only at 40%.  What the effff!!!  It's not my internet connection either...  Thanks for the tip though.

I checked out another popular s05e20 torrent, which is actually just a duplicate of this one, and people are saying the same thing; that it's downloading super slow.  Weird.

I download Supernatural from the same source every week and it's always fast.  This is so frustrating!!! "
