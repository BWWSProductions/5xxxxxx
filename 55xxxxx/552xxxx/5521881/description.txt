The origins of the PSILOCYBE music lie in death metal;
however, PSILO transcends its limits using their highly experimental
approach. The full-length debut album called "Psilosophy" has been
released in 2009 and made available for free download. So far,
reviewers described the music as "effective, extreme, solid and
intense death metal inspired by jazz and noise", "consistent and, at
the same time, surprising and intriguing record, where avant-garde is
served in a definitely extreme fashion".
