,samjoe88,2010-05-02T20:56Z,"It is a site of Active Duty/Retired U.S. Military, Law Enforcement and Veterans.  There are no topics even talking about people in the middle east.   There is talk about Obama making false promises and where Veterans make up 25% of the homeless population in America. 

jwhitt62 You are clearly cointelpro or a fool for name calling on a patriot site. "

[T],jwhitt62,2010-05-03T00:04Z,I'm probably a bigger supporter of the military than you are. I talked to a recruiter after 9-11 about joining but I was too old (almost 40). He suggested civilian employment.
