,G3MiNi,2010-05-31T08:32Z,"Was able to use the effects for 2 weeks (or so) in Vegas Pro 8.0c, but now the activation appears to have stopped working. When trying to insert any effect it comes up with the activation window saying that I am running the trial period and need to register.

Any help would be appreciated.

Running: Vegas Pro 8.0c (32-bit) on Vista 64"
,LordReserei,2010-06-01T02:36Z,"Hey, DeGun

Hope you can help me out. I downloaded this torrent a few weeks back and it worked like a charm. All of a sudden, I got the watermark as if it wasn't activated (like G3MiNi).

I uninstalled every plug-in, cleaned my registry, rebooted and now whenever I try to reinstall them the activation options are greyed out.

Was wondering if you knew of a fix for this because I can't find anything anywhere. =/


Sidenote: I'm also running Windows 7 32-bit and running the ""Activate(insert).exe"" as administrator like before when it worked. "
,LordReserei,2010-06-01T02:41Z,"Forget my previous comment, just re-installing the plugins fixed the watermark...looks like I didn't need to re-activate O.o o.O"
,G3MiNi,2010-06-01T05:18Z,"@DeGun ~ Thanks for your help. I am familiar with the Digital Insanity cracks, and selected to reg from another computer during activation. Is there something I need to do to prevent it from going online? I read through the JPG before installing the first time.  I tried uninstalling one of them and reinstalling it - same prob.

@LordReserei - did you uninstall them before you reinstalled?  Or did you just reinstall them right over the existing progs?"

,FeleoR,2010-06-08T20:51Z,"Hey DeGun

I also dwnlded this torrent a few weeks back and it worked no problems. I followed the instructions step by step at the time but now its like as tho it wasnt activated, like Lord Reserei's problem.  However i have tried cleaning my registry out with your ashampoo optimizer as well as using the windows unistall/reinstall feature.
I have tried reinstalling and uninstalling to no avail :/ I still have this watermark displayed in my sony vegas pro which was not their earlier when the activation worked.
plz could really use your help if possible"
,TAK2005,2010-06-10T12:26Z,"DeGun

,FeleoR,2010-06-12T20:54Z,"FeleoR --------> did you let it on the internet at any time ? or do you decide for sure what goes out and in in your firewall ?

Im not sure exactly but im prob sure it did connect to the net as i dont have a program that manages what is allowed to go through or not :/ 
rly appreciate u helping ^^"
,FeleoR,2010-06-18T13:37Z,DeGun : sigh still doesnt work even after unplugging :/

anyone know how to fix it? :("
,Kruki,2010-07-06T04:22Z,"Hey guys! Good news. For those of u who has problem about the effects expiration after 2 weeks or so, all u have to do is activate them individually. All the activation code are in the keygen provided. U will also need to use the ""DI video essentials 2 & 3"" after that, it will only ask u to register :) Hope this solves ur problem .. If this isn't clear, it says at the very bottom of the jpeg inst. file thou it isn't very clear. Remember, U will have to activate them individually, repeating the steps from 8-13 but different product name each time. Good luck! :)"
,Schnoobins,2010-07-20T18:55Z,"I activated and cracked it without any problems, 2 weeks later it said i had to register. I have been running trial for 4 weeks now, and I got watermarks. When i try to reinstall/reactivate the activation field is gray.. I tried cleaning my comp. nothing works.."
,eqwas,2010-10-06T01:14Z,"That has happened to me too, with the graying out. Is there a fix? The only fix that I know is to do a clean install of windows. I think there is a program that newblue uses has that updates the program so it greys the activation."
[V],DeGun,2010-11-05T16:28Z,"READ KRUKI COMMENTS PLEASE it is just above .... and it tells you what you need to know so why ask before reading ? 

doh . 

thx all for comments"

,ghost-buster,2011-01-15T17:38Z,"Thanks for the upload man!

Anyone got Video Essentials IV ?!?"
,SonyVegas9Guy,2011-02-11T03:02Z,"I'm having the greying out problem too.  What Kruki said is what I did when I initially installed the programs, but I still got the watermark after like 2 weeks. When I tried doing it again after deleting the files and uninstalling and restarting the activation button is always greyed out. HELP ME PLEASE!!!! "
,daneroverg,2011-02-25T08:18Z,didnt download the packs but i got ur keygen. worked with my preinstalled newblue and now the watermark's off. thanks a bunch!
,zinjanthropus,2011-02-26T23:02Z,"DeGun - I am having a problem. Running Win 7 64-bit, with Sony Vegas v10 64-bit. After running each installer and then ""registering"" (using the keygen), everything is fine. Except for Video Essentials III; After install, when I go to start menu to run ""Manage Activation"", I click but it never opens. I can also browse their in an explorer window and click all three of the activation .exe's, but none of them ever open. I can't crack Vid Essentials III because of this. Tried reboot and even cold shut down and restart. 

Any ideas? Otherwise, awesome torrent, along with your others. Hope you can help me on this one glitch. Thanks in advance."

,zinjanthropus,2011-02-27T02:23Z,"FIXED!! 

I finally realized that if I just ran Vegas, and invoked VE III from the effects menu, I would get the ""Trial"" window... from there I was able to click on registration to get the registration window and then just proceed as usual. Thanks anyway, sorry for the four extra messages, lol. 

DeGun rocks."
,rodovsk,2011-03-28T23:33Z,"i tryied everything who was said above, nothing works.. if somebody post a guide how to fix the grey window i would aprecciate.

,4Flushed,2011-05-14T18:55Z,"I also had the problem of it losing the activation after 2 weeks.  I figured out that if I set the computer date back to the time before I installed it, the activation worked again.  A pain, but it works.  On another install I did, before I installed I set the date forward 5 years and then installed.  After installation I set the date back to the current date, and the activation has stayed for 3 months now.  Hope this helps."

,HsKDaMiAnz,2011-09-15T13:17Z,"Anyone with the EAccessviolation problem, it's due to your anti-virus.

You'll definitely have this problem if you use AVG.
Disabling AVG won't work either, AVG will still block it even though it's supposedly supposed to be disabled. Extremely irritating but it's still better to be safe than sorry, regardless.

What I'd did to surpass this was to use another laptop, reformat it so that everything was completely wiped and used the keygen on that."
,thelonerlee,2011-10-09T21:10Z,"The keygen doesn't seem to be able to open. I removed the access violation. I use AVG but I've added the keygens to excluded lists and other lists. I don't have the access error anymore. However,, the keygen just won't open. I double click it and nothing happens, nothing pops out. I checked the process list. The keygen is running, but I can't see anything. What's wrong?"
