The upcoming album arrives as the most anticipated 2010 rock release, so far.
The debut single from the 11 song disc, "Cryin' Like A Bitch," is already
blowing the doors off rock radio and the digital domain, furthering the Boston
Band's record-breaking streak at the coveted Active Rock format. The punishing
anthem, which debuted a mere three weeks ago as the most added new Active Rock
single of the year, has already blazed to the Top 5 tier of the chart. "Cryin'
Like A Bitch" is the 15th Top Five hit for the group, more than franchise
artists such as Linkin Park, Foo Fighters, and others. It also marks Godsmack's
record-breaking 18th Top 10 single of their career, extending their dominance as
creators of the most Top 10 hits in Active rock history. Produced by Dave
Fortman, who has worked with Mudvayne, Evanescence, and Simple Plan, among
others, The Oracle is another lyrical and musical touchstone for the four member
band. The new album revels in Godsmack's scorching underpinnings, served up via
frontman Sully Erna's monster-vocals on the scathing new single, "Cryin' Like A
Bitch," and other songs, including "Saints And Sinners," "War And Peace,"
"Devil's Swing," and "Good Day To Die." The Oracle is the band's first studio
album since 2006's Godsmack IV, another platinum-plus trailblazer for the group,
debuting at #1 on the Billboard Top albums chart (their 2nd #1 debut following
2003's Faceless) and harking back to the signature sound of multiplatinum
masterpieces like their 5 million selling breakthrough debut album and 2000's
AwakeConsidered one of the definitive alternative hard rock bands in
contemporary music, The band's 12 year legacy - guided by fearless founder and
frontman Sully Erna, includes nearly 15 million albums sold - highlighted by
scores of sold-out international concerts, countless successful tours, a
remarkable 18 hit singles, 4 platinum records, 1 gold EP and three Grammy
nominations.
