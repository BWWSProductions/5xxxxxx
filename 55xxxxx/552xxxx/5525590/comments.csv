There are two folders. One with the mix and one with the original tracks.

So you can choose in what way you would like to download.

Unfortunately I can not post a webplayer link to pre-listen this release, but you can visit my podcast site and pre-listen it over there. By visiting my podcast site and listening to my releases will also support me to get higher in the rankings, so if you like the work i`ve been doing for a long tome now, you can support me in that way. It gives also a bit of fun in return.

Enjoy all!!!"

[T],headdock,2010-05-02T14:27Z,"As promised.....from now on this will be the way i will upload my releases.

I hope you all will understand it is impossible for me to upload all the trance releases I get every day. I sort them out, mix them together and upload it on the net, but now you are able to get the original tracks also.

Check out my account here at the piratebay often to get up to date about trance music.

Have fun all!!"
