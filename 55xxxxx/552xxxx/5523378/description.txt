Naruto Shippuden : 'The Will Of Fire' Shikamaru's Vendetta for Asuma. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------


This Naruto's anime excerpt taken from Naruto Shippuden series 73>89 where
Asuma, Shikamaru's sensei met his death killed in the hands of Akatsuki's
duo Kakuzu and Hidan in the presence of the Shikamaru himself.
Shikamaru famous for his tactical ninja skill then organised and planned
a counterattack with the help of Kakashi, Chouji, Ino (Konoha's Team 10)
and also Naruto, Sakura, Sai and Yamato(Konoha,s Team 9).

This anime was actually an idea from my 3 sons who requested that I edit,
resample and reformat from avi. to quicktime mov. file thus allowing them to
transfer this anime to their Psp device. They seems happy with the result
and has been a big hit with their friends and peers.

I have also edited a few other samples taken from a earlier and later
Naruto Shippuden series but my favourite is still the anime edition whereby
Jiraiya, Naruto's Sensei met his death in the hands of Pain.
I renamed this edition 'Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant' of which I will upload
if this is a hit to all you demonoids and pirates.
