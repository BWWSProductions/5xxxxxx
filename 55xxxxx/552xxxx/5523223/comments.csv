,shasham,2010-06-19T17:12Z,You've just made my day - this looks priceless. Thanks so much! Cheers!
[T],frankie-boy,2010-06-26T09:01Z,"Thanks for missing my posts, jakebot. I have been investing my time in a private tracker. It enables me to get stuff I want and stuff I cannot get here on TPB, but requires I devote most of my bandwidth and time to it. 

Maybe someday, I can come back here and post some of what I have gotten there. The problem is that, without the structure of the private tracker, my posts are not reliably seeded, and I find myself having to reseed some of them often.

But some part of me does miss the wild hinterland of TPB..."
[T],frankie-boy,2010-07-26T23:09Z,"I retract my complaints about my torrents not getting seeded here on TPB. I see a lot of seeding going on, and I extend my thanks to those doing so. You are fantastic!"
,OrpheusDude,2010-09-13T13:17Z,"I can't thank you enough for the great films you've given us, but sad to say that a good number of the torrents are dead, or else people are not seeding.  For instance ""Women's Prison"" lists 3 seeders, but after downloading 62.9%, the one person who had been seeding (who was listed as having 100% of the film) dropped out of sight and I am stuck with a dead torrent.  Same situation with a number of other titles.  I hate to bother you, but can you please reseed at least this title?  I PROMISE to reseed to at least 2.00 IF I can get the complete film.  I do this with all torrents I successfully download.  Many thanks!"
,OrpheusDude,2010-09-13T14:48Z,"Well, something worked: the torrent suddenly jumped to life at a fast speed.  My faith is restored!  I will now reseed for the rest of the week or longer to get the ratio up to at least 2.0.  Thanks for the treasure trove of Noir!"
,OrpheusDude,2010-09-19T07:41Z,"Thanks again for this.  FYI: I seeded it to a ratio of 3.672.  Hopefully, other film noir fans will follow suit and keep this and all of your torrent alive and well!"
[T],frankie-boy,2011-01-15T09:23Z,"Thanks,OrpheusDude, for seeding. I am coming around to re-seed occasionally, but it isn;t going to work well without the community participating by seeding."
[T],frankie-boy,2011-12-03T19:04Z,Reseed by uploader completed December 2011. Please seed.
[T],frankie-boy,2012-03-11T07:30Z,"Thanks for your comments and enthusiasm, OrpheusDude!"
,moviemasterT3,2012-04-20T01:46Z,"I'm stuck at 35.9%, Please seed and I will do the same :)"
,moviemasterT3,2012-04-21T01:52Z,"Thanks for seeding, Good movie for a lazy afternoon. +1"
