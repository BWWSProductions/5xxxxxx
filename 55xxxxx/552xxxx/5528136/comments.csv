It's gonna be a pain in the a** to separate it into separate tracks. I wonder what program to use to separate flac files, as I've only edited mp3s before.

Thanks for the beautiful music non-the-less!

Muchissimas gracias sin embargo!"

If I burn this to a cd does the cue file add the tracks?
I don't wanna burn cds though. I play all my music from my computer or mobile."
