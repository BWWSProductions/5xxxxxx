Ineffable Mysteries from Shpongleland is the fourth studio album by Shpongle released on November 2, 2009. The albumâ€™s track list was released August 12 via Twisted Records (UK)â€˜s website. The album was leaked onto the internet in late October 2009. Songs from the album began to trickle to the public in live form, being played at many of Shpongleâ€™s 2009 concerts. Previews of the album were made available through Twisted Musicâ€™s official audio player. The album departs from the experimental, electronic-sounding nature of Nothing Lastsâ€¦ But Nothing Is Lost, and returns to a natural, World Music-influenced sound found evident in their first two albums.
