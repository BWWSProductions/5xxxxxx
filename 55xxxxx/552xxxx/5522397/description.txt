Founded in 1934 in Garfield, New Jersey, The Cadets are the second oldest continually operating drum and bugle corps next to the Racine Scouts (1927) and have one of the most extensive histories of any drum and bugle corps active today. They initially were sponsored by the Holy Name parish and were called the Holy Name Cadets. The Holy Name parish would not sponsor the corps in the 1958 American Legion Finals so the corps competed as the Garfield Cadets. The name of the corps was changed officially to the Garfield Cadets as Holy Name parish ceased their relationship with the corps. Many years later, the corps' name changed to Cadets of Bergen County and eventually simply to The Cadets.

They hold several distinctions, being one of the few charter corps of DCI who have attended every championship held, being the only World Class (formerly Division I) corps to step off on the right foot, as well as being the second most successful corps in the DCI circuit with nine world champion titles over three decades. The Cadets have moved their headquarters from Bergen County, New Jersey, to Allentown, PA, where the DCI Eastern Classic is held. The corps is known for unique and risky moves, such as using vocals throughout an entire show.
