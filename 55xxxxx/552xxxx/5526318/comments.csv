,AndreLinoge,2010-05-02T18:01Z,"thanks for all your handheld releases but the bitrate
u encode them to is overkill-big file.Any value beyond 1.2mbps wont be even noticed in those tiny lcds.


Keep em coming!"
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-02T22:05Z,"True.  But for those who use a video-out cable so they can watch them on a big screen ... basically turning their iPod into a portable movie player ... those few hundred kb make a big difference.

My baseline kbps is 1250, with a minimum rate of 500 and a maxrate of 1500 and a buffer of 786.  If I used simple DVDRips as sources, they'd often turn out at around 1Mbps, but since the sources I use often are 5+Mbps, FFmpeg tends to encode them on the higher side.

In reality though, for a file like this one, a bitrate closer to 1Mbps would only lower the file size by about 50-75MB MAX.  If you're that worried about file size, your problem isn't big files ... it's a nervous condition."
,romeox145,2010-05-03T00:37Z,HAHAH LOL nervous condition.  get em vov.  you put out good stuff.  Thank you very much for all your work.  No one should tell you to change a thing.
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-03T02:13Z,"I'm not worried.

There are about 150+ uploaders who release films in a low-bitrate format with file sizes ranging from 300-500mb.  Of those 150+, there are at least 25 that I would recommend.

There are about 50+ uploaders who release films in medium-range bitrates with file sizes ranging around 400-800mb.  Of those, I'd probably recommend 5 or so.

Of those who upload high-bitrate iPod / Zune / Handheld format movies, there are only a few of us and I'm probably the biggest uploader of this style of upload.

I'm not going to change the way I like to watch movies and therefore the way I convert them.  If people stop downloading my movies, then I'll just stop uploading them.  But I'll continue to keep converting them for myself in the format I prefer.


And if you're really looking for someone who uploads smaller files, but still good quality ... the best I can recommend is HolyRoses:

HR is kinda pre-occupied right now with finding a new job.  He hasn't uploaded anything new in the past few months.

But I'm sure he'll land on his feet and find something even better.  Just gotta weather the storm of this crappy economy for a while."
,Kashew13,2010-05-03T03:59Z,Thanks for all the great work! I was wondering if you could do Twilight: New Moon. I watch these on my ipod Touch and computer and the quality is awesome.
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-03T07:01Z,"Kashew13 >>

I'm already planning to up a 853x conversion of New Moon sometime this week.

So far, my planned uploads look like this:

Up to Bat: (Tonight)
 - Zombieland

On Deck:
 - The Red Baron
 - The Hurt Locker
 - Surrogates
 - Twilight / New Moon Pack

For New Moon, I'm going to use the same folder and file as my previous Twilight upload so those who are still seeding that one can just update their torrent file and can have half the torrent done already.

When I do upload it, if you don't want to download Twilight (again), you can just not select that file when adding it to your torrent client."
,EyeOfTheMuffin,2010-05-09T07:54Z,Bravo VoV!! I love your torrents ill continue to seed any of you torrents until my computer crashes!!
,RoguePraetorian,2010-05-13T21:55Z,"this maybe an odd request...I'm looking for a sound bite from this movie; where the glen martin (coffee buyer) say ""just put some more fucking blood in my coffee"".  i wanted to use this on my PC...any help??"
,RoguePraetorian,2010-05-31T04:36Z,ok...is this a fake site or is my question to dumb to respond to.  WTF.
