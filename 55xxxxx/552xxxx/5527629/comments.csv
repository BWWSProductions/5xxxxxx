[H],politux,2010-05-03T02:44Z,Thanks for this upload.  Did my FLAC upload of Through Being Cool yesterday inspire you? :)

[H],politux,2010-05-09T00:27Z,That's why I upload obscure stuff that I love from the 90's.  There are almost no torrents in FLAC for the bands I like so I make my own.  I lost my copy of Stay What You Are so your upload made my day.
