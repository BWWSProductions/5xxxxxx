,Hammer1974,2010-04-30T11:45Z,"SOME1 HELP PLEASE.
When I surf the net my internet is fine but when I download I am getting no more than 20kbps no matter what I download. I have ran a speed test and my speeds are what they should be 10mbps.
I have contacted my ISP and they say that there is no fault in my area."
,jake4now,2010-04-30T18:28Z,are you using utorrent? if so make sure your DL speed is at maximum.. and upload speed is at about 80% of what your line speed is.. and make sure the number of maximum connections per torrent is around 300-600 per torrent.. and global connections at about 1000. ihave a 10 mbps connection  and i DL at about 700kb-1.2 mbps with theses settings on my computer
,jake4now,2010-04-30T18:35Z,hammer1974..also if using utorrent check to see if your NAT is open.. should be a green checkmark at bottom of utorrent. if its not green checkmark than you might have to change you port so other people can connect to you and you to other people.
,TedLilly,2010-05-01T02:41Z,thanks for the up
,Hammer1974,2010-05-01T08:38Z,"jake4now,
Thank you. Yes I am using utorrent. I have a green tick at the bottom all the time. The following are my settings, MAX DOWNLOAD = 0 UPLOAD = 10, GLOBAL CONN = 2500, PEERS PER TORRENT = 1500. These are the setting I have always had but the past couple of days my downloads have been mega slow. An 350mb episode took 8hrs to download when last week it took just 20mins."
