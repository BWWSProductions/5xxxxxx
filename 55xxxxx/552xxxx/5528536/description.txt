Iron Man: Armored Adventures - Volume 4

114 - Panther's Prey
Iron Man is tracking an international thief named Moses Magnum right to AIMÃ·Ã• secret headquarters, but the Black Panther is after Magnum as well. Magnum stole something that belongs to the Panther, and the Panther aims to get it back, even if he has to go through Iron Man to do it. It is later revealed that Magnum had stolen Vibranium from Wakanda and killed the Panther's father in a revolt. The Panther eventually acknowledges that allowing other people to help him might be a better way to operate than keeping Wakanda's borders forever closed, as it might have saved his father's life if it had been done earlier, once Iron Man saves his life.

115 - Meltdwn
Tony is still flunking school and is placed in the lead role of Hamlet(which ironically the main character of which is in the same situation he is). He learns from a holographic will of his father that he wanted him to have a normal life rather than letting the company be a burden on him. However, a Maggia member becomes the Living Laser through use of an experimental vest stolen during a raid. Tony/Iron Man is able to stop him and remove the vest but it had a lasting effect on the Laser, whose body turned to pure energy and resolves to take down Iron Man.

116 - Fun WIth Lasers
Living Laser takes over a space satellite and threatens Earth. When Iron Man tries to stop him, he runs into Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. who inform Iron Man not to get involved. Iron Man flies to space to fight the Laser, but Fury gives him a 20-minute window in which to diffuse the situation before he sets a self-destruct in the station off in order to prevent the Laser from destroying New York. Iron Man eventually tricks the Laser into capturing himself and S.H.I.E.L.D. takes him into custody, Fury threatening to destroy Iron Man if he ever "does more harm than good."

117 - Chasing Ghosts
A hitÃ·Ã• been placed on Tony Stark, and the Ghost has come to collect. Tony canÃ·Ã– even see the invisible and untouchable Ghost coming... but heÃ·Ã• got a guardian angel, whether he likes it or not: Madame Masque. And while Madame Masque battles the Ghost to protect Tony, Tony finds himself pushing away Rhodey and Pepper to protect them. But when Masque is captured by the Ghost, Tony has to turn to the very friends he pushed away for help. Eventually, Whitney pays the ghost off to stop hunting Tony.
