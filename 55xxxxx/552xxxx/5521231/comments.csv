I installed it on one Vista machine with the same problem Burreman had, even after I rebooted twice.  I'll try the right click approach--thanks mrjblund.  Keep up the good work."

,Krine11,2010-07-12T17:27Z,"Never mind to my comment posted before, After you wait for a week the updates start working (I guess it needs time to get in effect)"
,Krine11,2010-07-17T03:18Z,"Lol, Well sorry to break it in again it updates successfully on the 12th of July now it comes back with Update is not consistent. I will really love if there is a actual remedy to it!"
,leotechsourcez,2010-08-22T22:38Z,"Great Work! 
So far everythings doing well! 
I successfully installed on 22AUG2010.
-----
Just want to add this for add'l info:
*Uncheck option ""Enabled Self-Defense"". Reboot your computer and apply the fix. (If still there is a message, go to Safe Mode [Reboot and press F8] and apply the fix there, it worked well for me.)
-----
Note: 
-If you want to keep Self-Defense ENABLED after applying the fix, trial will only reset on computer reboot.
-If you keep Self-Defense DISABLED trial will be reset once daily without rebooting the computer.
