,Wiltsu-boy,2010-05-02T17:10Z,Why CBGB:s rips are so big? And the resolution isnt even 720p...
,skate_1_boy,2010-05-02T20:35Z,Wiltsu-boy:: Quality! less compressed = bigger size = supernice quality!

,nielsydingsorensen,2010-05-05T21:29Z,I've been trying to DL this torrent for a couple of days now and I'm only at 35% and my speed is currently below 10kB/s. Are anybody else having these problems? It's like the speed on all my torrents are extremely slow.
,xerobacter,2010-05-08T01:18Z,The dl is slow because there is much more leechers than seeders. It's mathematic ;)
,daniloh,2010-05-09T06:13Z,"Very slowww!!!

avg 52,8kbps"
,xylolz,2010-05-15T21:11Z,thanks
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-07T18:01Z,"Wiltsu, this one is 720p, what are you rambling about?"
,caliwillbemine,2010-06-23T17:08Z,"Witsu seems to ignore the fact that movies aren't recorded in 16:9. And so it can never be 720 vertical lines. 
Why complaining about the size too ?
If you want crappy quality, go to the standard def category."
