One proof of this fact is that the trial download doesn't include Adobe Acrobat, which is part of Master Collection; you only receive that when you purchase Master Collection. 

From http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/trial/faq/:

""A trial version of Acrobat 9 Pro for Mac OS is currently not available. However, the full version of Acrobat 9 Pro for Mac OS is included in the full version of Master Collection available for purchase.""

My iMac was the first of my two computers where I installed it on. Therefore, this was the one where I made the fatal mistake of installing and using the programs before having added the necessary IP addresses to my hosts file. When I found this out I used the Adobe Installer to uninstall the programs, Appzapper to remove any remains and an app from Adobe called Adobe Creative Suite Cleanup to be absolutely sure that there was nothing left.

Even though, when having added the IP addresses before re-installing the programs, Adobe still wants me to Register :( So, I was hoping that you can help me with this problem? Maybe even let me know which file I have to remove that the uninstall programs obviously cannot find? It can't be that I have to format the entire computer to completely remove the files, can it?

,bronco3,2010-11-23T03:45Z,"Despite claims of the possibility to upgrade cs 5, this is not correct. InDesign will not work anymore... Photoshop seems to be okay. For the rest of the CS software, I do not know yet.

What should be the proper thing to do in this case?
If anyone has an answer, could you PLZ write me and tell me? paxlander@gmail.com 

Many THANX in advance!"

I used the serial on a copy I downloaded from Adobe, and it woks like a charm! Excellent.

I downloaded a trial from adobe, can anyone tell me if I can do this and how?"
,dljones,2011-07-20T16:53Z,"This did not come as a DMG file (as noted above); rather it downloaded as 59 files (also as noted above). I'm not a Mac person; I did this for my son, who is a Mac user. I have downloaded DMGs for him, so the format of these files (.r(xx) and .rar) leaves me wondering what to do with them. The individual files are 100 MB (mostly), but contain a DMG of >6 GB with RAR packing of different sizes for each file. Your advice would be most appreciated."
,ogge7,2011-09-24T15:23Z,"@dljones and anyone else. The .dmg-file is split up into 57 files due to if a part of the download gets corrupted, they only need to redownload the corrupted RAR and not the whole file.

Simply extract the contents of one of the rar-files to get the dmg. (Rar works like .zip-files)"

follow the steps described and it works like a charm!  Adobe doesn't bug me anymore."
,braymcd,2012-03-23T19:54Z,"The download and installation went quite well, but my Hosts file is locked and I have already tried unlocking it the usual way- all it says I can do is create a duplicate. Is there a way around this?"
