
The Dream Weaver is a hit solo album by one-time Spooky Tooth keyboard player Gary Wright released in June 1975.

The album was said by Wright to be the first-ever all-synthesiser/keyboard album - it features Wright on vocals and keyboards and Jim Keltner and Andy Newmark on drums. 

The only track to feature any guitar was "Power Of Love" which featured fellow labelmate Ronnie Montrose on electric guitar.
