Episode 11 - Smoke & Mirrors

Rebecca lands herself in hot water this week when Mr Griffith tells her that a continuous string of failing grades has put her place at Ainsbury in jeopardy. If she doesn't pull up her socks and change her academic fate, Agatha tells her that a decision by the Ghost Council will send all three of the Ainsworth sisters back to full time ghost status.
