,onealns,2010-05-05T06:33Z,"Thank you so much for uploading these. I just requested on EZTV that the River Monsters Season 1 be put up -- even put on there 'preferably TPB'

Any chance you read that and decided to put these up lol? I just posted that on EZTV like, the day before yesterday =p

Either way, thanks so much! only seen 1 out of the 3 episodes you have uploaded.

Upload the rest of season 1, get on it! =P I'll be seeding all the episodes you upload for a few weeks.

Thanks again."
