"To Surveil with Love"

A bomb squad mistakenly blows up Homer's unattended 
gym bag, releasing radiation into the city and 
authorities react by suspending civil liberties. 
Wiggum and his men install surveillance cameras 
around Springfield and round up suspected 
terrorists, including groundskeeper Willie, but 
when monitoring the nonstop flow of video imagery 
proves to be too much, Wiggum enlists concerned 
citizens to help keep the city safe. Meanwhile, 
Lisa becomes fed up with being blonde, so she 
dyes her hair a dark color.

Enjoy :)
