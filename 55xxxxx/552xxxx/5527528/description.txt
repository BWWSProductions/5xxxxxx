Microsoft Windows XP Pro Corporate Unattended



This is two unique versions of Windows XP in one. It is the Corporate Professional edition, which is the same as the XP Pro edition, just uses a different method of validation which is 100% patched and working (last time i used this cd was about a month ago, and was able to get updates from Microsoft :) and have been for the past two years)


And this is a unattended version, which means after you finish the xp setup screen in the very beginning where you chose your partitions and split them and all that jazz, thats it, next time you will need to do anything is when you are logging in to use the machine! Keyboard, timezone, and other setting auto config. 

So this is a great cd for a busy technician that is running around, customer loses cd key, you dont feel like explaining to them why they have to spend $100 on top of what you are charging them, here ya go.
