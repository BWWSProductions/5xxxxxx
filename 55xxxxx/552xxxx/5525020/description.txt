ISDN is a music album by experimental electronica artists The Future Sound of London which was released in two different versions in 1994 and 1995. The music on the album is edited together from various live broadcasts that the band had broadcast to radio stations all over the world using ISDN, which at the time was a relatively new technology.

Stylistically, the record features some of the ambient of their previous work, but brings in elements of hip-hop, trip-hop and acid jazz.1

The two released versions have different track listings and cover art. The limited edition, a 10,000-copy pressing released in December 1994, has a black cover. The later release, which first appeared in June 1995, has a white cover with black writing, and a different track listing.

The album contains numerous references to several films such as Repo Man in â€œEyes Pop â€“ Skin Explodes â€“ Everybody Deadâ€ is a line spoken by the character J. Frank Parnell, and the track â€œItâ€™s My Mind That Worksâ€ samples Miller saying â€œyou know how everybodyâ€™s into weirdness right nowâ€ and â€œitâ€™s all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.â€ There are also a samples from the sci-fi epic movie Aliens in the track â€œThe Far Out Son Of A Lung And The Ramblings Of A Madmanâ€, along with robotic sounds and laser-fire from the film â€œThe Black Holeâ€ in the track â€œJust a Fuckin Idiotâ€, and samples from films Escape From New York, Predator and The Exorcist II scattered throughout the record.
