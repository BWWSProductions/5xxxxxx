MGMT - Congatulations (2010)

Following their critically acclaimed debut, 'Congratulations' is the second studio album from Brooklyn duo MGMT. The distinctive electro-pop that yielded hits from 'Oracular Spectacular' has been traded for a psychedelic space-rock sound where influences from ex-Spacemen 3 producer Peter Kember are evident. In an attempt to encourage fans to experience the album as a whole, members Ben Goldwasser and Andrew Van Wyngarden refrained from releasing any singles from the set.
