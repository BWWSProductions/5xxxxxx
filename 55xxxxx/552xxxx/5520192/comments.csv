,GetTheMusic,2010-05-05T18:31Z,"This is the best movie I have ever seen! I saw it at the theater, but it's one of those movies that draws you in and you'll want to see a thousand times so thanks for the upload cause seeing over and over at the theater isn't in my budget.

This upload is as good as it's going to get till released on DVD.

Also, some things I noticed about this upload; credits are missing, a few cuss words in the film are muted, and the camera goes out of focus a lot because of so many action scenes with fast motions and quick lighting changes.

Audio: 9
Video: 8

Thanks again for this upload, it Kicks Ass

I'm going to buy this when it comes out on DVD, because I love it that much. Funny thing is, it'll be the first DVD I bought since the DVD Burner was first sold to the public in the 90's."

,kludge420,2010-05-06T13:42Z,"I love retards like tazyer30. It's his opinion on the quality of the movie you whiney little bitch. Go fuck yourself if you can't handle people having an opinion different than you dumbfuck. And the fact that you say, ""look at the screen shots"" show you are a complete fucking moron. Screenshots are notoriously useless. Anyone can make good screenshots even in a shitty rip.

Fuck off and die if you can't stand someone having opinions differing than you fucktard."

Video was pretty decent a bit dark but still pretty good for a release like this

Audio was of good quality, didn't have to turn up my volume."

You seem a bit thick, probably from years of cum guzzling, so let me explain it to you in simple terms and I'll type really slowly 'cause I know you can't read fast:

Attacking people that are using the comment section as it is intended is NOT the same as attacking that very same fucktard for misusing the comment section. Smacking the shit out of someone beating up a kid is not the same as beating up a kid. Dropping bags of urine on people who are dropping bags of urine on people is not the same thing, it's teaching them a lesson. Get it rentboy?

But thank you for showing what a total and complete fucking idiot you are weej2008. 

----

Not that I've pwnd that cum guzzling moron here is an HONEST review of the quality of this rip. Note that scores should ALWAYS be based on what a retail DVD/Blu-Ray would look like, not how good you think it is for a cam. That means nothing as it is a sliding scale; you might think cams look great while I think they look like shit.

Video: 5
Audio: 5
Movie: 6

Review:
The video is fuzzy, washed out, and there are several instances of people walking in front of camera. The sound is very flat and has virtually no dynamic range. All that being said it's still perfectly watchable and would score as fair to average for a cam in my opinion.

The movie itself is well directed, has good acting, and is nicely shot but if you've read the comics you pretty much know what's coming so there will be few surprises for you. I personally got bored halfway through so ended up watching it in two sittings."
