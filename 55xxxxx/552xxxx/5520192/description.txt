PrisM Notes::::::::::::
1stly thnx to lynks for fixing the angle once again. well had some right fun with this, encoded it ALOT of times, seriously this just been a pain the arse. programs kept crashing, then script kept failing etc etc, anyway finally! encoded it, changed colors quite much, reducing yellow, increasing cyan slightly and the red slightly, increased brightness and added some video denoise, added slight contrast, didn't want to add to much to it because in dark scenes it was really dark, so didnt add to much, so video was done then it was audio, crackman done the sync, but was in sync 1st half, but 2nd half kept going out, so i send
audio back to him for another resync, once again it was oos, etc anyway after trying it 200 times he reinstalled some shit and then resynced and now it is in sync just wonderful, so, any of you moaning fuckers bitch please just stfu and apreciate the work gone into it because it's been a right pain. movie compressed
really well, hence only 1.32gb, also sorry on delay really didn't want it to take this long so our apologies DVDR Will come soon.
