The most influential book by the world's most influential modern philosopher (a neo-Plato in many respects) and the man and book most responsible for shaping the world's culture as early as the era leading up to the first world war on through to our Kantian utopia of today. A complex attempt to attack reason with reason containing sentences that can go on for pages; this is a very interesting book to say the least.
