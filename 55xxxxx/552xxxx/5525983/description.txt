From wikipedia;

"Blake's first major film, Night Trips, was made in 1989, and was awarded the Silver Medal for the Non-Theatrical Release Category at the Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival. Andrew Blake holds the distinction of being the first adult director to win a film award at a mainstream international film festival."

Basically, it's the only adult film to have won a mainstream award.
