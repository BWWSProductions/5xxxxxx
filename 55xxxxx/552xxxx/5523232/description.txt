RE: Jimmy Swaggart - To Our Partners With Love (Snivlle Remastered Edition)

Hi brothers n' sisters.

Well, praise the Lord! If you love the old-time Gospel sound of Jimmy Swaggart and his Crusade team, this will be enticing to you. I've digitally remastered this rare, double-play LIVE album and have finally made available for everyone to enjoy. *smile*

Originally released in 1985, this rare, double LP set hasn't been available since 1988. This album was never "SOLD"; it was only available to donating ministry partners. I received a copy of this album from Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, years ago, on vinyl, but it got lost in the shuffle somewhere along the line. After searching on eBay, etc., for more than a year, I finally found an original cassette of this album that was still in excellent condition.

Many hours of careful audio remastering went into this "labour-of-love" project. High quality audio plugins (such as Waves zNoise) were used to achieve amazingly good results.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the only CD version of this rare, live album. I pray that it blesses you. This release includes CD covers (300 DPI jpg images) and the CD itself is a NERO CD Image file.

Sincerely,
Brother Charles (aka Snivlle)
