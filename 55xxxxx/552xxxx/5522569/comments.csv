,Cgoff87,2011-05-09T22:21Z,"""Super Best Friends"" is the fourth episode of the fifth season of the animated television series South Park, and the 68th episode of the series overall. It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 4, 2001.

The episode depicts several religious figures, including Muhammad, whose appearance at the time of the original airing caused little to no controversy. Following Islamists' death threats regarding Muhammad's portrayal in ""201"", as of December 15, 2010 neither the South Park Studios website nor Netflix stream ""Super Best Friends"". The episode has been replaced on the website with a notice: ""We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream this episode.""[1] The episode was also featured in syndication, but was removed after the threats.
