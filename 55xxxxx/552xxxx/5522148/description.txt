GÃ¶teborgsMusiken, since 2007 GÃ¶teborg Wind Orchestra.

At the end of 1996 GÃ¶teborgsMusiken (GÃ¶teborg Wind Orchestra) found itself in acute need of funding and was very close to extinction. It was decided that, should the threat become reality, a final sortie would be made with all coulors flying. Coulors in the form of a CD with the orchestra's own members as soloists.

In 1997 GÃ¶teborgsMusiken was commissioned to perform as the Band of the Royal Air Force. This commission ended 2009.
Today GÃ¶teborgsMusiken is financed by the City of Gothemburg and the Swedish Arts Council. Main sponsor is Gothemburg Tram Company.

On this album you will hear music by Leroy Anderson, the bands (at that time) conductor Jerker Johansson and some other composers. Tag info will display composer for each track.
