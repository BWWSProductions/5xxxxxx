Tales of Ephidrina is an ambient/techno album by electronica artists The Amorphous Androgynous, better known as Future Sound of London (FSOL), which was released in 1993. It was created from work the pair had been working on around the same time as their ambient Lifeforms work, while still containing some of the techno feel of â€œAcceleratorâ€.

This album was their first after signing with Virgin; they moved to London from Manchester and were given a free hand to do what they wanted. The album is unique, in that it is the only album they recorded in the 1990s not to be recorded at their Earthbeat studio, and is also the only release on the bandâ€™s short lived stem of Virgin Records, Quigley. It was the only electronic album to be recorded under the name Amorphous Androgynous, with the monikerâ€™s psychedelic reappearance in 2002.

The name Ephidrina refers to a form of Amphetamine.
