"
[V],thegoldman,2010-05-07T10:33Z," you can always add more information about your video torrents simply by opening your video file in Media Player Classic. Then Right Click -> Properties -> Details, then copy and paste an info like this:


03:28
Video: XVID 720x368 25.00fps [Stream 00]
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo 256Kbps [Stream 01]

Try to do it as it makes the people downloading the file aware as which type of file they are downloading... It helps..

thanks for the upload"
[V],thegoldman,2010-05-07T10:36Z,"As for the game,
Do you have these:

Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure (an adventure type game)
&
Red Line Racer (Bike Racing Game)

I have never found full versions of these games, maybe, they were not so popular... 

I last played both these games some 3-4 years ago...."
