This is the new music video from the Flobots featuring the lead singer of Rise Against, Tim McIlrath from their album "Survival Story". I really love this band and own their two newest albums (Fight With Tools and Survival Story), if you like the album, go get yourself a copy. Their Music is something completely new, with rap and rock vocals, politically-themed lyrics, violin, drums, guitar, and even trumpet occasionally, they create a completely new style of music.


From their site:
==============================================================================
When a pair of intelligent, visionary emcees joins forces with a battle-hardened, groove-fusing rhythm section, and a classically trained violist the result is a sound that explores and expands the frontiers of live hip-hop. Progressive in both style and message, the bandâ€™s ability to drop from symphonic rock-infused crescendos into stripped-down string-laden breakbeats has earned Flobots a reputation for both originality and authenticity.

Armed with musicianship, intelligence, and an ingrained sense of rebellion, Flobots are looking to engage a new musical culture, one mind at a time.

If you are thinking, you are winning.
