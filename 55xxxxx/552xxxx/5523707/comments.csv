,cclloyd,2010-05-01T21:40Z,"Wrong.  If you bought a mac, that means u spent every last penny u owned, and cant afford shit anymore."

For mac OS!"
,tedwu,2010-05-02T10:38Z,thanks so much for your upload this means a lot. I don't like cheaping off other people's invention however this will have to be until I could buy a copy of my own. Glad I don't own Mac. Ever since PC win 7 came out Mac became the last in line in my opinion. Unless you are new then Mac is for you. Their os ulterly is for newbie and lots of hardware capability issue. Good for nothing Apple only does it for their money scam not for the people. Look at iphone for example. Anyhow I don't wanna blog this board on irrlevence. Thanks again for your upload and I will seed as much as I can. Hope PC will get a chance in the industry too especially in printing industry instead of all Mac. Computer knowledge will spread and people will begain to understand I hope instead of foolish believe and noob Mac fan lovers.
