DOCman 1.5.7 FULL + Upgrade from 1.5.x to 1.5.7

DOCman is a document management solution for Joomla. DOCman makes offering downloadable documents on your Joomla site a breeze.

Manage documents across multiple categories and subcategories, give users permission to upload, download or edit documents. Store documents either locally or remotely and prevent direct linking using our build-in anti-leech system. All from within an intuitive and simple to use administration interface.


Main features:

* Nested categories. Documents can be organized across infinite categories and subcategories.

* Custom Groups. Documents can be owned by a specific registered user, a groups of registered users, all registered users or everybody.

* Powerful Permission System. Easily set default guest, frontend and document and creator permissions and fine-tuned permission on a document level. DOCman's permissions system gives you full control over who can access, edit, manage and download documents.

* Remote or Local Storage. Files can either be hosted locally or you can easily link to files stored on a remote server.

* Statistics. You can display a download counter per document. All downloads are also being logged (by user, IP, browser, date and hour) to give you full overview of what is happening with your documents.

* Integrated Search System. Documents can be searched by name and/or description. The search system integrates with Joomla! using an optional Plugin.

* Security. The built-in anti-leech system avoids direct linking to documents. Real paths to documents are never displayed to users.

* Flexible Themes. Change the look and feel of your documents repository using our flexible themeing system. Easily create your own themes to match the look and feel of you site.
