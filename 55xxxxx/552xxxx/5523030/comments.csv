I tried to install the folder 'com_docman'(v.1.5.7) but error message says there is no dml file.  There is an xml file, but it doesn't have the same name as the component (ie- com_docman.xml)  and seems to be incomplete, as it doesn'list all the files and folders used in the component.  I am wondering if you hav a proper xml file for this so I can use it? thank you again."
