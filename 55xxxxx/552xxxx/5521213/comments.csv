,PS3sacd,2011-07-06T06:11Z,"note to everyone it is now possible to make exact digital coppies of sacd's(exept without the copy protection)on a PS3 using sacd-ripper.pkg you can select to export a iso image of the whole disc or extract 2ch or multi ch tracks as dsd or dsf. I will upload sacd-ripper.pkg along with scarletbook(used to exract tracks from image) and instructions in the next day or so or you can visit here
