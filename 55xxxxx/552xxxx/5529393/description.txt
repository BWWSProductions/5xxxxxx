This torrent contains reversed audio tracks from "Tras Lunas" Mike Oldfield's album. 
Reversed means that they sound like usual track but being played from the end to the beginning. Know it sounds strange but the music is really magic and addictive and I hope you enjoy it as me.

All tracks are encoded as ogg vorbis files. 
Have fun! :)
