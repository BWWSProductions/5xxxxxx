These are the 4 mindblowing video lectures First Amendment Under Attack, Police Procedures and Privacy, Tactics of New World Order Agents and The Biblical View of Government where John Brownlee and Luther Trefz expose the various little known information on the new world order and its success in subverting America into a totalitarian state. Is the NWO trying to destroy some of the American laws and rights? Does it relate to the Declaration of Independence? What is the first amendment? Is it being violated today? What legal cases are involved? Are the police involved into illegal arrests and seizures? What are supreme court rulings on the right to worship? Recorded in 2001 in Southern Illinois Home Church, these fascinating lectures provide enough knowledge of legal cases and examples to convince anybody how deeply has America sunked into the abyss of totalitarianism as was witnessed in Soviet Union. 4 x 60 min. long. A must see for everyone.
