Tales of the Inexpressible is duo Shpongleâ€™s second album, and was released in 2001. Simon Posford and Raja Ram hone and expand the style introduced on their debut Are You Shpongled?. Raja Ram plays Spanish and East Asian instruments along with flute, and Simon Posford plays classical guitar as well as synthesizing and sampling.

The song whose name is most often stated as â€œRoom 23â€ appears on the back cover of the album with the name â€œRoom 2à¥â€, where the character â€œà¥â€ that partially looks like the digit â€œ3â€ is actually the Om, the sacred eternal sound in Hinduism.
