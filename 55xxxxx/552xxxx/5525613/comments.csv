,vincent570,2010-06-17T09:20Z,"Are these the downloads from the disk (Pirs Format) also I was wondering if this is the broken ""The Pitt"" or if it has fixed textures. Get back to me please."
,vincent570,2010-06-17T09:36Z,"Nevermind.... I Confirmed that this is indeed the fixed DLC thank you very much sir Great Upload.... I was sitting here playing off of a dlc i got on another website... and all the textures were fucked, yours fixed them :) happy happy"
,sigmareborn,2010-06-18T15:06Z,glad i could be of help :D
,fieryfire,2010-06-28T05:39Z,"hey sigmareborn,GR8 find on the unsigned dlc stuff.

CAN u please post in dlc for these discs to

Oblivion goty edition dlc
assassin creed 2(if there is dlc disc)
and 
could u post for any known dlc that can be transfered with ease through usb drive"
,silghenthill,2010-07-13T01:26Z,dude how do u get it on the xbox because I\'m having trouble with it i have a 2gb flash and i did every thing u said and it doesn\'t put the files on my xbox
,sigmareborn,2010-07-13T20:36Z,is it showing up on the usb when you go into your memory settings on the xbox? if not then the files arent on there properly
,silghenthill,2010-07-14T04:42Z,well you walk through says to make a file called content and i did and i put the file in there and my flash was all ready linked to my xbox and it said there was nothing in it and when i put it back to my computer it says the files were in there i dont know
,sigmareborn,2010-07-17T05:07Z,"if you have used the drive for previous transfers there should be a folder called content on your drive, thats the folder you want to stick the files in"
,dzxdzx,2010-07-17T18:44Z,"dude,how come they don\'t work on mine?:( i did the hdd manual transfer cause I only have a 1Gb flash drive and the configuring takes like 500 + mb so no more space for DLC. anyways, I think I put them all correctly. when I play the game, it says loading content but the downloads option doesn\'t glow. It does only after you finish the game. but then i put broken steel so shouldn\'t the last movie have a continuation thing? whenever the final movie ends then credits come. I always go back to the main menu and the downloads glow but when you load an unfinished savegame, it shuts out again.I try to roam around but no distress calls come in..  everything seems perfectly placed.  I even put the title update in the cache folder. help please:( bummer"
,sigmareborn,2010-07-19T00:16Z,"while the hard drive transfer is different (i myself have never done it that way) in theory it should be the same, under settings memory does the dlc show up in fallout 3's menu?"
,daba210,2010-07-23T21:57Z,"Hello, thanks for the upload is great, I put this onto my HDD via an external drive  ( have a JTAGGED console) however the DLC would appear to load in game (says ""loading extra content"") but then the 'Downloads' section is faded out, and my XP in game still shows as ""max"" but in loading screens it clearly shows I should be able to get to level 21, any ideas? Cheers. Daba."
,sigmareborn,2010-07-25T16:28Z,im asssuming you have loaded the title update to fallout 3 as well?
,LeakyTapsMan,2010-08-03T12:06Z,"Great torrent, works fine. If you are able to, could you possibly upload Dragon Age: Awakening? Its available on disc and therefore should be unsigned DLC. It would be much appreciated if possible."
,Flimzr,2010-09-02T19:46Z,"This DLC worked at 1st but then i reset my console and now it says loading up extra content but the downloads menu doesn't show up and I cant play it ingame, when I could before. Any help?"
,pipboi,2010-10-02T00:36Z,"I'm having the same problem as Filmzr. The Downloads section is greyed out initally, but then I beat the game, and after it takes me back to the title screen, downloads is highlighted, and I see all 5 DLC, but when I choose any of them, nothing happens?"
,lokostilll,2010-10-29T04:09Z,I was having same problem at first but then I updated game while signed on to Xbox Live.  Quests started activating one after another while playing.  Great Torrent......Thanx.
,leon814,2011-02-08T04:33Z,when ever i inject the 00000000000 file it get halfway then freezes
,leon814,2011-02-08T07:15Z,ok i figured it out it just took a while to load this worth the download saved me 40 dllar thanks
,163bty,2011-03-31T17:50Z,"They all downloaded fine except Point Lookout, it says it is corrupted data when I transfer it to my 360.  Your post says the file is 450mb but the file size is only 412mb.  Is it something I am doing wrong?"
,163bty,2011-03-31T18:43Z,"Never mind, I downloaded it a second time & it was fine."
,igifan,2011-08-17T03:10Z,fallout 3 walkthrough: http://www.gamestia.com/video/fallout-3-c16s1.html
,theyawa,2011-09-06T17:15Z,hey gay.  please... need seeders!
,theyawa,2011-09-07T23:38Z,"u say to make sure you have your usb drive configured for use with your 360

how I do it?"
,Camel-Case,2011-10-26T03:30Z,"Seed this NOW.
This is ridiculous. 

And will i get banned if im on a completely legit console, and have a completely legit fallout 3 disc.
Explain.
Thanks for upload, if only i could get the whole file."
,maliktwo,2012-06-07T23:43Z,"where do i get this xtaf thing at?
and also do i just put mothership zeta in the same folder as the others?
can i put them on my console seperatley if i have too small of a flash drive?
