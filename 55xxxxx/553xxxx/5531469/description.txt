The epic HBO miniseries Is now on TPB in an Ipod/Iphone friendly MP4 format!
The Band of Brothers miniseries details the real-life exploits of Easy Company during the Second World War over the course of ten episodes, starting with their jump training at the Currahee training site in Toccoa, Georgia and ending with the capitulation of Germany. The experiences of Major Richard Winters (1918â€“) are a primary focus, as he attempts to keep his men together and safe.
I didnâ€™t think there was enough seeded band of brothers torrents around, and none of them were fit for putting on an Ipod, so I made this torrent to share the hours of converting I did with you all. I hope you all enjoy it!

You can upload this torrent anywhere you want, but for godâ€™s sake at least give me some credit; it took me at least a day converting huge HD files to MPEG-4. 

Hope you enjoy my first torrent!
