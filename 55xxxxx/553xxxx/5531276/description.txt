Jimi Hendrix - The Man They Made God, BBC
--------------------------------------


As requested the BBC Documentary of Jimi Hendrix. 
The rise and fall of a guitar virtuoso.
This fascinating documentary examines both sides of an icon; the man whose lifestyle embodied the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll ethos of the '60s and '70s, but who privately was an insecure perfectionist who would record his vocals in a screened-off booth, so unsure was he of his voice.
