Plot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Limits of Control is the new movie from filmmaker Jim Jarmusch (Broken 
Flowers, Down by Law). The film is set in the striking and varied landscapes of 
contemporary Spain (both urban and otherwise). The location shoot there united 
the writer/director with acclaimed cinematographer Christopher Doyle (In the 
Mood for Love, Paranoid Park).

Isaach De BankolÃ© stars in the lead role for Mr. Jarmusch; this marks the duos 
fourth collaboration over nearly two decades, following Night on Earth, Ghost 
Dog: The Way of the Samurai, and Coffee and Cigarettes. The Limits of Control 
also features several other actors with whom Mr. Jarmusch has previously worked, 
including Alex Descas, John Hurt, Youki Kudoh, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton; 
and actors new to his films, including Hiam Abbass, Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal, Paz De 
La Huerta, Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©venin, and Luis Tosar.

The Limits of Control is the story of a mysterious loner (played by Mr. De 
BankolÃ©), a stranger, whose activities remain meticulously outside the law. He 
is in the process of completing a job, yet he trusts no one, and his objectives 
are not initially divulged.

His journey, paradoxically both intently focused and dreamlike, takes him not 
only across Spain but also through his own consciousness...
