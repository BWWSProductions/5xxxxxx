118 - Pepper, Interrupted
Pepper realizes if she wants to keep Tony as a friend, she has to learn to start liking Gene Khan. Which is really inconvenient for Gene, because heâ€™s busy trying to negotiate peace as the Mandarin between his Tong forces and the Maggia. And of course Pepper lands smack in the middle of it. Now Gene has to somehow save Pepper from Count Nefaria and the Black Knight, all while keeping his own secret from everyone. Solution? Call Iron Man.

119 - Technovore
The Technovore virus that Tony unleashed against Project Pegasus didn't burn out as intended. It has acquired the nanotechnology and is running loose in the Project Pegasus complex, assimilating any technology it can gets its hands on. Meanwhile, Nick Fury sends some S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents to bring Tony to repair the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier's engines. Rhodey goes to the Pegasus facility to check out a disturbance only to run into Technovore, when it gets a hold of Rhody's earpiece, it calls Tony so it can absorb the Iron Man armor. After the Pegasus scientist who was hiding in the building fled, Tony arrives. 

120 - World on Fire
The fourth Makluan Ring has been found, and when Tony, Rhodey and Pepper rush off to collect it, Gene is left behind. And while Gene tries to track down his â€˜friends,â€™ heâ€™s left alone with memories of his mother, the person who introduced him to his destinyâ€¦ his birthrightâ€¦ the Makluan Rings. Actually claiming that birthright isnâ€™t so easy though, which Tony is finding out first hand.

121 - Designed Only for Chaos
The Living Laser is dying, and Tony Stark is trying to save his life. But fate has other plans. The Ghost has been hired by AIM to 'steal' the Laser. When the Ghost comes Tony realizes that it was AIM who hired the ghost to kill him. AIM needs him to be a power source for their greatest creation, and when Iron Man arrives to rescue the Laser, he's too late. The Mental Organism Designed Only for Conquest is online.
