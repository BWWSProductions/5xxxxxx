,morph21,2011-12-07T19:24Z,"For those thinking it is overcomplicated, it is not.

There are problems with Lion and the wrappers, thus you need to upgrade your wrappers.

Just look here, at Porting Team's forums:
http://forum.portingteam.com/viewtopic.php?f=240&t=8279&p=72229#p72229

All information you need to upgrade your wrappers are there."
