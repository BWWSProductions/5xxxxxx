[V],Team_xRG,2010-05-05T13:50Z,nope u will find no extende bd rips until next year so stop asking..this year they are only releasing theratical editions! 
,timeforheroes24,2010-05-09T23:08Z,"Been waiting for this release for ages, I think the kingdom Release group are one of the only BRripper's to make blu-ray rips compatible with 360s n PS3s! Anyone know of any others??? 

Does anyone agree that its a joke the haven't released the extended editions straight away..........bunch of money grabbing swines make me feel comfortable downloading this without feeling guilty.

On a quality front, as usual great release, havent downloaded poor rip from this group yet!"
