Release Notes 
Source: DVDR [Thanks to a good friend!]This was given to us from a friend [Thanks Bro!],it was recorded on a home DVR and burnt to DVDR. As it was really good quality for a PPV and didn't see any of releases of this,we decided to go ahead and rip it. Did our usual work to the video. Has hard coded subs for non English parts. Should have a few more nice PPV's here in the very near future. Enjoy!
