IT DELETS TEMPORARY FILES...

THIS VERSION HAS A SMALL BUG, ON SOME PLATFORMS IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ONLY IF YOU SELECT TO DELETE COOKIES TOO, IT MIGHT GENERATE AN ERROR, DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT WRONG IT IS A BUG INTO THE BUILD ITSELF , THE ORIGINAL UNCRAKED DOES IT TOO , SO

GIVEN THE FACTS I PURPOSELY LEFT COOKIES UNTICKED...TICK THEM LIKE A TEST OPTION  

ALSO THE TEMPORARY FILES FROM HDD...DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT TAKES SOME TIME TO SEARCH FOR THEM, ARE ALSO LEFT UNTICKED..ALTHOUGH THE PRESETTINGS ARE MADE SUCH THAT IN CASE YOU TICK TO SEARCH FOR HDD TEMPORARY FILES...IT WILL SEARCH FOR ALL KINDS OF THEM... SO SIMPLY TICK "DISK DRIVERS" TO SEARCH ALL THE DRIVES AND WAIT TILL THE END



INSTALLATION INFO:

1) INSTALL


p.s. i do not resolve bugs from the producer...the current setttings (the default i choosed) will not report that...cause i left cookies unticked, i think it cannot deal with cookies unde use...they have to fix it on next build or version release
