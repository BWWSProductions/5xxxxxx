An amazingly tight 3-piece funk group from the Queensland, Australia.

Australia produces some amazing musicians and Thonk are making a name for themselves with their blend of instrumental fusion, blurring the lines between rock,jazz and funk.

A fantastic debut from the Brisbane based band. Melodic yet fiery with acoustic and electric elements fusing beautifully. One of the most original and talented bands in Australia today. "Thonk's brand of jazz funk and rock fusion guarantees all music lovers an inspiring and enjoyable night out, get up and dance or sit back and be amazed".

The band describe the album as "having a live feel about it and is not overly produced. Most of the tracking was done in single takes, with the exception of some guitar over dubs.".

One of our best sellers and very popular with the international market due to its fresh take on jazz-rock-funk. The  grooves are infectious and very listenable and has cross over potential - highly recommended to new fusion listeners.
