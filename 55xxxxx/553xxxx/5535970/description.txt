Howard's cloaked pulp character. Deathwatch's Michael J. Bassett directs from his own script, with Max von Sydow, Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Alice Krige, and Mackenzie Crook co-starring. ~ Jeremy Wheeler.

PrisM Notes::::::::::::
Well....V2 Because 1st release some people call a "glitch" which is just the video messing up, on the original source, if you have 1st release just fast forward couple mins and it's just fine, but anyway at the 1hour 3min mark theirs a glitch, so i cut it at 1hour 2mins 46seconds, to 1hour 4mins and some seconds and removed that video, so now their is no glitch, check it thoroughly, at the cut the audio goes off for 2seconds but theirs not talking nothing happening except rain, it's only 2seconds live with it :), anyway, same video as before, changed the colors slightly, cropped black borders and re sized the resolution, overall if you want to see this movie, it's this or retail Enjoy //prism
