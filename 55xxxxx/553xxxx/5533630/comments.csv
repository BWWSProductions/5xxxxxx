,bass_hit,2010-05-04T20:11Z,I was about to post this! Great first torrent. Keep up the good work!
,McSleavis,2010-05-04T22:47Z,"Glad it worked! I was worried. Didn't seem to add the PB tracker? Seems to be doing just fine now. I'll seed this for a few days just to add to the speed.

@bass_hit - Ha. I was working as fast as I could to be the first :}

@saperekler - I have always and will always support NIN/Trent. It's obvious this was knowingly let out and allowed to be distributed. I can't wait to buy the album in whatever incarnations it comes in.

Please support these awesome musicians as their work is released. Hope everyone enjoys it!"
,sucksucker,2010-05-05T16:16Z,"McSleavis, congrats on your first torrent.

No offense intended, but transcoding is generally bad"
,sucksucker,2010-05-05T16:36Z,But thanks for being first to post - you're awesome!

(Check out jaksta for recording streams)"
,McSleavis,2010-05-06T06:48Z,"@sucksucker - I'm well aware of transcoding issues. I do a fair amount of video graphics work and what not. Problem was that when using Audio Hijack, I had a time delay from starting the recording and hitting the play button. Likewise at the end of the song. I wanted it to be the original length. So I used Audacity (crappy, I know) to trim the ends which is where the transcoding came from. Wasn't sure of any other program to do just a simple cut and save. QT can but then saves as .mov files. Didn't think to use Soundtrack Pro. I was rushing to get the torrent up for everyone :]

Oh well. I seriously can't tell the difference between the two recordings using my KRK monitors connected with Toslink S/P-DIF cable. I highly doubt any audiophile will/could notice a difference. As good as your gonna get from an .flv streamed audio source.

Cheers!"
