Not very often, I get to actually say 'if you haven't seen this ...' and actually expect some of you to have NOT seen it yet -- something I really like. I pride myself on uploading films that are generally well known and therefore in demand, but occasionally, I find a lesser-known gem such as this one and I hope you'll take the chance and download it. In the case of this film, it REALLY deserves it.

Most of you know, either through history classes or because of Snoopy of Peanuts beleived he in fact was the man, but during the Great War, aka World War One, one of the greatest fighter pilots who ever lived terrorized the skies over Europe as a German pilot. A Prussian aristocrat by birth, Manfred von Richthofen was born into both nobility and a family of soldiers. His father was an Army Major, and at the age of eleven, he entered a military academy. By his early twenties, Franz Ferdinand had been assassinated by members of 'The Black Hand' and the world was pulled into a war.

Richthofen initially was a Cavalry Reconnaissance officer, but when the inventions of machine guns and barbed wire changed the nature of battle and the Uhlan Cavalry were forced into service as infantrymen, Richthofen applied for transfer to the Imperial German Army Air Service, which before the end of the war became known as LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte (precursor of WWII's Luftwaffe). His was a famed and illustrious career.

Don't be fooled by propaganda though. Richthofen was no stick-jockey. He became famous for three reasons: 1) his nobility, 2) his tactics, and 3) his cavalier attitude. Because of his nobility, it was easy for the Imperialistic German Empire to point to him as a shining example of a German soldier, an inspiration to all Germans. But his successes were not fueled by pure talent in the air, but by extremely wise and decisive tactics. Richthofen nearly always attacked from above, with the sun to his back with a squadron behind him protecting his rear and his flanks. His squadron was very successful because of these tactics.

At the time of his death, 'The Red Baron' had 80 official kills. Though only the last twenty or so confirmed kills were in the Fokker Dr. I triplane, the plane is basically synonymous with Richthofen. His nickname though, 'der Rote Baron' (The Red Baron) comes from the fact that Richthofen began painting his Albatross D. III (and later both the Albatross D. V and Fokker Dr. I) a bright red color.

This film tells the story that many of his friends and family have told since his death, but that his government-sponsored "official autobiography" (which was actually ghost-authored by a government paid author) did not tell. This film tells the story about how the young man who was eager and cavalier about war and thought of himself and his comrades as noble knights fighting valiantly in the skies had his eyes opened by a young nurse whom he fell in love with.

This film is both a war film and a romantic film, but neither theme is so strong it overpowers the other. In fact, the two genres are so well balanced, it's hard to describe the film as one or the other. Most of the trivia I know is about Richthofen himself, so I had to look up some 'film' trivia just so I could post some :D

Trivia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The film was almost entirely funded by a handful of wealthy individuals and not by a large studio, though the film was later distributed due to it's success by larger studios.
2. Val Kilmer was initially considered for the lead role, but was never offered the part. The film makers decided though he would have played the part excellently, he was just too old to play it in a historically accurate manner.
