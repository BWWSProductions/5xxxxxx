DISC 2: COLLECTORS RARITIES FEATURING URIAH HEEP AND DAVID BYRON'S ROUGH
DIAMOND

This amazing disc brings together all the surviving footage we could find
from the Byron era which is of releasable quality.  Sadly many of the
masters have long since disappeared so the source footage has been restored
to the best quality possible.  It is as good as we are ever likely to
have... but what footage it is!  Included on the collectors only disc is
the film which was shown at Wembley before the "High and Mighty" shows,
rare interviews from US and Australian television networks, previously
unreleased footage from an unaired US television show shot in 1972, the
best of the Japanese Budokan shows from March '73, film from one of Byron's
last gigs in Europe and all of the surviving promotional film of  Rough
Diamond.  How about that for a mouth-watering prospect?
