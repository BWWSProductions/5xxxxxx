"I Came to Haplin for the Waters"

Shaken by a grisly murder at the local pond and his 
father's bizarre, self-inflicted injury, Deputy 
Tommy Conroy reluctantly accepts the title of 
Sherriff bestowed on him by town matriarch Peggy 
Haplin. However Tommy's shocking discovery of Jerry 
Friddle's murderer forces him to keep yet another 
of the town's secrets with mixed emotions. 
Meanwhile, Henley appears to know a lot more about 
Haplin's dark side than she's letting on - drawing 
Merritt Grieves closer - but she's determined to 
get access to the forbidden third-floor room of the 
mysterious boarding house, no matter what it takes.

Enjoy :)
