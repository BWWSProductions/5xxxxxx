,critters30,2011-04-26T07:34Z,"Anyone know where I can get daemon tools lite 4.30.2 with sptd 1.56? I have tried several that say they are sptd 1.56, but when I install them, it has the latest sptd and so the game wont work. Tried several versions of daemon tools pro, alcohol, and power iso and none of those work either. The daemon tools lite 4.30.2 with sptd 1.78 does work with the first My Horse and me. My poor daughter is so frustrated, both of them worked fine until I had to reinstall windows due to a virus, now I can't get this to work."
,critters30,2011-04-26T12:55Z,"Oh and perplexedmind, almost all patches are seen as viruses. Game companies don't want you using them, they want to stop pirating ;) so they work with antivirus programmers to make sure you can't use them. I just added it to the ignore list in my antivirus control panel and everything is fine and the game will play now. I hate it when people scream ""virus"" without really looking at it. Noobish has never had an actual virus in any of his downloads that I have tried."
