Galway's greatest underground sensation: Giggleweed and Dream Master, unwittingly recorded in the livingroom of their hide-out... well, eventually they realise it, but Paul didn't when he came out with a sweet Classical tune.

Featuring a wonderfully improvised rendition of the folk song Whiskey in the Jar.

Including an exclusive 12 minute stoner interview: Giggleweed EXPOSED. (Warning: may contain subject-matter offensive to parents of teenagers, and inappropriate for small children)


So sit back, relax with your favourite tea ;) and let Giggle Weed and The Dream Master kidnap your ears for 2 hours.

Please seed at least 100% of what you download, as I have intermitting interwebs.
