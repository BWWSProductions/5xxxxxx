Plot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eric Bishop, a middle-aged postman working for the Manchester sorting office, is 
going through a dreadful crisis. For starters, his second life companion has not 
resurfaced although she was released from prison a few months ago. He is left 
alone with two stepsons to look after, which is no bed of roses since the two 
teens disrespect him and keep disobeying him. To make matters worse, Ryan, the 
older boy, fascinated by Zac, a dangerous gangster, has accepted to hide his gun 
in Eric's house. On the other hand, he is asked by Sam, his student daughter who 
has a newborn baby,to get back in touch with Lily, his separated wife. Now, Eric 
left her not long after she gave back to their daughter. As a result Eric 
panics... Having lost all his bearings, Eric Bishop soliloquizes face to the 
poster of his idol, another Eric, French footballer Eric Cantona, when the 
latter appears just like the genie out of Aladdin's lamp. Through a series of 
aphorisms peculiar to him, the footballer-philosopher will help remorse-ridden 
desperate Eric Bishop to get by.
