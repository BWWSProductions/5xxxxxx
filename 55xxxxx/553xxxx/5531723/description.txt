About this game:
Following the hectic, time-management style gameplay of the original Cake Mania, and the branching storyline of Cake Mania 2, Cake Mania: In The Mix! introduces all-new characters, motion-based mini-games and a unique co-op mode where cake baking heroine Jill Evans receives some much needed assistance. In Cake Mania: In The Mix! players use the Wii Remote to lead Jill through nine new bakeries filled with baking and frosting mania. Aspiring bakers control every aspect of the business, from serving cakes and advertising in the Dessert Daily newspaper, to running a catering business by phone.
