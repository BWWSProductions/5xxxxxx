,dhruv990,2010-06-02T08:47Z,"Sorry Uploader but this is one shitty torrent. 
Don't download this one. Downloading two files gave me a 105 Hash Fails, and what should've taken me 5 minutes took well over 30 minutes!!!
Fuck this shit, I'm not seeding this piece of crap. "

[V],protoyu,2011-02-23T16:47Z,"Why do people rip a CD in 320kbps, an audio CD is ALWAYS encoded in 128kbps. So its pretty much idiotic to increase the bitrate,DOES NOT EVER INCREASES THE QUALITY JUST THE FUCKIN' SIZE.
It's like converting a 3gp file to 1080p HD.

,malleryknox,2011-03-30T03:52Z,"It's baffling that people still complain when they're getting something for free. How about ""thanks for taking the time to upload!"" Ungrateful douchebag!"
,dagda88,2011-05-13T08:35Z,"Thanks, too bad we can't rip protoyu at 0kbps.  Sounds great."
