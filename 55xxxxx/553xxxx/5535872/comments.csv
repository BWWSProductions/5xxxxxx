,MooN_sHiNe88,2011-03-22T21:15Z,"Ok, I DL'ed the game and suffered from these 2 problems:
WINRAR had errors extracting the file
(So I used 7-zip = no problems!)

Then I got ""module intit error"".......

HOW TO FIX THIS:

Check the timestamp (Right-click then ""properties"" in WINDOWS) on the ""dvm.dll"" in main game directory - the CRACKED .dll that comes 

with this installation should be ""09 April 2010 14.04""
(NB: Other DLL file in the 7zip archive in games main folder is the original that comes with vanilla game - DONT TOUCH THAT! If you 

unzip and replace the other with THAT you'll start getting ""CD"" prompts)

Get this file:
Age.of.Pirates.2.City.of.Abandoned.Ships-RELOADED_CRACK_ONLY"
,VegasTK,2011-04-16T23:11Z,"Hey man...it don`t works...

It`s a bullshit...

Fu**...

It said "" Please insert DVD or ""Age of Pirates:City of Abandoned Ships""!


You Asshole!!!"
,Kumanix,2011-05-09T02:04Z,"Just extract the dvm.7z file.It will require the DVD.

Download the fake Image on Gamecopyworld(The DVD Image around 18MB,not the .exe file).

Mount it with a Virtual Drive Progam and play the game"

,Roscoe666,2011-06-10T20:16Z,"Just mount the 18 meg image:

Use 7zip to extract

if you get the module init error use the dvm in the supplied zip file.
