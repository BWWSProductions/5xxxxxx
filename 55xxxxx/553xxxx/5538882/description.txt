For his third Telarc Blues outing, bluesman Junior Wells lays out the welcome mat with an acoustic session of fourteen favorites. He sings, plays harmonica, and inspires the best from an array of guest guitar soloistsâ€”Tab Benoit, Corey Harris, Alvin â€œYoungbloodâ€ Hart, Sonny Landreth, Bob Margolin, John Mooney, Derek Trucksâ€”with a rhythm section comprising of drummer Herman Ernest III, pianist Jon Cleary and bassist Bob Sunda.

In Wellsâ€™ gritty vocals, his expert phrasing, and his harp-blowing performances, you can hear his dues-paying, blues entitlements. Born as Amos Blakemore in Memphis in 1934, Wells first learned the rudiments of blues harp form Junior Parker. Wells moved to Chicago on 1946 where he joined Louis and David Myers to form the Three Deuces (later changed the Three Aces, then just Aces when drummer Fred Below joined them in 1950). In 1952, Wells joined the Muddy Waters band and there gained wider notice. He began a long-time association with Buddy Guy in 1958. Together, they made the classic recording, Hoodoo Man Blues (Delmark, 1965) which gave Wells recognition outside of Chicago. Wells has continued to tour, record and perform from the 1970's to present.
Titling his new album, Come On In This House, recalls a tune Wells recorded for the Chief label many years ago and hints at the nature of the album's historic selections. Wells selected classic blues tunes by some of the best blues generatorsâ€”Robert Nighthawkâ€™s â€œIâ€™m Gonna Move to Kansas City,â€ Tampa Redâ€™s â€œKing Fish Blues,â€ Bobby Charlesâ€™ â€œWhy Are People Like That,â€ Junior Parkerâ€™s â€œMystery Trainâ€ and more.
This new, mostly acoustic endeavor augmented with stunning performances from his illustrious guitar friends can be claimed among his best work. Come On In This House is an exhilarating and fresh studio session that fuses the Delta sound with modern blues.
