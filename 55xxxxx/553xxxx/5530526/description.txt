SIN EPISODES EMERGENCE [INTEL CIDER] FIXED

You are John Blade, commander of HardCorps, an elite security force dedicated to protecting the people of Freeport City.
Four years have passed since your first battle with Elexis Sinclaire, a beautiful, brilliant, and ruthless scientist who is out to remake humanity according to her own twisted vision.
The law has failed to bring Elexis and her multi-billion dollar empire, SiNTEK, to justice, so Blade is determined to take matters into his own hands. Joining Blade on his mission are JC - a hacker with a secret to keep - and Jessica Cannon, a fiery rookie who can find her way into any secure facility.

Notes:
Fonts and crosshair have been fixed. All D3D effects are working.
The game has a very high difficulty level and even on easiest settings it is quite hard to beat.
To prevent frustation I have also included my savegames that have some cheats unlocked.
Several patches have been installed and a new "Arena Mode" has been added to the game which is quite nice if you want quick action.

Known Issues:
None.

REQUIREMENTS:
Mac OS version: OS X 10.4.11
Min. Processor: Intel Core Duo
Min RAM: 1024 MB
Video RAM: 64 MB
