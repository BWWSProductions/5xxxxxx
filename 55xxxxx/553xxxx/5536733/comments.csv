,spunkster,2012-01-02T20:50Z,"What the fuck is this? Where are the MP3s? There's one ""ACE"" file. What is an ACE file? Why do people have to upload weird, non-standard formats? Every single torrent I've downloaded in the past 5 years has been mp3, but this guy has to be a douche and reinvent the wheel."
,spunkster,2012-01-02T21:04Z,"I just figured it out. On Wikipedia: ""In computing, ACE is a proprietary data compression archive file format developed by Marcel Lemke, and later bought by e-merge GmbH. The peak of its popularity was 1999â€”2001"". This ACE torrent was uploaded in 2010. Why are you clinging onto a relic from a decade ago? I bet you're the type of guy that would open an beta-only video store today."
