A prank phone call becomes telephone terrorism when it leads to murder. The caller played by Jeff Strong (Walls in the City Glimmer Man) is a telephone salesman and sometime telemarketing "boiler room" thief. His false report of a positive HIV test administered at a clinic run by his sister played by Paula Killen (Mad Dog and Glory Walls in the City) leads a young woman played by Lara Phillips (Road to Perdition Kwik Stop) to kill her abusive stepfather. Her ne re-do-well boyfriend played by David Yow (vocalist for The Jesus Lizard) attempts to cash in on tabloid television's interest in the story. In a whirlwind of unintended consequences strange opportunities present themselves and a perverse redemption offers itself to the caller.System Requirements:Running Time 83 Mins.Format: DVD MOVIE Genre: DRAMA Rating: NR UPC: 690816600695 Manufacturer No: 166006
