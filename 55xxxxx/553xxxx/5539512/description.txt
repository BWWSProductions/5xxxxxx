NOTE: Last "Talk.Show.Pack". And yes - there is a great interest, savings on monthly basis could be immense.
There is one guy who releases some talk shows in very small sizes, little bigger than mine and definitely worse looking.
Such encodings can be played only on computers. [quark]s are more - versatile.

From time to time I have looked what going on with his torrents (he's not on TPB), puzzled by "Pack" unpopularity.
His torrent has 94 seeders after two hours and after 9 hours - 624 seeds.
I get two (2), three (3), four and up to 9. I am lucky when that happens.

So, you have saved even more. By cutting my "Pack" out.
