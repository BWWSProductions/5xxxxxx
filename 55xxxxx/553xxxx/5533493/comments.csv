,xiIix,2010-05-05T08:29Z,"Fuck, it's times like this I wish I chipped my box. This is in-fucking-sane. I remember back in the day when we could get DVD screeners like two months before it hit theaters, but this game is quite the vaporware legend, and I can't believe it's leaked this early - nay, here AT ALL. How long was this in the pipeline for, again? It took them forever to develop this, and I remember at first it was going to be for PC. I remember a demo they put on showing it running on a pre-fab quad to show the engines' support for multi-core processing. The one thing I remember most about that demo was the tornado, it was crazy. It was destroying/sucking up fences, cars and houses.

Then, out of nowhere, I check to see what's up with Alan Wake and all of the sudden it's an Xbox exclusive. I was pissed, but nonetheless it's here, and I'm definitely interested. Even if I do have to run it on my Xbox. Maybe it'll hit PC in a year or so. It'd be nice to see that engine hit the modding community."
,Oztheboss,2010-05-05T09:34Z,xiIix - it's pretty fucking nice :)
,samljer,2010-05-05T10:28Z,Playing this on a non-banned box is going to get it banned. playing any game before release is down right stupid as shit.
,Denzil,2010-05-05T11:36Z,"Yeah playing this game now is pretty much inviting Microsoft to ban you. A day or so? Maybe, some stores break the street date and they'd have to jump through some hoops to prove it's illegit.

But a week before release date, mere hours/days after it's leaked? Yeah you're going to get fucked."

,ganjacooliman,2010-05-07T15:48Z,"@mikels12
stealth check fails and its not able to patch it yet, so just burn it with img burn, if you want to play it now. 
you need a flashed 360 for every game you download."
,ganjacooliman,2010-05-07T16:01Z,"if you play it offline before the release.
then if you connect after the release without this game you get banned
i heard they can see something like save game date's or other stuff, don't now for sure. but i'll take that risk."
,wijie1993,2010-05-07T16:40Z,so it's cool if i play offline after release?
,ganjacooliman,2010-05-07T19:59Z,"@wijie1993

yes you can play it offline safe after release, for online you have to stealth patch it first, with acgx.  "
,Powerslave0,2010-05-08T04:18Z,"If you want to play off-line BEFORE the release date, and are on LT firmware; remove the LAN cable, and set your calendar to a date AFTER the release date; and of course, AGBX patch. You cannot plug back in to your internet connection till AFTER the release date."
,WhiteKnight841,2010-05-08T17:12Z,"The game loads and plays fine. A tip for anyone having trouble playing wave 4 games with older i xtreme firmare is to remove your consoles hard drive at the side and use a smaller 30mb memory card to save your games with. disconnecting the hard drive will skip ixtreme security checks and stop error messages that often say ""disc is unreadable"" and prevent you from loading the game. "
,bejace,2010-05-08T20:32Z,I'm hoping to see the CE disc on here at some point.
,cinogen,2010-05-09T01:04Z,"How can anyone be sure that this is not a review copy that MS has relevant data in.
This way, people will play it, no matter what abgx says, and they will ban you.

Isn't abgx updates and verifies from copies such as this?
This way it will verify this copy which MS knows about and will potentially cause bans!!

Am i wrong?"

,L4TERALUS,2010-05-27T21:06Z,"WORKS LIKE A CHARM!

for everyone that is unclear on what to do...

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. mod your xbox - of course you have to do this, no copied games will work without this step.

2. unzip the 40 files or whatever by using winzip or 7zip or whatever. (you have to unzip the ...part01.rar or the one that ends in rar if there are a bunch that dont end in rar)

3. now you have an iso and a .dvd file. use a program called abgx360 on the iso. (this makes the game stealth so you can play on xbox live without getting caught)

4. use a program like imgburn to write it on a DL DVD-R* (write at a slow speed to avoid errors) 

*DL DVD-R is important. it is a Dual Layer dvd. the game wont fit on a regular dvd-r


HOPE THIS HELPS"

Just run it through abgx360 for SSv2 and DMI like any other game. YES, you need to flash your Xbox before you can play this or ANY backup game.

,tauro202,2010-10-27T13:49Z,"TO ALL NOOBS!! If you have any question about any part of how to burn, patch or extract xbox games, or about modding the console why not google it. Even you tube has very helpful step by step guides. You can find out aeverything you need or want to know right on the spot. WHY THE FUCK annoy others filling up the the comment section with questions that have nothing to do with the game. The vids you will find on YouTube were made ESPECIALLY JUST FOR YOUUUUUUU!!!!! oh for you noobs thats www.google.com    and www.youtube.com     since you must not have known...."
