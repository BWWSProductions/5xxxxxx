Reviewers' comments:

FastWalker introduces a technology that is utilized by the intelligence community to duplicate the effects of real UFOs to assist in their ongoing program of deception and manipulation of society. There are many, many other surprises in FastWalker. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants a change of pace â€¦

Wonderfully amazing â€¦ "FastWalker" is the term the defense people use to classify those odd craft that occasionally are picked up by spy satellites. It's used in this book to describe a very strange object brought down by the government. Or did the aliens let the thing be captured? And are they really aliens from another planet?

An Air Force pilot has died in a strange accident over Dreamland, a secret base in Nevada. The President of the United States has not yet been briefed. Scientists from all over the world are being assembled inside Pyramid Base. The Manipulator is General Bushnell, head of a secret organization which has been trying to capture a flying saucer since the early days of the UFO mystery. Suave but utterly ruthless this cold warrior has every tool of high-tech wizardry at his fingertips and a crack team of skilled operatives under his control. The investigator is Peter Keller, a dedicated journalist with a lot to prove, struggling to keep his integrity in the sensational atmosphere of tabloid media. A flawed but gusty professional, he's ready to travel to the ends of the Earth to solve the mystery of UFO abductions. The victim is Rachel Rand, a young woman caught between the nightmarish alien beings who stalked her on a lonely Long Island road and a bizarre cult of UFO believers who are convinced that the end of the world is imminent. Can she trust the man she loves to help her discover the truth about her tormentors?

Now an unearthly craft has been secretly captured by the scientific team of General Bushnell. What it contains can indeed spell the end of human history as we know it. But are human beings ready for that knowledge? And who will control it?

First three pages of 'Analysis by Jack Sarfatti of the real UFO physics implied in Fastwalker':

I met Jacques Vallee in 1975 or so. He was on the periphery of the Physics Consciousness Research Group working with Ira Einhorni and came to several of our gatherings. Saul-Paul Sirag and I took him to Francis Ford Coppolaâ€™s house in 1976 with Uri Geller. Thatâ€™s how Jacques connected with Stephen Spielberg and became the
technical consultant to â€œClose Encounters of the Third Kind.â€ The character Francois Truffaut plays in the film is based on Vallee. Truffaut was working with another late friend of mine Jean Reisser Nadal. Some of that story is in â€œDestiny Matrix.â€ Valleeâ€™s sci-fi novel â€œFastwalkerâ€ with Mel Tormeâ€™s son, Tracy (of TV sci-fi â€œSlidersâ€ on parallel universes) is based on â€œfactâ€ very much like Esalen founder, Michael Murphyâ€™s novel about the Russian Psi Movement in the Cold War â€œAn End to Ordinary Historyâ€ is not really pure fiction. I lived in the apartment on Telegraph Hill on 2 Whiting Place that Michael describes as Jacob Atabetâ€™s abode. â€œAtabetâ€ is obvious code for Qabalistic â€œAleph-Baytâ€ alphabet soup. (Grin). Michael lived there before me and I got the place from him. Vallee and Torme describe the same kinds of phenomena in their novel that Eric Davis lists in his MUFON 2001 paper. Vallee today is a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who publicly claims he no longer does UFO research yet he, until recently at least, advised Las Vegas Real Estate Tycoon Robert Bigelow on the subject in Bigelowâ€™s NIDS project where Eric Davis had been working when he wrote the MUFON 2001 paper. Vallee continues to attend select meetings on UFOs and has been less than candid here. Here are some tantalizing snippets from the â€œnovelâ€ with my comments. Thanks to Robert Jones of the Caffe Trieste Irregulars who did the background research for me here on Valleeâ€™s essentially factual report thinly disguised as â€œscience-fiction.â€

MK-ULTRA at Cornell?

â€œMK-ULTRA had been approved by Allen Dulles â€¦ on April 13, 1953â€¦â€ P. 50

â€œThey signed up Cornell â€¦.â€ P. 50


I arrived at Cornell at age 17 on full scholarship arranged by Walter Breen who was working on a gifted children project under Professor William Sheldon of Columbia
University Psychology Department financed by Eugene Mc Dermott, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, with strong ties to US Intelligence from WWII. Phil Morrison, one of
the founders of SETI was my advisor. 

â€œAs early as April 9, 1952 you will find a memo that suggested looking at the influence of drugs on human paranormal abilities.â€ P. 52

Puharich in the Army working on psychedelics in early 50â€™s Dr. Andrija Puharich did that work for the Army at that time. I later met Puharich in 1974 during my involvement with Uri Geller as told by Martin Gardner in â€œMagic and Paraphysicsâ€, in â€œThe Star Gate Conspiracyâ€ by Picknett and Prince and in â€œDestiny Matrix.â€ Walter Breen attempted to induce paranormal powers in us kids (1954 â€“ 56), although no drugs were used. Agents allegedly from New Mexico who I met monitored his project. I also met CIA Chief of Station Harold Chipman in mid 80â€™s who was very much part of this project. Chipman wrote some of the episodes in the TV series â€œThe Enforcerâ€ based on his CIA career. He also wrote a treatment for a screen play â€œThe Unionâ€ about a rogue CIA group like Valleeâ€™s â€œAlintelâ€ using remote viewing against the Soviets. He was an important part of MK ULTRA going back to the fifties and had a hand in the SRI remote-viewing (RV) project of Puthoff and Targ with astronaut Edgar
Mitchell and Brendan O Regan. Police Commissioner Pat Price was a close associate of â€œChipâ€™sâ€ and Price was a â€œstarâ€ of the RV project along with Uri Geller and Ingo Swann.  Puthoff was not aware of Chipmanâ€™s role in what he was doing at the time.

Alien Intelligence

â€œAlintel â€¦ Alien Intelligence â€¦ Who would form a unit like that? â€¦ A president â€¦ designed Alintel as a black project: No records, no traces, no bureaucratic trails â€¦ The UFO phenomenon has turned out to be far more complex than anyone had dreamed.â€

â€œSo you believe itâ€™s real?â€

â€œOh we knew that from the start â€¦â€ P. 86

â€œWeâ€™re a rogue element â€¦ Newcomers are being brought in- military men, scientific types. Itâ€™s a shift in long-standing policy â€¦ The phone rang at the CIA, in the office of James Oâ€™ Grady, Ph.D., a thirty-five-year-old scientist who had been assigned the task of looking after all the bizarre, undocumented and unwanted data â€¦ he was assigned the job of â€˜Keeper of the Weirdâ€™â€¦â€ Pp.89 â€“ 90

â€œHow did your big stick impress the Soviets â€¦?â€

â€œAlintel showed them how the UFO material could be a source of immense energy, and could make the balance of power go tilt.â€ P. 92

Gorby caves in?

â€œWe think the Kremlin shift in policy towards America had something to do with the captured UFO hardwareâ€¦â€ P.93

â€œHe recited the Missionâ€™s purpose â€¦ To enhance the credibility of the extraterrestrial threat â€¦ to discredit those who might guess that we do not have ultimate control over the UFO situation; and to flush out any competition that might interfere with our action from within the Intelligence community. â€¦ Academia is a control system, too, but itâ€™s a closed one, and the rules are extremely strict. Their margin is nil. â€¦ The UFO phenomenon must be a part of Nature â€¦ Yes, but it is controlled by a non-human form of consciousness. Ergo, the study of it doesnâ€™t belong in science at all, it belongs in Intelligence. Meaning counter-espionageâ€ P. 97

â€œThe Air Force had initiated a massive study. A huge budget for the time. It was entrusted to the Battelle Memorial Institute. Then in 1953 â€¦ the CIA organized a
panel.â€ P. 109

â€œWe were a small part of a very big project that went all the way back to the fifties, when the military was collecting and analyzing foreign technology data.â€ P. 131.

Alluding to Dan Smithâ€™s, Laurance Rockefellerâ€™s and Robert Bigelowâ€™s funding of UFO projects:

â€œWhat matters is that influential people â€¦ folks with mansions and private jet helicopters â€¦ and billion dollar stock portfolios â€“ now realize that the phenomenon â€¦
impinges on their business on their ability to manage the planet â€¦â€ P. 144

â€œWhat the believers perceive as the Eschaton is really a planetary transition. Thatâ€™s what we need to manage. â€¦ Weâ€™re making a transition from being monkey-people to
something else. Thatâ€™s the real message. Weâ€™re managing an Apocalypse.â€ P.147
