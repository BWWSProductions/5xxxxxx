,dsgjsd2,2010-05-07T20:56Z,I loved the old one before the 666:ies episode but this one? They do have a better budget but the setup is more like CS. V vs 3th colon on a really bad multiplayer session on internet with only 3 on 3 with MW2 or what ever online FPS  and everybody is a camper on a a very large map. IE a lot of action going on....  I gonna ditch this abortion but many thanks for the share thought.
,ptv83,2010-05-11T04:00Z,"thankyou soo much for all your uploads.. love this, love ""dan for mayor"", loving ""hiccups"", .. trying so hard to like stargate universe.. but not soo much... dying for ""burn notice"" to come back.. mythbusters is always a classic... and that's all i watch... and you have them all.... FANTASTIC
.. the pirate bay better come up with something more than a arbitrary green skull for you.
.. i had to google what the dif between the colours was.. sure it's vip or trusted.. but those are the same thing.. , they need a better one for you. like a big bold ""SUPER"" , or ""UBER"" , or something better than this crap skull thing. .. even if they made you name in bold red and underlined.. the name is the most important thing.. more than the title."
,4ndymen,2010-05-16T19:34Z,Thanks guys!
,phy.lloyd,2010-05-19T12:30Z,eztv!! you really have all that i need! thanks! :D
