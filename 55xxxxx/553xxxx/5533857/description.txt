PLOT
James Purefoy stars as Solomon Kane, a wandering 16th century hero whose haunted past forces him to redeem himself by battling a growing evil in his homeland in this big-screen incarnation of Robert E. Howard's cloaked pulp character. Deathwatch's Michael J. Bassett directs from his own script, with Max von Sydow, Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Alice Krige, and Mackenzie Crook co-starring. ~ Jeremy Wheeler.

PrisM Notes::::::::::::
well watch this last night, great movie, cropped the black bars, their is still some subtitles, which appear on the picture, i did not crop them due to, they not really that noticable if your watching the film, and they're not to big either, added some brightness, and contrast, change colours just slightly, overall looks pretty good, also people seemed to have sync issues with previous releases by other groups after 1hour 3minute mark, this is in sync  Enjoy //prism
