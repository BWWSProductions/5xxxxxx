,DethBed,2010-05-22T18:46Z,the english subs are hilariously bad. Its almost as if someone just plugged the whole script of the movie into an online translator and didnt bother to check what came out. either that or they have an incomplete understanding of one or both of the languages.
,superleech,2010-05-22T20:50Z,Thnx Upper. Quality is not as bad as some whiners make it out to be. I would describe as excellent VHS quality. Sound is perfect except of course if you don't speak Chinese. In which case i suggest you use this subtitle file: http://subscene.com//s-dlpath-327496/82533/zip.zipx  The one that comes with the movie makes no sense whatsoever. Its like some sat there and made up what they thought was being said. Finally let me just say I have a new hero. I'm just discovering Ip Man. I watched part 1 last night so I can watch this part and I love it. 
,April.Swift,2010-05-22T21:29Z,Thank you so much great movie and thanks for the link to subtitle.
,4U_upload,2010-05-23T09:23Z,"*UPLOADER NOTES
I THINK THIS IS MISLABELED AS DVDRIP...SHOULD BE A DVDSCR...PLEASE COMMENT :)*
That's how I feel. It's a really good copy but something you want to replace for a better version, And the subtitles are wack! the translation are literal and inferential at the same time making the subs confusing. The English part of the movie are subbed pretty much wrong if not weird. Gonna wait for better version and better subs, but please download this movie because it is so good! it competes with the first movie unlike Ironman 2. lol"

You have a very good, Cam Capture I guess. When I watched it first, I thought it was a DVDRip, but hardly recognized it as a Cam Capture. keep up the good work,      raymondhome VIP. Thanks  to the SEEDERS and thanks a lot to you,  raymondhome"

I have no problem with AC3 when I run it through ConvertX which is what I do with everything that isn't already in NTSC.  Then I burn a DVD+RW and watch on my TV.  Takes a bit longer but I almost never have to worry about synch problems and I can take advantage of whatever subs I want.  BTW there is a BRrip that is in Cantonese with Mandarin subs. "

,DVDman09,2011-06-09T03:51Z,"I've downloaded all versions of this. 

In this one, the video is darker, and not as clear. 

The original English susbtitles included here are TOTALLY WRONG. They ran the Chinese characters through some translator program, and didn't check it with somebody who speaks English. 

The ""fixed"" English subtitles file ( http://subscene.com/english/Ip-Man-2-Legend-of-the-Grandmaster-2-Yip-Man-2-Chung-si-chuen-kei/subtitle-327496.aspx ) is decent enough.

The original movie was recorded in Cantonese. This video is overdubbed in Mandarin. The voices sound totally different from actors. And the voices sound overly dramatic and silly. 

For English speakers, I recommend you download this version in the original Cantonese, and use the English subtitles file that comes with it:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5648370/Ip.Man.2.2010.DVDRip.XviD-GiNJi(CANTO_AUDIO_ENG_SUB)"
,Carnage_Rampage,2011-07-15T03:27Z,"@cazmoney: For one, they must be in the same folder as the file you're playing them for.  Second, the subtitles must be named exactly like the title of the movie/show you're attempting to play.

Example:
This movie is titled Ip.Man.2.2010.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON.  So the subtitles must be titled Ip.Man.2.2010.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON.srt.  Meaning if you download another set of subtitles (and you SHOULD), then you will have to rename them exactly as the title of the movie.  Then it will be able to be picked up by your player.

Finally, you have make sure that you check subtitles ON in whatever player you're viewing your movie with.

Got it?"
,Carnage_Rampage,2011-07-15T03:29Z,"Wow...I'm that guy double posting.  Sorry.

I got my subtitles from http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3678194/yip-man-2-en

I've seen the movie quite a few times already, so I practically knew what they were saying, but...  The subtitles were amusing to say the least. lol  Took the seriousness away from the movie."
,xxxGangrelxxx,2011-08-09T17:54Z,"No subtitles are working. They are wAAAY out fo sync. Anyone got a solution? I have downloaded 3 different subs from diff places, and they won't sync up in VLC. It starts talking like 20 seconds before the scene comes up. Really annoying."
