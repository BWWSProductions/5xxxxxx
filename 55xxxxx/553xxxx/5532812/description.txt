        Dallas Campbell is set a free-diving challenge by Liz Bonnin 
        that leaves him gasping for air, and visits the Cern physics 
        laboratory in Switzerland to discover how the universe was   
        created. Dr Yan Wong shows shoppers how to burn steel, and   
        Jem Stansfield explains what horsepower is.
