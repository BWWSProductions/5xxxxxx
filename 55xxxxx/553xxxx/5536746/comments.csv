Is this complete, good quality, and free of junk?"

,EmrysMyr,2011-02-13T20:56Z,"...and now that I think of it, the album had a few different releases with different track listings each time. There must be about 6 or 7 tracks missing from this list."

The babylon CD included in this is the original release of babylon they had done. The re-released version in 2003 and 2004 included the following tracks which are missing:
Falling down
Start First
We Want
Firing the Love
Tears
The Beginning of Sorrows

Personally the only one I feel is worth looking for out of these missing tracks is We Want.
