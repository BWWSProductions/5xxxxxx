Various albums from the members of underground hip hop supergroup, Living Legends. Most are complete, but some I burned from my buddy and tracks were out of order, some had too few tracks and some had too many. All good stuff though.

Included albums:

Grouch & Eligh:
-G&E Music Vol. 1&2
-No More Greener Grasses
-Say G&E

ENJOY!
