      Chinese cookery show with chef Ching-He Huang. A pair of
      rugby players experiment with dishes centred around tofu. Ching
      cooks saucy beef tofu, oriental mushroom tofu in black bean
      sauce and lobster in hot garlic spinach sauce. It is then the
      turn of her two proteges to recreate her recipes.
