I went to a LOT of trouble to upload the best available quality for the ENTIRE concert from 18yrs ago!!
Star studded - Clapton, N Young, S Wonder, T Petty, T Chapman, etc, etc.
I started with 13 GIGs of vob files (4:3) - joined the vob's and re-authored to avi at 3.63 Gb - but it's 3h 11m 48s long and burns to ONE dvd!
Audio in synch throughout (unlike most other up's)
TOO MANY ppl to thank - but this is the BEST quality available for its age.
If you're a Dylan fan, you owe it to yourself to d/l this and SEED!!
Hope you enjoy.
