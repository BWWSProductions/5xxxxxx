Basic Spelling Tricks
There'sa game called Basic Spelling Tricks by a company called Dream Team, a subsidiary of Sierra. I played it when I was younger all the time.
My brother and I would spend hours playing it.
Sadly, the game runs at what I suspect is 320x240 resolution, but may be as large as 640x480 (gasp!) and 256 colors. The dll that has all of the resources is only 16-bit. I'm afraid that the game may not even work on Vista, it probably doesn't work on 64-bit systems either.
It was released in 1993, which explains its low graphics capabilities.


Needless to say, this game is WAY OLD and may or may not work on your system.  This is no fault of the ULer, so please, don't leave dirty remarks about not being able to use it because of screen resolution issues etc...
