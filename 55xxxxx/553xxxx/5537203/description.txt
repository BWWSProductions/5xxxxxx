Various albums from the members of underground hip hop supergroup, Living Legends. Most are complete, but some I burned from my buddy and tracks were out of order, some had too few tracks and some had too many. All good stuff though.

Included albums:

Grouch:
-Crusader For Justice
-Fuck The Dumb
-Making Perfect Sense
-Nothing Changes
-Show You The World
-Success Is Destiny


ENJOY!
