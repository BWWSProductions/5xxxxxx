There's no sequel for you!

Official Synopsis :

In the early 1970's, a remote mental institution next to the Russian border was shut down by the police. Before it was closed, Dr. Andersson made a series of snuff films using his patients. The doctor filmed all the murders in 8mm, and started to call himself 'The Auteur.' Thirty years later, an American film crew arrives in Finland to shoot a horror movie about the massacre, and are unaware that they are about to become the stars of their directorâ€™s real life snuff film. Instead of making a horror film, they are in one.
