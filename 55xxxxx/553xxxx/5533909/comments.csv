When you extract the files from the exe, then extract the biggest file again, and then scan the file res04~, or extract the file res04~ and scan the .CODE file both get a positive alert on virustotal.com. It works but not properly. the thing is, it modified the winlogon.exe, user32.dll. my antivirus say every time: modified system file."
