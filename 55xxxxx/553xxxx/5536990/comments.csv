,bps_73,2010-05-08T02:52Z,"Hey TvTeam, thanks for all the great ups, you guys put in a whole lot of effort, and there are a lotta peeps who appreciate it, so respect. Having said that though, you seem to have missed on a few nice ones lately. It'd be nice if you let us know if you'd had any issues, so maybe other like-minded peeps are able to help; after all, we're all here to share right?"
,MrArboc,2010-05-08T16:22Z,Been stuck at 99.9% for a while now. Just FYI...
,GoodOnya,2010-05-08T20:20Z,99.9% for me too.
,pjdes42,2010-05-09T12:16Z,Stuck at 99% as well.  Anyone have the full version to push us over the edge.  I promise to seed for at least a week!
,samgrey,2010-05-12T00:27Z,"99.9% for me, too.  Can we get a seeder back, please?  310 people are TRYING to download this one, so there's obviously plenty of interest!"
,Scriptwut,2010-05-12T11:55Z,"It is indeed stuck at 99.9% guys, but there is a way to fix it.

If you checkout the file size of the completed part you will come to realize that it's actually completed the .avi

Simply make a copy of the unfinished torrent and remove the .!ut

Apart from that small hiccup, biggups to ya TvTeam \o/"
,mrthiago14,2012-01-05T08:14Z,PLEASE SEED GUYS. I REALLY WANT TO WATCH THIS!
