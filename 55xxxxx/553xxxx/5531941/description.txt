If you haven't heard of this flick ... what rock have you been living under?  It only won 6 Academy Awards, including a little one called "Best Picture."  Chances are though ... you've at least heard of this film.  And if you haven't seen it, well ... I honestly can't say you 'SHOULD', because the fact is, the film is disturbing on a few levels, but still highly provocative and very, very well made.

For those not aware, the EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) troops are a special breed.  Generally, they do tend to be adrenaline junkies and have eccentric personality quirks.  In this film, this is especially true.  Jeremy Renner plays the leading role of an especially eccentric and adrenaline-addicted EOD specialist who fills in for the last month of a team's tour before the other two team members can go home.  Most will probably recognize him from North Country, 28 Weeks Later, and S.W.A.T., but if you've seen the film Dahmer where he portrays Jeffrey Dahmer himself, you know that Renner is a highly under-utilized actor with tremendous potential.  Hopefully this film will nab him some greater attention and further his career.

Personally, the first time I saw this film, I was so shocked I didn't really know how I felt about it, but at second glance, the film really tries to give an explanation as to why so many U.S. Soldiers are signing up for 3rd, 4th, and 5th tours of duty.  It's not entirely out of brotherhood, loyalty, and duty.  As the opening quote states, "the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."

Trivia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  As many of you already know, probably the biggest competition for "The Hurt Locker" in the Best Picture category at the Oscars was "Avatar", which was directed by James Cameron.  "The Hurt Locker" was directed by Kathryn Bigelow ... Cameron's ex-wife.  So ... it looks like she got the Oscar in the divorce ... not bad.
2.  Also, just to pour salt on the wound ... she took home "Best Director" as well.  At least he made billions worldwide.
3.  Adjusting for inflation, "The Hurt Locker" is the least money-making film of all time to win a "Best Picture" Oscar.
4.  Oddly enough, no trouble with the law or airport security occurred during filming in Jordan (a middle-eastern country right next to Iraq) despite the fact that a majority of the filming took place during the holy month of Ramadan and in order to eat during the sunlit hours of the day, non-muslim cast and crew had to hide indoors according to Muslim custom and Jordanian laws as Muslims are required to fast from sun-up to sun-down during this month.  However, when both leaving and re-entering the U.S., several cast and crew members were harrassed, detained, and even seriously questioned, though no charges were ever filed and no cause was ever given by U.S. Homeland Security.
