      The Ring. Saturn is one of the largest planets and the
      beautiful system of rings surrounding it makes it the most
      distinctive in the solar system. But how were the rings formed
      and what effect do Saturn's many moons have upon them? Sir
      Patrick Moore is joined by Professor Michele Dougherty and
      Professor Carl Murray, while Pete Lawrence and Paul Abel
      demonstrate the best way to observe Saturn during May.
