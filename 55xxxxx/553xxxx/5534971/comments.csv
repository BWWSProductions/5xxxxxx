,justshaw,2010-05-07T11:44Z,"This is a fake.
Ummm... i dont know if you guys posting are just the same person.. but yeh.

His name is fakeasdf...its his first up... and the episode is not even out on cnn site(biggest loser U.S site) duds."
,pixiesmiles,2010-05-08T15:11Z,"YAY for makeover week! :o)  I just finished downloading and watching this torrent. The file is complete, virus free,  and both the audio and video are good quality. Not sure what justshaw's problem is.  Maybe his mama forgot to kiss him night night or maybe he's constipated and grumpy or something?  :o)

Thank you fakeasdf, for sharing!"
,justshaw,2010-05-09T11:14Z,"maybe it had to do with your mother not kissing my ass before i went to bed? yes it was.

it had alot to do with the fact his name is ""fakeasdf"" very trustworthy name there really, almost as good as ihackyou1234.

and the fact that it wasn't hosted on cnn site, plus it's his first upload, and only ever upload of biggest loser, why woudlnt tvteam upload it? go figure i dont trust you either."
,fakeasdf,2010-05-12T08:32Z,Yer all welcome.  Firstly nobody get's an episode from a website when they rip it justshaw.  Secondly I didn't realize online handles had to be trustworthy.  I should have just made my name IAmAGoodUploaderIPromise.
