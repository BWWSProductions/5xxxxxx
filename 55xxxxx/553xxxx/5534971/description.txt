First, the remaining six contestants get $1,000 shopping sprees at their favorite stores before heading to the salon to meet celebrity hair stylist Jonathan Antin and begin their makeovers. Then itâ€™s time for amazing reveals and emotional surprise reunions, when the made-over players show off their incredible new looks to loved ones flown in to help them celebrate their big day. Later the contestants and their guests are treated to an unforgettable concert from recording artist Ashanti, who shares her inspirational music. This weekâ€™s challenge finds the players climbing Jacobâ€™s Ladder cardio machines while suspended over a pool, with the winner getting a weigh-in related prize. And finally, two contestants fall below the yellow line at weigh-in, leading to a very emotional elimination as another contestant is sent home.
