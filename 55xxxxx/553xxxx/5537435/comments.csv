I downloaded and installed this torrent and instead of opening Adobe Photoshop CS5 suddenly there was massive TCP activity on my computer and all of my Adobe software was invalidated. Just saying.
I recovered by re-imaging my C: drive using Ghost."
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-06T16:15Z,Sorry!! but this has no viruses and i am 100% damn sure.  So stop posting fake comments. It may be also due to any other reason.
,daotterone,2010-05-06T23:33Z,"Dear DibyaTPB, my post is not a fake. That was indeed what happened to my computer this morning with this download. I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge any other cause if that's the reason. However, after install of this portable on my XP SP3 machine, that's what happened. And that's all I'm saying. If you or anyone can bring to light some other factor(s) I'm willing to listen. I don't wish you or anyone any ill will. "
,Chocobear,2010-05-06T23:34Z,Perfect install in Win XP Sp3 .....thank you..DibyaTPB  
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-06T23:56Z,Hey daotterone have checked out your pc that it is free from virus m8? The thing that happened might be result of any other downloads of yours.
,Itorian,2010-05-07T09:44Z,"I took no chances, full virus scan and a reboot.
Works great, thank you so much.
Too bad the other CS5 apps aren't portable as well.
Hard not to be greedy. My "
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-07T09:48Z,you are welcome!

Cheers Dibya."
,CaptainJacSparrow,2010-05-11T12:14Z,And yes it is cs 5.  Check the digital signatures of any dll and the time stamp.
,Joshimuz,2010-05-13T21:12Z,"When I saw the 64MB download I had my doubts, but holy shit its real! Currently running it on Win 7, 64 bit OS and its working like a charm.

,dabu001,2010-06-29T13:23Z,"Thank you, works perfectly"
,phooeyF,2010-07-18T16:40Z,"hey DibyaTPB, forgive me for asking but what is the meaning of portable? does it mean that its only Photoshop without the rest of the components?
i stopped using photoshop and now have decided to start Psing again, i am looking for a stand alone photo shop with out bridge etc etc etc.......PLS help"
,worm3d,2010-07-18T20:55Z,"phooeyF: portable means no need to install and you can transfer it to any computer without reinstalling it or you can put it on usb and run it anywhere. Sadly it isnt completely OS independant, you need Windows to run it"
,worm3d,2010-07-18T20:58Z,"DibyaTPB: thanks for upload, seems perfect, i just cant drag&drop images. Does anyone have this problem / fix?"
,mootles88,2010-08-08T03:02Z,Can anyone upload Photoshop CS5 final x64 Portable please? This seems to be only x32 version.
,bmyles,2010-08-11T21:47Z,work great
,alexalex246,2010-08-17T18:06Z,This is certainly working right now and my PC hasn't exploded yet. Well done Dibya!
,_purple_,2010-08-26T14:27Z,DibyaTPB can you tell me what's wrong with: File -> Automate -> Photomerge? I get just an error message: Error 22: Window does not have a constructor... So this function won't work.
,_purple_,2010-08-26T14:27Z,My OS is Windows 7 x64. Should this be a problem?
,_purple_,2010-08-26T14:32Z,DibyaTPB can you please tell me what's wrong with File -> Automate -> Photomerge? I get an error message: Error 22: Window does not have a constructor. Line: 388... So this function doesn't work. My OS is Win 7 x64.
,1Nation,2010-09-25T19:48Z,"Actually, Installing a new adobe product may have caused something to check if your other adobe products were registered under same registration. If you got them from a torrent too then you might have some problems, Especially if you have a regular unportable copy of Photoshop cs5 already installed."
,Chano18,2010-09-29T00:20Z,"Worked fine for me, thanks"
,starlitewishes11,2010-11-13T00:46Z,"DibyaTPB, 

I just downloaded and extracted files, ran the exe file,  selected my language, and chose a destination to place it.  Whenever I try to run it now though, it tells me ""You are not allowed to write to the registry!! Continue anyway?""
When I click ok, nothing happens, although when I check what processes I have running, it is there in the background. I tried running as Admin but it tells me there is a configuration error, please uninstall and reinstall product, and if the prpblem persists to contact Adobe(which I'm pretty sure is not going to help any).  

I didn't really understand step #2 (Run Auto paf portable Installer) so I sort of skipped that, do you think that would be my problem?

I am running Win 7 64-bit"
,Carnage_Rampage,2010-12-03T02:08Z,"@starlitewishes11:
Same system as you.  Here's the trick, rather convenient or not.  When you first install it, go into Processes, then End Process on any Photoshop.  After that, you can open up PS again.  Seems like you just have to close out the process every time after installation if you want to reopen the program.

Whatever, works, and that's what's important.

Thanks for the upload, Dibs.  Will seed for a couple months, maybe more."
,adamcheek,2010-12-29T22:24Z,is this the full version???
,celticpath,2011-01-09T10:17Z,"I just downloaded and installed it, and I'm so excited!!!  It works perfectly! I totally concur with a comment that another user had. They wrote the same thing that I was thinking when I first came across this torrent:
     ""Joshimuz at 2010-05-13 21:12 CET:
When I saw the 64MB download I had my     doubts, but holy shit its real! Currently running it on Win 7, 64 bit OS and its working like a charm.""
I've been wanting this version since Adobe first started telling everyone about it.
Thank you SO much DibyaTPB!!! I'm very happy and satisfied with the torrent you provided. :) Now I've just gotta get me a Wacom tablet and It'll make it even more perfect! lol"
,celticpath,2011-01-09T10:19Z,The only thing I would say different than what Joshimuz said is that I'm running Windows XP Media Center Edition. :)
,yohtm,2011-01-17T18:36Z,"I've been trying to get Photoshop working on linux for a while, this worked perfectly!  Thanks!

If anyone's looking to do the same, follow the instructions from the following site but install this version of photoshop.
