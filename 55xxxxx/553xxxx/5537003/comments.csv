When downloading, I had just 1 seeder :( so instead, for future use,  it can be emailed from myself if needed.nnThat may seem a bit weird, but the torrent download could take a day at the current speed.  I don\'t want to have a PC turned on constantly for such a rare file to be download once a month :)nnIf the file is needed,  feel free to contact me atnnp e p p e r p a d c o n t a c t  AT yahoo . c o . u knn(obviously you need to type this without any of the spaces, and change the AT word to an @ character) - gotta be done or i\'ll end up with 400 emails a day lolnnHope that\'s ok with anybody else who is seeding/leeching  -  it just seemed to me to be a logical way to get around such a less used but rare and needed file.nn(leave a message if any other details are needed)nnMy email also allows access to Windows drivers,  and scanned manual pages."
