thanks for serving this file.
quite important to know: is this a REAL retail dvd or just from a bundle?

IDMX"
,IDMX,2010-05-06T20:07Z,"this file in either an altered retail or self-made disk.
be careful if you install this in a working environment!"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-05-06T20:08Z,"@IDMX, Hi

Yes its real retail"
,eckis,2010-05-06T20:39Z,"strange, it does not ask for a key and installation takes a very long time, seams something times out or what.
a retails behaves different"
,eckis,2010-05-07T14:44Z,"need to correct myself, it seems to be a regular retail version"
,ninline,2010-05-07T19:55Z,"OS X doesn't normally ask for a serial does it.  I've never seen it do so anyway.  Apple is, after all, a hardware company."
,mjones185,2010-05-09T04:17Z,"It does ask for SN and the two provided have already been black listed, they do not work."
,Sdraer,2010-06-10T13:05Z,"Thanks very much Stun,

I am trying to install on an i7 920 Gigabyte ex58 ud5 Hackintosh that was previously running normal OS X 10.6.3 vanilla.

I get to the install screen and tell it which mac drive to install to (the only 1, seagate 160gb on SATA).

The installer says:  Cannot continue, missing:
Essential Installation Files.

Thanks for any help guys!!"
,DaveGee123,2010-07-13T19:48Z,"This is NOT a clean disk image. It\'s been opened at some point, probably on a PC and is hacked up a bit. It may still work, but it is not a proper, clean image."
,hypno777,2010-08-02T13:05Z,has anyone tried this on virtualbox?
,kludge420,2010-09-11T10:39Z,"@ninline

If you don't know WTF you are talking about STFU. OS X Server DOES ask for a serial as does Pro Tools and all their other high end software. Just because you THINK something should be a way doen't mean it is... dumbass."

,fax88,2010-12-19T05:44Z,"Wow it's amazing how many people don't actually read and start commenting about serials. It says clearly SN:(inside NFO FILE)... If you cant even figure out how to put in the sn, then this software is probably beyond your scope.Thanks for the great up."
