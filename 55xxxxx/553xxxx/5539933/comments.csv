torrent -1
comments: -2

Please add some basic information when uploading torrents and if the poster does not it would be nice if the commentators provided the missing information.. rather than the whole, ""1st comment"", ""Behzad is a Fag"", ""Izlamic Virus"", ""dark alley"", ""..tampons"", ""got crabs? Suckers.."", ""hooker outside my apartment"", ""software for yer pc so if you download sumat"".. crap..

Thanks people you are all very helpfull.
Oh & i guess i should point out that i'm beeing sarcastic since i doubt most of the little brats at TPB would get it otherwise"
,mohiergauth,2012-05-03T08:25Z,"I realise this is an entire planetary crows here, but JESUS CHRIST on a keychain, can we TRY to conjugate properly in English. Seriously people? I participate on German Forums and use google translate (most of the time), and get comments about my German being better than most German People! TRY USING IT!"
