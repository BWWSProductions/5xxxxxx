IMAGiNE NOTES
Well wouldn't you know it, as soon as we do a TS of the losers a DVDSCR was dumped in our lap by our good friend MrFreestyle... Thanx bro
This turned out to be a very nice source so not much had been done other than a few tweaks here and there. Audio is nice crisp studio audio. Scanned through it and did not see any property of or anything like that, but i could have missed it.
