,kaarma33,2010-05-22T15:34Z,"Set 5 is taking me longer to get together.
As a bonus, ""an informal biography of $crooge McDuck"" will be included in this set.  It'll be ready for next week.

For Set 6, I'm still waiting for Dynabrite Daisy's Diary comic to get to me through the mail from last month. Hopefully, it's not lost in the mail. 

I was able to pick up an HP Scanjet 8250 that is quite speedy and does legal sized paper scans.

My local library carries the Carl Barks analysis book by Thomas Andrae, so I'll get that together for set 12.  

Set 9 will require some scanlation/photoshop work, so it will likely take me a month to complete just that set.

bye for now,

,kaarma33,2010-05-24T23:54Z,"I just found 40 Carl Barks German comic albums yesterday.  So, I'm sorting through them all.  So far, it looks like quite a few Set 10 WDCS issues can be scanlated with these German comics.  Also, I found some one pagers and at least 4 comics that could be updated.  I am debating with myself whether to update the German comics for set 5 or leave that for a later update, such as Rug Riders.  I have updated 2 one pagers for set 5 so far.
So, at least 2 more days just to sift through the German CB comics.  I have 9 more english comics from set 5 to check over. I'll get back to you this week."
