Set 8 Bonus:

4c0189 - Donald Duck, The Old Castle's Secret v2 CBDA

Gladstone's printers did a poor job for this issue, so I 
fixed up the original version of this comic.  The same
poor printing occurs for Gladstone's issues on Ghost of the
Grotto and No such Varmint.  I chose the Dynabrite version 
of No such Varmint for the CBDA as the best of three
versions.

Set 5 is now available!

*************

I am still putting together set 9-12.

I found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.
So, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,
then I can always copy and paste the english script 
into the italian comic.

Set 10 will have the fewest recent HQ comics, since
most of the comics were only reprinted in soft cover
graphic albums.  I have the WDSC graphic 
albums on hand, but I'm not willing to 
bend them all out of shape to scan.
Any suggestions?

a. Barks Bear book and updated scans
b. Unexpurgated Barks

mkv videos (Done)

has made these comics incompatible for updating comics.)

v. Don Rosa related stories


**********

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the un-cropped comics online.
Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent 
scans of wdc&s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.


The CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans 
than posted within this collection, then
please leave a message and post up your comic scans.

I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
