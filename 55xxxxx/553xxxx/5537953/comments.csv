,DecoySquad,2010-05-09T04:12Z,@zuriki it is just the movie mate at 1080 quality.
,pudd1educk,2010-05-19T08:17Z,"wow just took me 5 days to download this, and in my opinion is no better quality than my DVD version, no offence tho and thanks for the upload Ltt_01!! 

Audio -9
Video -9"
,SnapperNZ,2010-05-19T23:59Z,It might have 1080 res but the quality simply has to be degraded to be just 8GB.
,sinvis,2010-08-21T10:16Z,"the movie has been shot so as to give it a world war look...some technicality about camera..angles...filters.....
hence it does not offer clarity what is expected of a blu ray...even 17gb versions are not up to mark
i dont know why they do that...imho i dont like it"
,jorge971,2010-10-24T23:58Z,"I don't know why people is complaining, the quality of the movie is great.

This is nowhere near DVD quality, it is  way much better.

I recommend downloading this movie

Thanks for the  upload "
