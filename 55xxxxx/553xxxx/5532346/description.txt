Ray Charles Anthology is the first compact disc to collect many of soul music icon Ray Charles' ABC-Paramount-era recordings. Allmusic considers it to be "the best single CD collection of Ray Charles' '60s and '70s ABC-Paramount material",[1] while Rhino Records, the issuing label, refers to it in the liner notes as "the compact disc edition of Ray Charles' Greatest Hits", alluding to the ABC-Paramount LP of the same name. It is one of the first CDs to be released by Rhino.

Charles, who retained the master rights (currently controlled by his estate since his June 2004 passing) to his ABC-Paramount recordings, supervised a remixing of the 20 songs on thls compilation especially for this recording with master sound engineer Steve Hoffman, while Rhino chairman Richard Foos helped select and sequence the tracks for the CD.

While the CD is culled entirely from Charles' ABC-Paramount recordings, his Atlantic Records period is represented by three live recordings of "What'd I Say", "I Got a Woman", and "Hallelujah I Love Her So" from the 1965 concert recording Ray Charles Live In Concert.

The album was repackaged with a new cover after the death of Ray Charles in June 2004.
