------------------------------------------

The Oracle, formerly known as Saints & Sinners, is the upcoming fifth studio album by American metal band Godsmack, scheduled for release on May 4, 2010.
 
The Oracle is the first Godsmack album to be produced by Dave Fortman, it also marks the first Godsmack studio album to be released since 2006s IV, a span of over four years between the fourth album and The Oracle marks the longest gap between studio albums in Godsmacks career.

In 1995, after spending nearly 25 years as a drummer in more than a dozen ill-fated bands, success as a music professional seemed not in the cards for Sully Erna.  
Yet Sully, who rose from the gutters of Lawrence, Massachusetts, decided to take one last shot at capturing his life long dream.
  
He founded the hard nosed, tough edged rock band Godsmack, and it all came together thanks to the commitments and multiple contributions of himself, bassist Robbie Merrill, guitarist Tony Rombola and drummer Tommy Stewart.  

Three years later, their prayers were answered when Universal Republic signed them to a multi album, major label, record deal. Within weeks, their self-titled debut CD was available in record stores.  

Godsmacks first single "Whatever" broke through the concrete wall of American popular music, quickly soaring to the No. 3 spot on the Billboard charts, where it remained for an incredible 
53 straight weeks.

Robbie Merrill is the Grammy nominated bassist for the multi-platinum rock band Godsmack. 

Shannon Larkin is the explosive drummer of the band Godsmack. His distinct approach to drumming and ballistic stage presence have made him a dominant force in arenas and in the studio.
