,DoubleVision,2010-05-07T12:10Z,don't download this if you want the cantonese version
,acinod,2010-05-08T10:56Z,Is this Cantonese or the dubbed Mandarin version? You can tell if their voice doesn't match with their mouth moving.
,giantballsack,2010-05-09T17:32Z,I have no idea why every uploader is uploading the cut version. Can any uploader upload a full uncut version (meaning the bottom part is not cut). Please do it for those chinese people. Thanks.
,dodobirdss,2010-06-12T08:37Z,ep6 - I think u will find mandarin is referred to as Chinese and Cantonese is referred to as Cantonese. Ask anyone whom is fluent in Chinese. So fail it is not. 
,JFried12,2011-05-28T01:31Z,Just what I was wanting. Accurate subtitles...great movie!
