[V],twentyforty,2010-05-05T19:12Z,"@Jon: It is good and funny action movie - and for change - I have finished watching right now. Because I like to throw my opinions, I would give this one ""thumbs up"" especially if my recommendation (not advice, more like a ""must"") has been taken seriously enough.
... and this one is not about weight-watchers-losers same as Eagle wasn't against the Shark in some mythological fight, when your comment probably misled people from fantastic movie away."
,lilars26,2010-05-05T20:12Z,"Thanks 2040.
I'm downloading it on
your recommendation."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-05T20:34Z,"@lilars: If you mean by that my saying ""It's good and funny action movie"" - you may interpret it as recommendation. ""Thumbs up"" sounds more like an opinion of someone who might be - wrong.
But, recommendation was about watching:

""do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).
For example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usually looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set."""
,lilars26,2010-05-05T20:52Z,"Okay,on your valued opinion.
I checked out the quality and it looks 
really good.IMHO
Thanks 20/40 and have a good evening."
