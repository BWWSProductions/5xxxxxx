The Dream Mixes

A side-project initiated by Jerome Froese, the series has a dance music slant and primarily consists of remixes of other TD material. TimeSquare is an exception to this as only two of its seven tracks are remixes.

The subtitle-less DM 4 could arguably be considered Jeromeâ€™s first solo album, as Edgar was not involved in the production, however almost all of the music is derived from Tangerine Dream music from as early as 1972.
