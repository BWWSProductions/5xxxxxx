          Abbey Road became one of the most successful Beatles albums ever. In the UK the album
          debuted straight at #1. Abbey Road spent its first 11 weeks in the UK charts at #1,  
          and then was knocked off just for 1 week to #2 by the Rolling Stones debuting at the 
          top with Let It Bleed. However, the following weekâ€”which was the week of             
          Christmasâ€”Abbey Road returned to the top for another 6 weeks, completing 17 weeks at 
          the top. In all it spent 92 weeks inside the UK Top 75, and 16 years later on 31     
          October 1987, when it was released for the first time on CD, it reached #30. In the  
          UK Abbey Road was the best-selling album of 1969 and the fourth best-selling of the  
          entire 1960s, and the eighth best-selling album of 1970.
