National Geographic Volcanic Ash Chaos Inside the Eruption PDTV Xvid AC3 MVGroup

Documentary charting the global impact of the 2010 eruption of an Icelandic volcano, which caused the greatest disruption to air travel since 9/11. The devastating eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull in mid-April brought mass disruption to skies over Europe, shutting down European airspace and stranding hundreds of thousands of air passengers around the world. As news crews frantically monitored the ash cloud's progress and reported on the repatriation of tourists and business travellers, a National Geographic Channel film crew was on the ground in Iceland. They witnessed and captured dramatic events unfolding at the scene before, during and after the two eruptions.
