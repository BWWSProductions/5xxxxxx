User Reviews
What a great idea for a solid romantic comedy: a girl, a professional dumper, dumps people for money and does not believe in love. You can guess the rest.

However, and it is a huge however, this doesn't just go with the genres' conventions it sets them back 10 years; honestly this could have been made in 1999 and you wouldn't have thought it fun then.

There is much that is fundamentally wrong here; it is full of the blandest of characters: particularly the female support, ditzy dumb blonde assistant who does a puppy impersonation when she wants attention, really? All that aside, it has some good lines on dating instructions, and if taking, molding, and changing the weak man into your weak man is your idea of romantic comedy, then go ahead: it's not offensive or offensively bad.

All in all visual wallpaper, nothing to make it sparkle: we wanted champagne and got warm flat root beer... dont forget to seed enjoy
