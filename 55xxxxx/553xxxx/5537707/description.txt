This movie started out strong, and it kinda threw me off for a second, but once I got back on track I actually enjoyed it. The mood and style of White Wall was refreshing, and I still have a hard time believing that this was a mini budget indie??. Pros - some loked out knife fighting scenes, and an interesting concept made it worthwhile. Cons - it's too artsy for it's genre, I normally appreciate this kinda stuff, but It was a little too avant-garde at times and it's great that there are people out there actually trying to break a few molds, but I wasn't expecting it. This isn't for everyone, but if you like dark movies with some action and a very Yoshiaki Kawajiri jap anime style to it then I say go for it or else don't bother. To sum it up, if you go in watching this in the right mood, you should thoroughly enjoy this or else save it for another time.
