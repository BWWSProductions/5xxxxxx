IMAGiNE NOTES
Right sources used.....audio ours, video ours, missing footage the losers cam dvdr diamond (thanks).
First off just to let you know there was 52 secs missing around the 29min mark so we had to do some cutting and pasting from the other cam video to fill in the blank ;-)
Video is a little dark but anymore brighter made some scenes have alot of glares so .....also colour changes throughout, sometimes looks bang on other times too much yellow or blue, but we have tried to correct this the best we could.
Audio just need to be synced to this .....bit of stretching and cutting and we got pretty close in the end so
