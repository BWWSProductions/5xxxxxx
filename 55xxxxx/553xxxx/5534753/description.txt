Hill is now engaging in a historic interview with Reverend James David Manning on May the 4th at 6:10, I will have 10 minutes to tell the callers how they should act plus the rules will be posted on this particular page. This will be a historic interview since Reverend James David Manning is taking a risk of his own life to set a mock court trial to 5press charges against Barack Hussein Obama for being recruited and working in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
