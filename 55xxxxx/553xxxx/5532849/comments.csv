,Mr_Root,2010-05-04T18:46Z,"Sorry, but this isn't a DVDRip. You can clearly see a time slider from a DVR in the beginning: http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/1264/70591207.png
The aspect ratio is wrong, too."

Open in VLAN player and set aspect ratio to 16:9 for a better picture.

,h64,2010-05-20T04:20Z,NOT THE DVD RIP THIS IS A CAM POINTED AT TELEVISION WITH LETTERBOXING ADDED
,addict9009,2010-05-20T21:21Z,had to give it a minus . worth it if you want to watch it tho. 
,DalaiLama83,2010-05-24T11:58Z,"DonÂ´t ""borrow"" this movie!!! The quality is shit!"
,lotrman,2010-05-26T22:21Z,Crap quality
,LarryH,2010-06-23T06:10Z,"WARNING!!!  
DO NOT watch this movie unless you can tolerate obnoxious whining chicks.  I was begging ""PLEASE KILL THE BITCH"".  "
,Ross_Ross,2010-06-27T13:22Z,"Audio 8/10
Video 5/10

This is NOT a DVD rip. This is a camera pointed at a TV as you can see from the start it is on some recorded system and they hit play. It is watchable but not very good, aspect ratio is messed up too."
,nyzdp4,2010-07-08T20:08Z,"lousy quality, but kinda cool horror movie"
,maquisardi,2010-07-22T18:53Z,Quality is poor. 
,JusDrama23,2010-07-28T22:25Z,This had to be The sickest Movie EVER!. Fuckin Awesome Film though
,patientpaws,2010-08-06T02:09Z,People of Pirate Bay-- don't waste your time. This movie is of OK quality-- but the FILM itself is TERRIBLE. Honestly.. its not creative and the ending is terrible. I'm upset that I spent nearly an hour and a half watching this terrible film. I actually had to turn it off more than half an hour away from the ending because I simply couldn't watch it anymore. SO bad. I'll keep seeding for those of you who want to give it a try... but there are far better German films out there.
,patientpaws,2010-08-06T02:09Z,"A: 6 [very quiet]
