Wt i found best are autogk and handbreak. But they are not allow to differ the bit rate of AC3.
If u can pls tell me jus application, that u r using.

,abhikrit,2010-05-07T08:40Z,"hey team xrg! m really disappointed for few changes u made :(

u changed to avi :(
u changed to ac3 :(
low bitrate in ac3 sounds crappy dude...change it back to aac :("
,yesbos,2010-05-07T11:02Z,"tx xRG, although I dont know well on avs script, Some how managed did one. Final output z great.
But the prob z, it took more than 2h ( close to 3h) to full encoding process. Which I used earlier took less than 1h to same source, bt give small quality loss, due to overrate of AC3 audio.
For 2h 36min movie, target 1400mb
earlier - video bitrate - 864kb
audio - 384kb
when use MeGUI
video - 1052 kb
audio -192 kb
So, had little difference @ video when watch. 

By the way, AC3 @ 192kb has good quality, below that may worse. "
[V],Team_xRG,2010-05-07T13:35Z,"Ripping time depends on What Script u use
if u use normal script it will take 2-3 hrs
in my script it takes about 6-8 hrs"
[V],Team_xRG,2010-05-07T13:36Z,"@ yesbos i have done AC3 192kbps 5.1 its Better for 900MB 
AAC n AC3"
,yesbos,2010-05-07T16:22Z,"Tx xRG, i got it.
