           Widowed when his FBI agent wife is killed in an FBI    
           anti-terrorist operation gone wrong, a college         
           professor becomes increasingly obsessed with the       
           culture and sub-society of these dangerous groups.     
           The arrival of new neighbors, gives him new spirit,    
           as they are gregarious and friendly, with two          
           children that his son can be friends with. He is       
           even beginning to see another woman. However, he       
           begins to suspect something is odd about the           
           neighbors, something about the way they don't want     
         him to see certain parts of the house, or a set of    
        blueprints they have there. Are his neighbors          
        terrorists... or is the stress of losing his wife       
        merely driving him past the point of paranoia?
