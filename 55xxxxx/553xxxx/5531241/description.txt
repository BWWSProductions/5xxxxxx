Complete harandplay.com course for learning the piano/organ/keyboard by ear from the ground up.

Includes video fro 5 DVDs, ebooks, printable flash cards and learning software.




Every DVD covers one element of the formula:

Fundamental Factory is where you master the â€œFUNDAMENTAL FLUENCYâ€ strategies discussed earlier. Itâ€™s going to take you through literally everything you need to know to build a solid foundation as a gospel musician.

After this DVD, youâ€™ll have that rock solid base upon which everything else will be built.

MANY GOSPEL MUSICIANS SKIP THESE FUNDAMENTALS AND IT CAUSES THEM TO BE STUCK FOREVER.

Not you.


Chord County is where you master the â€œCHORDAL COMMANDâ€ techniques and principles we talked about.

Youâ€™re going to learn EVERY CHORD used in gospel music. All of them. If itâ€™s common and used in gospel music, itâ€™s in this course.

The best part is that youâ€™re going to learn all the shortcuts. You got to see a glimpse of how all chords are related. Chord County will delve into each one, step by step.


Pattern Paradise is where you master the â€œPATTERN PROFICIENCYâ€ concepts from above.

Imagine a DVD dedicated just to patterns. How theyâ€™re formed. How they work. Where to find them. How to use them, step by step.

And if youâ€™ve gotten ONE thing out of this free report, it should be that: SONGS ARE FULL OF REPEATED, PREDICTABLE PATTERNS THAT OCCUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

Pattern Paradise will make this plain with tons of real-life examples, demonstrations, and illustrations.


Song Station is where you master the â€œSONG SOLIDITYâ€ strategies we explored... plus lots more.

Just imagine a song being taught to you from the TOTAL BEGINNING. I mean the TOTAL BEGINNING.

And by the end of the song, after applying everything youâ€™ve learned, you have a beautiful masterpiece with advanced chords and movements that youâ€™ve built up over time.

Thatâ€™s the beauty of â€˜Song Stationâ€™ and by the end of this DVD alone, youâ€™ll be transforming a basic hymn that you learn from â€˜ground zeroâ€™ into an advanced contemporary piece of art.


Ear Elevator covers the â€œEAR EFFICIENCYâ€ methods and concepts we delved into towards the end of this report.  

This will bring everything together by detailing how to use your ear to not only determine how songs are arranged and where theyâ€™re going, but to create your own renditions and routes ON THE SPOT.

It basically shows you how to take full advantage of your ear and how to use what you know to NEVER play the same thing, the same way... TWICE! (Playing by ear is about having freedom... you donâ€™t have to play your songs the same way every time.)


This package is loaded with everything you need to become a TRANSFORMED MUSICIAN.

Thatâ€™s why we call it MUSICIAN TRANSFORMATION.
