The Complete Peel Sessions Box-set by The Fall:

spread over 6 discs, every song recorded by The Fall for BBC John Peel sessions between 1978 & 2004, as thename suggests. .wma, Only 64kbps, but unless you're listening on a Bang&Olufsen or similar system that isn't an issue: It's The Fall...

EDIT:

Please Note: I store my music on an Archos Multimedia device, so i'd recommend skipping any .atf files (in folders named _arcthumb) as these are system files which I forgot to remove from the torrent. Sorry about that :)
