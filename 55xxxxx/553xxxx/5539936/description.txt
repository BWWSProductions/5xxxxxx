SUMMARY



Arrogant, self-centered movie director Guido Contini

finds himself struggling to find meaning, purpose, and a

script for his latest film endeavor. With only a week

left before shooting begins, he desperately searches for

answers and inspiration from his wife, his mistress, his

muse, and his mother. As his chaotic profession steadily

destroys his personal life, Guido must find a balance

between creating art and succumbing to its obsessive

demands.
