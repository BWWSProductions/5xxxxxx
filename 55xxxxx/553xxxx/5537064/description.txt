Vernon, an ageing punk rocker who moves into his teenage kids' student flat after a spectacularly nasty divorce.
His kids, Max & Milly and their flatmate David are mortified. 

Heâ€™s genuinely excited about his chance to be young again. 

Bryan is Vernon's best mate and a former member of his punk band The Plague. 
These days, Bryan is deputy head of a smart primary school and has a nice house, a nice car, a nice life and an ongoing marriage. 
Which, in Vernon's eyes, makes Bryan a sad loser.

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
