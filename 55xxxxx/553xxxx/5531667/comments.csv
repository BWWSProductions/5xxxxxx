Dead weather rock my temple !"
,nerdicus,2010-05-04T15:21Z,NOT 320k. This thing sounds shittier than the NPR stream.
,i_make_trouble,2010-05-04T20:42Z,"@nerdicus - yes this IS 320 k ! i cleaned up the webrip abit, so it DOES sound better. sell your headphones or something."
,basfish,2010-05-05T04:01Z,"Most certainly not 320 k, the audio noticeably quite often.

But all in all, still a decent torrent, thank you for your efforts. Did you just rip the NPR stream?"
,basfish,2010-05-05T04:02Z,"mistake- ""the audio noticeably quite often"" should read ""the audio noticeably crackles quite often"""
,habaneros,2010-05-05T10:37Z,Thank you alot :) 
,nerdicus,2010-05-05T18:02Z,"@ i_make_trouble: You've encoded it at 320 kbps, but the fact that your source is not CD means the end result is less than the standard assumption that ""320 kbs"". So your source, being a webrip, already began at far less than 320 kbs - which means just because you encode it at 320kbs, doesn't mean it's going to sound good. It sounds like shit. Good effort. And even if I were listening to it on headphones, I doubt my q-jays are to blame..."
,1337free,2010-05-06T06:32Z,"yeah, pretty much exactly what nerdicus said.

super crappy quality, with a really big file size. i would recommend waiting a week for a good rip. oh and i have 3 of the new songs in decent quality on my torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5517688/The_Dead_Weather__Sea_of_Cowards__3_Song_Promo__256kbps__[1337"
