,Shasato,2010-05-07T05:47Z,"As with the previous false upload of House, this is episode 19, not 20. and in russian dubbed, ewww."
,jrod236,2010-05-07T17:13Z,"First of all.. The titel of this torrent has ""RUS"" in it, so that it is in russian should not come as a supprise for you mate, second, if you missed that, open your eyes and read before you DL it says to places here that this episode is in russian, so no supprise there right? or?

And if you boughtered to investigate a little, this IS episode 20 in Russia. So no, there is nothing wrong with this UPL. Thx jepebrilo."
