The film is a collage effect of old black and white movie clips from films of the 1940s and 1950s, with more recent footage of actors similarly shot in black and white. When everything is put together, the original dialogue and acting becomes part of a completely different (and ridiculous) story. This was the last film for both costume designer Edith Head and composer MiklÃƒÂ³s RÃƒÂ³zsa.

Starring Steve Martin, Carl Reiner, Rachel Ward, and Reni Santoni.
