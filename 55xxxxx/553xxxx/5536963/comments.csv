,Kashew13,2010-05-06T02:31Z,Thank you very much!! I didn't think it would be that quick. Great job keep up the good work.
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-06T03:10Z,NP kashew13 :D
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-06T03:10Z,No problem kashew13 :D
[V],RR-NE,2010-05-06T08:34Z,I have the same files but mine are smaller size. Good work!
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-06T08:59Z,"I'd love to see them if they're actually the same files ... the only other person I know of who does 853x conversions is HolyRoses and he hasn't done EITHER of these films.

Also, if they're smaller sizes, they're not the same quality.  But I'd love to check them out if they are in fact a high resolution squeezed into a 640x container."

So ... I've gotten several messages lately on multiple sites asking about season 2 of ""The Clone Wars"" now that the season is finished ...

The answers are ...

YES, I am aware it's over.

YES, I am still planning on uploading the whole season in 853x converts like I did for the 1st season.

YES, I am working on it.

YES, I am nearly done. I actually only have a couple more left to convert and tag, and they will ALL be separate episodes (no double-episode files).

WHEN: Probably when this torrent is completed, I'll upload them."
[V],RR-NE,2010-05-06T13:44Z,"That's actually what I meant, same files as in same two movies. Sorry."
,romeox145,2010-05-07T00:28Z,hey vov liking this upload just wondering if you could do Pearl Harbor? if not thats fine thanks
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-07T03:05Z,"I can prolly handle that romeox ...

But I am committed to doing S2 of Star Wars:  The Clone Wars first ... so it might not be until late this weekend or early next week that I get to it.

I actually recently encoded that one, so it's no extra work, just gotta upload it.  I've also got ""Tora Tora Tora"", but I haven't done the work to hardcode the subtitles for all the sections in Japanese yet ... the blu ray rip's been sitting on my HDD for like 6 mo. lol"

,ProdigalWoodlouse,2010-07-10T15:40Z,At least the film series could never be as unspeakably dire as the books.
