,jahu123,2010-05-05T01:23Z,"Great quality, best ive seen upto now, dl'd about 2-3 others, but does anyone got subtitles for this one yet? Mickey rourke's russian accent isnt the best to understand with the audio quality, although its the best one ive come across."
,Racem22,2010-05-05T05:46Z,Wow dude.  I think we would all feel better if you kept the racist remarks to yourself.  Anyways thanks uploader.  You da man.
,Jimin4746,2010-05-05T10:10Z,I wasted my bandwidth on 3 fake vids from fckin of rat shit munching whores. I hope this is good.
,dp812,2010-05-05T13:49Z,"Great movie and great quality. The only complaint I really have is when there are subtitles for foreign languages, they're not in English (think it's Russian but can't be sure). But these scenes are few and far between and you can follow the plot perfectly without understanding the subtitles in these brief scenes. 

If you're in an area where it's not in the theaters yet (like I am, won't be out for quite some time where I'm at), then this is a great download. But when it does come out in theaters, I definitely encourage you to go see it again.

Also, this torrent doesn't include the additional scene after the credits. But there are other torrents for that. I suggest you track it down, because it's awesome."

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5529041/Iron_Man_2_2010_TS_XviD_Xclusive_LKRG%5BExtraTorrent%5D

Audio is a bit clearer n thats it,, Still people laughin in the background thoe..

Still same shite picture quality...

But this is to be expected for  a CAM quality recording.

Wait for a better release :)
