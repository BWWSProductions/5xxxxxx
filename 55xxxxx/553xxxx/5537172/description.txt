Various albums from the members of underground hip hop supergroup, Living Legends. Most are complete, but some I burned from my buddy and tracks were out of order, some had too few tracks and some had too many. All good stuff though.

Included albums:

Bicasso:
-Cartoon World III: Shovelin' Diamonds
-Living Life Lookin' Out
-Rebel Musiq


ENJOY!
