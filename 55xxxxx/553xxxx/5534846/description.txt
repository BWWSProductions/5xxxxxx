Work Done: Ok this cam was a mess, resolution was way to small, mpeg format, 
had a flicker...I did my best to fix it and i think i did a pretty
damn good job! anyway, filters added was a brightness/contrast, sharpen,
and a deflicker. Also thought it had too much orange and yellow so i 
added a little bit of red. Anyway, its first cam, so dont expect the 
best quality but i think it turned out pretty good. Audio isnt
to bad either, for cam audio anyway thanks to Campbellsoup for the 
source. Keep em comin!! Video still has a flicker in some spots, couldnt
remove it all but i did my best, i will defently do a V2 if we ever get a 
better source.

Greets out to my friends at extratorrent, Noir, IMAGiNE, Campbellsoup,
badass, sam, and wrath and many others past and present.

Please note that i am looking for Cam sources, video and audio. Please
contact me if you have anything usefull thanks.
