About the Author

Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 in the log cabin described in Little House in the Big Woods. She and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest. Later, Laura and her husband, Almanzo Wilder, made their own covered-wagon trip with their daughter, Rose, to Mansfield, Missouri. There, believing in the importance of knowing where you began in order to appreciate how far you've come, Laura wrote about her childhood growing up on the American frontier. For millions of readers Laura lives on forever as the little pioneer girl in the beloved Little House books.

Not sure if these are equalized, they seemed fine when we listened to them.  No sudden jumps in volume, but others may be more particular than I am.

Laura Ingalls Wilder once said the reason she wrote her books in the first place was to preserve the stories of her childhood for todayâ€™s children, to help them to understand how much America had changed during her lifetime. The popularity of the Little House series of books has grown phenomenally over the years!

So, let's teach our children what Laura wanted!
