,lepperfish,2010-05-12T03:29Z,"I do not understand how to do this bit..
navigate to your download directory with the command ""cd""
chmod +x keygen_osx
./keygen_osx

Can anyone explain further?"
,JKHILL07,2010-05-24T15:05Z,"To everyone wondering here is some more detailed instructions:

Don't enter the quotation marks, only the text inside

Firstly, download the free trial of Photoshop CS5 from Adobe's website, once it's downloaded follow the on screen instructions until you can use the application (feel free to do what you want)

The open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal), once terminal is open, enter ""sudo su -""
you will then be prompted to enter your password, enter it then press return.

then just copy and paste ""echo ""127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com"" >> /etc/hosts"" and hit return.

type cd, then space, then drag n' drop the folder you downloaded from this torrent into the command line. You will get something like ""cd /Users/Imac/Downloads/Adobe.Photoshop.CS5.Extended.v12.0.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker-EMBRACE "" (mine). Hit return.

Copy paste ""chmod +x keygen_osx"" and hit return.

Copy paste ""./keygen_osx"" (include the period) then hit return.

You will then be given a key, open photoshop, you will be prompted to either enter a key or continue with the free trial, type in the serial.

You now have a fully functioning version of Photoshop CS5, congrats!"
