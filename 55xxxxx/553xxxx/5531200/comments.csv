,sunbleached,2010-05-04T03:08Z,"Dear Mr Censor:
I'm pretty sure the uploader was just writing in ""manner-of-speaking"" when he wrote ""you are so freaking lucky you have me lol"". I personally have no interest in this file, just looking to see what it was - however am impressed with the lucidity of your snide remark. Try to remember that torrent sites are comprised of a wide variety of users of different age groups, ethnicity, and computer literacy. So if someone uploads a ""How to write a batch file"" torrent, why not just pass it over politely and go find something you DO need instead of making someone feel like shit.

PS I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings."

Get used to it; this site has many people just like me.  And I swear to god if one more person comments shit on this page I will take this down, ruining someone else's hopes of getting this file found no where else, (and if you read the description, you would know that I would be the one to know that).  If you want something for free, be prepared to take shit for it.  "

WTF? I was referring to JTaGRRRR's comments. I thought that was clear with ""Dear Mr Censor:""

So I was defending your right to post whatever you want without some moron calling you a noob...

""you're welcome""

,sunbleached,2010-05-04T07:32Z,"in addition:

@ JTaGRRRR - if you don't have anything nice to say, dont say it

@DARKSUPR3MACY - learn to read

@sunbleached [myself] - mind my own business. Get a hobby instead of posting comments on torrent sites. Maybe learn to knit."

Dont realy see how luck/noob have anything to with ""owning a jtaged/hacked console""."
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-04T21:39Z,Well my bad sunbleached.
,sunbleached,2010-05-04T21:42Z,no worries...
,sunbleached,2010-05-04T21:44Z,"FLAME ON!

ha ha"
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-04T22:55Z,Totally agree lol!  I just kind of think its funny that this torrent has like 12 comments and only a few downloads.
,JTaGRRRR,2010-05-05T01:40Z,Sorry EVERYONE!  I had a bad day yesterday!  I take it all back... :-)
