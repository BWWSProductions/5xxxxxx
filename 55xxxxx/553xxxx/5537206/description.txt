Various albums from the members of underground hip hop supergroup, Living Legends. Most are complete, but some I burned from my buddy and tracks were out of order, some had too few tracks and some had too many. All good stuff though.

Included albums:

-Almost Famous

-Classic
-Crappy Old Shit
-Creative Differences
-Legendary Music Vol. 1
-Legendary Music Vol. 2

ENJOY!
