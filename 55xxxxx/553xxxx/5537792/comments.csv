,agmobb,2010-05-06T08:21Z,Thank you eztv. I can always count on you!
,scottymadlove,2010-05-06T08:30Z,"1st: EZTV Thank you sooo very much! You've made life as an expat in Asia all the more bearable for the past 4 years.

2nd: If I may be so bold, I have a request. Can you upload the webcasts of the aftermath shows for TUF? All the sites that show it say ""Sorry not available in your country"" except for one which stopped uploading. I am pretty computer savvy and tried all the tricks I could think(masking/private isp etc.) of. I am turning to you in my desperation. If you can't, no problem. If you can, then please add one more ""Thank you"" to the uncountable amount I already owe you. "
