It says unlock code.


what do I do to enter the unlock code?

step by step please :)"
,btgbullseye,2010-05-14T08:34Z,"Keygen gives a 15-digit key, and Genuine Fractals requires an 18-digit key.

Also, the CORE10k keeps giving errors in the legitimacy check... Looks like this is junk."
,btgbullseye,2010-05-14T08:41Z,"Nix that previous comment, the instructions to install are crap.

Input some random 18 digit number into the first keycode box, then chose Manual Activation. Insert the 15 digit keygen code to activate the program, and you're done."
,m-bius,2010-05-23T20:25Z,"btgbullseye's method works for me.  Use any number for the 18-digit key, then use keygen for the 15-digit activation."
,JackinYaBox,2010-08-22T15:43Z,"Keygen not working for me. Doesn't actually create a key.

A cmdprompt pops up saying:

""Unlocking Key:
NB: Open License Manager and chose phone license to enter unlocking key.""

Any help?"
,sachabey,2010-10-26T06:49Z,"I installed this, used a random 18 digit key on the first box, generated a 15 digit key from the keygen and used it. Got through installing, used the license manager like it says on the NFO file, but I can't get to actually using the software. Each time I try, a windows comes up asking to register it online, not now, or never register. and that's it, nothing happens afterwards. help!"
,Barroquecore,2010-10-29T01:42Z,"I didn't need to enter a random 18-digit number. Just selected manual, entered the code given in the keygen and done. Thanks."
,ALBOSUK,2010-12-08T09:42Z,"Thanks   sachabey.

Install and insert random 18 digit number (no spaces or dashes) then when asked for ulocking code copy and paste it from keygen."
,skullfcukyou,2010-12-10T16:08Z,"it stopped working recently. On numerous machines. Photoshop simply crashes. WTF?? Did they ""zap"" my copy somehow?"
,OrionH,2010-12-31T05:22Z,To use the keygen you have to go to the install directory and run the license manager and then go to phone.  Then run the keygen and use the 15 digit key for whatever it needs there.
,blingcrosby,2011-01-29T19:50Z,"Not sure what my problem was, but I encountered a ton of 0x5 Access Denied errors while installing. Needless to say, after two identical attempts, the program did not function."
