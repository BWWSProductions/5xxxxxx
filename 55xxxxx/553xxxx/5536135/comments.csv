,charlestoast,2010-05-06T20:09Z,"I wish someone would upload the Eurosport coverage rather than the BBC stuff. The BBC commentary team of Parrish and the other bloke are useless. They keep missing the on-track action while they gas about other stuff. They make odd clicking noises all the time, and absolutely worst of all, a total beginner's mistake, they mention the results of the 125 and Moto2 races! Idiots! No more BBC coverage for me."
