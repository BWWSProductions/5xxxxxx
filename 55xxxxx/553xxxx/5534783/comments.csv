,fieryfire,2010-06-28T05:39Z,"hey sigmareborn,GR8 find on the unsigned dlc stuff.

CAN u please post in dlc for these discs to

Oblivion goty edition dlc
assassin creed 2(if there is dlc disc)
and 
could u post for any known dlc that can be transfered with ease through usb drive"
,sigmareborn,2010-06-28T06:06Z,alas i dont have oblivion nor at this time do i have the funds to purchase it..
,fieryfire,2010-07-03T05:40Z,"oooo....its ok sigmareborn!
is there a way you can rip the dlcs from the goty edition disc available from the torrents."
,sigmareborn,2010-07-03T15:24Z,"no, its a .con file when its on the disc for it to work properly it needs to be installed from the disc, i dont have a modded xbox (one of the reasons why i made these torrents for everyone to use). as for your other question on my other torrents i am not aware of assassins creed 2 dlc on a disc and the only other unsigned files i know of is the halo wars files and sgt johnson for ODST. castle crashers DLC is unsigned but i am unable to figure out how to install it without errors on any other consoles."
,ic3breezy,2010-07-13T10:03Z,Can you get the  GTA IV DLC and do delisted Arcade games work lon the USB like UMK3 or Double Dragon?
,sigmareborn,2010-07-13T20:37Z,"gta 4 dlc disc is actually a separate game and doesnt require you to have gta 4 ergo its not \""true\"" dlc. if you have a jtaged xbox yes you can download ANYTHING from the marketplace for free. if your like me without any mods to your xbox then this is about the extent of getting free stuff."
,ic3breezy,2010-07-14T08:27Z,"i just played yaris without a jtaged xbox so i\'m guessing other delisted game can work, if you have any."
,andyk56,2010-08-04T08:52Z,downloaded fine got it on my xbox ok but after getting past the first part it froze when going up a set of stairs. I restarted my xbox and tried again like five times same thing happened. Anyone have the same problem?
,artur122235,2011-02-08T05:45Z,seed plz
