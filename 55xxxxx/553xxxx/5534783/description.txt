This File Pack includes Mothership Zeta DLC for the 360.
The two ways to get this to work on your system are as follows:

1) Data transfer cable to your hard drive.
2) using a usb jumpdrive/flashstick to put the files onto your hard drive.

The USB one is a whole lot easier and the one i imagine most will use so i will walk 
you through that method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) open up USB Xtaf explorer and click no when it asks to update to the new version

2) make sure you have your usb drive configured for use with your 360

3) click file and open device

4) if you have used your drive for previous tranfers etc then there shoudl be a content
   folder if not, right click and create new folder named "content" (without the "")

5) double click on the new folder and it should be empty, click the button inject folder

6) inject the 0000000000000 folder from the torrent.

7) ?????

8) PROFIT!
