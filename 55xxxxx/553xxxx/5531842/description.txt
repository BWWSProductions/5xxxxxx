"CRASHERS" 

When the body of a young model, Brenna Lane (guest 
star Sabina Gadecki), is found burning in an alley, 
Detective Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) and Detective 
Kevin Bernard (Anthony Anderson) go in search of 
her killer. With no witnesses, the detectives must 
retrace the victim's last steps to get insight into 
her final days. They quickly discover that just 
before her death, Brenna crashed an upscale 
political event, hosted by Senator Peterson (guest 
star Tony Roberts) and his wife, Camille (guest 
star Kathy Baker). As secrets unfold, Lupo and 
Bernard realize that they must untangle an 
intricate web of lies to obtain the truth about 
Brenna Lane's murder.
