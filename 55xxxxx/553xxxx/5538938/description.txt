I had been planning on sharing this collection later.  However, I just read the request of the kind person that spent who knows how many days doing the John Denver Discography several years ago for any Chad Mitchell Trio.

I have been trying to make sure I am not posting duplicates or lower quality than what is already posted.


Sorry "Alive is not complete, that was all of it I have.

For those that are keeping track of such things, these are the original albums and songs on them.  The only fills from the internet are tracks 1 & 4 on Alive.

The Albums are:

Alive (1967)
Mighty Day on Campus (1961)
Reflecting (1964)
Singing Our Mind (1963)
That's the Wat It's Gonna Be (1965)
The Best Of The Chad Mitchell Trio (1963)
Typical American Boys (1965)

If you have more of Chad Mitchell please share.

These are ripped from vinyl and RTR.  320 VBR.

Turntable: was Dual with Pickering XV15 and Shure elliptical stylus.
RTR: Roberts 5000 set up in lab after replacing all the electrolytic caps.

Enjoy and PLEASE seed
