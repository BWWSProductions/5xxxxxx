,Mercyflush64,2010-05-05T01:18Z,I remember reading vol.1 as a kid growing up. It's nice to see this effort to put together a complete collection. Now I can fill in the few I was missing. Thanks for all of the work gathering these.

,alex_2d,2010-05-06T16:53Z,"guys, seeeed, i am the only one seeding. You know the basic rules right? "
,fuckfrank,2010-05-08T07:29Z,Thanks for this alex.  Everyone please keep uploading!
,alex_2d,2010-05-08T14:53Z,"well, because noone is uploading except of me and some other guy, everyone who downloads this torrent, will fully get it 100% in a year or so. So, if you start download the files and it says 1,2 weeks, its not a crappy torrent, its because nobody is seeding.
