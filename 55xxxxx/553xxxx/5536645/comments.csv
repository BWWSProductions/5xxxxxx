Appreciate the support"
,charm_8,2010-06-06T22:44Z,"I downloaded the torrent fine, but when I play the movie, all I get is audio. The screen stays blank and for the sample video, all I have is one frozen picture and normal audio. Can someone help?"
,charm_8,2010-06-07T03:45Z,"Okay, now the picture part of the movie is showing up, but it's all static-y and slow. The audio is going on normally, but the picture just is not working well. Is there something I can do to fix it?"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-06-07T05:39Z,"@ charm

reinstall ur codec pack
Try K Lite codec Pack

And than play the Movie on Windows media Player"
