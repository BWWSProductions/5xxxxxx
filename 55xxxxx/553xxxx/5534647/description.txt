      Rory and his team return in the run-up to the General
      Election with three specials, recorded on the day of
      transmission, giving their own cutting, comic take on the
      election as it builds to its climax. Including up-to-the-minute
      monologues, interviews and pranks, The Wind Up unwinds the
      Cameron - Brown - Clegg showdown as it happens. Rory provides
      analysis and a running commentary, aided by John Bird, John
      Fortune and a host of special guests together with a cast of
      hundreds who offer a bypass around the stuffy debate. The Daily
      Wind Up is a countdown of everything you wanted to know about
      the election, plus several things you didn't, from the country's
      top political satirist.
