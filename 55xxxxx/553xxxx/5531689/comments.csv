,dvallej,2010-05-04T05:34Z,"this torrent is not in the eztv twitter feed (yet) so ill wait and see, the people downloading this let us know"
,nodyarg,2010-05-04T05:44Z,its not fake. its in their feed now. and its an avi. and the uploader was eztv. its real.

,rebelflagvl,2010-05-04T06:50Z,Did you fucks just accuse eztv of posting a fake? 
,jgoodwin27,2010-05-04T07:08Z,Whats this -2HD tag stand for? I've seen this pop up many times lately but still haven't found it what it means quality/coding wise? or is it just another warez group tag?
,brewcity77,2010-05-04T07:27Z,"rebelflagvl, I think it's more that a lot of Anonymous users put eztv in the title line to make it seem as if it's trustworthy content, and some of the others using eztv in the title that aren't eztv still have green skulls by their name. They are just trying to verify that this is really the eztv UL."
,rebelflagvl,2010-05-04T07:55Z,"green skull = trusted uploader
username = eztv
i've been downloading his stuff for a long time and not once has it ever not been what he said it was nor any trusted uploader for that matter. which for that matter is why they are a trusted uploader.

,bDDw_FritzDaKat,2010-05-04T22:09Z,The Fake eztv's are usually anonymous uploads with his name on the torrent file. If you look for the green skull can't go wrong.

,braab69,2010-07-17T12:20Z,"THX eztv, as usual top notch. A=10 V=10nn@ikweethetwel: apparently your name is a screw up. If you were not from a country where they recycle TV series that are 5 years old, you would recognise the new format of introduction, leader, main body. Furthermore, scrolling a bit forward before you troll here would be a sign of intelligence.  Don\'t speak before you can think..."
