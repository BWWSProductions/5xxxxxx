"Druuna is an erotic science fiction and fantasy comic book character created by Italian cartoonist Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri, featured prominently in Metal Hurlant and Heavy Metal (censored versions) magazines. Druuna is the main character, and has starred in eight volumes of the Morbus Gravis  series between 1985 and 2003: Morbus Gravis, Morbus Gravis 2: Druuna, Creatura, Carnivora, Mandragora, Aphrodisia, The Forgotten Planet and Clone."

This is the complete series in french language, totally uncensored. I got the individual files from various sources and had to exchange some corrupt files, but now its all there. I don't have info about the original scanners, but lots of kudos for the work.
Since you normally only find the censored versions of this CB, i decided to make them available in their original form.

Format: *.cbr (i recommend ComicRack, great tool for reading & archiving)
