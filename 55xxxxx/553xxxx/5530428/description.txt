James Purefoy stars as Solomon Kane, a wandering 16th century
hero whose haunted past forces him to redeem himself by battling
a growing evil in his homeland in this big-screen incarnation of
Robert E. Howard's cloaked pulp character. Deathwatch's Michael J.
Bassett directs from his own script, with Max von Sydow, Pete
Postlethwaite, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Alice Krige, and Mackenzie Crook
co-starring. ~ Jeremy Wheeler.
