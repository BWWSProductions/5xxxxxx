These are Bill Hughes' and Kieth Hilton's 2 amazing video lectures The Papacy in the Wilderness and Countdown to Sunday which together expose the massive involvement of the Catholic church in the politics of 20th century. What was the meaning of 1st and 2nd World war for the papacy? Who defeated the axis powers and send the papacy to the wilderness as predicted by biblical prophecy? How did the papacy use the cold war and anticommunism to rise from the ashes using the United States of America as its crusader? What was the role of US presidents JFK and Reagan in the catholic lobby? Why was America literally driven into bankruptcy in order to bring down the Soviet Union? How is it possible that some of the most ardent communist leaders like Joseph Stalin, Fidel Castro and Ngo Dinh Diem had catholic roots? Is it possible that the Catholic church simply used such mass movements as communism to destroy its mortal enemies, the Orthodox church in Russia and buddhism in Asia? How is it possible that after all kinds of revolutions and social transformations the Vatican still operates all over the world? Using documented evidence, a long-range plan of the papacy is unveiled which among others include the activation of concentration camps in America and destruction of yet another papacy's mortal enemy - the Protestant church. 2 x 110 min. long. A must see for everyone.
