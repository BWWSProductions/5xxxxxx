Firstly, I know this isn't all of Hazards music, but it's quite alot of it (not including remix's) and is the most I currently have by downloading it off+ limewire 

All of it is 192kbps-320kbps and VBR except for "Killers don't die".


To check the tracklist just look at the files in the torrent, they haven't been put in folders.
