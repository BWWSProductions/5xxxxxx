Where is all the old surfin' music?  I can not be the only one with a bunch of old 60s albums.

Please share what you have that is not already posted.


These are ripped from vinyl and RTR.  320 VBR.

Turntable: was Dual with Pickering XV15 and Shure elliptical stylus.
RTR: Roberts 5000 set up in lab after replacing all the electrolytic caps.

Enjoy and PLEASE seed
