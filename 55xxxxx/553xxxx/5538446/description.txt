Notes:

SMOKEY did a BDRip of this one a few days back. However their release is not
TXD2K9 compliant, since they decided to release it with 640 kbit AC3 audio.
According to TXD2K9 the maximum allowed bitrate for an AC3 track is 448 kbit.

They also decided to tag it DANISH and only include danish subs as needed.
I don't know what subs are on the Bluray, but this release has nordic subs
plus english subs included. This is why this release is not labeled PROPER
even though the SMOKEY release is not TXD2K9 compliant. A release with
english subs does not PROPER a release with localized tag.

This movie also compresses extremely well, and there is absolutely no reason
to make it a 2CD release.

So, here is a TXD2K9 compliant rip, with all available subs and just as good
quality.
