,tunaonrye,2010-05-03T20:10Z,"ill give it a shot and post back,fk it,prob a fake but who knows?"
,TapoutRenegade,2010-05-03T20:33Z,Is this missing the end just like the other copies out there?
,sqrewd2,2010-05-03T21:50Z,Duration : 1h 32mn
,whitey85,2010-05-03T22:26Z,NOT FAKE TUNA .bone. dont fuck around. your an idiot for thinking its fake.
,IamNightmare,2010-05-04T04:38Z,all the releases have no ending.. i was right into it then it cut off.. thats a fuckin dropkick to the nuts.
,ScamWoW,2010-05-04T06:07Z,well the screens look pretty good if those are the real screens to this actual cam vid who knows ill try it anywayz
,ltcmdrData,2010-05-04T06:54Z,"Screens do look pretty good, I'm gonna check it out. I'll comment back with a review and audio and video quality. "
,MarcFirewing,2010-05-04T07:31Z,"Still in the midst of watching it.

V. 5/10
A. 4/10

Watchable, but when it gets loud, it gets a bit staticy. Good release nonetheless."
,merchanic,2010-05-04T07:34Z,last 5 or 10 minutes missing!!
,MarcFirewing,2010-05-04T07:58Z,"Also there's adverts on the cam for the intro as well as along when they're in the library. I don't think that's much of a spoiler but eh.

Also, the movie's 95 minutes, including credits. How can it be missing 5 - 10 minutes when it's 1:32? Fail."
[T],FrodooBagginz,2010-05-04T10:59Z,"V: 7
A: 7

However, the advertisements ruin this release. So pirates are now adding ads in their releases? I will avoid any future TA release."
,geddy204,2010-05-04T11:21Z,"Yes, this is a real one.
Yes, there is a watermark advertisement, but it goes away after a while.
The ending is not cut off... all is in tact.
A - 5 / V - 5 ... about the kind of quality you'd expect.
Try this one out... it's not too bad."
,.EzDL,2010-05-04T16:59Z,"Thank's, DLING now."
,tunaonrye,2010-05-04T22:53Z,"thank you geddy...clear and to the point,I wish everyone commented like that!"
,BillyBloodz,2010-05-05T03:18Z,"thx for the up but dang what a shitty cam, anyways cant complain its here for free thx again"
,tunaonrye,2010-05-05T07:35Z,"ok im 45 mins into in so thought Id take a smoke break and report my review of this file.....not too shabby at ALL considering it's so early in the game,I use vlc and after tweaking a bit with the brightness and all that,its totally watchable..yeah I suppose you could wait for a better release but if you arent picky or (like me) hate horror movie remakes yet feel compelled to watch them to see if they destroyed the franchise or reinvented it but refuse to pay to see it because in hindsight you already did when the original came out.well sir/maam,this aint too bad.thanks uploader"
[V],greenbud1969,2010-05-05T14:04Z,Replacing Robert Englund was the dumbest idea ever. I give this Jackie Earle Haley that replaced Robert Englund  2 thumbs down. The movie would of been 100x better if they would of stuck with the original freddy. This is a big slap in the face for all Freddy Krueger fans. The movie it self was ok but it could of been alot better. 
,GAZZA2008,2010-05-05T15:21Z,its all there as far as i can see with writing at the end i aint watched it yet just flicked through it and its real  audio = 6 video = 6 watchable and no other real copies out yet. t.y. bone. :o)
,Fighter02,2010-05-05T18:17Z,"HORRIBLE MOVIE. Don't even download, much worse than Halloween remake or even F13.. just awful."
,tunaonrye,2010-05-05T18:45Z,"greenbud.......


yeah I agree,you cant replace englund there is no way anyone could fill those shoes,all in all i dug the remake of some of the classic scenes from the original tho and as a movie it wasent THAT bad..but fred himself?yeah he sucked and so did his lame ass one liners,he wasent funny nor sinister at all!"
,Geejus420,2010-05-06T01:35Z,a/7 v/5 watchable....but flickers on the bright scenes and isnt bright enough in the dark scenes...ill wait for a better copy...thanks for the upload man!
,Geejus420,2010-05-06T01:36Z,greenbud...if they would have stuck with robert englund...there'd be no reason for everyone to go see it.....it would just be another nightmare on elm street part 10 or whatever...
,whatever89,2010-05-06T04:06Z,"Movie sucked ass really bad!!!!! Do you yourself a favor, watch the original and not this piece of crap. I don't remember Freddy ever talking like the Dark Knight before. The Halloween remake was 100x better then this, Halloween 2 remake was atleast 10x better then this. *Spoiler Alert!!! Freddy maybe a pedophile now in the New NMOES instead of a child murderer, but I'm the one who feels like I got raped."
,sir_butters,2010-05-06T16:01Z,"what was the weird stuff at the end , tellin me to buy a book i think. "
,flarngus,2010-05-06T17:02Z,"Sounds like somebody's munching on popcorn and slurping on a soda.  Plus, the quality is terrible.  Not going to waste my time with this."
,tunaonrye,2010-05-06T18:01Z,"whatever89......


I think the people putting up the millions to make the movie are the ones that really got raped when we are watching it for free,just my opinion.But I knew it wouldnt be close to as good as the orig so thats my excuse for gettting it here lol"
,steelcitysy,2010-05-06T23:49Z,"BEFORE YOU ALL START ABOUT ""WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR FREE?"" I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT BUT IM TELLIN YOU THIS IS COMPLETELY UNWATCHABLE...JUST FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MONTHLY DL LIMITS.... I WOULDNT EVEN BOTHER.. HOLD TIGHT THEY GONNA BE A GOOD UN OUT THERE SOON"
,ThaBoogeyman,2010-05-07T01:09Z,Some information about the subs?
,Helmet507,2010-05-07T03:28Z,"good movie, creeped me out a bit somethin fierce lol"
,NukePanda649,2010-05-08T02:11Z,"to all of you out there criticizing JEH's performance, Robert Englund himself said he approved of it 
of course you all think Robert Englund's the best Freddy but that's simply because there's only two people that've played Freddy Krueger, I gotta tell ya I think theyre both pretty damn terrifying in theyre own ways you have to see it through the eyes of everyone not with your own personal perspective, self centered self righteous fanboy idiots"
,Geejus420,2010-05-08T02:50Z,"89....halloween remake was done by a completely different director and is a completely different movie altogether....if you want to comment like youre some sort of movie critic...than comment on the good AND the bad....other wise you look like a biased retard spewing garbage out of his mouth.....now let the real movie critics make up their mind.,...not someone who has a crush on robert englund.....the only reason they took englund out was so that they couldnt associate this one with the old ones....other wise it wouldve just been freddy part 12 or whatever theyre at....get it?>"
,007_bond,2010-05-08T19:33Z,"enjoyed what i saw from this cam recorded version!.. 

visuals are watchable but has some scrolling/flashing sections as the movie progesses due to what seems like the video cam that recorded it not being able to handle the transitions between certain clips!.. as far as CAM recorded versions go, this isnt too bad!.. audio rumbles a little when things get a little loud but all in all nothing is missing from the movie!.. "
,whatever89,2010-05-10T00:19Z,"@ 420 ....there was nothing good about the movie. As bad as Freddy's Revenge was it was still better than this. I was really bored sitting in the theater watching this. The first NMOES made me scared to fall asleep, this one made look forward to it. And I know Halloween was made by a different director! The point I was making is that movie gets bashed a lot as a remake( I thought it was okay) but it was better than this. That's how bad this movie is. I don't blame Haley's performance, I blame a really bad script, bad directing, and Micheal Bay. An actor can only work with what he's given. The script was absolutely horrible!! It was all over the place, and for the longest time it had no idea who it's main cast were. It really wasn't as smart as the original. As bad as some of the originals were atleast there was some camp value, this doesn't even have that."
,whatever89,2010-05-10T00:24Z,There's a reason this movie only has 15% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I get more scared that I might slip and fall in the shower then I did watching this. 
,DoomTra1n,2010-05-10T06:14Z,"@ whatever89

If you watch close enough, you'll hear that Freddy was already a pedophile in the old NMoES movies. It's even said by the adults a couple times, and I think implicated by the lil girl.

Gonna try this movie out anyways, see how horrible it fails w/out Robert Englund. they could have AT LEAST remade the movie with him....."
,Goopa,2010-05-10T21:43Z,"The fucks up with the Advertising...?


A - 6
V - 7
M - 8"
,johnnyangus,2010-05-12T20:51Z,movie is just utterly horrible...Robert Englund IS Freddy!!!...It just doesnt compare..nuff sed
,whatever89,2010-05-13T02:01Z,"@Doomtrain If it was mentioned, then it was very subtly hinted at. The main focal point was that he was a child murderer. Micheal Jackson ""allegedly"" liked to touch little kids, and he only wore one glove too. Maybe he'll start coming after little kids in their dreams. Nightmare at Neverland lol. "
,d-thr33,2010-05-13T09:29Z,"HORRIBLE FUCKING MOVIE SAW IN THEATERS COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY ! THE GUY WHO PLAYS FREDDY HAS A FUCKING MONOTONE VOICE THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE !!! MOST HORRIBLE FREDDY IMPERSONATOR EVERRRR !


DO NOT DOWNLOAD MOVIE IS NOT WORTH SEEING EVEN IF IT WAS A DVD RIP !"
,kryptois,2010-05-14T07:37Z,Need a avi. For xbox360 anyone help me msg me
,sleepymonk,2010-05-15T13:36Z,"OK MOVIE. WATCHABLE. as for the film its ok not the best ive seen but i was expecting worse.

Download watch and make your mind up
"
,DethmetalLTD,2010-05-15T22:10Z,Holy fucking lot of seeds! 
,cwg138,2010-06-08T19:51Z,"Hey guys, let's keep things in perspective here. It's NMOES, it's a slasher film. It's always had a bad script. Even the very first one, say what you want about it being the best, that's because it's just the best of the worst. Take this for what it is, a remake of a 80's slasher franchise, period. You shouldn't be expecting much to begin with. After seeing this I was actually impressed, as I thought it was going to be much worse than it was. The only thing that made this really bad was the CAM. Watch this when the Rip comes out before you make any serious opinions."
,iruhsom,2010-07-09T09:57Z,"@whatever89nnI know it\'s already been pointed out, but I would like to second it.  It was made clear in the original series that Freddy molested children, too.  Not just killed them.  Infact, that\'s what he was most known and hated for.  Kind like, torturing them until he got tired of it, then killed them."
,rizzo77,2010-07-22T16:55Z,is this good
,watbol,2010-07-29T08:36Z,"Very Good, Nice 16:9-WideScreen movie.
