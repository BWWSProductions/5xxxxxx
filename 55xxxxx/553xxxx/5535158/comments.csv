First and foremost, comparing a winchester rifle and a hand grenade to determine which is better for long range combat? A grenade...a FUCKING grenade. There`s so much bullshit going on on this show that i`m about to cry. I hope the guys who came up with these lame-ass experiments all faceplant a fucking landmine. Anyway, not your fault uploader and I hope someone enjoy this piece of sciene-fiction/fantasy-history/sci-fi-gangrape more than I did.

Thank you, hej Svejs!"

Thanks very much for the upload. :)

@Markus: You're supposed to watch the show because it's funny. :P"
