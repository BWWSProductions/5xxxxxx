Wisconsin's NoahJohn have been lauded as "The Velvet Underground gatecrashing a hoe-down". Unfortunately this description doesn't hold true with Water Hymns, their third full-length effort. Certainly The Velvets are still a marked influence--you can tell from the echoing, claustrophobia-inducing jangle of the opening "They Will Call" and "Rabbit is Asleep". 
But hoe-downs? There's not much to galvanise here. Led by ex-Indiana farm boy Carl Johns, NoahJohn are American slo-mo indie rock, in the same vain as a countrified Codeine (without that band's painfully affecting vulnerability), or Low touched by the gothic folk of Mark Lanegan. Johns's subject matter can be involving--"First Communion" has a young boy seduced by a lonely older woman, "Ballad of William Roy" has a man die trying to save his drowning wife, while "And the Lord" features masturbation, death and an angry God. And his lyrics, though often overly arcane, are truly well-written. But too often his singing is emotionless, lacking in both tune and drama. Sometimes the band does rise above the atmospheric droning. "Two Members" is an impressive slow stomp, while "Faerie Wings" is a bit like a narcoleptic "Freebird". But in general Water Hymns is too lethargic to really draw you in
