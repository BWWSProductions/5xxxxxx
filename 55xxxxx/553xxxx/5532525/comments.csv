,fivee,2010-05-04T15:37Z,"Thks a bunch,

Farnorths acount seems to be deleted, or at least his torrents have, glad to have you carrying on the work!

Its very much apreciated,

Again, Tnks!"
,mrberkut,2010-05-04T23:57Z,"Yea, either Farnorths's account was deleted today or all of his torrents.  Either way, it seems that he is MIA.  :-(  Thanks a lot emuparadise for this torrent and continuing his work!  Very much appreciated!"
,sukenny,2010-05-05T03:26Z,"i'm glad someone finally continue farnorth's work. thanks, man! i've been waiting forever..."
,entropoid,2010-05-06T05:35Z,"Awesome. Glad to know someone's picking up the torch, emu!"
,jumpingphil,2010-05-06T09:47Z,"It does seem strange that Farnorth is not on here anymore.
He has put this rompack ""out there"" a week or so ago but for some strange reason it is not on here.
I did read that he had some other commitments but was ""catching up now"".
But it is very strange that his rompacks have gone but Joda's are still there.

Anyway, thank you Emuparadise for continuing Farnorth's good work in continuing Joda's good work.

I'm sure there are lot's of people like me who appreciate this even if hardly any of them post a thank you."
,potechi,2010-05-06T15:57Z,"Thank you.
I was worried when I can't find Farnorh's rompack."
,jumpingphil,2010-05-07T02:18Z,"I had a problem with some of these.
They were not all nmbered correctly it would seem.
They all got sorted out though with one exception.
I can't get 4709 Alvin and the Chipmunks to load.
Any one else having the same problem?"
,Hotmailer,2010-05-07T23:01Z,"Thanks Emuparadis for continuing the Rompack legacy!

For your info, I've added all Farnorth's Torrent files as a new Torrent for everyones convenience.
Search for it on TPB.

Take care and please continue the legacy."
,zxkb4s29,2010-05-08T20:03Z,"ok, this is a mess: release numbers of files in archives are not the same as numbers of the archive. totally fucked up."
,jumpingphil,2010-05-12T02:45Z,"@zxkb4s29
What an ungrateful little shit you are.
Why couldn't you be polite in pointing out problems instead of being a wanker.
Go back to getting your files 1 at a time you arse hole."
,ABUaBvF9,2010-05-13T22:25Z,"Thanks so much!

Hope Farnorth is okay and thanks for carrying on the releases."
,emuparadise,2010-05-14T16:13Z,"Sorry about the fact that the numbers inside the zips/7zs/rars are not correct. I'll bear that in mind for the next release and decompress all the files, rename them and then recompress them : )

You can do the same for this release =)"
,frogdumb,2010-05-16T07:58Z,"Just registered to have my words heard: For those who complain about wrong ID naming / archive type etc., please grow up more gracefully, learn to appreciate more, and at least try for one minute to resolve your own problem before complaining -- as a matter of fact, if you are using OfflineList, do a ROMs -> Fix Archive Type, the program will fix the naming and archive types for you in minutes.

P.S. THANK YOU, emuparadise! Keep up your good work and I am sure a lot of folks will appreciate your efforts as much as I do!"
,Hotmailer,2010-05-25T18:49Z,"Hey emuparadise!

,emuparadise,2010-05-25T21:36Z,Advanscene is only up to 4851 at the moment. The moment the new dats are out I'll post an update : )
,jachar,2010-06-07T18:48Z,"Emuparadise Big Thanks for the latest release

,emuparadise,2010-06-09T01:00Z,The new dats are out from advanscene. An update shall follow shortly. Cheers! : )
