I was a big fan of Farnorths NDS ROM Packs. I'm not sure why he stopped uploading them but since he stopped, here I am to pick up where he left off.

Here's a pack of Nintendo DS ROMs properly re-named using the AdvanScene dats. All the ROMs from 4701 - 4800 are there and have been checked and verified against CRCs.

Since we've already reached #4900 I'll add another torrent soon (once the dats are updated..) with the new releases.


For now, enjoy this release, I hope you like it.
