note: Original release had a truncated AC3 track around 2:09.  Stereo track and Video track were not impacted.  This includes the corrected AC3 track.  Exact same Video, Stereo, Subtitles as original.  If you have the original you can download the AC3 track only in separate torrent to correct it yourself and save a lot of bandwidth.
