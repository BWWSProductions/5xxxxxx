,tj11823,2010-05-06T08:35Z,"Great thanks, so this one works with the 360? Why the english subs if it's in english?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-06T18:49Z,because I cannot speak na'vi therefore subtitles are good.

,imcold7654,2010-05-08T03:42Z,i needs help getting the subs to work for VLC -.-
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-08T07:20Z,"click video, click subtitle track, select track 1."
,tj11823,2010-05-16T03:25Z,For some reason it doesn't work on the Xbox. Do I need to use mp4demux to take out the ac3 track?
,tj11823,2010-05-16T05:01Z,Nah man I can't get this to work on the Xbox. I tried demuxing it and it still wont play. Any suggestions?
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-16T18:42Z,"it will need to be streamed, it wont work because its over 4gb and your drive will not hold it."
,tj11823,2010-05-17T03:16Z,"I even tried burning it to a disc and it still didn't work. Damn, I wanna see this in BR, my PC will never run this. Thanks anyway man."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-17T03:24Z,you can remux it and remove the ac3 track and it will be fine.
,tj11823,2010-05-17T04:30Z,I tried that and it still didn't work. I even removed the subtitle track as well.
