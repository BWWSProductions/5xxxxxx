subs will come after this, just wait"
,D0gmeat,2010-05-04T12:43Z,"Wow! Many thanks!! Been waiting for this one!

I suspect it's probably a mislabelled DVDSCR. No matter as long as it is watchable. :) Now for some subtitles for us Mandarin-challenged people."
,rafayel,2010-05-04T12:46Z,There is no watermark.....for sure it is dvdrip....hpefully somebody will post the sub

Havn't watched it all the way thru yet but flicked thru n looks like its all in place, hope this helps =D

,TheCrysis,2010-05-06T21:18Z,"Watched the movie with the subs some one told in the comment's thanks for it!
Ip man 1&2 Best Chinese movie i ever seen and totally in my top 10 best movies list :D

Ip man 1 is still better than 2, but i really enjoyed this one too!
So 10/10 for the uploader!
8/10 for the video! Not the ""best"" DVD BUT dam GOOD!
Audio, nothing to complaint it was good and evrything was sync and so on. so 10/10 audio, still had to put voice a little up than normally, but nothing else."
,subhachandan,2010-05-07T12:13Z,"after downloading this movie i found that the file is not working,even in vlc & km player.dont know what's wrong with this file.but the movie uploaded by raymond house is working properly"
[T],gangmie,2010-05-08T04:28Z, thank you.. what is your next upload? 
,giantballsack,2010-05-09T17:31Z,I have no idea why every uploader is uploading the cut version. Can any uploader upload a full uncut version (meaning the bottom part is not cut). Please do it for those chinese people. Thanks.
