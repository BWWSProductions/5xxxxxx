This is the story of three different cops.

Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover cop that has lost his mind from being in so 
long. He has the job of brining in Caz (Wesley Snipes) by setting up a drug 
deal. Tango does not want to do this because of Caz saving his life. Tango does 
set him up but changes his mind however he his 30 seconds too late Caz is shot 
anyway. Sal (Ethan Hawke) is a corrupt cop trying to get extra money for a new 
house and with his wife expecting twins he is under a lot of stress. Eddie 
(Richard Gere) retires after a hellish week on the job. He tries to get his 
prostitute girlfriend to come with him, he refuses and takes off almost 
committing suicide. All three arrive at an apartment complex because they found 
out about criminal activity. Sal shoots a lot of people and is about to rob the 
place blind when he is shot in the back and killed. Tango goes off the deep end 
and ends up killing a man in the streets and is murdered by Sal's partner who 
did not know Tango was a cop.
