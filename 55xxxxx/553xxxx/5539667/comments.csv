Heston the Hack started his career in the 50s with these kinds of adventures, including The Naked Jungle (army ants eat up villagers etc.). The legend here was that Imu Sumac was really Amy Camus spelled backwards. Everyone should love the Inca band accompanying her on Machu Picchu. He went on to do The Ten Commandments, probably the pinnacle of his numerous I-am-God-Moses-Michaelangelo-El Cid roles that characterized his stone cut features. Unfortunately, he was a lousy actor, but always gamely tried more difficult roles that continuously revealed his mediocre abilities. As a secondary character actor he works rather well (The Three Musketeers, etc.) I suppose his greatest achievement was as president of the National Rifle Association, a link that made him appear ridiculous to his peers (Grepory Peck, a friend, once asked him about this, ""Larry, are you out of your mind?"" In fact, he was; in his last years he suffered from Alzheimer's."
,Bruckner8,2012-06-25T18:59Z,"vikingdude, so after a torrent of modern movies being produced to imitate the original Heston movies (and imitate excruciatingly badly due to current cultural norms), you still have the gall to call him ""the Hack""? But reading the rest of your hogwash post, it's not difficult to smell you out as limp-wristed male whose arse is stuffed so deep with far-left ideology that lambasting any classic but 'now' unpolitically-correct films or actors is your very enjoyable masturbation. But whatever, most men before or after have been and will always cherish Heston's movies, which provide them the inspiration they can hardly find in modern garbage (and by the way, I am a hardcore atheist, so don't even excuse with your 'religious nut' arguments)!
Ps. You should really 'drop' the name 'vikingman' and replace it with 'pinkest prince' or some queerer things since it will surely make you appear less bleeding confused!"
