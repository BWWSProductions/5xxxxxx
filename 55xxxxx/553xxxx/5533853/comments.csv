,sjbrule,2010-05-05T20:02Z,"I wish I did; they probably exist somewhere, but I don't know how to access them. Anyone have some ideas?"
,sxt09,2010-05-06T03:28Z,"I don't suppose anyone has got (or can point me towards) a regular avi file for this episode? The 720 version is great, but I'd really love to burn the entire season onto a DVD and I unfortunately can't use this file for that purpose. There's an avi version on a couple of sites but several people have said it's corrupted and although it plays OK it can't be burned to DVD :( Is anybody capable of doing a re-rip or something along those lines?"
,rsplatpc1,2010-05-06T05:42Z,no but your capable of doing a google search on how to do that easily for free
,rsplatpc1,2010-05-06T05:43Z,"convert this episode to that format that is, google it"
,sxt09,2010-05-06T15:06Z,Unfortunately that idea has already been tried over on the Demonoid forums and the file still came out as un-burnable :(
,antmartain,2010-05-10T12:42Z,"To those looking for a standard rip, there's a torrent containing every episode, search tim and eric season cinco, it's 1.12gb.

But this 720p version was glorious. I was geniunely almost sick watching it. Thank you."
