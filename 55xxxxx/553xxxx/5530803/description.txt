- Smile (A Reconstruction - by Purple Chick) -

"After the official release of Brian Wilson Presents Smile (BWPS) in 2004, you would have thought that the last thing I would have wanted to hear was yet another Smile mix by a fan. I've heard Smile done just about every way possible in fan mixes ... 
...Despite all the fan mixes that have come before, all Smile fans should take note of the Purple Chick Smile disc and search for your own copy - you won't be disappointed!"

I'm not shure, how many people are aware of this version. It's the best mix from the original "Smile Sessions" i've ever listened to.
