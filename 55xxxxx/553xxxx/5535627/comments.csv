,motnahpraw,2010-05-06T01:01Z,Does it work? How is it?
,motnahpraw,2010-05-06T02:54Z,I got into the Main Menu. Hadn't tried it in-game. Do I risk getting banned by Valve?
,esharoth,2010-05-06T17:33Z,"If you're worried about getting banned, don't use your main Steam account while playing this game."

,JopeCRO,2010-05-12T19:53Z,NOBODY HELP ME!!!!!!!!!
,JoeMimic,2010-05-12T22:32Z,JopeCRO  - Trying taking everything that's extracted after you mount and install the game and put it in the SteamApps\Common\Zero Gear folder. I originally got the same error but after I did that it worked just fine.
,esharoth,2010-05-20T21:24Z,"JopeCRO, the problem is with yout ZeroGear.bat file. If you installed the game in ""C:\Program Files\Lead and Gold"" for example, the ZeroGear.bat file should be:

cd /d D:\Games\Lead and Gold
start lag_win32_public_dev.exe
exit"
,esharoth,2010-05-20T21:29Z,"JopeCRO, if you installed the game in ""C:\Program Files\Lead and Gold"" for example, your ZeroGear.bat file should contain:

cd /d C:\Program Files\Lead and Gold
start lag_win32_public_dev.exe
exit"

,boricuaflyboy,2010-06-08T23:33Z, I usually have no problems downloading torrents but this one is unique. I got every thing working right when it starts up i get the black window where it looks like the game is loading it says Lead and Gold on top and everything but then it disappears and that's it.
