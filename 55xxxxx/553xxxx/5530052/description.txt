Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.

We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark

under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root

of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and

nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do

this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene

started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back

on contacting us as soon as possible.

twice the fun   / double the trouble
