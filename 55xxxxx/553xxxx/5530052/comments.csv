,rik4100,2011-04-16T17:15Z,"Good torrent! works fine!
it might be possible if u play this for first time
there are probably no key bindings
u can simply fix that by pressing the 'SET TO DEFAULT' button, 1 menu back...
HAVE MUCH DESTRUCTIVE FUN! :D"

,Mr_Kevini,2011-06-27T13:33Z,"No, as your system said: you dont have a new windows system. Than the game can't run on your system.Time to get a new computer :p. anyways, the game works fine. it has nice graphics. as told before, click on default if it doesnt work fine. Happy destruction time!! :D"
,Whomerang,2011-08-12T14:24Z,"Says quite clearly ""OPERATING SYSTEM: Microsoft Windows Vista (Windows XP is unsupported)"" so either get Vista/7 or gtfo. Thanks for the torrent btw."
,firebalz,2011-09-17T03:35Z,Thanks for the torrent but i seem to be having a issue im running win 7 well built pc. i burned to dvd and installed towards the end of the install i got about 20 file errors where they wouldnt install and also the .exe and a few others ive downloaded a few other torrents of this game also same problem any suggestions?
,Bonamico,2011-11-13T20:29Z,wheres the skidrow folder?
,chubbyninjatutorials,2011-12-17T23:54Z,"yay i wasted my time again... tried reloaded, that doesn't work. tried this and nope doesn't work. updated my drivers, downloaded gfwl, blah blah blah and nothing. wasted damn near a week burning up my bandwidth for this game, i'm just gonna go buy it lol. i'm seeding this and reloaded for those that can play it.. your welcome"
,AR2HUR,2012-01-07T13:35Z,"you piece of shit,this thorent and all your torents are infecteed whit very powerful viruses!I HOPE YOU GET BANNED FROM THIS SITE YOU FUCK!"
,Martin567ca,2012-04-15T22:12Z,"If eny 1 has problems opening the game, it might be about direct x, so either get newer or if you have a newer than the 1 needed , you have to try and find a way to get it to play, oh, and also try using compatibility mode to open the game and set it to windows xp pack 2, these are last hopes to work


I hope it does :)"
,milad2233,2012-05-19T10:07Z,LOOL FOR ANYONE THAT IS HAVING TROUBLE RUNNUNG THE GAME: i had the same problem i would select the language and it would just crash. you have to run the skidrow file (SKIDROW.exe) not the game. when the stupid skidrow thing pops up just press the space bar or any key and it would go away and run the game.
,Trashcat,2012-05-20T21:55Z,Doesn't work >.> Don't try..
,black4ty,2012-05-27T22:40Z,This torrent should work with the bolo patch if you downgrade the version.
,JerryShot,2012-07-09T19:43Z,I need more detail on how to setup the game b/c I am NOT a computer genius.  So someone please explain with a little more detail and common terms.
,JerryShot,2012-07-11T18:38Z,"What does unpacking the release mean?  Could someone put the instructions in simpler language, please?"
,JerryShot,2012-07-11T18:41Z,"When I try to start it, an error message says ""fmodex.dll is missing"".  Could someone help me please?"
,clenmila,2012-07-13T22:10Z,"So i downloaded this, installed it, then i copied over skidrow files over to the install dictionary. Yet the game will not launch. I tried running it as admin, but still will not work. 

I don't understand what is wrong because my computer meets the recommended requirements easy. Im running directX 11, so it shouldn't be DirectX.
