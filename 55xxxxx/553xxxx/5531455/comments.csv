,grandy88,2010-05-04T12:57Z,"It's not, but that's fine.  Please go away."
,grandy88,2010-05-04T13:04Z,"Stop voting my torrent down, douchebag.  Seriously, gtfo."
,ignaciok,2010-05-04T18:52Z,"Hey grandy, thanks for the great torrent. I'm still struggling to get S01 and S02. Any chance that you could upload the subtitles for them, or for all the season? I would specially appreciate the spanish subtitles. Thanks in advance for your effort!"
,lookingiswrong,2010-05-04T22:11Z,"Thanks for doing this Grandy. I've had your torrent page bookmarked for months waiting for the last seasons 4 and 5 to show up. Best on the web!

Interesting that the two-parter finale isn't split into two episodes like all the other seasons were."
,grandy88,2010-05-04T22:41Z,"No problem, enjoy.

I was kind of surprised too, but that's just how they came on the BluRay for seasons 4 and 5...one double episode instead of splitting it."
,EdotheHero,2010-05-08T04:55Z,I love you man you're awesome. thanks for all 5 seasons  :D cant wait till season 6 comes out on bluray. We need seeders though! c'mon people help  out. downloading all seasons at the same time rite now but one episode at a time from each. :)
,reever,2010-05-09T06:53Z,"Thanks again! I don't know how many other people would want them, but for the record, english subs would be nice."
,ndnenigma,2010-05-12T21:07Z,"hey CMCT you douche, no one likes seeing ur stupid chinese watermarks on your files... and grandy's quality is a lot better than urs so STFU"
,ndnenigma,2010-05-12T21:10Z,"btw grandy, r u still working on the subs for all the seasons?"
,grandy88,2010-05-12T22:42Z,"Working on it, but a little busy IRL at the moment and this is kind of my lowest priority (sorry).  Might be done in a few weeks."
,truenova,2010-05-15T09:00Z,"Great seires of downloads, I hope you will put up season six when it is released on bluray"
,whitejacket,2010-05-19T16:59Z,Any chance of seeing 1080p with full features (like English/Dutch subs incl)?
,grandy88,2010-05-19T18:52Z,"I can do 1080p if there's enough interest, but judging by the relatively mild interest in these 720p rips, I'm not sure how many would be interesting in downloading 1080p, considering each season would be probably 60GB+ if you want to keep the same quality.  

Go ahead and post if you're interested and I may get started."
,whitejacket,2010-05-19T20:31Z,"If u look extensively around for 1080p releases, u will come to the conclusion that Crtl-HD released some seasons and all aren't accesibly to download as a torrent but as RS and so on. For those which are available as a torrent, u will see that they are kept in private sites. I think if such thing would be released a lot of people would support it. I know I would. BTW if u are going to upload it after a while, could u also include full specs, i kinda find these incomplete. Major thanks for your realeases sofar.
Greetings Whitejacket"
,whitejacket,2010-05-23T18:18Z,"Seeing no response, can i conclude u won't do the 1080p?"
,moehunter,2010-05-25T04:47Z,"1080 another Vote here !!!  thats all I look for now, 
I'm not sure why ppl dwn load files with the quality only watchable on an I-pod??
in to much of a hurry & dont want 2 wait 4 quality files, if all seeded, be very quick!"
,McBobBob,2010-06-10T16:00Z,"1080p would be nice but 720p is pretty good,  what would be more awesome is the audio comm entries for the episodes that have them and i know lots of other ppl would want them as well. Could you do this plz?"
,guoslice,2010-06-23T11:20Z,hey when is the 720p version of season 6 gonna come out? :) thanks for the up though
,grandy88,2010-06-27T17:47Z,"Season 6 will be available on Blu-Ray on August 24th, so shortly after that.  Season 6 can be found in 720p elsewhere around here, but as a tv rip."
,MacGuyVer1,2010-07-03T23:16Z,"Excellent Rips! Thanks!

,reever,2010-07-20T16:32Z,Great rips. Any plans to upload english subs separately?
,Petro136,2010-07-29T04:37Z,Please upload somewhere subtitles.  Can be only English or all language you have. For this upload and other lost season you have up.
,gujit_ss,2010-08-02T03:04Z,"Great upload grandy88!!

is is possible to give us a few episodes in 1080p.. just to let us have a taste of perfection!
something like S01E01-02 (or my favorite s04e05).
not a stickler for subs, but Eng subs for the seasons would be fantastic!"
,rajka71,2010-08-12T17:13Z,"lost....... seasons torent, grandy88 many many thanks for you, what a work you really did good job, i love bonus and extras, can't wait for your LOST SEASON 6"

,correfcp,2010-08-31T17:25Z,"thanks grandy88 for the answer.

but you will rip ALL the bonus clips like the other seasons torrents that you made, right?

make sure that you rip ALL the bonus, because out there on the net the dvd-r doesnt have all the bonus, like the LOST ON LOCATION clips.
"
,grandy88,2010-09-02T02:12Z,I will do all of the bonus material.  I'll try to do English subs as well...
,roryt,2010-09-02T06:00Z,"hey correcfcp...kinda sounds like your telling grandy88 what to do, not asking him or saying thanks. WHy don't you try asking next time? The guy has put out the BEST rips of Lost you can find. He Doesn't deserve to be told what to rip and what not to rip.

grandy88 - thx for all the rips and I look forward to seeing season 6!"
,fluppe89,2010-09-02T11:59Z,"I agree with roryt.

First of all, THANK YOU GRANDY88!!!

Many people in the world love you for this, believe me!

I have just a little question: do you know where could I find English subs for your release? I tried many from the internet but they all seem to have bad timings.

Thanx!"
,FKoops,2010-11-30T20:55Z,"Thanks for all seasons! +1

Is there a possiblity that you could upload the other seasons matching subs?
