,latortugita,2010-06-12T00:10Z,"hey cezen,

was wondering if you could seed this one.  im stalled at about half-way.  

BTW, on a general note, im mentoring a twelve-year old who is way behind grade level and your phonics software has changed his life.  thank you for sharing.  "
[V],cezen,2011-11-30T05:45Z,You are welcome.  I am not sure how the seeds are doing and I don't have access to my original file anymore due to hardware burn out. :(  Thanks for the positive feedback.
