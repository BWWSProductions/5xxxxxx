"Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!"

Team 7, along with Kakashi Hatake, escort a ninja named Shibuki, the leader of his village, to his home at Takigakure. Shibuki is a coward, however, due to circumstances surrounding his father's death. The Hidden Village has a secret bottle of water called the "Hero's Water." The water imbues whoever drinks it with a dramatic, but temporary, increase in chakra. The effects are similar to opening a "chakra gate," in that it can shorten lifespan as well. Five missing-nin come to the village to steal the Hero's Water, and Team 7 defends against the incursion.
