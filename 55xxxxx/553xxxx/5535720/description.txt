FTP)  To prevent the Xbox from connecting to Xbox Live you can set up your 
      network as follows

      - Use an IP adress outside your routers DHCP IP pool
        If your router use 192.168.1.100-200 for DHCP you could use 192.168.1.210
      - Set up your computers IP as gateway.
      
      The XBox should be able to connect to your computer now but won't get
      access to the internet.
      
      If you have a second NIC just make a direct connection to be sure

      Use xbox:xbox@ip:21 to connect
