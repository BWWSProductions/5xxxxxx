,brynrocks,2010-05-04T19:07Z,"@djbiggins: Dude, you just proved that you are illiterate twice--once with your horrible grammar and again by leaving a comment that clearly shows that you did NOT read what I've written about this posting. Yes, this is a shite movie. That doesn't mean that there isn't an audience and that some people (like myself) aren't interested. Why else do I have 32 people downloading it after the torrent has only been posted 12 hours?"
