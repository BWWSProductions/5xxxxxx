Arm yourself with patience, because this is what I call ""jump-in"" (when small sized version haven't been released in XviD form). People who load my torrents in such occasions are in general newcomers or people who knows squat about torrents.
Later on, enjoy my friend. And please, say Hallo to your beautiful country."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-05T10:38Z,"Thanks sherynoshka. I do not like jump-ins 'cause they skew my tight schedule. I have V, Glee, NCIS and two movies as [quark] - Spy next door (DVDrip from Diamond) and Loosers (1.5GB DVDSCR). Busy day, as usual."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-05T12:36Z,"@ninapuss: Thank you for your kind words and you've shown big hart too.
As some of my friends from world of torrents  knew for years, I have very rare cancer and encoding and making people happy is pretty much all I have... I mean by that also - meeting nice people like you, for example.
""Is it poop or chocolate?"" - was in one movie.
I suggest you to wash your mouth anyway."

Blessings"
,honunet,2010-05-06T01:46Z,"ninaPUSS What have you given?  What have you created?  What have you made instead of try to tear down?  And I say try because all you have succeeded in doing is embarrasing yourself. If you are so awesome and enjoy laughing at people who share freely and willingly, then perhaps you can go buy the dvds or pay for premium cable.  Its obvious you are way too cool for us lowlifes here"
