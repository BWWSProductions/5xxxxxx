I recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
MP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video & AAC LC sound) .
recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768..
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones with Line In of any Stereo rack).
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).
