What's Spirit?
Spirit is an untethered jailbreak for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch on the latest firmwares. Spirit is not a carrier unlock. If you currently are using a tethered jailbreak, you have to restore to use Spirit. Do not upgrade if you use an unlock on an iPhone 3G or 3GS. (You can, however, restore to 3.1.2 if you have SHSH blobs for that version.)

Requirements: 
~ Any iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch on firmware 3.1.2, 3.1.3, or 3.2.
~ An activated device: one not stuck on the Connect to iTunes or Emergency Call screen.
~ Any version of iTunes 9 (including 9.1.1).
~ Syncing with iTunes before trying this is highly recommended. (An issue has been reported where Spirit deletes the photos on the device.
I will investigate this; in the meantime, please make sure your photos are backed up.)

Note: On iPad, all this is still sort of beta. Some packages in Cydia, not designed for iPad,might screw up your system and require you to restore. Be careful. (And no, Cydia's appearance is not final.)

~ Update (May 3): I've updated the jailbreak tool. It no longer deletes photos (sorry!) and should resolve the issue with error code c0000005. (If you still get that error with the new version, try setting compatibility mode to Windows 95.)
~ Source code will be available after the inevitable update.
~ For troubleshooting purposes, here is a little program to read the syslog (which the spirit installer writes a bunch of stuff to). If you don't know what this means, don't bother. http://pastie.org/942579
