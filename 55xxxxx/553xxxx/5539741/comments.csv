,ekarth22,2010-12-16T08:13Z,"*Solution* Splinter cell Conviction, not going past loading screen! I KNOW how to fix
Finally after wasting 5 hours, I figured out the solution, and I want to share it with the community 

When you play the game ""Splinter Cell:Conviction"" it doesn't get past the loading screen (i.e. the blackscreen and a nightvision-google keep rotating) Even if you meet the minimum system requirement!

Here is the solution:
(by Sam.G4m3R of ubisoft forum)

game stuck at loading screen because it just need to connect with the internet or the firewall itself is blocking, & this problem is suffered mostly who hasn't a NET connection. Surprised
so the LAN is disabled in their PCs.
just do 1 thing, enable the ""LAN"" (Local Area Connection) & u are done. [unplug the phone cable to prevent it from connecting)

To do that,
XP users - Go to ""My Network Places"" then in the left pane in network tasks go to ""view network connections"" & enable the Local Area Connection.

Vista/7 users - go to network & sharing center & in the left pane click on change adapter settings & enable the local area connection

i think Vista/7 users don't have this kind of problem
& if the problem still persists the check your firewall, mark the ""gu.exe"" & ""Conviction_game.exe"" in the exception list
i think this might helpful"
