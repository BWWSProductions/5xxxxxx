(Will) Owsley Discography (Semantics & Solo)(Plus Bonus Live & Extras)



R.I.P. April 30, 2010


Will Owsley (c.â€‰1965 â€“ April 30, 2010), known professionally as simply Owsley, was an American singer-songwriter, who worked as the guitarist in Amy Grant's touring band, but whose own albums won critical acclaim and one Grammy Award nomination. He was also a recording engineer and record producer.

Owsley played guitar from an early age. He was a fan of Kiss and of Todd Rundgren, but mostly practiced Eddie Van Halen licks note-for-note. With his father's mentorship, he played snare drum in his high school marching band, but he also continued his passion for guitar, playing in a jazz and top-40 cover band at local venues. Later, when he began writing his own songs, they were more similar to the style of The Beatles. As a guitarist, he also cited influences such as Chet Atkins and Robert Johnson.
