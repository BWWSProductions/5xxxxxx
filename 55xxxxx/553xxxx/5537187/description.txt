Various albums from the members of underground hip hop supergroup, Living Legends. Most are complete, but some I burned from my buddy and tracks were out of order, some had too few tracks and some had too many. All good stuff though.

Included albums:

Eligh:
-A Story Of 2 Worlds
-As They Pass
-Eligh and Magi
-Enigma
-Gandalf's Beat Machine Vol. 3
-Poltergeist
-Sidewaydaze


ENJOY!
