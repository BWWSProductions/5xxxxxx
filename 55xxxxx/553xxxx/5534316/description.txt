In the not so distant future, after years of economical exploitation, mother 
nature has become weak and her resources have been drained. The rainforests have 
all but disappeared and the ozone layer is almost depleted. Technology has 
become omnipresent. People are modifying their bodies, adding devices that 
enhance the "self". Slowly people start becoming aware of one question - are we 
using technology or is technology using us? You are a lowly maintenance worker, 
who is contacted by an underground movement known as the Resistance. They ask 
you to help them fight the Corporation, your employer. They need you gather 
information concerning the Corporations cloning plans and techniques, all under 
the guise of preserving the human race. As the levels progress you will be able 
to play as a "new breed" for the corporation and in the end play as a a "new 
breed" for the resistance against the corporation.
