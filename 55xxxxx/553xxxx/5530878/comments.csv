,ManLemon,2010-07-09T20:17Z,"Dude, excellent job. even if I personaly prefer the original Japanese language, its cool to have the english ones to make the not so forreign-oriented-friends happy. Thanks again :D"
,IXPLAGUEXI,2011-01-24T10:57Z,GET SOME SEEDERS IN THIS BITCH! ;O
,Echobeh,2011-02-26T09:48Z,Great quality. Only really downside is the fact you gotta manually change it to English audio for each episode every time.
,habafflof,2011-03-05T01:56Z,My favorite show! Thanks!
,MrAplin,2011-03-13T09:16Z,"Gracias man, just remembered this show tonight and now I have it"
,SirTobek,2011-03-18T14:24Z,"Really good quality, great to have the option of English audio or subs, thanks a bunch!"
,Mercer-6,2011-03-27T04:02Z,"for the occasional purist who think dubs are evil. It not that we don't like the Japanese, we're just lazy."
,Edgar88,2011-04-06T15:28Z,"Fucking awesome man, thanx!"
,platus.x,2011-04-09T21:28Z,"@Echobeh Sorry, I had to pick a language for it to default to, and the lipsync and sound mixing is better in the Japanese version (for obvious reasons) (The english dub is there because some people like it that way, and I'd rather not have to guess what version people want. Also, the wordplay goes by too fast in this story for people to get unless they're olympic readers.)

Thanks for the comments guys. I learned a few things from doing this. Apparently SRT subtitles are not the way to go. I'll use some flavor of substation next time (I had to pretty much hack in some of the subtitle colours) Also, Hand animating subtitles (mostly for BURA BURE, forget which episode) was gawdaweful. Also, I let some of the OCR's spelling mistakes slip through that I can't correct now, my bad.

I'll definitely take these into account when/if I can get my grubby little hands on the Blu-Ray version.

(Maybe I'll be able to add this to the torrent's description later if TPB's edit functionality comes back!)"
,Firebird284,2011-05-15T23:59Z,Thank You! 
,ManOfSkate,2011-08-07T23:56Z,"I appreciate your in-depth description very much. Too many times have I come across poorly described torrents. Thank you, downloading now. :)"
,Killer3474,2011-10-28T08:01Z,"Downloading now. It's a little slow (about 30min. to 1hr. with 12 seeds and 8/10 internet connection), but not as slow as the other ones. Quality is unknown right now so I'll come back when download is finished...

P.S.
SEED!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Killer3474,2011-10-28T08:56Z,"Back. Great torrent! The audio and picture are alright (Maybe not Hi-def, but alright). The subtitles are a little whack though, and Windows Media Player can't play it so I had to shit can WMP and use XBMC instead. XBMC works a lot better than Windows Media Player and looks nicer too so I would suggest that you guys get it.

Overall 8.5/10 for torrent. "
,Renzoruken,2012-04-26T06:16Z,"Awesome torrent! double thumbs up, FLCL has allways been a favorite of mine and now ive got my own copy =D."
