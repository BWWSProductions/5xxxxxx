,D0gmeat,2010-05-07T04:06Z,"To make a CBR, just pack your files into a RAR file and rename the extension to .CBR. :)"
,Calebus,2010-05-07T04:49Z,"Thanks Dog, but step by step though, like do I compress the image files?  and do I rename the file name? or is the extension something else completely. "
,ajones81,2010-05-09T00:23Z,"@Calebus:

1) Scan comic

2) Name scanned pages/images sequentially, as in ""Page 01.jpg"", """"Page 02.jpg"" and so on... (01, 02, ... is better than 1, 2, ... which can cause sequence errors wile viewing).

3) Use 7-zip (free) or WinRAR (shareware) to archive all the images as an RAR or ZIP.

4) Make sure file extentions are visible in Windows (if using Windows).

5) Rename ""Comic Title (c2c) (2010) (Calebus).rar"" to ""Comic Title (c2c) (2010) (Calebus).cbr"", or ""Comic Title (c2c) (2010) (Calebus).zip"" to ""Comic Title (c2c) (2010) (Calebus).cbz""

6) Create a torrent and share.

It's that simple! :)"
