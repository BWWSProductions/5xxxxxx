THIS IS A GEEK SQUAD CD LEFT IN A FRIENDS COMPUTER, GAVE IT TO ME THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD. BE CAREFUL VERY POWERFUL UTILITIES ARE ON IT, TO MANY TO LIST AS WELL AS TESTING PROGRAMS FOR  COMPUTER PARTS.THERE ARE NO VIRUSES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON THIS CD. REMEMBER TO SEED AND LEAVE COMMITS AND AS ALWAYS ENJOY.

IT HAS MULTIPLE VIRUS ENGINES AND MAL-WARE DETECTION SOFTWARE- THIS CAN CAUSE A FALSE POSITIVE- IF IN DOUBT RUN IN SANDBOX. 
BE ASSURED IT IS COMPLETELY CLEAN- 


no it is not cracked nor does it expire- if you mount the run f.a.c.e it updates all anti-virus engines-all 5 of them as well as 3 mal-ware  scanner.  cd version is 5.0.4

WARNING IT CAN MAKE A PIRATED COPY OF WINDOWS 7 COME UP AS NOT GENUINE. REAPPLY CRACKS AFTER THE SCANNERS AND ALL SHOULD BE WELL. I HAVE HERD THAT THE LOADER 1.6.9 BY DAZ WORKS WELL FOR THIS.
