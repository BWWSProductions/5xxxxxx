,allsop1,2010-05-04T04:17Z,THERE ARE NO VIRUS OF ANY KIND IN THIS ISO. I HAVE THEW CD IN MY HOUSE AND MADE THE ISO MYSELF. FALSE POSITIVES ARE COMMON BUT DO NOT SAY THERE IS A VIRUS WHEN THERE IS NOT. EVERY TORRENT I UP LOAD WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MANY ARE COMPLETELY  CLEAN

,sspazz35,2010-07-12T06:27Z,"Lets clear the air on a few things.nn1) Merjin is a developer of HiJackThis and CWshredder, just to name a few.  nn2) Go ahead and download ANY Geek Squad MRI on ANY torrent site and Merjin will be detected (unless the person uploading has removed it prior to uploading).  It is a false positive.nn3) And as far as the disc \""expiring\"", this is not totally true.  All it does is simply detect your computers time.  NOT the time in BIOS, but the stupid little clock on the taskbar. If you use this disc, and it tells you that it has expired, just set the calendar back 6 months at a time until it works.  Pretty easy.nnIt is a great disc to have and FACE has saved countless hours of manually removing viruses.  Just a tip:  If you have or are 100% positive that your PC hardware is all good to go, be sure to run only Scans With Removals.  If not, you will be waiting for a very long time.nnHow do I know this?  I, beyond my better judgment, worked for Geek Squad for about 6 months (part-time), while going to school.  I had to quit because I really couldn\'t stand to see people lied to anymore.  $220 for diagnostics and virus removals!! LOLOLOL nnEnjoy the disc."
,allsop1,2010-09-11T16:12Z,thank you for your post sspazz35. in so far as i know no this disc does not expire.  and it is a very useful disc to have 
,hackthese,2010-10-17T23:14Z,Okay can someone please tell me how to put this on a cd that can be booted.
,allsop1,2010-10-26T00:52Z,this is an iso so you should be able to use imgburn or another disc burning program or is you want use unetbootin to copy to a flash drive and to make it bootable.
,MrMacntosh,2010-11-22T23:08Z,"NEED SEEDS, very slow! To everyone who finds this of good use, please seed. Its just a geek squad CD, there is no copyright hounds tracking it.

As for the ""Viruses"". YES it detects a virus! BECAUSE it has antivirus built into it. Think about it as a vaccine... In order to successfully vaccinate somebody you need a SAMPLE of the virus. Thats what AVG is detecting... a SAMPLE of the virus which is stored in the Geek Squad virus remover."
