George Murray's fiancÃ©e Jane Gardner gets cold feet after accepting his ring, terrorized by her first wedding with Doug, who cheated that very day with their wedding coordinator.

After a car crash, George finds himself 10 years in the past, just days before Doug's day. And before he and his colleague-friend Harvey Blinton are to be cheated out of a brilliant career in advertising by sleaze-bag Jack Harrington.

However, every change to the past starts a whole series, not necessarily for the better.
