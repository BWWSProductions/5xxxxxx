           A hunter dressed in black. This cowboy-hat-wearing             
           samurai-sword-wielding Priest is on a quest for blood.         
           Vampire blood. He's out for revenge on a "clique" of four      
           vampires who are traveling across country in search of         
           "pure blood." The human blood stream has become polluted       
           by drugs, alcohol, Aids, Diabetes, anti-depressants,           
           cigarettes, anything that changes the blood even a small       
           amount makes it undrinkable for Vampires, who, like            
           hi-performance automobiles need "hi test" fuel= Blood in       
           order to survive. This has started a sort of underground       
           civil war between various groups of vampires and vampires      
           themselves have mutated due to the pollution of their          
           life blood. Live Evil is what is written on playing cards      
           left behind on the bodies of dead vampires that this           
           mysterious Priest/Hunter leaves in his wake as he gets         
           closer and closer to our main group of vampires. He's out      
           for revenge and the real reason for this is not revealed       
           until the very end. He's as cold blooded or more than the      
           vampire he seeks, because he has to be. The Leader of the      
           group of Vampires is Benedict, the "oldest' of the group       
           he's seen the rise and fall of the vampires and is out to      
           protect his small family of vampires. He's also in love        
           with one of the two females in his group, Sydney. Sydney       
           is a sexy but equally ravenous vampire who is becoming         
           more and more out of control. Yael is the youngest of the      
           group and the most enthusiastic and inexperienced, of          
           these vampires; her recklessness could threaten their          
           group's existence. Also part of the group is the acerbic       
           Baxter, an Irish former silent movie star, who became a        
           vampire in order to stay young forever only to have his        
           career ruined when sound films came in. His bitterness         
           and Yael's young enthusiasm create more tension for            
           Benedict to try to control. This clique is constantly          
           trying to find pure bloods for food and also on the run        
           from The Priest who gets closer and closer to them with        
           every mile as they travel to Los Angeles to find a Blood       
           Dealer, Max, a man who "pushes" blood stolen from              
           hospitals to vampire clients. In a wild opening sequence       
           car chase the Priest's car flips over and his right leg        
           is injured so severely that he must hijack a ride from         
           Roxy. A tough woman who doesn't know if the Priest is          
           just insane or if there really are vampires. As the two        
           grudging companions get to know each other The Priest          
           learns that Roxy is a "pure blood" and realizes that he        
           must do more than just seek revenge, he must not care for      
           another human being for the first time in his life.            
           Neither Vampires, nor Vampire Hunter Priest take               
           prisoners in this increasingly frenzied cat and mouse          
           game. It's a bloody trail of bodies, both human and            
           vampires, that climaxes in an abandoned church in the          
           barren desert.
