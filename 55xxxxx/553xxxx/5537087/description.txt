Band Info: Parikrama Is A Live Rock Band From Delhi, India.
They have several live performances 
and original numbers to their name. The band was officially formed on June 17, 1991 in Delhi. 
The word 'Parikrama' means 'orbital revolutions' in Sanskrit.                                                 
They are yet to release a full-length album, though they did release a free multimedia CD of their singles 
and videos in 2001. The band does not have any policies against their music being copied and distributed .
They have made their music available for download on their official website.
The band often fuses Indian classical music instruments like mridangam, tabla and flute 
with conventional instruments like guitar, drums and keyboards. 
They have been inspired and influenced by the likes of Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors.

The first song "Xerox" was named 'the face of Indian rock'.
Their first hit single "Till Iâ€™m No One Again" was released in 1995 along with "Open Skies". 
"But it rained", was released next year 1996. This song was dedicated to the kidnappings 
that had occurred in the Kashmir Valley, during that period.This song is probably their biggest hit. 
They were surprised when a crowd of 40000 sang along with them in their performance for the 
"Iron Maiden" concert in Bangalore. Another song - "Gonna Get It" was released in the same year.
Their sixth number in succession was released in 1997 by the name of "Load Up".
This band composed the song "The Superhero" for Bangalore only recently. 
This was in due course of the visit of Microsoftâ€™s chairman Bill Gates to the IT capital of India, Bangalore.
A Parikrama original "Rhythm and Blues" was created in course of their jam session with Usha Uthup.
Parikrama has recently released a few more originals like the 
Lord of the Rings-inspired "Am I Dreaming", "Tears of the Wizard" and "In the Middle".
Apart from "But it rained" another Parikrama original called "Vapourize" is a crowd favorite. 
"Vapourize" is a 7:30 minutes long song and features harmonized Guitar Solos with a Violin Solo.
