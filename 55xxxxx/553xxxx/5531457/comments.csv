,sinner62938,2010-05-04T02:26Z,"is  this english? and is it driect line audio or cam audio again?

i dunno what everyone else's definition of cams and telesyncs and whatnot are... but if u take a cam video with spanish cam audio, and put cam english audio over it, i still say cam video + cam audio= cam release... i never consider anything a telesync unless its got some sort of direct or line audio synced to it...."

,ericv1984,2010-05-23T09:21Z,"TELESYNC (TS): A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled."
