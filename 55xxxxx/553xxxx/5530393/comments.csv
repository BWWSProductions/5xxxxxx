,captainbarbossa,2010-05-04T00:34Z,English? Its kinda shady to know thats been the problem and push this out without letting people know... so Fake or Worthless...?
,captainbarbossa,2010-05-04T06:34Z,"This is English and def watchable. 
Id say V:6 A:7. I haven't checked the other copies yet but I dont think I have to. Thank you TvTeam Great up."
,TheArtz19,2010-05-04T13:36Z,"with that many seeders and leechers i would have expected at least a sea of ""is it real"" or ""a:v?""spam, let alone a few more thank you's.
lol, o well.
thanks for the upload and all your efforts in providing the new audio. i guess this movie must have been so good that all the people spamming the uploads before for eng audio just forgot to thank anyone."
,orgs,2010-05-05T01:47Z,This release is definitely the best one out there ... no baby crying and slightly better audio ... For whatever it's worth .... I downloaded and previewed 6 copies ... This is the one I decided to burn to disc. ..... Thanks to everyone who shares 
,solari1,2010-05-05T06:26Z,Audio is much improved from the previous English up.  I'd say it's about a 7 audio (old audio made it unwatchable) and 6 or 7 video.
,Fifle,2010-05-05T07:30Z,does anyone know why my download spikes constantly but does not stay at a constant speed on some torrent files? usually i download @ 490 kb/ps but right now my average is 15 kb/ps with spikes to 180 kb/ps.

,wzx3000,2010-05-11T20:06Z,"The video is not the best I have seen, but the sound is really good. I would rate it:
V: 6/10
A: 9/10
It looks like a TS or a really good CAM, but the audio is defiantly from another source than the cameras microphone."
,YuiSnape,2010-05-11T21:04Z,"Wow. This is really nice for a cam. Wherever the new audio is from really makes this watchable. Thankies to all involved.

A:8
V:6"

,MarcFirewing,2010-05-18T14:21Z,"TvTeam, never letting me down. Thanks for the torrent. Am downloading as we speak. :D"
,kludge420,2010-05-18T17:20Z,"People REALLY need to learn how to rate a video.

V:10 = BluRay
A:10 = 7.1 DTS

You don't slide the scale to the type of video. That makes the entire scale random and useless. Case in point some people have rated this a 9 audio while others rate it 6. That's a huge difference. Is this because the 9 is rating it, ""For a cam.""? Who knows, but it makes their rating suspect and I ignore it. In fact I have to think the exact opposite. If someone rates a cam a 9 then I assume they are a troll and purposefully mis-rating it. That or they are a total moron and should be ignored in either case."
,koka3,2010-05-23T12:46Z,"Thanks, not bad for a cam"
,amputate,2010-06-12T10:28Z,"Download speed: 1.8MB/s for me (yes that was less then 15mins DL)
Video: VERY good for a CAM... srsly, after a while you would almost forget it's a cam
Audio: it's also pretty good. sometimes a bit unclear but still good quality.

overall: Best cam out there! definitely download this one if you want to see Iron Man 2"
