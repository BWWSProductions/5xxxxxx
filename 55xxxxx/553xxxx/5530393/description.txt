Note:

well, 1stly thnx to both russian and romanians for sources, well, video was very orange in some effect, so lowered the saturation
down quite alot, then changed gamma, hue, and contrast for it to gather back control, then was onto colors, changed thema bit also,
did'nt want to edit colors too much due to would of looked dull, the romanian cam was Pretty damn good, however had bad angle, and 
really bad crop else would of used that...anyway added denoised filter to the video and a slight sharpness filter to not over sharpen
it...anyway to the audio, 1st 10 seconds we used russian no talking anyway, as that was not on the romanian cam, then synced the
romanian cam audio to the video and then used imagines audio for last 10 seconds, overall i think the audio is pretty good for cam
audio, Enjoy!
