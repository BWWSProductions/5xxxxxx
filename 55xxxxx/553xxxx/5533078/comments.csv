[V],twentyforty,2010-05-04T15:42Z,"Nope. Craig was on tour (just re-runs have been aired), there was TPB blackout when non-VIP members could upload nothing and now - I have second thoughts about whole [quark] idea because of insane number of hit and runs. Such torrents are dead within 48 hours or they have been seeded at speeds 1-3 kB/s what is worse than totally dead.
So - for the few people who busted their asses seeding to 30 ratios - is it worth? I guess [quark] offers savings about 14 GIGABYTES just for the talk-shows. However, problems (not mine or quark's) seems to outweighs the benefits.
Let see what would be. Probably nothing... bad."
