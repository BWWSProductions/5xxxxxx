@madtown: Yes, but WBZ screwing us all - it is NOT a DVDSCR, but mid-quality capture, wide-screen but with black-bars on top and bottom to make full-screen 720x480, blurry as hell, colors are washed, picture is dull and bad... bad...bad.
I have it in front of my eyes right now, trying to figure something out.
Maybe - maybe as [quark] 'cause ""this"" cannot be improved nor deserves anything more.

I have seen thousands better looking CAMs and TSes. At least I have tried and wasted few hours."
