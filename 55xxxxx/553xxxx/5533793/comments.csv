,BabieGurl,2010-05-13T06:29Z,"Seems like TPB trackers were not working properly for most of the torrents.

Havn't seen much from 'djfred' in a while or yourself. Not sure how long of a list you have of request, but if I may request the following:

-Legion
-District 13: Ultimatum
-Astro Boy

Thanks in advance."
