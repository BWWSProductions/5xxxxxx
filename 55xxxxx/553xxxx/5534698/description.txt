"Meet the Parent"

Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) and Jen (guest star Sara 
Foster) are back to wreaking havoc in each others 
lives and just when Naomi thinks she has the 
upperhand, Jen slaps her back into reality. Teddy 
(Trevor Donovan) invites a nervous Silver 
(Jessica Stroup) to meet his father, Spence 
(guest star Ryan O'Neal), for the second time and 
the meeting doesn't go quite as planned. Adrianna 
(Jessica Lowndes) struggles to write a new song 
for Laurel (guest star Kelly Lynch) and turns to 
Navid (Michael Steger) for support, forcing Navid 
to realize he still has feelings for her. 
Adrianna records a duet with Javier Luna (guest 
star/Latin recording artist Diego Boneta), a 
famous young pop singer, who quickly wins her 
over with his charm. Annie (Shenae Grimes) 
confronts Harry (Rob Estes) and Debbie (Lori 
Loughlin) about their recent marital problems, 
resulting in a family discussion about their 
future.

Enjoy :)
