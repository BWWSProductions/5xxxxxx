,hart37,2010-08-09T18:31Z,You're seriously bitching about a free IMAX film because it took 3 days? Pul your head out of your arse you wanker. Anyway thanks to DjAligator for the upload much appreciated
,Hvaz0r^,2011-04-17T18:34Z,"@hart37: I am so tired of the common misconception that one is not allowed be unsatisfied with things that are free.

Let me draw an analogy:

I tell you that I am going to give you a bag of candy completely free of charge (tracker announcement). Before giving you the candy I am playing around with you by pulling the bag away from you every time you try to grab it, every few hours I will take one piece out and throw to you (slow connection, long down-times etc.). I do this for days and then at last I give you the candy.

Using your mentality you can not say a bad word about me cause what I was giving you/not giving you was free.

If a person is in a situation where he cannot provide the file he announces in the search-database (or can but in an unreasonable amount of time) it's my opinion that his efforts are at better use somewhere else - on the internet or in real life. He clearly wants to do good!

Now 3 days for a 1080p film as a commenter wrties is not that bad (still too long to what I would call reasonable), but you also see people uploading torrents that will take months to complete. And then there's the ones that suddenly decide in the middle of it all that they don't think its fun to be an uploader anymore and let 300 people hang with uncompleted downloads. Don't say that people are not allowed to be unsatisfied with these things! These are actually examples of a lack of respect from the uploader."
