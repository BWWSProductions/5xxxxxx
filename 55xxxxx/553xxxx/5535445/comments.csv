@Stev: Yes, I have, first thing this morning. I was only afraid is that date on FB correct."
,newash,2010-05-05T13:08Z,"Thanks 2040!
Is there a chance to have s01e09 encoded by you as well?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-05T13:41Z,"@newash: I have encoded all episodes. 9th ep. was during last week's ""TPB non-VIP black-out"" but I manged to send my encoding to the regulars who left their e-mails.
You can do the same, open some secondary account whenever is good for you, post it here and I am sure that one of the guys will send you a link for direct download."
,newash,2010-05-05T14:26Z,"okay :)
would you guys, who has the previous (9th) episode, be so kind to drop me a link to na_temp@freemail.hu ?
i appreciate your help"
