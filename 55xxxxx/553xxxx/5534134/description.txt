 Release Notes
 -------------
 Source: DVDR [Thanks to a good friend!]

 This was given to us from a friend [Thanks Bro!],it was recorded on a home 
 DVR and burnt to DVDR. As it was really good quality for a PPV and didn't 
 see any of releases of this,we decided to go ahead and rip it. Did our usual 
 work to the video. Has hard coded subs for non English parts. Should have a 
 few more nice PPV's here in the very near future. Enjoy! =]
