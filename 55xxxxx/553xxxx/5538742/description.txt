Plot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) has grown unhappy with the apparent small-town Texas 
life of Friday night football and beauty pageant competition, the football 
championed by her father Earl (Daniel Stern) and the pageants by her mother 
Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden). She commiserates with her best friend Pash (Alia 
Shawkat) at their waitressing jobs. Pash has a plan to get out: she is applying 
to Ivy League schools. Bliss just wants to get out and needs a plan and a 
calling. She finds it during a shopping trip to Austin, Texas where she picks up 
a flyer for a Roller Derby event, schemes to attend, gets invited to try out and 
becomes Babe Ruthless, her alter-ego roller derby character. She makes the team, 
lies about her age, works hard to succeed, experiences her first love with the 
young lead singer of an Indie rock band, gets disappointed in love, bonds with 
her new family of roller derby girls, fights with her mother to escape the 
beauty pageant and live her new dream as roller derby star. She manages to 
reconcile all of this, impress and win over her parents and friends, and charts 
an ambiguous goal to move to Austin, continue with Roller Derby, and live her 
new life.
