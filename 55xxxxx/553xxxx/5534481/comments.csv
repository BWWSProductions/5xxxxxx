[V],poppedtart,2010-05-06T06:41Z,"guessing 25p video and 24p audio, something like that?"
,torrento_don,2010-05-14T10:19Z,"vlc, mpc, divx i've tried all. the audio seems to  have a glitch. i've played 1080p movies flawlessly, but this one is pretty rough."
,torrento_don,2010-05-14T11:27Z,"works fine on gom player, it had to download dts+ac3 filter for the sound. flawless quality .bone."
