to convert the m4b file, if that helps any newbies out there. 

Great upload, been looking forward to this book."

,vertigo85,2010-09-18T03:33Z,this torrent says it chaptered....i dowloaded it and its one giant audiobook over 9 hours long! its not cut up into chapters. does anyone know where to find one thats cut up already?
,DQ78,2011-01-13T21:16Z,"I got one upload that is chaptered - and way better quality than this one! 

It's my first torrent though, I have it my program and it says it's ready to seed, but I can't seem to see it here on PB. If anyone would like to try and give me feedback it would be great.
