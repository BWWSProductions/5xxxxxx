The Wayfarers  (Not to be confused with the Wayfarers Trio)

I am missing their only other album "Come Along with the Wayfarers" (1963) If anyone has it PLEASE share!

Members: Sean Bonniwell, Ray Blouin, Dick Bailey and Tom Adams

Having weathered various changes over the years, Sean Bonniwell remains active in the music business. In a 1997 interview, Bonniwell said that "...Ray Blouin, the banjo player of the Wayfarers, is a professor of economics in Virginia", and bass player Tom Adams has been presiding for many years as a judge in Santa Barbara County, California.

Guitarist Dick Bailey continued to play music, and in the 1970's was part of a Charleston, SC bluegrass trio, 'Beresford Creek', that included Ray Blouin. They released an LP in 1977. 

Bailey (Died 1988) also co-owned a club in Charleston called 'The Whale's Tail', where he would often play.
