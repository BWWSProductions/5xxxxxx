,dojeedave,2010-06-09T18:56Z,seems a strange thing to do though.  maybe just my NOD doesn't like me putting half done files through VLC..
,mike9052,2010-06-11T19:12Z,That does seem an odd thing to do. And I can't even remember doing it!
,blackscribe,2010-08-10T15:56Z,Scanned with Avira and Malwarebytes. No virus. Great upload. Thanks!

,Ajani3456,2011-03-10T00:23Z,"There's an error in track 9, it's supposed to only last 4 minutes not 6, and also it's damaged (especially when played in iTunes)"
,robofet,2011-07-01T20:33Z,not too good. MmmHmm (feat. Thundercat) is messed up (keeps repeating). there is a short but noticeable gab between songs. also there seems to be some strange filter that takes out a couple of high frequency ranges.
