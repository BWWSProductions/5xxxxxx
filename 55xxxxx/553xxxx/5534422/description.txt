"Taking the innovation of a â€œcontempo-noiseâ€ alternative genre and joining it with the fundamental excellence of bands like Converge, Deadguy and Zao, Wrench In The Works has honed a style of progressive music that is genuinely unique and savagely majestic. A sound which is brutally aggressive joins with well-written metal-influenced-hardcore to show its unabashed rebellion against the genreâ€™s restricting conventions. As experimental metal begins to flow with the mainstream, Wrench In The Works desists from the gimmicks that plague the stage during so many metal-hardcore hybrid shows, allowing the unconventionality of their writing to shine through.

Wrench In The Worksâ€™ accomplishments have exceeded the status quo of the average underground band.  The band released their Facedown debut â€œLost Art of Heaping Coalâ€ in 2008.  Now, with seemingly limitless ingenuity and passion, members Andy Nelson, Greg Thomas and Darrell Tauro will continue shattering eardrums as well as genre barriers as they write and record for their sophomore Facedown release â€œDecrease/Increaseâ€ due out February 2010."



One of my personal favorites on Facedown Records.They have a new CD out called Decrease/Increase,but I don't have it yet.I might upload that too whenever I get a copy if anyone is interested.
