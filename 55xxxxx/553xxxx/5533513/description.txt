   The President of the United States is on a journey home after making a
   speech in Moscow. But on the journey, Russian hi-jakers take over the
    plane, disguising themselves as newspaper reporters. They want the
    President to ring Moscow and release General Redek. But they think that
    the President has escaped in the pod. But the president is really still
    on board air force One attempting to regain control of the plane and to
    rescue his wife and daughter.			        Dilen Foster@imdb

    PROPER NOTES: Prior release by PJDiVx had an aspect ratio of 2.65:1 and
                  was not IVTC'd properly, sample is included. Very low
                 bitrate but this looks very good into 1CD.
