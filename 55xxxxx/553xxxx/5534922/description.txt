40 years later after The Beatles split up and still these great songs and so many others have never been released on an album so Iâ€˜d just decided one day to just create one myself.... 
All songs found on all 4 corners of the internet and remastered by me. 
The album runs 80mins and is converted from wav-(809mb) to flac-(386mb) for a faster download. Disc two is due up sometime at the end of 2010 so if you have any suggestions or requests feel free to add a comment. 
Enjoy....

P.S. 
TEAR DOWN THE VAULTS!
