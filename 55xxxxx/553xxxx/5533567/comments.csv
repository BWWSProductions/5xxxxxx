,oxycodone,2010-05-05T06:34Z,can we get some info on the video/audio streams please. codec/resolution/ar/source. thnx
,lydonit13,2010-05-05T16:11Z,"I agree with oxycodone, is this x264/AC3 in a m2ts container?

Also, what is the benefit of m2ts over the more common mkv container?

Finally, why 3.99GB?  A single layer (DVD5) disc can hold 4.37GB.

I'm not trying to be a smart-ass.  I'd just like to know more about this unfamiliar file format."
,platoonHD,2010-05-06T15:06Z,the reas0n for 3.99 is so that it stores easy on a fat32 hdd...yes its ac3 ...very good quality enjoy
