,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-05T06:26Z,"My speakers are fine.  That's actually how I noticed that this was a bad rip.  Listening to it on my PC sounded ""okay"", but as soon as I listened to it in my car or on my head phones I noticed that your upload suffered the same problem as the others that I've tried.  No high end on most of the songs and just a bland sound altogether.

I did find a nice CD quality rip on here though.

This copy sounds perfect.

Thanks for the upload, but I just personally can't stand listening to something that sounds this bad.

No offense to you though."

It's actually this one that sounds great.

Thats good if you find a good rip . To me mine rip is good but all have different point of view , neways if you like that much then you should buy the album instead of downloading.

thanks
