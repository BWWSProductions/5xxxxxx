Shooting Gunless 

Behind the scenes of the 2010 Canadian film "Gunless".

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is very watchable in my opinion. 

Gunless is the story of a hardened American gunslinger (Paul Gross) who is repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to mount a showdown in a friendly town in Canada where no one seems to understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West.
