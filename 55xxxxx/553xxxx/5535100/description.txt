  From the artist:

  By day, Max Williams is a humble chef and model citizen. 
  However when the sun sets, a chemical imbalance in his brain causes 
  him to immerse his ears in filthy, broken, distorted madness and become 
  the much loathed, Dan Score, intent on spreading breakcore into the ears 
  of Abba fans everywhere. Currently residing in Manchester, UK
