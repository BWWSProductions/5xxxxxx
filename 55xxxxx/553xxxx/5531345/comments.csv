Problem #1: Splinter Cell: Conviction PC encounters System Validation error / crash

Possible Solution #1: (By Catgoth from the Steam Forums and Exile.Luciola from the Ubisoft forums)

I THINK I got in. Rename systemdetection.dll to systemdetectionbackup.dll

This causes an error to not find the file, BUT, the Ubi Launcher launches and allows you to log in. Goody.

All this Validation does is make sure your machine can run your game in the first place. Durr.

The aformentioned .dll can be found in

dir

C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\tom clancy?s splinter cell conviction\src\system

Now all you have to do is cross your fingers and pray you get past the ?Establishing Connection? screen, which is the beloved DRM.

Possible Solution #2: (By sam2000_290 from the Ubsoft forums)

I got it to work by launching the uplaybrowser.exe. I don?t know, I just ran this, told me to login and then the game starts. Or maybe, b/c after I clicked the launcher, it finally shows up when I clicked the uplaybrowser.exe. I don?t know, give it a try.

Problem #2: Splinter Cell: Conviction encounters constant game crashing / crashes and graphics glitches

Possible Solution #1: (By FredEx919, Ubisoft technical support)

Hello all, If you have an ATI ( graphic ) card and are running into performance issues, make sure you have the latest display drivers and also try downloading this ATI hotfix ( ATI Catalyst 10.4a driver ) before playing and retry.

Possible Solution #2: (By rinks361 from the Ubisoft forums)

Well I finally found a solution that works for me so far. I rolled back the ATI driver to 8.10 (many sites say that many issues didn?t arise until after that driver) and so far the game runs great. I am actually pretty far in now.

Problem #3: Splinter Cell: Conviction PC encounters random crashing / crashes / freezes / freezing / lock ups / CTD / crash to desktop while playing on a laptop

Possible Explanation: (By KingDanielO from the Ubisoft forums)

according to the Official game requirements, it says ?Laptop models of these cards may work but are not supported?.

Problem #4: Splinter Cell: Conviction encounters wired controller problems ( wrong button mapping)

Possible Solution #1: (By betaleg from the Ubisoft forums)

According to Ubisoft customer service, if you download the Xinput driver it should fix the problem with wired controllers. I downl"

The video res is so so so BAD it ruins the game. Thats how they make these games so small. My advice is just wait a bit longer and download a retail version off of the top groups :) ITS SOOOO MUCH BETTER!!!
,dave73,2010-05-07T00:20Z,I thought i`d try this rip as it has no info on what was ripped but as soon as i started it up i uninstalled and got retail much much much better :D

But pretty much this virus poses as a virus scanner, but will disable many crucial processes such as task manager, control panel and properties. It also does eventually blacken out your entire user interface as well so you can use windows either. If you manage to open task manager you can temporarily disable it by shutting down the process iexplore (fake name).

,ekarth22,2010-12-16T08:13Z,"*Solution* Splinter cell Conviction, not going past loading screen! I KNOW how to fix
Finally after wasting 5 hours, I figured out the solution, and I want to share it with the community 

When you play the game ""Splinter Cell:Conviction"" it doesn't get past the loading screen (i.e. the blackscreen and a nightvision-google keep rotating) Even if you meet the minimum system requirement!

Here is the solution:
(by Sam.G4m3R of ubisoft forum)

game stuck at loading screen because it just need to connect with the internet or the firewall itself is blocking, & this problem is suffered mostly who hasn't a NET connection. Surprised
so the LAN is disabled in their PCs.
just do 1 thing, enable the ""LAN"" (Local Area Connection) & u are done. [unplug the phone cable to prevent it from connecting)

To do that,
XP users - Go to ""My Network Places"" then in the left pane in network tasks go to ""view network connections"" & enable the Local Area Connection.

Vista/7 users - go to network & sharing center & in the left pane click on change adapter settings & enable the local area connection

i think Vista/7 users don't have this kind of problem
& if the problem still persists the check your firewall, mark the ""gu.exe"" & ""Conviction_game.exe"" in the exception list
i think this might helpful"

I HAD ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT... TRIED EVERYTHING I KNEW ABOUT GAMES AND IT DIDN'T WORK.... SHOWED ME ALL KINDS OF VIRUSES AND SHIIIT....

THEN I TRIED THIS...

extract
open setup.bat
tptb graphic will appear - press esc
in the cmd window press any key to begin - press any key
wait
DISABLE RESIDENT SHIELD IN AVG ANTI VIRUS 

AND THEN YOU ARE GOOD TO GO... WORKS JUST FINE... I'M PLAYING IT RIGHT NOW...

THANX sanmail AND Lobotomite

CHEERS AND ENJOY THE GAME"
