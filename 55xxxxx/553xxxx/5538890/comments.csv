,EViLOPTiC,2010-05-06T15:54Z,Awesome :) Hurray for the russians and their fast sandbox :)

,Tilatus,2010-05-06T18:30Z,"Looked around a bit and this probably is not a fake. There is a real alpha build around, but it's really buggy and you can only use it with sandbox, so there really is no point trying it, really."
,j0eStER,2010-05-06T19:35Z,"OMG this thing is soo not fake!
I just tried it and downloaded the SandBox.

Instructions:

1. Go to ""World of Warcraft Beta\Data\enUS""

2. Open up Realmlist

3. 
set realmlist 127.0.0.1
set patchlist 127.0.0.1
set realmlistbn """"
set portal 127.0.0.1

COPY AND PASTE STEP 3!

4. Open up SandBox in the WoW Folder.

5. Login to any Username and PW."
,kazso2,2010-05-06T19:39Z,This is the official US Cataclysm Alpha client installer. Definitely not fake.
,ueffes,2010-05-06T21:32Z," This update requires ""WLK"" version 3.3.0.10944.
What do ? WoW Updater patched on 3.3.0.11159 "
,1Haggis1,2010-05-07T03:03Z,"Can you have an US and a GB client of wow installed at the same time?
Figure this doesn't work for me since I use the GB client >."
,daEiK,2010-05-07T13:26Z,"its not fake. its the alpha installer for cataclysm.
however you need us client of wow installed."
,IDDQD-IDKFA,2010-05-07T15:07Z,@qryhme = blizzard troll
,kazso2,2010-05-07T17:54Z,"@ueffes The Alpha installer requires 3.3.0.10944 or LATER. It will install on the newest version of Lich King.
@1Haggis1 Yes, you can have enGB and enUS version at the same time. However you need to manually change folder names and/or registry keys to ""trick"" the installers.
The way i did this (enGB already installed):
1. Rename the ""World of Warcraft"" folder to ""World of Warcraft enGB"". This way the enUS installer won't find wow.exe, so it will allow to install the game (again).
2. Install the enUS version to the same folder, where the enGB version was earlier (""World of Warcraft"").
3. Install the Cataclysm Alpha to the default folder (""World of Warcraft Beta"").
4. Rename ""World of Warcraft"" to ""World of Warcraft enUS"", and rename ""World of Warcraft enGB"" back to ""World of Warcraft""."
,zack030394,2010-05-11T01:15Z,@ j0eStER Whats a sandbox ? And how do I get one :P ?
,zackthewack1,2010-05-11T22:58Z,"This works. I was just playing a few minutes ago. There is a download a couple links below this one that says ""Sanbox 1.0"" or something like that at the end. 

Download that torrent and this one and you'll be good to go.

-Download the Sandbox
-Install this
-Run Sandbox (should be on your Desktop after you extract it)
-Open up the World of Warcraft Beta folder and find WoW.exe
-Run WoW.exe (NOT THE Launcher.exe)
-When the game starts up, login with any username and password. Just make sure the username and password are the same. For example: 
Username - 123456 
Password - 123456
-It should load the game up and then you will have to make a character. I suggest sticking with the one it starts you with. Don't change the class or anything because the client will either crash or you will spawn and fall forever.


Have fun :)

Note: There are no NPC's and the compass doesn't work. You pretty much just run around."
,zackthewack1,2010-05-11T23:00Z,"@zack030394

The Sandbox for this torrent is a couple of links down like I said in my above comment.

In general a sandbox is something where you can run programs in so you don't get viruses on your computer.

For example let's say you download a torrent or a game and you think it might be infected with something. Well, run the launcher in the sandbox to protect your computer from being infected.

To get a sandbox, just google ""sandboxie""

It should be the first link. Download and install. Usually to run programs in the sandbox, all you have to do is right click them and then Run Sandboxed.

Again, DO NOT RUN THIS SANDBOXED! There is a certain sandbox that you use for this to work. "
,jhgamer,2010-06-07T20:21Z,"@zackthewack1

So I installed the sandbox like you said, and when I try and open WoW.exe with it. It just says ""Failed to  open archive common.mpq"" anything I can do about that? also if I try to open the launcher it says ""Launcher requires write permission to the C:/...ect directory to successfully patch the game. Please enable write access to the directory using an admin account."" and I am using an admin account."
