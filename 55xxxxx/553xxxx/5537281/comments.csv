[V],Morck22,2010-05-06T15:11Z,no pasword protected
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-05-06T16:40Z,My d/l will be done in 5min. I'll let you know whetherr it's good or password protected...
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-05-06T16:54Z,"Well it's not passworded... So let's all remember we can't trust Daveb125-'cuz he's a douche. Bad news it's super harsh quality. sound is horrible, but i was going to add good English audio to it anyway, however this video is rotten and blinding and useless. I can't beleive Morck22 was willing to put his name on this."
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-05-06T16:59Z,"Not passworded.. Horrible copy. Can't beleive you put your name on this Morckk, I think you're better than that.. I won't say anything bad about you, but i won't thank you for this either -there's allready a bunch of Krap copies out."
,roedie,2010-05-06T17:00Z,"this is not worth the effort...
non-english, i dont understand why peoply would want to see a movie without original voices... too stopid to understand english, or just too lazy to read the subs?
sound is very bad en picture ... bleh"
,jamespence,2010-05-06T17:18Z,This IS the actual movie but it is a CAM and it is in SPANISH and it is very BLURRY.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ENGLISH.
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-05-06T19:56Z,"Just downloaded and checked out this one: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5539007/Iron_Man_2_V2_Encode_SAFCuk009

It looks watchable, much better quality, AND is English!!"
,JAXXBOSS,2010-05-07T15:40Z,"You ALL should have known this wasnt a screener as there is NO SUCH THING AS A TS SCREENER.

Again, NO SUCH ANIMAL AS A TSSCREENER."
