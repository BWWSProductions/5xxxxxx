Lauryn Hill - MTV Unplugged No.2(2001) DVDRip x264 FLAC AC-3(DD 5.1)-PatruDoi.mkv
	
DVD Released: June 11, 2002


	MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 is a live album by American hip hop/soul artist
 Lauryn Hill. The performance comes from her 2002 MTV Unplugged special
 recorded on July 21, 2001 at MTV Studios in Times Square, New York City.
 
 
	Album Theme/Content
The album is lyrically driven where Lauryn shares her thoughts on religion, 
 society, God, and love. All songs are written by Hill except for So Much 
 Things to Say (Bob Marley) and The Conquering Lion (traditional adaptation).

	Chart performance
MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 peaked at #3 on Billboard's Billboard 200 chart, and
 peaked at #2 on the magazine's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[1] In the UK,
 it charted at #50. The album was certified platinum in June 2002. The song
 "Mr. Intentional" reached #63 on the French Singles Chart.

	Critical response
Unlike the near-unanimous praise of Miseducation, 2.0 sharply divided critics.
 AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the recording "is the
 unfinished, unflinching presentation of ideas and of a person. It may not
 be a proper follow-up to her first album, but it is fascinating."[11] Slant
 Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote, "Hill's guitarwork is multi-textured and
 fine-tuned but her vocals lack confidence and seem to toe the edge of her
 range throughout the album. And though the stripped-down nature of the
 show is fitting, many of the songs sound as if they are still in their
 infancy."[12] Despite the mixed reviews, 2.0 debuted at #3 on the
 Billboard 200 and went platinum four weeks after its release.
