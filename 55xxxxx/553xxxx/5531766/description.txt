Portuguese Irregular Verbs is the first book in Alexander McCall Smithâ€™s The 2 Â½ Pillars of Wisdom series sometimes called the Igelfeld trilogy.  This is the unabridged version read by Hugh Laurie.  228 minutes.

Personally, I thought the book was just okay, but the audio version is hilariously dramatized by Hugh Laurie complete with a myriad of accents and characterizations.  

From Amazon.co.uk:
Alexander McCall Smith, best-selling author of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has turned his hand to humour. The delightful result is a creation of comic genius. For in the unnaturally tall form of Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, we are invited to meet a memorable character whose sublime insouciance is a blend of the cultivated pomposity of Frasier Crane and of Inspecteur Clouseau's hapless gaucherie. Von Igelfeld inhabits the rarefied world of the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, a world he shares with his equally tall and equally ridiculous colleagues, Professors Florianus Prinzel and Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. Their unlikely adventures are described in three deliciously funny instalments: Portuguese Irregular Verbs, The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs and At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances.
