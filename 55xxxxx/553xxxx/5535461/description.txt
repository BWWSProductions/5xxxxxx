BadBlockRemapper Helper for NandPro v0.2 by Nknave/Krizalid

Changes from v0.1 to v0.2

- Added nandchk v2.3 to avoid using 360 Flash Tool During the Process.
- Fixed a couple typos and made the script a little more stethic.
- You now have to enter the names of your source and target file.
* Source being the retail file that has bad blocks
* Target is the file that will be flashed to your console
* Name must be in this form: "nandname.bin" without quotes.

Since we haven't had any updates with Badblockmover
I decided to script a little batch file for my needs 
and I like to share it with you all.

I know, it's no super code, but it's something to 
help those who are struggling with bad blocks using
Freeboot and suffer remapping manually.

- Supports FreeBoot v0.03x, XBR, etc.
- Supports all 16MB and 66MB dumps
- Strongly recomend NANDPro2b for virtual files.


How does it work?

It will go in the following steps:

- Will ask for NAND size

- Will ask for bad block ID (example: 11d is bad on orig.bin;
* will dump 11d from updflash.bin and zero out this block).

- will ask for target block ID (example: 11d will be flashed to 
* specified block like 3FF)

Will loop untill you have remapped all bad blocks.


Intructions:

- Unpack this package to the root of nandpro folder.

- make sure nandpro.exe is the executable name

- make sure your freeboot image is called updflash.bin
