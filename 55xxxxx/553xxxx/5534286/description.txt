Derrick May - Music LiveBBC 6 Music Programmes 6 Mix 02/05/2010

6 Mix celebrates the May Day weekend with a brand new mix from techno pioneer Derrick May. Derrick - best known for his 1987 dance anthem Strings of Life under the name Rhythim Is Rhythim - has been an iconic name on the techno scene for over twenty years, DJing worldwide to a devoted fan base. Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, May's work - alongside fellow DJs Juan Atkins and Inner City's Kevin Saunderson - has provided the catalyst for a number of producers worldwide. In his latest 6 Music show Derrick plays a selection of tunes which have influenced and inspired him including tracks by Brian Eno, Peven Everett and Model 500. There's also a brand new 'Mayday' club mix featuring hot new material from his label - Transmat Recordings - and a selection of tracks of Derrick's favourite album of 2010 so far; Gil Scott Heron's 'I'm New Here.'.
