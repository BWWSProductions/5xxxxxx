Description:

Children learn about art in many ways, from viewing art by famous artists to creating art themselves. Art needs to be accessible to all audiences, including children with disabilities. The following programs allow children with disabilities equal access to art appreciation and participation. These programs teach children about art by showing them pieces by well-known artists. They also give them the opportunity to create artwork of their own to hang on the refrigerator or share with loved ones. TheArt Lesson by MECC blends Tomie DePaola's story "The Art Lesson" with 14 art activities. It is a CD-ROM for Mac or PC computers.While children and adults of all ages would enjoy the animated story, the program is geared toward 5-12 year olds. The story features Tomie, a first grader who loves to draw. The story is interactive and animated. It also has a spoken narrative so reading is not required. The art activities are presented one at a time, so they do not overwhelm the young artist. Activities using paint, chalk, colored pencils, and crayons are available. There are also more unusual activities such as putting a face on a jack-o-lantern or creating a leaf collage. The book and activities can be accessed with a mouse, KidPoint or a touch screen; however, straight lines are difficult to make when using a touch screen. For Windows/Mac
