"TOO MUCH ATTITUDE AND NOT ENOUGH UNDERWEAR"

When a friend from their Iraq days shows up unexpectedly, 
Veronica (Taylor Schilling) and Sands (James Tupper) are 
suddenly faced with a life-altering decision. Sonia 
(Jaime Lee Kirchner), increasingly intimidated by a 
stalkers threats, gets help from a surprising source, 
while Chloe (Michelle Trachtenberg) worries that her 
boyfriend is causing irreparable brain trauma by playing 
football against medical advice. And, after Angels 
(Guillermo Diaz) friend is brutally beaten, Briggs (James 
Van Der Beek) worries that his mafia connections may have 
played a role. Meanwhile, a former flame (Jennifer 
Esposito) comes back into his life, with dangerous 
consequences.

Enjoy :)
