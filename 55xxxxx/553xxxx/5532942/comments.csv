,dp812,2010-05-05T13:42Z,Couldn't disagree more. I thought Iron Man 2 was amazing. Upped the ante on almost every front and did it perfectly. This is Marvel's Dark Knight.

,partykid,2010-05-12T17:04Z,Movie was decent but didnt compare to the first one. was a bit of a let down but still enjoyable
,ComedicGenius,2010-06-03T09:28Z,"It is very rare that a sequel is as good as it's predecessor. Origin movies are always super exciting because of the learning of how it all started. In comic book movies, it always nerve racking to see if they keep it close to the original story. As for Iron Man II, I agree with you guys, it was a great 2nd film. I personally like Cheadle (spelling) as Roadie way more then Howard. I'm just antsy to see what they do with the 3rd one, I'm also incredibly impressed with the fact that they are going to wait until after Avengers to do the 3rd one...and hope as well that they stick with the story of the Avengers hunting the Incredible Hulk as the origin story for that and get Edward Norton back ... one can hope!"
