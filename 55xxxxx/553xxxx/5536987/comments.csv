20 seconds but is in sync after"
,casstin,2010-05-07T08:04Z,Don't waste your time with this garbage release. There's 3 letters in the upper right corner the through the WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE!! It's distracting as fuck.
,Stonedmonkey0056,2010-05-08T06:44Z,"@casstin. Dude, it's a fucking screener. MAJORITY of the time, screeners do have watermarks, so cry more IMO. "
