Been searching for the lyrics everywhere and can't find them. Could you scan and include the lyrics, please? Thanks for your care and kindness.

God bless you always, Charles!"

You're very, very welcome. Yes, this is a really good quality remastering effort, even if I do say so myself. Considering that this album was never released on CD, it makes it very rare. If you tinker with audio editing programs, you can take a look at the wav files in a spectral analysis tool and see that the fidelity is very, very close to true CD caliber.

I'll see if I can hunt down that cassette and see if it has lyrics printed on the cassette insert. I've moved since that project was completed, so goodness knows where my old tapes are stogged away at now. I do give my word to make an effort though.

Thanx & God Bless,
Bro. Charles"
