RE: Morgan Cryar - Keep No Secrets (Snivlle Remastered Edition)

Greetings in the lovely name of Jesus!

Brothers n' sisters, here's another rare gem. This is an audio remastering
project that took many hours of careful audio restoration, using high quality
(pro-grade) software, to accomplish.

The audio source for this project was an original cassette tape, that was
still in very, very good condition. My signal chain is simple, but the
quality of the components used is relatively high. AIWA 3500 (3 head)
deck ->> Teac EQA-5 (10 band) Class A EQ. Editing & restoration finalized
in CoolEdit Pro 2.1 & Waves DX Plug-ins.

This album was never released on CD. There are some LP-Rips of it to be
found, that are quite good. However, I am confident that you will really
enjoy this version and prayerfully, you will notice that it is virtually
noiseless and yet it RETAINS transparent, hi-fidelity sound.

This is a NERO CD Image file.

God Bless U,
Luv in Christ,
Bro. Charles (aka "snivlle")
