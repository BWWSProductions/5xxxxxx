,76dragon,2010-05-06T16:15Z,"@ctang, thanks for uploading that. Also delete this folder at Part 1:
/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher

A few notes additional notes to part 1 of the post:

- / is the system root folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the hard drive icon at devices)

- ~ is the User folder (which you can find in Finder by clicking on the home icon at places)

- You don't have to remove old installations. However, I strongly recommend to at least delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" and ""/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher"" folders and re-enter the relevant serial upon opening an Adobe application. By keeping your old FLEXnet Publisher folders you may run into licensing errors.

- Obviously, if you're attached to your old Adobe application preferences, don't delete the preferences files in the system and User libraries. There is no harm in doing so, they'll be automatically regenerated but by deleting them you will loose your user preferences. I prefer to start with a clean system but that may not be the case for everybody.

* You can find the Adobe CS5 package (excluding Acrobat) on The Pirate Bay. Search for ""Adobe CS5 Master Collection [MAC]""

* Download Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro (not included in the CS5 torrent). On the Demonoid website search for ""Acrobat Pro 9.0 + 9.1 Update + SN""."

,jlie69,2010-05-07T19:48Z,"@76dragon i have just installed photoshop cs5 and now i want to install illustrator... do i have to still delete all those adobe files be4 installing illustrator, and what will that do with my photoshop?"
,76dragon,2010-05-07T20:45Z,"@jlie69 I already wrote the answer to your question in my post above:
- You don't have to remove old installations and can use new and old installations side by side. However, I strongly recommend to at least delete the ""/Library/Application Support/FLEXnet Publisher"" and ""/Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher"" folders and re-enter the relevant serial upon opening an Adobe application. By keeping your old FLEXnet Publisher folders you may run into licensing errors."
[T],ctang,2010-05-07T22:38Z,"@jlie69: you are doing exactly what i did...all you have to do is disconnect from the internet, install Illustrator CS5 (as trial) and quit it if it opens after installation...it should work if you have already done all of the instructions to install photoshop CS5

enjoy"

,MaifunN,2010-06-27T20:05Z,"Hello,

Just to verify, when removing old Adobe files, does this include programs unrelated to Illustrator itself? I have a cracked PSE 8 and I'm curious if this is still a necessary removal step before the Illustrator installation. Thanks"
[T],ctang,2010-06-28T06:14Z,"that depends...did the crack work just as this workaround did or not...if not then probably do a complete uninstall of PSE 8 and install this, then just reinstall your cracked PSE 8 and you shouldnt have any problems...good luck and leave a comment about how it goes"

,greyskiesblack,2010-08-27T02:52Z,"Okay, I'm really new to downloading torrents. When it finished downloading I just have the .rar file. How do I acquire the dmg file? I don't see it after downloading."
,EKK622,2010-09-03T05:18Z,"Downloaded it and followed the steps and it worked perfectly. The step to stop communication between the servers may be unnecessary, but I still did it.

GreySkiesBlack- After you download the torrent and have the .rar file you want to use a .rar/.zip extractor to pull the files out of it (I treat .rar and .zip files with the application called 'Zipeg'). After that you just follow the steps and you should be good to go."
,killbush,2010-10-06T00:34Z,Thanks!
,cpearce,2010-10-22T20:19Z,"HELP!

,jaredkent,2010-11-20T01:24Z,"I was just curious if I'll need to uninstall Photoshop. I have a CS4 version that I torrented. It was a hassle to find a working torrent and I'm not really looking to uninstall it and 1) find out that I can't get this torrent working, or 2) not be able to find the Photoshop torrent again.

In the instructions it talks about Adobe CS5 Package, not Illustrator CS5. Should I be using a CS5 Package .dmg or does it just mean Illustrator. If I should be using this package .dmg does that include a bundle of Adobe CS5 programs (including Photoshop) or am I just misunderstanding it. "
,shyy71,2010-11-24T12:49Z,"it works fine, thx a ton ctang !

for news, yes it includes all what you have in cs5 suite, and yes you have to unrar it

and connect yourself back when you have to deactivate in the help section"

,takenote,2011-01-23T22:12Z,"It works!!!

You just have to follow directions EXACTLY. And I mean, EXACTLY. After reading the instructions about 20 times I was able to do it.

IF YOU HAVE A BLANK TERMINAL (for some reason I did, guess I did something stupid) go to this site: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10399809-263.html, and it will tell you how to fix it.

Great download.
I'm new to torrents, and I'm just excited this worked since I need it for school!

turned on my mac, to discover that the 'Hosts' file was ""attached"" to and opened automatically with any textedit file i opened..

BUT

'Hosts' file was LOCKED. Could not edit anything. So searched google for ways to edit it.
I used 'sudo nano /etc/hosts' in terminal to edit within terminal and saved."

,cokezer00,2012-06-29T00:50Z,"Works on Lion. However, the instructions for the Terminal are not the same. This is what I did, so I thought I'd share it with you guys. =) 

Terminal
Type this into the terminal in order to access your host files if you're using Lion:
sudo nano /private/etc/hosts

to save you need to press Ctrl X, and then Y for yes and lastly press the enter key. 

In part 3, to flush the cache in the terminal. I typed in:
sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder 
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
