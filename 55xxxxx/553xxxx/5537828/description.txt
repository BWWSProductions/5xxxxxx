This is Adobe Illustrator CS5 for Mac OS X!!

I decided to upload this because when doing a search for it I couldn't find it.

I got Illustrator DMG from Adobe's website and the install instructions are the same as 76dragon's instructions, as they worked very well for me.

Included in this torrent is Illustrator_15_LS1.dmg and install instructions, including activator keys.

These instructions are not mine, they are 76dragon's (TPB) and I take no credit for them in any way.  They are being used because they worked for me without any incident or hiccup!!!
