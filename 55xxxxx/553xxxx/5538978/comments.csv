,Novadestin,2010-08-06T01:30Z,Just so everyone knows only ONE episode is missing from this as this season only has 10 episodes and NOT 11. All episodes but episode 3 - Nightmare on the Mountain are here. :)
,persep,2010-09-04T11:01Z,Anybody knows where the missing episode is?
,lifeson98,2010-12-27T14:32Z,"This is Season 3, not Season 4
as listed in Wikipedia:

,wetmouse,2011-02-03T23:18Z,"I watched these as they came out. As is so often the case, Wackipedia is just plain wrong (alleged season 1 is actually season 1 7 2 with episode 6 being the last of season 1). So this is indeed season 4."
,Novadestin,2011-02-24T04:33Z,"Thank you wetmouse for being intelligent and sorry lifeson98 but Wikipedia is just plain wrong in this case (I find it is often incorrect but people there don't like to admit it.)

The reason for the confusion is that a new station bought the show and started making new episodes so they decided to rearrange the older ones to fit into their method of listing things (plus it fits better on seasonal dvds the way they did it - Nat Geo did the same thing with 'Taboo'). However that in NO way changes the ORIGINAL season layouts as they aired in the first place. The original airdates and season cuts will always take precedent. 

Its really a pretty simple mistake to make and should have been easily cleared up, but the Wikipedia crowd seems to follow the logic that 'because ITunes has it a certain way it must be so' (someone actually said that which is really sad). Either way, I hope that clears things up for people who might be confused. "
