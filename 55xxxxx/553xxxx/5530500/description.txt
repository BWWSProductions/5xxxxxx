This latest motorcycling 'Grand Tour' through Europe with the FB crew is a good reason to open a tinny from the fridge, steady your nerves and settle down for some awesome entertainment!

This isn't just the world's best bikes being ridden to the max, it's mental, eleven-tenths, footpeg-grinding, hilarious, knee-slider destroying, breathtaking riding that is extreme in every way!
