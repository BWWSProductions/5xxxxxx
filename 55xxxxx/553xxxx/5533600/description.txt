 When the DEA shut down its dummy corporation operation codenamed SWORDFISH   
 in 1986, they had generated $400 million which they let sit around; fifteen  
 years of compound interest has swelled it to $9.5 billion. A covert          
 counter-terrorist unit called Black Cell, headed by the duplicitious and     
 a nexus where twists and turns lead to myriad missteps, some with his wife   
 suave Gabriel Shear, wants the money to help finance their raise-the-stakes  
 vengeance war against international terrorism, but it's all locked away      
 behind super-encryption. He brings in convicted hacker Stanley Jobson, who   
 only wants to see his daughter Holly again but can't afford the legal fees,  
 to slice into the government mainframes and get the money.
