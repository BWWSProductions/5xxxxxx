,BasVeld,2010-05-04T12:22Z,"The audio doesn't line up with the film in the middle part of the movie!!! 
Couldn't play the hole movie."
,BasVeld,2010-05-04T12:30Z,"Audio doesn't line up with the film in the middle part of the movie!
It isn't watchable for the second part!!!"
,Fingers123,2010-05-04T14:44Z,half way through the film it fucks up lol
,Fingers123,2010-05-04T14:45Z,are all the torrents fuckin up half way through or is it just this 1
,LH-oswald,2010-05-04T17:52Z,"i just viewed the WBZ screener of this movie[downloaded from ET] and it also messed up the audio second half,so im guessing they are all out of sync,its not even a little bit out,its way out :( "
,boxvalue,2010-05-04T18:47Z,quality is shite m8. shouda left for koreans%)
,Fingers123,2010-05-04T19:11Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5532707/Solomon.Kane.DVDScr.XVID-JinX

,Fingers123,2010-05-04T19:12Z,lil bit out of sync at parts for a few seconds*
,dsafjaly69,2010-05-05T00:08Z,Totally buggered with 40 minutes left in the movie.  Dont bother downloading.
,dsafjaly69,2010-05-05T01:20Z,"For those that already have it downloaded...Once you get past the glitch at 1:04 into the movie set your audio delay to +104200 milliseconds (yes that 104 thousand 200 milliseconds), that should synch it up fairly well. At least it did with BSPlayer. "
,shorehamstreetskin,2010-05-05T14:01Z,Out of sync Dont download this such a shame.
,hexagontk,2010-05-05T16:23Z,"audio delay to +104200 milliseconds syncs it up great in MPC, thanks dsafjaly69!"
,Pothead808,2010-05-05T16:36Z,"Whenever i set the audio delay over 5000 i lose audio altogether, anyone have any ideas?"
,Pothead808,2010-05-05T16:58Z,"Nvm it worked for some reason unbeknown to me, thanks for the fix, was bummed when it started screwing up, good movie."
