"CHUCK VERSUS THE ROLE MODELS" 

Chuck (Zachary Levi) and Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski) 
are assigned to train under Craig and Laura 
Turner (guest stars Fred Willard, "Anchorman" and 
Swoosie Kurtz, "Pushing Daisies"), a married CIA 
team who, despite their impeccable record, hate 
one another. The Turners' stormy relationship 
forces Chuck and Sarah to wonder if they're doomed 
with the same fate. Meanwhile, Casey (Adam 
Baldwin) must train the newest member of the team.

Enjoy :)
