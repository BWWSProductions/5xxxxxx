Tired of living with his mother and her boyfriend, high-strung and responsible guy decides to buy an apartment with his less mature friends. But what seems to be the perfect apartment in Harlem turns out to be just the opposite. The place is turned into a hostel to help pay for rent, an eccentric cast of characters bring with them nothing but disaster and chaos. In this comedy about growing up, three mid-20 bachelors are faced with naÃ¯ve tourists, fugitives, and illegal parties as they struggle to get things under control.
