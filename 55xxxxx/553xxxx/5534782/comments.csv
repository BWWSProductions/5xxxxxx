i only uploaded this by chance

a neighbour (english spelling) knocked on my door the other day clutching a bought copy of this

she wanted to know if i could take track 18 off this and put it on a cd for her

i said yes and ripped the entire cd to my hard drive

this is not really to my taste where music is concerned"
