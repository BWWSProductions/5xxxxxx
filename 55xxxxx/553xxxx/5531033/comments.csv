,razpaz,2010-12-07T05:41Z,"I've had similar problems with the pirated message with other pc optimizers, but the problem should not arise if you DON'T download the update. Downloading the update usually prompts the system to detect if a serial code has been used more than once or if your copy is pirated (which it is).

So again: DO NOT update! This version should do more than enough to help you."
,star3struck,2010-12-15T02:00Z,"Serial did not work for me. I unplugged my internet, so it was not an update."
,zealaok,2011-03-04T12:27Z,how could there be 3 leechers but 14 comments stop puting up fake torrent or ill report your ass
,Doompy,2011-08-20T12:54Z,"Guys, do NOT download this. The serial will get recognized by their servers and reported. I just got the error so I'm not sure if their gonna do something about it, but don't download it for your own sake."
