New to Advanced System Optimizer? Find out why you need it


Advanced System Optimizer Version 2 was launched in the year 2004. Its tremendous success and feedbacks of more than 1 million users have really made the version 3 of Advanced System Optimizer state of the art product. It includes the most comprehensive set of utilities which will keep your PC running smooth, clean and error free.

With its comprehensive suite of utilities and attractive interface, Advanced System Optimizer makes it easy to regularly clean and optimize your system for better performance. In one of our tests, the optimizer CUT DOWN THE REGISTRY SIZE BY 15 PERCENT. The system-optimizer toolset handles sensitive areas such as registry files, as well as less critical data such as junk files and cookies. Privacy and security features clean Web files left in Internet Explorer, Opera, and Netscape, as well as finding and removing spyware. Encryption and secure erasing protect sensitive data. You can even make Windows more attractive by changing icons and wallpaper. More tools can organize your appointments, create sticky notes, and even manage media files. The XP-style interface clearly explains all the program's functions without flooding you with details. Sometimes more details would be nice, though, such as which invalid keys are completely safe to remove and which you might want to examine before deleting. However, you can back up system files and even create a boot disk to use in the event of a full-system crash. The easy-to-use interface makes Advanced System Optimizer perfect for beginners.
