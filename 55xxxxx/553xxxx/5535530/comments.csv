,brianxxx,2010-05-07T19:04Z,"Awesome! THanks!

Quick question - why is there no record of version 4.0.12.327 at the website?

Their revision history only shows up to ConvertXtoDVD - 4.0.9.322c - Released 21 April 2010

Just curious. I have a version 4.0.10 running just fine now. Are these betas?"
,brianxxx,2010-05-07T19:05Z,"OK. Never mind. Just found a link on the website.  Anything above 4.0.9 is a pre-release version.

OK. Sweet. Just figured others might want to know."
[V],Slickinator,2010-05-07T21:16Z,yep its one of the pre releases
[T],spotswood,2010-05-10T00:03Z,Thanks slick!
,BinkyDeath,2010-10-15T05:11Z,"Kerrrist! First time I've ever had a virus alert on a PB torrent. *shudders* Yeah so I know those keygens sometimes set off the malware alert but y'heart still jumps when it does eh?  lol
For the benefit of others I checked out Slickinator's other torrents for comments about his keygens since he's in the 'trusted' mob before deciding to use the keygen and it's fine. One scanning programme said there was a virus and one didn't and there wasn't. :)
It all seems to work fine and my key worked. :)  Thanks babe x"
