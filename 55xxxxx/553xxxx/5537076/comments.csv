,acinod,2010-05-08T10:56Z,Is this Cantonese or the dubbed Mandarin version? You can tell if their voice doesn't match with their mouth moving.
,giantballsack,2010-05-09T17:32Z,I have no idea why every uploader is uploading the cut version. Can any uploader upload a full uncut version (meaning the bottom part is not cut). Please do it for those chinese people. Thanks.
