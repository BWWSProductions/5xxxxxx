,nukestrike,2010-05-05T08:00Z,I love that your uploading current aots but how are you supposed to get a list of seeders if you do not seed the torrent by yourself first. 0 seeders means nobody can download. Could you please seed for at least a day until others can download it. I will be happy to seed it after for you but I need to download it first and cant without seeders. Thanks and please keep them coming.

I appreciate your work TvTeam but please do not post fake torrents up here to get people to register for your own website and download them there. That is just not cool. If you are going to use the piratebay please do not spam it with files like this.
