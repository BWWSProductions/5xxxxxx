This is so wonderful material. It's my first time to see your uploaded homeschool softwares.  In fact, I had successfully downloaded ""The Clue Finders Reading Adventures Ages 9-12"", however, I am not so sure where is the .iso file.  I have successfully installed it but whenever I will continue, it always asks me to put on the disc. 

Please help. I'm a newbie on using software for my son. 

Thank you very much.  God bless!


Raymond"
