Requirements - PS2:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 
Requirements - PS1:  Modded/Chipped Ps1 or Ps2, Breaker Pro Boot CD, 
                     Psx Game Enhancer/Mod-Chip (Allows playing of backups) 
                     or Psx Emulator. (You only need one of these methods).


Compressed with 7Zip, Both Games were tested and work.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is 
      Modded (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic. Also No Ps1 
      Backup/Game or copy will work unless you have a modded Ps1/Ps2, or if you 
      use a bootdisc like Breaker Pro, you can also use a Game Enhancer/Built-in 
      Mod-Chip which does the same as Breaker Pro for the Ps1.


Important - This is a CD-R or Compact Disc Type Ps2/Ps1 Game, So you'll have to 
            use CD-R Media only to burn with.



Release Notes: Risk for the PS2 does have an online feature, and the dnas has been 
               patched. However, I don't even know if the servers are still up for 
               this game. And doubt you can still play this game online but you 
               can try.



You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console. If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. 

Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.
