          Noga Records is delighted to announce its new installment for 2010.
          Coming right at you is the 4th album from the prominent duo Ananda
          Shake, the well known project of Osher Swissa and Lior Edery.
          This new album brings forth new elements, new formulas of Full-on
          style of trance music, bringing in higher peaks than before
          encountered, driven by a pack of wild horses roaming vigorously
          through the mountains.
          The name of this essential album, 'The World Is yours', reflects
          well on this albums content, and perfectly represents the thoughts,
          idea and motivation of Ananda Shake.
          Ananda Shake: 'The clear option of granting our imagination to seize
          control, clearly grants us the simple option of taking control of
          our own personal world, the music is not only a tool, it acts as
          guidance, a headliner '.
          'The World Is yours', another brilliant installment from Ananda
          Shake, a true collectors album, and a precious Dj tool

          NOGA records, formerly known as "True Trance records" (formed 2001),
          was initially founded to give birth to new evolving cutting edge
          dance floor music. The label's aim is to transcend the trance genre,
          in a mission to enrich people's souls by presenting the true art of
          electronic dance, by supporting and presenting the finest artists
          producing contemporary psychedelic trance music, with a scent of the
          future. "We believe in the healing powers of BPM and in a metaphoric
          way of bringing the most cutting edge & outrageous
          musician's/dj's/artist's before a new canvas, allowing them to
          freely paint the color's, lines, soul and light, redefining the
          music experience to keep pace with the fast changing world around
          us. To teach the truth as we know it, music is light, light is love,
          and sharing love is the highest form of selfless expression". These
          days Noga Records is one of the leading labels in Japan, its serves
          as a Japanese representative of various labels and artists from all
          over the world. Noga records is lead by Japanese based, Israeli
          Dj/Producer Ziki (A.K.A Karmachanics). Among its famous releases you
          can find the well known Tokyo-Tel Aviv compilation serious, Spaced
          Out - By Gataka, Freaked Frequency studio album, Ziki debut album
          and loads more...

          DMM IS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR:
          - Straight guys (amongst The Scene).
          - Irresponsible and hardly working rippers.
          - Guys that have access to old stuff that has been released over 200
          times already.

          MP3 isnt the same as holding a stolen DMM record in your hands !!
          Neither is the record the same as holding a DMM ripped release in
          your share !! We are also becoming sick over seeing all psytrance
          releases get to site circles/ftp communities and other such lame,
          criminal shit.

          WE DON'T WANT OUR RELEASES GETTiNG SPREAD TO SUCH LAME PLACES!!!

          What you are doing is grand theft auto, stealing from p2p circles.
          We would like to ask our fellows (not you site/antip2p rip-of
          lamers) to secure the p2p!

          MUSiC WORTH LiSTENiNG iS MUSiC WORTH SPREADiNG!!

          You need to feel the bass to go with the flow ... and that's what
          scene-mp3 just can't give you. Take your time to taste and to
          decide, who's artist's dick is compatible with your head.

          PROOVE YOURSELF AS AN HONEST HUMAN BY
          SHARING COMPLETE RELEASES WITH SFV, NFO AND M3U !!!

          P2P MADE US REALIZE:
          - How much bullshit talk there is inside scene NFO files.
          - That NFO files needed a special program to be viewed properly.
          - That my sharesize was more important then having a real life/job.
          - That if you dont like you dont buy, if you like high five!

          DONT KEEP RELEASES TO YOURSELF ONLY - COPY
          THEM TO EVERY MATE YOU KNOW, AND DONT KNOW !!!

          ... and by the way:
          !!! FUCK OFF TO ALL SHARERS OF SCENE RELEASES !!!

          DIVINE MOMENTS OF MALMO
          - We bow our heads to our old friends. Deep throat to you!
          - Sending lamers (from sites) copies of dmm releases since the
          beginning of January 2007!
