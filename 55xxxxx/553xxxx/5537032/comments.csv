,sanewicked,2010-05-06T19:27Z,"Video is somewhat above average for a cam and audio isn't terrible but extremely low! I needed to turn up the volume to max on both my VLC media player and on my computer just to hear it.

A: 4
V: 7

It's passable, but a little (just a bit) better than other cams for this movie. It's worth a try if you can handle the audio."
,ScamWoW,2010-05-06T21:01Z,yes that is one of the downside i know but i needed to turn down the gain or els you would hear to much static and couldn't hear anythign when the loud parts came.
,springw,2010-05-06T21:40Z,I really hope there are more release this week on this movie 
,ScamWoW,2010-05-06T21:56Z,"I imagine there will be good ones to come soon, friday is coming and that's usually alot peoples movie nights so prolly be more then"
