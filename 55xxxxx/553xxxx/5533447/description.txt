BBC The History of Safari PDTV Xvid AC3 MVGroup

Richard E Grant examines the controversial history of the safari. Exploring the world of the big game hunters and the luxury of today's safaris, he goes on a personal journey to experience how the beauty of the bush made Africa the white man's playground. Using film and photographic archive, the film evokes the spirit of decadence, exploration and adventure of the safari and reveals how it continues to be a barometer of our attitudes to travel, our colonial inheritance and Africa itself.
