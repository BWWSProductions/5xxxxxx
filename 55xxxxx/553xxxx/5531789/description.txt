Konohamaru is in love with a girl, Ureshino Kaede, who is moving away from the village. He wishes to win her heart with a crimson four leaf clover, which is also supposed to grant any wish. Konohamaru asks Naruto Uzumaki to help him find it, but they have to travel into the forbidden zone, Akagahara, to retrieve it. After activating almost every trap on the way to the clover, the pair are attacked by marionettes after moving a statue to reach the clover. Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha appear to help, but still can't defeat them. At last, the marionettes shut off after Konohamaru lifts the statue back to its original position.Then one of the leaves fall off. Konohamaru still gives the clover to Kaede, and she kisses him on his cheek.
