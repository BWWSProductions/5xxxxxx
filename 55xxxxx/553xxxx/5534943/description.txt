Notes::::::::::::::::::
Well....V2 Because 1st release some people call a "glitch" which is just the video messing up, on the
original source, if you have 1st release just fast forward couple mins and it's just fine, but anyway
at the 1hour 3min mark theirs a glitch, so i cut it at 1hour 2mins 46seconds, to 1hour 4mins and some seconds
and removed that video, so now their is no glitch, check it thoroughly, at the cut the audio goes off for 2seconds
but theirs not talking nothing happening except rain, it's only 2seconds live with it , anyway, same video
as before, changed the colors slightly, cropped black borders and re sized the resolution, overall if you want to 
see this movie, it's this or retail  Enjoy //prism
