[V],meech,2010-05-04T23:24Z,"Forgot to mention in the description...I am in the process of ripping the entire series (seasons 1-10) in high quality for myself.  If there is an interest in this torrent, I will continue to post the rest of the seasons as they are finished.  If you enjoy the quality, please leave a comment that others may find useful.  Thanks...enjoy!!"
,Gaukou,2010-05-06T14:48Z,Very good quality indeed ! Nice work.
,Gaukou,2010-05-06T14:56Z,"I was wondering though: Do you use any desinterlacing filter for some episodes ? For example, in the 1x06, we can see artefacts resulting of a non desinterlaced video encoded in progressiv way (ex: 38'11''-13''). Or does it come with the DVD already?"
[V],meech,2010-05-06T19:55Z,"Hmm...the video is run through a decombing filter.  That type of filter basically deinterlaces only when needed.  For instance, if you deinterlaced an entire video that was only interlaced at some parts, it would look horrible.  The decombing filter solves that problem by being a ""smart"" filter and only deinterlacing portions that are interlaced.  It is safe to just leave the filter on for any encode since it will only kick in when needed.  Now there are settings on the filter that can be tweaked for sensitivity.  However, I like what the defaults produce.  To be honest, I couldn't notice any interlacing artifacts at the spot you referenced.  However, you may have more of a trained eye. I've finished watching the first season and part of the 2nd (I just found this series myself), and haven't noticed any artifacts that have detracted from the viewing experience.  But I don't doubt that there could be minor flaws here or there.  Some does have to do with the quality of the original dvds.  Thanks for commenting ( :"
,Wtss,2010-05-07T16:31Z,Great quality. Thank you.
,evilminded,2010-05-16T05:54Z,"Thanks Meechorno!!!

I was just looking for the original dvds so I can rip them the  same way that you did :-D
You saved me weeeeeks!

Thanks again!"
,evilminded,2010-05-17T04:22Z,"Hi,

I have a question
Stargate.SG1-s01e03.The.Enemy.Within.mkv
the english audio is Stereo 192 kbps
you said that it was ac3 passthrough, 5.1 channel??
can you check the original dvd please :)

Oh and btw The Video is the best dvd rip out there :)"
[V],meech,2010-05-18T13:24Z,"evilminded:
You are totally right!  Good catch.  I don't know how I missed that.  I assumed somehow that they were 5.1 channel.  They are in fact Dolby Digital 2.0.  It is still the AC3 original audio from the dvds.  However, it looks like season 1 only offered the Dolby Digital.  It looks like the dvds for the rest of the seasons do have 5.1...so that should be correct for the rest of the torrents.  I have updated the description accordingly.  Thanks!"
,evilminded,2010-05-19T05:48Z,"those morons... they cant even make a DVD right.... Star Trek TNG has the same problem somewhere mid seasons....

btw i have mp3 stereo audio for the first season of Stargate Sg1... it is a lot louder.. same kbps
dont know the source...
I will probably use mkvtoolnix to change the audio for season 1 :)

If anyone is interested let me know - PM"
,Da_ud001,2010-06-04T18:46Z,"Hi buddy,

First of all i must say, good job,

second, when can we expect to see seasons 7-10

Thanks"
,wetmouse,2010-06-20T09:14Z,"The quality has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the processor you are using. I could do exactly the same rip using my backup machine (a 3.2G HT Pentium 4 from 2004). EXACTLY the same rip. The only difference would be in how long it would take, but that doesn't mean anything to anyone who would download it from me. And since Season 1 was filmed in 16mm, the file size here is excessive (especially for h.264). The other seasons (35MM and later digital HD) are fine, and I do appreciate the effort, but don't speak about technical issues that are beyond your understanding. It's embarrassing. "
[V],meech,2010-06-22T04:29Z,"Wetmouse:
I think you misunderstand.  The whole point of my explanation was exactly what your conclusion was.  The entire point is that the more powerful processor can handle the higher settings in a reasonable time.  If it took you 20 hours an episode on your p4 to do a 2-pass rip at the settings that were used for these, it would take you close to 3 weeks at a minimum to release one season.  Sure, you could do exactly the same rip...but where are those rips?  Are they out there...probably not, because most people won't devote the amount of time it would take to release a 10 season series that way.  If you understand how h.264 works, then you know that there are algorithms available that help pack in more quality into smaller files.  So take for example those 700mb rips that are out there.  Very nice quality.  However, looking at their quality, I believe my 600mb rips are at a higher quality, because I was able to turn up the high settings, enabling the proper algorithms that, yes - take a ton of processing power (i.e. time), but pack in more quality into a smaller file size.  So this is indeed beneficial to the downloader...thus why I even mention this.

I don't understand why your embarrassed...unless you just realized that your comment added absolutely nothing positive or helpful to the internet, piratebay, or this torrent. "
[V],meech,2010-06-22T04:37Z,"Oh and also...the ""other digital HD"" seasons that you say are fine...are not HD, by the way.  Seasons 7-10 were broadcasted in HD on some stations, but there are no HD/720p releases on dvd media.  Nor will you find any torrents of them.  These are simply high quality dvd rips.  That is quite a compliment to compare the high quality dvd rips to digital HD.  THanks."
,Bongo2,2010-06-23T21:59Z,"Thanks for this upload. It's great you did all the seasons.
I downloaded part of the most common release of SG-1; the 350mb files encoded in xvid. But I was a bit dissapointed as it had a lot of visible artefacts typical of xvid.
So this seems great, maybe a bit oversized for such high quality h.264 settings but better a bit too big then too small.
Thanks again."

Thanks."

,CakeMonster,2010-11-01T20:01Z,"Mr meech if you could please upload season 2 of atlantis with commentaries it would make my day

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of “good quality” of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
[V],meech,2010-11-02T14:07Z,"To view some of my other torrents, goto my piratebay page http://thepiratebay.org/user/meech

Some of my other sci-fi torrents include high quality complete series of: Star Trek Next Generation, Star Trek DS-9, Farscape, and Space Above and Beyond.

Star Trek Voyager is currently being ripped.  The first season should be up soon."
,CakeMonster,2010-11-03T02:59Z,"I understand that you have many torrents yes

But I am interested in Stargate atlantis with directors commentaries especially season 2

If you could upload that I would be very happy"

Thank you for this. Started to watch this from the beginning since scifi is in 'crisis'   ;-)

Keep up the good work..."
,Grompok,2011-02-09T10:04Z,"Thanx, nice quality. I just wanted to ask did any1 else have lags at the end of some episodes? Or maybe some1 know how to fix that? (I use DviX+, other videos works fine...)"
,drmonkeyboy,2011-03-21T22:31Z,"Started to watch all of sg1 and meech has the most reliable source on the internet, only nag is as you start to download later season the download time increases so id recommend downloading two at a time wait for them to both be finished them start another two whilst watching the first two. but again good quality torrent(s) Meech your a legend!"
,Annabelvl,2011-04-13T19:54Z,"please seed, stuck @ 68.9% !"
,Malakai0,2011-04-18T03:02Z,"File sizes seem far too large for a dvd-rip. h.264 is more efficient than xvid, so you should be able to get near perfect sd dvd rips in far, far smaller file sizes. I have seen 100-150mb tv ep dvd rips that looked near perfect, and it taxes your HD space a lot less :)

Of course there is no problem with a super HQ torrent like this, if someone wants max quality and doesnt care about hd space, then this is what they need.

I however am looking for great quality but very efficient x264 rips of everything stargate. So far RiddlerA is one of the few peeps posting those but he has little scifi stuff :("
,Fnorkus,2011-05-09T21:03Z,"The subtitles are horribly misspelled, is there any way to have them off by default?"

,jamesvdm,2011-05-23T07:00Z,"Excellent work. Don't listen to the haters. I had just started ripping from DVD before I found this torrent, and I can tell you the file sizes are spot on what I would expect.

Please seed everyone."
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:32Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys

And yeah Fnorkus-Turn them off in VLC"

My favourite Sci-Fi show of all time. Really appreciate you taking the time to rip, encode and UL this and the remaining seasons!"
,zewax,2012-03-27T18:26Z,"Excellent quality. However, episode numbers are horribly mixed, I had to use IMDB to find out which way are they originally composed."
,starsprite3,2012-07-06T05:16Z,"Thanks for the download.  I don't know if there is anything you can do about freezes, skips and digitizing but there is all 3 on these episodes.  I downloaded and seeded and it took 4 days 8 hours to get to share ratio: 1.670.  I wouldn't agree with the higher quality either.  They were fuzzy and grainy but after all this time spent I will probably keep them.  I hope my seeding helps someone else.  A/9; V/7"
