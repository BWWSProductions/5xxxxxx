[V],twentyforty,2010-05-03T15:38Z,"Sure. Xeroxed ""Mona Lisa"" ain't same one as in Louvre. But, xeroxed one can be fold and put in the pocket. One on the wall costs around 120 Millions. Dollars."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-03T15:46Z,"@Stev: Hi my friend. Be so nice and tell me: What show do you like more: ""24"" or ""Chuck"" or ""How I Met..."" or ""The Big Bang Theory""...
Or ""Treme"" maybe?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-03T17:32Z,"@hkoraddi: ""Mona Lisa"" was for you - but - I would suggest to anyone to:
a) download the sample from ""big"" CAM
b) download the sample from [quark] CAM
c) compare and decide; is it worth to burn 1/4 of monthly allowance. Or as one of my friends who pays 80 cents per 100MB - spend 10 bucks on CAM which would be replaced by approximately 6-7 TeleSyncs in next week or so - before DVD and BluRay comes out... 
Any smart men would save the nickles. These are the hard times for many - and majority would never be any richer."

,lilars26,2010-05-03T21:23Z,"For me,out of the ones you mentioned I would say The Big Bang Theory.Too early for Treme.But it has potential.

Quark is a great medium for cams and T.S's.
People who download a 1.3 gig cam have more money than brains.But it is good for other things too."
,lilars26,2010-05-03T21:27Z,"C'mon people,it's only 163 mbs......seed."
,lilars26,2010-05-03T21:31Z,"I forgot why I came here.

Thank's 20/40."
,TKOG13,2010-05-04T00:06Z,"thanks 2040, another great upload"
[V],pluto999,2010-05-04T06:58Z,@2040 hows the movie? Did ya watch it?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-04T09:51Z,"@pluto999: Sorry, I haven't... same as for first one.

@lilars: Again 98% of Hit&Runs. I left the swarm when I have 32 with 100%. then loaded BB... when I came back, three hours later, there was 11 seeders and 386 downloads. I aborted all other uploads and seed since then.
Well... what to say... [quark] on the ice?"
,Pothead808,2010-05-04T14:46Z,"Truly amazing man, 2 hour movie into 160mb...and the quality is more then watchable, just need headphones so you can hear whats going on :D"
