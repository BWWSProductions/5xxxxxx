Cant evade ( get past) the activation code popup.

I have to each time use the keygen on startup,  fine, but when u have Photoshop, illustrator, Dreamweaver, Flash etc it gets kind of irritating AND I guess I?m gone run out of codes!!

I have done as described:  used the ?127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com? in
Windows / system 32 / drivers / etc / hosts

,mgw6969,2011-03-03T19:34Z,"downloaded no problem. updated my host file no problem. but when i tried to run the MasterCollection_CS5_LS1 application it gave me an error message ""The file archive part of Adobe CS5 Master Collection is missing"".  what gives?"
,Cgoff87,2011-04-06T08:24Z,"I found that I was able to use this in sandbox made using Comodo Firewall and it prevented it from checking the activation, instead I could skip the adobe id process altogether with no problem whatsoever."
