,onthehook,2010-05-23T00:22Z,"fuck off spammers!!! this is a good quality rip, but the movie itself sucks.  if you read the book you will be lost... its like harry potter without hogwarts...    its like the screen writers got the ideas from a 8 year old that read the book and then told them about it..."

,Video_Veg,2010-07-05T07:33Z,"Given that this movie is targeting a youth audience, is still fun to watch. Special effects have come a long way since my days, (circa Buck Rogers, etc.) but storylines and espcially dialogue seems to have stood still.
Thanks for the upload FXG_team."
