What is new in 3.5 software version? - Bugfixes.

In a labyrinth consiting of unmovable stones you will find some different atom. In the navigation window you will see the construction plan of a molecule. Try to build the molecule out of these atoms. Take an atom with a mouseclick. Then move the mouse a little bit left, right, up or down The atom will move as long as it knocks at a stone or another atom. With a second mouseclick you drop the atom. That sounds easy, doesn`t it? Going on with the game you will more and more recognise that these atoms are really crazy. Your brain must work hard otherwise you will find yourself stuck in a unsoluble situation. Then the only way out is to start at the beginning. Mind, there are 444 constructions plans of molecules! The navigator allows you to choose the constructions plans, that means you can also start with the last plan.
