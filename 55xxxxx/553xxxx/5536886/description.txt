Alex talks [hour 3] with Robert G. Rash, a professional land surveyor and engineer. Mr. Rash contends that FEMA is now in the business of underwriting flood insurance policies in order to pay back its $19.2 billion debt incurred from Hurricane Katrina and Rita. 



Alex also covers the latest news, including the on-going Times Square fiasco, and takes a number of calls.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
