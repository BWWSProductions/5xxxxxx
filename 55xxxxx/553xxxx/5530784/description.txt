Ani DiFranco (born Angela Maria DiFranco on September 23, 1970) is an American Grammy Award-winning singer, guitarist, and songwriter. She has released over twenty albums, and is a feminist icon. DiFranco identifies herself as bisexual, and has written songs about love and sex with both genders.

DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature staccato  style, rapid fingerpicking and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include alliteration, metaphor, word play and a more or less gentle irony, have also received praise for their sophistication.

Dilate is her seventh studio album, and it was released in 1996. Dilate is her highest-selling record, with U.S.  sales of over 480,000 units (according to SoundScan).*
