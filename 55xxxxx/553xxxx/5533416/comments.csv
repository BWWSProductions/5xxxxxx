,fnyzzel,2010-12-11T13:31Z,"Installing Logic Studio 9:

1. Mount ""Logic Studio Install.dmg""

2. Choose to install whichever applications, tools and sound libraries you want using the following serial:
SN: E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX

3. Depending on what files you decided to install you may need to mount several of the other DMGs contained in this folder during installation. Just keep mounting the appropriate disk images as the installer prompts you for them.

4. Update your applications to their latest versions using Apple Software Update (found in the 'Apple' menu)

5. Download this file: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5744335/Pro_Apps_2010_Volume_License

6. Unzip ""Pro_Apps_2010.zip""

7. Move the files from the ""Pro Apps 2010"" folder to this location:
Volume/Library/Application Support/ProApps
Choose to overwrite files if prompted.

8. Launch Logic and rejoice!

---------------------------------------

Additional notes:

After updating using Apple Software Update, double applications may have been created in your Applications folder. This is because the updated versions have intel x64 support and are therefore incompatible with PPC-based hardware drivers.

The installer keeps a copy of the original versions (which are universal binaries) for compatibility. If you don't use any audio hardware that depends on PPC-compatible drivers, you can just delete the universal binaries to save space. 
The ones you want to delete are those which have their version number written inside brackets.
Example: ""Logic Pro (9.0.0).app"" etc.

Oh, and one last thing. Some of the updated apps does indeed come with 64-bit support, but are run in 32-bit mode by default, again for compatibility. If you wish to run them in 64-bit mode, all you have to do is select the App in your Applications folder, hit CMD+I (get info) and uncheck the box that says ""Run in 32-bit mode"". Should you ever run in to problems running in 64-bit mode, you can just revert to 32-bit by checking that box again.

64-bit mode will ONLY work on Mac OS X 6.x (Snow Leopard) or above."

,mekintos,2011-01-31T07:20Z,"Ugh..
I'm not torrent expert, maybe the slowness happens coz the inside rared torrent
have private tag in it and depending only from tracker announcement.
I assumed that someone leaking it to some public tracker.
So... I grabbed it, and shared it to TPB.

Make sure you clearing up your cache from time to time.
And don't choke too much, 70:30 is fair ratio when you leeching,
give priority the dmg one at the time by random choice,
so that dmg finished earlier than other.
Then you can help seeding others when you leeching.

Starting only 8 seeders, 45 leechers, back then,  I finished about 3 month,
so be patience guys.
Now 50 seeders have bleeding modem  to seed you all. :)

Hope this will help by adding more working tracker:

http://genesis.1337x.org:80/announce
http://tracker2.istole.it:80/announce
http://umu.mu:80/announce
http://exodus.desync.com:80/announce

Just make some good music when you finish it, not reselling the pirate programs.
Learn it, make money from your own creation, then buy the legal program.

@IXLSoft...., just be careful to your COMMERCIAL BREAKs,
you could bring your buyer go down with you when the big guys CAUGHT you,
coz you have all proof & data from all your buyers.

Why not stick to unsinkable vessel TPB? :)"

,mekintos,2011-02-16T07:35Z,"Poor aaronj69, have a weird problem from the day one.
Do not seek technical answers from pirates, you'll better find that answer from torrent expert by googling it.

I'm suggesting from common logical procedure:
1. try different random Port.
2. try downloading from different torrent client.
3. give this torrent the only torrent in the list (delete others).
4. try from different computer/modem (maybe your IP is the problem connecting the trackers).
5. leave this torrent, googling another logic 9 torrent, if you lucky, you'll find the complete content from another site.
6. The worst, you have to satisfied by Logic 9 without the content.
