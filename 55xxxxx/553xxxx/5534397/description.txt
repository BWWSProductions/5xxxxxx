Glenn Beck Program for May 4th 2010

They now have The 4th Hour broadcast in what is called an RTMPE stream. For those who are not geeks: RTMPE is a protected stream type that you cannot download by normal methods.

Thankfully, I am abnormal. Until I can figure out how to make it easy for someone like GhostSquirrel to get the video stream, I would expect some uploading delays.

Enjoy!
