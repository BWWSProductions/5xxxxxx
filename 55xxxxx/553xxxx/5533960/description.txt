          We Can't Dance, recorded and released in 1991, is the 14th studio album by Genesis.  
          It reached #1 in the UK, where it remained in the charts for 61 weeks. It was their  
          last studio album featuring vocalist/drummer Phil Collins, who would leave Genesis   
          amicably in 1996 before returning for 2007's Turn It on Again: The Tour.             
                                                                                               
          We Can't Dance was Genesis' first studio album in five years, following the          
          international success of Invisible Touch in 1986. We Can't Dance reached #1 in the UK
          and #4 in the US, selling several million copies (including 4 million in the US      
          alone). The album also spawned several hit singles, including "No Son of Mine", "Hold
          on My Heart", "I Can't Dance" and "Jesus He Knows Me", the latter two supported by   
          humorous videos. Two songs were cut from the album, due to the fact "there wasn't    
          enough room on the record." These two songs are "On the Shoreline", and "Hearts on   
          Fire". Both songs were released as B-Sides.                                          
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            
                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
