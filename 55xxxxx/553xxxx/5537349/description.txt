Mac OS 8.2: Beta

This was the beta of Mac OS 8.5. It was anything but stable, but I though it may be interesting to install it in an emulator. As for the emulator itself, SheepShaver, another torrent or website may help you. This is a 64MB disk image of MacOS 8.2, with only kilobytes of space left. I suggest making another "Main" hard disk.
