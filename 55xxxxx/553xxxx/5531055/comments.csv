,piratebiav,2010-05-04T06:44Z,"yay back here again.. didn't find this on the other site.. had to check here :D

Thanks!"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-05-04T06:48Z,"Thanks!

Notice the lack of trolls lately?

Too much has been exposed, I think... a lot of people are starting to feel very stupid."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-04T07:29Z,Notice how Dumbo Limbaugh plays Monday Quarterback every time he speaks...Quick to criticizes for any and everything but he cant be questioned on his stupid stuff he does...Today he while criticizing the EPA on not responding to the oil spill...During the first hour guess what? The EPA responded...Does anyone in Dumboland actually learn anything new from this ass clown...I dont...I just hear hate speech at its best... Criticizing Obama on how he handled the oil spill in the gulf by comparing it to the time when W. Bush heard the country was under attack and kept reading sesame street like a BITCH is no comparison...Maybe Obama should have parted the red sea because Dumbo called him the messiah(now the Regime)...Note: Only Dumbo and his goons called Obama the messiah...Maybe I will one day listen to Dumbo and see the light...Or maybe not...END
,ripcordrg,2010-05-04T14:00Z,"Tickdaddy above didn't listen to the show and didn't comment to say thanks or comment on the quality or content. Trick is just a typical drone troll and is the reason Rush is necessary in this country to expose it and it's ilk so the people who make a difference and contribute can get TRUTH for a change. The regime is out of control and Rush is there to expose it and geniuses like Trick drinks the water we carry and will always be the consumer and TICK of our hard work. 


Thanks jwhitt62 for the post and all the extras you include. Keep up the great work. "
,TedKennedy,2010-05-04T18:51Z,"Lulz trick, you always reinforce the hypocrisy of the left. you say rush is using hate speech after you called him hateful names. classic."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-04T19:00Z,"Notice how the ones talking about me do not address my but attack me...Speaks volumes of how sound my arguments are...END 

PS: Like clockwork Rush is making false comments about the President...Sounds like he mad the homemade bomb did not go off in New York"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-04T19:40Z,I dare you Rush to say Teabagger again...I dare you...END
,piratebiav,2010-05-04T20:59Z,"Yeah Obama is a great president, If you live in the USSR that is.. He is a communist,  only interested in making America a Social paradise for him & his democrat party.

Guess if you sit on your ass all day would be great to have Obama.. Nothing like spreading the wealth.. Nothing like the government controlling every aspect of your life. 

Just wait until the healthcare in this country goes down the shitter. "
,darkencypher,2010-05-04T21:31Z,"Trolldaddy.  If you were an intellect and you actually made valid points, you might earn actual responses. But you aren't, and you don't.  You're a spiteful little troll drone.  Keep posting your ignorance and hate, you're actually helping our cause.  Please.  I look forward to your next one."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-05T02:01Z,"piratebitch, I do not blame you for your comments...Its obvious that you are a fool reciting everything Dumbo says...Post a comment using your own words...Then maybe you stop sounding like a dittohead dummy...END

darkexcrement, you can attack me allday...Call me a troll but this will not stop me from exercising my 1st amendment right...You couldnt argue any of my points because I believe you are not that bright...If you were I would make you famous...Just like shane mosley...END

,piratebiav,2010-05-05T06:12Z,"ummm, trickbitch.. maybe you should read Obamas book, He grown up with a communist mentor. If you could read, check out the dictionary & learn what socialism means, You are obviously a clueless drone. 

Have fun at your socialist party"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-05T14:19Z,trickbitch...How original...LOL
,TedKennedy,2010-05-05T15:40Z,"look trick if your comments where honest inquiry than i would consider the merit of your arguments and debate them. its seems to me however all you do is rage on here and try to come up with new insults to call rush. Your comments don't really make any valid points because it seems you write them in a blind rage...... go get a job you like and have a family. if you disagree with rush do us all a favor and stop listening to him. Sitting around listening to rush is just allowing rush to win, because he is doing what he has set out to do-> piss liberals off....... END "

Let's see...I said Rush play Monday Quarterback, criticizing the EPA but makes correction on air, I dont learn anything from Rush, criticizing Obama and compares to GWB, only ones to call Obama the Messiah(now Regime)... TK, do me a favor(which I know you wont) name one thing that Rush said this week that you did not know before he said it...END   "

,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-30T00:47Z,"Asking if someone has an audiobook to share on a file-sharing site is not the redistribution of wealth. --bugaboo. What the HELL are you talking about bugaboo? Lets take the author David Horowitz (the have) and then take ThunderBitch (the have not)...ThunderBitch wants Jho to take audio he may or may not have purchased and give it away to someone who cant afford it...Remember the housing crisis? Remember HealthCare?...It is true that this not what the copyright holders want but it is in no way taking away what is already possessed. While digital duplication is a major issue in the digital age for content producers, you are applying fallacious comparisons.--bugaboo...Bugaboo Im just exposing the hypocrisy of conservatives...As we speak the produces of the Hurt Locker is looking to sue pirates for download his boring movie.

 Comcast is setting limits to discourage peer to peer downloading...

So, bugaboo you assertions that this is harmless and is not stealing is just crap and you should shut up because you dont know what you are talking about...If I was being sued for downloading the hurt locker and you were my attorney...I would just plead guilty and get it over with...END"
