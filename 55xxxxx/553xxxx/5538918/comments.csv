,w4rlord,2010-05-07T03:28Z,"OMFG FUCKING THANKS ASSHOLES FOR THE SPOILERS, MUCH FUCKING APPRECIATED. FFS! CLUELESS DICKHEADS ,,!,,"
,69fart,2010-05-07T07:19Z,LOL@ people who actually freak out over spoilers.
,Nishua,2010-05-07T09:00Z,"For those of you who thought it was cool to post spoilers thinking you were cool. I hope when you wake up tomorrow that something horrible happens to you. I hope that someone in your family dies or even better that you do.

Don't get me wrong I'm not upset that you posted spoilers it's expected that there will be idiots in the world who have no concern for others and for that reason I hope erased from the world tomorrow.

I'm not a religious person but tonight before I go to bed I will pray for such things. Not because you spoiled a anime for sure others but because that's what people like you deserve in life. Good night and make sure you look both ways before crossing the street tomorrow."
,spoilz,2010-05-07T12:21Z,"well kakashi doesn't actually die. once naruto returns from sage training and beats up pain, and the fifth hokage is on her death bed, it's revealed that kakashi was just badly hurt and not really dead, the fifth hokage managed to save him. so no worries there. oh and even though the fifth hokage almost dies, and they make danzo the sixth hokage, she eventually comes out of it all better. also danzo gets killed by sasuke, and has a shit ton of sharingans in that arm of his that is bandaged."
,anything963,2010-05-08T13:17Z,"Haha. Spoilz.
