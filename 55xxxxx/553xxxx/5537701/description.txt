We've been following the new slasher flick Cornered! starring Police Academy icon Steve Guttenberg and Donnie Darko's James Duval. Spotlight Pictures is doing distribution duty for Cornered!, and now they've given us a trailer that shows real promise.

"A serial killer with a morbid voyeur fetish is targeting and terrorizing convenience stores in the city of Los Angeles. He tortures and executes his victims in a ghoulishly artistic way, then steals the surveillance tapes as his bizarre personal trophies.

With the city paralyzed in fear, deliveryman Morty (Guttenberg) shares his concerns about the recent killings with a group of assorted friends at an isolated downtown liquor store. In a light-hearted conversation each member of the group explains, in imaginative ways, how they would kill the psychopath if they ever met him.

Convinced the store is safe, the friends, including Jimmy (Duval), lock themselves in and settle down for a night of poker. As the night progresses, drunken fun quickly turns into heinous murder as the friends begin to disappear one by one. The despair thickens once the group discover they are being hunted by the killer, who is executing each victim in the manner they described. When the killer discovers the butcherâ€™s tools in the basement, he puts them to demonic use, and the harmless game of cards becomes a terrorizing game of survival.

Be careful â€¦ evil may be listening!"

Under normal circumstances I wouldn't expect much from a movie about a serial killer stalking convenience stores. I'd even argue a movie slasher that specializes in stalking Quick-E-Marts is kind of slumming except for the fact that most movie slashers frequent cabins in the woods and other isolated, desolate locales. The trailer for Cornered! is surprisingly effective, and there's the added bonus of seeing Guttenberg's new lighter do.
