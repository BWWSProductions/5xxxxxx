thanks for all the scene stuffs you put here.
It seems that there's a problem with your batch,
when you erase the rar files after decompression you also delete the sub.rar files, the idx file is alone and we missed the .sub files. Can you please check this so we can have the complete both subtitles files. TIA @+"
