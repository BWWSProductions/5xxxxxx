,poseidon2077,2010-06-03T01:30Z,"Great upload and nice movie! the DVD has a very good quality, THANK YOU"
,xyz3352008,2010-08-20T08:03Z,"Eevrything is ok except the audio Dolby Digital 5.1 is removed and DTS 5.1 not, which does not work.  I play with Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround ok. I think mikemelo1369 could make the DVD better if he removed DTS 5.1, which takes more space (681MB) and keep Dolby Digital 5.1. Then the vedio quality would be better becasue this way will leave more sapce for vedio part. Normally, the DVD 5 of a movies hould be around 4.36G. This one is 4.02G. So 300mb should is the Dolby Digital 5.1."
