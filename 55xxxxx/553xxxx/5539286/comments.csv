,airmorphone,2012-05-19T06:06Z,This movie is an ode to the transience of the human experience as seen through the eyes of an amazing and unique soul reflecting on the history of a pre-9/11 New York. Thanks for this one. Fucking awesome film. It made a household name of Speed Levich in my household.
