Looks like there's a new translator from there on and he has just tried to guess what they say based on a few words he recognice and what he sees. "
,Zaedroth,2010-06-19T01:01Z,Correction: Starting at episode 194 the subtitles are fine again. So for episode 192-193 I recommend watching without subtitles or switching to english audio if you don't understand much japanese.
