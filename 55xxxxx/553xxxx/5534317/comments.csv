,phinot,2010-05-05T07:04Z,"no extracted, the sound is not as good as the one I posted guy! Don't lie people"
,schnabeltasse,2010-05-05T16:13Z,"phinot, don't be a tool.  You transcoded to m4a."
,sucksucker,2010-05-05T17:19Z,"Simple test to see if something is extracted without loss, AKA demuxed:

Step 1. Demux/extract audio from container.
Step 2. Save/extract audio to WAV
Step 3. Open both files in an audio editor (Audacity will do)
Step 4. Invert one of the tracks.
Step 5. Press play.  If you hear no noise, that means the two tracks are identical, and therefore demuxed/extracted without loss properly.

Go science!"
,phinot,2010-05-06T22:48Z,"not transcoded
i have other sources "
,Swamp_wateR,2010-05-19T04:38Z,come check out my torrent. WAY better quality and i have both tracks! 
[T],kimeesteres,2010-08-28T04:41Z,"To phinot: Why are you always complaining about the quality of everybody's torrents? I can't even count the number of comments of yours that I've seen, bitching and whining about everything. 
If you don't like what you're finding here on TPB, then go get your torrents elsewhere, dude. "
,Darklocq,2011-02-28T04:32Z,"Thanks, nympholept, for all your highly interesting and well-put-together shares.  Just FYI, virtually everyone knows what ""discography"" means. When a torrent is named something like ""Cracksmokin' Buttmonkeys discography"" this is a shorthand for ""Cracksmokin' Buttmonkeys collection, including everything in the artist's discography to the best of the poster's knowledge"".  Guess which type of name most of us would prefer? Not complaining about your shares, just about your treating everyone else on the system as if they were retarded, by beginning all of your shares with the same pointless Wikipedia lecture.  :-/"
