This is the discography of the "Avant-garde" band Vampire Rodents. It contains five of their masterful and essential works as well as Ether Bunny's Papa Woody (Daniel Vahnke's jazz project). If we lived in a perfect world Vampire Rodents would have been up there in the Top 40, mingling with the likes of Hole and Soul Collective. But such was not the case and the project was banished to obscurity... until now that is! Lullaby Land seems to be real popular with the kid these days, so make sure to get it for the sake of looking "hip" or perhaps even "fly" if you're lucky. However, I personally prefer Premonition and also think it's the best starting point (or perhaps Gravity's Rim). If you're having difficulty embracing the band (and even if you aren't) I suggest reading the lyrics as you play the music. A good half of what makes the band so spectacular is Danny Vahnke's twisted poetry (especially Clockseed, that album revolves solely around lyrical content). For all you jazz enthusiasts I've also added Ether Bunny, which never received the love it deserved. As a matter of fact it's criminal that none of these fine albums never received the wider circulation they deserved (although you can purchase Lullaby Land on amazon for around 80 dollars... hmmm). Of course, good ole' Dan "man with the plan" Vahnke is planning on re-releasing all the albums any year now, so be sure to have your wallet at the ready so you can throw all your money at him when the time comes. I know I will...
