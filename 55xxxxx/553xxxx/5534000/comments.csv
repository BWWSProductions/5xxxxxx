TD - put down the crack pipe while you're posting. It makes you're gibberish even harder to read."

Looks like everyone's favorite liberal is back to spamming comments on torrents he doesn't download."
,hayesy316,2010-05-05T02:50Z,"He secretly does download them, Keillor. Even the mentally ill are fundamentally suckers for the truth."
,gordonl,2010-05-05T03:21Z,"Thanks, JW."
,fizdude,2010-05-05T05:15Z,Thank you J!
,booboo332,2010-05-05T23:50Z,"Yup, he's off his pills and trolling for attention again.  As always he displays the barely coherent posts and hate addiction that have become his trademark.

Ah libs, ""Some times you just gotta laugh.""

,booboo332,2010-05-06T05:03Z,"Late?  Such comments betray your narcissistic delusions.  The cartoon is cute but you do realize BP is a British company, right?

As for a girlfriend, I shall paraphrase the Late Benny Hill when he was asked why he didn't want to settle down with one girl.  

""Why would I make one woman so miserable when I can make so many women very happy?""

Suck it up princess.  Neither the world nor this site revolve around you and your drama."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-05-06T08:22Z,"So thats a NO...NO girlfriend, NO sex, basically NO life...I understand why you are on here so much...END"
,booboo332,2010-05-06T19:34Z,"Oh you silly drama queen, are you still trying to play that old tune?  You're on here more than anyone.
I also see your reading comprehension hasn't improved nor has your sense of subtleties or humor.  

What makes you think a person must be in a committed relationship to have sex?  Conservatives have their ""family values"" and libs have their feminist dominated nonsense.  I am free from both and man is it a lot of fun.

You sure do like to jump to conclusions.  I'd hate to see the kind of woman would put up with your nonsense on a daily basis."
