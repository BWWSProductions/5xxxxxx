Release leaked from BHN forums by Ivan Grozny

General Notes
This release works by running scrapebox in a VM with a ripped license.
The license is dead because BHN didn't realise that scrapebox is a clever piece of kit - it
will detect a fake server and use the auxiliary backup. They all used a live license until 
they got banned. They still can't get 1.14.16 to work, but you can :), follow the 
instructions below. If for some intense reason you prefer an older version, I included it 
too. All the bragging about how l33t they are cause they managed to license a VM has been
left in for its comedy value. Visit to their forums is a serious mental prolapse risk.

Prerequisites:
VM Player - http://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer/
Perl - http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/

Install:
1. Unrar
2. Edit your Ethernet Card or Wireless Adapter and manually set a static IP address.
3. After you manually set your IP address under TCP/IP V4, click the advanced button, 
   under IP addresses, click the Add... button and add following IP Addresses: 
   206.214.211.165 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
   208.79.237.176 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
4. Go into server dir and double-click webserver.pl, it should display an empty black window.
5. Run VM image, when asked whether it was copied or moved, select moved.
6. Run scrapebox, do not close the server window.

Enjoy, and if you make some money using this app, BUY IT.
