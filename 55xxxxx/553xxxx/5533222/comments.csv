@all 2040 is the best uploader around , not just for his great quality small sized uploads. he takes time to answer all questions and help people if they have a problem. helping the less fortunate is one of things that i see he loves to do. in my books there should be more 2040's in this world. so please lets do are part and seed .and im sure his green skull is coming soon !!!"

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-04T18:16Z,"@madtown: Yes,  but WBZ screwing us all - it is NOT a DVDSCR, but mid-quality capture, wide-screen but with black-bars on top and bottom to make full-screen 720x480, blurry as hell, colors are washed, picture is dull and bad... bad...bad.
I have it in front of my eyes right now, trying to figure something out.
Maybe - maybe as [quark] 'cause ""this"" cannot be improved nor deserves anything more.

OK?"
,madtown4,2010-05-04T19:06Z,"my trust is in your hand 2040, if i dont see it uploaded, that means you probably saved us from waisting time, if i see it up it will be a share we all can enjoy . well i hope it works out or a better copy shows up. thanks for what you do."
