No cracks out for the Pro version around. Someone claims it's Pro but at the most is Plus. So that's the best I get..."

There's a few uploads on PB but as you said once, there's alot of bad guy's out there and I will wait if you do it"

I've downloaded and tried to install it, but it requires .Net 3.5 and installs so many things that I actually don't need that I've removed it almost immediately. It's absurd to install 500 MB of stuff if you really don't need it, apart the fact that I don't like all the programs that require .Net to work. Personally I 'll go on with my good old Nero 6 and if I want a newer Portable I use Ashampoo Burning Studio that does it with a lot less dimensions and without using .net. Nero is becoming always more and more a bloatware...
Anyway, if you really want it, and you need only the basic version of Nero, there are already out a couple of Mini versions, that give you the burning functions without all the extra and less used stuff."
