The right program to feed your Apple device is undoubtedly i-Studio 5, the desired contents can come from DVD-videos, nearly all common video files (e.g. DivX, HDX4 and WMV), audio-CDs, audio files (e.g. Ogg Vorbis, MP3 and WMA) as well as from a good deal of video clip platforms. i-Studio 5 can handle an extraordinary wide range of source formats and generates MP3/M4A-songs or MP4-video files, which you can copy to iPod, iPod nano, iPod touch, AppleTV and/or your iPhone and which you can enjoy at school, on your way home, in the subway, openly in the living room or secretly in the cellar. 

Sole drop of bitterness: your iPod could belong to an old generation or be polarized to only music and not accept videos. Yet, that doesn't really matter since in this case you still have the pure music, which i-Studio 5 extracts for you even from DVD-music videos - in the space-saving and well proven AAC-format and in full iPod-quality directly into your ears.

Files are transferred as usual with iTunes, the application which accompanied Apple's supremacy in the online music market from the very beginning and which the provider offers for free-of-charge download.
