,zherre,2010-05-14T03:21Z,it seems that i can only play the generals and not the generals zero hour...need help. thanks...
,flandertje,2010-05-18T19:20Z,"Some probs:
When i want to play generals online it says i need to download the update, i did that en then theres a little screen that says: patching... but nothing is patching...
for zero hour: I downloaded your fix and every time i want to start the game , the screen goes black for 1 or 2 seconds and then back to my normal screen were al my shortcuts are on...

Help pleasee ?"
,Felesar,2010-05-23T18:14Z,"@flandertje, let's see if I understand you correctly - you are trying to play this online on the EA-Games network without actually paying for the title? You do realize that there are protections in place to keep this from happening... I mean, if you could get a torrent hack of a game and play it on their servers, do you really think anyone would buy the software?

I'm trying really hard to not get all douchbag here and start screaming about what a moronic thing this is to admit to trying to do, but I'm losing the battle in my head. How can you really expect to play a game online that you didn't pay for? Be happy with single player, or go out and buy it. It's that easy. 

I swear to God, some of the people on here, I really have to wonder how they manage to turn the power on for their rigs. Use your head, really... You want to update the game, find an updated hack. You want to play online, hook up to a lan. You want to play multiplayer on the EA servers with the most current content patches as they are made available? Pay for the game.

It's so easy, why do so few understand the whole concept of TPB. Helloooo... Pirate.....

good luck flandertje."

,nickhead78,2010-06-16T07:09Z,about the final reg fix where is the folder support with delete game from registry in it
,adi5402,2010-07-31T10:50Z,"@Felesar  -- Buddy get ur facts right before u go around blabbering about what people think and do.

This game can be downloaded from a torrent and will work on EA servers look for a keychanger online and then simply find a site with lots of key.

There is nothing like playing RA2 online."
,andersiii,2010-08-02T15:08Z,nice torrent tnks allot :D

,420leaf,2012-05-04T22:44Z,"yo Blaze69 1st let me say thank you for all you've given me and continue to give me, but i am having a few issues. Mainly with the connecting to the server for online play part. On one of the previous torrents left4dead 2 you added the URLs just like this one. here is my problem i cannot figure out how or where to use them. I've created accounts at both the websites read ALL i can on this and still cannot get things like multiplayer or in this case patch updates. after the patch is applied (if it does apply) the game no longer works. I cannot uninstall these games so its hard to jus restart again. I have resulted to just deleting the file out of the games folder maybe you can help me if you do not reply here feel free to email me Josiah.Genesis@gmail.com anytime. thanks in advance and if you could get the 1st empire earth game in english with multiplayer it would be appreciated as well."
,ace1991,2012-05-05T12:31Z,blaze could you please tell me what shall i do to play online?
