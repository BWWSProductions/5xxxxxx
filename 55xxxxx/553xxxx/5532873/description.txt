Calamity Jane is a "Wild West"-themed film released in 1953. It is loosely based on the 
life of Wild West heroine Calamity Jane and explores an alleged romance between Calamity Jane 
and Wild Bill Hickok in the American Old West. The film starred Doris Day as the title 
character and Howard Keel as Hickok. It was devised by Warner Brothers in response to the 
success of Annie Get Your Gun.

It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song ("Secret Love", Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster) 
and was also nominated for Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound, Recording.

The songs and screenplay form the basis of a stage musical of the same name that has 
had a number of productions. The film was also adapted for television in 1963, with 
Carol Burnett in the title role.
