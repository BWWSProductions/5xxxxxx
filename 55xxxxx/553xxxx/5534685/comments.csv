,jackamo,2010-05-05T04:02Z,A great find geogaddi000! Amazing that it has not been pulled from Archive.org Thanks for sharing.
,sicjedi,2010-08-15T01:26Z,"Do not download this version. I believe this is a neutered, watered down, version of the real version. If you listen to the last minute of the documentary, this version versus the original version, you will see what I mean. I believe this is part of Establishment damage control.

I wish there was a torrent that had the original version along with the additional interview with John Decamp, which can be viewed online here:

,matters5,2011-04-03T11:26Z,"There is no ""new version"", just a version that has parts cut out from the original, and has had the video colour changed to make it seem as if it were better quality than the original. Please don't be fooled. 

This is  the ""new version"" with parts cut out: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7725966698433381712#docid=866739408240639313

And this is the original, uncut leaked film (same link commenter sicjedi posted): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7725966698433381712"
,matters5,2011-04-03T11:28Z,"Actually this may be in fact a third version of the film floating around online, (ie. a third in addition to the two versions I posted links to in a previous comment.)"
