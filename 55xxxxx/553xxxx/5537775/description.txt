"In this hilarious act filmed at Club Bene in New Jersey, stand-up comedian and actor Pat Cooper reflects on his childhood growing up in an Italian-American family, using much of this as the foundation for his sidesplitting routine. Peppered among his family stories are entertaining bits of true-life experiences as an up-and-coming touring comic, experience that gave him a broad outlook on the world, or at least, the world according to Cooper."
