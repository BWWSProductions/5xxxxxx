Notes::::::::::::::::::

well watch this last night, great movie, cropped the black bars, their is still some subtitles, which
appear on the picture, i did not crop them due to, they not really that noticable if your watching the
film, and thier not to big either, added some brightness, and contrast, change colours just slightly,
overall looks pretty good, also people seemed to have sync issues with previous releases by other groups
after 1hour 3minute mark, this is in sync Enjoy //prism
