,leprechaun25,2010-05-05T01:53Z,"this appears to be the clear quality winner of the copies released so far. Others are lower resolution and blurrier. Even though this still has some subs occasionally, it's worth it for the higher quality rip."

,itLisLmeLagain,2010-05-16T21:18Z,it's not compleet by 1.02 hour
,xchrisbobisx,2010-05-17T07:48Z,"this movie freezes a hour and 3 min into it, and picks back up 2 min later. its funny because here we have the hero in a town sitting at a tavern drinking beer getting wasted... after the freeze is over, hes getting crucified on a cross and the town is on fire.
there could have been more boring 2 min to miss but alas..."
,blarghhhhh,2010-05-20T19:49Z,"People who rate this crap as good shouldn't be allowed to comment, FOREIGN SUBS = NOT QUALITY. Morons."
