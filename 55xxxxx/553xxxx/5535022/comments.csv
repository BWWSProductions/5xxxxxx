Thank you for the upload, been wanting to see this :)"
,AuRteam,2010-05-06T00:22Z,"No offense, but TPB was a little late on this one. Not bad, but I actually had to go to the theater to see this one (gasp!).

Still, thanks for uploading this, downloading, burning to a disk and playing through a DVD player that upscales to 1080p makes this movie look really good actually. 

A-9
V-7

Thanks for the upload, this movie is awesome!

,Dr_Science,2010-05-06T23:11Z,"An altered TS does not equal a DVDSCR.
A DVD Screener is of......wait for it......DVD QUALITY!!!  an altered TS is just that, a Telesync.  Not to mention the Cinevia protection on the file, couldn't do something about that before uploading?  so that most of the people who download this could watch it?  

I have no problem converting the file to eliminate the protection, but c'mon dude. most people wont know how to do that.

this whole download is FUBAR, and I don't like the direction TPB is headed.

,Dr_Science,2010-05-06T23:14Z,"*edit
not all screeners are of dvd quality, but none that I have seen are this bad, dont agree? then watch a scene in a dark setting and seriously tell me the quality on the video is over a 6 out of 10.  the movie is watchable but the label is heavily misleading.

plus the file is protected so it will only play on your cpu.  just go to the theaters for this one."

,Jezpuh,2010-05-08T18:06Z,I'm so sick of you pussies bitching and whining about the quality. Acting like you DESERVE better quality. Shut the fuck up and be glad someone is putting in the work for you so that you can watch this movie for free. Don't like it? Make a better rip yourself or go see it in the cinema. You fucking people.

,wha007uk,2010-05-09T20:44Z,i have the same cinavia problem mentioned. i fastforwarded it and it passed where it first stopped so i think it might be something to do with being connected to the internet. try disconnecting from internet and then try and watch. im gna try myself and then re-comment

,Adamdudeman,2010-05-10T03:41Z,"I looked into cinavia its apparently some audio watermark that prevents the movie from being played on ps3s and blu ray players. Tried converting using mikojay's suggestion but no good, also tried disconnecting from internet and still wont play on the ps3. Looks like this will be unplayable unless i watch from the pc which just sux balls. Hopefully a workaround will be found."

thank you SaM


@biggeneb03
try watching it in a different way (try vlc player, divx player, burning it to dvd etc etc)

@the rest of you whining about ps3..you should be fuckin shot. 
the file works..end of story. no one cares if it doesn't work on whatever stupid player you are watching it on. if you have an issue there go to the ps3 website etc...and take it up there. the file works/plays fine so stfu.
there are now many different external hard drives that you can buy..that you can connect straight into your tv to play avi files. (for example: the iomega screenplay multimedia hd..etc etc). no need for a buzzing ps3 to be buzzing in the background along with your laptop just to watch a film...

Download the included sample first and decide.

,biggeneb03,2010-06-20T02:05Z,i don't know why people are bitch n bout the video i downloaded perfect (video)...usually  play them in media  player before burning to disk didn't get any sound so didn't burn it ......otherwise besides that it looks like a dvd screener to me atleast you don't have people walking around in front of the screen and standing up  like other downloads lol
,m0joe,2010-06-20T12:46Z,"Cinavia = copy protection...
