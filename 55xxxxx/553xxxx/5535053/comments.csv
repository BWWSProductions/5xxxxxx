Just hope this wont be a ""fleet"" of out-of-focus ice crystals from the planet Urinon (aka toilet dump). Shure those particles are traveling faster than a bullet, but so is the space station in the same direction. It's all relative up there anyways.

Im not saying theyre not seeing weird shit up there, because there are some interesting stuff taken from the live streams from NASA. Just don't get your panties in a bunch every time you see lots of small apparantly blinking bright lights buzzing around the spaceshuttle/ISS or whatever."

In another clip, and object abruptly slowed and made a 90 degree turn. I'm not saying their authentic without a shadow of a doubt, but it definitely wasn't mundane space junk."
