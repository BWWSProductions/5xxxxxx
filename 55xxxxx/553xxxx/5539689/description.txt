I could not find any information on this disc on the internet.  It came in a pack of PC/MAC games for school aged children.

The discs all reference www.somc.com but that site seems to belong to another group now.  The phone number for technical support on the disc is 1 800 878 9942.  The other discs in this pack (all SOMC) are all "reader rabbit's" and other The Learning Company software.  I have a feeling these discs were made by a company that was bought by TLC

So perhaps SOMC is an old company name.  http://www.aboutus.org/Somc.com

Any how, I think all Trekkie fans, young and old will like it.  I do not know if it is MAC compatible as the disc doesn't say and I don't have a Mac.

ENJOY!
