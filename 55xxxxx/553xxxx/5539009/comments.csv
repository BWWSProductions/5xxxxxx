,IAmTheMilkman,2010-05-22T00:52Z,"Hey, if you have season 4 uncut, could you please upload it? All the torrents I've found of it so far are dead."
,arbitrator212,2010-05-24T17:16Z,"Can someone pls upload. Most of us have about 3% left before download is complete.

I don't have season 4, im hoping someone will upload that one too."
,AnonyMissMe,2010-05-28T06:52Z,I do have Season 4 uncut but it is scheduled for DVD release in the fall so I won't torrent them unless that doesn't happen.
,arbitrator212,2010-05-28T10:39Z,"thank you very much for reseeding, whoever it is."
,arbitrator212,2010-05-28T10:59Z,"Anony, could you please reseed season 4.  Im from UK and i can only buy from import here, but they are charging $100+ for each season."
,AnonyMissMe,2010-05-28T22:29Z,"The only reason S1-3 cost a lot is because they're out of print. Plus I haven't seen them go that high per season on eBay, or I would've sold mine already.

If the Lionsgate release happens you can import from Amazon.com at a price no higher than any other similar boxset."
,AnonyMissMe,2010-06-14T21:49Z,"Good news just announced today. Season 1-3 are being re-released on DVD by Lionsgate.

This bodes well for the Season 4 release actually happening IMO."
