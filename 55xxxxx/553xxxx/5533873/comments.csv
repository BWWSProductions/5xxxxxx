,Skywize,2010-06-21T16:44Z,"Ok, can someone tell me if this is the ORIGINAL disk? As in, I can put in a valid serial?"

,ashwin.terminator,2010-08-01T18:50Z,"Perfecto!!

,deviousdinosaur,2010-08-04T09:16Z,"I'm not sure that anyone can answer my question, though I give it a try:

I have a pre-installed Home Premium (Hungarian language) on my Asus notebook and on the bottom side of the computer there's a product key. Since I don't want to use the recovery partition or DVD for many reasons, I've decided to download an original copy of Win 7 installer, and use my Home Premium key to activate it.

My question is: will I be able to install and use Home Premium by downloading this torrent and activating the operating system with the key supplied with the notebook or this installer is only for Ultimate, and I won't succeed?

(I don't care about the language, I'll manage with the English version, though my original win is Hungarian)"
,zacksully,2010-08-07T18:35Z,"guys i just download the torrent, now im using Vista for 2 years and i have no idea how to set up win 7
can anybody give me the set up instructions? i will be really appreciated"
,seedrr,2010-08-19T22:29Z,"Great upload, works great with 7loader for activation. Thanks!"
,Fujirich,2010-10-11T23:16Z,"I've been having MONUMENTAL problems with reinstalling Windows 7 and have tried several Win7 torrents from here but this has been the ONLY one that has worked with no issues.
I've used it in conjunction with Hazar's 7Loader and it seems to be working fine.
This download is WELL WORTH THE TIME TO GET IT!
Thaknk muchly to the uploader!!!"
,Fujirich,2010-10-12T16:38Z,"Okay...I thought this had worked like a charm until I deleted the old partition on the other drive that had the old copy of Windows on it. Now I can't boot Windows from the CD or HD as bootmgr.exe is missing.
I've checked the CD and bootmgr.exe is definitely there but there was a problem with ""renaming files"" when the CD was burnt despite me burning at the minimum possible speed with Nero 8. I've re-burnt the Cd several times with the same issues so ow I'm trying to download bootmgr.exe from the net and replace the one on the CD with it."
,ocyrus70,2010-10-23T10:02Z,had a problem when i copyed to cd would not boot then i had a think and copyed to dvd then not one problem one of the best torrents out their a lot of 7 torrents are not as untouched as the uploaders say thakyou DjAligator14!!..
,ben198321,2011-04-07T15:05Z,"This says it's untouched, thats BS because I installed this without burning it, right from my 2nd HD. When I got to the ""enter product key"" screen I just clicked next and it continued. When Windows was loaded I checked to see if it was activated and it was with a product key. I did windows updates except for the one that says it checks for non genuine windows. Everything works gr8. Its's just cracked and not ""untouched""."
