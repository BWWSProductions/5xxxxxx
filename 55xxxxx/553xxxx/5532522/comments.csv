[V],twentyforty,2010-05-04T11:56Z,"Sorry. I'll wait for DVD/BR. Just look at the schedule - and - I have sky-high ratio on IM2 so far (so as you) and misery of seeders, mostly hit&run folk...
Meanwhile, Flawl3ss has over 1000 seeders and PrisM would have like zillion.
Right now, therefore, [quark]s are on thin ice. Very thin. Again."
