Bully Beatdown is an American reality television series from Mark Burnett that airs on MTV. In each episode, bullies are confronted by Jason "Mayhem" Miller and challenged to an upcoming mixed martial arts bout against a professional mixed martial artist for a chance to win $10,000.

Each fight features two three-minute rounds: the first consists of grappling (no striking allowed), and the second round involves kickboxing. The bullies begin each round with $5,000 in potential earnings; each time the bully taps out in the first round, $1,000 of his potential earnings go to the victim, and if the fight is stopped in the second round by KO, TKO, or referee, the bully loses the entire sum. In the unlikely scenario that the bully can KO the MMA fighter, he wins money in addition to his first round earnings and the $5,000 from the second round.
