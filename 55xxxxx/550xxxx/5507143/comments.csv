,atnixon,2010-05-15T11:48Z,"Could of said somewhere that there just god damn tutorials.................... what a waste of time. 

^ ^ ^ the torrent title says Lynda.Com...that should be enough for you to realise that its not the program, research what your downloading before you bitch about them."
,arzie,2010-05-25T02:14Z,Thanks for sharing!
,Tulkoju,2010-06-04T02:25Z,"agree with atnixon. Trikathik & Ministry- could've typed ""Lynda.com"" into your browser.
Apart from that, consider the words ""new features"" and Ministry could've read the comment above by Trikathik!
btw, Lynda.com tutorials cost money and are considered quite good. I find them to be excellent. Why pay for a college course when you can learn at home?"
,chasekh,2010-07-07T20:43Z,thanks
,bathcolin,2010-12-16T14:17Z,"*** For the whining bitches ***

IT SAYS LYNDA.COM THEREFORE IT IS A TUTORIAL

IF YOU KNOW NOTHING, DON'T BITCH AND MOAN BECAUSE YOU ARE A RETARD. FFS.

BLACKTROY IS A SUPERB SUPPLIER OF TORRENTS SO DON'T GO AROUND KNOCKING THIS PERSON. IF IT WAS UP TO ME I WOULD BAN YOU DICKS. CUNTS THE LOT OF YOU."
