[T],solstars,2010-05-07T15:46Z,Too bad you can't read.  The descriptiojn clearly states 59.93 fps.  Remux or get a better processor.

A 8/10 (perfectly clear and in sync but only 2 channel as stated, would be 10 if it was surround but im not even sure if this movie came out with 6 chan sound)

V 10/10

Audio and video is as good as you can expect from a 80s movie, great movie thanks for your effort mate great rip."
