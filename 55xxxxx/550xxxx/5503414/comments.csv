,RecycledElectrons,2010-04-23T05:33Z,"After 4 days (4/18/2010 to 4/22/2010) we're at 37% for those leeching. That means that we might reach 100% by the end of April. 

Once the mass of leechers reaches 100%, this will download much faster."
,RecycledElectrons,2010-04-26T07:39Z,"As of 4/26/2010, we're at 75% for the leechers, and I've managed to get a friend to help me seed. By the end of the week, we'll have fast seeds. 

PLEASE SEED!"
