It's a raging drug war that has turned Phoenix, Ariz., into the second kidnapping capitol of the world. NGC correspondent Lisa Ling embeds with the Phoenix Police Department as they investigate the latest drug-related kidnapping, uncover a cache of $3 million worth of marijuana and ambush suspects at a ransom drop-off. Then, we'll cross the border and ride along with a photojournalist on his crime beat in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico - the deadliest city in North America.
