This is the original StarCraft install.exe file renamed to StarCraft.mpq (for No-CD compatibility with the latest patch) but with a little bonus.

Most of the in-game music has been replaced with extractions from the StarCraft Soundtrack Audio CD, which features dramatically improved sound quality over what is included with the game. Some tracks were not replaced due to the fact that they were inherently lossy as if they came from the game (protoss3, for example). Others were not included because they could not be individualized or looped properly.

More notes to come when time allows.
