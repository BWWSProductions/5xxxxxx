,smuglr420,2010-05-16T02:15Z,"hey man you say the file is mkv and it def isn't, it is an mp4, that's misleading, other downloaders out there, avoid downloading this, it says there's surround sound but there isn't and it is an mp4 not mkv"
,smuglr420,2010-05-16T02:17Z,"this file is not an mkv, don't be mislead, the sound is shitty stereo"
,smuglr420,2010-05-16T02:20Z,"this shouldn't even be under the high res category cause the video  is an mp4, you get that im pissed about being mislead there was 5.1 available which is non existent"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-05-18T15:18Z,I'm not even gonna tell you anything since you're too stupid to even read the description.
,LightTheRebellion,2010-08-28T19:40Z,"smuglr420 is completely wrong. Don't even listen to that baked shitpie. He's talking out of his fucking ass because that's where his larynx ended up after he was brutally deep-throated by life.

The audio and video are great."
,jayawarden,2010-11-09T09:19Z,"Thanks a lot.
Please rip Indian Blu-Ray movies in MP4."
