"Shoot to Thrill" is the second song on the album Back in Black by hard rock band AC/DC. This song is also the second track of AC/DC Live and AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition, and is included on AC/DC: Iron Man 2.

On January 26, 2010, the music video for "Shoot to Thrill" was released with exclusive footage from the film Iron Man 2. The live concert footage used in the video was filmed in December, 2009 at a concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the Estadio River Plate.

Back in Black is a hard rock album by Australian band AC/DC. It is the seventh Australian and sixth internationally released studio album by the band.

Released on 25 July 1980, Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who died on 19 February 1980 at the age of 33, and was dedicated to him. The band considered disbanding following Scott's death, but they ultimately decided to continue and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. Producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce. The recordings were made at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, and Electric Lady Studios in New York, where the album was also mixed.

The album was remastered and re-released in 1994, then again in the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC remasters series in 2003 by George Marino. In addition, a Dualdisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.

The album has sold an estimated 49 million copies to date worldwide, making it the second highest selling album of all time, as well as the best selling album ever released by a band. On 13 December 2007, the RIAA certified it 22Ã— Multi Platinum, recognising sales of 22 million in the United States.
