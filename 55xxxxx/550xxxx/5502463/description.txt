The MC Lars & YTCracker collaborative album "The Digital Gangster LP" 
http://www.merchdirect.com/mclars
I ripped this into FLAC from an original CD with MediaMonkey.

We Have Arrived was reissued on MC Lars' "This Gigantic Robot Kills" album; I have it there and not here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5227600
I did not care for "Birth of a Phish" and "Kidney Stones For Easter", but the rest of the album is here.
