,laptopdog,2010-04-20T09:27Z,"Hi again twentyforty.. this is not a 'request' as such, just letting you know that I'm also interested in The Tudors, so were you to start uploading it, I'd be a willing downloader/seeder!

And your work is also very much appreciated here in Australia too, by the way!

@JoSox:
I agree that most of The Tudors files are massively big (I sympathise because I only have a limited monthly download allotment too), but you can download 550MB-sized season 4 episodes (so far only episodes 1&2) from the uploader called VTV here on Piratebay if that helps?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-20T09:39Z,@JoSox: Yes. In about 6 hours from now. However. it's funny somehow 'cause I've upped DVDSCR for Tud ep.1 and 2 a month ago. and deleted torrent few hours later because no one has been interested.
