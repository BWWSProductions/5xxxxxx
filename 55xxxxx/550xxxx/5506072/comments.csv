,NYCRocker,2010-04-28T02:26Z,Works perfect! Question. I know you can burn this to DVD and boot from it to defrag the drive but can do the same with a USB drive? Thanks
,JSIT99,2010-04-28T19:02Z,This is for this pro. Others should take care
,NYCRocker,2010-05-03T15:40Z,My bad...I meant to ask the question not make the statement. Can you boot Drive Genius from a USB flash drive and defrag w/Drive Genius?
,NYCRocker,2010-05-09T02:30Z,Hello...anybody else able to get this to boot from DVD? I used Disk Utility to burn the image file but the DVD won't boot. Anyone?
