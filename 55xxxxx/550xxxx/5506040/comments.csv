Great upload.  Very timely considering many more Poles recently died in Russia, on their way to Katyn."
,ehunter,2010-04-24T06:10Z,"No English is spoken in this movie, no alternate audio tracks, and there are no English Subtitles."
,ehunter,2010-04-24T06:19Z,You can DL the subs at an alternate website only after you give them all kinds of your personal information. I wont do it...
,ehunter,2010-04-24T16:58Z,I take back the above comment. Knowing which links to click on gives you access to the subs file without having to provide your personal information. I would prefer these kinds of things  not be separated from the original torrent though. It wasted too much of my time.

[V],-jonny-,2010-05-31T19:01Z,"@bxb. Your torrent has incorrect aspect ratio, and the quality is inferior, and there are no seeds, and this one is well seeded. Kindly step aside."
,bxb,2010-06-06T19:06Z,@jonny: care to grace us with the couple of frame dumps so we could compare the two? and explain 'incorrect' a/r in my torrent and what made you to come to this conclusion?
,bxb,2010-06-06T19:48Z,"@jonny: I take my questions back - just noticed the a/r of the original bluray is 2.38:1, while my torrent stands at 1.78:1, thus portions of the source were cropped out. Still, it is 720p and looks much sharper=better IMO. "
[V],-jonny-,2010-06-20T22:14Z,"no it doesn't, bxb, and no one wants hardcoded polish subs. mine looks much better and the aspect ratio is correct. "
