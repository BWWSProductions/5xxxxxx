,rjames,2010-04-22T09:11Z,great job for dvd users! Any idea why there are no blu ray uploads as yet?

,weaping_reaper,2010-04-22T18:30Z,"okay, the other 7 gig torrent I downloaded was the BOMB .. so this one might be even better!!!! I cant weight!!!"
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T18:38Z,"this should definitely not be a bomb...maybe ""da bomb""...lol...it is 100% exact of the original DVD9 (Double Layer) dvd i bought from Wal*Mart"
,zrehman,2010-04-22T19:11Z,"Why is it going so slow?

It also says, ""Torrent returned an error: Torrent deleted or not in pool yet....""

Anyone know what this means?

Thanks."

,weaping_reaper,2010-04-22T20:43Z,"lol, yeah, da Bomb!!! its only @ 14% right now

,weaping_reaper,2010-04-22T20:46Z,"ha! so you are the first.. it came out today! today is Thursday, and you got it here first."
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T21:00Z,yes sir (or ma'am!!!)...went and bought the Blu-Ray + DVD combo pack at midnight from Wal*Mart...actually i got the last combo pack on the shelves :)
,Robo88,2010-04-22T21:06Z,the Na'vi subtitle is embedded on movie? or must be selected from menu?
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-22T21:30Z,Pretty awesome. not enough seeders yet for it to run at max speed tho
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T21:42Z,"i just played it on my computer and selected ""none"" for subtitles and the Na'vi subtitles were therre...so they are embedded"
,Robo88,2010-04-22T22:15Z,thanks
,zrehman,2010-04-22T22:40Z,@ctang Thanks for uploading and sharing the movie! I'm at 4.89% :-( ... I know that you are uploading as fast as you can ... I will be patient ^_^
,zrehman,2010-04-22T23:18Z,HOLY CRAP! It just jumped to 1.22 MB/sec!
,tsrejca,2010-04-22T23:23Z,Interesting .... when I started downloading there was 4 seeders .... now there is only 1
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-22T23:27Z,"hey, you say you have the Blu-ray also.. can you upload that tonight?"
,joy2000,2010-04-22T23:41Z,Any body knows why there hasn't been a blue ray upload?
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T23:41Z,"there is currently only one seed and thats me...i have only up'd about 5GB so far so there cant be more than 1 seeder

@weaping_reaper: if i had a blu-ray drive for my computer i would but i dont...all i have is a ps3...sorry"
,somma2000,2010-04-23T01:29Z,Avatar uses a new BluRay copy protection which hasn´t been cracked yet; that´s why the BluRay Rip hasn´t been released yet. Slysoft is working on it; they say it´s gonna take 1-2 weeks. Check http://forum.slysoft.com
,rod89301,2010-04-23T01:50Z,Thanks
,3e7en,2010-04-23T01:56Z,"I'm wondering why is Demonoid text file in the download folder ?!!!

and by accident there is a torrent with the exact same size in Demonoid uploaded 1 week ago !"
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T02:22Z,"yes, 4 real, where did the seeders go? Im at 55.1 % .............."
[T],ctang,2010-04-23T02:49Z,"the demonoid file is in there in case i wanted to upload this on there...i tried to do it but i couldnt figure out how to so i gave up...disregard the demonoid

3e7en: if you need me to take a picture of the Blu-Ray disc and dvd i will if you think that i downloaded this from demonoid...just saying"
[T],ctang,2010-04-23T02:51Z,i dont have any idea where the seeders have gone bc as of right now i am the only one and i am still seeding...it wont be very long til there are more seeders!!!
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T03:25Z,"i know if this is the best copy ive ever seen? i will stop seeding my other 7 gig copy, and will seed this till november!!!"
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T03:45Z,"61.7%, it doesnt look like its gonna be done by the time i go to bed tonight :-( damn, and i was wanting to see!!!!!! but i still have 3 hours, hopefully, i will achieve  100%  before i clock out tonight"
[T],ctang,2010-04-23T03:46Z,"this will be as good as it gets (as far as an exact dvd copy is concerned)...only way it gets better is if you get a blu-ray copy and use that output to put directly onto a ps3 or use a computer to connect to an HDTV...but since that isnt possible yet, this is as good as it gets
should be some people that have this done...would be nice if those people could confirm that this is a worth download...thanks"
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T04:29Z,hey
,zrehman,2010-04-23T04:34Z,"I'm only at 28.80% :(

[T],ctang,2010-04-25T08:41Z,"@vinist2: try using Elbys CloneDVD2...there are detailed instructions on what to do if you want to compress it to a single layer dvd-r that i have wrote and contained in the link...o and i cant remember if i put instructions for putting it on a DL disc so if you do, here is what to do:
1. after installing the program open it up
2. click clone dvd
3.  browse (its the orange circle top right) to your Avatar folder (what you downloaded from this torrent)
4. select dvd -/+ DL from the middle bottom
5. next
6. select all the languages and subtitles that you want to preserve
7. next
8. make sure ""dvd writer"" is selected
9. volume label: Avatar
10. if you have more than 1 dvd writer, make sure the one you want to use is selected
11. check delete temp when done
12. go
13. Eject and enjoy!! :)

[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-26T01:21Z,Hey Ctang. Yeah for some reason I can't find Last Crusade and my Crystal Skull isn't working properly I'm having issues with the disk. Gotta love lending stuff to family members lol. If there's any chance you could put those 2 up that'd be great bro.

[T],ctang,2010-05-03T05:14Z,"ya if you are putting this on a single layer dvd they you have to use a program to compress it down to dvd5
for windows users i suggest: Nero or Elby's CloneDVD2
for mac users i suggest: Toast Titanium 10 or DVD2OneX"
,LetheAlbion,2010-05-09T17:21Z,um so why are there 20 files and how do i get them down to just one movie file?
[T],ctang,2010-05-10T04:08Z,"that would be because this is an exact copy of a dvd which include .bup, .ifo and .vob files...what you're looking for is an .avi file"

[T],ctang,2010-05-14T18:25Z,"@lamerbr: how the fuck can you say its crap when it has been downloaded over 700 times and your the ONLY one who thinks its crap...get a fucking life and dont tell lies...you probably think its crap bc your a god damn noob that instead of asking how to use the files you just say its crap

im not downing n00bs bc everyone was there once but if you cant ask for help then dont download...its as simple as that"
,hyster13,2010-05-15T03:54Z,"Yeah ctang!!! Tear that noob a new asshole, that asshole. Do what ctang suggest or get a dual layer dvd-rewriter and dual layer dvds. It's a simple as that. I got your back, ctang. Keep up the good shit and fuck these cats that hate on you because of their noobness."
[T],ctang,2010-05-15T22:42Z,"i dont know if people think bc i dont have that coveted pink skull yet that i dont know what im doing here, but i have been making exact copies of movies for the last 5 years...im no n00b on the matter...people need to learn how to read instead of just going off and making some ridiculous comment and showing how much of a n00b they really are"

(2 disc extended edition)

Thank You... "
[T],ctang,2010-05-17T05:10Z,"@hyster13: haha...thanks

,Logic0104,2010-05-28T21:21Z,"Have Been Reading some coments and gotta back ya up whos the cock who wrote Craaap, typical get it for free then moan, I wonder which torrents he/she posts (none I Bet).anyway A quick question, I Never compressed a dual layer, I got Nero 9 , Can Ya gimme a bit of guidance, oh and every time i try to post a ISO Torrent they Fail , What am I doing wrong ,  Use Bit torrent ????  ya probably guessed Im New to this, But I got Thousands of great Files to Share, Audio and DVD and I Really wanna share as most are from genuine discs (thats why I wanna use ISO to keep original quality) Big thanks for any reply ....."
[T],ctang,2010-06-02T05:18Z,"@Logic0104: thanks for backing me up...as for your problem, to create a torrent first of all you have to know if it is one file or multiple files...if it is a single file then you want to start off by clicking ""Add File"" then select your file you want to make a torrent out off...then add some trackers...choose piece size or keep it automatic...then click create and save as...this should be all you need for a single file torrent (by single file i mean no folder or anything...just the .iso in your case)

but if you wan to create a multifile torrent (directory) then you change the ""add file"" instruction in the single file torrent to clicking the ""add directory"" and then the instructions are the same

hope this helps!!! let me know how it goes"
