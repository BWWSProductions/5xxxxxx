Don't believe it, look on imdb and you'll see it is mono(1 channel).
Also the original is 192 KB/s not 128 KB/s as the other torrent. "
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-04-18T23:27Z,"Apropo anamorphic 2.35:1, you can watch it either default like this:

or stretched to window(full screen) like this:

Nothing was cropped from the picture, you can set the AR on your player and TV as you like."

[V],Zen_Bud,2010-04-21T14:20Z,Mkvonly! Stop spamming mine torrent with yours stupid comments!
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-04-21T15:26Z,"you spam my torrent with your link, I never link my torrents to other's torrents.

I didn't leave stupid comment, I only said that this movie was made in mono and all dvd-s on the net & acording to imdb, including my source(and yours too mostlikely) are mono but your rip is of course stereo. That is weird!

 I wasn't spamming, I just wondered about the audio track.
 I even said that I downloaded some of your torrents and they were cool. 
 Why didn't you call zmacdaddy8's comment stupid (and rude) instead you say it about my comment. What I said was a fact.
 At least you could have said that the dvd had indeed mono sound but you converted it to a ""fake stereo"" with Audacity or something, I don't know, I never did it before."
