,bbaer02,2010-04-21T23:27Z,A++ 10/10 for a SCR. Watermarked though.
,Intoxified_1,2010-04-22T05:38Z,"GREAT DL speed!! 130 kbs  solid on a 3 meg connection. Im sorry that I dont share your need to donate to Haiti. I feel more inclined to donate to local children in need rather than help a country that never gave us a wink until they needed help. Keep it local. Help those that would help U if U were in the same place. Thats just my opinion, but do whatever makes U feel good inside! Thanx for the Upload!"
