,MakMan06,2010-04-22T11:04Z,"sounds appealing, but seriously, a movie like this must be enjoyed in Bluray :( Anyone know when a BDRip release will be out?"
,ActionWaction,2010-04-22T15:09Z,I'm also looking forward to the BDrip
,Dx100,2010-04-22T17:01Z,"Usually rips come weeks before the official release. What makes the difference with avatar and especially BDRip? Maybe there is a difficulty to rip this one as in amazon buyers are advised to upgrade the firmware to ensure the playback of this title.

""Please note: This edition of the film is not in 3D. Also, we recommend customers with older Blu-ray players update their player firmware to ensure successful playback of this product."""

,freddyhkf,2010-04-23T03:55Z,"News about the Bluray copy:

People have already gotten their hands on the Blu-ray but it unfortunately uses a new BD+ copy protection. Slysoft's AnyDVD HD is usually the first to be able to deal with it and they're saying as recently as yesterday in their forums it's going to be at least a week or two once they get their hands on it."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-04-23T07:01Z,"@freddyhkf, thanks for the info.."
,Harutik_11,2010-04-23T10:19Z,"Sucks that we wont see a BD Rip in a while.
Usually I download 1-2 gb BD-rips, but in Avatars case, Im willing to go for the higher ones, maybe 4-10 gb ones."
,e3poso,2010-04-23T11:04Z,"Wait for the Bluray rip, I only skipped through this copy and now I'm going to delete it

[V],MKVGuy,2010-04-24T07:47Z,"@xads308, rename the .SRT file other than the name of the .MKV file or delete it or keep in a different folder.."
,pbfriend,2010-04-24T17:41Z,mkvguy could u rip Minority Report (starring Tom Cruise) if possible.
,slats649,2010-04-26T14:45Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."
