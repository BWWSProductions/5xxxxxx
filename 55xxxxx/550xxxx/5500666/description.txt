Glenn Beck Program for April 16th 2010


Storytime

My father and I were heading over to a customer's house to pick up some furniture. We needed to stop for gas. We pulled into an Lukoil and got gas. No big deal.

Well they have those TVs at the pumps now. This little infomercial started playing...some stupid guy talking about how we need to do more to be green. It was all the same crap that they always say so it didn't stand out to me very much...until the end...

The guy said, "If they aren't being green, you should be mean." I wasn't even looking paying attention to it but that made me do a 180. They had the guy's name on the screen. "David Greenberg".

I sent a text to someone and asked them to look up who they were since I wasn't able to. They told me he was a Prof. at Rutgers and an author.

Well, that didn't satisfy me. I looked him up...found the same stuff...

I was a bit confused since nobody I could find looked like the guy that was in the infomercial.

I kept digging...and then I found him...

David Greenberg, Ph.D., is the President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette (since October, 2001) and previously served as the President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Delaware (1996-2001).

Also, a history of his political donations.

Ok...Storytime is over now...
