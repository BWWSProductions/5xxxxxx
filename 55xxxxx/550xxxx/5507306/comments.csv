,angelo737,2010-04-24T04:26Z,"hello sir,
how are you? according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mayday_episodes#Season_7

those episodes are from season 7. is it right?"
,bwab,2010-04-24T09:43Z,"Angelo, correct..."
,angelo737,2010-04-24T18:26Z,"ok bwab, tkz

just because everybody is putting the videos like season 8, but is season 7.
but afterall that's no the most important not even the image quality, but only the documentary itself! ;)

kind regards!"
,mameroms,2010-04-25T19:40Z,"on the official website it says series 8??

doesn't really matter though :)"
,angelo737,2010-04-26T02:16Z,"official website? you mean national geographic?
i can't find that information there...

can you please send us the link?"
,havocgeneral,2010-04-26T02:46Z,"Not even National Geographic can explain why this is season 8, if you look through the listing on their site you'll see there is a big hole where season 6 is meant to be yet every episode is accounted for.

I have episode 8 captured but it is a 12GB AVI file, anyone got a guide on how to get it into xvid format (win 7 x64)?"
[V],captainahmed,2010-04-26T07:10Z,"I think this season is named as S08 Because there were a special report season which consists of 5 episodes and only 3 of them were uploaded !
If anybody have the missing 2 I Would personally be glad to get them !"
,Bobman84,2010-04-28T06:57Z,"captainahmed, those specials are on here."
