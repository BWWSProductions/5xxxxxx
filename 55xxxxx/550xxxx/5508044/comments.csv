stuck @ 99.9% as of 2133CST may02 2010"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-05-05T04:50Z,@ Kanatiki. You still need me to seed? I just read the comment now. I can reseed if needed.
,billyrust1,2010-06-15T20:59Z,I would love it if someone else seeded for just a little bit. I've been at 90% for a long time now! Thanks
,70sChild,2010-07-23T01:24Z,"Sitting at 99% done.

,BCtheDJ,2012-03-03T03:37Z,"Appears a problem with this, but can be *fixed*
(as long as you are ok with some 'hacking' of files - smile)

The 'original seeds' seem to be gone
So the 'complete files' as listed are not available anymore
And now we're seeding short

Will only be able to download 99.63%  -  or 4.31 GB (appx.)
Of the Total File Archive that's listed at 4.32 GB
After that, no more available

However, once you get all possible, go to the VIDEO_TS Folder
Inside will find the 4 .VOB Files that came up 'short'
5_1,2,3 and 6_1 (should have "".part"" as .xtension name)

Remove the "".part"" - so "".VOB"" will be the "".xtension name""

Then use the 'File Archive/Folders/etc' as you would normally

...........

The above is what I did, and it works fine
Did a test of 'drag the progress bar'
Got no skips - no *apparent* problems
All seems to work Fine - A/OK

What happened? No idea, but 'guesstimate'
Perhaps the 'original' was 'mis-calculated' on size
And now it 'appears' short, but in reality is not
Or is actually short, but not THAT short in total
So perhaps we get a 'glitch' that is very minor, quite small
That will show up as 'blip' or 'hic-up'
When Played at Normal Viewing Speed in DVD Player

Either way - again - do the 'magic re-name' above
And it should work fine - come out 'ok'"
,BCtheDJ,2012-03-06T02:05Z,".

Well - that 'fix' offered above is 'so-so-maybe'

Found some 'skips' during 'Normal Playback'

About :20, then 1:20, and several toward 'Ending'

Not TOO annoying (least for me - slide it back a bit, re-play)

But do be AWARE of what's what if you try this 'fix'

And as always, of course, Your Milage May Vary
