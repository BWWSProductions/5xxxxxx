Have you put your crack in the folder of the Ubisoft Game Launcher?

The Crack is NOT supposed to go in the folder of the actual game.

It works as it should and I followed it correctly, including putting the crack in the Ubisoft folder and NOT the game folder."

,jan765,2010-04-23T08:13Z,"Is it possible that this is like an emulator?


This crack uses a ""skidrow"" profile, meaning you restart the game. You can still play using the old emulator, but if you play using this a new profile skidrow is made. YOu can move your old saves to this :)


But anyways. I ""replayed"" using this.

When I was in Mario's training, it somehow skipped ""disarm"" training. The other training were there.

I'm just trying to confirm it though.

It works flawlessly no crashes, but it feels like something is missing =.="
,jan765,2010-04-23T08:16Z,"are you 100% this works, finished game, 100% memory synce as in, assain's tombs, altair's armor and stuff?


The old emulator EMU SPIRE that i got before was FLAWLESS 100%, you just have to update values.db

I deleted that because I saw the name SKIDROW :) Now i'm trying this restarting.
But yeah, i feel like it skipped the ""disarm"" part of the training and I'll see if it's missing some ""interact"" like the old emulators.

Some emulators got stuck on sarcophagus that you cant open with shift. Updating values.db fixed that though.

But yeah, can anyone confirm that this is the complete?

That ""disarm"" training really isnt here -.- which is weird :o 

And, giovanni's letters, I cant read them. On the emulator, I COULD.
This one keep saying ""they are sealed"" ""reading them would be wrong""

but again, can anyone confirm what I'm saying? xp"

File format has nothing to do with it. It doesn't matter if its a fucking dll or a db file. This crack IS a copy of the values.db from the server emulator, deal with it, and it isn't re written.

So basically, this crack is yet ""another"" emulator, just that it doesn't show the cmd and crap.

Damnit, I KNEW this was i like emulator.
Some things were missing!

Like, in Mario's training, this crack skips the ""disarm"" training.

It was better to use EMU SPIRE + latest values.db from the clearing house. I played with full dlc (templar lair and other tombs) and basically everything in the game was there.
I THINK :p
It didn't feel like anything was missing but there probably was.

The original emu spire values.db was SIMILAR to this skidrow one. They have similar ""missing unlocks"" and in emu spire values.db, you cant unlock tomb 5 sarcophagus.

All I did was update from the clearinghouse and voila everything was solid.
When I made a new game, new 'things"" were added.

I could also OPEN **Giovanni's Letters** with the latest values.db from ClearingHouse.

In Skidrow crack, and the Emu SPire's original values.db, you couldn't open because they were ""sealed"".

Weird.
Skidrow steals!!
Meaning Reloading and Razor are still dope "
,Lumberjacks,2010-04-24T13:02Z,"@jan765

What is ClearingHouse?

I like this release, but it  seems to come with a few ''bugs'' if you will. The sealed Giovanni Letters are annoying, but not horrible.

I'd like to know whether i can use all of Creed's content. Content like: Palazzo Medici, Santa Maria Dei Frari and Arsenal Shipyard from Creed's ''Special Editions'' and content from Uplay: Assassin's Creed II Theme, Extra Throwing Knives Capacity, Altaïr Outfit and Auditore Family Crypt.

I would also like to know whether the DLC content is available in this release. Can anyone confirm this? And if its not available, how to make this content available? Thanks in advance."

Whats really interesting though is at the end when they say: ""What reason will you use, when we pre the next Ubisoft game?"" let's hope this means we can get a fully cracked version of Splinter Cell Conviction soon (more specifically before release). By the way, I am still unsure if this crack completely removes the protection because the values.db hasn't been completed if I remember correctly, I hope it is I'm just not sure.

,Reaper24,2010-06-10T09:04Z,"^ Thanks for the quick reply, mate. I'll just go ahead and crack the game. Apparently, Nod32 and Kaspersky say it's clean.

At this point, I'm pretty sure that your only option is getting rid of Avast! and then reinstalling the game if it still doesn't work. Then you can reinstall Avast! as well. From then on, stop the on-access scan when launching the game's exe.

I'll try terminating the on-access protection before launching the game, as well. If the same happens to me regardless, I'll just say fuck it and switch to Kaspersky or something. I have history with AVG and Avast! doing this kind of shit, so it's probably gonna happen sooner or later, but we'll see."

Lastly, I Also usually have a bit of lag during gameplay, which might also be the reason for unsynced sound. I'm pretty sure this is due to my computer's processor, since my graphics and everything else is good enough, but if anyone is also experiencing lag NOT due to hardware, please reply.

Also, many people are having trouble installing this game, so I'm going to help out. Really all you have to do is follow instructions, but I'll break it down for you. 
1. Download torrent.
2. Mount the ISO to a virtual drive (I used a program called ""Virtual CloneDrive"")
3. On the Virtual Drive, click the ""autorun"" icon and then from there install the game.
4. Go to the UPDATE folder on the virtual drive and run the application, which will the do the update.
5. Go to the SKIDROW folder on the VirtualDrive and ""Copy"" all the contents from it. Then go to your C Drive and go to Program Files or Program Files(x86) and go the file ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"". Then just right click inside the folder and hit paste. Then it should say to either copy and replace and another option, hit ""Copy And Replace!""
6. Click on the ""atuorun"" icon on the Virtual Drive, and play the game.

If it didn't work after doing all of that, it is either due to your insufficient hardware, inability to properly follow instructions, or some other problem to do with your computer, there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG with the torrent, no trojan or anything. 

I ran this all on Windows 7 64bit WITH AVG installed and enabled, and had no problems at all. 

Lastly, I just want to restate my problem/question, about the lag/ voices unsynced, if anyone is experiencing the same thing. Thanks again to SKIDROW and extremezone, keep up the good work, I'm looking forward to Assassin's Creed- Brotherhood! "

,TheFreezy,2010-11-23T12:12Z,"WTH the trackers gave up? Why did everyone stop leeching, i have a shitty connection and i have been downloading this game for the past week with a average download speed of 13 KB/s and now when i get to 99.4% downloaded, the seeders disappear.. -.- can someone please copy&paste the trackers list? i will re-add them to see if that brings any changes :/"
,shokkiee,2010-11-23T14:33Z,"Otherwise it works great, but the game shuts down by itself after I've played it for an hour or three. Dunno if it's because of the game or my shitty-ass CPU, but it can be frustrating.

Other than that it works perfectly and is an awesome game, a must-have. The installation was no hassle either.

Thanks extremezone."

,ProtusMose,2010-11-28T03:23Z,Same problem as nok6700. Copied the Skidrow folder contents. Running the game itself wants an activation key. Running the Skidrow file brings up an 80s arcade Skidrow screen saying press Space to start and pressing space exits. Trying to download the skidrow crack only to see if that fixes.

,dmfarley,2010-11-30T07:13Z,"Ok guys, listen up: You do not need a key code. You probably made the same mistake I did by copying the SKIDROW file and placing it, but what you need to do is to open SKIDROW and copy the two files there and place those. when you do the game will bypass the login and everything and just run"

,beef682,2010-12-01T20:40Z,"works great, follow instructions and it will run fine.

To fix the little freez bug when you first bring divinci your hidden blade, to equip it hit 2 not the weopon wheel.

also most anti virus's will see the crack ""ubiorbitapi_r2.dll"" as a virus, my a/v (esetnod32) auto quarentines and has no option to restore and remove from scanning so I added it to the global ignore list in my options under exclusions, that worked great.

,jdog900000,2010-12-14T06:28Z,for anyone having issues im not spending the time writing out step by step by hopefully u'll get the gist of it. you have to mount the game with power iso or another virtual drive program and install it by running setup .exe after its done go back to where you mounted the iso file like the E: of F: or G: and go into the rive and you should see the skidrow folder and use whatever is in the folder

You will then see all of the game files along with a SKIDROW folder. The crack is in there.  It's not in the original download folder, it is already on the ISO, so you need to explore the mounted ISO to find it.  Hope this helps. :)"

The download took a while but to all the noobs out there complying about download speeds, go to Portforward.com and learn how to open your router. Or do like I do and plug directly into the modem. I will seed and top speed for as long as I can (12/21/2010). 
Download, mount, go to my computer, right-click mounted game iso (use PowerIso for this),open in new window, read the how to notepad file, install, copy crack and play. This game works perfect for me. 
Running windows 7 Ultimate x64. 
Note: I tried to install the game folders on the x64 programs folder. Didn't work so well. If you install the game on x86 program folders, the instructions listed in the notepad file work perfect.

I unplugged from the internet, ran the game then set my firewall to block the program from connecting from the internet. Once again, game works perfect.
 Wish there was more killing. First 30 mins of the game is learning how to move and meeting new fuckers like your typical GARPG (GayAssRolePlayingGame) Dragon age origin and shit.
Graphics are nice. Accents are a bit racist, I mean why do they speak english in Italy? Subtitles are funny though.

I have been doing this for years and have never had a problem up until now. I have never had an issue with a virus in a skidrow crack before until now.

I have a paid Malwarebytes that found a trojan.
\ubiorbitapi_r2.dll

Now I know that there are such things as false negatives but this virus tried to communicate out when I wasn't even running the game. That my friends is not a false positive as I am a computer tech who knows a thing or two about how viruses work. 

I have uninstalled and ran a scan even after a cleanup and found the trojan once again.

I would think twice on this one. If I am wrong in saying that its a virus then someone explain what its doing communicating out?"

,rwnath,2011-01-16T14:56Z,"Microsoft Security Essentials does not recognize the crack as a threat.

@Millerdis100, turn off Nod32 while you are downloading. Leave Nod32 off until you are able to apply the crack.

@Torrent, very nice work! I highly recommend this download. Except for some missing audio (like sometimes, there's no audio when Ezio is knocking on the door which is really no big deal) it's perfect unlike the other AC2 that I once used.

For those who cannot save their settings, just search for ""Assassin's Creed II Skidrow Crack Fix"" on Google.

This is my question.
I installed everything correctly and whenever i enter the mission where you are suppost to see leanardo he gives me the blade it tells me to switch to the blade then it gets stuck i can still switch weapons and everything but i cant do anything else.
I have herd comments about a pd file or somthing about updating it where is that file or am i doing somthing wrong and all you idiots out there 

mount. install. open the update folder run that.
go to the skidrow folder and copy the DDL file.
go to c:/program files/ubisoft/launcher if im not mistaken and paste the files or drop them into that folder there ya go then play assassins creed 2 and dont give me any error bullshit because if you did it right you wouldn't have that problem and in the readme it sacrificially says you need permanent internet Conn to run this game..."

As matter of fact, the torrent you've used probably comes from someone called 'helix' who's used the SKIDROW tag in his torrent name -- however, the setup file is malware, and various content in the cabinet file are password protected... rendering it useless. 

The error you're getting is the same everyone else will get who uses that torrent. 

NOTE: the dll crack supplied with this is perfectly legit (so to speak); almost all AV software will tag it as malicious though because its a modified dll.

,OSkully,2011-03-03T17:46Z,"if you are having a problem with installing such as when try to play the game it asks for a serial key i have found the solution with this torrent only....open the iso file with power iso, go into SKIDROW folder copy the 2nd file it should be dll or something like that and paste it into your program files/ubisoft/gamelauncher folder copy and replace the original and then start up the game and it will go right into the game, hope this helps great torrent btw!!"
,OSkully,2011-03-03T17:48Z,"found the solution if youve been having a problem with it asking fora  serial key.....if you have this problem its an easy fix and requires no other downloading, just open the AC2 iso file with power iso or whatever, open skidrow folder, copy the dll file or whatever it is. paste it into your program files/ubisoft/gamelauncher folder....copy and replace the existing folder, start up assassins creed II like your normally would and instead of getting the serial key box it will go right into the game, hope this helped cause i got sick of looking for a keygen after about 3 hrs lol so enjoy great torrent btw"

,Banzay27,2011-06-22T16:14Z,"Torrent seems fine. Downloaded, installed, finished the game. All fine except the game randomly crashes during active moments (I once let it passively sit where it is for hours while I was away, just to let the money fill up at the villa chest and the game didn't crash).
It would usually crash about an hour after running the game, at least. No error message. I just loaded the game back up. A minor inconvenience and the game does auto-save often and loads relatively fast, even less time wasted if you use a no-intro solution.

Props to extremezone, he dun'it again."

your computer or laptop overheating
you need 1.6 GHz processer and must work hard
he must have somewhere to store heat and with laptops is it difficult enough,
mostly is the problem dust.
go into an electronics store and buy an Air Duster.
or go to a specialist, who will open your laptop and will clean your laptop, it will cost you more than the Air Duster.
Never try to open your laptop if you have never done."

 these locations and overwrite. 32 bit is for both XP, Vista

Have same issue as pcajkovski, tried taking ownership of the Ubisoft folder, but with no result and, since I can't copy the crack to my computer, I can't take over the cracked .dll file. Also tried taking ownership of the file alone in the Ubi folder, but didn't help too. Tried almost every damn thing I could think of, including messing with Everybody's permissions to use the folder and downloading the crack alone. Still nothing. Tried renaming in the archive I got too, but not a single fuck was given by my Win7. Any tips?"
,Carneades,2012-04-18T22:31Z,"Ok, nvm, got it. Seems that to change properties you don't have only to close and open the Properties window, but also reboot the computer, or so it seems. Anyways, reboot after changing the Ubi folder ownership worked for me."

,BioHazard34,2012-04-29T17:25Z,"For those who can't find the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder after installation :

It's because you already installed an Ubisoft Game Launcher before and you need to uninstall it from your system.

Go to ""Control Panel/Uninstall a Program"" and search for ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" and delete it.
Uninstall the game also, reboot (you never know) and re-install the game.

Then :

-Run the v1.01 update exe from UPDATE folder on the DVD or let the game auto update by itself.
-Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to the Ubisoft Game Launcher and overwrite."
