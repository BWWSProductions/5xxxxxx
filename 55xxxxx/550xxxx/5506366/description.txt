Musical. By Ellen Gould. Original Songs by Ellen Gould and Holly Gewandter. Winner of TWO Emmy Awards

A joyous celebration of family, tradition and identity, Bubbe Meises, Bubbe Stories is the story of a granddaughter's passionate journey through time and memory to recall her grandmothers' anecdotes as a way to understand her own life. One grandmother, Bubbe Gittie, passes down her social consciousness to her granddaughter. The other grandmother, Annie is a free-spirited and passionate woman who urges her granddaughter to grab on to every morsel life has to offer. These Bubbe Meises - a noun of Yiddish derivation meaning old wives' tales, fantastical stories or superstitions - are filled with wisdom and just the right mix of humor and sentiment to create an emotional bridge linking her to her past. The granddaughter begins her journey enveloped in loneliness, but as she moves through her grandmothers' rich and poignant life experiences, she begins to understand that they comprise her own heritage. This connection with her roots gives her the strength to embrace the present. The show's 10 songs included the title song and others such as You're Dancing Inside Me; The Bridge Song (The Bubbe Rag); Chocolate Covered Cherries and Take More Out of Life. Universally appealing, this musical combines the emotional resonance, entertaining storytelling and age-old cross-cultural wisdom that will enrich and delight a wide audience.
