This is for people whom already have the FIRST installation disc for Visual Studio 2010.

First installation disc for Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate is available here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5494777/

First installation disc for Visual Studio 2010 Professional is available here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5494125/

These are the remaining stuff to complete your Visual Studio 2010.

 .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (x86 and x64)
 .NET Framework 4 Full (x86 and x64)
 Report Viewer 2010 Redistributable (x86)
 VC++ 2010 Redist Package (x86, x64, and ia64)
 Visual Studio 2010 FSharp 2.0 Runtime (x86)
 Visual Studio 2010 Integrated Shell (x86)
 Visual Studio 2010 Isolated Shell (x86)
 Visual Studio 2010 Remote Debugger (x86)
 Visual Studio 2010 Remote Debugger (x64)
 Visual Studio 2010 SDK (x86)
 Visual Studio 2010 Tools for the Office System 4.0 Runtime (x86)
 Visual Studio 2010 Tools for the Office System 4.0 Runtime (x64)
 Visual Studio Agents 2010 (x86) - DVD
 Visual Studio Team Explorer 2010 (x86) - DVD
 Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2010 (x86 and x64) - DVD
 Pex 2010 (x86 and x64)

I'm not sure if any of the above are available outside MSDN,
 but there are definitely some of these which are MSDN only.

In Visual Studio 2010, MSDN Library is replaced with the new Help System which is installed as a part of the Visual Studio 2010 installation.
Help Library Manager application is used to install Help Content books covering selected topics.

If you have Visual Studio 2010 Professional, you now have everything complete.

If you have Visual Studio 2010 Premium, you are still short of:

 Visual Studio Test Professional 2010 (x86) - DVD

If you have Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, you are still short of:

 Visual Studio Team Explorer Everywhere 2010 (x86 and x64) - DVD
 Visual Studio Test Professional 2010 (x86) - DVD

I had no access/was unable to obtain the remaining ISO images for Premium and Ultimate.

No serial key or activation required,
 if any do require serial key or activation, please inform me.

All files are untouched from MSDN Retail Subscription Download.

Files are individually archived, each archive only has one file,
 so you could download only the ones you want/need.
Files are archived in 7z, LZMA2 compression.
For WinRAR or 7-Zip, you will need at least WinRAR 3.91, 7-Zip 9.04 to extract.

I have very slow Internet upload speed, so please be patient.
Please help continue seeding, cause I don't know how long and can keep this up by my own.
