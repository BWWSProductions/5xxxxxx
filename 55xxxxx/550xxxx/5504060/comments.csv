Also the super big file ofr 1.6GB called en_visual_studio_team_explorer_2010_x86_dvd_509698 NO need to be downloaded unless you actually need the team server installed. If you are like me coding locally in your computer and dont have others incorporating remotely, you dont need this.

,DJuse,2010-04-25T04:40Z,"and also en_visual_studio_team_foundation_server_2010_x86_x64_dvd_509406 Unless you actually gonna use it, dont waste your time!"
,corruptedSoul,2010-04-30T06:47Z,"Thank you, and of course, we are providing this for ppl who do need them.

I am guessing only ppl who know what are these for and do need them will actually download them."
,corruptedSoul,2010-04-30T07:02Z,"hmm, it is true that some components have the option to be downloaded after you install the first disc.

I am guessing there will be ppl like me, where we don have all-the-time-unlimited Internet on every computer we have. Having an offline installer is convenient.

I guess some of these stuff is more of a 'want' then a 'need'. Something like porn, most ppl don't actually need it, but most ppl have it.

Either way, for those whom have finish downloaded, enjoy and thank you for seeding.

I may release the update for Pex, which is apparently MSDN only, only the education version is available to public. If I do I will post the link down here."
,ToneZone,2010-05-11T06:10Z,Thank you guyz!
,TorrentLover70,2010-05-27T04:48Z,"I try to open the downloaded files with 7-Zip, but I got error message: unsupported compression method. This error occurs for every file. Does anyone have any ideas ??
Thanks."
,TorrentLover70,2010-05-27T05:04Z,Problem resolved. Download the latest 7-Zip and everything seems to be OK.  Thank you.

,Osho34,2010-06-15T22:53Z,"Could you upload Visualization and Modeling Featured Pack?
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ff655021.aspx
It is only available to MSDN subscribers. "
,corruptedSoul,2010-06-18T13:34Z,"We are very sorry to disappoint, but we have no access/unable to obtain the Visualization and Modeling Featured Pack.

I guess it is up to other teams to release that."
