"SECRETARY'S DAY"

Andy (Ed Helms) pulls out all the stops to give Erin a 
memorable Secretary's Day. Michael (Golden Globe 
winner Steve Carell) reluctantly takes Erin out to 
lunch and lets slip about Andy's relationship with 
Angela. Meanwhile, Oscar (Oscar Nunez) circulates a 
viral video he created that compares Kevin's (Brian 
Baumgartner) voice to Sesame Street's Cookie Monster.

Enjoy :)
