Nero is the founder and song writer for the harsh-electronic metal project Psyclon Nine.

Atrum Artifex is a noise project inspired by his dreams, nightmares and night terrors (which are often prophetic). It is also meant to be a fundamental tool in the ritual of Astral projection.

A full length album is in the works but there are no current plans for release. Until then all tracks will be available for free download on the Atrum Artifex myspace.
