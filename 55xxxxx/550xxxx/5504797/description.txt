Hello, salut, servus!

Here's the way too late pl. for april.

I'll try to make it short this time...

Had around half a thousand tracks to listen to & I tried to cut it down to 50.
I was stuck around 90 tracks later and I could finally narrow it down to 60.

Couldn't take less tracks, otherwise this playlist would have felt kinda uncomplete.
And I honestly never spent so much time on a playlist like this one.

It took countless hours of track- listenings/addings/deletes & re-addings, 
until I was satisfied with the end result. It sounds a bit different than march,
but that kinda changes every month anyway :]

Thanks go out again to my friend james/fen (see you soon in hedgewars ;)) for another great cover!

Now up to some good news,

A music sideproject between samycze and me is about to start soon.
In short terms, a great collaboration with some really fine selections.
I'll let you know, once I got more news about it ;)

Like always, if you really like some of those tracks/artists here, 
please don't forget to support them in whatever way you can.

PS: Hint --> (next month = playlist anniversary)
I'll see with what I can come up there...

*bla bla bla*
