Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



Music, and particularly jazz, knows no borders, and this documentary follows the eminent trumpet great Dizzy Gillespie during a musical tour of Cuba, during which he gets to meet with Fidel Castro and has fun with local dancers and musicians. In concert footage, the balloon-cheeked musician plays A Night in Tunisia and Cubana Bop, among other favorites. In interviews, the musician speaks about his past and the musical compositions which have inspired him.
