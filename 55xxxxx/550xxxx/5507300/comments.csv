,jon4fun,2010-04-22T07:06Z,"@ ALL - PLEASE SEED!!!!

If we don't SEED 'Talk Shows Pack' then it might go away.
It is so small (>100MB for 3 shows) PLEASE seed it past 1:1 ratio. Seed it for as long as possible.

Jon "
,jon4fun,2010-04-22T07:15Z,"@20-40, Please keep doing the 'Talk Shows Pack'. I know the seeding can get very low very quickly but I have become addicted to it now. 

I kow it takes a bit of encoding time on your end and I appreciate that.
I beg you to keep it up and I'll keep asking people to seed it. If they just did a week and 1:1 per day that is still less than 500MB.

Hopefully people will finally figure out that seeding it, >100MB file, past 1:1 ratio is really very little for most 1st world users, no matter what type of plan they are on.

I'll keep seeding as long as I can.

Thank you.
Jon"
