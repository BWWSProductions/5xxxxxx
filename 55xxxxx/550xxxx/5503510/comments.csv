,dual36,2010-04-21T02:22Z," Ok guys i need help, ive  exactly as the crack said. When i load the game it gets past the rockstar logo, gets to the main menu, when i choose either game it starts to load, then says unable to find downloaded content, do you want to start a new game, then it tries to load says load unsucessfull then crashes to desktop. Can anyone help me with this issue"
,MikeHaggarKJ,2010-04-21T02:31Z,If any cracking group reads this: I'd strongly appreciate if you crack Dark Void Zero. and thanks for all the good you do us. Thank you!
,MikeHaggarKJ,2010-04-21T11:12Z,@dual36 you need to follow all the instructions in the readme.txt very precisely. You probably forgot to move the contents of the EFLC folder.
