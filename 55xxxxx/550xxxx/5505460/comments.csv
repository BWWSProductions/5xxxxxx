wth"
,sybex2010,2010-04-22T21:20Z,"I guess I'll be the first to comment.  You run the Nero-8.3.2.1_all_update and after that it'll just install the whole Nero Suite for you:

Nero StartSmart
NeroBurningRom
NeroVision
NeroBackItUp
NeroCoverDesigner
NeroWaveEditor
NeroSoundTrax
NeroShowTime
NeroMediaHome
NeroRecode
NeroPhotoSnap
NeroBurnRights
NeroImageDrive
NeroCDDVDSpeed
NeroDriveSpeed
NeroInfoTool
NeroRescueAgent
NeroBurn
NeroMediaStreaming
NeroCopyGadget
NeroToolbar

Doesn't ask for a serial or let you choose what you want just installs the whole damn thing.  Didn't even tell me to restart my computer.  If I run into any problems I will post here."
,hannibal0,2010-04-22T23:46Z,So is this activated already?
,sybex2010,2010-04-25T20:48Z,Yes it is activated.  And so far I have not had any problems.

,wunderwummun,2010-05-20T18:50Z,only good for cd? No dvd capability? strange.
,LittleMrJ,2010-05-21T17:29Z,"Great copy, great program... But do NOT update this version, it will be flagged for non-licensened usage, & rendered usless, forcing you to delete & reinstall... You wont need updates anyway, it's fine as-is."
,bidib,2010-05-21T20:38Z,CAN I USE THIS ON WINDOWS 7
,ramiro10911091,2010-05-21T22:47Z,"este torrent lamentablemente contiene troyano

,sn3owy,2010-05-25T00:46Z,"i don't usually  comment, but this works fine, comes up that its trial but its full version on start. i'm pretty thick when it comes to things like this, so the rest of you should have no problems. have tried newer versions that are harder to set up, but this does all you need. cheers"
,pitbullzombie,2010-05-26T02:15Z,"Great download fast and no problems, clean no virus and works perfect! Great Download!!"
,babydoll88,2010-05-27T15:22Z,what does the other exe file do? sorry if I sound like an idiot but I am not very good at this :)
,stevemcc,2010-06-09T23:18Z,"This is a easy download.BUT if u want to burn dvds this version(for some reason) doesnt have it enabled...so i deleted and......

I downloaded ""nero 7 with keygen"" of this site and it encodes and burns dvds great..simple download as well."
,stevemcc,2010-06-09T23:28Z,"This version does not encode and burn dvds.
for some reason that function is disabled.I deleted and .....

Download nero 7+keygen instead (on this site)that does have a dvd encoder and burns.

Both are easy to download and install."
,stevemcc,2010-06-09T23:29Z,sorry double post
,goffyoflegend,2010-06-09T23:46Z,"""I might be the first one with a problem, after Nero-8.3.2.1_all_update is finished installing i only see a shortcut on my desktop (Nero burning ROM)

@stevemcc: it DOES write DVD's"
,KonFry,2010-06-25T18:03Z,"I see there are many pages of comments so I'm not going to sift through them all to see if this has been addressed, my apologies if it has but AntiVir said Nero8-3.2.1_all_update.exe was infected with TR/Crypt.ULPM.Gen Trojen. Just thought I'd pass on this information...."
,kalle114,2010-06-27T17:02Z,Works perfect besides that it can't write DVD's.

Just ran the ""Nero-8.3.2.1_all_update"" it installed within a few minutes and now I have everything. no cracks or key-gens required, maybe the best program I've ever swindled through TPB. Just finished burning a disk now. thx :)"
,mrhozer,2010-11-08T21:01Z,Is it a trial version? I'm trying to use Nero Vision to create a Video DVD from an AVI file... should be simple but it's asking for activation. I'm pretty sure if I skip the activation process then it will work as a trial and just expire in a few days. Has anyone found a permanent fix?
,shiranavs,2010-11-15T07:34Z,"is this work in 64bit OS ??? plz tell me,,,,,,"
,DeeMonk81,2010-12-03T11:00Z,Respect.Never had any problems with ur torrents.Keep up the good job with PS2 :P

,ball_ed,2010-12-18T07:17Z,"Thanks bro, this works fine on Windows 7 64bit, DVD's burn and everything. Installed Nero-8.3.2.1_all_update, haven't opened the other file. Sweet....:)"
,ball_ed,2010-12-18T08:45Z,Not sure if we can 'check for updates'? Anybody know whether this is wise or not?? Cheers

,silverx2,2011-06-05T20:06Z,"has virus, waste of time."
,rrpostal,2011-06-07T05:51Z,"Are the paranoid commentors getting more annoying than ever? I never mind a question about how things work. Heck, I ask question sometimes. But it seems more and more people seem to assume they no what the hell they are doing, say stupid things abut stuff condemning the uploads, and leave thinking they had added something important. Every single torrent has a handful of chicken littles screaming about the sky falling."
,yukabrother,2011-06-12T23:33Z,"ALL WORKS JUST FINE, JUST MAKE SURE TO DISCONNECT FROM THE ETHERNET BEFORE INSTALLATION !!!!"

,martink61,2011-07-09T16:11Z,"CHICKEN LITTLE....... That was a funny comment mate... Curious though, have you managed to get it working. I had another copy of version8 which allowed me to register successfully once, and about a month later, having been told it would only ask the one time to register, It asked me again only ... Well you can guess the rest. My sky really did fall down...  Gonna buy the Buggy thing if this one doesnt work.. ;-) no.. really 8-)"
