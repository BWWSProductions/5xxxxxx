Checking SS
     Timestamp of Authoring: 2010/02/04 00:00:00
     Timestamp of Mastering: 2010/04/02 05:19:02
     SS Version: 1

Caution: This SS contains a value (angle 359) that will cause older versions
of iXtreme to return a detectable bad response! Make sure your drive is flashed
with iXtreme version 1.4 or newer. Alternatively, you may enable the option to
adjust angle 359 for compatibility with iXtreme < v1.4

     SS CRC = 8ED076DB (RawSS = D0867215)
     SS Media ID: B625BF9BC5EFC13CF1BEA52C-5ECF6978 (matches game)
SS looks valid

Checking DMI
     Timestamp of Authoring: 2010/02/04 00:00:00 (matches SS)
     DMI CRC = 82FE10B1
     DMI Media ID: B625BF9BC5EFC13CF1BEA52C-5ECF6978 (matches game)
DMI looks valid

Checking PFI
     PFI CRC = 05C6C409
PFI matches known data (4th wave - requires iXtreme v1.51 [Hitachi only],
v1.6 [using activation disc], v1.61 or later)

Video partition found
     Video CRC = E2FA3A26 (V0 = E0363F4E, V1 = EAE76B94)
Video partition does not match known data (could be corrupt or a new wave not
seen before)

Stealth status is uncertain
