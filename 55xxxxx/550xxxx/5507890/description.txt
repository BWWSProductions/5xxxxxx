"The Predator in the Pool"

When human remains are discovered in the belly of a 
shark, Brennan and Booth are brought in to identify 
the missing person. Evidence suggesting the victim 
had been the prey of several fish directs the 
team's investigation to The Aquarium of the 
Atlantic, where a guest lecturer and notorious 
self-help guru preaching the healing power of the 
ocean has gone missing. Meanwhile, both Brennan and 
Booth navigate their own relationship when a marine 
biologist (guest star Sofer) shows interest in 
Booth.

Enjoy :)
