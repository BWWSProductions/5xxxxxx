Finally finished!  Hope you enjoy the Next Generation rips!!  Next project that I'm going to tackle is Stargate SG-1.  I noticed that high quality rips with subs are hard to come by.  If you are a Stargate fan and are looking for high quality rips, check back soon.  Season 1 should be up hopefully sometime next week."
,Fuxsylady,2010-04-22T17:15Z,"Ah so it is complete, thank you so much for this; the quality rocks! Im not a fan of the other Trek shows (only Next Gen & Original) but perhaps Ill give DS9 a shot"
,metrOjedi,2010-05-07T05:13Z,"@Fuxsylady, DS9 is really good, just give it a chance.  I especially liked the addition of Worf.

These however are no improved then any other TNG release.  Sorry to bust your bubble.  Just watch the credits come on screen, all the jagged rebuilding of pixels is obvious.  
I doubt these came from DVD, more like the small avi that are available and then re-ripped.
If they were DVD, then a pretty poor attempt at ripping.
They look far better on 56.com even.
However, I appreciate your effort, from a hardcore TNG fan."

These did indeed come from dvd at their full resolution.  And are much higher quality than the other torrents available.  If there were indeed higher quality rips out there, I wouldn't have spent all the required time ripping these from the dvds.   Most of the other rips out there are 350mb large at best and don't even include 5.1 surround sound.  Nor are they ripped using the higher quality h264 codec with the high profile settings I was able to attain with the i7 processor.  As far as the credits go, I think you are confusing quality with framerate.  The jagged look you refer to is a problem you can't avoid when encoding mixed framerate dvds.  ""Stuttery"" would be a better adjective to use.  Star Trek Next Generation episodes were filmed at two different framerates...29.97 and 23.978.  The closing credits and a few other special effect shots were shot at a different framerate than the rest of the show.  The only way to encode these without loss is to encode at a variable framerate.  However, this causes problems with many video streamers such as apple-tv, ps3mediaserver, etc.  So you are left with two choices...to force 23.97 or 29.97.  I experimented with both and realized that 23.97 was the best bet.  Nearly none of the scenes suffer at this rate.  Some encoders chose 23.97.  You will see the same effect with the credits.  Other encoders (other torrents) chose 29.97...yes the end credits look fine, but any shots where the camera pans look very ""studdery"".  I figured sacrificing a couple scenes such as the closing credits to benefit the majority of the scenes was the right way to go.  I wouldn't have spent my time ripping one of my favorite shows and posting them for others unless I thought the quality was superior to other torrents out there.  I think most other people would agree.  However, you are certainly entitled to your opinion."
,Kingdazza,2010-08-12T21:29Z,Hey man great job on the rips. Just one question what do you use to play these on a PS3?
[V],meech,2010-08-13T01:00Z,"Kingdazza:
Thanks.  I use a free program called PS3mediaserver.  Google it and give it a try.  It's an excellent program that is able to stream just about any type of video file to your ps3.  It even supports subtitles. You do need a decently powered p.c., and I would suggest a wired connection from your router to the p.c. as well as from your router to your ps3."
,Danbouges,2010-08-14T10:11Z,"Man this is awesome!!! You are the only one supplying these torrents with tremendous audio/video quality!! Before this, I enjoyed the entire freaking series of SSg1 because of you! I'm not sure why anyone would complain about these files or say they aren't better than others. I even saw one guy going on a tyrade to the effect: ""If i wanted Full quality dvd rips, i'd buy the dvd, if i want to watch vids on my computer, i want compressed files of a ""reasonable size"" this to me is crazy. I'd die to have files of my favorite shows THAT ACTUALLY HAVE 5.1 SURROUND!  Some people actually want good quality dvdrips, and not everyone has enough money to buy the boxsets. All of your rips are obviously much higher quality than the rest. Everyone just look at the audio/video specs if you disagree. If you want crappy 150 mb tv rips without surround sound, I suggest getting a new computer. To the guy that says ""buy the dvds"" if you can afford all those dvd's, why can't you afford a computer that can handle a reasonable quality file?? Thanks alot man, top freaking notch. Best quality of anything."

[V],meech,2010-11-02T14:06Z,"To view some of my other torrents, goto my piratebay page http://thepiratebay.org/user/meech

Some of my other sci-fi torrents include high quality complete series of: Star Trek DS-9, Stargate SG-1, Farscape, and Space Above and Beyond.

Star Trek Voyager is currently being ripped.  The first season should be up soon."
,Jericho7600,2011-12-14T17:38Z,I approve this torrent and all other uploads of user *meech*. Outstanding quality and everything works perfectly. Thank you man!
,raj_rios,2011-12-22T01:38Z,"Thank you Meech, I downloaded your SG-1 rip a long while back and the entire time I was sad that you hadn't done the next generation, because the quality was fantastic, and english subs were great.  Looks like I get my wish after all.  Any prospect of us getting Finnish subtitles for these though?"
,Kumcats2,2012-02-12T10:22Z,"Excellent quality. Great torrent! Thnx. a/10 v/10.
Cheers! Kumcats."
,scrunter,2012-03-01T14:03Z,Thanks for including surround sound in your rips. Much appreciated!!!
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-09T22:22Z,"Excellent rips!
I'm downloading all 7 seasons at the same time. My uploads are way, way higher than my downloads.
People, quit being selfish and put your upload rate to 0 and don't limit your bandwidth.
You're not speeding up your downloads, all you're doing is destroying these quality torrents."
,shonuffx,2012-05-12T21:17Z,Appreciate the upload! I'm wondering why a good quality Star Trek upload takes so long to download...
