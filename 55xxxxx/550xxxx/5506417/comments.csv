,MissManna,2010-08-31T22:30Z,"There's written ""Compatable with the PS3, Xbox 360 and Seagate Free Agent Theater+"" so does it work for PC too? Already downloading it, so hope that works.
Btw, it's my favorite movie of all the time!"
,MissManna,2010-09-01T21:59Z,"Great quality, works good ! Thanks ! :) And love that you have added subtitles ;) !"
,dylanthomas6,2010-10-18T13:16Z,"Audio that refuses to play unless one has Quicktime is not of any interest to me, and is a waste of my download limit. Fuck Steve Jobs, he is as big a wanker as Bill 'The Evil One' Gates. If it won't play in Matroska or DivX, I am not interested. Quicktime is a Virus, just like Windows."
,titsNshit,2010-11-03T01:23Z,hey dylan can you shut the fuck up for a second?
,Dash-2,2010-11-26T23:47Z,"Audio/Video is great, but this torrent is being followed by Paramount/BayTSP. I got a Notice of Copyright Infringement today."

,007Michael4115,2011-04-02T03:38Z,Great Movie. 
,pteradactyle,2011-05-11T04:08Z,dont worry your isp can do shit
,veritas01,2012-01-10T06:45Z,@ pteradactyle - That's quite wrong. I've worked for a large ISP for years (will not say names) and I can't tell you how many times I've had to cut someones internet off because they broke our three strike rule. Highly recommend getting an IP anonymizer or using a VPN so that we can't monitor your traffic.
