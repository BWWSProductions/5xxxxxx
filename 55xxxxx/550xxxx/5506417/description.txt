Storyline:

The plan was flawless, the job executed perfectly and the escape clean. The only threat mastermind thief Charlie Croker never saw coming was from a member of his own crew.
After pulling off an amazing gold bullion heist from a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy, Charlie
and his gang â€” inside man Steve, computer genius Lyle, wheelman Handsome Rob, explosives expert Left-Ear and veteran safecracker Bridger â€”
can't believe it when one of them turns out to be a double-crosser.
Now, with the help of Stella, a beautiful nerves-of-steel safecracker, they plan to re-steal the gold by tapping into Los Angeles' traffic control system,
manipulating signals and creating the biggest traffic jam in L.A. history.
