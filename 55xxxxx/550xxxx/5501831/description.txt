How do you look back on 5 decades of Eurovision?  With a LAUGH of course, now join Sir Terry Wogan of the BBC for a great fun look back at where we have been before you find out this May where we are going.... Clasic clips of many, many household names who got there start on Eurovision, the Worlds FIRST and ONLY International Talent Show.

Confused... No matter, Eurovision is best served confused with loads of Beer and Wine and things on sticks....  Watch it sober at your own risk!

Enjoy this classic re seed.
