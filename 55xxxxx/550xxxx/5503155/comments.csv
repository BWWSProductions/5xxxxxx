,Seansexyundies,2010-04-19T06:32Z,"Everything seems to be in good working order, thanks.
Also nice to see that it isn't in patch files like things usually are 3 hours after they originally air."

,phosphor,2010-04-19T14:42Z,For the past 5 eps. I still cannot keep track of anyone besides Lucky. I had high hopes that this was on par with Band of Brothers but I just cannot get into it. I will keep trying - thanks for the upload!

,skiba_,2010-04-19T15:19Z,"Yeah, It's been kinda of dissapointing for me so far. Maybe cus BoB set the bar so high...I bet there would have been more exiting vet stories out there like dog fights, naval battels. The series isn't bad but its not that good either.  There was even one whole episode wasted on some love story..."
,Mokoko34,2010-04-19T21:01Z,"I have to agree that, while the show is not bad, it hasn't grabbed me as much as BoB. I don't think it was necessarily because it set the bar so high but because it followed the exact same group of men and they we're always together. You felt really bad when something happened to one of them since you had seen them form close bonds from boot camp to Normandy to Germany.  This show just feels like it's all over the place and character development is a little lacking. 
I was hoping to see some of the major battles like Tarawa where the Marines learned many valuable lessons about amphibious warfare. 
Not a bad show but not as good as I expected. Maybe a show about Navy/Marine pilots of sailors could've delivered the same sense of bonding that BoB did. Two shows I would be really interested in would be the exploits and ordeals of the crew of the U.S.S. Houston in the Pacific or of a German or Russian tank crew. "

,Mokoko34,2010-04-20T02:48Z,@nlSpiller: What media player are you using? VLC Media Player works wonders for all media files.

,nlSpiller,2010-04-20T20:42Z,"@Mokoko34
Tried VLC and Quicktime with addon. Works fine on win7, i guess the file just downloaded corrupt or something. Not the uploader's fault."
,the_one_one,2010-04-25T01:55Z,Seeeeed please.  Not a single seeder at this time.
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-05-06T15:23Z,"How do I play this file.
