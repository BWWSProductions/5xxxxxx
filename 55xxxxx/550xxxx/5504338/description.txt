In the far northeastern corner of the United States lies a vast primeval back-country known as the North Maine Woods. This breathtaking wilderness constitutes the single largest swath of unprotected forest north of the Mississippi -- and serves as the setting for a century-old way of life that demands the utmost from men and machines who return year after year to reap nature's bounty.

Meet the men of Pelletier Inc., a family with timber in its blood for three generations. Each day, seven brothers and their sons lead their crews deep into the Maine wilderness to claw out a living. They cut roads through the mud and snow, harvest timber with fearsome machines and drag monstrous bundles of wood to waiting trucks which hurtle down unpaved, ice-covered logging routes at breakneck speeds to mills throughout the U.S. and Canada. It's a brutal and dangerous existence in which a twist of fate, one error in judgment, can yield horrific consequences: mangled equipment, injury, and even death.
