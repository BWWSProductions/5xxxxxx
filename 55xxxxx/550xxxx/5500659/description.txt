Miles Davis â€“ Blue Moods (1955)

@320 kbps







Blue Moods brings together Miles Davis with Charles Mingus, accompanied by Elvin Jones on drums. The arrangement of "Alone Together" was by Charles Mingus, while the other tracks were arranged by Teddy Charles.

It was released on Mingus's own Debut Records label. According to the original sleeve notes, the relatively short playing time of the album was because "the recording was cut at 160 lines per inch (instead of the usual 210 to 260 lines per square inch) making the grooves wider and deeper and allowing for more area between the grooves for bass frequencies [â€¦] and was deemed necessary to reproduce the extended bass range and give the listener more quality to that of high fidelity tape recording.


This is an LP of mood pieces-contemplative and subtle. People have complained that the whole LP is only 27 minutes long and my reply is 'so what?'. The Beatles Abbey Road was 28 minutes long in is entirety and I don't hear anyone complaining that it wasn't long enough.
