        The awakening of unstoppable Majin Buu!

        The forces  of good  and evil  have converged  upon the planet
        Earth, and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance!  The
        evil wizard Babidi has traveled  across the galaxy on a  quest
        for revenge, hoping to fulfill his father's thwarted dreams of
        universal domination. Meanwhile, the  Supreme Kai has come  to
        enlist  the aid  of the  Z-Fighters in  an effort  to prevent
        Babidi from completing  his plans and  awakening a monster  of
        unimaginable terror: Majin Buu!

        Vegeta, consumed by pride, has forced Goku into a deadly fight
        to the  finish! The  most incredible  battle of  the two Super
        Saiyans ensues. Can Goku convince his rival to battle the evil
        wizard Babidi instead?

        As Goku and  the Z-Fighters descend  into Babidi's lair,  they
        are confronted by an army of powerful minions led by the Demon
        King Dabura himself! Can  our heroes resist the  wizard's dark
        magic  and  battle their  way  through this  host  of villains
        before time runs out? With each passing second, more energy is
        gathered for the sleeping  Majin Buu. Should this  creature of
        pure  evil  be  awakened,  all life  -  everywhere  -  will be
        extinguished!

        Season 8, Episode 2: King of the Demons

        The present  Z Fighters,  Supreme Kai  and Kibito  think their
        foes  dont know  they are  there, but  they would  be wrong.
        Dabura launches a surprise attack  taking Kibito so off guard
        that he  is instantly  killed. He  then spits  on Krillin  and
        Piccolo, which practically  leaves them stone  statues. Dabura
        soon retreats into the ship  like Babibi and Pui Pui,  but the
        door remains open.  Goku, Gohan, Vegeta  and Supreme Kai  know
        what they have to do  regardless of how dangerous it is.  But
        what exactly does await them inside Babibis ship? 

     
                                           
                   RIP NOTES
