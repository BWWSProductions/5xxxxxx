***This Program Will Auto-Update - You Should Still Join RuneDev.org!!***
(The bot will start and turn off then open again when it updates...)

If your bot does not start, you can't add scripts, or you get "could not find main class" popup error, you need to go to runedev forums and seek the tutorial for installing JAVA JRE+JDK...

What is Runedev - Powered by RSBot?

RuneDev is the continuation of RSBot after Qauters was threatened a lawsuit by Jagex. RSBot is an open sourced FREE bot for runescape with tons of scripts created and updated often to train every skill in runescape. This bot does not break any copyright laws of Jagex and is 100% safe and legal. Visit the website for development updates and script downloads, Also seek information on setting up your bot on the RuneDev forums. Donate and most of all, bot! The more money we have in donations, the faster we can get the bot updated when Jagex changes the game to stop us. 

**NEWS** Thanks to many donations, the RuneDev team will soon be able to purchase a BCEL Updater that can allow us to update the bot within hours of Runescape updates... The bot will never be down as long as it has again...
