,xtracrossxx,2010-04-18T20:55Z,"here are a few importents points to remember ONLY AND ONLY USE DAEMON TOOLS!!!mount the image then auto play will come,installation will take 90 mins!!!!so watch a movie,go to sleep or talk with your gurl!:P after installation is done apply a crack download from:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg

,Mochok,2010-04-21T12:49Z,"You don't need to open that folder, it's only the autoplay messing with you! You can close that! You just mount the second image and press the okay button and it should continue the installing, and at the end you will need to ""insert"" the disc1 once more!"
,xtracrossxx,2010-04-21T14:53Z,sheeshh sum people dnt know even how to install .ISO games???must be his first time anyways thanx for helping him Mochok!:)

,xtracrossxx,2010-04-22T19:25Z,"@boosool:just apply any proper crack first,then ull need to create a offline games for windows profile to save.they will save in the game automatically after a mission is complete or when u sleep!

this is from a guy in demoniod(darkone87),do what he says and ull be able to save:
I created an offline profile for those that dont know how to:
http://www*4shared*com/file/Gi9FSNh3/XLive.html
1.go to C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft(make sure that view hidden files is on)
2.unrar the xlive and paste it there.
3.enter eflc or any other game that requires gfwl and sign in to the profile."

,xtracrossxx,2010-04-23T17:00Z,"okay dude here are the answers forthe fowllowing!:
1)after you find the folder xlive in your microsoft folder,extract the folder u dwnloaded from 4shared,and replace your original file in the microsoft folder with the one you downloaded!!
2)now once u replace your original folder with the xlive file u downloaded ull never have to do it again !any other game that requires an offline xlive profile (e.g street fighter 4,bioshock 2)will save automatically using that profile itself!:D"

Just wondering if this will work if you bought the game.. ? I mean I've already registered online and everything. So will I still be able to install a pirated copy of this? 

I don't really want to pay $30 for the DLC packs when I already paid $80 for the game >.< That's a load of shit. 

Thanks :P"
