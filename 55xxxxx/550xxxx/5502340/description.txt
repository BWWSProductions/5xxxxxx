Notes
The.Crazies.2010.R5.LiNE.Xvid-STOL3N - this release doesn't exist 
it's a "fake" spam to some small dupe.  

message for Arrow group.
you cannot say we used p2p source for our Tooth Fairy dvdrip on your NFO just because you are a big group.
dvd5 R4 available on p2p is fucked.... there is 4 frames fucked
(pixellation) but our release is right... strange?!?!?!?!, no, nothing strange because we also used a dvd9 supplied from our mx friends.
We always respected you considering a serious group...... we don't want your consideration but we want respect, suppose in silence next time.... don't say lies, and PROOF what you say.
