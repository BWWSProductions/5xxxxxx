,koiwai,2010-08-30T01:42Z,"Good torrent. Nice and clean. 

As for the book itself... as with all books on drawing, illustrations are everything, but these are simply too poor to be taken seriously. 
Having it published is one thing, but when you have ""Complete Guide"" in the title, there is simply no excuse. 

If this mr. Stanyer hasn't done the illustrations himself, he is but an author and is in no position to teach art. 
If he -has- done the illustrations himself, he is just another prime example of how those who can't do, teach. "
