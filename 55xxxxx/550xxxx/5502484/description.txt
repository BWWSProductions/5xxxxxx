Lee Mack, also a star of ITV1's The Sketch Show and Not Going Out, stars in this hilarious six part comedy first heard on BBC Radio 2.

Participating in the manic mix of sketches and stand-up are special musical guests Toyah Willcox, Midge Ure, Suggs, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Tom Robinson and Tony Hadley. Lee is also joined by comedians Noel Brixton, Mick Miller, Milton Jones, Rhod Gilbert, Mike Wilmot and Aussie Trevor Cook.

Ably assisted by long-suffering sidekick Angela McHale and house band leader Steve Brown (Knowing Me, Knowing You's Glenn Ponder), Lee Mack brings you a new show for the 21st century.

Where else can you hear Tony Hadley playing cops and robbers and Suggs amid ghostly goings-on? Just don't ask Midge Ure about Band Aid...
