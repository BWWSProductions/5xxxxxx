Jack Logan's sixth album Buzz Me In features more of his earthy songwriting. Reflective tracks like "I Brake for God," "Worldly Possessions," and "Melancholy Girl" show off his smoother, sweeter side, while rockers like "All Grown Up" sound slightly strained. Logan's more experimental pop dimension comes through on the album's best songs, like the bouncy "Metropolis" and "Glorious World," (which feature bright pianos), the couplet "Your Neck Smells Like Peppermint/C'mon Baby, Let Me Pay Your Rent," and "The Possibilities," a droning, laid-back number that remains accessible thanks to the album's shiny production.
