Once you download this please seed as much as possible while not browsing online. It makes it very hard and frustrating to upload files over 9GB if people wont help keep them going.

For those who seed like a mf'er, i personally thank you for keeping the community going, its you guys who make the difference!"
,rockylichen,2010-05-19T19:32Z,"Heads up, I'm pretty sure this is bogus.
I got a nice happy email from my ISP forwarding an email from activision.

So yeah, it was activision that caught it, not the ISP.
The torrent's bugged."

,1f6aaa,2010-09-12T18:56Z,"@RonnyJ101 You have to install the program named Daemon tools lite,(make sure to download a earlyer version) when you installed it you just have to click on the icon of daemon tools and mount the zip file! there you go!"
,RonnyJ101,2010-10-07T09:35Z,thank you @1f6aaa and someone seed please

,EastLink,2011-02-22T01:56Z,"WARNING:

It appears that Activison is currently tracking people's IPs from this torrent. They will complain to your ISP and you will get an email, warning you of copyright infringement. (comcast just sent me one) They could possibly come after you in one way or another, and yes, they could even sue you if they wanted. Be very careful when you download this, use peerblock or peer guardian so these dickheads don't get your IP. Also, make sure hash checks are enabled (most Torrent clients have it on by default)

I must say, in the many years Ive been downloading torrents, Ive not once come across something like this. They really are cracking down. If they do decide to go after you, you could be sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and they will garnish your wages the rest of your life. Don't be an example."
,tjoranie,2011-04-09T12:31Z,can they sue me if i don't live in america?
,EastLink,2011-04-19T08:10Z,"tjoranie, they could, since copyright laws apply in most countries. However, it would require more effort on their part but certainly possible."
