Dr. Rauni-Leena Luukanen Kilde talks about Iceland, volcanos, war, NATO, propaganda (19th April 2010)

It's a Warning Signal

Volcanic eruption as exercise for world war? Dr. Rauni Kilde, former health minister in Lapland / Finland and a studied medical doctor, speaks on 20 April 2010 about the volcanic eruption in Iceland. The points, which she addresses: The volcanic eruption and the grounding are meant to stir up fear. The earthquake, which caused the volcanic eruption, was artificially created by technologies such as HAARP or EISCAT. By the grounding of airplanes and the manipulation of the media in the whole play, NATO and the European Union knew large military exercises could be driven through, as I had already written in this article over Eyjafjalla. The military exercises could serve as preparation for a war in Iran. The whole event is a large experiment. She also talks about psychic mind control used to manipulate politicians.
