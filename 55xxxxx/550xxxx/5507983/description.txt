"Father Figure" is the U.S. number-one song written and performed by George Michael and released on Epic Records in 1987 as the third single from the album Faith.

"Father Figure" is a sharp and sensual tale of seduction which is more than five minutes long and epitomized the sexual nature of Michael's writing which he had adopted since the latter years of Wham!.

The song was actually supposed to be an uptempo dance track, but whilst checking his mix of the song, Michael turned off the snare track and realized he liked the song better without it.

The video starred Vogue model Tania Coleridge.

Released in 1987, "Father Figure" reached number eleven in the UK singles chart - the first time Michael had failed to reach the top ten in his home country. The song remained a live favourite at Michael's concerts for many years and is also one of his most frequently aired songs on the radio in the UK.

In the U.S., "Father Figure" became George Michael's sixth number one single (counting #1 singles garnered as half of Wham!). "Father Figure" debuted at #49 on January 16, 1988, while "Faith" was still prominent (at #9) in the top tier of the chart. In the subsequent weeks, "Father Figure" was a surefire hit, reaching #1 by its seventh week, February 27, 1988, staying at the top for two weeks. Altogether, the single spent 6 weeks in the Top 10, 9 weeks in the Top 20, and 14 weeks in the Top 40.

Faith is George Michael's first solo album, released in October 1987 via Columbia Records/Epic Records. The album is considered by some to be one of the greatest albums in pop music history, and won several awards including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989. The album was an instant commercial success in the United States, selling more than 1 million copies in its debut, the most copies ever sold in a week by a British pop  artist. To date, the album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, and received diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Faith spawned six top 5 singles that substantially helped it dominate the chart of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
