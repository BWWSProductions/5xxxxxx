,Party Hampster,2010-04-22T21:16Z,It seems really strange there is still no BD rip. What up with that?
,gussers,2010-04-22T22:35Z,"It's only 600MB as it's an MKV format - better quality in a small file size. Thanks, these are always worth downloading."

,BrogzWrath666,2010-04-30T09:22Z,@MKVGuy: Great Quality!.. Keep Up The Good Work!  Cheers!..
,PHREEBO,2010-08-06T17:08Z,"Thanks again MKVGuy. This release is not so great, I will try your other release.
To Party Hampster,
Your right as there was no official BD rip when this rip was released. 
What is up with that?
Pirates now make OK quality theater rips, package them, and sell them as official BD releases on the streets of Hong Kong and the like.
Then some dude like MKVGuy comes along, buys it, rips it, and shares it with us. It's on a BD disk, so they often just call it a BD rip, even though it's not official and of lower quality than the real thing.
This is what many release groups may call an R5 release, but they are not official, they come from bootlegs. To ad to the confusion, there's an ambiguous wikipedia entry that supports the idea that R5 releases are official but they are not.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R5_%28bootleg%29
In the end, most people don't seem to care as long as it's good enough.
Overall MKVGuy and FXG have the best movie releases on TPB."
