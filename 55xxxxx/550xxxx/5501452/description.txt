256kbps CBR recording of Led Zeppelin's one-of reunion concert in London's O2 Arena on December 10th, 2007.
The place where I found this attributed it to a close-up microphone recording. 
As far as I'm concerned, the recording sounds great, and the band definitely still had it, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums for his late father.

Metadata:
Artist: "Led Zeppelin"
Album: "2007.12.10 - Reunion - London's O2 Arena"

Tracknumbered as if it was one disc, even though the show was longer than 80 minutes.
Tracks 1 through 10 on CD1 and tracks 11 through 19 on CD2 if you wish to put it on disc.

What a way to go out. :)
