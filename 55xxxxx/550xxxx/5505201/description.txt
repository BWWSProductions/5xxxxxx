Inside the Doors: A Critical Review 1967-1969

Like their East Coast compatriots the Velvet Underground, L.A. band the Doors went against the 1960s flower-power grain with dark, cerebral rock driven by the electrifying presence of their charismatic frontman, Jim Morrison. Though the band carried on after Morrison's drug-induced death in 1971, the Doors were at their creative peak from 1967 to 1969, when they released their first three records. This documentary offers a critical review of the Doors' recorded output during those legendary years through rare archival footage, interviews with critics and musicologists, and live performance clips.
