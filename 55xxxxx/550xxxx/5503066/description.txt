      Corridors of Power: Westminster Abbey. Episode 1. In the
      first episode of the new series, Tony Robinson, Professor Mick
      Aston and the Team investigate one of Britain's greatest
      historic landmarks: Westminster Abbey. Surrounded by the sights
      and sounds of Parliament Square, the archaeologists have three
      days to pin down the location of a lost sacristy, a stronghold
      that was built by Henry III almost 800 years ago and is said to
      have housed the biggest collection of treasure this side of the
      Alps. Under the watchful eye of the Abbey's clergy and numerous
      tourists, the diggers' attempts to find this important building
      are continually thwarted by the driving London rain and
      centuries of later building work.
