,mx_phreek,2010-04-20T11:36Z,"Thanx slick, but i have to say that i think this one is the worst one out of all your HD torrents to date, quite a few glitch's and blocky and just seemed poor, quality wise, picture wasn't sharp compared to your last few, which i thought were spot on as i have said. It might just be down to the shitty broadcast from speed, or trying to squeeze these down to near the 1gig mark, but i not sure on the last point as last few race's have been about same size. 450's was better though. Some ppl might say bs to what i am saying, but you can really notice it on the big screen tv. I think you know i not saying this to be mean or to bs you. I have just watched these and thought i should comment. Just being honest and trying to help keep you at the top of the game. Thanks.:-)"
