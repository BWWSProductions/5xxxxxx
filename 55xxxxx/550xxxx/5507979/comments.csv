This one is pretty bad.  Download another one."

I have no idea what Jasonofcompsci thinks is 'pretty bad' about it."
,blumoz,2010-10-26T08:18Z,I think Jasonofcompsci is from another release group thats why he thinks that this torrent is bad ... Beware Jason wants you to download some other crap torrent  .... everyone knows EZTV is the best ... Bad Mouthers will persist along good people ... thats how it is ...Hmmm
