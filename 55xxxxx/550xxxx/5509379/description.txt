Diana Vickers - BBC Live Lounge 2010 (2 songs)

Diana Vickers came into Maida Vale and performed her single 'Once' and and a cover of Snow Patrol's 'Just Say Yes'.

She talked to Fearne about the prospect of being number 1 this Sunday, and said that the best thing about being a pop star is all the free shoes (she got delivered the equivalent of a small show shop yesterday)

She also spoke about listening to Girls Aloud on her MP3 player and receiving texts from Cheryl Cole who Diana says is still looking out for her.
