2010 release, the eagerly-awaited fifth studio album from the Alt-Rock outfit and the first to be release since 2007's Super Taranta!. Produced by Grammy award-winning producer Rick Rubin, Trans-Continental Hustle combines the band's radical invocations of positive primal energy and planetary consciousness with music infused with Ska, Metal, Punk, Rap, Dub and intimations of indigenous Brazilian sounds to produce a party maelstrom of electrifying proportions. Led by revolutionary change agent and provocateur Eugene Hutz, Gogol Bordello, a nine-piece juggernaut of gypsy rebel soul, has become an international force to be reckoned with.
