School is back in session, Sophie. Last time PD saw you you had been having trouble finishing your work, it seems now you cannot even manage to show up to class. While the school itself may favor a demerit system, PD prefers corporal punishment. Suck and fuck, little girl, and maybe you wonâ€™t have to suffer so much. Crying is not a safe word, it is just an invitation to push things farther. â€œSee, what weâ€™re going to do is generate a lot of pain, then switch it over to pleasure,â€ he says. But you already knew that, right Sophie? That is why you just cannot manage to pass this class, right? There is something about the way PD provides extra credit that keeps you coming back for more.
