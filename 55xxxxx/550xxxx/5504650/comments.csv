Be careful"
,helicon99,2010-08-09T09:45Z,Sorry Raymondhome but your getting sloppy with your uploads.  I'm starting to find that most of your movies either don't work properly or are low quality.  I'm going to try this download because I always got my stuff from you in the past.  Thanks for the efforts.  I hope this turns out well.  
,veffect,2010-11-23T03:15Z,"Heard A&V were good. First torrent was being tracked. Second was mp4 (I don't like mp4) and also lo-qual.
Will rate quality when I'm finished."
