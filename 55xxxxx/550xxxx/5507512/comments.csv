,Saduff,2010-04-23T20:41Z,"SKiDROW deserves to be in the hall of shame for ripping the values off DORMINE's emulator.
It is confirmed that the whole contents of the values.db from Dormine's emulator along with 1 fake value has been ripped. Shame on you, SKiDROW!"
,Saduff,2010-04-23T20:43Z,"Should there be any updates to the values, then with this shit you won't be able to update them, because the values are hardcoded in the DLL."
,wrick3000,2010-04-23T22:51Z,Whatever happened whether SKIDROW ripped it from DORMINE or not. DORMINE will be a hero for us. And If we see Splinter Cell 5 and POP 5 in the week of the game released then we will be sure SKIDROW did a great job else we have take DORMINE's SHELTER.
,MaXXLchik,2010-04-24T08:43Z,"Seeeeeds!! Where are you?..
Enjoying the game?...
Let us enjoy it too..)
Come on, launch your torrent program and seed..))"

,Cease33,2010-04-25T14:10Z,"@saduff

Here is what skidrow has to say about that

read the nukers information"
,anarchy2,2010-04-25T19:34Z,Please seed. Download started out really fast (was getting around 1.0 mb/s) but then fell off around 50% and now I'm getting about 20 kb/s.
,wrick3000,2010-04-25T22:42Z,I uploaded this game so that u guys can play it after cracking it. Though I finished the game with DORMINE's emulator many people are facing problems with that. And shame on SKIDROW for ripping off DORMINE's values and not even bothering to give a credit to that guy. Not even that they just released an NFO to defend themselves. Anyway DORMINE also released a recent NFO revealing all SKIDROWS dark History. So guys just enjoy and hope DORMINE releases an EMULATOR for SPLINTER CELL 5. The torrent is already available in TPB. Happy Piracy.
,Saduff,2010-04-25T23:43Z,"""DORMINE also released a recent NFO""

That was NOT written by Dormine."
,wrick3000,2010-04-26T16:31Z,Can anyone confirm me whether they finished downloading their ac2.iso?
,pirateman101,2010-04-28T02:06Z,Please seed.  Right now its taking me 1 year to download.  I might as well just by the game at that rate...
,wrick3000,2010-04-28T08:55Z,"@pirateman101
its impossible man cuz people seems to download at 1mbps max so may its ur u-torrent settings that blocking u."
,andriis2,2010-05-01T13:51Z,could someone seed a bit?
,Danishaslam,2010-05-01T19:31Z,What the FUCK.. the Crack folder has win32 virus.. :@
,wrick3000,2010-05-02T12:15Z,"@Danishaslam
sometimes it happens that some antivirus such as Avast and AVG detect virus in reverse engineered exe's i.e. the cracks and keygen.
Don't worry there are no whatsoever virus. I tested it with Kaspersky."
,simer007,2010-05-06T07:01Z,"thx man its really working great
keep up the good work
thank you again"
,raul21219,2010-05-06T12:03Z,who can give me save game sequence 11 12 13  please
,simer007,2010-05-06T13:38Z,"the gam is working
but not a very good game"
,simer007,2010-05-06T13:39Z,sorry i wrote it here but the above comment is for splinter cell
,ags313,2010-05-14T03:46Z,i followed steps precisely and it still doesnt work says d3dx9_42.dll was not found...someone please tell me what i did wrong.......
,pixie1966,2010-05-17T04:19Z,My best bet would be that you just need to update your directx driver or sumthin. Best try finding a dx9 version if just updating to the latest dx10/dx11 doesn't work.
,ben_high,2010-05-19T05:15Z,"
 Game installed and played fine for awhile. But now when I try to launch the game I have an pop up that tries to get me to sign up for a ubisoft account and the game fails to launch. Anybody else have this problem? Maybe something I blocked or didnt block with windows firewall?

  Installing Splinter Cell Conviction might have caused my problem.

  Anyone have a solution? Or can someone tell me where saves are located so I can reinstall."
,mclethal,2010-05-28T09:24Z,does this crack work with other clone versions of the game????
,leekoonteng,2010-06-02T15:53Z,"i mounted the image using ultraiso and it wouldn't autorun. I then went in and double click on the autorun.exe file and this message came up ""the version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you're running"". apparently it has some problem about the 64bit or the 32bit version.. but when i read at the descriptions it say it works for 64 bit. what am i not doing correctly"
,minja096,2010-06-18T02:10Z,"i'm downloading the torrent now, but when i use it, do i need to burn it to a CD or what?

i'v never downloaded a torrent for a game before, so i don't have a clue.

will it work for win7 64 bit?"
,vizmajor,2010-06-19T18:10Z,@minja096 yes u either have to burn it or use a cd/dvd emulator like daemon tools (http://www.soft82.com/download/Windows/Daemon_Tools) i guess it's the right homepage. i didnt download it from here but its free and it should be it. now i dont have win7 or the game but i guess it should work pretty well. but its just a guess.
,abcddcb10,2010-06-21T07:51Z,"I don't know if anybody is facing this problem, I have installed the game and everything works fine the crack works like a charm, however when I climb on Towers the option given to interact or free jump into bales of hay does not work, instead I keep getting the synchronize animation over and over again, please help. I have tried using a keyboard (default control E) as well as using an Xbox 360 controller (using the default key Y) but neither work. I am pretty sure there is something very basic I am missing out, thanks for the help in advance."
,seed4me2u,2010-06-23T02:53Z,SEED PEOPLE!!! come on

,shadyrich,2010-08-25T22:51Z,"works perfect even on my crap pc, nice one mate your the best:-]"
,alexrattan,2010-08-31T16:20Z,"Hi, i dont really know much about torrents and stuff so if u do email me please could you keep the description simple :). I just downloaded the game files in about 2 days and then i tried to open it and it said it was corrupt or unreadable. so i opened summit else and it said to burn it to a disc, which of course needs at least 6.34 gb for the game to fit onto it so if i do buy a large space disk and burn it will it actually make the game work? because i thought it wouldnt really make any difference to the files wether it was on a disc or not? and also i downloaded the other file on the torrent called Assassins creed (Not SKIDROW assassins creed) as well as the 6.34gb file and i was wondering what that was for and if i needed to burn it as well to the disk for the game to work (I dont no wat it does but i thought it cant do much because its only like 13 Kb so please email me you answer to Maxman3344@hotmail.com 

Thanks :D"
,wcedric,2010-11-02T01:48Z,when it starts up i need to login to ubisoft. is there any when how to cancel this and play the game?
