Enjoy!

Set 4 Bonus:

1. Uncle Scrooge in Color CBDA
(reconstructed from
available scanned comics, so the original articles will not be
included.)

Set 1 version 2 is now available!

Set 8 will be ready in 2 weeks.

I am still putting together set 9-12.
I found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.
So, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,
then I can always copy and paste the english script 
into the italian comic.

Set 10 will have the fewest recent HQ comics, since
most of the comics were only reprinted in soft cover
graphic albums.  I have the WDSC graphic 
albums on hand, but I'm not willing to 
bend them all out of shape to scan.
Any suggestions?

Set 11 will have mkv videos of Carl Barks' Donald Duck 
short videos from the Chronological Donald Duck. 4+ gb of cartoons.
(7.9 GB) Also, B&W Pluto saves the ship comic is being updated.
Barks Bear book and Unexpurgated Barks are on hand for scanning.

Set 12 is going to have a thumbnail pictures of the Carl Barks oil paintings
organized into the Fine Art of DD book, Treasury of CB and Animal Quackers.
Set 12 will also include CB comic covers, Ducktales CB cartoons, articles and final CB stories and much more.

Also,I have bought some comics for scanning, but it
could take me a while to get them done.

a. Barks Bear book
b. Unexpurgated Barks
c. Barks and the Disney ducks
(booklet on DD statuettes)
d. Abbeville books:
i. US
ii. DD
iii. DD and nephews
(I intend to use these to update a few comics.)
e. US life and times
(I found a fair copy and a really good price.
I hope it does not get lost in the mail.)
f. informal biography of Scrooge McDuck
g. Authorized DD biograpy + CD of Barks interview
h. Dynabrite 53 Daisy and Donald: 7 from Daisy's Diary

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the uncropped comics online.
Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent 
scans of wdc&s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.


The CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans 
than posted within this collection, then
please leave a message and post up your comic scans.


I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
