[V],SaM,2010-04-20T22:59Z,in 4-5 hours it will be done in 700 mb
,JadeBoy,2010-04-20T23:09Z,"Please DDR, for maximum quality, please post a 1.4GB H264 file from the source. That would be far better than Xvid. And please, 6channel audio is not needed. Keep it 112kb/s. Please post such a file.

Looking forward for your reply. And 700MB in Xvid for a 2hr35min movie is bullshit.

Thanks, indeed the fastest upload!
Respect from me!"
,JadeBoy,2010-04-20T23:12Z,"Please DDR, 1.4 GB H264 upload karo! As I said earlier...please. Woh best hoga.

Thanks"
,freejellyman,2010-04-21T02:48Z,"Thanks guys. Downloading now.

MKV could also be a good option."
,surper,2010-04-21T05:32Z,"@SaM

There is no need for 700 mb. Everybody will  downloading this.

But We also need BRRIP H264 720P. Try make make that too."
,surper,2010-04-21T05:45Z,"hey wait a minute

In here the running times says 2:35:07 (155 Mins) in the IMDb  there are info that its 165 Mins. Where is the rest of 10 Minutes. Did the post credits removed? But DDR never did that before."
,acmi91,2010-04-21T07:57Z,"plz post it in 700-800 mb 
its nt possible for me 2 download 1.4gb
n aneway d quality is almost same of a 1.4gb file n 700mb file after conversion. so it doesnt mak much of a difference in quality. plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz i am begging u.."
,acmi91,2010-04-21T08:02Z,"@JadeBoy n surper- u cant b selfish u hav high bandwidth n unlimited usage doesnt mean every 1 have dem. 
@pinka123-thx for d link bt i usually prefer ddr uploads from sam as dey r d best.
thx aneway."
,yesbos,2010-04-21T08:52Z,"SaM tx 4 this too. 
I think most of guys must watch this release, cos when it comes to 700mb, u has to watch it in low resolution screen, like in Tv, and normally sound will be 80 or 90 kbps (i.e very low). This has AC3 that mean perfect sound quality.
We must b very fair when talk about video codecs. we know still everyone has dvd players only compatible for xvid. Although we know H264 is the best, we have to b democratic too :).
If some one need H264 release, its better b wait for upscale release from DDR.
Believe me, i did download avatar Vision retail version weeks ago (for my friends). But i still not even peek @ it. Cos i wait for tomorrow (April 22) Blue ray release.  
Tx SaM, n Tx DDR."
,acmi91,2010-04-21T10:26Z,"hey r u releasing d 700mb version???

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-29T13:09Z,"@surper

About the missing 10 minutes runtime. You should note that this rip is from a PAL DVD, i.e. @25 fps. The runtime on iMDB is the theatrical runtime, i.e. where the movie is run @24 fps. This may sound like a joke if it's the first time you hear it, but actually the most used way to convert 24fps to film in Europe and other PAL regions is just speed it up from 24 fps to 25 fps, thus making the movie slightly shorter in terms of runtime (although you're not missing anything as it just runs a little bit faster). This would account for some 10 minutes ""missing"". Don't worry about it, it's all there :)"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-29T13:13Z,"Edit: ""convert 24fps to film"" - of course I meant convert 24fps film to DVD."
,mania44,2010-05-30T19:25Z,movie cuts in and out of english. any reason? a/v 10/10 though. thnx
,AtotehZ,2010-08-18T02:53Z,"I am an Asperger and was very skeptic when downloading this movie as Aspergers Syndrome is kinda hard to make out of someone personality. I found out that the protagonist Rizvan is a High-Functioning Autist and not Asperger like 2 mins into the movie, the director shouldve done his homework on the subject, but i guess it had to look dramatic for the sake of the audience."
,AtotehZ,2010-08-18T02:57Z,"That being said, i liked the movie.. it has its flaws but sets some powerful emotions in motion.

For you guys who had problems getting along with the subtitles theres a resynched file here:
