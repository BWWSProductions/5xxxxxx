,DemonWak,2010-04-19T20:02Z,"i did this encode, i can confirm ;)
thx for spreading my work friend "
,s0meguy,2010-04-22T14:02Z,where did the uncensored one air?
,rsplatpc1,2010-04-24T07:33Z,"no logos or bleeps on cuss words, MOHAMMAD is BLACK BAR CENSORED the WHOLE TIME, this is exactly what you saw aired except the cuss words are not bleeped, so if you thing your going to see MOHAMMAD or what Comedy Central censored you WILL NOT"
,zushigreg,2010-04-27T13:44Z,"rsplatpc1, did you even watch this? This is episode 200, not 201. 201 was the one with the black box and the bleeped voices. This one is uncensored. I don't even think there was a censored version of this episode.

Now, where is 201 uncensored?"
,AoF,2010-05-05T12:18Z,"All I found that isn't censored is when the camera is facing the u-haul and all you hear is him talking for like 1 second. Not really worth the Dl in my opinion, but thanks for the up."
,iamrifter,2010-05-27T09:28Z,"AoF Muhammed talked out of the Uhaul in the broadcast version too.
The black bar muhammed is in episode 6 (201) not this one.  However you are right that he does not appear in this episode."
,steviekeyz,2010-10-25T07:50Z,"Super Best Friends is not Uncensored... This is the way it was original made before the controversial so-called Muslims got offended (terrorists). You will never see Muhammad like you did in Super Best Friends, only like Cartoon Wars. Comedy Central doesn't want to be blown up due to some idiot so-called Muslims that have no life and threaten individuals all day. 

So when Season 14 is on DVD it will be just like this, when I see the word uncensored in south park episodes, I usually think the audio is not bleeped, if your a fan you should know why Muhammad is black barred."
,xposya,2011-12-28T07:45Z,"damn what a fuck up its episode 201 we need uncensored, s14e06 the speeches were not bleeped originally that was done by comedy central

can someone please get episode 6 uncensored and post it? thanks"
