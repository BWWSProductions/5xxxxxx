,deeko5574,2010-05-01T19:02Z,I have the English subs to this but I don't know how to upload?  Someone leave an email address and I'll send the subs for you to seed. Ta
,cinesimon,2010-05-04T03:34Z,"Hi deeko5574, if your English subs are better than the really bad sub files available at opensubtitles.com and subscene.com, I'd be really, truly, mighty grateful if you could send them to me.
My address is cinesimonj@gmail.com
Thanks very much - may good karma rain down upon you...
Though if you send me a virus, the karma may go the other way(Joke in case that didn't translate well)!!
Cheers man - really appreciate the offer."
