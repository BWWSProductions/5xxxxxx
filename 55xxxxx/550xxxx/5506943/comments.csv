,supermetalman123,2010-04-21T17:59Z,"thx this is great upload, and good quality. Recommended for all Bullet fans wondering if this is real!"
,FeRoCITy05,2010-04-22T00:03Z,"Nice quality, better than my previous download, Thank you. 

But to all of BFMV, Fever is wicked with fast rhythm and incredible solos. But the main thing that disappointed me about this album is way too many fuckin' ballads... They aren't really ""Metalcore"" any longer, I think they are drifting into the ""Heavy Metal"" genre... Agree that you can hear some screamo from Jay but this album contained even less screamo than Scream Aim Fire (the album) And Fever sounded way, way, way too different and has literally nothing like The Poison (All that screamin by Matt and Jay has literally all disappeared) The ONLY song that have a good ""Screamo"" parts is ""Begging For Mercy"". 

Good album. Nice quality. But definitely nothin like i (we all) has been expected from BFMV.  But They still kick asses! "

,CowBandit,2010-04-24T09:02Z,"I take what i said back about the quality, only 3 of the songs are good quality. the 320kps sounds like 96kbs. ""Your Betrayal, The last fight, Begging for mercy"" are all Good quality but the others are poor quality"
,TheBombio,2010-04-24T20:41Z,"Safe torrent.
Good quality. Tracks 1, 3 and 10 sound a bit better in quality than the rest of the songs.

Been waiting to hear this for a long time. Such a good album. Thank you!"
,Sykesx,2010-04-25T01:37Z,Thank you so much 
,Ronbert,2010-04-25T03:37Z,"I agree with FeRoCITy05, I don't know if I'd bother with this album. Decent quality though."
,FeRoCITy05,2010-04-25T10:03Z,"I will have to take that back for the quality. My very apology. ""Your Betrayal"", ""The Last Fight"", and ""Begging For Mercy"" is the three tracks that have the ""Decent"" quality. After quite a lot of researching, I have founded a nice quality download for this very album.

Download is required WinRar because the files is uploaded into a .Rar folder. Almost seemed like a CD Rip. Enjoy."
,vietnoboy,2010-04-26T17:36Z,"Really bad quality audio, do not download. Only about 3 songs have good quality, the rest are terrible."
,doublepedaldylan,2010-04-27T05:46Z,"WAIT TIL A BETTER RIP COMES OUT!!!

Some of the songs are good, the others are NOT 320k.  They are re-ripped at 320, they were pretty low quality, "

,h1p1n3,2010-07-27T17:46Z,"Downloaded ok, but sounds like horse crap. Bitrate is up there at 320, but the source recording must have been vinyl or something."
,phant0m822,2010-08-18T13:27Z,real deal
,EfVonZee,2010-09-05T16:32Z,"This is their gayest release yet... Sorry ...but really. Its way to chilled. This is wat happens when you go commercial. 

The quality is pretty crap... its says 320 but sounds more like 96.

rather download: http://www.filestube.com/dae4431fff1f291103e9,g/Bullet-For-My-Valentine-Fever-2010.html 

sounds much better."
,Flux-Assasin,2010-10-06T20:29Z,this is crap quality like only 3 songs sound good and then the rest I can hardly hear with my worn out head phones...
[T],[JiMi],2011-01-11T02:15Z,"Hello. Can someone who has downloaded http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4938908/Bullet_For_My_Valentine-Hearts_Burst_Into_Fire-DVDRiP-x264-2008- please seed a little. My computer crashed a while ago, and I lost it, and now I can't find it anywhere anymore. Thank you."
,echro,2011-03-01T03:28Z,"I am re-downloading this because the first time I got it was before it really even came out, so the quality was all shitty."
,echro,2011-03-01T03:30Z,"Wow, this downloaded in about a minute. Great Upload :)"
