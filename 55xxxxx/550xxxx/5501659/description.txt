Maxi (Javier CÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡mara) thinks his life is perfect. He is a famous cook who owns a top hyped restaurant in Chueca (the gay district of Madrid), with his most important goal being to get the restaurant rated by the Michelin guide. He is living the homosexual lifestyle without problems and hangups, with his employees as his closest confidants -including Alex (Lola DueÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±as) and Ramiro (Fernando Tejero). But when his son Edu (Junio Valverde) and daughter (who were born from an unsuccessful marriage) appear and a new neighbor, Horacio (BenjamÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­n VicuÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±a) moves in (an attractive famous Argentinian ex-soccer player), they will completely turn his life upside down and make him question his values.... It has non-stop comedy twists involving Maxi, the children, the employees in the restaurant, the handsome neighbor, and Maxi's parents. Just when you think you can't laugh anymore, it takes things one step further.
