[V],thethingy,2010-04-22T20:34Z,thanks bro
,strawhot_25,2010-04-23T00:35Z,tnx ..can u tell me how 2 seed
,drviolin,2010-04-23T08:04Z,"@strawhit_25: Seeding is when you have a complete file (aka ""seed"") and are willing to share it. In other words, when you have finished downloading, keep your torrent client running so others can download the file from you. It's that simple!:) "
,yosoyusuario,2010-04-23T09:05Z,"Thanks a lot, bro. Thumbs up for You"
,strawhot_25,2010-04-23T09:58Z,"@drviolin  tnx!



@degun nice upload"
,locosurf,2010-04-23T14:19Z,"degun rocks!¡
cant unrar it.how to do?¿"
,drviolin,2010-04-23T16:03Z,"DeGun, you are the greatest! Many thanks! This is a somewhat smaller bundle than Nero 7 Ultra, and it takes a while to install, but it has just about everything anyone might need except Nero ShowTime. There are other ways to play video files, so that is no great loss. Registration could not be simpler with the serial already provided. Excellent deal for the money!:) "
,drviolin,2010-04-23T17:30Z,"Sorry, I was wrong in my previous comment! Turns out, this bundle has everything - it's just arranged and called differently. It also seems to be much better designed than Nero's earlier attempts. Great upload, DeGun!:) "

,Stu1977,2010-04-25T16:15Z,@DaGun na none of those serials work mate but cheers anyway btw yer Nero10 upload is the best iv had brilliant.
,jnorref,2010-04-26T23:18Z,"Bon et bien je crois que j'ai trouvé la réponse
Nero prévoit d'introduire la fonction de lecture des disques Blu-ray du commerce dans Nero Multimedia Suite 10 au deuxième semestre 2010. Ceci se fera grâce à un plug-in optionnel, étant donné que peu d'utilisateurs de Nero 10 choisiront de payer le prix élevé de la licence pour la lecture de Blu-ray. L'inclure dans le produit de base augmenterait significativement le prix de vente de Nero Multimedia Suite 10.
Cependant, il est possible de lire dans Nero Multimedia Suite 10 des disques Blu-ray créés par les utilisateurs ne contenant pas de contenu commercial (par ex. une séquence de film en AVCHD tournée avec une caméra personnelle). De plus, le plug-in Blu-ray authoring, en option dans l'ancienne version, est désormais intégré sans frais supplémentaires dans Nero Multimedia Suite 10."

,Crash613,2010-05-11T09:48Z,"What did i do wrong?

ok i followed the instructions on page 1.  I installed with the internet running and let it do it's thing.  i got to the step of restarting...restarted the computer with THE ETHERNET CABLE PULLED OUT OF THE COMPUTER SO NO WAY COULD CONNECT TO INTERNET.

it installed and finished... finally. 

i started smartassstart 10 and it did indeed say key was registered.  i added the other keys from the txt file.

Every time i try to use a program i get the Patent activation screen that wants me to connect to the internet.  if i do not connect it doesn't let me use the program.  it has not connected since the reboot because the internet cable is UNPLUGGED so that isn't the problem.

can't seem to get around the patent activation."

,jahem1980,2010-05-26T05:15Z,"@ DeGun
I am the owner of my pc and have full admin rights. I am running Windows 7 Pro. When I have a .avi, divx, or you know, something you get off here it won't burn saying it is an unrecognized file and tells me it needs to be recoded to dvd format using NeroVision so when I do that and it's done I go to burn it and it says it found an unsuspected file and cannot burn. I've had this for over 2 weeks and haven't been able to burn anything but 1 cd, now that worked fine. I currently use aone dvd burner and it converts the file then burns and does a real nice job and is real stable but has to convert the file everytime I burn it so if I burn a movie 10 times it has to be burned 10 times and takes 40 mins to 1 hr 10 mins each time depending on how long the movie is. I'm hoping I can get something like this up and running and it will be so much faster so I can pick up production bc for right now I only have a laptop so I have to burn each one and can't copy like on a desktop. If anyone has a suggestion on how I can get this thing to convert, recognize and burn these movie files then please help,THANX DeGun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,Anti455,2010-06-02T16:00Z,"Hey DeGun,

Thanks for your suggestions.

I browsed the comments on your other torrent and didn't find much on the patent activation issue. I just did a complete uninstall of Nero 10 (When I ran the General Nero Cleaner Tool after the uninstall it said 'no Nero products detected') I then installed Nero again but the problem still persists. It cant be an issue with a previous version of Nero as this is a brand new Windows 7 x64 install. Isn't there a Patent crack like there was for Nero 9 around? I cant be the only one with this problem. Otherwise everything else seems awesome! Just hoping to get Vision up.

Thanks for this uplaod and Keep up your excellent work!! xD"

,TadasT,2010-06-04T04:15Z,"OK well I just tried to install the program again. I let the program connect to the internet so it could validate. Since this is my second time installing it didn't ask me to restart the PC (I ran a full uninstall of Nero 10 and also removed Nero Remove Tools. After doing that I could not find any Nero files on my HD). So since I could not figure out how to stop Nero from accessing the internet I just unplugged my computer from my modem. I installed everything and I still am getting a request to give them a ""3rd party patent."" I am using the first of the two codes that were given with the DL. At this point I am using PC Tools Firewall and I have every single thing with Nero in it blocked since they showed up once I installed. Thanks for the help, I really need this program! "

I appreciate all your prompt feedback, very impressive versus most uploaders!

If you're not busy, would you know why when I'm installing the Suite it gets caught up and doesn't go any further when it's loading the Nero 10 Sample Image Pack and it just says please wait while Windows configures Nero 10 Sample Image Pack, because it's frustrating, and on this computer I've never had any prior nero programs so I know that's not the problem, and it says the serials fine so I'm quite puzzled!! 

Thank you very much for your time, and great upload!"

,DMNKLR,2010-06-12T05:28Z,"This would be a great download, if I could actually use it.  I too am getting the patent activation problem, and have NEVER installed Nero on this machine before.  It's a pirated serial number problem, not a previous version problem.  Give us working serials, or we just can't trust downloads from you any more.  Thanks.  Btw, it happens in NeroVision when attempting to import a video file, ANY video file."
,Ahsan_8,2010-06-12T09:54Z,hey degun thx again . installed it and works great but 1 prob though whenever i run any program of nero it says to first activate it patents and shit like that . gives me options to activate over net over fax etc . anyway to get rid of this ?   thx  in advvance :)
,Ahsan_8,2010-06-12T09:59Z,"@DMNKLR

it still works it just says to activate patents :P just click on the X of the windows and continue doing what you were doing still works . its annoying though i know  :( . but saying it doesnt work iz wrong :D im currently using on win vista home and win 7 home  works great :D except for the patents annoying me :("
,nirvanaj,2010-06-12T19:43Z,"thnx for download i had your smaller version got rid of all the files and it works ok, stop complaining people; if you cant get rid of the old files with neroclean or whatever do it yourself, i did and i'm a novice. just go into C, search and get rid of what you can after uninstalling all of nero of course. just one question Degun i tried to play avatar brrip with mediahub but it wont work, it says (in french) que j'ai besoin de l'activation du brevet et que le dts decoding n'est pas disponible dans votre produit and it tries to connect itself to nero online which i stop. Any tips wont work on media player or divx plus either"

I need the trial code.

,newsletter,2010-06-15T19:50Z,"Hi DeGun, thanks for responding, as it says in the directions ""Accept Program to connect to internet for Validator Tool"", this is where I was, this is right at the beginning of the installation when it asks you to enter the serial number.
It also says in the directions to ""INSTAL WITH TRY SERIAL ALREADY INCLUDED""
I realize that this torrent is a bit dated now and certainly appreciate your help. While we're here, do I let the validator tool connect to the internet as it's stated in the directions or not, or do I allow it for the first time, and then disallow in the future after supposed reboot? I am running Win7.
Thanks again for providing this to us. By the way, the iso doesn't come with any instructions, don't know if you forgot to include the NFO."
,newsletter,2010-06-15T19:54Z,"Oh and BTW DeGun, I did search through the comments, and also looked for the serial elsewhere but could not come up with one, the only serials I could find were generated ones that would not validate with the first check in the install anyway.

This is the reason I thought I would need the trial key as I believe it would need to validate that key prior to continuing with the installation where later, I thought you would need to stop the app from accessing the internet.

Thanks again for your help, I'll trying the install with the key you provided, hope that's the trial key."
,newsletter,2010-06-15T20:39Z,"Thanks for all of your help, installed everything fine, no problems encountered yet, great upload DeGun, thanks a lot.

,retardoface,2010-06-22T00:03Z,"Works perfectly with Windows 7 ultimate x64. Here is all the steps for those still having troubles including the how to block them from getting to the internet with windows firewall:

Extract all rar in the same folder , only extract part 1 other will follow :
after you will have an ISO image - Mount it using poweriso or ultraiso or alcohol120% 
(see my last torrents) so mount it then run set up 
(if this kindda block ur computer TRY to extract the ISO to a folder then run set up)
after you run set up it tells you that nero need to connect to internet to download some additional progs , 
like for instance validator tool ; accept TEMPORALY nero to go to internet. Once nero finished downloading this it will tell you that you need to restart to start instal , 
do so reboot but FROM NOW ON ALWAYS REFUSE NERO to go to INTERNET ; then instal takes a while , once instal is finished start NERO SMARTSTART , 
you might have to set ADVANCED mode i dont remember , 
but so on nero smartstart find a grey circle with an ARROW which gives u pop up windows when clicked , 
there you will see activate or register or enter serial etC... get nero serial first , 
then confirm then your activation should ssay ""never end"" then check down that same window on the right side ADD OTHER PRODUCTS or ADD other serial.. 
add all other serials included in the txt file , BLUERAY plugin is not yet available so keep the serial on side.
that should be it for nero instal .

i use Eset smart security - firewall let you decide to block or not progs if you configure INTERACTIVE MODE , you will be prompt for each progs that wanna go to the net ...
 think to change yours for this (see my torrents for last version) so afteR...

Awesome post.  Everyone always claims they have nero working only to admit later that RECODE doesn't work.

My procedure.
blocked nero.com etc using host files.
blocked nero.com, activation, etc at my router.
Uninstalled nero 7.
ran Nero cleaner from Ahead.
reboot.
updated .net reboot
updated .net some more.  reboot
Installed Nero 10.  Took forEVER.
Gave it the first serial.
Finished
Recode and Vision give the patent activation crap.
The extra serial was accepted but didn't make the pa stuff go away.
INstalled a bunch of serials in the control center. mp3pro, dts,  All accepted.
Added a nero recode serial. accepted
Works just fine.
Bottom line.  My install NEVER went to nero.com."

There is no sound using Recode which usually means the plugins are not registered.  I've registered mp3pro, dts, and gracenote.  I can't get it to work.  Beautiful video though.  In previous versions there was something called multitrack I believe.

Its always hardest on the seeders when the software is designed to act this way - as the designers of the torrent system seem to wanna try to discourage good folks who have heart - cause they don't wanna leave them with a mind to keep sane about reasonable efforts to help others who want to try something out (like software) before affording to eventually pay."
,scandal0us,2011-03-13T16:36Z,Thanks for the upload. And thanks rayquest for that info on the hosts file. Works like a charm and I don't have to mess with the firewall! Sweet upload!

,10to10to10,2011-03-22T06:59Z,"Thanks for the upload, works great on a Wn7 64bit OS, copy and paste the list of serials on this page, just for reference later if needed, but everything went ok.

Great Download speed, i was getting a nice 550-600kbps,,, see what happens when people SEED !! 

When you download something, let it seed untill the RATIO is 1.00 and we can all enjoy faster downloads like this one!

,240011,2011-03-29T08:50Z,It says Data1.cab error 
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-05-16T08:14Z,"Indeed there are 2 cracks by kindly // ru-board

AdvrCntr5.v2.0.8.2.Kindly.Edition.v1.3.for.Nero.10 (for 10.5)

AdvrCntr5.v2.0.9.10.Kindly.Edition.v1.0.for.Nero.10.6

But you also need working serials (non blacklisted I suppose).

I have not tested these cracks, as I don't need them. I'm using another software (and free).

I'm sorry that I cannot upload a torrent for the above cracks. I don't have them and I'm quit from this stuff.

Either use google.com to search for them or wait for someone else to upload them or better buy Nero if you use it that much."
[V],DeGun,2011-05-18T14:29Z,"all serials in this upload ARE WORKING even if blacklisted as anyway you should NOT let the app go on internet .

thx all for comments"
[V],DeGun,2011-05-18T14:34Z,"@Ã  alboy76 & popina ... 

if you cant register it means you have to use nero clean tool before instaling this version + clean fully your computer with youruninstaller or advnaced system care + follow instructions . KEYZ are in the TXT FILE included you need to read comments on top for more infos (ie: run exe accept temporaly internet out for extra needed files then reboot as asked to start instaler then from now refuse internet out , run nero exe go top left check enter serial or register then enter one by one serials given .

Check again top comments for patern problem activation ...

thx all for comments"
,crimson85067,2011-05-27T11:52Z,"need more detail on HOW to prevent nero from accessing the internet.

[V],DeGun,2011-06-07T09:53Z,"@@ Crimson 

i understand your fustration as being clever is not something you can buy ... so instead looking ina shop for a piece of brain i suggest you do on simple thing : unplug internet ! 

huh ? noob ? nah never ."
,ScaryGirl,2011-06-17T19:52Z,"Everything went fine until a part in the installation, it gives me an error saying that it can't find data1.cab. The file exists and is accessible, but for some reason the installer won't find it."
,ScaryGirl,2011-06-17T21:23Z,nvm. I re-extracted it and it worked.
,freedomdwarf,2011-07-21T20:33Z,"installs ok but Nero vision crashes every time no matter what I try to import.
No specific error - just that nero has encountered a problem... etc."
,freedomdwarf,2011-07-21T20:39Z,"@DeGun -
most of what you mention isn't in this torrent!!
just a big install exe and a small serial text file - everything else is missing!"

,ragebughaw,2011-09-03T08:51Z,I have a problem .. i cant import ANY Video .. can anybody help me please !!!!
