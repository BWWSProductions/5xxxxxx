    In a series about the extraordinary stories behind maps    
    Professor Jerry Brotton uncovers how maps aren't simply   
    about getting from A to B but are revealing snapshots    
    of defining moments in history and tools of political     
    power and persuasion.                                      
                                                              
    Visiting the world's first known map, etched into the    
    rocks of a remote alpine hillside 3,000 years ago,        
    Brotton explores how each culture develops its own         
    unique, often surprising way of mapping. As Henry         
    VIII's stunning maps of the British coastline from a     
    bird's eye view show, they were also used to exert        
    control over the world.                                    
                                                              
    During the Enlightenment, the great French Cassini       
    dynasty pioneered the western quest to map the world      
    with greater scientific accuracy, leading also to the      
    British Ordnance Survey. But these new scientific         
    methods were challenged by cultures with alternative     
    ways of mapping, such as in a Polynesian navigator's      
    map which has no use for north, south and east.            
                                                              
    As scientifically accurate map-making became a powerful  
    tool of European expansion, the British carved the        
    state of Iraq out of the Middle East. When the British     
    drew up Iraq's boundaries, they had devastating           
    consequences for the nomadic tribes of Mesopotamia.
