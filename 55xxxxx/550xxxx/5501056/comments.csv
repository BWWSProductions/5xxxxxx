,cndkp,2010-04-17T21:10Z,Thank you friend !!
,guy_wild,2010-04-17T21:12Z,Very fast! Thank you.
,Nurhg,2010-04-17T21:16Z,"Swedish text already?
And the resolution is probably going to be horrible, 238mb file size and all that.

Still, I love you idf560 :p"
,Illanair,2010-04-17T21:28Z,Hope you haven't hardcoded those subtitles. Would be a real shame. :(
,Green_Banana,2010-04-17T21:44Z,"Still, it's the only torrent up and the episode aired well over an hour ago.  "
,Beryl-Riddle,2010-04-17T21:50Z,"Thank you!! But please, seed!!!"
,Green_Banana,2010-04-17T21:54Z,"Yar, I be seedin' the meager 3.1% I've downloaded in thar past hour as much as I can, Cap'n!  "
,Beryl-Riddle,2010-04-17T21:57Z,"Almost the same - 3,2%"
,ananke23,2010-04-17T22:02Z,"3.3% seeding here.  What gives?  
I hope someone uploads a copy, and then actually seeds it long enough for ppl to get a copy :P"
,Illanair,2010-04-17T22:10Z,Still waiting to be allowed to seed. Seems there is either a lack of seeders or their upload is crappy. Stuck at around 9% :/
,PI22,2010-04-17T22:14Z,"Also, there is so accompanied .srt file so when there are really Swedish subtitles baked in the picture, this is no good for me - no offense to the Swedish..."
,nonode,2010-04-17T22:15Z,How is it that this is still the only torrent available...?
,PI22,2010-04-17T22:15Z,(little typo: I meant no accompanied .srt)
,Green_Banana,2010-04-17T22:19Z,"Good question.  The show airs at 6:30PM GMT, it runs for approximately 45 minutes, and it's now 9:10PM GMT.  I certainly hope there hasn't been any sort of national crisis in the UK. :(  We should check if our friends there are safe and sound.  "
,Green_Banana,2010-04-17T22:22Z,Ălg biter kan vara mycket otĂ¤ck.
[T],idf560,2010-04-17T23:07Z,"Sorry, but I don't know what's happened here. There are NO SUBTITLES and I'm sure I didn't set it for them."
,cow_man,2010-04-20T05:36Z,"It's good, thanks"
,Imdrivin,2010-04-20T22:34Z,"Excellent, all episodes very fast d/loads , looking forward to the rest! Thanks very much"
