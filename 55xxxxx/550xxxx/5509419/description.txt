Playstation
This game is a 3rd person shooter with the famous character Duke Nukem, released in 1998. In this game you will have fun saving the world from another breed of aliens who are again trying to conquer the world using time travel.  I loved this game as a kid, so don't ruin it by complaining about the old school graphics.
You can play with an emulator or a modded Playstation. If sound is choppy, then use another plugin or disable XA audio.
