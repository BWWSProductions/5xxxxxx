"LEE MARVIN VS. DEREK JETER"

Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) starts making an effort to 
date by attending singles events with Jenna 
Maroney (Jane Krakowski), and Jack Donaghy (Alec 
Baldwin) feels forced to choose between 
childhood love, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), 
and news anchor Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks). 
Meanwhile, a racist comment sparks an office-
wide debate on affirmative action and leaves 
Toofer (Keith Powell) with a big decision to 
make regarding his future at TGS.

Enjoy :)
