,dannykard,2010-04-18T17:24Z,"Yes, same sources."
,dannykard,2010-04-18T20:31Z,"@DanielRemains I'm not backing up your torrent. I downloaded the content from the same source as you, and created my own torrent. My seedbox, my torrents."
,stakamaka,2010-04-19T02:34Z,"@dannykard Then you could probably help him seed... he uploaded first, and it'd be better for all of us with just one torrent."
,dannykard,2010-04-19T08:15Z,"@stakamaka Ok, I started helping."
,chatner,2010-04-22T12:54Z,Anyone an idea how to get a german 2010? Thanks for help!
,yingjai,2010-04-22T17:14Z,haven't been following office 2010 that closely.. what the heck is Select Edition?
,stalker2755,2010-04-22T17:20Z,"@chatner You could get the English one and the language pack in Deutsch for it. See thethingy's torrents (the guy above) and look for proofing tools.

Danny, could you please post a bigger screen of the products list?"
,chatner,2010-04-22T21:16Z,@stalker2755: Thanks to You! Also to thethingy! Works. My Pulitzer is saved now...
