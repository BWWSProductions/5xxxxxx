Since this is DDR release pls add tags DDR when upload the torrent.
Bcos everyone search for DDR name, only few know this is DDR's. 
Since the hash code is same no one else can put this after rename.
What i want to say is give always credits to original ripper and uploader, cos this just released. :)
Tx."
