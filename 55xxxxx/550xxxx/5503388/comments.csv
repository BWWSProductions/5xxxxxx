,Hegelian.Dialectic,2010-04-19T22:38Z,"This is not converted from an AVI, please read. As for me, I will not put up a DVDRip, maybe someone else will. I think this HQ MOV conversion is good and let's people know where to get better quality original DVD if they want. I know the crew says share, but I prefer to use versions like this for making free copies, personally. It seems right. Good luck."

Why waste your time and money on this garbage? Jones and Bermas are both Zionist shills."
