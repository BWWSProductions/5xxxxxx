,fittball,2010-09-05T22:02Z,but this is only french?
[V],VLiS,2010-09-12T17:37Z,"@ fittball

It's a French movie, not English hence the French audio."
,abhranet,2010-09-22T07:18Z,thank u
,Mick1337,2010-12-21T04:19Z,thankyou!
,vivatpb5776,2011-06-18T13:26Z,The video quality is good (not great but good). Embedded subs for the French dialogue would have been great but I will deal with the soft subs. Thank you uploader.
,gru_zloto,2011-11-12T17:47Z,"What's wrong with soft subs ? Anyone with a clue can use them, when hardcoded subs can not be removed.
Why waste storage with movies with hardcoded subs: one full movie per sub ?

Thanks to VLiS for *not* embedding subtitles!"
