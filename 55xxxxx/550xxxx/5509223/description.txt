Dirt Nasty is the self-titled debut album by artist Dirt Nasty, also known as Simon Rex. Dirt Nasty was released by Shoot To Kill Music in association with Myspace Records. The album's most popular track was "1980," which was distributed on MySpace and iTunes. Dirt Nasty is credited as the impetus behind Mickey Avalon's personal rediscovery of, and subsequent success in, hip hop.[1] Mickey Avalon's song "My Dick" (featuring Dirt Nasty and Andre Legacy) was featured in the 2008 movie Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.[2][3][4]

The song "1980" starts off with the phrase "What happened to your queer party friends?" This quote is said by Jack Nicholson in the movie As Good As It Gets which was released in 1997.
