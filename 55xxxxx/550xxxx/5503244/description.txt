This is Vol. 1 of my copy of Fall Out Toy Works.  I scanned it myself.  Of course this was back when I was a huge Fall Out Boy fan, but I hope you all enjoy.

Fall Out Toy Works is a American comic book limited series, created by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, Darren Romanelli, and Nathan Cabrera.[1] It is written by Brett Lewis, whose previous work includes The Winter Men, and is illustrated by several members of Imaginary Friends Studios.[1][2] The first issue was published by Image Comics on September 2, 2009.[3]

The story is about androids with artificial intelligence in a futuristic Los Angeles. It has been compared to Pinocchio and Pygmalion.[4]

The plot is "inspired by the ideas & lyrics of Fall Out Boy", especially the song "Tiffany Blews" from the album Folie Ã  Deux.[1] The story focuses on the Toymaker, who despite being a brilliant inventor, finds himself in financial trouble. A rich magnate known as the Baron seeks to have a robotic woman companion, but his team of scientists is unable to create one that behaves realistically. The Baron hires the Toymaker to help advance the process, and he creates a new android named Tiffany.
