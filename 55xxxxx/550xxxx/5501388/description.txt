STEAMIN' is one of the classic albums by Miles Davis's first great quintet, along with WORKIN', RELAXIN', and COOKIN'. With John Coltrane beside him in the front line, and the smooth-as-cream rhythm section of Philly Joe Jones (drummer), Paul Chambers (drums), and Red Garland (piano), Miles creates, on STEAMIN', a definitive slice of sophisticated post bop. 


Whether treating standards ("When I Fall in Love;" "Surrey With the Fringe On Top") or Thelonious Monk ("Well, You Needn't"), Miles and company never misstep, turning in a record for the ages that will not go stale, no matter how many times it's played. The 2007 reissue features beautifully remastered sound.

This classic Prestige session (one of four cut for the label by Davis' first permanent group) has been reissued many times. Davis is heard with his classic quintet of 1956 (which featured tenor-saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones) performing six numbers, all of which are memorable. Highpoints are Surrey with the Fringe on Top, Diane and When I Fall in Love; Davis's muted tone rarely sounded more beautiful. 6 tracks.
