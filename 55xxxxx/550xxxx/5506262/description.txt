Mastering the Art of French Cooking - Julia Child

After watching the movie "Julie and Julia" I checked my drive and found that I
had already downloaded a copy of this book, but that there were no bookmarks
and the page numbers were all wrong.

In memory of my grandmother, who was an excellent cook and with who I spent
many hours of my youth watching Julia Child and other chefs like Graham Kerr,
and who taught me a lot about cooking, I've spent a few days correcting these
deficiencies so that I could offer you all an upgrade of Julia and Company's work.

I've run this through OCR and created bookmarks and re-numbered the pages so
that you can us the table of contents and the index to find specific recipes.

Although this is a bit dated, this being the 1964 printing, I hope you all will enjoy
reading and using it, and especially I hope you will teach your sons and
daughters to appreciate good, fresh food as well as relaxing and working in the
kitchen.

Although our tastes have changed quite a bit since Julia Child and Friends wrote
this, there is a lot of useful, basic information in this book.

Live, Love, Create, Enjoy!
