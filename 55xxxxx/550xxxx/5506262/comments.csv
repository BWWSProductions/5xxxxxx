I also like the fact that you synced the page numbers to the reader page number. I think this is the first ebook I've ever seen that this is true. Sure makes it easier to find what you want. 
You are wrong, though, when you say this book is a bit dated. It never will be. In fact, the better cook books are the older ones. Check out ""Joy of Cooking."" The 1975 version is the best. It was updated several years ago for ""modern lifestyles"" and a lot of the good stuff was left out and junk added. The 1975 classic was recently re-released. I'd like to acquire a hard copy and a digital copy of that one as my 1975 version is showing quite a bit of wear.
I wish this ebook had been smaller but don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, I just wish it had been compressed more. 
BTW, what OCR program did you use and did it require much proofreading and correcting? I can't believe it has as few mistakes as it does.
Thanks again, I'm forever grateful."

Although I'll probably just glance through this and never touch it again, I'm sure others with more enthusiasm toward cooking appreciate it."

,chefalu1,2010-05-11T06:06Z,And what a labour of love you did on this book.  Julia would be proud!..and your grandmother.  Maybe they are together cooking up a meal in Heaven.

Bon appetit!"
