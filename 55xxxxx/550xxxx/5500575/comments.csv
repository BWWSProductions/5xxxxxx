,Four1Fool,2010-04-18T07:28Z,"Had to add one thing, not sure ppl will read before or not, but this release includes Memory Card files.  So if you are updating, you will be overwriting your own virtual PS2 Memory Card file."
,AZkiller7,2010-04-18T14:20Z,"@Four1Foul, yes, actually i intentionally added the MemC's, cause a lot of people complained about ""PS2 Memory card not found "" error during pre-bios screen"
,bloodrunner23,2010-05-23T06:00Z,"ok im a bit of a noob at a ps2 emulator, i downloaded this got the thing running the bios work i mounted the elf thing but when i choose my kingdom hearts iso to play it suddenly says it stops working and closes the thing. can anyone help plz?"
,bobthebuilder1227,2010-07-10T00:05Z,"Great upload!nnAt first I kept getting this message:nnWhen I do this I get this message:nn\""Failed to init XAudio2 engine. XA2 may not be available on your system. Ensure you have the lastest DirectX runtimes installed or use DirectX/WaveOut drivers instead. Error Details: (code 0x90040154)nnUnknown error code!\""nnBut if you go into audio and change the Plugin Output Module, it should work depending on which one is compatible with your computer.nnOnce again, THANKS! Keep up the good work!"
,bobthebuilder1227,2010-07-10T06:37Z,"After playing with this for a while, I also kept getting the \""\""CDVD plugin  failed  to open. Your computer may have insufficient resources, or incompatible hardware/drivers\"" error. For those of you who go this, the most common cause of this problem is the file is incomplete/damaged or you are using the file. Do not mount CDVDs to virtual drives and try to play the ISO as they won\'t work. Make sure the file is not being used by anything and then load the CDVD with the iso loader option selected. Another minor note: If you go to the CDVD tab at the top and select the \""Skip Bios Hack\"" you will skip the pre-load junk at the beginning like the PS2 logo."
,bobthebuilder1227,2010-07-10T07:55Z,"Sorry to keep commenting, I just keep finding little things. If you are seeding a game, that is also a probable cause of the \""Failed to init XAudio2 engine. XA2 may not be available on your system. Ensure you have the lastest DirectX runtimes installed or use DirectX/WaveOut drivers instead. Error Details: (code 0x90040154)nnUnknown error code!\"" message. To remedy this, just remove and delete the torrent. Although you have to do this, consider seeding the games while you are not playing them to make everyone happy!"
