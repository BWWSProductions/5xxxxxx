NOTE: If you have no problems with "official" releases, DO NOT download this. That's why it has been tagged as iNTERNAL. However, you can read my day old conversation where this was announced and explained. These are just my responses yesterday:

As I said earlier, chaos in/between Scene-groups continues.
1st., IMMERSE have released badly screwed 720p of ep.13 - they've forgotten to decimate 29.97 fps in 23.976 and before anyone have nuked their release issued a ... (LOL) "REPACK" (what is most ridiculous). Of course, IMMERSE is "famous" by low quality and decent number of screw-ups. Remember - 720p groups have not suffered in the past of some "troubles" typical for XviD Scene-part.

 twentyforty at 2010-04-21 11:27 CET: 

OK? Two releases so far - and I HAVE dowloaded... both. After short skimming, I have decided not to re-encode any of these two, but to encode from crappy XviD one unplanned [quark]. That way I helped to many on slow connections and gave a chance and time to groups to finally release a decent 720p. DIMENSION has done proper - and even if we can (and should) expect something like REAL PROPER ('cause DIM has cut-out prematurely last 10-12 frames containing a sign "Lost" as proper ending) I get full of it and have encoded last one, a DIM's 720p.
Look what they have been said about PROPER (in NFO):
"The One Click Wonder Kiddies have a glitch/video freeze at 1325 and from that point through the end their audio has constant clipping and random distortion. Sample included."

 twentyforty at 2010-04-21 11:27 CET: 

"Kiddies" are - IMMERSE... LOL. "

And - DIMENSION's PROPER have four groups of skipped frames (4,3,3,3) AND there was no proper ending (not to mention credits - and groups are obliged to do that). So... PROPER is NOT proper at all, but intended as "message" to IMMERSE.
