[V],twentyforty,2010-04-22T11:54Z,@GoodFilms: Watch your language.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-22T12:00Z,"@hkoraddi: hkoraddi, there is nothing to explain. I announced yesterday REAL.PROPER and gave the reason. About terminology (REAL, INTERNAL, PROPER...et.c.) both you and VIP-punk can read on like zillion Internet pages."
,lover2040,2010-04-22T12:26Z,thanks dude...was looking forward for this..!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-22T13:29Z,"@lover: Yesterday, I was bombarded (chat and e-mails) with questions like ""What happened at the end?"" or ""Is something after the last black-screen?"" No, episode ended - I said in my responses.

Look, it really makes me sick - not the errors in encodings, but the stupid dispute ""Who is smarter"" and ""Who has bigger"".

Yesterday, for example - 3 x 720p releases, 3 x 1.09 Giga (and mouth-loud VIP guy presumably nave upped all of them and that way accomplished burning of few terabytes and more than few bucks of downloaders) - and all three with errors. It shouldn't be like that.

As you know - I do cut-outs of credits in all of my encodings. If someone wants to see who has been mic-holder, for sure he should pay a visit to cinema and not to expect that from pirated encoding. It is - stupid.

However - none of the episodes or movies should end in normal fade-out sequence. NEVER black frames if some kind of ""the end"" sign haven't appeared before. It really looks like plain fade-out which is normal and usual in any production/editing as transitional effect - between for example, two scenes or two continued sequences.
Anything else is just adding to confusion and - irresponsibility, lately typical for both the Scene and the consumers/uploaders/downloaders."
,hkoraddi,2010-04-22T13:37Z,sorry hope u have mistaken me i dont have any problem with anything its always THE best man.just all the 3 internal real n proper together i got confused..sorry if i made something wrong.

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-22T14:03Z,"@hkoraddi: Listen, I have just directed you to learn more, nothing else. I know you, and WE never have any problems. Therefore, I think that you misunderstood me, and - none and - whatsoever any hard words have been written  to you."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-22T14:50Z,"@hkoraddi: I can encde The.Drawn.Together.Movie, I have it, but I don't know when. Probably till Sunday (I am full today and tomorrow is mad-house anyway). But, I promise. As 272p, OK?"
