The Cutter And The Clan is the fifth album by Scottish Celtic rock band Runrig. It was the band's breakthrough album, taking them from cottage industry to the international stage. Originally recorded on the bandâ€™s own Ridge label, it was taken on board by Chrysalis Records as part of a 1987 major recording contract. Highlights include the song An Ubhal As Airde, which was later to become the first and only Scottish Gaelic language song to reach the UK Top 20, reaching #18 in 1997.
