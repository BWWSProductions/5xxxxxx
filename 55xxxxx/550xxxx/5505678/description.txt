While passing through the backwater burg of Flesh, Texas, Donna Parker (Eleni C. Krimitsos) suddenly finds herself propelled into a nightmarish world when her daughter, Tabitha (Jada Kline), disappears from a filling station. After seeking help from the less-than-obliging town sheriff (Dale Denton), Donna goes looking for Tabitha -- a pursuit that leads to the insane, inbred Barley clan in director Guy Crawford's blood-spattered tale of horror.
