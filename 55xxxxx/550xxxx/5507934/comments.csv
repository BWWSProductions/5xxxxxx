,Lucky13s,2010-04-22T08:05Z,"This episode totalyl pissed me off with all the bleeped muhammad crap and sensorship and that annoying 2 minutes of bleeping as the kids explain about what they learnt about muhammad, but the veeerry end... is so fucking epic, I couldnt stop laughing, it so ridiculously retarded, but I lol'ed so hard."
,Fast Glass,2010-04-22T08:07Z,Thanks.
,LtCmdLore,2010-04-22T10:36Z,"OK so since this particular episode is not available on the official south park website due to muslim weirdness, I decided to see if it was available on pirate bay... and lo and behold EZTV uploads south park as well.

I get my House, Lost and now south park from you. I figured 'what are the odds this eztv guy would upload all my favorite shows'

Then I checked your list of uploads and HOLY CRAP! YOU UPLOAD EVERY FREAKING SHOW ON THE PLANET!
There must be like a small country working for this eztv character."

,hart37,2010-04-22T15:20Z,Funny as hell this epsode because of it's insanity. The censorship thing can be annoying but I found it hilarious. Cheers EZTV great up as always
,iwash,2010-04-22T15:51Z,What's with the super long beeps at the end? Are they intentional or is the network so fucking lame?
,leprechaun25,2010-04-22T17:41Z,^the network did it because they are afraid of muslim whackos. It's too bad the peaceful muslims dont' take a stand against all the nutjobs in their religion.

,lennysglue,2010-04-22T19:16Z,Thanks!
,dank_nug,2010-04-22T19:55Z,"this muslim issue is so annoying and aggravating. Every religious person is sensitive to their own religion, so this special treatment towards islam is bulllshit. the peaceful people over there cant stand up to the violent ones because theyre violent. There are religious extremists in the states of course, but not in such a widespread and organized manner. As always, eztv's got it. Thanks again"
,tanujroy,2010-04-22T20:03Z,Thanks man u rule
,Lemberg,2010-04-22T22:40Z,"Yes, sadly most people would be more interested in who Cartman's father is than in the Mohammed storyline. That says a lot about our intelligence. Swallow, come.

Surely the ending wasn't bleeped because of the networks. The South Park episodes are made in less than a week, and they usually send them to the networks one or a few days before they are to air. So the networks may not always be prepared for something 'very shocking' and may not even realize that it was 'very shocking' until ignorant persons have made big deals about and over nothing. So the networks probably heard from some scare spreading media source that they now have 6.900.000.000 death threats if they don't censor those dangerous pixels or tiny lights showing animated colors. I would think Stone and Parker are informed ahead of time if something is to be censored, but I'm not sure. If they had been this time they probably said 'ok, but only if you'll also censor all the speeches at the ending'. There might not even have been dialogue written for that scene. Maybe they were just counting on the censorship from the networks and decided to answer back this way, pointing out the ridiculousness in outbeeping to everyone once and for all... (yeah, right). They might even have been surprised that the first episode wasn't censored.
Or maybe they made a deal with the networks that they could only censor one of the two episodes and so the networks chose the second episode in hope that a lot of people wouldn't see the first episode, rather than censoring the first episode to make people curious and interested thus build up a wider audience for the thrilling conclusion of the 200th 'censored South Park episode', in which uncensored Mohammeds would be like a punchline to last week's riddle so to speak, which would then, to highly sensitive people, appear to be a 'distasteful joke'. Buuut anyway, there's nothing for me to make a point about.

SPOILER ALERT FOR OVERLY SENSITIVE SENSITIVIANS: Just go ahead and enjoy the sweet notes of Barbra Streisand. Sounds like a feedback-ridden distorted guitar mixed with a slowed down burp. Nice notes after ""I still miss you at neeight-eh""."
,colt45joe,2010-04-22T23:09Z,"turns out that matt and trey were threatened by some muslim extremists, and so that is why they censored the episode.

,utterr18,2010-04-23T00:39Z,Trey Parker and Matt Stone didn't bleep out anything. Comedy Central censored everything because they got a threat from a New York muslim group called Revolution Muslim and they had sent death threats to Stone and Parker. Bc of this the studio decided to censor everything. Parker and Stone didn't even know about it till it aired. Also their not showing it online either and all of the repeats that were supposed to happen got cancelled and instead their showing old episodes. 
,br3zn3v,2010-04-23T00:43Z,"Parker & Stone made an announcement saying that the beeping was entirely CC's work and denied the rumours about the whole thing being a ""Not Without My Anus"" style joke. I guess this pretty much settles the joke/censorship debate for now. CC should be ashamed of themselves and the executives who ordered the beeping should be fed their own shit and thrown to the pigs. Fuck the cowards."
,SystemFolder,2010-04-23T04:52Z,"Here's the truth. The following was quoted from this page:
http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/3878

Posted on: 04.22.10
A Statement from Matt and Trey
In the 14 years we've been doing South Park we have never done a show that we couldn't stand behind. We delivered our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn't some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn't mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We'll be back next week with a whole new show about something completely different and we'll see what happens to it."
,Ronbert,2010-04-23T05:41Z,"All I can say is stay strong Matt and Trey, the south park community is behind you 100%. What a fucking classic scenario... make fun of us and we'll kill you. This country and the media in general in a majority of the world is based on the idea and exchange of free speech and ideals, I find it sad that out of all the issues islam is facing they chose to single out a CARTOON as a threat."
,Piddyx,2010-04-23T06:06Z,God Damn Ginger extremist keeping us from watching this video.
,DaNtsu,2010-04-23T12:36Z,"This is uncensored... It is meant to be like this, as a part of a joke.
Great episode, once again, thanks for the up !"
,DaNtsu,2010-04-23T12:41Z,"^oops I take that back, seemingly its comedy central that has cencored it"
,Dfewer,2010-04-23T12:47Z,Wow this feels like southpark has gone through a significant change.  The complexity and epic scale make me wonder if these two eps are outliers or if they are changing the basic structure of the show. I guess we'll see next ep.
,mrpras,2010-04-23T12:59Z,"Agreed, go on Matt and Trey.. Keep saying the stuff no-one else has the guts to say.. Always a good story and conclusion around some heavy topics (not always) but sometimes it's just profound.. Great work! (as if you guys actually read the comments on TPB lol)"
,mrpras,2010-04-23T13:00Z,oh and thanks guys.. Downloaded this in 50 seconds!
,RusBOOM,2010-04-23T13:51Z,"Thanks man, i needed this. fucking comedycentral added some bullshit bleeps so matt n' tray cant upload the episode to the official site."
,Mr.BumBum,2010-04-23T17:40Z,lol do all of you make fun of your prophet?? the producer just wanna attract more ppl to watch his/her program coz he's drain out of idea...
,Mr.BumBum,2010-04-23T17:43Z,no wonder its episode 200. 
,GenyrusSeedeR,2010-04-23T17:45Z,Seed or I'll harvest your inner goo.
,GenyrusSeedeR,2010-04-23T18:57Z,"Not sure if this censor thing is a ruse by Matt and Trey or not. I find it hard to believe that Comedy Central would censor the word ""Muhammed"". That is just poking the bear, if you ask me. And with all the money that South Park brings Comedy Central, I'd think they would be more careful.

About the torrent: quick download, good quality, and FUNNY AS HELL! 

Mitch Conner is the shit."

,ch3m1cal47,2010-04-25T03:26Z,"This episode is a FAIL!!! so boring and not even close to being original, they ran out of ideas and used all old story lines and used the whole muslim thing to cause a controversy to get attention, what happened to south park? i guess this is what happens when fags wright cartoons, they dont know what to do after all the gay jokes get old :("

Maybe not, but you certainly know arabic numbers (1, 2, 3...) and I'm sure you're using them ;], perhaps you are learning Algebra and this science is founded by Al-Khawarizmi (muslim), your computer use Algoritms to resolve anything which are founded by Al-Khawarizmi himself. You've certainly studied the famous formula of Al-Khashi c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos A and he is muslim.
Yeah as you can clearly see, plenty of stuff were done by arabs/muslims/backward country but you wouldn't know them if you don't go to sckool ;)"

,xiphone,2010-04-26T06:55Z,"One can smear any form of ideology by showing what people do with it. For example communism is evil, capitalism is evil(corporates), democracy is evil(spread with gun in iraq), secularism is evil (Brit was secular when it colonized, Saddam was secular. Basically any ideology can be called evil for what its follower do.

People should understand that there are different sensitivities in religion, culture. In some culture talking back to elderlies is wrong but in our culture its not as much of an offense.
Right now our country is blowing up two Muslim countries with cluster bombs, carpet bombs, phosphorus bombs killing over millions directly or indirectly. On top of that Muslims have to keep up with this kind of smearing who are trying just get by with their life. Most of them keep their mouth shut in their country so that the radicals or their dictator government we PLACED wont make them disappear. Its very easy to smear others being in front of a thousand dollar computer with super fast internet and McDonald's burger to eat. Please try to understand it from a different perspective it will change the way you look into the world. "

At the time, Islamic regions were actually more accepting of Judaism and Christianity than most of the Christian world was of Judaism and other types of Christianity. Long before the Italian Renaissance, the Islamic Empire realized the Greeks and Romans had been on to something with this book learning stuff, and used this realization to revolutionize astronomy, literature, physics, philosophy and architecture. Still bored, they went ahead and invented algebra and modern medicine too."".... then came Al Wahab aka Wahabiism, and you guys know the rest... you know, boom, bang, crash, heads roll and other shit...
