"Beef" 

After a young woman is sexually assaulted and murdered, 
Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Eliot 
Stabler (Chris Meloni) track down the woman's boyfriend
- their first suspect - but learn that he is a devout 
vegan who wouldn't hurt a fly. They soon find that the 
victim had been deeply involved in the fight to expose 
questionable practices in the meat-packing industry, 
even going undercover at a large company to find out 
the truth. Benson goes undercover herself to retrace 
the woman's footsteps and to identify who the victim 
might have angered along the way.

Enjoy :)
