Rx Notes
-----------------
Video Source: R5 DVD9-ELEKTRIK4KA [THANKS!]
Audio Source: Our Own UNCUT UNMARKED LiNE.

Video: Sharpened, colors, contrast, denoise, etc..
Audio: Uncut unmarked raw LiNE audio. Synced, added STUDiO/retail bass, filtered better, and fixed all clipped peaks(aka removed all crackles).

Yes, we know there is a few releases out there with our audio already. However, they all used the cut up LiNE from our TS. Sorry for the delay, but we wanted to get the audio just right. That and our SYNCER decided to take a break and get laid for a few hours... what are ya gonna do? Anyways, we hope you all ENJOY, and we have a ton of great LiNE just waiting for decent video. =]
