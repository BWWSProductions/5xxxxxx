Just wondering if you have a better copy of ""Zero Six Vol 1"" from the first manga collection.  It seems to be missing half the book.

Thanks"

I downloaded the original from www.bakabt.com, which is a private torrent site (have to sign up to be able to download.)  I just redownloaded it, and it has the same problem."
