All 15 episodes of Firefly encoded from DVD for the iPod as X264/AAC MP4's. Episodes are 480x320 pixels, as that is the exact resolution of the iPod Touch's Screen. The aspect of the source is 16:9or1.78:1 and the iPod's screen resolution is 3:2or1.5:1. These encodes have no black bars, but some cropping from the sides to fit. All the episodes have been tested and work great on my brothers Ipod Touch. My brother is picky, and it took some work to get them just right, so Enjoy! 


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

Firefly is an American space western television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, under his Mutant Enemy Productions. Its future setting, modeled after traditional Western movie motifs, has been praised as an "oddball genre mix". Whedon served as executive producer, along with Tim Minear.

The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a "Firefly-class" spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon pitched the show as "nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things". The show explores the lives of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war who now make a living on the outskirts of the society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In addition, it is a future where the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures as well. According to Whedon's vision, "nothing will change in the future: technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today."
