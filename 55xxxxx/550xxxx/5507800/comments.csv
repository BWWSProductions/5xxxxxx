Oh yeah the suggestion, list which disc your putting up. Family Guy volume 1 disc 1. 
Makes it a little easier for people and if you notice the first volume has two seasons to it.  "
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-22T02:16Z,"Hey there, Thank you for the comment. I am going to be uploading all 7 seasons. I also didn't label the disk as this is the only season that has 1 disk. I will rename it though so it will stay true with the other uploads. Thanks for the suggestion:)"
[T],Magash,2010-04-22T05:28Z,"You know I was thinking just that (season one is on only one disc) just as I hit the submit button. Since your gonna put up all 7 volumes I'll focus on movies or move over to the American Dad collections. 
I put my torrents up exactly the same way you do so if ya wanna start at volume 3 disc 3 that is where I left off at. I put these up pretty recently so it wouldn't be like your starting up in a strange spot and I'm gonna put in my comments that you are pretty much taking over. "
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-22T06:12Z,Well actually dude if you wanna continue that's cool. I can finish working on my south park uploads lol. You already have a ton of the family guy so you should finish it up. I'll keep trucking with my south park stuff.
[T],Magash,2010-04-22T06:53Z,"No problem. 
I'll start more Family Guy later tonight or tomorrow. "
