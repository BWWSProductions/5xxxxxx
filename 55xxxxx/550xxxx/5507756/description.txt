Reviews:

'A must ... for school and departmental libraries, and perhaps inexpensive enough for students to buy their own copy.' - JACT Review

'A most accessible entry point into the tales of Greek and Roman mythology' - Parikiaki






The Greek and Roman myths are an indelible, indispensable, inescapable part of our
cultural background and heritage. They originated not according to some single, all-explaining
patternâ€”as is often sweepingly arguedâ€”but in a wide variety of different ways and in response to a great many different social and pyschological needs.

Grant and Hazel have provided a finely grained and authoritative dictionary-style reference that is quite handy for identification of any figure from classical mythology. The book will prove useful for keeping at one's side when reading Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, Euripides and company. Very helpful appendices include genealogical trees, alphabetical list of classical authors referred to, and clear and informative maps.
