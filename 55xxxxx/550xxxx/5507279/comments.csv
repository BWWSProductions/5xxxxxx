Thank you for telling me to keep seeding, 
I wouldn't have known if you don't say so."

Much better video quality than the aXXo release but for some reason the audio sounds a bit off, annoys me when watching. Still good though."

 If the original Audio (from DVD)
AC-3, Constant, 448 Kbps, 6 channels, 48 KHz
is not good to you go back to your 700 MB avi-s with 128 KB/s mp3 audio torrents.
All my dvd rips have the original unconverted audio tracks. If you buy a dvd take it back to the store and tell them that you hate the 448 KB/s AC3 audio and want your money back. Let's see what they will say. 
You may need an Otologist, mate."

,zethaaron,2011-02-19T06:20Z,"It's worth mentioning that when the audio is 6 channel surround sound, if you listen to it in stereo it comes out kind of worse, like taking a camera into a movie theatre, the speakers all get down mixed to stereo when they should be surround. sucks but, at the same time, if you ever get a surround sound hookup it'll be great. :P"
,fedepres,2011-05-14T08:33Z,Thank you :)
,Kobie714,2011-05-18T04:50Z,"While this is decent quality, its resolution (368p) is much too low for its file size. For instance, another torrent on here which is 436p is only 1.37 GB in size. For its size, this torrent should be more like approaching 720p. Thus, I do not recommend this torrent and suggest people stop seeding it."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-12T15:52Z,"Display AR is 866p x 368px (2.35:1 anamorphic)
866/368=2.35 as on imdb

The snap shots from description were taken with MPC, sadly I forgot that it is anamorphic and MPC snaps the squeezed image like on dvd.

I agree that it could be made 1.5 GB, but I liked the pic q so much that I didn't want any loss of quality so I exagerated a bit. Still it is over 3 times smaller then the dvd (7 GB).

436 pixels high is wrong, either didn't crop the black bars properly or made a messy AR God knows how. Why don't we see a snap shot of that encode?

In the other hand Zen_Bud who uploaded that 1.3 GB most likely weird AR crap is uploads a lot of low quality superficially RE-encoded rips in rush.

Finally Seeders:    21, Leechers:    5 says it all.
(after a year from uploaded date) 
Thx to all for seeding."
