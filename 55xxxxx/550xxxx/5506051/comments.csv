,ImperiumA,2010-04-22T00:50Z,Quality is a little lower?! This is just another transcode from the 128 k webrip. Lame.
[T],djsforfun,2010-04-22T02:00Z,"this is the unmastered advance indeed. and if you didnt notice, i posted here first than the 128kbps thats floating the web u are talking about.

enjoy!

[T],djsforfun,2010-04-22T02:03Z,"and btw, when i post rips from the web i tag them WEB as u can see at djsforfun tag. we on the other hand provide releases with the highest quality standards...

if they are unmastered, web or retail we tag them properly.

enjoy!"
