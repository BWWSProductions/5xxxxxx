Way to go fuckers. I hope a zombie fucks you anally in hell until you learn how to share"

,iLLiNoiZBoi,2010-05-14T03:25Z,"VIRUS, i downloaded this torrent, one of thousands i have downloaded...however, this specific torrent is a piece of FUCKING SHIT. do not download it unless you want to open the folder that contains the mkv file and have your computer tell you ""windows stopped working"" EVERYTIME you open that folder. heaven forbid you move that file to your desktop preventing you from using anything on your desktop or deleting the file causing the problem. using task manager to end the process does nothing either, it immediately restarts before you can do anything. everyone that reads this...WHIP OUT YOUR COCKS, AND SHOVE THEM DOWN THIS FAGGOT ASS UPLOADERS THROAT CHOKING HIM TO DEATH. even tho he will probably enjoy it."
,iLLiNoiZBoi,2010-05-14T03:27Z,PLEASE BAN THIS PUSSY'S ACCOUNT AND EVERYONE HE STARTS HEREAFTER!
