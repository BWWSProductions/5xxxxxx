Warning: before using any utility to move partitions on a hard drive, always have a full backup of the entire disk before beginning. I have lost a partition using Drive Genius 2, and had a resized partition come up as read-only using VolumeWorks. Both problems were recoverable without erasing the whole disk, but if I hadn't had a backup, I'd have lost data in the first instance. Be extra careful with utilities of this kind!

*******************************

iPartition has been such a pain in the ass to obtain here on TPB, that I thought I'd upload this alternative from SubRosaSoft. It probably ain't got all the bells and whistles of iPartition, but I tried it recently, and it did the job for me.


I just stripped this out of a larger torrent:

So, credit to purpl3. The app seems to be cracked because it works when removed from its disk image.
