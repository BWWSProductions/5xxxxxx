,JujitsuFreak,2010-07-13T00:27Z,"I\'ve been watching re-runs of the show on HGTV and from what I\'ve been able to find out, they\'ve only been airing seasons 5 and 6 with a little from 7, and then re-re-running them over and over, which sucks because I\'d like to see it from the beginning season: 1, 2, 3, etc. Any chance someone could get the earlier seasons uploaded?  I\'d be a gratuitous seeder in return - I am anyways, but this show is so educational and interesting I\'d be very enthused to seed."
