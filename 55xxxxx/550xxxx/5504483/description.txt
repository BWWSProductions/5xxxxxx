Plot: The Medieval and Renaissance blade, a profound and
beautiful object handcrafted by master artisans of old. An object
of great complexity, yet one with a singular use in mind- it is
designed to kill. The truth of the sword has been shrouded
in antiquity, and the Renaissance martial arts that brought it
to being are long forgotten. The ancient practitioners lent us
all they knew through their manuscripts. As gunslingers of the
Renaissance they were western heroes with swords, and they
lived and died by them. Yet today their history remains cloaked
under a shadow of legend.
