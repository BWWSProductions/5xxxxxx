Wouldn't have gotten them all otherwise."
,Freaky_Freddy,2010-04-27T16:50Z,Are all the episodes in dual audio?

""All episodes are dual audio with Japanese or English."""
,ro308,2010-08-19T07:49Z,"The english audio track doesn't seem to be working, and there are no subtitles for the japanese version..."
,ro308,2010-08-19T07:51Z,"Or at least, with the first series, that seems to be the case. Fumoffu seems to be okay though. :)"
,hendrikk,2010-08-25T15:14Z,"ok, the first season has no eng dub. so if you download this, and use VLC, you can find the ""English"" in the audio setings, but it will only disable the sound until episode 21. If you use ""Media Player Classic"" then you will have no sound at all (in my case) until episode 21."
,treasurebus,2010-09-07T01:00Z,"TSR is in both JPN and ENG, right? Just want to clarify (I know it says it, but--) Also can people please seed this? ;~; I'm hanging on to 4-5/14 right now and says it will finish in days. Thanks so much!"
,suprapro1,2011-08-08T16:23Z,"thnx uploader. JUST TO CLARIFY ALL EPISODES ARE DUAL AUDIO, S1 INCLUDED. ENGLISH AND JAPANESE. Use media player classic if u have problems."
