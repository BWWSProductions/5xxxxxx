[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-04-20T11:34Z,no problem plenty more games to come
,DikkatDeliVar,2010-04-20T14:32Z,"The crack inside is not for the 2.5 patch but for version 1 (both in the crack directory and in the image). 
However patches and cracks from version 2. to 2.3 can be found in gamecopyworld. Between 2.3 and 2.5 there are so few bug changes so that's no big deal. That's the best strategy game for WWII pacific, thanks a lot again :)"
,DikkatDeliVar,2010-04-20T15:09Z,"Can some admin delete my previous post please? 

After updating the game to 2.5, which comes together with djDEVs release, there is no need to crack the game)"
