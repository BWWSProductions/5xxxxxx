However, it seems to have about half a second of audio shifting. It happened to me with every player I tried: GOM, VLC and MP Classic.
Also, in GOM it got stuck every few minutes, and I had to skip back and forth to continue watching.
With MPC I could change the audio sync so it was fine.
Maybe it's just a problem with my codecs though."
