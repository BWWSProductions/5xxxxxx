But since I use my Mac I liked using computers again and had spend much more time on it than ever before on a PC. That is to say time using applications, not making the darn thing working properly again - the PC scenario... ;)
In that sense buying an app makes it more worth doing so.
Another thought of me is that one should pay equivalently for the amount of usage of an app, if that is just very occasionally, one should have not pay the full monty (e.g. the ridiculously high amount for PS). Because software producers do not think that way, we luckily have The Pirate Bay!"

Otherwise the keygen works for me."
