Very decent DVD ripper, the Compress function to make videos for your iPhone/iPod is a bit buggy I think. But the Rip function to get the full resolution on your harddrive works great. The included keygen (all credits to CORE!!) is a bit older but does the job for this most recent version, which is 1.4.2

You are not a big winner using this just 20 bucks worth of software, so if you feel you can afford it, pay them a visit:

Happy rippin'!
