,JackOfficer,2010-04-24T14:28Z,"i dont understand exactly what you mean by ""Uncensored! "" since the show is already uncensored. didnt you notice they curse and show nudity when the show airs on AMC?"
,JBiBBs5,2010-04-25T01:36Z,I put uncensored because it is uncensored.
,JBiBBs5,2010-04-25T03:54Z,These are the actual DVD rips. Not TV rips.
,lostspoil,2010-04-29T19:47Z,"uncensored or uncut maybe aka ""directors cut""...
means that there are scenes that haven't been seen on TV... has nothing to do with pixels and beeps"
,lostspoil,2010-04-29T19:47Z,and thx for the torrent!
,mufuti9,2010-05-04T15:16Z,"@JackOfficer:

The TV airings are occasionally cut.

Most of the time it is not really noticeable because they make clever use of sound effects to overlap cursing or simple remove the last audible silble so it will go unnoticed.

But sometimes it is more obvious (like lips reading a whole other word  or actually censoring nudity like in the season 1 premiere)


Thanks a lot for sharing!!"
,mufuti9,2010-05-04T15:17Z,"great quality too btw, I will share this one for a long time."
,umbrellas,2010-05-06T05:57Z,"Is not uncensored.
Episode 6 has some muted curses.
Oh well.
It's gotta be out there somewhere."

,Nightmeows,2010-06-07T05:54Z,Thank you
,bfishie,2010-06-13T23:40Z,Thank you so much for the upload! Works perfectly. Great Quality. Uncensored! I love this show!
,sonettiXXL,2010-08-09T19:02Z,"These episodes ain't uncencored.
See for example 06 Peekaboo @ 33m36s.

Nevertheless, thank you for sharing."
,umbrellas,2010-08-11T08:38Z,"Alright, just to clear everything up.
First off, thanks JBiBBs5 for this.

This IS uncensored. I just checked the discs out from the library and the ""fuck"" in episode 6 actually sounds like that. It's NOT censored. It is what it is. It has more to do with the writing and even more so with Bryan Cranston's acting in this scene. I suppose it's spoken like that to enhance its meaning. i.e. ""I want to scream this at the top of my lungs but we're in public"" kind of thing. It was jarring at first to hear. It does almost sound unnaturally silent.

Bottom line, this is a 100% genuine DVD rip of season 2. Thank you again, JBiBBs"
,baisn,2010-11-10T20:58Z,"Please seed. Been downloading this for 2 days now, and i am stuck at 50%. I will seed it in 3 ratio if i get it. "
,japhater,2011-09-28T13:43Z,"@jbibbs5 cheers man and @ every fool who watched 6 episodes no problem lol and than seen on scene were one word was a bit misunderstood and than ""THIS IS CENSORED"" seriously people cop on to yourselfs "
,killtrocity,2011-10-10T07:54Z,"On the Blu-ray version Walter clearly says ""fuck you"". I own the DVD and the Blu-ray editions cause I am a huge fucking fan of the series and I was delighted to discover that the ""fuck"" is clearly stated on the Blu-ray version. 

This is strange because the season 1 and 3 DVDs are uncensored (""What are you fucking nuts?"" - Tuco, ""I fucked Ted"", - Skylar) but the season 2 DVD is indeed censored"
