"So, You Want to be a Vampire"

Frank Grimes blackmails Mark into checking on his 
daughter's boyfriend, a vampire. Meanwhile, a 
plague of Mad Larry disease spreads across New 
York City, transforming hapless citizens into 
Larry King. And Mark forgets his and Callie's 
666th anniversary of their first sex in the 
bathroom, and Randall is left to pick up the 
pieces. 

Enjoy :)
