Why would you post exactly the same 2 questions on all the Nier release postings? All you have to do is do a bit of reading on some of the postings to know what you are asking. All what you are doing does is spread doubt, possibly dissuading some folks.... hmmmm"
,scotty35,2010-04-20T10:23Z,If info for the game is needed visit abgx.net
,yoyoyoy,2010-04-23T23:08Z,is this region free OR PAL / NTSC U please>?
[T],gamerguuy,2010-04-25T18:55Z,its region free.
,Tomskeet,2010-04-28T20:49Z,"I can confirm that it works on NTSC with no problems other than the fact that this game is complete garbage. If I could figure out how to make DVD-DL's with my own shit, I wouldn't even waste one of those on this game. A serious disgrace to gaming right here.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF SHIT OF A GAME!!!!"
,gh360,2010-05-21T10:01Z,"This is not RF, or not complete RF.  It's Pal, NTSCU like the FF13 release.  Won't work on NTSCJ."
,ojam1,2010-06-04T17:02Z,thin is not region free. this is NTSC-U
,zola2000,2011-06-15T18:47Z,"this game is good, but baybe too japanese for some people."
