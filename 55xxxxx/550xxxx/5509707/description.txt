PLOT
It begins with a former Fundamentalist from Texas, ousted from his provincial church for asking too many questions. â€œIf God wanted you to know about that, it would have been in the Bible,â€ he is told, â€œâ€”so stick to worrying about your own salvation.â€ But thatâ€™s not good enough for Edward T. Martin, and thus begins a seekerâ€™s quest across 4000 miles of India in search of answers about where Jesus was during the â€œHidden Yearsâ€ from ages 12 to 30. The New Testament is silent on those years, however in India there is an ancient tradition that young Jesus joined a caravan and took the Silk Road to the East, where He lived with both Hindus and Buddhists before returning to begin His ministry. To what extent are these traditions based on evidence, and why does the â€œPopeâ€ of Hinduism now insist that Jesus was in India? Why does Professor Elaine Pagels of Princeton University, a world-renowned Biblical scholar, say we cannot rule this out? Scholars and religious authorities are joined in this film by the Dalai Lama and an Apostolic Nuncio of Pope John Paul II. You will hear all sides, and you will be shocked and surprised by some of the answers offered for the Bibleâ€™s silence about JESUS IN INDIA.
