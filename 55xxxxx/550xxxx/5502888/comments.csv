A:3 V:1,5"
,corezz,2010-04-19T22:11Z,"Here's a REAL Review of the Quality:

A: 8/10
V: 5/10 -- However it is mostly because the camera shakes once in a while and the dude who recorded it sits a bit back so you see a bit more letterbox framing than ideal (it appears he did this so as to not cut off anything)...but the video image is very acceptable for viewing nontheless...If it werent for the shaky cam at times and the framing i'd give the video a 6/10

Overall, i think it is worth the download for anyone who is tired of crappy cams and just want to watch a viewable one right now."
