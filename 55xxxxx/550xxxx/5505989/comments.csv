,Glerikud,2010-04-21T13:40Z,Thanks the upload.
,xx21playerxx,2010-04-21T18:17Z,"No you can't :(
Different game ID"
,overgamer,2010-04-22T19:54Z,"I have problem, cant start the game, it freeze the Wii with a weird buzzing sound. Should I update something?"
,yano75,2010-04-22T20:49Z,"Yeah, same problem here: can't start the game.
It shows an error asking to eject the disc and to power off the Wii.

Bootmii + Darkcorp + Startpatch"
,overgamer,2010-04-22T22:14Z,"okay I find a way to make it work, although I get random freeze on the option menu sometimes.
Make sure you got the latest cIOS (55 for this game) also make sure you use the latest version of your loader. USB loader 929 works fine with me. Still need to find a way to get rid of menu freeze."
,yano75,2010-04-22T23:02Z,"I don't use a usb loader, I use the dvd rom.

I tried to start the game with NeoGamma R8 and it doesn't work either."
,overgamer,2010-04-23T00:10Z,"Nah you cant use Neogamma with that games, it requires the run using cIOS 223. Maybe you should try with Gecko OS 1.9.2"
,overgamer,2010-04-23T00:11Z,"http://www.wiihacks.com/wii-games/56335-monster-hunter-3-tri.html

you can find everything needed to make it work."
,yano75,2010-04-23T23:10Z,"Thanks overgamer, in fact it was my fault...
I didn't need Darkcorp and Bootmii since I've got a Wasabi modchip.

After having everything uninstalled, it works like a charm on my Wii with the Wasabi modchip.

Thank you very much Markuf!"
,sonic-hero,2010-04-25T13:51Z,thanks overgamer it works with uloader now

,serhat1412,2010-05-02T12:46Z,will not work !! the size is only 2.37GB and not 4.7GB: use this Torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5515643/Monster_Hunter_Tri_%5BPAL%5D%5BMulti5%5D%5BSpanish%5D%5BWii%5D%5Bwww.consolasatope  thanks ;) 
,typheous82,2010-05-27T21:25Z,"serhat1412: as markuf wrote. this file was passed thru wiiscrubber, meaning the extra 2.3 gb of blank filler is removed. when you extract this file it will be full image size and ready to burn. this is my 4th WiiSOS DL and each have worked flawlessly using USB loader GX."
,tetsuHaduken,2011-01-11T01:38Z,does this work on the wii emulator?
