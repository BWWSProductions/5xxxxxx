Plot: In a terrifying tale of the â€œAmerican Dreamâ€ gone wrong, four friends find themselves trapped in their hometown in â€œThe Crazies,â€ a reinvention of the George Romero classic. David Dutton is sheriff of Ogden Marsh, a picture-perfect American town with happy, law-abiding citizens. But one night, one of them comes to a school baseball game with a loaded shotgun, ready to kill. Another man burns down his house after locking his wife and young son in a closet inside. Something is infecting the citizens of Ogden Marshâ€¦with insanity. The few still sane find themselves trapped: Sheriff Dutton; his pregnant wife, Judy; Becca, an assistant at the medical center; and Russell, Duttonâ€™s deputy and right-hand man. Forced to band together, an ordinary night becomes a struggle for survival as they try to get out of town alive.
