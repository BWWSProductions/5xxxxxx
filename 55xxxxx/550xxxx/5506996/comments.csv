,robby71a,2010-04-22T10:30Z,I must have tried nearly everyone of these bloody torrents only to be disappointed and find that they do not work. Best of luck to those that can make it work. Sotted iffy at best.

,elect_86,2010-08-03T13:23Z,"Same problem of Silu, when i try to run the update 9, it starts searching but doenst find anything"
,defbond75,2010-12-02T21:34Z,"you guys need to read the .nfo files more carefully, if its searching for the game when applying update 9 it means you haven't copied the the empire.exe from the Razor1911 folder from update 8 hotfix..."
,Millerdis100,2011-01-12T15:58Z,"do i need any older updates like update 5and 6 from RazorDOX or i need just update 8 and 9 from this torrent?

And do i have to do original update 1.5 before razor updates or what?"
,SEASTARTkkk,2011-01-15T15:50Z,does it really work
,elect_86,2011-01-25T13:05Z,"@ defbond75

I copied both empire.txt and the folder in the game folder

I did the same for the update 8 and the hotfix and it worked...

Does it work for you?

Does it work for anyone else?"
,elect_86,2011-01-25T22:43Z,"I found the solution, before installing the update 9, be sure you install


MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 2005 RUNTIME LIBRARIES"
