,esharoth,2010-04-22T10:17Z,"I was asked on another tracker if this actually works. The answer is a definite yes - you don't need Steam to play the game, it has all the features of the original. If you like it, consider purchasing it to support the producer."
,Stlouiscowboys,2010-04-22T15:17Z,"If you have ever wanted a video game induced seizure, this is the game for you!  (And yes this is legit)"
,surecat,2010-04-22T23:59Z,"The game creates a file called ""gamesave4.sav""
but the things you cleared aren't there when you enter the game..."
,Rawulf12,2010-04-23T02:36Z,"Whenever I launch the game, it keeps on launching Steam to the purchase page of Beat Hazard. Why?"
,Stlouiscowboys,2010-04-23T03:56Z,"Rawulf, just got to the install directory and make a shortcut of the game from there.  It wont bring up steam, it will just start the game. "
,Rawulf12,2010-04-23T04:52Z,^ thanks a bunch
,esharoth,2010-04-25T02:09Z,You can apply a fix to enable savegames: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5513531
,brettv,2010-05-02T01:02Z,"Mine also tries to run it through steam, I have created a shortcut to the program, and it still does it, and if I have steam closed it says:

Steam Client Unavailable
This game can only be played with the Steam Client running
Please run Steam and try again


Any help?"
,brettv,2010-05-02T01:37Z,"Well it works without the fix, but then when I apply the fix I get that error."

,adventurjunky,2010-05-07T00:42Z,"Great fun,

,nachoking,2010-05-09T09:07Z,"I created a shortcut and all the usual, but it still won't start, just sends me to steam. Other than that game works fine, some cool (trippy) visuals"

,sherwelbuilding,2010-05-10T17:11Z,"I want to buy this, why won't my credit card work, why am I forced to pirate this? :'-("
,sherwelbuilding,2010-05-10T17:47Z,"NEVERMIND, MY CARD WORKS AGAIN. YES!"
,Aevis,2010-05-11T11:40Z,For those who are having problem with the game running through steam... Just open the game from the folder. It worked for me.
,kf4cs9,2010-05-11T20:28Z,"First off - thanks for the amazing rip of this game. I wanted to play more of my own songs than the 10 that it let me and I wanted to try out the survival mode. Was totally worth the ten dollars. :)

Also, at the risk of sounding like an idiot, a friend of mine is on OSX - is there any chance that there will be a Macintosh rip of this game any time soon? Steam IS on OSX now isn't it? Hope to see a rip soon! :)"

It keeps saying that CPY has done so and so... at the bottom of the screen in the RSS bar...

Annoying, but still a crazy game!! AWESOME!"
,esharoth,2010-05-20T21:34Z,"You can't modify that. They're the guys that made the crack, the only way you could use your own name is by modifying their crack or making your own, from scratch."
,R0CKLOBSTER,2010-06-07T09:56Z,"BEST SEIZURE EVAR!
