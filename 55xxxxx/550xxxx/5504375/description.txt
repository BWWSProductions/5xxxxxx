The Adventures of Tintin â€“ The Calculus Affair

"No more travels or adventures; no more careering all round the world. I've had enough of it!" says Captain Haddock. But danger threatens; unscrupulous Bordurians kidnap Professor Calculus, and Tintin, Snowy and the Captain are soon on the trail again. It is no easy task to rescue the Professor and save his fantastic invention. Spies are everywhere, and Calculus lies deep in the fortress of Bakhine. But the Bordurians have Tintin to deal with.
