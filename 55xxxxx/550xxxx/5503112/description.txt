        Frank Quinlan and Huey Driscoll, two reporters from a  Chicago
        -based tabloid, along with Dorothy Winters, an 'angel expert',
        are asked to travel to rural Iowa to investigate a claim  from
        an  old woman  that she  shares her  house with  a real,  live
        archangel  named  Michael.  Upon arrival,  they  see  that her
        claims are true  - but Michael  is not what  they expected: he
        smokes, drinks beer, has a very active libido and has a rather
        colourful vocabulary.  In fact,  they would  never believe  it
        were it  not for  the two  feathery wings  protruding from his
        back. Michael agrees to travel to Chicago with the  threesome,
        but what they don't realise is that the journey they are about
        to undertake will change their lives forever.
