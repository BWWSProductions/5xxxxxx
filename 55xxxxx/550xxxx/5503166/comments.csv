,Dream_Phreak,2010-06-08T18:22Z,"No offense, but i think this is the wrong video. Watching the beginning, it seems like one of the early videos from season one. The guy barely buys the RV in this torrent.

In your screenshots, even there its the same, in the 2nd picture, the friend says he can get the guy an RV for super cheap, and right after that they go to buy it. "
,Dream_Phreak,2010-06-08T19:04Z,"Yup, this IS the wrong video. The guy in screenshot 2 is already dead. He died when the kid on the bike shot him, remember? 

Cant believe i wasted 10 minutes of my time to download this rofl. "
,kludge420,2010-06-17T12:59Z,"It's the right video. Just watch the ""Previously On"" section. Then watch it for more than a minute. It was annoying that they used an old scene but it was to set up the next scene."
