,fag69,2010-04-23T22:43Z,Why is the show's opening sequence not always included? Today was perfect!
[V],mothergoose56,2010-04-23T23:22Z,The show's opening sequence was dropped BY THE SHOW. Something about Sirius complaining about the music they were playing so apparently Ron decided just to drop it. What you hear is what airs live. When they come up shorter it's because they play bits during the breaks sometimes - but what airs live is what is here.
