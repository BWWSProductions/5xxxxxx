Hypnosis for Health - Hypnosis is the easiest way to affect change in your life. By using NLP techniques you can learn to motivate yourself to take care of your own health; for example to stop smoking, nail biting, stress, insomnia and weight loss.

NLP can provide techniques to influence negative thinking and behaviour, such as self-critical internal dialogue and negative beliefs, leading to positive long-term lifestyle changes. You will learn how to communicate with your body using excellent techniques so you can affect the changes you want and have the health you desire.  Understanding how your body works with your unconscious mind is the key to great health.

All you have to do is listen to the CD at night as you go to sleep.  You'll hear soft music and gentle sounds with the empowering voice of Benjamin Bonetti.
