Are you letting it out to their website?  It's possible that it is doing a verification if you are connected and letting it get out.  That's the only way I Know if it works for some and not others- using the same install file.  Try getting rid of everything from previous attempts, and reinstalling w/out letting it connect to their ws. "

1st key worked fine for me, those having probs, Diconnect from internet before loading prog, add key when prompted. once activated check settings, un-tick any box that sends info back to VSO also the update option, re-connect to internet. A small amount of messing around for a great prog and download, BIG THANKS DeGun"
