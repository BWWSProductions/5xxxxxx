The albums the Buzzcocks made after getting back together have been great, except for one thing: too many Steve Diggle songs!  He's not terrible, but his work doesn't come anywhere close to Pete Shelley's many catchy numbers about his lousy love life.  Listening to these albums is like listening to Led Zepplin II with a few Nickleback songs thrown in.

So I have stripped out the Diggle songs from Trade Test Transmissions, All Set, Modern, Buzzcocks, and Flat-Pack Philosophy to create a better listening experience.  For me, anyways -- I hope a few others will enjoy not having to keep one finger on the 'next track' button when listening to these songs.
