From Wiki:


FrÅzen GhÅst was a Canadian rock band formed in 1985 by Arnold Lanni and Wolf Hassel who were previously with the band Sheriff. The band received a Juno Award for "Most Promising Group of the Year" in 1987.

"Should I See", an anti-censorship song, became a minor hit in the United States, reaching 69th position on Billboard's Hot 100 singles in 1987. The video for that song was also nominated at the 1987 Juno Awards for "Best Video of the Year".

On their first two albums, FrÅzen GhÅst and Nice Place to Visit, the band were originally a studio duo. Arnold Lanni sang lead vocals, and played all the guitar and keyboard parts, and is credited as being the sole songwriter, while Wolf Hassel played bass. Their first two albums featured guest musicians, such as Derry Grehan, lead guitarist of Honeymoon Suite. The drums, however, were sequenced on a computer rather than being played by a human drummer. While Lanni may have programmed the drums himself, the actual programmer is uncredited and unknown.[citation needed] On their final album, Shake Your Spirit there were two official additions to the band: John Bouvette, who was on drums and percussion, and Phil X who played the guitar and did some vocals. Phil X was also credited on the album Nice Place to Visit for being a guitarist, but was not considered an official band member until the final album was released.

For unknown reasons, on FrÅzen GhÅst's second album their name changed from FrÅzen GhÅst to Frozen Ghost, although on the third album the artist name returned to its original spelling.

FrÅzen GhÅst disbanded in 1993, following their final album Shake Your Spirit. Lanni would go on to become a successful producer for acts such as Our Lady Peace, Finger Eleven and Thousand Foot Krutch.
