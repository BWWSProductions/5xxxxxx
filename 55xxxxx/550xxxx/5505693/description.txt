When a boxer turned restaurateur (Michael Clarke Duncan) announces a contest to his waitstaff, the good news is that the winner will get a $10,000 bonus. The bad news? The loser will be on the receiving end of a heavy-duty smack-down at the hands of the champ himself. Director Kevin Heffernan co-stars alongside fellow Broken Lizard comedy vets Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, Erik Stolhanske and Jay Chandrasekhar.
