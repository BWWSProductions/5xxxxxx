Are you insane, of course they aren't. They are in direct relation to mbs. I can only download a certain amount a month, and for this reason will only be downloading quarks from you from now on. I will seed quarks over 1:1 because the size is so small I can afford to. The name of the game for users like me who have a download limit, is to save as much bandwidth as possible.  As far as movies are concerned, I will not download from you anymore because what would be the point? I download a 350mb movie from you and am REQUIRED to at least seed 1:1 totalling over 700mb. I'd rather hit and run a heavily seeded torrent elsewhere that is 700mb and the quality would be greater or find a mkv at a lesser file size, which totally negates the purpose of downloading from you in the 1st place. (it sounds bad but somebody's got to keep it real) You're right the internet is a big place, meaning there's always somewhere else to find the same thing. You do amazing work on the quarks, they are perfect for animation shows.....got to respect the passion you have though so 2 thumbs up."
