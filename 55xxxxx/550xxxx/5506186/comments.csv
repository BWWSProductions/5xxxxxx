,jadawgkss,2010-04-22T08:04Z,"TPB HOW COME ITS SO HARD TO COMMENT! I COULDN'T FIND LOGIN FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES- 

Anyhoo, to those thinking you need a serial, you are wrong. After you get over the hump of having the game running you'll wonder:

How do I save the game
1. Start the game.
2. In the menu, press a key Home.
3. On top is lowered window, Press ""Create a new profile.
4. Now we choose, to create autonomous profile.
5. Enter any name in English. and click Send.
6. Now click Finish. You can pre-configure your profile if you wish.

This is correct, but when you click create new profile, you need to scroll down and then there is a link within the paragraph referencing a local profile. Click that, you're golden. Jesus- it took me literally 1.5 hours to figure it out."

I wanted to ask a question please. 
After I install both dvd's and before it finishes installation it wants to do a date check or something like that..connect to the internet is what it wants i'm guessing..
I removed the setup.exe through taskmanager, so should I let it do the date check >then copy the cracks over> then  run the reg> and then update? Do I really need the update?
Also is a registry hack really necessary or should I just run the reg EFLC install.reg which is fine?"

,onweazle,2011-02-20T10:57Z,"Thx for the amazing effort to upload this, but i cant gett it working. The game runs though, but only in minimum settings, Distance draw etc in lowest settings seemed to improve. The instructions on several uploads can help the people out with running this game. I used the 1.0.1 patch with crack, later the 1.0.2 . Also editted my reglocation for the exe. Game starts, intro etc. In the gang part it collapses instantly at intro, at Gay tony part it seems like the game is lagging when youre driving into a new part of the map and the pc wants to load it. Game freezes, after 20 secs working again. But if u drive 2 often into other parts it just freezes and makes pc reboot.
Dont think it has to do with this pack, just with the  game itself. If there will ever be a GTA6 they wont bring it for pc no more i think. "

I do however experience some flashing green ""stars"" in the beginning of the game, while it's dark. It might be my graphics card though, not sure. (I hope not, i got it a week ago) It stopped after a few minutes though, as it all it turned into daytime.

The only issue now is I CAN'T SAVE! How am i suppose to do that? It says i need to login to some crap that i don't have. Any help?"

Follow the steps and mount disc 2 when asked to, then mount disc 1 when asked to. 

Once finished update the game by mounting Disc 1 and going into the crack>update folder. You should update to 1.1.2.0 also to stop loading loops. To save just make an offline GFWL profile.

Note: I didn't activate the game via Rockstar's validation thing but my game reads that it's updated to 1.1.2.0. I just finished Chinese Takeout with no issues and running ENBv0.9."

,xpmule,2012-07-11T18:10Z,"if people want a good crack for this or regular gta iv click on my name to see my uploadeds. They are unique and made by me so you probably won't find them else where..

what they do is 2 main things..
crack the game so you can play with no
cd/dvd in the drive and so you can save your game and not have to use RGSC or Games For Windows Live
GFWL is what saves your games so if YOU DO use it ? you have to create an offline account.. hit the home key and search hard for the option, its hidden pretty good ;)
OR.
Download the xLiveless i modded and uploaded or google xliveless

and lastly the no dvd crack i patched and uploaded is Razor1911's crack that i patched to remove staup sounds and the Razor1911 logo from popping up every time you launch the game.

Also no matter where you get your files people.
DON'T EVER run eflc.exe or gtaiv.exe
all versions on the net will load the game but a securom piracy protection will get triggered and you will have  abunch of problems including your player acting like he is drunk (aka Drunk Camera bug)

hope this helps and have fun my fellow pirates :)
And yeah i bought the game but download the iso's anyway (with all gta games)"
