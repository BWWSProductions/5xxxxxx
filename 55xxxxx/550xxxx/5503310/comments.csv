,simonjpa,2010-04-20T01:14Z,"Hi thank for the video.

You can post in this video format, but I think you should include a player to read it for people that are not used to this format to not be angry at you.

They can download a software called KMPlayer at this link http://imgcdn.pandora.tv/pan_img/KMP/Download/kmp.exe.

I just opened the file without any problems.

I don't know how is the quality yet."
,simonjpa,2010-04-20T05:30Z,"The quality is very good. I would say 9/10.

There is no need to do it in avi, .mkv, or mp4.

Just download the software ""ginley2""."
,evaderum9,2010-04-20T06:08Z,tna has wwe rejects? do i have to list how many wwe wrestlers came from other promotions? youre either a fail troll or an ignorant jackass
