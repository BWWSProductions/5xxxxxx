Plot:
When Mumble is born into a colony of Emperor penguins, he finds himself unable to be accepted by all other penguins, lacking the ability to sing a heartsong - a mating song which all penguins can perform from an early age. He does however have a talent for tap dance which is derided by his peers and scorned by the penguin elders as displeasing to their deity. Mumble's gift of dance is blamed for the possible cause of their food shortage, which is in reality caused by nearby trawlers depleting local fish stocks. After being virtually outcast by his colony he goes in search of the humans in an attempt to reason and communicate with them. 

Trama:
In Antartide, tra i pinguini imperatore, non si Ã¨ nessuno se non si sa cantare. Una vera disgrazia per il piccolo Mambo, il peggior cantante del mondo, nato ballando il tip tap. Un giorno incontra un gruppo di gabbiani stercorari, uno dei quali ha un braccialetto giallo attaccato alla zampa che gli hanno attaccato gli alieni, cioÃ¨ gli umani.
