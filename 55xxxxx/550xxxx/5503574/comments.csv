,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2010-07-02T02:26Z,Any rips of this with hardcoded English subs?  Sub files are worthless when watching with Xbox 360.
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2010-07-02T02:35Z,"Lol, found one but it's a mp4 with surround sound.  Xbox 360 won't play those either.  My luck sucks. :(  Why 360 won't play mp4s with good sound is beyond me.  It will play xvid and divx files with multiple channel AC3 just fine but not mp4s."

Yeah my DVD player is the same.  Much better to sit in the front room and watch it on the big 37inch screen rather than on the pokey PC.

Over a year since you posted and still can't find hardcoded subs."
,shaunfoz,2012-01-04T12:33Z,"btw BONE just a quick heads up, there are trackers in some of your files that say i.stole.it, these trackers are anti fraud. just letting evryone know bout these and check your files, if you find them delete it"
,teamholmez86,2012-03-30T23:21Z,"hey eddiehjjjfcfjfc, where is the upload of this with hardcoded english subs ??? id be greatly appreciated if you got back to me thanks. :):)"
