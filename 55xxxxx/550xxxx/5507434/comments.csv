Yes, it?s possible! iH8sn0w has shown a way how you can activate and install iPhone OS 4.0 beta firmware
without UDID registration on your device. Simply follow the steps below to give it a try:

   1. Decrypt your firmware files and get the rootfs.dmg file.
   2. Open the rootfs.dmg file within the IPSW file.
   3. Then navigate to System/Library/CoreServices and copy over SystemVersion.plist
   4. Now open SystemVersion.plist
   5. Remove the following two lines from it
      ReleaseType
      Beta
   6. Add it back into the rootfs.dmg file, overwriting the old SystemVersion.plist.
   7. Now restore the new IPSW file to your device.
