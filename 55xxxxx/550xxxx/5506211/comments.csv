If you download this you deserve the virus you're about to get"
,Racem22,2010-04-21T19:45Z,"Well yes it is an anonymous torrent so it is possible its a virus or some other kind of malware, but the dude above me that says this aint out yet is wrong.  Starcraft 2 BETA has been out for a while.  Actually have a Launcher thats Version 0.28 so its also possible that its not a virus.  Make your own decsions whether you want to download."
[T],Askeen.,2010-04-21T23:18Z,and even the first wave of beta keys has been send out to users.
,pillefaxe,2010-05-05T13:23Z,"well, since not everyone has beta keys, people tend to want ways around it and still play the game... One way is to write these little launcher programs.

less yapping more clapping. The old launchers have died with the patches anywhoo"

its not a virus you dumb fuck

i helped code this launcher, and yeah, its old and outdated, and will not work with the latest patch of starcraft 2 beta

if you are interested in launchers, check out 
darkblizz [dot] com

as for that setupswarm site, i don't see why they are praising this ""demon"" for this software, he didnt create it, and has nothing to do with it

for the TL:DR people

!! THIS VERSION IS OLD, OUTDATED, AND DOES NOT WORK WITH THE LATEST PATCH !!"
