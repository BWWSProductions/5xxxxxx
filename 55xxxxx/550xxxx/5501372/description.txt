Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



After grumbling that I couldn't find the music videos online by one of my FAVORITE bands, Asia, I went to their site and purchased the DVD.  :D 

I know there were others that were interested in these music videos, so HERE they ARE. Enjoy!  ;D 

The music videos included are the only five available on DVD. They are:
1 - Heat Of The Moment
2 - Only Time Will Tell
3 - Wildest Dreams
4 - Don't Cry
5 - The Smile Has Left Your Eyes
*added a TV-rip (not the best quality, but only copy I've ever found) of the video for their song 'Go' from their Astra album. I don't recall where I got it, so thank you to the original uploader.


P.S. - I noticed something odd - I clearly recall that in the video for 'Heat Of The Moment' that when John Wetton sings the lyrics "You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings", that there was an animated video clip of the dragon from the cover of their first album of the dragon flying around a large, white globe (pearl) in the sea. However, in this version on the DVD, you can see how they inserted a second flashing of John Wetton's face singing. Hmm, why did they take out the animation of the dragon? I thought it was pretty cool.
