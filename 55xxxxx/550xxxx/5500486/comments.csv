[T],extremezone,2010-04-18T00:18Z,"@SaM yes my bad doesn't have ""way offsync"" parts , just 3-4 scenes when sync is not perfect , also i forgot to say thanks noir for audio source"
,EvanXTC,2010-04-18T05:33Z,"if you don't want a audio sync issue, use VLC media player to play the movie."
,Sid_of_Id,2010-04-18T06:29Z,"VLC (with latest updates) still plays out of sync....though somewhat better than MPC. 
V/9 A/4 

Unwatchable for audio IMHO."

,supplier13,2010-04-18T13:56Z,"Video quality is good, but the sound is bad there is just too much noise, its just like a TS sound. I`m gonna delete this and w8 for a proper Rip."

,ptv83,2010-04-19T02:07Z,"extremezone GO FUCK YORSELF ASSHOLE, there is NO sync issues.. NONE you stupid piece of shit, this is why they took your skull away, i hope they take your trusted one too, you dont have ANY original content .. all you do is upload others stuff... A FUCKING MONKEY WITH HALF IT'S BRAIN REMOVED CAN DO THAT.

GO AWAY, LEAVE TPB FOREVER, YOU'RE SCUM.

@supplier13, the sound IS scratchy because it's a f'n R5, do you not know what a R5 is.... region 5 dvd.. NOT IN ENGLISH, so the audio is from another souce... AKA, a TS, that's why it's sounds like TS audio.. stupid."
,Kristo-,2010-04-21T15:54Z,"Good quality and good audio :)

And the movie kicks ass! 10+"
,wilikins,2010-04-28T10:59Z,Why the fudge is every on TPB so angry these days? seems we just keep getting more and more tossers that feel the need to spread there inane ignorance. chill out ppl
