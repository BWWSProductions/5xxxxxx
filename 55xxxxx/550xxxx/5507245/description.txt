By popular request from Ryan Hatton, here is my entire collection of everything filmed on my camera (that I own) musically, plus a Role Reversal show. Also I didn't film but touched up the audio and video to the Copycat Massacre, Scissor Shock at the Crump, and RUINHORSE at the old Hope School shows. I didn't film those. Download them all or just the ones you want.
