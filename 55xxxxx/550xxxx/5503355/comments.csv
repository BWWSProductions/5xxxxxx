@lilars: Thank you."
,jon4fun,2010-04-20T01:34Z,"@20-40. Hi 20-40,
Thanks for encode/upload.

I have to skip this weeks entry as I am saving this series to make my own DVD and need everything of similar quality.

I still LOVE QUARK!!! Just not on this show.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-20T01:38Z,"@20-40 Your QUARK files have saved me so much on DL allowance that I can just go and find a 350MB .avi of show and not worry about it.
Can't do a 720p DL yet, not that much allowance, but it is nice to have leftover DL allowance rather than knowing you're going to hit the wall or get charged extra.

Still prefer your 272p encode of this show though.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-20T06:03Z,"@jjabrams & Jon:
OK, I'll encode 272p and up the torrent today. Jon, I've choose to encode [quark] only mainly (99%) because of you. But guys - no biggie, just next week there will be no [quark] of Br.B, tough."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-20T06:57Z,"Sorry, I meant 720p."
