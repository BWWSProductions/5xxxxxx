,Campground,2010-05-09T20:27Z,"Seed now, we all want this game. Many seeders but very low speed, tur the preferences up! :D"
,stalker2755,2010-05-13T03:55Z,"How to properly use the system: 

Yeah, @Chudboy... that's for u as well!

1. install the game

2. run the date check to decrypt the main exe or the update won't work

3. update

4. copy (not overwrite) the two RELOADED files and execut the RELOADED launcher

NOTE: make sure there's no DaemonTools virtual drive active and if it still won't work, uninstall any Visual C++ 2005 x64 Runtime packages, leave only x86 ones and reboot.

Offline game saving works through the LIVE application inside the game... first run it's the welcome text, second run will show you a page full of text with a link in it... that link goes to a setup that will allow creation of local live profiles so offline game saving."

1:will it work with a legit copy of GTA IV (I'm sure it will but)
2: Is there anything I should know before trying to install a pirated version of episodes onto a legit version of GTA IV?"
,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-14T18:57Z,Don't feel bad Jadawkss it took me three MONTHS to figure out how to post comments on this bitch LOLOL
,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-14T19:03Z,"IM PISSED AT ROCKSTAR... After 6 months of patching and updating and experimenting I FINALLY got GTA IV to work good on my computer with decent graph9icss. No lag no missing textures perfectly working copy of GTA IV then I read the updates and fixes that patch that came along with the v1.1.1.0 patch for ELC and I start the game and get TREENDOUS lag.... the new shadows thing they did fucked everything up man.... Then they also put ELC and the lost boys links right on the main GTA IV page when I don't even own those games..... it's like advertising on my video game that I PAID for..... if I got the game for free then you can advertise ALL YOU WANT when i buy the game I DON'T want to have to see your advertisements everytime I start it FUCK!!!

Such an invasion of my stuff... All i can think of is to reinstall the game but then I will have to figure out everything I did to get it to work before installing this latest patch.... I will have to patch it from the first patch to the second to last one and that's annoying!!!

 DAMMIT ROCKSTAR!!!"

[Note]
In windows vista and 7, the savegame is located in C:\Users\[YOURUSERNAME]\AppData\Local\Rockstar Games\GTA IV\savegames\

For Windows Xp, I am not sure where it is but try one of the following:

C:\Documents and Settings\[YOURUSERNAME]\Local Settings\Application Data\Rockstar Games\GTA IV\savegames\

or

C:\Documents and Settings\[YOURUSERNAME]\Application Data\Rockstar Games\GTA IV\savegames\


[Quote]
If you have reinstall or change (not upgrade) your OS and have backup your savegame, I would recommend you to install xliveless or xlive wrapper to continue playing the game. It is only a file called xlive.dll that is added in the game directory.

Don't try to download the official xliveless because running the game will result with an error(Which means that your game is a pirated version). I searched for a cracked xliveless file and fail to do so.

But i remember that a file xlive.dll exists in the police mods of GTA IV (Niko Bellic). So i install the police mod in any location, copy xlive.dll to the EFLC directory and uninstall the police mod(for bug reason).


[Downloads]
Search for Police Pursuit Mod 7.4 or go to link (if alive):

http://www.gtagaming.com/downloads/gta-iv/script-mods/5265

and download the PolicePursuitModBeta7.4b.zip


[Restoration]
My operation works fine but your savegame will have to be restored in the directory  ""\Rockstar Games\GTA IV\savegames\"" located in Documents"" or ""My Documents"" instead."
