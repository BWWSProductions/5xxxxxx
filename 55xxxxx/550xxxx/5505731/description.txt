This is my mod which adds all vehicles to the Just Cause 2 game.


-Extract the .zip

-Place the <dropzone> folder into your <Just Cause 2 install folder>

-Play the game, and enjoy having all vehicles.


Reason for being 61mb: mod includes pictures of all vehicles for in-game. Otherwise you have to guess which vehicle is which..


please seed asap, because i can't leave my pc on all night.	

This is a re-upload because, i made a mistake by packing the .zip twice.
im sorry, won't happen again!
