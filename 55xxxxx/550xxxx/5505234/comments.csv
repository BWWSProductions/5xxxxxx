,jjabrams,2010-04-20T17:20Z,720p? this is new!? - will you be continuing this for future weeks?
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-20T19:05Z,"Nope, ""How to make in America"" and few other were 720p.
It is reference encoding, every single parameter of both video and audio is substantially tweaked.
Next week - and till the end 272p.
This one is done for you and Jon (and I know to read between the lines). Do not worry and have not any second thoughts about - I have enjoy it, doing 12 hours long encoding and toasting my old, slow PC..."

Cheers
Jon"
