-It has everything you need to do what you need to get done, from Homework helper to PersonalBrain, a AI activity tracker.

- This is perfect for anyone from Age 6 to 60

All the information you could ever need or that could be related to something can be found in here! 

But please no bitching that it doesn't work, if something is wrong look online or re-read the manual above, especially if you haven't. This thing works and I tested it on Xp. So if something is really wrong check the md5 HASH.

But y'all enjoy and post comments if you like it or need something or have something to share..

Until then,
Stay Cheezy!!"

 If used properly, this can be an extremely powerful tool that can help people keep track of information and thoughts and can be a comprehensive search engine to store and relate all your most important notes and information.

 This program is highly recommended, and if you like it, buy it."

Instead Get This One:

,Cgoff87,2010-04-23T12:08Z," And what about everything else? Does the Hero & Villains at least work? Because my guess would be that If its a loading problem its more than likely trouble with flash, so be sure to check that. If everything else is working properly its probably a log in problem. Did it ever ask you to sign up or register at any point? If so let me know so I could get you that  info. If anyone else is having problems or if its working just fine, please post your review here.

""Additional Troubleshooting Tips

Data Errors
With so much content, we've tried to make it perfect, but there still may remain errata in the data, both in display and in hyperlinks. There may be only a handful of errors in the entire encyclopedia, but these will be corrected.""

 Maybe this is one of the errors expressed here, I don't know for sure but it works for me. Perhaps someone else can verify if the atlas works for them to see if its just a common technical issue."
,Cgoff87,2010-05-16T22:58Z,"I had a friend download this, and it worked on his computer as well.  Surprisingly fast download speed, Good job seeders!"

,coolasad,2010-11-05T18:53Z,"Just Downloaded and Installed it.
The ISO file cant be played by PowerIso. The Program gets crashed.
I Used winrar to extract the files.
There was a slight error in extraction but I dont think that it effected the files."
,boobydlonra,2010-11-10T14:17Z,Thanks a lot!
,LovePirates,2010-11-29T14:51Z,Can i burn the ISO file? uhmm.. does it connect to the internet? do you have a crack??
,Cgoff87,2011-02-11T05:26Z,"It doesn't need to connect to the internet, i verified that since my comment in the past. The file is a rar that you just extract mount and install. Personally, I recommend daemon tools if you are new at or have had problems mounting or installing this program in the past. "
,ZENeal23,2011-03-04T15:56Z,Great application.. thanks for the up loader.... this is the kind of reference that i am looking for... cheers!!!
,sinand99,2011-03-13T13:36Z,"this program fails to start if your computer's locale is different than English. (tested on win7 x64 turkish) To work around this problem, change system region to united states and english language"
,Cgoff87,2011-05-17T07:19Z,"Damn I didn't ever think of that method to prevent piracy...
