It is a simple folder of MP3's at 256kps 

Note: I abhor the itunes naming convention.
I use full file tag names (artist-album-track-title) and alphabetize proper names as well as moving "the"  to the end (eg. "Beatles, The") this way there aren't a zillion "the" tracks on my Sony MP3 player and when I random play songs I have all the info in front of me...other than that quirk, enjoy and rename as you wish
