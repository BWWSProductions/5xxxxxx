As he got job in USA, his working parents (Suhasini and Ashish Vidyaradhi), both got married against the wishes of their parents, ask him to get married. He accepts and tells them that he would rather want to marry a girl that is selected by them in traditional style and wants his marriage ceremony to be conducted in as 5-day event. He also refuses to see his bride before the marriage. Everything is arranged according to wishes, and his marriage is fixed with Deepti (Bhanu Sri Mehra). On the time of marriage, the bride is kidnapped by a local rowdy Diwakar (Arya). How hero brings his bride back from the clutches of this goon forms the rest of the story.
