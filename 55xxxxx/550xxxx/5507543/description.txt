Release Notes:

Guitarist Joe Satriani is set to release his 12th solo album, Super Colossal, on
March 14, 2006 through Epic Records. With thirteen new songs, Satriani completes
his transformation from stunning instrumentalist to fully-realized artist. Since
the late 80's, the guitar virtuoso has been winning over fans and musicians
alike with his groundbreaking style and legendary sounds.

Co-Produced by Satriani and Mike Fraser (AC/DC), Super Colossal features Satriani
performing on all of the guitar and bass parts. Live drums were cut on four
tracks by session giant Simon Phillips, the rest were played by Satriani's
longtime collaborator Jeff Campitelli. The 13 diverse tracks on the album range
from the title track's thundering, foot-stomp beat and intricately textured lead
line, to the spiritual intensity of â€œA Love Eternalâ€ and the raucous, party-down
exhilaration of â€œCrowd Chant.â€

On the day of the album's release, Satriani will begin a west coast trek, making
special in-store appearances. Soon after, he will launch a full U.S. tour
beginning on April 1st in Denver.

Quite comfortable on the road, Satriani set out on his most ambitious worldwide
tour yet in April 2004. Hitting 25 countries, playing 105 shows to over 500,000
people and logging in over 150,000 miles, Satriani wrapped up this worldwide trek
in May 2005 by playing to over 20,000 people at three sold-out shows in India.

This year marks Satriani's 20-year anniversary as a solo artist, his first album,
Not Of This Earth, was released in 1986. Over the course of his illustrious
career, Satriani has achieved huge success, selling more than 10 million albums &
DVDs worldwide with 12 solo albums (2 platinum, 4 gold) and 3 platinum DVD's, as
well as garnering 13 Grammy nominations.
