,jhonybravo,2010-04-22T12:33Z,masterfaster the emulator language is russian but you can change to english and the game menu is russian and when you mstart the game its all in english
,xps7100,2010-06-13T10:16Z,is this one for pc or ps2?
,fingerdish,2010-06-19T02:55Z,can we open the file using Daemon? thanks!
,legenddude,2010-07-05T15:51Z,hey jhony can you expalin about the emulator i have installed it in russian but i dunno how to change to english i've also searched on google but i don't find it else its a great game.
,RD90,2010-09-15T19:45Z,"i'm installing it in Russian... will the game itself be in Russian as well?? if yes, then where's the option to change the language?"
,Macxemi,2010-09-21T23:49Z,"Made a account, just to write this...

I Downloaded and installed
Started the game, it was in Russian.
I change the language in the ""emulator(?)"" to english, but the game text language is STILL in Russian (wich makes it hard to understand any of the ingame instructions!)
I started the game and the grafics looked like it was from the 80Â´s!
I used over 1 hour to tweek the settings in the emulator(or what the hell it is), wich is totaly not user friendly, and you allmost need to be a computer programmer to understand what the hell all those options do. 
I finaly got the grafics to look like something from the 90Â´s, i tryed to tweeked a little more , and the whole thing crashed (and the game wont start again)

All in all... this is not worth your time.
I am not sure if its just not meant to be played on pc, or its just a crapy cracked release.

Problems with grafics. Problems with language. problems with user friendlyness. problems with to much!"

Something went wrong..."
,orchlon,2010-09-23T15:55Z,"Macxemi you asshole
All you did in your Motherfucking comment was to diss the one and only PS2 emulator. PCSX2 is the best and the fastest emulator alive out there. Not only for ps2 but for all the consoles itself. Compared to stuff like dolphin epsxe PCSX2 is a much better faster emulator. The Game graphics will look how it looks in the Console. It has nothing to do with the emulator and the language also has nothing to do with the emulator. Anyway the text in the game will be russian but the dialogue ain't gonna be that"
,orchlon,2010-09-25T13:52Z,"How to make this game work.
1: Download and install the game
2: There should be a GodofWar2.iso file in the game directory
3: Copy it somewhere else
4: Uninstall the game
5: Go to pcsx2.net and download PCSX 0.9.7
6: Read some threads in the pcsx2.net forum to get it working.
7: Remember don't use this emulator cuz it's PCSX 0.9.6 which is 2x as slower"
,Damianius,2010-10-07T23:19Z,"A question mate, I downloades PSCX2 and stuff, had problems with bios and stuff.. but now I have an issue, how to open the file I downloaded, shows it is a deamontools file, but can't open it with deamon... any chance u can assist me? =)"
,remedy2,2010-12-06T09:18Z,"@Damianius  MDF is a  Alcohol 120% file.  So you can download that or I think ISObuster and MagicISO can open and convert it to an ISO.  I think that is why jhonybravo wrote sorry fucking mdsmdf because the file format is annoying to deal with.  Regardless thanks for the torrent, gonna try it out and see how it works.  I'm never very impressed with emulators for the later consoles maybe this will surprise me."
,remedy2,2010-12-06T21:37Z,"Sigh- sorry orchlon I'm in Macxemi's camp on this one.  Different emulator, same issues.  Its just not worth the hassle to play for me.  The game menu is in Russian (unless there is some obscure config setting I missed) and played extremely slow even with my core 2 Quad / 460 GTX.  Yes I understand if I read through the forum and learn about each setting and tweak them right I *might* get the game working near 100% but from the little I read on the forums there were people that got the game working then midway through it froze on some BS cutscene.  Not going to go through that.  The problem with these emulators for newer consoles is they just require too much tweaking and trial and error for each game you try to play.  Even if PCSX2 is the best it still is incredibly user unfriendly as each game needs its own settings.  If I want to play PS2 games bad enough I'll buy one used for $100 and not have to frustrate myself with framerate, freezing, menu and other gameplay issues.  The only emulators worth a damn IMO are the SNES, GBA, etc ones where hmm I don't know, games just work.  Its just my opinion though and I'm sure there are plenty that don't mind dicking around with settings for an hour to play each game.  Don't let my negativity ruin it for the rest of ya. Have at it if you like."
,remedy2,2010-12-18T16:04Z,"Ok  I finally tried PCSX2 0.9.7 and its pretty good with God of War 2.  Here's what i recommend:

1. Don't download this torrent. jhonybrano- good idea, bad execution.  This version has Russian menus and has a dumb mdf file that you have to convert to an iso.  Not only that the emulator included is out of date.  

2.  Note you need a pretty good video card and at least a dual core 3Ghz+ to get good framerates.  Also having a 360 controller or PS2 controller will make playing a lot more enjoyable.

3. Instead of jhonybravo's torrent download this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4292020/God_of_War_II_ps2_pal

3. Then download the newest version of the emulator (PCSX2 0.9.7): 
http://eu.emudev.org/pcsx2/mirror.php?id=win-setup

4. You will need the bios files so download this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4170684/PS2_Bios_Files

5. Install PCSX2 and choose your bios file, map your controller or keyboard to PS2 buttons, and setup your graphics plugin to directx 9 hardware  or directx 11 hardware (the highest version your card will support)

6. Under config->emulation settings->speedhacks you will want to enable speedhacks.  Set EE Cyclerate to 2, under 'other hacks' check the first 2,  VU cycle stealing set to 2, microvu hacks check the first 2.  

Note VU cycle stealing will cause your character to flicker a little when he moves but thats the only way I could get the frame rate near 100%.  The flickering is a little annoying but tolerable.  If you have a faster processor than mine you may want to try it without VU cycle stealing.

Overall it does take some work, but I guess its pretty cool to try some games you can't play without a PS2 (even if it doesn't run perfect).

My setup for reference:  
Q8300 Quad @3Ghz (OC)
4GB Ram @ 1600 Mhz
Nvidia 460 GTX 1GB
360 Wireless controller

You can mess around with the speed hacks and graphics config to see what works best for your system.  The speed hacks above work best for mine, some others might work best for yours.  

Good luck!"
,tizzay89,2010-12-19T03:40Z,meh i wanted this game but didnt realize how old it was..  if the texted instructions are in another lango then it has already failed. no point in playing the game and getting stressed cuz u have no fucking idea what to do unless ur a comy red lol lmfao no but really

,remedy2,2011-01-25T04:42Z,"xspiTFirex- Your computer may not be able to handle PCSX2.  Please list your computer specs (processor type/speed, graphics card model, and ram) and I can tell you if you need to upgrade before trying this or other games on PCSX2."
