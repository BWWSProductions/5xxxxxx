A successful Falcon measurement flight was performed on 19 April 2010 for probing 
plumes over Germany from the Iceland EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano eruption. Layers of 
volcanic ash were detected by Lidar and probed in-situ with aerosol instruments. 
Under suitable viewing conditions, the ash layer was visible as a brownish layer to 
the observer. The horizontal and vertical distributions of the volcano layers were 
variable. In the plume layers particles larger than 3Âµm were detected at 
concentrations, not present in the free troposphere during unpolluted conditions. The 
concentrations of large particles measured in the volcano layers are comparable to 
concentrations measured typically in Saharan dust plumes but smaller compared to 
particle concentrations in the polluted boundary layer. An estimation of the particle 
mass concentration in the volcanic ash plume probed as part of a vertical profile over 
Leipzig at about 4 km altitude yield 60 Âµg/m3.     
      
After the flight the Falcon was inspected. So far no damages were observed including 
engines (after boroscopy) and windows. Further engine inspection is ongoing. Silver 
foils attached to under-wing stations showed no visible impact from volcanic ash. 


Comment: Finally some scientific facts in this ocean of confusion around the volcanic eruption in Iceland.
