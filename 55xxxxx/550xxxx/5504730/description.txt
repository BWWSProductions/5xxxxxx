At the heart of this film, is a very simple story about a very complicated relationship between three very different people. People who meet by chance, and who, in less time than it takes to have dinner-- become a â€œkind of family.â€ From a structural standpoint, I of course considered â€œopening upâ€ the movie further, ----â€œWhy not see them go to the deli?â€ â€œWhy not show Patricia at her gallery?â€ etc, but every time I tried to conceive the film that way, I seemed to be doing it for the â€œsakeâ€ of doing it----because convention seemed to dictate it. But
in the end, I decided to come to terms with and respect what I think the â€œcoreâ€ of this story is: Three people meet, have dinner, and change each others lives forever.
