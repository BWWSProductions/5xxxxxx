                    After months of separation Patrick and Mimi  
                    amicably agree to a quickie divorce, but they  
                    get a nasty shock when they discover their  
                    marriage was never legal. Mimi flies into  
                    accusations and recriminations, holding Patrick  
                    to blame. She then hatches a plan to secretly  
                    marry and divorce legitimately to save the  
                    souls of their "bastard" kids. Everything is in  
                    disarray, and Patrick is due to leave for a new  
                    business venture, but the mission to re-marry  
                    brings up memories of the past and unearths  
                    their true feelings.
