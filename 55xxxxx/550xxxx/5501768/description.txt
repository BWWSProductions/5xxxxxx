White Squall came as a surprise to me. i watched it in marine ecology. before the movie began, i had expected a movie that would be as boring as National Geographic (no offense) and sat with a pen poised to write down character names, roles, and admirable qualities. but when the movie started up, i thought "oh my gosh. a movie ill be able to sit through! it has people i know, a gripping tale, and (at the expense of sounding shallow) hot guys." i absolutely loved the movie. it really put the ocean in perspective for me. wen i wound up with marine ecology on my class schedule, i moaned, because I'm not an ocean person, and because i had signed up for chemistry. but now i am enjoying myself in this class, and find the work no extra burden. the movie was absolutely phenomenal. thats all i can say. to teachers all over the globe--show the movie to your students, i guarantee that the buff jock sitting in the corner throwing around a football will get blubbery, and the preppy girl with pounds of make up will not complain at runny mascara.
