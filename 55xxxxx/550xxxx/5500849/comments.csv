,maddnezzsszz,2010-07-02T16:01Z,"Hey peeps,

I know this is a rar file, but you can mount it. 
For all those people who dont know what mounting is:
Download Daemon tools, I've got daemon tools lite, works very well.
Make sure you install daemon tools
Go to the right corner of your screen, where your internet connection etc. is as well. 
You should see a disk there with a lightning bolt through it. 
Put an empty disk in your pc/laptop, whatever.
LEFT click on the daemon tool logo, so the silver disk with the lightning bolt (blue). Right clicking doesnt work for what you wanna do.
Choose the lowest option, which should say something like: Device 0 : no media. 
Click on that. 
A screen opens. 
Look for where you have saved the harry potter rar file and select it by double clicking. 
You have now mounted the Harry Potter file, making your computer think that the empty disk in your laptop/pc is actually the official Harry Potter disk. 
A screen should pop up with a quidditch logo, saying autorun. Click on it to start the installation. 
The next screen says stuff in russian, unfortunately my computer doesnt respond anymore to the programm after i select an option, maybe you have more luck. At least now you know how to mount a file to a disk. 
If you want to do this with other games as well (mounting that is) first always make sure you unmount the disk before using it for a second game. 
You do this by LEFT clicking on the disk with lightning bolt again, now choosing the top option: unmount all DVD-roms. 

If you still have problems with the steps i just described (so nothing about installing the game, cant help you with that!) just leave a comment here, and Ill try to help :)

Good Luck!"

In the setup, there is an option were you can select 2 options in a dropdown menu. One makes it Russian, and the other English. Just make sure on the screen before it, on the 3rd thing down, it says English Game. That's it. So I would just reinstall."
,mitesh7,2011-03-18T14:05Z,"cant find any setup file
Fucking Fake
Tried to open in WinRar coz .iso files are supported in WinRar Also..........."
,zeruel107,2011-04-21T23:12Z,"Guys who reads this, READ!!

Step 1. Use a mounting program (I use PowerIso, works superb) to open the .iso file u get with the torrent.

Step 2. Start the installations file (Setup/Install) and install the game into wanted Destination (C:/D:)

Step 3. Play the game and have fun!

I have encountered one problem tho, the game andd everything is in Russian, which is cool and all, but i don`t understand a little sick shiz of russian.. Is there any way I can change the game from Russian to English? Plz answer ASAP"

BTW, WINzip/7zip is NOT reccomended by me to open .iso files, use a mounting program, which probably is DaemonTools/PowerIso."
,C0RNF14K35,2011-04-23T07:08Z,"Excellent thanks it's frozen once but I did play it for 6 hours...
People complaining about no setup, simply mount the iso and autorun, not hard.
And follow CBmultimedia's tip for setting to English, worked perfectly."
,nicqawsed,2011-04-24T10:06Z,such an awsome game. great download and big thanks to CBmultimedia for instructions to english.
,Anonym099,2011-08-06T01:40Z,I've been playing the GBA version and it's great. I wonder what the PC version is like.

,WapH,2011-09-13T03:31Z,"hello guys, I installed it normally (however the setup was 90% russian and 10% english) but in the end of the setup it opened an error. I don't know what did he says because it was in russian, lol.
Anyway I don't got that problem that you ppl got. My menus are in english but it hasn't an option o changle the volume of the game, ffs.

If you got the same errors than me on the setup try to hit the ignore button, as I did.

Hope that helped (I guess it didn't helped :X).

Thanks for reading,
Cheers

P.S.     Sorry about my english :$"

,YRafs,2011-11-13T03:41Z,"People, to get the game in english:

When you install it (by mounting it as some people already explained), in the setup, there will be a option box with 2 options. Just select the lower one, and that's it o//"
,kt8711,2012-05-09T07:06Z,"Having a problem. Mounted it, installed it. But when I go to click the icon and play the game, nothing happens. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Does this game not work with Windows 7? Sorry if I come off like a noob. "
