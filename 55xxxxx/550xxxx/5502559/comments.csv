,dardar6t9,2010-06-05T15:18Z,nooooo...that'd make too much sense. I tried this torrent for 3 wks and not even 0.1%.........waste of time
,dardar6t9,2010-06-10T17:04Z,If any of you want the ebook go to demonoid and search in the book section....I just did then and it took about 30secs to download. And no.... this isnt spam
