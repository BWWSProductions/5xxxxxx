,jim001,2010-05-03T02:56Z,** jordanrich    Comcast has called me. Saying i was over my gig limit for the month. I talked freely about downloading games and movies. He just told me to slow down. Maybe you should change providers.
,sikair27,2010-05-03T11:12Z,Just got a Copyright Infringement notice from Sony Pictures. Definitely being watched.
,Quickie582,2010-05-04T10:38Z,"IF YOU FUCKHEADS DONT WANT TO BE CAUGHT DOWNLOADING FILES USE "" IDENTITYCLOAKER"""
,hatecrime,2010-05-06T03:50Z,"Hooray, who likes getting their internet turned off!? Anyone downloading this either has an ISP that doesn't care or they like getting letters from studios!

My dorm internet was revoked, this is the last time I download a shitty movie off a public tracker."
,LRD3,2010-05-07T17:01Z,good quality and no letters or emails from any companies. plus with everything that is wrong with the world why should people who download movies be anywhere near a priority.
,Soler666,2010-05-09T12:15Z,"Those who have been sent copyright infringement e-mails or had their ISP turn off service, go on BitTorrent 6.4 go to ""options"" then ""preferences"" then ""Bittorrent"" and set ""Protocol Encryption"" to ""Forced"".  I had the same problem until I set-up as I just explained. 

Good Luck"
,Eluvies,2010-05-13T15:13Z,well if this torrent is watched and w/e all the paranoid users are whining over... they should be kind of busy back in the studios.. i mean Se: 5283 and Le: 1458 (including me)... so stop whining over some notices from studio.. prove it with scanning the letter or the image of it and put here in comments.. otherwise go for J'Lo and giant Arse... ;D
,De_W_eY,2010-05-15T05:29Z,"Alright everyone just leave J Lo alone, we all know she can't act, but at least she looks good trying."
