So Runs the World Away is the sixth full-length album by American singer-songwriter Josh Ritter.

Ritter said of the album that it "marks the beginning of a new period in [his] life," and that overall, "the songs are larger and more detailed, and feel to me as if they were painted in oil on large canvasses."

The record's release was met with high anticipation and covered by multiple news and media publications. Stephen King reported looking forward to the album. Bob Boilen of NPR's All Songs Considered said of the album, "I've come to expect good records from him...but this one took my breath away."
