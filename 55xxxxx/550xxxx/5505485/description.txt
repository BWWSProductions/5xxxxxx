Bio: Hello! My name is Paloma. I currently live in Krasnodar, but I was born and spent my childhood in the north. Since I was a child, I was without sun and warmth. I decided that when I grew up, I would live in some place where it is always warm and next to the sea. I study at the medical university in the cosmetology facility. In the university, they teach us how to make different masks. The best way to know if they are good or not, is to test them on myself or test them on my friends. Almost every weekend I invite a lot of friends over and we try different face and body masks. After all these treatments, their skin becomes so soft and smooth. My hobby is diving. Because the sea is close, my friends and I often go diving, taking photos of beautiful corals and fish. I have great plans for my future. I want to learn how to jump with a parachute and to become a pilot. I know I can make it all happen because I have plenty of time, I was only 18 when I wrote this.
