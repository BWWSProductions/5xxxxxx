                    Killing Time.                            
                    Foyle takes on the might of the US army as  
                    racial prejudice erupts. Sam and Adam are now  
                    running a dilapidated local guest house where  
                    Mandy Dean is one of the residents. Disowned by  
                    her family, she is a young, vulnerable mother  
                    all alone because of the hostility levelled  
                    against her and her mixed-race baby. Her  
                    ex-boyfriend returns hoping to win her back,  
                    but then she is found murdered and the finger  
                    of suspicion points to a black GI at the nearby  
                    US military base - the father of her child.
