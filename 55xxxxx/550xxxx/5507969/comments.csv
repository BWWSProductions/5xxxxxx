,agdagd,2010-04-29T17:27Z,"I am still looking for sushi ko episode. Where the hell it is hidden. Is someone trying to do so intentionally????? Just because of unscheduled airing of KM episodes, am going to loose interest in such episodes. Instead watching spartacus and enjoying every bit of it. boooooo ramsay."
