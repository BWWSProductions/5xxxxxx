,BVG_196,2010-04-19T21:42Z,"Read the text file for the password you morons.
I will test this one tomorrow. Lets hope this shit work"
,sinshixxi,2010-04-20T02:08Z,apprently there're many gamefaqers already played this game so this release won't be a nuke
,BVG_196,2010-04-20T18:27Z,"I can confrim that this release works.
Enjoy"
,alfzone,2010-04-21T05:57Z,Didn't work for me
,jjooeer,2010-04-22T00:57Z,whats the fucking password ?    2008-2010 doesnt work 
,boystreet,2010-04-22T16:03Z,"@jjooeer
lol, do you know how to read?"
,jjooeer,2010-04-23T04:11Z,i just tried  and that doesn't work either
,jjooeer,2010-04-23T04:15Z,"@boystreet 
the password in the text did not work either it wouldn't even let me leave it in this message for everyone to see what i am trying  

why even upload something if you need a password for it to work thats why Markuf isn't verified anymore!
"
,Pwny,2010-04-23T05:06Z,"Ok everyone, before I download this, lots of you seem to be tripping about passwords...

Is it just retards not reading the .info?

Additionally, can this be played whilst on XBOX Live?

lol thx guys"
,gmariano,2010-04-24T14:30Z,"Hi people,
The real password is the middle line:
---------------------> 2008-2010"
,dragonvayu,2010-04-24T20:01Z,Oh yeah this one works
,jjooeer,2010-04-24T21:26Z,"works i figured it out password is 

www X360SOS com putting the .s in the blank spots"
,BVG_196,2010-04-25T00:52Z,"You need to use activate ISO cd to get this to work on some Xbox.
You put in the activate ISO in the xbox, launch the ""game"". Then take out the CD, put in SSF4, and then it will work. Just search for it on google.
It is called Activate ISO"
,sinshixxi,2010-04-25T21:51Z,ABGX called it nuke because it said the source coming from P2P? I don't quite understand why they nuke it
,ticktock_man,2010-04-26T16:35Z,"the stupid cunt that password protected this needs to get kicked in the teeth. (and yes, i know the PW is in the text file)."
,sinshixxi,2010-04-29T05:40Z,for people playing on Live. I suggest to download Marvel's release instead because Marvel has ABGX database verification but this Firefox doesn't have.
,jogfsovt,2010-04-30T06:59Z,"This is a good copy. Verified working. It only contains SSv1 (most likely a kreon drive rip), but is very easily patched to SSv2, and all other CRCs verify properly. Thanks, uploader."
,timothycharran,2010-05-01T11:13Z,So is this really RF...does it work? can someone comment....
,DDL999,2010-05-14T04:07Z,SSF4 will come out for pc?????
,thepirateofpirates,2010-05-27T16:04Z,"Thanks for the upload... 100% working...
However, I was really wondering, why the hell does it have a password, if it's already available in an attached file ?!... it didn't make any sense to me, and I wish if someone could clarify the benefit/reason of doing so ?!"
,studomer,2010-06-05T02:03Z,"What the fuck is with these people who put passwords on these files? Seriously, you have to have the intelligence of a sack of doorknobs not to understand this fact.

Public files = no password

How is this difficult to understand?"
,rt0584,2010-06-20T06:54Z,"Hey guys, i was just wondering, could someone please tell me the password, i have tried  multiple times and i just cant seem to get it, i would really appreciate someone helping me out, thanks :(."
,rafael.uncbook,2010-07-18T19:11Z,Anyone knows if its working on 1.6?
