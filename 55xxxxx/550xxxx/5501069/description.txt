Plot: A family father and quite successful businessman played by Fraser comes face to face with the reality of life that death is at every corner. His daughters both have a genetic anomaly that will cause them to slowly die, one of them only has one year left before death takes her. The father is stuck between a rock and the ground as some say because there is no cure for this illness. Well they are his daughters so he does what we would all dream of doing in his situation, quitting his job he teams up with a brilliant but also flawed scientist who has probably the best chance of finding a cure. And in the end the strain of Fraserâ€™s life gets to Ford and the outcome may well decide the fate of his children.
