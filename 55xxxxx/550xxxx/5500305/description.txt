Frank Sinatra - Ring-a-Ding-Ding! (1961)

Reprise Records, @256 kbps








This was the first album Sinatra recorded with the label that he founded, Reprise Records. The idea was to have an album without any ballads. Originally the song Have You Met Miss Jones? was going to be included, however, it was felt that the song did not fit, so it was left off. The album reached No. 4; it was given favorable reviews by Stereo Review, and, although a similar album (Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!) was released by Capitol simultaneously, Ring-A-Ding-Ding! managed to maintain a 35 week stay on the charts. In the UK the album reached No. 8 and stayed for 9 weeks on the chart.

The title track was written specifically for Sinatra by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen.
