Website graphics & animations
MAGIX 3D Maker is also an ideal complement
for other website building programs.
Create professional-looking Flash banners with
your name or your message and easily position
them as well as personalized logos on your
website.
Thanks to individual 3D effects and animations
all eyes will be on your website.
Creating buttons is also amazingly easy. Use
them in navigation bars or as menu items too.
Visitors will want to stay and explore your
website's contents! Enhance not only your
personal or business websites, but also eBay
offers, community profiles, or email newsletters
with three dimensional web graphics!
Turn your website into something special!

Bring life your texts to life!
Use the intuitive animation tool to liven up
complete texts,
individual characters, or selected
objects fully automatically (e.g. turns, rotations,
in and out fades, pulses, swings).
You can also easily specify the number of
movements per sequence, turn direction, speed,
pauses, and number of repetitions.
Even texts and light can be animated separately!
