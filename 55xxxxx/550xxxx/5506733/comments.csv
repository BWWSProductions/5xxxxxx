,mexsal,2011-02-09T22:10Z,"Worked just great!  Thanks HBGIO..
That activation number worked for me.  Just be sure to copy over the crack first.  Then turn off your internet.  Finally open the application and use that activation code.  "

simply install from inside the RAR folder (don't extract) and then disable your internet connection (pull Ethernet cable out of modem or pc) then extract the crack to desktop and cut and paste to the magix directory and use the serials given in other comments they all work trust me.
you may have to paste activation a few times opening and closing the program but it will eventually, make sure wen you activate the product the internet connection is back on....GOOD LUCK"
