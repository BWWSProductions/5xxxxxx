The Adventures of Tintin â€“ The Red Sea Sharks

When he hears that the Emir Ben Kalish has been deposed by rebels, Tintin is quickly on his way to Khemed to help his old friend. But behind the scenes is that ruthless international gangster and slave trader, the so-called Marquis di Gorgonzola. The Marquis will stop at nothing to protect his sinister interests. Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock may escape from the danger of the desert, but far deadlier perils await them in the Red Sea.
