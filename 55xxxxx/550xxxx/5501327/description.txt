Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



If you enjoyed 'The Buena Vista Social Club', then you will love this documentary on Compay Segundo - one of the members of that wonderful group. It is a WONDERFUL look at the life of one of Cuba's favorite musicians, and how that man enjoyed life to the fullest and how much JOY his music brought him and all who heard it.   :) 

This is in Spanish with hard-coded English subtitles.
