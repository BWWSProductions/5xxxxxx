    A little loggerhead turtle follows in the path of her ancestors on       
    one of the most extraordinary journeys in the natural world. Born on     
    a beach in Florida, she rides the Gulf Stream all the way to the         
    frozen north and ultimately swims around the entire North Atlantic to    
    Africa and back to the beach where she was born.
