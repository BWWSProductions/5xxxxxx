Why the hell do people encode in Microsoft codecs.  They are so restrictive."
,Zadok77,2010-04-26T18:16Z,"I haven't heard of any sound problems yet. They sound great on my end. The files are directly from the source and have not been altered.

They were encoded with Windows Media Player 9 (which was released in 2003). These codecs are widely available, so there shouldn't be any problems. "
