Plot -

- Steve and Louise have had their four bedroom, two bathroom Kallangur house, just north of Brisbane on the market for 
- 11 months with three different agents and an asking price of $359,000. Its currently tenanted by their twenty year old 
- son and his friend who prefer partying and poker nights, to early starts and clean-ups for inspections. Sadly the house 
- was trashed by the last tenants friends, who didnt sign a lease and while Steve and Louise have attempted some repairs, 
- it still needs a lot of work.
