In my opinion this is the best music manager in the world. All my music uploads are tagged, renamed etc. in this manager. 

Most important in this upload is fixed bug in Amazon import!!!!!

After installing it just replace original file with file from crack folder.

I tested it. Works fine.

Enjoy :)
