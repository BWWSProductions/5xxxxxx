Courage in Red S01E11 - Summit

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.

Episode Info: With 66 countries in attendance, the Summit Francophone hosted the largest deployment of foreign dignitaries in Canadian history. With big crowds come big risks: biological, chemical and explosive threats are just a few of the many scenarios that the RCMP must prepare for. Security must be air-tight. With the Vancouver Olympics approaching, the stakes are high for Supt. Jacques Tanguay's last mission. The summit will also provide Jacques with his first and only opportunity to have his son under his command - an emotional experience.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
