Together is the 5th album by Canadian-US collective The New Pornographers, featuring Neko Case and Destroyerâ€™s Dan Bejar, in addition to bandleader and chief songwriter A.C. Newman, who All Music Guide says â€œin a perfect world, would be our Elton, our McCartneyâ€. Playing to all the New Pornographers strengths, Together combines the freewheeling, glammy spirit of their debut Mass Romantic with the very personal, emotional songwriting of their most recent material. As a result, itâ€™s an album that aims to please, as exciting for the New Pornographers obsessive as for casual new listeners.

In addition to the core lineup of A.C. Newman (who wrote nine of the album's songs), Dan Bejar (who wrote three), Neko Case, John Collins, Kurt Dahle, Kathryn Calder, Todd Fancey, and Blaine Thurier, Together also features contributions from Beirut's Zach Condon, St. Vincent's Annie Clark, Okkervil River's Will Sheff, and the horn section from the Dap-Kings.
