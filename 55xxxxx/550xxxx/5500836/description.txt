Joselito, JosÃ© JimÃ©nez FernÃ¡ndez was born in Beas de Segura, JaÃ©n, northeast Andalucia in Spain in February 1947.A talented, skillful andaluz flamenco singer even at the age of nine.
This film is far from a cineastic masterpiece. The story is about Joselito, with a golden voice, that sings to get the money to send his blind friend to America for an operation that will cure her from
blindness.
This film is for nostalgic fans of boy singers. You will find, even if the soundtrack is from 1957,that sweet Joselito was not only cute but he could really sing too!

Dialouge in french and singing in spanish but you will understand the story even if you do not understand french.


Enjoy
