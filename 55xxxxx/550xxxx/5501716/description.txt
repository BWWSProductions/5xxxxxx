PLOT
Dante's Inferno Animated is a real and truthful epic animation film that shows Dante Alighieri's journey through the first part of the afterlife, Inferno. It is a compelling four-quadrant film organized circle by circle in a chronological descent to the center of Hell, and to the exit into Purgatory. Dante's Inferno Animated is recited in primitive Italian in Dante's own words, as well as narrated in English and Spanish for a better understanding in these non-original languages.

Dante is guided by his hero Virgil through each circle of Hell and their subdivisions until they reach the center of the Earth and emerged to the other hemisphere into Purgatory. It features over 50 original color illustrations from the upcoming Dante's Inferno comic book and magazine series, put together in a series of animation clips that will delight a young and mature audiences.
