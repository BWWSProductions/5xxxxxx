Plot: An elite LAPD deep cover unit use extra ordinary tactics to catch their prey. The unit known only to a few at the command level, occasionally cross the line and pull back just in time.

I initially believed this was just another LAPD cop show. I was pleasently surprised that it is not. The show is well acted and has a twisted dynamic among the characters which makes the show quite watchable.

This torrent contains all 10 episodes of the first season.
