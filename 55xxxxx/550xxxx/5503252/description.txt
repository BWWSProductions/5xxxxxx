Anna Bergendahl This Is My Life [Most Likely Eurovision Song Contest Winner 2010]





I go down the beaten track, along the river with an empty bag
At the end she said to me: Why are you here with the autumn leaves?

Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand
No this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else

Im done, tipping on my toes, strike an iron and attack my soul
Misty moon, youre gonna see, Ive got you blues to get on my feet

Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand
No this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else

I dont wanna run; I dont wanna fight
I dont wanna hide; I just wanna stay free, to be me
I dont wanna win; I dont wanna lose
I dont wanna play; I just wanna remember, oh Im my name

Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(This this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand)

No this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else
Cause this is my life, my friend, and
