NOBODY'S DAUGHTER is the first album by Hole in more than a decade (since 1998's three-time Grammy-nominated Celebrity Skin). It also marks Courtney's first record since her solo album America's Sweetheart of 2004 (with "Mono" and "Hold On To Me," both songs co-written with Linda Perry, who co-wrote the bulk of that album's songs with Courtney). 

"This record is about greed, vengeance and feminism," says Courtney Love of the ragged rock songs on her first LP in six years - and the first she'll release with a new incarnation of Hole. Writing began in 2005, while Love was strumming raw folk tunes on an acoustic during a rehab stint. But as the songs developed - with help from producer Michael Beinhorn, Billy Corgan and Linda Perry - Love says, "S**t got darker, I got meaner, and the tracks got hard and big."
