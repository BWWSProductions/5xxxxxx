Thanks for providing this!!!"

,slipknot342,2010-04-19T11:27Z,"Also, she has written many songs by herself and is perfectly capable of doing so."
,PostMortemSleaze,2010-06-14T03:20Z,Americas Sweetheart was a train wreck - even she admitted it. 
,unRheal,2010-09-09T00:24Z,"Ya, I'm thinkin slipknot has a thing for her...

Might be some good songs, but I've seen WAY too much evidence that she killed Kurt to think anything remotely good of her personally!

Three times the lethal dose of heroin in him!

The ""note"" was no suicide note, it was Kurt telling everyone he was leaving the music industry, as the 2nd note she hid clarifies. That's why she won't let the public see it!
