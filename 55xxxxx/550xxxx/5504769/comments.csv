[T],ctang,2010-04-20T19:43Z,"i was reading somewhere that the tracker ""denis.stalker...."" isnt a good tracker and have heard others say its a great tracker...anyone out there have an opinion on it"
[T],ctang,2010-04-21T08:35Z,update: plan on goint to get Avatar tomorrow so it may in fact be next and then The Great Outdoors
,hyster13,2010-04-21T10:03Z,"Hey ctang, your stuff is awesome and keep coming with the good stuff. Since you are taking requests, is it possible to have Independence Day and the Indiana Jones' Quadrilogy?

Thanks for whatever answer you give and keep it up, my man :)"
[T],ctang,2010-04-21T17:30Z,"ya i can get you the ""Jones"" movies...i got all 4 of them...im not sure if i have independence day though, but if i do i will get them"
,hyster13,2010-04-21T23:17Z,"Thanks so much, my man. And once again, keep up the excellent work :)"
[T],ctang,2010-04-21T23:38Z,"new upload plan: Avatar, 4 Indiana Jones movies, Great Outdoors (this only if i dont have any requests or someone can request this so it pans out in this order)"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-22T01:27Z,Hey Ctang. I got you tagged in all my uploads. Sorry it took so long I kind of went away out of town on business for a couple days. I am back now. Let me know if you need any help uploading requests or anything. I to also have the Jones Quad series. If you wanna take all of them no worries I'll upload some others. We should coordinate our uploads a bit... I think that'd be pretty cool.
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T01:50Z,if you want to upload the Jones movies that would be great...i know you can up them all at once while i can only upload one movie at a time because of how slow my max up speed is...i hate it
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T01:54Z,"new updated plan: Avatar, Great Outdoors, Cool Runnings.......

mikemelo1369: what is your upload schedule looking like"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-22T02:23Z,"Well I just uploaded Family Guy Volume 1 Disk 1.

Upcoming uploads: Indiana Jones 1 - 4, Shark Tale, E.T Disk 1 and 2. "
[T],ctang,2010-04-22T05:49Z,"almost all of the torrents i have up say that they dont have any seeders or leachers...this is not true...the main tracker i use is down which is http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce

if you try to download any of the torrents i have up, you will be able to finish them without any problem"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-22T07:31Z,@ Hyster13: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5508044 Here is Raiders of The Lost Arc. I will try and get the other 3 up before the weekend. I'm pretty busy with my day job currently but I shall try my best. Cheers.
