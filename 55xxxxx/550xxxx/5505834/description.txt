Summary: Over two hours of skin bashing, bass pedal stomping, and unrivaled stick-twirling energy is captured here. "Classic Rock Drum Solos" includes rare performance footage and high quality sound of these legendary performances.
Representing the 1960s are the ground-breaking performances of Ginger Baker; Michael Shrieve in his famed outing at Woodstock with Santana, and the only existing footage of rock drumming's first superstar, Sandy Nelson.
