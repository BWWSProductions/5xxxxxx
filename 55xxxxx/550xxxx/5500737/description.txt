As channelled by Lee Carroll for Kryon

Presented in the Kryon "Home Room," here is an amusing channelling about many of the attributes of the New Age, and how they are often seen. Attending this seminar were many world-class facilitators of the very concepts that Kryon discusses. As Kryon said, "sure to offend just about all of them." The teaching is about how we must learn to think differently about what is before us, and how the energy all "knows" who we are.
