A comprehensive resource on the past, present, and future of space technology


Researchers in optics, materials processing, and telecommunications require a reference that can provide a quick study of a number of basic topics in space science. 

The two-volume Encyclopedia of Space Science and Technology represents an ambitious collection of the underlying physical principles of rockets, satellites, and space stations; what is known by astronomers about the sun, planets, galaxy, and universe; and the effect of the space environment on human and other biological systems. 


The Encyclopedia covers a variety of fundamental topics, including:

* A state-of-the-art summary of the engineering involved in launching a rocket or satellite

* The control systems involved on the ground, in orbit, or in deep space

* Manufacturing in space from planetary and other resources


Physicists, astronomers, engineers, and materials and computer scientists, as well as professionals in the aircraft, telecommunication, satellite, optical, and computer industries and the government agencies, will find the Encyclopedia to be an indispensable resource.
