,Dr.Pepper,2010-04-23T05:07Z,"Compared to a non compressed DVD, I would give picture quality 3 points of 6 points possible. It's OK quality.

But why don't you just download the sample, it's around 25MB. "

Watchable, depends on how much you can handle the flickering.. gets pretty annoying."

,DaProle,2010-05-17T01:24Z,"I understand that this is a cam...but it's the first cam I've seen with such a huge flicker problem.  Any lights/ white objects on screen pulsate.  No trails...the audio isn't disastrously tinny...but the flashing made me feel like I was having a sezuire.

A-4/ V-3(Because of the flashing)"
