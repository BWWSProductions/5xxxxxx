The Braverman family is on high alert when Amber's (Mae

takes Adam (Peter Krause) on a road trip for investment 
advice and some father-son bonding. Meanwhile, Julia 
(Erika Christensen) and Joel (Sam Jaeger) worry that 
Sydney (Savannah Paige Rae) might be suffering from 
Asperger's and Crosby (Dax Shepard) wants to help plan 
Jabbar's (Tyree Brown) birthday party.
