West, Bruce and Laing - Why Dontcha? (1972)

Mp3 @192 kbps









Following the exits of bassist/producer Felix Pappalardi and keyboardist Steve Knight, remaining Mountain members Leslie West (guitar)and Corky Laing (drums)forged a new alliance with ex-Cream bassist Jack Bruce.

The hard rock supergroup's debut LP, Why Dontcha, appeared in 1972, followed a year later by Whatever Turns You On. The Bruce, West and Laing trio proved short-lived, however, dissolving prior to the 1974 release of the Live 'n' Kickin' concert set.

Why Dontcha is West, Bruce and Laing's first studio album.

The album features "The Doctor," which received heavy FM radio airplay upon the album's release and became a signature song in live performance for the band. Other noteworthy tracks include "Out Into the Fields," which Jack Bruce continued to perform in concert following West, Bruce and Laing's breakup (and which he re-recorded for his 2002 album Shadows in the Air), and "Love is Worth the Blues," a song loosely based on the chords and structure of The Rolling Stones' "Play With Fire".

Why Dontcha was West, Bruce and Laing's most successful album, reaching #26 on the Billboard U.S. album chart.
