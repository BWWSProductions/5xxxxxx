|*| Dassault Systemes CATIA is a high-end CAD / CAM /CAE software for almost        |*|
|*| everything can be done in virtual product development. CATIA provides powerful  |*|
|*| tools for 2D sketching and 3D modelling, extensive support for mold design and  |*|
|*| machining, and even the possibility of innovation-driven design with product    |*|
|*| analysis and failure prediction tools. Mechanical Design Suite provides products|*|
|*| for intuitive specification driven modeling for Solid, Hybrid and Sheetmetal    |*|
|*| Part design, Assembly design and integrated Drafting.The new Light Manufacturing|*| 
|*| Part Generation product notably enhances productivity and collaboration by      |*|
|*| allowing users to work concurrently on the same composite part, later merging   |*|
|*| and synchronizing separately designed stacks into a single manufactured         |*|
|*| composite part. A new grid-based design methodology automatically generates     |*|
|*| plies by taking each cellGÃ‡Ã–s composite specifications defined during             |*|
|*| simulation and applying composite design best practices.                        |*|
|*|                                                                                 |*|
