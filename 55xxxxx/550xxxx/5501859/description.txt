Charlie "Bird" Parker is one of the giants of 20th century music. Alto saxophonist Parker combined what he had learned from the blues, swing, classical, even country music with a harmonic and rhythmic adventurousness that became known as bebop, becoming one of the greatest soloists in jazz history. 


Many musicians who played with Parker went on to make jazz/music history themselves: Max Roach, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, and Kenny Dorham, among others. THE ESSENTIAL gives a wonderful cross-section of the music Parker recorded for Verve Records from 1946 to 1953. 


You get Bird in quintets with Monk, Buddy Rich, and Dizzy Gillespie ("Relaxing With Lee"), in a wailing jam session with Coleman Hawkins and Buck Clayton ("I Got Rhythm"), fusing bop and Afro-Cuban/Latin music with Machito's big band ("Mango Mangue"), and sailing sweetly with a string section ("Just Friends"). 


Not sure where to start with Parker, or with bebop or post-swing-era jazz? The answer is in this album's title. Recorded  in New York, New York and Los Angeles, California between 1946 and 1953.
