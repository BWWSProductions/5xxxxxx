,DarkerSkies,2010-04-28T02:37Z,The video quality on these Sailo rips is excellent (and yes there is a BUT! ) Sadly the audio quality is bollocks the 5:1 audio drops out throughout the entire film to the point where you can hardly make out any speeech in some scenes.Seems to be prevelant in most of the Sailo rips. Something Sailo you might want to resolve for future uploads Waste of bandwidth in my opinion due to the very bad 5:1 Appreciate all the effort but it`s pointless when the audios qualitys this bad i`ll pass on your up`s from now on seen these audio drop outs in to many of your rips.    
[V],sailo,2010-04-29T21:15Z,"use vlc to watch it on computer and hear the audio  difference, hate these dumb shit who thinks they know it all.
as for your dvd player, its hopeless"
,DarkerSkies,2010-05-02T16:42Z,"A little constructive criticism and i hit a nerve, remember to wash your dummy before you use it again. I`m guessing that your well aware there`s a problem, and you just don`t know how to sort it. But if you like just continue to up rips with shit 5.1.

 Is that the best you can can come up with you little fuck wit, what do you think the VLC media players gonna cover up  the fact all of your uploads have shit 5.1 audio.There are drop outs all throughout these films. Look at the waveform in soundforge.

 You may have a scull and access to some films you little prick but sadly you don`t know what the fuck your doing and the quality on your audio proves it !!!.

There are plenty of other bluray convertions (and i would suggest other use them) and strangely enough none of them have problems with their  5.1 audio JUST YOURS!!.  None of my Demonoid Bluray uploads have any audio problems either, check you shit BEFORE you upload it and waste folks bandwidth. And To be fair it wouldn`t appear to take much to know more than you.

 What a fucking pathetic excuse for shit audio ""use the VLC media player or your kits shit (not even close) others have also i see  noted the same audio problems. unplug your pc. put it back in it`s box. and stick it in the fucking loft until you know how to use it.

Best Regards : DarkerSkies  (Sony BMG Sound engineer) and i definately know                         what talking about ""dumb shit"" "
[V],sailo,2010-05-02T19:21Z,"on the other hand, I love these MPAA folks,
