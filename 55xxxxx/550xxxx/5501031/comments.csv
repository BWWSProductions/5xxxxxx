,k9762,2010-04-18T00:51Z,This is the best show on cable right now
,axen81,2010-04-18T03:40Z,"The show is very current I think. It's appealing in every way. 

Love indeed"
,Zagubadu,2010-04-18T04:20Z,Who cares about 720? I thought that episode 12 was the season finale? That's what they were advertising it as. Well I'm not complaining. Each episode I've downloaded from eztv was fantastic quality.
,Gethyper,2010-04-18T04:36Z,"OMG this episode satisfied all my hunger for blood of those deceiving snakes of the house of Batiatus.....Freaking Exciting !!

Great fucking series man.....can't wait for season 2 man"
,Zagubadu,2010-04-18T06:32Z,Wait is it over now? I dont get how they could continue it. Seems like it ended to quickly. They all got fucking owned.
,ToTheGrind,2010-04-18T12:18Z,"I believe the storyline will be based on the Legatus hunting down the gladiators, Crixus getting navia back and Spartacus will probably look for allies to fight against the romans with as well as getting with Mira.

But however, due to Andy Whitfields (spartacus) condition they might cancel it altogether if not recruiting another person to play spartacus.

Either way the next series is probably years away which sucks, this was most gripping storyline i have ever watched."
,axilleaszz,2010-04-18T19:24Z,thanks
