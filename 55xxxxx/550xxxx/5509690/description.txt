A beautiful night in a beautiful place filled with beautiful people is everything you need to have a great Mule show. Once Warren was finished with the ABB set on the Peach stage he came directly to the Mushroom stage to make sure everyone went back to their home away from home for the night grinnin' ear to ear. The set started with a thunderous version of Pink Floyd's One Of These Days which went right into another Mule-O-Ween '08 treat, Fearless. Next up was a long Blind Man In The Dark intro complete with Warren singing Ain't No Sunshine over the steady build up to a rockin' Blind Man. The jam of the night, a long and winding Trane, covered a lot of territory and eventually found it's way to a moving Sad And Deep As You with Kofi Burbridge adding some chilling flute to the mix. Matt Grondin and his guitar then joined the late night fun on 32/20 Blues. The one - two punch of Broke Down On The Brazos & Mule brought the two hour set to a close. The guys sent everyone back to their tents to the tune of Soulshine.
