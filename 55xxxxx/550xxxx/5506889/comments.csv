which u used to do for many movies in the past.. of 2 - 2.4 gb ??"
,JadeBoy,2010-04-21T18:39Z,"As always, thanks. 

3 Idiots releasing on 18th May...probably you are the better than DDR...please upload H264 1.4 GB file for 3 Idiots, and also an H264 700MB for low bandwidth users. 

Please, dont go on Xvid. Because, if they are downloading this, then probably they have a computer(duh!), then they can also convert it to Xvid for a DivX player.

Personally I download and upload at night...BSNL  :)"
