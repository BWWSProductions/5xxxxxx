The Eustace Brothers (2003) Episodes 4-6

This 6 part TV drama series about three brothers who run an auction warehouse in Nottingham. The first series originally aired in 2002 as Paradise Heights. Sadly a new season was not to be, perhaps deemed not as successful as it should have been but I enjoyed it, finding it very entertaining.

I recorded this through the PC at the time it aired but the copy isn't brilliant as the Dazzle unit I used in those days wasn't too hot.
However it is watchable on the PC (just about) and it was never released on DVD to my knowledge.
This offering presents the final three episodes 
Enjoy and please ensure you help to seed this if indeed there are any takers in the first place.
