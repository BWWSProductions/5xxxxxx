skip the first cutscene
fast forward
when u r fighting the last guy, u hve to lose to the last guy.dont do this and instead, fight and win the last guy. when u win, the game will load and u will be killed by santo an be spawned at tthe hospital.
save the game and play the mission again, this time take a dive when fighting the last guy.
