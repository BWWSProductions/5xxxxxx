Reviews:

"This massive volume covers all aspects of marine mammals, with the topics alphabetically arranged for ease of use. The 283 articles contained here were expressly commissioned for this volume, and represent the most scientifically accurate and current science available on marine mammals. The encyclopedia is generously illustrated with photographs (including 16 pages of color plates), anatomical line drawings, charts, and figures. It is extensively referenced to the scientific literature, with approximately 3000 bibliography entries, and the appendix includes biographies of famous scientists and a definitive listing of all known marine mammals. This text is sure to be an invaluable reference on marine mammals for a large audience of researchers, students at all levels, and the general public."
