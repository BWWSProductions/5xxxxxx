"Use Me" is a song composed and originally recorded by Bill Withers, and was included on his 1972 album Still Bill. It is his second-biggest hit in the United States, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA.


The singer complains about the advice of friends, who seem to have made it "their appointed duty" to talk the singer out of a romantic relationship that they see as one-sided, and where the singer is "used". But the singer has no doubt in wanting things to continue as they are, and implies that it is pleasurable enough to be "used" in that fashion that being "used up" completely would be welcome.

The singer goes on to describe telling a relative who urges resistance to being "walked on", that envy for the singer's circumstances would follow from really comprehending them.

The singer admits that some of the lover's behavior is abusive -- for example, snubs when those of higher status, whom the lover apparently seeks to curry favor with, are present -- but "when you love me", the singer "can't get enough".

Finally, as the song fades out, the singer admits to being used, but says that "it aint too bad the way you're using me, 'cause I sure am using you to do the things you do."
