Very rare and unknown game, by Midas Interactive Entertainment. The steering part is verry difficult, I believe you use the following keys:

Q - Escape
S - Break
E - Eat
O - Left
P - Right

Use Daemon Tools to mount this Nero CD Image. Use Dosbox to run the game.

This game is so rare, it even has no profile on mobygames.
