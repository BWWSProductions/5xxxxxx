The Asteroid #4 (alternatively spelled The Asteroid No. 4) is a from Philadelphia and have been releasing records and touring consistently since the later half of the 1990s. Rooted deep in psychedelic music, specifically that of the 1960s and early 1990s British bands, A4 has never shyed away from wearing their influences firmly on their sleeves. Dabbling in everything from Anglo-induced guitar pop to the "Cosmic American" sounds of vintage L.A. country-rock outfits, the band has never lost site of it's goals, which was to become themselves.
