[V],globeplus,2010-04-19T01:48Z,"thank you for your comments and basically no tv , you still listen radios and having all the gameplay in both episodes , this is a kind of gigantic file in size , to manage to get this size keeping a decent gameplay wasn´t a easy task but well it´s done and to khalid this is another game and the pirate bay is full of cracks and emulator servers or launchers that you can work around inside the file to have your game running . thank you ."
,Ezlin,2010-04-19T04:38Z,"Ok, I can live without TV. Thanks."
,xtracrossxx,2010-04-19T09:12Z,oh and globe thanx for this rip but the vids r also encoded at 60% rite??
[V],globeplus,2010-04-19T09:23Z,"Now is addicionated a link to improve the script speech of the missions inside the episodes , this files are not essencial to the gameplay but can be nice read more subtitles talk playing the missions (371.57 mb) . Remember everyone , that this is a gigantic file in size and i worked everything that was possible keeping a nice gameplay , beside that i can recognize that little things that are not real important to the gameplay can be improved and is in that perspective , always respecting the users more as possible doing the competent necessary work that is needed , that i am uploading this update . Thank you for understanding the correct analysis needed to work this file ."

i never watched any videos in gta4
subtitles? i can understand what are they saying

and i dont have to download too much with my crappy internet XD"
,xtracrossxx,2010-04-19T21:18Z,hmm i guess the just cause 2 torrent aint soo bad bt most of his other torrents suck!!!almost all hav vids removd or recoded at 30% and dats a whole lot of useless!!
[V],globeplus,2010-04-20T00:52Z,"It is some guys that never stop loosing a opportunity to try to say bad things about my files no matter what for trying making a point with his bullshit files , i did the correct work no doubt and i don´t have to give satisfactions to piece of shit guys that don´t respect the uploaders , your intention is trying to denegrate the file once more , the fact is you are far way to make a correct analysis in a file and present an appropriate work for more users as possible independtly of the speed of the internet connection they have , this file was a long work and very tough but i get the correct work because both episodes are fully playable in a nice way , little things that don´t influenciate the gameplay maybe missing but in a file with this extension that is secondary , i am asking myself when this guys disappear from putting comments in my files once for all , i never go to the bullshit files of them putting annoying comments , why they insist in coming to my files doing this ? Easy , they simply can´t do a better work , the best thing they can do is trying to criticise the work in files that they know because his carachteristics the uploader need probably to make some adjustments to present a nice size file under the circunstances .

,xtracrossxx,2010-04-20T10:41Z,"@globe:ya i didnt readanythin u said!,cmon mna admit u neva bitch about TPTB  cuz u noe your rips are inferior.i would have left u alone if u didnt lie!!!:@:@u said only tv was removed but so was subtitles and the vids it self!"

,MakMan06,2010-04-20T12:48Z,"Globe, I respect you and your torrents man, I'm still downloading, but I'm sure it will work great just like the rest of them, i.e. your Left 4 Dead 2 rip was excellent! One thing though, has the cutscene speech been ripped? Or just the subtitles?

And, people bitching about Globe's rips - shut up already! They always work if you know what you're doing, plus the file sizes are smaller too, which is great for people with crappier connections. Sometimes Shroo's rips are a little too big for me, i.e. Globe's Just Cause 2 is half the size of Shroo's!"
,Pothead808,2010-04-20T18:03Z,"Followed every instruction but i dont get dialog (characters just stand there) during some cutscenes, or if im calling someone on a mission..walking with someone ect. and now im on a mission where it wont progress because tony wont speak. halp please"
[V],Shroo,2010-04-20T18:24Z,"THE GAME WONT WORK! simply because this GTA is different from the first that came all files have to be in tact for the game to work flawlessly, the game has database with all registered files and their sizes if there is a miss mach simply you fucked, so WAIT FOR A PROPER version from us which will come out very soon.

[V],globeplus,2010-04-21T01:26Z,"Shroo , stop putting comments in my files , you are a really annoying guy sounding repetitive without no real point in what you are saying beside that you want to pass the idea that you can have some bullshit file that probably don´t takes anywhere , disappear once for all of putting comments in my files it is the best you can do . To the users that i don´t really know if it is true that they are having a reg problem is really read the instructions inside the file to heve everything ok , if you are counting evrything ok without reading the instructions you probably don´t run the game . ok , that´s all and what a fantastic couple of gta episodes we have here to play ... have fun ..."
,Ezlin,2010-04-21T03:38Z,"I haven't played this rip so I have no clue if what Shroo is saying is correct, but globe, does this rip use the RELOADED crack? If not that may be worth trying. I am just gonna get the fucking huge ISO."
[V],globeplus,2010-04-21T04:04Z,"Well , thank you Ezlin for your honesty , i think without lies or pressuposts to give borring doubts to the possible users with the only objective to the prejudicate more as possible a really well done pratical file for this game is better , i don´t know about cracks byt the reg is really easy to apply , you simply get the the game like the installation was finished at that precise moment , so reg or cracks secondary subject , if work it is what really matter , this file is 6.66 gb so it is for shore a valid option to who like to download pratical files with nice gameplay , i know that is 13 , 14 and close 17 gb files out there , i have a valid option for a pratical file for this game and the users like that , first having the originals with full size then sooner as possible nice pratical files that they can opt too . It is ok everything and thank you for your comment and remember that alimentating lies is not the best option , you feel more free and with more dignity if you have a correct analysis of things ."
,abhishekbaurai,2010-04-21T07:17Z,globeplus has been giving gr8 rips to all of us he reduces the size of the game for those wid low bandwidths.....his rip has always worked for me and i must say he does his job well...dat dis rip is also gud...but rite now the seed level is too low for me to download this stuff...

,MakMan06,2010-04-22T10:56Z,"Instead of being another mindless fucker complaining SEED SEED FUCKING SEED!!!!!, I propose a system: we'll all get this file a lot faster if people stop being greedy and turning off their upload limits! I'm ~20% done, and currently have a ratio of 1.335 since for the last day I've been uploading my portion at (full speed for me) 25KB/s, while having my download fluctuating from 0.3KB/s to 1.2KB/s!

This isn't acceptable - if we all set our upload limits in uTorrent to 'Unlimited', we'd all get this 6GB file in less time than it'd take to download the 16GB version! At the moment, it'd be quicker for me to get the 16GB version - until I break my monthly download limit!"

,wilmar60,2010-04-24T19:17Z,can someone please post the inscrutions i dont have them and when i downloaded it again i had the same but globe your torrents are great
,MakMan06,2010-04-25T02:24Z,"Sure, here they are, straight from Globe:

1 - extract the arc file in the folder

2 - move the extracted folder to C:\Programs Files or Program Files (x86)
    your normal folder where you make the install of the games in the computer

3 - run the GLOBE converter.exe , it will take close an hour to convert
    but the time you loose to make the conversion you win in the torrents
    in the download with close probably a giga less in the final size

    - in the end of the conversion the globe extension files will disappear
      and a nice music will play in your default mp3 player

4 - when the work ends is neede a couple of actions to really have the game ready to go :

    1 - go to the episodes audio folders folder then move the audio folder of each
        episode to the respective episode next location : the TBoGT audio folder go
        to the TBoGT\pc folder and the audio folder is putted just like it is inside this folder
        the TLAD audio folder go to the TLAD\pc folder just like it is and that´s it
        the audio is now correct in both episodes

    2 - for 64 bit users run the x64 reg and the 32 bit run the x86 reg , note
        that you can edit the reg files with right click mouse and confirm if the path
        of the game is the correct one correspondent to your computer

        example : using a 64 bit , the installfolder after edition is :
                  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rockstar Games\\Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes From Liberty City\\EFLC

                  so , if you normal install your games in programs (x86) folder the reg will be appropriated ,
                  in case that the name of the folder where is installed the game is different then 
                  change where it is Program Files (x86) for the name of the folder of location where
                  you install the game 

5 - ok , after that couple of moves the game folder and the game is ready to go , so
    start the game with LaunchEFLC.exe

6 - PLAY THE GAME !!!"

Thanks! The game running great now! only i got one thing idk if its a bug or something but when playing TBoGT in the club when dancing with a girl, the girl and Luis freeze but al the other ppl from the club are dancing, it seems like the animations of the players are frozen. how to fix this?"
,arianajdari,2010-04-28T07:26Z,nikob - To fix reg problem you need first to copy location of where the EFLC folder is. Then you need to open registry files and paste the location of the EFLC. There are 4 places I guess. Also make sure to make doubleslash like the previous location (example C:\\Games\\EFLC) Apply reg fix and know should work 100 %. 
,naturalcause420,2010-04-28T09:30Z,ya im sure i copyed the folders right but alas still same thing guess it dont matter since im buying the game monday but was hopeing to get a idea if i realy wanted to buy this 1 or another 1 oh well ty anyway

,MakMan06,2010-05-01T02:58Z,"Playing through the game, I notice that a couple of the radio stations (Vice City FM and Self Actualisation FM) don't appear to work. I also see that there are no pedestrian voices either. In future (or you can add to current description), it would be nice if you defined what was actually ripped, like Skullptura, Dopeman and TPTB do/did. For example, in the description you could write - RIPPED: TV, Pedestrian Voices, Vice City FM and Self Actualisation radio stations.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on you, and this is a fantastic rip, you've done an excellent job - but I'm just trying to help you increase the user experience so in the future you won't get anymore bad votes, or people writing bullshit comments.

No matter which disk,C or D or even G. Just leave everything the same from the rockstar games location. I mean,you must follow it,because it won't work.F.e. if you have your EFLC folder in C disk,program files and you have x32 win,so it will be in
 ""C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Rockstar Games\\Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes From Liberty City\\EFLC"" just make it proper. after edit,save, and later double click it -yes. This is how i did.Reg changing is the most important part of it,try to edit with admin if u need to edit xD

I am in complete agreeance with that mak dude about your info though.. Ripping radio station and pedestrian sfx would be worth alerting us to. Still, free shit so I can't complain..

I was wondering, now I have everything going, how hard would it be to pack those radio station and people sfx into a handy archive like you did with the mission sfx addon?

That would be awesome, I'm sure we could all appreciate that as an optional final touch. Okay, Thanks anyway man.

And for those who are having crash at the beginning of the game even before logos, your registry file is corrupted. So, you just have to modify it. 

This is also for the people who have problem playing episodes which when clicking on a episode says it is a downloadable content. "
,bugs3214,2011-03-30T20:28Z,"globeplus you forgot to mention the correct required space. People, you need atleast 30 gb for the full extraction apart from the downloaded files."

Finally found the solution.
In ""Momma's Boy""  mission after taking a dive don't skip the cutscene and press Home key. GFWL will appear. Browse it until the cutscene ends and the loading screen. After this you will have no problem. Even after doing this if you have problem i can give the save game.

,Kashxk,2011-11-12T19:05Z,Took about 30mins to extract From .arc and 1h30 to extract From the Globe converter. Make Sure you have about 40GB on the drive you'll be copying the game folder after the .arc extraction. This is only the Episodes From Liberty City WithOut GTA IV Main game. I only tested it/ played about 15mins. Win7 Ultimate x64.
,dandalis,2011-11-14T17:36Z,hope this works.
,dandalis,2011-11-14T18:45Z,damn its slow.
,dandalis,2011-11-17T17:12Z,"i did everthing step by step like it was asked corectly, but all i get after launching is black screen and app crash."
,killing_nihilist,2011-11-20T17:33Z,"Folks, I solved the problem of the ""Black Screen Of Death"".
It is not fault of the Globe, but the Live.
The Live needs to be readapted.
First, create the folder ""C:/Program files/ Rockstar Games/Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City"" and move the game. Download and install it:

Update 1.1: http://www.m*e*g*a*u*p*l*o*a*d*.com/?d=I3T6H5Z3
Update 1.2: http://www.m*e*g*a*u*p*l*o*a*d*.com/?d=UDS6KC4I
- remove the (*) -
Attention: Install the 1.1 update and then Update1.2.
I hope comments.
Enjoy. Thanx."

I Can't Extract the .arc file!!! i downloaded freearc TWICE from two different sites, and i've spent the better part of a day trying over and over again,  i've ran it as administrator, changed the destination folder, and done everything else i could think of, but it never fully extracts, the most i got was three empty folders, and the two registration files. i'm using windows 7 32 bit, which is supposed to be compatible with this game,but it just seems to stop extracting halfway through or something, plez help a soon as possible!!!! thanks."

,TheVoidBR,2012-04-16T08:19Z,"Hey guys, guess I've found the solution for the MU file....
Look for this torrent: 'Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City full SteamRIP crack' n download only the audio files needed. They are: EP1 SPEECH.rpf / EP1 SCRIPTED SPEECH.rpf / EP2 SPEECH.rpf / EP2 SCRIPTED SPEECH.rpf. This torrent is slow, but, would be faster then download the whole game again.....
PS: I've not tested yet.... is just a guess"
,TheVoidBR,2012-04-17T17:35Z,Hey pals.... just tried my given solution.... working like a charm...
