Thanks for the encode/upload.

I LOVE QUARK.

Cheers
Jon

P.S. I watch my quark(s) on 32"" LCD via HDMI from PS3.
No conversion required.
Just start file as normal and [PAUSE] immediately. 
Then open [OSD] and choose [Slow (Forward)].
A/V quality is about 8+ compared to a normal 20-40 file.
But the compression is unbelievable.

@ALL - PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20-40 - You are Legend!"
