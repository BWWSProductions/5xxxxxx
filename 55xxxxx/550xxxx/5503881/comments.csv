[V],twentyforty,2010-04-20T10:50Z,"@zmacdaddy8: I am big fan of Ms. Fey, of SNL crew in any appearance or shape and... I downloaded in past three days ALL versions of Telesync for ""Date Night"" - and they are all (let speak openly) - a garbage. I wasted over 2.8 GB for download, and when something decent comes out, I would re-encode it. But, judging from all three TS (even if one lies about the source) which use ELEKTRIKA's ""pumping-flicker"" crap and boldly was watermarked by morons who have encoded that. They have over-boosted colors so much, ""flickering"" is un-removable and I will wait probably R5 or even DVDrip - for sake of my own sanity..."

@Jon: Thanks."
