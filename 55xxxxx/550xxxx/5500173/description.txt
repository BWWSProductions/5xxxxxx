Biotechnology introduces students in science, engineering, or technology to the basics of genetic engineering, recombinant organisms, wild-type fermentations, metabolic engineering and microorganisms for the production of small molecule bioproducts. 


The text includes a brief historical perspective and economic rationale on the impact of regulation on biotechnology production, as well as chapters on biotechnology in relation to metabolic pathways and microbial fermentations, enzymes and enzyme kinetics, metabolism, biological energetics, metabolic pathways, nucleic acids, genetic engineering, recombinant organisms and the production of monoclonal antibodies.
