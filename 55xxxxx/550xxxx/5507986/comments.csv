,Dakota85,2010-04-22T07:28Z,Is anyone else having trouble getting some of these torrents to download? They keep coming up as 0-0 and not downloading ... it seems to only be piratebay ??
,elax666,2010-04-22T08:13Z,"Thank U, thank U 4 finally having a No rar release on TvTeam. Finally I can take part in that good and excellent work U do, so thanks yet again and keep it up!"
,ninline,2010-04-22T15:42Z,I don't get all the hate for rar files.  I don't really care one way or the other if they are or aren't rar'ed but really what's the problem?  It takes like a few seconds to unrar on any computer built in the last 5 years.  I swear there are so many crybabies on PB.
,csherred,2010-04-22T15:43Z,"Hey elax666 winrar is a free download, so whether is rar free or not u should be able to watch from tv team. i read comments from others on how to use it and then downloaded it and have been watching rar shows ever since, they are faster downloads."
,elax666,2010-04-22T18:39Z,"The reason why I don´t like rar is that I watch all my favourite show on my PS3 and HD-tv, not in my office where the computer is. And yes, I know, I can probably fix and trix and connect my HD-tv 2 my computer but believe me I have a reason 4 not doing that 2. I guess all the rar-""haters"" r in the same position as I.... They all watch their series or movies on their PS3 or DVD:s. Just using their computer and office 2 DL, not using it as a livingroom. If that makes us haters so be it, right know I´m just thankful that TvTeam has provided all PS3 users with an excellent option that´s NOT a rar. ;P"
,elax666,2010-04-22T18:53Z,csherred: Thank U 4 the tip even though I already use it when I´m in my homeoffice/guestroom. =)

To Dakota85: Yeah looks like tracker http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce  was offline for a while.  

I manually added the tracker http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce to my download and it wizzed right along.

Anyways...looks like the usual trackers are all up and running."
