The automotive industry underwent great change in the 1960s and the early 1970s before the gas crisis. The continuing trend toward market consolidation, the proliferation of sizes and nameplates and categories of automobiles, and the "need for speed" characterized this period, which may be loosely labeled the muscle car era.



This is an exhaustive reference work to American made cars of model years 1960â€“1972. Organized chronologically (and summarizing the market annually), it provides a yearly update on each makeâ€™s status and production figures, then details all models offered for that year.



Model listings include available body styles, base prices, engine and transmission choices, power ratings, standard equipment, major options and their prices, curb weight and dimensions (interior and exterior), paint color choices, changes from the previous yearâ€™s model, and sales figures. Also given are assembly plant locations and historical overviews of each model nameplate.



The book is profusely illustrated with 1,018 photographs.
