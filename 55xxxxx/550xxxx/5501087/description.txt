The Cantores Minores, the Helsinki Cathedral Boys' Choir, was founded in December 1952 by Finnish pastor Tarmo Nuotio and Finnish-American Dr. Ruth-Esther HillilÃ¤. The Cantores Minores represents the rare type of Protestant boys' choirs holding the great German choirs such as Bach's Thomanerchor in Leipzig and 
SchÃ¼tz's Kreuzchor in Dresden as its models
