Publisher: Facts on File | 2009 | ISBN: 0816072035 | PDF | 206 pages

It is difficult to identify a defining moment that turned the tide toward less-polluting energy sources, but most people today have a fresh outlook on the environment and realize the importance of conservation. In recent years, a new community of people who want alternative energies for their cars, public vehicles, and houses has emerged. "Renewable Energy" reviews the current status of technologies in renewable energy, a critical subject since the world now increases its energy consumption between 1 to 3 percent each year. Covering the current rate of energy consumption and the consequences of continuing this rate, this new book explains how the main conventional forms of energy - including coal, oil, and gas - contribute to economies. The focus of this full-color book is the remarkable diversity of ideas that are born every day in the field of alternative energy. 
The chapters include:
Earth's Energy Sources; 
Recycling
Gasoline Alternative Vehicles
Biorefineries
Innovations in Clean Energy
Green Building Design and
Energy from Solid Biomass.
