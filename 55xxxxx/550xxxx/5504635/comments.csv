missing:
-I am the bloody earth
-Symphonaire Infernus Et Spera Empyrium
-The Thrash of the Naked Limbs
(and some 7""s i never found)
This is like THE best stuff of MDB! (for me it all went down after Turn Loose the Swans)"

,shimmerknight,2011-11-26T20:00Z,Have most of these on cd... but this saves me the trouble of ripping them. THNX :)
,ClosedEyeVisuals,2011-12-13T17:30Z,These tags need to be worked on. A lot.
,classymusicsnob,2012-02-01T07:07Z,"This is an incredibly incomplete discography. The tags also need to be worked on. Thanks for providing, but for future reference make sure the tags are correct and do a bit more research on a artist's disco, Cheers mate."
