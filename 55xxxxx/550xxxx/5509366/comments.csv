[V],twentyforty,2010-04-23T12:18Z,"@htctouch: Sorry to inform you, but there is nothing wrong with file I have.
I have watched exact same place you have described - and found funny little banana-like fellow saying ""... opposite"" and whole crowd laughed on that...
Further, there are no ""glitches"" or ""jerkiness"" of any kind, both video and audio.
I tip on some background process on your PC (like anti-virus popped-in in some scheduled task or something similar).
And please - I do understand your troubles with English (as I have them all the time) but - try to say MY COPY has problems or MY PC has problems - not as you just did.
People are paranoid enough to ""misread"" your writing - and people do not look for the problems in their own backyard first - then tell to the world..."
