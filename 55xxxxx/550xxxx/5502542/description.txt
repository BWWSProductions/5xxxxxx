The Rolling Stones - Plundered My Soul (Exile On Main St. [1972])


An unreleased track from the  Exile on Main St sessions.





A recently unearthed Rolling Stones track has been released as a limited edition 7" single for Record Store Day.

Plundered My Soul was recorded during sessions for the band's sprawling 1972 double album Exile On Main Street, but was left to languish in the vaults.

The group rediscovered the track while preparing a reissue of the album, which is due to be released on 18 May.

Just 1,000 copies were pressed for Record Store Day on 17 April, held to promote independent music stores. - BBC
