http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5492859/Assassin_s_Creed_2_Launcher_-_Play_AC2_The_Easy_Way_V1.15
Oh,and I dont understand the errors people are having,I`m far into the game and I`ve had no errors so far.Best you can do anyways is run the .exe,update it one time,disconnect from your game,close internet and then re-start the game."

,Ninja_Ice,2011-01-03T02:04Z,"F8CK!!!! (excuse my language...)

I wanted to start afresh, uninstall my AC2 and reinstall from iso, the BS razor1911 crack didn't work.

But I was lazy and just deleted AC2 and ubisoft, now i can't f8cking uninstall it, meaning i can't install it!!!

In my panic I deleted other files as well (in temp and windows)
