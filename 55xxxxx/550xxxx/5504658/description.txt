This Australian six part mini-series focuses on the struggles of both the Roman Catholic nuns and the young students to adapt to the many social changes taking place within the church and the outside world during the 1960s.

The show focuses on the main character ; Diane, a young woman growing up in Australia, who walks away from her fiancÃ© to join a convent after being sure she has a calling to the faith.

She has to decide if she can teach what the Church preaches, or if it's simply impossible for her to reconcile all the contradictions of the faith and uphold her vow of obedience.

The show deals with the sensitive issues of Divorce, Abortion, Promiscuousness, Teen Pregnancy, Love, and dares to suggest that perhaps catholic doctrine is not always right. 

Show is in 4:3 Aspect Ratio
