This documentary follows high-flying comedy duo Cheech
Marin and Tommy Chong as they reunite for their
long-anticipated Light Up America tour, crisscrossing the
country and playing to sold-out audiences. Featuring
riotous new material as well as classic bits from their
1970s and '80s heyday, the film also includes
laugh-out-loud performances from Chong's wife, Shelby.
Christian Charles (Comedian) directs.
