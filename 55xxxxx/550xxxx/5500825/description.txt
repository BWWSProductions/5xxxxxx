(from back cover):

Cliff Burton's first ever show with Metallica recorded by the band on open air reel to reel on May 5th, 1983.

Never before circulated on LP or CD!

The line-up includes: Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) on guitar, James Hatfield (sp) on vocals, Lars Ulrich on drums and Cliff Burton on bass.
