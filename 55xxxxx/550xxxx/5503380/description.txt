-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protection Against astat Flooding Exploit
When a player joins a game their stats are automatically displayed for you with a /astat server command, so the exploit works by a player forcing you to do many /astat server commands on them within 1 second, causing you to get a temp IP ban from battle.net. My protection will fix this, still allow stats of players to show and alert you if the exploit was used.
