This is my first album, entitled "Open-Source Rhymes." It's nerdcore hip-hop with topics ranging from piracy to videogames and Billy Mays.
For more information, visit bitbuccaneer.com. Let me know what you think, and spread the word =]

Also, I can't include my release notes in this torrent due to the fact that no .rtf files can be in there, but credit should be given where it is due, so I'll just copy and post them here.

Hey, thanks for downloading my album! I've included all 20 tracks as well as album art and lyrics, so if you didn't get all of that, you didn't get the whole download. 
You can get it from bitbuccaneer.com

First off, I'd like to thank Sleaze (@Sleaze, sleaze.bandcamp.com) for the fantastic beats he provided for this album. I could not have done this without his great work, so thank you Sleaze. I really appreciate it.
In fact, Sleaze made 19 of the 20 beats on this album. The only one that he didn't make kinda sticks out like a sore thumb (which is "In A Word"), because it's just something I threw together real quick-like.
Thank you again, Sleaze.

I would also like to thank Emory Dunn (@emorydunn, emorydunn.com) for the album's artwork. The artwork is one of the first impressions that is made on a potential listener, and you've helped make a great first impression.

I can't believe this album is finally completed. It tookâ€¦ Roughly a year, I believe, for all of this to be written, recorded, and touched-up. This is the first music project I've ever been a part of that I've worked this hard on and actually came up with something.

Anyway, enough of this. I'm releasing an album, not a novel. Enjoy the music. Spread it around, it's free! And if you have any feedback or questions, you can contact me at
