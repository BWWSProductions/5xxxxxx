Musical style

Their music, which can be described as a humorous mix of synth-pop, new wave, electronica, punk rock and pop music, tends to embody a retro-hip European 1960s mod style, with references to that period evident in their music. Some songs evoke a mod/psych/garage-rock vibe, both in production aesthetic and lyrical content, along with 1960s French-pop, in the vein of FranÃ§oise Hardy. Some of their tracks are playful, low-fi versions of pop, rock and soul songs that employ the use of analogue recording equipment and reverberation. In that vein, they made a pop version of Salt-N-Pepa's electro rap hit "Push It".

Their songs are often sung in in German, French and English, but some of their output also features a number of other languages, such as Japanese, Spanish and Turkish. The band has covered songs by Sylvie Vartan, FranÃ§oise Hardy, Brigitte Bardot, Serge Gainsbourg, Johnny Hallyday, Velvet Underground, Nico, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Pizzicato Five, Hot Chocolate, Die TÃ¶dliche Doris and KC and the Sunshine Band.
