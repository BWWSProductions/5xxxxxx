This mini-series is compiled into the pilot and two telemovies featuring the best of the series. Ma and Pa Larkin are a prosperous farming family whose relative wealth seems to come from Pop Larkin's ability to dodge the Inland Revenue Service and his ability to wheel and deal in army surplus items.


Throughout these series there are a number of plots going on simultaneously however to summarise; part 2 is about a German soldier who arrives in their quaint Kent town and the reception he receives from post-WWII England is frosty to say the least. 

The third part is about the Larkin twins going to a dilapitated boarding school and Pop Larkin's quest against the bank foreclosing on that school. Zeta Jones and her husband also want to buy the local brewery. A much loved family show.
