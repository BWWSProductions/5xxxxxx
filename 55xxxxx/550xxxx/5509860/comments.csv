From the Saturday Evening Post series ""The Chisholm Trail,"" by Borden Chase, this is ""The Great Trail Drive Western."" Directed by Howard Hawks and edited by long-time associate Christian Nyby (who is credited with directing Hawks' seminal sci-fi classic ""The Thing (From Another World)""), the film boasts a stand-out cast and a typically superb musical score by the great Dimitri Tiomkin (who also scored ""The Thing""). One technical flaw common to many Westerns is the use of the 1873 Colt ""Peacemaker,"" long before they were introduced.

Though the film was completed in 1946, it was not released until September of 1948. In 1990, Red River was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

The quality of this upload is as outstanding as the picture itself."
