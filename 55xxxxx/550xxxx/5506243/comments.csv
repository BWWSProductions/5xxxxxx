,Rudy_Eila,2010-04-21T13:36Z,"BTW... For those who wonder about Dark_Isle... he isn't as bad as we think.... he doesn't actually spoil the show... He gives false spoilers... like on last episode I read a part of his comment by mistake which was "" OMG I can't believe hurley turned the wheel again"" So I started cursing for reading that part and when I was watching the episode I kept thinking in how could what he said happen.. but at the end it didn't happen... so he just gives false spoilers..."

,poosad,2010-04-22T14:42Z,"Let's say now dark-isle is not with us but his/her spirit never dies!!
when i first watch this episode, i could not Blive that Jack is actually Jacob! and he killed Sawyer because of Kate (she is holding one of theirs baby) and he became regretful when he found out Kate' baby is Christian's !!!! Jack plays us all."

,matchstalkman,2010-04-23T08:50Z,"Many thanks again for this quality upload.

""If it ain't got [eztv] on the box, it ain't by [eztv].""

I can shed some light on Dark_isle... Charles Widmore had dark_isle transported to the island."

,frivalousMC,2010-04-28T01:30Z,"Thanks EZTV !!! Your getting me through University without paying for Cable woot woot....Oh by the way Dark_Isle has never actually spoiled an episode, he always posts fake spoilers to get you little nerdlings all worked up and I personally think its hilarious...Keep em comin Dark !!!"
,tamosswiny,2010-04-28T17:08Z,"The latest episode aired yesterday, but i am unable to find it. Can someone explain why? I don't mean to be rude. But normally i can download the torrent a couple houres after it aired. And i can't watch the episode on ABC because i am from belgium. So help would be appriciated."
,echo873,2010-04-28T21:01Z,"@tamosswiny, No it didn't. ""The Candidate"" will ""air"" May 4 (after one more week).

I'm guessing to give them more time. E.g. with the acting which really isn't the best possible performance depending on the episode."
,echo873,2010-04-29T22:05Z,Based on the types of this dark_isle's comments I'd say he's just so full of sh*t that it's not even funny.
,zuriki,2010-05-02T19:11Z,wheres the next episode ppl 
,ton88,2010-05-03T10:35Z,Hey guys where is episode 14 its al ready out on hbo
,13ds,2010-05-04T17:17Z,I think Lost season 6 episodes had the largest amount of seeders and leechers ever when released. At one point episode 13 had 40k+ seeders and 80k+ leechers.
,TheBlackRider,2010-05-05T06:40Z,no wayy! kate kills Jack !! wtf. MIB is whidmore's son ! omfgz
,TheBlackRider,2010-05-05T06:43Z,ZOINK sorry had to fill in for dark isle no one else seemed to be doing
