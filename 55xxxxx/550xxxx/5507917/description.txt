The Adventures of Tintin â€“ Tintin in Tibet

Tintin in Tibet is said to have been HergÃ©'s favourite of the Tintin series, and was written during a personally difficult time in his life, as he was divorcing with his first wife. The story is unlike any previous Tintin books, before or since: there are only a small number of characters and no enemies, villains, spies or gangsters. This adventure revolves around a rescue mission of Tintin's Chinese friend Chang Chong-Chen.
