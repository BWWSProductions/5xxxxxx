Fifa Soccer '96, the first Fifa with an attempt to provide 3D graphics with the Virtual Stadium. The gameplay is still very good and the teams from that time are classics now!

Nero CD Image, use Daemon Tools to mount. Then use the newest Dosbox to play the game. The game runs just fine.

This full cd version includes all commentary by John Motson and all game music.

One annoying thing is that you can do the rainbow kick with Alt + Enter, which also toggels full screen/windows in Dosbox. But that's the only problem.
