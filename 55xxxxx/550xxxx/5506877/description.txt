"The Power of Madonna"
Mr. Schuester is concerned that the girls in the glee club 
are being disrespected and bullied by the guys. Looking to 
Madonna and her musical message of equality as inspiration 
he challenges the entire team to choose Madonna songs as 
their next assignment in the hopes that the girls embrace 
her strength, independence and confidence and that the 
guys will see the error of their misogynistic ways. The 
glee club takes the assignment to heart as they perform 
some of Madonna's greatest hits, including "Express 
Yourself" and "Like A Prayer." Meanwhile, Kurt and 
Mercedes give Sue a vote of confidence with a makeover 
that is definitely in "Vogue".
Enjoy :)
