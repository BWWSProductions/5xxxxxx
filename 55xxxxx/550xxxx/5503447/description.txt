Lightnin' Slim (born, Otis Hicks, 1913-1974), was an American blues musician (the acknowledged kingpin of the Louisiana school of blues). Lightnin' Slim moved from Missouri (where he was born) to Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the age of thirteen. Taught guitar by his older brother Layfield, Slim was playing in bars in Baton Rouge by the late 1940s.
He debuted on J. D. 'Jay' Miller's Feature Records label in 1954 with 'Bad Luck' ('If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all'). Slim then recorded for Excello Records for twelve years, starting in the mid 1950s, often collaborating with his brother-in-law, Slim Harpo and with harmonica player Lazy Lester.

In the 1970s Slim performed on tours in Europe, both in the United Kingdom and at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, where he was often accompanied by Moses 'Whispering' Smith on harmonica.

Blue Lightning is one of his European albums and one of his last. He is playing on stage in London, in the early '70s, and is backed up by one outstanding band! The harp player, is nothing short of excellent, and Lightnins' little asides between the songs, make you feel like you know the guy. This is not one of these 'sessions', where the blues singer goes overseas and is playing with a bunch of rock musicians, but rather a live performance, in a theatre in London, UK.
