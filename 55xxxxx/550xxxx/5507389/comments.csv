,kaliver,2010-04-26T06:30Z,"thanks for upping this. what hysterical theories. rofl

don't think they intended this to be comedy."
,nuclear_j,2010-04-28T02:26Z,"Hysterical theories or not, one thing we can all agree on is that none of this can be explained by conventional science.  While you describe the theories presented in the documentary as ""hysterical"", conventional science's theories to explain these phenomena is thin at best.  I think the best thing about this is that it will open you're mind to new ways of looking at the world.  Unless you are a stubborn know-it-all, then this would just piss you off."
,lxl3lindxl,2010-04-29T09:58Z,Saw Episode 2 the other day but I missed some of it. any Idea when that may be posted?
,AgentClaret,2010-04-30T18:13Z,"It's up now. Look for ""The Visitors""

Where is the episode ""Chariots, the Gods, and Beyond""?

I think when this show premiered 4/20 on the History channel that they showed two episodes...

or was that one the old one-off special they did?"

,chaosheritage,2010-07-04T15:46Z,"This actually tends to make more sense than conventional thought schools.  ALthough I do take things with a pinch of salt, as they say. I wouldnt be surprised if most of this was pretty close to the mark.  If it doesnt get you to at least think a little bit youre either a disinfo suspect or retarded"
