King Sunny Ade â€“ Best of the Classic Years (1969-74)

vbr (av. 216 plus)



A collection of Sunny Adeâ€™s earlier works, before his popular Juju Music recordings. Full of psychedelic grooves throughout, with percussion and guitars intertwining. A mix of afrobeat, juju and highlife.

This is a rare gem for fans of Nigerian juju music. The genre's most enduring and prolific artist is revealed in his giddy youth, through tracks recorded with his band the African Beats between 1969 and 74, some ten years before American audiences got their first live taste of KSA's incomparable sound. 

The opener, "Sunny Ti De," is an 18-minute extravaganza, actually five songs run together in the "non-stop" mode AdÃ© favored at that time. The groove is so relaxed, and so deep, that the interplay of guitars and drums seems to be taking place in an enchanted African dream space.


 Front and center are two, slow, dueling guitars, one reverb drenched and bluesy, the other crisp and jamming with chippy-chop counter riffs that clearly identify this instrument as AdÃ©'s. In the easy way of old-time juju, we go nearly five minutes before there's any singing. But when AdÃ©'s silky voice does emerge from the mix, the amazing thing is that he sounds just as he does today.
