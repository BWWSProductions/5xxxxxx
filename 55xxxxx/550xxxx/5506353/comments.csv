@babooory: Whole [quark] ""movement"" have background in situations similar to one you have.
Unfortunately, [quark] torrents live shortly - a day or two, maybe a week (let say - by the nature of it), but those in need knows where to look for.
So, if you have any particular show on mind and [quark] extra-small file-size could speed-up a download of it, let me know. I'll see if such show can fit in."
