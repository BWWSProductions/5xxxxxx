I wonder what the fuck is such a big of a deal about this? Let me give it to you in a simple way you can understand:

If people know what R5 is, they won't be bothered by the six letters in the title. Unless they're one of those ""GOTTA HATE EVERYTHING"" people internet is full of. 
Anyway, they know what they're downloading and what to expect.

If someone isn't really all that familiar with different terms and isn't that PRO in torrent movie downloading, they wouldn't probably even download a version that only sais ""R5"" coz it's not at all familiar to them. But they find a Crazies R5 DVDrip.. well. that they can understand AND they get something better than a cam and most likely won't start crying over it like a juvenile butthurt homosexual.

extremezone's rips, IN MY EXPERIENCE, have always been one of the first to appear on TPB after the cams and Telesyncs. And mostly, it's way better quality than the cams just before it. And isn't THAT FAR FROM DVDRIP as the video and audio both usually are on a level that can be at least COMPARED to a DVDrip and it shouldn't piss people off. 


I honestly hate freeloaders who complain about their free products so VERY very much. 


But in short: DVDRip text is there so average torrent users find the good version, not to bullshit you people who know what R5 is.. if you fucking KNOW WHAT R5 IS, WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR MALFUNCTION IN THE FIRST PLACE?

You're raging about a fucking technicality. A term. 6 letters in a title that STILL TELLS THE WHOLE STORY. 

So please just GTFO if that pisses you off and stop spamming the commentsection with your juvenile ragemessages.

YOU are ruining TPB if someone is. extremezone is only doing something the pirate scene benefits from. If you fail to see it, I'm sorry that you're not all that bright."
,Sarkasmi,2010-04-18T11:44Z,"And tamagami; What the FUCK are you coming back for? I see you've left at least 3 comments with several hours in between em... If this isn't for your liking, what the fuck are you doing here? 

You know what R5 is. This is what it is. 
Shut the fuck up.

DVDRip isn't there to bullshit you - it's there for average users to let em know it's a ""better than a cam"" version and trust me, it works. 

If the average user gets disappointed that it's not exactly like DVD, he will understand that it's an R5 and probably learn about that shit. 

There is NO HUGE INJUSTICE BEING DONE HERE. 

Go buy your fucking movies, dipshit - you're worthless. Seriously.. you sound like one of those granpa/granma's who complaing about _EVERYTHING_ just for their own gratification, with all that bitching and moaning. 

And you even know what R5 is so who are you fighting for? Hmh? 

But yeah, I guess he should take the DVDrip off the title. I've seen this kiddyshit a thousand times already... I just KNOW the average semi-active downloaders won't understand that R5 is better than a TS and Cams AND that makes em wait for something that has ""DVDRip"" written on it, for a few weeks more - when they COULD actually enjoy a decent copy a few weeks earlier......."

Extremzone - STOP uploading mislabeled torrents! R5 is NOT DVDRIP, Asshole! You dont deserve a purple skull, all you deserve is a punch in the head. FUCK YOU.

..

Technically... R5 IS a DVDrip as it's - TA-DAH! - ripped from DVD. Too bad most R5 (REGION 5 DVD) don't originally have english audio, so the audio is from another source - like the description says. 
(With all this time you all have spent trolling and flaming the commentsection, I think you'd had the time to read that aswell.. But some people decide to hate and offend in return for someone working selflessly to upload us movies ... interesting.) 

Originally there wasn't even a name for R5.. just calling it random DVDSCR or DVDRIP and clafirying in the desctiprion that it's a DVDrip with an external audiosource. 

""R5 DVDrip"" as a term works perfectly to clarify what it is. It's clear as day what it is. And the description tells every detail...

I personally don't understand the whole flamewar against extremezone at all and am rather surprised at the childishness and absurd hate towards him..."

I appreciate how you continue to upload videos even after you've been robbed of your VIP skull. I want to personally thank you for your time and effort. I guess I'm more forgiving than others because I don't really care if you make a mistake in naming your uploads (that is if you even did). Anyway, thanks again and keep up the good work! I've watched videos from you before and I know how good you are, so why is everyone complaining? Oh, and I don't check thepiratebay very often so I don't really care how bad I get flamed by haters.

,bip0lar,2010-05-04T15:50Z,Limited minded children who can't even type a proper sentense bitching over nothing.

I think this deserves praise for the effort not shitloads of hate.  As to him spoiling TPB get a life! He is one of the hardworking uploaders who loads of us rely on.  Excellent work mate, thanks for not taking the easy option and just not bothering 'cos of all the hate.

(Even though its fixed now)
I agree with you, its not even that the torrent is mislabled. For some reason people only see ""DVD Rip"" in the title, but on my screen i see ""R5"" as well.  Anyone who says its mislabled is just as correct as someone saying that its labeled correctly. Both R5 and DVDRIP are in the title. Morons."
,TheOdMan,2010-05-06T05:19Z,"I'm acually getting seriously upset about how some people behave. How can you call this mislabled?
Region 5 DVDrip with external audio, without the external adio, you would be listening to Russian dub or whatever, would that be better?
Everything is in the description. Sarkasmi made some really good posts about this a few pages ago, glad to see some people still have some common sense. And some people even go as far as personal insults, and to say that extremezone ""should learn proper english"" What the fuck is that about? Learn some god damn manners. He is providing us (YOU and ME) with an alternetive if we just don't want to wait a few more weeks for a DVDrip with original soundtrack, and for that we lynch him?
Jesus christ, he should get commended for what he does, not bashed. Anyway, thx for the up extremezone. V-8 A-5 M-8"

,haciendaman,2010-05-06T19:32Z,"Fucking hell. 

Here's the deal - you're all getting something for FREE. So the sound's not exactly like that on a Blu-ray - what the fuck do you expect? So it's labelled (in some people's tiny minds) ina  misleading way - who fucking cares? It's FREE! I've burned this down onto DVD & watched it through my cheap DVD player & on a pretty standard TV & guess what, it was absolutely fine. 

It still astounds me that people come on here & bitch about quality, who uplaoded what, how quick something's taken to get on Pirate Bay. You fucking retards. I download loads of stuff, sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not great, so what. It's all cost me fuck-all & if I eventually want to buy the original, then I do when it comes out. You fuckers who want 110% better-than-perfect copies of someting which only came out at the cinema (in the UK at least) about a month ago need to bring yourselves down a peg or two. You're not ENTITLED to this stuff, people come on here & upload. Sometimes well, sometimes crappy, but it costs you NOTHING. 

Thanks to extremezone & all the uploaders for manking things available for people like me to check out for free. You don't have to do it & it's not always great, but at least you've given that opportunity to watch something. It's like 'try before you buy' & I thank you for it!  "

Sorry to see your post was overlooked,

Peer Block will block many peers, but it will not ensure full safety. If you already got caught once, then I would really be careful, as more times getting caught, the more trouble you are in. You may get taken off the internet by your ISP. Also the game company you pirated from may take you to court. You may get taken off the internet by your ISP. Also the game company you pirated from may take you to court. Seeing as you already were taken off of your ISP, the next step may take you to court.

Here is a website you could look at to help avoiding getting caught again:

http://ask.metafilter.com/35686/How-to-use-BitTorrent-without-getting-caught

 I would suggest piggybacking off of someone else's WiFi for a while or move somewhere like Sweden or China if your life is run by pirated software. I also know that an ISP like ComCast can be a bitch and will almost never let you get away unless you are running through several ip security programs. Your ISP can see everything that is going in and out of your network.
I am not saying to stop download pirated stuff. Keep doing it, just don't throw your life away because of it. Play it smart, do the right think. The World is on Big Family!

,Mayam78,2010-05-16T07:37Z,"Eh, so for those sifting through the flames.  yes the V is perfectly fine.  The A leaves something to desire.  I ran it off my comp. (hooked to a pretty nice surround sound) and adjusted the levels and effects until I was satisfied.  

As has been said plenty enough times before, it's an R5 and that should tell you what you're getting.  Those who don't know hopefully will have now learned if reading all this.  You're going to have to tweak your EQ a bit most likely.  I knew what I was getting going in.  If doing that is not your cup of tea then your decision is simple.

As for the movie?  If you liked ""Dawn of the Dead"" and most popular movies of the sort then you may like this.  Actually it's a bit more ""realistic"" than the jugular ripping armeggedon  of some zombie type flicks past.  But hey, if it's not to your liking then you can simply delete and move on with your life and get the next flick to tweak you and your family's interest right?

Lets just thank Extremezone for his work on putting this together for us.  A great piece of work for what you had to work with at the time bro.  Thanks for getting it out so quickly.

If your into these kind of flicks, you now know if you want to see/purchase this or not.  Mission accomplished.  And if you'd just like to d/l a better version?  You know that too.

Extremezone has done a service for us.  That is all.  Congratulate him."

 Here's my advice go back to limewire and fuck up your pcs instead of coming here and fucking with our trustworthy uploaders. I really can't believe you guys. I'm frustrated that a good copy of The Crazies isn't out either even though movies coming out a couple of weeks later have better quality copies out. This isn't the uploaders fault, they try to get the best of what they have to us. Do you think they get fucking paid for this shit? Quit whining and when a better copy is out, someone will upload it if you didn't piss them off too much. For all we know your bitching is why we don't have a better quality. 

 Keep up the great work Extremezone, I'm seeing your name more and more on torrents I'm interested in, and if it wasn't for you and a few others we wouldn't have anything, let alone quality.
