These are .ISO Image Files
I use Nero, or other DVD burning software to burn actual DVD Discs and then watch them in either my computer, or a standalone DVD Player and TV.

.
You may have to install some codecs on your computer for sound.

This is an exact copy of the original disc.
The originals are created by a small shop on DVD+R discs.
Not all standalone DVD players are compatible with these discs.
.
I can play this on my computer and DVD player, as can hundreds of others who have downloaded it.  Your problems are on your end."
