PLOT
A groundbreaking new metaphysical noir film from writer/director James Kerwin, YESTERDAY WAS A LIE combines "stunning black-and-white cinematography, a sultry jazz score and a refreshingly high-minded script" (Variety). Produced on a micro-budget of $200,000 by a non-profit arts foundation, YESTERDAY has gone on to receive over a dozen film festival Best Feature awards, critical praise, and a release by E1 Entertainment U.S.

Kipleigh Brown "exudes Bacall" (Slice of SciFi) as Hoyle, a girl with a sharp mind and a weakness for bourbon who finds herself on the trail of a reclusive genius (John Newton). But her work takes a series of unforeseen twists as events around her grow increasingly fragmented... disconnected... surreal.

With a sexy lounge singer (Chase Masterson) and a loyal partner (Mik Scriba) as her only allies, Hoyle is plunged into a dark world of intrigue and earth-shattering cosmological secrets. Haunted by an ever-present shadow (Peter Mayhew) whom she is destined to face, Hoyle discovers that the most powerful force in the universe â€” the power to bend reality, the power to know the truth â€” lies within the depths of the human heart. "This ambitious film is a stunner, nothing less than the arrival of a major filmmaker" (Dennis Willis, KGO Radio / Flick Nation).
