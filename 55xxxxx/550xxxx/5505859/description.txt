This is a complete scan in of the book An Introduction to the History of Science.  Think of Carl Sagan's book Cosmos, only much older.

The torrent consists of about three hundred compressed 300DPI greyscale TIFF images.  If you want searchable plain text, wait for the Gutenberg version.  If you want to preserve the original over-the-top scan-ins, here you go.

As far as I know, this book is in the public domain.

Share and enjoy!
