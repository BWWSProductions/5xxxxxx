,VampireKiler,2010-04-19T06:42Z,Can get feedback? how is it? good upload?
,Kanonoide,2010-04-19T12:24Z,"Got a problem. It says ""The application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.""

Any ideas what could be?

Thanks anyway."
,Kanonoide,2010-04-19T12:32Z,"Mmmm ok i've tried on W7 and doesn't run either... 

nickjacks how did you get it run?"
,briansama,2010-04-19T14:49Z,"works for me, but im not sure its CS5 tbh.........

going threw help, it brings up CS4 help pages and whatnot, idk. I dont know any of the new features of cs5 to test tho so I wont knock it for now."
[V],Askeen,2010-04-19T17:09Z,"this version is Pre-Release of CS5, it means is not fully CS5..

Run Photoshop.exe as Admin and see if it works. if you use Vista or 7"
,ImSoJaded,2010-04-19T20:07Z,"Works fine on Windows 7 x64, just edited a bunch of pictures with it. Thanks, uploader."
,langes01x,2010-04-20T07:04Z,Photomerge is broken in this version along with some other functions due to bugs in the code. While content-aware fill and some of the other functions are present they may not be as good as the retail version. I'd suggest waiting for the retail version.
,Kanonoide,2010-04-20T09:58Z,"Ok, finally works! Thanks Askeen it works if you run as administrator..."
,cintronix,2010-04-21T04:41Z,"Crashes when I start it.  I'm running 7 Ultimate on a HP HDX18t.  

I downloaded Creative Suite 5 Master.  It accepted the key I used to install it.  Upon 1st launch of the program it phoned home and locked up on me.  None of the serials I cold find works now.  I'm stuck in 30 day trial mode.

Anyone got a solution for that?  I don't want to uninstall CS5 Master yet.

Thanks all."
,iycgtptyarvg,2010-04-21T16:21Z,"I don't understand it. I can't do anything.

I open a picture, but I only have the 'hand' cursor. I try anything, but I cannot change to another tool.

Can somebody help me?"
,NewGod,2010-04-21T21:44Z,Works perfectly under W7 Ultimate 32.
,NewGod,2010-04-21T22:23Z,"WTF? Now it stopped working! :)

All I get is a hand tool and even that doesen't work. Restarting the program doesen't help, but when I firs start the old CS4 and then restart, it works again. At lest for now. This is very strange."
,NewGod,2010-04-21T22:51Z,I think there is some kind of a time limit for how long it works. Like 30 minutes or so. :(
,Benni_12er,2010-04-23T17:17Z,no you can use it as long as you want. really good torrent! i love photoshop and cs5 even more :D works perfect for me!
,kcp100,2010-04-25T17:37Z,"This works 100% fine. I am using it now. The biggest (best) new feature I can find is the content-aware fill. It only appears in the fill menu right now, but on the final release it will also be on the healing brush tool, and elsewhere. check it out:

I got this to run the first time on windows 7 64 bit. I right clicked and set it to run in compatibility for vista sp2, and ran it as administrator. make sure you dont launch it when CS3/4 is running or it wont work."
[T],FRITZBox,2010-04-25T21:37Z,"Works great on XP SP3 32bits

Thanks!"
,kcp100,2010-04-25T21:51Z,I love having no install!
,liltwixis11,2010-04-26T00:23Z,"I get ""The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000022). Click on OK to terminate the application."" When I try running it on XP Pro x64. Any ideas?"
,samahh,2010-04-27T00:08Z,Works on Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit)

,cclloyd,2010-04-28T05:38Z,"Is there any way to get the normal splashscreen?  I checked the pre-release version of photoshop, and the splash screen is in the exe."

,pxpx,2010-05-07T22:27Z,"Thank you Askeen & seeders!

To work in Windows 7 64-bit: run as administrator, set compatibility to XP Sp2 which Win 7 suggest anyway.

Thanks again!"
,b0k1,2010-06-14T05:43Z,"nice man, mine didn't work when i first opened it because you cant edit anything and i couldnt open images it would just be a transparent square but as i was about to submit a comment explaining the problem it started to work..:S thanks nice upload"

,Gregoric,2011-06-06T15:41Z,Works great. If you don't need the Extended version add-ons - choose this Photoshop. Works well with Pentagram tablets (pen pressure) while release CS5 version don't.
