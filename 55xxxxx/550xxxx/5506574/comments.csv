Just a question what?s the difference between the proper and the quark you uploaded, missing seconds, sync errors, text, colour?? I?m happy ether way, perfection isn?t always necessary to enjoy something


Thanks 
Stev"

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-21T11:24Z,"As I said earlier, chaos in/between Scene-groups continues.
1st., IMMERSE have released badly fucked 720p of ep.13 - they've forgotten to decimate 29.97 fps in 23.976 and before anyone have nuked their release issued a ... (LOL) ""REPACK"" (what is most ridiculous). Of course, IMMERSE is ""famous?by low quality and decent number of screw-up. Remember - 720p groups have not suffered in the past of some ""troubles"" typical for XviD Scene-part."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-21T11:27Z,"OK? Two releases so far - and I HAVE dowloaded... both. After short skimming, I have decided not to re-encode any of these two, but to encode from crappy XviD one unplanned [quark]. That way I helped to many on slow connections and gave a chance and time to groups to finally release a decent 720p. DIMENSION has done proper - and even if we can (and should) expect something like REAL PROPER shit ('cause DIM has cut-out prematurely last 10-12 frames containing a sign ""Lost"" as proper ending) I get full of it and have encoded last one, a DIMENSION's 720p.
Look what they have been said about PROPER (in NFO):
""The One Click Wonder Kiddies have a glitch/video freeze at 1325 and from that point through the end their audio has constant clipping and random distortion. Sample included."""
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-21T11:27Z,"""Kiddies"" are - IMMERSE... LOL. It's sad and funny in the same time, if you think how many thousands have download THREE TIMES 1.1 GB and how much of the bandwidth (and someone's money) have been ""burned"" for nothing. In the same time, a sucker called ""twentforty"" have troubles to have 20 decent seeders and those BAD releases have - 1000 or more... and 10000 of downloads each. Go figure, my friend."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-21T11:29Z,@Stev: My answer has been splitted because of Database errors on TPB.
,stev666,2010-04-21T11:36Z,"not a problem my friend, thank you for always being so clear and helpful about these things.

Cheers
