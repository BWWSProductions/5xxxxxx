,dannweg,2011-03-28T13:30Z,"some tracks are broken in the beginning - bad rip (Suzanne Vega - [Days Of Open Hand #08] Big Space, Suzanne Vega - [Days Of Open Hand #03] Rusted Pipe)"
[T],lonesomecowboy,2011-03-29T19:28Z,"Hello Dannweg,

three of these albums aren't my rip and one of them is ""Days of Open Hand"". I did not listen completely through all albums and the accurate rip results in the log-file of that special album seemed reliable. Obviously a fake. I'm sorry for that. All other albums should be o.k.

Thanks for the info :-)"
[T],lonesomecowboy,2011-03-29T20:18Z,"""Solitude Standing"": 
04- In The Eye
06 - Solitude Standing
11 - Tom's Diner (Reprise)

Not as obvious as on ""Days of Open Hand"", but slightly cut (few milliseconds) at the beginning.
Forget the log-file. No accurate rip!

This torrent is nearly one year old and nobody has complained so far, so a correction from my side is pointless.
All i can say is, that i'm probably more annoyed than most of you downloaders.
Sorry again."
