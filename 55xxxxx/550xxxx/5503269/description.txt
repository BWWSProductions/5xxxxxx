- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Low meets Bjork and Cat Power. A quartet sharing vocals that sends shimmers
   down your spine. Music has seldom been as beautiful as this. Combining
   melancholic melodies, unpredictable arrangements and their own unique
   unhiearchic way of making music, Audrey has been a diamond in the rough for
   some time now. But it's time to let them shine as their new album "Visible
   Forms" is, truly, a masterpiece.
   For those of you who haven't heard them, congratulations. You've got a
   musical highlight ahead of you.
