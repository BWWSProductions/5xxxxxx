I could not find any professional reviews to post with this album. Although technically classified as power metal or symphonic metal, it verges on mainstream pop/rock at many points and the reasons for this are evident if you take the time to read their wikipedia entry etc. Which is not necessarily a downside - clean vocals and guitars, discernible lyrics, a variety of effects and background vocals that make for an enjoyable listen even if its not what hardcore metalheads are looking for. Fans of bands playing "softer" or more melodic metal like Revolution Renaissance will definitely enjoy this album. Standout tracks (IMO) being "Lords of Polaris" and "Starchildren". Like Keldian's first album, Journey Of Souls follows a general space theme in the lyrics and sound.
