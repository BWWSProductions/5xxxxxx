[T],occultmobilization,2010-04-30T16:22Z,"The DigiMob Release Index is a few steps ahead of you on this one - we have a fully searchable index of every file from every release, which anyone can access from out forum site, http://digimob.tk/  It was used while preparing these four torrents for release to ensure we didn't duplicate anything we already have.

That said, there will sometimes still be duplicate files.  Usually these duplicates are of a higher quality than their previous copies, or a later edition (though editions tend to be noted in the name of the file).  This is one of the main reasons we don't remove duplicates from the official Index.

Your efforts are nonetheless appreciated.
