,makkaspliff,2010-11-18T21:41Z,"In the serials text there are two sets of numbers for each of the three groups of numbers. 
For instance

7VR32AE7T8
4GHD-9FBR-X2EK-6G22

6EQ69LY7M9
HBJ2-H531-67F2-BU2X

7LH8842216
RPP6-F4YJ-C291-24LN


Which one is the serial? The first one of each is invalid, so is the second one. And that applies to all of the given serials.
Whats the first row of digits for, user ID? Can't be because it can't be used there.
Tried creating an ID, copied/pasted  both sets of a group into the license box, Invalid.
Whats the story here with the serials??"
