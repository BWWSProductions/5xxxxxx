Sorry if I overstepped above."

Strange, how punks are quiet now."

,believenu,2010-04-24T18:53Z,it seems since i have become a pirate most people usually only talk if they have something to complain about..your insistance on politeness good manners and sharing seems to be getting thru.. New motto seeding is sharing.
[V],pluto999,2010-04-24T19:55Z,NO need to comment about A/V its superb..great job..
