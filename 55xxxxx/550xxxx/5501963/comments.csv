[V],twentyforty,2010-04-18T18:49Z,"@lilars: Finaly... and I wrote comments to myself whole day.
Not that no one has downloaded my ""shit which sucks"", quite contrary, a few - hundreds till now, but you have been first who have ""spoken"" so far."
,lilars26,2010-04-18T19:36Z,@20/40 I'm glad I could brighten your day a little with something so small as a thank you.
,jon4fun,2010-04-18T23:08Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I LOVE quark!!!

I would've commented to say thanks before now but spent weekend painting. No fun at all. I still haven't seen most of last weeks shows.

BTW, I am getting into Craig Ferguson - thanks for recommendation (it was to someone else) but it sounded good and I'm beginning to become a fan! Have to see if the show keeps up it's high production values, HA!

Thanks for LOTS also.

Cheers
Jon"
,lilars26,2010-04-18T23:13Z,"Hey Jon
I hate painting."
,jon4fun,2010-04-19T01:58Z,"Hi Lilars, whats even worse is the weather is actually OK, which means it is not raining. Only 2nd weekend so far this year. Did not want to be inhaling paint fumes.

Cheers
Jon"

,jon4fun,2010-04-19T05:42Z,"@ ALL - Q/A 9+ for R5 maybe a 10
I don't know if I'm getting used to watching quarks now (PS3 with TV) but this R5 is well worth the download.

Normally they have visual issues, for me anyway - contrast type of things, but not this one.

Story, well... they did better in Racoontown (I think, can't be bothered to google).

Cheers
Jon"
