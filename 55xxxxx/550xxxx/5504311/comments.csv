http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5503391/Magadheera_-_Blu-Ray_-_720p_-_x264_-_DTS_-_%5BDDR%5D-ExtraTorrent

Tx SaM, without u hw can v find DDR releases for free and quick. :)

I have a Q, R u the same SaM from mininova or someone else. If u r him, what happen to ur own torrentz, cos one who was @ mininova had post about 50 hindi torrentz. 
( his torentz are, Victory, rockon, dhoom 2 sarkar ... and many more, and they had 10/10 quality in most of time)

Anyway tx for sharing this, with us."
[V],SaM,2010-04-20T12:41Z,"yes i am the same SaM,my torrents can be found at my account in extratorrent as for some unknown reasons all my old torrents were removed from here,was told that some helper reported me as a faker,lol,and yes i stopped since OCT last year,my last encode was LAK,dont really have a time now a days for encoding as i have really too much of other responsibilities to  do...and DDR are the leading encoders for Hindi movies and i am proud to work with them :)"
