http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher_(2009_series)
than your missing a few Issues, would like the rest if you have it I will Seed, but Thanks."
,Snophoo,2011-07-17T10:32Z,"Much Thanks! This run doesn't seem to be included with any of the other Punisher collections, been looking for these issues. 
Just to confirm- Is this is the volume that includes the ""dark reign"" stuff and that they changed into ""Franken-Castle"" after #16?"
,PiggyV01,2012-02-24T16:54Z,"Thanks, but do you have the rest? This ends way before the end of the series and it ends mid story! Like the penultimate issue!"
