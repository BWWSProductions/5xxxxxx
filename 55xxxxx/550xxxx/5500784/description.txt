Comodo Internet Security is the free, multi-layered security application that protects your computer against internal and external attacks from viruses, Trojans, worms, buffer overflows, spyware and hackers. Built from the ground upwards with your security in mind, CIS combines powerful Antivirus protection, an enterprise class packet filtering firewall and an advanced host intrusion prevention system called Defense plus in one supremely powerful application. Version 4.0 sees a major leap forward in security and usability with the addition of the new auto sandboxing feature - an isolated operating environment for unknown applications. Under default settings, unknown and untrusted applications are now automatically sandboxed so that they cannot make permanent changes to other processes, programs or data on your 'real' system.
