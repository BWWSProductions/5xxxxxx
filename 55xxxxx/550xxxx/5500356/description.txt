Description:

Jason Bermasâ€™ highly anticipated documentary Invisible Empire exposes the New World Order in their own words, by painstakingly showing how the elite have not only conspired to create a dictatorial global government in private, but have publicly stated their agenda hundreds of times in public.

For the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planetâ€™s ruthless Super-class is exposed in stark detail. This documentary film chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.

Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda and debt.

The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are now in the final phase of consolidating power.

Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.

Worldwide tyranny isnâ€™t coming, itâ€™s here.

This isnâ€™t conspiracy theory, itâ€™s conspiracy fact. The New World Order is out in the openâ€” all documented in stunning living color.

Unelected bureaucrats are establishing regional unions under one superstate.

Witness their plan for a global tax and a cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman and child is micro-chipped at birth.
