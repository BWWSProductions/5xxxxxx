There is much here that has been in portions of other channellings through the years. However, now Kryon is putting some of these things together in ways that are becoming very straight forward. There is much here to offend just about everyone, so it will probably be a popular channelling (smile). However, Kryon wishes to again let you know the sacredness of the beginning... sometimes the source for much controversy, conspiracy and mythology. This is all given as information to enhance the Human spirit, not to forward a belief system. If some of these things are unbelievable to you, it should not change your love of Spirit or the way you view God. Kryon often says, "Take these things into your life and validate them over time. They are historic, and given to you for perspective only. It is not necessary for you to believe these things to continue to hold your light. Feel the love of God as proof that you are part of the creator."
