This torrent is the complete collection of Louis Theroux's BBC documentaries as of April 2009.
Files are mixed quality .avi categorized by series and episode.

This is the forth version of this hugely popular torrent series including Louis' latest film 'America's Medicated Kids' in Series 3.

I have found it very hard to find all of these films and thanks must be given to the original uploaders, in particular the wonderful people at UKNova, with whom this torrent has been granted permission.

This is the only and original complete archive of his films available on the internet. Every other full collection out there has been taken from this one. PLEASE do not reupload on any other sites without asking me first.

Please seed this torrent to at least 100% after you have downloaded.

Great thanks to Louis and the BBC for this fantastic series. I am an absolutely huge fan of your work Louis, and what to help spread the world and bring your superb films to as wide an audience as possible.

Enjoy, and please seed;
