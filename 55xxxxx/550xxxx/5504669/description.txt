Filmed on the 1976 "Wings Over America" tour, this quality rip from the digital sound Laserdisc is the best you are likely to find on this title until Sir Paul decides to put it out for sale.  Due to being lit for the concert stage and not for the cameras some shots are darker than others but overall it's an accurate reproduction of the source material.  On the other hand the performance is marvelous.  Includes a basic menu for selecting individual songs.  Enjoy!
