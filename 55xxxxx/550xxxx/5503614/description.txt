'Yves Klein Blue Draw Attention to Themselves' is an EP  by Yves Klein Blue released on 1 April 2008 on Dew Process. An EP of the same name had been produced by the band themselves for sale at local shows, but was re-recorded and produced by Caleb James, a renowned Australian producer. This subsequent re-release saw the band get picked up by Dew Process. The band's first single, Polka, received regular airplay on alternative radio station Triple J, and was followed by the release of their second single, Silence is Distance. Videos were shot for both of these singles, as well as for The Streetlight, which was curiously left off the label re-release of the EP.[1]
