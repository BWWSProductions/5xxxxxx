This was probably produced for the first season because it still 
has the first year's theme music (the best theme of all the 
seasons). The other reason is that it has Larry Linville in the 
guest cast, and by the time this aired he was already co-starring 
as Major Frank Burns in M*A*S*H.

The main guest stars are Marj Dusay, James Luisi, Michael Tolan, 
and Severn Darden.
