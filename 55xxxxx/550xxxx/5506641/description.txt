Easily change from WindowsÂ® XP/Vista to Windows 7 using Paragon System Upgrade Utilities 2010. With our leading-edge technology, you can move effortless to the latest operating system. Decide how long you want to keep your existing Windows system, and which applications and files you want to migrate to Windows 7.

New operating system â€“ New opportunities
MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® operating systems are used all over the world. While Windows 7 offers many benefits like better hardware support, more intuitive interface options, and optimized media  and networking functions, Windows 7 will also keep users busy managing their data and applications when they switch over from their existing and familiar Windows XP or Vista configuration.

New operating system â€“ New risks
Switching to a new operating system uncovers certain risks. Users will need to evaluate whether Windows 7 supports their existing hardware and specific software applications. There are a few restrictions for Windows XP users as it is not possible, to directly upgrade to Windows 7 - the user has to build up a completely new system and risks possible data loss during this process. Additionally, there is a certain amount of unfamiliarity with the new operating system - it is different than what they are used to and can leave them vulnerable to upgrading their system incorrectly.

New operating system - System Upgrade Utilities!
System Upgrade Utilities offers a user-friendly package with tools to manage your switch to Windows 7, making it easy and effective. Instead of switching to Windows 7 directly with no recourse, our bundle lets you keep your habitual Windows XP/Vista configuration while using Windows 7 at the same time, on the same computer. With System Upgrade Utilities you can thoroughly test Windows 7 and then determine whether to make it your main operating system, if it meets all your needs.

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal
 
http://virusscan.jotti.org/
 
http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
