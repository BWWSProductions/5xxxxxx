Paul Grignon - Money As Debt.avi

Released with the permission of Paul Grignon

Paul Grignon's 47-minute animated presentation of "Money as Debt" tells
in very simple and effective graphic terms what money is and how it is
being created. It is an entertaining way to get the message out. The
Cowichan Citizens Coalition and its "Duncan Initiative" received high
praise from those who previewed it. I recommend it as a painless but
hard-hitting educational tool and encourage the widest distribution and
use by all groups concerned with the present unsustainable monetary 
system in Canada and the United States.

Through a network of anonymous financial spider webbing only a
handful of global King Bankers own and control it all. . . . Everybody,
people, enterprise, State and foreign countries, all have become slaves
chained to the Bankerâ€™s credit ropes.
-- Hans Schicht, â€œThe Death of Bankingâ€ (February 2005)

President Andrew Jackson called the banking cartel â€œa hydraheaded
monster eating the flesh of the common man.â€ New
York Mayor John Hylan, writing in the 1920s, called it a â€œgiant octopusâ€
that â€œseizes in its long and powerful tentacles our executive officers,
our legislative bodies, our schools, our courts, our newspapers, and
every agency created for the public protection.â€ The debt spider has
devoured farms, homes and whole countries that have become trapped
in its web.

In â€œThe Death of Banking,â€ financial commentator Hans Schicht
states that he had an opportunity in his career to observe the wizards
of finance as an insider at close range. Their game, he says, has gotten
so centralized and concentrated that the greater part of U.S. banking
and enterprise is now under the control of a small inner circle of men.
He calls the game â€œspider webbing.â€ Its rules include:


***Making any concentration of wealth invisible.

***Exercising control through â€œleverageâ€ â€“ mergers, takeovers, chain
share holdings where one company holds shares of other
companies, conditions annexed to loans, and so forth.

***Exercising tight personal management and control, with a
minimum of insiders and front-men who themselves have only
partial knowledge of the game.


Dr. Carroll Quigley was a writer and professor of history at
Georgetown University, where he was President Bill Clintonâ€™s mentor.

Professor Quigley wrote from personal knowledge of an elite clique of
global financiers bent on controlling the world. Their aim, he said,
was â€œnothing less than to create a world system of financial control
in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country
and the economy of the world as a whole.â€ This system was â€œto be
controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world
acting in concert, by secret agreements.â€ He called this clique simply
the â€œinternational bankers.â€ Their essence was not race, religion or
nationality but was just a passion for control over other humans. The
key to their success was that they would control and manipulate the money
system of a nation while letting it appear to be controlled by the government.

The international bankers have succeeded in doing more than just
controlling the money supply. Today they actually create the money
supply, while making it appear to be created by the government. This
devious scheme was revealed by Sir Josiah Stamp, director of the Bank
of England and the second richest man in Britain in the 1920s. Speaking
at the University of Texas in 1927, he dropped this bombshell:

The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing.
The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of
hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in inequity
and born in sin . . . . Bankers own the earth. Take it away from
them but leave them the power to create money, and, with a
flick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back
again. . . . Take this great power away from them and all great
fortunes like mine will disappear, for then this would be a better
and happier world to live in. . . . But, if you want to continue to be
the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let
bankers continue to create money and control credit.
