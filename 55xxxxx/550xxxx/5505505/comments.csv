,DeltaPan,2010-04-20T20:15Z,"Doug and Tony arrive in a strange facility packed with scientific gear at least three hundred years beyond what they know. They quickly learn they're aboard an alien ship journeying to a primitive planet, where the aliens plan to harvest all the protein, leaving behind a dead world. That primitive planet, visible through the viewer, is Earth in 1885! Doug and Tony must find a way to thwart the aliens' plans, for Earthlings of that time stand no chance.
