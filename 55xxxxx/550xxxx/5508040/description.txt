David Gray (born 13 June 1968, Sale, Cheshire, England) is an English singer-songwriter. He released his first studio album in 1993 and received worldwide attention after the release of White Ladder six years later. It was the first of three UK chart-toppers in six years for Gray, the latter two of which also made the Top 20 in the U.S.

Life in Slow Motion is the seventh studio album by English singer-songwriter David Gray, released on 12 September 2005 in Europe and September 13 in the United States. Following a muted response to his previous album, A New Day at Midnight, this album was seen by many as a considerable return to the form that brought Gray international acclaim with White Ladder. This was also the last album recorded with long time collaborator Craig McClune.

Gray cites Sigur RÃ³s, Sparklehorse, Lucinda Williams, BjÃ¶rk and Mercury Rev as inspiration for the album. The album was also the first time Gray added a cello player. The original choice for a producer for the album was Daniel Lanois, but as he was busy, he ended up working with Marius de Vries who had produced his previous hit single "Sail Away."Throughout the tour supporting the album, Gray played a different setlist every night.

The three singles from the album were "The One I Love," "Hospital Food," and "Alibi."
