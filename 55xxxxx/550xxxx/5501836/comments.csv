Second of all, the quality is not at all the best if it is the same you uploaded last (compared to other HD releases these days).I for one expect HD quality when downloading almost 1.5 GB."
,andremo,2010-04-18T12:35Z,"I usually release both MPEG2 and MPEG4 versions. The reason I uploaded last is, at the moment, my sattelite recorder is located in another city and I had to download the ts files to this place first before I could process them.

Also, MPEG2 can be burned to a DVD without converting formats again, for the people who are interested in that. "
,andremo,2010-04-18T12:38Z,Keep in mind: conversion between lossy formats always results in less quality.
