Courage in Red S01E10 - V.I.P. Protection

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.

Episode Info: When a dignitary visits Canada their safety is the ultimate responsibility of the RCMP. Cpl Bill Demeau is the head instructor for the National V.I.P. course, it's his job to make sure that those training to join don't forget it. The training is tough, intense, merciless, it has to be. These Mounties must be prepared for any situation, to put their lives on the line...even take a bullet.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
