,jon4fun,2010-04-18T03:19Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I LOVE QUARK.

Cheers
Jon

P.S. I watch my quark(s) on 32"" LCD via HDMI from PS3.
No conversion required.
Just start file as normal and [PAUSE] immediately. 
Then open [OSD] and choose [Slow Advance].
A/V quality is about 8+ compared to a normal 20-40 file.
But the compression is unbelievable.

20-40 - You are Legend!"
,jon4fun,2010-04-18T03:22Z,"@All re: PS3 post please change [Slow Advance] to [Slow Forward].

Sorry 

Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-18T06:49Z,"@TKOG13: It is good to learn, even if its technically impossible to say for ALL handhelds, even for majority of iPods. CABAC is used as entropy model, and by the book - iPod doesn't accept this. On contrary, PSP ""hates"" CAVLC (accepted by iPods) and ""love"" CABAC.
Also - sound. By the numbers no habdheld should accept   AAC LC-SBR-PS (AAC Low Complexity with Spectral Band Replication and Parametric Stereo) but strictly AAC LS with 44.1 kHz sampling rate (here is 22,05).
Therefore, [quark]s are completely without iTunes bits/info (UUID needed  by older firmwares).
So, feel lucky - 'cause - believe it or not - some people have problems with my all other encodings - which are... 110% compatible.

@Jon: Thank you, my friend."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-18T08:06Z,"@TKOG13: Sorry, a dawn ""blindness"":

AAC LS = AAC LC

habdheld = handheld (LOL)"
