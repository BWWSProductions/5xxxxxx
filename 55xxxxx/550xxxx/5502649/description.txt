Compiled by Red Hat Software, Inc., the company that has assembled the most popular x86 installation of Linux, this command reference is massive, authoritative, and as complete as any reference can be.



In 1,500 pages of tiny print (siez-adjustable in your .pdf reader, of course), this heavy-duty tome documents every command, utility, file system, library function, and administration tool in the operating system. 


Linux also features a detailed kernel reference guide and a good index. If you're running a Linux system and acting as your own system administrator, Linux: Complete Command Reference is an indispensable reference.
