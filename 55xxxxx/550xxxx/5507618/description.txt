Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. This is round 2 of 4 of the Live March match-up between The Dragons and The Pirates.

The Pirates roar back in the second round and cut the lead to just 19pts! The Pirates use their tags to maximum advantage and the Dragons seem to be losing energy. The Dragon was dominated by Dia one on one and Holly was completely destroyed by The Iron Maiden. Even Jessie cox held her own and scored points for the Pirates. 

The momentum swings 180 and the Pirates are pumped and primed to go into the next round. The Dragons need to collect themselves and find out what is happening before it's too late and they end up getting fucked like sluts in RD4! Don't miss this exciting round!!
