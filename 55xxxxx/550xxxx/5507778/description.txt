Josh Rouse - El Turista (2010)

Released Feb. 22nd (Internationally) and March 9th (North America)

â€œI know itâ€™s kind of funny, this Midwestern guy doing Brazilian songs in Spanish,â€ says Josh Rouse about his new studio album, El Turista. â€œI donâ€™t know if it fits, but I like the way it feels.â€

Unexpected and utterly sublime, this sultry song cycle will shuffle seamlessly in tandem with Getz/Gilberto and Graceland, albums as boldly surprising in their eras as El Turista is in this one. The record marks a new direction for the critically acclaimed cult artist, while offering the musical sophistication and emotional depth Rouseâ€™s devoted constituents have come to expect from him thanks to a consistently enthralling body of work highlighted by the modern-day landmarks 1972 (2003) and Nashville (2005), both of which are generously sampled on the marvelous 2008 Rhino retrospective The Best of the Rykodisc years.



The new album bears the distinct influence of Spain, which the Nebraska native made his home five years ago with his Spanish wife Paz Suay; the couple and their first child now live in Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast. On El Turista, Spain serves as the point of origin for a globe-trotting musical journey that touches down in Cuba, Brazil and Africa, as well as Nashville, where the bulk of the tracks were recorded with Rouseâ€™s longtime producer and close collaborator Brad Jones, and the coupleâ€™s former home of Brooklyn, where the seeds of the record where sown and some of the songs dreamed up.
