Band of Horses - Infinite Arms (2010)






**ADVANCE**


I don't know the source of the leak of this album, but the quality is good overall, except for '02 - Compliments' which is slighty softer than the rest of the songs.






Band of Horses, previously known as Horses, is an American indie rock band formed in 2004 in Seattle by Ben Bridwell and Mat Brooke. Their first two albums were released on the Sub Pop record label, while their third album will be on Columbia Records.

Vocalist Bridwell has been likened to Jim James of My Morning Jacket, early Neil Young, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.
