,darwinsmunky,2010-04-21T16:08Z,"Ive been thinking, and the perfect solution to assholes that wont seed is to make them a peer as long as possible.  Especially for rare dvd files...they will wait, all the while uploading, against their will, to others wanting the file, for as long as it takes.  I had this thing all backwards.  I thought that if i was pumping this thing out, it would create seeds quicker, and in return the torrent would achieve more independence.  I was wrong about that.  I suppose its a bit like sex.  Cant let them blow their wad and just disappear the next morning, or in this case the next few hours.  And im a gu for fucks sake.  I have this wierd thing about watching my uploads, i watch them live and i always feel the need to do more.  I think by doing less im doing more.  Wow, what a rant."
