THANK YOU DUDE/DUDETTE/WOMEVER!

I..Love You!

Been Waiting SO...Long..For..Film..Noir. You have No Idea.

Oddly..these are amongst the most expensive to Buy (Groan) because the Stars are Deceased and the ""Money People"" are Literally..""Cashing In"".

No Greater Protest Opportunity Exists in ""Torrent Ville"" Than to Share and Share Alike some FILM NOIR. Hey..fer reals..go to ANY ""Big Box"" and check out a Copy of ""Sahara"" with Humphrey Bogart $25 !!!!

No Joke. No Exaggeration. A RIDICULOUS Price.

Made Up.

Artificial.

A JOKE!

But..that's Sheer Lunatic GREED fer ya.

And they're all the same.

Look at the ""Film Noir Collections"" ALL are ""Double Digit Dollers""..REAL Money for us ""last Of The Buffalo""..oops..sorry..""Middle Class""...aka ""Learned A Hand Skill, No Cops Searching Our Lockers, Generation X LAST INNOCENT GENERATION"" We ain't GOT that kind of Bread. So.We have NO CHOICE.

I.Ramble..I..Digress.

Twas ever thus.

Thank You FRANKIE-BOY!

I am Hereby Allocating A Serious ""Quantum Thank You"" to you In the form of..here goes..""Wishing You Luck"".

There..sent that out to you. Wished You Luck. Hope It Worked.

Seriously..Thank You.

Okay..now..What about the ""Oxycontin Express"" from 'Current TV'? Anyone?

(No 'Thanks' Is Ever Real Without Immediately Being Followed By Covetousness of ""More"") "
