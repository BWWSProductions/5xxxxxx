Deadwood Season 2

Season Two picks up almost literally where Season One leaves off: Sheriff Bullock(Timothy Olyphant) is caught in the throes of an affair with widow Alma Garrett (Molly Parker); saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) succumbs to the impending pressure to loosen his grasp on this now-legitimized town; and the various denizens and townspeople attempt to ply their trades - legal and otherwise - in between Bullock and Swearengen's battle for control, and moreover, the soul of Deadwood.
