,73sad73,2010-04-22T00:04Z,"A nice long post about the game except for the most important thing.

WTF is it? At 8.44 Giga bytes I'd like to know what the hell the game is about. Is it FPS or RTS or RPG? Is it a shit crossover port again. And why the hell would I want to go on demonoid if you uploaded it here?

Thanks for uploading but I'll pass without knowing WTH it is."
,Kumphychair,2010-04-22T03:07Z,"Well if its the real mass effect game, its a keeper... so dont bitch, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Mass+Effect"
,a4u1,2010-04-23T14:33Z,what's the point of uploading torrents if you don't seed?
,Rowanard,2010-04-24T02:25Z,"According to the demonoid page, this doesn't work with ATI cards."
,bobzcow,2010-04-24T14:01Z,"Ok, ok . i get that people wont this game real bad..... but you Need to FUCKING Seed!,, all you have to do is go to settings and change your upload speed to 10 kbs or even 20 kbs if 40 people did that we could have this in 6 hours , im seeing 7 kbs download rate right now and but there is 83 PEERS!...... 83 peers and only 1 seeder whats WRONG WITH THAT!!!"
,bobzcow,2010-04-24T20:46Z,anyone have the full download .. cuz we need it!!! stuck at 38 if anyone could help us out i will seed 30 kbs seeding 15 ...
,-bitMAN-,2010-04-27T17:19Z,"@73sad73: you're an asshole. Why would you download a game that you don't even know?

Does anybody know if this port (or any other port made with Cider) would work on the new graphic card included in the NEW MacBook Pro models?"
,Aventaes,2010-05-04T00:58Z,"plse seed its been a day that im at 81,47% and its getting anoying :p

ps 
ill keep seeeding this one for a while after i got it"
,Aventaes,2010-05-04T01:07Z,"o almost forgot since someone was complaining about the lack of game details

according to a review this is to be considered a rpg/fps the story is good and quite deep more then youll prob end up exploring and stripped from all its rpg components it would still be a decent shooter so wether you like rpg or fps youll prob like this game

ps according to the review not my opinion still downloading"
,Awesker91,2010-05-05T02:40Z,"man, please someone seed, im stuck in 84.4% for like 2 or 3 days. tnx"
,utron11,2010-05-05T05:20Z,Something is wrong with the server. Why is there only 1 seeder when everybody still seed and download everytime?
,Aventaes,2010-05-05T22:50Z,"@ utron the number of people seeding is actually the number of people seeding that have the entire thing i think anyway leechers dont count as seeders.
And at first youll have no prob getting to like 80% but from then on its murder :p"
,gi4mi,2010-05-06T20:59Z,get ready 99.8%

,Aventaes,2010-05-07T14:47Z,/cheer  got it but when i run it some parts of the screen turn white and characters dont apear im guessing its due to my graphics card witch is a ATI Radeon HD 2600 of 256mb after spending half my download limit on downloading and seeding this game and waited to get it for a week this sux :s
,Aventaes,2010-05-07T15:12Z,"can someone tell me wether the card can be the prob as i got osx 10.6.3
2gb ram 
256 mb  video
plenty of free hard disk and 2,4ghz dual core and i  can run it but most of it is just white screens and never a character apearing"
,bobzcow,2010-05-07T17:37Z,"nice work people , one and a half weeks  of downloading and seeding, payed off with a great game :P"
,Aventaes,2010-05-07T19:40Z,"@ santoka might be the case 
anyway im thinkin fuck this sh** ima buy myself an xbox360 rather then change the card or something witch will cost me as much"
,gi4mi,2010-05-07T20:44Z,"@Aventaes
that's right, ati cards can't run this; so people with ati cards watch out"
,Adelledaa,2010-05-08T18:06Z,"i can't unzip the file...because the file is too big to unzip with decompressor. i used the stuffit and unrarX, nothing work. Help! and good post :D"

,wasted0087,2012-03-17T11:34Z,"It downloaded just fine for me, the game started up fine, boosted graphics to max and there was the problem with the faces not coming out right, as if they were stacked upon one another, the eyes were black completely and scars were basically holes. And once the intro would start up and got to right after the ""The year is 2148..."" it would crash. Something about the Wine."
