This is my first upload. However this is not my torrent. To see more details about this game, pay some time to visit the site inor demonoid
System requirements:

Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or higher (actually you can play in the older Mac OS 10.5.x, but sometime it will get problems about using the mouse. If you want to play in the best conditions, use Snow Leopard!!!).

Intel Cider Port Macbook (Power PC, G3, G4 or the older versions not supported!!!)

Intel 2.4 GHz or AMD 2.0 GHz (will play better in Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz+).

RAM: 2 GB.

Hard disk drive: 13 GB.

Graphics Card: 128MB (play better in 256MB VGA cards).

Tested in : Macbook Pro 13''
Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3
Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz
2 GB RAM
NVidia GeForce 9400M 256 MB
Play well at the resolution 1024x768 (you can set the resolution higher if you want, but this is the optimal settings to prevent some lag on the screen).

You can customize the character if you want, the interactions of your character is very real!!! The story is interesting and combat mode is well!! The main story line is excellent, however, the side quest is acceptable (if you want to ask me!). Enjoy this game, and feel free to give me some feedback!!!

Install the game: Simply unzip and play!!!
