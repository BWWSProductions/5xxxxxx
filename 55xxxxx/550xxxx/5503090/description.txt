West, Bruce and Laing - Whatever Turns You On (1973)

Mp3 @vbr








Whatever Turns You On is the second and last studio album by blues-rock power trio/supergroup West, Bruce and Laing.


Every Cream and Mountain fan looked to West, Bruce & Laing with hopes that this combination would even exceed their erstwhile groups. It's a moot point whether it did, but this second of two studio albums produced by West, Bruce & Laing was greatly neglected, as they broke up virtually upon or even prior to its' release.



The album features a black-and-white comic strip on its front and back covers depicting the alleged "turn-ons" of the band's members - Leslie West's is food, Jack Bruce's alcohol, and Corky Laing's sex - as pursued by various poltergeists representing each of the three. The album's front cover drawing shows the three band members, each pictured with their poltergeist alter-egos.

Although not the hit that West, Bruce and Laing's debut album Why Dontcha was, Whatever Turns You On was a moderate success, reaching #87 on the Billboard U.S. album chart.
