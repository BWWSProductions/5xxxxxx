From BOT:

Historian Hugh Ambrose deepens the experience of the HBO miniseries The Pacificâ€”revealing the intertwined odysseys of four U.S. Marines and a U.S. Navy carrier pilot and producing a powerful blend of first-person immediacy and historical perspective.

Sidney C. Phillips, an easygoing Alabama teenager, enlisted along with a buddy. â€œManila Johnâ€ Basilone was the son of immigrants who found happiness in the rough-and-ready life of a marine. Eugene B. Sledge watched his best friend and his brother go off to warâ€”and finally rebelled against his parents to follow them. â€œShiftyâ€ Shofner was the scion of a prominent family with a long record of military service. Ensign Vernon â€œMikeâ€ Micheel left the family farm to complete flight school.  

Between Americaâ€™s retreat from China in late 1941 and the moment that MacArthurâ€™s plane landed in Japan in August 1945, these five men fought many of the key battles of the war in the Pacific. Here, Hugh Ambrose focuses on their real-life experiences and those of their fellow servicemen, enhancing and expanding upon the story told in the HBO miniseries.
