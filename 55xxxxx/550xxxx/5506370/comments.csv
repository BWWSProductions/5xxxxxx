uh, what? what half? 
try starting with ""The Pacific 001_BOT.mp3"" and
then move onto ""The Pacific 002..."" etc.

the first half of... WWII? There's been a few words written about it.
Start with the links in the torrent description, or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II

if all that fails, you could try a more cogent query."
