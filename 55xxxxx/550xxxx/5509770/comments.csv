I searched everywhere but i cant get the Audio drivers for XP.I'm using HP Pavillion DV4 1125NR. i had Vista which i formatted earlier coz it was a crap and installed 7 but windows 7 is even not better than XP.I just need to get Audio drivers for Windows XP for my notbook Dv41125nr. HELP ME Coz i spend days and hours locating the drivers but i couldnt get it.. THANKS ALOT IF YOU CAN BE A SUPERMAN."

There is a link to a driver that looks promising. Try that. If that does not work...

That is a link to a torrent to raw extracted drivers on one image. You can burn that to a DVD or mount the image... the try and install the drivers from there by setting the driver update to auto search for the correct drive from that DVD. 

If neither work, sign up on my site and i'll gather more details from you about your laptop http://www.GuruFuel.com/

We'll get it fixed dont worry."

Copied antiwpa.dll to %systemroot%\system32\ manually and it worked.

I cannot see any copy command in the .CMD.
Did I miss something."
