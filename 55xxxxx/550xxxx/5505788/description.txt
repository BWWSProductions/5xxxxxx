Alex welcomes back to the show Bob Bowman [hour 3, 1st half hour 4], the former Director of Advanced Space Programs Development for the U.S. Air Force in the Ford and Carter administrations, and a former United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 combat missions. Bowman was an early public critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") during the Ronald Reagan administration. In 2000, he campaigned nationwide for the nomination of the Reform Party of the United States of America for President of the United States. Bowman talks with Alex about NASA, the space program, Iran's alleged nuclear program and the threat of false flag nuclear terrorism in the United States.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
