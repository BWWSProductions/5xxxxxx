        The awakening of unstoppable Majin Buu!

        The forces  of good  and evil  have converged  upon the planet
        Earth, and the fate of the universe hangs in the balance!  The
        evil wizard Babidi has traveled  across the galaxy on a  quest
        for revenge, hoping to fulfill his father's thwarted dreams of
        universal domination. Meanwhile, the  Supreme Kai has come  to
        enlist  the aid  of the  Z-Fighters in  an effort  to prevent
        Babidi from completing  his plans and  awakening a monster  of
        unimaginable terror: Majin Buu!

        Vegeta, consumed by pride, has forced Goku into a deadly fight
        to the  finish! The  most incredible  battle of  the two Super
        Saiyans ensues. Can Goku convince his rival to battle the evil
        wizard Babidi instead?

        As Goku and  the Z-Fighters descend  into Babidi's lair,  they
        are confronted by an army of powerful minions led by the Demon
        King Dabura himself! Can  our heroes resist the  wizard's dark
        magic  and  battle their  way  through this  host  of villains
        before time runs out? With each passing second, more energy is
        gathered for the sleeping  Majin Buu. Should this  creature of
        pure  evil  be  awakened,  all life  -  everywhere  -  will be
        extinguished!
