John Shuttleworth, his wife Mary, their two teenage children Darren and Karen, neighbour Ken Worthington and a host of other minor characters were all voiced by comedian Graham Fellows.


Radio Shuttleworth was John's attempt to set up a local radio station "serving all of the Sheffield region - and a little bit further even" was broadcast as two series of Radio Shuttleworth. The programmes followed a similar format to The Shuttleworths, but their new length of thirty minutes allowed guest slots (Impress an Impresario, Make Mary Merry) and opportunities to interview celebreties on the show.

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
