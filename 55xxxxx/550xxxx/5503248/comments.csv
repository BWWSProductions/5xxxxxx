Good One.
Thanks. "
,tommo39,2010-04-19T09:22Z,"sorry,  the update of drivers showed total 14 were outdated, ""BUT IN FACT WERE OLDER"" than my current installed drivers!! try DRIVER MAX free program were available drivers are current!!"
,whitebread64,2010-04-19T15:13Z,"@tommo39.....yeah, 'cuz everyone wants to go through a multi-step process."
,bobbydog2009,2010-04-19T15:31Z,"Thanks hellboy, works perfectly :-)"

[V],Anacondaz,2010-04-20T02:46Z,"THANKS FOR THE UP MATE
IT INSTALLS FINE BUT IT FINDS SOME DRIVERS FOR MY COMPUTER BUT WHEN I GIVE DOWNLOAD ALL IT FAILS TO DOWNLOAD THE DRIVERS ANY SOLUTION FOR THIS PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ PROVIDE
ONCE AGAIN THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD AND KEEP UP UR GUD WORK"
,bobbydog2009,2010-04-20T09:05Z,If a driver stops downloading click on each driver & click download until its complete. Install in the order they are listed one at a time. This worked for me anyway :-)  
[V],Anacondaz,2010-04-20T14:08Z,"@bobbydog2009
thanks for ur kind reply mate
i will try as you said and  tell wat happens"
,ursupermann222,2010-04-21T02:43Z,"It installed nice and quick, but every time It asks me to register and fix my drivers, the program freezes and shuts down. I tried running it as admin, but the same thing happened. I am running on windows 7 ult. thanks"
,bobbydog2009,2010-04-21T07:57Z,"@ursuperman222
Did you disconect from the internet before installing? I'd disconect, uninstall & try again.
Install programe, enter serial & then scan, when complete connect again, your drivers should then start downloading. Afterwards run the updates if you wish but dont try & register  on the website as it will fail!
I'm running windows 7 64 bit, it even detected a missing driver for my wireless mouse :-)  "
,OTHELO_CJ,2010-04-21T15:56Z,THANKS
[V],Anacondaz,2010-04-21T19:48Z,"@bobbydog2009
thanks mate it worked fine for me now"
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-04-23T02:55Z,"I am installing on WINXPPROSP3. I go offline. Install. Enter serial. Now, go back online.

When I attempt to update [driver DB], the program [repeatedly] attempts to download the main program [same version]. After the download, and install [again], I enter that serial [again]. Now, the program is back to ""Trial"". I can't get past the program update in order to do the Driver DB update. And, the program remains in ""Trial"" mode. Re-entering the serial when online or off has no effect. In the past, I was able to go offline, install, enter serial, and go back online. Sometimes, I would have to repeat this process, but it always worked.

Are there ""hidden"" files that have to be dealt with, or anything like that? I use Revo Uninstaller Pro to uninstall and then search out files and search out registry entries for a thorough uninstall.

Any ideas? This behavior of Drive Genius is new to me."
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-04-23T04:59Z,"Anyone know how to ""configure""/hack the ""LiveUpdate"" app to ignore the program update and just do the driver DB update?"
,the_one_one,2010-04-23T23:14Z,"hellboy did a great job but IMHO Driver Genius is a piece of crap.  Most drivers provided are old or impossible to download.
I prefer the free option of DriverMax."
,McNavdo,2010-04-29T02:05Z,i think the same people are posting on here with different names. If you prefer Driver Max then why are you on here downloading Driver Genius? Stop trying to get people to download a free program that is most likely riddled with viruses
,seveconfidential,2010-04-29T20:22Z,no longer works ... 
,AstoMiyaki,2010-05-02T20:27Z,"I am running win 7 ultimate,driver genius pro works like a charm....
@arulkarthik::if you can't download the detected drivers then go to windows firewall>allowed programs,and add driver genius pro..the downloads will start..
thank you ""hellboy""!!! and
 fok you ""driver robot"" & ""seveconfidential"""
,Revolutie,2010-05-05T02:04Z,"Im running Win7 and installed while offline and copied the crack. Yet when i go to enter key, it keeps saying ""Incorect Licence Code""...What am i doing wrong?"
,ExternalBleeding,2010-05-11T03:46Z,Downloading now. Will tell you how it works. Slow download speed though...
,visable3,2010-05-11T20:14Z,"worked for me hellboy but it don,t update all drivers thanx very much  not your fault its a shit app. "

Worked fine for me. I am running Windows XP Home Edition.  

Thanks for the upload! Will seed for awhile."
,pivotgamer84,2010-06-12T05:34Z,"If you update it, just use the same serial as provided, but remove ALL the dashes.
Eg.
BVADJM-PS89CP-GGQ6C4-59PNTT-FS6H5W-Q7SYSH

Becomes

,pcorlatan,2010-08-22T21:33Z,"Running XP SP3 I installed the program, updated it once install finished, reopened program and entered serial without dashes. Once program restarted I was good to go! Didn't have to disconnect from the internet or anything. Thanks guys!"
,pcorlatan,2010-08-22T21:40Z,by the way if you try installing multiple drivers at a time you may run into issues like I have. I suggest you install one at a time but don't worry about restarting the computer after each one if it asks
,prov1ball,2010-08-25T01:31Z,thanks hellboy... this may have saved my pc!
,mumsabout,2010-08-25T15:55Z,At last something that works and is easy to follow for someone old and dim like me. When downloaded I updated and put in the code without the dashes and it worked so thank you such a lot hellboy I had 457 outdated drivers.

,ArcAngel66,2010-09-05T14:05Z,"Okay, I'm new to the whole torrent thing & after installing this, I registered the serial in the license code section & it said thanks for registering, but after scanning, it asked for it again, opens a web page to purchase v10 & the code does not work -- am I doing something wrong..."
,ArcAngel66,2010-09-05T14:21Z,"Okay, saw a post about taking out dashes and this worked... Good job hellboy!"

,XenoSilvano,2010-10-15T17:31Z,"The serial didn't work at first because the program updated--but luckily someone had already figured that out.

for some weird reason 1 of my driver go a red 'x' so it did come through, I only managed to update 1 of my drivers so far, but hopefully they'll call come through at a later date.

Thanks a lot!"
