Driver Genius is a powerful driver manager for Windows that can backup, restore and update your drivers in several mouse clicks!
Backup Drivers - Driver Genius can detect and quickly backup the installed drivers in your system. It can compress the backup drivers to a zip file, self extracting file or an independent auto installer program.

Restore Drivers - You need not install drivers one-by-one after reinstalling your operating system. Just one click is all you need to install all your backup drivers automatically. You can also install drivers in command mode silently.

Update/Search Drivers - Are you still using an old driver or beta version drivers? These faulty drivers often cause compatibility problems and are one of the main causes of system crashes. A suitable driver can improve hardware performance by 50% or even more. There is information on more than 30,000 device drivers in the Driver Genius Database including Motherboard, Sound card, Video card, Network card, Modem, Mouse, Keyboard, Scanner, Printer, Digital devices etc. With one mouse click, Driver Genius can detect what drivers need updating. All drivers we offer are official version or WHQL versions--you can use them without any worries.

Uninstall Drivers - There could be some leftover drivers in your system due to hardware changes or previous driver updates. Driver Genius can find these useless drivers quickly and uninstall them.

LiveUpdate - We will update large numbers of drivers on our website. You can synchronize your database with our website to get the latest driver versions through the Liveupdate feature.
