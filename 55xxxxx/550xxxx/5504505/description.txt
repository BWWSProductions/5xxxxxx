Policeman ANDY (Andy Lau) is assigned to protect Dr. Masterson and repels the assassination attempt, but his wife MILLIE (BingBing Fan) and cyborg captain KALON's (Louis Fan) younger brother are killed during the battle. Andy and Kalon both vow revenge.

Still determined to regain control of the world's energy, the cartel send Kalon and his cyborgs back in time to the present to kill Dr. Masterson as a teenager.
