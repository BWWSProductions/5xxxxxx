[V],r3dcat,2010-04-23T11:08Z,"Works fine for me with Configurable USB Loader v56; 4.0E; Hermes cIOS 222 v4 38 merged 37

Check http://gbatemp.net for info ... from brief read I saw comments that this game required a cIOS 37 base/merge to work. "
[V],r3dcat,2010-04-23T12:46Z,@Gopher662: Also you don't need to convert .wbfs file to .iso to transfer to your WBFS flash drive ... just use Wii Backup Manager to transfer .wbfs file directly to your WBFS flash drive.
,false_god,2010-05-09T18:26Z,"Great torrent ! This copy of Monster Hunter 3 is CONFIRMED to work with USB loader GX. To pass the beeping noise and the black screen, you need to either apply Hermes cios 222 and 223 v4 or apply cios 249. After, load your game according to the cios that you chose to install. "

After hours of frustration, I downloaded cIOS 223 and put that as the IOS for the game and it worked perfectly.

Thanks for the torrent"
