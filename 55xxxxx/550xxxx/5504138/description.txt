ASUR - The Current Disaster Declaration from the Usual Lies Club

Three times you may guess who invented the warning about a disaster in the 
air by volcanic dust? Yes, it's the usual suspects, the Met Office, the 
British weather service, who has already served us the lies about global warming 
and one of the parties involved in the scandal is Climategate. The Volcanic 
Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) is operated by the Met Office. 


Kopp - Volcanic Ashes, Computer Simulations and Panic in Air Traffic

Now it turns out that the shut down of air traffic over Europe was not even based
on real-life scientific measurements, but on a computer-simulation, computers
being run by the British MET Office. What a hoax.


Comment: I guess I was wrong about the exercise of NATO being connected to the shutdown of airspace, but the ashes over Europe story is a fake anyway. There are NO ashes. And that's that. What I noticed is this: Birds have been singing much louder in recent days where I live, and I'm not the only one having noticed this. This may be an indicator for the purity of air. Drunvalo Melchizedek writes about this effect in one of his books. The Illuminati really must believe that the public is completely stupid - and they are right. Perhaps this entire event is just a test run for mind control. Perhaps they're testing how far they can go, and to what degree people believe nonsense they're told to believe in. Brave new world.
