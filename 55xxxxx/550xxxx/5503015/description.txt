Sara Haze is a 19-year old California singer-songwriter who is wise beyond her
years. A professional singer from the age of twelve, Haze has ruled stages from
Canadian Music Week to SXSW to Popkomm. You might have heard HazeÃ†s songs on
shows MTVÃ†s The Hills, and youÃ†ll be certain to hear her from a slew of outlets
over the next few years. Haze projects a distinctive authenticity; a sweet and
sunny disposition underwritten by an emotional toughness built from
self-confidence. These qualities come through in spades on HazeÃ†s debut album,
My Personal Sky.

My Personal Sky opens with "Beautiful Day", a highly produced pop/rock anthem
about finally coming into the clear after hard times. This could be the perfect
summer song both for message and feel. If "Beautiful Day" finds the right breaks
this could be a huge hit for Haze. "Melt Into You" is a big-time romantic rocker
that is not only another potential hit but also a likely favorite for mix tape
makers. Haze shows a bit more vulnerability on "My Own Hands To Hold", and
angst-filled ballad about a relationship stuck in a bad cycle. The song itself
is fair, but Haze turns it into something more with a vibrant, emotionally
charged but not over-the-top performance.

In order for an album to really break out and become a cornerstone recording for
an artist, there has to be at least one song that could be called magical in
there somewhere. Sara Haze finds that magic with "Every Heart"; rumination on
all the things that make our life stories special. "Every Heart" is the sort of
tune that could become the signature song of an artist over the course of a long
career; one that becomes so identified with an artist that others cover it at
their peril. The commercial possibilities for "Every Heart" are endless. It's a
great pop number, but also has the feel of a keynote song from a Broadway show
or the opening theme from a major motion picture.
Haze gives listeners a different look on "Mama", a sassy and soulful rocker that
could be "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" for the modern age. Haze gives a powerful positive
voice to self-respect and standing up for what you believe in a turn that's both
a vibrant musical statement and a defining song as a potential role model for
young women (people) everywhere. What makes "Mama" work so well is that Haze
isn't trying to be like anyone else here; there's no duplicity or attempt to
capture another's zeitgeist. Haze is just being herself and the rest all
follows. "Lovely" is another powerful ballad with a positive message. Anyone
whoÃ†s ever felt pressured by someone they love to be something they aren't will
identify strongly with this tune. The licensing potential here is huge; and
while the commercial radio pop of the song is low because of the tempo and
arrangement, the universality of the message might be enough to overcome such
things.

Haze rips though "Counterfeit Hero" with ease before jumping into "Shine"; a
tune about not letting the dark times get you down. Haze implores listeners to
make and be their own light in a powerfully positive song of self-actualization.
Haze only seems to get distracted once on the entire album, as "The Border" just
seems a bit out of synch with the rest of My Personal Sky, but recovers nicely
with the rock anthem "Church Of Memories". Haze seems intent on re-iterating her
support of self-actualization over faith in something else in a closer that
affirms Haze's prowess as a pop songwriter and performer.

My Personal Sky, in a perfect world, would be the sort of pop/rock album that
launches Sara Haze into the musical stratosphere. Haze is no plastic, singing
about her beliefs in a firm voice that evokes vulnerability run through with a
spine of smoky steel. It's hard to imagine My Personal Sky not making big waves
on radio, television and in motion pictures. This sort of pop/rock hybrid is
rare these days, and there is an appetite for such hybrids, but the shambles of
commercial radio and the absolute flooding of net-based radio by anyone with a
home computer and recording software makes it a bit harder for the diamonds to
shine. Sarah Haze is a diamond, and My Personal Sky sparkles with the light of
her sunny disposition and the strength of her songwriting and voice. Don't miss
this one.
