Professor Toto is a series of multi-award winning language education tools for ages 2 to 12. Animated DVDs introduce a stimulating menagerie of characters who teach French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese or German. Youngsters watch, sing, laugh, and interact with other kids, a funny professor, language-building songs, and lively classroom lessons. And because children are emotionally engaged in a language immersion setting, they really learn. Great for toddlers, preschoolers, and K-6.
