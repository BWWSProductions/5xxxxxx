Samantha Fox has troubles galore when, in order to inherit a sizable fortune, she must solve a riddle her father left for her. The riddle is "What is French, turns on at night and gives good crown?" Samantha is gorgeous, but not especially ...    Full Descriptionbright, and solving the riddle is going to take all the brain waves she can muster. Making things even harder is her nasty Aunt Celeste, who will get the money if Samantha can't solve the riddle. When Samantha hears that her uncle in New York might be able to help, she goes off to find him, and ends up undertaking an odyssey through a plush Big Apple swingers' club. An amusing, very arousing adult comedy!
