This is the message given at the Kryon Summer Light Conference in Sedona Arizona in June. It's a similar message to the one below, but with lots of enhancements, and, (trumpet goes here), it was given in English to an English speaking audience. This may seem like it's not an important thing, but it really is. When channelling to another culture with stops and starts, allowing translations to occur, the syntax is odd, and the message often feels segmented. Here is the chance to offer good information to an audience who speaks the language of the channeller. It's a good message... filled with good advice for this new energy, and things to come.
