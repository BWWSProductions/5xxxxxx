,lm108,2010-11-22T08:26Z,"Thanks eldiego90. I installed the AWM with keygen earlier this year. The keys would only work until next logon, AWG would activate, then minutes into a session I'd get a window stating the trial had expired (since I ad it installed so long). Generate a new key, AWG works but start the cycle with next log on, or close the dialigue and AWG stayed off. I've had no problem since using your serial, and was even able to upgrade to version 6.2 without hassle. "
