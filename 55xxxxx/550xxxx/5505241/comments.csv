,kashx5,2010-05-03T12:27Z,No proper English subs available for this yet. Don't download if u don't understand Chinese.
,Poglodyte,2010-05-04T06:30Z,"Yeah well it's too late for that.  Damn, what a tease.  I want to watch it so much but not without subs.  Can anyone around translate this and make subs?  I'd be overjoyed :)"
,Poglodyte,2010-05-12T08:04Z,Finally some English subs out for this! http://subscene.com/english/Fire-of-Conscience--For-lung/subtitle-328734.aspx They seem to be in sync and pretty well translated.
