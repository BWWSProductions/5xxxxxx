[T],artpepper,2010-04-18T13:52Z,"Anything in particular, @jasper? Stuff with Mountain or later things like Bruce, West and Laing (my favourites)?"
,jasperjoy,2010-04-19T00:11Z,"Hey art,I have his mountain stuff,but none of his solo output,I have heard the Great Fatsby is one of his better ones,but would love to hear any of his work,especially his collaborations with Bruce & Corky ! Cheers."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-19T03:25Z,"@jasper, I'll get some of it up for you in the next couple of days...I think you'll like the Bruce, West & Laing stuff. A lot like Mountain but better (I think) because of the great Jack Bruce on bass and vocals..."
