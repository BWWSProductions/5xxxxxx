FLAWL3SS NOTES:
Thanks to polo2268 for releasing this on a public tracker awesome release dude. As with all screeners they are flat in colors and sharpness and yes it has the logos
. It would had taken to much time to blur and really makes the pic worse since it has 2 bottom of the screen and right hand corner. Also they are always interlaced to so took care of that also.
