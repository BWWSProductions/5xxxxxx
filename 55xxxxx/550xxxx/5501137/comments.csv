@jason_sepht-reborn:
These are the only books you need to play - technically, all you need is the Core Book. Everything else included in the torrent is optional material."

Notably, the ""Rigger"" supplement is not here. More imporatant to me though is, ""Dragons of the 6th World"". That one's awsome. I'll upload it if I ever get around to going through all that storage."
,tinynik,2012-05-14T04:22Z,"Correction to my earlier post. I finally got my hands on it, and ""Dragons of the 6th World"" is a late 3E book. Still there are a lot of recent publications like ""Parabotany"", etc, that are not present, but the core stuff is here for sure."
