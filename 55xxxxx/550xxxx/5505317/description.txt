DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S ORIGINAL SERIES "OUT OF THE WILD: THE ALASKA EXPERIMENT" Puts nine strangers to THE ULTIMATE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL TEST

Would YOU volunteer to be abandoned deep in the Alaskan interior on the brink of winter with eight strangers and attempt to find civilization with nothing more than the clothes and gear on your back? Meet the nine daring people who abandoned the comforts of home to test their ability to survive in one of the most physically and mentally demanding environments in the world. 

OUT OF THE WILD: THE ALASKA EXPERIMENT is a riveting depiction of man's struggle against nature. 

In September 2008, nine amateur hikers, campers and outdoor enthusiasts put their lives on hold to take on the opportunity, and challenge, of a lifetime. After a three-day crash course in basic survival skills, including how to shoot a gun, skin an animal and start a fire without matches, the volunteers were flown to Ttsusena Lake in the rugged Alaskan interior. 

There they were given the first piece of a rudimentary map (additional pieces were given to the team along the route), a compass and a few basic tools and told to hike to civilization before the harsh winter weather sets in. 

For all their struggles, the brave volunteers weren't being offered a million-dollar prize or seven-figure job at the end of their journey. Their reward was the chance to have a life-changing experience and the potential to never see their lives the same way again.
