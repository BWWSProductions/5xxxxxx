I looked for it on here first and when I saw no one had posted it, I uploaded it. On the second day, over 300 users were trying to download it. Please seed this at least 2 to 1 so others can enjoy it too. I am the only person on the planet who uploaded this and I really could use the help seeding it. Thanks TPB Family....."

,galaxyworldwide877,2010-10-29T06:39Z,"I'm actually kinda pissed off. I have given this to 50 people so far and there's only 5 seeds? I'm not saying make this a permanent pc. of your life, just seed it to 2 people b4 u delete it, please. That is the only way a torrent grows. Yeah my HDD is overwhelmed too, but at least give it to one person b4 u quit it. They killed Limewire, man this is war. We have to keep torrents alive, Please seed 2:1 at least. Thanks. "
