"
,stardude,2010-05-22T15:31Z,"I think I found a way to make it work!!

After countless attempts last night and today I finally decided to dump this and go with a ""rearm"" solution instead.

I then uninstalled the KMS servicel.

After a lil pooking around in the glorious interwebwes this one stood out among the rest:
The InfiniteRearm4 Project - Run Windows 7 forever without cracks, patches or loaders
http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/19113-The-InfiniteRearm4-Project-Run-Windows-7-forever-without-cracks-patches-or-loaders

I printed the instructions to be sure I didn't miss anything and completed all steps as stated.

w00t!! My 4 initial Rearms had been reset! Niiiice!!

Then I thought, well, lets just try the KMS activator thingy once more just to see what it says.

So, I installed the service, then directly clicked on Activate Windows VL and answered ""n"" to the question about the key, then I chose ""c"" to select the win 7 enterprise key. The activator started to do it's thing....

Then BAM!!!!

ACTIVATED!! on the first activation attempt!
w0h00!!!

So, for all of you who haven't been able to get this activator to work properly, try the same thing I did and reset your Windows 7 Rearm function with the InfiniteRearm4 v1.9.3 thingy first.

If, for some strange reason, the activator still won't work you will then have unlimited rearms automatically set for you.

I hope this will be of some help =)"

,stardude,2010-05-24T00:12Z,"hi rodbrenz =)

yup, the license service you install with the activator does the thing m$ servers would normally do, or it wouldn't work.

if you have the same problems I had try my workaround and install the InfiniteRearm4 fix instead. that will let you run windows 7 enterprise forever by resetting (rearming) the four 30 days trials infinitely. =)

after I had done that and got all four of my rearms back the activator worked on the very first attempt =)

the activators own rearm function didn't work for me, it shortened my trial time instead =\"

,Cancerspirit,2010-07-31T15:31Z,"Al-right guys here's a way to activate both your MS office 2010 and MS Visio 2010 permanently, but first you need to have;

1. Ms Office 2010 installed, which you can get from here 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5466262/Microsoft_Office_2010_Pro_Plus_x64__amp__x86_14.0.4743.1000_Full

2. Download the Windows 7 loader, from here 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5621974/Windows_7_Loader_eXtreme_Edition_v3.503-NAPALUM_DiBYA

3. Download and Install Visio 2010 

Right, if you have already MS office 2010 installed that's good (don't worry if it's not activated). If not follow step 1. 

After you have installed both MS Office 2010 & Visio 2010, extract with WinRar (what you downloaded in step 2) and place the extracted W7lxe.exe into C drive (C:\)

Then go to 'Run' from start menu and type ""C:\w7lxe.exe /office2010"" press enter and you are done!, Office 2010 and Visio 2010 is Activated & Updates work also. Enjoy!
---------------------------------------------------------- this worked for me so it should work for others

P.S. It is an activator for the whole MS Office suite so it also activates Visio 2010. But u cant just activate Visio alone, u need to have whole MS Office suite installed."
