,Lostfreak101,2010-04-21T09:53Z,why you got 2 files of 720p  up?
,xr0,2010-04-21T12:32Z,"Because both of the other ones from IMMERSE have problems with video/audio-sync (no, you can't re-sync it with VLC - I tried)."
,Lostfreak101,2010-04-21T12:35Z,so this one good works all good audio and video in sync??
,jahnee,2010-04-21T13:13Z,"and I woke up earlier to watch my finished download only to find out out it was fucking out of sync, is this one ok?"
,xr0,2010-04-21T14:19Z,"Yes, I just downloaded it and flicked through it - and it's good. In sync and everything."
