,PollosHermanos,2011-01-27T01:31Z,"Um w-t-f. Okay the quality is fairly decent. But it is a complete waste of nearly 4GB? I was expecting 720p at least, it's just DVDrip? You should just bother downloading something else because it also took about 2 days to download in u torrent."
,Eyeseeker,2011-03-22T01:47Z,"PollosHermanos is incorrect. This is well worth downloading. Quality is good, it takes a little time to download, but it is worth it. Thanks for the upload."
,chris1108,2011-04-11T04:35Z,"Agreed Eyeseeker. This is a quality upload, well worth a little extra downloading time! Thanks very much CharlieAllnut51. :)"

,masterac,2011-05-17T11:03Z,"i agree with PollosHermanos, for 4 giga, the quality does suck, ok its very good quality, but when you compare to this 2g rip http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6373233/Dances_with_Wolves_1990_20th_Anniversary_Extended_Cut_720p_BRRip

the quality is the same, but this rip is 2giga bigger....so is a dvd rip, too bad there isnt any good BD rip, with 4giga you get top quality normaly"

Maybe you'll say i'm not fair but you can try this one:                             http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6437893/Dances_with_Wolves_[1990]_ExtCut_720p_BRRip_XviD_AC3_-_CODY"

You're kidding, right? The file for this torrent was 3.9GB and that was just the file for the movie. It took me almost 6hrs to DL (speaking of which, there needs to be some seeding for this. HELLO!) And it was made in the 90s. If you want better, BUY IT or shut up!!!"
