I think it is kind of weird to hear Buzz voiced by someone other than Tim Allen, however, I don't think my 3 year old will mind.  He is a huge fan of everything related to Pixar and will enjoy the heck out of these.

I am sometimes guilty of stopping a torrent that has plenty of seeders after I finish downloading, but I will be seeding 1 to 1 on this one."
