,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T04:28Z,whaoh!!!! wtf was that? ... give me your own screen shots
,vlal21,2010-04-23T04:29Z,I have uber fast net speed. Once I download I can seed non-stop for weeks so please seed.
,jrdaigle1000,2010-04-23T04:35Z,"@vlal21 I'm seeding as fast as I can. I don't have the best upload, so just be patient.
@weaping_reaper Listen dude, I spent two hours of my valuable time ripping this and am spending quite a bit of my valuable bandwidth seeding it. If you can't appreciate that and spend five seconds doing a simple Google search, you don't deserve the download. I may have provided screenshots if TPB didn't explicitly require use of BayImg. Talk to the staff, not me."
,vlal21,2010-04-23T04:50Z,Okay dude thanks for the upload. I will see how it goes. As of now I'm downloading at less then 1.30k a second. 
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T04:53Z,"well dude, I love you for what you do, never Stop!! but i have a 7gig version, that is almost Blu-ray, and all I wanted to see is if this one is better, .. Thank all of yall for what you do. ..."
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T04:54Z,Also.. a Simple 2 min sample would Safice
,bajungadustin,2010-04-23T07:13Z,"He wasnt asking for you to ""let me google that for you"" screen shots.

he obviously knows that the movie is... he was asking for SCREEN SHOTS of YOUR version... so in other words... open up the move... press the Print Screen button and then post the result here so people can see the quality.

,weaping_reaper,2010-04-23T07:17Z,wow.. lmao @ bajungadustin .. spectacular!
,cactuspete,2010-04-24T21:13Z,"Thanks jrdaigle1000!

Your offering is much appreciated...if you can't post video specs then maybe I will for the sake of others once the dl is finished.  It would be great if you could upload this in superseed mode so it could finish much faster...coz at this rate people may have to be patient downloading this until mid-next week.

Looking forward to seeing the quality...thx again!"
,jrdaigle1000,2010-04-27T23:47Z,"Yeah... sorry about that. Had internet trouble then home server trouble. It's now uploading at up to 150KB/s and quite a few others are seeding, so it should be more out there now. Thanks for seeding people! I'll continue to do the same for quite awhile."
