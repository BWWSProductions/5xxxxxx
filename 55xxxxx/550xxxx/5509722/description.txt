THE ULTIMATE TROUBLESHOOTER (TM)   
 
 
A staggering  65%  of problems which a PC encounters (lockups, crashes, blue screens of death, 

computer is running slow, sluggish PC), whether in business or at home, are not caused by hardware 

problems, they are not caused by viruses, they are not caused by spyware â€” they are caused by 

background tasks belonging largely to legitimate and well-known software you use every day ! 

The average PC has 25 or more background tasks which do not need to be running, all sucking up 

processor time and memory resources.  25 or more !

For example :  perhaps you have a laptop which works wirelessly in your home with no problems 

whatsoever.  However, when you take it on your travels you are unable to connect to any wireless 

network.  You're frustrated, you've asked a friend to help, you've been to the PC repair store â€” and 

still no joy â€” you can use wireless only in your own home !!  This is where The Ultimate 

Troubleshooter (TUT) comes in :  load it, and immediately it identifies for you the background task 

which is causing this nightmare.  And the irony :  the wireless router installation CD sent to you by 

your Internet Service Provider installed that task, and, naturally, you never suspected it might be 

the cause of all your problems.   See what's new in Version 4 ! 

This is just one of the many benefits which have made The Ultimate Troubleshooter (TUT) the PC Tuning 

and PC Troubleshooting tool of choice for Home Users, Small Businesses, and IT Specialists and Large 

Corporations alike.  TUT is PC healthcare, PC repair, PC tuning, and PC maintenance in Plain English

After downloading several torrents for this I had problems with the keygens they supplied having 

trojans.  I discovered I had a keygen from DVT for version 4.64 that did not report a trojan so I've 

put this torrent together with that keygen which works with version 4.92 as well. I have installed on 

three machines, 2 Windows 7 and XP Pro SP3 with no problems.  Enjoy!
