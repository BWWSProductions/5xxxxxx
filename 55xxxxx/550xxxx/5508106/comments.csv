,ruchirrathore,2010-05-09T17:58Z,"Hi, Can i use it with a retail copy of win7? I am actually developing a slipstream dvd for win7 with many programs built in and remove all the unnecessary features. I've 2 options: 1. use a preactivated copy of win7 or 2. use a retail ISO image and then use a loader program like this.
Tell me if I am wrong anywhere.. please guide.."
