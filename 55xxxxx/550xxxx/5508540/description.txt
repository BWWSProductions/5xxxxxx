After an unparalleled career, characterised by constant musical experimentation, we should be used to Paul Wellerâ€™s relentless desire to chop and change his musical pack. But after the triumphant, Brit-bagging success of '22 Dreams' (his third solo number one) 'Wake Up The Nation' album sees rockâ€™s most iconic songwriter come up trumps once more.

Lean, mean and as uncompromisingly focused as itâ€™s maker, Wake Up The Nation also brings Paul Weller full circle: twenty-eight years on from The Jamâ€™s split, two tracks feature the former bassist Bruce Foxton. The album also sees contributions from My Bloody Valentineâ€™s Kevin Shields, The Moveâ€™s Bev Bevan and legendary session drummer Clem Cattini.

Passion, progression, and, as ever, spine-tingling rockâ€™nâ€™roll â€“ Paul Weller has, yet again delivered the perfect soundtrack as we embark on a new decade.
