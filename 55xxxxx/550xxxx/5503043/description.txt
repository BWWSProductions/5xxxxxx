"Chief of Hearts"

Homer is completing his court-ordered community service when 
he befriends his supervisor, Chief Wiggum, by offering him 
one of his sandwiches. Touched by the act of kindness, 
Wiggum assigns the other convicts unpleasant tasks, but 
allows Homer to join him at the picnic table. They continue 
to grow close, but when the Chief gets injured during a 
botched bank robbery, Homer doesn't come through when Wiggum 
needs him the most. Meanwhile, Bart becomes addicted to 
Battle Ball, a Japanese game made up of plastic balls and 
magnetic cards, and his family and teachers try to help him 
kick the habit.

Enjoy :)
