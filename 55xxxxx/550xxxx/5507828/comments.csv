,michaelrwatson,2010-04-25T22:52Z,"The blurred area near the bottom of the screen is fucking retarded. It's there ALL the time, even though dialog is only a fraction of the screen time. Far more annoying than the Asian subs it replaced. This is shit, done by stupid fuckheads. No thanks to you either raymondhome."
