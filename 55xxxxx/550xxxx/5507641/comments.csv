,slats649,2010-04-26T14:56Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."

Piracy rocks!!"
,jambuban,2010-05-19T21:48Z,"Dude cut the crap..
everybody undestands that watching a downloaded TS print is nothing close to watching it on multiplex screens..
So, go ahead and njoy urself watching it on 70''
Let us poor ppl watch it on our 17''"
,jambuban,2010-05-19T23:21Z,"Waiting for Iron man 2 dvdrip and date night dvdrip.
Plz upload as soon as possible.
Thanx."
,wdwmkr,2010-05-26T07:29Z,"Great movie, went and saw in theatres. And ur right, probably will be frontrunner for next animated film, screens look great, getting it so fam can watch. and remember SEED"
,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:49Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
