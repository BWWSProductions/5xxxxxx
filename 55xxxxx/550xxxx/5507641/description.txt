FLAWL3SS NOTES
vid was from cinejunkiez and audio was from rx (thanks bros)
right opted to try lower the contrast as in some part's it looked really white, after doing that played with the white balance and so on, used a denoiser and done some slight colouringchanges and used a nice sharpen filter :)
enjoy from team FLAWL3SS
