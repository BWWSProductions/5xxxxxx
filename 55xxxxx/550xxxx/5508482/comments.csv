,drake_nightfire,2010-10-05T00:06Z,are these english dubbed or subtitled?
,mdh524,2010-12-16T05:31Z,These are DVD images so you can change language and subtitle options in the menu.
,Stevie173205,2011-03-16T05:57Z,What should i use to open these files?
,gammatertiary,2011-03-28T10:09Z,"Stevie, they are DVD images.  You mount them in a virtual CD/DVD software such as Daemon Tools and play them as if they were real DVDs."
,SirKiyoshi,2011-04-28T01:17Z,"Graa, I can't download them because of a filesize limit (?)
I've seen this before, when I tried to download AMV Hell dvd off their site, and found out it was because of a problem with my Hard drive not having the right file system.  Long story short, I can't do anything above 4 gigs, and I have no idea how to partition my drive :( I'm using an external drive for this, so maybe it'll be easier (?) could someone give me some tips?
Thanks in advance"

Symantec Partition Magic or EASEUS Partition Master will reformat any drive without removing the data. What you want is to reformat to NTFS file system."
