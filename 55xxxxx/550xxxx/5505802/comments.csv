 Wow ! What a mistake. Not only did it take all night to download the other one, but it looked like it was filmed with a slightly out-of-focus camera in front of an old TV in an electrical storm, complete with rolling horizontal lines and occasional static-y BZZZZT noises.

BTW - whoever was the seeder here was a real decent dude, cause he had a virtually unlimited pipe open and I saw I was reaching speeds of 1.6 MB/s. It only took 17 minutes to download this. I'm going to join him for a couple of months seeding this out of appreciation."
