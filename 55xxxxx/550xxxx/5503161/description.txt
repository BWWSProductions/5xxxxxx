IMDB:7.7/10   

The father, the mother and their three kids live at the outskirts of a city. There is a tall fence surrounding the house. The kids have never been outside that fence. They are being educated, entertained, bored and exercised in the manner that their parents deem appropriate, without any inï¬‚uence from the outside world. They believe that the airplanes ï¬‚ying over are toys and that zombies are small yellow ï¬‚owers. The only person allowed to enter the house is Christina. She works as a security guard at the fatherâ€™s business. The father arranges her visits to the house in order to appease the sexual urges of the son. The whole family is fond of her, especially the eldest daughter. One day Christina gives her as a present a headband that has stones that glow in the dark and asks for something in return.
