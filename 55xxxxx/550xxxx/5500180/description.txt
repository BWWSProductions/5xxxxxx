This remarkable performance, recorded at New York City's Bottom Line, when Seals opened a series of Buddy Guy and Junior Wells dates, captures the guitarist in incendiary form, several months before he expanded his quartet lineup to record his acclaimed live album, Live And Burning. Seals' slashing guitar work is all over this recording, which focuses on many of the best songs from his first two albums. During the fifth song of the set, Seals delights the audience by introducing legendary Texas guitar-slinger Johnny Winter to the stage. For the next half-hour, Winter joins the group, taking it to another level for the remainder of this blistering performance.
