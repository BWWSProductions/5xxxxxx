Workin' with The Miles Davis Quintet (1957)

@320 kbps







This LP, along with his three other classic Prestige albums - Cookin', Steamin', and Relaxin' (all uploaded by @artpepper)- is from Miles' first classic Quintet. One of the greatest small goups in jazz history, right up there with the Hot Fives and Sevens and the Kansas City Six.


This set is one of the strongest of the four Lps with the surpassing beauty of "It Never Entered My Mind," followed with "Four" -(a beatiful bit of relaxed yet spirited blowing) typifying the cohesion and remarkable flexibility of the band and it's way with both ballads and up- tempo numbers; standards and originals. 


Miles is really in his early prime and 'Trane is rapidly finding his voice - already showing the searching, adventurous brilliance the Miles had seen in him as a young man and that he would expand on with "Blue Trane" and his appearance in "Kind of Blue" and, of course, take to unbelievable peaks on Atlantic and Impulse. 


Don't overlook "the best rhythm section in Jazz," either. The interplay of the young Paul Chambers on bass, the somewhat underappreciated Red Garland on piano and the always wonderful Philly Joe Jones on drums really drives the music and is constantly flawless.




Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, New Jersey on May 11 & October 26, 1956. Originally released on Prestige (7166).
