BBC Wonders of the Solar System 5of5 1080i HDTV h264 AC3

Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

Part 5: Aliens
Brian descends to the bottom of the Pacific in a submarine to witness the extraordinary life forms that survive in the cold, black waters. All life on Earth needs water so the search for aliens in the solar system has followed the search for water. Soaring above the dramatic Scablands of the United States, Brian discovers how the same landscape has been found on Mars. And it was all carved out in a geological heartbeat by a monumental flood. Armed with a gas mask, Brian enters a cave in Mexico where bacteria breathe toxic gas and leak concentrated acid. Yet relatives of these creatures could be surviving in newly-discovered caves on Mars. But Brian's sixth wonder isn't a planet at all. Jupiter's moon Europa is a dazzling ball of ice etched with strange cracks. The patterns in the ice reveal that, far below, there is an ocean with more potentially life-giving water than all the oceans on Earth. Of all the wonders of the solar system forged by the laws of nature, there is one that stands out. In the final episode of this series, Brian reveals the greatest wonder of them all.

This is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.
You'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.
These have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.
If you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.
If you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.
The ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.
