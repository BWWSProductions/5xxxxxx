,maaadal,2010-04-21T21:27Z,I love this educational/documentary material. I have been registered at mvgroup site for a few of years already. Just curious if anyone knows of any other similar educational/documentary sites or uploaders 
,BasilBrush,2010-04-22T12:51Z,I haven't seen one. Most of this stuff is probably also available at private sites but you have to maintain a ratio. I'll do some hunting and see if I can come up with anything.

,Atsaluum,2010-12-03T10:43Z,Well touchĂŠ. It seems it has been released yesterday to open trackers and can be found all over by Googling Wonders.of.the.Solar.System.2010.Bluray.1080p.DTSHR.x264-CHD.torrent
