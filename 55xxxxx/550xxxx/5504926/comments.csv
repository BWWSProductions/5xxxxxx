,Don_16G2,2010-04-25T19:51Z,already pre-ordered the album but I dont mind listening a bit to it already :)
,DonThorr,2010-04-27T01:00Z,I have no idea what akoustik is talking about this album sounds amazing. Another great record from the black keys. Thanks bubanee!

[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-27T22:16Z,no problems on my end.  i have NEVER had a problem with anything from Bubanee.  he is by far the best of the best when it comes to music.
,akoustik,2010-04-30T07:13Z,"haha. this is awkward. i probably look pretty retarded, but i guess no one else is having problems, so please ignore my comment. :)"
,KitsuneNoKumori,2010-04-30T08:30Z,"@ akoustik

You may wish to check your audio prog if its a problem. if everything else works fine, try getting peerblock, the DL may have been corrupted by an AP2P... it happened to a friend of mine once."
,Jeffwa,2010-05-02T10:16Z,Sounds great. I was hoping this would be here and I should have known that it would be you! ^^  Thanks Bubanee
