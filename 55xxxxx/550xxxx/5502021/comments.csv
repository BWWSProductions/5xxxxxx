I'm at 9% seeding with 600 kb/sec"
,shinobiung,2010-04-21T16:18Z,this has to be the biggest active torrent? Best seasons are 13 and 16

IÂ´m doing a stydo about human behavior, accidentialy i happend to see some episods and got interesting, now i see there is as many as at least 20 season. Great. Think it will give me good material."
,markiu224,2010-04-29T04:35Z,Fantastic - Thank you soooo much for sharing this ; especially since some of the older episodes are so hard to come by :) I will seed for the next 2 or so weeks
,allmypeople,2010-05-01T18:30Z,"Thank you very much for this!

I know it doesn't help the seed but this is a good example of it being impossible to dload everything especially when there's a bunch of SHIT seasons (Fiji, Thailand, Vanautu, Marquesas, Guatemala, Gabon, Panama)...

I'm gunning for Borneo, Pearl Islands, Samosa, Amazon, China and all the rest. 

Pretty Close to Probst's list: http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20343257,00.html"

,rtallman,2010-05-09T23:14Z,"I had already written in the summary that it was missing Season 18. But if you find it somewhere else, go ahead and post it. Never could find it."
,allmypeople,2010-05-10T06:03Z,yeah... we'll definitely need more people on this for it to get anywhere.

,halfs3,2010-09-12T02:16Z,Had to go look up my password just to comment that you sir are a god amongst men. This shall be downloaded and seeded for a good long time... lets see how long it takes for me to get the rest now.
,stevee_23,2011-04-23T16:58Z,"can we get some people to seed, ive been downloading at about 4kb/s for the last 10 days now, ahahah"
,Dirkastanian,2011-05-17T07:16Z,Thanks for this amazing upload.
,CB125,2011-05-17T16:31Z,"Thanks for this! If you are still looking for Season 18, there is a great one right here on pirate bay http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5566137/Survivor_Season_18"
,strdrza,2011-05-18T14:40Z,"I have been downloading this for the past few weeks, sigh. It is usually always around 5kb/s, compared to my usual dl speed of 600 kb/s on all other torrents. Look, I do not mean to sound like I'm complaining, because on every lucky occasion the speed goes up to about 100kb/s, but could someone PLEASE seed this, be it the actual uploader, or just some random who happens to have the files, because I have been stuck on 70% for almost a month now tbh.

Thanks for the actual upload @rtallman, however the lack of seeders is very frustrating, and I have come to the conclusion that you are not seeding it either anymore, which increases my frustration. I never usually comment on torrents btw, as there are soi many trolls/spammers etc, the only reason I am writing this, is because it is a general plea to anyone who might have this! PLEASE!"
,Kevducharme,2011-06-01T09:31Z,Ditto here. Much appreciated folks. Thanks.
,jordanidk,2011-06-08T19:42Z,Thanks for uploading :) Speed isn't to bad expecially if you put the first five seasons on. Download those then while watching you can download the next five and so on and so fourth.
,pjakimov,2011-10-07T13:38Z,"we had  baltic edition of the survivor for 3 seasons, in each season there were three tribes, all with members from different countries, one Estonian tribe, one Lithuanian tribe and one Estonian tribe. The show ran 2000-2002, good times, good times:)"
,blackshadow101,2011-11-30T04:46Z,we don't get this show in the UK so thanks for the upload i have a LOT of watching to do!!!
