The Shotgun Diaries is John Wick's zombie survival horror roleplaying game. Using all the tropes of zombie horror as game mechanics, it is fast, easy to use and horrifying.

"Itâ€™s only eighteen pages. There is no artwork beyond some font variances. There are no graphs and no sidebars. You get no character sheet. There are some bullets, but that just seems sensible in a game about zombie survival (or is it Zombie survival?). Despite the utter lack of bells and whistles, it still costs five bucks (except mine was a free reviewerâ€™s copy from Wicked Dead Brewing Company). You know what else?

Itâ€™s totally worth skipping out on a combo meal to snatch up this booklet." - Flames Rising Review

Very fast paced action, a great horror-survival game.
