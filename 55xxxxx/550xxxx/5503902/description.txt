Lee Mack, also a star of ITV1's The Sketch Show, stars in this hilarious six part comedy first heard on BBC Radio 2.

Participating in the manic mix of sketches and stand-up are special musical guests Toyah Willcox, Midge Ure, Suggs, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Tom Robinson and Tony Hadley. Lee is also joined by comedians Noel Brixton, Mick Miller, Milton Jones, Rhod Gilbert, Mike Wilmot and Aussie Trevor Cook.

Ably assisted by long-suffering sidekick Angela McHale and house band leader Steve Brown (Knowing Me, Knowing You's Glenn Ponder), Lee Mack brings you a new show for the 21st century.

Where else can you hear Tony Hadley playing cops and robbers and Suggs amid ghostly goings-on? Just don't ask Midge Ure about Band Aid...

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" with the same files.
The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another,
All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
