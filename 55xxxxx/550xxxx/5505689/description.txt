In a desperate bid to save her low-performing sales team from the gallows, harried manager Catherine (Madison Walls) agrees to take advice from Neal (Steven Bauer), a slick, seasoned sales consultant with a knack for sealing deals -- no matter what the subject matter is. In the end, Neal's undeniable gift for gab could be a godsend. But it could also be the catalyst for both his and Catherine's undoing.
