,FrightfulActions,2010-04-26T23:56Z,"The quality is really good, but as someone whos downloaded nearly all the How to Train Your Dragon  torrents so far, I gotta say it looks like its basically being the same PrisM cam being reuploaded in different formats. This one is in a zip file, so I was suspicious, most zips tend to be that fake ""Download such and such player to watch this!"" then plays a beautiful preview of the movie...How they make a few seconds take up sometimes 1gb, I'll never know. But this wasnt the case this time, this upload is legit. While it is a cam, its a very nice quality, and you'll hardly tell or care that its cam rip when your watching. Theres no wobbling or anything. Tripod set up maybe? 
Anyway, the video is solid and the sound is decent, its definitely watchable. 

V/9 
A/8"

,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:49Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
