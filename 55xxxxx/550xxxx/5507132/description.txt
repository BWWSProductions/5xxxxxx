	Author: Chris Meyer

	Chris and Trish Meyer have been using After Effects since version
	1.0 and have written ten books about the program, and they are
	always among the first to dive into each new version and discover
	what it offers to their fellow motion graphics artists. Chris
	takes you under the hood and explains how each new feature works
	in After Effects CS5. This course covers both the technical and
	creative implications of this latest release, including tutorials
	on the new Roto Brush tool and mocha version 2, blending modes,
	text options, and new and improved user interface elements in
	Adobe After Effects CS5. Numerous examples show the most efficient
	ways to use the new features and avoid potential pitfalls when
	applying techniques. Chris ends with a discussion of which users
	will get them most out of upgrading to After Effects CS5.
