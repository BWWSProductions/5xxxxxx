The 1st Marine Division fight the Japaneseâ€”and the jungle conditionsâ€”at Cape Gloucester on the island of New Britain in December 1943. In May 1944, the Marines recuperate on Pavuvu, but a prostrate Leckie is sent to a naval hospital on Banika for psychiatric observation. Meanwhile, Eugene Sledge trains as a mortarman at Camp Elliott in California.
