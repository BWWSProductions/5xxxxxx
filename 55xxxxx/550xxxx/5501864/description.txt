Deadwood Season 3

Determined to consolidate his holdings in this Dakota Territory mining camp, Hearst enters into a bizarre chess match with Swearengen, who joins with Bullock as an unlikely ally. 

Alma Garret (Molly Parker) is carrying Bullock's baby but has wed the genial if awkward Ellsworth (Jim Beaver) to give the child a name. With Hearst coveting her mine claim, Garret's difficult pregnancy fuels uncertainty regarding her ability to keep him at bay.
