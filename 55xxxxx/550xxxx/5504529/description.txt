"Knight Fall"

House and the team take on the case of Sir William, 
a "knight" in a closed-off community of men and 
women living according to the ideals of the High 
Renaissance. As the team searches the medieval 
village for environmental factors contributing to 
Sir William's rapidly deteriorating health, 
Thirteen and Sir William debate the acts that 
define honor and loyalty, especially in regard to 
the "queen" of the community, one of Sir William's 
most frequent visitors. Meanwhile, Wilson starts 
over with an ex.

Enjoy :)
