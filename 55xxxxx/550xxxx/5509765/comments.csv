,Earthplayer,2010-04-23T19:50Z,"Can anyone help me? I don't see my cursor and the menus seem to be fucked up when I start the game. Many people had this problem with the skidrow crack before. Razorrelease works. I have my skidrow release from unleashed and it has same error as if I patch the razor (so no cursor and weird graphics and skirmish wont stop loading).

Please help if you know what to do. XP 32bit here, but on my Win7 32bit Laptop its the same problem, on my second PC everything works fine!"

Anyone know a fix for this?"

At first, just to be sure, uninstall your Antvir for the Installation so it can't block anything. Then first install original Razor release (not one of the repacks, I tried them ALL and none of them worked for me AFTER patching! As this is a tut for guys who had the same problem as me you should make the same). Now normal cracking for the Razor release, so use the Razor folder (3gb one) and after that the Crackfix (download it elsewhere). DONT START YOUR GAME NOW!

Install Steam now from the Razor DVD (not another version). Now use the Skidrow Updates but NONE of the crackfiles! I applied Update 1 to 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and then I copied the EXE file of Skidrow from Update 8 ONLY, none of the other files, no steam_app stuf or anything, ONLY the skidrow exe. Now Start Steam and add the Supreme Commander 2.exe as a NONE STEAM GAME (your account must at least have one game on it, it can be a Demo or Beta, too) Still don't start the game or it can create the same error with menus, cursor and stuf again (at least for people who had this problem before, like me). Download the multiplayer fix for SupCom 2 and copy both files into your SupCom 2 folder and overwrite both. Now start SupCom 2 with STEAM and you will neither have the menu/cursor/loading/graphics bugs nor any other problems. And the best: YOUR USERNAME NOW ISNT SKYDROW OR RAZOR IT'S YOUR STEAMUSERNAME AND AVATARPICTURE NOW! On top of that online works like a charm, too! Just press host or join game and have fun. Not many people playing with newest Update but I always found at least 1 or 2 open matches :)

I hope I was able to help you guys and will see you ingame soon^^."
