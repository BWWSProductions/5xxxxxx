The Swedish June Night didn't get much American play until after its star, Ingrid Bergman, was firmly entrenched in Hollywood. Ingrid plays a small-town girl who becomes romantically involved with fast-and-loose sailor Gunnar Sjoberg. Injured in a shooting accident, the girl can't tell the police-or reveal the extent of her wounds-without revealing her "shameful" relationship with Sjoberg. This soap-operish endeavor was Bergman's final Swedish effort before her move to America. June Night was also distributed as A Night in June, just as if there were actually a difference.
