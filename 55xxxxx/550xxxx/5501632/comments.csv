thanks anyways"
,hamlott,2010-04-18T10:50Z,"I am sorry to say this, but when you say this is infected, it can be misunderstood. People can think that the file is infected, but Raymond does not upload infected files."
,glob0z,2010-04-18T12:02Z,infected and dark island are the same movie
,dannyw1981,2010-04-18T12:18Z,can sum1 please seed?
,wiz4life,2010-04-18T12:43Z,no there not the same movie this is infected 2008 not dark island where is dark island nobody seem's 2 have dark island the trailer look's good it's a shame
[T],agentpiratebay,2010-04-18T13:12Z,"Judging from the screenshots, this is a tv movie called ""Infected 2008"", starring Gil Bellows. I know it because I've seen it last year. But if you spend like one minute on imdb you'll sort this out (different casts, different stories)."
,LordReiden,2010-04-20T07:04Z,"Yes wrong movie. Infected 2008 with Maxim Roy. 
And i've 2 say a shitty movie as well. "
,divanshu,2010-04-21T06:46Z,thanks for the great upload
,Flipped337,2010-04-23T12:24Z,"I've purely registered for one reason, to post this comment. 
This is 'infected' a straight to tv film. 
I've watched alot of crappy films in the past an this is the single worst piece of cinematography ever!!! Dont get me wrong its of no fault of the uploader,its a f*ckin great torrent with audio an video both 10/10 (thanks raymondhome luv ur work man) Just pls dont waste ur time watching this excuse for Sci-fi its not what it says on the box :) "
,Flipped337,2010-04-23T12:26Z,In fact DO watch it cos u'll never believe how bad it is. Not even pot can make it enjoyable. I'd know i do smoke alot.
,73sad73,2010-05-16T22:21Z,"Jesus christ people skip the bullshit about the opinions about the move. I don't give a rats ass what you liked or didn't like. This isn't IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. People here just want to know if the movie is fake or not and what quality it is.

Audio and Video was 9/9

And this is the first copy I found with the audio in sync properly.

Thank you for sharing it."
,73sad73,2010-05-16T22:26Z,"Damn it, I forgot to mention this was not the Dark Island movie I was expecting to find but Infected as said above.
