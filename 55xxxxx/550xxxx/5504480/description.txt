Maria Korp, a loving suburban wife and mother of two, went
missing in early 2005. As she lay dying in the boot of her
car, a twisted tale emerged of suburban lies, a philandering
husband and the ultimate price paid by all those involved.
Wicked Love is the gripping and tragic account of one of
Australia\'s most complex criminal cases - a suburban thriller
of passion, love and betrayal.
