I am re-seeding this title since many of you had problems acquiring it before.  

At age 70 Sinatra gives a great performance at the Budokan in Japan.  Ripped directly from the Japanese laserdisc this ISO file results in a very nice quality DVD in the original 4:3 aspect ratio and with gorgeous digital stereo sound.  A basic menu is included for selecting individual songs.  DVD releases of this program are truncated.  Enjoy!
