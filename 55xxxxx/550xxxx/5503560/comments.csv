,jt19006,2010-04-20T04:38Z,I did what you suggested.  I am not sure that's working either.  I get lots of peers but it doesn't appear I am adding anything to the availability.  How does it download something that's already on my hard drive and no one elses?
,jt19006,2010-04-20T04:55Z,I think I've got it now.  Thanks for the education.
