Pretty Maids is a NWOBHM (New Wave Of British Heavy Metal) inspired heavy metal band formed in Horsens, 
Denmark, by Ronnie Atkins and Ken Hammer in 1981.
Over the years Pretty Maids have sold hundreds of thousands of records, but have never broken through in a major way. 
They have supported such well known acts as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Saxon, Nazareth and were also featured at the 1987 German version of Monsters of Rock where Metallica headlined along with Deep Purple.
The new 2006 album â€œWake Up to the Real Worldâ€ shows the band back in former glory. 
Great hard rock/melodic rock with a metal touch to it. The album includes a cover of Deep Purpleâ€™s classic gem â€œPerfect Strangersâ€. 
Pretty Maids is currently signed to Frontiers Records.
