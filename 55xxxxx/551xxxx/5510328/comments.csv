,shatru,2010-04-23T21:17Z,"what is the difference between ""select edition"" and "" profetional plus""? are the select edition contains all editions of office suit?"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-04-23T22:45Z,"@ shatru

Yes."
,hannibal0,2010-04-23T23:03Z,will this need to be activated every 6 months?
,nafroman,2010-04-24T13:40Z,"i don't understand one thing ... i download from a different  torrent the file  with the same name  ""14.0.4763.1000_Select_volume_ship_x86_en-us_dvd.iso""
which his SHA-1 code is the same as the file in this torrent..but when i go into the help inside the programs they say 14.0.4760.1000 and not 14.0.4763.1000 .
can someone explain  why is that ?"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-04-24T14:41Z,@nafroman what torrent are you talking about?
,nafroman,2010-04-24T15:11Z,"@stun - this one

[V],MAFIAA.,2010-04-24T17:30Z,@nafroman thats for x86 only this is for both plus activator included.
,nafroman,2010-04-24T18:31Z,"@stun i understand that but i was referring the x86 iso file inside. both torrents x86 image file SHA-1  is the same so this is indeed  the same file . now the label says that the  build number is    ""14.0.4763.1000"" but if you enter into word/excel/etc.  the build number of the program is ""14.0.4760.1000"" .. since both file SHA-1 is the same i was wondering how come?

,zzerop,2010-04-25T01:26Z,"All these so-called ""activators"" are fake. A real activator would permanently activate Office 2010. Giving users 180 days is not activation. In conclusion:

1 point for Microsoft
0 point for Pirate Bay users "
,raw_power,2010-04-26T17:50Z,"Hi Stun/Anyone else,

Installed x64 office on 2 PC's at home, mini-KMS activator worked for 1 and not the other. It can't seem to activate office pro plus on the other pc. Both have identical Win7 x64 installs and identical antivirus (which i tried switching off but didn't help). Rearming and reinstalling office did not help either. Thoughts?"
,Megz666,2010-06-11T11:10Z,Very nice offering from you. :)  I've got it working...my only question is where I can get Business Contact Manager for it...I can't find it in any of the files or isos...am I just overlooking it?
,pxpx,2010-06-15T03:39Z,"Thank you Stun & seeders! I downloaded just the x64 files + Activator so it went fast & installed nicely on Win 7 Ultimate legit. Activator reports valid for 180 days as expected.

Can this be updated safely?"
,MoonDookie,2010-06-17T01:58Z,de activates after 10 days...
