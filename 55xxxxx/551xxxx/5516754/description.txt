Madrid; the heart of Spain. Madrid; scene of one of the most stupendous Mulesical happenings. Set one began with a raucous Hammer & Nails and a mucho jazzy Thelonius Beck. Two songs, each a gem in their own right were paired together for the first time in a musical segue that could only be described as magical. Larger Than Life jumped into Hendrix's If 6 Was 9 and towards the end, while Warren, Andy and Danny jammed on, Matt surreptitiously began the intro to go back into Larger Than Life. Magical. Another melding of tunes, Lay Your Burden Down-> Smokestack Lightning-> Lay Your Burden Down was deemed to be the first set closer.

Set two came out of the gate with a soaring Soulshine followed by a powerful Birth Of The Mule. Once again the intertwining of songs paid big dividends when Mother Earth found herself sandwiched in between Lola Leave Your Light On on the front and Streamline Woman on the flip. Mule was given the title of set closer and did the job justice but the night's encore, Endless Parade, was a brilliant display of blistering guitar prowess where Warren melts the face of all who attended and was a beautiful way to close out the show.
