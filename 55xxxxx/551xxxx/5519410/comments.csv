,Pa3PyX,2011-07-02T21:11Z,"Looks like an unsuccessful attempt to rip a multi-lingual release into a container format (AVI) that doesn't support multiple video streams... as the readme mentions, the first 7 minutes of video (title/opening crawl) are messed up, and messed up at the codec level, it seems (demuxing and remuxing doesn't help)."
