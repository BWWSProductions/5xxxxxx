,Blue_Flames,2010-04-25T00:57Z,"What's the difference (x264/h264)?

Official bluray spec vs .mkv spec? I've got no idea TBH ..."
,rippervanwinkle,2010-04-25T05:36Z,"trolkan is just being clueless, don't worry about it. h264 is a standard for video compression while x264 is one of several encoders which encodes video streams into the h264 format. If you encode using x264 then the result is h264 video.

mkv (matroska) is a container. Like the mp4 container it can contain audio or video or still images or text.  If you prefer an mp4 file you can use free software tools to extract the content from a mkv container and put it in an mp4 container (and you can convert the ac3 audio to aac if you like). "

,scrothy,2010-07-04T11:03Z,"what is the source for this rip? since I the official blu-ray is a long way way as I hear, they are still restoring it."
,matt7333,2010-07-04T15:17Z,I believe the source for this rip was HDTV. 
,pimmyjalmer,2010-09-25T00:23Z,"It says there's 24seed/19leech, but it shows up with 0/0 in uTorrent and I can't download. What's the go?

I've been waiting for this on BluRay for ages, I really want to see this."
,harvey_weinstein,2011-01-29T22:40Z,There's a part around the 1hr 15m mark that requires subtitles. Not much is said but enough that it helps to have them. These are the english subs: http://subscene.com/english/barry-lyndon/subtitle-388158.aspx
