I think WB should have released this on blu-ray by now.  I think it is the best Kubrick did visually so it should have been released ages ago.  People should see this with the best available image quality.

The file is a very good HDTV rip in PAL 25fps 1280 x 720 (192kps 5.1 surround).  There are other HD versions of this film available with a larger mkv file size but I have watched this one a couple of times and can say that the quality is superb without any degredation I can see.

I have also included samples for people to check before downloading.  Thanks to copasetic for putting the work into making this available on the web.
