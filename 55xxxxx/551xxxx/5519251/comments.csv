What a stupid statement.  Well where is the centre of the universe?  Because we are the subject, then we are the centre of the universe.  Also Red-Shifts do not point to an one direction. They are variable all over the place."

Since the universe is not just threedimensional it is quite possible there isnt a ""center"" like we are used to the concept (prepositions being by definition limited to 3 dimensions). ""Because we are the subject, then we are the centre of the universe."" This is incorrect, by definition, since that for us to know where the center of any given space is located, we would have to accurately and definitely (this is the operative word) measure the exact dimensions of that space in all directions in order to determine its shape and size, then we would be able to mathematically conclude where inside this space would lie the center. But since we are inside of the space we are measuring, i.e without an external reference (which we're pretty much completely dependant on and used to having for all cognitive abilities regarding spatial navigation and/or definitions in up to 3d) we can only really measure relatively or indirectly. Since all our measurements of the universe begin here, one can only state for certain that we are at x0y0z0(n)0. Oh, and by the way, without an external referencepoint (to measure from) or accurate mathematics to describe the internal relationships of a relevant spatial (and other) dimensions, aswell as tools for measuring them in all directions, we can never simultaneously know our relative position while knowing where the center is, and vice versa. Kind of like trying to define your position in, aswell as the center position inside of a 3-dimensional space using only two dimensions at a time. Even if you measure in every available direction multiple times and get the same distance ratios every time in every direction (which is ironically what we see when measuring the universe, but in 3d), concluding triumphantly that you are inside of a circle and thereby being able to calculate the center by measuring (from your 2d perspective), trying to define your position inside this (sphere) then becomes impossible, without external reference. This became substantially more elaborative than I had planned, so I think I'll stop now. Scientia est potentia. *Out*"
