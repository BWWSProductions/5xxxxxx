For those who hear no voices in Hgame "The Sagara Family" 
ADPCM to PCM voice file convert.
Japanese voices. ZyX and G-Collections.

How to install:

1. Unpack with 7-zip/WinRAR to your game folder
and rename or replace VOICE file (~435 Mb) with this one (~1.65 Gb).
2. Run game.
3. Ignore message (press "Yes" if you have this one):

There will be no voice or sound effects because the system does not support ADPCM files. Do you wish to continue? (CODE =0:0)

VOICEs Must Be Heard!




WARNING! If there is no sounds in the game menu (buttons click etc.) then this Voice Pack does NOT help you. Your system is truly hard to play PCM:(
I try(ed) different versions of msadp32.acm 4.x 5.x 7.x on Win XP - it doesn't work on my system. That's why the Voice Pack is here.
