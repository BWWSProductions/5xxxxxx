This film is a collectiong of actual footage, documents, and testimony from hundreds, perhaps even thousands of state officials and protestors from all over the nation. There?s no way he could afford to give this information away for free, if he?d spent all this money paying these people to say and show this very strong evidence.

They aired a story on my local news channel about the National Guard coming into Chicago to work with police.  Skeptics of police state 4 thought it would never happen, yet just a week later, we now see them trying to do it even more.  I immediately logged on to the news web site to look up the story, only to discover that it was not on the site.

This was there ?proclaimed news cast.? http://www.centralillinoisnewscenter.com/news/local/index.rss
When I watched it myself, the ?Vigil to be held for fire victims,? story, was their second story, with the Chicago story shown first.  You can see how they are deliberately trying to cover this up.  They showed their tsecond story as the first story, as if the actual top story was removed.  I looked into it more and found that once again, only a select amount of newscasters are covering this, and it looks like some of them are removing and/or denying that this is actually happening.

Here are the comments from the site above.  

Bababooey: If there is a crime problem in Chicago, they should have more police. The Guard is a big hammer. A soldier can shoot to kill, call in mortar strikes and have a .50 caliber on a M113 to back him up. Whats a soldier going to do in an American city? He can't lay down heavy fire on a guy that just robbed the Kwikee Mart on the corner. What if a soldier is outnumbered by some gang members? Is he going to ""spray and pray"" potentially hitting innocents? The locals wouldn't like that and the news media would have a field day. I'm sure if gang members get pissed, they can bring out some heavy guns that would make an M16 carrying riflemen blush. 

Skyeye: The Posse Comitatus Act may put a crimp in these plans. 
Then this fool comes out and says this:

Linedoggie: Not really, Guard can be put into the Cities on the Governors orders, They aren't Federal Troops. I've spent quite a few nights walking a Platform in the NYC subways with my Squad armed with M16A4's or M4's along with our Cop. This was TD#4 based out of Canal Street. Deputized as State Law Enforcement is one option. Assist the Police if they say they need assistance(ridiculous when the cop is grappling to wait for him to say ""A little Help"" Was one that we operated under in 2003. Guards been used in this role Many times over the last 100 years or more. Hell the Puerto Rico Guard has been used in Housing Projects as Law Enforcement Augmentees for years 

This is the only source that I could find with an actual story and footage over the ordeal

Here?s another headline from a news article that talks about how the slaves of the army are punished and/or abused if they have problems or ask for simple help requests, driving many to the point of suicide.

2 Lawmakers: National Guard Can Help Fight Crime
Legislators Say Chicago Would Welcome The Aid, But City's Top Cop Does Not Embrace The Idea
CHICAGO (CBS) ?

 Those living in violence plagued neighborhoods say their streets have turned into a war zone. Now two Chicago lawmakers say it's time to treat those areas as if a battle was really being waged there, especially when it comes to giving the police the help they need. As CBS 2's Vince Gerasole reports they say that help is The National Guard. 

The shattered windows, and violent details seemed all too plausible in Chicago this week. Twenty-month-old Cynia Cole was shot to death in the back seat of a car, the victim of a bullet intended for her father. 

""This is a child, how can you live with yourself after you've done this,"" asked her grandmother Cynthia Lyons, a day after the killing. 

Cynia is among the 113 Chicagoans killed by violence so far this ye"
