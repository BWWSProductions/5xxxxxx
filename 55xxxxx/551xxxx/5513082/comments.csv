R u going to do da whole season????"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-24T22:23Z,Oh no... I cannot. It always ended as pure trashing of bandwidth - as meat for leechers and night-mare for two suckers (myself included) as seeders.
,bhailog,2010-04-24T23:19Z,then can u let me know where can i get it plzzzzzzzzzz
,nicermog,2010-04-24T23:25Z,"been meaning to check this one out. thanks for reminding me regardless of the fact that i'm not downloading it.

i know that there are plenty of leechers but most of your torrents seem to be getting a decent number of seeds nowadays (probably thanks to your constant nagging XD)."
,Kencoldman,2010-04-25T06:53Z,Just watched it really liked it. Please upload the entire series I will seed ratio of 1:1 like I do all of your stuff sorry about the knobs that donÂ´t but donÂ´t make us pay.

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-25T08:00Z,"@bhailog: As far as I can tell - no torrent of Journeyman is alive.
I use 720p versions and whole season (13x1.09GB) is probably too big for you.
After ten seconds of search on ""Google"" the term ""Journeyman DVDrip"" on first page I get page of ddlhere.com with working links for direct download. So, get jdownloader and run there (or someplace else if Google shows better links)."
,nicermog,2010-04-25T14:13Z,I could find quite a lot of results on btjunkie.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-25T14:48Z,"... and, it means what?"
,tyrone69,2010-04-25T16:21Z,"oh, man. i miss this show. i would kill someone to have this go back on air and have a second season."
