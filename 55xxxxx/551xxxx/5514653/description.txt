The aim is to have a functional theme that runs quickly on the device.  This is one of the smallest themes I have created, at 59kb it is very small but still has the following features.

-Clear Date and Time setting left aligned
-Reduced application banner to maximize the visible application area
-Increased incoming call info font size for greater visibility
Screen transitions

This theme has been produced with BlackBerry Theme Studio 5.0. Enjoy.
