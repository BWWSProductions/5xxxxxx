To Break A Tyrant's Chains- Neo-Guerrilla Techniques for Combat

This book has been created to help put tyrants and would-be-tyrants on notice that a rag-tag band of neo-guerrilla fighters can bring the strongest of armies or police states to their knees. With this in mind, Duncan Long reveals the secrets of how to secure and create weapons and the tactics to use them when fighting almost anything imaginable from attack helicopters to tanks.
You'll learn how to avoid being injured by deadly chemical
agents even if you don't have a gas mask or other protective equipment. Long gives you straight, no holds barred assessment of the shortcomings of guerrilla warfare conflicts, updates guerrilla strategies to fit today's level of technology
, and takes a look at the historical mistakes of many rebel groups who tried to adopt conventional strategies to their movement often with the loss of many men and without winning their war."
