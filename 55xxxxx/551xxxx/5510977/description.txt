************************************************************


DVD AUTOPLAY FEATURE
===================
Inserting the game DVD into your DVD drive and then immediately 
running the game either from the Windows Start menu or by 
double-clicking the game\'s Desktop icon may cause a conflict with the 
DVD\'s AutoPlay feature. The easiest way to avoid this potential 
conflict is to always wait a few moments after inserting the DVD to 
allow the AutoPlay feature to run the game.


EJECTING THE GAME DVD
====================
Never eject the game DVD when the game is running.  Failure to do so
can result in serious problems, including being unable to continue the
game.


FAST USER SWITCHING
===================
You will not be able to run two versions of the game using two different 
windows accounts via the fast user switching (windows key + L).


DEVICE DRIVERS
==============

It is highly recommended that the latest versions of all device 
drivers (i.e. video and sound card drivers) be obtained and installed.
Please consult your card manufacturer for their newest drivers. Also, 
keep in mind that video chip manufacturers sometimes provide drivers 
in addition to the card manufacturer.  

If you are experiencing issues with an unstable PC environment please 
make sure your Motherboard drivers (AGP, miniport) are up to date. For 
further information please contact your Motherboard manufacturer.


VIDEO & GRAPHICS PROBLEMS
=========================
If you are experiencing performance problems on the default graphics 
settings, try lowering some of the settings or the game resolution.

This game requires DirectX 9.0c
It is available for download by going to:

		www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/

Graphic Cards:  Graphical settings and features available in-game are 
dependant on Graphics Card capabilities. Settings not supported by your 
Graphics Card hardware are disabled in the Options Menu to prevent 
adverse effects on the game and your computer.

NVIDIA Cards:  All supported NVIDIA cards were tested using ForceWare 
driver version 91.47 (Win2k/XP). It is highly 
recommended this driver or a more recent version be used when running 
Need for Speed Carbon.

Known Issues:  

ATI Cards:  All supported ATI cards were tested using Catalyst driver 
version 6.8 (Win2k/XP). It is highly recommended 
this driver or a more recent version be used when running 
Need for Speed Carbon.




BACKGROUND PROGRAMS
===================
Avoid running other programs in the background.

Programs starting up automatically can cause Need for Speed
Carbon to lose control of the screen and keyboard, possibly 
causing an unstable PC environment.  We strongly recommend that you 
shut down or suspend applications that start up automatically or 
programs that automatically run other applications at specified times 
before running Need for Speed Carbon.  These include, but are not 
limited to:
	- Windows System Agent
  	- Windows Task Scheduler
	- Windows \"Disk Cleanup\" utilities

Similarly, message boxes and dialog boxes from other programs or from 
Windows itself can also cause Need for Speed Carbon to lose 
control of the screen and keyboard, possibly causing an unstable PC 
environment. We strongly recommend that you shut down all other 
applications before running Need for Speed Carbon.  These 
include, but are not limited to:
  	- Email programs
	- Calendar, appointment, or contact applications
	- Network or Internet chat programs

Also, connections to/from non-dedicated servers can be disrupted when 
background programs or screen-savers launch.  We recommend that you shut
down other applications and run Need for Speed
Carbon by itself whenever possible.


POWER MANAGEMENT SUSPEND/SLEEP MODES
============================================
Systems (i.e. laptops or other portables) that automatically power 
down into \"sleep\" or \"suspended\" modes can cause Need for Speed 
Carbon to lose control of the screen and keyboard, possibly 
causing an unstable PC environment. We strongly recommend that you 
disable these features before running Need for Speed Carbon.


WINDOWS VIRTUAL MEMORY ISSUES WITH 512 MB RAM 
==================================================
If you experience any Virtual Memory issues while running the game, try increasing 
the page file size on your hard drive.  Please consult the Microsoft Windows help 
pages to determine how to tweak your virtual memory settings.

CHOPPY PLAYBACK DURING VIDEO SEQUENCES 
==================================================
If you experience choppy playback during video sequences, try increasing 
the page file size on your hard drive.  Please consult the Microsoft Windows help 
pages to determine how to tweak your virtual memory settings.

SAFE MODE
=========================
The safe mode option can be found under the game directory in the Start Menu.  If this
option does not appear, go to www.microsoft.com/downloads and install the .NET Framework.
Then re-install the game.

Have fun & ENJOY :-)
