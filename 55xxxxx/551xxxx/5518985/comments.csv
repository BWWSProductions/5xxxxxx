,GMD463,2010-04-27T20:33Z,Thats a video issue....try updating your drivers or getting a better video card

Anyone know what to do?"
,Black Griffon,2010-04-27T20:56Z,For some reason the 1911.dll file wont move from c: to the game folder on another partition. When I try to open it I get an access denied thing. Anyone know what to do? Could any of you guys upload just the 1911 file as a torrent so I can download it directly to the correct disk?
,mtvnot,2010-04-27T21:14Z,"@palencis ,hey i updated my video drivers to the latest and it works!"

[T],Knaster,2010-04-27T22:20Z,I have no problem and i have win7 64 bit. Im guessing those of you that has problem has an ATI card.
,Niedemeyer,2010-04-27T22:34Z,"Black Griffon that happens to me too. The 1911.dll in the Crack folder has a virus of the type: win32/Heur which is a dangerous self-mutating polymorphic trojan virus. That's mainly why your computer refuses to interact with it.

Razor 1911, please do not include a virus next time."
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-27T22:45Z,"@Niedemeyer 

false-positive, learn how it works before blaming on razor1911"
,Black Griffon,2010-04-27T23:03Z,"Fuck, I thought that was just AVG being a bitch. Screw this for now. :-("
,Niedemeyer,2010-04-27T23:04Z,"A ""false-positive""? ;) 

AVG 9.0 picks it up as a identifiable threat. 

I can't even move the file, nor provide the sufficient admin rights to move it. That doesn't add up, and it doesn't make sense to flag a file as a dangerous virus.

Please, do explain.


"
,Tilatus,2010-04-27T23:58Z,"@Niedemeyer: AVG has been giving a lot of false positives these days. I think it does the same to Assassin's Creed 2 crack and whole bunch of others. It's AVG that is making you unable to move the file. Norton 2010 does not find virus from it and I'm sure that 90% of scanners don't find it. 

Your problem here is that AVG is a crap scanner."
,Tilatus,2010-04-28T00:04Z,"And of course the fact that no suspicious things are happening on my computer and I've been using this crack and the AC2 one. Where's this ""self-mutating polymorphic trojan virus""? Stop scaring people with ghost stories and fuck off if you don't trust this file. "
,Saduff,2010-04-28T00:16Z,AVG is crap. It only detects it because of VM Protect code virtualization probably.

Also disable the A\V because of falsa positives as the others have pointed out.
Remember google is your friend I am not."

,anssisi,2010-04-28T08:25Z,"I couldn´t move the 1911 file either, but after I changed my crappy AVG to another anti-virus program, everything started to work just fine. Thanks to RAZOR!!!!!!"
,steve30x,2010-04-28T09:13Z,"AVG used to be my antivirus of choice but after they bought an anti spyware company and implemented that software into their antivirus it went downhill rapidly from there. I now use Avast free version that is a thousand times better than AVG.

Avg is a bitch for giving False positives and it also blocks some files from being accessed if it thinks its a threat. I would recomend changing AntiVirus software. "
,Black Griffon,2010-04-28T15:09Z,"Well I disabled AVG, and now I get this when I try to start the game:

So I downloaded the Demo and had the same problem, which meant there was nothing wrong with the crack.

,Haloperidol,2010-05-01T16:44Z,"""/Heur"" is short for heuristic. Its NOT an identifiable threat, on the contrary - it means AVG found something strange with its heuristic engine (used for identifying unknown potential threats, like uncommon hooks which are more common in malwares). This is not a false positive either, its exactly what is says: a heuristic hit, something which is unknown to avg, but has the properties of something fishy. Trainers and cracks often have these ""uncommon properties"", hence detected as /heur or Gen.heur etc.

On the crashing issue: the forums at ubisoft were full of ATI driver issues, some ppl were able to play with the new drivers, others with all the graph settings downgraded.

I have a third problem with the title: the game freezes every 10 minutes - apparently its not a crack rather a game issue with autosaving, which has been addressed in patch 1.03. The crack of course wont work after the patch... So is there anyone who got this game working for more than 10 minutes? If yes, how did you do it? :D"

4. Then go to Computer Settings.

6. Add the folder where The settlers is installed in both ""Seek Exceptions"" and ""Auto-protect exceptions"".

And all you who think there's virus and problems with a Razor-release :
Learn what false positives are and why they are happening.
You who don't get virus-messages and still can use it :
get a friggin' brain, this isn't exactly rocket science, it's made by pro's for idiots so they won't get nagged."

,la_cross37,2011-04-29T22:29Z,"This a fully working release, if it doesn't work for you, you are doing something wrong. This is very standard and easy to install, nothing weird, hard or unusual. If you think there's a virus in this release you are wrong, learn what false positives are, and if your AV gives you any problems just disable it while you are handling the crack, then delete any other copy off it and enable your AV again, it's that simple. Tested and confirmed working on windows 7 32/64 bit. I just wish razor or someone would release a new crack that works on a later version of the game ....."

,Keshicus,2011-06-22T14:44Z,"its only 400mb because this is a PATCH, read people.

Also big cheers for Razor1911. Reading your news feed was enjoyable."
,PiRtAeS,2011-07-08T04:24Z,How can you burn the image with 5.7G into a DVD which has only 4.7G memory?

I couldn´t move the 1911 file either, but after I changed my crappy AVG to another anti-virus program, everything started to work just fine. Thanks to RAZOR!!!!!!

False information. 

I have No antivirus program and the 1911.dll was not allowed to moved from its palce. "
,ashurstb123,2011-08-03T16:34Z,"The intro keeps repeating itself and the game won't load...and everytime i press esc after a minute of waiting on the intro its saying the settlers 7 has stopped working.

Plz need help!!!"
,batong,2011-09-12T21:40Z,"I can't get this to work on my XP machine. On my Windows 7, Avast keeps deleting the 1911.dll file. At the same time as it warned, it also warned about crss.exe, and all of a sudden I noticed that the proxies on all my browsers had been set from ""none"" to a weird port on 127.0.0.1... It could be coincidence, but it's the only cracked game I've installed in a long time, so it's a very strange coincidence that I get lots of weird virus stuff appearing right after installing this one...

I like the game, so I'm going to uninstall the cracked version and buy the real thing instead. It's only 9â‚¬ anyway. Virus-free... :-)"
