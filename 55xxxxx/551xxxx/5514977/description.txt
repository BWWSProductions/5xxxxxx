This has the yellow ENGLISH hard coded subs for all Na'vi speak, they cannot be removed.  If you want the version with English Soft Subs then get the (iPod) version.  This is good if you speak english and have a PSP or Zune (or an iPod).

The subs are similar to what were in Inglorious Bastards which were yellow permanent subs in the R1 release.  If you don't like them like that then get the (iPod) version (soft subs).
