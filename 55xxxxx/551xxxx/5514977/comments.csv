If ya actually followed HR you would know that he aint uploading anything till he gets a job!"
,HolyRooster,2010-04-26T04:51Z,"why not make the subs hard coded in the 720p version, im guessing we are all english speakers and if theirs a frenchie who needs subs why doesnt he just donwload a french avatar where he can hear it too. cause im guessing soft coded means you need to turn them on which you cant do with a xbox 360, or ps3, so hardcoded is the universal must, cause who really owns an apple tv so we can watch it on our hi-def televisions i use my xbox360 and i bought the dvd and all but id enjoy seeing it in 720.  thanks even though i wrote alot."
[V],poppedtart,2010-04-26T05:07Z,I don't have a tool to make video like that.  Eventually an R1 will be released that has subs in the video stream like it was in the theatre.
