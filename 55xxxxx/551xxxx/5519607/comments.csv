2) replace your LimeWire.jar with the one from the crack folder (cure), default folder is:
C:Program FilesLimeWirelib
I am not very smart with computers lol.
Thanks"

once you finish installing lime wire, download this crack then open the folder ( cure )
you'll find a file inside, copy it and go to Lime Wire folder in C drive, u will find some folders and files, there is a folder with name of Lib, double click it then right-click paste

run the software normally, if you got the registration key message, ignore it, because once you done the steps above u will have a Pro Lime wire ( turbo-charged connection )"
