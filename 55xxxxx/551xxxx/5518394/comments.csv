But this film......wow, it looks like it was written by someone who went to a street race event, as in one, and talked to one person who used to race.  Having said this it could almost be worth a look just for the laugh at how wrong they got it.  FYI not to disappoint, but the cars on the cover have nothing to do with the movie.  Go watch fast and the furious instead for a movie that was actually researched."
