Hoarders is an A&E documentary TV series depicting the real-life struggles and treatment of people who suffer from compulsive hoarding. Each 60-minute episode profiles one or two interventions where a psychological or psychiatric clinician specializing in hoarding behavior and a crew of professional cleaners assists a hoarder with the cleanup of his or her home over a period of two or three days, often enlisting the help of the hoarder's family and friends. In most instances, the intervention is prompted by a crisis, such as the threat of eviction or the removal of minor children from the home. The first episode aired August 17, 2009 at 10PM ET.
Hoarders debuted as the most-watched series premiere in A&E network history among adults aged 18â€“49 and tied for the most ever in the adults aged 25â€“54 demographic. The premiere was watched by 2.5 million viewers (1.8 million adults aged 18â€“49).
