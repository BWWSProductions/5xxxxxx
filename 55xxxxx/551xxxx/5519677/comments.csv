V-6

Accidentally downloaded the 2007 version before this one and I must say that this ""remake"" sucks. The only difference between this version and the other is this one has alot of cussing and very little funny. I am amazed that they didnt even change anything between the 2 versions. 

Download the 2007 version and you will enjoy the story alot more IMO.

Thx for sharing."
,drcat125,2010-05-06T00:57Z,if the story is the same and this one has a all star cast in it. why would I want to see old one

,moviefann,2010-06-10T09:24Z,"Comments are for A V quality....nobody cares about your opinions on the film and i for one am sick of reading thru a bunch of pissers and moaners just to see if a torrent is any good. 
    -cam is a bit dark but watchable"

FUCK OFF you SPAMMING BEYATCH!!!

Thanks for the upload by the way.."
,zdude123,2010-07-01T12:54Z,Dont bother with this one. This is a stupid remake of the classic 2007 film by Frank Oz. Watch the original British verison. ITs wat funnier than this turd.
