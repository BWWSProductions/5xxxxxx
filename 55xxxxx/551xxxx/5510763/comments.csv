,fmirza,2010-08-14T15:50Z,cant get the english subs.. downloaded the file from the link above.. but the subs dont show up.. can anyone please.. 
,DryKid,2010-08-14T20:00Z,fmirza - Use VLC Media Player. All you have to do it is use the options bar to go to VIDEO > SUBTITLES TRACKS > OPEN FILE and then find the file on your hardrive (I always put the subtitles in movie folder). Hope that helps.
,loonatick,2010-08-25T19:25Z,Subtitles are not included in this torrent.  The time stamp files are there but no actual subs.  Found them at:  http://subscene.com/ (free registration required.)  Make sure you get the vomit 2 file version.
,SixT-4,2010-08-27T18:20Z,"Those subs are terrible. I thought they were really off during the movie - it was hard to follow and the stuff they were saying just didn't make that much sense... very vague. I got the DVD today and compared just 20 seconds of subs and it's awful. It's better than no subs, but you'll miss a lot of details."
,SixT-4,2010-08-27T18:21Z,"I should clarify - DVD subs were perfect, the subs in those links were awful compared to them."
,trulex1,2010-12-23T22:31Z,please seeds thank you
,beestripe,2011-01-21T20:51Z,I am using the english subtitles from http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3669105/un-prophete-en and they are perfectly fine
,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2012-03-21T00:06Z,"The subs in this download do not open in vlc, there is an error, and the links posted here are not suitable"
