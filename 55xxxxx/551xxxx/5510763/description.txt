           Nineteen year-old Franco-Arab Malik El Djebena is just         
           starting his six year prison sentence in Brcourt.             
           Although he has spent the better part of his life in           
           juvenile detention, this stint is his first in an adult        
           prison. Beyond the division of Corsicans and Muslims in        
           the prison (the Corsicans who with their guard                 
           connections rule what happens in the prison), he has no        
           known friends or enemies inside. He is just hoping to          
           serve his time in peace and without incident, despite          
           having no prospects once he's out of jail since he's           
           illiterate and has no support outside of the prison. Due       
           to logistics, the head of Corsican inmates, a sadistic         
           mafioso named Csar Luciani, co-opts Malik as part of the      
           Corsicans' activities, not only regarding what happens         
           inside the prison, but also continued criminal activities      
           outside. The innocent Malik has no idea what to do but         
           cooperate. This move does not sit well with the other          
           Corsicans, who only see Malik as a dirty Arab, and the         
           Muslims who now mistrust him. But as time goes on, Malik       
           works to save himself while in prison, while setting up        
           his life post prison on his own terms. Both his demon and      
           his salvation in prison is the specter of one of the           
           first people he really got to know during his                  
           incarceration.
