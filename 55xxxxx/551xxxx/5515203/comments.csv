,LC17,2010-07-14T03:24Z,"Unfortunately, the quality isn\'t good at all - with 96KB/s at 22khz in mono(!) that is no surprise.nOne bad thing is also, that every mp3 is around 4 minutes long, sometimes ending midwordish. There is no seperation in chapters, making the hearing experience extremely bad when you just want to listen to one chapter or just find a place where you can restart the next time without having to search for the correct timecode."
