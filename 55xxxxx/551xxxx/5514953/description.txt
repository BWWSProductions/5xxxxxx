A single source for accurate scientific information on herbal remedies!

This comprehensive handbook (comprised of two volumes of 700+ pages each) provides a snapshot of 160 herbal products that have been tested in clinical trials. Details of the products and the clinical trials they underwent are here in an easy-to-read, at-a-glance format.

Each botanical profile in The Handbook of Clinically Tested Herbal Remedies contains a summary section (table, text and references), followed by product information and clinical trials for that particular product. An evaluation of the strength of the evidence from the trials, along with the context for therapeutics is included to give you a complete picture of each remedy and its usefulness or lack thereof. If there is more than one product based on a particular botanical then the trials are grouped according to the product.

This valuable book also makes purchasing easy with manufacturer contact information. With over 30 individual botanicals and 10 multi-ingredient formulas, 160 products and 360 clinical studies, The Handbook of Clinically Tested Herbal Remedies is the book you need to make an informed selection of herbal products. Not only does it list proprietary herbal products that have been tested in controlled clinical studies and provide a rating of the quality of those trials, but, it also describes the fundamentals of herbal medicine, including regulation, characterization, standardization, bioavailability, efficacy, safety, pharmacopoeial monographs as well as incentives, or lack of incentive, for US and European manufacturers to conduct clinical studies.
