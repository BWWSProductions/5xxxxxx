Played in Space: The Best of Something Corporate is a compilation album by Something Corporate set to be released April 27, 2010. It will be made up of two discs: one, a greatest hits album, and the other with previously unreleased tracks and newly mixed songs. An exclusive iTunes edition will contain the bonus track "Letters to Noelle". The title "Played in Space" is a reference to the fact that NASA control on Earth played the song "The Astronaut" as a morning "wake-up call" to space shuttle astronauts a few years ago.
