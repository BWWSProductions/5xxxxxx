btw, didnt lost air tonight? abc shedule says it did.. yet no one seems to have it, weird"
,masterersin,2010-04-28T05:43Z,"@remedyVenom, unfortunately there is no Lost this week :( I was searching everywhere too, then I checked the eztv website and it said ""break"".

Next episode is out on the 3rd May."

,remedyVenom,2010-04-28T05:47Z,"@masterersin
thanks a lot for the info, though i wonder why abc says it airs when it actually doesn`t. Oh well, one more week to wait, no biggie, reminds one of the first two seasons when there were 3 week breaks every now and then.. glad they got THAT sorted :)"
