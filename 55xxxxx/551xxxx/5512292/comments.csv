,ShoopDaWhoop1111,2010-04-24T21:04Z,"First i tried it in sandbox (for all who want to be on the safe side) 
No Virus found.
Then i copied the .dll from the folder skidrow to ubisoft game launcher, and replaced the other .dll 
And i could go through animous and saw how i got born :D

So thank you very much, nice upload."

,fishcp2,2010-04-25T23:35Z,"I was using and offline server before, this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5492859/Assassin_s_Creed_2_Launcher_-_Play_AC2_The_Easy_Way_V1.15

Now I changed to this crack, but the previous saved games are not shown anymore. Does anyone know how to fix this??"
,JonRoark,2010-04-26T03:35Z,"Same here, too.  Game loads fine, but no previous saved sessions appear anymore.  Anyone know how to retrieve old saved games when going from the AC2 launcher to this Skidrow crack?  Hope I didn't just make myself restart the whole game again.

This guy says it worked for him, but a few people's experiences here seem to say otherwise."
,azothegreat,2010-04-26T12:29Z,"This Crack is for those who are confuse to use the dormine crack,this is the easiest crack for playing the game,if you are using the other crack and the game is running gud so no need to downloaded this crack,only those who are having difficulty in playing in other cracks. "
,vladimiroulianov,2010-04-26T22:16Z,"i just instaled it ,

,luithejoker,2010-04-27T16:19Z,"doesn't work here, updated, copied the crack into ubisoft game launcher folder, ran the game but no window pops up, it only runs in the background."
,luithejoker,2010-04-27T16:38Z,who the fuck removed my comment?

,mwu,2010-04-28T14:49Z,is this crack working on 64x OS computer ?
,ky9,2010-04-29T07:38Z,"Thanks a bunch, this is without doubt the best and most elegant crack out there. Why bother with all the emulator shit when you can just use this crack?"
,azothegreat,2010-04-29T11:47Z,"mwu

Yes it will work."
,azothegreat,2010-05-01T13:39Z,"@femin

ok."
,AddyTzu,2010-05-11T17:05Z,"Thanks azothefreat. Game works good with this crack but i have a problem when i receive the hidden blade. The game just freezes... or something like that. i can go menu, chose weapon, even his hair its moving lol but i cant do anything else. Every time froze at the same sequence. Anyway i guess that's my game fault, crack works good. thanks again."
,robwilkie,2010-05-20T03:33Z,"Wondering if anyone could help me. I installed the game, installed the patch that came with this download. Copied the 2 skidrow files into my installed assassin's creed folder. I first ran the skidrow.exe file, it brought up a sort of animation (used space to close it). Then tried running the game, it asked me to login (I'm assuming that isn't right). I made a dodgy login with one of my old emails, logged in and it then asked for a CD key.. Is there anything I have done wrong or need to do. Don't know if it matters but I am running Win 7 64x. Thanks in advance."
,robwilkie,2010-05-20T03:35Z,"Oh just to point out, when I copied over the .dll there was no 'replace item' question."
,robwilkie,2010-05-20T03:39Z,"Wow I am such a muppet, I put the .dll in the wrong folder (I did a search and found out where the original file was)"
,drtank,2010-05-20T05:59Z,works perfectly !!!!!!
,drtank,2010-05-20T06:01Z,"follow mkvsfan  advice .....
and enjoy !!!
sorry for double post."
,mwu,2010-06-02T15:03Z,"I heard many of them encounter ""session8"" issue. Does this crack fix the ""session8"" issue?"
,Normalcy,2010-06-03T12:41Z,"Works perfectly, easy to install. A lot easier than I expected considering the nature of the DRM.

No viruses showing up with NOD32."
,goodgerman123,2010-06-12T06:30Z,SKIDROW I bow down to your greatness!

,theRealKarmine,2010-06-13T23:22Z,btw you obviously do not update your nod32 because this shows up as a trojan.
,kitt32,2010-06-23T04:19Z,where do i get the game launcher?
,Mavyalex,2010-06-26T20:19Z,"Hello..My keyboard is disabled in this game..I bought the real game from gamesplanet.com and installed it, but the keyboard is still inactive. What can I do? I patched manually the game to 1.01...
I remeber I had installed the cracked game from Rzor or Skidrow and I had applied the Skidrow crack. The game laucnhed fine, but the keyboard was always not recognized...
e-mail me at : theo.ask@gmail.com please."
,ArkardVamp,2010-07-07T17:27Z,Works like a charm ^^
,Nekto2,2010-09-10T22:14Z,"Game works totally. But after exit it not saves some settings (brightness, mouse sensitivity, ...)"
,cevipirat,2011-01-04T16:52Z,"@mkvsfan

I did exactly as you describe it but when i try to run the  ""assassins_creed_2_1.01_us.exe"" the installation starts with Language promt and then it gives an error ""could not retrieve installation folder!Installation will be aborted"".
I`ve tried to move the exe file in all folders but it`s same all the time.
Any suggestions?"
