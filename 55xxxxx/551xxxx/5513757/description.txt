The original DEMO version of Unreal Tournament '99.

As of 04/25/2010 this classic fast pased 10YO demo game still offers multiple servers with; 
DM/TDM/CTF Regular Weapons, Real Weapons (Infil.UT), TDM Rocket Arena's, CTF ZeroPing InstaGib (most populair), including various Clans, Fantasy League Ladders, and new Anti Cheat protections (AntiTweak, ACE, CSHP).
 
It's crazy that such an old game and especially a demogame has going for such a long run. 
Who would have known..
