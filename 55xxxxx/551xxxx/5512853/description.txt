Family Guy Volume 3 disc 3. 

The only thing I did was to compress the disc. There is one American Dad preview in the special features so I just left it. 

On the disc are episodes 9 - 13 and the Special Features

(NTSC)


Like I've said before I'll always leave in the comments when I finish seeding which is usually when the ratio gets to 3 or 4 then on to the next disc, so if the torrent stops for a bit it's because I went to work and the torrent will be down for 4 to 8 hours.
