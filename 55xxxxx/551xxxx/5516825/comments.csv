,kews,2010-04-27T21:22Z,My bad. Extract files with 7z and not WinRAR.
,genotm,2010-04-28T06:25Z,"winrar sux anyways, i don't use it, 7zip is way better and faster"
,genotm,2010-04-28T06:28Z,"*updated the info on that winrar problem, ty for reporting it.
*updated to 2.0.1.5 and it works great, you only need  from the site posted at info'"
,RiP_ChUcKy,2010-04-28T23:28Z,"hey everyone, i been trying to get the latest versions (2012-2015) to work and play the new map ""the passing"". I tried alot and failed but i actually sucseeded with this one. But not at first, because the exe files (L4D2_Full_Update_2013_The_Passing.exe and all the other updates) didnt exctract all files to the game directory as it should. After i installed first update and checked the folders in my game directory i noticed not all the pak01.vpk files were there, 22 and forward were missing. So i extracted the patch again but to an empty folder and checked the files, and all the missing files were in there. So i had to extract all the updates to empty folders instead of to the game directory and then copy file by file to the game directory. It took a long time but now everything works perfect! 
Except for all this i did exactly what it said in the info... good luck people!! And thanks alot genotm!! but you might wanna check the exe's, it seems that it doesnt really overwrights the files. (might work differently on other OS.. im on vista 32)"
,genotm,2010-04-29T00:32Z,"@RiP_ChUcKy dunno why that happened to you, at me the updates worked just fine, same to my other 4 mates i instaled the game for."
,trimidogg,2010-04-30T12:54Z,"HI nice job G3NO i saw that most of the ppl downloaded the clean files there is no need for that here you have the Patch all files included also when your done installing run empty.bat it will empty the addons folder there was a problem in addons folder or if you already have the patches try empty that folder if your running a server and you wanna use this patch don't run the empty.bat because it will delete all plugins you already installed

,RiP_ChUcKy,2010-04-30T15:31Z,"hmmm yeah i forgot to tell you about the addons folder.. i also had problems with that... after i sucseeded getting this to work, i copied alot of addons which i already had (alot of new maps) into the addons folder: /left 4 dead2/left4dead2/addons... after that the game stoped working, it started again when i deleted everything in that folder"
,genotm,2010-04-30T23:44Z,"yeah, i know, i can't use any of my previous addons , if i copy 1 file in the addons folder... boom game crushes,... well at least i can use my soundmod :D"

,genotm,2010-06-11T08:26Z,is anyone reading the descriptions?
,Cenwulf,2010-06-13T01:51Z,First off I wanna say I bet this torrent works great and I'm seeding but I got a problem I think you can answer or maybe I'm just stupid ok so i was following your first step and i extracted l4d2 2.0clean zip with 7zip i did the first one and i got all the files and I got the game to start but it says steam needs to be running after the trailer and it starts to load(which btw is the farthest I've ever come to playing this game since I used about 3 other torrents)  well basic question is where is the installer cause I looked in some folders and I dont see anything that says l4d2 setup or setup or soomething of that sort do i have to extract from all of the l4d2 2.0 clean zip cause they dont want to open or extract for me and ve tried with winrar and 7zip but only the first one works for me
,findnatehere,2010-06-14T07:36Z,why is it that they keep telling me that i need steam in order for the game to run? what am i doing wrong here?
,genotm,2010-06-14T13:14Z,"it will allways tell "" you need steam"" because you wont/can't read:

REV_EMU !!!!"
