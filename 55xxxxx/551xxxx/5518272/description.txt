Fun thriller in the film noir style but shot in gorgeous Technicolor.  Never available on any video format this TV rip is directly from a TCM television broadcast.  Originally in 3D this exciting film was produced by disaster movie-king Irwin Allen (Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno) and features an avalanche and forest fire.  Lots of beautiful on-location photography in and around Glacier National Park.  Stars Victor Mature, Vincent Price, Piper Laurie and William Bendix.  ISO file unpacks to a single layer DVD.  Enjoy!
