"Spice and Wolf" tells the story of a traveling merchant named Lawrence who accidentally 'captures' a wolf harvest spirit named Horo, and makes a contract with her to return her to her homeland in The North.

Contrary to popular belief, "Spice and Wolf" is -NOT- an hentai, or full of fanservice. There is some nudity, but basically just in the "a harvest spirit probably wouldn't wear clothes", and not in a sexual/pornographic manner. Also just to make clear, Horo -does- wear clothes for the majority of the anime :P

I downloaded this and episode #7 was missing, and it turned-out to be an OVA, so I have included it in this as well, hence the "[complete]" bit. This is for the first season only, as the second season is called "Spice and Wolf II". All files are .AVI by the way.
