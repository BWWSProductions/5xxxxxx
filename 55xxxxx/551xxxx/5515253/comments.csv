,altemeldo,2010-04-27T12:47Z,"Good to have you back. I have one suggestion. I think it'll be better if you mux the subtitles into the mkv file itself. - just like you did for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. IMO, it'll make for neater archiving.

Pls upload: 
1. Book of Eli (Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman)
2. It's Complicated (Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, Meryl Streep)

Thanx."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-04-27T20:25Z,"@ansari.ec, m trying to get best results and its taking long time on my AMD Quad Core..

@yernavor, m busy will see it in future, right now no commitment..

@altemeldo, yes I know about it but the thing is people don't know how to disable them if they don't want it, keeping then in a separate file makes others comfortable to use it or not or use their own preferred language .SRT file.. any other thought on this?
and m happy that you remember Transformers rip and if check back the comments somebody have disliked the muxed subtitles.."
,altemeldo,2010-04-28T05:41Z,"@MKVGuy
Windows media player (WMP) cannot play mkv files unless a codec pack has been installed. And then it only understands srt format but it cannot turn off the subtitles (it doesn't recognise muxed subtitles).  

VLC on the other hand can enable & disable subtitles whether it is muxed or in srt. I think we should encourage people to use VLC to play mkv and then spread awareness of the option to enable/disable subtitles simply by pressing V on the keyboard. I think you can include this tip in the description/summary of the torrent as well as in the info text file that is included as part of the download."
