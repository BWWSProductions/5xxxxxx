Aired 23.04.2010

The 1-Click Kids have a bad ivtc with ghosted 
scene changes from start to finish. Pics 
included.

Also, knowing that they "capped" this from VOD,
and that the colors are all off, we have to 
question if it was even a legitimate stream 
capture.

As usual, their out of spec container contains
roughly 2mb of junk padding.

"Jackal Onassis Backstage Party"

As the struggling new Party Down team leader, 
Henry is forced to juggle an incognito rock 
star, the return of of Ron Donald and Casey, 
the girl who broke his heart.

Enjoy :)
