,daba_1,2010-04-25T04:13Z,"Bryce Janey began his career in his hometown of Marion, IA at the age of 13 in a blues-rock trio called The Janey's. With his mother on drums and his father BillyLee on guitar, The Janey's played regionally and nationally from Chicago to Los Angeles. They shared the stage with over 50 national acts, including Buddy Guy, Delbert McClinton, Blues Traveler, Johnny Winter and Koko Taylor.

While still in The Janey's, Bryce began a solo career and released his first CD, Practice What You Preach, in 1996 on an Indi label in Iowa called Hot Fudge Music. This release was later picked up by an independent label Cold Wind Records in Minneapolis, MN where Bryce began to showcase in local clubs like Whiskey Junction and BrewBakers in St. Paul.

Two more CDs were released, Live at Checker's Tavern and Sweet Baby Jane. These early CDs have gained national attention and five stars from Blues Access magazine (1998) and great reviews from Blues Revue and Living Blues, among others.

In 1999, Bryce signed with San Diego music attorney, Rod Underhill and became the number one artist on mp3.com later that year.

In 2001, Bryce released his next CD, Bare Wire, and began touring again with his own band and with Iowa's own The Blue Band. Bryce played festivals and successful venues like B.B. King's in Memphis and Buddy Guy's Legends in Chicago. The Blue Band also played venues in Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Nashville, Denver and Keystone.

In early 2003, Bryce released Live At JM O'Malley's. That same year, he also released The Janey's with his father, Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee, BillyLee Janey. He performed with The Janey's father/son team-up, as well as with his own band."
