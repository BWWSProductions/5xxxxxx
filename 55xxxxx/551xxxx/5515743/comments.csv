,sodiumora,2010-04-27T09:31Z,is this the real deal??
,traxstar7,2010-04-27T11:46Z,"Yes, this is real.

Works great, but you have to unlock it etc.
And all these new updates will not make it unlockable, so use all the old softwares.

Thanks btw"
,Simon2672,2010-04-28T08:40Z,"thanks for making this available!!!

Something's changed, it wont unlock in newer devices like Oregon (""Cant unlock maps"") even if using the patched Mapsource. Works with older ones though."
,nferi,2010-04-28T10:29Z,"Hi,

it is ok, no virus, I can register it and use with  MapSource_v6_15_6_Special. With new version of MapSource you cannot use registered map."

,Simon2672,2010-04-28T21:32Z,"Now I have tried with 6.15.11 jetmouse and 6.15.7. special but no luck. Works with Nuvi but does not work with Oregon. Oregon says ""Cannot unlock maps"". Have tried both with SD card and in device memory :-(("
,NUNOCORREIA,2010-04-28T22:10Z,"Can anyone help me how to install the mapsource?
I can´t unlock it.

Thanks"
,Kringe,2010-04-29T11:58Z,It won´t unlock on the Dakota either but works fine on the Nüvi. Any ideas? 
,Kringe,2010-04-29T12:02Z,"It was released a few days ago as a update for 2011 in the Nuvi Lifetime update, so I guess it´s real. "
,NUNOCORREIA,2010-04-29T12:56Z,"Hello,

,xiaoxiao,2010-04-29T17:06Z,"Hi
I have never used pirated stuff on my Garmin so i am all new to this.

Is there a way i can backup my Original Map from my Garmin, so that when i try to use this, and if anything does mess up i can just restore the backup?
If so how can i do this?

Also is there a step by step guide to installing this 2011 map?

Lastly, there have been some speed limit changes on my normal route, is it possible to edit the map and change the speed limit on the road and the speed cams?

Thanks

Xiao"
,IngeSant,2010-04-29T19:34Z,"xiaoxiao - Make a safe copy of your gmapsupp.img and/or gmapsromfile.img on your computer. Then follow alahimbis instructions.

You cant change speed limit on the map. But you can put in custom waypoints that will give you a warning when you come close to it...

almahimbis guide works great for my Colorado. Thx a lot!"
,Simon2672,2010-04-29T19:58Z,"@almahimbi, many thanks !"
[T],Ametz,2010-04-29T20:56Z,A better install/upgrade instruction that xiaoxiao added would be nice..
[T],Ametz,2010-04-29T21:17Z,I ment @almahimbi
,xiaoxiao,2010-04-30T10:01Z,"Sorry but the instructions given by almahimbi seem to be unclear for me, maybe because i am all too new to this.

Is it possible for someone to post a step by step guide for example:

Backup
1) ..
2)...

Installing new Map:
1)...
2)...

This would be much appreciated.

Thank You

,Kringe,2010-04-30T10:50Z,MapReverseConverter converts newer maps to work MapSource 6.13.7.
,xiaoxiao,2010-05-01T12:56Z,"Nice guide i found, thought i might share it with you.
I followed it exactly and it worked.
But i used this Europe Map here on pirate bay, as on the guide it is North America.

Everything else i followed to the letter.
(remember use this map here not the one on the guide)

,Ano111,2010-05-03T21:39Z,"A few days after this release Garmin already released the 2011.10b version. The new file is called ""garmin_rmu_cneunt_2011_10b.exe"" but I do not know the difference with the first release."
,jammeke,2010-05-05T10:51Z,Error when opening. D/L this 3x  and no GO :-(
,kingmike,2010-05-15T13:35Z,"Works fine, just follow the instructions on haklabs.com. Just one thing is incorrect: map id is 2204, not 2211."
,Ano111,2010-05-16T10:50Z,"I just heard that in the ""B"" version only the file gmap3d.img (3D buildings) has been updated. The map data are the same."
,Littleukkie,2010-05-16T20:38Z,"works great with map id 2204 and the description from almahimbi 

Great job !!!!!"
,daimakai,2010-05-22T13:38Z,"Hm, I also receive an error when I want to execute CNNANT2011_10Update.msi. Archive damage or corrupt. Extracting the rar files is not a problem."
,daimakai,2010-05-22T13:40Z,"Ok, solved. msi files were set to open with winrar. That gave the error. Opening with windows installer solved it."
,y0k00n0,2010-06-10T08:28Z,Works perfect for me on Zumo 660.
,Digifan,2010-06-14T20:00Z,Do you have to install your original Mapsource program in English before this can be done? I'm getting incorrect language dll even if I have done exactly as it says on the haklabs site... Anyone else with the same problem? Anyone who have solved it?
,Digifan,2010-06-14T20:47Z,"I am giving the answer myself to the Incorrect language dll message. Go to C:\garmin and remove the different Mapsource languages (all the languages like MapsourceSVE.dll, MapsourceFRA.dll but not the Mapsource_Lang.dll). This seems to fix the problem and you can start the Mapsource program."
,eriktheheadlouse,2010-06-16T18:18Z,"I'm getting an error that I cannot open the CNNANT2011_10Update.msi file. All files extracted OK and MSI file association is not corrupted. Any ideas anyone? Cheers, ETH."
