    While not fair or unbiased, at least this                  
    coverage makes an effort to frame both                    
    sides.  Why can't people stop arguing and              
    focus on the data. There is information                
        there, we just have to find it.  Look at               
        genetics.  Look at environmental causes.               
       Find the link.  It's there.  Stop Arguing.                
    Stop focusing on profits or litigation.                    
    Find it.
