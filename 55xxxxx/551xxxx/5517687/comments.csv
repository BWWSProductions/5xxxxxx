I'd like to get all the Johnson, Yamaha, and mercury outboard manuals too....."
,PKM9000,2010-04-27T19:18Z,Thanks for the comment Bill. I can get you the service manuals for the outboards you mentioned but they're already readily available on the net just use Google to search for them. These Honda service manuals are not available anywhere for free on the net so I decided to up them.
,MiiruPeilo,2010-04-28T19:18Z,I didn't find any Yamaha marine service manual anywhere for free. So can you upload that Yamaha marine service manual? 
,PKM9000,2010-04-29T01:26Z,Miiru there's a Seloc manual for Yami outboard's 1984-1996 on TPB http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4970363/SELOC_1984-1996_YAMAHA_OUTBOARD_2HP-250HP_SHOP_REPAIR_MANUAL

I have decrypted all of the PDF's.  If you can give me a location to upload them so that you can make them available to all, I will do that.
