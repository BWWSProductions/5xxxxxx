,JERO-OEEN,2010-11-17T21:27Z,"Guys.
How can you play the game? It asks me for a cd key after i've put in my REAL account+password name. I couldn't find any generator in any of these files."

,JERO-OEEN,2010-11-18T09:15Z,"And also what do you mean by directory? Such as for example: C:Assassin's Creed(folder)?
Do you have to replace the excisting ""Values"" file with the one provided here? Vague guide you got there man... but the upload is great. I think... "
,bjede,2011-01-20T23:16Z,"Hi
I downloaded AC2 a few just days ago...
and I have one question: what is this values.db file for? If I understand correctly it unlocks primary and secondary missions in game?
I found latest version (1910). What would happen if I apply it after installation? Will it open all game content immediately or it will be opened progressively, as I get on through the game?

Thanks!"
