2nd try

This is the complete second season of The Biggest Loser UK version.  If anyone has season 1, please up it.  The UK version is not near the quality of the US or Oz versions but it's worth watching if you like those.

1 Stone = 14 pounds

Yes, there are only 12 epis.

I may have internet problems to where I will not be online all the time to seed.  Pleasee bear with me as my connection is slow and not reliable.  These files are coming to you from the south pacific.  :)


Enjoy!
