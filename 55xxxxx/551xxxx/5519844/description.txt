"TORCH" 

When two sisters are killed in a fire, Detectives 
Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Eliot Stabler 
(Chris Meloni) are confused about why they are 
called to investigate. They soon discover that 
Stabler's old partner, ADA Jo Marlowe (guest star 
Sharon Stone), has been put on the case -- despite 
the absence of a sex crime -- because the two 
victims were so young, and that she has enlisted 
the duo to help. However, as the investigation 
continues, Benson and Stabler find that the case 
might be more suited to their department than 
anyone originally assumed, and Stabler's 
interrogation tactics threaten to get the 
detectives into trouble.

Enjoy :)
