Apartment :- 

A; thriller
Dir: Jagmohan Mundhra 
Cast: Tanushree Dutta, Neetu Chandra, Rohit Roy, Anupam Kher 


What's it about: Karan (Roy) and Preeti (Dutta) live in an apartment. Despite their affair, Preeti has trust issues with Karan and asks him to move out after catching him in a compromising position. Enter Neha (Neetu), a village belle who exhibits strange behaviour and becomes Preeti's roommate. Soon, strange incidents start happening. The neighbour's (Kher) cat is poisoned, a pet goldfish becomes fodder for the crows, and Preeti's life gets caught in a mesh of unexpected circumstances. 

What's hot: The premise is interesting, and Neetu's character does have an edge at the start. Not telling us anything about her background or where she's from gives her a mystery element.

What's not: Before the movie began, Mundhra gave an impromptu speech to the present audience telling them he's fully responsible for how good, bad or ugly Apartment turned out. Unfortunately, it's the third option that he was referring to. Despite being labelled a thriller, there's nothing that fits the genre. Loud background music, jarring close-up and hideous camera angles are no substitutes for a rivetting storyline. After Neha's diagnosis and its result, the plot reaches new heights of insanity resulting in a climax that swings between the devil and the deep sea. Among the cast, Tanushree gets to react more than act. Neetu dilates her pupils expecting us to be scared. Anupam Kher and his cat Shehzadi have more chemistry than the lead pair! 

What to do: Archaic in treatment and extremely outdated, this Apartment is in need of a serious makeover.
