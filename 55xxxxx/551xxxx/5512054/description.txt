The Magician Ltd | 1912 | ISBN: n/a | 507 pages | PDF | 10/9 Mb








This is original the "Famous Locked Book of Magic" that originally sold with a lock and key, its secrets were so carefully guarded. It is a wonderful look at the world of magic at the turn of the (last) century. This book was dedicated to Harry Houdini.



Stage tricks, parlor magic, platform, cabaret, grand illusions... they're all here. Plus the book is illustrated with what must be hundreds of exquisite pen and ink drawings. There is a chapter on close up magic that offers something to the amateur magician of today, and Harry Houdini himself contributed a chapter of his own secrets to the book.

Part Eight, Comedy Tricks;
