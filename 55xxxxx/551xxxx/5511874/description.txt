Somehow the titles of the films of hardcase actor Lawrence Tierney seemed to be extensions of the man's 

personality, as witness such films as The Devil Thumbs a Ride and Born to Kill. In the latter picture, Tierney  starts 

the ball rolling by committing a double murder in a jealous pique. Claire Trevor discovers the bodies, but says 

nothing to the police; she's leaving town and doesn't want to be impeded. Trevor and Tierney  meet and fall in love 

on the train to San Francisco. Unfortunately, Trevor  is married, so Tierney shifts his affections to her sister, 

Audrey Long (later the wife of director Billy Wilder). He marries Long, though he keeps up his illicit affair with 

Trevor. When detectives investigating the murders come snooping, they are bought off by Tierney's pal Elisha 

Cook Jr.--who is then murdered by Tierney, who suspects that Cook is carrying on with Trevor  (Cook  seldom 

survived to the end of any of his films). When Tierney  finally does face arrest, it's at the instigation of the jealous 

Trevor, who is shot full of holes for her trouble. Born to Kill was based on James Gunn's novel Deadlier Than the 

Male.
