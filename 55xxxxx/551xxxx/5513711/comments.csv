,archfiend,2010-04-25T04:37Z,Great Job as always! I need advice. Got lots of DVDs I want to rip and share. Have tried various rippers but can't get the settings right to achieve 700MB files like you. Any advice as to what the best ripper is and it's settings etc would be much appreciated!

audio=9
video=9

No its not action but its a real life scenario and it shows you what real people have to deal with just to get simple pleasures in life that most of us take for granted, like a healthy child.

Thanks FXG."

Don't need other subs. Simply open the srt file with a notepad, copy the contents and paste it in another text file. Now, name this file name as [avi movie file name].srt. Now, put this new srt file in the movie forlder and you're good to go! :) "
