Upload for pink-skulls is broken - again. Only VIP members (green skulls) can upload.
Third time in two days.
Sorry."
,lilars26,2010-04-27T17:16Z,"Sorry 20/40
That seems very unfair to you."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-27T17:26Z,"@lilars: For someone in my condition is already very hard to see and recognize and then type the letters and numbers hidden in so called ""captcha code"" which was and is prevalent reason for breakage lately. VIP guys are relieved of that (protection against spamming with fake torrents"".

Yeah, it is unfair to some extension - I am too short a member on TPB and it might be that I never become ""green"" (VIP). Skull - for sure."
,lilars26,2010-04-27T20:34Z,"Green is an enviable colour.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do like the green,green grass of home.
Except when it needs cutting.
Green is the colour of money.
That.s what an American told me.
The Irish half of me loves green.
The French half,not so much.
I like Greenday.
Green means go.
So,goodbye."
,hkoraddi,2010-04-27T21:44Z,on wat bases do they give green skull man

Cheers Stev"
,lilars26,2010-04-28T16:44Z,"Hey 20/40.
Could you please let us know if you are okay."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-28T17:17Z,"Yes my friend, I check TPB upload every 20 minutes last day or so, but still only VIPs can upload... "
,Kencoldman,2010-04-28T18:56Z,Hey great work 20-40. How about V S01E09 not trying to hurry or any thing. Later.
,lilars26,2010-04-28T19:37Z,"You have been so quiet I was getting worried
about you.Try to enjoy your downtime."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T06:57Z,"If you have eMule (or some working edk program) you might do Search for some [quark]s. Bigger files make no sense. It's currently only working alternative, but slow as hell."
,the_shroud,2010-04-29T07:06Z,"n'joy the rest bro, no one deserves it more than u ;)"
,hkoraddi,2010-04-29T07:43Z,TPB was down for a while so any good news
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T07:57Z,"Nope, still VIP-only."
,stev666,2010-04-29T07:59Z,"morning 20-40

glad to see your still here. can you tell me what emule server the quarks can be found on?

thanks you my friend"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T08:02Z,@Stev: eDonkey 2.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T08:15Z,"ALL:

Alternative is to do search for me on Facebook, there is my e-mail address. Contact me and I will reply to anybody with sending a torrent with Embedded tracker for wanted thing. But - in general, it work if you use uTorrent, in Advanced settings have enabled the use of embedded trackers. Exact procedure is explained in uTorrent on-line Help. There is caveat to that: from experience, it sometimes doesn't fly, for unknown reason. Also, if my ISP decides to change his IP address, embedded tracker cannot work till new torrent with such new address is created and - re-distributed.

In short - I better be waiting on TPB..."
[V],pluto999,2010-04-29T08:20Z,@ 20/40 what is your email ID?

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T09:21Z,"@pluto: On Facebook I made my address publicly available, not just to ""Facebook friends"" or members - but to anybody. I wont put my address or (A.ID) here."

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T15:26Z,"PLEASE, DO NOT write down publicly on Facebook the purpose and what's about, that's why I have left there my e-mail address for anyone, not just for cyber/facebook-friends. Please.
Do not get me in more trouble. Be reasonable."
,stev666,2010-04-29T19:34Z,no problem 20-40 i understand. i wouldent want people doing that ether.
,madtown4,2010-04-29T22:20Z,"sent you a email, hopefully you get it . you probable have thousands by now. hopefully tpb gets right soon. take care my friend.hope to see your uploads again"
,believenu,2010-04-30T00:30Z,gosh .. it seems even tpb is full of bs politics. and not just sharing.. i will keep looking for you hopefully they will get their act together soon.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-30T07:17Z,"@ALL:
All TV shows that I usually encode would be available for download in next 8 hours in [quark] form. 

All interested should find my e-mail address on Facebook (address is available to anyone - you do not need to apply for ""Facebook friend"").
Just send me e-mail message from some valid e-mail host and I will reply with links for direct download of my files.

I hope that TPB would be back for ""plain"" ""trusted"" uploaders who aren't esteemed VIP members.
Demonoid is also ""down"", and here I offer some alternative."
