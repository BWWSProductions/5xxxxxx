A9 V9

hey RiddlerA there is something wrong with audio on skins series 4. the middle few episodes"
,calcoolis,2010-08-07T02:47Z,"These are all great!

But there a problem in 3x10 at 1:59.  The video ends unless you skip over the next few seconds."
,lalalaa123447,2010-09-08T07:38Z,"Why doesn't this work?
I downloaded skins series 1&2 from someone else and they work perfectly.
But when I go to click on an episode to watch after I downloaded the whole thing from you it says ""File could not be opened. File is not a movie file.""
Please help."
,mekkafly,2010-10-25T03:14Z,sooo... is there a way to make these work on my ipad/itunes?
,dsrs,2011-02-17T16:35Z,"SOMETHING IS WRONG
when i open s03e08 i see part of that movie with george clooney where he flies around to meetings!
also the file size is just way too small"
,dsrs,2011-02-17T19:06Z,"OK if anyone else has been having problems with episodes 5-10 the reason could be shoddy encoding.
i can play all the 5-10 avi files in vlc
but if you check them with gspot you will see that all the first four episodes are made with virtual dub [in one case with MEncoder]
the problematic episodes are all done with 'tv release packer' which it says is made by 'someone'
vso convertx2dvd breaks down trying to work with episode 5 onwards
garbled sound is produced and the log says there are too many audio sync issues to fix"
,dsrs,2011-02-17T19:12Z,"please ignore my two previous posts
fuck me i posted here in the wrong place
i was referring to another torrent entirely
the files here are excellent quality
apologies"
