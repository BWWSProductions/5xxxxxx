,addictedtomovies,2010-04-24T23:08Z,"2040, can you help me? I want to convert some of my movies that I have downloaded so that I can play them on my iPod. Can you tell me what program you use to convert and what settings I should use? Any help would be appreciated because your uploads always work on my iPod. Thanks for all you do man."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-25T06:47Z,"@addictedtomovies: I use my own... and have little or no experience with other programs.
I suggest you to download few of the zillion ""video converters"" (ones which are free), some short clip (2-3 minutes) and follow their instructions and built-in presets. Once you succeed, fed iTunes and watch the quality.
I know that HandBrake and MeGUI are the best - but needs more knowledge from users."

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-25T21:18Z,"My nephew use WinAVI but for his cell. It's nice and easy to use, but torrents with cracks are awful and dangerous thing for unskilled users. 00% - AND THAT I speak from experience - are in-fact Trojans or time-activated worms (bombs).
Also, many, many of the programs - and I know that too ( my ""less or none experience"" in real-life is ""I cannot call myself an expert"") are ripoffs of mplayer, mencoder and ffmpeg  which are - FREE from down of time. OK, our (my) work is not sainthood by nature, but I cannot, and wont support such blatant stealing for purpose of financial gain of some two-men companies. Cracks are available, as some sort of ""equalizing"" thing, but why in hell use something potently malicious if absolutely free (AND best ones) are for free."

Funny script, almost ""intelligent""."
