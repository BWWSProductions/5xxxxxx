,aj.daDDy,2010-04-24T22:49Z,will my dvd play this file if i burn it without converting? my dvd supports divx n mp3.......
,MakMan06,2010-04-25T02:38Z,"Good to know, but is the AC3 audio 2.0 channel or 5.1 channel - really makes all the difference ya know :)"
,MakMan06,2010-04-25T02:39Z,"Oh whoops, sorry, just saw the updated release notes. Thanks for the up though, will be worth it!"
,thirumal90,2010-04-25T05:25Z,"Superb clarity...!
Thanx...so much"
,james3973,2010-04-25T08:00Z,How is this different from the one released a little while ago ?
,marut76,2010-04-25T09:07Z,"BTW, just a warning people,
only the newest models of standalone DVDplayers that support xvid&divx can play files with resolutions higher the 720x .
If yours is made before 2008, most likely this will not work on it."
,triniwi,2010-04-25T13:39Z,Good quality for my 720p plasma thanks a lot...............................................................

,shaqnemo,2010-04-25T15:17Z,Is the alien speech subbed?  the 480p version has none
,ekul_reklaw,2010-04-25T19:55Z,"shaqnemo, in the details it lists the languages as English / Na'vian.....so I guess the answer would be yes that the Na'vian language is subtiltiled. Will let you know for sure if it ever finishes downloading..   :o)"
,absawer,2010-04-25T23:46Z,"Good quality. Thanks!
Subtitles not hardcoded, included separately."
[T],jerry7_57,2010-04-26T00:30Z,Does anyone no where to get srt. file for the Na'vian language only. It kind of sucks to have to have the whole movie subbed just to know what they are saying. 
,shaqnemo,2010-04-26T01:24Z,@ jerry7_57:  I got na'vi only subs at one of the 480 releases of FLAWL3SS.. it worked.hope it helps .
,Muddyowns,2010-04-26T02:42Z,can anyone confirm wether or not there are english subtitles for the na'vi speaking parts or not? and also explain how to get them if theyre not alrdy there
,burakao,2010-04-26T06:44Z,ahhhh its taking so longgg. plzz SEEEEEDDD !!!!

,Valverine,2010-04-26T17:25Z,do i need modded xbox 360 to watch this video with it??? please answer fast as u can
,pman2323,2010-04-27T00:56Z,"This is probably the best, and smallest 720p rip of avatar you will find. Looks great even on a 55""LCD, it even looks better than some 1080p rips that are double this size.  The bitrate is appropriate for a movie like this, with a lot of action. Only problem i got with this is that the subs aren't embedded directly into the video, so they dont appear when you watch it on xbox, but the lack of huge black bars at the top and bottom of the screen completly make up for it. "
,pman2323,2010-04-27T01:16Z,"You dont need a modded xbox to watch it, any xbox 360, with an internet connection can play this video. "
,burakao,2010-04-27T05:07Z,"ru guys seriously joking?? wtf ???? ive been downloadin for 2 days now and only at 56%. this aint fukn cool!!

,jawman,2010-04-28T06:42Z,"wow you fucking cocksuckers, learn to seed. if you download something, repay those who shared it with you it by seeding (sharing) to others. your share ratio should be at least 1.0 before you remove the torrent. no one likes a fucking leech. and remember what goes around comes around, so fucking seed! asshole!"
,MakMan06,2010-04-28T12:31Z,"Unfortunately, no amount of telling people to seed is going to change that - the world is full of greedy arseholes, or even people who don't understand how BitTorrent works! I can wait, though, because I want to own this movie, the local video store has exorbitant prices, and I don't own a Blu-Ray player! I bet this'll be great on Xbox 360 though - in the meantime, be patient - I am!"

,Scobbalobba,2010-05-02T02:41Z,"Agentpiratebay, fantastic download mate, my hat goes off to you. For some reason this one downloaded for me in pretty good time where as I was a few days ago trying to download another Blu Ray version on here that was just under 8GB, and it was taking forever so i gave up the ghost, this one was done overnight no problems and many thanks for the upload. 

Once question please guys as I am new to all of this downloading stuff, can someone tell me how I get the Subs intot he movie please.

Cheers,

Scobba"
[T],agentpiratebay,2010-05-03T06:49Z,"You choose the language and rename the file the same as the avi's (Avatar.2009.720p.BDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON)

If your using VLC or media player classic the subs will start right away.

For WMP you need to install VobSub first."
,Marko2010,2010-05-05T06:26Z,"Agentpiratebay, this is an amazing download, best quality movie I ever downloaded!

I need some help though with the subtitles. I just downloaded VobSub but I have no clue how to use it! It would be greatly appreciated if you explained how to get the subtitles to work.

Thanks"
,Marko2010,2010-05-05T06:54Z,"I just played the movie in VLC, but the subtitles are not there =/

Please help"
