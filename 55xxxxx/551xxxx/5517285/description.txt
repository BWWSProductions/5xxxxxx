FM are a British AOR/hard rock band. In the U.S., they are often referred to as FMUK. They have released eleven albums to date. Two of those, Indiscreet and Tough It Out reached the UK Albums Chart, whilst five of the band's singles made inroads into the UK Singles Chart.
 FM was formed in the summer of 1984 in London. The band was originally composed of the ex-Samson pair of bassist Merv Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp, the Overland brothers â€“ vocalist/guitarist Steve and lead guitarist Chris Overland, both formerly of Wildlife, and keyboardist Philip Manchester, also known as Didge Digital. The band initially wrote six songs. In December of that year they secured a recording contract with the CBS/Portrait label.
The first public appearance of FM (not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name) was on Valentineâ€™s Day in 1985. The debut album, Indiscreet followed and their debut single "Frozen Heart" was heard in many venues during 1986. FM hit the road in Europe supporting Tina Turner, Meat Loaf, Foreigner, Gary Moore, Status Quo and Magnum, also opening for REO Speedwagon at Londonâ€™s Hammersmith Odeon. At the year's end they accepted a spot with Bon Jovi on their Slippery When Wet tour.
When CBS folded the Portrait label, FM switched to Epic. The Overland brothers went to the United States to write with Desmond Child, returning with the hard rock anthem "Bad Luck". QueensrÃ¿che and Dokken producer Neil Kernon was engaged to oversee 1989â€™s Tough It Out.
