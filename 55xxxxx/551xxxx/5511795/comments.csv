,anonim1979,2010-04-24T18:38Z,"""is this standalone divx player compatible? ""

Only *HD XVID/DIVX* standalone players and X360 / PS3 will play XVID with resoultions bigger that 720x576

Normal standalones are limited up to 720x576. (aka 480p Rips)
Preferably also no more than 2GB avi files.

As more than 2GB avis are problematic for normal standalones as they are 2 or more parts on one file - and only first one will play.
If the avi file is over 2GB = MULTIPART (use gSpot to test)

So befor burning bigger than 2GB so to be compatibile with most STANDALONE DivX players - will need to be split with VirtualDubMod ( http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/virtualdubmod/VirtualDubMod_1_5_10_2_All_inclusive.zip )
1. Open movie file:
""File"", ""Open video file"" (or use Ctrl+O shortcut), then browse to dir with YOUR_MOVIE.avi (press NO if asked about MP3)
2. ""File"", Save as (or simply press F7)
Choose ""Segment output file"" and set to 2036MB (no more)
(If you want CD sized parts you can use 700MB value)
Put new name and/or directory !BEFORE clicking SAVE: CHANGE(Video)""Video mode"" to ""Direct stream copy""
Done in 1-2 minutes! "
