This is for people that want the highest and best of best from Xvid and still be able to play on your non- X264 stuff... If you've got Visons version and are happy
with it no real reason to get this, but their version has lower video rates and big for me has 448 audio ours has the max you can do on Xvid AC3 640.
I do not think you can make this movie look much better with current Xvid codec (and 1080p will not help) so take or leave it, but was from 45GB source so Enjoy.
