Working release of GTA:EFLC

Instructions:
1. Unrar Crack and game files (GTAEFLC parts)in seperate folders
2. Install "Crack By Dante2229.exe" in EFLC folder of the game
3. In the EFLC folder of the game you'll find "Grand Theft Auto IV - DLC FIX"
4. Copy files from that folder in main folder of game
5. In crack you'll also find 2 registry (regedit) icons - Now the hardest part
6. Copy the location of the game folder (example   C:GamesEFLC)
7. Right-click the 1 regedit file and select edit (The notepad will show up)
8  Now the regedit will show where where needs to patch but we must show the right location (originally it says D: Games) - but you need to paste the right location of game in stead of the old location. VERY IMPORTANT - don't forget to make double slash in all places(not C:slash but make it C:slashslash).Make this in all places. There are 4 places where you need to paste the location and after that hit save
9. Repeat step 8 for second registry file.
10. After this, apply both registry files by double-clicking them with left mouse key
11. Launch game by clicking "LaunchEFLC"



Instructions seem really hard, but I assure you that if this is done correctly the game will work 100%.
For any question just post a comment.
