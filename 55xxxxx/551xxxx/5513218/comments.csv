,BigDet,2010-04-25T20:59Z,Do you have to download darkcorp to play this one to
,Faltzer,2010-04-26T01:49Z,"As far as I am aware, no.  This seems to be running fine for me under Wii Firmware 4.2 + USB Loader GX + IOS 222"
,kevoo_11,2010-04-27T14:12Z,"I haven't tested it on a loader, but it's still not functioning via burned discs.  "
,Faltzer,2010-04-27T23:24Z,"Well, I don't believe there is a fundamental difference between downloads, as MH3 is reported to not be working for many in general.  Granted, I do not use discs to boot my Wii games.

For USB Loader GX, I gather that on cIOS 223, having IOS38 merged with IOS60 allows the game to work."
,bundoodle,2010-05-09T13:12Z,"works on 4.2 burned to disk , playing with wasabi dx modchip with not a single problem . will not work on neogamma , u need to install ios 222 as stated above . but as i hav read on other posts , ppl with modchips are havin very few problems"
,BROANGE,2010-06-13T20:47Z,"I've burnt it twice, used 2 different discs; 1 Verbatim DVD-R and the other is unknown. Both have the same problem, at first, the intro is kinda choppy. When I chose ""Begin The Game"", a black screen appears and a long sound ""IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII"". Do you have any idea what's the problem? PLEASE, HELP ME. I downloaded this for 3 DAYS and 9 HOURS(Jeez. I know we have a slow connection)! When it finished downloading, I was so excited to play the game. But that black screen and noise always happen. BUT, when I choose ""Arena Play"" or ""Gallery"", the black screen and noise doesn't happen. This is my 2nd downloaded Wii game, the first game was a succes. What could be the problem in this game? P.M me 666WEIRDY666@gmail.com"

,Gemgemchan,2011-04-17T01:08Z,After clicking on new game the screen goes black and a beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep sound is made.
,Wwarez,2011-06-29T07:11Z,"Confirmed working from CFG USB loader. Use cIOS 223 instead of 222 or w/e your default is. Need to change cios from your USB loader, not the Wii bootloader. Thanks for up."
,Wwarez,2011-06-29T07:12Z,"P.S. My problem was (prior to switching to 223) the long mosquito-like sound after hitting ""play,"" too."
,chedderB,2011-07-22T03:23Z,"Wwarze you are the man. I had the mosquito freeze and loading w/ ios 223 fixed it.

email me at jhscooby@gmail.com"
,ggf162,2011-09-24T21:18Z,I have no experience at all in this kind of stuff
,poobloh,2011-10-12T04:12Z,"Wwarez... I love you.

I was trying to use cIOS 222 and some other methods but after hours of work and reading your comment, I put cIOS 223 on my softmodded Wii and put it as the IOS on the game in my USB loader (WiiFlow). It got past the annoying BEEP sound/black screen.

Thank you, and thanks to the uploader"
,IceCold_Chick,2011-10-18T15:27Z,"Hey, I've downloaded this game, and as for many people, I can't really get past the annoying IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII beep. I've been reading the comments with solutions. But can someone be a bit more specific about how to solve it? I'm not really experienced here, but I did manage to softmod my wii by myself.

As I go to game options, I noticed that my IOS is  248. Do I have to change it there?

Thanks!!!"
,usrmd,2011-11-09T04:58Z,seed please! :)

,LA.CLiPPERS.562,2011-12-01T16:49Z,Confirmed working on USB LOADER GX wii 4.2u! At first like a few people on here i got the Beeep when selecting a new game i went to the settings in usb loader and change the ios to 223 and it stil had the beep so i went back to the settings and change it to ios 222 and it worked perfectly! Hope this helps
,Sivos,2012-01-24T00:09Z,"Works fine on USB Loader GX without changing the iOS for me.  Of course, by default mine might be 222 (I can't remember).  I'm using the latest version, so that may have an effect on it.  Thanks for the upload!"
,cloud7cloud,2012-05-24T20:26Z,great i burned to a dvd and it works fine thx great torrent
,MrSan.,2012-06-05T19:40Z,I have a copy of this game and the disc doesn't works on my 4.0U Wii. But I don't know if the files are exactly the same of this torrent.
,B3NC0N,2012-06-11T03:28Z,"Is there any specific reason it is an ""IOS Image file"" did i down load something wrong or is it just like that before you burn it to a disk?"
,scap420,2012-06-29T19:37Z,lol at B3NC0N just stop or you'll mess something up.  FALTZER fantastic torrent man perfect quality. Big Props
