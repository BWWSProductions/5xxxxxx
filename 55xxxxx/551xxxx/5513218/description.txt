The game was originally planned to be a PlayStation 3 title, but due to high development costs for that console Capcom instead decided to develop it for the Wii.[4] Prior to its debut, a demo of Monster Hunter Tri was included with Japanese copies of Monster Hunter G. A special bundle was also released on August 1 featuring the game packaged with a black Wii console and a Classic Controller Pro. On August 3, 2009, Capcom issued a press release confirming the game would be localized for North American and European markets.[5] On February 24, 2010, Capcom announced that online play would be provided free of charge.[6] Separate servers will be used for America and Europe. Wii Speak is supported, making this the first game in the franchise to include native VoIP capability.[7] The localized version for North America has been delayed until Capcom's second fiscal quarter, with the North American release date set at April 20, 2010 and the Australian release date set at April 29, 2010.
