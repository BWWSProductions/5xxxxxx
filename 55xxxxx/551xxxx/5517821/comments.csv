Ignore ownage9999, he has no clue whatsoever!

The 2005 theatrical release of Doom ran for about 1hr48mins. Then in early 2006 the unrated version was released which is around 7-8 minutes longer and contains a bunch of violent and gory scenes that were censored to make the nicer, sweeter mainstream cinema version of 2005.

For your information."
