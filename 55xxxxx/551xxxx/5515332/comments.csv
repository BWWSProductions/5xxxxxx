,hielo999,2010-04-25T23:47Z,"I know this is PirateBay, and completely anonymous, and no one will care, but I am a first generation Cuban, my Dad got to watch Che himself put a bullet into my Grandfathers head, because he was too slow getting Che's tea.  This kind of movie is right up there with the ""Hitler was Misunderstood"" movies.

Do what you will."
,adil3467,2010-04-26T06:37Z,dude plzzzzzzzzzzzz ----   clash of the titans  ---- i need it.................
,kanha,2010-04-26T12:29Z,"thanks for che.......
plz upload 'the da vinci code'......
and when u r going to rip 720p movies......"
,altemeldo,2010-04-27T12:44Z,"Good to have you back. I have one suggestion. I think it'll be better if you mux the subtitles into the mkv file itself. - just like you did for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. IMO, it'll make for neater archiving.

Pls upload: 
1. Book of Eli (Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman)
2. It's Complicated (Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, Meryl Streep)

Thanx."
,mkvfan,2010-04-27T14:48Z,"Hard coded subtitles isn't required by everyone... If you need, you can hard code by yourself too..."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-04-27T20:35Z,"@mkvfan, harcoded means adding subtitles on each frame, just like adding some text on a JPG through MS Paint Brush where you cannot remove the text back..

the MKV container comes with many features, one is you can have Subtitles and Chapters files in it instead having them files in the same folder to load them.. with MKV you can keep Subs and Chapters in the video file.. but the thing the many people don't have the idea that subtitles can be disabled if they are in muxed in a MKV file..

in VLC go to Video menu>Subtiles Track>Disable"
,altemeldo,2010-04-28T05:46Z,"@MKVGuy
Windows media player (WMP) cannot play mkv files unless a codec pack has been installed. And then it only understands srt format but it cannot turn off the subtitles (it doesn't recognise muxed subtitles).  

VLC on the other hand can enable & disable subtitles whether it is muxed or in srt. I think we should encourage people to use VLC to play mkv and then spread awareness of the option to enable/disable subtitles simply by pressing V on the keyboard. I think you can include this tip in the description/summary of the torrent as well as in the info text file that is included as part of the download."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-04-28T09:41Z,"Another Good Player that can be used is GOM Player
It is one of the most user friendly & feature rich Player I have come across
One can Do a load of things with it
Disable/enable subs
Manually sync the subs, audio
Sharpening & smoothening of Video 
& many such features

Also install codec packs & update it regurarly
K Lite & Combined Community Codec Packs are 2 of the most Popular packs "
[V],MKVGuy,2010-04-28T19:56Z,"@altemeldo, yes awareness is the only thing.. like the idea of adding tips in description..

@RiddlerA, thanks for your inputs to increase the awareness among the newbies.."
