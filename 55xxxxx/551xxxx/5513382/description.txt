Marina & The Diamonds - BBC Live Lounge 2010 (2 songs)

The lovely Marina & The Diamonds came into the Live Lounge and performed her single I Am Not A Robot, plus a breathtaking version of 3Oh!3 - Starstrukk.

She talked to Fearne about:
Reading all her own fan mail which she replies to personally.
She does about 20 letters a week auditioning for Lion King the Musical a few years ago, which didnâ€™t go very well as she is not ballet trained, but does have a great roar.

Today she rehearsed wearing an eye mask (with eyes drawn on it) so she didn't get distracted. She also thought her dress today made her look like sweet corn.
