,alex19589,2010-04-27T15:02Z,"Ok i've played it and for those who want to know:
1-The game is in russian and/or english.You can change it easy from the rev file
2-There is a sound like when you tune a radio that you hear randomly and especially when there is a fire but not that bad
3-Sometimes the game will crash while loading a map but it's rare
4-The game has a custom installer

Overall a great release. Thank you!"
,GreyHaven1,2010-04-28T02:03Z,This can't be the game... The file is too small... or is it?

,alex19589,2010-04-29T11:40Z,if you have no sound just type in console snd_rebuildaudiocache or something like that.
,Verkil,2010-04-29T15:47Z,What version is this? 2.0.1.4? How often did it crash with you? I have 2 copies of L4D2 (3GB & 4GB) and it does not crash unless you spawn a Witch while playing The Passing which is a known bug by the developer. I'm considering replacing them with this one to save space but I'm having second thoughts because of the crash you mentioned.

all you need to do is go to the folder where you have installed the game files.. look for rev file.. right click it go to the properties an' security edit permissions for users,click on full control and apply then ok it.. change the language in rev.ini save it.. then change the settings security settings back to normal e.i. properties-->security-->change permission-->read and execute and read only for users. then register the game with English reg. file.. an' you're done!!.. :) I still need to know how to play single player game.. :("

Does anyone know how to fix the Add-On issue, that is, The Passing level? I seem to crash whenever I try to load that level up within the main menu, and what's more, it's not listed in the Map list of the game's console, and not in the RevLauncher as well.

If anyone has any pointers or guidelines/suggestions as to how to fix this issue, it's much appreciated.

,gr3g0s,2010-08-06T01:15Z,"Dl and install sweet, but theres no ingame sound, i notice in console that the files being called are .wav but all the corresponding files are .ogg
Are these supposed to convert as part of the installer or is there a separate script that needs to be run.
I have win7 (64) is this  an issue??"
,gr3g0s,2010-08-06T02:03Z,"Eureka.
Win 7  users, heres how to get sound, well its what i did anyway.
During install, change permissions on the l4d folder, allow users full control and apply to subfolders and files.
Also clear the read only attribute from that folder.
Right click on the oggdec file and set compatibility to run in Xp mode and as administrator.
The best time for this is between phase 1 and two (whilst DX is installing).
You know its working by looking in the sound folders and if you see wav files you will have sound.
YAY"

,mrpirater,2011-05-11T03:46Z,"man was this game a pain in the ass to install. 

Ok, so for Win 7 64 bit, to get sound, 

after you mount the game, don't automatically start the install, go to the DVD and make the security for the setup.exe for administrator, run in Win XP SP2, and run as administrator, uncheck read only. 

I dont know if this is exactly necessary but it's what i did. 

Now, run the setup and let it extract.

WHILE it is exacting, i did this around 50%, you can probably do it a little earlier, go to the install folder,

c/programfiles(x86)/left 4 dead 2

(contd)"
,mrpirater,2011-05-11T03:47Z,"(contd)

go to the properties, and do the same thing as above and make sure it's administrator and asks you to apply it to the other folders. 

OK, if you did it right, then in the sound folders you should see the .ogg files AND the .wav, and eventually the .ogg will disappear. 

for English, copy the rev.ini to your desktop, open with notepad, change Russian to English, copy and replace it back into the install folder, then double click the Englishreg. file and let it change the registry. hew

(contd)"
,mrpirater,2011-05-11T03:48Z,"Also, don't panic while it Recomp (recompiles), it isnt frozen.  it stops at around 20, then 70, then 90, then 99, then for about a minute 100. it took me about 15 minutes, just dont mess with it. 

if you want the game just for the Passing, to get the golf club and M60, it's not worth it. id recommend just getting this release:

btjunkie(.)org/torrent/Left-4-Dead-2-Extract-Patch-and-Play

theres no Passing but there's no hassle and it never freezes, and this one does sometimes even on low settings, and there are periodic sound issues. 

peace out. "
