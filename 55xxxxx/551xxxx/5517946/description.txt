"CHUCK VERSUS THE HONEYMOONERS"

While in Europe, Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski) and Chuck
(Zachary Levi) realize they're traveling on a train
with Spanish spies. Even though they're all alone,
they decide to take on these rogue agents. Of
course, this impromptu mission doesn't go smoothly.
Meanwhile, Beckman (Bonita Friedericy) orders her
newest "unlikely" spy team - John Casey (Adam
Baldwin) and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) - to track
down the missing couple.
