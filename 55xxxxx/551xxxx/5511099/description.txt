A young Arab man is sent to a French prison where he becomes a mafia kingpin.

Condemned to six years in prison, Malik El Djebena cannot read or write.

Arriving at the jail entirely alone, he appears younger and more fragile than the other convicts. 

He is 19 years old. Cornered by the leader of the Corsican gang who rules the prison, he is given a number of missions to carry out, toughening him up and gaining the gang leaders confidence in the process.

But Malik is brave and a fast learner, daring to secretly develop his own plans.
