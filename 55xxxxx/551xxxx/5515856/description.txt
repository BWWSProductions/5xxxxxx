"Brother's Keeper"

With Eddie's brother, Charlie, and his new boyfriend, 
Terence, coming to visit, Eddie isn't exactly 
looking forward to the weekend. Much to Eddie's 
surprise, though, he hits it off with Terence as they 
both opt to watch football over participating in the 
planned weekend activities. When Charlie breaks up 
with Terence, Joy sides with Charlie and ends up 
questioning her relationship with Eddie.

Enjoy :)
