no matter though all the santi releases look amazing on hdtvs !"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2010-04-26T13:29Z,I'm gonna' go ahead and try this but I have a bad feeling about it.  I play Xvid files on Xbox 360 and I've found that if the bitrates are very large than the files don't play well.  Every several minutes files like this stutter as the machine goes to load more data.  This happens on my 360 anyway.  I've been looking for a rip in the 1.6-1.8 gigs range because I think that would play well and would be of good quality.  But I haven't been able to find any in that range that sound as though they are a good rip of the retail DVD.  Everything has been too low or too high or uses a different kind of codec.  I think groups have been going a little crazy with this particular movie.  The bitrates do not need to be this high for a 480p rip.  While the typical 2 CD size for this particular movie might be a little low since it is nearly 3 hours long surely 1.6-1.8 gigs would do the job well.
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2010-04-26T18:22Z,"Well, the file looks great but just as I suspected it is stuttering in 360.  The bitrate is just too high.  MS claims that 360 can play Xvid files well up to 5 meg bitrates.  But they're full of it.  Really all it can play well is up to around 1,500 kbps bitrates."

AVI File is over 2GB = more or less hack, so thats maybe be why X360 has problems.

I don't understand why 480p rips are over 2GB
1.99GB should be enough and
if the avi file is over 2GB = MULTIPART (use gSpot to test) = Problems for many standalones.

Bigger than 2GB so to be compatibile with most STANDALONE DivX players - will need to be split with VirtualDubMod ( http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/virtualdubmod/VirtualDubMod_1_5_10_2_All_inclusive.zip )
1. Open movie file:
""File"", ""Open video file"" (or use Ctrl+O shortcut), then browse to dir with YOUR_MOVIE.avi (press NO if asked about MP3)
2. ""File"", Save as (or simply press F7)
Choose ""Segment output file"" and set to 2036MB (no more)
(If you want CD sized parts you can use 700MB value)
Put new name and/or directory !BEFORE clicking SAVE: CHANGE(Video)""Video mode"" to ""Direct stream copy""
Done in 1-2 minutes! "
,ashok1987,2010-04-30T15:05Z,is this real avatar movie or not? cos i have download 500 mb and played using vlc and it shows as wizards of the waverly place movie..pl confirm!!
,mobbdeepreppa,2010-05-06T00:18Z,"Take it from me, I've downloaded this file and played it back on my 42' 720p HDTV and the quality is excellent! Trust me, this is a good rip. :D"
,mobbdeepreppa,2010-05-06T00:51Z,"Also, believe it or not, I bought the actual Bluray/DVD Combo, and the quality of this BDRip surpasses DVD9 Retail! I'm dead serious! :|"
