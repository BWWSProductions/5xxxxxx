    Catherine and David, she a doctor, he a professor, are at first          
    glance the perfect couple. Happily married with a talented teenage       
    son, they appear to have an idyllic life. But when David misses a        
    flight and his surprise birthday party, Catherine's long simmering       
    suspicions rise to the surface. Suspecting infidelity, she decides to    
    hire an escort to seduce her husband and test his loyalty. Catherine     
    finds herself 'directing' Chloe's encounters with David, and Chloe's     
    end of the bargain is to report back, the descriptions becoming          
    increasingly graphic as the meetings multiply.
