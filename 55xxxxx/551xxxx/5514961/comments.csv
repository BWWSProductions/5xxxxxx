,dan567,2010-04-25T18:50Z,"k i downloading now but just a question, how come the file is so small? other peoples files are like 8gbs! oh well i will seed for time if its good file :)"
,zeletto,2010-04-25T21:47Z,"Awesome, thanks a lot Gipsy this is definitely better than all the 480p versions (with bigger sizes) I hope it picks up more seeds.
A/V 10/10 

good thing you didn't increase the bitrate so much as it gets a bit useless 720p resolution+ 1691 Kbps beats the hell out of 480p + 3000Kbps

Keep Up the good work"
,Live.com,2010-04-26T06:53Z,Hell yeah 720p version. What is the point of ripping a BR at 480p?
,bbigbenb,2010-04-26T12:50Z,"bigthanks
good torrent no rar and avi+srt and less than 2GB
yeah
can then watch on my DVD player ;-)
This rip is AWESOME"
,slats649,2010-04-26T14:45Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."
,stevejohnson016,2010-04-26T16:33Z,Good rip.
,raj140286,2010-04-27T12:30Z,im must say de best for the size
,whitefang_razorblade,2010-04-27T15:54Z,"It's not the best BDRip as compare to secretmyth or 3Li but it's understandable due the movie length but still being in a High Definition category doesn't mean the resolution is large and sacrifice the quality of the images. It's better for a small resolution but a crisp images. But if secretmyth was to rip this movie from bluray, the file would be averaging from 2.7 gig to 3.5, so this one is understandable.

Don't get offended if my comment is a bit rude but i'm just stating my opinion, and you might consider it the next time you rip a bluray.   

Thanks by the way, cheers.

I'm also downloading the BDRip from R2L [ChattChitto RG] and will compare from yours though his is 3.17 gigs but i won't bias."
,Gipsy_,2010-04-27T18:50Z,"Thanks for your opinion whitefang_razorblade, but this is not BDRip is BRRip. is a little different :). But thanks anyway :)"
,orey_pd,2010-04-28T22:43Z,"but i prefer 1280x720 pixel (BUT SIZE IS  1.2 GB) torrent :)

,JPSchwarz,2010-04-29T21:53Z,Hard coded Dutch subtitles!! The srt multisubs don't do a thing. Pity as the video quality is OK
,WhiteA9,2010-04-30T13:16Z,"Hardcoded Dutch subs???? Is this true Gipsy??
You should have put that type of info in your description if it's true."
,WhiteA9,2010-04-30T15:27Z,"Perfect Picture
No Hardcoded Subs

Excellent work Gipsy"
,dave0328,2010-04-30T23:01Z,"AC3 audio gives me Dolby Digital 5.1 with my WD TV Live - THANKS !!
Picture quality looks great.
Anyone have English Subs, just for the Na'vi parts ?"
,cclloyd,2010-05-01T02:40Z,Why arent the alien subs embedded into the file?
,incurro,2010-05-02T16:48Z,"To orey_pd
