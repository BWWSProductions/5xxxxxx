"CHUCK VERSUS THE HONEYMOONERS" 

While in Europe, Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski) and Chuck 
(Zachary Levi) realize they're traveling on a train 
with Spanish spies. Even though they're all alone, 
they decide to take on these rogue agents. Of 
course, this impromptu mission doesn't go smoothly. 
Meanwhile, Beckman (Bonita Friedericy) orders her 
newest "unlikely" spy team - John Casey (Adam 
Baldwin) and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) - to track 
down the missing couple.

Enjoy :)
