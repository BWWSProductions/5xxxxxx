Life has always been hard for Bangladesh women, long kept in physical and social purdah by the power of a backward-looking patriarchal system and the countryâ€™s endemic poverty. But at long last, they are now on the road to attaining their rights and achieving equality. As they travel, learning as they go, the women of Bangladesh, and the north-west in particular, have one illustrious role model from their own history to show them that women can, and must, advance and play a public role in society: Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain. She is the woman whose dreams are the dreams of all women today - education; human rights; freedom of movement; political recognition â€“ and whose life, thoughts, writings and actions are an inspiration.
