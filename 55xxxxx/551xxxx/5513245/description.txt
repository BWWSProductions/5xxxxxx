The Mule made its second border crossing of the Mighty High Tour under the cover of darkness. It started its second show in Canada with a thunderous roar. Mr. High & Mighty, Bad Little Doggie then the Zappa songs Pygmy Twylyte and Trouble Every Day. The first set pounded on, leading up to the appearance of the one and only Grace Potter for Honky Tonk Woman, to close out Set One. Set Two opened up with a soulful Child of The Earth making its way into Thelonius Beck. That's What Love Will Make You Do featuring the Guitar work of Scott Tournet from The Nocturnals (no Guitar smashing during the Mule set though). The set grooved to a close with Mighty High songs Reblow your Mind and I'm A Ram. Only thing left to do was come out for the encore and take off the rest of the roof with Ramblin' Gamblin' Man.
