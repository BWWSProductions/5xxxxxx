*********************************

Enjoy!

Set 1 version 2:
Updated the covers, cropped pages and fixed a few blemishes.

Set 8 is now available!

I am still putting together set 9-12.

I found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.
So, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,
then I can always copy and paste the english script 
into the italian comic.

Set 10 will have the fewest recent HQ comics, since
most of the comics were only reprinted in soft cover
graphic albums.  I have the WDSC graphic 
albums on hand, but I'm not willing to 
bend them all out of shape to scan.
Any suggestions?

Set 11: 

a. Barks Bear book
b. Unexpurgated Barks
c. Chronological DD by CB 
mkv videos
d. Pluto saves the ship
scanlation
e. Coo Coo # 01 magazine reprint

ii. Spirit of 43, etc.
c. articles 
i. Thomas Andrae, Michael Barrier, etc.
d. Final CB stories
e. Extras
i. Abbeville CB trilogy:
 (Abbeville has cropped CB's work too much and 
has made these comics incompatible for updating comics.)

iii. Authorized DD biograpy + CD of Barks interview
iv. maybe, US life and times


**********

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the un-cropped comics online.
Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent 
scans of wdc&s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.


The CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans 
than posted within this collection, then
please leave a message and post up your comic scans.

I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
