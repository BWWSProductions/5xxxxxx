It's bad cost cutting idea and disrespectful of CB's work.  Once, I get a legal paper size scanner, then  I'll do reconstruction of what these books were supposed to be like.  I'll use the the better CB comic scans for the stories along with a sample page comparison of original and abbeville style and a single abbeville style full CB comic from each hard cover comic to show how far wrong abbeville went."
