,OldboyVicious,2010-04-30T06:35Z,"I may be wrong, but I think to avoid oppressive law enforcement, some features such as uploading and sharing certain files are blocked form time to time when law-enforcement hackers are suspected of trying to get user data or upload tagged files, PB has to shut down the service in order to scan files, making sure nobody gets caught. It is the type of thing that if they warned about, the bloody coppers would pull out, re-group, and circumvent instead of being shut down. "
