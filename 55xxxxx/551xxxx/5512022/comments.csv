There have been some posts yesterday in Vampire Diaries and other torrents.

I want to make it ABSOLUTELY clear that these are aimed at a particular country in northern Eruope.
More details in post but:
1) This country has high-speed broadband to over 80% of population.

2) They, for whatever reason, are the worst leeching scum in the torrent uiniverse.

3) The posts were aimed at them (& others in similar situations).

4) The post s were NOT aimed at those in 2nd & 3rd (& some parts of 1st world) countries who do not have high-speed access.

4) I DON'T CARE what sort of package the scum, in point 2 above, get from their ISP. If you download then SEED!

5) Anyone who has a problem with any of what I said please take it up with me. I said it, not 20-40. In fact it has nothing to do with 20-40 EXCEPT that I am a huge fan and I can see people take advantage of him and his good nature.

6) You piss anyone off enoug h and they will evetually just go away and a LOT of people the world over would miss the work that 20-40 does. 

That's it.

Have a nice weekend.

Cheers
Jon"

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-24T09:39Z,"@Sattori: You know, Jon is here every day, not just here, but on my old site from early 2009.
He is, as I surely have said thousand times - frustrated, not just that - but puzzled, not just puzzled - but find disgusting things they are ""performed"" here.
He cannot, neither do I, see nor find ANY logic, ANY reason behind that - from the country which has highest standard in the world - and. for god's sake - have practically ""invented"" not just this site, but the whole ""movement"".

I am here for specific people. My files are - specific. My begging and instructions are well intended and - clear and specific.

Why in hell they have an urge to take a dump on the carpet in my living room is beyond me and any reasoning.

Jon has very observing mind and he has done what mute majority of the people who load my torrents have ""missed"" to do - more often. If they have - this accumulated frustration and anger never would have time to build-up."
