This torrent contains all 24 episodes of Clannad in the english dubbed format.

At the time this torrent was released all 24 episodes had not been officially released. Some people found the unreleased episodes through URL manipulation and released them online. I gathered all of the episodes I could find and put them here into this torrent.

Note about the quality: They are webrips taken directly from TheAnimeNetwork's website. The DVD boxset has been released, expect to see a high quality release posted soon (not by me!).

Buy the DVD boxset so the 2nd season gets dubbed! It was released on June 15th: http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/dIccelKDresJnYBWYN/browse/item/87167/4/0/0
