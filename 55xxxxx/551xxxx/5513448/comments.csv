,Silence_Rahel,2010-05-04T07:33Z,"If you are thinking about getting this, think very carefully. English dub for clannad is HORRIBLE I could not believe it, like 4 of the main characters are complete newbies who have never voiced anything at all. Be warned it is alot better in japanese."

I have not seen the subbed version but I thought the dub was rather good. Of course you probably feel it isn't good since you're used to hearing the original voices, which is understandable. But someone who hasn't seen it before isn't going to know the difference and as such they won't mind hearing the english voices."
,Silence_Rahel,2010-05-07T14:56Z,"@thenextday your right, if you watch english dub first you can get used to it like nothing but if you've watched subbed version through 3 or 4 times you will hate the dubbed."

I've gone through all of clannad and after story, and fully completed the VN with full voice, so the japanese voices are hard-coded into me.
And though it is true that this english dub could have been a lot better, I know that if you go into it with the right mindset, you will be able to go through Clannad again with a slightly different perspective, due to the slight changes in the script, and the different sounds of all the voices.

It is understandable to doubt a strange dub.

But being unable to like the dub of a show you love is the same as being unable to sense the love put into it.

Aren't you, perhaps, feeling lonely?

Can you not feel the feelings of all those whom could love this dub?

Are you able to laugh freely at things that first made you cringe, but eventually made you happy!?

if so, then you must be loved. Please keep living and trying to accept what is strange to you, so that love doesn't go away."

You are very interesting, those words have a lovely purpose to those who are not ignorant of it's meaning."
,Omocho,2011-02-21T06:47Z,"Old comments but, English dub is perfectly fine.
Only raging weeaboos who hate the english language ever bother to hate on dubs.
Sorry japanophile, but the dub is good."

That is very interesting."

That is very interesting.
Even more than that ""I Know Life""-Philosophy the guy above you was trying to spew out."

Your entitled to your opinion, but as I said thats your opinion don't deprive others of something they may like because you didn't. But anyway Clannad is the BEST anime ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
,Eternal_,2012-01-30T22:38Z,"After the whole SOPA fiasco and the ACTA one to come, a lot of video players have removed their links to anume like this, so I was glad I could come by the reliable pirate bay and pick this up. Thanks for the upload, I will be sure to seed. :D"
,thaumielchokmah,2012-04-12T09:40Z,"first of all very good anime. the dub was actually not bad considering that most dubs have some really shitty acting. Caution to those who've never seen this before: episode 22 is the official end of the season, 23 is an extra. episode 24 is an OVA that is not at all in the story arc, i didnt know any of this and thought that that was really how the story ended and got extremely confused"
