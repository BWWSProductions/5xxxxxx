,analpenetration,2010-05-02T07:10Z,South Park has been shit since the late season 12s. 
,4finger,2010-05-02T08:37Z,"this episode is gold olympic for the worst  or most stupid episode in south park history , hope they will do better for next one .
hello from thailand"
,evilwizard,2010-05-02T12:01Z,"this episode is by far the biggest pile of retarded assbarf in the history of South Park.

this is bullshit, I want my money back !!!

- tha fuck !!"
,macavity81,2010-05-02T15:44Z,"True the Towelie skit wasn't much fun, but the summer camp part was hilarious. Shark rape!"
,Crazy Bastard,2010-05-02T23:48Z,"god i love south park :D

matt and tray, can you get a more controversial show from anyone else? ;D"
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2010-05-03T00:51Z,"i cant for the life of me see why a towel?? its a shite charactor,has no relevance whatsoever.Production values &  tv deadlines always mean a script will suffer,was better when it was 2 guys makin web toons etc,theres no NEED to make it funny no more-must say the facebook ep was bang on lol the amount of cretins who have time 2 tend to an imaginary farm,yet cant dig thier own garden!"
,AylaMM,2010-05-03T15:17Z,I agree... this episode was surprisingly boring. :S
,Rain_Killer,2010-05-08T14:09Z,No new episode this week?
,ozzula,2010-05-08T16:43Z,"Why there is no new episode this week ?????
NEED SOUTH PARK!!!!!!!!!"
,johnnymccracken,2010-05-10T09:08Z,Watch out! I think somebody is watching this torrent... maybe others. I downloaded this last week and I got an email from comcast saying blah blah copyright infringement blah abuse incident # and evidenciary information blah... Didn't think anyone would come after me for downloading a tv show. :( Has anyone else had the same experience?
,AlkalinAddict,2010-05-11T08:57Z,idk what everyone is crying about... towelie in an episode of intervention was genious! they could practically make episodes of intervention by themselves...
,Zambini845,2010-05-11T20:01Z,I too got a notification from Comcrap. Seems like we have a spy on this tracker.....
,imthedave,2010-05-12T05:03Z,Definitely check that the torrent was added by eztv.  I didn't check earlier and I downloaded a fake.  Teh suck.
,imthedave,2010-05-12T07:28Z,"I don't know if my last comment actually got posted or not but just in case, I was wrong.  This is exactly what it claims to be, I was just having a major brain fart."
,ws0007351,2010-05-13T00:48Z,"Just to inform everyone, i just received an email from my ISP telling me i downloaded this illegaly. For this one and the ""You Have 0 Friends"" episode.

Both were upped by FQM, im too new to this to know if its related. But Comedy Central is aware of all the IPs of those who dwl this..."
,Richux,2010-05-25T19:06Z,When will they release the next episode?
,pwnerofall100,2010-05-26T03:34Z,this episode sucked
,Laith_88,2010-06-05T03:11Z,This isn't comedy. None of it was funny. Did Parker & Stone do such a lame episode on purpose? Towelie was kind of funny in that one episode but this one just killed him.
,nickalus3336,2010-07-29T01:06Z,i downloaded this and got copyright infringement warning
