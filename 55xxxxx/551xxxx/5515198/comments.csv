Let me know if I should care, and I'll start seeding, but I think it's already at 10 seeds so should be fine.. Hope the app works for everyone :)"
,mrpras,2010-04-25T20:28Z,"Oh, also it's only the core CD program."

,trevevs,2011-01-07T00:48Z,"On top on the virus- this doesnt work on Win7 x64- just crashes on launch.
cheers"
,SM_Boda,2011-02-02T13:31Z,@trevevs my windows 7 x64 runs it no problems. it's just some error on your windows.
,someone else,2011-03-26T22:46Z,"This works perfectly.
However, it will not run if put under the Program Files/Program Files (X86) (Win 7 64-bit)... does not help setting permissions (at least not for me)
But, put in any other folder it works perfectly.
Thanks!!!"
