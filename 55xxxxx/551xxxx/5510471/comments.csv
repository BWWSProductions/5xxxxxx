,deepeedark,2010-04-23T18:14Z,Whats the A-V peeps
,mattyg05,2010-04-23T19:27Z,I have been waiting weeks for a half decent copy of this. Its the first 1 I have seen that isn't a CAM. TvTeam are usually a reliable bunch. I will let you know the quality once it is finished downloading and continue to seed. Now all i need is a good upload of the new Nanny McPhee film to keep the kids quiet.

Dude learn a little about the scene before you post stupid shit like this tvteam just uploaded this torrent it was created by the scene release team Imagine which is why its in the name"
,Dr_Science,2010-04-24T05:34Z,"@ mscollins

Are you seriously lashing out at someone for not knowing about where the download came from?  not everyone is a lonely loser with nothing else to do like you, some of us have a life, so we ask questions hoping to get answers that aren't from some smart ass piece of shit like yourself.  Or we post quality from past uploads of the uploader as a basis for probable quality.

And for the record no one has posted A/V quality yet so how about you comment on that instead of harping on people for not being as much of a nerd as you.

Sorry folks, I just hate uber-nerds like this."

,leetality,2010-04-24T09:26Z,"@ Dr_Science
One has to be a 'uber nerd' to use common sense and realize 'IMAGiNE' isn't a part of the title?

TvTeam puts the source's tag after the title for every upload they do."

,mattyg05,2010-04-24T17:39Z,"Thanx for your defense Dr Science. Most appreciated. Yes, I am still learning about the scene. And am grateful to whoever puts up worthwhile copies of films. In fact, eventually I want to upload titles myself.
Anyway back to the movie.

It took about 6 hours to download. Mustn't grumble."
,mattyg05,2010-04-24T17:47Z,"I did know that IMAGINE was not part of the title, but I was going on the fact it says uploaded by TV Team. 
As for mscollins, a bit of helpful advice would have been better than trying to belittle me for no knowing. You must have been learning once."
,mattyg05,2010-04-24T17:48Z,Am seeding for a week too.
,dsafjaly69,2010-04-24T20:07Z,"Great TS, thanks.
Was pleasantly surprised that ""Imagine"" didn't insert that gay fucking audio of their name into this release, at least I didn't catch it if they did.

Had a couple people walking in front of the screen but overall was a great copy for a TS.

Thought that this movie would be totally crap, but was really surprised by it. Definately worth the DL."

,whatever89,2010-04-25T14:47Z,"the added color helped, but the quality seems to get worse later on in the movie, and the sound goes out of sync. Great movie though. I've seen better cams, but it's free."

I must apologize for that, I had only skimmed through the odd moment here and there. Now I know better. 
Once again, sorry and thanx. Still one of the best copies out there I have seen so far."

yes you do have to be an uber nerd to know that.  of course ""IMAGINE"" is not a part of the title, but to instantly infer that ""IMAGINE"" is the team that did this fine work is not something that most people would do.  people on TPB name their stuff the stupidest things sometimes.

I've seen kids shows with ""Gayfag"" and ""cockrocket"" after their name here on TPB in years past... am I am guessing that was not the name of the upload team... I could be wrong though.  hell a couple of years ago I saw an episode of spongebob here on TPB that after you opened the folder the AVI itself was named ""Homoshow"".

I know what people are going to say, that in the description it says an Imagine Realease. and fine guys, I get it. I know whats going on.  I'm just trying to defend the learners and and newcomers to TPB.

so don't be like comic book guy and cut these people a break for asking a question that seems obvious to you, remember that there is no such thing as a stupid question if you don't know the answer.

so lets hear all the the witty retorts from the peanut gallery now........"
,Dr_Science,2010-04-25T20:29Z,P.S.  I myself am a nerd.  I know all about how TvTeam's uploads work.  For the record I just want people to ease of the newcomers or people asking basic questions.
,ForAnAngel,2010-04-25T22:29Z,"same exact quality as this one

but twice as big? What's the point?"
,BSTONE26,2010-04-26T09:35Z,I DOWNLOADED THIS COPY AND ITS NOT TO BAD FOR A CAM BUT ITS STILL A CAM. WE REALLY NEED A BETTER COPY. THANKS

Get off your damn soapbox. No one cares."
,Dr_Science,2010-04-26T14:23Z,"it's good to see that Demosthenes928 could stop giving handjobs at the truck stop long enough to write a comment. Thanks dude, but how will you be able to afford mac and cheese for your five kids now?

no need for a response, this movie sucked and I will not be checking this board again.

,Demosthenes928,2010-04-27T00:16Z,"Somehow, your immediate response makes me think you have no life just to crawl through TPB for comments to rage at. Which also makes me doubt this is the last time we're going to have to put up with you.

Get off the internet you noob, don't get all butthurt just because everyone isn't nice to you."
,EvilPeach,2010-04-27T08:05Z,wait a second....Dr. Science is a nerd?
,ExhamPriory,2010-04-27T20:35Z,"I have to agree with Dr_Science.
at some point everyone has been new to this. and had to learn either with ease or with difficulty. I think it is especially important to be good to new people on TPB otherwise they won't give a shit about anyone either and slowly more and more users will JUST STOP SEEDING COMPLETELY. Give people a reason to want to seed and contribute so all our downloads can be faster"
,rimz69,2010-04-28T04:42Z,"lionsgate films tracked that i had this and was seeding it, just a warning to all, dont know if i was already on a watchlist or not, but this one is being watched"
,wire555,2010-04-30T07:52Z,agree with Dr. science but arguing on the internet is like running in the special Olympics even if you win your still retarded!!!! but if u have to be a smart alec then stfu and step out in to the sunshine jack tards
,jpjmoffett,2010-05-02T22:28Z,"Great torrent, TvTeam. Great picture/sound quality. Funny film. Thanks."
