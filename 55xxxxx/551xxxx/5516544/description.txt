    Simon Reeve continues his epic journey around the world    
    following the tropic of Cancer, the northern border of    
    the tropics region.                                      
                                                              
    The last leg of Simon's journey begins in the jungles      
    of Southeast Asia and ends in the tropical paradise of    
    Hawaii.                                                  
                                                              
    Prevented from following the tropic through China by       
    the Chinese government, Simon instead discovers the       
    increasing Chinese influences in neighbouring Laos and   
    Vietnam. And in Laos, he samples some local delicacies    
    - roast squirrel (or is it rat?) and caterpillars. In      
    Vietnam, he discovers cruelly caged moon bears, farmed    
    for their bile, which is used in traditional medicines.  
                                                              
    Next stop is Taiwan, and in the Tropic of Cancer           
    primary school he meets some of the world's highest       
    achieving children.                                      
                                                              
    The journey around the world ends in Hawaii - a            
    tropical paradise blighted by environmental problems,     
    including some of the dirtiest beaches on the planet.
