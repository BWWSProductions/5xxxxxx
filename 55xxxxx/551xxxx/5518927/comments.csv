,Donijs,2010-05-01T11:49Z,"Game good but much peers and less seeds, maybe those hwo wants to download this game should wait until there is more seeders and those hwo have alredy downloaded it should SEED it."
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-05-03T01:46Z,i will add another 100kbs upload to this torrent for one night and if all of you that download just give 10kbs each for a few days the seeds would fly up if all of you limited your upload speeds and take the piss you will just wait longer to get it sharing means u get it and u share it if u wont share dont download

,Yenrock7,2010-06-04T05:37Z,"How can you save in this game? It has saving problems according to Patch 1.1 and yet i cannot patch it because it cannot be detected in the system because it was not installed in the first placed.

How can i possibly finish this game when everytime i start it, i have to play from the very beginning all over again."
,Yenrock7,2010-06-04T05:59Z,"Nevermind my recent comments, i've found the reason why i can't save."

,MaxMouseG,2010-06-20T09:02Z,"Strange My dads computer doesn't say its a virus eh  Must be a failed scan or something...



Game is awesome. CRAZY ACTION. GAME IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WATCHED ALL THE MOVIES. IF you haven't watch the movies then fuck off. but the creators should be shot for the ending game music... I can't believe they even played that song ..."

,BluntmanX,2010-09-11T01:25Z,Flawless. Runs perfectly on my computer. Using Windows 7 64-bit Home Edition. Scanned with Avast! and it is CLEAN. I never played this game and it was worth a play for sure for a matrix fan like myself. Ending was kind of stupid though..
,oacer,2010-09-15T21:51Z,"@djDEVASTATE

You said ""i would rather stick to uploading older games"" 
I love all the games that you have uploaded but most of them are ISO and honestly i hate iso and there a waste of time. I would really appreciate it if you could do some RIPS of some older games you have. Thanks"

Move all the files from the game folder into my documents.

Then play not sure if this well work for every 1 but it worked for me.Spent 2 hours trying to get this to work and it was the oluy way it would work for me.

Hope this helped good lack and do not listen to ranaka he or she most likely could not get it to work and is trolling."
,godseed223,2011-10-11T05:49Z,O 1 more thing forgot to add this.Make sure you move EAX4Unified_redist_4001 outside the game folder it comes in then click and instill it.

,acex1991,2012-03-08T15:16Z,Can this work on 96mb graphics card?
,EricEden,2012-03-18T19:57Z,"Unfortunatly, this does not work.

And you can take it from me.

First off there is no reason to create a torrent with a virus in it - even if it is a false positive which it appears to be - secondly the format in which this is presented is incorrect. 

If you use Process Monitor you can clearly see why it fails.

Even though I thank the uploader for his/her efforts, I would strongly suggest to adhere to the standards with regards to fine pirated software in that he/she creates an ISO of the original content with a NOCD crack in a separate directory which, after installation of the software, can be installed by the end-user.

Stay away from this one - not worth the effort.

There is still another torrent available in MDF format which you can get and that one should work fine after applying patch 1.2 and the NOCD fix by deviant. Both can be download via http. 

The other torrent is:

,sajrocks,2012-04-21T13:36Z,rocking game
,0rochimaru,2012-04-27T11:20Z,"Works in Win7... HOWEVER:

- NO ENGLISH TEXT (*it's removed from the language files and replaced with Cyrillic text)
- US/EU save WILL NOT WORK with this version (*they appear in-game but crash upon loading)

Solutions for language files:

Download a version of the game that works (or not) but has the Eng language files then copy over the English files in this torrent."
,0rochimaru,2012-04-27T11:23Z,"Alternatively, d/l the ""2GB"" (*won't let me post url) audio-less version (*needs Warez registration) and swap this torrent's SOUND FILES (*and it's .EXE, as it reports a virus in the other one) to the Warez version.

The latter is what I did and it works A-OK.  GamesCopyWorld saves/ulockers work with this method also. ..albeit a 5GB d/l all up."
,0rochimaru,2012-04-28T12:07Z,"Bonus info:

If you're having issues with gamepad configurations, it's because the game isn't dual analogue stick compatible AND because it auto-detects the gamepad.  This conspires to make controller assignments clash with the keyboard's.  Most noticeable with camera an gun controls.

Solution:
Only plug controller in _AFTER_ you launch the game.  This will mean the game does not recognise the gamepad; in turn allowing for Xpadder (or the like) gamepad inputs without out the clash."
,Ricky118118,2012-06-01T18:49Z,"I can tell you all this DOES work!!!

I am running on a AMD Athlon II X2 P340 on win7.

I have a ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 Graphics Card and a 500gb HDD with 4 GB Ram. (Laptop)

This torrent works perfectly. All the talk of a virus is nonsense. 

also got upto 1m download speed :D 

Thanks a lot DEVASTATE!!!"

I scaned it with EsetNod32 Antivirus,

Scaned it with Maiwarebytes Anti-Malware, no virus...
So, its not a virus, its a crack that antivirus represents like virus.."
