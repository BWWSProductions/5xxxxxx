    Rainy summer evening... Young people are arriving at the new trendy      
    club named Phobos which is still under construction. Or                  
    re-construction - since it's a former bomb shelter which is              
    reconstructed to become a club. At first, the party sees nothing         
    wrong, but soon the bunker doors turn out to be locked, and the          
    teenagers get trapped underground without light and communication. At    
    first, all of them are joking and do not realize how dangerous their     
    situation is. Then they get frightened. All of them will need to cope    
    with their fears before the bunker will let them free.
