I don't know how to use the keygen, please help me."
,1340harley,2010-04-30T10:21Z,"Shut the fuck up!

Keygen works great.
To get the Installation code one needs to choose registration by phone.
Copy and paste installation code in keygen and then click activation code. 

Thanks to uploader! :-)"

,proloop,2010-05-05T06:20Z,"Works perfectly,keygen works like charm,thanx to the uploader!
Triple-check your keys in keygen.
STEP 1: Generate serial when asked!
STEP 2: After installation, run the app., choose activate now and phone corel...You will get INSTALLATION code there
STEP 3: Type INSTALLATION code in keygen, then generate ACTIVATION code in keygen. Type this ACTIVATION code in application, check ok or whatever.
STEP 4: ENJOY AND CUT THE CRAP!"
,Papaoso42,2010-05-09T07:14Z,"Downloaded it, used key gen, everything works great! If you don't know how yo use cracked software then maybe you should be buying the retail version in the store but don't make shitty comments about the person who is hosting the torrent. If you download something for free and it doesn't work for you then maybe you could thank the person who hosted the torrent and go on with your merry life. There is no need to be insulting seeing as how you didn't pay for the software to begin with. Kudos ABScbn, works great for me!"
,smilisav,2010-06-10T13:32Z,"Works for me.

When you generate Serial, keep Keygen open and DO NOT CHANGE Serial in KeyGen.

When you finish install and select ""by Phone"", type Installation code to Keygen WITHOUT DASHES.

After ""Activation"" in Keygen, you can select and use Ctrl+C to copy, and in Corel window Ctrl+V to paste.

Again: works perfectly for me."

,tequila88,2010-12-25T01:02Z,"OK, this is the first time I have ever had trouble getting something to work from something most other people don't have any trouble.

Using the Keygen, 
I generated a serial # and used it during installation.
Corel then gave me an Installation Code.
I entered that code into the Keygen and clicked Activation Code.
I was then given an error by the Keygen saying ""Not a valid installation code"".
I verified the SN & code several times with no luck.

I have since quit & restarted the Keygen. Now I can't even enter the S/N I used during the install into the KeyGen.

Can some please help? Thanks."

,nvr8nuf,2011-05-17T04:12Z,WHY DOES THE KEYGEN DISAPPEAR BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER INSTAL CODE?
