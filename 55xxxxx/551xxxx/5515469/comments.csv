,stanleyopar2000,2011-07-16T17:43Z,"I know this is a almost dead torrent but...oh wow...if someone could please seed this for JUST a little bit longer!!..CBN removed all traces of this on the entire web but here..so it looks like to them it's all about money and not saving the souls that possibly don't feel like buying their product. If I can't get it here..then it will be gone forever from the internet D: I'm at 53.8% .. My childhood was filled with this TV show years and years ago..

Thank you so much!!"
