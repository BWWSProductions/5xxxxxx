They were all originally on VHS, so the quality isn't amazing, but there is a noticeable difference between Season 1, Episodes 13 - 26 and the rest. It's not terrible, but the rest look much the same and are better quality. I will do my best to get VCD or DVD copies of these episodes, but no promises. I hope you all enjoy this collection! God bless!
