,DeSeguio,2010-04-24T05:23Z,Thanks eztv ....
,piratebaysux,2010-04-24T05:28Z,"Thanks EZ, Shame about that tosser using your good name to post crap.

What is it about this show? Been watching it hoping it might get better but it just gets worse and worse. Cannot seem to connect with or find anything to like about any of the characters."
,CyberGRIM,2010-04-24T05:40Z,Thanks! :)
,av1965,2010-04-24T06:39Z,tenks
,Sattori,2010-04-24T09:15Z,Thanks!!! So far this show is great. Don't know what's boring here jahnee. This series is simply just more about people and relationships than nonstop action. So it's quite different than Stargate or Stargate Atlantis (which I also enjoyed).
,Renown(S),2010-04-24T09:33Z,thanks for the speedy upload.
,Flipped337,2010-04-24T11:28Z,"I think that they've done a damn good job with this show,i mean its gotta be differcult trying to stay away from the star trek/star wars cli'ches. Eztv are awesome, im a brit so if i didnt dl good knows when i'd see these u.s. shows. Thanks so much :)"
,Deus3xMachina,2010-04-24T12:19Z,"This show is not bad.  Sure it often feels like a cheap knock off of the camera shots and atmosphere of BSG, but even at a tenth of BSG's levels, its still up there with such wonderful times as coming home from the pub drunk and beating up your wife:)"
,Deus3xMachina,2010-04-24T12:20Z,"@Flipped 337 SGU is on british SCIFI channel one episode behind the Americans, thus if you want to pay for it, you can get it, much like the pussy."
,Morfieus,2010-04-24T13:34Z,"Thanks again !
Great uploads from great series!"
,csabaxb,2010-04-24T19:13Z,11/12/13/14 it's better than first 10 episod. Thanks Uploader.
,corbou,2010-04-24T22:34Z,@Flipped. In Norway they airs just fine. Why is Britain any different=P
,SEoF,2010-04-25T00:57Z,"I too am a Brit, and the choices of £30 a month for the extra channels, with specific timing, or £40 a month and one off £200 to watch when I want, are both a rip off.

We really only have 5 free channels (the others tend to be repeats of stuff from these five, and little else worth watching).  These 5 channels cater for kids documentaries, soaps, main sports, politics, and the oldies: very little for those of us into anything else in the age ranges in between.  The BBC (owner of two of these channels, paid for by all TV owners and free of ads) have recently been told they have to change who they are catering for, but lets face it: British TV sucks.

Thanks to the EZTV group.  Without you I'd probably not have a TV."
,Terratari,2010-04-25T11:09Z,"@SEoF
""Brit TV sucks"" ...
I happend to grow up in Germany and this sucks up where the lights won´t shine... Talk Shows for "
,Pleidian,2010-04-25T11:57Z,"This show is very odd indeed, especially stylistically. What are they going for?"
,gld77,2010-04-25T12:02Z,"i'm a brit also you can watch this on sky 1 a few days after it airs in the states, sky is just like cable "
,xniggler,2010-04-25T16:07Z,worst show ever...don't download...
,kingturd007,2010-04-25T18:38Z,"Id have to agree with piratebaysux.. even though his name sucks.. 

Something about this show inspires the nerds in us.. but good god damn, this show is slow... but still lures us in.  I tend to watch this show drunk, which makes it more entertaining. 

Thanks again EZTV.   Your uploads surpass others regarding Television rips.  

aXXo and EZTV are the men when it comes to great quality torrents"
,pimpmobile,2010-04-25T20:22Z,"this isn't a sci fi show its a fucking drama even their space battle scenes were lame the ships didn't even fly around they just sat in one spot and shot, this show is for losers who have feelings!  Stargate was better when it was sg1 or atlantis atleast then there was action."
,idrone42,2010-04-25T23:01Z,"If you like this show, you are an descendant of the people Hitler gathered together and put to death in his gas-mobiles touring Germany long before he got around to building camps for jews, gays and gypsies. They were so retarded that no one needed convincing to follow orders to round them up and massacre them. People just went ""oh, why didn't we think of that before"". 

This show is retarded on so many levels there's no way to begin to describe it, it's impossibly. If you like it, you should die. The oxygen you use could've gone to birds and trees instead. People who are that fucking stupid, are usually also ugly. There's something that got fucked up so bad in their DNA that they look like complete screwballs. Something like Downs Syndrome, just worse. I bet the writers and the director got it, whatever it is. "
,geovidiu,2010-04-25T23:54Z,"What`s wrong with this show? I don`t seem to understand it! It`s getting worse...there is nothing going on.
I`m not against our social relationships and human interaction,but actually 80% of this show it is all about.
If I wanted to watch ""Friends"",""ER"",""or stuff like that OK,but I`M A SCIENCE FICTION FAN and if I watch this I want to see new worlds,alien races,their different(or similar) social structure,political and leadership systems,infrastructure and technology along with their mentality and culture ...etc.And not to forget a little touch of humour would be OK as well.
To cut the long story short,as a SF fan I regard myself as an explorer of new ""things"",not the human drama relations onboard a highly technological advanced ""Ancient"" spaceship,travelling through intergalactic space for eons."
,xniggler,2010-04-26T16:53Z,"boycott this shit
worst sci fi series ever

who ever writes the script is a fucking monkey"
,Sattori,2010-04-26T19:34Z,"@idrone42 
You are so sick in your mind that it hurts.
@xniggler
If you fucking hate this show so much go somewhere else and don't bother the rest of us.
@geovidiu
You know what Sci-Fi is basically about (among other things)? It's called tolerance, acceptance and impartiality."
