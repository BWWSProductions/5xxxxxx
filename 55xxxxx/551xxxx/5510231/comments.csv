,Mrbaggins1956,2010-04-25T07:56Z,I have doubts this is real as it wasn't uploaded by FXG.
,Powerfool,2010-05-04T04:51Z,"Good upload!

A - 9
V - 9"
,tomb_reaver,2010-05-12T05:44Z,Which uploads can you trust? I've been downloading from this site for a few months. I'll also come across posted comments about Axxo's uploads being fake since he's not around anymore. Does anyone know for sure if this upload is the real deal? Is FXG-Team reliable when it comes to downloading good-quality movies? Who's Vertex anyway... and are they a scamming motherfucker?
,Jake_Ace,2010-05-13T11:33Z,"It's real, I dunno if it's an actual FXG, but the audio and video qualities are much better than that MAXSPEED one.

Audio: 10
Video: 10"
,Fireholder,2010-05-15T02:07Z,"It may not be a genuine FXG, it may be an FXG re-release, but the fact remains, uploader has a skull/crossbones beside their name. The magenta logo means the uploader is a TRUSTED source. Take from that what you will. 
I'm dl'ing now, hope all goes well. :)"

good file, no problems other then the DL was HORRIBLE idk what it is but it would go at 1.5 mb then drop to 30 kb i had to keep starting and stopping the torrent.... i know it's not me because i DL stuff from here every day no problem. idk what it is but it sure was annoying. "
,Video_Veg,2010-05-16T09:53Z,"About the Torrent - good quality and speed A & V=9; Thanks all seeders and  FXG/agentpiratebay.
About the Movie - Basic blood, guts and ghouls type, mostly at night. The bulk of the show was bickering and much windy dialogue, not a keeper! 
I erased it right after; tedious to watch once, won'r watch it again."
,xion900,2010-05-17T00:15Z,If you are unsure if an axxo torrent is real just go to this website: http://94.75.224.58/ if its not here its not real
,Makusnake,2010-05-24T10:45Z,"if the moive is By : FXG Team, then it is all good. I have downloaded quite a few of their releases and they are all good. And most of these 'FREE' sites have always got a catch. Pirate bay is a bit hit and miss ometimes. once yu have found a good torrent provider on here, stick with them cause there are plenty of people on here just wasting people's time, like Skullpultra or what ever the fag's name is!!!!"
,jayman512,2010-06-03T09:59Z,"FYI this version is ALL ENGLISH from beginning to end. I was weary of downloading the other ones because people complained about there being Russian audio at the end. This ending was English, like the entire movie.

A - 8.5
V - 8.5

Thanks FXG!

,Wyden,2010-06-22T04:29Z,"Is this an actual rip of the actual DVD, or some kind of cam recording?

Also, how do you turn on subtitles?"
