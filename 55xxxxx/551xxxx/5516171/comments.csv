,mikexxxryan,2010-04-26T06:11Z,"Latest news reports on Brett Michaels:  still in critical condition, awake, speaking with slurred speach.  For those who don't know: he suffered a brain hemorrhage which could kill him.  He may not come out of this the same guy he was before the hemorrhage.  Best wishes Brett! "
