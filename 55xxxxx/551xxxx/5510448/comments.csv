,MitsEvX,2010-05-27T01:48Z,"Your welcome and thank you! :D I think we all have to do something in return, because for me, the share world is a treasure and with torrents like these, there are a lot of diamonds in it! :P

You're new here, because now they only allow content distribution torrents, am I right? ;-) That was a misery! Mininova also was a very good torrent site....

I wish you good luck with your next uploads! ;-)

P.S: I promised seeding this at 3:1, but it's stuck at 0,135:1 (doesn't happen that much)! I'll try seeding again from the beginning and else I'll seed at 3:1 on one of your other torrents, a promise is a promise.... ;-)
