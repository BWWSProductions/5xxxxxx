Release notes:

Following the worldwide success of their first three albums, the members of
Keane announce today the release date of Night Train to be released on
Cherrytree/Interscope Records in the U.S. on May 11. The band who has had three
consecutive #1 albums in their native UK and have played sold out shows
throughout the US will also soon announce tour dates in North America for this
coming Spring.

Night Train features eight powerful new tracks which were written and recorded
during the bandÃ†s Perfect Symmetry world tour that saw them playing to packed
arenas in 28 countries.
The album takes its title from the band's favorite mode of transportation during
the tour, and includes Keane's genre-busting collaborations with Somali/Canadian
rapper K'Naan, 'Stop For A Minute' and 'Looking Back'.

"I think these tracks show us in a completely different light." says Keane
frontman Tom Chaplin.

Other highlights include 'Ishin Denshin (You've Got To HelpYourself)', which
features Japanese MC Tigarah, as well as the gorgeous 'Your Love', which hangs
around a rare lead vocal from the band's Ivor Novello-winning songwriter Tim
Rice-Oxley.

Keane, who are Tom Chaplin, Richard Hughes, and Tim Rice-Oxley; together they
have sold close to 10 million albums copies of their albums Hopes And Fears
(2004), Under The Iron Sea (2006) and Perfect Symmetry (2008). They have played
sold-out arena tours, and were the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. With
songs such as Is It Any Wonder?, Everybody's Changing, Crystal Ball and
Somewhere Only We Know, Keane is one of Britain's best-loved bands and will
surprise and thrill their fans all over again.

Enjoy!
