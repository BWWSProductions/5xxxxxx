,Digital_Freedom,2010-04-26T06:15Z,"If you have not downloaded it, please do not dismiss it.  I stand behind my work 100%.  These are perfect files, you can download with confidence."
,mrt999,2010-04-29T08:10Z,Obvously its real from the numbers of seeders and leechers alone you should be able to tell
,Digital_Freedom,2010-04-30T04:04Z,"Thank you, mrt999 .   I've said it before, I love this show, and I think everyone should be able to watch it!"
,demon681628,2010-05-01T12:40Z,Thank you for posting this. Been looking for a long time. Works 100%. Keep up the good work. :D
,Psyk0,2010-05-04T20:35Z,"Thanks! but if this aint the real deal, i'll find out where you live and kick you in the nuts! :P"
,variously2,2010-05-09T10:56Z,"thanks for the rips, digital freedom, appreciate you putting work into this.  that aside, this show is becoming somewhat disappointing.  
*SPOILER rant*
season 1 was good, aside from the retardedly annoying family Walt has (if I wanted a family arguing over stupid shit like ""talking pillow"" i'd watch lifetime).  season 2 is alright, but I'm now at episode 4 and it's unbearably horrible.  Jesse still hasn't grown up very much, Walt leaves him to rot in his time of need, and Walt has regressed from standing up for himself to being used like a rag by his wife.  Not much dynamic character changes going on.  Even worse, this entire episode is about his fucking annoying bitch wife skyler, who i have no idea why he married.  Obviously he'd rather have that other chemistry girl not skyler the waitress.  Although he's not the best person for being out all hours, he has cancer and it's understandable he changes the way he acts.  Not only that, he just came back from a 3 day ordeal where he was missing and delirious.  Although this isn't completely true, skyler doesn't know any different and should care about him, yet she turns it around and makes it all about her pulling that selfish ""look i can do what you do too"" by going off and ignoring him.  thing is, he wasn't pretending, he actually either was feeling like shit or was doing things for the family.  and i have to say, seeing her ignore him and walk off while he's talking, and him not confronting her, is some of the most painful shit i have ever watched, not to mention unbelievable.  i'm no misogynist, but i fucking hate skyler and her long face and that prude, irritating shit that passes for a personality.  i don't want to watch this shit, the whole point is watching walt go away from that life and pushing his boundaries, not regress both in terms of personality and script.  what the fuck!  *hoping ep 5 improves...*"
,variously2,2010-05-09T11:01Z,"oh and i fucking hate Hank and how he treated Wendy.  i think skyler is more of a shit stain than wendy.  in terms of accomplishments skyler is no better, and at least wendy is personable and interesting. kthxdone"
,variously2,2010-05-09T13:07Z,"Alright, well at least the interpersonal drama is more interesting and less irritating.  However, are you sure this is uncensored?  Because in episode 6, when he says ""fuck you"" to Gretchen, the ""fuck"" sounds like ""fough"" and is definitely edited..."
,chilly123,2010-05-10T01:05Z,"Not sure what ""loonatick"" is smoking but this is a great rip of season 2.  Nice job Digital_Freedom, I'm really enjoying watching this show and just started working my way through the second season."
,Digital_Freedom,2010-05-10T05:21Z,"chilly 123, YW!   LOL @ variously2.... sounds like you are really getting into it!  I had thought that Walt's ""fuck"" to Gretchen sounded a little edited as well, but I'm pretty sure it was made to sound vengeful, as the rest of the expletives are not omitted, therefore UNCENSORED.  Hope you keep watching, season 3 is airing right now, and you'll definitely see changes in the characters!"
,01eg,2010-05-29T15:58Z,seed !!
,StarMatt,2010-06-02T02:01Z,Hi. As I'm foreign I need some (english) subs to watch this :p Do you know if subtitles for HDTV would work with these vids ?
,Hanks49,2010-06-09T02:32Z,"thanks for the on-point rips. h.264 quality and a wicked show.

info for other downloaders - subtitles will prolly show for chapter numbers but im sure most people will know to press hide/turn off subtitles or equivalent..."
,Mrwarburton,2010-06-14T21:35Z,"Digital Freedom. I've downloaded Season 1 from you. This fucktard Loonatick, i dunno where he gets off saying this stuff about your torrents. He did the same thing on Season 1. Everyone who reads this: You can with confidence download this Torrent and all of Digital Freedom's Torrents. Because everything he writes in the description, is True. Loonatick is just trying to fuck it up for Digital Freedom, and i dunno why. Love your Torrents Man."
,some_evil,2010-06-20T10:59Z,"So is this legit? Nobody has actually said it is not Fake?

And is it confirmed it IS censored?"
,pingu777,2010-06-21T23:43Z,fuck you loonatick. tnx Digital. cheers!
,harvey_weinstein,2010-07-07T06:11Z,This torrent works great. So far I have watched the full first episode and also the second. Video Quality 9 Audio 10. Really pretty much as good as it gets. Thanks for the torrent!
,spiritualiste,2010-07-22T00:34Z,"Digital,

,Published,2010-08-23T16:32Z,"Dude, hi. Thank you for the seaon 1 & 2. Any chance to see S 03 Uncensored course?"
,gfmickel,2010-09-04T03:35Z,Was also wondering if you were gonna upload the uncensored version of season 3?  The first two uncensored seasons that you uploaded were awesome!
,nin.54,2010-09-07T02:39Z,Digital Freedom....Looking forward for season 3 uncensored.....Thx Bro

,m_d_c_8989,2011-02-03T15:17Z,Yeah men! First two seasons are great in quality and sound. Can't wait for your 3rd season! :) Thanks!
,beawolf220,2011-02-13T16:28Z,"I downloaded and watched all episodes in this torrent (as I did for season 1). I verify that the torrent description is correct.

Quality of all episodes are same as in season 1 if you watched those which are in the torrent Digital_freedom gave. If I need to repeat, all episodes are in m4v container with MPEG-4 AVC video (720x480, 900 Kbps average) and two audio tracks with AAC (2 channels, 160 Kbps, 48 KHz) and AC-3 (6 channels, 448 Kbps, 48 KHz). "
,sadalf,2011-04-11T09:23Z,"Will you release season 3?

,wck,2011-07-02T14:25Z,Great stuff! These are excellent quality. It's not 720p but it's better than the usual 350mb eps everyone else is releasing. Definitely looking forward to your release of season 3.
,Fattur,2011-10-21T17:29Z,"So, which subtitles are compatible with that?
is this Breaking.Bad.S02.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS?"
,Fattur,2011-10-23T18:03Z,"I found the true subtitles for this.
Breaking.Bad.S02.720p.Bluray.x264-CLUE
This is fits."
,Rataec,2012-02-20T21:53Z,"BEST uploader For Breaking Bad , i have searched now for 20min. and i am good with google etc. nothing compared to this here , Uncesored, High quality  with reasonable size! and Seeders are awesome!
