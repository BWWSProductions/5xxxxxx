,deathtrooper30,2010-04-26T17:52Z,Does it have a crack?
,azothegreat,2010-04-26T17:53Z,it contains crack or not thenoobish.
,falytoro,2010-04-26T17:53Z,Is it real?
,Erghantar,2010-04-26T17:59Z,This is the same .iso as the one uploaded some time ago. It doesn't have a crack.
[T],despo1ler,2010-04-26T18:06Z,"ofc it's real, it's from a trusted uploader, as for a crack, I believe there is only a CLONEDVD release out which does not include a crack, for that you will have to wait for a group like SKIDROW or RAZOR1911 to write and release one."
,ThomasDollar,2010-04-26T18:11Z,"this ali213 gave us also the first working version of AC2 and Drakensang: RoT...

but this is obv just the iso, crack will be there soon i guess"
,cuteselene,2010-04-26T18:26Z,"^Nah skidrow don't have capacity to release crack for ubi games with new drm until and unless they steal values.db from others!!
check cs(.)rin(.)ru if you want crack!!"
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-26T18:26Z,is this the same as the ali213 episodes from liberty city with the crack from a earlier splinter cell game :)
,azothegreat,2010-04-26T18:44Z,It might me Mbb15 as it is a trusted uploader there might be a crack otherwise we will get itt soon by skidrow.
,kevinkrs,2010-04-26T19:11Z,Please seed
,svadilfari,2010-04-26T19:24Z,"You know what fuck you noobish, and all of you if you wanna play the game go the fuck buy it! You are all ruining the game companies! They, like banks will soon have to be bailed out!!

juuust kiddin' haha, thanks for the upload noob"
[T],thenoobish,2010-04-26T19:38Z,"No it doesnt contain a crack, read the info! Dont you guys see the word CLONEDVD?"
,deathtrooper30,2010-04-26T19:55Z,"@svadilfari

,spycell,2010-04-26T20:10Z,"Im accualy gonna buy it, but my dvdroom is busted, so i download it so i dont have to buy a new dvdroom to play. :)

I'm also curious on the PC version tough.

,SteXDudE,2010-04-26T20:22Z,"I got only one problem with this game,i cant downloaded so seed... "
,SteXDudE,2010-04-26T20:28Z,OK dumb fucks i will wait for another torrent
[T],Knaster,2010-04-26T20:31Z,SteXDudE if you gonna call people dumbfucks over this then you're an idiot.

,Slikit,2010-04-27T04:37Z,"OMFG GUYS MEH FREE GAME INT DOWNLOADING FAST!!11! SEED JOO FUCERSS!11!

Do the couple of sentences above sound familiar? If so, you have just witnessed a internet user with an inflated sense of entitlement. Also known as fucktards, dumbasses and douchebags, the ISE thinks that if it can navigate it's way to a download page, it deserves said download at the speed of light.

Here is a personal message to any ISE who reads this:

You are not paying for this game. Every time you whine and bitch about how it isn't going fast enough, you make a part of my soul die. YOU DID NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME. It doesn't matter if it takes a day, a month or a year. If you want it instantly go shell out the cash.

I understand that your life is an empty and meaningless husk. Video games let you fill that gaping void of nothing for a few hours to stave of the thoughts of doing something useful with your life. The act of crying about the fact that you are not playing this game as soon as you want will only interest your mother and incite the rage of everyone else.

And honestly, she probably wants you to get out of her basement and find a job."
,deathtrooper30,2010-04-27T05:46Z,"""I understand that your life is an empty and meaningless husk.""

That one sentence actually pertains to about 95% of all human beings. U see it everyday and everywhere! "

""Im waitin fo a cack"" :D"
,Arda9867,2010-04-27T11:41Z,Yeah life is pretty shit :D
,dlight24,2010-04-27T12:27Z,"No, that crack is fake!

Big trojan horse :("
,xtracrossxx,2010-04-27T13:20Z,hey guys this is same as the one uploaded earlier rite from blackzubu???
,sizons,2010-04-27T13:56Z,pls crack. razors is fake

,Arda9867,2010-04-27T14:35Z,"I wait for dormine, screw razor damn it"
,dlight24,2010-04-27T14:41Z,razor wanted!
,.BlackIce,2010-04-27T15:34Z,"First off for all you noobs, that is not Razor1911's crack, it's just some kid with no life who wants to try and ruin as many computers as possible.  Secondly, there are NO CRACKS AVAILABLE AS OF TODAY.  The reason being, the game isn't even released yet, and values need to be configured before we can get a crack made.  So, in the mean time, continue to seed, and tomorrow or Thursday a crack will be ready.  You won't die if you wait a couple days."
,Godalamatieta,2010-04-27T16:31Z,I think the crack is coming soon. Razor just cracked ubisoft's settlers 7 with drm so splinter cell will be cracked in some time I hope
,angus2,2010-04-27T17:35Z,IT WILL TOOK A MONTH TO MAKE A PROPER CRACK SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT. 
,faithfan,2010-04-27T18:45Z,when the values come out it will be http://cs[dot]rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=56105 here at first
,Danishaslam,2010-04-27T21:08Z,"you noobs are fucking crazy , can't you wait for FUCKING CRACK OR VALUES.. :@"
,spycell,2010-04-28T13:01Z,"Downloaded it from demonoid, took 2 days, omg.

Just waiting to buy it now, can't wait! :D
""one day son, this will all be yours""^^"
,Az4z3l11,2010-04-28T14:21Z,"I might take some time to crack this like AC2. Only thing to do though is to make proper values, because Server emulator 0.44 is offline, and i think it works with this game too."
,0zgurd,2010-04-28T14:44Z,"i have got this to work as far as the main menu

just on problem i get message game lost connection resume trying to get past that bit then

,faithfan,2010-04-28T17:11Z,NO!!! EMULATOR FROM AC2 DONT WORK WITH THIS GAME WE HAVE TO MAKE A NEW ONE GUYS SO EXPECT ONE IN MONTH OR TWO>>>HAVE A NICE DAY
,xtracrossxx,2010-04-28T19:46Z,nope its going to come ut earlier this tym cuz now the crackers know whta to do  and dormine just has to gte the values so im guesin a week at most!!!!
,Eniedoc,2010-04-29T04:42Z,Just wait people... and a big thanks to all the ppl who made ac2 playable... ! hope scc have the same fate...!
,SirDestructo,2010-04-29T05:29Z,"It'll probably be done between a week and a month. With AC2 it took a while for all the values to be logged, but since this game is a lot shorter and not nearly as open ended (i.e. no sandbox) it won't take as long. Also, hopefully the emulator will be easier to get up and running, with experience making the last one. My guess is 2 weeks for the dormine emulator to work. Maybe less for a scene release if they hunker down on it"
,chaosnipples,2010-04-29T18:20Z,I think this game is gonna be the first game I actually buy in like 3 years lol
,Likeadidas95,2010-04-29T22:09Z,it will be good if u guys seed a lil' bit ! :)
,Likeadidas95,2010-04-29T22:09Z,it will be good if u guys seed a lil' bit !? :)
,xaxax,2010-04-30T05:36Z,"Don't buy games with gay drm, and spam the company with mails until they get the idea. They will NOT give a shit until their mail boxes, mail servers and wallets are feeling your wrath.

Same with loudness war affected music (99% of mainstream, and >50% of non-mainstream music ...) it all sounds like shit cause idiots don't know wtf clipping or dynamic range is and people still pay money for such trash anyways..."
