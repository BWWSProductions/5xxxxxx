The book was printed by the publishing house Shan Wu in Shanghai. 



"...If you are in command of this technique, you can sway the destiny of the enemy. You can kill your enemy, cause unbearable pain, tear his muscles and sinews, break his bones or make him unconscious for some time and completely disable him to resist. Even a woman or a physically weak man who mastered this technique can curb a strong enemy. This technique demands deftness and skill, not brute force. It is necessary to train oneself daily to make the body flexible and nimble, but "hardness" must be hidden inside this 'softness.' "



@artpepper says: these are very serious and potentialy deadly techniques. They are NOT for fun or messing around with. Remember--it's usually a bad idea to maim or kill someone unless you actually mean to do it.
