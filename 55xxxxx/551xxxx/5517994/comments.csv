Oh,and in  My documents/settlers7

Anyone knows what can I do to fix this?"
,Nerdy666,2010-04-27T17:22Z,"@nooberoid

you should not update to 1.03 man..itll mess up the crack "

And now only thing that happens is little winwow loading,and loading,and loading,and loading,and thats it,no messages no nothig.

Damn ubisoft......."
,clintchan,2010-04-27T18:06Z,an internet connection to play the game? can anybody help? ive already updated the game and copy and the profiles.xml file. reply pls... 
,unrealdj,2010-04-27T19:36Z,"copy profiles? no, thats only for backup.
if your main objective is to play without worrying about previous things unlocked just delete the whole settlers 7 folder in documents. *Not the game folder...*
Thats what I did and loaded right up.

1. do a fresh install, you can NOT downpatch from 1.03 to 1.02....
2. Delete the settlers 7 *documents* folder, just to make sure there are no other settings interferring.
3. don't load the game with the ubilauncher, it will attempt to update to 1.03, launch the game with settlers7.exe in the game folder *after copy/pasting the cracked exe and data folder provieded here.

If it still doesn't load run as admin, if you get a crash after this then it is a problem with the game and your PC, you need to check the official game forums tech support.
More then likely your graphics card isn't good enough though."

That is a false positive! I assure you all my uploads are clean - so is this one!"
,clintchan,2010-04-28T04:17Z,"i think now i know why the game wont start for me.
1st coz my launcher is from ac2.

,yuna27,2010-05-02T20:21Z,"The way I got it to work was 

install the game.
unmount image and upgrade to v1.02
copy the exe file over the old file and then
I went into the razor Data folder, all the way to the last subfolder and copyd the 1911.dll and binkw32.dll files, copyd that into the similar folder in the games directory, leaving the rest of that Data folder untouched.

After that I went to the documents blabla folder and removed the profile.xml and it works just perfect.

Hope it helps."
