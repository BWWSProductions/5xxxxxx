Install Notes:

(tested on the 1.02 version of the game)

1. Extract RARs
2. Copy the whole content of Razor1911Crack to your game folder overwriting
any existing files.
Example: X:Program Files (x86)UbisoftThe Settlers 7 - Paths to a Kingdom
3. Make sure to back up and then delete any previous copies of
"My DocumentsSettlers7Profiles.xml"
4. Start the game (admin rights may be required the first time you run it)!
5. Have Fun!

Minor recurring freezes after every 10 min. of playing the game are due to a
faulty implementation of the autosave mechanism and are NOT crack-related.


GOOD BYE UBI DRM! :D
