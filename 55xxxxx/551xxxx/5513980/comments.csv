,ramachandra,2010-04-25T09:06Z,thanx... waiting for it from 3 months
,Frontline3920,2010-04-25T12:38Z,"@RH
Thanks! Been waiting for awhile and it works great on my PC... However, I have tried it on my laptop PC, and my wifes desktop PC and after installing the NTR, Norton immediately pops up and claims everything is turning off(Firewall, anti-virus/spy/etc, etc..), and when I open NIS, the dashboard is all greyed out and it has BIG X and says ""Subscription Required - If you do not subscribe now, your PC will remain unprotected. Purchasing a subscription is less than a minute.""

Just letting you know, but nonetheless... It works G-R-E-A-T on the PC I use most of the time. THANK YOU!!!! Keep up the good work."

Did you try running the NTR in Safe Mode?"
,Frontline3920,2010-04-26T00:41Z,"@RH

Hey, I tried it in safe mode on my machine that wasn't working with the NTR 2.9 last night and it works, HOWEVER- The NTR set the days to 120 days and the Norton Account pops up each time I open NIS."
,Frontline3920,2010-04-26T00:48Z,"@RH

Also my good man, do you know of anywhere I can find a direct download for NIS 17.6.0.32? Because every time I try NTR and fail, I have to uninstall, reinstall 17.5.0.127 and update to 17.6.0.32.

Just wondering, thanks a mighty lot.  :)"
,natyxxo,2010-04-29T18:16Z,"Doesn't work on my lappy.... tried everything, even installing it in safe mode... nothing works... :("
,donmano,2010-04-29T23:02Z,how many days registers it?
,accucore,2010-05-03T15:58Z,"I have tried four times to install this but the trailreset does not work and norton stops working, says subscription expired."
,Frontline3920,2010-05-04T21:53Z,"@ accucore

I've had that problem and just booted into safe mode. Installed the NTR, and reboot into normal mode. You should than have 165 **or* 120 days. Sometimes it's different on all of my systems... I don't know why tough... ??

And if you don't know how to start in safe mode than perhaps you shouldn't be using TPB."
,accucore,2010-05-05T14:39Z,I will definitely try it in safe mode.........
,ge1453,2010-05-09T11:06Z,thanks a lot RobbingHood can you tell me please which is the diference between NTR 2.6 and NTR 2.9

It keeps telling me to give my personal info and my email add! my question is, should I fill up the form and send it or maybe I just ignore it? Is there any way I can delete that in the C:\ program files? Thank a gazillion to robbinghood for the great and very useful uploads more power to you and to all uploaders..."

,nsunsunsu,2010-05-24T01:43Z,"When I loaded this up, it said that my subscription had expired. What did I do wrong?"

Magix Photo Premium 9 can be downloaded as trial from their website. Maybe I'll post the patch later, so just keep checking my account. :)"

I guess you need to read the install notes once more."
,XHaloX,2010-05-27T08:45Z,"Works perfect on NIS 2010 17.7.0.12

Thank you very much."
,ploder,2010-05-29T15:37Z,"Thanks for this TrialReset.

@XHaloX 

How did you get this to work for NIS 2010 17.7.0.12 without a clean install? I followed the instructions and yet it failed to register the program and invalidated my subscription (I am not a noob btw I have successfully managed to update for the last few NIS versions)

In my experience unless the box specifically mentions up to the version you have then a clean install of NIS is required. This box is for up to v17.6 so the latest v17.7 shouldn't reg properly I should think. Another thing that happended when I had a certain number of days sub (and confirmed through help menu) is that a balloon window would popup saying NIS hadn't been registered properly.

I can't be bothered to do a clean install every time an update comes along so I'm rid of NIS and install Avast Free with Comodo firewall I think. No disrespect to the TrialReset makers intended but NIS is just too much hassle for me and NIS slows down my system too much. "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-31T08:24Z,"@ploder 

If Norton slows down your PC then maybe it's worth considering buying a faster PC."
,{}KandyBarrr{},2010-06-10T15:22Z,"@RobbingHood,
