,Full_Metal_Rip,2010-04-27T19:08Z,"OK just so you know this is an ISO file that is designed to be burnt to a single layer DVD-5 disk (4.7GB). The best way to do this is with DVD Decrypter v3.5.4. Google search and you will find it. Once installed, select ""Mode"" -> ""ISO"" -> ""Write"". Under ""Source"" select the ""FMR001 RAMBO (2008).ISO"" file and put a blank disk in the drive.
I recommend burning at 8x or less to reduce the risk of errors. If you want to verify the disk, check the ""Verify"" checkbox. The disk will be checked for errors once burnt.
Alternatively if you want to watch the movie on your PC download and install VLC Media Player. Next go to the ISO file right click and choose ""Properties"". Next to ""Opens with"" click ""Change"" and choose ""VLC Media Player"". Click ""OK"" and ""OK"". Now you can play the movie simply by double clicking on the ISO.
Sorry bout the slow speed i'm seeding as fast as i can! Stick with it and you will get it."
