You need to boot from it to run the install, so burn to DL DVD or restore .dmg to USB flash drive or externals HD."

,byts,2010-06-04T23:01Z,"For those of you struggling with how to install Snow Leopard from an dmg file, here is a good article on how to do it - I used the ""restore on usb hard drive"" option and it seems to be working find. And again, in case you are new to this as I am, you hold down the ""Option"" key during a reboot to be able to select from the avaiable bootable devices.

,byts,2010-06-04T23:07Z,"As for burning to a DL DVD, you need to burn it on/from a mac in order for it to be bootable on the mac (or burn an iso file from a PC).

Here is an article I used on how to install the OS when it is a dmg file - I used the ""restore to USB hard drive"" option and it seems to be working.  When you reboot after the restore is complete, hold down the option key as the system reboots to get the choice of bootable media to choose from and choose the usb drive, etc."

,byts,2010-06-05T16:57Z,"One more note for those (like me) who are much more familiar with PCs than Macs, to use the USB hard drive method of installing the OS from a dmg file, you need to format the hard drive in Apple's file scheme - once you connect it to a working Mac, you can use the disk utility to erase the hard drive and use the drop down to choose the ""Mac OS extended, journaled"" option."
,rback15,2010-06-10T02:48Z,i need help.. i downloaded this. now its tellin me i need to burn it through disk utility.. can some body please help.. this is my first time.. 
,iananji,2010-06-15T02:18Z,"okay jesus guys heres some real advice... this is a APPLE UDIF IMAGE or some shit rite so that means it can only be read on a mac so good luck with all those 3rd party image burners u get with windows for mac images.. they dont work 2 well.. cause this image is compressed u need a macs dmg reader to read and decompress it either when u open it or burn it....

this is what u do... get an external HDD or 8GB+ usb drive... transfer it.. then transfer it to your mac then use disk utility to burn the *.DMG image... it will then work. Here is how

http://appletuts.com/en/mac-os-x/burning-a-dmg-image-to-cddvd/

this is verified and working... u can even open the image once its on ur computer and do an upgrade install... but I burned it and did a format install. Good luck!"
,iananji,2010-06-15T02:26Z,another thing if u try to burn the image just as a data file in windows IT STILL WONT WORK.. because it has to burn it as a either a ISO or UDF format for thos who use nero they know what im talking about simply renaming it to *.iso wont work u will mess up the burning process... try what I said.. my way worked 100%.. hope someone else found another way. Thanks
,Trancelover,2010-06-15T20:51Z,how about converting it to is with ultraISO and then burn it will that work
,charchar90,2010-06-17T13:59Z,Isn't this torrent supposed to provide a .dmg file? Because in the download folder all I'm getting is a .rar file and about 60 other files with anomalous .rXX extensions. Is this wrong or am I just ignorant to how .dmg files work?

It's just improves on your torrent for the people not used to Mac OS file types.

I mean, that i did download the .rar files, then uncompress them to h-mosl1063.dmg

Afther this, with UltraISO the .dmg file witch is having 6.3 Giga was converted to .ISO and now has 7.5 Giga. Uhm, all the files there are absolutly neccesary or shoud I buy a BlueRay device and medium?

,Kassner,2010-11-09T03:12Z,"If you're going to compress your torrents at least do it properly.
Use 7zip file compression, not rar, do not split the archive into multiple files, and if the compression ratio is terrible then don't compress the file(s) at all.
The entire torrent with compression is 6.31GB, without it it's 6.36GB, a difference of about 50MB. Seriously?
Downloaded the torrent, works perfectly, but will not be seeding."

,janusgate,2011-01-04T05:02Z,"Ok, I have a really important question.. WHY THE FUCK are all you idiots asking all these questions.. If you don't understand it you should not be trying to use it.. Google!! It works great!! Take your time, read, understand, if you want my opinion, DOWNLOAD A LINUX DISTRO!!.. Learn that!!.. Then you will FULLY understand everything about OSx and everything your asking.. If you really want to prosper and flourish with knowledge then learn!! Don't ride off the back of everyone else and just learn the ""Bare"" minimum you need to know in order to accomplish something.. Believe me, I understand how you feel, but I learned a LONG time ago to learn for yourself, then when someone asks you how to do something you can explain it to them instead of saying ""Uhh..Just goto TPB and read the comments, or Google it or something"".. Don't be retards, actually learn something for once, I get tired of people asking one question then saying thanks then coming right back because they ran into something different.. If it's a legit question, I completely understand..But asking how to burn a .dmg file with a ROM in windows is RETARDED!! Makes you sound like you should have rode the short bus to school.. Learn what a .dmg file is first!! It's not an ISO, get over it!! If you burn this image as data in windows and expect to boot it, YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THE FILE!!.. Anyway, my point is this, if you REALLY want to learn something, download a FREE copy of linux, try openSUSE, or Fedora if your a beginner, more than likely you will enjoy it more than OSx anyway, and you will learn alot.. You will learn how to install packages, repositories, how to REALLY tweak a system, and you might just fall in love with it and say FUCK OSx!! Although OSx is a nice OS, it's all based off of what?......Read folks, read... Learn... And then when someone you know ask's you something and you spit it out and they say ""DAMN!!.. YOU ARE ONE SMART MOTHERFUCKER!!"" ... Then my child, you will be one with the universe!!.. Long live OPEN SOURCE!!"

,piratebay,2011-01-11T17:00Z,"@Kassner

Just for your info, the compression or RARing of files done in torrents is NOT for reducing the size, but rather for the ease of download. Downloads via torrents are prone to errors, and is difficult to manage in case of a single large file as well as an image file.

So, in case any errors are encountered, the particular RAR file which had the error may be redownloaded, instead of downloading the whole 6.2 gigs again (the size of this torrent). There are ways to check the integrity of the individual RAR files (CRC sum. Google it for more details)."

Was there any need for that rant, fair enough I know some questions asked here my seem dumb but come on man, we all have to learn at some point, and if someone wants to DL a .dmg and jump in feet first before they really know what to do, then let them. Some people learn better that way. So instead off all the hate, why not either help with a a few, more useful comments, or maybe just say nothing at all."
