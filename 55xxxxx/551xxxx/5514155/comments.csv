,jon4fun,2010-04-26T00:37Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for encoding/uploading a [quark] and a full version of LOTS.

I'm going to DL both for a couple of reasons.
I know you were tkaling about changingthe audio slightly) on the [quark] version and I want to be able to doa direct compare to LOTS E17 from last week.

I'm DL'ig the 720p version to seed so people who don't like [quark] for whatever reason), can see your encode of the show

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-27T02:23Z,"Hi 20-40,
YOU ARE LEGEND!!!

Both versions of LOTS are practially indistinguishable from each other.

The only difference is the [quark] is 1/3rd the size and has one audio channel.

For non-audiophiles (like me) the quark is now 'the bomb!'.

I LOVE QUARK!!!.

I no longer have to go [slow(forward)]  on my PS3 to play a quark torrent. 

What a hame that it is a MASSIVE (this is irony,  for non-native english speakers) 5MB larger than E17 of LOTS. 

Keep up the amazing work. I know the intricacies of the audio and visual coding are probably that you dream about. However, it leaves me, as a mere mortal, humbled in the presence of genius.

Thank you.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-27T02:32Z,"@ 20-40, sorry I mis-spoke myself on PS3 entry. I meant to say that there is no difference between the quark and a normal file WHEN I choose [slow(forward)].
This had existed and is now gone.

That is the genius and for a massive increase in file size of 5MB (irony again people).

Keep up the amazing work.

Cheers
Jon"
