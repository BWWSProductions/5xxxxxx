Three albums with Amii Stewart which for some strange reason never have been released on CD, at least not in their entirety and at least not officially (i.e. only on Russian bootlegs). The hits "Knock on Wood", "Light My Fire", "Jealousy" and "My Guy"/"My Girl" (with Deon Estus) have been remixed, re-recorded and re-released on various compilations on minor labels all through the 80's, 90's and 2000's - but the actual studio albums with all tracks, all the original long versions and the original recording of "My Guy"/"My Girl" with Motown legend Johnny Bristol? Nope. Not as far as I know. 

Consequently, the sound quality here may vary not just slightly but quite a lot from track to track depending on the sources and their condition. There are still a few pops and clicks on some tracks and vinyl rumble and tape hiss on others. I'm no audiophile and I know it - but on the other hand I have excellent taste in music... 

All three of these albums, and especially the criminally overlooked 'Images', released in the aftermath of the so called 'anti-disco backlash' in 1981, are in my humble opinion classics. No, not 'cult classics', classics full stop. Amii is a much underrated singer and this is a fantastic disco/post-disco/soul/R & B/pop trilogy that deserves to be discovered and revisited by everybody, not just by those of us who have kept our 30 year old vinyl copies. 

So until whoever who owns the rights these days (Ariola/Hansa = Sony? Atlantic Records = Warner Music? Trojan Records = Universal Music?) locates the master tapes and re-issues all of these long lost gems with digitally remastered sound....

....here's a little stroll down memory lane. Enjoy!

PS. If you're thinking of buying the Hot Productions/Hot Classics CD "Knock On Wood - The Best of Amii Stewart", released in the US in 1996 and unfortunately the only compilation with some of these original versions still in print, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, the sound quality is nothing short of appalling, in fact far worse than any of these mp3:s or any Russian pirate CD.

DS. If anybody out there has these tracks with better sound quality feel free to share them with the rest of us... Just leave a comment above.
