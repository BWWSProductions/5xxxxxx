,jedimasterdave77,2010-04-28T01:39Z,"Hi Beach Crash is about Northwest Airlines Flight 5

The one you uploaded is not Air Crash Investigations

Its Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101

however thanks for the upload but you must rename"
,Bobman84,2010-04-28T06:58Z,"Beach Crash is about Chalk's Ocean Airways. It crashed just off the beach. This torrent has the correct name.

The Miami Crash comes under another name and airs this week. Cheers."
