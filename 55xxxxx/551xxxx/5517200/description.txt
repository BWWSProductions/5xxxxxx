Book Description
================
'When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week, then there's
either something wrong with your skills or something wrong with your
world. And there's nothing wrong with my skills.' Police officer Joe
Ledger, martial arts expert, ex-army, self-confessed brutal warrior
is scared. The man he's just killed is the same man he killed a week
ago. He never expected to see the man again, definitely not alive, and
definitely not as part of the recruitment process for the hyper-secret
government agency the Department for Military Sciences. But the DMS
are scared too - they have word of a terrorist plot straight from a
nightmare - a bid to spread a plague through America - a plague that
kills its victims and turns them into zombies. Time is running out and
Joe has shown he has the abilities they need to lead one of their field
teams. And so begins a desperate three-part mission - to contain the
zombie outbreaks, to break the terrorist cell responsible and to find
the man in their own team who is selling them out to the terrorists.Patient
Zero is astonishingly fast moving, incredibily violent and down-right
terrifying thriller - a new breed of thriller of techo-thriller that
plays on our fears of mad science.
