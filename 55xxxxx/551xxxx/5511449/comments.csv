,jeff696969,2010-04-24T00:55Z,I hope this is good. I hate cam/ts and screeners are just OK. No 32 gigs either like some of them... wtf?
,DragonF.C.Porto,2010-04-24T01:26Z,Thanks
,MakMan06,2010-04-24T02:40Z,"Okayy... well SecretMyth can do a 720p BDrip of most movies at around 2-3GB so I'm just gonna hold my horses and wait to see if they do... XVID is fine but H264 will be better, and a film like this must be seen in HD"

,Jack_Raiden,2010-04-25T06:53Z,"Awesome. Thanks AGAIN TvTeam & seeders!
And yes, this action-packed 3 HR film requires 2-3 GB, even at 480p.

Excellent NFO: ""Compare with ViSiON: 
http://comparescreenshots.slicx.com/comparison/51089/ Where ViSiON went wrong: Used a rubbish source - Overcropped and yet undercropped at the same time.. go figure. Chose speed and not quality - used a fast and overpowerful sharpener. Changed the colours"""
