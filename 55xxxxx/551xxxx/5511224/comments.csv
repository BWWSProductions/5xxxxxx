More INFO please"
,x7thdayx,2010-04-23T22:00Z,"By god, 38 GB's.. this is going to take a longgg time to download."
,joy2000,2010-04-23T22:08Z,"Just got this from some foreign country. You want to know it's real or fake, just join to see how many leechers are sucking on it."
,ReaL_BadMaN,2010-04-23T22:11Z,is 38 gb the real size? i mean that its remuxed maybe thats why its 38 gb.
,Trucifenix,2010-04-23T22:20Z,"Thanks for the upload! you have the first 1080p Avatar on TBP lol. too bad you couldn't have recoded it 2pass H.264 to around 8GB-14GB and would have been just as good. but i'm not complaining. hope ya got a good upload pipe, cause 38GB is gonan take forever. already 1200 leechers O.o"
,hsyr,2010-04-23T22:21Z,I just don't see how 38gigs for a movie is worth downloading. You are making history tho lol!
,joy2000,2010-04-23T22:39Z,Doesn't H.264 recoding hurt the image quality? This is about the size of 3 usual 1080p features. But how many movies's box office sum Avatar has made? You don't think Avatar deserve this size?
,Trucifenix,2010-04-23T22:54Z,"True, a movie this epic deserves to be seen in prestine quality.

but you can get near-perfect quality in half the size (or even 1/3rd) with high quality H.264 2-pass encoding ^^

Thanks again though, I really did want to see this in perfect quality. already 6 seeders? how is this possible? "
,YankeeFan,2010-04-23T22:55Z,Please provide more info....specifically does this have subs (not just the hard coded stuff when the aliens are talking)?
,allrockedout,2010-04-23T22:57Z,"this file size is fine, you can burn this to a blue ray disc DUHH!!

im going to watch it on my 17 inch monitor though haha"
,allrockedout,2010-04-23T22:58Z,i wouldnt trust it joy2000 first upload but i could be wrong we will see
,somedude.1001,2010-04-23T23:07Z,"Gaaahhh!! a raw 38GB.....

Im sure someone gonna re-encode it."
,hussein11,2010-04-23T23:28Z,"Avatar *2009* [1080p.Bluray.DTS.m2ts] [ENG]

,Trucifenix,2010-04-23T23:28Z,"the codec is right in the title - AVC, or in other words: H.264/MPEG-4

,Trucifenix,2010-04-23T23:31Z,"Hmm... if the original is 45GB then this torrent is a recode. 

any additional info like bitrate and such would be nice"
,Trucifenix,2010-04-23T23:34Z,or maybe this is a stream copy to .ts and only has one language? could all the other languages in the demonoid torrent account for 7GB?
,YankeeFan,2010-04-23T23:36Z,That 45.2 gb torrent has been pulled from Demonoid
,YankeeFan,2010-04-23T23:40Z,>2k leechers and not a single seeder...LMFAO!!!
,Bujaaa,2010-04-24T00:06Z,Omg! Avatar 2 will come out when i finish with this download.
,Crisco_Land,2010-04-24T00:06Z,"What's the data rate per second? It would be good to know because size doesn't always mean a higher bitrate. (compared to a smaller size with a different codec)

Thanks, and congrats on being the first :) I think I'll break a terabyte down (and 1.5 up) with this!"
,joy2000,2010-04-24T00:13Z,"See the REMUX in the title, it's lossless repackaging of Blu-ray data, sans craps like the menu, etc. That's why it's smaller than the original disk size."

,Crisco_Land,2010-04-24T00:19Z,Just checked...the version on Demenoid is 39.2 Mbps and this can't be much smaller so I'll need to get a firewire to play this off my external...the good old USB just won't cut it :)
,Trucifenix,2010-04-24T00:46Z,"so the demonoid one is just bigger because of the languages and menus and stuff? that's good to know. so this really _is_ lossless. nice!

hate to break it to you, but AVC = H.264, like most blurays. the difference is, the 38GB of insane bitrate makes it lossless."

Home cinemas simply arent ready for 3D yet, even if its released right now very few people could actually watch it at home. Kind of like the movie itself, they had to wait for more cinemas to install proper 3D projectors."

Check the bit rates, This one is a full Blu-ray movie only rip with no compression (will look the best), and as the size goes down, so does the bit rate and the quality of the video/audio.

Don't get me wrong, even the smallest one looks really good but, this would be the best out of all of them (or the other 45gb one, that one just has extras on it).

now keep in mind this is a pgs stream and should only be used if u plan on remuxing the video and buring it on a bluray in bdmv format. for all you other people who wish to keep it in a mkv container you must convert it to srt format first."

http://forum.videohelp.com/attachments/1548-1272251091/Avatar.(2009).srt

if you are using media player classic to play the movie renaming the subtitle file to the same name as the movie file should work. if that doesnt work you need to download tsmuxer and mkvmerge gui here are the links:

http://www.smlabs.net/tsMuxer/tsMuxeR_1.10.6.zip

http://www.videohelp.com/download/mkvtoolnix-unicode-3.3.0-setup.exe

ok, now what you do is drag the m2ts file into the tsmuxer gui and select demux under the output section, also dont forget to select the output path so you know where the demuxed files will be. next you open mkvmerge gui (after installing mkvtoolnix first obviously) drag the two demuxed streams (should be a 264 file and a dts file of some kind), and the srt subtitle you downloaded into mkvmergegui. select your output path and name and hit start. after that you should have a mkv file with video audio and subtitle. note: some players dont support dtshd-ma, if this is the case with your player when u demux the video and audio for the audio check the box in tsmuxer that says downconvert dts-hd to dts."

Rename it to the same as the video file (leave the srt extension) so if you renamed the video to 'Avatar.ts' make sure subtitle is named 'Avatar.srt' make sure its in the same folder as the video file.

In Movist's subtitle preferences select Text Encoding ""Unicode UTF-8"" see this pic:

,808-909,2010-05-06T08:40Z,-> BrockTune Open the '.srt' file in a TextEdit if on Mac OS X or wordpad on that other poor excuse of an operating system from M$. Look at the very top line of the file and remove the first characters you see 'Ôªø' leaving only the '1' character. Save file an then try VLC. These characters are unicode that some windowz app's incorrectly place at the beginning of the file. VLC should be able to open the sub file after that.

Can anyone comment on how the quality rates against the 11 gig x264 version ?

there is no comparison. i x264 this file down to 23.3 gigs so i could fit it on a single layer bluray, and the quality was great, but the original is always better. as for the 11 gig one, its crap. this movie is almost 3 hours long and i would say it needs atleast 19 gigs. "
,oxycodone,2010-05-08T04:05Z,"808-909 at 2010-05-05 15:10 CET: 

-> oxycodone hey man is there any transcoding and quality loss by demuxing an remuxing the streams when including the sub file? is there any potential for A/V sync issues in this process? is this cpu intensive? finally i assume over 120GB of storage is required for this process>? 40 for the source, 40 for demultiplexed streams and a final 40GB fore the merged final outputted file?
clarifications appreciated. i'll probably do this myself if i can get onto an M$ windoze puta if cpu isn't too taxing, i don't have windows on my 8 core nehalem macpro monster. 

no there is no quality loss from remultiplexing video/audio streams. basically all your doing extracting the raw streams from the container file. think of the m2ts container file a .zip with two files in it. and yes demux/remuxing can be demanding on your cpu. this 38gig file will probably take 30 or more minutes to demux and another 30 or more to remux.(thats based on my experience with q9200 core 2 quad 8 gig of ram). and no you shouldnt have any audio sync problem from remuxing audio/video streams, unless the source file was already out of sync."

read my comment on comments page 7 there is a link for the subtitles.  download the srt subtitle file and rename it exactly as the move file. ex: if your movie is named  avatar_1080p.m2ts
then the subtitle files should also be named:
avatar_1080p.srt"

yes they do, you just have to do a little research on subtitles and the different subtitle formats.  i used to download bluray movies and couldnt figure out why i was having so many problems, so i started reading on the subject.  video/audio/subtitles streams are alot easier to get working then most people think. most media players will not support .sup subtitles in a raw m2ts container unless it is in a proper bluray structure either on disc or in an image file.      personally i think if someone is going to upload a bluray movie in a single file it should be in an mkv container NOT m2ts. thats why so many people are having trouble with this movie."
,zrehman,2010-05-09T01:48Z,"@808-909 Thanks, my .srt file, does say the subtitles start at 00:11:08,500

Is there any way to get the subtitles to start from the beginning of the movie? Or is there a subtitle that starts from the beginning of the movie?

Also, I can't skip to a certain part in the movie, whenever I try to do that, it just starts the movie from the beginning (20th Century Logo). Do you know why that happens?

Thanks again for all your help!"
,808-909,2010-05-09T02:48Z,"->zrehman 'Is there any way to get the subtitles to start from the beginning of the movie? Or is there a subtitle that starts from the beginning of the movie?'

No. As stated the subtitle is only needed when the Na'vi speak in their own alien language. This is all that needs to be subtitled, thats why the first subs start at 11.08. Otherwise the entire movie would be subtitled in English which would be pointless because English is spoken thru 90% of the movie.

""Also, I can't skip to a certain part in the movie, whenever I try to do that, it just starts the movie from the beginning (20th Century Logo). Do you know why that happens?""

I know, same problem here. I click midway along the playback bar (close to the play button) an it jumps in without going to the beginning. Takes some fooling around tho. Not sure why it does that, maybe some bug in Movist. When I get time i'll try to merge the subtitle with the movie in an mkv format an see if it does the same. Maybe Movist has an issue with .ts files"

The perfect soultion for me would be having an .mkv file with DTS sound, then all I would have to do is use mkv2vob. Any ideas?"
,dar1e08,2010-05-13T15:01Z,"Comments about this. Audio is perfect but only in English, no other language options. Video is stunningly good as you would expect, literally perfect. There are no subs for the N'avi but this did not trouble me as it was not hard to guess what they were saying. Subs can be found if you are desperate, search and look at the other comments. 

Download time was about a day so not bad speed. 

The only thing I would say is that VLC will be not be able to play this well video will be very juddery due to high bandwidth, WMP will have no audio and no other suggestion on here has seemed to solve the problem, do not waste your time trying to add codecs etc, just use a trial version of powerdvd10 (or there is a very good patched full version here on pirate bay) and all should be well, unless you are running a seriously old system. 

I watched this on a laptop 3gig ram, intel centrino dual core with 128mb graphics, so not speedy, running an external HD monitor, and it ran smoothly.

All in all great upload, just needs sub files adding and it would be perfect so thanks to joy2000"

,Balthazor93,2010-05-24T09:21Z,"what oxycodone said:

my previous comment had a link to the navi subtitles (subtitles for the non english parts) in pgs format. here is the link to srt format of those same subtitles: 

http://forum.videohelp.com/attachments/1548-1272251091/Avatar.(2009).srt

if you are using media player classic to play the movie renaming the subtitle file to the same name as the movie file should work. if that doesnt work you need to download tsmuxer and mkvmerge gui here are the links:

http://www.smlabs.net/tsMuxer/tsMuxeR_1.10.6.zip

http://www.videohelp.com/download/mkvtoolnix-unicode-3.3.0-setup.exe

ok, now what you do is drag the m2ts file into the tsmuxer gui and select demux under the output section, also dont forget to select the output path so you know where the demuxed files will be. next you open mkvmerge gui (after installing mkvtoolnix first obviously) drag the two demuxed streams (should be a 264 file and a dts file of some kind), and the srt subtitle you downloaded into mkvmergegui. select your output path and name and hit start. after that you should have a mkv file with video audio and subtitle. note: some players dont support dtshd-ma, if this is the case with your player when u demux the video and audio for the audio check the box in tsmuxer that says downconvert dts-hd to dts.

is completely true, i demuxed with tsmuxer, added the subs, and made into mkv with mkvtoolnix.
you only have to make sure you set the frames per second to 24000/1001 (this is 23.976 fps) cause the movie has this as you will see in tsmuxer, if you dont the audio will get more and more out of sync the further in the movie you are."

It sometimes gets laggy when I see it via stream with the mentioned application (low computer specs my guess), but when I see it from my ps3 hard drive it works flawless.  Some of the best I've ever seen, even on a bluray disc lol.

Just one quick question here: Why the heck the size of the movie increased when I transferred it to my ps3?? (the movie is 38 gigs in my pc and 51 gigs in my ps3).  The application mentioned before has some pretty awesome functions and options, and some other pretty advanced and techy too.  I don't know if that has something to do with it."
