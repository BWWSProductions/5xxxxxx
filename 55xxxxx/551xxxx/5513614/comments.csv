,cinesimon,2010-04-25T04:12Z,Take the 'truth' out of your description - then it will not be so fake.
,truthme,2010-04-25T04:29Z,"no, it is truth you clown, you havent even downloaded it, let alone watched it yet, so how do you know so much? are you psychic or something?"
,cinesimon,2010-04-25T06:52Z,"yeeeessssss - I am a clown - Alex Jones is my gggooooodddd and I know AAALLLLL TTTRRRRUUUUTTTHHHH

I am a clown because I laugh at you idiots who claim to know 'the truth'' - all of it, not just a bit of it - but THE truth. Yes, you are not a clown, I am.

I am a clown because I love at someone who claims to know 'the truth'' - all of it, not just a bit of it - but THE truth. Yes, you are not a clown, I am.

,truthme,2010-04-25T07:16Z,"yes, you are in fact a clown, you didnt see the movie, you just made blind remarks like a fool"
,gladdy8er,2010-04-25T19:27Z,"Thank you, Truthme, for a great upload. I haven't seen it either and that is why I'm d/l-ing it. I can tell this now before seeing it, I happen to agree with the theme of the flick and that is, we are pretty much living inside the ""Matrix"". Thanks again. I appreciate your effort!"
,truthme,2010-04-25T20:15Z,"no, thank you, for taking the time to comment to show gratitude, i hope you are able to learn something somewhere in there, i'll check this thread every once in a while to make sure people arent misled by false statements and to help anyone in the right direction if they need to look further into a certain topic"
,gladdy8er,2010-04-25T20:27Z,Did you take your medication?
,truthme,2010-04-25T20:49Z,did you?
,truthme,2010-04-25T20:52Z,"what a ridiculous attempt at trying to destroy the credibility, typical, no actual facts or anything to back up your argument, it was a disinfo attempt from the start with you, 1st you say thanks that you're gonna download it, then a few min.s later you have not only downloaded it but have seen it and are able to comment on it, lame"
,crossfire6,2010-04-27T02:33Z,"truthme, thanks for making this available.  I have not yet downloaded it, but if it is a documentary by, or approved by, Alex Jones, then I already know that it is worth watching.  I have studied the Zeitgeist film closely, along with ""Loose Change"" and a couple others here and there, and all I can say is that I'm glad that there are those out there who are not afraid to make these available to the public.  Certainly won't ever see them in a movie theatre, that's for sure.
Keep it going, and maybe don't even bother trying to argue with the uneducated skeptics.  Remember that they are the sheep and really just don't know any better.  Your (our) job, as sheep-dogs, is to overlook their weaknesses and try the best we can to protect them, anyway.
I don't know which film this one is, but if it is Zeitgeist, Loose Change, or Invisible Empire, or anything like those, it will be well worth watching.
Keep it going,
Crossfire"
