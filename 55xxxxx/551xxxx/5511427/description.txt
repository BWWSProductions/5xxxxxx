Thoughts

the reggae shows are almost always highlights for me at bonnaroo. this year was no exception. i'd never seen stephen marley before and i have to say that i enjoyed his sound/set even more than julian's last year. the original material was great and the bob songs were incredible. the vibe out there in the sun was perfect as well â€” lots of people with eyes closed, swaying to the grooves and baking (in multiple senses of the word) in the sun. perfection.

highlights for me included a killer "duppy conqueror," a nice take on "three little birds" and a strong version of "jammin'."
