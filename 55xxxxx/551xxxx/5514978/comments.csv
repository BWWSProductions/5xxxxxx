,sch666222,2010-04-25T19:48Z,"Thanks... 
Been looking for a couple of these titles.
This is a big torrent. 
Hope you seed it long enough for us to get it all.
I'll keep it available for others if I am able to get it all!
Thanks again!"
,norskpar,2010-04-27T18:33Z,"Thanks. I already has some of these but never actually dreamed of a possibility to get them all. Some of these were the favorites of my youth (Fear is the key, When eight bells toll etc)"
,JJCHM,2010-05-24T08:51Z,Have you stopped seeding at 86.1% ????
,JJCHM,2010-05-27T23:11Z,"Now it's stuck again. Has been standing at 90.4% for a LONG time.

I really appreciate you upping this torrent, but the speed seems to be horrendously slow. It's been taking a full MONTH now to get the 90.4%

Isn't it possible to give this torrent a little extra bandwidth so that we can get it down once and for all? I will keep seeding some time after I get it, but it would be nice if we could get more than one (or should I say once in a while) seeder..."
,nadeem1402,2010-05-29T20:06Z,"Dear JJCHM,I am constantly seeding the torrent to the best of my capability sometime the problem happen because of internet service provider. you can understand that it is a big torrent and surely will take time in upload.anyway,Don`t worry I will continue to seed till there are sufficient seeders of this torrent."
