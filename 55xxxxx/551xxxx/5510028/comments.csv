what about Multiwinia?"

,PsychoCarebear,2010-04-26T16:21Z,"Multiwinia is basically Darwinia with multiplayer modes. 
The only crack I've found for it removes the ability to play online, which pretty much turns it back into Darwinia. LAN play might work, but LAN play is highly limited compared to online play. 

Defcon is in a similar boat with online play disabled, however since it's a completely different game to the others, i've included it.

I made this ISO before Multiwinia came out, and didn't think it was worth it to remake the autorun file to include it.

If someone can find a working crack (where multiplayer works), and i have enough demand for it, I'll remake the CD, but until then this will have to do."
