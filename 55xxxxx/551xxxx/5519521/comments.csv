thanks for dis great documentary series BONE"
,Stozzy,2011-05-10T04:47Z,"Again, Bone, AWESOME... thank you... to theused*dbag*, firstly, at least thank the dude for givin u the best quality compliation on the bay. Second, the used lead singer is about as questionable as Liberace, you homophobe, and yea, it's an HDrip, which means the SOURCE file was HD, not BLURAY, which on its own level is an entirely different form of video. Either research before you bitch, or shut your mouth and leech like the preejaculate should be abortion you are... WE LOVE .BONE.'s releases, regardless of trolls."
