         As the team works to save the lives of a couple seriously     
         injured in a balcony collapse, they are shocked when the      
         wife refuses to receive medical treatment; the arrival        
         of a patient with a large sum of cash causes a stir among     
          the hospital staff.

         In what may be the most disgusting act of screen spam of all  
         time, XII's affiliate spammed the entire screen with NFL      
         draft info for 11 seconds at 35:11. Normally we wouldn't      
         consider propering for a mere snipe since every station is    
         doing it, but covering the whole screen is bullshit.
