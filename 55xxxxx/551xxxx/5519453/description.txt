By answering a seemingly impossible riddle, Perseus, the son of 
Zeus, wins the hand of the Princess Andromeda in marriage. 
Trouble appears in the shape of Calibos, the princess's former 
love, and his mother, the Goddess Thetis. In order that the 
dreaded Kraken not be released, Andromeda has to be sacrificed 
and Perseus searches for the Medusa; her head is the only thing 
that can stop the Kraken.
