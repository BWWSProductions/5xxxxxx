,susi_13,2010-05-02T10:08Z,"Well, she is okay to look at, nothing special. The fact that she gets a lot of ass sex, then A to M and still smiles kind of bewilders me. A chick with her face covered in shit, smiling... =)"

,Stinger459,2010-05-03T15:28Z,"According to the news media, Rachel Bruno, aka ""Nasty Rachel,"" (now 22 yo) is the granddaughter of State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. She was reported missing back at the end of July, 2006 when she'd failed to show up for work at a day care center. She was found wandering Times Square on August 2nd, approximately a week later, and was returned to her parents custody. It was later reported that she was supposedly kidnapped by some greasy fuck she met on MySpace  and a great deal of attention was given to her ""kidnapping"". Maybe I'm so dammed twisted and perved out that I can't see the forest for the trees but in many of these photos she does not look at all stressed or under any kind of duress at all. In fact she looks like she's really into the things she's doing.  "
