The Human Face of refugee rights in Australia

The national dialogue around refugees has descended into a dehumanising numbers game. We've lost sight of the facts and the real people whose lives are at the core of this conversation.

The Government has made 2 outrageous announcements in 2 weeks, and are considering going even further. Thousands of Australians still buy into the Government's rhetoric. But the truth of Riz's powerful story can change that. This long weekend, thousands of Australians will be relaxing in front of the TV - a perfect opportunity to turn this debate around.

Can you contribute $30, $50, $100 or more to put this ad on air and remind Kevin Rudd that a fair and compassionate refugee policy puts people, not political outcomes first?

I like 350,000 other Australians object enough to our government's inhumane treatment of refugees to have contributed to the fund to pay for this advertisement to go on national TV. That is one in 60 australians willing to contribute cash to say NO.

Please seed it, promote it, let the world know the Australian government is WRONG
