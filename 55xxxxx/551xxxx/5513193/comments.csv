As I said, more is coming soon. I'm just waiting for a few tracks/releases to come in as I don't wanna leave them out.

Yes, I've put a lot of work into this - many months actually. In my releases there are a few tracks you won't find anywhere in digital format, whether you go search for them on legal online stores or not."
,splatmonki,2010-07-26T09:40Z,Keep them coming - really good stuff!
,Deepdipp,2010-12-05T20:13Z,"Frogski, the stuff that you are uploading is...absolutely amazing. I am a deep house junkie and spend hours daily looking for good tracks. I have never heard (let me repeat that...never heard) such an amazing compilation (currently listened to Nr. 8). Each and every track is just a goodie for me. Now I need to get it all. Love it!

Please send a short note to filipleopold@hotmail.com if you have a sec. I need to stay in touch and learn more man. This is crazy!"
