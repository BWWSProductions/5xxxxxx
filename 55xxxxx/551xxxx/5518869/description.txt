Ctrl+Alt+Del (CAD) 2002-Jan2010

Ctrl+Alt+Del (CAD) is a gaming-related webcomic written by Tim Buckley. The name of the comic refers to the Windows command Control-Alt-Delete. It premiered on October 23, 2002, and is currently updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The comic's focus has gradually shifted away from single strip gags towards longer story arcs and greater continuity. Buckley makes a living from Ctrl+Alt+Del, placing him in a small group of web comic artists devoted to their comics full-time.
