,believenu,2010-04-24T18:47Z,something new? I will seed because seeding is sharing and it shows that you care about someone besides youself.. and leeches are small slimy bloodsucking parasites who will suck your blood until bloated and can be removed with a lit match to the head.Get it!!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-24T19:32Z,"@believenu: It is new show, aired last night. A drama - I have watched it this afternoon and I'll keep my opinion to myself. However, I have found musical piece at the end of the episode as very good one. That's pretty much all I'm allowed to say."
,lilars26,2010-04-24T21:31Z,Maybe this is a John Mayer concert?
,jon4fun,2010-04-25T03:33Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Always good to see a new show come on-line.
Also, you (20-40) have good taste in shows. I'll give it a go.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-25T06:25Z,"@Jon: Reason why I have encoded is simple: XviD, which is comparable by size - is unwatchable. Screwed. Totally. 2HD shit again.
Not because of the show quality. If you read carefully what I wrote in answer to believenu - you can see that only music score get praised."
,jon4fun,2010-04-26T00:30Z,"@ ALL - Early days yet BUT the premise of the show is good and I'm definitely going to to follow-up on the episodes.

@ 20-40 - Hope you're going to to keep uploadong your enocde. I 'sort of' undertand the XviD reasoning BUT as you have saved me so much DL allowance with [quark] & [Talk Shows Pack quark] I have plenty of allowance left to DL and SEED.
Thank yo.

Cheers
Jon"
