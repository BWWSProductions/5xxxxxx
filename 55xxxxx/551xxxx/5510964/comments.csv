THIS is NOT XviD nor XviD re-encode.

IF subs works, I INCLUDE them - always."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-23T21:35Z,"@slntscrms: As many people know, huge part went bye-bye when past home of my torrents was dismantled.
However, I have managed to save something - some of the encodings, not the whole seasons...
Few dozens maybe, and broke as I am (and was back then) I never have burned my encodings on blank DVDs, in order to save them from similar disasters.
So, in all honesty, best way would be to collect what you already have, find what's missing and then - tell me exactly which episodes you want. It has been the case with Monk and few other shows.
Further, my upload speed is too low for upping of whole seasons. Every try of that ended as true disaster, both for the requesters and for myself. 
It's your turn..."
