,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-23T20:18Z,"@mw2fiend

When you download clips ripped from VHS, do you have to watch them on VHS? C'mon, think about it, use your brain. It just means it was ripped from a Blu-Ray, nothing more."
,Trucifenix,2010-04-23T20:25Z,"cryodin at 2010-04-23 20:11 CET:
""Video Source: Avatar 2009 PL 720p BluRay x264-BR

So this is a re-encode? Re-encodes causes loss of quality.""

No, this is probably a direct stream copy, muxed with audio from a DVD-rip. no loss in quality."
,moshster,2010-04-23T22:08Z,Thanks.  Can anyone confirm if the Navi subtitles hardcoded in the video or separate stream?
,Flashdan,2010-04-23T22:27Z,"Come on people. Even though the video quality of this is great - the audio is just normal stereo DVD AC3 quality. Get the CBGB instead:

,Ocus,2010-04-24T01:43Z,"THX allot for the upload , very good video and audio quality. This release has 5.1 AC3 and is definitely not stereo.
I can confirm that there are no subs included of any kind. You can download English (hd subrip) for only the  na'vi parts here  :  http://www.sub-titles.net/ppodnapisi/podnapis/i/741329/avatar-2009-subtitles 

happy seeding :)     greetzzzzz "
,MakMan06,2010-04-24T02:36Z,"What can I do to make this (or other Avatar BD Releases) play on my Xbox 360 with 5.1 audio? AFAIK it only supports 2ch for mp4 files (I will have to convert, since 360 does not play mkv), so any way to cheat the system?"
,MRmanOFstyle,2010-04-24T04:16Z,"MakMan06  use ""ps3 media server"" (works with xbox360 also). It's free and converts the movie real time."

,Scobbalobba,2010-05-01T12:45Z,"Holy fucken hell, this still hasn`t improved, I can piss faster than this download. I'm going at 10.5kb per second and I have an 18MB line speed when I just downloaded The Hunt For Red October last week in what has to be a world record of 21 minutes for a just over 785MB version. I can appreciate that there must be some tight mother fuckers out there but FUCK ME UMPIRE, seed at least what you downlaod you fuckwads. Is this movie just that popular that people are downloading then fucking off or what`s the go Joe ?. People that seed then fuckoff without seeding at least what they downloaded can go and fuck a black snake with an infested arse for all I care !!!!"
