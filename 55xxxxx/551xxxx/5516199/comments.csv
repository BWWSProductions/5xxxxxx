,abrman,2010-05-02T15:00Z,"This is my first time trying vray, as far as I know after installation using the guide it worked, took 136 seconds to render a basic scene, but when starting up it shows ""Error Loading DLLs"" - Class  from  has duplicate class ID: not loading.
This may be due to a duplicate plug-in path.
Continue showing warging? YES/NO
If I hit yes it shows similar errors with different *.dlr files. How can i fix this error screen at start up?"
,spankyone,2010-05-03T06:38Z,I am also getting an error loading DLL error at startup. It says the .dlr failed to load. Error Code 126-specific module could not be found. Help?
,smash.com,2010-05-06T18:15Z,If you're downloading a 64 meg 3ds from a non trusted uploader and actually trying to install it then you have no business ever trying to learn to model...
,syso01,2010-07-03T16:37Z,"@smash.com
Trusted or not, you're wrong. Your comment is simple example of spam! This is legit, I have no reason to upload something that doesn't work!

Everything works just fine for me. Anyways, I tested this only on Max 2011 x64, no errors on my side...

You can try latest version of V-Ray which I have recently uploaded, but that one doesn't work with V-Ray RT."
,Artc0m1x,2010-07-24T18:42Z,"i did everything you said, but vray won't start. it shows an icon but it disappears immediately, i'm a total beginner in this sort of software so is there anything else i need to be running this? 
please respond ^^ help someone out "
,tennents666,2010-08-11T22:11Z,Ah thank you! I tried a few different vray torrents and they all rendered slow. This is the only one that installed swiftly and rendered just as swiftly.... thank you sir!
,bhd.oa,2010-08-12T12:39Z,"As with numerous cracked versions of Vray, this one has a terrible flickering problem. Makes it almost unusable for many applications."
,nietx,2010-09-30T00:59Z,"Thanks syso01!!! Works fine, perfectly for me (x86, Win7, 3DSMax Design 2011).

Thanks again!"
,Felesar,2010-09-30T03:11Z,"""An error occurred during installation. Would you like to undo changes to your machine?""

three strikes. Can't get it going on a legit copy if Max 2011. Cheers - thanks anyway"
,Gorgo90,2010-11-06T12:36Z,"I have problem... When i rendering then crash and error ""Could not obtain a licence"" . I cracked."
,radik4li,2010-12-22T17:09Z,"Good Torrent , This is true this torrent of VR is really fast in rendering. Installed on 64 bit 3ds max 2010 and working without problems. Thanks to uploader"
,wa2a,2011-01-03T18:01Z,"For those who are getting DLL error..
when you want to install vray you should right click on it and choose run as administrator, then I hope you won't have any errors :)"
,wa2a,2011-01-03T18:51Z,The best vray version and crack I ever installed.. BIG THANK YOU syso01
,1ant5,2011-01-30T15:53Z,"The programme works perfectly from what I can tell so far, the only problem i'm faced with is that there isn't 'VrayMtl' in the material creator (i have set vray 1.50 as the default material renderer as well) so any help with that?"
,1ant5,2011-01-30T23:57Z,"Okay nevermind that, it's sorted out now and works great.

Cheers syso01! "
,asd1974,2011-03-06T10:03Z,"I'm having issues with vray not showing most of the materials in the library and not having most of the vray specific lights either. I only got the basic vray light to choose from, no vray-sunlights and what nots. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I got the renderer set to vray and all that jazz..."
,asd1974,2011-03-06T10:47Z,"uninstalled and installed the vray directed at max 2011, works fine now :)"
,horrorjunky,2011-04-25T17:25Z,"will someone please seed i have been trying to download this app for 2 days now and there are suppose to be 170 seeders but i'm picking up no seeders and my ports are open and i know this because i am downloading 3DS max 2010....so again please do what your parents have tried so hard to imprint onto your brains, and share this torrent by seeding......make your parents proud xD"
