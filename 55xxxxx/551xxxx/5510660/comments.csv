,sdke,2010-06-16T20:07Z,but to be honest.. the tagging is really sad.. you should beter did one artist under the name American Idiot Cast instead of all those name..... my ipod goes crazy! trying to fix it.. will probally upload a better one on MU

Hey, man, do you know how to use iTunes properly? Just select all tracks, right-click, go to ""Get Info"" and in the ""Album Artist"" field, write down  Various Artists"
