Comment and Description:
Why do you read books, why do you watch films? Perhaps just for entertainment or perhaps you believe that there are some rules out there you have to learn in order to successfully interact with your environment. You believe that there is some fixed state of cosmic matter being defined by rules. Perhaps this assumption isn't true. Perhaps the higher you move on the spiritual planes the less you have to adhere to the laws of matter. The higher you go spiritually the more the world shapes itself according to your will, according to your own rules. Why learn rules, if you can make them? Being on a plane where there are no rules, learning, reading and absorbing information gets futile. Why learn laws and rules, when you can make your own laws and rules? As long as you're on the material plane this statement is obviously absurd. Why do you want knowledge? You are knowledge. Meditation will take you onto a higher plane. Learn how to meditate and to become a fully enlightened human being. Easy steps to follow. Know who you really are: Peace and Love.
