,zxyplayer,2011-07-21T11:37Z,"Just a heads up! My contra-P2P-program ""PeerBlock"" showed that this torrent had several connections with many phone/internet providers, but not from private addresses. This is typical if they are being forced to find infringing IP-addresses for another company, for example a law firm.

Globe Telecom - 124.6.181.161
T-Mobile USA  - 208.54.87.238
Smart Broadband - 121.1.53.13

I'd get some protection if I were you and living in the States or in the UK"
