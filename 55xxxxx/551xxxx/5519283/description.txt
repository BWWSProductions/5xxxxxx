    Documentary series charting the visual appeal and          
    historical meaning of maps.                               
                                                             
    The British Library is home to a staggering 4.5 million   
    maps, most of which remain hidden away in its colossal     
    basement, and the programme delves behind the scenes to   
    explore some amazing treasures in more detail. This is   
    the story of three maps, three 'visions' of London over   
    three centuries; visions of beauty that celebrate but      
    also distort the truth. It's the story of how urban       
    maps try to impose order on chaos.                       
                                                              
    On Sunday 2 September 1660, the Great Fire of London       
    began reducing most of the city to ashes, and among the   
    huge losses were many maps of the city itself. The       
    Morgan Map of 1682 was the first to show the whole of     
    the City of London after the fire. Consisting of           
    sixteen separate sheets, measuring eight feet by five     
    feet, it took six years to complete. Morgan's beautiful  
    map symbolised the hoped-for ideal city.                  
                                                               
    In 1746 John Rocque produced at the time the most         
    detailed map ever made of London. Like Morgan's,         
    Rocque's map is all neo-Classical beauty and clinical     
    precision, but the London it represented had become the    
    opposite. In engravings of the time, such as Night, the   
    artist William Hogarth shows a city boiling with vice    
    and corruption. Stephen Walter's contemporary image,      
    The Island, plays with notions of cartographic order       
    and respectability. His extraordinary London map looks    
    at first glance to be just as precise and ordered as     
    his hero Rocque's but, looking closer, it includes 21st   
    century markings such as 'favourite kebab vans' and        
    sites of 'personal heartbreak'.
