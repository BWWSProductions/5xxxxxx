,Marucins,2010-04-27T21:49Z,Someone check on a Mac version?
,MikeHaggarKJ,2010-04-27T23:39Z,"I got it working now, I completely uninstalled Settlers 7 AND Ubisoft game Launcher and deleted everything related to those programs. Then I reinstalled, followed the instructions and now it works!
If anyone is having the same problems as me (crashing before the game starts): uninstall Ubisoft Game Launcher, Settlers 7, delete Program Files/Ubisoft folder, delete Documents/Settlers 7 folder. Then reinstall and play!

Thanks mbb15 for your help and fantastic uploads! and to razor1911 aswell off course."

,Saduff,2010-04-28T19:31Z,"@salakutt: See on tavaliselt sellepärast, et mingi anti-viirus blokeerib 1911.dll-i ära. Pane kõik anti-viirused kinni ja kui sul on Vista või 7, siis ""Run as Admin"". Kui sul on AVG, siis vist muidu ei saa, kui võtad selle täiesti maha."

thx man"
,okur55,2010-05-07T20:10Z,"FCK YEEAA... got it, if the game crashes after the razor1911 presents thing, do following
right click The Settler7.exe
click ""run as administrator""
press esc when Razor1911 presents thing comes up

P.S; RAZOR I LOVE U MAN... "
,PGHammer,2010-05-09T14:36Z,"If you are running either Vista or 7 and are having trouble, after applying the update then the crack (in that order), right-click the executable and select ""Run as Administrator""; then, while Razor's graphics are running, hit the Esc key.  Then adjust your graphics and other settings to suit.  I play this on Windows 7 x64 on a Celeron DC E1200 (albeit OC'd to 2.67 GHz) with 3 GB oif RAM and an AMD HD3450 (in short, a wimp)."

,v4vito,2010-11-27T10:25Z,"PLEASE HELP!!!
I install the latest patch and when I go to play it requires a product key.

Could anyone help me? "
,Eiji77,2011-01-13T16:30Z,"@v4vito
You already answered yourself in your own comment:""I INSTALL THE LATEST PATCH and when I go to play it requires a product key.""
Youre supposed to install only the update that you got with the game. when you update the gae further the crack won't logically work."
,DR-NL,2011-02-13T22:37Z,"Hi, just to let you guys know: I also got the warning about the 1911.dll from my Norton 360 (v3).

I turned off the spyware and so protection and used the crack only torrent from Razor, unpacked only the map with the two dll files to the desktop and copied tje 1911.dll to my install directory. This worked for me, I got the game started.

Hope this helps!

DR."
,huldu,2011-09-16T01:30Z,Use a proper AV that don't randomly toss out warnings for everything.
,nsalvador,2012-06-22T19:23Z,Can you say the version of the crack or i have to guess it?
