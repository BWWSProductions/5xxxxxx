,spikey7,2010-04-27T18:08Z,"leave it a couple of days and see if trial days stay at 30,if they do then your patched."
,Guidelinez,2010-05-02T11:33Z,"Thank you GuruFuel/RedHatcc,
After a few days the trail period is still 30 day's!
The prepatch works!"

I could easily have downloaded a free 30 day trial version myself. Without having to sed or spoil my seed ratio!

However I dont seed sh^t wastes of time like this! that is just pointless!

*****Stop seeding this bollocks people*****"
