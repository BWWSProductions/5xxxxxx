,XenoSilvano,2010-06-02T09:21Z,"Not what I had expected - this book uses a lot of abriviations (honestly they could have written this in a more accessible style), some flora in the book are even illustrated. Could have been simplified but at the same time more informative about other aspect of the hurb not just its uses."
