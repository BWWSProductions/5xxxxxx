My apologies to everyone who has been looking for my torrents here recently.
It's not really my doing, though.
The Pirate Bay is currently not allowing uploads by anyone other than "VIP Uploaders" -- this is, people to contribute financial donations to the site.
This issue has occurred in the past; it is a problem with their CAPTCHA utility.
It has been going on this time for about two and half days so far.  
I am checking in here multiple times during each day so that I can get things back to normal as soon as possible.

Please make a note of this URLThe purpose of this blog is to give you a single place to go when you are not finding a new torrent when and where you expect it.

Thanks for all your support!

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
