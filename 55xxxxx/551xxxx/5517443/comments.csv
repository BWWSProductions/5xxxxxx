,samjoe88,2010-04-27T00:55Z,"Here is a great book that was actually banned for simply quoting important figures from history.  The book was so damaging to the powers that be, that they had the printing of it banned.

There is no such thing as free speech, especially when you're quoting people and letting their own words do the damage.

The book: ""Subverted Nation's Basic Training for Revolutionaries, by author: Adam Austin, was banned from bookstore shelves, due to fears of exposing the criminal empire's Psychological wars, behavioral practices, and how people can become aware and defend themselves, against these people, whom desire to destroy and devour the planet.

The criminal empire's publishing houses, book distributors, and media outlets such as; amazon, borders, and other book publishers and distributors, immediately removed and banned this book, from ever getting to the public.

Author Adam Austin is now giving his best seller book away FREE, at his website, because the book is feared by this criminal empire.

This is the most intense book on the market. It's a heavy hitter, and a must for anyone interested in the truth, as told by some of the world's most important figures. Like many of us out there, you could spend years researching what the problems are in this world, or you could save your time and get this book. 

It will challenge you in ways you never thought possible.

[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-04-27T03:55Z,"Five Israelis charged with organ trafficking

(Guardian)

Israel has charged five of its citizens, including a retired army general, with operating a nationwide organ trafficking ring that ensnared dozens of potential victims. The charges include human trafficking for the purpose of organ harvesting and money laundering.

The indictment says that the ring exploited the desperate condition of sick people and called it a ?form of modern slavery.? The traffickers allegedly offered up to $100,000 per kidney but in at least two cases did not pay the donors, who were sought through advertisements and then flown from Israel to Europe, South America or Southeast Asia, where the organs were extracted in illegal procedures. Israeli law bans organ sales."

I was really starting to miss these higher quality (64 kbps, 44.1 kHz), ad free podcasts. I wonder what happened to sebaygo1, he was keeping up such a good job!

Are these the high-quality premium podcasts from prisonplanet.tv btw?"
