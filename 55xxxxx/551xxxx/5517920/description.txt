"Open and Shut"

House and the team take on the case of a woman Julia
(guest star Callies), who is in an open marriage and
becomes ill during a date with her on-the-side
boyfriend. As perplexing as the case is, Julia's
happy and healthy, yet polygamous relationship is
equally baffling to the team. Meanwhile, House tests
Wilson's relationship with Sam.
