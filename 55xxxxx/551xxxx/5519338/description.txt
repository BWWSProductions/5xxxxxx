"PERCHANCE TO DREAM"  

Adam (Peter Krause) has his hands full when Kristina 
(Monica Potter) goes back to work and leaves him 
with Max (Max Burkholder) and Haddie (Sarah Ramos) 
for the weekend. Along with taking care of his own 
kids, Adam gives Drew (Miles Heizer) girl advice 
when a school dance approaches. Sarah (Lauren 
Graham) tries to get Amber (Mae Whitman) excited 
about college by taking her to an event on campus 
and unexpectedly runs into an ex. Meanwhile, Julia 
(Erika Christensen) attempts to teach Sydney 
(Savannah Paige Rae) a lesson about lying and Crosby 
(Dax Shepard) takes Jasmine (Joy Bryant) on a real 
date without Jabbar (Tyree Brown).

Enjoy :)
