     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      In the second programme of this series we discover how
      difficult it is for witnesses to identify suspects. When
      bystanders get caught up in a bungled armed robbery and one of
      them is kidnapped, what effect do weapons and fear have on their
      memories? High-tech eye-tracker cameras allow us to compare what
      witnesses remember from the crime with what they actually saw.
      The difference between recall and recognition is illustrated by
      witnesses who can't describe suspects they clearly saw.
