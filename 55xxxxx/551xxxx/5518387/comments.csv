,cclloyd,2010-04-29T02:48Z,"480p is HD on a CRT, which has crappy quality anyway."
,dini931,2010-04-29T03:47Z,thanx cclloyd
,Lightmanone,2010-04-29T16:41Z,"Normally I am not bothered this much by this but.. Since 2 people are already wrong:

The definition ""HD"", which is usually defined with HDready and FullHD, must have the minimum resoltion of 720 horizontal lines to qualify for the seal. (FullHD must have 1080 horizontal lines to qualify.) Any quality lower then these lines can't be qualified as ""HD"".

Therefore both Dini931 as well as cclloyd are wrong. This is NOT HD, and therefor this is in the wrong section."
