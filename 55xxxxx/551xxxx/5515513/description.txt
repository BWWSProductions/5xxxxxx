From http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=328 :

Thanks to tireless work by Kieran Kunyha, Alex Giladi, Lamont Alston, and the Doom9 crowd, x264 can now produce Blu-ray-compliant video.  Extra special thanks to The Criterion Collection [1] for sponsoring the final compliance test to confirm x264â€™s Blu-ray compliance.

With x264â€™s powerful compression, as demonstrated by the incredibly popular BD-Rebuilder Blu-ray backup software [2], itâ€™s quite possible to author Blu-ray disks on DVD9s (dual-layer DVDs [3]) or even DVD5s (single-layer DVDs) with a reasonable level of quality.  With a free software encoder and less need for an expensive Blu-ray burner, we are one step closer to putting HD optical media creation in the hands of the everyday user.

To celebrate this achievement, we are making available for download a demo Blu-ray encoded with x264, containing entirely free content!

On this Blu-ray are the Open Movie Project films Big Buck Bunny [4] and Elephantâ€™s Dream [5], available under a Creative Commons license [6].  Additionally, Microsoft has graciously provided about 6 minutes of lossless HD video and audio (from part of a documentary project) under a very liberal license.  This footage rounds out the Blu-ray by adding some difficult live-action content in addition to the relatively compressible CGI footage from the Open Movie Project.  Finally, we used this sound sample [7], available under a Creative Commons license [8].

You may notice that the Blu-ray image is only just over 2GB.  This is intentional; we have encoded all the content on the disk at appropriate bitrates to be playable from an ordinary 4.7GB DVD.  This should make it far easier to burn a copy of the Blu-ray, since Blu-ray burners and writable media are still relatively rare.  Most Blu-ray players will treat a DVD containing Blu-ray data as a normal Blu-ray disc.  A few, such as the Playstation 3, will not, but you can still play it as a data disc.
