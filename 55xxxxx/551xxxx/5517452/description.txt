Folder Marker Home v3.0 made Portable.

No need to install it!
Or, if you want to, Setup is included. This is just the GiveAwayOfTheDay.com program for today. Get it while it lasts. And after it if necessary use the Reg.reg file...

There is also an ICL folder from where you can pick up the ripped extra icons of the Pro version. It's enough to copy them in the %AppData%ArcticLineFolder Markericl Dir. The Portable version already uses them.


A handy shell extension that enables you to mark folder icons to indicate a priority level (high, low, normal), level of project completeness (done, half-done, planned), work status (approved, rejected, pending), and type of information stored within (work, important, temp and private files).

Simply right-click on any folder and select the icon or color to be used from the newly added menu option. The perfect download if you need a little extra boost getting your files in order. Try it now!

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
