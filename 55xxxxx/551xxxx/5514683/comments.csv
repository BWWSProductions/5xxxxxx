,Onlags,2010-04-26T05:27Z,"@Slothmoss
Thanks dude!

@Halfbeard
Open minecraft.bat with Notepad and replace ""java"" with the path to your java.exe so it will look like   ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe"" -Xmx256m -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=127.0.0.1 -DproxyPort=8888 -classpath .;textures;lib\jinput.jar;lib\lwjgl.jar;lib\lwjgl_util.jar;lib\minecraft.jar -Djava.library.path=native\windows Main

,professor,2010-04-29T03:48Z,"The save slots try to save to the official server, i think. What you want to do is look down a bit and choose save to file or whatever it's called."

,pizzapimp,2010-05-08T21:07Z,i didnt use a login i just left it blank and it worked :)
,Rebrebs,2010-05-19T22:47Z,"Thank you Slothmoss for releasing this torrent, it was fun whilst it lasted!
However, after downloading it (downloaded it a couple days ago), all was going smoothly, I was running Fiddler and that and was having fun in Minecraft Indev, only then was I stumped. I was stumped because I wanted to save my progress in Minecraft (about half an hours worth) and to see if the saving system works, as I read up on this page some people were having problems.
Well I did save it, and it was successful, and I decided to leave it for the night.
The next day I played again, loading Minecraft up like before with Fiddler etc., only to find that when I tried to click Load or Save, it said ""Unable to load file"", even when I tried to save... I restarted it and it happened again so I looked around and didn't find anything that could help me. When I came on today, something even worse happened, everytime I loaded up Minecraft, the cmd log was spamming like crazy with the error ""java.lang.NullPointerException"", and I have no idea what to do.
I've tried adding new textures and updating java but no avail...
Thanks in advance!"
,Slothmoss,2010-05-29T15:17Z,"@Rebrebs

,jinwarior,2010-07-23T14:41Z,"really guys? i hate paying for shit as much as anybody, but this game was made entirely by 1 guy. show some support, or shit like EA and Ubisoft will phase out all the REAL developers."

,jebbery,2010-08-04T19:34Z,"thanks great game
