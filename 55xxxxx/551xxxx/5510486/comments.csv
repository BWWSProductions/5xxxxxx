,Sponge99,2010-06-17T12:50Z,"Actually, just worked out how to do it!
Once the game is booted, press your 'Home' button and hit the more options menu. There you will find a few different screen sizing selections."

,biffbiffson,2011-06-20T03:29Z,"THANK YOU. i was looking for the 2nd disc for SO long. i dropped my 1 tb external a while back and lost all of the discs except for the first one that was on my psp. i even spent a whole day trying to make an eboot from iso rips of my own discs, but i suck at life.

i didn't want to lose my save file, and even when i booted this game in my psp, it took a few seconds, and i was skeptical...even if it did run, i PROBABLY wouldn't have had my save...but ALAS! the game loaded well, all in one 1.75gb eboot file, and it read my save! thanks a bunch! kudos"
,ninjagamer16,2011-09-09T04:23Z,downloading it now hope it works :)
,FinalRemnant,2011-10-22T05:07Z,"Ok can anyone help? I get it on my psp fine but whenever I try to play it, it says 'The copyright protection information is invalid. (8010850E)' anyone help me with this please? :)"
,geojenks,2011-11-06T19:04Z,"Thanks for the torrent, works perfectly, good speed. Only thing is I had to swap the EBOOT files manually, I don't know whether thats because I set up the folders wrong or not. But I quit the game, then renamed the eboot for disk one eboot(1) or something, then renamed the eboot for disk two eboot, it was eboot(w) before, then it was fine to work"
,gokiru,2012-06-05T14:28Z,"Even in full screen mode it has vertical black borders. Also, the opening movie is mute.

I'm on 5,03 Prome-4"
