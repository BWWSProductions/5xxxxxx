[V],thethingy,2010-04-24T07:42Z,all the people that use these tools get banned
[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-24T07:46Z,Well sorry... these are useful tools if used properly. Same thing goes with guns. 
[T],sanpork,2010-04-24T11:07Z,Thanks.....  Do you have some more like these if you have plz upload it.
,grizzmo,2010-04-24T11:35Z,"Damn you, I just got infected from another torrent, so no thanx for you."
,Antubis,2010-04-24T11:48Z,"Clearly labeled as trojans, and yes, they do have legitimate uses. 

Backdoors and Trojans are some of the cheapest and easiest remote admin tools out there, you just have to set them up correctly, and firewalled correctly, so that only those you want to have access have it. 

People who buy and use guns or install and use trojans are fine. People who shoot people in public, or install trojans on unsuspecting people need jailed."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-24T15:24Z,"@sanpork - yes i have some stuff laying around i wil group and put out. anything in particular you need first?

@Antubis - my point exactly."
[T],sanpork,2010-04-24T20:01Z,For those who really fear from Trojans & Viruses just use deep freeze & freeze your drives & then play with the stuff like these....
[V],big_dad_e,2010-04-26T06:38Z,Crap like the rest of your uploads.
[T],RedHatcc,2010-06-06T06:09Z,"Being creative is disabling their AV before deploying a trojan. How about deploying a batch to remove a critical file that is used by the AV? Think outside the box... and btw if this torrent happens to die over time (people not seeding) there will be a link in our forums for a download :)

[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-06-09T05:19Z,"+ binders ? Is the binders FUD/UD then ?

,e103,2010-07-04T07:18Z,"please seed. also, will somebody give my novice brain a bit of advice? my question: will my computer be eff'd up if i download these? or would i have to accidentally deploy it on my system? thanx for the ul RedHatcc! keep up the good work!"
,badassblue002,2010-10-07T21:05Z,Thanks sooo much man
[T],RedHatcc,2010-12-01T00:02Z,"Sorry some of you guys feel this way. 

If you like the torrent, please download, if you have problems getting something to work post it, if you are just flaming or running off at the mouth, honestly... no one cares :D "
,W4rr10r,2011-08-29T05:38Z,"Thanks for the upload RedHat, I've been using some of your torrents for a very long time, and I am never disappointed. :]
