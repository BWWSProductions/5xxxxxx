Hackers Trojan Collection + Binders


Ok here is the deal. This package contains trojans, SO when you extract them, if you have an AV running then it will quarantine it like asap lol. So disable your antivirus software before you extract. 

This package has 13 of the best trojans that i have used before. If you are unsure how to use a trojan to hack someones PC, i would suggest look at the bottom of the page, click the link to the site, and ask all your questions in there, no worry of getting flamed for a dumb question :D


Here is a list of the trojans in this package. 

1. Beast 2
2. CE1.0
3. Char0n
4. Hav-Rat 1.2
5. invasion
6. LetMeRule! v2
7. MofoTro
8. n3t d3v15
9. Optix Pro v11
10. Posion Ivy
11. ProRat
12. Theef 2
13. Yuri v12


I personally prefer Optix Pro as it works great on XP. Now, most AV softwares pick up all these programs, but not all. I would suggest knowing a little about their pc, and somehow disabling the AV before deploying one of these to their machine. If you like the torrent, seed, if you really like it click the + at the top to show you appreciate the work. 

Also, consider joining the forums. If we succeed in growing, i will MAKE SURE that all the tools are shared online that most people keep private. Cheers!
