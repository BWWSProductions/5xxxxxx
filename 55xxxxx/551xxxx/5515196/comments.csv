What a classic..Have not been dling much latly major computer glitches really old lines coming into property out here in the sticks...Will seed of course but last thing I tried to seed of yours only seeded for a couple of days then stopped even tho it was the only thing I was seeding..Hope I have better luck this time..
Any way cheers hope your well"

Do not worry about seeding, seed as you can. Out there should be plenty of people on faster connection than yours."
