Other Voices, Other Rooms, Nanci Griffith's tenth album, released in 1993. It is unusual in the singer-songwriter's catalog in that none of its songs was written by Griffith. Here she pays homage to other songwriters who have influenced her own career by covering their songs. Guest artists who appear in their own compositions include Frank Christian playing guitar on "Three Flights Up," Bob Dylan playing harmonica on "Boots of Spanish Leather," Arlo Guthrie in a duet on "Tecumseh Valley" and John Prine lending harmony vocals on "Speed of the Sound of Loneliness."

The album rose into the #54 position on the Billboard Pop Albums chart in 1993, although it had no charting singles.
