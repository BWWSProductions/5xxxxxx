      Stephen Sondheim Revisited - Melvyn Bragg travels to
      Manhattan to talk to composer Stephen Sondheim about his craft,
      his early life, and the influence of Oscar Hammerstein on his
      career. This is the third time Sondheim has been the programme's
      subject and he talks about how Hammerstein ignited his desire to
      write by taking him to see the musical Carousel, and advised him
      to work with Bernstein on West Side Story, Sondheim's first big
      break. The film includes clips from current Broadway productions
      of A Little Night Music and West Side Story, and footage from
      the previous South Bank Shows.
