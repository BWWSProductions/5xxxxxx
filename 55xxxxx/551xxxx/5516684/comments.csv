,hauntnut,2010-04-28T01:24Z,"Great quality on the video, can't say enough about it. The audio is decent, but it would have been great if it had been a 5.1 track instead of 2.0. There's another torrent on here containing an AVI file that has the same video quality and 5.1 audio. This one is good, but could have been great."
