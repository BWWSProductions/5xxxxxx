,ednum5,2010-05-27T15:11Z,Upload is not meaningful; all you upload is the .torrent file. What you have to do is seed if you want people to download or leech the file from you. This means leaving the file available to utorrent of whatever client you are using for however long it takes for someone else to download the whole file and they begign to seed as well. Thanks.
