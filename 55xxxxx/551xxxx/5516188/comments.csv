,theinstinct,2010-04-26T08:10Z,"99.8% of this entire file is padding. I cannot watch this on any of my player programs including VLc, DIVX, and WMV. The file is listed as being 4 seconds long as well. This file is nothing like the other ones I have downloaded from eztv of this particular series"
,captainronito,2010-04-26T10:04Z,"There was a Fake posted by Anonymous that claimed to be an eztv file

Is it possible you got that one?

That torrent has been struck down.

It was entitled :
 Breaking Bad S03E06 HDTV XviD-FEVER [eztv]

This torrent however
Breaking Bad S03E06 HDTV XviD-LOL [eztv]

 is is the only EZTV version now posted. 

If you got FEVER in the title you got the bad one"
