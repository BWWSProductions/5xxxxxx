     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Time Team descend upon the Scottish island of Mull at the
      invitation of two local amateur archaeologists. Eager for the
      Team to investigate a mysterious set of earthworks they've
      stumbled upon in a forest near the fabled town of Tobermory,
      they believe - or at least hope - that they may have discovered
      one of the earliest chapels in Scotland. Over three days the dig
      on Mull turns out to be one of the most rewarding and revealing
      in the programme's history. It sheds new light on a lost period
      of Scottish history, discovers a previously unknown monastery
      and, most extraordinary of all, uncovers the remains of a lost
      Saint.
