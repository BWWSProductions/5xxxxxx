      Documentary series. The British Library reveals three
      'visions' of London over three centuries. Many maps of the city
      were lost in the 1660 Great Fire, and the Morgan Map of 1682
      symbolised a hoped-for ideal city. In 1746 John Rocque produced
      a map of great detail, but the London it represented was a city
      of vice and corruption. Stephen Walter's contemporary image, The
      Island, plays with notions of order and respectability,
      including 21st century markings such as sites of 'personal
      heartbreak'.
