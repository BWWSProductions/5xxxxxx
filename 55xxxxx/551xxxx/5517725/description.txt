PLOT
Bennie travels to Buenos Aires to find his long-missing older brother, a once-promising writer who is now a remnant of his former self. Bennie's discovery of his brother's near-finished play might hold the answer to understanding their shared past and renewing their bond.

NOTES
Obviously the MENTiON release is not a real retail source like all their releases. p2p reencode most likely. If you are still not convinced then their release had no subs for the various non-english parts of the movie and also the 2CD split was incorrect causing a repeated short segment. samples included. The non-english part on this R1 are hardsubbed. Also we went for 1CD as it compressed very well even though it's long :)

Final note: Unlike previous one the retail R1 is presented in 1:2.35 and not 1:1.85
