,Traziz,2010-07-19T20:21Z,"Not all keygens are detected as virus's, so  your point is moot.

It usually comes down to the wrapper used to protect the keygens etc which confuses some AV's that it is a virus/trojan through their heuristic systems.

But then again it wouldn't be the first time a lesser known group have added nasties to their releases."
,D0gmeat,2010-08-16T22:34Z,"Whenever I start up PowerISO, it says I don't have a registered version. I used the keygen and PowerISO says it was registered. The About box says I have a registered copy. So why does PowerISO complain it's not registered and says I can only access 300 Mb at a time?

Anyone else have this problem?"
