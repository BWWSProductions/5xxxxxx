I was thinking one of these:
- Ninja Assassin
- The Red Baron
- Zombieland (I've been playing a lot of World at War lately :D)
- Surrogates

I might also do a nice little 'Disaster Pack' with 853x versions of '2012', 'The Core', and 'The Day After Tomorrow' ... just something I've been thinking about! :P"
,romeox145,2010-04-27T17:51Z,Ninja Assassin was a awesome movie.  I havent seen Surrogates so that would be a good one to
,Stevejoe11,2010-04-27T21:13Z,those subtitles are part of the movie
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-04-27T23:11Z,"Very good 'Stevejoe11' ... that's why they're called ""hardcoded.""

*pats on the head and gives him a cookie*"
,romeox145,2010-04-27T23:57Z,LOL
,Stevejoe11,2010-04-29T23:18Z,...so you dont really need to put it in the title...
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-04-30T22:39Z,"I put it in the title because about 90% of the 'ipod' or PSP (or any handheld) conversions DO NOT have the subtitles hardcoded or viewable in any way.

Most people WANT the subtitles, so I put it in the title so people know that my upload is different from the others."
