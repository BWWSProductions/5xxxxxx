,Geejus420,2010-04-27T15:49Z,A/6 V/9 - very watchable cam...thanks for the upload man!!!
,Geejus420,2010-04-27T19:33Z,very VERY nice adjusting at the beginning of the movie....top notch work buddy!!!! usually people dont care how much of the screen is cut off....GREAT work!!
,shasha2333,2010-04-28T08:07Z,"Even though the AV quality is not perfect, I found it very very watchable for a cam, especially for a first cam, usually it takes a few releases before a watchable cam hits the scene. If you liked this movie I would check out the UK version made in 2007, I thought it was funnier that the US remake. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4466166/Death_At_A_Funeral_(2007)[dvdrip]

ps...as an added bonus the UK version has the same gay midget playing the exact same part, that made it interesting seeming the same little dude with 2 different families in the remake and the original."
