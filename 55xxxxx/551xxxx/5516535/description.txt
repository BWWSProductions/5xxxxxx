     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Former heavyweight boxing champion and star of Guy Ritchie's
      film Snatch Scott Welch has spent 20 years harbouring a dream
      that he would someday own Thorington Gate Lodge in Suffolk.
      Undeterred by the fact it sits beside the busy A12 and he hasn't
      even seen the inside, Scott bought this tiny Georgian gem with
      plans to convert it into a weekend retreat so he can spend more
      time with his father who lives near by. Architect George Clarke
      uncovers the history and designs an uber-modern glass extension
      to transform this miniature marvel into a 21st century home.
      However, it soon becomes clear that Scott's fight to get
      planning permission will not be an easy win.
