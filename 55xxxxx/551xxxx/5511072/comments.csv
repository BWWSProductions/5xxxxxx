I really did enjoy it! 
And I recommend to John Butler Trio lovers to buy ""April Uprising""!"
,Hmoon75,2011-09-05T06:38Z,"Probably their best album, Johns made quite the transition but kept his roots with his new band members. If you get the chance and the money, go out and by the making of this album, it's title 'These Are The Days' it is amazing!"
