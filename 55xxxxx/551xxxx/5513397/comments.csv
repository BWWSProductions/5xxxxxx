,FZiJB,2010-05-03T13:02Z,"Very impressed with this release. Certainly the best looking 720p BDRip with a size of ~4GB that I've seen so far.

The hardcoded subtitles for the Navi parts of the film are very convenient ? no hassles for people playing the file through their TV's inbuilt media player, XBOX, PS3, DVD player, etc. The typeface used looks nice and is easy to read as well.

If you want a great BDRip at ~4GB, this is currently the one to get."
