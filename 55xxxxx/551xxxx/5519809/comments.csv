^^ LOL! hopefully they're only 11 or 12 so at least they have an excuse for being such ignorant imbeciles..."
,aradiel,2010-05-01T14:31Z,"I don't think some of you understand what an R5 is. It's just Russian sourced video. Obviously the audio comes from somewhere else. Usually a line version from the cinema for the hearing impaired. That's obviously not the case this time since the audio is pretty bad in places, but overall it's not that bad. All this is mentioned in the notes though.

I liked the movie, and it's the best romantic comedy about prison love I've ever seen. Also the only romantic comedy about prison love I've ever seen."

,warlockwizard,2010-05-03T03:06Z,"@ stnd2dbn
Your a moron..... Its one thing for you to have your fear of gay people but then to try to spread it to your peers is.... Moronic,Juvenile, and ignorant.   There is only one person in the world you can truly hurt.  Get with it..."

You all DESERVE to see this movie! HA! HA! HA!"
,ross185,2010-05-24T11:15Z,"@ stnd2dbn

Whahahahahahahahahaha
I gotta hand it to morons like you.
Coming on a torrent site (Jesus would not approve) called Pirate Bay, finding a gay movie, with a gay ass movie poster (you expected them both to be pet detectives or what?), consciously downloading and watching it, to then race back to the site to spread your ""morals"" and warn...parents? (on Pirate Bay, seriously?)...to not...show this movie to their kids?
Whahahahaha.
Tell me, did you decide to warn us before or after you jerked off to the movie?
Seriously, shoot yourself you closet case, spare humanity the torment of you possibly reproducing.

p.s. this movie ""full of gay shit"" rocks!
A true Jim Carrey fan."
