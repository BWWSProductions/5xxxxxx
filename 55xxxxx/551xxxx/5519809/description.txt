PLOT
Steven Russell is happily married to Debbie, and a member of the local police force when a car accident provokes a dramatic reassessment of his life. Steven realizes he's gay and decides to live life to the fullest - even if it means breaking the law. Steven's new, extravagant lifestyle involves cons and fraud and, eventually, a stay in the State Penitentiary where he meets sensitive, soft-spoken Phillip Morris. His devotion to freeing Phillip from jail and building the perfect life together prompts Steven to attempt and often succeed at one impossible con after another.

SilentNinja NOTES
video
1.recorded to get up to 1.28gb
audio
from my main man cool's mate

syncd, not 100% but its only oos a few times and only by a very little but the audio through more than several filters.

there is a video error 3/4 through the film which causes about 5 secs of audio to not be used. not much i could do unless somebody can give us the actual DVD so we can do a rip ourselves
