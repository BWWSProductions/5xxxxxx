,gwfalcon,2010-05-07T03:09Z,I had a bit of a problem converting some videos in Windows 7 x64... so a workaround is install K-lite Codec pack for x64 systems and the software converts videos like a charm :)
,king03jeff,2010-05-08T12:39Z,can i ask what is the best video converter around?
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-10T22:29Z,"@king03jeff

Seems to me like you succeeded in asking ...... 

Srsly, it all depends, but AVS is quite popular."

,Cisaroski,2010-05-20T23:03Z,"nice upload RobbingHood!
and i was wondering if you could try to crack adobe premiere elements 8 for video editin
http://www.adobe.com/products/premiereel/
if you could find a keygen or some serial codes for premiere elements that would be greatly appreciated!"
,king03jeff,2010-05-22T05:52Z,"I tested three of video converters with the same bitrate (512 kbps) surprisingly ANY VIDEO CONVERTER PRO beats out XILISOFT and AVS. :)

Can you upload the latest version of ANY VIDEO CONVERTER PRO?"
