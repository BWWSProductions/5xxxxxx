,MissTrisBliss,2010-04-27T01:56Z,"Hi EZTV -

Argh...argh argh argh!!  I found a single solitary torrent for S09E19 & DL'ed it a few days ago...finally just tried to watch it (& DUH! - I might've realized if I'd paid more attention) - but the MoFo's in Russky!  It's actually IN English but dubbed over (you can hear both the English & Russian audio at the same time, but the Russian is much louder) - so it must've aired SOMEwhere in English...right??  I tried several tweaks with VLC & the audio to see if I could disable the Russian while keeping the English audio, but no luck, unfortunately.  No fair - y 4 the Russians get Supe b4 we (NorCal, USA) do??!??!    =(

Soooo...if you could find E19 in English, that'd be awesome!!

Thanks for the consistent great quality though, btw!!  Your name says it all; you're almost always super-fast & great quality...

Thank-you Thank-you Very-very Much-much!!

=D

Peace,
