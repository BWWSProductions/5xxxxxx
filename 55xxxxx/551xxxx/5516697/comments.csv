[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-26T20:51Z,sorry was unsure what was going on.
,Balthazar7,2010-04-27T01:07Z,"RedHatcc,
I'm always looking to help-out. Would be happy to pick this up and seed on your behalf but need some details...

What have you tested this on?
XP, Vista, 7
32bit, 64 bit
Service pack ??

It is just to time consuming to test & re-test and scan with multiple security solutions ... some details would be nice."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-27T02:06Z,"Detailed testing went to XP SP2+ 32bit and some 64bit machines, also on vista (seems to take longer to install on there)

Also it uses compatible switches etc. so should be working with no problem on Win7... 

Probably going to load a virtual machine tonite and test but i wouldnt see why it would not work :)

I greatly thank you man, i had to basically shut down all my online gaming to help get this out to you guys. I remember when i needed silent installs of some software, was very hard to find, and i made this a couple years back and decided to get this online for some others. "
,Balthazar7,2010-04-27T04:17Z,"activated and tested on:
win7 32bit and 64 bit - so far looks good.
Will be running several security scans all night to verify clean.

In the mean time I'm upload at 250KB report back in 24 hours on security.

By the way: this is office'07 SP0 -- Download SP2 from Micro$haft."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-27T05:25Z,thank you Balthazar7 for confirming this works on those OS's
,nonuggets,2010-04-27T07:10Z,i ran into the problem where my office is now deemed not genuine because it updated from microsoft. how do i update to service pack 2 without it doing that? or am i just confused?
,Balthazar7,2010-04-27T20:14Z,"Nonuggets?
You made a rookie mistake! When you first launch any office app a popup windows will ask you if you want to allow auto update. Always say NO!

YOU must go to Micro$aft website and download SP2 separately and install it yourself NOT auto update.

That's life -->live and learn."
,deznutts1420,2010-04-28T06:14Z,"Nice download, appreciate the effort to do this for others. I will help seed for awhile"
[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-29T01:17Z,"Thank you, i will work on a few more and try to get them out asap. If you need silent / unattended installers for any software request them in the forum, ill package an image and have it up asap. Thanks to all the seeders!"
[T],RedHatcc,2010-04-29T01:42Z,"Also if this guy Afro does not quit editing my descriptions and titles for no reason, i will remove all my torrents. He is just being hateful for no reason."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-05-04T10:52Z,"@ RedHatcc, Afro is a Supermod, if a Mod edits your tts it's because they aren't up to standards.  If you want to remove your tts, go ahead.  You can delete 2 a day."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-05-26T21:19Z,"Thanks to the seeders, really makes uploading worth while :)"
,cpunerdssuckmydic,2010-06-30T07:35Z,"Worked well, Redhat you're the shiznit!  I will seed this because I love you!  Keep up the kick ass work"
,DCuevas,2010-07-20T02:11Z,"It downloaded quick - thank you
1 prob - it's asking for a product code and telling me I can only use it 25 times without it
Any suggestions?"
,big_daddy_style,2010-08-29T13:10Z,I love it when things work as advertised - and this one does! Thanks for the great torrent dude.
,big_daddy_style,2010-08-29T13:12Z,"I love it when things work as advertised - and this one does.  Popped in the drive, clicked through two Win7 security warnings, left the huse, came home and installation complete.  Thanks for the great upload!"
,loquorlicker,2010-09-03T00:17Z,"This thing ran perfectly on a Vista setup. 

BE AWARE that it will clobber any earlier version of office, so if you want to keep a retrograde Word, for example, take precautions."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-12-02T01:26Z,"Yea, please do watch out as it will remove or corrupt your older versions if you do not do a uninstall of them first. As it does not hinder the installation, but sometimes it can mess up your old versions if you are trying to keep them for some reason."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-12-03T22:28Z,"Note : if you do not want to burn it to a cd, run the startbat.bat file to begin the installation. "
,andieviv,2011-09-07T19:19Z,"tx RefHatcc. I have downloaded you torrents more than 5 times in the last 2 years.
