Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Silent Unattended



OK READ THIS- 

What this version does is it installs completely unattended. Which means you do not see anything. It is all customized and ready to go. Once installed it does not contact microsoft for updates :). 


1. Burn the image to a cd. 
2. Pop in the cd in the computer you wish to have Office 07 on. 
3. Walk away :)


IT WILL INSTALL AUTOMATICALLY. 

Now, one more thing. Office is a big program, and silent installs sometimes slows down the installation. But if you are a tech or busy man, you dont have time to sit there and click and click next and ok and start and next and so on, so put in the cd, walk away, come back in 20 mins. 

I also have a copy of Office 03 if anyone needs a silent installation of it, just post a comment or go to the site and request it i'll upload it. 


ALL I ASK IS SEED, I HAVE DSL SO YEA IT TOOK AWHILE TO UPLOAD THIS AND GET IT ROLLING, SO I BEG YOU PLEASE SEED THIS MAKE MY TIME MAKING THIS WORTH THE WHILE.
