PLOT
A confident and enthusiastic woman, Hyo-jung (Eugene) visits a mysterious yoga institute run by an ex-actress where her radically changed friend told her to go. At the intensive training course, a young yoga master, Nani (Su-yeon Cha) explains to Hyo-jung and four other girls that only one person who masters the course most successfully can get the secret of ultimate and immortal beauty.

There are five rules for them to follow during the one week course: 1. Do not eat, 2. Do not take showers within an hour after class, 3. Do not look into a mirror, 4. Do not go out of the building, 5. Do not call anyone.

As the training goes on, girls get tempted to break the rules and Hyo-jung starts to sense there is something strange about this institute and an actress who doesn't get old...
