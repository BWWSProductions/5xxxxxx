It does play on a PS3 if you stream it using  PS3 Media Server.

,bradass,2010-04-27T06:08Z,"brackets or no brackets, do not go to that site.  as far as usage goes, streaming is downloading.  not to mention the spam and viruses."
,mickstanz,2010-04-27T11:54Z,"@bradass - That PS3 Media Server is not some bullshit link that otherguys put on here, if you have a PS3 setup with a network you would know this cause you would probley be using it. Its safe and its pretty good"

,triplecccs,2010-04-28T07:23Z,how can i can the subs to play with movie
,Dantheman420,2010-04-28T08:40Z,"triplecccs......

there is a ""SUBTITLES FOLDER""

if ur using a shitty ass media player like WMP, or ITUNES or some shit, then ur prolly not gonna be able to ad the subtitles track and sync it right......


VLC MEDIA PLAYER guys.....no CODEX BS, and its extreamly simple 2 use, and it never fails

just file/add subtitles track/BOOM!!!!"

,MickeyTK421,2010-05-16T19:02Z,"Incentive: 2 actors from kill bill are cameos. David Carradine (Bill) and Chia Hui Liu (Pai Mei) This is also David Carradines last film roll before his death. 

This movie is definitely worth the watch!"
,MickeyTK421,2010-05-16T19:09Z,"Incentive to watch this: 2 cameos from ""Kill Bill""
David Carradine (Bill) and Chia Hui Liu (Pai Mei)
Carradines last film roll before his untimely murde... i mean death. 

for the subtitles problem:
1. download ""winrar"" or other .rar program.
2. open the .rar and extract to the video folder.
3. VLC media player: right click - video - subtitle track - import file
hope that helps!


GREAT MOVIE BTW!"
