,Pothead808,2010-04-26T03:04Z,"vitormangraviti, not everyone has the same crappy taste in everything as you, life is much easier once you learn that."
,mikeoman,2010-04-26T04:19Z,"@vitormangraviti you honestly don't know much, not everyone has the same sense of humour and for a start, this film was mostly uk based, uk directed and the main character is also english, films only half owned by an american company for funding and filming."
,mikeoman,2010-04-26T04:19Z,"sorry for double post but to stay on topic -
A - 8
V - 7.5

Very watchable and awesome film [="
,Dig1taL,2010-04-26T11:45Z,"The quality is... very watchable, probably a HD camera or something of the like. Still, I'm gonna wait until a DVDRip comes out."
,payney1210,2010-04-26T13:34Z,A/8 V/8 great upload was d/lin at 1.4 mb/s thanks.
,deeter94,2010-04-26T19:12Z,"for the most part this is the best cam on TPB righ now. very pleased with the audio and video, and the av ratings in the comments are true. so no av from me. BUT i was a little pissed that the fucking thing went blurry in the one of the most intense and plot critical parts of the movie. watch it and u can see what i mean. other cams might be a good option with that in mind. but overall a very nice copy till we can get an R5 and eventually a rip. oh and @vitormangraviti, go fuck ur self. ur like the damn critics that watched this film expecting only what you like to watch and then knocking it because u didnt see what you normally like in a film.

and for u guys that havnt read the comics:

,InfidelSerf,2010-04-27T17:30Z,"This was a very well done adaptation of a comic book.  I suggest for those that didn't quite ""get it""  go check out the comics and then compare. "
