Thanks for the encode/upload.

I LOVE QUARK.

Cheers
Jon

@ALL - I watch my quark(s) on 32"" LCD via HDMI from PS3.
No conversion required.
Just start file as normal and [PAUSE] immediately. 
Then open [OSD] and choose [Slow (Forward)].
A/V quality is about 8+ compared to a normal 20-40 file.
But the compression is unbelievable.

@ALL - PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And when I say seed I mean more than 1:1 (or less ratio). I seed all quarks to 7:1 ratio, at a MINIMUM, and I only have 30KBs upspeed.

20-40 - You are Legend!"
