,Agantyr,2010-04-27T19:23Z,"Thanks a bunch! Looking forward to this one. Please let it seed a little longer than you usually would, as this is probably not going to compete with Avatar and the like. :) "

,war59312,2010-06-01T01:35Z,"WiKi group sucks ass!

""This video file will not be compatible with the Xbox 360 as it contains too many reference frames.""

Seems every release of theirs does. :(

They should all be nuked."
,war59312,2010-06-01T01:41Z,"See: http://tvunderground.org.ru/forum/topic/8489-the-720p-x264-tv-releasing-scene-standards-2008/

""For typical content, 
  a reference frame of 3 to 5 is recommended. For content with a lot of repetition 
  (eg. animation), a reference frame of 8 to 10 can be used.""

They are using 12. And of course it's not animation. So all of there releases should have been nuked!!!!"

,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-01-11T21:32Z,"Seems like a good rip, but can anyone tell me why it runs at about double or triple the speed? I have downloaded other blu-ray rips and this is the only film where I have this problem. Thanks."

perfectly in sync"
,flatusgass,2011-03-31T09:52Z,"Why are the days of nearly 2GB (and 2+ GB) STANDARD def movies still around? And in this case, though 720p, 4+GB?????

These people who rip, whom get such intense ass-sucking from clueless fanboys, are not really that great at what they do. I just watched two different 720p rips I got off Demonoid, which were an unbelievable 500MB! I figured they'd suck, but I was curious as to how bad they'd blow. Well, not at all, turns out. They were indeed 720p, not fuzzy/soft, and looked miles ahead of these ridiculous 2GB standard-def rips.

Really though, why arent more films being ripped in HD like that? There are people out there who clearly know how.

MORE 500MB HD RIPS!."
,takiyagenji,2011-08-03T21:03Z,seeder please (^_~)^
,osriccc,2012-06-06T19:55Z,"I don't know there are plenty of almost Blu-ray looking 2 Gb 720 rips, even 1080p, it's about the codec and the encoder. Check PS3's 28 Weeks Later for instance and some 720p like the missing HD-Lite ones."
