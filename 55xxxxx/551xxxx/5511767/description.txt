      How the Other Half Live shines a light on what it means to
      grow up poor in 21st-century Britain, as wealthy families choose
      to assist others who live below the poverty line. In Essex,
      single mum Jane Edwards and her two youngest children - Grant,
      11, and Mia, 15 - care for the oldest child in the family,
      18-year-old Levi, who has Asperger's Syndrome. Mia and Grant
      shoulder a lot of the responsibility for caring for him, and, as
      Jane points out, are missing out on much of their own childhood
      as a result. They are sponsored by the Russells, a wealthy
      family living in Sussex. Scott is a self-made millionaire,
      married to Linzi. They have three children - Henry, 10, Max,
      eight, and Oliver, who's six months old. Can the Russells help
      get the Edwards back on their feet? And how do the children get
      on, when they come from such very different backgrounds?
