,reza25,2010-08-07T15:00Z,"I can not playback Gattaca on my PS3 after burn onto a DVD media by the Nero program: I chose DVD-ROM (UDF). I can playback on VLC-Media player on PC. Other titles from PS3 Team: Gladiator and Pearl Harbor, are both fine on PS3 !!
I have the same playback problem with: Jennifer's Body !!
Can PS3 model version or/and firmware version on the PS3 have a say ? My PS3 has firmware v. 3.15

Any idaer from you folks ?"
,osriccc,2010-12-06T21:18Z,"Please, PS3 Team, keep this way. Your 4 Gb movies are just perfect in size, quality and EVERYTHING. Only thing I don't like is hardcoded subs in some of them that have non-english parts or the fact that they're english dubbed (needed for be played in PS3 though). 4 Gb is just perfect, no ""DANG FAT32!"", yes we hate FAT32 but a 10Gb film, imagine... You could only have 100 in 1TB. Thanks so much and PLEASE consider a clean perfect rip of the EXTENDED VERSION of Avatar (without hardcoded subs for na'vi pleaseeee!)"
