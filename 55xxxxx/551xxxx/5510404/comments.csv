By the way anyone who adds the label 'libertarian' to a Fox/Stossel piece is obviously woefully ignorant of reality-land...
It's the same logic as teabaggers loving Dick Cheney - who has said time and again that deficits don't matter. But hey: he likes to kill Muslims! Oooh, yummy yummy yummy... "

Except for the government, when one person fails, all persons fail. Equality is achieved by the elimination of real success, by redefining success as the avoidance of total failure."
,aftac,2010-05-03T08:46Z,Might someone know of a second source for stossel? 20100429 appears to not be available anywhere I've looked.
,LEESOK,2010-05-03T23:04Z,Thanks for making this show available.

Will last Weeks show (April 29 2010) be available? I think it was about ""Free Trade"" and featured Stossel VS. Lou Dobbs

This Weeks show (May 06 2010) will be about Government Bullies.

skJGZV6z Uploads are greatly appreciated by LEESOK... "
