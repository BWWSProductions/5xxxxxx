Storyline:

The original radioactively mutated, giant lizard is back in all his flame-snorting, city-stomping glory - bigger, better and badder than ever before!
An earth-shattering explosion rocks the French Polynesian Islands, and a nearby supertanker is swiftly and inexplicably destroyed.
Was it an explosion â€” or something far more horrifying â€” responsible for the devastation?
The giant footsteps trailing from the wreckage seem to provide the answer.
Soon the newly awakened monster is leaving a mysterious trail of carnage in its wake as it cuts through miles of Panamanian forests,
heading directly to a small, densely populated island... Manhattan.
It's up to two teams of investigators, each with their own agenda - headed by nuclear scientist Nick Tatapoulos and aspiring reporter Audrey Timmonds - to band
together to discover the secret of Godzilla ...and determine the only way to stop him.
