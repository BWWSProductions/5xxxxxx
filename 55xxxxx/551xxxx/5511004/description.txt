   proper reason: Previous rel has bad ar (2.5 -> -6.38 % error) 
                     correct one on dvd is 2.35. Also previous rel has  
						 misleading tag .SUBBED. even there is vobsubs        
						 included. Enjoy!

    When the under-worlds of crime and show-biz collide, hit-men buddies     
    Max and Sylvester are suddenly thrown in the midst of bizarre events     
    and soap-like drama. Faced with the onslaught of sleazy intrigues and    
    silicon boobs, friends must still complete their task - retrieve a       
    missing shipment of drugs. And then, there's also a kidnapped            
    delivery boy to save, loads of people to kill, dangerous women to        
    love. The trick is not to lose your head. Or your balls. Whichever       
    goes first.
