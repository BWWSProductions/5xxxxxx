,daveyd007,2010-04-30T01:07Z,"wobby, don't be mad at others because you're dumb enough to pay for HBO. ;)"
,Bumpbeefbeef,2010-05-01T14:19Z,"@rbuchner, then you've probably downloaded a fake torrent. 

Remove it and download this one instead. Be sure to look for the green/pink skull before you download anything.
