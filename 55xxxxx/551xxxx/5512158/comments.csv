My last 24 hrs. have been hell.I picked up a virus or smething and was locked out of my p.c..
I'm just now getting things straightened out.I had to re-install peerblock,utorrent and avast.I lost a few downloads but I'm getting caught up.My blood pressure is through the roof but it feels good when things get back to normal.Don't you just love the trials of p.c. life?Thanks for listening(can't afford a shrink)
Hope you're having a good day.Peace,out."
