So I made properly synced subs for this release as well.  Enjoy!

,real720p,2011-06-19T00:52Z,"This is not 720p (only 544): ""The number 720 stands for the 720 horizontal scan lines of display resolution (also known as 720 pixels of vertical resolution)"" -- https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/720p"
,DrLex,2011-07-21T19:37Z,"@real720p: unless a film is in 16:9 aspect ratio, part of those 720 lines will be filled with black to maintain the correct aspect. Any good release will remove those black lines.

It would have made more sense to specify the HD formats by their number of columns because it is always 1280 for 720p and 1920 for 1080p. But they used the number of lines instead because the number of columns is ill-defined for analog scan-line displays.

In short, this is a proper 720p."
