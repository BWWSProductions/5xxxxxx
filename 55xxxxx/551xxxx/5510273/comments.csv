I actually have purchased copies of this game, but a few people mentioned getting the latest edition of the ultimate collection because it worked for them. I don't think this was made from the actual collection, they just took all the different torrents and put them together in one download. When Microsoft released the final UC, they revamped it to fix compatibility issues.

Have no idea why they bothered adding Dino Danger pack to this. Microsoft released it while they were still working on Extinct Animals. When they finally released Extinct Animals, it had everything that was in the Dino Danger Pack and then some.

For those saying Endangered Species and Extinct Animals don't work, you are just doing something wrong, I tried these in one of my XP computers and they all worked great and are 100% VIRUS FREE!!!!!"

,dat1guy,2011-12-10T20:43Z,"FOR EVERYONE THAT IS STILL HAVING PROBLEMS USING DAEMON TOOLS:

1-Install Daemon tools
2-Open the Zoo Tycoon 2 folder
3-Look for the Setup in that folder and run it normally
4-After that installs then go back the the Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection folder and open the other folders and run each BIN file by right clicking them and open with Daemon tools
5-If it will not open that way then OPEN daemon tools manually, click on the ADD IMAGE button and add the BIN file that way. if the BIN file is hidden then at the bottom right where it says ""All Images"" switch that to ""ALL FILES"" and the BIN file will be available
6-after mounting the BIN file and daemon tools still wont run then go START>COMPUTER and scroll down to where ou can see BD-ROM Drive and right click that and choose INSTALL Zoo Tycoon 2 - African Adventure/Endangered Species/Marine Mania/Extinct Animals

PS. I had troubles with the Extinct Animals part so i just went ahead and downloaded that expansion and installed it that way

,A7Xfan,2012-07-04T06:37Z,"Missing Dino Danger, but still a pretty solid download could you please update with that?"
,joshw2011,2012-07-06T02:41Z,"@A7Xfan: Dino Danger is no longer available. Extinct Animals replaced it. EA contains everything DD did, has been updated, and contains more stuff. With EA being included, DD is not necessary and is only a waste of space. :)"
,joshw2011,2012-07-06T02:48Z,"Actually, Dino Danger IS in the pack to begin with."
