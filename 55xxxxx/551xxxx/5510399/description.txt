Spyware Doctor provides three-way spyware protection for your PC through real-time 
threat blocking, advanced system scanning and immunization against known browser infections. 
Spyware Doctor is a multi-award winning spyware removal utility that detects, 
removes and protects your PC from thousands of potential spyware, adware, Trojans, 
keyloggers, spybots and tracking thrats. Protect your privacy and computing habits 
from prying eyes and virtual trespassers with the help of Spyware Doctor.

Anti-virus software and firewalls do not fully protect your system against the majority 
of spyware and privacy threats. Because spyware is commonly bundled with software downloads, 
attached to e-mails, or transmitted through networks it can appear to be legitimate software, 
but once installed it can be
nearly impossible to detect and remove without the help of a dedicated spyware removal 
tool like Spyware Doctor.
 All current versions of Spyware Doctor have won Editors' Choice awards from 
 PC Magazine in United States. In addition, after leading the market in 2005, 
 Spyware Doctor was awarded the prestigious Best of the Year at the end of 2005.
