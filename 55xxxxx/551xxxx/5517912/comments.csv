,phelixian,2010-04-27T05:34Z,"really excited for this version, hope it is as good(the .h264)as I think it will be. I always wonder why people don't take the time to encode well. 

it is taking a while to download, but I will seed.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-27T08:26Z,"@phelixian: There is no difference between x264 and H264. Both uses same compressor (co - part of codec).
Please - do seed.
And yes, download IS slow, especially when people do not understand what initial-seeding means and how it works. As matter of fact, I am slow in upload and having 460 peers instead of 16 fast guys make exactly what you have described as ""slow download"".
On bright side, in direct comparison to ""official"" 720p which is 3 times bigger, in every aspect, quality is so much higher (if one use playback systems I have or... if one is - sane), than in reality, these two can be compared only by same frame-size. "

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-27T11:41Z,24.S08E19.272p.HDTV.H264 is on demonoid dot com.

,JakesterX,2010-04-28T09:24Z,"Hmmm... No video for me on playback using Quicktime, Dvix Player (black screen) or VLC (white screen) on Mac. Just has sound and subtitles.

???"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-28T10:47Z,"@JakesterX: Yeah, for sure. I bet that files over Giga plays fine..."
,mona666,2010-04-28T18:39Z,"HMMM!!! TPB upload has been broken for what two days!!  I noticed that Demonoid has been down since Sunday or Monday.   Things to make make you go.....

hmmm!!!!"
,TKOG13,2010-04-28T23:04Z,"if upload is broken here, are you uploading somewhere else?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T06:42Z,"On TPB upload for non-VIP members is broken.
Demonoid is completely down."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-29T06:56Z,"@TKOG: If you have eMule (or some working edk program) you might do Search for some [quark]s. Bigger files make no sense. It's currently only working alternative, but slow as hell."
