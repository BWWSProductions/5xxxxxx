Plot:
In the beginning of time, two forms of life were first created. 
One were the Angels and the other were the Djinn, a race of 
beings bent on humanity's destruction and ruling Earth. But 
the Djinn can only take over when one of their own grants 
three wishes to the person who wakes him. And the Djinn has 
a way to turn one's wildest dreams into their worst 
nightmare. In 1997, when a statue carrying the jewel that 
holds a Djinn hostage is destroyed, a young gemologist 
accidentally wakes the Djinn and releases him into the world 
where he can complete his hellish mission. But can she figure 
out the perfect wish that will banish the Djinn forever and 
save humanity?
