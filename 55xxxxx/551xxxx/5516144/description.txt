note:

If you prefer MKV container it is very simple to switch this (or any mp4) to MKV.

Download mkvtoolnix for windows 
http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html#windows

Run the mkvtoolnix gui, import the m4v file and then select the tracks you want in our MKV (for instance you may not want or need the stereo AAC track).

It should only take a few minutes to change containers.  Their will be NO loss of quality in video or audio as all we are doing is switching containers.
