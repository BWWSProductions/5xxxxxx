Mental As Anything (or Mentals to fans) are an Australian New Waveâ€“rock music band formed at an art school in Sydney in 1976.[1][2][3] Their most popular line-up was Martin Plaza (real name Martin Murphy) on vocals and guitar; Reg Mombassa (real name Chris O'Doherty) on lead guitar and vocals; his brother Peter "Yoga Dog" O'Doherty on bass guitar and vocals; Wayne "Bird" Delisle (real name David Twohill) on drums; and Andrew "Greedy" Smith on vocals, keyboards and harmonica.[1][2][3][4] Their hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O'Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively.[1]

Their top ten Australian singles are, "If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?" and "Too Many Times" in 1981, "Live it Up" in 1985 and "Rock & Roll Music" in 1988.[5][6] While their top ten albums are, Cats & Dogs in 1981, Creatures of Leisure in 1983, Fundamental in 1985 and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 in 1986.[5] They had top 50 chart success with "Too Many Times" and its album, Cats & Dogs in Canada,[7][8] which followed touring North America in support of Men At Work.[1] "Live it Up" reached the top 50 in European charts including peaking at #3 in UK,[9] #4 in Norway,[10] and #6 in Germany,[11] after it featured in the 1986 Australian film "Crocodile" Dundee.[1]

All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays,[1] some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa's artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company.[1] The majority of the group's record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by themselves or their art school contemporaries.[1] On 27 August 2009, Mental As Anything was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Little Pattie and John Paul Young.
