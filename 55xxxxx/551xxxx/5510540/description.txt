Hi All blah blah blah blah
Ok so now listen and install carefully.
First import the Virus Ti polar 2 nxp file into nexus2 through desktop import.
Then close nexus.
Then put the Xp virus Ti Polar 2 and Andromeda 2 presets in the nexus presets folder.
Then restart nexus2 and all will be well.
best wishes
