,shredhed,2010-05-03T19:20Z,"I'm likely missing something trivial, but would appreciate some clarity here.

So, I have nexus 2 working fine. It works for all my nexus 1 expansions

I've downloaded this pack.. it is full of expansions, but I do not see any nxp files.  

How do I import these?  I've copied the presets to my local presets folder, but have no idea how to have them show up in nexus 2 itself.

Any help would be much appreciated"

,fschd1,2010-05-04T15:11Z,"so why have you posted here and not  on the other post ?..... the other post explains well enough on how to install the other presets and how to get them to work, you just ned to put the folders in the Nexus2 /content/presets  and nexus2 AI will do the rest"
,anh2010,2010-05-07T08:50Z,"@fschd1
