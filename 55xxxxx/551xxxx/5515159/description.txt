Hip-hop lovers have a good reason to be happy â€“ first album of Russian group FMD finally released! Those, who knew it, are preparing to see the total version of guysâ€™ work. Our advice to others is to feel some positive emotions.

Group FMD was created in 2007 by two amateurs, who became professionals through last three years. Mc Deka and mc E.s.i.p. havenâ€™t become stars yet, but as they sing â€œthere is still a chanceâ€.
One of the attractive sides of the group is itâ€™s independence. They write texts themselves, they make music themselves, they are finding ways to the stage themselves. But it is not true to think, that FMD is only two persons. There are also two voices in album: Maria Vazieva (track 02, track 12) and Max Pussy (track 07). All tracks was recorded by Dima New. Personal respect for investors, who gave album a chance.

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, here is something greater than just CD with tracks. But, if you want to be sure, please listen!
