CHARLIE PARKER THE COMPLETE VERVE MASTER TAKES (2003)

3 CD METAL BOX EDITION 

In a remarkably short span of time, Charlie Parker rewrote the rules of jazz and established himself as one of the most important musicians of the twentieth century.

Parker made his mark in many ways -- as a virtuoso saxophonist, and innovative composer, a trend-setting bandleader, and a galvanizing force in the development of modern jazz. He was on this earth for only thirty-four years, but he left behind several lifetimes' worth of immortal music


Much of that music was documented by Norman Granz, the legendary record producer and founder of Verve Records, between 1947 and late 1954, just a few months before Parker's death. These three discs contain the master takes from every studio session Parker did for Granz, including the famous Charlie Parker With Strings recordings. With an all-star supporting cast that features Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Max Roach, and many others.
