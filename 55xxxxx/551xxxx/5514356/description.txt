Eric Bibb - Spirit I Am 2008

Eric Bibb is an American acoustic blues singer/songwriter who is based in London, and launched his career in Europe.
He is one of the new, young singers that has appeared on the scene that, much to my delight, has a great voice,
is an excellent performer and has a great knowledge about the roots of this music.

The album features a stellar line-up of musicians headed up by Bonnie Raitt (slide guitar on â€œIf Our Hearts Ainâ€™t In Itâ€)
and including a duet (â€œConversationâ€) with Ruthie Foster. 
The Nashville band included producer Glen Scott on keyboards and backing vocals, Tommy Sims (Bruce Springsteen, Kelly Clarkson, Eric Clapton) on guitar, bass and backing vocals,
Lemar Carter on drums (Carrie Underwood, Joss Stone, India.Arie) and other Nashville musical luminaries.
