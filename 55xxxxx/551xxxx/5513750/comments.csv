,Jack_Raiden,2010-04-25T06:57Z,"Looks like another fine FLAWL3SS release. Thanks for the screenshots.

More, from the NFO: ""Compare with ViSiON: http://comparescreenshots.slicx.com/comparison/51089/ Where ViSiON went wrong: Used a rubbish source - Overcropped and yet undercropped at the same time.. go figure. Chose speed and not quality - used a fast and overpowerful sharpener. Changed the colours"" "
,corn_bred,2010-04-25T07:25Z,"Does this have subtitles, and if so, are they in english?"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-04-25T07:52Z,Thanks. Looking forward to a BRRiP copy.

,shaqnemo,2010-04-25T15:13Z,How do you get subs for the naa'vi language? 
,xbguy,2010-04-26T03:53Z,Thank you very much! I will seed.
,hotpinkfab,2010-04-26T05:35Z,"Great Download . Thanks. the quality is great and I can play it on my ps3 through vuze but when I converted it with ""ConvertXto DVD"" and burnt it to a DVD there is a small second skip (not delay) and I was wondering if someon can advise me on this problem if you have had the same issue with burning any DVD? 

Thanks in advance "
,slats649,2010-04-26T14:50Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."
,shadowkay,2010-04-27T20:49Z,AWESOME Stuff! Amazing Rip!! Thanks M8!
,boozled29,2010-04-28T00:58Z,I can't get the subtitles to display during the Na'vi scenes. Please advise. I am using Windows Media Player and I also Have Divx. It wont even load in the Divx. PLEASE ADVISE!!
,listenherenow,2010-05-02T12:55Z,"I was so impressed - I play these on a divx plaayer that i love becuase it seems to play everything i toss at it. i mean sometimes i think it will play dreams right outta my head.

  This plays beautifully all the way up  to 1:02:04  Then its shuts the hell off, i tried everything i could think of, it does not skip - it just quits - i cant even fast forward it past this part becuase as soon as it gets past it and I turn it back on at point after that - Boom Shuts off again, it's like the format changed is what I am thinking. 
   makes no sense to me why this happened. really sucks though because I have waited so long to see this, I was sick when my Family went and I didnt want to go by myslef - Now i am half a movie richer. LOL anyone know why this is ? anyone know how to fix it? anyone know why the hell it's this way? 

  Thanks."
,listenherenow,2010-05-02T15:09Z,"I ran this on My System and got it to work all the way through.

  I still am not sure of the reason why it it will only play to 1:02:04  On a Divx - If Some one could give me even a clue I surely would appreciate it.

  Awesome Movie - Many Thanks.  
 I am Thinking there will be more of these if not more than one at least a sequal eh? "
,Mainers,2010-05-03T04:04Z,"Cheers for the UL raymondhome.

,listenherenow,2010-05-03T16:43Z,"Hey Mainer,

,resul27,2010-07-25T19:49Z,quality is awesome . is this ripped from a dvd or bluray
,FreeTibet,2010-08-21T16:39Z,"@MovieMadness101

Thanks, but I rather prefer FLAWL3SS's Xvid rip on my laptop. Making a quality rip is quite a challenge, making a DVD image - not quite so ;)"
