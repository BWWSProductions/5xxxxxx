plot:
In an after-hours world of pug-faced scouse smack addicts and
street fights, James McMartin and his mentor Paul Barber are 
privy to a doorman's-eye-view of a life most of us only glimpse.
Bulldog hard but bullfrog smart, they occupy a no-man's land 
between the police and the perps that evokes the lawlessness of
the Wild West.
