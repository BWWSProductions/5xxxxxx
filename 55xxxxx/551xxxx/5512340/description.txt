John Pilger
Sydney Peace Prize
November 20, 2009

In a world filled with violence, poverty, and human rights abuses, the Sydney Peace Prize exists to promote justice and harmony throughout the world. This year the prize was awarded to journalist and left-wing provocateur John Pilger. As conflicts rage around the globe, Pilger argues that in Australia we have largely remained silent on injustices in the Middle East, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He has also called for Australians to confront the issues facing the Aboriginal communities and the policies of the government in relation to boat people.

John Pilger was the recipient of the 2009 Sydney Peace Prize. He is an award winning journalist, author and film-maker. His articles have been published in the Sydney Morning Herald, The Guardian, NY and LA Times and he is a two time winner of British Journalist of the Year.
