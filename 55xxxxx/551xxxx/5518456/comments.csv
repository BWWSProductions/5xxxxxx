,montmarte,2010-04-28T01:26Z,"thanks for you rreply err! i am dubious about eps 7 and 8 b/c they are uploaded by anonymous with no skull. all anonymous ups for movies tend to be fake, plus, all eops of the big life are around 175mb, however these 2 ups by anonymous of eps 7 and 8 are both strangely 225mb. so i am thinking they are fakes....?!!
thanks for being polite, some ppl on here are just rude! i jsut want to be safe on here."
