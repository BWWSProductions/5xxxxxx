if your using bittorrent or utorrent(which you should be) it will auto seed for you, just leave it alone when it says seeding"
,mindcorpse,2011-03-11T08:33Z,Can you upload the second season of Kuroshitsuji? Thanks. 
,FluffyBunyAlpha,2011-06-16T01:53Z,I'm not completly sure becuse I haven't downloaded it yet but judging by the info (assuming that the uploader didn't lie to us) this is avi format. in that case you need VLC Media Player 
,devilspawnage,2011-07-06T04:47Z,"great upload thanks so much didn't have any problems with it.

are you going to be putting up the complete season 2 up anytime soon???
