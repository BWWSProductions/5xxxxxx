,barrenjoey,2011-01-18T16:48Z,"Uploader claims exceelent quality. While you do get to see the episode, one downside for a lot of people will be the presence of subtitles. I can make do with them, however they are incredibly poor. Grammar is way off, often to the point where it's illegible. A lot of the words are either wrong or missing and generally very poorly written. Not only that, on a number of episodes, the subtitles are presented far too in advance and not concurrent with what's happening on screen. Also, some episodes have small bits missing. 1x15 is an example where the scene before the opening credits is missing."
