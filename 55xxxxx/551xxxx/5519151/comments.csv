,microchipgirl,2011-04-04T04:45Z,"im watching e5 now, the first 4 were fine with subtitles but this episode is all screwed up, ill have to see about the rest. i use divx and tried to mess with the subtitle delay but im no good at guessing it so far. i wish i wasnt so hooked on reading movies and shows haha, i feel like i cant hear it if i cant read along :)"
