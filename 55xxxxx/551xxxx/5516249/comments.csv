,Kohls81,2010-04-26T20:44Z,"This is S07E11...""Larry Miller Hair System""  You can find the real S07E10 uploaded as S07E09, and as far as I can tell all of the other ones uploaded by TvTeam are the same way.  They must've skipped ep01 because it aired in December and ep02 didn't air until February.  So when it says ep5 it's actually ep6; ep7 is ep8 and so on.  If you get confused when downloading, I would recommending going to wikipedia and looking at the episode guide there to figure out which one is which (they have short descriptions) because for whatever reason imdb doesn't even have all of the episodes up yet and there's no descriptions available.

,zoggnoff,2010-04-29T20:21Z,Well I downloaded all of these and I can tell you that the last one from 6 faded to black as the aqua teens drove off in a moving van then the first one from 7 picked up right where that left off
,Juggernaut101,2010-04-29T21:29Z,"They didnt skip the first episode... its just that the chirstmas special is really episode 4, 5, or 6 (dont remember) and when it came back on at its normal play, they didnt bother to copy it again. It had more scenes too :(. But anyways...cuz of that, the numbering for all the episodes is off."
