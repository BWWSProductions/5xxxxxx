MP4 has been out for years now, and the best free encoder is provided by the inventors of AAC anyway, iTunes, or you could shell for nero, and sounds worlds better even at lower bitrates, so why still use technology from the 90's?"
,doandroidsdreamofelectric,2010-05-24T00:00Z,@kalafalas246 ..why dont you upload mp4 instead of moaning about mp3...i'll expect some uploads from you within a few days :).

,Daker9,2010-08-14T19:11Z,Go suck an Apple. MP3 for me :)
