Real Time with Bill Maher: 2010 04 23

Interview guests: Right-to-die activist Dr. Jack Kevorkian (portrayed in HBO's upcoming "You Don't Know Jack" by Al Pacino) and national security expert Richard Clarke (author of "Cyber War").

Panelists: Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla), international security consultant Susan Eisenhower, journalist Matthew Continetti (author of "The Persecution of Sarah Palin: How the Elite Media Tried to Bring Down a Rising Star")

The resolution is 608x352 and the video quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
