Real Time took very long the past few times, but you saved us :)"
,burningbush,2010-04-24T22:23Z,"For those us who prefer to watch this *timely* program in a *timely* manner, and don't give a fiddler's fart about it being of sufficient technical quality such that you can count every pore on Maher's face, I extend a hearty THANK YOU!!!"
,Dramat,2010-04-24T22:42Z,"Thank You for upload err0001 !!!
You Da Man !!!"
,tommacaroni,2010-04-25T02:44Z,"There's also a slight delay between the audio and the video, but my video player allows me to change that. Just something to take into consideration for your next encodings.

Thanks for the quick upload!"
,Ypay4tv,2010-04-25T02:57Z,I agree Burningbush. Who gives a shit about HD quality for a show like this? It's not a movie. Mad props to the source! Many Thanks! I should buy you a hooker.

I'm confused. I thought hookers were only available for rent."
,a3ghost,2010-04-25T04:09Z,"Will you guys seed this...possibly, open up your bandwidth a little, please. I have been downloading this for a half hour and am only 3.58% of the way done. With 905 seeders...it doesn't make any sense. *All hail Bill Maher!"
,a3ghost,2010-04-25T04:12Z,Nevermind that last comment. I noticed that MY download bandwidth was set low. lol Feel kinda dumb. duh. Happy Trails!
