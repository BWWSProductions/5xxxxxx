,loonatick,2010-04-25T10:09Z,"Don't know what you're playing at, but these are NOT episodes of ""Breaking Bad.""  One is a ""Burn Notice,"" and another is a ""Chuck.""  I am disconnecting before I learn what other surprises you have in store."
,Digital_Freedom,2010-04-26T06:13Z,"I stand behind my work.  I call BULLSHIT on you.  You can download with confidence, these are 100% pure, Breaking Bad episodes."
,chilly123,2010-04-28T22:17Z,"Well, I don't know what loonatick was smoking but I just downloaded this and watched the first couple of minutes of each episode.  This is definitely Breaking Bad.  I don't know enough about the series to say if it's indeed uncensored but the quality looks good.  Thanks for the upload DF."
,mrt999,2010-04-29T08:06Z,"This is definately Breaking Bad Season 1
Really great quality too Thankyou so much For Sharing!"
,Digital_Freedom,2010-04-30T03:31Z,"Thanks guys for the kudos..  I love this show, and I think everyone should have an opportunity to see it..  Thanks for continuing seeding it!"
,jockcup_licker,2010-05-01T05:16Z,"Torrent is of good quality, it is ipod format. The uncensored part I do not understand as these seem to be the same as the ones I originally downloaded. What is the difference between yours and others, as this really seems to be the same. Thank you for all the rest this is truely Breaking Bad"
,Digital_Freedom,2010-05-04T08:20Z,"There is no difference between this torrent and many SEASON 1 torrents, it was mainly SEASON 2 that I couldn't find uncensored.  I had both seasons on DVD uncensored and figured what the hell...  I'll UL both..."
,searchlight01,2010-05-05T20:18Z,hey loonatick are you some sort of complete retard this is the actual show breaking bad. Excellent quatlity Digital you did well and thankyou for sharing!
,variously2,2010-05-07T03:06Z,"it says texted language english.  does that mean it has subtitles or are these subs that i can turn off in my player?  also, if it's a dvd rip, how come you couldn't make it a larger resolution?  i'm just thinking it will look bad fullscreen... oh well, thanks for UL anyway. but why so many choked sources...it's at about 10  kb/s!!!!"
,Digital_Freedom,2010-05-07T08:29Z,"There are no subtitles.  It is a DVD rip, but it has been rendered to MP4 to reduce the size for internet sharing.  I've watched it full screen with no noticeable affects.  Please don't be choosy.  You are downloading this for FREE.  It is the BEST that I can offer right now.  Please seed and ENJOY!  "
,fade9150,2010-05-12T03:34Z,Thanks Digital for sharing and screw these jagoffs that can't appreciate your probono work.
,Arcanitex,2010-05-25T16:56Z,"The download was fast, but I can't seem to get it to play. :/ MPEG-4 fits into iTunes, right?  Quicktime doesn't recognize it."
,Hanks49,2010-06-01T02:20Z,"thanks for these rips, best quality out there.

full dvd resolution and h.264 encoding, enough said."
,Nightmeows,2010-06-07T05:54Z,Thanks!

,BrundleFly1986,2010-08-13T12:08Z,What is loonatick playing at?!? This torrent is the real thing people! It is like he just looked up Trolling in the Urban Dictionary. Don't listen to him!!
,finder808,2010-09-17T00:02Z,"Thanks Digital this show is the best! I like it much better than Mad Men, not sure why the critics don't."
,baked365,2010-09-25T10:27Z,"great series, thanks for the upload"
,Hyperion888,2010-11-07T16:44Z,"best show since the sopranos. best quality ul Ive seen of breaking bad. wide screen and shit. thanks DF. 

i think the only ep that was censored was the pilot. 

if u want to burn mv4 to dvd use AVSVideoConverter works a treat. its torrented somewhere on TPB."
,Harald66,2010-11-23T05:41Z,Veldig bra serie:)
,vvfireflyvv,2010-12-04T23:08Z,"I am curious why it says that there are 43 seeders, but it has been in my UTorrent for a week and still says 0% download no seeders available....


I seed forever why do people stop seeding?"
,beawolf220,2011-02-11T22:25Z,"I downloaded and watched all episodes in this torrent. I verify that the torrent description is correct.

All episodes are in m4v container with MPEG-4 AVC video (720x480, between 700-900 Kbps) and two audio tracks with AAC (2 channels, 160 Kbps, 48 KHz) and AC-3 (6 channels, 448 Kbps, 48 KHz)."
,Billy321,2011-02-17T00:02Z,definatley breaking bad but seems to bo be playing all jumpy and shit in itunes for some reason 
,crapspray,2011-02-20T09:00Z,many thanks!  This rip is DVD quality audio/video  
,Draginz,2011-04-12T01:26Z,"Says the file type is MP4, but it's actually MV4, and I can't watch them because it's for iTunes or some shit."
,zwanwoste,2011-05-08T12:27Z,"Video jerks on my WDTV LIVE... :(

,derrique,2011-06-06T17:03Z,"lovely fast download, i've yet to watch, thanks!"
,moogbert,2011-12-04T02:27Z,Thanks for the uncensored version. Crazy in this day and age that some self-righteous morons are still deciding what words we are and aren't allowed to hear. Here's a couple of word for them....FUCK OFF.
,breeding_fat,2012-04-17T12:48Z,I've found a working set of subtitles for the whole season. You can get it on tvsubtitles.net. The ones ending with DVDRip.ORPHEUS are the correct ones.
,bego0002,2012-05-15T13:36Z,"I've heard about this series, and I'm eager to watch! Thanks!!!!!!!!"
,dynfo,2012-05-31T00:43Z,"V:9/A:10. Still downloading.
