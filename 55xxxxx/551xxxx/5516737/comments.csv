,griiid,2010-04-26T19:10Z,"why should i choose this instead of the 1080p 11GB version from amiable?
and dont care about the size just, is this better quality?"
,pluck_U,2010-04-26T19:22Z,"griiid with a bitrate of 15.5 Mbps this should be a lot better quality picture. You might not notice it with a small screen but, this will make a big difference in large screens."
,pcontrol,2010-04-26T19:26Z,Higher bitrates scenes with greatly benefit from this encode.
,griiid,2010-04-26T19:27Z,"ok, im gonna connect my computer on my 46"" you think i should go for this one then?"

1) If you have 32inch TV or bigger, go for this one.
2) If you have LESS than 32inch TV, go for the Amiable 10gb version.
Just a leyman's POV."
,pcontrol,2010-04-27T18:46Z,Fortune666: Non-sense. A huge screen is not needed in order to see the huge quality difference between this encode and AMIABLE's. I've rated V:10 for AMIABLE's three days ago and I'm taking it back. I would rate it 6/10 now that I've seen a high bitrate encode.
,john5246,2010-04-28T02:44Z,"I downloaded the ""TRIP"" version which is 14GB, it's not that good, the 9Mbps encoding really hurts hit, I think blu-ray is over 40Mbps"
,bugejakurt,2010-04-28T08:54Z,"Yes, original blu-ray movies are generally over 40Mbps bit-rate. But this doesn't truly mean that you are presented with 40Mbps quality as codecs like H264 compress data in such a way that minimise loss in quality, therefore say a 40Mbps blu-ray bit-rate does not mean that it is 2x the quality than a 20Mbps H264 movie."

yes it does.... the original bluray was h.264 so your compression theory is bust. that might be the case if u were taking a vc-1 stream and re-encoding it to h.264 but not when u take h.264 and compress it down to half its original size there is a reasonable amount of quality loss"
,tigerace123,2010-04-29T14:22Z,"Any idea why this is stuttering in a lot of scenes on my PC? I have a quadcore CPU with load at 22-33%, using VLC Media Player, please help.
Should I get a blu-ray player for PC?"
,BasicKiller,2010-04-29T15:20Z,"@Sublime420 Problem could be due to ur old VGA/CPU or Codec, I always prefer to use Media Player Classic - Home Cenima Edition, Install K-Lite Codec Pack, MPC is included in the bundle.

@tigerace123 could be because of broken codecs,  why don't u give a try to MPC, If u already installed (same or some other codec pack) then try clean and then re-install. If u r on MAC then try latest version of VLC"

,newronuk,2010-05-06T09:40Z,"Amazing quality - thanks! I've never been that much for HD content as I'm quite fine with normal DVD rip quality, but I thought I'd try to get the best possible quality with a movie that deserves it just once. And perhaps I'm now hooked - the quality is actually so good that you can see that the animation in Avatar is not as perfect as it appeared in 3D in the cinema. The detail is simply unbelivable. I output this on a 40"" Samsung full-HD screen from my laptop via HDMI with drool-inducing result. Playback can stutter with VLC (shame, it's my favourite player) so thanks to neo16280 who suggested BS Player which works fine with sub for the non-English (Navi) parts. Took about 24h to download."
,newronuk,2010-05-06T12:53Z,"Update: to stop stuttering, which occurs even on my new hi-spec laptop, I had to use KM Player with the CoreAVC external codec. Without the codec the audio was out of sync in KMP. Shame VLC doesn't work properly (audio syncs, but it stutters) but KM Player is nice and I only use it for mkv files anyway.

,mrpras,2010-05-12T10:50Z,"Excellent quality.. Downloaded in 4h30 also which is great, thanks guys..

It's DXVA compatible which means your graphics card can play it back (stutter free)..

Use a decent player (like Mediaplayer Classic Homecinema) or install a DXVA codec like FFDSHOW (which will enable DXVA in lesser featured players like VLC)

Plays well if you use the right software.

PS: If it doesn't play well on your 50"" or whatever TV - This is a free ""STOLEN"" copy so stop whining and go and buy the Bluray, it will be better quality too."

Go get a media player like a Western Digital TV Live or popcorn hour A-200 and hook it up to your TV.  I own an older Popcorn Hour A-110 and it has played every movie I've downloaded except a few weird codec ones.  Search on amazon for the WD TV Live and read the reviews."
