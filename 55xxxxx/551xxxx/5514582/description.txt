The SEGA smash hit is back! After selling millions of units across console formats, the new pickup point is the PC, quite possibly the most popular gaming platform in the world?

As a fearless cabbie, you're driven by a single goal: rack up the mega-bucks in fares and tips before your shift ends. To keep the meter running you've gotta take the fastest route possible - even if it means using some different driving technique?

Drive on the wrong side of the road, catch air to fly over rooftops, swerve between frightened pedestrians, or even drive underwater! But beware - the city is full of obstacles that are guaranteed to slow you down, and don?t forget the timer is ticking!

Are you ready to make the meter run even quicker and make some crazy money?
