Professor Thomas F. Madden focuses his expertise on what has been called the most beautiful city in the world: Venice. 


In these lectures, Professor Madden explains how the city on the lagoon was established by refugees escaping the onslaught of northern "barbarians" invading the crumbling Roman Empire. 


Through its history, Venice housed the world's leading merchants, thrived as a maritime powerhouse, and developed into an independent republic not unlike the present United States. 


Venice draws millions of visitors each year, and these lectures shed light on why the city is such a continual source of fascination.
