Maria Muldaur - Maria Muldaur 1973

Ok.  I'm digging way down here...but I see there are a few
Maria Muldaur fans on TPB.

From Wiki:

Maria Muldaur is the eponymous 1973 first solo release of musician Maria Muldaur. The album includes Muldaur's best-known single, "Midnight at the Oasis", which charted at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Three Dollar Bill", which charted at #7 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts. The album, which peaked at #3 on The Billboard 200, was certified gold by the RIAA on May 13, 1974.[1]  Writing in October of 1973, Rolling Stone's reviewer Jon Landau described the album as "one of the half-dozen best" of the year, "the kind of glorious breakthrough that reminds me why I fell in love with rock & roll."  The album is heavily influenced by country  and blues.
