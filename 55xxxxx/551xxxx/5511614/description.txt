Alex welcomes back to the show [hour 3, beginning of hour4] Dr. Russell Baylock, certified neurosurgeon, author and lecturer. For the past 25 years he has practiced neurosurgery in addition to having a nutritional practice. He recently retired from both practices to devote full time to nutritional studies and research. He is the author of several books, including: Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life and Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients. In addition to publishing The Blaylock Wellness Newsletter, Dr. Baylock serves on the editorial board of the journal Fluoride, official journal of the International Society for Fluoride Research.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
