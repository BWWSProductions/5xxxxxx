,Sunseeker908,2010-04-29T16:41Z,"Thanks for the upload, but seeding is horribly slow.  

I know...I know, common complaint, but ETA is like 10 days cuz it won't DL beyond 10kB/s.  Anyone else getting a better speed on this one?"

sorry, previous rel was undercropped. we bring goggles next time."
[V],poppedtart,2010-04-29T20:52Z,the undercrop wont effect anything.  They left like 4 pixels of padding on the top and bottom.  It will look the same on your TV regardless if it was there or not.  You wont notice as it would just be black anyhow on your TV.
,quad77,2010-04-29T23:22Z,"Sunseeker908 .... same for me, maybe 10kb/s, my other torrents are downloading around 500kb/s each. Strange ""aoloffine"" torrents are usually quick"
