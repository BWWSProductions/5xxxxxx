,drxa,2010-04-27T09:55Z,"this one works all by itself to one point where game is connecting to a server...protection is drm but it's made in different way. this release will work just fine once we get working crack from proper, skidrow or someone else."

,devillock,2010-04-27T17:10Z,"Give a day or two, Dormine will work his magic :). He made a Server emulator for Assassin's Creed 2, I'm pretty sure that we just need values for Spilter Cell Conviction."

[T],Knaster,2010-04-28T03:27Z,patrioticparadox who are you to tell people what to do? You should stay out of other peoples business such as other peoples torrents. If you dont like it the go fuck yourself and download something else.
,glob0z,2010-04-28T05:47Z,"games like this sell millions of copies. compare that with thousands of people downloading. the huge corporations are worth hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars. most of us are worth whatever we have in the fridge. these copyright fanatics are just greedy cuz they aren't getting another 50 000 bucks. wah. so, suck it ransacker.

,MrErick,2010-04-28T21:02Z,"I had the game pre-ordered for 2 months. The game installed, but the game fails to load up because I need to ""verify that you are connected to the internet."" Steam users are able to load the game, but not play co-op. Me, and everyone with the retail box version, can't do anything.
I wanted to call the Tech Support, but it's a local number from North Carolina and there is not even an email contact in the box or on their website."
[T],Knaster,2010-04-28T21:50Z,MrErick it's probably a verification to see if the game has been released. Perhaps it will work tomorrow.

,ace_119,2010-04-30T23:15Z,how do you download skidrow crack?
,r2007uk,2010-05-01T23:05Z,"So the game launches and runs fine as far up to when you kill the first 3 thugs, my game does not crash but there is one problem i do have.

The sound of dialog is practically almost mute? like at the intro when he is on the phone i do not hear any talking and when you with the sarah in the house there is very very quiet/no talking

I tested and changed the sound settings around but to no avail does anybody else have this problem or know how to fix it?

I am using a 5.1 speaker setup (however during the test it only recognises 2 speakers left and right, therefore i changed it to 2.1 yet there is still no dialog sound..)"
,r2007uk,2010-05-03T00:09Z,"I would like to futher add comment to those that had the same talking/sound issue I had (with realtek hd audio).

I fixed this earlier today it took me quite some time but what i basically did was disconnect all the speakers and cables and cleaaned the jacks (don't overlook simple things like this!)

I then uninstalled all audio/realtek associated program % drivers then downloaded the latest ones which can be found easily on google (mine was actually from gigabyte)

having installed the latest drivers/reboot i then proceeded to launch the realtak audio manager and THEN connect all my speakers etc back to the pc associating the speakers witht he correct jack i.e centre/front/rear.

made sure that I set my option to 5.1 and THEN enabled 'speaker fill' and 'bass management'. then i went to the sound effects tab and picked one which sounded ok (for me generic).

the next step was to go to the room correction tab where you can increase the individual volume levels for each speakers, in this circumstance i only increases the 'rear' speakers volume.

Now once all that is set when i tested my sound I WAS getting sound from all speakers, therefore i loaded the game and then went into audio settings, changing it to 5.1 from 2.1 (default) and again tested it.. and this time I WAS able to hear sound in each speaker..

Now the last thing was I lowered the ingame 'background/music/etc' so that the speaking would not be 'overpowered' by the rest of the game noise..

Hey presto!! I got sound and am fucking loving this game thus far!!

Hope i helped you guys with this problem feel free to copy&paste this everywhere so we can all enjoy this game! "
