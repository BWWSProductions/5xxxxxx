     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Ray Mears applies his expertise in bushcraft to track down
      some of the world's deadliest predators. He goes on the trail of
      the extremely rare white spirit bear along Canada's beautiful
      Northwest Pacific coast. Starting his search in the remote
      Mussel Inlet, he encounters grizzly bears feeding on salmon
      prior to hibernation. Realising that aggressive grizzly bears
      guard the best feeding spots, he moves to a smaller inlet where
      he believes evidence of black bears - which share a similar
      habitat to the spirit bear - will lead him to his quarry.
