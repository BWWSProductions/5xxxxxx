,zorchtorrent,2010-08-27T14:30Z,"As of 25 Aug 10, Kaspersky has gotten wise to the krk. Now when it updates, it tags the dll for deletion on reboot, and restores the original dll.
You can restore the krk, but after the next update, it will happen again. Pain in the ass to keep redoing the setup, but at least an update will still bring definitions up to date. "
