 thanx man"
,PHREEBO,2010-09-17T04:32Z,"Great quality for the size, looks like the source was legit, not that usual R5 bootleg trash. Good job, thanks. Wish they could all be this good.
The audio and Eng. soft-sub is in sync.
The video rip quality is as good as it get's for this size of x264/mkv. 
Tested on KMPlayer v2.9.4 & VLC 1.1.4
Thanks to all that contribute."
