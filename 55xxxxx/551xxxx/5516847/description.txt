I took the liberty of finding the songs since I'm inlove with this movie though several of them are hard to find

In my very own opinion it is probably the best movie of mid-late 80's ever; nothing compares to it not even the present movies

Take note: Angel wings are being manipulated by the famous puppeteer Mark Bryan Wilson; Good old special fx huh

Emmanuelle Beart's first american film; probably the most beautiful angel ever! "Who wouldn't fall inlove with you"-quote Jim Sanders (played by Micheal E. Knight)

Watch the movie over and over and fell inlove with it!

THANKS FOR SHARING & KEEP SEEDING! GODBLESS!
