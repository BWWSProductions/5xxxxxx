This causes a calamity to mankind, who have relied on the aid of robots so long. Unable to use robots, they cannot even create a vaccine for the epidemic. One month later, the infected robots go berserk, attack the city and take over control of various areas! As this happens, it's Dr. Wily who approaches Dr. Light. He claims to know how to create a vaccine necessary to restore the robots to normal, but the vaccine creating device has been stolen away by the out of control robots. Hearing this, Mega Man rises up to the challenge of getting the device back, in order to save the world from danger. As Mega Man sets off, his brother, Proto Man, shows up and offers his help. Together, the two of them set off to defeat this menace from outer space!"
