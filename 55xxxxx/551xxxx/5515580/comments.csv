WTF are you talking about? You can pickup Snow Leopard at the Apple Store for $29. I bought a legit disc that I use for my hackintosh, I mean c'mon, it's $30. I do like the idea of a disc with 10.6.3 built in, so this will come in handy."

,albert8884,2010-06-20T03:06Z,can someone tell me how to burn this on a PC and boot up from it on a mac? what software should i use?
,amivoytec,2010-07-12T18:01Z,@albert8884rnBurn the ISO with ImgBurn application on dual layer DVD. Nextly put burned disc to your Mac and go ahead. It\'s so simple. :-)
,snowy51,2010-07-13T11:10Z,no to boot up a retail you must use a bootloader like empire efi or a boot-132 cd
,johnbinsc,2010-07-25T06:55Z,Only 789MB on DLDVD iso.  Only has the setup for remote install from real distro dvd in another system.  Also includes Boot Camp.  Is not a distro of the OS.
,johnbinsc,2010-07-25T11:54Z,I take it back.  My bad.  When I look at it on a Mac you can see the OS X software.  It must be some kind of dual format or mode. The part I could see in windows was different than the part I can see in Mac. Definitely says 10.6.3.
,capnjazz,2010-09-01T07:41Z,@johnbinsc : the 800mb you see is a PC-compatible partition containing boot camp. The rest of the ISO is a bootable Mac partition.
