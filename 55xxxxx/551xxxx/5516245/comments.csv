Hi , This is no joke mate, It is a humble request from a fellow pirate.

Since you are one of the class uploader , I thought of asking you to do this for all the fellow pirates here in TPB.

I saw DIARY OF A WIMPY KID in a website, I just want you to check out if it is real. If it is real then i wish you could upload it here in TPB... , I dont want to write the link here cause it will be considered as a scam. 
The below image shows the entire thing ... Just open the below images and you will get all the info... Thanks mate... Cheers to all your ups.
