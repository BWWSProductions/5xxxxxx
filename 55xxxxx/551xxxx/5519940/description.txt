Memory Lanes: pilot episode 

Following the death of their father, two estranged half-brothers inherit a struggling bowling alley and all the local eccentrics that work and play there. 

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is decent in my opinion. This pilot aired on April 27, 2010 on CBC in a gap of the NHL broadcast schedule. I haven't found any information that indicates whether this show will have more episodes.

Ryan Stiles played Dr. Herb Melnick on Two and a half Men, Lewis Kiniski on The Drew Carey Show and himself on Whose Line Is It Anyway?

Other actors include Janet Wright (who played Emma Leroy on Corner Gas) and Janet Varney (who played Amy Miller in 3 episodes of Entourage)
