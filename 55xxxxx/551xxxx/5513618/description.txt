From wikipedia:

Not to be confused with Beck.

Geoffrey Arnold "Jeff" Beck (born 24 June 1944) is an English rock  guitarist. He was one of the three noted guitarists which include Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, to have played with The Yardbirds. He was ranked 14th in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"

MSNBC has called Beck a "guitarist's guitarist" and Rolling Stone Magazine has described him as "one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock".

Much of Beck's recorded output has been instrumental, with a focus on innovative sound and his releases have spanned genres ranging from blues-rock, heavy metal, jazz fusion and most recently, an additional blend of guitar-rock and electronica. Beck has earned wide critical praise; furthermore, he has received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance five times. Although he has had two hit albums (in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck has not been able to establish and maintain a broad following or the sustained commercial success of many of his collaborators and bandmates.

Beck appears on albums by Roger Waters, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Zucchero, Cyndi Lauper, Brian May and ZZ Top. He also made a cameo appearance in the movie Twins (1988) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito and Nicolette Larson.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 4 April 2009. The award was presented by Jimmy Page.
