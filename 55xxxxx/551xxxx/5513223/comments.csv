,Stansa2,2010-04-24T22:51Z,WOW! Sweet! First one to download and Comment! Sweet!
,fanbayfan1,2010-04-24T23:20Z,"Something weird about this. This is an HD file. 45 mins of HD content should be around 1GB or so (give or take the compression), not 350mb!

Last week's EZTV HDTV of episode 3 was over 1GB. 

This week's episode at 350mb is far too compressed, surely?"
,fanbayfan1,2010-04-24T23:26Z,"If the picture quality is too compressed I reckon it's worth waiting for someone to upload a larger file - approximately 700mb to 1.5gb. That will give you much high definition resolution picture quality.

I've never seen a 45 mins HD content file at 350mb with decent video quality. Then again, perhaps compression technology has improved over the last week? :P "
,gprrchs,2010-04-25T00:32Z,"fanbayfan1, stupid prk, dont talk if u dont know anything. all eztv torrents are 100% real and top quality, and they are 45 min-350 mb-hdtv, the bigger files are bluray quality.
tnx ez ur the best always.

,123Crows,2010-04-25T01:46Z,"EZTV usually uploads different size versions of the same program - which is very cool.
The 350MB files are very watchable.
(Obviously you get more definition with the larger files.)

Anyway - 3 cheers for EZTV!"
,thankssomuch,2010-04-25T04:19Z,"well, I'll download this one because eztv reliably gives me everything i need, south park, lost, etc. You're welcome to wait for a better version but there's no read to try and educate folks, fanbayfan1 - you come across as pretensious when you do so."
,Occam1,2010-04-25T07:47Z,"Ah, my weekly Doctor fix - cheers!"
,cow_man,2010-04-25T09:43Z,It's good

Incorrect. If you don't beleive me, download this version and compare the picture quality:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5513136/doctor_who_2005.5x04.time_of_the_angels.720p_hdtv_x264-fov.mkv

The larger size file will be much better picture quality. I'm not wishing to be critical of EZTV, all the previous EZTV Doctor Who episodes of the new series are over 1gb in size  - which proves my point!"
,fanbayfan1,2010-04-25T12:09Z,"""u're welcome to wait for a better version but there's no read to try and educate folks, fanbayfan1 - you come across as pretensious when you do so.""

I didn't mean to educate folks in a pretentious way. If you want to see this new episode in the closest quality to how *it's meant to look* then download the 1.3gb version. If you don't care about the HD looking less HD then download this version. But I'm sure most people would prefer the larger size assuming they can wait a bit longer when downloading it!

You try to help people! Sheesh, I dunno why I bother. LOL"
,supz,2010-04-25T13:00Z,"fanbayfan, what the fuck are you talking about?  The HDTV in the title of this torrent relates to the source from whence it came.  This isn't an HD file compressed into 350mb at all.  There is a seperate 720p file released that's 1.09gb for that.  You're a fool."
,SnoGryphn,2010-04-25T15:56Z,"For some of us desperate Whovians, it takes over 3 hours just to download this 350 mb file (which is quite decent quality for the size).
So THANK YOU EZTV for making smaller files!!"
,lacey.fan2,2010-04-25T21:17Z,"Yeah, I don't know why you bother either, fanbayfan.  You do come off as prententious. You didn't offer help, your offered complaints.  And you didn't ""prove your point"" because eztv uploads both a 350 mb and a larger version, not just the higher quality ones.   Download it and enjoy it or don't and don't complain.  


Thanks eztv!  You do great work and I appreciate it."
,dksone,2010-04-27T14:27Z,"""The larger size file will be much better picture quality""
That's bullshit. With a good codec and good settings, you can achieve better quality at lower size..."
,08millerj,2010-04-29T04:25Z,when is the second part going to be aired and then upped? 
,08millerj,2010-04-29T04:28Z,why does it say 2005? it's from 2010 and i thought it was the Christopher Eccleston doctor who episodes at first. 
,supz,2010-04-30T04:33Z,"@08millerj - 2nd part airs on 1st May and will be upped around 8pm GMT.

The 2005 in the title means this is the rebooted series of Doctor Who that started in 2005 as opposed to the original series that started in 1963 and ended in 1989."
,tinny112,2010-05-09T13:18Z,great quality.
