      Preston to Morecambe - Documentary series in which Michael
      Portillo travels the country by train, taking a copy of George
      Bradshaw's Victorian Railway Guidebook, to discover how the
      railways changed us and what of Bradshaw's Britain remains. He
      explores the origins of the temperance movement in Preston,
      samples the attractions of Blackpool, a resort made by the
      railways, and takes a walk across Morecambe Bay with the
      official Keeper of the Sands.
