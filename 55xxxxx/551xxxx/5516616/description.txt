There are several versions of Assassin's Creed II available but most of them are with lots of complications.

Some versions wont allow us to play all sequences and some versions have emulator errors, Ubisoft game launcher errors and more.

Here is the solution to those seeking a clean version of Assassins Creed II.

Mount the iso file, install the game and play using the special launcher.

Ubisoft has created a strong DRM protection so that the game can only be played online. 

This special launcher creates a virtual ubisoft server so that the game connects to that fake server and can be played offline.

Emulator has the complete values.db to play all sequences.

I assure you there wont be any problems with this version.

If you are running a web-server, like apache, on your machine... or are using skype (with default port settings) you will have to disable both to free up port 80. Otherwise the server emulator can't work.
