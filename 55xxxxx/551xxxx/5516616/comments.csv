,navaneeth,2010-04-27T15:04Z,No need to register for an ubisoft account. You can play the game offline. Enter any desired username and password in the launcher. Your save games are linked to that username. Use the same username everytime you play.
,navaneeth,2010-05-01T19:02Z,"When you run the launcher a black emulator command window (showing some virtual ports open) appears along with an ubisoft login screen asking for username and password. Minimise the black window , enter your desired username, password and login through the other one. Don't click register. After clicking login another window appears which has an option to disable games to be saved online. Disable that. Your game will run fine till the end don't worry. This is the one and only clean version of ACII."
,MaglorAnarion,2010-05-01T21:42Z,Worked like a charm! Thanks!
,rapscallion412,2010-05-03T15:44Z,"This is the easiest crack I've ever used. Thank you for this wonderful work-around to Ubi's horrid DRM.

One thing to note. If you are running a web-server, like apache, on your machine... or are using skype (with default port settings) you will have to disable both to free up port 80. Otherwise the server emulator can't work."

It opened a DOS window and a small window with the assassin in it and started loading but after a few seconds it said that an internet connection was needed and that it cannot connect to the Ubisoft master server.

,navaneeth,2010-05-07T13:17Z,"Guys  those who messed up somehow resulting in ""An internet connection is required"" error

Make a clean reinstall of ACII again (though it is frustrating) but don't launch the game

Open the Hosts file (C: Windows System32 drivers etc) in notepad and make sure these lines are there

127.0.0.1 static3.cdn.ubi.com
127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
127.0.0.1 onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1 orbitservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

Open Run
Type cmd and hit enter
Type ipconfig/flushdns in the command window that appears

Restart the pc and run the launcher in desktop as administrator

,swiftry,2010-05-08T05:16Z,"Hi, I'm having a problem. The game worked fine until the part where I go to Leonardo da Vinci to repair the broken blade. For some reason it hangs there, but i can access the game menu. I exit the game and restart, but the save file appears to have vanished. Have to start a new one one.

Has anyone been able to actually complete the game with this?"
