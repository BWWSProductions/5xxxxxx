     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Richard Hammond hosts another episode of TV's stupidest,
      brightest, most insane game show. Richard's co-host Amanda Byram
      is course-side in Buenos Aires as 20 foolhardy Brits tackle the
      purpose-built Argentinian course. There is a 10,000 prize for
      the winner and the additional plaudit of being crowned the Total
      Wipeout champion - and to get there all the winner has to do is
      master the Sucker Punch, the Big Red Balls, Crash Mountain,
      Dizzy Dummies and the Wipeout Zone.
