I've not got far into it, on the mission were you have too follow your mother and collect a box of paintings. Unfortunatly I cannot pickup the box! yes i am focused on the box, and yes im pressing the correct key, but all it does is the gently shove move, there seems to be no way too pick it up. It would be helpfull if someone can say they are using this crack and collected the box, so I can try and find out if its fixable."
,Tilatus,2010-04-23T17:55Z,"@lostlegends: I'm using this crack and had no trouble picking up the paintings. On the other hand I had trouble later picking up a body. I walked further away and then came back and pick up was succesful. I think it's a bug in the game, nothing to do with the crack.

So try walking away from the box and coming back to it and try different places to press the pick up button."
,lostlegends,2010-04-23T18:06Z,Cheers Tilatus will give it a go later
,therdman53,2010-04-24T09:05Z,"I bought the game and I have problems picking things up, You just have to move away from the object and try again, so it must be a game fault"
,lostlegends,2010-04-24T10:29Z,"It does seem too be a sort of game bug, and not a crack problem. It seems to depend mostly on how you press the key, if you hold it too long it bugs a quick tap always seems to work. Game seems quite good actualy, and now there is a crack out, I think I'll actualy buy this one."
