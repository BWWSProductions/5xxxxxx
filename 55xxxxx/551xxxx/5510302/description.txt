Hum Hain Lajawab (The incredibles)

After proving to be a huge success worldwide, The Incredibles was dubbed in Hindi and it became the first animated Hindi movie to be exhibited in Indian cinemas. Its Hindi title Hum Hain Lajawab is translated into English is We are Amazing. Javed Jaffrey, a versatile Indian artist, wrote the script for dubbing apart from recording his voice for the character Sankiman, the villain.

The most distinguishing feature of this movie is that Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan recorded his voice for the pivotal role of Mr. Lajawab (Mr. Incredible). The real-life son of Shahrukh Khan, Aryan Khan marked his acting debut by lending his voice to the character of Tez Lajawab (Dash Parr), who happens to be the son of Mr. Incredible.

The dubbed Hindi version and the original English version were released simultaneously on 17 December 2004 in India. It was distributed by SPE Films.
