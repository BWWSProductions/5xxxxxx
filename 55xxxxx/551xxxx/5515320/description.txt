Wrapping up week three of the Mighty High Tour, The Mule, Mule Crew and fans found themselves at The Alabama Theater in Birmingham. Blind Man In The Dark came blasting out of the gate with Mr. High & Mighty right behind. The Brand New Angel that followed roared right into Mother Earth before the set took on a mellow tone with the tunes Painted Silver Light, No Need To Suffer and Little Toy Brain. The set ended with a powerhouse combo of Sco-Mule and the medley of I Think You Know What I Mean-> When The Levee Breaks-> I Think You Know What I Mean. Set two got underway with I'll Be The One and a rousing Banks Of The Deep End. Fool's Moon, rarely seen, made it's way through to Fallen Down which in turn made it's way into The Other One Jam. Out of Drums, this set got really interesting with Tastes Like Wine and a stunning Larger Than Life that abruptly halted, then moved on to If 6 Was 9 before slowly segueing back into Larger Than Life. Soulshine was chosen as the set ender and A Million Miles From Yesterday joyously closed out the night and the week.
