This is the RiffTrax commentary for Avatar, embedded within the movie.

RiffTrax are like MST3K, for recent movies (and done by the same people as MST3K).



****This is NOT just the movie.   Do Not complain about the RiffTrax, when you just wanted the movie.  You should have read the description first.**********
