I'm sure you are."
,NewsCat,2010-04-26T02:26Z,"There's an issue with the subtitles, either the whole movie is subtitled or none of the translated ""alien"" shows up."
,Mikxkid,2010-04-29T23:02Z,If anyone is kind enough to do this for the Lost pilot it would be great
,witheringsanity,2010-05-05T13:36Z,"looks great, sounds great. man i could not have stomached this movie without mike and kevin... so dull. and yeah there are subtitles for the whole thing, but you get used to them"
,darknessv,2010-05-22T00:03Z,"ooooooooooooooooooooomg!
this sure is gonna be fun :D"
,sindragosa,2010-10-31T20:59Z,"Such lame and unfunny commentary... I can't understand why people would pay $3 or donate to listen to shit like this. Just grab your best buddy and it's gonna be way funnier listening to him comment on the movie, rather than these ""professionals"".
Such wasted bandwidth and 2 hours, haven't heard one funny comment, I'm happy I'm not one of those people that pay for this crap."
