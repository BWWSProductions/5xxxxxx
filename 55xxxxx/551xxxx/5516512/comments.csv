,Porkster,2010-05-05T02:11Z,This series is pure fantasy. Harry Potter style.  Well evolution theory is fantasy.
,UKRich,2010-05-06T04:13Z,"@ Porkster.
You're a dick! The so called fantasy aspect is probably the same thing that close minded, like minded dicks like you were saying about breaking the sound barrier. space travel and colour pictures, a century ago!
BTW Evolution ""theory"" stopped being a theory and became accepted by most of us a universal truth when we passed 6th grade. Congrats on being an avid Harry Potter watcher and/or reader!"

,Spazmungus,2010-05-18T12:01Z,"very poor encode, also the commercial cutting looks like it was done by a two year old and cuts out part of the program. If you're going to do something then at least do it half decently."
,gravity92,2010-06-12T18:43Z,"Haha @UKRich, even Darwin himself admitted the theory of evolution was only a theory. Its never even been proven in any way"
