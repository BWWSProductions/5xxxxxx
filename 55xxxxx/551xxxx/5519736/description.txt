				Summary:
				 
				A rib-tickling regime of international and local 
				hilarity, the Cadbury Crunchie Comedy Gala 2010 
				unites over 20 acts on one stage. Hosted by the 
				ever-charismatic Rove McManus (Rove), the Cadbury 
				Crunchie Comedy Gala includes: 
				
				Jimeoin (AUS), whose last performance at the 2008 
				Cadbury Crunchie Comedy Gala brought the house 
				down with the mere flinches of his eyebrows, 
				alongside the intricacies of washing machines.
				
				Heath Franklins Chopper (AUS), returning to New 
				Zealand to see how the f**king hell we are, 
				offering up his words of wisdom and informing us 
				why we should Make Dead History.
				
				From Cripple Creek, Colorados very own Wilson 
				Dixon (USA) returns with his laconic country 
				songs and always-deadpan delivery.
				
				And some of New Zealands finest comedians will 
				also come out and play, with TV3s Jeremy Corbett, 
				Ben Hurley and Dai Henwood taking a break from 7 
				Days to enlighten fellow Kiwis, whilst Ewen Gilmour 
				helps citizens understand Aucklands new super city.
				
				
				Rippers Notes:
								
				Rove!
