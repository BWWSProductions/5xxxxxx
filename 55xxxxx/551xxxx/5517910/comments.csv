,elax666,2010-04-27T19:37Z,"God damn! WhatÂ´s wrong with people!?! This is ridiculous, (this thing with the whiners I meen, not U torrentzone), check yourself be4 U all start with your whining... Thanks 4 sharing and keep up the excellent work U do!"
,DeanMachine16,2010-04-28T05:06Z,"Obviously something strange is going on here.
I've never had any problems DLing torrentzone01's stuff before but both this one and the 24 one came out as fakes after my DL was complete.
Seems the same thing has happened with half the people here.
Also both torrents have an ungodly number of seeders, the same kind of numbers we've all seen that Anonymous piece of shit spam TPB with in the last few weeks.

Methinks something is afoot here and it's not torrentzone01's fault."
,blue_fox1,2010-04-28T22:17Z,why the -2 quality?
,USMC4LIFE,2010-05-12T23:18Z,"Some of you people are too stupid to be on the Internet without adult supervision.

Thank you, torrentzone01."
