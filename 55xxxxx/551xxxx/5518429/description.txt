PLOT
Supernatural traditions collide in this low-budget horror film from Mexican-American actor-director Damian Chapa. Chapa stars as Native American David Thunder, who summons up his ancestral spirituality to battle evil spirits when he finds out that his pregnant wife, Julieta (Natasha Blasik), comes from an aristocratic family of devil-worshipers and has nefarious purposes for him and their unborn child.
