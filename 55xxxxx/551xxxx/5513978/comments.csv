,SimsJohn,2011-05-19T10:22Z,"Has anyone noticed that these have been edited quite heavily from the original?  Punctuation is missing in several places, as are italics for characters internal thoughts.

I appreciate the effort put into making these ebooks, but at least you could be true to the original.

Does anyone know where I can find a  copy of these that isn't missing key punctuation and italics (not to mention questionable spelling of some words...)?

Otherwise I might just go buy it at a bookstore."
