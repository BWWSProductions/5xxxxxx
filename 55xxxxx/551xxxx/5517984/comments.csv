did you even bother to look at the files in this torrent?  They are clearly not RARed.  It used to bug me too that TvTeam used to RAR the files, which leads to less seeders because people unrar to watch the video and then delete the original files, which removes any potential for seeding.  

That said, if you read the nfo files for the TvTeam uploads now, they clearly state No-RAR releases.  So they're not RARing files anymore.  I don't think you should jump to the conclusion they were doing it out of nefarious reasons.  They just probably uploaded the RAR files as they received them from USENET rather than taking the extra step to UNRAR the files.  

So bascially, stop being a dick.  If you're going to hurl unfounded accusations, at the very least, make sure they're partly true, which isn't the case here if you bothered to read the descrption above and look at the file list, which clearly shows no RAR files.

Thanks TvTeam.. probably a bot but appreciate the uploads nonetheless.

Thanks"
