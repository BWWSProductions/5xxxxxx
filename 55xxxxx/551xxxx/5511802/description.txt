For those who liked 'Bleep' and 'Secret', Cognition Factor is an experiment in conscious cinema, during which the viewer is guided through a narrated virtual world in search of answers to the questions relating to the human experience.

Cognition Factor stitches live conversations with Terence Mckenna, brother Dennis Mckenna, Ralph Abraham, Rupert Sheldrake, Ralph Metzner, Alex Grey and top thinkers of our times into the plot.

The interviewees speak from within virtural worlds, (by Jack Gallagher), and are backed by original compositions from top international musicians and composers, including Lx Paterson, Dom Beken and Phil Le Gonedic, of The ORB, Merv Pepler (EatStatic/Ozrik Tentacles), Colin Angus& Matt Catt (The Shamen/Pablo_Sandoz), Steve Hillage (System 7), brought together by South African ambient composer performer and originator, Mike Martin - Indidginus.

Facing our deepest fears with hope and understanding, Cognition Factor seeks a new way of presenting word, picture, music and opinion to increasingly informed audiences.

Cognition Factor has been independently produced by Headspace Studios. Filmed in HD with a 5.1 surround soundtrack, it will also be available in the new Blu-Ray format. Trailer below.
