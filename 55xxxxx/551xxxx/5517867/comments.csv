,Ubung,2010-04-28T21:37Z,I can confirm the game does work. However the guy talking about the acheivments is correct. Everytime you exit the game your gold and acheivments are lost. This means you cant get any of the extra stuff from the shop.
,Hypotermi,2010-04-28T22:08Z,"Make sure to run the game with admin rights. Otherwise, it will crash right after Razors intro."
,Bio_Hazard68,2010-04-29T01:50Z,"@ubung

I figure it will be fixed with the 1.03 patch. So i guess we will just have to wait till the new patch and crack are released. I could be wrong ofcourse, but heh i hope i'm not. Other than that minor little thing missing the game works great. I found if i ran the launcher in admin the first time after that i wouldn't ned to. Not sure if that will help anyone, but it worked for me. Also to anyone who downloaded the demo version of this game, check to make sure you do not have the ubisoft launcher still installed. I have a feeling that could be causing some people issues."
,valiantomer,2010-04-29T11:24Z,"@0n1n3
You sir are a piece of shit. You dont have to brag like an asshole if the game doesnt work or you dont like the game. An screw your self man. Razor1911 is the reason that this game was made available in the first place"
,Ubung,2010-04-29T14:43Z,"@Bio_Hazard68

I dont think its that. With the game supposed to be connected 24/7 I beleive the acheivments and gold are not stored locally. So when you exit the game and your local cache is removed then there is nowehere to store your info. hence it dissapearing. Im hoping Razor can fix this though. (if indeed it is this).

@0n1n3

First of all just  because it doesnt work for you doesnt mean it doesnt work. Second you havnt even tried to fix whats wrong with your pc before labelling it broken. Third, dont be an ass, acting the fool will get you in trouble one day.

As for your issue do you have an ATI card? I do and I had to install  driver version 10.3 (had 10.2 before) or mine would crash to desktop as well. I reccomend updating your graphics driver anyway then trying again."
,Kazhy,2010-04-29T14:45Z,"The crack works great. Loved their intro :D

But the game itself keeps freezing for me every 4-5 minutes for a few seconds. I'm hoping future patches will fix it and that razor will be able to crack them too"

Thats from the NFO. Its not their crack its the game."
,loadstone007,2010-04-29T18:31Z,"Thanks Razor for this, you are the best!

Annoying problem: The game freezes every 5 mins for about 20 secs. And it didn't happen when using an experimental server emulator. Hopefully there will be a fix soon."

,unrealdj,2010-04-29T18:42Z,"p.s.
Guess I shouldve specified.
The UPlay content.
Also has more content in addition to whats in the ingame unlocker, which is just fkin stupid anyway even for retail players. Why seperate fkin unlockable sections if they're all for free. De de de ubi. My god, good game but some idiots designing the content for sure."

It seems once you get a pretty huge area for yourself (like 12+ sectors), the storehouse's and additional contructors cease to work, for medium small games this is flawless. But I waited 20 minutes for ONE stone to get to a store house, nothing else being built, no other upgrades, no interference etc and 20 minutes that 1 stone i needed never came.
sometimes saving/reloading works, but now that I'm up to 16 sectors for myself that doesn't work anymore either."

Look if you want to make this site better just like Demonoids then just set your upload to 20KB/s that's all it takes, its not asking a lot.

,Ubung,2010-04-30T14:34Z,"@Kazhy

Yeah im sorry I misread what you posted. Thought you meant you wanted a crack from razor to improve it.

Also to clarify although the gold is reset everytime you log in you can use the infinite money cheat which allows you to buy most of the items. Although this also isnt saved when you log out so you have to buy the items each time you start the game.

Your acheivments are also not saved. This means that all the content is available except for the UPlay items. Albeit with a little hassle."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-30T20:22Z,"So, let me get this straight; this game is buggy as hell, it can't patch or update, nothing you do saves, you're limited in the actual game play, and you lose all your money and achievements the second you log out?

So why again is everyone downloading it? lol

It looks cool, though. If all this shit gets fixed then i'll d/l, till then, why the fuck bother. O_o"

@naffnaff - Yeah, then someone said when u log off you lose everything, and have to do the money cheat and buy all achievements again and again. This true?

Like i said, there's three pages of these same complaints, and not by whiny complainers, by actual players. If they get fixed i'll d/l this game for sure. Or if someone can tell me all those are false(which i doubt they are)."
,nooberoid,2010-05-01T02:35Z,"D/L AGAIN

,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-05-01T03:01Z,"@nooberoid -- Use WinRar and extract the first file, which is ""rzr-set7.001"". The rest will follow in succession. Then you will have your files to install.

,Ubung,2010-05-01T15:15Z,"@EvilCorporateWhore

Im gonna make a list for ya, youve misread whats been said and splashed it around that its not working putting other people off. This is not a good thing stop being an ass.

1) You can save your progress in the campaign or castle editor or map editor.
2) The game loads flawlessly but you need the latest graphics driver (10.4 for ATI).
3) You cant patch it but really you cant patch any game until that patch is cracked. 
4) There is a bug where 13+ sectors can cause your guys to stop going where they are supposed to go but most games wont be that big. You can do the campaign or smaller skirmishes till this is fixed.
5) You do lose money and acheivments and anything youve purchased at the shop when you log out. Most of it is castle builder parts which save if youve used em on your castle. Or AI opponents which is easy to buy if you need them. Lastly prestige items which are already in the main game these just look different. Nothing to stop you enjoying the campaign here. Just click F1 on the razor screen and buy everything you need.
6) Finally because of the not saving acheivments part you cant get the Uplay items which is a smaller section of things similar to the shop.

So the game is playable and fully working as long as you dont mind a little hassle while you buy the shop stuff and you do the campaign or smaller skirmishes."
,Ubung,2010-05-01T15:18Z,"7) The autosave pause every 10 mins is a game thing not a crack thing, im sure razor are working on that right now. (1.3)"

Just accept the fact that you aren't the only talented crackers in the field, and continue to strive and show that you are the best. That's what the scene was, and still should be, about.
Attacking Skidrow for (successfully) using a shortcut in their technique for AC II is ridiculous. It works; game is playable, the end.

For all newbies:

1. download the Settlers
2. now you see a lot of files in the The Settlers folder, you need to extract (unpack) those files with winrar you can download winrar for free just google... 

When you have installed winrar go to the Settlers Folder press on the first file with your right (second) mousebutton and choose ""open with"" and pick winrar

3. A window from winrar pops up and you see on top the Unpack to...  button, press on it, and choose a location where you want to place the unpacked file, now your unpacked file should be rzr-set7.iso

to install you need daemon tools, its free software google it too and download/install 

4. After starting daemon tools you see on the bottom right side where your windows vista/7 clock is the daemon tools icon press on that little icon with your second (right) mousbutton on it and choose virtual devices... and mount the ISO file

5. Go to Computer and you should see where your DVD drive is a 2nd virtual drive, just autorun the Game

6. After complete install open the CD again and you will see a razor1911 folder, insdie you will find the 1.02 Patch + Crack... first patch the game and then copy the files from the crack folder and overwrite them in your C: Program files/Ubisoft/The Settlers

Start the Game as an administrator

hope this helps!!"

,unrealdj,2010-05-05T06:13Z,"lol this is actually a pretty solid game.
Why listen to me? Well, I've been playing tactical strategy games since I was 8 >.>, I'm 28 now, played when only ""nerds"" played games, which ironically I am not :D. 

Anyway to the point.
Good game, few issues but not many that a common player will see except the freezing, which is a game issue not a crack issue, goto UBI's crap support forum for answers on that. Or just wait for 1.03 to get cracked.

My only issue with this game, as of now, is the AI on hard is incredibly weak if you survive the initial rush towards you. If you decide to bum rush the AI right back ignoring other sectors shooting for their main city they will not defend it for shit, just sit in other sectors watching you slowly take over their main city (and therefor elimnating them from the game).

I like rushing like this, the AI shouldn't just freaking ""let"" me take their main city so easy, especially on hard......

,syntexNL,2010-05-05T14:08Z,"
Both   of   Skidr0w's   releases   show  us they haven't had a look (probably
even  didn't  find)  the  actual  protection  code and everything hints on em
using  parts   of  publicly  collected  'challenge/response'  pairs.  Luckily
Assassin's   Creed  II is probably the only  target  ever where this approach
of  'emulating'  the  server by a  static lookup will  yield  any  measurable
success   (due   to   a   basic   design  flaw in  an otherwise  pretty  neat
idea  of  software  protection).  In  fact, we  considered this  approach  as
generally  too  unreliable  and  'unworthy' of a scene crack,  so  we  didn't
care   about   doing   it.   Instead   we  opted  for going for the arguably
most     challenging    implementation    of    Ubisoft's   new   DRM   first
(emulating   actual   server-side   game  code).  So  here  it  is: The first
Ubisoft DRM crack!

,Xathyboy,2010-06-17T01:47Z,"Thx!

A really nice game could have been longer since the campaign only lasted 2 days for me =/.

Easy instructions to follow and therefore easy to get started with. The problems with this game is not the cracks fault but rather ubisoft and blue byte.

Everything worked fine for me except for 2-3 crashes until the last map were everything just started freezing up every 1-2 sec. I rolledback my drivers and it became less irritating because it only stopped for 0.1 sec instead of 0.5-1 sec every time it wanted to freeze the game.

Will buy this game if they fix the ATI problems but not if they still remain in the near future, but I guess that won't happen. 

So follow the notes and you should be fine, and also if you have ATI-drivers beware! Things might get really nasty for you in the world of Tandria!"

This crack only works on patch 1.02. I don't think it'll work on later patch as we wait for someone to make a crack for later patch. The update should already be in the folder and the crack also so all you have to do is update your game to patch 1.02 then apply the crack file to your original file replacing it. You may need to run administer first time. For me I didn't press Esc what I did was alt+tab then close it from there and it should work. Don't know why pressing esc won't work on me but yep this should work. Sorry if you want to play later version cause so far as i know there is no crack for later patch.

,xXLuneXx,2011-06-15T22:01Z,"NOTE: There is an extension file located in the Crack folder continuing into more sub folders called; ""1911.dll"". If you have an anti-virus it may remove this extension file, therefore making you unable to launch the game. So I suggest you to make a back-up of it on an external storage drive such as a USB.

TO CONFORM; It is NO VIRUS, since anti-viruses tend to think of debug files as suspicious files. If your anti-virus continuously detects this file as a threat, go into your antivirus settings and make this file an exception so it does not remove it every time you have your anti-virus on. 

One more thing to conform, once you launch the game the razor screen will appear and go into a continuous loop. At this point just press the esc button and you will be redirected back to the game launcher. 

Hope this helps. :]"
