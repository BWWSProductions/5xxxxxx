As the title suggests, Influenceâ€¦ is based around the psychology behind the tools used by what Cialdini describes as â€œcompliance professionalsâ€ (from salesmen to fundraisers to advertising folks). Despite the potentially dense subject matter, Cialdini approaches it in easy-to-understand terms which you donâ€™t need a Ph.D. to absorb.

The book covers six â€œweapons of influenceâ€ in turn, doing a deep dive on the variations and nuances within each before examining how to avoid their effects:

1. Reciprocation â€“ giving a little in order to take more
2. Commitment and consistency â€“ playing off our internal need to be consistent with ourselves
3. Social proof â€“ the power of what other people are doing
4. Liking â€“ positive associations
5. Authority â€“ amazing what weâ€™ll do for someone who appears to be in authority
6. Scarcity â€“ we want things more when they are few
