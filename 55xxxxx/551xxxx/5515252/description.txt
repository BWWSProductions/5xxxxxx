Yes ... I'm back.  I knew I would start uploading again when the second season of 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' was coming close to an end, so I figured I'd come back with a huge smash like this film -- which is truly one of the biggest films in history.  Avatar has made more money than any other film in history, it now holds the records for not only most money, most opening day money, most opening weekend money, and biggest release day DVD and Blu Ray sales as well. In case you haven't seen it, here's what I've got to say:

You should see it.

Like most of my other HDRips, I've used a blu-ray source, and I've hardcoded English subtitles into the video stream so the Na'vi speaking parts will show up in English -- for those of you who didn't run out and learn the language.  The rip is very high quality, and looks amazing on all the devices I tested it on (iPod Touch, iPod Classic, Zune, and I streamed it over to my 360 as well).  Supposedly (rumored), there will also be a 'special edition' released of this film which includes an additional six minutes of footage, including a sex-scene between the two Na'vi main characters.  If this 'special edition' is true and is actually released, I'll probably do an encode of it as well.  For now though, this is probably the best quality iPod version available.  Because I strive for high quality rather than miniscule file size, a nearly-three-hour film like this one does end up being about 1.6GB in size, but this is easily comparable to the 3-CD scene DVDRips and IMO ... mine looks and sounds better too.

TRIVIA:
1.  When Sully tells the Mo'at he is 'empty', it might be a U.S. Marine reference.  It has long been a part of U.S. Marine training that new recruits are to think of themselves as empty-headed soldiers ready to be filled with the knowledge of how to become a 'lean, mean, killin' machine'.  This is also where the term 'Jarhead' originated.
2.  When Sully becomes a man in the eyes of the Na'vi, Neytiri begins telling him about the women of the tribe, telling him that 'Ninet is a great singer.'  This is possibly a direct reference to one of Israel's leading pop singers Ninet Tayeb who was also the first winner of Israel's version of 'American Idol'.
3.  Avatars have eyebrows and five fingers and toes, whereas the Na'vi people have no eyebrows and only four fingers and toes.  Also, the Avatars tend to be broader in the chest and more muscular.  This, along with their supposed difference in smell, is how the Na'vi so easily identify Avatars.  Also, Avatars tend to dress more like humans.
4.  In the final battle, Neytiri's war paint features a white handprint with five fingers, implying the print is Jake's, since only Avatars have five fingers.
