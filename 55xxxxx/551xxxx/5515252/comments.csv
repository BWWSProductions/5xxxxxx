,romeox145,2010-04-26T07:46Z,hey VOV thank you so much for this movie. i was wondering if you were ever going to do District 9? you talked about it.  is it posted on another site?
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-04-26T09:01Z,"I did eventually get a working 853x copy of District 9 encoded with the hardcoded subtitles for the 'prawn' language scenes ... I just probably never got a chance to upload it.

I'll try and see if I can upload it later this week maybe."
,slats649,2010-04-26T14:48Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-03T02:09Z,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid is probably only available in CAM / TS quality right now.

As far as I know, not even a Screener has been leaked/ripped.

I actually haven't seen it yet, but I've heard good things.  If it's actually any good, I'll probably upload it when the bluray rip gets released."
,Reeb0k,2010-05-13T19:29Z,Love your work. Can you make on for Alice in Wonderland? I'd happily appreciate it. 
,zver999,2010-06-18T19:54Z,"this has fucked up container AR, unusable on HTC Desire"
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-11-02T10:30Z,"@zver999

I don't even know what a HTC Desire IS ... and nowhere does it SAY in my description that it works on one ...

Sorry.  My ""Fucked Up Containers"" are what squeezes in all the extra quality without actually increasing the file size as much as it normally would for a higher bitrate.  And since they work on the Zune, iPods, and iPhones as well as PS3 and X-Box 360 ... it covers most of the POPULAR devices.

Sorry it doesn't work on your device made by a developer no one had heard of two years ago."
,jrocsexy2000,2010-12-26T00:53Z,played this and there are no subtitles please help
,jrocsexy2000,2010-12-26T02:46Z,"Nevermind, I'm a littl bit of an idiot LOL "
