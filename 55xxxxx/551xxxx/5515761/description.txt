                    The Hide.                                
                    Foyle is finally given a date when he can  
                    relinquish his post as Detective Chief   
                    Superintendent, but when he spots a headline  
                    about a member of a distinguished local family  
                    sentenced to hang for treason, he realises that  
                    he might have one last case to explore. Foyle  
                    visits James Deveraux in his cell and and finds  
                    a damaged young man intent on self destruction.  
                    With time running out, he desperately searches  
                    for any evidence to clear Deveraux's name. This  
                    case means more to Foyle than any that he has  
                    previously undertaken and what he discovers  
                    shakes his personal world to the core.
