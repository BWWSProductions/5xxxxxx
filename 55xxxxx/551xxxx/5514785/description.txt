From Recorded Books:

One of Americaâ€™s most popular authors, Jodi Picoult has earned a reputation for crafting riveting, topical fiction. In House Rules she examines how being different can have dire consequences. 

Teenager Jacob Hunt has Aspergerâ€™s syndrome. A forensic science wizard, he follows his scanner to show up at crime scenes and give law enforcement officials his advice. But when his tutor is found dead, he becomes a suspect. Suddenly, his Aspergerâ€™s traitsâ€”not looking people in the eye, tics and twitchesâ€”look more like guilt to the investigators.
Suddenly Jacob and his moother are caught up in America's maddening legal system, which favors those who communicate a particular way.

As Picoult vividly depicts, being different can have dire consequences, and justice isn't blind for everyone. The tension mounts through a breathtaking, full-cast performance of this provocative novel.

"Picoult has become a master - almost a clairvoyany - at targeting hot issues and writing highly readable page-turners about them" --Washington Post

From jodipicoult.com:

HOUSE RULES is about Jacob Hunt, a teenage boy with Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome. Heâ€™s hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, and like many kids with AS, Jacob has a special focus on one subject â€“ in his case, forensic analysis. Heâ€™s always showing up at crime scenes, thanks to the police scanner he keeps in his room, and telling the cops what they need to doâ€¦and heâ€™s usually right. But then one day his tutor is found dead, and the police come to question him. All of the hallmark behaviors of Aspergerâ€™s â€“ not looking someone in the eye, stimulatory tics and twitches, inappropriate affect â€“ can look a heck of a lot like guilt to law enforcement personnel -- and suddenly, Jacob finds himself accused of murder. HOUSE RULES looks at what it means to be different in our society, how autism affects a family, and how our legal system works well for people who communicate a certain way â€“ but lousy for those who donâ€™t.
