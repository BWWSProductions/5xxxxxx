[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-26T09:10Z,Any modding of games is a very high risk of banning. Most because it easy to spot/notes.
,Charbis,2010-04-26T18:09Z,"Yeah, you shouldnt do this unless your prepared to be banned. No onbe wants to hear someone whinge about how they didnt know or werent told the risks. Mod content at your own risk."
