Baseball, more than any other sport, inspires widespread research and publication. The literature of 
baseball is vast and continues to grow at a fantastic pace. This second edition of Myron Smithâ€™s 
acclaimed Baseball Bibliography contains some 57,000 entries, bringing the 1986 book up to date with 
the tremendous body of baseball literature published in the last 20 years. The resulting four-volume 
set is the largest and most comprehensive non-electronic, non-database, print bibliography on any major 
American sport. Citations include books and monographs; scholarly papers; government documents; 
doctoral dissertations; mastersâ€™ theses; poetry and fiction; novels; pro team yearbooks; college and 
professional All-Star Game and World Series programs; commercially produced yearbooks; and periodical 
and journal articles, including the first-ever complete analysis of the major diamond-oriented contents 
of Baseball Magazine, Baseball Digest, Sport, Sports Illustrated, and ESPN: The Magazine, among others.
