Release Notes

The last "The Remix" release was a Japan exclusive. This, new revised
version with a completely new tracklist will see a release in the UK
on May 10, and the USA on May 11.

I'm not preing this iNT because I want it to spread. I don't like this
but I know alot of people do, so I want it to get around. However, I
am preing it SiREx so it doesn't go against our proper stats when it
gets nuked.

Greets to the one that moans at us for not preing enough pop
