,inianlion,2010-05-05T19:54Z,"ThePalindorme  
Its not same buddy. DDR team is dedicated to quality and SaM is their official uploader.

If this torrent was ripped by maaman there will be no issue. But it was ripped by DDR team. So the original ripper and the uploader must have to be credited for their work. This is how things roll here."
