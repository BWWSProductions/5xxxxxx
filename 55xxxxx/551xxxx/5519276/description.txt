     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Mary Portas took on a seemingly impossible challenge:
      dragging the forgotten, unloved charity shop into the 21st
      century. After five long months of toil and tears, she achieved
      a remarkable, lasting transformation, overhauling dismal
      donations and shocking stock and reinventing their dowdy stores.
      But she's not finished yet. Six months later, she's returning to
      add the last piece to the jigsaw, with an idea to overhaul the
      loyal but ageing workforce and bring in a new breed of
      volunteer.
