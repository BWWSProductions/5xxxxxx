I've never liked to watch episodes one every week. Sometimes you r skeeping it because you had some other things to do. And it's a nice opportunity to watch whole season whenever you have time for it."

,dsrs,2011-01-05T12:19Z,"no, the greek subs are in .srt files. in utorrent you can choose NOT to download these files, or just delete them later. if you have the .avi file and the .srt file in the same folder, vlc and other players will automatically play the subs. but you can turn them off in options...
thanks for this upload"
