Svolochi [aka. Bastards] 2006 Dvdrip.

English and Spanish subs inc. 


Ð¡Ð²Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ñ‡Ð¸, Svolochi is a 2006 Russian war film

The film, directed by Alexander Atanesyan, tells the supposedly true story of a group of teenage convicts given the choice by the Soviet high command to serve severe sentences or cleanse their past crimes in a highly dangerous guerrilla mission. It provoked a storm of controversy when it was released in Russia. Russian military and security bodies were horrified by claims the story was true. The Federal Security Service, successor to the KGB, said no such mission ever took place, and war veterans condemned it as an insult to the memory and sacrifice of real Red Army heroes.

At the awards ceremony there was a heated moment amongst believers and non believers that the event ever took place
