"
,Ecwfrk,2010-04-25T03:20Z,Patience people. Better a bit slow than not at all.
,kmaomnak,2010-04-25T09:46Z,"by the way everyone, if anybody has their upload speed set to like 10 or something, set it to unlimited or whatever, cause the fast yu upload while yu dl the faster everyone els dl and also uploads so there for everyone will get this game quicker and we can all play. and Arctic0ne, yur the man for this, thanks, ive been patient, i was dling for 23hours, then i paused to get boarderlands=] thank you again. but do you play left for dead  on a private server?"
,burkreka,2010-04-25T11:14Z,thats not entirely true.. uploading full connection capacity. at 90kbs. dl at 8kbs. with short bursts of up to 400kbs but only for short periods. i really hope all this is working properly now that i have to wait so long though :)
,Arctic0ne,2010-04-26T02:27Z,"@kmaomnak
That's actually true, but only partially. I am initial seeding the file, which means I am putting it all out there in hopes that the peers will fill in the gaps of everyone else, and eventually the full upload will be completed and mass seeding can start ;)

And, no, I don't play on private servers, I actually own the game, so I play with my Steam friends, and occasionally have LAN parties at my house. (But only with L4D1, I don't much like the new game, save for The Passing)

If you'd like to play online Google Setti, and click on the second link (This is the setup guide) I have made this very easy to do on my Demonoid upload, but TPB doesn't like outside links in descriptions :/"
,alex19589,2010-04-27T11:08Z,"@Arctic0ne
Come on man at least seed this so one of us gets 100% to seed back"
,Metalprofi,2010-04-27T13:22Z,"did anyone tried this??? i mean, till now no one has dl it...the worst torrent ever.Artcticone, i hope you rot in hell mmy friend.."
,alex19589,2010-04-27T18:49Z,"that's it, it died at 80.4 %. What's the point of uploading a file if you're not going to seed it? anyway I got another L4D2 with the passing, it's the repack at 1.5 G that works"
,alex19589,2010-04-28T17:18Z,crashes after intro movie and says that steam must be running. 
,novacheck240,2010-04-28T17:27Z,"I have the same problem.  When I start the game without steam running, it says steam is not running.  If I try to start it with steam running, it gives me permissions errors."
,Metalprofi,2010-04-28T17:59Z,"@novacheck240

,Metalprofi,2010-04-28T20:36Z,"@toksido 
which one, there are plenty of files...common dude, be specific"
,Metalprofi,2010-04-28T22:57Z,ok...its workin now
,Arctic0ne,2010-04-29T03:16Z,"It does work, that problem is because it is not patched all the way. Like I said, I fixed it for Demonoid, couldn't for TPB.

@Metalprofi
Bro, you have to calm down. Nobody will respect you on the scene if you act like that. If you have a problem present it in a polite manner, just because you have a problem doesn't mean everything is the uploaders fault. in fact, most of the time it is user error.
In this case the game needed to be updated, but TPB doesn't like outside links, so I couldn't help you guys out.

This is most likely my last release on TPB. They have no support for outside links, public sign ups make it a breeding ground for trolls and the like, and a like of moderation doesn't help that. I'll see you guys on Demonoid :D"
,alex19589,2010-04-29T11:39Z,Now it works.it just needs the Standalone patch to work without steam.
,Verkil,2010-04-29T15:39Z,"This copy works but you have to download standalone patch to make it non-steam. Could have been better if it works outright. Nevertheless, thanks."
,ravi84m,2010-05-05T19:15Z,"installing the patch will fix your problems guys.
i also had an error once i started the game."
,g4gerrard,2010-05-13T03:07Z,"does it work on 1280x1024x70hz??
cuz i can't pplay L4D2 cuz my screen ask video mode 1280x1024x60hz
and there's no option to change to 60hz

,aliensareus,2010-05-16T19:40Z,"Hey there people i dowloaded this torrent and extracted it. went to go and play it and and it would load the video and then kick me off saying tht i need steam. 

So i ended up dowloaded Steam and the 2.0.1.6 master update pack and now it says no permisson to run l4d2 =|

Can any help out or tell me a torrent where i dont need Steam to play?"
,skatkilla23,2010-05-22T19:33Z,"Well... downloaded it, extracted it, read the comments found out you have to get the standalone patch, found out the patch is for 1.0.8, only try updating it to 1.0.6 and...... says that installer integrity has failed and that there's incomplete download or damaged media. WTF!!!!!!"
,baremats91,2010-05-30T16:15Z,"1: unzip to your own folder
2: update with master update2.0.1.6
3: update with incremental update 2.0.1.6-2.0.1.7
4: update with incremental update 2.0.1.7-2.0.1.8
5: update with the standalone patch and then run the game :)

PS: don't update with the Incremental(Mini) Update Version 2.0.1.6-2.0.1.9
if you do that you can't update with the standalone patch and can't play"
,Michoooooo,2010-06-04T10:43Z,"hii I have left 4 dead 2 zipped so there is no installation i just extract it and it's already precracked and when i try to install the passing it says background error,anyone knows how to fix this? thnx"
,Left4fun,2010-06-14T13:31Z,"Hi, where can I find the 2.0.1.5 patch for this game, all I can find is 2.0.1.5 - 2.0.1.6
Its an update from 2.0.1.5 to 2.0.1.6
Please help"
,crazysoccerman14,2010-06-18T04:24Z,"Firstly, thanks Arctic!  

Secondly, this is a link to get you patched to the latest version and playing online.  http://blog.theevilpc.com/2009/11/how-to-update-and-play-left-4-dead-2-no.html

This torrent is already updated to 2.0.1.3, however the patch is dated now.  Download and run the .exe file that updates L4D2 from 2.0.1.3 to 2.0.2.2, you can find it on the page.  Lastly, run ""L4D2_Rev_Emu_for_v2020.exe"" (the file is on the site).  It allows you to play without steam.

Once all that is completed go to the ""rev.txt"" file in your L4D2 directory, double click and change your name.  The instructions for everything that I just said is in the link I provided.

Hope to see you on the servers!"
,dan_showbiz,2010-06-23T16:53Z,"thanks crazysoccerman14, but we can also update from 2.0.1.3 to 2.0.2.3 now with the file from the site you've linked us to, right?"
