,matelian,2010-04-28T20:46Z,"LoL, its like more than 10 people uploaded the game and the crack, that didnt even happen with AC2 and this game isnt really that game.

,matelian,2010-04-28T20:47Z,"isnt really that good*

sorry a typo :P"
,kaliver,2010-05-01T01:31Z,"i disagree, for a city builder that tries hard to take goofiness to a whole new level, it has pretty deep and compelling gameplay. it takes a long time for it to ramp up in the campaign, which i suspect is a turn off for some. if you aren't interested in all the mechanics and just want to satisfy your urge to play the newest thing (for five minutes) then it's definitely not going to be very rewarding."
,shinegun,2010-05-01T15:40Z,"I have a problem, I'm asking it everywhere. From 2 to 2 seconds it freezes and make the game impossible to play. My gc is 285 gtx(nvidia), i have an i7, win7 32 bit with everything updated, and the game works but this lag makes it impossible to play. Any help?"
,partychief,2010-05-02T13:15Z,"hey...where do i find the product key?? i have looked everywhere... i seem to have installed the game properly, and had to create an account at ubisoft...and now i need a product key to launch the game...anyone?"

,Torbax,2010-06-05T18:42Z,"This torrent works ;) 
But you still need to install another Update from Razor1911 ;) "
,blog21,2010-06-10T01:27Z,"it took ma a while to work it out but i saw a blurred video for a keygen for this game, so here is what i came up with, kjyg5-h225p-jxfl8-junl4-w27dc

,Titouf2609,2010-06-13T10:14Z,Where is the problem ?
,666_999,2010-06-23T16:48Z,"f-secure deleted a ""trojan"" right after the dowload and then i cant make the game run cuz it cant find 
1911.dll or ddl something. mabe the F-sec. think 1911.dll is a trojan and it deleted it? how can i fix this?"
,gamefreak12,2010-06-27T10:19Z,"i had the same problem as 666_999,if it is truly deleted you have to download it again, otherwise you have to look in the quarantine folder"
,la_cross37,2010-06-27T21:37Z,Do anyone know if or when there will be a crack for a later version of the game like version 1.05?
,Kirsz97,2010-08-12T20:01Z,Seed pls seed.
,Kirsz97,2010-08-14T16:29Z,who can tell me what the cd key?
,russxi,2010-08-22T17:39Z,"+1 Another Good one from Razor1911

No Virus!!! btw im using avast.

had some issue with the autosave function but fixed it with this torrent

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5639405/The_settlers_7_Autosave_fix_no_crash_for_patch_1.02
-just follow the instructions..

But sadly its still somewhat laggy when you play with 3 players and more.

and the achievements are not working but you can turn on the razor unlimited money and unlock the additional content in the store but you'd have to do that everytime you run the game because it restarts every time you close the app."
,Captain_Nuthak,2010-08-31T18:29Z,"It seems both versions of Razor1911's torrents seem to suffer from the freezing issues, which is cited in the install notes as ""Minor recurring freezes"" due to a broken auto-save mechanic. I tried looking into this and found ""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5639405/The_settlers_7_Autosave_fix_no_crash_for_patch_1.02"" which claims it will fix the freezes if your game is patched to v1.02 (This is the patch Razor1911 supplied themselves in my version). However my download for this ""fix"" always stops at near 89%, it's only like 120 kb so I don't know what the problem is.. Has anyone else figured this out?.."
,gianijoker007,2011-01-25T10:41Z,"there is a small patch for autosave on-off
its called s7loader
that fixes the freeze issue"
,paffelaf,2011-02-14T01:08Z,Anybody here has any clue of how we mac user will have to do ?
,skazilend,2011-02-17T18:38Z,"does settlers7 work on win7 64bit?

,sccr207,2011-07-18T02:44Z,Does anyone know if this works on Mac? Or anyway to get this game on Mac?
,Umppallumppa,2011-08-10T19:41Z,Works fine on win7 x64. Thanks :)
