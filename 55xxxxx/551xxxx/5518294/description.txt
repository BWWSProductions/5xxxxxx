In every society there are people who live on the fringe and must suffer the consequences. Some choose to be outsiders, but others are forced to be. In Nepal, leprosy sufferers are shunned and confined to colonies because of their disease. In India, rat catchers are despised because of the vermin they pursue. And in Australia, human scavengers feed on the food their city throws away. In this episode, we'll find out what it's like to live on the outside.
