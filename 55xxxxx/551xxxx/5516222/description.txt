Luciano Pavarotti, often cited as the world's finest operatic tenor, stars in this lavish production of Giuseppe Verdi's classic opera. Set in ancient Egypt, Aida concerns the romantic entanglement of military leader Radames, the beautiful Princess Amneris, and Aida, her slave from Ethiopia. Radames and Aida are in love with each other, but Amneris loves him too; what Radames does not know is that he has to choose between two Princesses, because Aida also comes from royal blood. Co-starring with Pavarotti in this production, produced by the La Scala Opera Company of Italy, are Ghena Dimitrova, Maria Chiara, Nicolia Ghiaurov, Paata Burchuladze, and Juan Pons.
