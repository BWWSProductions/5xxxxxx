,Rjd2626,2010-04-27T03:01Z,Can you put up a small sized seceret armory DLC for Borderlands?for xbox360 im downloading this torrent right now but i also want the seceret armory one too
,sigmareborn,2010-04-27T03:05Z,"no can do, this is the dlc ripped from the disc, this will work on ALL xbox 360's. if you want the armory you either have to pay for it, gameshare, or have a jtag'd xbox

because this was released on disc it isnt signed (kind of like the Fallout 3 DLC) whereas the armory is signed to your xbox"
,sigmareborn,2010-04-27T03:07Z,"no can do, as this content isnt signed by M$ (its ripped from the DLC disc) if you want the armory you have to either gameshare, pay for it, or have a jtagged 360... sorry"
,Rjd2626,2010-04-27T03:13Z,its cool man thanks so much for this dlc
,Rjd2626,2010-04-27T03:13Z,can you put some fallout DLC up?
,Rjd2626,2010-04-27T03:15Z,I really want the Fallout 3 DLC that continues the game after your done and raises the level cap
,sigmareborn,2010-04-27T03:26Z,"i dont have fallout 3 for 360, but as request i shall try to find the files and put em into an easy to use pack :D"
,sigmareborn,2010-04-28T03:14Z,hey i have all the fallout 3 DLC but TPB wont let me upload because the captcha wont load
,missmiles,2010-04-30T23:27Z,can you get caugh on xbox live for using this dl
,sigmareborn,2010-05-02T00:33Z,"no, its unsigned. like the fallout 3 DLC and the ODST sgt johnson files its not console locked.

which means as long as you have the files you have the.. ahem rights to it.. Microsoft has no way of proving that your friend didnt buy the borderlands DLC disc and loaned it to you. 

plus the xbox is pretty locked tight down on what is and isnt allowed to work, microsoft isnt going to look into anything about a few people putting various files onto their xboxs they are more concerned about j-taggers and flashed drives"
,sigmareborn,2010-05-02T00:37Z,"Fallout 3 is uploaded

I clicked and copied in hard drive of xbox 360 and it shows but i dont know how to install this to play :(
Pls help ASAP."
,sigmareborn,2010-05-16T04:51Z,"im not sure i understand your problem, it shows up under games > borderlands on your xbox?"
,arulsayshi,2010-05-16T08:14Z,"sigmareborn atleast u replied :)

But when i click it shows copy,del,move.
Problem is that i am newbie and this is my first dlc so how to start the games which i copied to hdd.

Sorry for confusion and pls give your email id so that i can mail u regarding this."
,sigmareborn,2010-05-16T15:08Z,"thats it they are installed, congrats! now when you load up borderlands and go to the fast travel stations it will show the locations. 

when you copied them to the xbox it installed them for you (they make it very user friendly)"
,arulsayshi,2010-05-16T15:52Z,"There is a problem :(
When i go to fast travel i don't get any new locations in it, i checked several times.
Do we have to complete some secret quest or something to get to location??"
,sigmareborn,2010-05-17T06:00Z,"no, after you did the install it should have popped up and said hey you have xxxx installed. i dont remember what the travel locations are for the said spots"
,JTaGRRRR,2010-05-17T08:36Z,"@ arulsayshi

You need to add the TU (Title Update) to the Cache directory before it will show up in the fast travel network.  Hope this helps!!"
,arulsayshi,2010-05-18T14:04Z,"@ JTaGRRRR
Damm, it worked :)
Now i know that we have to add TU.
As soon as i added TU and placed in xbox 360 i got popup that zombie island is installed and same for mad moxxi.
Thanks a lot bro, really helped me.

@ sigmarborn
Thanks a lot for DLC as the size are small and works great, pls upload more DLC in future :)

Thanks a lot to both of you guys :)"
,sigmareborn,2010-05-18T15:00Z,"ah my apologies for not figuring it out, but i just assumed you were on xbox live (which would have downloaded the update for ya) thanks to JTaGRRRR for the tip

i can upload all sorts of DLC but the only ones that will be able to use it are people with j-tag'd xboxs.

if they throw it on a disc (like fallout 3 or borderlands i can rip the files and put em up for download then they will be unsigned"
,JTaGRRRR,2010-05-24T13:09Z,Cheers guys!

,sigmareborn,2010-06-05T14:46Z,"if it were on a disc then yes, but its not its a downloadable voucher"
,w4ffl3s,2010-06-08T23:20Z,i keep getting an error about being unable to read the disc for zombie island. moxxi worked fine though
,Matrix_Explosion,2010-06-27T04:05Z,"Alright, I'm pretty new when it comes to the 360 scene, so I was wondering if somebody could answer my question.

I've got the DLC's installed on my harddrive by using the new USB update, but exactly how do I install the title update?"
,Vohx,2010-07-03T01:31Z,"so im having some problems here... how exactly do i take the dlc from my pc and put it on the 360? like, i have the thumb drive formatted with the new update and all, but i cant access it once its on the thumb drive, or i can have it partitioned and still not have access... either way, its on the thumb drive and i cant see it on the 360."
,sigmareborn,2010-07-03T15:20Z,are you sure your checking that folder placement is correct?
,Uber95,2010-07-19T02:41Z,Question. It shows that i have the DLCs on the USB but when i plug it into my xbox it says it is a corrupted file. 
,simonxu,2010-07-19T10:03Z,"hi, i install the dlc but when i lauch it it give me the error corrupt files, please help"
,sigmareborn,2010-07-20T01:57Z,"ok well just because it says its on the usb while its on the computer doesnt mean its in the right spot, if it shows up as corrupted on xbox then its not in there right"
,picolo83,2010-07-20T02:24Z,"Hi, Thanks for the upload.
I'm french and my english is very bad but i want to know.

Thanks you in advance.
Bye."
,sigmareborn,2010-07-20T16:55Z,this contains teh underdome and mad moxxi's
,picolo83,2010-07-24T11:30Z,"Thanks , it works!
Are you others dlc?"
,sigmareborn,2010-07-25T16:29Z,i have fallout 3's dlc
,Sacik,2010-08-08T15:25Z,I put this on my Xbox HDD via USB and Xtaf.  It's loaded and I can see the new places in the fast travel network.  However when I go to the new places a little video starts to play and about 3 seconds into either of them I get an error message from the Xbox saying that I need to clean my Disc.  My Borderlands disc is a brand new burned backup.  I'm currently redownloading both BL and the DLC.  Any one know what I should try next?  Thanks for any help!
,sigmareborn,2010-08-18T05:17Z,"i played this with a rental from gamefly (retail copy) and i didnt receive this message, not sure if there is any protection in the TU for borderlands to perhaps ""slow"" piracy?"
,DthKnght2546,2010-09-26T06:53Z,"Ok, I dled the content transfered them to the proper folder on my hard drive.  I dled the TU's and placed them in my Cache folder.  I load borderlands and I get the ever so lovable error message ""Some of your DLC is corrupt and can not be loaded.""  I ignore it and go use a fast travel to go to Jakobs Cove but its not on the list.  What the f**k am i doing wrong?"
,franki14,2010-09-29T05:05Z,come on dudes PLZZZZ SEEEEED :)
,MasBass,2010-11-10T12:06Z,"Those who have the GOTY edition ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5904433/%28Xbox360%29BORDERLANDS_GOTY_EDiTiON%28PAL%29%28MULTI5%29%28www.DAMEXBOX360.c ) be aware that this addon pack will NOT work with that version of Borderlands. You need to find any older version of Borderlands that is compatible with this addon pack, GOTY version just doesn't work with this. "
,Espionage724,2010-11-23T11:30Z,Imma give this a try :D
,popober,2010-12-12T06:22Z,"Okkay, I need some help. I tried injecting the files with USB Xtaf Explorer, I followed the instructions there. But I don't think it's successful, it doesn't show up on my unit when I plug the usb in. I don't know what's wrong. Please help..."
,coinsaregood,2011-01-01T22:59Z,the underdome gives unreadable disc
,asuky,2011-04-02T14:09Z,"Torrent works great. A+

Simple move the files over using XeXMenu or equivalent, putting them in the Content/0000000000000000 Borderlands folder.

Secondly, download the Title Updates and put em in the Cache folder for your XBOX360. You can also update via LIVE to get past this step if you got LIVE connectivity.

Works like a dream, both Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and Moxxi's Underdome loads without a hitch."
,J-san,2011-04-25T23:07Z,With title update - works perfect (12625). (Some text in subtitles for the opening videos is missing thou)
,camandert,2011-08-15T00:30Z,"hey thank you for the dlc i got it downloaded and on the 360, my only problem is that when i load my game it didnt tell me that i got new content installed and when i look at the fast travel there isnt any new spots! is this normal or do i need to do something?"
