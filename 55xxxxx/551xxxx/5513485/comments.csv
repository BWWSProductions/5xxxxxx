P.S. I used the activate by phone feature which I would recommend over cracking it. "

http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/18746-Office-2010-Toolkit-A-little-Tool-I-m-working-on.

Not mine, credit goes to the OP here.

How to use:
download this torrent, install (use the serial above)
go to the link mentioned, download
open, choose option 12 --> 10.
close, then open again, option 2
(optional) close, then open again, option 5, remove your old serial
done! you just need to run the activation every 6 months."
