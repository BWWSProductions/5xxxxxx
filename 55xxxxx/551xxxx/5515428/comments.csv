,Pizzathomas,2011-10-06T12:32Z,the controls sometimes freeze for me
,thebarca,2011-10-29T14:48Z,Nice torrent. I finished downloading in 19 minute 49 second. Worked very fast at the speed of 1.8 mb/s. 
,thebarca,2011-10-29T16:18Z,"I can confirm that It works!!! 
Just burn vice city iso or extract it with winrar, in either way you've to run setup.exe. 
Install the game copy over crack. 
Then you need daemon tools lite. Just mount vice city play and enjoy the game"

,gamermaster,2012-06-16T13:55Z,does this work with 64 bit
,carstorm,2012-06-23T04:54Z,Sweet works fine on Windows 8 x64. That means it would work on Windows 7 and PROBABLY Vista.
,carstorm,2012-06-23T04:56Z,Also forgot to mention Windows 8 had a built in iso reader included :) another reason to upgrade.
