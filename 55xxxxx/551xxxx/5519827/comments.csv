,Mathlol,2010-09-29T20:05Z,"Thanks for the upload.  
Decent quality but much room for improvement.  The source/editing is not so good.  It's over cropped and possibly lower quality than a dvd i saw not long ago."

fr those who are havin trouble with ""When Nature Calls"" :

1. After the download is finished exit your bit torrent client software

2. Copy the downloaded files to another folder

3. Play the files from the new folder (from their new location)

4. Say thanx to the uploader & seed! 

(:D)"

,Stig_gitS,2011-03-31T13:44Z,"Very Strange, I,ve downloaded almost 400 torrent movies yet with these two I can't play (using VLC) or rename or delete. Even tried to copy to a new location but was denied. Renamed folder and tried the afore-mentioned tasks again but no go. Very strange indeed. 

Oh well good luck to ya for those who got these working, I've started downloading other copies."
,bragazar1710,2011-07-17T00:59Z,thanks.
,kingjoser,2012-05-31T07:40Z,"Files wont play unless you rename the folder and the video file itself. You cant rename the file unless you rename the folder. Rename the folder first, then go to the video file and just add a period ""."" and ""avi"" after it. For some reason video players cant play it if the file doesn't end in avi, mkv, mp4, etc etc. After you rename the file, the video plays. Its also good quality"
