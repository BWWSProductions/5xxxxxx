,cranknozzle,2011-07-26T16:20Z,"Thx very much! I bought my copy online by digital download and somehow managed to delete it while cleaning up all my internal and external HDs. B I G Coheed fan, as we all are. 

My most amazing story about Coheed & Cambria was from when I was 20 years old. The 'No World for Tomorrow"" album literally came out the day of the night I was leaving for a soul-seeking/adventure of sorts all across eastern Europe. I was in places like Ukraine, Romania, Austria, and even some Russian cities, traveling alone at 20 years old. My first experience abroad. This album literally changed my life, as did that trip. What an amazing experience seeing how so many people and cultures live and breathe and get by without so many of the things we think are 'required' back home in our own little corner of the world... Just breathtaking, mind-blowing; simply amazing... If anyone ever has the chance to travel, especially alone, so places off the beaten path, without guides and fancy hotels, you don't even have to know the language. Just pickup a bag and a pocket size book of some basic communications in your target location languages, and GO! Your life will be forever changed, and I hope for the better!

My best to ALL Coheed fans out there! Take care of yourself, all!!"
