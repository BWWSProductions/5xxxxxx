,zophras,2010-04-24T00:59Z,"Just out of interest: why has it taken so long for a Blu-ray rip to become available? It would seem to me that usually Blu-ray rips are available at least a week before the official in-store release of a movie, and you'd think that with Avatar being such a hotly anticipated Blu-ray release it would have been leaked to BitTorrent sites sooner."
