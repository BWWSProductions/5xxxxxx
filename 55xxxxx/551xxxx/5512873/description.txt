Lane Daniels (Hilary Duff) is a fashion journalist whose career and love life come together in a smashing way when she pitches the article â€œswitching careers to find loveâ€ to Cosmo magazine. Cosmo editor Kate (Jaime Pressly) loves the idea and gives Lane a chance to write the featured cover story! She wants Lane to get a job in a traditional business world, and then meet and date as many men as she can. While undercover in her new â€œjobâ€, Lane meets Liam, Seth, Tom and John. In the end, Lane has much more to write about than she ever expected â€“ including a surprise discovery of love. Can a woman find true love, career fulfillment and a perfect pair of shoes while staying beautiful inside and out?
