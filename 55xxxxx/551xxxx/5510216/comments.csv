I didn't know how you would take my Caesar monolougue. I have read some of your commetns while writing this and I an I don't BELIVE that I have pissed you off. However, please tell me to get get back in my box if you wish as I know you can fight your own battles.


Sorry, Steve, if I went off on you a bit there it was NOT a direct attack on you but rahter me just getting sick to detah of whatching all the shows that 20-40 puts out disappear beacuse of leeches & H&R scum.

Thank you ALL for your time.

http://codebox.org.uk/pages/bitmeter2 or Bitmeter 2 (search on Google) if the link doesn't work.
Bit of set up invlved and not fo the novice (but can learned be qucikly) but you'll never worry about going over your up/down/combined allowance (it does them all) again).

SEED what you can can, please, I can ask no more.

I didn't see it as an attack, i saw it as a man speaking the truth on how he feels. I value your honesty and i understand the reasoning behind it, still it is fact that every bit helps as long as you give back what to take i feel it is fair some of us have limited bw and we try our best to seed all we can, i have worked out that i can download every episode (the ones i watch) 20-40 uploads and seed back +-2:1 on each of my episodes and download a movie in between until i reach my bw limit.

,jon4fun,2010-04-24T07:29Z,"Hi Stev,
Sorry it had taken so long t get back to you but had to sleep.

I agree with you, we give what we take and as much more as we can and then we all win!

Stev, I do not know where you're from, i.e. wat country. This is an important issue in this whole string of messages.
There has been a vcertain country and 99.9% of the population of that country who are reponsible for the H&R incidents.

I'm not going to say where it is or who they are as don;t want to be banned by the country which TPB IS constituted in!

I appreaciate the fact that you are on a fixed u/down allowance (fron the sound of it) and know exactly how much t give before you get charged.

This e-mail string is NOT aimed at people like you. You (& I) are in the minority.
It is people with very fast speeds from certain countries with high allowances that are the culprits.

Let me put it this way & I apologise but I still have to speak 'around' this matter rather than head-on.
Did you notice anyone from certain cold northern countries jumping up and down saying that isn't true?
the simple fact of the matter is that 'THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE!' & they believe the unwritten rules of sharing/seeding do NOT apply to them because their country happens to host one of (if not the) largest P2P site in the world.

I set my ratios at 7:1 for quarks on Talk Shows and some of them still haven't been fully hit.
for norma TV shows I set it at 3:1 unless I see a high demand and then increase to 4/5:1. It is just what I can do as I have the allowance to enable me to do so.
You don't and NO-ONE is holding thst against you.
You see it as a matter of 'fairness' while most of the scum of a certain country do not see 'fairness' as an issue at all. In fact most of them only seed for as log as it takes them to DL the paticular show, e.g .25:1 ratio.

I hope you get where I'm coming from.

Stay shiny and I I hope you continue to seed as much as you can.

Cheers
Jon"
