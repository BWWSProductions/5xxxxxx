,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-24T18:02Z,"Nice, quality looks amazing, but i'm guessing the portugese subtitles are embedded in the file? Too bad, or i woulda d/l'd this one for sure."
,CorE FreaK,2010-04-24T22:59Z,"Amazing? Wow, you really haven't seen good quality then. I'd say the quality is too poor on this to watch this kind of movie."
,guindart,2010-04-24T23:10Z,"Subtitle no forced in movie

Selectable in the player"
,default_user64,2010-04-25T05:24Z,Anyone find a 1080p torrent in the 20-25GB range? 11BG seems kinda small for such a long movie but 38 is kind of overkill...
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-04-25T07:47Z,its not a 3d version so no worth downloading  and no multi audio and subs.
,john5246,2010-04-25T16:50Z,I agree this movie should be well over 20GB considering how long it is.

For a file only 11gb big, yes, those screen samples are amazing. If you don't think so then you're just a fucking tool. Obviously at 11gb it's not going to be blu-ray quality, dip shit. Try using your head for a change and think things through."
