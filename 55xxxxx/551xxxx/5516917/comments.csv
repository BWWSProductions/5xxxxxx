,haimrev,2011-11-21T11:03Z,"I downloaded this part just to see how good this program was. I have been tutoring mathematics for 10 years and all my students usually improve around 20% within three or so months. This episode of the brainetics series is pointless. It contains magic square formation (interesting yes but useless), finding a day for any date from 1900 to 2100 and a card trick. The magic square one was interesting but useless, the date one I did about 1 minute quicker than him by looking up a calendar via a date I input and the 3rd card trick well that was pointless to taught me nothing. Don't dismiss the series because of this video though the rest may be good thats why i'm giving them a go"
