,D0gmeat,2010-04-27T13:00Z,Is this 1.46 a beta or a typo? Malwarebyte's site still only lists 1.45?

,newgeblek,2010-05-20T18:45Z,why i can not register with all serial no?
,BLACKPHOENIXRIZIN,2010-07-04T05:33Z,"MURLOK

I tried all of the ID keys & serials & none worked 4 me. Now I would never say that things turning out the way that they did was not the result of me doing some thing wrong. Due 2 the fact that I didn't see any info text doc I figured that all was needed was 2 download & install the program & use the accompaning serials & register the copy. So if I missed something or did something wrong plz let me know. Also I couldn't figure out that ""msinfo"" doc & wut is suppose 2 be done with & also how 2 open it. So if u could get back & with a little feedback I would be most appriciative. Thanx much murlok peace."
,lerner2go,2010-08-19T12:02Z,"thanks again murlok, i did not try it yet, i will comment again letter."
,lerner2go,2010-08-19T14:56Z,"Murloc ,thanks again and well i try all the serials you provided but i might be wrong since i am new to this thing :) but i could not get the serials to work for me,  so please i need an explanation on""how to"", i know i sound a dump but no experience on those things hope to get your help or others who are willing.. i think my PC is eaten out by malwares so helppppppp olsase :)"
,SupDotCom,2010-09-24T10:41Z,can i not update this? cause when I try it invalidates the license
,CarvingBlade,2010-11-06T21:10Z,Serial numbers are not valid!
,dmx89,2010-11-12T19:58Z,"Can't update it turns it into the free version!! :(

i've tried alot of serials after i updated but none have worked.
all versions of malwarebytes has worked fine to update for a long time but now suddenly it doesn't work anymore, at least not for me. 

maybe if someone could make a crack or a patch it will start working again?"
,mrdreamers4u,2011-07-28T22:00Z,when you install don't update it uncheck update when your installing it ;)
,crimson85067,2011-10-01T22:17Z,"Yes, uncheck the ""update malewarebytes"" when you are installing it, then put in serial, woork great, should have been in the instructions though.

If you didnt, then uninstall it with iobit uninstaller and do a power scan after uninstalling it and then reinstall "
