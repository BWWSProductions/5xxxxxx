,napoleonguerra,2010-04-25T15:35Z,"The keys are supplied, but in what order does one enter them? There are four keys supplied in the ""Serials.txt"" (user / pc / comp / admin), but just two (2) fields in the registration window.
Sorry for being a noob.

In the meanwhile I tried the keys for an older version (4.4) and it works. Bingo!

Here they are:

PowerISO 4.4 + Serials
**********************

Instal using the following user name and a serial.

Goldfish_92

H4NSP-IBBSF-I24WN-D5KZL-2CN6T
EEZX9-ZWIFF-YECDF-YU7VZ-PBHB4
4H6T6-AP8EF-2RZI4-UWYRQ-6TWEA
V9GHB-8P956-PHIFK-UYTA9-T4ZNI
77WV9-P44K5-UB847-E82QM-3D1UV



If you already had PowerISO installed and registered just instal 4.4 over the top and it will
remain activated...


Seed, enjoy :)"
[V],thethingy,2010-04-25T15:47Z,"napoleonguerra, whats the purpose of that crap, dont post serial on my torrents. You clearly know how to use it as you already have you little troll, why would anyone want there registered user name to be Goldfish_92 ??"

,WolfmanJoe,2010-06-16T12:03Z,"Downloaded this, no problem.

I'm fairly new to all this so forgive my ignorance...

When inputting the registration details I cannot get any of the serial numbers to work.

1) Do I need to input a specific user name (or one in a specific format?

2) Which of the keys should I put into the Registration Code box? There are four keys (user, PC, comp, admin) but only space for one.

Any help would be appreciated. Cheers!"

,rockrob,2010-07-17T11:01Z,"For some weird reason, it asks to enter key every time it starts. I didn\'t disconnect internet before installing. That may be the reason. I\'m stuck with that shitty DAEMON. Fuck me :("

,Zucrham,2010-09-18T09:03Z,"So I downloaded the program and installed it. But when I was going to register, it asked for a username, but I didn't gen any username in the ""Keys"" folder....? WHere did I go wrong?

Use thethingy's he knows what he's doing. thanks thethingy. and for you guys that still cant figure it out, your user name is one of the 4 either user,pc,comp or admin put one of those words in the user name space and put the serial that's to the right of that word where the serial # goes. that's it your done, no more registration box. and then pound your head against the wall for being so stupid.

Another note is that the user name is case sensitive, so enter it exactly as shown it TXT doc"

When you are prompted to register the product type into the ""User name"" field one of the usernames: user, pc, comp, admin. All letters should be in lowercase. Use the corresponding code provided in the ""SERIALS.txt"". This worked for me when I registered as ""admin"". Hope it helps."
