I have a message for "velvetfog". 
Don't know if you watch my torrents (I hope you do) or not, but I got to leave you this message somehow. I got to talk to you about something very important. Please e-mail me (cirip2006@gmail.com) and tell me how to contact you. Don't know why, but I can't post comments on torrents (this is why I wrote the message on the description of my torrent), otherwise I would had wrote it on your last torrent.

P.S. Guys, please give me a hand, try to contact somehow "velvetfog" and tell to him about this torrent and the message for him (if he doesn't respond). His torrents are here 
http://thepiratebay.org/user/velvetfog/

and his last uploaded torrent is here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5488772/CBC_-_Global_Warming_Doomsday_Called_Off_-_velvetfog

You can leave a comment to him for me with the link for this torrent, in the way that he can come and see. Thank You guys.
I hope there are still a lot of good guys out there, who can help me...
