[V],BOZX,2010-04-24T10:15Z,"no diff....
diff people get diff speed in diff torrents.
People should have the right to choose the best suitable torrent.
If not downloading "" DONT COMPLAIN"" pls"
,Harutik_11,2010-04-24T10:18Z,"I aint complaining, but now I see what the difference is.
I was getting 40 kb/s max on the other one, and Im currently get 750 kb/s on this :)
Thx."
,quatro84,2010-04-24T10:19Z,Any come out in 3D? i have 3D IMAX glasses.
,Harutik_11,2010-04-24T10:59Z,"3D?
lol"
,w000ter,2010-04-24T11:07Z,"""Any come out in 3D? i have 3D IMAX glasses. ""
if you can afford the 3d imax projector, you can afford the bluray.
get real, unless you had a 3d hdtv costing thousands 3d bluray is useless to you. never mind the shutter glasses.  imax 3d glasses have nothing to do with home 3d."
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-04-24T11:29Z,"its not a 3d ,and also i prefer audio english and russian and greek subs"

,quatro84,2010-04-24T18:23Z,? really? haha ok. but it worked very well with Coraline in 3D http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327597/
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-24T18:52Z,"Almost 400 fags leeching and only 3 are bothering to seed at all. How lovely.

,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-04-25T07:48Z,"no multi audio no multi subs not a 3d  so not worth downloading,i will wait for the 3d ."
,index-thepiratebay,2010-04-25T07:56Z,@LAMBORGHINI38: 3d release is on November of this year. I've heard that they're not even yet sure if they're going to release a full 3d copy of the movie.
,moegocanes,2010-04-25T10:07Z,thank you BOZX
,Werttit,2010-04-25T13:26Z,"Seed, please :)"
,w3s_26,2010-04-25T18:45Z,Will there be a 1080p release that is in the 4-7gb range?
,pain_here2007,2010-04-25T19:05Z,"@Quatro

Dont believe on these lamers.

Bro buy Nvidia gpu and you can watch anything in 3d running on your pc with their glasses.

All you need is just buy a nvidia gpu which supports nvidia physx technology.

,Perspolice,2010-04-26T01:53Z,"is my pc video player and graphic card, well enough for playing this?

""graphic: GeForce 9500 GT
player: KMPlayer""

I'll be grateful if u confirm this...

and please gimme a suggestion to how i my suppose to burn this on a no bluray disk?
if u got any cool mkv cutter plz let me know about it,
Thanx ;]"
,index-thepiratebay,2010-04-26T02:38Z,"@pain_here2007: aside from the card, you need a 3d ready screen. and there is a specific type of glasses, included when you buy the card."
,ahmed919,2010-04-26T13:24Z,can someOne please tell me how do i make mkv2vob use only the navi subtitles when converting?  both the subtitle files are for english and in mkv2vob you can choose your preffered subtitle language but it doesnt let you choose which subtitle you want from within the mkv... anyOne know how to do this?
,djjohnnyg,2010-04-27T01:53Z,"@ahmed919,

,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-04-28T10:04Z,its not a 3d version(
,MakMan06,2010-04-28T12:34Z,"@w3s_26

Not unless you want epic PIXELS! Download one of the 720p torrents at 4GB, the bitrate is much higher, and although not native res for your screen, will look infinitely better than a low bitrate 1080p! Besides, your PC/console/Media Player uses hardware upscaling so it won't look too shabby"
,MitsEvX,2010-04-30T19:27Z,"This movie looks great in 1080p! :D

Thanks uploader!"
,nevember,2010-05-03T07:37Z,"Great copy. Thanks BOZX!
A: 10
V: 10 

I think this is a good bitrate for this film. Different movies can use different settings depending on their content. I have a hard time downloading and seeding anything more than 10 GB. Just my opinion. This is significantly better than some of the 4,6,7 GB 1080p Avatars out there."
,schmitty84,2010-05-04T14:38Z,"Not to take sides, but my samsung 50"" plasma supports 3d. I got it on sale for about $1000. So I guess the douche's ""thousands"" of dollars is a bid upscaled. That or he went to school in Kentucky."
,TolyanNYC,2010-05-05T00:56Z,not sure if this was asked before but when I?m trying to watch this torrent i get either voice delay (with KMP player) or picture just stops periodically (with VLC player) can anyone explain why? thanks. 
,geis16,2010-05-12T19:05Z,thnx
,ipadicted,2010-05-13T20:36Z,I encoded this video using Handbrake and selected 'Force only' for the subtitles. No subtitles showing up..what am i doing wro ng?
,zappacrew,2010-05-16T05:05Z,11 gigs....heck I just bought the blu-ray/DVD combo for $25.   Can't imagine having any less resolution than that.
,nkumar,2010-06-20T15:15Z,"Hai TolyanNYC,try mediaplayer classic homecinema with coreavc codec.It's working very nicely without any audiosync problem."
