The S2E15 notation is not official, this was from the Music Jump-Off show which aired 2 weeks after the season finale.  I've been recording every Chappelle Show on FIOS for 6 months now and the music jumpoff episode has not been replayed, I don't think it's going to be replayed so I downloaded a torrent of season 2 that included the music jumpoff episode and ripped the tracks from that.
