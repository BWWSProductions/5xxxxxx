"The Squirt and The Whale"

The Simpsons decide to embrace a cheaper, alternate 
source of energy by erecting a wind turbine in 
their backyard. But when Homer realizes some of the 
power is being directed to the local electric 
company, he decides to remove his home from the 
grid and becomes completely dependent upon an 
unreliable source of power. Meanwhile, a storm 
erupts, trapping a magnificent 150-foot-long blue 
whale ashore, and Lisa and Homer attempt to help 
the poor creature.

Enjoy :)
