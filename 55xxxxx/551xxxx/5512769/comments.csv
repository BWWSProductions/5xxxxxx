,sinshixxi,2010-04-27T06:53Z,"they nuked the previous release by Firefox simply because of ""from p2p - someone else's link""? wtf is this? how about this release by Marvel, is it stealth patched?"
,sinshixxi,2010-04-29T05:38Z,"ok i downloaded this iso. Used ABGX and it said that the iso stealth passed. There's a database matched to this Marvel's iso, whereas Firefox's release doesn't have database in ABGX and said uncertain stealth."
