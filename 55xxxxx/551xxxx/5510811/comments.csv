,tristene,2010-08-24T15:52Z,"Don't bother with this torrent - it's as slow as all buggary.

Try this one instead, it seems to be quicker. And by quicker I mean less than a day as opposed to 22 weeks and 2 motherfucking days (to me it smells like some cockmunch is really dicking with it).

So go here instead me hearties:

Um, what else do pirates say, er, ""Arrrr"" and ""Aye"" and ""Fuck the USA"" and all that.

Oh wait this is a french film? Pfft, whatever.

VIVE LA PIRATEBAY! (chomps on an onion)"
