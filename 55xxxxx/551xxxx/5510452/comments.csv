BBC.Top.100.eBooks\TheLastOfTheMohicans.pdf
- what a pitty - would be a nice collection!
:-)"
,1950sigma,2010-04-27T20:09Z,"These are all pdf's and my Malwarebytes, McAfee or Avast do NOT find any viruses/malware/trojans in any of these books."
,ImSoJaded,2010-04-28T08:30Z,"I would not trust Avira, it found malware on an original Macmillan dictionary CD (yup, a boxed legal copy)."
,trojan3000,2010-05-02T13:20Z,there's no viruses or malwares or trojans in this collexion .. Absoluletly clean ..Guaranteed 100%
,cur1y_q,2010-05-03T04:06Z,so i compared this to the BBC website and its not correct. most of if is right but i noticed that a few are missing and a few are added. i think the torrent it worth it download but its not 100% accurate

,armusen,2010-08-27T10:20Z,If the uploader is called trojan3000 it makes you think a bit
,Timmmm,2010-08-28T01:22Z,These are all PDFs. Not good for ereaders. :-/
,gwapsako,2010-09-06T16:28Z,@Timmmm: use a converter to convert to epub format
,drbuster,2010-09-13T18:58Z,thanks to the uploader
,omgrobotz,2010-09-28T02:56Z,"There are no viruses in this torrent. 

Thank you uploader! Great list of books."
,doctor3nz,2010-10-04T12:39Z,"I trust Avira much more than I will ever trust McAfee (it's practically useless!), but it does however give more false positives sometimes. The safest is usually to scan files at www.virustotal.com since they use many different virus scan engines simultaneously and you get a good idea of how many have detected ""malware"" in a file.

ImSoJaded: You should contact the Avira guys and let them know that it reported your Macmillan dictionary as being infected, so they can fix that.

But please guys, I work with this sort of stuff a lot and have learned the hard way not to trust McAfee or AVG as they miss way too many viruses!

Enough talk about viruses, etc (except to mention that I just noticed this torrent was provided by ""trojan3000"" LOL).. thanks a lot for the post!"
,shaan117,2010-10-17T19:36Z,brilliant thanks.  My only criticism is that some of the pdf's have spelling mistakes in them.
,Mattyo9,2010-10-21T03:57Z,Virus; don't download.
,whatsdstory,2010-11-03T13:20Z,"Thank you, thank you!!! The virus talk is not true for me as I'm sure it's not true for the 218 and counting seeders. Thanks again trojan3000! :)"
,amil88,2010-11-03T17:56Z,great! thanks =)
,jonesyboiii,2010-11-06T00:57Z,"excellent torrent, quality books all in epub"
,Ahamandyne,2010-11-11T13:21Z,"@goya1975 Haha agree with you ! 

Txs for uploading this :) It's going pretty fast for me ! Do you think I can read this on an Ipad or an Archos ? "
,shaan117,2010-11-13T17:40Z,Just finished 'Kane & Abel' It had tonnes of spelling mistakes in but it was still brilliant.
,abscorp,2011-02-08T22:19Z,thanks :)
,imsharing,2011-05-29T10:30Z,"on the other hand, trojan man helps protect from viruses lol"
