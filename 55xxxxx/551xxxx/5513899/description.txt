Victoria Celestine (Nicole Leigh Verdin) braves a transatlantic journey from
1860's Holland to Civil War American to search for her missing husband in the 
Old West. With her younger brother Abraham in tow, Victoria discovers the lost
town Shroud, where she unravels a dark conspiracy involving a misplaced mayor
(G. Russell Reynolds), his tortured wife (Morgana Shaw), a renegade marchal
(Jodie Moore) and his posse of cruel Confederate defectors that guard them.

With history wrapped in superstition, and murders masked by myth, Lady Celestine
reveals the grisly secret of a dead Spanish Conquistador, a heretic hanged, and
the 300-year old Apache legend of an abomination the feeds on innocence.

This low budget film shot in Texas is destined to be a full, western cult classic.
