,scottielass,2010-05-02T16:45Z,Terrific copy -- perfect! Thank you very much.
,KwyjiboLinguist,2010-05-03T21:50Z,"If you can hear the music but aren't hearing any voice over or dialogue it's because this download doesn't play correctly in some players. For example, it doesn't play correctly in VLC Media Player for some reason.

Download Final Media Player (google it) for free and it will play perfectly."
,KwyjiboLinguist,2010-05-03T21:51Z,"This doesn't require English subtitles because the movie is in English.

If you can hear the music but aren't hearing any voice over or dialogue it's because this download doesn't play correctly in some players. For example, it doesn't play correctly in VLC Media Player for some reason.

,scottielass,2010-05-04T15:28Z,The comment about this not playing in VLC media player is utter rubbish. I watched the movie using this player and it was perfect.
