Blackest Night is a comic book limited series that formed the basis of a crossover event between several DC Comics publications. 

Blackest Night involves a personified force of death resurrecting deceased superheroes and seeking to eliminate all life and emotion from the universe.  The crossover was published for eight months via a limited series, as well as in both the current Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps titles. Various other limited series and tie-ins were published.

The storyline was first mentioned at the conclusion of the "Sinestro Corps War" in Green Lantern v4 #25. As the war between the Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps reaches its climax, the Green Lanterns of Earth are told by the Guardians Ganthet and Sayd of the "Blackest Night" prophecy.  According to the prophecy, the two existing Corps would be joined by five new ones, each driven by a specific emotion and empowered by a specific color of the emotional spectrum, leading to a "War of Light" that would subsequently destroy the universe. 

The main series is written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Ivan Reis.


I have started this story-arc from Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns and Green Lantern v4 #36 as this introduces the various corps that are integral to the Blackest Night storyline.

I have organized the cross-over in specific story-arcs as this is how I like to read them, I don't like chopping and changing and coming back to a previous character or situation.  If you prefer reading your crossover events in the more traditional way I have included an alternative reading order.
