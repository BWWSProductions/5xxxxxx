,JackaMacka,2010-04-27T16:06Z,"Finally someone has uploaded the mastered release!! Thanks so much. The quality is as good as it gets.

Good album overall but nothing Bullet creates will ever beat The Poison.

Thanks again, 320hunter."
,JackaMacka,2010-04-28T10:54Z,"The quality isn't as good as I originally thought, I don't think this is the mastered version. When I first listened to it it sounded great because some songs are better quality than others, but overall it is pretty ordinary quality. 

Sorry for the mistake"
