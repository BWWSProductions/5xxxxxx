,bychance,2010-04-25T05:02Z,"DVDguy, weather you like the movie or not doesn't matter. just comment on the quality
of the upload. thats what the comment facility is here for."
,DVDguy,2010-04-25T05:05Z,"bychance  : thanks for the note.  Trust me, saving even a single person wasting their d/l time and bandwith on this crap is worth it.  The film is shite... "
,DVDguy,2010-04-25T05:20Z,"Forgot to mention... ""weather""  Really? Come on...."
,Bombardem,2010-04-25T08:57Z,"I agree w dvdguy, if a film is some piece of shit B movie no one has ever heard of I love an opinion post, especially if its a dvdrip brrip etc where quality is obviously good. You only need to comment on non dvd rips like TS's for v/a quality."
,dlarrym,2010-07-04T05:58Z,"Are you saying someone (in other words) some newb, even if they bought the BLU-RAY disc set, that it can't be converted right... THINK AGAIN. Just because the original disc was a HD or BLURAY, if someone that hasn't converted movies from a DVD authoring to putting it in an AVI package as a XviD or an MKV package, if they are not skilled, some really screwed up shit has been uploaded here. I prefer that all aspects are commented on. Besides no one single opinion of what ""THEY"" feel the comment box is made for doesn't mean that it is made for that. It s for what ever one wants to put ou there. HOPEFULLY it won't be a bunch of retarded crap. Will comment after downl load. THANKS!"
