Thank you."

It's called GOOGLE motherfucker, LEARN TO USE IT.    Bone is nice enough to upload this show for your lazy ass, and you expect him to tutor you in some shit that you can literally look up for yourself in a matter of seconds?   You sir, are a scoundrel idiot of the first order, and I hope large dogs take craps in your driveway. "

,setotitan,2011-10-11T20:13Z,"While ""slats649"" probably should have checked Google for his question, and I do appreciate the upload, I have to say.. the multi stack Russian dolls RAR means of archiving these files is not only antiquated but unnecessary as well. In the future if you could just compress the originals into one file it would be most appreciated. Again many thanks for the upload!"
,Andan78,2012-06-17T14:56Z,this rar is bigger than original video...
