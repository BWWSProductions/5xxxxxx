In 1967, a giant winged monster reportedly terrorized the skies over a small town in West Virginia, ending in a tragic bridge collapse that claimed forty-six lives. Since then the Mothman, as the beast was known, has become an omen of doom and death. With new sightings across America today, this creature may be returning. In a search for answers, MonsterQuest will use night time surveillance, perception tests and forensic sketching to determine if the beast is myth or frightening reality.
