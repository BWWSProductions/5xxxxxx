,zzerop,2010-04-25T09:12Z,"another one of those so-called ""activator"" that only ""activates"" office 2010 for the period of 180 days.  it ain't no permanent activation."
,maxlunar,2010-04-25T10:09Z,"OK, I installed this activator with 5 Days left for activation.  It now shows that I have 180 Days left.

So, in my book it is a working activator, Not permanent, but still working..  Thanks for the upload Kentucky..

,crapthecrocodile,2010-04-25T10:30Z,"@zzerop,

So what if it only activates for 180 days, it is still an activator, no? Activation is activation, whether it works for a year or a day. The only thing permanent is your lack of brain cells."
,miroalex,2010-04-25T14:01Z,i can't activate my copy of office it is rtm and i use newer version of activator version 1.1 but again my product activation says that i have only 29 days... what should i do?
,Artemesia,2010-04-26T18:00Z,Has reached the maximum number of allowed activations for this corporate version.
,carambolapreta,2010-05-07T17:05Z,"It worked fine for me. I run the activator few weeks ago and the office 2010 says itÂ´s activated. ItÂ´s not showing up anything about 180 days left, actually I never saw this in the off2010 I got ""here from pirate bay, of course"""
,Superman169,2010-05-10T08:30Z,"Thank you very much i have tried installing like 5 different versions of this with no success for activating my 2010 version and this fixed it in a minute, not quite sure what to do once i opened it but got it to work sooo thank you ur the pimp shit"
,SoulSearching,2010-05-22T14:51Z,"Hey KK I just wanted to thank you. I think I downloaded your mondo version a few weeks ago and it ran out so I downloaded this and it worked. I clicked the rearm office 2010 button for those wondering which one to click. Thanks again, you ROCK!"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-05-23T13:20Z,"Is this makes he Office genuine, ?"

,ddbn,2010-05-29T08:03Z,"Hey kkid

I had intalled the 'Mondo' Version (V. 14.0.4417.1000) over a month ago and even though it would still work, it was giving me the RED bar and all of those nagging ""Need to Activate"" messages.

The ""activation"" part of this Activator did not work to activate the Mondo version, but the ""REARM"" part of it sure did. I don't know how long it is rearmed for, but it's working fine right now.

If it works for 180 days and I then have to rearm it again, that's fine with me. It's fast, simple, and just much better than anything else out there that I've seen. 

Thanks a bunch for all your work.

,lozory,2010-06-02T07:04Z,"the activate seems to work sweet, so after 180 days can you runi t again & get another 180??"

,crytek.GT,2011-03-15T02:09Z,I have Office 2010 and before when I got my new pc it came with a Office 2010 trial version. At first it didn't say anything about activation but after a week or so it said it's not activated and I would need to activate it after a set number of days. Is it the same in this case or if it's activated that's it and I should not expect any problems? Nice activator by the way and I did click the rearm office button. Does that reset the timer or is it supposed to be a permanent activation?
,crytek.GT,2011-03-19T17:29Z,Can't anyone respond to my last post? Jeeez!!!
,Bay-User,2011-04-11T12:05Z,"don't mind but it contains virus  my quick heal antivirus pro 2011 virus database 11 april2011
