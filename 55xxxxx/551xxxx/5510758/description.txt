                                    ----------




The Cove is a 2009 American documentary film that describes the annual killing of dolphins  in a National Park at Taiji, Wakayama, in Japan from an antiâ€“dolphin-hunting campaigner's point of view. The film highlights that the number of dolphins killed in the Taiji dolphin hunting drive is several times greater than the number of whales killed in the Antarctic, and claims that 23,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in Japan every year in the country's whaling industry. The migrating dolphins are herded into a hidden cove where they are netted and killed by means of spears and knives over the side of small fishing boats.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan's most recent progress report 1,569 cetaceans in Taiji were killed during the 2007 season, including methods other than drive hunting. The Ministry claims that only 1,239 cetaceans were killed by drive hunting, and that a total of 13,080 cetaceans were killed throughout Japan in 2007.

The film was directed by former National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos,and portions were filmed secretly during 2007 using underwater microphones and high-definition cameras disguised as rocks.




The documentary won the U.S. Audience Award at the 25th annual Sundance Film Festival in January 2009. It was selected out of the 879 submissions in the category.
