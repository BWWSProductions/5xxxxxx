Please don't cut the video off during the end credits.  This show is all about MUSIC, and the musical selection during the end credits is very much a part of the show.  It's for hearing and feeling while digesting the content just-viewed.  It's an important part of the experience of the show and is worth the extra megabytes.
Thanks."
