F1 2001 shook the house with precision, speed, and insanely tight racing.
Not ones to pass up a good thing, EA does its capitalizing thing and
extends the franchise into 2002.

Muscle your way to the front and enjoy every heart-stopping moment as you
battle for every inch of track against the superstars of the sport. With
authentic driver controls, you experience life in the cockpit with the same
technological wizardry available to this seasonâ€™s Formula One racers, or
switch off the controls and rely on your raw driving skills. Take the
wheel in F1 2002 and take aim at the 2002 Formula One World Championship.

Real drivers, teams, cars, and tracks all taken straight from the actual
2002 racing season, will once again make appearances. Aside from this,
and all of the other options and nuances to make return appearances,
F1 2002 will also include:


* 2002 Season complete with new Toyota and Renault racing teams.

* Telemetry based optimization of vehicle setup, driving style,
  and performance.

* New graphics technology that incorporates multi-texturing, dynamic
  weather, real-world lighting, character and pit crew animations,
  and "6D physics" (now including engine and brake temperature modeling).

* Greater accessibility, automation, and controller compatibility.

* As with practically all of EA's marquee sports franchises, yearly
  iterations are but improvements upon the last efforts, and not
  necessarily radical alterations to or departures from proven formulas.
  And, as with practically all of EA's other marquee sports franchises,
  this is usually a damn good thing. F1 2001 was an exercise in immense
  satisfaction; I can only imagine 2002 will be the same, but better.
