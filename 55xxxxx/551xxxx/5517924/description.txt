Paul and Eddie, two co-stars in the musical "Adam and Steve Just the Way God Made 'Em," are each pondering major life decisions: Paul wants to give up ... dating and have no-strings sex; Eddie's considering coming out to his super-religious parents. While at first these changes bring major disasters (Eddie's parents panic at the news, Paul ruins a one-night stand), a great night of satire, costumes, singing, and dancing gives everyone the confidence to just be themselves.
