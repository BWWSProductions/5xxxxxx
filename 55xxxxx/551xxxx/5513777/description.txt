This is called (iPod) and not (PSP, iPod, Zune) because it doesn't have subs embedded into the video stream.  PSP and Zune users will not like it because you have no way to see the Na'vi words.  Only good for iPod, iPhone users and Apple TV users or pc user.  Make sure you enable subtitles on your iPod.  The Na'vi subs are soft subs and will play on all Apple products (other than the original iPod video 5th gen, it doesn't have subtitle support)
