,CArjon,2010-04-25T02:29Z,AVG says its a virus
,CArjon,2010-04-25T04:02Z,"nvm i got it to work but it says
Steam Client Unavailable
This game can only be played With the Steam Client  
Running"
,Vampire-wolf-ghost,2010-04-25T04:34Z,"CArjon, open it through program files. 
If your using vista, right click on the icon, open file folder and click the icon. This is how it works for me."
,esharoth,2010-04-25T10:23Z,"I included a VirusTotal report in the description: http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/e668e95034992842e3a91aaad2aa1e0198b6b5befbe71de9082236bfc704f3b9-1272151164.

Only AVG, Authentium, F-Prot and Sophos detected a trojan. Kaspersky, Nod32, McAfee, Comodo, Panda and many other didn't find anything. 

Stop using AVG and install a real antivirus."
,Mikeyrul3z,2010-04-25T12:53Z,"I tried this, but it doesn't work. when ever i replace the steam file it wont launch off steam and avg pops up every time saying its a virus, can you remaster this fix please. 

Would be very helpful.
"
,esharoth,2010-04-25T13:07Z,"Why don't you just cancel your ISP contract? Really, you're just wasting bandwidth."
,genodo,2010-05-01T06:16Z,"every time i run the fix, i keep getting ""ERROR: Can not delete output file C:\Program Files (x86)\Beat Hazard\steamclient.dll"" how do i fix this"
,Unit3727,2010-05-01T07:19Z,"Steamclient.dll is found as a virus. Obviously it isn't. Adding it to exceptions on AVG or whatever your AV is (mine is AVG) will allow you to run the game perfectly fine.

If you don't know how to add files to the exception list then you shouldn't be messing with torrents, let alone computers.

TL;DR Its not a virus, add it to exceptions"
,Unit3727,2010-05-01T07:19Z,Oh and thanks for the fix.
,esharoth,2010-05-01T18:23Z,genodo: try installing the fix from an administrator account.
,svrdskllz,2010-05-03T01:35Z,I get the same error as CArgon... Original crack worked fine. but after this fix it fucks up
,sherwelbuilding,2010-05-10T17:46Z,"NEVERMIND, MY CARD WORKS AGAIN! YES!"
,saturnine4,2010-05-28T05:22Z,"This fix fucking sucks. Before I could atleast play beat hazard. Now I can't even do this thanks to this bullshit ""fix"". Fucking test your shit before you upload it. "
,Austinmc,2010-06-12T19:58Z,"Esharoth, the game works great, but this fix is not working for me. I have the same error message as genodo. I am logged in as administrator and it still does not work.  I am on Vista 64 bit. "
,gebrial,2010-06-30T09:23Z,i am also have the same problem. windows 7 32 bit here. really pissing me off
,MonoDrall,2010-07-21T19:37Z,"To play this game without steam client, run the .exe from the folder and not the shortcut on the desktop.

Also this fix must be run as administrator in order to edit the steamblahblah.dll file."
,MonoDrall,2010-07-21T19:53Z,nvm something is wrong with that steam. dll file. Game runs as normal when you replace it to when this fix didnt touch it.
,Killazer,2010-07-28T21:01Z,"I did got it work somehow. I moved the steam_api.dll file and steamclient.dll files to desktop, tried to start the game few times and moved the files back, now it's working like a charm."
,110chi,2010-10-02T18:45Z,"thanks, but could we get the .m4a patch up? they charge a extra dollar for it on steam"
,MadGuns22,2010-12-01T08:59Z,"Apart from the few problems before with all the not able to run with the steam.dll and AVG freaking out stuff, the game works great so far! :3

Looks out of date compared to the version of the demo on steam i got, but still, great DL :3"
,hasonish,2010-12-06T07:36Z,"http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=09bcf0436b45e93269dca176a8493f61ae3ac479dbfb686fa7e33defae2af1d7-1291617298

Did another scan, and it seems that more AV's see something wrong with this thing."
,vElvestad,2011-01-04T12:33Z,"This DO work, and there's no virus. Just some AV that think this is a virus. 

And don't whine here about steam popping up every time you try to start this, just go to the Beat Hazard folder in the program file directory, and click on beathazard.exe instead... get a brain please :)"
,vElvestad,2011-01-04T12:34Z,And thank you esharoth!
,mevidek,2011-02-06T12:29Z,"esharoth: YOu know that AVG is the best antivirus software, used by 20mil people?

retard. Anyway, I'm gonna download this if my beat hazard wont play"
,mevidek,2011-02-06T12:36Z,"kk so I downloaded, but it says that steamclient.dll cannot be deleted (to be overwritten)

Anyone else got this? If so, how did you fix it?"
,stoney-nl,2011-05-19T12:44Z,u  need a version of beathazard to run this fix on!
,ShadowEO,2011-07-18T20:28Z,"@mevidek YOu know that ESET is the best AV right? AVG *WAS* the best AV. Now it's just second rate with a lot of false positives.

@esharoth Nice upload."
