Description: A fix for Beat Hazard that enables savegames. Stats and ranks are saved, all achievements are already unlocked. Unfortunately, you still can't change your in-game name.

Installation:
1) Install to your Beat Hazard folder, overwriting the older file;
2) Run the game as normal. 

Important!
On Windows XP, the savegame will be located in: "C:Documents and Settings[USER_ACCOUNT]Local SettingsApplication DataSKIDROWSAVES40930savegame4.sav", where [USER_ACCOUNT] is your Windows XP user account name. You'll have to enable the viewing of hidden files and folders to find it.
