,chaotickkk,2010-04-27T07:28Z,"FAKE AS GOD!!!!! WMV FILE THAT REQUIRES 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE TO RUN 637KB.....

PPL VOUCHING FOR THIS GARBAGE ARE OBVIOUSLY UPLOADER ALTS"
,Koude,2010-04-27T07:41Z,fake is fake
,robbo19,2010-04-27T08:24Z,An avi file cannot be tampered with to contain a virus.We are getting too many idiots on here screaming fake.I can fonfirm this is a good upload.Thanks.
,madrox1,2010-04-27T08:56Z,The magnet link leads to a fake .wmv file.
,sc97,2010-04-27T08:57Z,"I am completely unbiased over this, just a casual downloader, and this shit DOES NOT WORK. In VLC player, it's a 9 second clip of nothingness, in windows media player, it says you need some kind of special encoder.

The file is complete bullshit. Anyone saying otherwise is wrong."
,bob0range,2010-04-27T08:57Z,"@robbo19: ""An avi file cannot be tampered with to contain a virus.""

You are really stupid if you believe this is true, robbo19."

,don_jon,2010-04-27T13:40Z,"Thanks for the upload man. Works, like all the other torrents of yours, perfectly"
,Thatray,2010-04-27T14:01Z,"Hey, there´s really something off about this torrent. I downloaded it earlier, and got an .wmv file that didn´t worked. Now i downloaded it again and got an norma . avi file.
Hope you guys find out what´s happening. Thanks torrentzone01, and keep up the good work.  "
,mvpetri,2010-04-27T14:39Z,"I'm confused 'cause the 18 episode was ""Knight Fall"" - april 19. The april 26 is the s06e19. I'm downloading to see if this is new. 
And it isn't fake. It is an .avi filme ;D"
,mrssnape,2010-04-27T15:19Z,"Its a very fine .avi, and the newest House episode. Not fake. You see, this is a trusted user. The skull is there for a reason! Thank you, torrentzone01."

It's Legit. Don't know why people are saying it's fake. Just wasting peoples time. 

Cheers for the upload. "
,madrox1,2010-04-27T18:32Z,When I first downloaded it last night it was the .wmv file that was very fake. But I redownloaded (without using the magnet link) and it is legit. Weird shit.
,zeobo,2010-04-27T19:54Z,"I can also confirm that when downloaded last night it is a fake file. However the name of the torrent is slightly different. I think what has happen is that a fake was on here last night and it has since been removed. The Link to the fake file is 
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5517956/House_S06E18_HDTV_XviD-LOL.5517956.TPB.torrent

as opposed to the real file
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5517911/House_S06E18_HDTV_XviD-LOL-NORAR.5517911.TPB.torrent

This hopefully is real :).

Please double check torrents before labeling one a fake

"
,scytheh,2010-04-27T22:31Z,It's real. Nice video/audio quality. The same as every 350mb - ~~40min .avi release.

,Arctikus,2010-05-07T05:12Z,"Thanks alot for this! Can't believe this torrent has 5k seeders and 600 leechers and only a few thank you comments, the rest being complaints."
,rzvlrsc,2010-05-08T22:49Z,people are so retarded! the file has nothing wrong with it! thank you!
,thefizdude,2010-09-14T04:45Z,"Very nice, thank you!!  It was a very quick download with plenty of seeds - it took only a couple of minutes (less than 3 minutes) to download whoohoo!!  Also very nice quality - consider it verified and recommended!!  Thanks torrentzone!!"
,chinthor,2011-08-02T04:43Z,Anyone got recommendations for software that lets you easily rip-convert episodes from DVD collections? Think libraries and netflix deliveries. Thanks!
