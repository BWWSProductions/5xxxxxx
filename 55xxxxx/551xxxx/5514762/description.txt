     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      The auditions continue. Judges Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan
      and Amanda Holden and a live audience see more of the thousands
      of hopefuls trying for the prize of 100,000 pounds and a slot at
      this year's Royal Variety Performance. The competition is open
      to any act of any age, and the judges see some of the best - and
      worst - talent in the country. Presenters Ant and Dec are on
      hand to support the performers before and after they face the
      judges.
      
     
     Notes.........                                                  
                                                       

      The DIAJ release is nuked for being oversized (it's 386MB).
      Also, they didn't include the codec in the dirname and their
      sample has been encoded separately from the main avi. 
      How do we know?
      Main avi: 624x336, CBR 128kbps audio 
      Sample: 624x352, VBR 122kbps avg audio
      Damn, some of these new UK groups make capping TV look hard...
