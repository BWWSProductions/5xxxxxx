SYNOPSIS:  Dragan Glavasic studied mathematics and philosophy in the United States... This book deals with reality and the most essential questions of philosophy.  But unlike other books, this book, actually, offer profound answers and original solutions to the ancient problems.  Most of all, it brings new ideas and concepts: such as the INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION as well as the IMMORTALITY ARGUMENT...


Ascertaining the Intellectual Horizon 

The latest book in philosophy by the author.  A logical outcome of the previous bookâ€¦ Published in 2008, it deals with various philosophical problems and presents their intricate solutions.  Not only that this book presents the Immortality Argument, thus demonstratesâ€”through the immense powers of philosophy and logicâ€”that we are, in our essence, fundamentally immortal beings: which, in its significance is the single most important proof ever made; but in addition, it also shows that our world is utterly insane and that most despicable lunatics and/or morbid perverts have all the power in their deadly grasps.
Even more significantly, it is a manifesto for intellectual revolution, when the most intelligent men should take over this doomed planet from the corrupt and the perverted sediments, from the poor servants of the rich crooks and even the wealthier thieves: as a way to develop Platoâ€™s ideal society and Nietzscheâ€™s Overman, as a way to obey the overwhelming laws of colossal nature and to fulfill our very reasons for being, our ulterior prime objective, the rudimentary Cosmic decreesâ€¦  After all, we are the consciousness, the eyes and the mind of this universe and the realityâ€¦
