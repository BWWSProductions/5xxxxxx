Sunday, 25 April 2010

The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


+++ HOWEVER, this show consists entirely of 
previously broadcast material, described on
the web site as :::


"In an encore presentation of the Alex Jones Show, 
Alex talks with Jane Graham, a ninth floor survivor of the Murrah federal building bombing in Oklahoma City who disputes the government version of events, 
Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, an ardent critic of the discredited theory of anthropogenic global warming, 
and Robert Bowman, a former Director of Advanced Space Programs Development for the U.S. Air Force who campaigned nationwide for the nomination of the Reform Party of the for President of the United States in 2000."

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
