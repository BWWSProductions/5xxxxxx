No "'88", "'89", "'93", "Reunion" or "Summer" remixes. No "20th Century Hits" by "Boney M. 2000". No "Boney M. feat. Mobi This" or "Sheila That". No "Boney M. vs. Something-Or-Other". No Christmas carols sung by no "Daddy Cool Kids". No "Megamix '88", "Megamix '92" or "Megamix 2006". No "original hit versions" with mysterious overdubs of synthesized hi-hats, snare drums, percussion and handclaps. No "original album versions" mysteriously fading out at 1:59 or 1:02 when the actual length of the track, as first released on 7", was 4:02. No chopped up 2:49 edits of well-known hits with intros/verses/choruses/middle-eights/instrumental breaks mysteriously missing. No fourteen-minute album suites mysteriously omitting four minutes. No 1:46 renditions of "Rivers of Babylon". No "digitally remastered" recordings mysteriously skipping a quarter of a bar here and thirty seconds there. No solo recordings by either the former band members or indeed the record producer himself mysteriously released under the moniker "Boney M." 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 years after the group effectively disbanded. 

 Just the original discography from the good old days, with the vast majority of all tracks as they actually sounded when most of us heard and bought them the first time around. In other words the full-length album and/or 7" versions plus extended 12" versions as recorded, mixed and released during the band's golden era, between the years 1976 and 1986, when Boney M. still was fronted by the original line-up: Marcia Barrett, Liz Mitchell, Bobbie Farrell and Maizie Williams (and/or Reggie Tsiboe). 

 Back in the day when they had 22 Top 10 hits in Germany, including 8 consecutive #1's, an achievement only surpassed by the Beatles and ABBA. When they set new sales and charts records as the singles "Rivers of Babylon"/"Brown Girl in the Ring" and "Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord" sold 3.4 million copies in the UK alone, all within the space of six months. When they had five consecutive #1 albums in most parts of Europe; "Take the Heat Off Me", "Love for Sale", "Nightflight to Venus", "Oceans of Fantasy" and "The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits". When they made both musical and political history by becoming the first ever Western band to be invited by the Soviet authorities to play 10 concerts in Moscow, a full decade before the Iron Curtain finally went up - this despite of the fact that their song about a certain Russian monk was officially banned in the USSR... 

 That golden decade when the Boney M. studio team, with the assistance of among others Keith Forsey, Harold Faltermeyer and Michael Cretu, produced one classic pop single after another, most of which technically were double A-sides; "Daddy Cool"/"No Woman No Cry", "Sunny", "Ma Baker"/"Still I'm Sad", "Belfast", "Rivers of Babylon"/"Brown Girl in the Ring", "Rasputin/"Painter Man", "Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord", "Gotta Go Home"/"El Lute", the list goes on and on. A fantastic success story that began more or less by mistake when German 'schlager' star Frank Farian recorded a disco track and released it under a pseudonym - a name taken from an Australian TV series - and then found himself in desperate need of a group of attractive dancers to lip-synch to the song on TV in Holland and Belgium, where "Baby Do You Wanna Bump" to everybody's great surprise had become a hit... Two of those dancers also turned out to be very talented singers and the rest is, as they say, history.

So: the original discography, including a few rarities and versions that you perhaps haven't heard since you last played your old Boney M. LP's some 25 years ago. Nothing more - nothing less. Classic Boney M. as most of us remember them. 

(...or possibly what you would expect to get if you bought a 9 disc box set called "The Complete Boney M."...) 

Enjoy!
