        Imagine  John  Lennon's  childhood...  A  spirited   teenager,
        curious, sharp and funny, growing up in the shattered city  of
        Liverpool.  Two  extraordinary sisters  tussle  for his  love 
        - Mimi, the formidable aunt who  raised him from the age of  5
        and Julia, the spirited mother who gave him up to Mimi's care.
        Yearning for a  normal family, John  escapes into art  and the
        new music flooding in from the US. His fledgling genius  finds
        a kindred  spirit in  the young  Paul McCartney.  But just  as
        John's new life  begins, the truth  about his past  leads to a
        tragedy he would never escape.
