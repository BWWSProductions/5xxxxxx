[T],ctang,2010-04-25T04:48Z,"@nightsongz2: damn that was faster than i could even leave a comment...lol

well i know i have been putting it off but next upload will be ""The Great Outdoors""...i have had this requested the most out of any movie so i went ahead and got it...ENJOY!!! :)"
[T],ctang,2010-04-25T04:49Z,"o and for the people that dont really read the info very close but read all the comments, this rental did NOT have any special features/estras"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-25T06:52Z,"dude... seriously? i just asked for this and its already up!?  

you are absolutely amazing haha.  thank you as always.

this movie is AMAZING!"
[T],ctang,2010-04-25T08:25Z,"i havent actually watched it yet

i am still really confused why Movie Gallery is putting out so many movies without any special features and only using 5.15GB of a DL disc"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-25T09:00Z,"yea that is pretty weird.  i use the Red Box and i use free movie rental codes on multiple credit cards of mine, friends and family seeing as you can use the code over again as long as it is on different credit cards.

i must have gotten about 500 free dvd rentals from the red box, all of which i have burnt for myself."
,Scratzz,2010-04-25T10:28Z,"Thanks for this one. Can someone please explain what ""Movie Gallery"" is? Is it simular to ""LoveFilm"" in Europe?"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-25T10:35Z,"@ Scratzz

Movie Gallery is just a place to rent movies and videogames here in the U.S."
,Scratzz,2010-04-25T11:04Z,"@zombiefuzz

,smokeyoumonkeys,2010-04-25T14:58Z,Thanks ctang love the movies you put out great quality and just as reliable as Fred. Thanks
,BabieGurl,2010-04-26T01:19Z,"It has finally arrived, Thank you for filling the request, much appreciated. keep doing your thing."
[T],ctang,2010-04-26T01:49Z,the next 24 hours i wont be seeding much at all since i wont be around an available network...sorry guys and gals
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-26T06:10Z,"haha everyone is at 48% i see.  it's all good.  patience is everything.  i hope everyone will be nice about this.  remember Ctang just saved everyone anywhere from $15-$25 for this dvd-r.

it's good catch up time for the people who just found this torrent.  you should have a decent amount of seeders now when it's done so that's good!

ctang is one of the best, hands down.

[T],ctang,2010-04-26T20:50Z,"back up and running again!!!!

thanks zombifuzz...much appreciated"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-26T21:22Z,not a problem man.  this movie is definately worth the wait.
[T],ctang,2010-04-27T19:08Z,i started watching it last night and it so far is pretty good
,FireSign,2010-04-27T23:43Z,"Pretty good movie, started very nicely, but there wasnt enough story between the ninja and the investigator - they acted like they knew eachother for years.. Also the ending was a bit disapointing, it felt as if the devs just got board and wanted to finish the movie quickly =[ .. Definately worth a watch tho!

Movie - 7.5/10 (just cause of the ending)
Scenes in Movie - 8.5/10 (Some really mint scenes!!)"
