The point of this is to get you to install the included backdoors on your computer rather than a virtual machine (unlikely since most VMs have no or little video memory and this is for games) and use your computer as a bot to steal your bandwidth, abuse your IP so you get caught for things not them, and to steal your personal information.  

It isn't to give you reliable access to Steam.  That's why no uploads from this guy before, and no reputation."
