     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      A quirky quartet of cooks go head to head in Belfast: dapper
      Nick Cann; burlesque stripper Nikki Fisher, who leaves culinary
      carnage in her wake; spiritualist Jacqueline McGarry, who claims
      that she speaks to the dead; and cage fighter Donal Kelly, who
      is confident that his American-themed menu will prove a knock
      out with his guests. But is Donal ready for a physical showdown
      with the diminutive Nick? And how do Donal's fellow diners like
      it when he takes it upon himself to tell them exactly what he
      thinks of them?

      Labelled with Official series number and town as we did
      previously. Episode guides are a mess. Good to see C4TV can't
      dupecheck. Another thing they fail miserably at.
