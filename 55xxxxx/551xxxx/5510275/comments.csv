I recommend that you don't look up a guide, as spoilers are everywhere. If you don't know the game's ending, don't look it up. I spoiled it for myself, but it's alright, I guess. It didn't ruin the experience (this is still my favorite game of all time), but it most certainly dulled it. If you already spoiled the game, don't worry. The game is still kick ass and lives up to, even surpasses it's reputation. "

I'm having one issue, when a cinamatic scene comes about the music fails every time."
,Uncle-Ren,2010-05-01T16:20Z,"The PC version has known problems with audio. I watched a Let's Play of the PC version, and it seems that the audio doesn't work right during cutscenes. "
,4evergr8ful,2010-05-06T02:01Z,This is a great torrent!:D Thanks so much! I had a bit of a problem with the audio but I just went into the advanced audio properties for my computer and turned off the hardware acceleration and that helped. Thanks again! Ill be seeding for awhile!:D
,xvickyx,2010-05-12T01:39Z,"I'm so confused... I thought I knew about this kind of thing, but... The first step is to ""install"" the game... How do I do that?"
,xvickyx,2010-05-12T03:41Z,"Oh wait... I got it. I have the game installed, but now I'm stuck at ""extract all files to the install dir"" part. I feel a fool."
,zmchugh5601,2010-05-13T01:52Z,"i am having problems with the FIRST STEP! when i try to install the game in the nocd crack, it says i need a bink32.dll or something like that. idk wtf to do, help?!"

,Angus42,2010-06-05T22:12Z,"Nope. Can't get it to work on Windows 7. The screen just goes black and when I try to change the core usage, the window won't show up in the task manager (I have a quad core processor)."
,micah1000,2010-06-13T02:46Z,"If you have trouble running this in windows 7 follow these instructions.

Navigate to wherever you installed the game C:/Program Files (or alternatively Program Files (x86)/Konami/Silent Hill 2/

There will be a file called sh2pc.exe (Or something along the lines of that name, either way, it will be an .exe file, a file you use to run or install programs). It is labeled ""Application"" under the ""Type"" section, NOT ""JPEG Image"".

Right click on that file

Go to the Compatibility Tab, Under the box labeled ""Compatibility Mode"", check the box, and from the drop-down list select ""Windows Vista""

On the privilege Level in that same tab, select ""Run This Program as an Administrator""

There are numerous saving, audio, and graphical issues. Running the program under compatibility for Windows Vista and also running the program as an administrator will fix most of the problems, including the saving problem.

If you have audio issues, install the sound patch (google it)

Also, you may want to try running it in XP compatibility mode instead of vista."
,Uncle-Ren,2010-07-20T14:11Z,"I'm glad that even though the game's been out for nearly a decade, it's still generating interest. I hope the people attempting to run to run this using Windows 7 can manage to get it running; it's difficult to start up on Vista."
