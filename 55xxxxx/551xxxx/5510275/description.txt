If you have a computer with more than one core, you have to set it so that the game runs on one core via the task manager. This game is made for Windows operating systems, but users with other operating systems may be able to emulate it. I'll be seeding this until this computer breaks, I die, or am arrested. A blackout may stop me from seeding temporarily. When you finish downloading, please seed. That would really help.


You play as James Sunderland, explore a town, and have fun with the locals. Enjoy~
