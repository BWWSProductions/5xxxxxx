Drunken Tiger (apparently now just composed of the energy-crazed Tiger JK) presents their 8th... a double-CD album - "Feel gHood Muzik: the 8th wonder" - 27 solid tracks.  Encoding is 192kbps for your listening pleasure.  I never appreciated Tiger JK until I saw him bang up "Monster" - so go searchfor that right now...

Enjoy.
