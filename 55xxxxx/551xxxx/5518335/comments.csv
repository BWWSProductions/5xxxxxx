I think other matey thought you meant HD as in High definition, not the release group.

The site which TPB matey uploading is re-upping from, usually change the filename of XWT's own caps, DSR version from 'X' himself or MDE etc.

XWT take pride in their own releases and it will be a little better than HDTV if this is the usual XWT renamed to mastitorrents they just rename it and re release on public.

As is clearly the case here.

WWE.Draft.Raw.04.27.10.DSR.XviD-XWT.avi 
as currently upped on extratorrent earlier and first instance.

Same filesize etc, original public re-up, this has followed with mastitorrents renamed over XWT at end of original filename.

Which i wish people wouldn't do, XWT deserve credit even if it later becomes obvious it's an XWt release upon watching, upping torrent etiquatte dictates prop's are given to source, but i think mastitorrents have had membership issues with XWT and remove the XWT tag purely out of puerile spite as much as anything else, like others have done in the past

So it will be decent matey.

Hope that answers your question adequately pooloop.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2010-04-27T19:58Z,"To correct myself. doh.

Didn't see XWT mentioened in stat's on this page and is still in filename, just not in torrent header.

Doh!!! Indeed.

My mistake, nice of them to actually mention source, when i first noticed they weren't but obviously are now.

Man, i got to start being a bit more observant.

Oh well.

Peace. : )"
