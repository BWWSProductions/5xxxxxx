,inhalien,2010-04-25T15:40Z,This is a HDTV rip  
,rago1986,2010-04-25T15:58Z,lol @ inhalien no its not a hdrip its a standard t.v. rip
,rago1986,2010-04-25T16:01Z,also @ inhalien if it was a hdtv it would say WEC.HDTV.FULL.EVENT.XVID and i have just D/l it and watched it and it is not HDTV rip
,inhalien,2010-04-25T17:28Z,Just so you know Rago1986 The file was scooped from the XS release.Original filename was WEC.48.PPV.HDTV.XviD-XS It's not the best Quality but nonetheless still a HDTV rip.
,rago1986,2010-04-25T17:39Z,"ok cool inhalien i have seen that rip knocking round, but its is no were near hdtv quality thats why i was disputing it, for a 1.57gb.avi the quailty is poor, but kyr should upload a nice rip soon he has just done the pe-lims"
,parm9015,2010-04-25T19:48Z,"It pretty sad when you have over 10,000 people downloading and or NOT seeding a file that everyone wants. The rule of thumb being, If it takes you x ammount of time to download it, then have the common courtesy to upload it for that ammount of time. I am so sick of these leechers who will not upload and seed anything. Their asses should be booted of the network..ASSHOLES>.."
,maxchillen,2010-04-25T20:19Z,seed! assholes!
,Robdog0077,2010-04-26T02:20Z,"I'm barely getting 30 kB/s even with 3000 seeders.  I'm pretty new to torrents, but I have previously seen much higher speeds on other torrents.

Is this normal behavior?"
,Eiht,2010-04-26T07:16Z,Was out of sync for me.  May have just been me.  Had to run it at +200ms on the mythbox.
,Jonathan.Bacon,2010-04-26T21:03Z,@ miker00lz     Go fuck yourself with a rusty knife you miserable cunt
,Robin9876,2010-04-26T22:51Z,"Mr. S.45 in the beginning of this thread, you were absolutely right! Chan Sung Jung vs. Leonard Garcia fight was something else....! (last fight of the recordings, after last live Aldo vs. Faber)

I have watched UFC and MMA from UFC 50 and that fight is easily top 10 fights of all time. They were like cartoons fighting :D They were tired in the 3rd, still they were throwing complicated kicks and other hard stuff. What a great fight!"
,gabriel1475,2010-04-27T06:57Z,"The quality on this video sucks black welfare ass! The other one which is 2GB looks great. 

And by the way, why do pathetic closet homosexuals feel the need to post spoilers? Whats in it for them? Does this have something to do with their grandmothers? Do their former-prostitute mothers have something to do with it? How about the uncle that touched them in the ""bad place""? Everything is cause-n-effect you know. Overall, it shows a great lack of class and tact. But when your mom is a former hooker, how important is class and tact anymore? When that's the world you live in, why NOT post spoilers, eh? It makes a lot of sense."
,q20torrentreviewer,2011-01-31T01:41Z,"thanks, Great quality!
