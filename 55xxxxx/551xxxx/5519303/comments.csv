,sudopinion,2010-04-30T05:45Z,"""...Let's just say this film is bad beginning to end. I don't want to sugar coat it, or give anyone a reason to see it. I'm not even sure how you can find a copy, but if you can, just ignore it and hope that it crawls under a rock and dies. The story isn't interesting, the characters have no depth, the songs are too many and not particularly good, the camera work is so poor that this lies between home video quality and the SyFy Channel.  I'm not sure what possesses people to assemble a cast to make bad movies, but they must be stopped...."""
