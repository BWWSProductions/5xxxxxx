,thefrozen999,2010-04-25T18:09Z,"well...seed a little so other could enjoy.I could get a lot of versions from private trackers with maximum speeds, but zektorm remains my favourite.Small size, astonishing quality.Best ripper in my opion.

I know my comment won't count for shit, but, seed at least to let others know of zektorm quality rips."

this is good quality as well"
,muk0690,2010-04-26T11:54Z,Come on zektorm.... seed well and prove those lame morons wrong.... I know about the quality
,thefrozen999,2010-04-26T16:54Z,"doh, If I wasn't a zektorm fanboy, I would've stopped downloading this.What the hell, man? 20 hours and 47 procents?

 I could download the other one, but I hate other releases.Mine must say: BDRIP H264-ZEKTORM.I have all bluray releases of zektorm and I want this one also.
How come? 7 seeders?What the hack? Medium speed in utorrent-219 B/s???"
