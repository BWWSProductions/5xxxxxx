,gcaver,2010-05-02T21:47Z,"A = 9
V = 9
Movie = -10, F-, epic fail.

This is the Lifetime Movies version of a war movie.  It is just insulting to anyone who loves war movies - I couldn't even finish it.

For true war movie enthusiasts... this movie is fucking horrible.  Shit, even for ANY movie enthusiasts... this movie is fucking horrible.  I seriously think it was made by a high school A/V club of Seattle hippy vegetarian teens - or - a woman (with no offense to Katherine Bigelow of course).  It's even worse than that steaming pile of shit Miracle At St. Anna.  The acting is godawful, the dialogue is laughable (literally, you will laugh at how these guys deliver their lines), the costumes and props are horribly inaccurate and fake, and the whole script is just mind-blowingly bad.

Calling this a war movie - hell, even a MOVIE - is being way too gracious.  I am 100% positive I've seen better shit in WWII TV-movies."

,Army21B,2010-05-29T09:39Z,"ok gcaver. so it might be a bad movie but hell its our country's past. how about you shut up and support our troops past, present, and future. especially since its memorial day weekend. 

I'll be over there soon brothers and sisters. 4 weeks and a wake up. Afghanistan here I come! Hooah!"
,User897,2010-06-15T10:56Z,"Well I've watched the film and had to come back.  Many thanks to agentpiratebay for uploading this.

It was a major struggle to get all the way through this movie.  Was it because of the subject matter?  No.  Was it because of the intense emotions experienced when having a look into history, especially because my Dad was there?  No.  The plain and simple truth is because this film was an absolute piece of shit.  I tried to give this travesty a little elbow room, but I just couldn't in the end.  It is inaccurate, the ""actors"" are terrible, and there was nothing believable about what the lens was capturing.  I sure hope that someday the 94th gets a movie, or two, or TEN, that are worthy of being seen.  My Dad passed away in 2008, so luckily he never saw this complete and utter failure.

I downloaded two copies of this film at the same time while I was sleeping, so this comment will appear on both pages.

Thanks again to the uploader.  If I paid for this, I woulda really been pissed."
,User897,2010-06-15T10:57Z,"Oops, I meant raymondhome, sorry."
,mrja,2010-06-18T16:26Z,"great movie.

but,thas any one know where do i can find subtitles for this movie?"
,jengiscan,2011-06-23T12:42Z,"HEY its not Saving private Ryan but it is actually not bad at all.
However if you do want to see the WORST II world war movie EVER!
Let me recommend 'Brothers War' it is the worst film I have ever seen, EVER. 
Its on here somewhere. Download it and laugh your fucking ass off! Really do watch and post back on here what you thought!"
