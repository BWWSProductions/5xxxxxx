My rip from Brazilian DVD. Subpack with English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subs.

In the suburb of Sampaio, Zulmira visits a fortune teller (Madame CrisÃ¡lida) who advises her to be careful with a 'blonde woman'. When her unemployed husband, Toninho, returns home she tells him about what Madame CrisÃ¡lida had to say, and guesses that the "blondie" might be her neighbor and cousin Glorinha. However, in their boring life, soccer is the relief valve of the mediocre. Toninho that is actually worried about the final soccer game of the "Carioca" (from Rio de Janeiro) Championship where his team Vasco will play against Fluminense. He does not pay much attention in his wife. Zulmira develops a morbid fixation and goes out into the rain where she catches pneumonia, forcing Toninho to promise her a dream funeral, upon her death.
