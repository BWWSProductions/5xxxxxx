The rating system is abused by trolls. Jealous nobodies in real life whose contribution to P2P is zero.

,CosmicKeys,2011-01-29T03:03Z,"@gizmol1212 - You're wrong, it's your player. MPC does the same thing for me, but not VLC or WMP.

Subtitles are out of sync though, searching for more now.

@room101bellboy - Awesome film, many thanks."
,sunawavi,2011-02-11T09:46Z,"This is the new Kino restoration. 10/10 and another 10 for Kino. The subtitles are wrong because they are mistakenly for a previous version.  Correct subs are freely available in several languages at Podnapisi Use HD titles for CiNEFiLE--identical timing.  Titles #14 & 165 in English need correction: replace garbage with e, and all is excellent. Genuinely appreciate the upload!"

You probably got so many (-)-s because the AR display is totally wrong.
 It shouldn't be 16/9, everyone can see that on snap shots, the people should be a lot taller.
Imdb says 1.25 AR, 
and bluray.com says:
""Aspect ratio: 1.25 : 1 
Original aspect ratio: 1.33:1""
The diference between 16/9 and 4/3 is huge!

Battleship.Potemkin.1925.720p.BluRay.x264-CiNEFiLE  Got it right!
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6238140/Battleship.Potemkin.1925.720p.BluRay.x264-CiNEFiLE
AR: 912 x 720   (1,26)
Check before upload to avoid negative critics."
