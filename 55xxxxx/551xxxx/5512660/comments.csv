thanks FXG

,tzaxo,2010-04-24T23:08Z,"bancapitalism: Have you went through all of the evidence that says God is real and proven it wrong? No you haven't. No one can, there's too much. So shh and keep that crap to yourself if you think it. Don't infect others.

And for the record, not that you will believe me. God does show Himself, in many ways, daily for me. Get to know Him before you deny Him."

,golpster,2010-04-25T02:27Z,top quality no doubt :) thank you.
,libertaswv,2010-04-25T07:01Z,"As people have noted, slight syncing problem....apparently fixable with VirtualDUB. Anyone feel like rec'ing a version number for VirtualDUB (if that matters)?

It was cool having the extra scenes stuck on after the credits, even w/out sound (since FxG always includes the eng subs)

Thanks again for the up, guys (thx to seeders as well)

,someonegotmyusername,2010-04-25T12:00Z,"yeh god shows himself every day, by letting priests molest little boys, and letting rich men get richer while millions starve in africa. if god is real then he's a complete cunt and i don't need him."

And if god is real, i cant wait to meet her.

Its not a man, lets face it..... if god was a man, there is NO WAY he would have put the testicles on the OUTSIDE for anyone to kick !

But in all seriousness, i dont believe there is a power controlling everything....but ""most"" people (not all) who do have faith, are generally better people for it. So i just let them get on with it.... Just stop trying to push the crap on people who dont believe it.

download VLC player for free and install, after instaled open the movie and go to the tools menu on VlC player and press track synchronization, you will see a window saying ""advance of sound over video"" and adjust the sound to mach the video, the best value i found was + 0.500.
hope it works for you guys."

Thank you very much, finally some usefull comments. I do have VLC, but never saw that function.

,free_loader,2010-05-18T19:46Z,"I've not downloaded the movie, dont really want to, but couldnt help reading all your messages. Your all very funny.
Consider this though, its pointless wasting time devoting yourself to god or religion. You dont get to see it until after your dead. If it is really there then what is the point in devoting all of that time to it.
It will still be there after you've died and if it isnt there then what a massive waste of time it would be.
Enjoy your life, you dont get very long so stop wasting your time and do some good with it."
,DrLe,2010-05-20T23:56Z,"Just like others said, open up VLC, then open up this movie, go to Tools --> Track Synchronization --> increase the length to 0.300 s under ""Advance of audio over video"". That should mostly sync it."

,dlarrym,2010-06-22T20:57Z,"@bancapitalism: You are insane.  is TOTALLY CORRECT!!!  

If you do your home work, Most Theoretical Physicist understand that Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, and the tried and true: Theory of Special Relativity, PROVE the existence of God. There is a very HIGH level of organization in our universe that is too perfect to claim that random events like dust swirling around produced a planet that is so precisely placed that even a 5 degree variation in the planets axis of rotation would cause Earth to be a very different place.  The tides would be so varied and the temperature swings would be such, that life as we know it couldn't survive on earth. I do believe that animals evolve and adapt to a changing environment, because GOD designed them with that safety mechanism. You call  it Evolution and for some unknown reason, Believe God played no part in this... How dumb are you! 

BOTTOM LINE
Wrap your head around this example:

If you found a printed circuit board buried in an Egyptian tomb that was carbon dated to be as old as the tomb itself (say 12,000 yrs old). It would be INSANE to claim that it formed from random events. 
The -PHENOLIC- (the green material that most PCB's are made on. It is the material that the circuits themselves are etched into.) contain fiberglass, epoxy, and other trace elements, If a PCB was found and was dated at 12,000 years old, you Would try to claim (like the NON CREATION people believe), that the copper was deposited onto the PCB from water bringing the copper to the board and all the semiconductors, operational amplifiers, all the resisters and transistors, all the diodes and coils and so on. THIS is as crazy as thinking a HUMAN skeleton was deposited and made from many random events. 

THEY couldn't be formed from water depositing these various elements used in the PCB's making (especially parts like DIODES and CAPACITORS, which are made in totally different way), wouldn't you have to see that an intelligent being made this PCB even though it was made at a time man was not know to have this kind of technology. So since you cannot find or see the intelligent Being that made it, I guess you would feel the same way you do about all things you cannot explain, that random events must have made it. Well a computer board is NO more likely to have been made from random events then a HUMAN can be made from such factors. . .

A human had to be engineered and made. Just because you and the rest of our HUMAN race is ignorant of how to make and engineer tissues, organs, A HUMAN BRAIN, Nerve tissue, and every other part of the body and ultimately a complete human IS NOT PROFF POSITIVE that it cannot be done. A Highly advanced Life form, (Like GOD) may find this an easy task. SORRY to inform you, HUMANS ARE NOT THE SMARTESt CREATURES IN THE UNIVERSE. ONLY those people that think HUMANS ARE THE MOST INTELLIGENT are the ones who are NOT capable of seeing that a Higher power may be the reason we are all Here!!! I rest my case."
