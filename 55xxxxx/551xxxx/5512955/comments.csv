,20PPC,2010-04-30T19:10Z,"Dear Tanauser, could make a patch that just adds the offcial new NTW units only for those of us who don't want the extra ETW units and other mods? Thank you."
,m33st4,2010-05-01T06:39Z,so this will add new units and not replace units from the DLC you have uploaded?
[T],Tanauser,2010-05-01T13:16Z,"These are the 6 original NTW units (release by Steam) .
there are no extra units in this pack

Playable in any case . just drop the pack inside your data"
