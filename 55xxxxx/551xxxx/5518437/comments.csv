,rugburn11,2010-04-27T17:40Z,"Remember to upgrade your Utorrent to 2.0.1 and your DL will be much much faster....

and always use PeerGuardian 2

 ...protect yourself...
its free and it stops them from seeing your ip address...have this running whenever your on The Pirate Bay...remember they are always watching us.

Your welcome..."
,Fuckinoob,2010-04-29T22:46Z,"Works fine thanks. How about 6.6.3.9? Need keys for newer protections.

uTorrent used to be the bomb. Now it's old and busted. This is the new hotness.

,Fuckinoob,2010-04-30T22:58Z,Yeah deluge needs work. It installed fairly easily but I don't like the fact I have to install GTK2 runtimes. I'll check out Tixati.
,DavidGGG,2010-05-01T11:44Z,BIG thank you! I didn't even have to uninstall the old version. And now I can watch my Avatar Blu-Ray! And thanks to AnyDVD I don't have to update the players.
,DavidGGG,2010-05-05T21:00Z,"...or not. Avatar Blu_ray works fine, however AnyDVD is no longer able to change region of DVDs after I installed this, not even DVDs of the same region as the player plays. I recommend downloading the trial from Slysoft then get the key from the 6.6.4.2. torrents, works fine."
