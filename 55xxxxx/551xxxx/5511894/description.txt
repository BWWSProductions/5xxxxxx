NOTES:
imagines release looked lifeless to me...changed the saturation a touch and added
slight magenta lowered the yellow due to was quite heavy and added a tint of
cyan.. also added video denoise and sharpness, and contrast and brightness, loaded
avs script in tmpgenc and used 1 or 2 of those color filters to.. used rx audio
which sounds mint, overall i think it looks and sounds great! 


Sample Included!

Enjoy ;)

Another police movie starring Bruce Willis.

This movie was originally uploaded by PrisM but contained many RAR files.  This is uploaded again but this time the content is in a more usable AVI file.  The size of the torrent is very close to the same size as the RAR torrent but is much cleaner.  I don't know why people want to create torrents with so many RAR files when one AVI file will do just fine.
