,Koudai2008,2012-01-17T00:21Z,"Works good so far. I haven't tried to burn anything yet because I don't have any blank cds or dvds, though.

just follow the instructions. After clicking ""OK"", the program says that it doesn't have a trial version and that it will now close.

After that is when you click ""AutoLoader_AxLaUn.exe"""
