n.a.K. House Mix X - A Beastie Boys Mix (XXIV-IV-MMX)

Brought to you by www d0t musicthroughscience d0t com


Hey, I'm back once again.  Hopefully just in time.  Here to announce and release my latest work to all my fans and followers.  I appreciate all the amazing comments I've been getting through my website, torrents and by work of mouth.  This is a great passion of mine and I'm happy to bring amazing beats and music your way.  Please stay tuned as this is only the beginning. 

My latest mix touches on an amazing hip-hop group of our time, the Beastie Boys.  I had loads of their acappella tracks lying around so I thought I should put them to good use.  I hope you like! Some amazing tracks by Luis Espinoza, Dan Curtin, and Mason to check out plus a few classics thrown in the mix.  This mix was a bit of a battle but I'm finally finished.  Let me know what you think.  Remember, turn it up and keep dancing.......


Cheers,

n.a.K.
