Hey all! This is my first upload here! :D


Anyways,

This is a working version of Vray with RT for Max 2010 x64.Included in the file is Solidrocks 0.85b and Vrayscatter 2.5.5.

Instructions:

1. Download and extract all the files
2. Install SP3a (reason being the RT installer won't work if you have sp4a installed)
3. After installing SP3a, install vray RT.
4. After RT is done, uninstall SP3a and install SP4a.
5. Once you're complete, copy the 2 dll's and the one xml inside the crack directory to your max directory.

Ive included RT1.5 sp1a(file :Proper_1.5_Sp1a) which is the latest.With this the instalation process is Vray 1.5 SP4a >>>> RT SP1a>>>>> Apply crack. So u skip steps 2 and 3. Havent done this so its a guess i used the first method and installed RT sp1a afterwards.

Vray scatter :
1. copy and paste vrayscatter.dlo file 3ds Max 2010pluginsvrayplugins

2. copy and paste VrayScatterSettings.ms file to 3ds Max 2010scriptsStartup

Solirocks :
Enter the last 8 digits of the req code.


I have not tested this. I am just uploading it but people report it working and they say it is also working with Max 2011.

Have fun and don't forget to seed! :D
