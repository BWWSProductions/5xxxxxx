,syso01,2010-04-24T04:47Z,Forgot to mention that people report this working with Max 2011 too. :)
,syso01,2010-04-24T04:51Z,"LOL, I've just noticed that I DID write in description it should work with Max 2011 XD

Sorry, I'm tired haha, anyways, I'll test it tomorrow but it should work."
,syso01,2010-04-24T16:58Z,"OK, I've tested it and it is working like a charm!

,jkinst,2010-04-27T17:55Z,"Hey man, is there a vray RT version for x86, or does only work for 64 bit machines?"
,syso01,2010-04-28T00:39Z,This is 64-bit only. When I find 32 bit I will upload it.
,moeinsat,2010-05-06T13:45Z,"thank you syso01 ! Great upload , I was looking for these vray tools almost for a couple of months .
that would be really fantastic if you upload AutoGrass for V-Ray too.
I bet you' ll be the first one on the net who uploads it.
thanks a lot ...
I am looking forward to hear from you again."
