,Teddikilla,2011-03-16T13:10Z,"First of all, thanks. 
Second is the problem.
I downloaded another torrent, same size. And Idk which one has better quality. You see, this torrent has better colour, it's more vibrant and less pixelated. So it has good picture, but the framerate is bad. in parts where the camera scrolls it gets very choppy. The other torrent has much better framerate and doesn't feel like it's laggy. So what's better lol? Good picture and shit framerate?
Or decent picture and good framerate?"
,Teddikilla,2011-03-20T07:55Z,"Just wanted to say that the framerate wasn't as bad as I thought at first, you will get used to it, it's not horrible. It'd be great if you could upload Naruto shippuden english dubs too :]"
