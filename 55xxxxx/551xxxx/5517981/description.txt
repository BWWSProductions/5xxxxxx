The only torrents out for this are either large ISO files, or video files broken down by chapter/subchapter, making it a royal pain in the ass to watch.  This torrent fixes that...  :)

One disc per .mp4 file, and all the content in each video is organized just like how it would play on the DVD.

If you are having any problems playing it, use VLC Media Player, and you are good to go.

The Art of the Dynamic Handgun is a 4-disc DVD set featuring over
seven hours of actual live fire class instruction and additional
instructional material.

Using a diverse group of beginner, intermediate, and advanced
students, instructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa guide the class
from the fundamentals of handgun operation, to problem solving, and
through complex real-life scenarios. This progression from basic to
advanced weapon manipulation pushes students of all skill levels to
their failure points, illustrating how even the best shooters can
advance and excel.
