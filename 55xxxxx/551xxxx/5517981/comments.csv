,7itanium,2010-04-30T08:47Z,"I just played all 4 on VLC, and it worked perfectly.  Perhaps try updating it?

Can anyone else confirm or deny these claims?  If this is the case, I will try changing formats, and re-upping it, if that is what it needs to come to."

,keystoneclimber,2012-05-06T23:50Z,"As tawei has previously stated, these have problems.  Testing to see if it plays in VLC is not considered comprehensive testing.  The supposed "".mp4"" format does not work on XBOX 360.  Furthermore, handbrake is unable to load the files for transcoding.  These are NOT standard mp4 files!!!"
