Shot in 1969, "Nelson Cavaquinho" was made as a counterpoint to "Garota de Ipanema". Instead of Bossa Nova and uptown Rio de Janeiro, Hirszman's interest turn to Brazilian popular music's roots. As a result we have a beautiful and pungent record of Nelson Cavaquinho in his environment, talking to friends and neighbors, in his house or in the bar.
