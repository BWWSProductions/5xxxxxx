@ALL: Audio type has been changed. It would be nice to report back is it playable on different devices. On computers is OK... but LOL... I already know that. Thanks in advance."

@htctouch: [quark]s cannot be done by using any of publicly available software.
In case of [quark] Avisynth is bad idea, since he has (both DirectShowSource and AviSource in Avisynth) nasty tendency to skip frames (duplicated OR skipped OR missing in the source). It causes severe and unrepairable Audio de-sync and in general, I avoid Avisynth in [quark]s and use it only if input must be repaired, as in cases of CAMs or TS - but these are in general encoded as 272p."
