,cthon98,2010-04-27T09:43Z,"Volume 4 doesn't come with a bonus TRACK, just some bonus pictures, and it doesn't like me submitting torrents that contain anything other than music files here. As far as bonus tracks from 1-3, I'll have to buy the volumes at some point to get the content."
,Heliouse,2010-04-27T23:56Z,"I do not know if 2 - 4 have a bonus track, but since you two have gone through all the trouble of getting 1-4 otherwise, I can purchase the first one if need be. 

Homestuck is amazing enough I don't mind supporting the writer."

I have to turn my volume up so loud that normal noises hurt my ears to even hear these tracks clearly."
