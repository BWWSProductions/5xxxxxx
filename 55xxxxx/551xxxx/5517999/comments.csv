,honunet,2010-04-27T06:54Z,"@tzonet:::

 Skulls dont necessarily mean its not fake, look at the first torrent up djstiba has a green vip skull and his is fake as SHIT. but torrentzone1 is a good uploader so u can always trust him.  Nowadays, you have to actually know the uploader and not just see the skull and assume its real"

And i do know how to read and never had problems with AVIs before...  what am I doing wrong?? (i actually registered to ask this question)"

,Diskjoe,2010-04-27T10:22Z,Such a shame that a good uploader like torrentzone gets so much shit from so many dick heads
,zofo,2010-04-27T10:47Z,Works just fine with VLC. Thanks!
,Teempla,2010-04-27T12:31Z,"Downloading 2kb/s. How cool is that, then?

,iceman1813,2010-04-27T12:42Z,@GDRFB77...you need to plug in your computer....works fine for me...thanks uploader
,GDRFB77,2010-04-27T14:10Z,"@Iceman1813 ha ha ha thanks so fucking much. and you are as funny a helpful. if you don't have a clue keep your fucking opinion to yourself.  and @diskjoe fuck you if you think i was being a dick head for *asking for some fucking help*  and FWIW the torrent i dl from VTV worked FINE so obviously me, and the other 30% of people (judging from comments) are having problems) are having problems with THIS torrennt. Not with tehir computers not with their attitudes. With the MTFKNG Torrent, So you can be full-of-yourself assclowns, and make snide remarks and be defensive and tell people to STFU or you can EXPLAIN what is obviously missing from their systems or what they have to dl or what they have to reset....  and if you don't know why it doesn't work, then SHUT THE FUCK UP with your smarmy snide bullshit. Remember: what you are doing is still illegal-- there used to be honor among thieve, not snotty little bullshit from people so fucking proud behind their computer screens. If you can't help people, and still have a need to comment, and call them dick heads-- fuck off & die"
,iceman1813,2010-04-27T14:50Z,@GDRFB77....relax already...did you try plugging in your computer and then turning it on?
,GDRFB77,2010-04-27T15:35Z,"@iceman  again, ha ha ha ha you are as funny as you are helpful. Bozo, I already watched the dl that i got from VTV (which i downloaded after torrnetzone01's was nothing but a jackson pollak painting on acid on VLC-- and where i needed more DRM shit to watch it on mediaplayer) so again the problem is not my unplugged computer. I'm a fucking genius who can not only dl + watch a video but also comment to your bullshit without my motherfucking computer plugged in. so again, you again, are just so helpful. AND ANYONE ELSE WHO CAN'T BOTHER TO HELP PEOPLE (sure one or two said it was fake-- i don't think so) PEOPLE ASK FOR HELP AND YOU SHIT OUT INNANITIES LIKE YOU'RE FUNNY OR SOMETHING?? again, if there's no honor amongst thieves y'alls can just fuck off"
,GDRFB77,2010-04-27T15:39Z,"sorry Iceman for referencing Jackson Pollock. I;m sure that got you confused. he was a painter. His paintings look like the shit that torrnetzone01's video looks like, without the missing DRM or something...  but can't obviously ask yallz 'cause anyone who does is called a dickhead or told to STFU.....   nice fucking group. I was always told that the people commenting at the pirate bay were snooty assholes. never had to ask for help before. and never been called a dick head for asking for help. Hope you act this way in the real world. do it in a bar some day to a big guy and see how well your smarmass comments fly"

,jmanc82,2010-04-27T19:33Z,"I think there's a trojan or something going round. I'm having this problem with every video torrent I donloaded today. It's not a result of this one I can assure you that, but something seem to have got onto a lot of computers and is causing the problem.

Torrentzone1, you'll have to let these comments wash over your head, there is a problem but it's not your fault. You're just the first thing to be balmed by some people. I appreciate the work you've done to upload what you have so far and I hope (once I get this problem sorted) that you continue, it's much appreciated."
,cerca,2010-04-27T20:02Z,"It's not fake, it works fine."
,Bob__Dole,2010-04-28T00:56Z,"Attention KMart Shoppers!

It is encoded as listed.

It plays fine (for me w/Media Player Classic Home Cinema).

Often if your player seems to suddenly be broken it is because you uninstalled software that undoes changes it didn't know about.  For example the codecs you ""think"" are still installed may not be and/or are misconfigured, and they can't fix themselves even if the installer gives you a ""reregister"" or ""fix"" type of shortcut routine to use.

Instead you may be forced to uninstall and reinstall the codecs, particularly the one you're using for XVID, or even the video player itself if it has built in codecs and filters.

If you can't be bothered to do that, I guess you didn't want to watch the video very badly..."

,kiwij,2010-04-28T03:01Z,"Great torrent, thanks torrentzone01!!!

All the haters are just trolling for a reply, and the users that can't play the video are just idiots and I'm suprised they figured out how to DL the torrent in the first place.

I recommend either VLC or MPC-HC for playing videos (both use internal codecs/filters).  MPC-HC supports hardware acceleration."
,stupiditymoron,2010-04-28T12:22Z,"works perfectly fine, keep updating us torrentzone01. Thanks"

,cool_lavander,2010-04-28T15:21Z,thanks torrenzone1! never mind the bad comments..
,honunet,2010-04-30T00:52Z,"does somebody have some valium for gdrfb77? preferably one laced with arsenic? I am the first one to flame a faker, and have no stake whatsoever in torrentzones ups, but I dled this then watched the shit out of it on WMP.  Also plays on VLC and I am guessing real player or whatever other goddamn player I have.  So before you flame him, look at your own setup.  Just because you have some amped up pc that allows you to play call of duty in your underwear while talking to another flamer in Iran while jacking off listening to queens greatest hits, does not mean you are setup to watch every movie file.  If you dont like his downloads, fuck off somewhere else, i am guessing he wont cry about it."
