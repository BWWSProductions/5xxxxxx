,Bob__Dole,2010-08-03T16:55Z,"Even if it were freeware, that it is made portable so we don't all have to individually do that is helpful.

Thank you."
,toastysoul,2011-05-30T19:53Z,"If it's free, why wouldn't you share it?

You think only paid media should be shared?

Thanks for making this portable, came in real handy, and saved me the trouble."

Fuck these people. Ignore 'em. If this works as advertised and is as easy and simple as recruitRu says then you have my thanx. If it's free it's worth what you paid for it. Quit yer Bitching.
