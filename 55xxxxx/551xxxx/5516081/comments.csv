Video was chipped a few times (once every 5 or 10 minutes) during the movie. Apart from that, perfectly clear and stable.
Included subtitles (English ones) were poor, (spaces in the middle of words etc) but perfectly timed

All-in-all: perfectly watchable but not if you're picky imo

The movie IS touching and does have a great story, however the ending did not live up to my expectations"
