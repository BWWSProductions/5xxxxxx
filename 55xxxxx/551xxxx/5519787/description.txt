"The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle"

When the body of a rich adventure-seeker is found in 
a hotel laundry machine, Booth and Brennan are led 
to the last place he was seen: a Rock n Roll Fantasy 
Camp. While Brennan and Booth lead the investigation 
outside the lab, Hodgins, Angela and intern Arastoo 
(guest star Pej Vahdat) use a fragment of 
prehistoric wooly mammoth tusk - found with the 
remains - and Angela's knowledge of the music 
industry to connect the evidence to potential 
suspects. Meanwhile, Cam looks for a doctor for her 
daughter Michelle.

Enjoy :)
