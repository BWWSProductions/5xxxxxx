Plot: Spartacus is taken captive by the Romans and sold into slavery. The buyer is a trainer of gladiators. Spartacus is trained as and in time becomes a champion gladiator. Spartacus gains the trust and respect of his owner and the other gladiators but to what end?

A well written adaptation for television. The the cast and crew have created an excellent show. One of the better film projects from New Zealand.

It will prove interesting where the show goes from here.

This torrent contains all 13 episodes of the first season.
