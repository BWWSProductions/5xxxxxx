Amazon.com review:

"I love this album! If you liked the music from Azumanga Daioh, this will probably appeal to you as well, as they are both performed by the Kuricorder Orchestra. Still, this album has its own style, and many of the tracks are sparse, with only a few instruments or sound effects. This is essentially a soundtrack of Yotsuba's typical day, beginning with the tranquility of dawn, then the alarm clock, a peaceful snooze, the alarm clock again, and on to playing, visiting the neighbors, bothering Dad while he's working, and so on."
