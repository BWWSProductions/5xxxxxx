This album, consists almost entirely of cover versions, and is their probably (in my opinion) best album. The material ranges from Blind Boy Fuller and Skip James (two more splendid 'homageâ€™s') to rhythm and blues tunes as well-known as 'Big Boss Man', 'Little Red Rooster' and 'The Things I Used To Do', but everything is confidently assimilated and reworked, with just enough flavour of the originals remaining to season the stew. On 'Blake's Rag', Wiggins's taste for the frantic pays dividends as he conjures up a harmonica analogue of Blake's guitar acrobatics
