Just some pictures I've taken. I lost a lot of them in a recent hard drive partitioning gone bad. >_>

There were supposed to be over 700 pictures in this download but.. It's more like.. 50. Oh well. Here ya go. Enjoy. -greentylermw

Please comment letting me know if you like them.

P.S. I just found some of the pictures I thought I lost. Not many but the ones that i liked the most. They'll be in Volume 2. If you like these there will be more in the next. Hopefully at least 500 pics. Coming July 9th. (Yes I already have a set date)
