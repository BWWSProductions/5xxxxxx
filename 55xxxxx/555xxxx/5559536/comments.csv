Works like a charm.

I have been waiting for this one for some time now. A long time ago I was close to donating cash to the author of Gamemaker, but after the YoYo Games thing, I would never buy it.

Also, check out the cross-platform game maker called ""game-editor"", it looks promising. http://game-editor.com

Thanks again."
