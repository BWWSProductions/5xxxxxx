UPGRADE (423 MB) - BLOOD OMEN 1 - ANOTHER COMPLETE GAME FROM THIS SERIES NOW AVAILABLE IN A NICE LINK , THIS GAME IS IN A PSX VERSION BECAUSE THE PC REALLY LOOKS MORE BUGGY AND PROBLEMATIC SPECIALLY TO THE LATEST OPERATIVE SYSTEMS , THEN I DECIDED TO OPT FOR THE PSX VERSION WITH THE EPSXE 1.7.0 EMULATOR READY TO GO AND COMPARING TO THE PC VERSION , BOTH VERSIONS LOOKS IDENTICALS , SO NO DIFFERENCE IN THE GAMEPLAY , OK HERE IS THE LINK TO THIS COMPLETE GAME TO UPGRADE THE ALREADY VERY NICE COLLECTION :

[V],globeplus,2010-05-12T18:27Z,"to the psx , the psx 1.13 is a nice emulator and run generally speaking a little more percentage of the totality of the available psx games than epsxe but in this particular game blood omen 1 , happen the contrary , that means that in the psx 1.13 the game get a sound bug and in the epsxe runs perfectly , so it was the correct choice for this game , the blood omen 1 is from 1996 and it was the first game from this series and the oly game from the series with a 2D perspective in the gameplay but enjoyable in his way .

Curiosity : is amazing how after a fantastic work in a really nice collection with 5 games in total for a little more than 2 giga to download , is possible to get negative votes , it is the type of mysteries that i don´t understand ...
Well , just life anyway ... "

,lostlegends,2010-05-12T23:18Z,"Just wanted to say thanks. I have the original first kain for the pc and was realy disapointed too find i couldnt get it running recently, never even though of emulating ps version so thanks."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-13T03:02Z,"the lostlegends comment is very interesting because today with some work i get a pc version running for the blood omen 1 game and after compression very close to the size of the psx , now the comparing between the 2 versions , in the gameplay looks like anything but the video files for the pc , they work it is true but not good quality comparing to the ones in psx , the pc version use .jam files and the psx use .str video files , users that played in both versions says that playing in the psx , gives the sense that the gameplay have more speed than the pc version after applied the correction to the latest operative systems , the true is that i didn´t noted a thing when i tested both versions n now while the psx version have cheat codes that can work or not , the pc version have a complete trainer and many little programs to study or change things inside the game : maps , textures items , inclusive , this game is in 2D perspective and to the pc is a team working maps for making a 3d version , i taked a quick look and it is nice the mobility and the pre-conception of this 3d version with a only a few maps for the moment i think but of course that i noticed that some interaction in the 2D can be very more tough in a possible 3D version , ok the veridict is : the gameplay is nice in both but the jam video files in the pc version not really good beside they work fine , in the pc maybe you can use more extra stuff than for psx beside many cheat codes for psx too .
