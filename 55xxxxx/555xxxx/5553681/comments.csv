,PIRATE-555,2010-12-22T17:44Z,"Outstanding collection and work DeGun!

I found this torrent quite by ACCIDENT and it's too bad that this Torrent was not named better because the title gives me NO idea what is inside?

  ""DeGun TPB - AshampooÃ‚Â® - AiO 2010""

I checked for more work by DeGun and there is plenty and I KNOW it represents so much work... I KNOW if this fine collection had a better name there would be MANY Seeders!

My 2 pieces of eight...
