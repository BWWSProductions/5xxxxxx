I ***ALWAYS*** run my first intallations and relative patches or keygens in Sandoxie, and only after seeing them do what's expected without strange things I use them in the ""real"" world.
The Patch doesn't do anything else than patching the program, and my AV also don't complain with it, so I use it without fear.

Didn't find anything of this educational software around in internet, apart the regular site. No licenses cracks or similar things."
