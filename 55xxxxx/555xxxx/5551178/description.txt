"Baggage"

During a session with Dr. Nolan (guest star Braugher), 
House recounts the case of a woman who arrives at the 
Princeton Plainsboro emergency room with an 
unexplained illness and no recollection of who she is. 
While trying to solve the mystery of the woman's 
illness, House must also help her piece together her 
identity.

Enjoy :)
