In he future the crack may be detected if the install directory of avast is scanned. In that case just exclude the crack from being scanned and realtime protected by avast.

The fix for your problem is trying to read and to understand the install notes and other notes:

Smarty, you just need to install offline DURING installation cause otherwise avast will try to download a trial license. However, a trial license should be aquired AFTER installing avast, applying the patch, and rebooting. "

Once this is done it won't find that avast! is a Trojan.

,Cynite,2010-06-21T03:07Z,"Torrent works great but I have a very very noob question.

Should I be installing both Avast Pro AV and IS or just one? I'm thinking it is just one and that the IS is the better one but I can't find anything that will confirm my assumption.

A quick answer would be very helpful. :]"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-21T05:32Z,"@Cynite 

From the installation notes:
02. Install avast! 5.0.545 (avast AV or avast IS) in trial mode.

Other notes:
The crack is only for:
- avast! Internet Security 5.0.545 (Multilingual, 32-64 bit, Incl. firewall)
- avast! Pro Antivirus 5.0.545 (Multilingual, 32-64 bit, No firewall incl.)


So the differance is clear, what to do is clear, and the choice is yours. There's nothing more that can be added, as you may agree."

[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-28T22:06Z,"@rjjgenius 

What you're saying is correct, but you need to download at least one trial license to activate avast, cause after installation and reboor there's no license file for avast yet. So the license can only be saved after it's downloaded and avast is activated. Then the crack and license file can be used for reinstalling and activating avast offline."
,donx009,2010-06-30T01:39Z,"i accidently updated da program of avast, i dont knw wht to do now?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-01T03:57Z,"@donx009

Tr to use your brain for thinking about a solution. If your brains work you may think of unstalling avast if the program version was updated. The you may get the idea to reinstall this version, using this crack only for this version, and update only the virus signatures.

Maybe now you can save yourself some thinking."

I made some mistake in my comment,sorry for dz. To make offline activation of avast! 5.545(Crack Till 2024)RH, 1st you must already have install avast! 5.545 crack Till 2024. I just figure out that no need to put license.lic next to **.dll, the crack I mean. To activated offline use the license.lic created in your Online Activated of your ""avast! crack 2024"" coz this the only 1 that you will use to Offline Activated. I Swear to God this is 100% Works."

If AVG removes the cracked ashBase.dll then just add it to the exclusions list of AVG (realtime protection, shields, auto-scan).

If you're using the original (restored) ashBase.dll then avast will be running in trial mode, counting down the trial days left.
