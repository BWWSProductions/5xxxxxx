Alex also welcomes back to the show Michael Badnarik [hour 4], the Libertarian Party nominee for president in the 2004 elections. Two years later he ran as a Libertarian Party candidate in congressional elections for Texas' 10th congressional district seat near Austin. Mr. Badnarik's radio show, Lighting the Fires of Liberty, can be heard on GCN.

[I cannot find anything on GCN's site about a Michael Badnarik show or a show called "Lighting the Fires of Liberty"]

[Ted Anderson -- owner of GCN radio network -- is in-studio for several minutes at the end of hour 1 and beginning of hour 2, doing a "live commercial" for his gold business, Midas Resources]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
