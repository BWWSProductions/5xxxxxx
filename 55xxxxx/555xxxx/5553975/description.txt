IMDB:  Set in the country, 'Boogeyman' tells the haunting tale of a young man traumatized by memories of terrible events he experienced in his childhood bedroom and who, years later, reluctantly returns home to face his fears of a monstrous entity that could be real or merely a figment of his imagination.  Written by "bondish" 
 
This rip is intended to be a small file, not aXXo quality.  I do this so it will download quicker, save your HDD space, and transfer to your portable movie player quicker.  Therefore, the video is muddy when you blow it up big on your screen, and it gets a bit grainy during quick parts.  The sound quality was not compromised, and it doesn't have any static or pops. I don't need to hear "your rip sucks" or anything of the likeness because I don't care and am doing this for free. If you really want a high quality rip, you can ask me to make one.

Also, If you want to add this torrent to your account on another site, great.
