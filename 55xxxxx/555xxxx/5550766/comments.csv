,lean1489,2010-05-11T21:54Z,not sure wut i am doin wrong but the patch dont do ne thing for me and yes have my anti virus turned off too so ne help would be great thanks 
,michaelingeorgia,2010-05-12T01:03Z,"The patch will work as long as you have run Setup.exe first. What happens when you run the patch? It should say patching now and then a command window will open, then ableton should open and authorize."
,lean1489,2010-05-12T13:44Z,yea thats same thing when i do it it wont work or say any thing just goes away 
,michaelingeorgia,2010-05-12T16:59Z,If you are running 64 bit Windows. Try to install Ableton to the Program Files folder (not x86). Then run the patch.
,romastini,2010-05-13T16:40Z,will this work on a macbook??
,michaelingeorgia,2010-05-13T18:55Z,This will only work on mac if you are running a virtual windows application.

,ksirob,2010-05-26T01:00Z,"unpack AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe (i used winrar)

Windows XP Home SP3"
,x9x9x9x9x9,2010-06-07T12:05Z,"It DOES work with Windows 7 64 bit. I'm not quite sure if you have to put it in the NON-x86 bit folder or not but mine is and it works. Here is what I did:

1. open the folder (lawlz)

2. right click on the patch and extract. This is where everyone is getting confused. it looks like a straight up patch but its not. it is a zipped file.

3. run the LivePatch patch file (I never saw the command window just like everyone else)

4. rename the large Live.exe file to Live 8.1.1 and put it in the place of the other Live 8.1.1 file that is in 
C:\program files\ableton\live 8.1.1\program 

5. Once you have extracted, ran the patch, renamed, and replaced the files. run the Authorizelive8.auz file. This should open live and authorize the program. This may take a few minuets so be patient It is also going to want to install some other crap after it has authorized just click yes. this will take a while so dont fuck with the program or it could freeze up. 

That should be it if anyone has problems with it I will try to remember to get back on here and check every few days to see if there are any questions. You may have to put it in C:\Program Files or you may not I don't know. You may also have to right click and change the compatibility by right clicking and going to the compatibility tab, clicking on the ""Run this program in compatibility mode box and selecting windows xp. Just give it a shot if it doesn't work well shit that sucks. I got it working for me and I suck with this type stuff. But go ahead and ask if you are confused.

Thanks to ksirob for the help. This is really just a more detailed explanation on how to do it. Also Thanks to michaelingeorgia for putting this up."

,showwmann,2010-06-15T09:43Z,"Guys ksirob's way is working! (xp 32bit)
Thank u ksirob!!
I wanna explain the same way step by step:

+First download the torrent and install it to ur computer using setup exe like every program.

+Then unpack the Patch.exe. Use winrar! Some other free zip applications wont work here. Just right click the patch file and select 'extract here'.

+There u got 3 more files: Authorizelive8.auz , Live.exe and LivePatch.exe

+Rename Live.exe to Live 8.1.1.exe and copy it over the original file (for default download path it is on C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.1.1\Program). I mean overwrite the original Live 8.1.1.exe with the renamed one.

+Then right click the Authorizelive8.auz file and select Live 8.1.1. In other words open with Ableton.

+Wait for 1 min. The programme ll automaticly autorizes. It asks: ""do you want to check update before autorize?"" Select NO!.

P.S: Do not click or double click the patch file any time. It says self extractor but NO. only use winrar to extract it! otherwise you see a small ableton window and nothing happens. Let me say it last time; unzip the AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe with winrar!

Enjoy.."
,mrmoo222,2010-06-21T00:22Z,Hey. when i open ableton live it says I hav to authorise online. before i can save any music work. 
,showwmann,2010-06-23T13:32Z,"Guys I've news for you,

If you are using Ableton while online, Ableton detects your copy and sends a bug especially to the Export Adio/Video command. You can't save your work properly, most of the time it saves half of your work.

Good news is that, this is not a permanent bug. BEFORE U SAVE YOUR WORK DELETE ALL COOKIES/BROWSER CASH, RESET YOUR MODEM, RESTART YOUR LAPTOP. AND THIS TIME YOU HAS TO BE OFFLINE. THEY DETECT & SEND A BUG EVERYTIME YOU'RE ONLINE."
,dimitrios,2010-06-24T06:56Z,"The patch does not work with Windows7 Starter.

When I click ""Authorize later"" it opens the program but can't save nor export. Sucks. Also when starting the program, there occurs an error loading Rewire. Any solution out there?"
,emelawford,2010-06-26T21:37Z,"it works!

*run the setup.exe
*then
*open WINRAR
*then
*find the file live patch
*unzip it to the same location its found in

*rename the file called 'live.exe'

*'live 8.1.1.exe'

1) The file AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe is actually an archive file. Open it with your compression software (7zip/WinRAR/WinZIP) and extract the files.
2) Move the 3 files (Authorizelive8.auz/Live.exe/LivePatch.exe) to your install directory. Normally: C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.1.1\Program.
3) Rename Live 8.1.1.exe to Live 8.1.1old.exe and rename Live.exe to Live 8.1.1.exe
4) Run Authorizelive8.auz and wait

,SaltSlasher,2010-11-19T03:20Z,"@givemefreeshit

Your instructions worked very well! This is one hell of an easy setup. 
If you try and just click abletons sutie patch, with norton it says its a trojan and won't open.
So if you use winrar and extract it, it splits it into 3 files, rename the live.exe with live 8.1.1.exe, and open ableton in the c drive, and copy the file you renamed to it, and delete the original. 
Then use the the Authorizer, and pick ableton, and wa lah!

very very easy even the noobiest of noobs shouldn't have a hard time on this one.
At first I kept trying to click on the patch and kept getting the trojan thing. So after I read the more detailed instructions it was easy cake. Just make sure you delete the original program that the renamed file replaces or it won't work.

,Angookie,2010-12-21T21:07Z,"Ok, so since I'm god of installing illegal softwarez,
heres how to ACTUALLY activate this program:


1.) Install Ableton Live 8.1.1, by running:
................. "" Setup.exe ""
in the downloaded folder, BUT DON'T RUN IT!!!


2.) Then, Un-Archive the file:
................. "" AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe ""

============================================================

2.1) For those who do NOT know how to un-zip things, get:
................. "" http://www.7zip.com ""

2.2) Use the 1st download link, because even if your 64 bit,
....... it'll still work with a 32 bit install, don't trip

2.3) Right click the "" Patch "" file & hover over:
................. "" 7-Zip -> ""; then click: "" Extract Here ""

You have now learned how to Un-Archive things & can continue
Leave every thing how it is, keep this folder open

============================================================

3.) Right-Click Live 8.1.1's Shortcut in the Start Menu
....... then click on: "" Properties ""

4.) Click on either: ""Open Target"", or ""Open File Location""
It's different for Windows XP and lower & Windows Vista & 7

5.) Go to the Ableton downloaded folder & copy over:
"" Live.exe "" & "" Authorizelive8.auz ""

6.) Rename: "" Live.exe "" to:
.................. "" Live 8.1.1.exe""

7.) Then double click on:
.................. "" Authorizelive8.auz ""

:D"
,Angookie,2010-12-21T21:25Z,"Your also gonna want to:

1.) Click: Options in the Upper Left

2.) Click: Preferences

3.) Click: Library

4.) Click: Repair Library

This will scan the defualt packages for Live in the Program Folder of Ableton

Which will then give you all the sounds and plugins and other stuff that you were like:

Ok, so since I'm god of installing illegal softwarez,
heres how to ACTUALLY activate this program:


1.) Install Ableton Live 8.1.1, by running:
................. "" Setup.exe ""
in the downloaded folder, BUT DON'T RUN IT!!!


2.) Then, Un-Archive the file:
................. "" AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe ""

============================================================

2.1) For those who do NOT know how to un-zip things, get:
................. "" http://www.7zip.com ""

2.2) Use the 1st download link, because even if your 64 bit,
....... it'll still work with a 32 bit install, don't trip

2.3) Right click the "" Patch "" file & hover over:
................. "" 7-Zip -> ""; then click: "" Extract Here ""

You have now learned how to Un-Archive things & can continue
Leave every thing how it is, keep this folder open

============================================================

3.) Right-Click Live 8.1.1's Shortcut in the Start Menu
....... then click on: "" Properties ""

4.) Click on either: ""Open Target"", or ""Open File Location""
It's different for Windows XP and lower & Windows Vista & 7

5.) Go to the Ableton downloaded folder & copy over:
"" Live.exe "" & "" Authorizelive8.auz ""

6.) Rename: "" Live.exe "" to:
.................. "" Live 8.1.1.exe""

7.) Then double click on:
.................. "" Authorizelive8.auz ""

:D 

""

Thank you Angookie, works great!!!

only thing i'd like to add to your instructions is I had to associate the .auz file to ableton live.

for the techinically inclined, 

when you click open on this file and it cannot find the correct program to use to open it, click browse and find yourself back to the Live 8.1.1.exe and use that to auth the program.

Recommend that you repair your library before you start playing around in the program."
,Gunnerhero,2011-02-02T08:59Z,"jut to tell everyone, if you run the patch and get an error about a mouse.fx (well Something like that) ITS IS A TROJAN VIRUS! "

Some of you need to stop acting like computer techs because you couldn't walk someone down the street let alone gettin thru this crap. Bottom line is Ableton caught on people! You will no longer be able to authorize your torrent. So until someone else can crack 8.1.1, just leave it alone ."
,LeliStarr,2011-03-13T17:33Z,"Angookie's instructions are correct, and they have worked for me.

When the torrent is complete, open up an extraction program like winrar, or 7zip. Locate the downloaded folder AFTER you've installed Ableton with the setup.exe

Once found within your extraction program, right click AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe and select extract. You can choose where the extracted files will go to, but the default will most likely be within the same folder.

Once extracted, a new folder will be where you selected the extracted files to be place. Inside that folder, three files will be inside:
Live.exe, LivePatch.exe, and AuthorizeLive8.auz

Go to your Ableton folder which was created from the install (It will be in your Program Files, or Program Files x86, in your C-Drive), remove the Live 8.1.1.exe from the Program folder inside the Ableton folder, and replace it with the Live.exe from the new extracted folder. Rename it Live 8.1.1 when it is inside the Program folder.

Lastly, double click AuthorizeLive8.auz

Ableton will start up, self-authorize, and you'll be good to go."

,TheIrishPirate,2011-03-17T04:05Z,"Oh but one fix.
You had a typo; rename Live.exe to Live 8.1.1.exe

1.  Downloaded torrent and unpacked within the download file.

2.  Installed setup.exe but DID NOT Run the Program.

3.  QUESTION WITH THIS STEP:  You say to copy over (from the download folder) ""live.exe & authorizelive8.auz.

What exactly do you mean by ""copy over??""

4.  next step would be to then rename Live.exe (from within the install program folder) to Live 8.1.1.exe.

5.  Last step - run authorizelive8.auz which is one of the three unpacked files (live.exe, livepatch.exe, and authorizelive8.auz.

I'm not a complete moron on systems, etc, and have searched the system for those files, to no avail.  I'm running Windows 7 Home Pro, and again use Tixati to download torrents.  Could it be how I'm downloading, as they're not coming across as zip or rar files to begin with?

,Rundaus,2011-04-19T05:41Z,"I have not been able to find anyone who has said as much prior, but if any new takers to this program are running into problems, here is a little tidbit of information, you have to extract the authorizelive8.exe twice. The first time gives you access to the live patch and live executeables, but the authorizedlive8.exe needs to be extracted again to get to the base .auz file that will allow for the option to run the file with ableton, instead of it attempting to unpack itself and just give you the splash screen. 

so after that, just copy what everyone says to do, first unpack the first file, run the setup.exe, rename live to live 8.1.1 and put it in the ableton program file, run livepatch.exe, then unpack authorizelive8.exe to get the .auz file and chose to open that file with ableton...

hope I helped..."

,VixtoSirchy,2011-04-23T11:01Z,"Okay for anyone still confused I have made clear instructions.
There is one thing you NEED TO KNOW before going into this though...
The files named ""AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch"" & ""LivePatch.exe"" are files that need to be extracted with WinRAR or WinZIP or any program like that. So make sure you have a program like this. I use WinRAR.

1. Run Setup.exe
2. Open WinRAR and extract ""AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch"" - this will reveal a new folder containing ""Live"" and ""LivePatch"" 
Open WinRAR again and extract ""LivePatch"" - this should reveal the file ""Authorizelive8.auz""
3. Rename ""Live"" to ""Live 8.1.1""  
4. Copy ""Live 8.1.1""  to ""Program files (x86)/Ableton/Live 8.1.1/Program"" replacing the file of the same name (mine was in ""Program Files x86"" - yours might just be ""Program Files"")
5. Right Click ""Live 8.1.1"" > Send to > Desktop   - to create a desktop shortcut
5. Back in the extracted folder, run ""Authorizelive8.auz"" - this will open Ableton and then authorize for full use. 
6. Now you can run Ableton from the desktop shortcut, and have full use. 
Enjoy
I'm astounded that the Readme file covers none of that. "

,sufibridge,2011-07-22T13:40Z,"Hi, tried your crack twice .. and one from THE LEAK (8.2.2) using Trial version for now find it the best out there so really want it. Leak's method same as yours. Thought I did it right. Get ""This authorisation not valid on this computer."" message. Now it just goes straight to trial version. Do I have to uninstall everything again to make it work ?
Inside Ableton 8.2.2 (yellow folder) there is a black folder Live 8.2.2 and beside that is a folder that says Program and inside it there is another black folder Live 8.2.2 .. 
When you say write over do you mean drag and drop ? If so, over which of the two inside the main folder ?
 I understand the method but must be doing something wrong .. takes about 2hrs to download each time but I'm determined to do it  .. 
Any help much appreciated. 
Do you think once I've opened a program with Ableton the crack wont work , or will uninstalling everything & starting again be the answer ?
I've managed to get Fruity Loops and Mixcraft O.K. but they are crap compared to this so really want to get it. Please be patient. Thanks for you good work .. obviously other people have done it O.K. :)"
,sufibridge,2011-07-22T17:52Z,Hi again. O.K. got it now. Actually used Leak's one but it's same method. For anyone interested the two progs (trial and cracked versions) run completely seperately. I copied and pasted the crack over both the folders inside the program & it worked for me. Thanks anyway .. it's a great prog. Happy music making. :)
,aspiratr7,2011-08-30T18:55Z,Thanks! and if it doesnt work follow what x9x9x9x9x9 says in the firsts comments page. thats what i did
,Randomman1697,2011-09-09T02:55Z,"Just to make it 2 seconds easier for everyone else

x9x9x9x9x9 had previously stated:

It DOES work with Windows 7 64 bit. I'm not quite sure if you have to put it in the NON-x86 bit folder or not but mine is and it works. Here is what I did:

1. open the folder (lawlz)

2. right click on the patch and extract. This is where everyone is getting confused. it looks like a straight up patch but its not. it is a zipped file.

3. run the LivePatch patch file (I never saw the command window just like everyone else)

4. rename the large Live.exe file to Live 8.1.1 and put it in the place of the other Live 8.1.1 file that is in
C:\program files\ableton\live 8.1.1\program

5. Once you have extracted, ran the patch, renamed, and replaced the files. run the Authorizelive8.auz file. This should open live and authorize the program. This may take a few minuets so be patient It is also going to want to install some other crap after it has authorized just click yes. this will take a while so dont fuck with the program or it could freeze up.

That should be it if anyone has problems with it I will try to remember to get back on here and check every few days to see if there are any questions. You may have to put it in C:\Program Files or you may not I don't know. You may also have to right click and change the compatibility by right clicking and going to the compatibility tab, clicking on the ""Run this program in compatibility mode box and selecting windows xp. Just give it a shot if it doesn't work well shit that sucks. I got it working for me and I suck with this type stuff. But go ahead and ask if you are confused.

Thanks to ksirob for the help. This is really just a more detailed explanation on how to do it. Also Thanks to michaelingeorgia for putting this up. "

,Ssera,2011-10-24T16:17Z,"Hi everybody. Thx for the upload!
One problem though, I recently dl'ed this torrent for a friend who isn't good with computers, but after installing and trying to open the authorization patch, etc. which was a hassle, all his shortcuts on his windows 7 computer (desktop shortcuts, recently used and so forth) were replaced by some sort of ableton shortcut, so it is near impossible to open firefox and other programs.

Have this happened to anyone else? How do i fix this?
Thx"

Thanks"
,marlamartian,2011-11-27T02:38Z,"Thank you so so so so SO so much LeliStarr!!! i tried all 5 pages of advice before coming to your post... probably put in a good 2 or 3 hours before getting it to work lol. The remedy that FINALLY got the program to authorize, was not renaming the file till the original live 8.1.1 was removed and the new live file was replaced, THEN rename it. 

this is her original post for others who are also having trouble getting the program to authorize:

LeliStarr at 2011-03-13 17:33 CET:
Angookie's instructions are correct, and they have worked for me.

When the torrent is complete, open up an extraction program like winrar, or 7zip. Locate the downloaded folder AFTER you've installed Ableton with the setup.exe

Once found within your extraction program, right click AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe and select extract. You can choose where the extracted files will go to, but the default will most likely be within the same folder.

Once extracted, a new folder will be where you selected the extracted files to be place. Inside that folder, three files will be inside:
Live.exe, LivePatch.exe, and AuthorizeLive8.auz

Go to your Ableton folder which was created from the install (It will be in your Program Files, or Program Files x86, in your C-Drive), remove the Live 8.1.1.exe from the Program folder inside the Ableton folder, and replace it with the Live.exe from the new extracted folder. Rename it Live 8.1.1 when it is inside the Program folder.

Lastly, double click AuthorizeLive8.auz

Ableton will start up, self-authorize, and you'll be good to go.


thank you again, and also a BIG thanks to michaelingeorgia for the upload!!!"
,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2011-12-04T18:43Z,thanks for the help bros. works fine Win 9 64bit
,1skgrk,2011-12-11T12:26Z,"Hey Guys the instructions worked great, I installed it on a previous occasion but this time round I'm installing it once again on Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.
Once i get to the stage of replacing the live 8.1.1 and re naming. The program will not launch n just keeps crashing. So when i try run the Authorizelive8.auz file the program keeps crashing. Anybody got any ideas what might be conflicting with the program? 
This problem only occurs when i replace the live 8.1.1 file :S
Thanks guys"
,arsoned,2011-12-18T23:24Z,"PROPER/DESCRIPTIVE INSTRUCTIONS! (Cause the ones above are bullshit)
----------------------

1. Extract files from AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.
2. Run Setup
3. In Extracted folder, run LivePatch.
4. Rename larger ""Live"" file as ""Live 8.1.1"" (you may need to copy it into random folder so that it doesnt turn into ""Live 8.1.1(2)""
5. Copy and replace renamed ""Live 8.1.1"" into program files directory under ableton/live8.1.1/programs.
6. After you've run Setup, LivePatch, renamed, copied, and replaced Live8.1.1, run Authorizelive8.auz. (If windows cannot find appropriate program to run it, open it with the file Live 8.1.1 that is in the patch folder)
7. Several minutes to Authorize, then like 45+ minutes to install all sounds.
8. Enjoy!"
,ComposerCK,2011-12-26T16:36Z,Why can't anyone make a straightforward version of Ableton Live that can be installed without doing all this crap ?

,fukthesyst3m,2012-05-27T00:29Z,"The patch does contain a virus, but the virus is in the executable- not within the patch files themselves. If you follow ksirob's method of patch installation (1st page of comments) and extract the files with winRAR, and then copy into place manually you will avoid installing the virus."
