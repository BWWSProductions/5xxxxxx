,occollegeboi420,2010-07-23T16:10Z,Video quality is HORRIBLE!! Only about 500 bit rate!! Anything under 1000 video bit rate is shit. Please upload another one.
,Magickrider,2010-07-29T23:45Z,hopefully it works.......
,dlectro,2010-08-30T13:35Z,"@occollegeboi420: This is for handhelds (PSP, iPod, Zune, etc), thus ~500kbps is ideal (the quality of the source wasn't splendid either). Please spare us of your wisdom!"
,hootieman,2010-09-24T01:25Z,"missing episodes, this is not complete, you fail, in season 6 there's 22 episodes, and no season 7"
,dlectro,2010-11-10T13:44Z,"@hootieman: You're wrong. It's complete, no missing episodes.

Official site: 10+9 episodes.
Wikipedia: 19 episodes.
IMdb: 19 episodes.
TV.com: 10+9 episodes.
EZTV: 10+9 episodes.

Officially it's Season 6 (10 episodes) + ""Final Nine"".
Thus some call it Season 6 & Season 7.

So YOU fail."
