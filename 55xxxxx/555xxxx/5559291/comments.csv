,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-07-05T23:24Z,this works on soft mod wii's with back ups it works for me but i use a PAL wii and the dlc and bzck up game i use is NTSC so if you are using a PAL wii like me you will have to change your wii shop channel to the american one to be able to download the content
,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-07-05T23:27Z,use a little thing like any region changer but remeber to remove all the setting for the Pal shop 1st then change it to the american one. with any region changer you can just change the shop channel you do not have to change anything else.
