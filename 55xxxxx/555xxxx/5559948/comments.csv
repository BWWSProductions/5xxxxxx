,CorE FreaK,2010-05-14T02:34Z,"No problems what so ever. Use media player classic, the ordinary wmp is useless."
,inteck,2010-05-14T05:54Z,its the same when i try and stream to my xbox is there anything i can do about that

There has been some kind of problem with the encoding, you're right.
Don't know about this ep, still downloading it.

I could play only one episode (03  from season 04) on my hdmi mediadisk. It was the first time it ever happened, since it plays EVERYTHING I have in it... and I watch about 6 tv shows a day.

All Sea Patrol eps play well on my netbook using VLC, but when I put them on the mediadisk, the image freezes after about 2 minutes or so, and the  sound goes on playing.

Anyway, thanks for the upload and keep on with the good work, TvTeam!"
,matttyger,2010-05-14T10:07Z,"Thnx TvTeam! (why the late upload, if I may ask?)

no problems watching it on VLC Media Player. Just google it. It works great! Trust me! Even on my netbook (Samsung N110)
Good luck!"
,doink069,2010-05-14T22:13Z,"Problems with playback usually has nothing to do with the player. It's usually a problem with codecs.  Google K-lite codec pack, download & install the Mega pack and never have problems with ANY video again."
,pooloop,2010-05-15T01:02Z,"i cannot believe you sad people sit there watching this on silly little programmes on a pc or laptop why not just convert it with nero or something else that you might be able to understand, too a dvd and watch it on a plasma, that's what i do and a pass this programme on to more than 12 people that are big fans of this show as we don't get this where i live for a long time, SO THE WORDS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH TV TEAM, KEEP UP YOUR GREAT UPLOADS BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU WE WOULD HAVE NOTHING.........once again tv team thank you...."
,CorE FreaK,2010-05-15T01:21Z,Why on earth did you quit uploading the 720p versions of this series?
,skooterzz,2010-05-15T08:31Z,"
Well, this ep played flawlessly on the media disk.

@pooloop

Why do you need to convert to dvd to watch it on your plasma?

Just do as I did a couple of years ago: 
-buy a cheap dvd with divx player (no need to burn stuff to dvd anymore, just plug in your usb flash drive);

or

-buy a HDMI media player external disk (mine is a 1TB from MemUp and even plays 720p).

With all these gadgets, shows and movies go straight from the pc to my plasma tv.

Again, thanks TvTeam! :)"
,DEAalsmeer,2010-05-20T21:55Z,tnx!! please upload the next episode! I can hardly wait!
,OldBosun,2010-05-22T06:08Z,"Glad to get the show, but agree with most that these episodes are often poorly encoded for use on a DIVX player even tho they play perfectly on VLC player."
,iangrier,2010-05-23T05:50Z,"I appreciate what you do, I hope the ones with complaints realise what they may have done, no-one has uploaded EP06 which I am hanging out for, grizzlers RACK OFF."
,grumpy88,2010-05-23T09:53Z,"If you know this donload isn't good than just don't download and back off! 
I realy enjoy this program and would like to have the next episode! 
So TvTeam thank you for the great work and hopefully you will upload the next episode some day... "
,babtabjnr,2010-05-23T15:49Z,TvTeam nice upload thanks again!! Any chance of Ep 6?? Haven't seem to found a torrent yet!!
,matttyger,2010-05-23T18:07Z,"TVTeam, could u plz up ep 6? It was due 3 days ago =(
It's encoded good enough for VLC, 0 trouble at all!

thnx for your trouble, TVTeam!"
,Eythna,2010-05-23T19:20Z,"Thanks TvTeam, much appreciated! Please be so kind as to upload episode 6! "
,GregiBoy,2010-05-23T23:19Z,"Hey guys,

When are you gonna put episode 6 up?"
,CrystalWitch,2010-08-01T20:21Z,"Wunderbar! Danke schon! Reading the thread, there seems to be no pleasing some people. VLC is great for these downloads and there are many ways to put it on a big screen - horses for courses mes amis. Haven't got this series in the UK yet, so loving this! :D"
