"Polly Wants a Crack at Her"

An ominous fearsome hawk soars over Haplins unsuspecting
residents as the Thaw Fest celebration is about to start. 
Tommy must walk a precarious line when it comes to 
Friddle's murder, as a state investigator moves in to 
assist him. Andrew Haplin, still upset over girlfriend 
Georgia's assault, exacts revenge on who he believes to 
be the perpetrator -- pays for the consequences. 
Meanwhile Henley is a victim of a bizarre car accident, 
but a handsome stranger not only comes to her rescue, but 
lures her into a surprising, sensual relationship. And 
when Thaw Fest finally arrives, it comes with chilling 
and tragic consequences.

Enjoy :)
