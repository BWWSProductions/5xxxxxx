Season 2 now appears stuck since over 16 people are at 93.5% for several days. 

Great files."
,adrianfango,2010-06-05T23:22Z,Actually everyone is at 89.3% for season 2. Season 5 is stuck at 93.5% and season 4 is just slow (but can complete in 2 weeks). But it's all good.
,adrianfango,2010-06-07T14:29Z,"Well, about 12 of us are now STUCK at 89.4% and there hasn't been a complete seeder since I started. (Only four episodes are complete so far.)

jgordon, please seed for a little while and then others should keep it going.

It was a great set (updated seasons 1-5) and several seasons do upload completely, but seasons 2, 4 and 5 are problematic. "
