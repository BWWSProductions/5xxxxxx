Sorry about the disruption in my seeding. Computer problems forced me to move the
originals. 

Pirate Bay is not like it used to be. Before, we had the privilege of editing or deleting our own uploads. That is sometimes necessary. 


It also used to be that I would not be allowed to upload a torrent that is similar to one already done. I hope they do not block this effort.
