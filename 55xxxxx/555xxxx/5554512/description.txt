One of the central figures of the transitional period between ska and rocksteady, Leonard Dillon is currently recognized as one of early reggae's most important artists. His band, the Ethiopians, made records that remain essential documents of the period ("Train to Skaville," which is included here, chief among them) and his solo work has been every bit as good.
