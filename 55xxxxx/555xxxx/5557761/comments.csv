,waldyrious,2012-05-09T09:25Z,"I tried this, and I wouldn't recommend it for beginners (maybe it would be useful for someone wanting a quick review of things they already know).

The issues I found with this are:
- some long phrases are hard to grasp, and they aren't repeated. Furthermore, they're spoken at native (or near-native) speed.
- There's no written material (the audio refers a leaflet but it isn't included in the torrent)
- All the lessons are glued together in a single file, which makes it hard to replay a specific lesson
- The level of Japanese assumed for the listener is uneven, or at least grows at a way too fast for someone actually learning Japanese. Again, maybe it'd be useful for someone who already knows some stuff and wants to consolidate/review them."
