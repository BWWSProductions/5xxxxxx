,unstoppability0360,2010-05-16T15:25Z,"let me explain how torrents work. you see, when you download from seeders, it is hoped that youll seed the file yourself. i've uploaded this file 20+ times and how many seeders are there? one, me. i'm done seeding in a week. if you cant find seeds, tough. share it or dont download it in the first place devils. youre not the kind of users we appreciate here at the Pirate bay"
