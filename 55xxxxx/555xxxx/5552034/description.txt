If you'd like to download District 13 (Banlieue 13) from circlensess, this is the English subtitle for it. I got the subtitle from allsubs dot org and this version is the correct one (with the correct timing).

Some complained that no subtitle (.srt) file was included with the District_13_(Banlieue_13)_DVDRIP_XviD.4162252.TPB.torrent download (even though circlensess already indicated that in the Description of the torrent file).

I thought I'd make life easier for those who're looking for the English .srt file by uploading it here. So enjoy!
