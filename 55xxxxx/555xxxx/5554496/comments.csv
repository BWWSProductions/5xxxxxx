,Ghalen,2010-05-16T09:18Z,"Unfortunately the original source has been deleted. These were from my own library and I don't encode in avi for personal use. If I had known I was going to be posting this series I would have done the avi as well. All future episodes will be double encode formats as I did with ep6.

To convert these to avi format with xvid/mp3 would suffer some loss. However if you still desire I will attempt it as cleanly as possible, if requested.
Let me know."
