Anthony Way was born in London on 14 December 1982. His father worked as a prison officer at Wormwood Scrubs Prison, and it was the prison chaplain (the Rev. Ray Guymer), who, in 1990,suggested to Mr Way that Anthony should go for a voice trial at St Paul's Cathedral.
After his success in the BBC series The Choir in 1995 and numerous TV appearances, it became apparent that not only did audiences love him,but that the feeling was reciprocal. Indeed, as his confident performance in front of thousands,including Her Majesty The Queen at the VE Day Celebrations in Hyde Park, show, he was a natural star with a treble voice of a quality that makes one return year after year to listen to his recordings.

This torrent contains two albums, The Choirboy 1995 and Wings of a dove 1997.
You will also find two clips from TV performances

Enjoy!
