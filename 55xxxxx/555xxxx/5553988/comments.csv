,jandejoop,2010-05-18T13:25Z,well thanks for the upload mate!
,solarwing,2010-05-29T18:10Z,Thx man!
,SoFaKiNg42,2010-05-31T04:30Z,Missing files..dont download
,Longhat,2010-06-09T09:33Z,"There is no missing files this is a crack for version 1.15, you must update it yourself via the torchlight website."
,G_in,2010-06-28T04:19Z,"This crack does not work, replacing it for the original .exe, then using it only leads you to the steam page where it prompts you to download the demo."
,-Bullet,2010-07-01T17:46Z,"1. download this torrent
2. download update from torchlight official website
3. apply crack and play game

works perfectly. I can launch the game. but I have not played the game so there might be glitches in the actual gameplay."
,G_in,2010-07-02T10:34Z,"-Bullet, can you tell me how?

I copy the cracked .exe and paste it in my game directory, but it doesn't work.
When I use the cracked .exe, it pops a steam page up and prompts me to DL a demo.

Also, I downloaded the cracked torchlight from skidrow on piratebay also."
,Satan_PL,2010-07-05T17:30Z,"G_in you didnt patch the game first, did you? Heh... For any cracks you can actually go to GameCopyWorld."
,zhool,2010-07-12T13:04Z,"@Grnrnyou have to replace both steam_api.dll and torchlight.exe with the files from the torrent archivernrna good habit is to back up the original files by renaming them, ie steam_api.dll.bak or steam_apiBAK.dllrnrnthe other two files (skidrow.exe and the .nfo) are not required and can stay in the archive"
,heyhello,2010-07-17T10:41Z,"For the downloading of the actual patch via the official site, which category is it?rnOfficial, Partners, or Physical?"
,BlackTitan666,2010-08-21T08:34Z,thanks it works great
,AFinalDate,2010-08-23T14:06Z,"This works perfectly. Those who are saying this doesn't work are wrong. 

1. Download Torchlight
2. Download patch from official website
3. Install patch
4. Copy crack from archive into the directory you installed Torchlight into

How this is difficult is beyond me. Anyways, thanks Longhat for the upload."
,Phobya,2010-09-05T00:34Z,"Torchlight_v.1.15_Runic.exe 411mb , Google and download

Then apply crack :)"
,Cserb,2010-09-14T06:15Z,"which patch is needed for this crack? official torchlight DL, partner site, or retail box?"
,Cserb,2010-09-14T06:41Z,"Ok, confirmed working this way:

(I'm using the 1.0 from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5137965/%5BPC%5D_Torchlight_-_2009_-_%5BESPACONSOLAS%5D )

1. install the above;
2. go to torchlightgame.com/download to get the patch and click on ""I purchased from torchlightgame.com"";
3. install the patch. It will prompt for install path, just like the game. Give it the Torchlight folder, where your game is;
4. copy ALL the files from this torrent into the root of your torchlight folder;
5. play v1.15 :)"
,Cserb,2010-09-14T06:42Z,"Confirmed working with the ""i purchased from torchlightgame-com"" patch"
,Xector,2010-09-15T22:22Z,"I also am using 1.0 version, 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5137965/%5BPC%5D_Torchlight_-_2009_-_%5BESPACONSOLAS%5D

I downloaded and installed 1.15 patch from website, from ""I downloaded the game from torchlightgame.com""

Then I copied all contents of torrent into Torchlight install directory. I can get to the character title screen, but everytime I try to play a character, Torchlight crashes. 

Anyone have this problem, or know how to possible fix it? thanks. "
,jauser,2010-10-26T22:18Z,"loving it SKIDROW rocks,
yeah the instruction isn't so clear at the update part: U HAVE TO DL THE UPDATE ONLINE FIRST

thanks!"
,dietaube,2011-06-30T08:52Z,"I already had the free trial installed so I just downloaded the patch for people who'd purchased off the website and ran it. Then after it installed I put the cracked game .exe and the steam file in the game folder. Works perfectly.

@ SoFaKiNg42 - both files you need are there."
,dietaube,2011-06-30T08:54Z,"@ Xector - The old version you have might not be the website one. Uninstall, install the demo, then run the patch and swap the cracked file."
,axel775,2012-01-22T07:41Z,Works great. 1/22/2012.
