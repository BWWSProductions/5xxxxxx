[V],twentyforty,2010-05-11T21:02Z,"No my friend, it is not, Castle is my favored show (as many ""regulars"" already know last couple of years) and - never has entered my weekly schedule (as many others I watch).
As people in bars usually say ""It's on me"" so the Castle is - on me (LOL, as other thing wasn't...).
Besides, I have complaints that some people, who wants to enjoy HighRes 720p have playback problems 'cause 1280x720 is heavy for CPU, I have today released both 720p with different entropy model, what in turn lowers decoding needs for about 18%. That's why."
