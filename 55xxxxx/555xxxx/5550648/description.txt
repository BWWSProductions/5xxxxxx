From Wiki:


Court Yard Hounds is an American country music duo founded by sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Robison. They, along with Natalie Maines, make up the Dixie Chicks, which went on hiatus in 2008. Maguire and Robison decided to record a new Dixie Chicks album in 2009, but when Maines stated that she was not ready, the sisters decided to record a side project under a different name. Court Yard Hounds released its debut album for Columbia Records, the same label for which the Dixie Chicks has recorded, in May 2010.

Emily and Martie Erwin, now Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, founded the Dixie Chicks in 1989 with Robin Lynn Macy (lead vocals) and Laura Lynch. They released two independent albums before Macy left, and their third album was released with Lynch on lead vocals. In 1995, Lynch left and was replaced by Natalie Maines. The group was then signed to Monument Records and released two hit albums, before departing in 2000 and founding their own label, Open Wide Records, in association with Columbia Records They then released another album, and during a London concert ten days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines said, "we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas" (the Dixie Chicks' home state). The statement offended people who thought it rude and unpatriotic, and the ensuing controversy cost the group half of their concert audience attendance in the United States and led to accusations of the three women being "un-American", as well as hate mail, a death threat, and the public destruction of their albums in protest.[1] A live album was released in 2003, and a double platinum Grammy Award-winning studio album Taking the Long Way followed in 2006 before they went on hiatus in 2008.

Court Yard Hounds was formed in 2009 when Maguire and Robison wanted to return to the studio, to begin the Dixie Chicks' eighth album; Natalie Maines stated she was uninspired and unwilling to return to music yet. Without ending the Dixie Chicks, sisters Emily and Martie started Court Yard Hounds so that they could continue with their careers.

The duo's project was announced in January 2010 and the album features Emily Robison on lead vocals.[2] Robison has said that the album is "very personal" and that she will be joined by Jakob Dylan on a track called "See You in the Spring".[3] They are signed to Open Wide Records and Columbia Records, and released their self-titled debut album on May 4, 2010.[4] Their first public appearance as Court Yard Hounds was on in March 18, 2010 at the Americana Music Association's SXSW showcase in Austin, Texas, and the duo plans to tour sometime after May.[3] Lead singer Emily Robison has also confirmed there will be songs based on her divorce from Charlie Robison in 2008.[5] According to Rolling Stone Magazine, while Robison is on lead vocals backed up by her sister Martie, the band consists of Natalie Maines' father, Lloyd Maines, on guitar, and other members are members from the Dixie Chicks' backing band; the album was also be recorded in Maines' home studio. According to Maguire and Robison, the Dixie Chicks have not parted ways.[6] The Dixie Chicks will mount a 2010 tour with the Eagles and Keith Urban.
