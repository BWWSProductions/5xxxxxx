      RELEASE NOTES : Disney's take on the Roald Dahl's wonderful children's
                      story. A unique animation style adds to the feel of
                      the movie. Definately worth a watch for those that
                      have read the book but not seen this adaptation. Fun 
                      for all ages. Enjoy!

         SChiZO is one of the longest living MPEG-4 release groups in
         the scene. Since our inception in March of 2001 we have been
         catering to the needs of DivX & XviD enthusiasts everywhere
         by releasing high-quality DVDRips of the finest films and 
         television shows from around the world.

         We also strive to keep on the cutting edge of new developments 
         in the MPEG-4 scene and applying them within the constraints of
         the existing scene rules. Our XviD settings are chosen in an 
         attempt to create the best compromise between quality and 
         compatibility. In pursuit of that goal, we have decided at that
         this time we will avoid the use of QPel and GMC. As well, when 
         using Custom Mpeg Quantization matrices, we will try to make
         sure that such matrices will be compatible with as many decoders 
         as possible. We are also now using Packed Bitstream in our
         encodes.  With the development of MPEG4Modifier, it is now a 
         simple matter to remove the packed bitstream for those whom PB 
         causes a playback issue. Please make sure to unpack the bitstream 
         and remove the DivX999b000p UserData. Please make sure to update 
         your own decoders if any trouble arises.

         We are currently looking for 100Mbit+ Classic DivX/XviD sites
         in Europe and Asia for affiliation.
