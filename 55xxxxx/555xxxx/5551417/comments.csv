,cubstudios,2011-03-25T11:28Z,"19 Gigs? I downloaded this lynda.com title from Demonoid from an uploader who knew what he was doing. The original package from Lynda.com is 2.26 gig. Don't screencapture the movies. That's just childish and naive. The files are too big and don't work properly. Your downloaders will spend hours trying to fix problems with your original incomplete upload, and it just frustrates everyone and wastes their time."

,Alphinyx,2011-05-26T04:13Z,so many peers! wow! i think its useful! thanks!
,wulwa,2011-06-29T06:36Z,"Its weird that all the idiots are whining for seeding a 19 GB nonsense when they can have the same length and good quality of the very same videos and that is only in 1.01 GB, from the link mentioned twice by gorial and kodeman.

You people must be chasing that ""size does matter"" concept.

Anyways, these videos are totally for a novice, I downloaded it, got disappointed, gave them to my wife as she's learning photoshop now. But I still watched these videos as they are some hell of a nice tutorial. This is how all the tutorials must be like."
,thomashvn,2011-08-21T15:33Z,Piratebay its suppost to exist for sharing... But unfortunatly some people don't like to share anything. Really pitty :(
,blacksidex6,2011-09-06T19:12Z,This world is weird...Thanks begna113...and Please seed;-(
,spockat,2011-09-08T05:41Z,"I downloaded this, and it wont play. Now uploader, why it wont play on Gom, VLC, Windows Media, or any other video player? What file is it? "
,spockat,2011-10-08T15:28Z,"I have this on my computer. What I understand is that I can seed this torrent if I download it to the folder its already in, so its emmediately 100%? 

Tell me how this works, and I'll seed this. so you can download it. And could you please tell me what software to use so I can actually see the video?

Thanks.  "
,l33tg33k,2011-10-28T11:48Z,"@spockat
Yes, redownload the torrent and just point it to where you have the tutorials downloaded, it will then recheck the files, and then begin seeding them, please do it because there is nearly 700 people downloading or stuck at 67%
Thanks!"
,l33tg33k,2011-10-29T14:29Z,"@ jedksytaho Go get sodomized with the biggest retractable baton you can find, and then find the tallest building around, go on top of it and jump off.
Cuz THERE IS NO NEED FOR SERIALS IN FUCKIN AVI FILES you dimwit. Learn how to spam properly, or get a person with actual brain to program you a proper bot, you useless sack of meat and lard.
--------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, back on topic, I see a number of seeds (goes from 5 to 11, 7 right now) in uTorrent for it torrent, yet it doesnt connect to any of them, very frustrating >."
