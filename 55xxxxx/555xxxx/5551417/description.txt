Ok, as per my promise on my other upload of the flash series (found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5543504/Lynda.com_Adobe_Flash_CS5_Full_Tutorials_(Essentials)), I present the Lynda.com Photoshop CS5 Essentials Series (which means no super intense in depth stuff).

also, There were a few files that had dead audio in that flash file, I will be posting a link to a torrent with the corrected files both here and there.


feedback welcome.

using Camtasia with avi clips. any advice or suggestions welcome. after fixing the flash files i am doing dreamweaver.
