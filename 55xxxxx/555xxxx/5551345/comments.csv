,Dantheman420,2010-05-11T08:22Z,"thats kinda the point dude.......... the only this torrent is still living is because for some miracle EZTV didnt post it yet........ maybe he had shit to do today, but with speeds like this, theres now way ur gonna be able to compete"
,Zoow,2010-05-11T08:23Z,"Dantheman420... First of all, calm the fuck down.
Second of all, had this torrent been fake, (Which it isn't) you would be too busy crying to do anything to anyone's family.

Drop the internet tough guy shit. It's not getting you anywhere."

,Bellsoid,2010-05-11T09:15Z,God talk about trickling the seeds. I'm getting 0.7 kB/s on a 4MB connection. Guys must you always only seed the most minimal amount? At this rate uTorrent says I'll get the episode in 9 weeks :(
