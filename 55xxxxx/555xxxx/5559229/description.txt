Sorry if the other Torrent didn't work for you. Might have to do something with the break down of the connection.

      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Fourth Official Update                                         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Please Note - This update does create a new save folder,       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› although it will work with previous saves. You need to         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› navigate to the previous version save folder to open your      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› older saves. We recommend starting a new game in order to get  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› the full effect of the changes and improvements, as some will  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› not apply to older save files.                                 Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Also, this update may reset the automation settings in your    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Options screen. Please open the Options screen again to adjust Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› them to your preference. Apologies for any inconvenience.      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Suggestions on Game Difficulty Settings: It has come to our    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› attention that some of the sliders intended to control         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› difficulty may not be as intuitive as we had hoped. If you     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› want an easier or harder game, please consider adjusting the   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Expansion, Aggressiveness and Home System sliders in your      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› galaxy settings when you start a new game. Expansion controls  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› the level of development the other AI empires start with,      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Aggressiveness controls how likely they are to forego          Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› diplomacy and provoke or declare war, Home System plays a huge Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› role in how wealthy your economy is to begin with. For a       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› harder game, try increasing Expansion a step or two (to Young  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› or Expanding) and increasing Aggression to Unstable or Chaos,  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› along with decreasing your Home System to Trying. For an       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› easier game, move each of these in the other direction. We     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› recommend trying these out in different combinations to        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› determine what works best for you.                             Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 19. Fixed a bug that could cause invisible space monsters      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 20. Fixed a bug that caused the AI Empires to sometimes not    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     build military ships                                       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 21. Fixed occasional game freezes during space battles and     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     planetary invasions                                        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 22. Fixed a bug that could cause two ships in the same         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     location to merge                                          Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 23. Fixed a bug that would not cancel an alliance agreement    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     with a pirate faction when you attack their ships or       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     stations                                                   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 24. Fixed retrofitting for construction, resupply and colony   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     ships                                                      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 26. The Ship Designer now properly resets values for targeting Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     and countermeasures when the relevant components are       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     removed                                                    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 27. Fixed a crash that could happen when editing some planets  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     in the game editor                                         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 29. The Quameno now properly use their special tech (NovaCore  Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã›     levels)                                                    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 32. Fixed messages explaining new racial bonuses when          Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     colonizing a new planet. These now only display when a new Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     race has joined your empire as a result of the             Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     colonization.                                              Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 33. When retrofitting space ports to larger or smaller sizes,  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     the role now properly changes after retrofit (e.g. from    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     medium to large space port)                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 35. Improved the placement of defensive bases around colonies, Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     they should no longer be built right next to each other.   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Game Balance Changes:                                          Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 1. The economy has been overhauled in several respects. It     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    should now scale better and work better than in previous    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    versions. Colony development level now comes half from      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    population (0 at 0 population up to 50 at 500 million) and  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    half from access to luxury resources (50 for 10 luxury      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    resources). Colony income is reduced by local corruption,   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    global empire corruption and corruption caused by distance  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    from the capitol system. The larger and more populated an   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    empire becomes, the greater the overall corruption will be, Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    though larger empires should still be more economically     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    powerful than smaller ones. Please also see the notes at    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    the top of this readme for suggestions on how to make the   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    game easier or harder, depending on your preference.        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 2. Racial bonuses apply in more gradual manner for             Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    multi-racial empires - will only get full bonuses if a      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    race comprises at least half your empire's population       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 3. Rebalanced trade offers so that valuations for tech, bases  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    and colonies much higher. Valuations now also scale quite   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    dramatically based on how much the other empire likes or    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    dislikes you                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 4. Research speed has been halved                              Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 5. Empires now much less likely to colonize in another         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    empire's system                                             Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 6. Your empire's reputation now has less impact on your        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    colonies if the population at the colony is aggressive and  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    unfriendly. In other words, citizens of war-like races      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    aren't so concerned about you having a poor reputation.     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 7. Positive reputation impact from destroying pirate ships has Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    been lowered, but positive reputation impact from           Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    destroying pirate bases has been increased.                 Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 8. Ending a war no longer completely resets attitudes, there   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    may be some lingering animosity                             Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 9. Other empires much less likely to accept unfavourable trade Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    offers                                                      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 10. Private ships can now only be armed with a single weapon - Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     this armament will not cause any offense when they enter   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     other empire's systems                                     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 11. Government types have been rebalanced, resulting in less   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     extreme values for corruption and approval                 Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 12. The AI for other empires and for your own automation is    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     now much more careful about what ships and bases it        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     builds, resulting in much better automated management      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     without overspending.                                      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 13. War weariness now starts lower and increases more          Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›     gradually                                                  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Fleet and Ship Management Improvements:                        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 1. Holding down the Ctrl key while right-clicking to assign a  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    mission now overrides the default mission for the selected  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    ship. This allows you to override the default right-click   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    behaviour and gain access to a comprehensive pop-up menu    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    to select the mission you want, e.g. military ships can     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    refuel at a space port instead of patrolling it, troop      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    transports can refuel at a colony instead of loading troops Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    at it                                                       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 2. Added filtering for ship and base icons at galaxy zoom      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    level - can selectively enable/disable ship types displayed Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    at galaxy level. By default civilian ships are turned off   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    at Galaxy zoom level. Please see the Options screen,        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Advanced Display Options to change this to suit your exact  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    preferences.                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 3. Manually controlled ships will now automatically refuel     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    when low on fuel, and then return to their previous mission Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 4. Manually controlled ships will now automatically repair     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    when damaged, and then return to their previous mission.    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 5. Manually controlled ships will now automatically engage     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    enemy targets without needing to be manually directed to    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    each target. They will then return to their previous        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    mission, e.g. patrol, escort, etc                           Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 6. Patrol missions now automatically reset, i.e. a manually-   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    controlled ship will stay at a patrol target until you      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    tell it to stop                                             Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 7. Fleets should stay together better than previously          Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 8. Fleets should not cancel their missions when advisors       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    suggest other uses for them                                 Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã›    mass retrofit cost for all selected ships and bases is      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    shown and if you cannot afford it you will not be allowed   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    to retrofit.                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 3. Added new design subroles: energy research station, weapons Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    research station, industrial research station, high-tech    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    research station, monitoring station, defensive base. These Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    types of bases are no longer AI-designed if you turn off    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    automation for ship design                                  Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 5. Added maximum weapons energy use to Design screen (top of   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Weapons panel) so that you can compare reactor power output Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    to optimize military designs                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 7. The AI will no longer build ships of a particular type if   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    all designs of that type are marked as obsolete             Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 8. The AI will try to keep design sizes for destroyers and     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    troop transports under the maximum size of your current     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    construction tech                                           Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 9. The AI will now add extra reactors to its designs to make   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    sure the ship has enough energy for maximum effectiveness   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    in combat and movement.                                     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› 3. Expansion Planner now uses the best construction ship to    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    build queued mining stations, which is not necessarily the  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    closest construction ship                                   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 4. Slightly fewer surprise attack suggestions from advisors    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
