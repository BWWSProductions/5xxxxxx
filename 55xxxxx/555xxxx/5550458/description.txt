This game is designed for people, those who want to do some mind exercise. A small game but a good one. 

Directions : 

1.) Use arrow keys (under NUMLOCK i.e. 8 for up, 4 for left, 6 for right and 2 for  down) to move boxes up, down, left and right.
2.) Try to place all boxes in ascending order (horizontally), to win the game.
3.) Compare your score with your friends.

New Version is released for this game, Box Game version 1.0.

Suggestions : 
Download that version instead to use arrow keys (normal keyboard arrow keys) instead.


Enjoy the Game
