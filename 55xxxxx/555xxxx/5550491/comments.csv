,ajb1978,2010-05-14T16:51Z,"Compared to DVD rips:
Audio - 6/10
Video - 4/10

Compared to other Cam or Telesyncs:
Audio - 9/10
Video - 8/10

Entire movie is in English, but it appears to have been filmed from a Russian theater.  Occasional captions in Russian, such as when the name of a place is displayed briefly.  Also, when foreign languages are spoken, the translation captions are in Russian.  Camera angle is tilted ever so slightly, and is slightly left of center.  Color is slightly muted.  No interruptions, no silhouettes of people in the front row, good framerate, perfect audio/video sync.

Overall, a good TS rip."
,torrent_reviewer,2010-05-22T16:02Z,what f**k is this? So many people rated it as good!!! Have anyone of you seen the movie? IT IS SHERLOCK HOLMES. Where is Iron Man 2? I just don't understand is this a joke or piratebay is having problem with torrent files?
,torrent_reviewer,2010-05-22T21:26Z,"Now I understand! In last two days I have downloaded 4 copies of IM2 and all of them are shit. These spammers have found a new way. They are creating IDs with many names and then rating those craps as good torrent. But, how this 500+ seeds are managed? Is it any program that can manipulate seeds or all these 500+ people are dumb. Or do they think that others should also be fooled like they were???? Where is the site administrator in piratebay?? Please do no kill this only site which is reliable for d/l torrents. After sad demise of mininova, this is the only hope in the world of torrent."
