I am now releasing a media pack for Inception. This contains ALL THREE 1080p High Definition Trailers, HD screenshots from those trailers, and the trailer music from the latest trailer IN FLAC FORMAT!

Included:
ALL THREE Inception Trailers in 1080p definition
Mind Heist by Zach Hemsey in FLAC format (song used in the new 3rd trailer...very Hans Zimmer + E.S. Posthumus-ish)

Enjoy!

Also, I will be releasing a new Avatar Media Pack soon with more scans from magazines (I didn't release them earlier as my graphics card died and I couldn't photoshop them on my older PC) and a shrunken BluRay rip of the movie (not my personal rip).



EDIT: Just realized the guy that authored the trailer music is actually spelled ZACK NOT ZACH, but since Zack is short for Zachary you can see my mistake.
