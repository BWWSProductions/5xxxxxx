It's Danny's birthday and there's a wrapped surprise waiting on his bed. When he goes to open it none other than his sister's friend, Sunny Lane, pops out to wish him a happy one. But popping out of the box was only half of the surprise. Danny thought he'd be blowing out candles but Sunny's the only one who will be blowing someone today...
