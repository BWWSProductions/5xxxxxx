In 1995, Anthony Way entranced England with his portrayal of Henry Ashworth,
the choir boy in the BBC's lavish adaptation of Joanna Trollope's acclaimed novel,
'The Choir'and it was the huge and unexpected success of the soundtrack from the
series (it became the second fastest selling classical CD in the UK), which really
catapulted Anthony into the public eye.

4 hours and 38 minutes of interesting drama around a Cathedral with Antony Way 
showing his natural talent as a performer. The quality of his treble voice makes
one return to listen to his singing year after year.
