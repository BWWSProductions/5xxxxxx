The last graduating class of Holy Cross High School in river grove IL put together an amazing documentary of what class was like the last few weeks of the existance of the school.  The school happened to be the best 4 years of our life.

The teachers were a joke and learning was optional.  We caused hell and loved doing it day in and out.


Complements to Mike Schmack on making the great film.  All the credit goes to him.
