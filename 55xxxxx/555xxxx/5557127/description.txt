Title: "Big Time School of Rocque"

      In   the   series   opener  (After  the  iCarly  "iSaved  Your  Life"
      Special),the  guys  get  a dose of reality when Kelly tells them they
      have to go to school at least four hours every day while they live in
      Los  Angeles. While the boys want to go to the fun Palm Woods school,
      they  learn that Gustavo has arranged to have their school located at
      the  recording  studio, so they are never far from his grip. The boys
      do  whatever  is necessary to take down the "School of Rocque" and go
      to  the  Palm  Woods  school,  with the big book that Gustavo gave to
      them.  Meanwhile,  an  attempt  from  Mrs. Knight to homeschool Katie
      fails,  so  she  tries  to  get  Katie to act in a commercial to gain
      entrance in the Palm Woods, with the help of a Talent Manager.
