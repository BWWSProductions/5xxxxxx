 Release Notes
 -------------
 Video Source: Iron.Man.2.TELESYNC.German.720p.x264-PFD [THANKS!]
 Audio Source: Our Own LiNE. 
 
 This time around we used the PFD 720p source. It was pretty good, but had  
 a few issues. Video has a slight rolling flicker to it & too much contrast and
 brightness, so removed a lot of both. Also, we made our own subtitle SRT to 
 Hardcode English subs for the non-English parts only. Might have missed a spot
 or 2, but definitely got most of them. We used our OWN LiNE, manually removing
 each crackle, and then ran through an EQ to bring out a little more bass. 
 Anything worth doing is worth doing right, well we believe that atleast. Those
 that know we have raw audio should know to wait for us by now. ;)  

 Extra: We've included the Iron.Man.2.2010.CAM.END-CREDITS.READNFO.XviD-SPOOKY
 release in this, for anybody curious about the credit scene. Enjoy! =]
