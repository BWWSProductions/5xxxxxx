,ozzi666,2011-03-15T03:13Z,"Thanks alot man, been looking for a LEGIT Xp crack for awhile! Updates good?"
,damike_90,2011-03-18T14:56Z,Thx workes perfectly
,plazmaduck,2011-06-22T22:27Z,"Works fine (so long as no notification comes up in 30 days!) I think too many people are confusing an activation code with 'WGA'. To disable WGA, on set up of xp select disable to automatic updates, when windows is fully loaded then select 'let me choose which updates to download...' then check the updates before downloading, the WGA is clearly listed!"
,Green-Banana,2011-10-27T00:45Z,"I unplugged a faulty hard drive and Windows XP suddenly decided I had three days to reactivate.  The valid activation keys I paid hundreds of dollars for when I got this machine weren't being accepted.  This patch has thankfully fixed the issue of being unable to activate.  Since installing the crack, however, my internet connection seems to keep kicking out at regular intervals.  "
,aberger,2011-12-22T02:47Z,Thanks! Worked for me even after windows had been detected as not genuine. Returned it to working order after reboot.
,eightyy,2012-01-03T03:31Z,"works perfectly!!

1. extract
2. open AntiWPA3 - Windows NT Command Script
3. hit enter
4. check for activation by double clicking the 2 golden keys in the taskbar near the clock. should say ""Windows is already activated""

thanks RedHatcc and all!"
