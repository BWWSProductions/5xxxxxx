,scoopnohlee,2010-06-19T01:24Z,where's the crack for this??  it says there is a crack folder but I don't see the crack. Please don't yell at me if I'm wrong
,yuppyduppy,2010-07-05T03:27Z,What do i do with the crack?
,murrambingi,2010-07-19T08:50Z,"Copy the crack eg: setup file, and then go to the install destination where the other setup file is and paste it there, and when it asks to overide/replace you click yes. Thx gangmie for the upload :)"
,murrambingi,2010-07-19T09:21Z,"In more detail yuppypuppy: copy the ConvertXtoDvd and vso_hwe.dll crack files, then go into Local Disk (C:) ,then Program Files, then VSO, then ConvertX, then 4, then go to file in the top left and select paste or if windows 7 go to organise then select paste, then when it asks to overide or copy and replace you select yes, once that is done you right click on the ConvertXtoDvd transcoder icon(the one with the big red X on it) and select send to desktop, then exit to the desktop and delete the original shortcut(the one that don't say shortcut) then your done..hope that helps :)"
