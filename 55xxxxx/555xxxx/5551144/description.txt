NGC explores drug cultures around the world where people use drugs to enter an "altered state" -- sometimes with dangerous consequences. We visit a village in Venezuela where shamans use drugs to contact the spirit world, a festival in Nepal where hashish is temporarily legalized and a club scene in Amsterdam where drugs have become a focus of both recreational indulgence and scientific inquiry.

*This is the newer "Drugs" episode hence the "2" in the title
