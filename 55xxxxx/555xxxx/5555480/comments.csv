,thuerrsch,2010-05-16T23:52Z,"Thanks for this. A/V quality is decent at best, but I guess that's all you can expect from a plain-vanilla 700 MB avi rip ...

I seems you took your ""no-rar"" motto too literally and dropped the .sub file for the subtitles while unpacking them. That means there are NO SUBTITLES at all. English SubRip subtitles can be found at http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3676017/le-herisson-en. They match this release and they seem pretty good too.

One more thing: You should mentioned the original title, Le HĂŠrisson, in the torrent's title to make it easier to find it."
