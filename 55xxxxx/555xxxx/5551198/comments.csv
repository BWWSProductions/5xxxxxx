,ensignsulu,2010-05-19T02:08Z,"Apparently not being seeded as over 150 users have been stuck at 31% for the last two days - down from over 300, I guess the rest gave up - and were stuck at 23.9% for two days prior to that. :( I recently upgraded my broadband service and now have seven times my former max upload speed, would happily seed this at 700Kbps for a few weeks but if there's no progress in another day or two I'm giving up. - Sulu "
