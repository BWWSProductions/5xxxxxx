,Thinyman,2010-05-12T20:08Z,"Hey ,  i have corrected the info about the torrent. I am sorry for this ,a friend of mine told me about that copy ,but he is in Denmark, me - USA - Connection - fucked up. So the only solution was to publish it ,so that i'll have several seeders for me to download it faster. 

SO now its Corrected and has appropriate look.
If something's wrong , just comment it ."
,Thinyman,2010-05-12T20:13Z,"And i made that torrent fast , without thinking much about the description at first."
,Thinyman,2010-05-12T23:17Z,"last editing: it doesn't matter if you put or you didn't put the tick ,just under the activation key field. Of course don't fill that field either.
Just don't do anything unussual, except clicking next and so on ... "
,Thinyman,2010-05-14T07:10Z,"Today i have installed all possible updates ( around 46-47 MB in total ) and so far ,so good. No Genuine problems. And the the guy who has been using this copy for already a month is saying that everything is ok ."
