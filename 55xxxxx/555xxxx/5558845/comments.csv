I copy all to Skins folder under the Program Files directory.
Now why is it, when I open Powerdvd and go to change the skin, there is always only one there?
I have to merge the reg file for each skin whenever I want to use it, but it always replaces the previous one.
Is that how it is supposed to be, or am I missing something?"

That's why I created the reg files."
