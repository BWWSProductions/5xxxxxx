,Triple_Beam,2010-05-15T06:06Z,"Hey Chouonsoku, some guy has the latest episodes up on here....but the suck on quality.  they are .flv's Hope you still upload them in higher quality like these .mkv's"
,Chouonsoku,2010-05-15T22:28Z,"Yeah I saw those, they're just crappy flash videos ripped from some website. Horrible quality. I'll keep uploading the WEB-DL's as they show up on iTunes, but because of a recent format switch by Cartoon Network, the episodes may come pretty sporadically. Only one new 10 minute episode is airing each week to extend the season.

But know that as soon as I get that little email telling me the next episode is available, it'll be here. :)"
,Triple_Beam,2010-05-19T00:40Z,Awesome dude thanks for the reply!  Can't wait till you get them.  Me and my daughter love this show.  We can watch this shit all day LOL 
,equalsk,2010-05-19T00:55Z,"Dude, you rock. These are by far the best quality rips of the show I've seen.
Fell in love with it when I was lucky enough to catch the start of the run when I visited the States for the first time.
Can't get it here in the UK and due to new iTunes store restrictions I can't download it on my US account.
Keep 'em coming fella, I can't live without my Finn and Jake crack! :-D"
