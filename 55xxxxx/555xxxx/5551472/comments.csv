My upload speed tops out at around 63kb/s, and this torrent is almost 12GB. Even if it were to max out this speed every second of every day, it will still be 3 days before this is even close to being uploaded. As well, it is being Initial Seeded in order to maximize seeds once it finally is uploaded. Be patient with it."

Ask yourself why.

It is not as it appears now - full of dis-information."
