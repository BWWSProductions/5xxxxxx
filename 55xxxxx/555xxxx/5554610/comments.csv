Thanks for the upload!"
,ReloyB,2010-05-16T03:28Z,Appreciate the upload but I don't think this is her debut album. There was an album in 2003 and an EP in 2007...
,i_make_trouble,2010-05-17T01:25Z,I meant its her debut album in her conceptual series ''Metropolis''. Her earlier album ''Audition'' in 2003 was a very different work and she had a different band.
,soul-sound,2010-05-25T01:35Z,"thank you for the upload.
greats from Amsterdam"
,Fighter02,2010-05-29T02:20Z,"This is her first PROPER album release.

The 2007 EP Metropolis was the start of this concept, and this is the continuation."
,Fighter02,2010-05-29T02:20Z,"She is amazing, and this is an AMAZING album.

People should download it and buy it too!!!"

Is so damn fresh, that kicks in the butt to all the shit we've been hearing lately. The best album of the year, out of this world. I think Janelle and Kellindo are aliens that have come to save us from hearing shit and avoid to kill ouselves in the process. "
,partchimp,2011-06-26T10:42Z,I'd never heard of her until I saw highlights of her set at Glastonbury yesterday... blew me away!
,sweetie_candykim,2011-07-03T17:39Z,"Thanks.  
Dance or die clips off at the end though"
,Izzy011,2012-04-15T03:27Z,It's meant to continue on into Faster
