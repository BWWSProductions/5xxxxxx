Natsu Basho - Day 05 - 2010 May (Xvid-*.AVI)

Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 05 of the May honbasho from the RyÅgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo.  

This recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG

I will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.


PS.  This is in the secondary language: English
