,osriccc,2010-11-13T19:41Z,"Please... Upload or (someone do) a 2.5 Gb or similar copy of this witout any subs (which yo can get easy in the net!) it's a PERFECT movie and deserves a perfect rip. I have it since 2008 already, but I don't have a Bdplayer so PLEASE, PLEASE! This is my favorite movie of all time."
,eldarfinwe,2011-04-08T22:42Z,"Beware.. This is a hardcode-subbed version. It is written in the torrent summary but i didn't noticed. 

Video and audio quality is fine."
