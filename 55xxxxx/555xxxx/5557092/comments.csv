,rizzon,2010-05-13T20:03Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.
Uploader is a troll and only uploaded 99.9%, choose the other torrent."
,aliasbind,2010-05-13T21:13Z,"Actually, the torrent file got damaged somehow, so the last bits cannot be downloaded anymore. Everyone still stuck at 99% please remove the torrent (not the data), rename your download folder from ""Modern.Family.S01E23.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION [NO-RAR] [ somethingsomething ]"" to just ""Modern.Family.S01E23.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION"". 

Then download the other torrent from

thepiratebay[dot]org/torrent/5557936/Modern.Family.S01E23.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION

and the downloading process should resume from 99%."
