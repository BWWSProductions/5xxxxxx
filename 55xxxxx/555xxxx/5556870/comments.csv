For example pre.scenedb.org it will confirm that a release is real, enter in the release in question in the search, or just the movie, etc title and it will provide a list of the recently confirmed releases of that name."

,ANG369,2010-05-13T23:52Z,"Ok listen... I didn't think anyone would take it seriously but anyway: You CAN play a 3d movie on a regular screen and see the effect. But, you need a 3d version of the movie (which is not out yet) and it won't look as good as in the cinema.

,xerobacter,2010-05-14T15:26Z,"@ ANG369 you're wrong and maybe you're right. You wrong about the regular screen because a 3D video have an higer frame rate than normal video, I think it's 60Hz and if your screen don't refresh the picture at this rate it will not be possible. But maybe for the others... I hope you're right.
By the way very good movie

,ANG369,2010-05-15T01:19Z,"xerobacter...
The Effect is achieved by playing to different layers of picture. One in red and the other in blue, so when you put on the magic glasses each eye sees a different picture and the brain translates it into depth (i.e the 3rd dimension)

My screen actually does produces 60hz (as most screens, I believe), but I don't think it matters...."
,M0e09,2010-05-15T01:24Z,"@jeof22: try using VLC, there's also a MAC version available. Subtitles are available under the video options.

Oh an thanks for the upload GoodFilms :-) The video quality is very good regarding the file size but most likely not as good as CBGB's 1080p version xD Considering the quality of the movie itself (content-wise), a 720p rip is enough in my point of view :D

For the video playback I start recomending other players than VLC because I recognize artefacts and pixel blocks while watching ""high bitrate"" BDRips... so try using KMPlayer or something like this if you are faced with quality problems."

If that were true you could print a playboy with  polarized images and wear shutter or polarized glasses to see a magazine in 3d:P  Its bs, you need a 120hz input screen, not frame repeat but unique frames for each eye, aka a 3D tv costing thousands, a 3d ready bluray player, and shutter glasses."

This all changed over the years, but once in a while someone reminds us of how awesome, peaceful and exclusive the scene used to be.

Hats of to CBGB and GoodFilms for sharing this."
