the imdb link for hazaaron khwaishein aisi is:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411469/

it is a very critically acclaimed movie by sudhir gupta starring 	Kay Kay Menon,Shiney Ahuja,Chitrangada Singh. 

HKA is a reminder to the youth of today that there were times when young blood was idealistic and not idle-istic. It is a dark reality, and a bitter truth of the struggle, which many went through during those turbulent times. Maybe the youth should wake up to such calls, and not just work in call-centers, lest we downgrade to a society where we might again be dominated and Independence becomes a facade. 

Khwaishein Aisi (HKA) is the story of such turbulent times during the India of the 60's and the 70's. The Emergency, the Naxalite movement, the domination of government in every decision Indians made. It is the story of three people who lead contrasting lives, with contrasting ideologies, and how their lives are intertwined."
