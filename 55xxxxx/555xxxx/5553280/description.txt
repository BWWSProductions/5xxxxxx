Glenn Mitchell pays tribute to the master of comic confusion, Harry Worth, one of the most popular - and subsequently most neglected - comedians of the 1960s. Mitchell interviewed Worth in 1987 and his recording forms the backbone of this tribute, in the 20th anniversary year of the comedian's death.

Harry Worth's television and radio shows drew comparisons with Tony Hancock, and the famous opening gag of his TV series, that of Harry posing beside a shop window so that his reflection suggests a man spreadeagled in mid-air, is still fondly remembered - and imitated - by public and professionals alike.

The programme tells his story through interviews with Harry and his friends and colleagues and, perhaps for the first time, explains why his career lost direction for over a decade before getting back on track shortly before his death. Including contributions from producers John Ammonds and William G Stewart and actor Jonathan Cecil.
