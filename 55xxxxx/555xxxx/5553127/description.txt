Excellent band
Exquisite musicianship.
Geniuses in both technicality and feeling.
One of the most amazing bands around today.

Standout tracks are Chinchilla, Baboon, Lemur, Badger, Quetzal, Panda, Elk, Pig, Gibbon, Dog, Crocodile, Rabbit and Zebra.

The reason behind the odd song names is that while recording, they wanted to refrain from formal titles such as 'Track 01' so they named them after animals as a temporary fix. They couldn't think of titles for them in time for the release, so they just left them as they were.

Similar to Tubelord and Cinema Staff.

Enjoy! I'll be uploading their Self-Titled EP as well, so keep an eye out for that.
