This is a FULL version of media player which is compatable with windows XP PRO and Windows VISTA.

Nice little player plays most of the films other players dont accept.

No need to mess around just configure the player once installed into program files (cut n paste) select mplayerc application and configure in the menu (view) options file and create a short cut in the menu entry and away you go.

CLASSIC........
