Plot outline:
Travel around the world in the powerful ocean currents. Experience an alien world  with animals so inaccessiable, that they are still a mystery to the biologists.
Meet some of the millions of underwater animals, from small seahorses and jellies, to the big turtles and giant sharks, and illuminating creatures from the pitch black darkness of the deep ocean.
