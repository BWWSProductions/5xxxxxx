I dont even know Obama...You're a fucking idiot--BitchSoetoro Then when you attack me that makes you what?...personally, I've been taking screenshots of your comments so I can show my grandkids just how uninformed people can be, and how incredibly dangerous it is...--BitchSoetoro...If you show your grandkids this you will make me immortal :) Yeah TrickBaby...The welfare state is based on forcefully taking from one and giving what is taken to another under a delusion of ""fairness"". To argue that the sharing of the content of these torrents is similar to this is beyond absurd--Bugboo Listen Bugboo if someone offers intellectual property and you steal it...Meaning obtain it without paying for it then it cannot be considered ""shared""...Also, I think Rush already has a term for what you've just said...""Wealth Distribution""...Thanks to the uploader.--Bugaboo That's the least you can do...As always - many thanks, jwhitt for your services to mankind! :) --ThunderBitch....Services to mankind...Really...ThunderBitch, you are a day late and a Quarter short(Mentally)...Please go back to your job when your favorite saying is,""Do you want fries with that burger""...END  The Truth Hurts Huh?

Oh Tricky you are such a sad and deluded little man. While the legality of torrents and whether or not it is stealing is certainly a topic for debate, you are so far off the mark it is comical.

The Marxist model of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"" and the use of force (don't pay your taxes and men with guns will throw you in jail) to redistribute wealth in this way has nothing to do with someone recording an internet stream, editing out the commercials and then sharing it over a p2p network.

While posting CDs and movies on a torrent site is arguably ""stealing"", posting a freely available AM radioshow is certainly not in the same league and trying to compare this to a welfare state just displays how ignorant and simpleminded you really are.

Thanks to the uploader"

,booboo332,2010-05-12T05:57Z,"One last thing, Little Trick. ""sharing"" has nothing to do with how you acquired something.  A homeless guy stealing a loaf of bread and giving some of it to his friends is still sharing, as is someone who donates to a charity.  Sure, he broke the law when he stole it but it doesn't negate the definition of the word ""share"".

As someone who supports the State's theft of people's hard earned money in order to waste it and give some of it to the undeserving, you have absolutely no highground to preach from."

,booboo332,2010-05-12T19:25Z,"""I dont think $6.95 is free""  

This torrent is recorded, not the 24/7 podcasts, numbnuts, and it is freely available to stream from hundreds of stations online.  This is no different than someone recording it on tape and giving it a friend.  

""Also bugaboo this isnt rocket science by definition peer to peer is sharing""

You were the one who wrote, ""Meaning obtain it without paying for it then it cannot be considered ""shared"" ""  I simply pointed out that sharing has nothing to do with how something is obtained. This is a fact, not ""rhetoric""

When the actual podcast was being posted this was certainly a violation of the membership agreement but to say it is stealing is highly debatable and by no means meant posting it as torrent wasn't sharing as you claimed.

Regardless, I was quite clear that the point you made that was so fucking absurd was that these torrents are somehow similar to a government welfare program.

""bugaboo Bugaboo i claim no highground""

""Bullshit.  Every post you make is smug and self righteous.

""...I give you facts and you give me rhetoric...""

Oh please.  You gave no legitimate facts and are clearly to dim to understand how illogical your statements were. 

""Oh if dont like paying taxes then form your own country or shut the F@#$ up...END""

What part of ""waste it and give some of it to the undeserving"" is beyond your grasp, little trick.  I never said that taxes shouldn't be paid.  Arguing for less of something and responsibility in its use is not arguing for the abolishment of it."

I'm sure that you download stuff all the time that costs money. That's why the site is call The ""Pirate"" Bay. We're all pirates. I'm proud to be a pirate. I admit it's stealing and have no problem with it. You're as big a hypocrite as anyone here, so shut the fuck up about this. You lefties think you're soooo much better than everyone else, but in your case, you're TOTALLY full if shit. The worst part is you think you're smart. Believe me, you're the only one who thinks so. Now get off your ass and move out of your mom's basement."
