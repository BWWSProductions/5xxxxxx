        PLOT:

        Chan Ker Yung is the only son of the late king of sticks, Lord Chan.
        Cocky and playful, the young Chan thinks he is a natural staff fighter
        and doesn't bother to train. His three uncles know otherwise and make
        him take a clan test. Of course he fails, and is exiled until he can
        pull himself together. On his travels Chan meets up with many staff-
        wielding allies and foes. Romance is also in the air when he saves the
        beautiful double-stick damsel Yu Yun from marrying the idiot son of
        the sworn enemy of his family.

        Northerner Liu Ta Yeh is on the warpath and plans to smash the Chan
        household. The young master rushes home to find that he is too late.
        Most of his uncles and servant have been killed by Liu's mouse tail
        stick, and Liu has left a note for Chan challenging him to deadly
        staff combat in the bamboo grove. Can the young prodigal defeat the
        might of the white-haired northerner, or will he come to a sticky end?
