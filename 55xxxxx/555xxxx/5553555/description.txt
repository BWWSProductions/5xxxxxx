Rating:        M (Mature)
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console. If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

This Grand Theft Auto-inspired game of violence and vengeance begins deep in Maya jungle, where a man named Ernesto Cruz was lost in 1989. The official explanation for his disappearance was fatal overdose, but this is not enough for Ernesto's twin sons, Ram and Tommy. They embark on a quest for truth, though the Mexican wilderness and underworld urban environments inhabited by gangs, drug lords, and dangerous women.

Players can explore the large areas on foot, or commandeer any vehicle they choose. Total Overdose features a fighting game-styled combo system, and smart, skilled shooting unlocks new equipment and abilities. A "Rewind" system allows players to repeat a sequence to nail a perfect combo, or even to turn back the clock and avoid a fatal mistake.


Features:

* 60+ Super Cool Moves â€“ Combine different moves to pull off high scoring kills.
  Itâ€™s not just about shooting, but doing it with style.

* Uber-Cool Characters â€“ Hot babes, drug lords and underworld low-lifes. Ram meets
  and beats them all.

* Free Style Combat & Stunt System â€“ Link up acrobatic skills and special kills to 
  earn big scores and rewards. Combo chains unlock loco moves, weapons & power ups.

* Combo Timer â€“ Each time you waste a bandito, the Combo Timer starts a countdown.
  If the countdown reaches zero, the current combo is calculated as number of 
  kills multiplied by style points and added to your total score.

* Rewind System â€“ Use the rewind system to return from the grave or to make 
  perfect killer combos.

* Control Any Vehicle â€“ From cars and 18 wheelers to tractors and motorbikes, dive
  out of any vehicle at any speed to ram enemies and do ultimate stunts.

* Huge Arsenal â€“ A massive range of weapons. Unlock dual wielding to do double 
  damage. The better you get the bigger your arsenal.
