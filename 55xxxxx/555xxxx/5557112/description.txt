IMAGiNE NOTES
Right sources used first.......russian cam, SPOOKY's end credits and our own video and audio. Where to begin ....alot of work and time went into this so thanks for all sources and to users who helped.

Right first off our video source had some movement so we cut it up and rotated the videos and resized all to match up ...also there was two parts missing one when the camera got hidden and missed 1min of footage and the other was the after end credits. For these two parts we've used the video out of our first TS and also used spookys end credits video and audio...both needed work to match the main video eg resizing,framerates and what not.

Once we got all the video we had to added spookys cam audio to the end of our audio to make a complete audio file and then it was a case of syncing which was a bitch!!!....mainly due to different sources and video being cut, but we've got there in the end.

Now a few things firstly yes the subtitles are all in english inc speaking parts and locations.
Secondly due to the movement there is a few parts when the camera movement from left to right and vice versa.....we've done alot of work and made right of most be there is parts were you'll get a black border down the right hand side.
