,Eejay.Jauregg,2010-06-25T02:23Z,what's up with these subtitles? they are much too big and for some reason vlc's settings won't change the size.
,scapealiv,2010-07-16T16:10Z,"Really awesome quality! I think the subtitles size is okay, it\'s a little big though."
,osriccc,2010-12-01T17:23Z,"Harsubbed stuff on the movie. An advice, avoid downloading KAA or other ANIME uploaders torrents if you want a clean rip without any alien text actually pasted into the video."

the subtitles aren't embedded into the video. You can disable them (in VLC anyway)"
,osriccc,2011-03-08T20:31Z,"Yes, subs are not embedded but ""Kick Ass Anime"" publicity is, so avoid this if you hate that stuff."
