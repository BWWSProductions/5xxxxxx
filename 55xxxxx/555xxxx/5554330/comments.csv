,jrunke,2010-05-12T23:27Z,when i download these 1g versions I dont get the voices in the audio.  Only music and some background noise tracks.  Anyone have a clue as to why that might be?
,philbetter,2010-05-13T07:59Z,Try downloading the k-lite codec pack. It sounds like you don't have the correct codecs for the file to play right.
,Ask_me,2010-05-13T11:46Z,Thanks man...........!!!
,jrunke,2010-05-15T01:34Z,"Thanks Phil, but its still not working for me.  I downloaded, installed, and ran the ""Codec Tweak Tool"" after using whatever common sense i have to discern between the infinite number of install and run options, and the audio is the same as before.  I feel like i must be dong something wrong...any suggestions?"
,frankstone,2010-05-15T05:14Z,"it has NOTHING to do with codecs, if you hear the audio but not the voices...If you´re using KMplayer I know what it is, go to: Audio - stream selection, for an unknown reason Kmplayer always do this( on mkv files) when both streams of audio are on, you don´t hear voices, you got choose just one, either right or left, but not both...
if you don´t use Kmplayer, i don´t know, but doesn´t hurt trying this..."
