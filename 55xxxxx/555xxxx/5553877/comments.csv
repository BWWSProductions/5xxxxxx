,theropod,2010-05-12T17:04Z,if there is no help for serial key dont try to download this addon!!:(( 
,karakorama,2010-05-12T18:30Z,Why upload this without a serial or a crack?.  DonÂ´t waste your time and donÂ´t download this one.
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T19:03Z,"I totally agree, maybe thats why they went Anonymous 1 gig of garbage."
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T19:10Z,serial: TONGFSX-I10-17764-NNN33-53283
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T19:20Z,TONGFSX-I10-17764-NNN33-53283
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T19:41Z,wrong serial rolfi11
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T19:55Z,"@Doggit07:  looks like you dunno how to copy and paste, hehe"
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T20:02Z,I did and the next tab didnt highlight to continue
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T20:04Z,did this happen to anyone else? need the tab that reads next to highlight to continue installation. wont do it with the serial you posted rolfi11
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T20:17Z,"sorry noob, i surrender :("
,theropod,2010-05-12T20:41Z,ogargen please tell us how did you work it. how can we pass the serial page?
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T20:46Z,"@ rolfi11 well at least im not the only one that it wont work for and how hard is it to copy and paste? it either works or not and in this case it's a not,and as far as a nood I have been programming and doing autocad for 8 years noob that. hehe"
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T20:58Z,"Ok guys the noob Doggit07 has figured it out rolfi11 has somehow done the letter I wrong, the solution is do not copy and paste the serial just type it in and you will notice the letter ""I"" at the first part of the serial simply looks like a straight line use caplocks and you will see the ""next' in the exe highlight. This will start the install."
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T21:05Z,:)
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T21:23Z,"well guys, you're right. looks like tpb doesn't transfer the right copy and paste. sry"
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T21:30Z,peace to all ;)
,theropod,2010-05-12T21:47Z,didnt works:((( is it like this:?10-17764-NNN33-53283  ?
,theropod,2010-05-12T22:03Z,ok thank you i made it!!!:))) sorry my mistake. it works:))))) 
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T22:15Z,"the way it originally was is TONGFSX-I10-17764-NNN33-53283 / at the end of the dash after TONGFSX there is the letter I. instead of copying and paste just type in the serial in caplocks on and the letter I will appear different, simply looking like a straight line. once the serial is put in this way it will work. and np rolfi11 if I had a penny for every mistake I made I could buy FSX out. lol, honest mistake. :)"
,rolfi11,2010-05-12T22:53Z,"@Doggit07, yep, you`ve got it, pardon what i've told about u ;)"
,Doggit07,2010-05-12T22:57Z,"np, we all here for fun :)"
,bigfart10,2010-05-12T23:09Z,"Many thanks, works perfectly."
,karakorama,2010-05-13T18:49Z,"Thanks rolfi11, the serial works perfect!.  And thansks to Anonymous for upload the right installer instead of the old one that have elevated runaways."
