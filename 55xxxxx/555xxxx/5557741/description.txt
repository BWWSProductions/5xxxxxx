NEW Star Trek The Next Generation 24p Smooth Motion Rips - No Blending!

FINALLY a High Quality, Motion Corrected 24p x264 1000kbps encode, with both
 original ac3 audio tracks (5.1 and 2.0)

These come from the NTSC DVDs, and are of much better quality than any
 deinterlaced encode I have ever found, including the official PAL DVDs.

Stuttering, jerky effects and or live action are 99% eliminated. (A few remain,
 particularly during that pesky title sequence, but only a small number.)
