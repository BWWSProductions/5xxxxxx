,rizzon,2010-05-23T22:25Z,"@BadHabitRemix, This is a DVDr. If your DVD can't read it, you are doing it wrong.
Quality has nothing to if it's in DVD format or an img-file."
[T],lilmjkl,2010-05-24T21:18Z,"Its just an Avi file made into DVD format.

Quality is bad for 4,37 Gigabytes."
,rizzon,2010-05-24T23:41Z,I agree with lilmjkl above. The uploader re-encoded it but just increased the size. The quality is still the same as of a 700MB-rip. Get one of those instead.
,BrutalBrian,2010-05-25T00:56Z,how do you mount this file on a mac?!
,arwan,2010-06-01T15:48Z,"download this one proper NTSC, if you want a quality stuff is here!!

,rich97,2010-06-08T20:14Z,"Please buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. Support the art and hard-work that goes into making a gem among the generic crap that is pumped out by hollywood.

As for the release, I couldn't ask for much more.

v - 8

And that is me being picky, perfectly watchable, unless you're elitist. :)"
