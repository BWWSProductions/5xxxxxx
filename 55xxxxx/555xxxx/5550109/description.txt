Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so. 

Audio : English DD 5.1 - 384 Kbps   
  

Subs :  Swedish, Spanish, Dutch, Brazil, Chinese, Croatian, Vietnamese, Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarain, Romanian. 

(English sub-only 70% good, I spend 8 hours re-wording, syncing and fixing it, only done first 33 minutes, too lazy and tire to do the rest, but the rest are ok enough to watch, take it or wait a few months for the R1 retail.)

(Finnish sub-I forgot to change the language regional code, strange characters will appear, sorry, will do better when the BluRay is here)

Source : I downloaded 4 DVDr releases by: rEY; PrisM, IMAGINE, xR5
All the video are pretty much the same for a R5, 

rEY- has the best original real 5.1 audio, so I used theirs.
