[T],reactor90,2010-05-11T18:16Z,WTF is math rock?
,Dr_Tran,2010-05-11T18:42Z,"It's a genre of music that is centered around odd time signatures.

There's also MathCore which is basically the same principle but with Hardcore influence.
Some examples are The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Arusha Accord, Between The Buried And Me and The Number 12 Looks Like You, but that's straying into Tech Metal/Tech Core"

It's a genre of music that is focused on odd time signatures.
Like a typical bar of math rock might be;
|| 4/4 | 3/4 | 7/8 | 3/4 ||
Some Math Rock bands are Tubelord, Cinema Staff, This Town Needs Guns and Foals.

Then there's Mathcore or Mathmetal.
Between The Buried And Me, Protest The Hero and Meshuggah are some good examples.

There are a few more genres that feature odd time signatures and time changes.
Progressive Rock/Metal (The Mars Volta/TooL)
TechMetal (The Arusha Accord)
TechCore (The Number 12 Looks Like You/The Dillinger Escape Plan)

Hope that helped, if you care haha.
Just curious, did you download the album?
If so was it of good quality?"
