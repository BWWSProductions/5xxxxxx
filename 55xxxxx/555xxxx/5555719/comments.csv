Thanks!"
,Blightwalker,2010-05-22T17:28Z,"It doesn't work for me. I am using Mac OS X (Snow Leopard x64) Here is the error:

AFTER EFFECTS ERROR: opening resource file ""twitch.aex"" - unexpected end-of-file (-39).
(3 :: 54)

The same happens with 32-bit twitch. Any tips?"
,Rauwgh,2010-06-16T23:39Z,"Im stuck.
Ive put all the files in the correct directories yet it doesnt acknowledge them in After effects CS4.
I cannot find them anywhere in it.
It should appear under effects -> video copilot but it does not.
Help?"
,fjenebeck,2010-06-18T03:08Z,"Works perfect!

Just some noobs down there who can't understand descriptions.. TY for a very good torrent :D"
,tozzy81,2010-06-19T06:12Z,"No it wont work on my imac running 10.6.2, works on everything else though. Does this not work with the Intel Core i5's? I guess not... :("
,cosmoray,2010-06-21T01:36Z,"I'm also getting the error

""AFTER EFFECTS ERROR: opening resource file ""twitch.aex"" - unexpected end-of-file (-39).
(3 :: 54)""

I'm on 10.5.8

Any suggestions?"
,xsoniccrackersx,2010-06-28T08:12Z,"To those with the : AFTER EFFECTS ERROR: opening resource file ""twitch.aex"" - unexpected end-of-file (-39).
(3 :: 54)

error. That is because this is the PC version of Twitch. The Mac versions will have a .plugin extension, NOT aex. You will have to go looking elsewhere for it. Try googling 'Twitch 1.1 for Mac' that should find it for you fast."

not mac"
,diegoodor,2010-08-13T18:18Z,I PUTTED THE FOLDER THAT SAYS 32 BIT WITH THE AE KEY INSIDE IT IN PLUGINS THEN I OPENED AFTER EFFECTS CS4 AND I HIT THE AE KEY AND IT SAYS //THE SPECIFIED FILE IS NOT A REGISTRY SCRIPT// I RESTART AFTER EFFECTS CS4 AND START A PROJECT AND THE TWITCH WAS WORKING PERFECT.  THANKS.

,SuperCanfiax,2011-01-01T15:55Z,Would this work with Premiere Pro CS5? If so - how? I haven't figured this out so far :-(.
,lonnieg,2012-04-12T01:34Z,"Got it working but I am getting the copilot banner on my footage. Is this just a demo, I followed the instructions. "
,Mr_BojangIes,2012-07-08T08:01Z,Works great on Win7 64bit CS5.5
