Title: 	"Gassie Passes"
	
      Feeling that Gassie doesn't get the affection that he deserves, Sonny
      takes  it upon herself to show the dog love, love that it doesn't get
      from  its trainer. Sonny then finds out that giving the dog affection
      effects  Gassie's  mood  to  flatulate  on  command  when filming the
      "Gassie"  sketches  as  well  jeopardizing the feature film "Gassie &
      We". Sonny then gives Gassie too many dog treats that may have killed
      him.  In  the  end  it  turns  out  Gassie was in shock from too many
      meatball treats and gets the love he deserves, also putting Chad into
      shock  by  pretending  to  be  dead. Meanwhile, Nico and Grady borrow
      money  from  Dakota  Condor  to  invest in fart noise lunch boxes for
      "Gassie & We".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      For Frequently Asked Questions please read the included FAQ README.
      
      Any  show  that I decide to cap by request I will not keep either the
      source  or  the  converted  file.  The  torrent is deleted after full
      distribution  and  seeding.  I  distribute 2 full copies and keep the
      torrent  for  a  week  but don't count on a reseed after 2 weeks, the
      torent  will be deleted to make room for other content. It will be up
      to  everyone  in the swarm to keep these alive for the next person in
      line. 

      
      For  those who  have trouble  playing the episodes I recommend  using
      another  player  such  as  KMPlayer  which  is free and uses it's own
      Built-in codecs, plays almost everything and is loaded with features.
            
      These are NMT Compatible. These episodes should play with no problems
      on most Networked Media Tanks and other similar players.
