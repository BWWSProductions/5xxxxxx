Brent Weinbach - The Night Shift - 2009


â€Making people laugh is the lowest form of comedy.â€


-Michael Oâ€™Donoghue

Turbulent times breed great comedy. Just as the stone-cold bummer of the 1970s begat Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks and the golden-age National Lampoon, the fascism creep of the aughties opened a sprawling â€œunderground comedyâ€ landscape, ranging from the explosive cynicism of Doug Stanhope to the melancholic absurdity of Zach Galafianakis. But unlike Brooks and NatLamp, most of todayâ€™s comedy luminaries have yet to really capitalize on the potential of the long-playing album. The typical comedy album remains essentially a glorified demo reel, a well-broken set performed in front of a sympathetic audience (which is usually mixed way too loud). Itâ€™s a stacked deck. A few of the more brazen rebels of the â€™90s experimented with taping in front of unfriendly audiences (see Bill Hicksâ€™s Flying Saucer Tour or Andrew Dice Clayâ€™s probably-forever-unsung classic The Day the Laughter Died), but if these records sounded weird, that spoke more of the genreâ€™s creative poverty than of Clayâ€™s and Hicksâ€™s courage. More recently, even the highest-profile innovators havenâ€™t tried much new on wax.

Enter alienated San Francisco art nerd Brent Weinbach. If Galifianakisâ€™s boozy outrÃ© concert film Live at the Purple Onion wasnâ€™t quite comedyâ€™s Magical Mystery Tour, Weinbachâ€™s The Night Shift isnâ€™t quite its White Album. (It might be closer to Pure Guava.) But, for a comedy record, itâ€™s got a damned impressive experimental streak, and it deserves to be widely influential.

Weinbach celebrates cathartic awkwardness, not just in his material (when asked, â€œAre you retarded?â€ our man responds, â€œNo. I mean, I was retarded. But I worked out so much on my SoloFlex, my brain muscles got buff with the rest of my bodyâ€), but also in his production values. Less than half of The Night Shift is recorded live. The rest consists of manic, often confrontational voicemails from his alternate personae, a few approximately sincere Tin-Pan-Alley weepers, and, most intriguingly, a lot of studio-recorded auditory noir which recalls nothing so much as a gleefully immature take on the radio theater of Joe Frank.

Much as the comedians of the â€™70s spoke on the intellectual constipation of their parents and the washed-out utopianism of their hippie peers, Weinbach speaks to the claustrophobic estrangement, the muted pessimism, and particularly the deep-seeded awkwardness of the typical post-W urbanite. Some of this stuff is more fascinating than â€œfunny,â€ but, nonetheless, I predict big, big things for this one-of-a-kind young man.
