        PLOT:

        When angry nobleman Wang Tao's son is turned into a basket case
        by Ching Tao and his brother, he employs a sadistic killer to do
        away with the two. Ching escapes the massacre but his brother and
        grumpy old misery of a father are burnt to death in an almighty
        inferno caused by the killer. Ching, now homeless, wanders the
        streets looking for scraps to eat and trying his best to stay
        clear of the mad assassin. When he helps a very peculiar old man
        in a fight with some streets acrobats, the grateful old man takes
        him home to stay with him and his wife. The two grumpy old Taoists
        teach Ching the gentle but deadly art of Tai Chi to prepare him
        for the maniac killer who is still patrolling the area with the
        aid of a giant wheel. Eventually the killer catches up with Ching,
        who uses the soft approach to tackle the most insane of foes...

        Insane, innovative genius from the Yeun brothers plus a brilliant
        debut performance from Donnie Yen. A classic martial arts movie
        for fight fans everywhere.

        RiPPERS NOTES:

        A long time ago we brought you the dubbed version of this crazy Yuen
        Clan movie. Today we give you the Cantonese subtitled version. For
        some reason, the intro speech was not subtitled, but it is hardly
        neccecary to understand the plot. And if you by any chance have not
        seen this before, it is in the same vein as our favourite Yuen Clan
        movies such as Taoism Drunkard, Shaolin Drunkard and Miracle Fighters.
        Or in other words: Don't miss it for the world!

        English dubtrack included as extras.
