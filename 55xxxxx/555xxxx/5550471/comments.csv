But am I missing something here? The movie has no subtitles and there is no .BAT file to execute?"
,truthseekers,2010-05-11T21:44Z,".Bat fil, avoid it... any exe or bat files are nasty viruses probably. I would scan first and run in a sandbox."
,D0gmeat,2010-05-12T04:18Z,"@truthseekers:  you're kidding right? About BAT files? You know they're just DOS scripts, right? They don't post any problems; the .EXEs they call might compromised but the .BAT itself is not a worry.

In any case, there is no .BAT file included with this torrent or anything that would make this movie subbed. I cannot find a decent working subtitle for this movie. The dubbed version is atrocious."

Syncs perfectly, though the introduction isn't subbed at all."

It may surprise you if you don't know command line that malware bat files can do plenty of damage, so always read them before running.  You can also rename anything .bat and it will be run so reading it ensures it is what you think it is.  Simple policy, read scripts before running them."
