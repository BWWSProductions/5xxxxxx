,prism098,2010-05-13T05:10Z,"RIiiiiiiiiiiight in my judgment ( not the best either) i'd say ;

V good, dark in places like you would expect a high quality cam, but very watchable
 so 8? 

A i'll reserve casting an opinion until watched all the way through, but for now ; 8 too

Good upload, many thanks"
,WashingtonDC1911,2010-05-13T10:31Z,"Thanks, it's more than watchable and it does not look dark at all on my HDTV, perhaps those who complain about it being dark needs to get a better TV.

,sexygirlrocks,2010-08-23T04:50Z,"Question: Why do some torrents flag you for copyright infringement through your cable company? I downloaded this and got a letter from them specifically related to this torrent. This has actually happened a few times lately. Is there something that I should be watching out for that I am not aware of?
THX"
,Bob__Dole,2010-09-04T03:51Z,"Sexygirlrocks,

If you download new movies, especially those not yet released or recently so in box offices, you are far more likely to be logged and have an infringement letter sent to your ISP, because when a movie is new there is the perception that it more directly takes away from revenue.

What should you be watching for?  Get some IP blocking set up, if you have to block even half the internet it's better than being cut off by your ISP so it is a 100% block, and consider waiting to d/l, if a movie is really good it is not any worse when it is 2 years old than the day it was released.

... or, just buy it or pay at the theater already, some things are not worth the hassle.  Multiple letters from your ISP should warn you that you are on their watch list.

... or, you might just be a shill/fake/disingenuous person spreading FUD.

You require a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to hide your activities from your ISP. Google search some are free; but have limits."
,n00bl3z,2010-10-12T22:43Z,"You guys didn't know to use a vpn?  I use a vpn all the time, for everything...

Some free VPN's are UltraVPN, PacketiX, CyberGhostVPN."

Video and Audio decent dvdrip quality. (I'd like 6ch Audio though).

I don't see what all the fuzz about this movie is really.. Kinda all too Tim Burton."
,Luzzu,2010-12-25T18:04Z,"2/10. Don't believe the hype, it is a really bad movie, the Burton/Depp hype made it way more money than it deserved."
