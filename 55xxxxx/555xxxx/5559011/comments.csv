,sam_hig05,2010-05-30T23:17Z,Torrent good  but the software is not good. I tried it and wasn't able to pick up a simple txt file I had just deleted from my usb key. Other application picked it up right away.
,Takster,2010-06-08T09:47Z,"Fuck I just accidentally deleted 28GB's worth of shit and this app is currently saving my ass.

sam_hig05 It's got me fucked how you lose a simple text file when I have 90,000 files being recovered right now. Was your hard drive made this century? "
,DS_Master,2010-06-22T17:10Z,Thanks for this man
,Nadir1702,2010-06-22T18:05Z,"Takster, what ya think of 285GB, 216500 files??

Hope it'll work... :s"
,Blackworm,2010-07-02T08:11Z,"Same as v4.4.x :

I get a 'Divide by Zero' error as soon as the program finishes the search.

I can't click on the left side for file type selection and the 'Save Files' button is greyed out.

Less than a minute later, the program just closes, No error message. "
