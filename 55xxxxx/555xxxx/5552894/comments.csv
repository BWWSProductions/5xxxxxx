Anyway, hopefully you're happy now, reunited as you are with your wife of 50+ years once more, and rid of your good-for-nothing disgusting progeny who apparently couldn't even wait for you to pass away before beginning to fight over your priceless paintings, even stooping to stealing them from you.

Sickening to see how avaricious talentless kin can be, and I really do wish you'd bequeathed all your art to a public museum before passing away, so that we who truly appreciate it could get to view it whenever we pleased, rather than have it disappear overnight into some private collector's collection, never to be seen again."
