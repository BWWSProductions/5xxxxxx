To commiserate the passing of Frank Frazetta, who died of a stroke on May 10, 2010, here is Icon: A Retrospective by the Grand Master of Fantastic Art.

The incredible paintings of Frank Frazetta have brought him worldwide fame, legions of loyal fans, and scores of imitators. His darkly dramatic Conan the Barbarian oils and the equally powerful and erotic compositions for the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs have become the ultimate standards of excellence in the fantasy and adventure field. Icon was Franzettaâ€™s first major retrospective in his 55-year career and showcases over 65 major finished oil paintings, 25 drawings, and other pieces. 

Due to nudity this torrent comes with an ADULT rating.
