I just thought id put the game with the fix so im not gonna take any credit for it.... just please seed cause the torrent's been dying recently cause i have an upload limit of only 60kb/s... that wont matter if more ppl seed...

Nothing happens to the save game if u fix it in the middle.... i did it and it worked fine although it would get stuck once in a while.... id just start again from my previous save point then....
