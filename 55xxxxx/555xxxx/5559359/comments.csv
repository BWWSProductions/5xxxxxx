,lukethebody,2010-05-23T01:50Z,"Thanks talha4, once and for all this is Mcafee 2010 although it does expire in July so if your after short term protection this is fine but if you need something longer look elsewhere. If your reading this and you know of a longer term Mcafee please post the location here, thanks."
,lukethebody,2010-05-23T02:14Z,"Sorry, only just read HACKERX01101's comment and he is right, just activate under another email address and BINGO another full year of protection. Thanks again to talha4 and to HACKERX01101 for the heads up !!!"

  Look tards. McAfee 2010 is the only one that works with Win7. This is NOT 2010.

,agtait001,2010-05-31T06:52Z,"Hey there and thanks for the torent.  I Downloaded quickly and installed.  However, i get 2 weeks product use before i need to activate.  When i click on the ""activate"" link, the ""activating your product online"" box pops up for a few seconds then disapears and nothing happens.  This happens when i am plugged in to the network and over the wireless too.  Any help please?"
,sharnikin,2010-06-01T02:16Z,Same thing happens to me. I click on activate and it pops up for like a second or 2 then goes away. I have repeated the process several times to no avail. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate x64. Any idea what's wrong?
,tijmen31,2010-06-06T15:09Z,"Just downloaded, 500 kb/s. installing now will update if it works."
,tijmen31,2010-06-06T15:17Z,"Oke sucessfully downloaded, sucessfully installed now the problems show. When I click the activate button it will show the activation screen for 2 seconds and then dissapear. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate just like Sharnakin. Any suggestions?"
,LifeLifeLife,2010-06-08T04:17Z,"For Windows 7 Users:

When installing make sure to tick the box to download the ""updated"" installer. Otherwise McAfee will install with what is in this download (the 2009 version)

After downloading you will be greeted with the 2010 version...

...simply choose activate and type in a phony name / email address and you are good for 1 year!"
,rockstargd,2010-06-08T16:11Z,u ass hole dont lie man just say the truth
,agtait001,2010-06-12T02:44Z,"hey LifeLifeLife,  i dont think any of us get an option any where in the install process of selecting 'updated' installer...

I have tried the install process again, paying more attention to try and find it, with no luck.

Hey talha4 - any feedback please>?"
,agtait001,2010-06-28T23:12Z,To other users - dont download - update function doesnt work and you will only get 14 days of coverage.  
,mangochik1,2010-07-23T01:02Z,Has anyone had any issues with this particular one? The comments are showing up as single letters...confused.
,Sjaak3D,2010-08-25T17:23Z,"Although the torrent name says differently, this is the 2010 version and works perfectly with my old Mcafee sing-in. Thank you!!!!!!!!"
,Sjaak3D,2010-08-25T17:24Z,"Although the torrent name says differently, this is the 2010 version and works perfectly with my old Mcafee login. Protection for a year.
Thank you!!"
,Sjaak3D,2010-08-25T17:27Z,Thanks!!
,Hellboy12,2010-08-26T02:31Z,"for god sake, it's easy enough to understand you morons.  download it, install it. when asked, select update NOT install from CD. Use a unique email address and bingo.  Version 2010 for one year. when it runs out, repeat the process with a new email address and you have another free year with the latest version. idiots"

And BTW talha4...quit getting your friends to write good reviews for you. This Does NOT work. Don't waste your time. Find someone else for your sake. 
,DarkWhispers1231,2011-12-07T14:54Z,Do NOT download. I feel like I just downloaded something that will either give or take from my computer. Talha4...stop getting your friends to write good reviews for you. This does NOT work and should be avoided at ALL costs.
