"THE TAXMAN COMETH" 

Detectives Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) and Kevin 
Bernard (Anthony Anderson) are called in to 
investigate the death of a young heiress, 
Annie Douglas (guest star Morgan Lynch), who 
died of an apparent drug overdose. The 
detectives begin to suspect her cousin, Randy 
(guest star Daniel Abeles), whose inheritance 
was increased due to Annie's death. As the 
investigation continues, Annie's greedy 
relatives reveal another recent loss in the 
group. The case becomes more than a family 
matter as an experimental cancer clinic, 
fraudulent adoptions and unborn children are 
tied into the case.

Enjoy :)
