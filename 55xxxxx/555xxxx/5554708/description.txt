This is Frontline's coverage of the Waco Massacre. 

I noticed that this video seems to no longer be availble either via torrent or from PBS. I had a copy so here it is.

Sorry, but the video is in 6 segments, I tried to join them into 1 but the audio got out of sync (VBR) and I don't have time to fix it (It's OK in each segment though).

Here's the link to the show (you can get transcripts there too): www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/
