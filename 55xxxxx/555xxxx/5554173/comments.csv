,bitoolean,2011-08-29T02:25Z,"next time please include year of the movie in the torrent's title, because it makes any movie easier to find using search and making sure it is what one's looking for.

also, just include the imdb.com link / id instead of pasting information we can find on our own!

fill the description with more useful content such as the encoding parameters, video file resolution, codec used, source quality.

thank you for sharing!"
