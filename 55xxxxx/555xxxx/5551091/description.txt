        Freema Agyeman narrates a series focusing on the most        
        extraordinary and eye-watering cases to come through the     
        doors of a British A&E department. Featuring a driver run    
        over by the breakdown man sent to repair his car; a          
        schoolgirl injured playing Wii tennis; and a man whose       
        testicles required treatment after being squashed in a       
        motorbike crash. Plus, how surgeons rebuilt a sailor's       
        shattered skull by peeling off his face.
