Malcolm Palmer is a lyrical genius, definitely one of my favorite artists! His lyrics can be very politically challenging and potent. If your interested in artists like Michael Franti or Wookiefoot, you should def check him out. This is the full album at 320kbps! If you like this album please buy it online, Malcolm Palmer is still very underground, and though I want to share his music with you, he could really use the money!
