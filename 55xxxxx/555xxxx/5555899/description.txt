Hi guys - Physics playground for android - Pirate edition :) 
http://www.androidzoom.com/android_games/casual/physics-playground_fhvd.html

If you like it, buy it!
I mean it, I'm the developer :)
If you *really* dont want to spend the Â£1 - an e-mail saying thanks or with some bugs would be great!

(In case anyone wonders, pirate edition just means it has pirate graphics...)
