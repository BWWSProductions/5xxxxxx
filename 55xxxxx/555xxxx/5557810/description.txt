The Ren & Stimpy Show UNCUT

The First and Second Seasons

Disk 1
Season 1
Episode 6



Black Hole-
It's another warped day for Commander HÃ¶ek and Cadet Stimpy as they fly into a mind-bending black hole, mutate continuously, and discover a mountain of missing left socks.

Stimpy's Invention-
Stimpy invents a Happy Helmet so that his foaming friend Ren can be happy all the time. But it pushes Ren way past happiness and into utter insanity - and the nonstop "Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy" song doesn't help either!
