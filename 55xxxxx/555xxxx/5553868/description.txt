My new ultimate collection of chillout/electronic music, Vol.2


All songs may not please everyone but I tried to vary the styles and I like them, especially while driving...
Enjoy ! That's for you. I didn't want to keep them for myself.

By the way, my previous torrent contains another selection of similar music:

Don't forget to seed, please.
