Teddy "Red" Herring will stop at nothing to halt a global conspiracy of invading aliens and big businessmen. And he's convinced the MacGuffin's near-death experience and dirty little secret affair with a U.S. congressman is the key to his revenge. There are no coincidences. Nothing happens by accident.
