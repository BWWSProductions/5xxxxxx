Founded in 1498, more than half a millennium ago, the Wiener SÃ¤ngerknaben
is still the most wellknown boychoir in the world.Until 1918, the choir sang 
exclusively for the court, at mass, at private concerts and functions and on state occasions. 
Today there are around 100 choristers between the ages of ten and fourteen, 
divided into four touring choirs. The four choirs give around 300 concerts and performances each year in front of almost half a million people. Each group spends nine to eleven weeks of the school year on tour. They visit virtually all European countries, and they are frequent guests in Asia, Australia and the Americas.
