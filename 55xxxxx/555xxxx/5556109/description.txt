        The police investigate when the body of a missing boy,       
        11-year-old Matty Wallace, is found in local woodland. His   
        stressed mother Jane claims she did not realise Matty was    
        missing until she went to his school, while his stepfather   
        tells officers he was working away for several days and knew 
        nothing of Matty's disappearance. The team discover that     
        Matty had planned to run away with a friend, but did not     
        make it. As they dig deeper and the postmortem results come  
        in, the officers begin to suspect that Jane may hold the key 
        to her son's death.
