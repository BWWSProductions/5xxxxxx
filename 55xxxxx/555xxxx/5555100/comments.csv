,fendermental,2010-05-12T17:21Z,"Hello Night,
This is one of the few RLB's that I didn't have, so absolutely rapped to get this one. 
Is this one of your rips because all the versions that I can find have the follow track listings?

1. Hard Time Killin' Floor Blues
2. Got Messed Up
3. Miss Maybelle	Listen
4. Wish I Was in Heaven Sitting Down
5. Too Many Ups	
6. Nothin' Man
7. See What My Buddy Done
8. My Eyes (Keep Me in Trouble)
9. Bad Luck City
10. Chain of Fools
11. R.L.'s Story

It seems there are 3 tracks from other albums , so 4 tracks on the original CD are missing. Maybe this is a rare version that I don't know about.
When you've sobered up, let me know, but that could be quite some time, I suspect.

Regards, fendermental."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-05-12T19:21Z,"the import version of this has three tracks that are not here

and the three missing tracks are actually from other artistes


no one is forcing you to download this...if you don't like, real simple...go find another download...

...and how's that for your starter for ten?...

get back to me after Fulham have won...then i will be shit-faced"

,nehoc,2011-11-13T18:45Z,"No reason to be ironic, nightissuchproximity , even without bonus tracks (which are not by RL Burnside), this torrent is messed up:

1. The tracks are in alphabetical not in album order
2. Four songs are missing: Too Many Ups and Nothing' Man, See What My Buddy Done, and My Eyes Keep Me In Trouble.
3. Songs from this torrent - Alice Mae, Highway 7, and It's Bad You Know, are NOT on RL Burnside's album I Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down but from his other CDs.

There's 11 RL Burnside's tracks on the original CDs, bot EU and US versions:

1 R.L. Burnside â€“ Hard Time Killing Floor Scratches â€“ DJ Pete B 
2 R.L. Burnside â€“ Got Messed Up
Scratches â€“ DJ Swamp 	
3 R.L. Burnside â€“ Miss Maybelle 
Scratches â€“ DJ Swamp
4 R.L. Burnside â€“ Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down	
5 R.L. Burnside â€“ Too Many Ups
6 R.L. Burnside â€“ Nothin' Man
Loops â€“ Iki Levy
7 R.L. Burnside â€“ See What My Buddy Done
8 R.L. Burnside â€“ My Eyes Keep Me In Trouble

9 R.L. Burnside â€“ Bad Luck City

10 R.L. Burnside â€“ Chain Of Fools 
Loops â€“ Iki Levy
Scratches â€“ DJ Swamp
11 R.L. Burnside â€“ R.L.'s Story
Programmed By â€“ Richard Flack
Scratches â€“ DJ Pete B

Bonus Tracks 
12 Robert Belfour â€“ Black Mattie
13 Paul Jones â€“ Pucker Up Buttercup

And yes, theres no ripping specs (bit rate is 320, btw for those who wanna know but still, even after you correct the track order, one song is missing)."
