Part 3: Ethiopia
The epic river journey brings the actress to Khartoum, where she watches whirling dervishes practising their devotional dancing and experiences a Sudanese beauty treatment that makes use of wood smoke. She then takes a short diversion into Ethiopia's Simien Mountains to meet an unusual group of Olympic hopefuls training in the thin air of the highlands.
