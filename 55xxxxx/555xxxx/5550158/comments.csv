,takalaiton,2010-05-10T18:29Z,".... what to say.. you have nice torrents,  but as i see last few still have 1 seeder... you ? or is it just my mistake ?. 
your last torrents  + 500 gb have 1 or 2 seeders, in last 2 months. lots of ppl waiting ???.
if this is my mistake, im sorry. but if not.... ?"
[T],PeteSapai,2010-07-08T21:24Z,"Dude, your last 8 torrents all are 39 to 106 gb+ and have no seeds. Can you just start seeding them, maybe?nTip: turn on \'Initial Seeding\' for all of those torrents and dont upload any more torrents untill all of those have at least a couple of other seeders.nAlso: dont ever again start seeding 3 enormous torrents in one day (unless, of course, you can upload at 100mbit 24/7)."
,aka_NL,2010-08-25T17:28Z,"Okay dude i gotta ask.
What = your max upload speed and do you ever seed this torrent.
because all down loaders have been stuck at 42.5%
for some time now.
I just wanna know if this download can be finished in my lifetime.
At least get someone in on this torrent as a seeder.
You know 2 seeders are better then none . "

,HIyaalll,2011-06-13T12:45Z,"@dadevil666 . I assume the reason people use other formats than the one YOU want is because THEY have opinion as to what is a good format than you do.

Reasons to use MKV over either AVI, or MP4. It's more flexible. Main advantages: 

 1. Possibilty of NON burnt in (yet embedded) subtitles!!!!!!!!! (that's a big one if you ask me)
 2. Support for multitrack. Which means you can embedd subs or audio for several different 
languages.

There are other advantages aswell, but for the ""generic user"" these is the ones he'll notice. Install a recent K-Lite codec-pack.. and never ever ever use windows media player.. it is constructed to download viruses (it's almost impossible to turn off ALL functions which makes it download programs from remote servers just because the person who coded the film embedded such a function)"
,HIyaalll,2011-06-13T12:46Z,*..is because THEY have *another* opinion..
,JBaughb,2011-08-24T13:09Z,"96.7% for the past few months. Come on, someone, please seed. It wont take much for some of us to get complete and we will help out. "
,LORD_DARKON,2011-12-04T20:47Z,Please seed. I'm stuck on 99.9% for three days now...
