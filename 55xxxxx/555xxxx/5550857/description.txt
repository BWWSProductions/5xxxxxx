Genesis Live â€“ The Mama Tour--filmed in 1984 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham
The material was shot on film and edited on videotape, and the raw film footage cannot be found, so all that is available to work from is the videotape master. Video quality is no better than the VHS release. Fortunately, it appears that the concert is being presented complete or near-complete, and you get an excellent 5.1 surround sound remix. There is a bonus of 79 minutes of home camcorder footage shot by Phil Collins during sessions for the group's 1983 "Genesis" album.
