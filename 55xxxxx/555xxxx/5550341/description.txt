Neverender: An earthborn boxer takes to the stars in a derelict Sputnik-esque satellite. He must travel to the edge of mapped space to fight a master swordsman so he can procure the fight money to save his dying town. The Coyote Cosmonaut is forced to do battle with a dying swordsman, once known as Omega. 

Paradise (Five Issues):Sebastian, a brilliant botanist, has been sentenced to the library of congress for his crimes against humanity. In searching for a way to avoid dying, he senselessly murdered thousands and thousands of people. During his exile, he imbibes every scrap of information man has ever accumulated, and before long, he is set free to seek his revenge on the world.  Meanwhile, elsewhere, a man who never dies is unwittingly put on a collision course with the mad doctor. Welcome to Paradise.

Devil and Dr. John: 
A Faustian bargain between the last living soul and the devil must be struck if life as we've known it is to continue. In a world where singularity has made every soul indifferent from his fellow man, the last living anomaly tries to reason with mankind's oldest foe.

Thanks for downloading and reading these comics. I strongly believe in the internet community as a means of digital distribution, and while somewhere down the road I'd love to get paid for my art, I'd much rather have it be read and enjoyed.
