Health's new CD, Disco2

The members of Los Angeles noise outfit Health have a comfortable system going: Make an album, then tap esteemed artists and producers to remix every song on the LP. It's proven to be an excellent way to spotlight the band's affinity for intricate synths and dance rhythms. In 2008, Health released Disco, a remix album of their self-titled debut; its successor, Disco2, is a remix album of 2009's Get Color. Disco2 features remixes from Gold Panda, Crystal Castles, Javelin, CFCF and others, plus new track "USA Boys," a spacey, fidgety number that's right at home among the remixes.
