Daughtry is the debut album of the American rock band of the same name, the band formed and fronted by American Idol season five finalist Chris Daughtry.a[â€º] The album is the fastest selling debut rock album in Soundscan history.


Critical response to Daughtry was mixed; while many critics felt that the album was generally pleasing and the first real "rock" album from American Idol alumni, others felt it was unoriginal and too commercial. While Ken Barnes of USA Today conceded that Chris Daughtry has "strong pipes and palpable angst", overall he found the band "generic", calling them "FuelNickelStaindback".b[â€º][2] People magazine found the album "a solid if not spectacular effort that at the very least proves that [Chris Daughtry] is not just another Idol also-ran."[3] Christian Hoard (with Rolling Stone) said that "[Chris] Daughtry gets points for not courting soccer moms, but just because he can howl like a mother fucker doesn't mean he's not a cheeseball."[4] In a truly mixed review, Billboard said the album "is music tailor-made for ill-conceived radio formatting, music for consumers whose taste has already been well-established if not preprogrammed," then added, "But [Chris] Daughtry sure does sing his butt off."[5] Allmusic broke from the pack, so to speak, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling the album a "a debut that's not only a lot more credible than any American Idol-affiliated rock album should be, but it's a lot easier to digest than most of its [post-grunge] ilk."[6] In a humorous review, comedian Stephen Colbert found Chris Daughtry's success further proof of the impending "cultural Armageddon." He remarked, "It's bad enough this guy sounds like Creed...but Daughtry's success sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding losers...America elected Taylor Hicks as its Idol, and we owe him our loyalty."[7]
