[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-11T20:24Z,"Thanks :) I got this one done finally.  Been meaning to do this one for ages.  Here comes Part 15 next!!!  Next letter is M, it will be a biggy.  Might take a fair bit of hard work, artists are usually big in the M section.  For example one of the next ones coming will be Magma.  

I have to apologise to anybody who notices but the band Liquid Trio Experiment is actually not a Rock band but a Metal band instead.  It is Progressive Metal, it's the same band as Liquid Tension Experiment but without the guitarist John Petrucci.  Just with Keyboards, Bass and Drums but I think it's a very good album so I've added that one also.

The band Little Tragedies is a Russian band, I have to make sure I translated the song names from Russian otherwise it would have looked confusing lol"
