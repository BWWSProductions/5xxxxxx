Firstly
The dvd folder structure is wrong so you cannot play the dvd file, because the VIDEO_TS folder is a subfolder under DISTRICT9.2009.NORDIC..... as the name sof this upload says. Solution: you must first copy the VIDEO_TS folder to your harddrive.

Secondly
The movie starts from the beginning again after vieving the first 38 secs. 

Thirdly
PgcEdit discovers wrong number of VOB IDs which it claims is a known bug when reauthored in DVDshrink. So this must be fixed first

Fourthly
There are extra footage behind the scenes and such, which I really appreciate. But since there is no menu at all then you cannot access them

So with these four flaws I dunno about ""quality DVD upload""  ;) But I thank you for your effort and hope your other uploads do not have the same flaws"

,AlwaysQuality,2010-06-21T22:21Z,"Ive checked out your problems.

I does start again after 30 sec. It does it at the same time reference everytime. Just rewind over the time reference and you are fine. Or flip back and forth throughn the first 2 chapters and it runs fine. 

Sadly is a fault in my rip from original and i don't have the original anymore."
,AlwaysQuality,2010-06-21T22:43Z,"Of course you can acces the extras. They start after the film. Use your remote, mate if you don't wanna wait through the film. That's why it came with your player man.  

Don't listen to the comments upstairs except regarding the restart after 30 sec. My bad."
,Harley_DK,2010-12-20T04:36Z,"What a piece of junk, incorrect created DVD, no menu and everything packed in tiny RAR packs.
F*****G dumbass, learn to make a proper DVD before you release it
And yes, I have seen other releases from you, same crap"
,supergogo,2011-02-24T23:52Z,"It is untouched, is PAL (smoother framerate no need for 2/3 pulldown) and DTS! too bad it is a lemon!"
