official rel. 20 may ?10

You have made the cut to join a group of elite drivers chosen
to participate in the global broadcast event known as?
Split/Second. Racing through a city created specifically for
destruction, your goal is to become the season champ where fame,
fortune and glory await. But first, you must survive a grueling
24-episode season of races in a variety of explosive locations
to crush the competition and become the champion. When speed
is not enough, the city is your weapon."

,sunbleached,2010-05-14T18:24Z,"I really regretted d/L and wasting a disk on this game. Completely unoriginal, boring, and repetitive. Just fast driving punctuated by cutscenes of big explosions. And to top it off, if you or any other car gets destroyed, they respawn inexplicably and keep racing. Stupid.... "
