,vivatpb5776,2011-06-26T04:24Z,"I only downloaded ""American...Paris."" Poor encoding. The movie is heavily pixelated with black bars on each side of the movie. The screen resolution is 640*360. I agree with Enemy_Hero. This appears to be made for viewing on a mobile device, not on a monitor or streamed to a television."
