PLOT:


When a freak accident wipes out an entire royal family, an exhaustive search reveals a distant relation: Ralph Jones (John Goodman), a good-natured, down-to-earth Las Vegas entertainer. Immediately, the rude and crude Ralph is given a crash course in royal manners by his new private secretary, the very proper Lord Willingham (Peter O'Toole). But while Ralph's uncouth behavior delights the public,it fuels a fiendish plot by the evil Lord Graves (John Hurt), who's out to oust the new ruler. Now, it's up to this lowborn lounge singer to redeem himself in a manner befitting a king in this warmhearted comedy romp.


TAGLINE:


When Ralph becomes royalty, laughter reigns!    A comedy of majestic proportions.     A great tragedy has befallen the royal family leaving only one heir to the throne...
