From the IMDB content advisory for parents

""The film is similar to that of a softcore porn. A fairly lengthy swimming scene with three topless women. A few lengthy sex scenes, with bare breasts, buttocks, and for a brief second, there is some full frontal female nudity. The whole movie revolves around underground MMA fighting to have sex with the woman who is representing the opponent. THe women are almost portrayed as objects rather than humans. KEEP THE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! ""

Sounds good to me :)"
