        Matt Baker heads to Lacock in Wiltshire to discover why it's 
        a ready-made backdrop for period dramas. It's also the       
        birthplace of photography, making it the ideal place for     
        John Craven to launch the Countryfile Photographic           
        Competition for 2010. Fellow judge Jo Brand proves you don't 
        have to be a hot shot to get good results. Down on the farm, 
        Adam Henson is on tenterhooks as his cattle are re-tested    
        for TB.
