Charles 803 continuous reflux design plans

This is a great still for fuel production, or the person looking to actually start a small craft distillery for neutral spirits. Its capabilities are well documented, and it is a time proven design, Google it if you don't believe me. The boiler is seperate from the distillation column for better heat control.

It is easily setup to be nearly a fully automated still, and can also be easily setup to run on a continuous boiler.

Output rate is up to ~20L/hr @ 96%abv using a 3" column. I can build this still using either a 3" body or 6" body.
