Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



I wanted to share the Cuban music I've collected over the past few years, and some of it is quite rare. All files have proper ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags and include the CD cover art. No guarantees on perfect spelling, especially with capitalization or special characters (e.g. Ã¡, Ã©, Ã±, etc.).

Most are not available online already, and the few that are already posted are in a different format. If you want a higher bit rate or format, the original CD's can be purchased online. Where I purchased most of mine was at  http://www.timbuktunes.com. They are a GREAT store and they will ship anywhere.

The collection is quite large, so I will be uploading them in 12 separate torrents. The majority are Cuban-related, but there are some other Latin-based selections from Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Panama and Puerto Rico. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I do.
