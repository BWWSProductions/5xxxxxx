Tecmo's Deception PSX game image for use with emulators or CCD.  Works great on ePSXe and no XA audio bugs. Should work on other emulators too.

Plot: You start the game as the prince of Zemekia. When you go to visit King Zemeris to discuss your wedding plans for your marriage to princess Fiana, He decides to retire as king.  This act infuriates the evil magician Zamur who slays the king with your sword.  Everyone, including your jealous brother is fooled by Zamur.  He has you burned at the stake, but your ghost is saved by the dark spirit Astarte.  she invites you to enter an unholy covenant with the devil to guard the castle of the damned and aid his resurrection.  As the game progresses, certain new characters come into play.  In the end, you can make the ultimate decision of whether or not to resurrect the devil. This choice adds to the game's re-playability.  

This game is ancient in terms of video games but it is still one of my favorites. The graphics are considerably good for a PlayStation game.  I love old PSX games so please upload if you have them.  I am new at this so tell me politely if it doesn't work so I can fix it.

Please upload Kagero deception 2 if you have it.

Enjoy the game but don't hit and run. SEED:)
