"Water" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Brad Paisley. It is the fourth single from his 2009 studio album American Saturday Night. The song first charted in 2009 as an album cut before its release to radio.

In "Water," the narrator lists off various situations involving water: playing in a kiddie pool as a child, jumping from a rope swing with friends on a riverbank, and later wet t-shirt contests on spring break and skinny dipping with a girlfriend. He describes each situation as beginning a "love affair with water."

"Water" first charted in 2009 from unsolicited airplay received after its release, bringing it to #55 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. It also reached #9 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.

Upon its release as a single, the song re-entered the country singles charts at #48 on the chart dated for the week ending March 27, 2010. and at #36 on the Canadian Radio & Records Country Singles charts for the week of April 8, 2010. and at #100 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts for the week of April 30, 2010.
