,LJE111,2011-07-04T03:46Z,Yes the quality is pretty bad but watchable -- can't really make out the titles but I highly recommend it regardless. It's one of the best docu's I have seen on this subject. I ordered the DVD as a gift to my sis in England. It's only about $25 w shipping and I will no doubt order one for myself - it's THAT good!!!
