,Bonds007,2010-06-29T09:11Z,Does this works???
,paul_1980,2010-06-30T00:29Z,I have tried the last two methods but none seem to work. it wont let me add to my flash drive (san disk cruzer formatted to wbfs) it dosn't even recognize it! I tried to the 3rd method and the usb loader tells me that there is no wbfs. format! I am a noob but I follow shit to a tee and cant figure this shit out any help would be greatly appreciated...maybe if you could re-upload this in an ISO. file would be great!THANX
[V],r3dcat,2010-07-02T10:59Z,"@paul_1980: Regarding method 2 I recommend you try reformatting the WBFS partition on your flash drive using Wii Backup Manager and try again. If you can see the flash drive in windows then there is no reason for Wii Backup Manager not seeing it other than it doesn't like the partition (as far as I am aware).
Regarding method 3 I recommend you look over the info provided in the forum thread ->  http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638  and if you have any further questions as there. You will get friendly and quick response/help there."

[V],r3dcat,2010-07-03T05:00Z,@Bonds007: You need to have a closer look at your setup. Without more information from you I can not make any other suggestions. But I can assure you this work just fine for me with Configurable USB Loader v57b7; 4.2E; Hermes cIOS 222 v4 38 merged 37
,jbeavis100,2011-05-31T03:07Z,Hey is there any chance you find a NTSC or PAL Copy of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles - The Crystal Bearers? I can't find any torrents for that game and I really want it and i'm far from rich.
,Vedarshi,2011-09-22T05:22Z,Thank you sooo much for this r3dcat!! I was looking for this game but all were iso's. I wanted around a 1GB size and you gave it. Thank you!
,Keithuk,2012-02-10T19:34Z,It works for me on my 4.3E with USB Loader GX but I converted the wbfs to iso with Wii Game Converter GXS and used WBFS Manager to load it on the drive.
