About this game:
Link, a young man raised as a wrangler in a small, rural village, is ordered by the mayor to attend the Hyrule Summit. He sets off, oblivious to the dark fate that has descended upon the kingdom. When he enters the Twilight Realm that has covered Hyrule, he transforms into a wolf and is captured. A mysterious figure named Midna helps him break free, and with the aid of her magic, they set off to free the land from the shadows. Link must explore the vast land of Hyrule and uncover the mystery behind its plunge into darkness. For Nintendo's long-awaited Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the designers have split the game into two versions -- one for GameCube, and one specially designed to make use of the Wii utilizing the powers of the Wii controller for all-new ways of exploring Hyrule.
