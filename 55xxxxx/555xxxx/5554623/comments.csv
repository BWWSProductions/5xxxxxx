,doxyerfre,2010-08-14T21:58Z,"Hey, some advice, next time you upload something, don't pack it all into a rar file. Some people would like to download what they want  and leave what they don't want (since it is such a big file). It makes things a lot easier. Thanks"
,matter0ni,2010-10-22T07:39Z,this is probably the most important torrent in the world. thank you for making it available for us. i will ABSOLUTELY seed this indefinitely for as long as i live and am able to.
,Peter131313,2010-12-29T21:27Z,I'm seedig at 1024 kbps; my provider won't allow higher GRRR... ;-)
,Peter131313,2010-12-29T21:30Z,I'm SEEDING at 1024 kbps! 
,Lithiumn,2011-01-02T07:09Z,"Will seed whenever I'm available. Leave your download on at night, that's when I'll be running my client most often.  Max upload set to unlimited, Should add at the very least 200kbps to your download once I'm finished. Give me a day or so to complete the download myself."
,frconspi,2011-01-03T05:31Z,"Thanks for the upload but it would have been much much better if it's not in a .rar file... With a .rar you need to download the whole 100% before to use a single piece of it and if you're stuck at 99.9% or something they're wasted :(
I hope I'll be able to complete it though and I will seed it back for sure ;)"
,Shabutie,2011-03-01T06:41Z,"Please seed this so I can download it, after that, I'll try to seed as long as possible.

This is probably the most important bit of information in regards to the advancement of the human species, and life in general. "
,Unisexpect,2011-04-14T04:30Z,I will never stop seeding this!
,Granoturko,2011-05-16T18:59Z,This torrent is a must-have and will be sure to aid us when we make the great leap forward and become trans-dimensional beings. I will seed this forever 
,uniquefrk,2011-05-28T05:38Z,"This is probably the most complete audio resource, though most of it (someone tell me WHY) is in the fucking annoying MP4 format. It's a long process to convert all of these files to mp3 and retag them all, so that I can put them on my portable mp3 player. 
Also, the video part is far from complete and again most of it in stupid formats. I'd previously downloaded another Terrence torrent, which had a very nice video collection, including one full documentary movie that was all Terrence, talking with other people and stuff, which was very nice. When I finished downloading this, I accidentally deleted the other one before comparing the two so I don't have all those videos that I had before. I checked TPB and it doesn't look like that torrent is here anymore..."
