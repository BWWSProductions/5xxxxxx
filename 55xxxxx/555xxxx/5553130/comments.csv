,kablitz,2010-06-14T13:41Z,there's no hard-coded subtitles and i can't see an srt file. where can i get the subtitles?
,franxo,2010-09-08T15:03Z,"@kablitz this is a matroska file, the subtitles are inside of the file. Select the subtitles in your media player software, in VLC for example the option is in video menu. Sorry for my bad english."
,halfulaij,2010-11-30T20:17Z,"I downloaded the file, used VLC and I still can't access the sub titles. Please help. Are you sure they are in there? I even tried Media player classic with the same result"

The subs seem to be missing. They are not showing up in VLC. These sync nicely: http://subscene.com/english/Summer-Wars-Sam-wzu/subtitle-311607.aspx"

Thanks for the link! I've had this downloaded months ago... now I can watch it! with english subtitles."
,nivrex,2011-01-09T06:22Z,Thanks for the upload. Great seeds too. Thank you also for the subtitles that sync nicely. thumbs up! 
,Super.sonic.jellyfish,2011-01-16T18:09Z,I DLed the subs by Johnny but I cannot get them to work with the vid.  I'm not able to select subtitles under the video tab because it's grayed out and every time I try to open the new sub file it closes the actual video.  Any tips?
,omegazion,2011-02-23T02:40Z,"@Above: You must rename the srt file to the same filename as the mkv file, except the extensions. i.e. Summer.Wars.2009.x264.AC3-WAF.srt"
