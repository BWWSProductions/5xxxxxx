,zocam24,2010-05-14T03:20Z,Does anyone know where to find the first ep of season 2? Would be much appreciated! Thanks!
,angel727,2010-05-15T20:32Z,Same question: still looking for episode 1...anyone?
,dlectro,2010-05-20T13:10Z,"I couldn't post a link, but there's an Episode 1 on filespump, search ""The City S02E01"" and look for a file at 138.73MB. It's a bit (even) lower quality."
,zocam24,2010-05-21T00:59Z,"dlectro - thanks for the info, but the link you provided is to a pay site. When I pay to watch this it will be buying the box set when it (finally) comes out in my country, but in the meantime why pay premium rates for a sub-par copy? Doesn't make any sense!"
,angel727,2010-05-21T03:39Z,finally found it!
,angel727,2010-05-21T03:41Z,"zocam, i was able to find the file and download it just fine without paying for anything.  the link re-directs you to another site, where you have the option of paying for a premium account OR you can click on the free download option and it just makes you wait a few seconds before you are allowed to download the file."
,dlectro,2010-05-21T14:53Z,"@zocam24: I provided no link, and no pay site, You don't make any sense.

@angel727: thanks for spreading the word, and taking credit..."
,zocam24,2010-05-22T05:16Z,My bad!! I obviously clicked on the wrong link and it was re-directing me elsewhere and trying to make me sign up and pay. My apologies - and thanks to dlectro - I have just tried again and download works great. Thank-you again!
