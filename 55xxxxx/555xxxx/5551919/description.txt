The Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op.  67, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1804â€“08. This symphony  is one of the most popular and best-known compositions in all of classical music, and one of the most often played symphonies.  It comprises four movements: an opening sonata, an andante, and a fast scherzo which leads attacca to the finale. First performed in Vienna's Theater an der Wien in 1808, the work achieved its prodigious reputation soon afterwards. E. T. A. Hoffmann described the symphony as "one of the most important works of the time".
