But seriously - If you did not take the time time to type [img] before pasting '[img]http://img6.immage.de/1205fcb968image24425265.jpg[/img] and not typing [/img] after pasting then your screenshots would display w/ one simple click!! Perhaps just pasting would reduce the need of ""Screens are posted for this file,how-ever some sites do not allow all picture hosts(and i do not have time upload pics to a certain host for a specific site)."" comment. Also - I f-ing hate the Dodgers. Wondering if my ""Thank You"" will still work its MAGIC!!!!
