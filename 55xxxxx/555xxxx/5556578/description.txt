~This is a repacked compilation of the Far Cry 2 torrent by Razor1911, the 1.03 

patch from Ubisoft.com, and the Far Cry 2 Fortune's Pack Expansion (xPac) by an 

unknown uploader, also included is a known working Promo Code that can be used to 

unlock the "bonus content" that was awarded to those who pre-ordered the game from 

Game Stop.



~I take no credit for the original torrents, The game torrent is a genuine 

Razor1911 release, but the xPac torrent I do not know.



~I have played through the game both with, and without xPac and bonus content, and 

can say this game and additional content are fully working and "cracked", so no 

serial key is needed.



~The xPac "Fortune's Pack" includes 3 new weapons, 2 new vehicles, and 5 new 

multiplayer maps, while the "Promotional Content" consists of about 3 more hours 

of play via new missions.



~I doubt online multiplayer is available, however there is a "LAN" option that 

may or may not be functional.


~Installation and patching information can be found in Anon1911-FC2-readme.txt.


~Enjoy!
