"Welcome to the Museum of Everything; feel free to wander round our many galleries and experience the history of everything. 
Children are welcome, but please keep them in the bags provided." 

The critically acclaimed comedy sketch show written and performed by Danny Robins, Dan Tetsell and Marcus Brigstocke - the team behind BBC 2's We Are History. Based on their successful Edinburgh Festival show, it's a sketch show in disguise; themed around the world of museums, galleries, guided tours, stately homes, historical re-enactors and obsessive collectors and set in the vaguely mystical and apparently infinite environs of
The Museum of Everything. 

"The exhibit on superstitions in on the 13th floor" 


Our guides are a pair of long-suffering underpaid West Country museum attendants, who pop up to remind us of museum rules, announce forthcoming attractions and reassure us that it's never far to the promised land of the gift shop, where you can buy leather bookmarks, novelty pencil sharpeners and fudge in the shape of Jane Austen.
