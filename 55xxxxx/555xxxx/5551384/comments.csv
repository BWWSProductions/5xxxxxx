Probably you're confusing this torrent with my other avast torrents. This crack is for avast 5.0.545, which can be downloaded from their website. No need to be so lazy to configure the new installed version, cause there are just a few settings."

Thanks for your great work with uploading these safe and clean computer protection programs, but I just have one question, which computer security software do you use, if you don't use your own releases?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-11T22:53Z,"Download link for:

- avast! Internet Security 5.0.545 (Multilingual, 32-64 bit, Incl. firewall)
- avast! Pro Antivirus 5.0.545 (Multilingual, 32-64 bit, No firewall incl.)

Thanks for reporting. However, be prepared to meet a lot of more false positives on TPB, especially when using my torrents. Try Sandboxie also to check if things are clean."

[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-25T17:37Z,"@liam16 

Do you have any idea what to do with the included Readme.txt file and Install notes!.txt file? If not, then try reading them."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-29T17:30Z,"@liam16 

Remember that an av program which cannot be updated is useless. And if it contains a crack then usually it can be updated, but normally that's only for av software."
,RigiRulz,2010-06-08T19:36Z,"Heya. I downloaded this, went through the instructions, found a problem. I unfortunately have Avast installed and the trial ran out. I did my best to remove the progam and all traces of it. If I re-install and use the crack, will it work, or should I try a different version or something?

Thank you in advance for both your time and effort."
,RigiRulz,2010-06-08T19:40Z,"Heya. I downloaded this and went through the instructions, found a problem. I already have an expired trial of Avast. I did my best to remove it. Will re-installing while following the instructions work? Or should I just look for a different version?

Thanks in advance for both your time and effort.

And also I think I double posted, sorry if I did, this is the first comment I've tried to leave on TPB"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-10T01:59Z,"@RigiRulz

Just uninstall the previous version first."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-12T01:17Z,"@Prince_Dastan 

So you're letting us know that you're a n00b? Well, thnx anyway ......"
,RigiRulz,2010-06-13T14:42Z,"@ RobbingHood

Mate, it ain't a previous version, its this version, 5.0.545

Meh, forget it, I'll just look for a different version, but thanks anyway :)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-14T20:49Z,"@RigiRulz

What's the problem with uninstalling the current installed avast version first? 
You may try this without removing an already installed (and expired) avast 5.0.545:

1. At Settings -> Troubleshooting: Uncheck ""Enable avast! self-defense module"". 

2- Remove the avast license stored at:
   C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Alwil Software\Avast5\license.lic

3. Copy the included cracked ashBase.dll from the crack folder into the install directory of avast
   (replacing the original ashBase.dll)

3. Reboot the computer, and run avast.

4. Activate avast by clicking on ""Activate"" to download a trial license.
   (Or go to Maintenance -> Subscription -> Activate trial period. 

5. The ""avast! self-defense module"" can now be enabled again.


BTW: This is the latest version, and as far as I know there's no other crack at the moment."
,deba.debo,2010-06-24T11:09Z,Robbinhood try to build the crack in such a way that its Virus definitions can be updated ur crack file is already blacklisted no Virus definitions are cannot be updated............
