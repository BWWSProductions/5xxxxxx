nice try!"
,hbk4754,2011-09-23T01:13Z,"Keymakers usually get marked as trojans because they find a back door into the program you are trying to crack. This action is exactly the same as what a trojan virus will do. There is no virus in this download. Antivirus will mark the keymaker as a trojan but just ignore it. So, @mikeh420, why don't you do a little research before you criticize other people."

then i guess every single torrent i ever downloaded with a keygen was a trojan......
do some research"

Please remove this torrent"
