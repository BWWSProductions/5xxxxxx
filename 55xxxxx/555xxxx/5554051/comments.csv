The Frank Frazetta Image Comics Collection is something that I've been working on for a while, but got side-lined by other projects.  With the sad news of Frazetta passing away I thought that it would be a suitable tribute for him, at least in the scanning and torrenting world.

The other Frazetta torrents I had uploaded before at Z-Cult FM before its demise."
