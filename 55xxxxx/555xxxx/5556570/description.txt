Episode 2 - The Guitarist
 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/rocknrollband/

What is the DNA of a great rock 'n' roll band?

The series breaks this mythical beast down into its constituent parts - singer, guitarist, drummer as well as the shadowy 'other one', whose face we don't quite know but without whom the magic wouldn't happen. 

A no-holds-barred look at the talents and foibles of the eternal hero of rock 'n' roll, the guitarist. Windmilling and kerranging from a huge cast of strummers and twangers including Slash, Jeff Beck, Johnny Marr, Pete Townshend, Mick Jones of the Clash, Status Quo and Matt Bellamy of Muse.
