Often cited by critics as one of the greatest films ever made, Kenji Mizoguchiâ€™s mist-shrouded masterpiece Ugetsu is a ghost story & a morality tale that is ever mindful of the frail humanity of its characters. Set in Japan during the tumultuous sixteenth century â€“ when the country was torn apart by civil wars â€“ the film follows what happens to two couples, living the simple life in a small village, who get swept up in the insanity and lose their moorings to reality.
This film won the Silver Lion at the 1953 Venice Film Festival, along with the Italian Critics Award. At home, the prestigious film journal Kinema Jumpo rated it the third best picture of the year.
