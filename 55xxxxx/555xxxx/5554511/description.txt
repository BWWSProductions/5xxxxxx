SYNOPSIS

On the 30th of June 2001, in Copenhagen, Denmark, a framework was formed for a 
historical football match; a match which FIFA and the Chinese government tried 
to prevent from taking place. The agreed upon match between Tibet and Greenland, 
would be the first international game ever played by Tibet. 

The Forbidden Team is an exceptional story about a group of enthusiastic Danish 
and Tibetan souls that share a common dream of forming a national football team 
composed of exiled Tibetans.  

We follow the team from their first coaching sessions in Dharamsala, India - on 
a craggy, grassless pitch - to the last whistle in Copenhagen two years later.

In the film, we meet a number of colourful characters and learn about their 
different opinions of the team: Danish coach Jens Espensen who describes the 
squad as "extremely poor" and fears complete humiliation against Greenland; 
Karma, the team's Tibetan manager who is a determined dreamer, and Sonam, captain 
of the team, who represents the new generation of Tibetans. A generation that has 
grown up outside of Tibet and is used to the western lifestyle.
