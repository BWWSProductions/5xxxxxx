PLOT
The ominously titled HEADHUNTER is the story of Martin Vinge, a well-known and notoriously hard-hitting journalist who, as a result of his success in this field, finds himself working as a headhunter. Vinge is solicited to secretly work for N.F. Sieger, who commands Denmarkâ€™s largest shipping and oil company. Sieger wants Vinge to find another successor to head his company besides his son Daniel. What seems like a simple job of vetting potential candidates and offering his recommendations soon entangles Vinge in a much larger struggle of corporate greed and violence. As the battle for control of the corporation plays out, Vinge is right in the thick of it. All of this comes at a cost as the game being played puts a strain on Vingeâ€™s relationships and personal life, and he discovers that his job as headhunter may be much more than he bargained for.
