,Toshi_TNE,2010-05-13T21:30Z,"Seeding @1Mbps, leeching @50Kbps.... Awesome.
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!"
,loadstone007,2010-05-14T01:55Z,Thanks!
,Toshi_TNE,2010-05-14T16:35Z,"@zapporius:
Agreed.
After uploading 11 GB and downloading 1.7GB I decided to switch the torrent with one from demonoid. getting a 400Kbps average download, 600Kbps upload. Much better than the measly 50 Kbps using this torrent."
,Ocus,2010-05-14T19:19Z,"Thx allot for the upload, awesome video and sound quality :).

And there is indeed no point in complaining about speed, you don't know how much someone is uploading in total or howmuch upload slots he has active."
,Twopenceworthless,2010-05-15T13:08Z,Can anyone help out - I need some info on seeding - I want to do my part but am clueless. I'm currently using uTorrent. I'm sure there are ways to set it up for fastest download and upload. Or maybe ai should use another torrent loader? My PC is always on might as well put it to use. 
,jetset_Hero,2010-05-20T02:59Z,"I reg'ed just to say how awesome your movies are.

I haven't had a problem until now, anyone know how to play these with vlc? Or have trouble playing them? this is laggy and jittery along with Sherlock Holmes.
I think it is the 1.0.5 update that messed with it, but if anyone can help me out please =]


Like, I said earlier, great uploads. 5/5

Video is blocky as hell. Opening credits is most obvious. Yuck!

All dark scenes look like crap."
,zezo511,2010-05-27T14:02Z,thx uploader
,mam12006,2010-06-01T17:53Z,"Does the original BD includ spanish audio and subs?
Just to know.
Tks"
,killlane,2010-06-06T22:51Z,"The video is VERY laggy, I tried using vlc 1.0.5 and 1.0.3, both lag bad.  I never had trouble before with 1080 movies.

It could be the video or my computer, but not sure."
,killlane,2010-06-06T22:57Z,"Sorry about the previous comment, use cccp and mpc, works okay, but the audio cuts in and out. prolly a setting i need to fix"
,snairin,2010-06-10T11:54Z,"hello,

Dont download this movie. The audio is out of sync and Video is not in a good quality.

This Blu Ray rip was uploaded long before they released the film on Blu Ray.

,wilson1375,2010-06-16T19:37Z,To those having issues playing this: Try messing a bit with your codecs/output. MPC gives you better control of video output. I was having trouble until I switched to VMR-7 renderless. Hope this helps
,AllEyesOnYou,2010-07-01T16:05Z,"Very good quality
V:9
A:10
I ran it first with Vlc-player but it was a little buggy
Than i played it with ArcSoft and there is NO problem..i think vlc has a bug playing wmk"
,datora,2010-07-19T02:15Z,"Cannot play on older system; you'll need mad-powerful processor to render this.  Horrible frame drop/stutter and audio a dozen or more seconds out of sync.  MPC & VLC both pegging processor use @100%; that's a core2 duo @ 3 GHz under winXP; only using ~170-200 MB RAM, but video card is GeForce 7600 ... all sorts of raw power available, but it's not enough by a long shot.  Yes:DID play with codecs & outputs to tweak. No joy.

Props for the U/L, though.  Video quality, when rendered, is stunning, audio rich.  Have D/L'd several other aoloffline torrents, & they have been Really Good (thus, why I grabbed this one ... I was expecting high quality).

Time to throw my crappy old box away, I guess .. just can't keep up with the latest l33tz hardwarez specs.

;-)"
,eladrion,2010-10-29T02:13Z,is the quality the same as if i buy this blueray?
,imapiratetoo,2011-01-20T04:48Z,seven fucken GB????
,clearhorn,2011-02-19T05:32Z,Great torrent perfect size good info thanks a ton! Will seed for a long time! 
,voothai,2011-04-20T03:07Z,"Am I the only one who owns headphones?  

It seems the entire center channel has been mixed much more heavily into the right channel that the left.  And there's only one (two channel) audio track.  I say again:  The dialog audio is horribly imbalanced, leaning heavily to the right.

*Other* than that, it's perfect.  Generally with 1080p H.264 video (like this), I need to use  the VDPAU video playback hardware acceleration with my Nvidia video card to play it smoothly.  Works great with mplayer under linux (ubuntu maverick).  If the H.264 software decoder were multi-threaded, it might work without hardware acceleration, but the one I have is not, and a single (of my four) core can't do it alone.  

Check your CPU usage, and if you've got a pinned core, don't complain about video quality.  "
,mokakeyk,2011-06-26T15:12Z,"so awesome, actually the game ""Alice Madness: Returns"" provoked me to watch this. i've just illegally connected again on my neighbour's fiber optic internet 35,000kbps..yehey:D, thanks anyway"
,Teamcorona,2011-09-11T08:52Z,Compression artifacts visible in smoke and clouds. Better take one with a higher bitrate...
