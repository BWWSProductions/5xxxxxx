,dlarrym,2010-06-03T21:44Z,"TO soltzer: IT IS NOT CANCELED. They just aired the 4th episode last night!!!! ABC's website said it would resume the rest of the 1st seasons episodes some time in september/october. I guess they decided to air the 4th episode last night!. This is the episode after the episode where at the end, the sheriff can't find his young daughter at the FAIR. The 4th episode tells what happens after they begin to search for the sherif's daughter at the FAIR and other goodies. IT HAS NOT BEEN CANCELED. GOTO the ABC.com website and see for your self!!! PLEASE eztv, if you can, PLEASE post the 4th and other episodes to follow. It got huge ratings from the pilot and the other episodes. ABC was waiting for tis feedback before committing to airing the rest of the series. They obviously liked the audiance responce because they are already Airing episodes that they had intended to release closer to the end of this summer. EZTV, do not let false comments to convience you to quit pursuing exciting tv like you always have done. ALSO, SQUIDBILLIES has aired episode 11, 12, 13, and 14 of season 4 but NO ONE is posting them. I do not have a TIVO or DVR, or I would post them myself. Thanks again eztv, sincerely, dlarrym"
,dlarrym,2010-06-03T21:50Z,"THEY HAVE NOT canceled this series.... The 4th episode aired last night (06-02-2010) the 3rd episode ended with the Sherif's daughter is missing at the county FAIR... The 4th episode continues from there. I won't spoil it for anyone, but PLEASE eztv, GOTO ABC.com and you can watch the episode there and find out other HAPPY TOWN info. IT ISN't CANCELED. why would I lie. If I am, it can be easily proven by going to the ABC website. If I lied, there will not be a 4th episode to watch or even mentioned there. eztv PLEASE POST any and all episodes for this GREAT series. goto this address: http://abc.go.com/watch/happy-town/SH5522992/VD5568975/slight-of-hand?cid=fullepisodeaccess_search"
,dlarrym,2010-06-10T06:13Z,"Just a reminder, the 6th epidsode of HAPPY TOWN aired tonight at 10pm. It is an awesome Series. PLease if you can get  a copy,It will be awesome. Thanks for all the other you took time to let us share. I only pst this comment because I have seen INCORRECT comments telling others that the HAPPY TOWN series was over by its 3rd episode. SAM NEIL is in this show. I doubt he would sign a contract unless he was guaranteed at least a full season if not several. He has big pull in hollywood and probably every where a film studio is found. Thanks again. Dlarrym1"
,dlarrym,2010-06-10T06:16Z,"Many thanks for finding the 4th and 5th episodes. It was this post that a comment was made , claiming the series was canceled... People do not need to be so impatient. Thanks again for finding the 4th episode. I look forward to the NEXT one."
