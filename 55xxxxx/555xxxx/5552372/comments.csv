,PageEsquire,2010-05-11T16:44Z,"Great I'm glad someone thought to do this, but can someone mix them down to one file. then this would be the best copy out there. Or someone could leave a link to a gide to altering or mixing video files, And I'll do it. I just don't know how."

,shasha2333,2010-05-11T22:59Z,"Nice, fyi to everyone VLC player is not your only choice. It is so so simple with smplayer. All you have to do is open the avi with smplayer, then goto Audio->Load External File->Select the mp3 audio ""soundtrack"" is the filename, and smplayer automatically syncs it up, and it has a ton of other great features, check it out http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/downloads.php?tr_lang=en"
,shasha2333,2010-05-11T23:07Z,"Also smplayer remembers every setting for each individual video. What does that mean for this torrent? Well after you do the process of loading the audio into this video, even though smplayer makes it real simple, you never have to do it again. Because the next time you open the avi with smplayer it will remember that it was loaded with the english audio mp3 file, and it will load the audio with it every time you open it, even a year from now. Awesome."

,ashwinshankerg,2010-05-12T07:00Z,thank u to that someone for seeding!!!!!
,sevee0100770,2010-05-12T21:45Z,"ok. so i downloaded this yesterday. as far as i can see...its not iron man 2 but its the movie ""crazy heart"". i played with vlc. anybody else?"
,genghis_mom,2010-05-16T02:54Z,"It's not fake. The picture is pretty good, but the audio is staticky and hard to hear. 
It's in Spanish, not English, but there are English subtitles. 
Not a bad effort."
,sweetxtacy,2010-05-16T03:14Z,If the video is a screener than someone really hyped it up. It looks more like a spanish cam and a the english audio. I will seed people I always do but... I am really disappointed.
,ashwinshankerg,2010-05-18T18:52Z,well..u guys shud see the description......
,purpILLhOaze,2010-05-30T18:37Z,"pretty good effort i guess but the subtitles were really really poor... annoying to read. 

also in the tags you put dvdrip, that was unnecessary."
,champofchampions,2010-06-10T18:17Z,this is the best torrent out there till a real dvd-rip comes out!
,Ice_Pheonix,2010-08-08T21:36Z,"couldn't fiure out what he was talking about, but I ran the video in one program (VLC) and the audio file in another (iTunes) and after about 2 min of syncing them, it worked perfectly, no fuss no muss

tyty and I will be seeding"
