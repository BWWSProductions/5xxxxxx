New AdobeÂ® PhotoshopÂ® Lightroomâ„¢ software is the professional photographer's essential toolbox, providing one easy application for managing, adjusting, and presenting large volumes of digital photographs so you can spend less time in front of the computer and more time behind the lens. So you can spend less time sorting and refining photographs, and more time actually shooting them. Its clean, elegant interface literally steps out of the way and lets you quickly view and work with the images you shot today, as well as the thousands of images that you will shoot over the course of your career. Because no two photographers work alike, AdobeLightroom adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

Lightroom lets you view, zoom in, and compare photographs quickly and easily. Precise, photography-specific adjustments allow you to fine tune your images while maintaining the highest level of image quality from capture through output. And best of all, it runs on most commonly used computers, even notebook computers used on location. New AdobeÂ® PhotoshopÂ® LightroomÂ® 2 helps you sort and find the photos you want faster, target specific photo areas for more precise adjustments, and showcase your talent using more flexible printing templates. A host of other new features and enhancements make Lightroom 2 an essential upgrade for professional photographers.
