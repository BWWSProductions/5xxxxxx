"THAT CRAZY BITCH WAS RIGHT"

When two boys get trapped in an abandoned building, 
Veronica (Taylor Schilling) finds herself in the 
right place at the right time to help them. Back at 
the hospital, Chloe (Michelle Trachtenberg) 
pressures doctors to perform a risky surgery to 
save her comatose boyfriend from brain death, and 
Sonia (Jaime Lee Kirchner) treats a psychic patient 
(Aida Turturro) who makes a mysterious prediction 
about her future. Meanwhile, Briggs (James Van Der 
Beek) tries frantically to raise the funds needed 
to pay off his high-stakes debt with the mafia 
before its too late, and Sands (James Tupper) 
considers a job offer to return to Afghanistan 
with a medical relief effort.
