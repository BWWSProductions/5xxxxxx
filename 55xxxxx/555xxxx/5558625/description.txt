Plot -

- In this episode of Selling Houses Australia, the team are brought in to help 
- Monique and Thierry sell their multi level fi ve bedroom, three bathroom family 
- home in Castle Hill. The property was first put up for sale more than two years 
- ago with an asking price of $800,000, which they have since dropped to $765,000. 
- Essentially the negative features of the property outweigh the positives. Its dowdy, 
- slightly dated with an inconvenient layout, but it is generously proportioned, 
- has a pool and a decent backyard in a beautiful bush setting.
