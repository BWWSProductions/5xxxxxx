Shiroâ€™s struggle with his fatherâ€™s cancer and impending death leads to a realization that he must communicate his love and admiration for him before itâ€™s too late. A series of flashbacks reveals their relationship over time, and the trouble Shiro faced connecting to his strict father who was also his teacher and soccer coach. With a consuming secret of his own, Shiro, now in his late twenties and about to get engaged, must eventually learn how to share it with his loved ones.
