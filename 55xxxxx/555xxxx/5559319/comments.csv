 I especially enjoyed the youngfatties.com sets & vids. If you should take it upon yourself to start an abbywinters anthology, that'd be GREAT!

 I've bookmarked your userpage so I don't miss anything:

THANKS again!"

,etaion999,2010-05-14T01:04Z,anthology.... kinda like what you did with youngfatties.... a bunch of sets.
[V],bestec1234,2010-05-14T16:57Z,"Unfortunately, I only have a handful of abbywinters torrents, far from a siterip or complete series.  I have about 20 more and I'll be posting them as I get the time.

I'm also in the process of obtaining some additional plumpers content."
