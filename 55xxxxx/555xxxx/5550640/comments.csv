,BarrySoetoro,2010-05-11T07:36Z,"Trickdaddy, you're supporting a global communist regime. You're being used like a pawn, bro. Let go of your narrow-minded hatred and wake up and smell the coffee.

You're a fucking idiot... personally, I've been taking screenshots of your comments so I can show my grandkids just how uninformed people can be, and how incredibly dangerous it is.

You, sir, are invaluable. Keep it up."

BWHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Captain Logic strikes again.

The welfare state is based on forcefully taking from one and giving what is taken to another under a delusion of ""fairness"".  To argue that the sharing of the content of these torrents is similar to this is beyond absurd."
,booboo332,2010-05-11T08:03Z,Thanks to the uploader.
,thunderbum,2010-05-12T03:43Z,"As always - many thanks, jwhitt for your services to mankind! :)

Hmm. Looks like the resident troll is still off his meds. That's okay though - the drivel he dribbles is always good for a laugh!

Does anyone know where to find Laura Ingraham torrents? I've looked in the usual torrent spots and nada.

Oh Tricky you are such a sad and deluded little man.  While the legality of torrents and whether or not it is stealing is certainly a topic for debate, you are so far off the mark it is comical.

The Marxist model of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"" and the use of force (don't pay your taxes and men with guns will throw you in jail) to redistribute wealth in this way has nothing to do with someone recording an internet stream, editing out the commercials and then sharing it over a p2p network.

While posting CDs and movies on a torrent site is arguably ""stealing"", posting a freely available AM radioshow is certainly not in the same league and trying to compare this to a welfare state just displays how ignorant and simpleminded you really are."
,LIQUIDSTORM2003,2010-05-13T00:53Z,"Guys, it's a RADIO show, paid for by the syndicate stations around the country. They freely broadcast it to anyone who can turn a dial along with all the ads to help pay for it. This is no different than recording a movie off TV and watching it later. Rush himself said that the podcasts were meant to be shared and passed around to people who cannot listen to the live broadcast. The benefit for the 24/7 subscription is to pay for the monthly news letter and get ""free"" stuff like EIB hats and t-shirts. It's not stealing...so get over it."
,booboo332,2010-05-14T02:09Z,"I think you missed the main points being contended but I agree with your that these torrents are not stealing.

Even posting software, movies and music are more accurately a copyright issue, not theft."
