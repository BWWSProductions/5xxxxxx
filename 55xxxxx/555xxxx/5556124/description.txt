The world is getting weirder. Darker every single day. Things are spinning around faster and faster, and threatening to go completely awry. Falcons and falconers. The center cannot hold.

Enter the world of best-selling author Jim Butcherâ€™s Dresden Files, where the creatures of the NeverNever lurk around every corner, prowl through every shadow. Only the determination, faith, and hope of mortal kind is able to stand against the rising darkness â€” be they supernatural cops, wizards, werewolves, changelings, or just plain ordinary joes.

The Dresden Files RPG is coming. Are you ready?
