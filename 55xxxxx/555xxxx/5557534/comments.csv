It might have just been a freak coincidence but I tried using powerISO on my first go at installing this and I got a blue screen error, but it worked flawlessly with DAEMON tools.

Sorry it took me a while to reply to you. Been waiting for TPB to come back online. I will try to seed as much as possible and I hope to get more seeders so sorry for the slow download time. No this is not a virus. And listen to DARKSUPR3MACY and DON'T INSTALL ONLINE!! I cannot stress that enough because that's the main reason it's not working for others. Being offline while installing allows you to enter the registration code without it being rejected immediately. Then you can bypass the code check when you go back online by replacing the hosts file."
,syline,2010-05-19T10:03Z,"@everyone
Recommendation: Do NOT Download.
After wasting 12.64GB downlink bandwidth + upload bandwidth.... 
I find that Photoshop CS5 within this collection is the Development version and not the true retail version. (see White Rabbit Splash Screen and version number)

While this looked very legit (ironic, i know) (i mean the packaged ISOs etc.) It does not contain the true retail, real CS5 Master Collection."
,syline,2010-05-19T10:47Z,"@everyone

This might be a bit technical. but to fix the Dev version of photoshop. Download the trial of Photoshop CS5 extended. (the standalone version).
Run the extraction exe that it comes with.
and extract the folder to desktop.

Now open CS5 Master Coll2.iso with PowerISO or any ISO editing software.
Navigate to X:\Adobe CS5\payloads

Delete the folders
AdobePhotoshop12-Core
AdobePhotoshop12-Core_x64
AdobePhotoshop12-en_GB
AdobePhotoshop12-en_GB_x64
AdobePhotoshop12-en_US
AdobePhotoshop12-en_US_x64

Now, go back to the desktop and open the folder named Adobe CS5 (from the standalone Photoshop CS5 extraction)
Navigate into Adobe CS5\Photoshop\Adobe CS5\payloads

and copy the following folders into the ISO.
AdobePhotoshop12-Core
AdobePhotoshop12-Core_x64
AdobePhotoshop12-en_GB
AdobePhotoshop12-en_GB_x64
AdobePhotoshop12-en_US
AdobePhotoshop12-en_US_x64

Enjoy your non Dev Photoshop CS5 along with the rest of the suite."
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-19T22:52Z,"@skyline
It does come up with the White Rabbit Splash screen, but everything else is Photoshop.  It has the blue ""PS"" photoshop logo on the taskbar, and  under the ""about"" it lists a bunch of photoshop crap."
,asdhokker,2010-05-19T22:52Z,why doesnt it list Premiere Pro during the installation?
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-19T23:35Z,"@asdhokker

,deathangelkiller210,2010-05-20T01:11Z,Is photo shop on this legit or not? Working or not?
,sprkplg,2010-05-20T01:14Z,"White Rabbit is just the code name for Photoshop CS5. Maybe you should do a little research before you just assume it's fake. It IS the retail version.

""If you don?t already know it ? Adobe Photoshop CS5 was code named ?White Rabbit? ? yes, the little guy in Alice in Wonderland and a symbol for the search for truth. To select Photoshop code names, Adobe nominate candidates and then vote for a winner. Check out the beta splash screen designed by Daniel Presedo, an accomplished illustrator and member of our QE team, which features the ?White Rabbit.? What should Adobe code name the next version of Photoshop?"" -http://cs5.org/?p=652"
,DaHakenHacker,2010-05-20T01:41Z,"@sprkplg

So lemme get this straight. This is the ACTUAL RETAIL VERSION, NOT A TRIAL, BETA or something like that. I've been hunting the pirate bay for 2 weeks trying to get the real deal.

2. At the end of the instructions you write that one can ""delete the Adobe Application Manager file from the Adobe folder"" in order to avoid the annoying window. 
Did you meant the ""Extensions Manager""?
Which file are you referring to
Do you mean the ""white rabbit"" that opens before photoshop? "

To DISABLE UPDATES-
when the update notifier pops up, open it and uncheck (BE ""untick"") all the programs, and then click preferences and uncheck ""Notify me of new updates in the menu bar."" and ""Send reports to Adobe on success or failure of update installation."" Then click done."

,MrTTAO,2010-06-25T01:42Z,"[quote]and Adobe Premier and Adobe After Effects only works on x64 based windows[/quote]
32bit is ancient obsolete shit. Adobe flat out tells you to upgrade to a 64bit OS, the only 32bit CS5 app is photoshop. (available in both 32bit and 64bit), rest are 64bit only.

adobe includes the 32bit versions of CS4 premier pro and after effects with CS5, just for the last few luddites still using 32bit.

From the readme:
32-bit vs. 64-bit support in Creative Suite 5 
If you are using a 32-bit operating system, Adobe recommends that you upgrade to either: 
? 
64-bit edition of Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise 
? 
64-bit edition of Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate 
To ease the transition to a 64-bit operating system, Master Collection CS5 includes a support 
package that contains 32-bit versions of Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 and After Effects CS4. 
Until you upgrade to a compatible 64-bit operating system, you can install and use the 32-bit 
support package included with your purchase. After you upgrade to a qualified 64-bit operating 
system, you can install and use Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 and After Effects CS5. "
,MrTTAO,2010-06-26T18:30Z,"alright, tested, this works.

only problem I have is that it asks me to register every time I open it...

Download this activator - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5688410/Adobe_CS5_Activator_-_32bit___64bit_[2010]_-_[GuruFuel].

ACROBAT is NOT Included with versions of CS5 at the present time.

Concerning Pop-Up:
""Licensing for this product has expired.""

For a VERY Quick Workaround just change the YEAR (date) on your computer to 2009. You can do it very quickly in the Windows GUI by clicking on the clock in bottom right hand corner.

OR, you can insert a script in the shortcut to auto change it and then start either Illustrator or Photoshop and then immediately change it back to the current date so your files are not all hosed up date-wise.

In the Command Prompt type:
Date 07-09-2009 (To move back a year from today)

Start Photoshop or Illustrator and wait 10 seconds

Then in Command Prompt window type:
Date 07-09-2010 (To change the date to today's date relative to this comment)

I have an automatic script written so it is accomplished automatically with no additional steps involved. So far it works great.

,unRheal,2010-09-08T02:50Z,"WHY does it say ""expired"" (etc) - and..
WHY does Help -> About say ""WHITE RABBIT"" for Photoshop?

Because it's PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE!  *grumble* It'd be nice if OP had SAID THAT!!"
,glabos,2010-09-08T06:43Z,"Dear unRheal:

Try getting Real !!!! Adobe eventually blocks all cracked software using bogus pirated keys. But it usually takes them 6 to 8 months so during that time the software is good as gold. 

The cracked key is ""Expired"" meaning that Adobe has blocked it on their systems. Mine worked flawlessly with weekly updates for the past 5 months and just a few days ago started the licensing bullshit.

It only took me 5 minutes to figure it out, thanks to a clearly defined bulletin about it on the following Adobe URL:

http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/494/cpsid_49485.html

I posted an easy workaround 2 or 3 comments above this one so take a look before you start calling the software bogus. The Free Trial from Adobe for CS5 Master is less than 5GB in size. The retail product is over 12GB in size. Think before making dumbass comments.

Simply change the year on your computer to 2009 and start Illustrator or Photoshop and they will work fine.

And White Rabbit is the name for Photoshop in CS5. If you don't have the White Rabbit Splash Screen then you also don't have CS5 !!!!

Capiche ?

I thank you very much glabos.
I searched for a solution for the serial problem that gives me the error that for illustrator and photoshop the license is expired!

Got me very annoyed!
Sad part is, When I change m time back to real date while program is running I get the error license is expired. So I have to save my files with a not correct date, but for now,. it will do.

I hope that someone soon has a working fix for this problem.

4.After no errors, download the official patchpremiere and photoshop for me)from adobe.and patch it quickly before anything else is done.

5.Run the cs5 activator 32bit and 64 bit downloaded from the piratebay,now encore,illus and indesign shud have problem running.

6.Go google adobe.cs5.all.products.activator.FIXED4-MPT and disable your antivirus for 10minutes(avast) and download the thing.( i trust that guy and really thank his ass for this magnificent thing.)No virus, just command that made the exe obey and give lifetime license.Admin Run it untill it says ok.

All the problems you guys are having with installing the CS5 Master Collection from here were the same problems I was having cuz it read something like  ""You are missing a file needed for installation of CS5.""

,cme88,2011-04-21T21:00Z,"@hastrix - your serial worked great! Thanks!

I looked through the comments so I hope I didn't skip this part..

Since there are three disk - how can I ""instert"" the second and third disks with Daemon Tools Lite? I finished installing the first disk and now it says: ""Please insert Disk CS5 Master Coll2 to continue."" 

I have mounted the second disk but it won't autoplay and when I run it I get an error saying that there is no program associated with that CD.

Please help! 

Thanks!!"
,vineet85,2011-05-01T17:17Z,"The installation goes perfect...after the whole thing is done (including the hosts thing)..the most important programs like Photoshop, Indesign and illustrator...dont work at all. I get an error message ""License for this product has expired"". But the other programs work. 

Please help...is there is a solution to this??"
,Midori_Sangatsu,2011-05-28T21:50Z,"Couldn't get it to work until I used hastrix serial codes.  Though my problem now is I'm getting the license expired error when I try to use 
InDesign
Illustrator
Soundbooth 
Encore
Flash Catalyst

Is there a way I can fix this without having to set back my computer's clock?

If not, is it possible to set the clock back and then forward after using the program?

,akingeneye,2011-06-12T18:18Z,man this is good thx
,Crazy-Mazy,2011-08-08T15:35Z,"Well I've been using this download for over a year now and it has always worked perfectly, except for recent time. On my last 2 installs the serials and crack seemed to work but after a month of usage it goes into trial mode and reinstalling it or applying the crack again does nothing, windows reinstall has been my only option. Are any other people having this problem or am I just doing something wrong?"
,H_riez,2011-09-02T05:00Z,"Please Help me.. i cant input the serial number. it must be have online serial check.. i have to change my host file,, but it wont bypass the online check.. is there any solution for me,.? thanks.. please.

,skymne92001,2011-09-02T15:38Z,"This is detailed instruction how i get these stuff to work perfectly:

1) Deactivate internet
2) Install Daemon Tools if you dont have it or similar purpose program
3) Mount First Image (CS5 Master Coll1)
4) Instal as a trial
5) Follow instructions to the end (took me about 45 mins to 1 hour)
6) When Instalation finishes,copy HOSTS file that came with a package into the directory 
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc 
and overwrite the previous hosts file.
7) Than start anything (i started photoshop) and type one of the serials from here:

1325-1263-0034-6192-0472-9778
 1325-1157-8207-7707-9798-6532
 1325-1319-1010-6434-1955-4619
 1325-1870-2938-9873-5356-2624
 1325-1174-1834-0596-8505-0323
 1325-1271-7898-3364-1803-3655
 1325-1823-6020-0958-5549-2729
 1325-1177-2533-5307-9327-8593
 1325-1960-8746-4023-7312-2320
 1325-1095-0854-7085-2679-7165

8) explore other products and when it asks to instal other codecs (because they aren't installed when you cliked TRIAL version at the begining) and do so by clicking YES
9) Enjoy in fully featured Adobe Creative Suite free of charge :)"
,skymne92001,2011-09-02T15:39Z,and yes you can activate internet now :)
,skymne92001,2011-09-02T16:00Z,"and maybe you shuold temporarily change time to 2.6.2009 at the begining of the instalation (if you are folloving my instructions do that after you deactivate internet,and then do everything else that says there) cheers :)"

,narbed,2011-12-27T20:52Z,"I can't perfectly pinpoint the solution BUT I FIXED THE ""Licensed Expired"" -WITHOUT TURNING BACK TO 2009!- 

To be honest I fixed it by accented... I downloaded this torrent and installed it a while ago... just today I uninstalled Photoshop, and downloaded Photoshop 5.1 extended by [TheThingy]

I then started making a hybrid hosts file, of TheThingy's file and the one in this download. Basically it ended up being TheThingy's host file with these three lines at the end of it (each on a new line no space or # before it)

127.0.0.1           adobe.activate.com       
127.0.0.1           125.252.224.90                       
127.0.0.1           125.252.224.91
[they where in my host's file (and I think this downloads host file) but not in TheThingy's file... Idk if they are important, the first one looks important]

Then I did what TheThingy's editing hosts file said to do. Open The Terminal and Type ""ipconfig /flushdns"" and hit ""enter"" then exit the terminal... Again... I don't know if it's important or not...

I then installed photoshop 5.1 with TheThingy's instructions and serials (the top serial# didn't work for me, but one up from the bottom did) 

I Installed it with my date set to the current date (2011)...

Afterwords I opened Photoshop... Didn't set up an adobe ID.

Closed Photoshop and Opened Premiere Pro... And it opened in 2011... I then started opening a bunch of the programs and they all worked...

I personally think That TheThing's Hosts file blocks something that the one in this file doesn't that alows the programs to run in any date... because TheThingy's host file is better formatted and has more Adobe Sites blocked... but I can't say for sure that that is the step that did it. 

lINK TO [THETHING'S] PHOTOSHOP TORENT:

"
,narbed,2011-12-27T21:14Z,"P.S. I had Internet off the entire time I was messing with the Hosts' files.... once you download the Photoshop CS5.1 just turn your internet off you won't need it for the rest of the install)

In the 3 lines I added there where 31spaces in between the 127.0.0.1 and the Site... I don't think it actually matters but that's how it's formatted in this hosts file.

To only uninstall Photoshop from this collection alone... go to remove/uninstall programs and uninstall Adobe CS5 Master collection... Adobe's Uninstall wizard will open... then unselected all programs except Photoshop and continue. (only Photoshop will have a check next to it)

And lastly I am a tiny bit more tech savvy then I sound, I'm trying to make directions as simple as I can, and unless I know something 100% I won't act like I do."
