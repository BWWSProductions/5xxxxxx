Copy of the Instructions:

WARNING: MAKE SURE THE INTERNET IS TURNED OFF BEFORE YOU DO THIS

1. Install DAEMON Tools Lite onto your computer. Make sure to install the DAEMON Tools Gadget onto the desktop.

2.
	If you are running the gadget -
Click "Mount Virtual CD/DVD-ROM" which looks like a play button. When the window pops up, navigate to the CS5 Master Coll1 located in the Adobe CS5 Master Collection folder. Click OK.

	If you are running the actual DAEMON Tools Lite program instead of the gadget -
Open the program and double-click on the virtual drive at the bottom of the window. When the window pops up, navigate to the CS5 Master Coll1 located in the Adobe CS5 Master Collection folder. Click OK. Close the window.

3. Open "My Computer". Right-click on the Virtual Drive with CS5 on it. Choose the top option which should be "Install or run program from your media"

4. Follow the Adobe install instructions all the way through.

5. When the installation is finished, a window should pop up asking you to continue or start a trial or to enter a serial number. Choose to enter the serial number and copy and paste the following code.

1325-1118-5864-4422-1094-1166


Click OK.

6. Next, copy and paste the hosts file into the directory C:WindowsSystem32driversetc and overwrite the previous hosts file.

(It is now safe to turn the internet back on if you so choose)

7. Start up any of the Adobe programs and congrats you now have Adobe CS5 for free! If you would like to get rid of the annoying window that opens up every time you start one of the programs, you can delete the Adobe Application Manager file from the Adobe folder.
