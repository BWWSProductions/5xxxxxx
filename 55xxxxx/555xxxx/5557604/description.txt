Normally, when someone requests a movie, I'll see if I've converted it, if so, I'll usually upload it.  But in the case of a request for 'Pearl Harbor', I felt that something as historically important needed a more historically accurate film uploaded with it.  Luckily, I have both 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!' in 853x format.  Both films look and sound great, and both tell the same story from a slightly different perspective.

In the case of 'Pearl Harbor', it's not that it's a bad movie, just a bad interpretation of history.  If you don't mind the historical liberties taken, it's a pretty good movie.  Mostly, it's about two friends who grow up together, join the Army Air Corps, and get into a love triangle with a nurse all in the early days of World War II.  But the film stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Garner, and many other recognizable faces.

'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!' on the other hand, is one of the most historically accurate films ever made.  It was filmed entirely by two different film crews and directors, one for the American sections, one for the Japanese sections.  Most of the planes and ships seen in the film were models, WWII surplus, or replicas specifically built for the film.  At the time, the film was hailed for it's near-seamless usage of models and real planes and of the five Academy Awards it was nominated for in 1971, the one it did win was for Best Special Effects.  It was considered a flop at the US Box office, but it was one of the biggest film hits in Japan for all of the 1970s.  In later years, the film would later be recognized by US film critics for the historical accuracy and tremendous acting and filming effort.

Both films tell the story of what happened on December 7th, 1941, but the two are entirely different films.  In 'Pearl Harbor,' you are told the story from the perspective of three characters in the midst of a love triangle.  But in 'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!,' the film is told from a much wider view, trying to paint a very accurate depiction of many of the issues which surrounded the attack on Pearl Harbor -- Why were the US's losses so great?  Could it have been worse?  Why did Japan really attack?  Why do historians often claim 'Japan saw no alternative'?  'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!' answers these questions well.  'Pearl Harbor' though has a different story to tell, and in many ways, much more exciting and compelling action sequences with modern special effects.

I hope you enjoy both films.

Trivia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Akira Kurosawa agreed to direct the Japanese portions of the film when he was told that David Lean (Doctor Zhivago, Great Expectations, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Laurence of Arabia) would be directing the American portoins of the film.  However, it was a lie and when Akira Kurosawa found out, he did everything he could to be fired from the project and was successful.  Many film critics in both the US and Japan later surmised the film would have been either a colossal success or a colossal failure if both Kurosawa and Lean had in fact directed the film.  It is interesting to note, that of all the time and money which Akira Kurosawa spent on the project, less than one minute of scenes he directed and filmed made it to the final cut.
2.  Critics and historians are quick to point out that the most visible historic inaccuracy is that Admiral Yamamoto never actually said his infamous line about 'waking a slumbering giant and filling him with horrible resolve'.  This line is attributed to him because of later comments he made when the war was over.  It is considered one of the most famous historic lines that was never actually said.
3.  Contrary to popular belief, the title of this movie means neither 'Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!' nor 'Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!' in Japanese. The phrase actually comes from the first syllables of "Totsugeki" (meaning attack) and "Raigeki" (for "torpedo attack") yielding TO-RA, TO-RA, TO-RA, which incidentally has the same pronunciation as "tiger" repeated thrice.
4.  In both films, you will see an African American mess attendant firing a machine gun on the West Virginia.  This depiction is of Doris 'Dorie' Miller, who was the first African American to win the Navy Cross, the second highest honor awarded by the US Navy at the time.  Without any training, he fired an unattended machine gun at Japanese aircraft until it was out of ammunition.  In 'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!' he was portrayed by a relatively unknown actor who later made a career out of bit parts on telivision shows playing guards and cops, but in 'Pearl Harbor', the character was given lines and a small part of the story.  He was played by Oscar Winner Cuba Gooding Jr.
5.  Ben Affleck's character is based loosely on Joe Foss who had 32 confirmed kills in World War II, but never actually fought in the skies over Pearl Harbor, nor was he even stationed in Hawaii during the attack.  In fact, the two pilots that Affleck and Hartnett portray in the film (and are also portrayed in 'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!') were completely inexperienced in combat.  However, they did shoot down a number of Japanese planes during the attack and were both chosen to take part in 'Doolittle's Raid,' so in many ways, Ben Affleck's character is an amalgam of the two men.
