,NorseGuy,2010-11-12T03:17Z,"Hi, I am using Avast 4.8 pro, but since Avast 5 came, twice a day I get the pop-up window that urges me to update to Avast 5. I tried upgrading once, but then the old subscription/key (made by one of the successfully working key generators found here ;-) .. wasn't valid on Avast 5 pro when upgrading.

I am really satisfied with Avast 4 and don't really want to upgrade so to the point: Twice a day (at least I) get two pop-up windows prompting me to upgrade to Avast 5. I've tried entering the Avast settings so that I don't get two pop-up windows a day to promptly upgrade to Avast 5, but I don't manage to get rid of the pop-up window under the settings.

So either...

1: It is possible to find a setting that removes the (promt to upgrade) pop-up window (and if that is case then I hope someone would enlighten me on how to do so) or...

2: It is not possible to get rid of the upgrade pop-up windows while running Avast 4x, and one has to live with it.

(One thing is for sure: I personally don't want to live with the pop-up windows and will then instead install some other anti-virus program ;)

Anyone can confirm the first point and/or the latter? Any olution etc?

Thanks."
