11 | Laser Speed                    [197kbps]

Their third best release imo, more synthy goodness and the first album featuring Dan Briggs on Bass.
Standout tracks (I'll give some detail in this one)

Alaska, with it's incredible opening Synth and Guitar riff and In Your Face brutallity throughout the rest of the song, this is definitely one the finer tracks BtBaM has put out. Also, this was the first BtBaM song I ever heard, I saw the video clip on an episode of VictoryTV.

Selkies: The Endless Obsession. For a long time, before I actually really got into them, this was my favorite song, I'd listen to it at least once a day. The harmonies in the intro are breathtaking, the heaviness they pound out through the verse is brutal and dissonnant without going over the top, then the return to that tasty opening riff and then one of the most beautifully written musical pieces I've ever heard. With the perfect balance of beauty and technicality, this is surely the best track on the album.

Laser Speed is almost a practical joke on the listeners, first you're listening to a relaxing jazz acoustic number, and then it takes a nosedive headfirst into a textbook elevator music stereotypical laid-back jam

Their best album. Fact, not opinion.
No standout tracks because technically the entire album is one track, it's just split up into interchangeable sections.

[hint, try messing with the order of the songs and putting some on repeat]

Latest album and the runner up to Colors.
Opening with the Ambient Jazz masterpiece that is 'Mirrors' and closing with the longest song to date, Swim To The Moon, coming in at 17:54 and packed wall to wall with blistering, somtimes Dream Theater-esque solos, this is without a doubt one of the best albums of 2009 and their career.
Standout tracks, Mirrors & Swim To The Moon.
