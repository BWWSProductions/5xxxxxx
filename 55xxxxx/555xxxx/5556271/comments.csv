,golu4you,2010-05-12T23:16Z,This worked perfect for 3g...million thanks..:-)
,golu4you,2010-05-12T23:17Z,works perfect!!!
,rugburn11,2010-05-13T01:19Z,This is not recommended for 2G iPhones...Please go to iClarified Tutorials for 2G iPhones and use RedSnOw 0.9.2
,cent0709,2010-05-13T09:28Z,but where can i find the winterboard?? cant use the themes without winterboard right?
,Dan2806,2010-05-13T10:55Z,"@cent0709
The Winterboard application is within Cydia. Once the device is jailbroken with the spirit software, load Cydia and touch the search tab. Type Winterboard and install.
There are thousands of themes within Cydia for you to install for use with Winterboard.
Also as Rugburn11 stated, my apologies to people who may have tried this witha 2G iPhone. I have not tested this and am unsure if this will work. When I said any iPhone i did mean 3G or 3G S.
Thankyou."
,golu4you,2010-05-13T19:52Z,"Is there any way 2 unlock it...because it's only jailbroken....and I need some sources so that I can Install cracked app......

peace..:-)"
,Dan2806,2010-05-13T20:33Z,"@golu4you
Go to Cydia, tap manage,then sources. Tap edit then add.
In the source box, type     apt.macosmovil.com   and then add source. It will automatically install the source. Once installed, select the macosmovil source and scroll down till you see AppSync para OS 3.1(3.1.2). Install this. Now you will be able to add cracked apps.
Hope this helps you my man."
,Dan2806,2010-05-13T20:35Z,"Also, this is just an untethered jailbreak. As far as I am aware, 3G S running latest firmware still cannot be unlocked unless paid for by pro unlocking company. I might be wrong but as I have no need to unlock my iPhone, I have not properly looked into it."
,golu4you,2010-05-14T00:33Z,That worked gr8..Thanks dan :-)...gr8 torrent will seed it for long time...

,xyquil,2010-05-16T23:45Z,Just in case of failed jailbreak... what will happen and what to do? Can i still connect my iphone in itunes after jailbreaking? How am i going to transfer my videos and music on jailbreak iphone? Any help from brilliant people around here... sorry for the noob questions.
,Dan2806,2010-05-17T09:56Z,"@xyquil
It won't fail, trust me. It is so easy and can't go wrong. The iPhone will still work exactly the same but will allow 3rd party apps to be installed through a program called cydia which will be the only showing difference after the jailbreak."
,xyquil,2010-05-18T19:34Z,Thanks Dan2806. I want to backup my iphone first before jailbreaking. where can i find the backup in a specific folder and how many file is it? I am using windows vista and the current iTunes and 3.1.3 firmware. Just in case i want to restore back my iphone to the old backup before jailbreak. Thanks.
