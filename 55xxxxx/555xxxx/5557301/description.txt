     SUMMARY:
              The Real Robin Hood The marauding mercenary of
              English folklore is one of history's best-known tales,
              and the legend of Robin Hood is the inspiration for
              more movies, radio and TV programs than any other folk
              hero. But the image of a hero in tights and a
              feathered cap is a somewhat recent addition to the
              myth. In reality, Robin Hood is a composite of several
              historical figures whose exploits date back to the age
              of the Crusades. In the film Robin Hood, starring
              Russell Crowe, director Ridley Scott's production is
              based on the most solid and recent historical research
              into the character and promises a startlingly fresh
              interpretation of Robin Hood for a new generation.
              This special will distinguish between historical
              evidence and Hollywood fiction, and seek to create a
              realistic portrait of the mythical hero. Includes
              clips from the film as well as interviews with
              director Scott, principal Robin Hood cast members and
              renowned historians.
