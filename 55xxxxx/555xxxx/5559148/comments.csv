However, I don't know if this problem comes only in BioShock from torrents and such. Applying an update (1.1?) probably solves it, but I can't get this DL to update and/or work properly updated. Any solution, anyone?"

Be specific, exactly how are you launching the game?  Depending on how you extract with winrar you should have this series of folders:  Bioshock.PC.Game ...\2K games\2K games\Bioshock\Builds\Release\Bioshock.exe (in the Release Folder).

,Urshag,2010-09-15T21:24Z,"I found ""A"" solution to the empty safe bug.  I am pasting this from a forum post I found:

I HAVE FOUND A 100% WORKING SOLUTION!


After reading countless of solutions like tonics, not searching the bodies and searching the safe in the first place (none of them worked for anyone i guess...) i found my own way to fix this bug. Its not really a fix, but a detour.

When you enter the room that looks like an open area with trees and in which there is an event that some gas purs from the ceiling and the door at the right close (btw, the door that closes is the door with capsule that takes you to another level) you teleport behind the door before it closes, get on the capsule and go to another level, you will miss some of the items, but will know the story from the glitched level more or less, the safe bug was at the end i suppose, if not i will read some walktrough to see what happened after the safe glitch but that is not important now, if you want to play the next levels of the game you better read along:P now, you probably ask yourself how do you teleport? Just search bioshock cheat codes for Teleport to Pointer - teleport, the cheat codes are so simple that its just unbelivable. I turned on god mode and teleport. For lazy people, open defuser.ini from the release directory and at the top of the file you have default user settings, just find the F's shortcuts and on your preffered free one type ""teleport"" for example F10=teleport

PS: TURN OFF ALL THE CHEATS AFTER YOU GET PASS THE GLITCHED LEVEL! you will spoil a great game."

,Halibuty,2011-05-27T20:09Z,"ATTENTION!

This torrent cannot be patched to 1.1 using the standard patch, which means you are very likely to get stuck in Arcadia, where a safe with a quest item will be empty.   I know of no way to put this item into your inventory manually.

There is a workaround:  find your user.ini file in /appdata/roaming/bioshock/ or equivalent.  Bind 'ghost' and 'walk' to two keys.  IE:  search for first occurence of ""F11="" and change it to F11=ghost.  Then change the next line to F12=walk.  Use these keys to clip through doors to farmers market and metro station.  You will miss plot events in arcadia as a result."
,farnbert,2011-07-05T04:19Z,"Or...

I have patched this torrent to 1.1.

(I haven't played all the way through yet, but it boots as 1.1 and is running).

Extract this standalone torrent, then DL 1.1 patch and 1.1 no-cd.exe file.

Extract/install 1.1 upgrade/patch (I did it from within folder), delete and substitute new 1.1 cracked bioshock.exe/boot executable. 

Then REBOOT!

Then REBOOT!!!

I thought it had failed the first 2 times. 
It didn't boot from the cracked 1.1 exe, although it did boot from the original 1.0 exe. 
But it crashed after the postcards.

But I had not rebooted.

Extract the 1.1 patch alone as a zip and it has a text file inside that tells you to REBOOT.

REBOOT after installing the 1.1 up!

Seems to work.

Although you system is always a variable.

(I'm running this acceptably cranked down on a MSI wind 2X.)"
,farnbert,2011-07-05T04:37Z,"""(I did it from within folder)""

From within the bioshock install folder.

I renamed and relocated mine.

But it seems to find the folder anyway.

I guess although this torrent is practically SA, it leaves a few keys behind.

(And a smidge of a securom dummy folder. But nothing unlocker doesn't kick out quick whenever you feel like it. It just regenerates when you run again.)"

,jonnychadootz,2011-08-20T23:13Z,Works correctly :) U can even update it with the 1.1 patch if you like (fixes bugs and adds more plasmids) (don't forget to get 1.1 crack/no cd if u update) Ty :) this version is very convenient.

,trueAustinLove,2011-08-23T23:14Z,When ever i update the game stops working as soon as i click anything in the start up. Like it will only go passed one loading screen and then say error. Not sure if this helps but i have windows 7
,sergeant0101,2011-08-24T17:33Z,Can somebody tell me why its lagging like hell after the 1.1 patch ? :(
,jfdc,2011-09-12T17:55Z,"Everything Works absolutely perfectl for me!just extracted and played .exe and it all started up!no freezes no nothing!except of course when im trying to play it in higher resolutions than my computer can handle!People:If u got problems during installation or conflicts from Windows,as Devastate says:u cant handle it,this game's graphics are really advanced!
So really thanks for this wonderful game mr Devastate,and for many others!i ll seed this of course!"
,mcewenaj,2011-09-14T17:40Z,"Works Great! Had to install d3d9x_33.dll into the folder to get it working, but that was it.... Now have it running on full resolution + full graphics on my new laptop! Great torrent, Thanks."
,suicidemayhem,2011-09-20T19:15Z,"TORRENT IS BEING TRACKED. 

Game works fine, but I just got my email from ISP about this specific torrent.

BE WARNED!"
,ZJones910,2011-10-05T18:04Z,For those of you having problems with the sound; right click on the Bioshock icon on the desktop and click properties then click compatibility then check the box that says run program in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3.
,crzy101,2011-10-05T23:40Z,"My problem with the sound is that it would work fine after install + patch, but if I tried to change it from stereo to anything else, it would stop working. Then when you tried to switch it back it still wouldn't work. I had to delete the game folder, reinstall and patch, then just leave the sound as stereo. I didn't try xp sp3 mode but I assume that would remove dx10 features, which I want. "
,Gamez4You,2011-10-11T23:08Z,very nice download speed. I'll seed for awhile. Good job djDEVASTATE
,glasorus9748,2011-10-24T21:25Z,"Hey there! Everytime I try to run the ""Bioshock.exe"", computer says that I'm missing the d3d9x_33.dll file. Couldn't fine any help, so can someone help me? :)"
,glasorus9748,2011-10-24T21:25Z,"Hey there! Everytime I try to run the ""Bioshock.exe"", computer says that I'm missing the d3d9x_33.dll file. Couldn't fine any help, so can someone help me? :)
Oh and, for the patch 1.1, it says I'm ""missing the old files"", need help on that too!
Thx!!! :D"
,glasorus9748,2011-10-25T20:42Z,"Hey um, found out about the missing files, you need to google their name and download them on a website, then put them in the relase folder, for those who've got my problem.
Now, when I load the game, it shows the Bioshock icon, and the screen goes black, and the computer loads like crazy. Any ideas?"
,CrankyPoodler,2011-11-01T02:04Z,Also got a cease and desist from my ISP. Looks like 2K Games is cracking down hard on their releases. That makes two from them this past month.
,V1vald1,2011-11-12T04:47Z,I don't think the card in my old rig supports DX9 lol. Is there a way to force dx8?
,onemasta,2011-11-13T09:24Z,Please seed! It's not coming faster than 13kb/s.

,kls023,2012-01-23T07:09Z,"Thisi game has been compromised.  I received a ""Notice of Copyright Infringement"" letter after I downloading this torrent.  Beware!  
Other then that, it plays awesome and very easy to install.  GREAT TORRENT!  THANKS!"
,ironymon,2012-01-24T08:09Z,"Don't like downloading archived files, unless it compresses the size to half with no texture video quality loss then what do i care, u got a skull for a reason."
,Weslington,2012-02-07T11:29Z,"If you have Windows 7 and you would like to play Bioshock WITHOUT sound, go ahead and download this shittorrent."
,Weslington,2012-02-07T22:16Z,"Okay never mind lol; figured out how to fix the no-sound-issue! Just follow these instructions (source: Leetsk33t):
'browse to Start > Control Panel > Sound (in classic view). Once done switch to the Recording tab which will show the currently active inputs on your system (e.g. Line in, Microphone). Right click in the clear space below these devices and select the option for Show disabled devices.
This should show an additional device called Stereo Mixing, right click on this device and select Enable.'"
,MerseaParadise,2012-02-14T01:54Z,Game doesn't work. Just gives error message: binkw32.dll
,Robstar2001,2012-02-17T15:34Z,"Game works for me (win 7 64-bit). Its not perfect, some hang ups, crappy sound and the safe is empty @ langley's office, but after binding F11=Ghost F12=Walk in the DefUser.ini manually using windows word (took about  3 seconds) i was able to get to the next level regardless. Thanks for the up."
