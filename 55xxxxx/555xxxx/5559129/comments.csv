[V],twentyforty,2010-05-13T19:19Z,"@pothead: Thanks, but they're quite ""unpopular"".

@sanyam: I cannot do nice looking ""Cougar"" even as 272p, therefore - [quark] is impossible. 
However, I have done ALL Cougars and due to the low interest I always push their uploads back - and it usually ends as - never.
So - I collect all encodings - and when summer pause come, I will up the torrent for whole season. Then, one can download only episodes one wants."
,believenu,2010-05-13T20:47Z,"thanks for all the uploads even ones i have never tried as someone somewhere has and if they never became a pirate they can seed also but not make comments.
regarding the prob I had with 720p on the gravity show.. I did as suggested did not work so I guess my slow speed (and older com is the prob. however sadly castle was still viewable as slow motion. before you put as 272p and works fine as does v so question is will you be keeping castle as 720 or return to tried and true 272...
To be honest I watch other shows with 350mb and they all work fine (l&o svu, crim int origional) when I can't find on your page, so I am not quite sure what is happening . to the new people like me(internetwise less than 1yr old) all that lovely info below means not a lot(thanks for trying to educate us newbies). when you last fall describle you intended with lower mb per show and you instilled in me a understanding of what you were doing seed and share(don't seed and it dies) and I believe you have you ways to stop(block) non sharers. I tried and loved and seeded as much as possible and look for you first to try new shows and some good qualtiy movies. Thank you for calling me friend .I am honoured."
,lilars26,2010-05-13T21:31Z,Nothing wrong with a good looking cougar but what is a cougar to you is probably a kitten to me.lol
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-13T21:38Z,"@believenu: 350MB shows you download elsewhere have 4 TIMES SMALLER (roughly) frame-size (picture).
624x352 pixels and they are XviD encodings.
My 350MB encodings of TV shows are 720p, frame-size is 1280x720 pixels and H264.
Kind like apples and oranges.
And YES, your computer is too old and too slow to process such high resolutions, even if my 720p are much less demanding (by huge percentage) for computers than 720p you can download elsewhere (over 1 GB big).
So, my friend, till you get new computer (and my is old too, but not so old) - stick with 272p, 360p or download someplace else."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-13T21:44Z,"@lilars26 & sanyam: ""I've done all Cougars.""
LOL to that, just now I get it.
Not all - but they have been all - nice looking. So far."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-13T21:50Z,"@believenu: Sorry, it sounds wrong, my:
""... download someplace else.""
What I meant was - for XviD. XviD is OK."
,lilars26,2010-05-13T22:46Z,Thanks for this 20/40.
,believenu,2010-05-13T22:59Z,I will look eslewhere only if necessary prefer your u/l and site for most. . I understand regarding here if d/l does not work only then elsewhere and still will seed what I take.. because seeding is sharing.
