I don't think the subject of Max's Coca-Cola boycott project came up during this visit, but I have heard him make the case for it during various other appearances. I think it would be quite interesting to see that played out, and I agree with you on the other points you made, too.

,boing_boing,2010-05-11T12:35Z,"lol i wrote that before i listened. and yeah coca-cola gets mentioned in 2b at 16mins. alex let max lay it out but AJ still doesn't want to do it. it would work max is passionate about it.

 it and it would take AJ to a new level plus all the listeners would think they are taking action against the NWO. knowing what is going on isn't the answer to what is going on, which AJ seems to think. the courts are not going to stop the bankers, voters are not going to affect things which AJ believes.

AJ gets a lot of stick some call him a fear-mongerer, or never mentioning zionism. he is  a leader whether he likes it or not and i think he needs to do the boycott. reading out the news doesn't change much AJ !

i live in the uk and we have nothing like AJ he does a great job but the fight against the NWO needs to be stepped up we need to show our power. and with our money and spending this will hit them where it matters.  "

Good catch!  I was having to do some serious multi-tasking while listening to this and missed this most recent Coke boycott discussion completely.
Must re-listen. 

I tend to agree with all your points here, but I wonder if Alex's famous ego is what will ultimately prevent him from getting on board with this project -- because it was Max's idea and not Alex's.  I hope not.

,boing_boing,2010-05-12T00:38Z,"yeah the ego part is a possibility. and when i think of it most listeners probably don't drink coca-cola due to aspartame anyway. some comments on the utube clip of AJ + MK are also wanting the boycott. 

as i said above we need to move on from been informed and aware to taking action and fighting back. standing in local councils or putting up posters and putting vids up on utube is not enough. 

anyway thanks for the uploads !!!! "
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-05-12T06:52Z,"Fellas, why would AJ command us pidley goyim to boycott? 19 of AJ's advertizers are Jewish and in bed with the soft drink industry.

If you are suspicious of AJ over this, you are way behind. This is the tip of the iceberg."
,boing_boing,2010-05-12T12:17Z,"the reverse speech clips of alex jones on rense's site really swing it for me timmy.

but yeah i saw the word count of fall of republic and israel/zionism was mentioned twice. "
