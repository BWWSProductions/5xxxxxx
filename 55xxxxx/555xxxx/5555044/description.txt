    Michael Mosley takes an informative and ambitious          
    journey exploring how the evolution of scientific         
    understanding is intimately interwoven with society's    
    historical path.                                          
                                                               
    The question of our human origins is one of the most      
    controversial science has wrestled with. This is the     
    story of how scientists came to explain the beauty and    
    diversity of life on earth, and reveal how its             
    evolution is connected to the long and violent history    
    of our planet. Featuring ocean adventurers, eccentric    
     French aristocrats, mountain climbers, a secret           
    Victorian publisher with 12 fingers, a ridiculed German    
    meteorologist, and only a brief hint of Charles Darwin.
