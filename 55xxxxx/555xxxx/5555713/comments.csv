[V],Shroo,2010-05-13T19:33Z,"NOTE: The File got corrupt, you wont get past game intro. Unpack this to the game root folder 4shared(.)com/file/DB583FS5"

[V],Shroo,2010-05-13T21:21Z,serial is written below the input box where you have to type in the serial number Starts with RRRRR-

,ganjamigo,2010-05-14T17:57Z,"It seems that the random map generator was sadly ripped from this release. If you attempt to play a randomly generated map, the game will crash. 

""MissionsEx.hpk"" file is missing Missions\RandomMap\realms.xml"
[V],Shroo,2010-05-14T18:37Z,"@xxleonxx31

Remove these () and you will be able to download

@ganjamigo

This is a stand alone RIP, it does not contain any files from the first version that probably why it give the error"
,ganjamigo,2010-05-14T19:07Z,"Ahhh, I see...

Do you know if copying the ""Missions.hpk"" file over from the original version will resolve this?"
[V],Shroo,2010-05-14T20:05Z,"Im sure it will, give it a go :]"
,ganjamigo,2010-05-14T22:43Z,Worked like a charm
,shimmergl00m,2010-05-14T23:30Z,"btw noticed that secret mission ""pop up"" events are missing and that ""juanito"" is completely absent from the game.. also ripped or?"
,shimmergl00m,2010-05-15T00:13Z,better yet is it possible to install this on top of original tropico 3?
,Vipe0713,2010-05-15T05:33Z,"yeah i was wondering about juanito, where is he? :("
[V],Shroo,2010-05-15T05:51Z,"@shimmergl00m

yes you can install it over the top off original this can also work as an expansion, I have tested first mission worked fine fine. I assume it does not require any additional features of the first part, as per usual most of the game that do expansions are stand alone game, all this crap for expansions is marketing wanna play expansion buy original game, that's the way it goes...

[V],Shroo,2010-05-16T14:19Z,never work for lame douches ;]
,NoizeSeizure,2010-05-16T15:15Z,What is the serial number????
,lowe11111111111111,2010-05-16T23:31Z,hi shroo i got a little problem playing the a box laying around the map a square box with a red F.what that??.do i  missing some texture
,GrgComlsh,2010-05-23T05:32Z,"The bat file didn't run automatically for me.  I had to execute the relevant commands one by one in my command prompt.  Then it uncompressed.

Once I got the right file from 4-shared, I was able to play the game through the executable.

BUT:

Missing music files, missing voice files, missing image files, and I have to re-enter the serial code every single time I want to load the game.  Yes it runs, but there are no tunes and the ""sky"" is just an empty black field.  And if you zoom in you see a bunch of boxes marked with ""F"" instead of grass and bushes.  

Jaimito doesn't work, which I could count as a feature, but the package does come with ""Betty Boom"" an insufferable communist radio DJ who is even worse that Jaimito.  (But we can't blame Shroo for that one).  

I was able to drop in the .hpk files from my Tropico 3 original and that solved a lot of my missing data problems and improved my graphics.  I also got some music in there that way, although we SERIOUSLY need more/better tunes in Tropico 3 and I was really hoping the expansion pack would have them.  Fuck: My primary motivation in DL this was not having to listen to the annoying band making the cat sounds, so this is a big disappointment.  I hope this is just another one of TPTB's myriad fuck-ups, and not an oversight of Kalypso.  "
,martintussen,2010-06-25T11:26Z,what exactly is it I have to install in the rootfolder?

,dalus1,2010-09-26T12:25Z,"heyyyy ,,,, the game crash when i go make  campaign or sand box ,wth is that? did you have  afix for it???"
,termite43,2010-09-27T22:25Z,"What the hell is this?  It just plays a demo movie?  Over and over and over.  Takes about 10 tries crtl+alt+del to finally get task manager to shut the f'ing thing down.  There's no game here.  Make a copy that works for 64 bit, eh?  You know, XP is dead and actually windows 8 (when it comes out) will be the last version that will run 32 bit shit.  Ever.  Get with the future.  "
,banxii,2011-02-12T22:13Z,"Hey I have a problem, I downloaded succesfully, but when I try to open it, it always keep reapeting the intro for absolute power and never does anything else, it keeps replaying the intro for the expansion. Right now i'm downloading the fix, but please help."
,banxii,2011-02-12T22:14Z,nvm thanks for the 4shared link

,banxii,2011-04-16T02:43Z,"hey shroo i got it to work and it works very nice. now my concern is how to fix when i go into sandbox>random map and after that the game crashes. Please anyone help, thank you."
,timrath,2011-04-24T18:36Z,"It works for me. 
It did crash the first time I tried to play the sandbox mode, but the second time it worked.
My only problem is that there is no sky (the sky is pitch black), and the ground is littered with little white cubes with pink letters ""F"" on them. Are there some textures missing?"
