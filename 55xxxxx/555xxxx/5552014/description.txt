        Cheryl returns from Spain and is shocked by the atmosphere   
        between Sasha and Lauren. Duncan feels like an outsider in   
        Ricky's life now that Kris is helping out at home. Steph     
        tells Jake about a vacancy for a gardening job at Hollyoaks  
        High. And Steph wants to forget all about Gilly; or does     
        she?
