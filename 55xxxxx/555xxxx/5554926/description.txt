ChÃ¡vez Ravine: A Record by Ry Cooder is a concept album and historical album by Ry Cooder which tells the story of ChÃ¡vez Ravine, a Mexican-American community demolished in the 1950s in order to build public housing. The housing was never built. Ultimately the Brooklyn Dodgers built a stadium on the site as part of their move to Los Angeles.
