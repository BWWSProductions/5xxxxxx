,dj2010mix,2010-05-13T22:03Z,"No viruses were detected, there all MP3's and no .exe extensions!"
,Krokodilliscious,2010-06-23T21:43Z,"Hmmm... a leecher screams virus, and the only one to respond is the original uploader saying it's not... That's like getting a movie review from the producer - not valid. 

Anyone that d/l'd this by now that can give some clarity???"
,Yaxxo,2010-07-10T12:33Z,"It\'s safe i think, i downloaded a single track of the cd first and my pc is still running. i will probably report again when finished downloading"
