,ycdfn,2011-03-17T09:19Z,Got caught downloading this. Try to avoid it.
,bhutan_6,2011-09-21T21:44Z,"I was also having problem. I have a Japanese NTSC 3.2j Wii, USB loader GX, IOS 249. Tried everything including Google search. Then I used ""disc default"" option instead ""force NTSC"" and now it is working fine. I have few other PAL games that needs Force NTSC option. Can't explain how this PAL game runs on my NTSC Wii without force NTSC. Great torrent though, thanks r3dcat. "
