,Renraku,2010-05-15T06:14Z,"Hi,
I have been having trouble viewing some 720p files lately (including this one).
I can get audio but the video is just grey (and VLC actually crashes).
It doesn't happen with all 720p files, just occasionally.
Has anyone else had this problem or have any ideas what it might be?

Thanks"
