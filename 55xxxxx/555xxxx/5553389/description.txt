This brand new four-part factual series for ITV1 sees Joanna Lumley travel the length of the River Nile from mouth to source. This epic journey, seen through the eyes of one of Britainâ€™s most treasured stars, encompasses the rich, varied history and contemporary daily life of the worldâ€™s longest river. From the luxury of Egypt and the searing heat of Sudan to the lush landscape of Ethiopia and the jungles of Rwanda, sumptuous shots of the richly varied territories coupled with Joannaâ€™s interaction with everyone she meets bring this rare expedition to life.
Joannaâ€™s travels introduce her to the riverâ€™s ancient history as well as the hard working people of modern day Egypt as she experiences the Nileâ€™s role as transport, life sustaining irrigation, or pure luxury holiday escapism. Viewers will share her curiosity as she interacts with the people of the Nile who depend on the great river for their livelihoods and wellbeing.

Part 1: Egypt
The actress embarks on an epic journey, exploring the world's longest river from sea to source. She begins her adventure on a fishing boat on Egypt's coast, where the Nile spills into the Mediterranean, before capturing the spirit of Agatha Christie in Cairo and enjoying a Nile cruise. She also travels along the river by train, road and felucca sailing boat, and ends the first part of her trip in Aswan, a town the Victorians described as being on the edge of civilisation.
