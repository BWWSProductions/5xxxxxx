,rorschach1234,2010-05-14T09:36Z,"Don't forget to turn off updates, otherwise it will nag you relentlessly to upgrade to the paid version 3. The advantage of this version is that it's the free version, other than that, not much."
,Tignus,2010-05-15T02:26Z,"The advantage over the widget is that you constantly have it under eyes and that you can therefore manage your CPU or bandwith use at any moment rather than popping up dashboard.

And yes turn off is recommended. Thanks for reminding."

,Tignus,2010-05-21T00:51Z,"You're welcome :)

I've been searching for this version on the internet for 45 min for a friend so when I found it I thought it would be a good idea to put it at everyone's disposal =)"
