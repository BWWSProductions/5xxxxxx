Andy Andrist - Dumb it Down for the Masses - 2006


Remember the first time your parents left you home alone and within the first hour you somehow found your way into your big brotherâ€™s 2 Live Crew albums, your dadâ€™s secret porn stash, and your momâ€™s flask of Goldschlager she kept hidden inside a pair of her fancy shoes she told you to never go near? Well, all innocence is once again re-lost as cerebral raunch-teur, Andy Andrist, awakens these repressed feelings of misguided-guilt-ridden-joy with overwhelmingly filth-ridden exorbitance on Stand Up! Records latest release "Dumb It Down For The Masses." Andrist offers the world an easy way to enjoy life and solve all of lifeâ€™s problems all in one CDâ€¦ by dumbing it downâ€¦ and drinkingâ€¦ a lot. Andrist invites his audience into a world of booze induced activities where real anarchy lives and retarded people are brought along for the fun of it and not just for a handicapped parking spot and purposes of political correctness. And, even though this CD in itself is a gift to society, make sure you stick around for the exclusive bonus track where Andrist imparts his priceless wisdom about gays and God onto an audience of Quakersâ€¦ seriously. And just like when you were left home alone for the first time, after listening to "Dumb It Down For The Masses," you might have to watch Sesame Street and force yourself to cry in order to regain your sweet childhood innocence and look your parents in the eye.
