The files work perfect on my mac (using iTunes) but I am unable to export to my iPhone. Opening the files they appear in the books section of iTunes. From there they can be copied to playlists etc. nnWhen opening my iPhone they are not on the sync books list (this is just for pdf books?). If a playlist contain just audio book files it does not show up on the sync music list. If it contains at least one other music file the play list can be synced, but the book files are ignored. I have of course tried the straight forward drag and drop to no avail. nnI do not want to download the mp3 version instead so if anyone could give me a pointer I would be grateful."

Audio books are under the books tab now. You won't see your books there because you have to scroll down and check ""Sync Audiobooks"". To my defense, it is not easy to see that the page continues down."

Thanks again!"
