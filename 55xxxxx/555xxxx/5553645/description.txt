Truly the Holy Grail of Hendrix videos, this is the film record of the Royal Albert Hall Perfomance by The Jimi Hendrix Experience in February 1969. Video quality varies, the camera work is late sixties awful but the performance is what is important. 
5.1 Dolby soundtrack is claimed to compensate for the visual experience. This DVD contains three tracks from the concert that were not filmed as audio extras with a slideshow acompanyment.
There is talk that Hendrix Experience (the company that owns Hendrix music) is putting out a DVD of this show sometime in the future.
It's only taken 40 years so no need to hurry. 

DVD cover artwork is included.
