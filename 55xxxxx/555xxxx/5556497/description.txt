Gentle Giant was a British progressive rock band active between 1970 and 1980. The band was notable for the particular complexity and sophistication of its musical material and for the diverse musical skills of its members (all of whom, bar the first two drummers, were accomplished multi-instrumentalists).

The band's onetime stated aim was to "expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of becoming very unpopular,although this stance was to alter significantly with time. While never achieving the commercial heights of progressive rock contemporaries such as Genesis, Yes or Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant was considered to be one of the most experimental bands in the genre (as well as one of the most experimental rock bands of the 1970s)

Gentle Giant's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swathe of music including folk, soul, jazz and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their "classical" influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated mediaeval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal events but from philosophy and the works of both FranÃ§ois Rabelais and R. D. Laing.

A favorite in underground prog-rock circles, Gentle Giant never quite broke through to the mainstream due to their unpredictability from album to album, ...    Full Descriptionand the fact that their experimental, envelope-pushing music often remained just outside the realm of commercial viability. All this only serves to make them more interesting in retrospect, and today they are recognized for having made some of the most interesting and progressive music of the 70s, combining rock, classical, blues, and avante-garde music with medieval, baroque vocals, and incorporating more than 30 instruments, to create a sonic experience like nothing else. This release features material from the height of the band's career in 1974-5, as they were poised on the brink of fame. Footage is included from concerts in Germany and Long Beach, plus rare television clips of interviews, and a photo gallery from member Gary Green's personal collection. Tracks include "Cogs in Cogs," "The Runaway," "Features From Octopus," "Experience," "Advent of Panurge," and "So Sincere."

Progressive rockers Gentle Giant never quite had the success of contemporaries like Yes or King Crimson, largely because they were so difficult to pin down, moving between the dangerously experimental and the commercially accessible. This concert, held in 1978 at London's Golders Green Hippodrome, includes such songs as "Just The Same," "Betcha Thought We Couldn't Do It," and "Funny Ways," as well as the "Octopus Medley," filmed for British TV's OLD GREY WHISTLE TEST.
