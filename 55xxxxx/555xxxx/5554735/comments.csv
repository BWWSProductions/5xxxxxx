,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T09:21Z,"ok
  i've found a crack"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T09:21Z,I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS BUT IT IS FOR THE .EXE  FILE
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T09:43Z,I can upload it for some minutes for you
,Daxe24,2010-05-12T10:40Z,"Wow, Thanks for this

Request: Aerosoft Fscommander updates or Fscommander 8.6"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T13:41Z,it wasn't actually a crack.It was a patch.I found it in frostwire and i realised that it was a mallware(witch your antivirous does not see).I'll try again to find one but i still need time.THIS SHIT IS UNCRACKABLE
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T13:46Z,LEVKOVV:i can reupload it if you want.Im not 100% sure that this is a mallware file.......
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T16:57Z,i really hate this when finaly something great coms out and you have to wait for crack so long and you can t play it i really hate this !!!!!!!!
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-12T17:28Z,"ive just dl'd the crack from kickass torrents, avg says it contains 2 trojans as it usually does with cracks but malwarebytes and eset nod32 both give clean scans so i say its not malware. avg always states any crack, patch or keygen as a trojan but it never is.
just need to wait for this to dl now to try the crack. has anyone tried the crack with success?"
,saci42,2010-05-12T17:37Z,"Thanks for the UP

Request : VRS Superbug X   - thanks :)"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T17:59Z,i suggest you to open it...Usually an .exe and a .dll are in the same folder AVG says trojan detected or something like that.If mallwarebytes and do not see this file as a virous then you don't have to worry.......OPEN IT
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T18:00Z,"***MALLWAREBYTES AND ESET


mistake...."
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T18:46Z,give us the crack i can t wait any longer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,maverick622011,2010-05-12T19:05Z,buy it like i did instead of waiting for a long time for it to come on here and maybe you'll might never crack it :)
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T19:08Z,it s not so easy you need master card and stuff 
,maverick622011,2010-05-12T19:14Z,You can get a pay as you go visa card from o2 www.o2.co.uk 
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T19:21Z,maverick622011: as you said you buy it is there any way to share your serial number here you think would it work ???
,maverick622011,2010-05-12T19:22Z,try installing an up to date direct x i read this in a post from there website 
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T19:23Z,levkovvvv : thank you wery much for the advice !!! let me know if you get that missing stuff on e mail please upload it here !! thanks in advance : )
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T20:10Z,i m getting an error message FSLOptions . DLL please ensure a proper instalation of product i ve used enable button and i restarted computer after the instalation help ???
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-12T20:46Z,"well i added the crack/patch to an old testing laptop, had to disable resident shield in AVG to be able to click on it and nothing noticable happened. i then reactivated resident shield and AVG went nuts saying the laptop was infected so i let it quarantine the infected files and it took around 12 .dll files from C: windows/syswow64 saying they were darkur. B trojan. 
so it dont look like a crack, why would a crack install into windows/syswow64? does that seem normal? after AVG had removed around 4 of the .dll files i got a pop up saying the patch had stopped running so whatever it is, it installed itself in that syswow64 folder and was running."
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T21:07Z,chuckmanuck:The same happened on me.Some dirty bastards are loading some virouses(usually mallwares) on those files in order to mess up your computer.Just for fun......Thatswhy we need to find a resident cracking tool which will be trustfull.....
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-12T21:45Z,"i agree with you there jim, dirty bastards indeed, they should be going after the faceless corporations, but the publics pc's are easy prey for them. i dont understand the mentality myself. luckilly everybody aint tried installing it.
we need something, wether its a cracking tool or a resident cracker. you got these guys cracking the latest games within a couple of days of release, mostly on the release date tho. teams like razor1911, reloaded, skidrow and skullptura. these guys are cracking the latest games with heavy online activation, the cracks bypass activation and the use of the cd/dvd that the original game is on. i'm sure these guys would make light work of our flight sim products if they got their hands on them.  "
,Jimstalk,2010-05-12T22:42Z,Ok then the only thing we need to do is to find them...........(Actually i don't know how)
,F.B.I,2010-05-12T23:19Z,guys would the fslabs.dll help????
,F.B.I,2010-05-12T23:20Z,send me your aircraft.config and panel. config files please (HOW DO I FIND THESE??????)
,F.B.I,2010-05-12T23:27Z,Guys the serial starts like this CONCORDEX-****-****-****-****-****
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T23:38Z,F.B.I: what about the rest of the digits ??
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T23:43Z,give us the full serial and save us the long waiting and so that we can start using the product !!!!!
,gamer2010,2010-05-12T23:51Z,f.b.i. where did you find that serial or part of the serial ???
,h00kw0rm,2010-05-13T00:30Z,"Got it installed and working for a few seconds:

Install the exe file while using the pmdg crack
Copy FBI's riped version over the installed plane files and select latest copy
If you try to start it now it will give you a civic.gau error (perhaps it needs restarting at this point)
Install Civic.gau available at avsim
Restart computer
It hangs a long time on resouce loader - if you get this just switch to missions and then back again
It still needs a s/n because the entry in the registry looks like vietnamese
I dont think this has to do with dll files

Hope this helps guys."
,hazzabhoy,2010-05-13T02:32Z,cant seem to find civic.gau in avsim any body help
,hazzabhoy,2010-05-13T02:42Z,cant find the civic.gau file at avsim can you link it ?
,h00kw0rm,2010-05-13T05:55Z,Concorde X likes this file: civa151.zip Page
,h00kw0rm,2010-05-13T05:56Z,http://www.simufly.com/ins/include/civa151.zip
,h00kw0rm,2010-05-13T05:58Z,It is still asking for the seriel number and it is stored in the registry.
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T08:08Z,Guys its very complicated.I have only one question.The serial can be used only once or not.If not then give it to us dude
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T08:11Z,"The pmdg crack doesn't work on me.I think that this crack doesn't actually work in win7(i can't install any of the pmd products)..........

JIM:)"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T08:39Z,"srry i had to run as administrator no problem////After installing and restarting i wanted to have a quick look at the panel of one of the concorde models and look what i found{everything is in zero(0).Is this normal??

,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T08:40Z,AND MUCH MORE......
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T09:50Z,"as i said i installed with the pmdg crack and everything was working fine.The vc had no problems i could see the landing gear...(i installed concorde and civic.gau).After 10 secs fsx crashes and appears the following error.''YOUR SERIAL NUMBER COULD NOT BE VALIDATED''(something like that.
CONCLUSION:GIVE US THE S/N.

OK READ THIS.I found it in the rip you uploaded:
'No personal information is kept, other than
    purchase information and verification of licensing.''"
,moonrider53,2010-05-13T09:55Z,"Got it to work, just 30 seconds.
Everything is working, engines are starting up, then....You need a valid serial, FSX will now exit.
So it all comes to the darn serial, nuttin more.
Crack or keymaker is needed, or the serial."
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T10:18Z,FSLoptions.dll is the problem.This one is like the PMDGoptions.dll.We need someone to remake this dll (like in the PMDG 747 in order to play you had yo copy/paste and then overwrite  the cracked PMDGoptions.dll) in order to avoid this pop-up window wich crashes your fsx.there are many ways to play.F.B.I can give us the serial but if does not want upload it in public view then we need to make a keygen.......
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T10:19Z,srry 4 the mistakes i'm typing too fast

,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T10:52Z,It can't be so difficult.We're missing something...
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T14:24Z,I wonder why is he not giving us the fucking serial
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T15:05Z,the only thing we need to do is to avoid somehow this error pop-up message which crashes your fsx.The problem with the gauges has been solved now this is the difficult part.......CRACKING DLL's
,Jimstalk,2010-05-13T15:07Z,I think that alla of you know the hacker Komu(kommunitta).He's hacking fsx add-ons so we need to find him

,gamer2010,2010-05-15T22:43Z,no level d is diferent its more realistic but itsh hard to crack cls products were newer hard to crack or the serial was provided anyway i m using cls products thnx i hope you find it :)
,Beaver221,2010-05-16T02:02Z,ok to get everything to show up i installed it using the enable button and then to get rid of and also add the RIP file stuff from FBI then downloaded CIVA.gau file to get rid of that error.(http://www.sstsim.com/resources/files.php) still getr a lis error after a few sec in the sim but gauages show

,gamer2010,2010-05-16T22:21Z,jimstalk: yes the boeing is better but the airbuses fmc is easy to configure the boeing s is much harder at least for me
,gamer2010,2010-05-16T22:44Z,i will preffer 747-200 twa for wich airline are you flying ?
,Jimstalk,2010-05-17T09:09Z,gamer2010:Sorry dude i cant give you specific info.....The only thing i can tell you  is that its a well known european airline......Now about the fmc's i agree with you boeing's fmc's are complicated but i don't judge an airplane from it's fmc's..............
,theropod,2010-05-17T09:45Z,hi jimstalk! is the vrs superhornet seems to be far away to be cracked?
,Jimstalk,2010-05-18T12:49Z,TPB was down for a while huh???Again courts/......
,Jimstalk,2010-05-18T19:24Z,u mean superbug......Ok i'll have a look.I've seen the screenshots//the cockpit is just amazing.......
,gamer2010,2010-05-18T20:23Z,hey jim how was your flight 
,theropod,2010-05-18T21:59Z,yes jimstalk vrs superbug is most realistic f-18 for fsx! it had been worked for 6 years to make it real. it has very complicated systems. you can shoot all the planes. you can find everything about it from vrsimulations web site. a must have true addon. thanks
,Jimstalk,2010-05-18T22:06Z,"I cannot say it was perfecT:very smooth landings but flying accross tthe bermuda triangle isn't the best experience.The weather was fine(light clouds/temp at 10-28C/12kts wind in europe).Now about U.S.A.....thunderstorms but nowadays its very simple fly accross a thunderstorm....95% of the flight is beeing made by the AP(autopilot)...The only thing we do is taking  off,''pressing switches'' and land...............AND THAT WAS!!!!!


I LOVE MY JOB!!!!   JIM:))))"

,Jimstalk,2010-05-19T09:21Z,"@fsxdude98

GO to tpb main page and click on the large icon....There's all the information you need....Now about the manual landing.After the 2  ''before landing'' accidents (i think you've heard about them...)which have been caused due to the autolanding we have to make manual landings.I was working for my country's air force for 8 years.....I didn't actually know how to autoland.This is ridicullus bt i've learned it from Flight simulator........LOL
