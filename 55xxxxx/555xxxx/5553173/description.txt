The Self-titled Album from Math Rockers 'This Town Needs Guns'.
The sound is different to their Debut aldum [Animals] owing to the Piano on most tracks and Distortion on some tracks, especially 'It's Not True Rufus, Don't Listen To The Hat'.

Standout tracks are 26 Is Dancier Than 4, 1470 Man and It's Not True Rufus, Don't Listen To The Hat

The guitars are amazing, Frantic when they need to be and soft and moving at just the right times.

Similar to Tubelord, Foals, Haisuinonasa and Cinema Staff.

Enjoy! Please seed for others!
