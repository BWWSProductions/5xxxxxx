I had a few of her albums in the early 90's but had forgotten how good she was.
I burnt your last 2 Black Triangles onto 1 CD and it sounds awesome.

regards, fendermental"

If I get anything new and it hasn't already been uploaded in FLAC, I will upload.  I know there's at least one greatest hits in FLAC.  I was thinking it might be nice to have ""Live From Earth"" in flac...that one has Love is a Battlefield on it.  I wish they had released that song on Tropico."
