"The Beaver Trilogy," released all together in 2000, comprises three vignettes about the same subject: a young man from the small town of Beaver,  Utah who is obsessed with Olivia  Newton-John. 

The first piece,"The Beaver Kid" (1979) is a documentary. 

The second piece, "Beaver Kid 2" (1981) is a dramatic work based on the documentary, starring Sean Penn in the title role. 

The third piece, "The Orkly Kid" (1985) is yet another dramatic work based on the documentary, this time starring Crispin Glover, and this time in color.

Has never been officially released due to unlicensed use of Olivia Newton-John songs, but Trent Harris sells copies of the DVD on his website.

I found a copy of one of these DVDs at a rental store several years ago, and ripped it, just for myself, but since it was taken down from the yutoobs I haven't really seen it on the internet, so I decided to make a torrent.
