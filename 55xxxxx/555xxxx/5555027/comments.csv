,justregged,2010-05-13T02:31Z,"any chance of a decent encode of the movie 21grams, the 700meg rips out there are a bit pixelated, not worried about file size as long as its decent quality, thanks in advance"
,thepunisher65,2010-05-13T06:06Z,well i have a source of that movie but it's pixelated as well... apart from that...there are blu rays from where i had problems encoding....so 21 grams' good source for DVD aint there.
