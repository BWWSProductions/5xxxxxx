It's clearly been upscaled from standard definition, making the high res release pointless, and to add injury to insult, there are no extras in this set, not even commentaries. You can read people complaining about it at Amazon:

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-21T08:16Z,"Thank you, by the way :)"
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-05-23T20:38Z,Thanks for the tip Kickass. Makes me happy people can download this now rather than get RIPPED OFF!
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-28T17:43Z,"Well, sorry for bitchin', and I should add that the episodes in this set that were actually produced after the show went 16:9 aspect ratio and HD are absolutely pristine in this download, so again, the rip here is perfect, and you won't be dissapointed about the rip quality ;)"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-28T17:44Z,"You always forget to mention that it's DTS audio, so that's perfect, too :)"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-28T17:47Z,"So... to sum it up: From episode 10 and onwards, this is 100% HD, from 1-9 it's upscaled (but still better SD quality than anything else out there). Audio is DTS. The rip itself is perfect. No extras, no nothing, not the ripper's fault. I would get this :)"
,theass14,2010-08-06T21:39Z,pretty good
,modemslayer2,2011-12-30T07:49Z,Thanks for this! I'll seed as much as I can once it's fully downloaded at the moment it's going decent with 11 hours to go.
