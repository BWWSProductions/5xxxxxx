
Extras offers 26 B-sides, rarities and unreleased tracks that, while far from complete (the wonderful 'See Saw' is absent, for instance), is a fan's dream come true. 
This is a fans' album, to be sure, but for fans, the never-before-heard demos (like 'Burning Sky' and 'Thick As Thieves') have a certain spine-tingling effect, and the covers (like 'So Sad About Us,' 'And Your Bird Can Sing,' and 'Disguises') are undeniably fun - often more so than the covers they chose to include on the proper albums. 
Extras is not a good introduction, to be sure, but for the converted, this is essential. (AMG)
