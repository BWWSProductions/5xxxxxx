"CHUCK VERSUS THE TOOTH" 

Chuck (Zachary Levi) struggles with disturbing dreams 
and now he believes his most recent dream predicts 
danger for a visiting head of state. General Beckman 
(Bonita Friedericy), however, is unconvinced and 
assigns Chuck to meet with a CIA psychiatrist Dr. Leo 
Dreyfus (guest star Christopher Lloyd). Meanwhile, 
Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) gets surprising news and Anna 
(guest star Julia Ling) returns to the Buy More to 
talk to Morgan (Joshua Gomez).
