SINOPSE:

Perhaps the most startlingly authentic portrayal of a love affair ever filmed, AFTER SEX is a funny, taboo-breaking film about passion and obsession, which swoops from the euphoric heights of a sexually charged romance to its tempestuous aftermath.

Brigitte RoÃ¼an stars as Diane, a forty-year old book editor with a successful career, a loving husband and two adorable children. During a visit with one of her writers, she meets Emilio (Boris Terral), an exotically seductive engineer in his twenties who ignites Diane's life with passion and turns her world upside down.
