I see a heading for a new show and I get all excited.. until I realize it's from British television. One thing it seems the English simply can not do is make an even halfway decent television show."
,Abductor,2010-05-14T20:31Z,"You're thinking of Canadian television. :p

England has a lot of crap but some awesome stuff.

Wire in the Blood
Life on Mars
Doctor Who (well, before this season)
QI
Fawlty Towers

Just to name a few."
