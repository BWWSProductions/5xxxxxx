      Tawni  tries  to ban gum from the set, even though Sonny has a ritual
      of  chewing  gum  just before going on stage. Meanwhile, Chad invites
      Nico and Grady to exercise in his personal gym as a ploy to use their
      workouts to power his new "green" dressing room.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      For Frequently Asked Questions please read the included FAQ README.
      
      Any  show  that I decide to cap by request I will not keep either the
      source  or  the  converted  file.  The  torrent is deleted after full
      distribution  and  seeding.  I  distribute 2 full copies and keep the
      torrent  for  a  week  but don't count on a reseed after 2 weeks, the
      torent  will be deleted to make room for other content. It will be up
      to  everyone  in the swarm to keep these alive for the next person in
      line. 

      
      For  those who  have trouble  playing the episodes I recommend  using
      another  player  such  as  KMPlayer  which  is free and uses it's own
      Built-in codecs, plays almost everything and is loaded with features.
            
      These are NMT Compatible. These episodes should play with no problems
      on most Networked Media Tanks and other similar players.

      More Seeders=More Speed for the next person downloading
      No Seeders means the torrent dies so please seed back.
