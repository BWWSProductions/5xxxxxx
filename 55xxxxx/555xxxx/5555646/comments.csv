,Rexxxor,2010-05-19T08:10Z,In which folder are the files that have to be copied over? I can't find them...
,Rexxxor,2010-05-19T15:21Z,"Never mind, I just had to copy the Data folder to the installation folder even though the Data folder didn't exist yet. You aren't replacing anything, unlike the .nfo file instructs."
,Reaki,2010-05-20T21:48Z,"Um nuked?

Installed Tropico 3
Game ran no problem.
Installed this, copied the cracked folder not only into every game folder I found + instalation folder, but also into proper documents/roaming location.
Same result, not working."
,Bullseye150,2010-05-21T08:27Z,"Serial doesn't work for me, says it's wrong and then it takes me to some site."
,Bullseye150,2010-05-21T08:30Z,"nvm, i was just clicking the serial, and writing it with the S:, which was wrong

figured it out"
,Reaki,2010-05-21T11:17Z,"Ok if anyone has problems with instalation, try forcing recheck. Some fuck is seeding corrupted data.

Works. Just copy data folder into your tropico 3 folder and you are golden."
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-06-21T13:19Z,I need to insert a serial. Where is it?
,ciuuwb,2010-06-27T11:50Z,"i just copied the Data folder in to the game directory and used RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR as serial as it says in the serial screen.

confusing but it works"

I think thats a bug"
,Sjieg,2010-07-20T20:09Z,"Win 7 (64 bit):
- Installed: Tropico 3 MULTI5 ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5110059/Tropico_3_%5BMULTI5%5D%5BPCDVD%5D.iso )
- Installed this torren directly after it
- Copied the data folder (From iso/crack/ ) to the game folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\Tropico 3).
Downloaded D3DX9_41.dll (google: D3DX9_41.dll tropico 3) and copied it into windows/system & windows/system32 folder.
- Start Tropico3.exe and written out the serial: RRRRR-RR... etc. (NOTE: Write it out, dont click the already written serial).
- Wait a few seconds and you are ready to play."
,rizell2004,2010-08-02T11:39Z,"Finally I was able to installed & play it!There wasn't any direction on how to install it so I just read all the comments on 3 torrents site.Geez, It was pretty hard to install it when there's no step by step. ^_^ here's what I did.
Instructions: 
 1. downloaded the following: tropico 3,tropico 3 absolute power, the 3 patches which is v1 04, v1 09 v1 13 (just google it I downloaded it from herepiratebay in Skidrow files)

2. Unrar everything 1st 

3. (turn off internet) Install tropico 3, then copy the v1 04 then click the following c:/local disk/program files/Kalypso/tropico 3(u paste that over tropico 3 folder it'll replace the tropico 3 exe.) do the same thing with the rest of the patch until u get v1 13.after u do that don't run it yet.

4. then install tropico 3 absolute power(which is this file) by running set up, then there is this file that reads Crack in the tropico 3 absolute power file.

5. click the crack folder then copy Data folder then click c:/localdisk/program files/kalypso/tropico 3 paste over it and it will add the data inside the folder.

6. And there is an AddOn folder included in the tropico 3 absolute power when u had it unrar, if u want to copy and paste it on the same location where u added the data file, u can do it but I didn't do that on mine. just some additional voice language I think so I didn't add it on.

7. okey last. remember off internet!(oh also check that c:/local disk/program files/ kalypso/tropico 3/ tropico 3 exe is version 2.0.467.35562 ) 

8. run the tropico 3 exe then u'll see the S:RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR type it in the line don't include the S: and there u go, ur set to play just wait for it. 
Hope it helps! I did this on my laptop which is window vista."

,romulan2010,2010-09-05T19:36Z,"Guys i solved
So what you need to do is like thise:
Like rizell2004 say

1. downloaded the following: tropico 3,tropico 3 absolute power, the 3 patches which is v1 04, v1 09 v1 13 (just google it I downloaded it from herepiratebay in Skidrow files)

2. Unrar everything 1st

3. (turn off internet) Install tropico 3, then copy the v1 04 then click the following c:/local disk/program files/Kalypso/tropico 3(u paste that over tropico 3 folder it'll replace the tropico 3 exe.) do the same thing with the rest of the patch until u get v1 13.after u do that don't run it yet.

4. then install tropico 3 absolute power(which is this file) by running set up, then there is this file that reads Crack in the tropico 3 absolute power file.

5. click the crack folder then copy Data folder then click c:/localdisk/program files/kalypso/tropico 3 paste over it and it will add the data inside the folder.

6. And there is an AddOn folder included in the tropico 3 absolute power when u had it unrar, if u want to copy and paste it on the same location where u added the data file, u can do it but I didn't do that on mine. just some additional voice language I think so I didn't add it on.

7. okey last. remember off internet!(oh also check that c:/local disk/program files/ kalypso/tropico 3/ tropico 3 exe is version 2.0.467.35562 )

8. run the tropico 3 exe then u'll see the S:RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR type it in the line don't include the S: and there u go, ur set to play just wait for it. 

But wen you instal a expansion you are automaticly selected buy the destination C:\Program Files\Kalypso\tropico 3 so you need to instal original game to the same directory so it can owerite Tropico 3 files. Then you coppy crack and it is game start with serial :D only that and it works fine."

,HRGHQ,2010-10-15T20:00Z,"Windows 7:

To avoid that the game and the expansion have to be installed in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\Tropico 3"" you can create a junction point link:

A. Before you install the game, create the folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso""

B. Create the folder where you REALLY want the game to be installed, e.g. ""E:\Games\Tropico 3""

C. Create a junction point link in an elevated command prompt before you install the game:

mklink ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\Tropico 3"" ""E:\Games\Tropico 3"" /j

D. Install the game to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\Tropico 3"""

If you have Tropico 3, this is a MUST download. It improves the game greatly!

If you want to install it in a folder of choice, follow HRGHQ's steps. Thanks for that!

The only thing you have to remember is to turn off your connection / block it with firewall the first time you have to enter the serial. After that, you are clear to inspire your people!"
