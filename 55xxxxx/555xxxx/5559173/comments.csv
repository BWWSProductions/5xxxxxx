Once I press ok it comes back up and then after pressing ok again it dissapears.

Bridge opens and works perfectly it just photoshop thats doing this.

Any idea on what i can do it fix this.

Cheers"

One guy said this download was so bad that he had to reformat his hard drive.  I am finding EMBRACE files in my AppData and the registry and they shouldn't be.  Got rid of them and my computer stopped quirking out.  Notice most all EMBRACE torrents have keygens?  If you antivirus goes off with these torrents, it's for real.  "
,kathykat63,2010-05-25T13:52Z,Forgot to mention!  Get this one off of thethingy.  He has all of the CS5 programs loaded  His torrents are all fantastic.  He responds to comments.  No kegens and no problems.

A keygen doesn't need to do this...

keygen.exe->(WExtract)->setup.exe->(nsis-1-mdbg.exe)
file:C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\mdbg.exe
regkey:HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\RUN\\MDBG
runkey:HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\RUN\\MDBG"
