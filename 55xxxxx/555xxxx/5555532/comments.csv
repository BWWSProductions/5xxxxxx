,yyywww111,2010-05-28T11:17Z,"Ok, this game is a bastard to install, so here's a step-by-step guide.

1: (MAY NOT BE REQUIRED) move your ""Kalypso"" folder to ""C:/programfiles(x86)""

2: Mount/burn the downloaded file

3: Copy ""addon"" folder CONTENTS to C:/programfiles(x86)/kalypso/tropico3

4: Run the .exe inside the moved contents

5: Run the mounted/burnt game

6: Once installed run game as usual, enter serial and wait 10 seconds for login

7: Enjoy game


Thanks for the release Dj"
,ZoolooCH,2010-06-02T13:54Z,"The trick is to copy the ""data"" folder, NOT the ""crack"" folder. If you copy the cracked content inside the ""crack"" folder, then it won't be recognised. I did this the first time, and the serial didn't work, but by cutting and pasting the ""data"" folder into the ""Kaypso""\""tropica"" folder, I was able to log in. "

,rizell2004,2010-08-02T11:48Z,"Finally I was able to installed & play it! Took me almost the whole day.There wasn't any direction on how to install it so I just read all the comments on 3 torrents site. whew! It was pretty hard to install it when there's no step by step direction. ^_^ here's what I did.
Instructions:
1. downloaded the following: tropico 3,tropico 3 absolute power, the 3 patches which is v1 04, v1 09 v1 13 (just google it I downloaded it from here piratebay in Skidrow files)

2. Unrar everything 1st

3. (turn off internet) Install tropico 3, then copy the v1 04 then click the following c:/local disk/program files/Kalypso/tropico 3(u paste that over tropico 3 folder it'll replace the tropico 3 exe.) do the same thing with the rest of the patch until u get v1 13.after u do that don't run it yet.

4. then install tropico 3 absolute power(which is this file) by running set up, then there is this file that reads Crack in the tropico 3 absolute power file.

5. click the crack folder then copy Data folder then click c:/localdisk/program files/kalypso/tropico 3 paste over it and it will add the data inside the folder.

6. And there is an AddOn folder included in the tropico 3 absolute power when u had it unrar, if u want to copy and paste it on the same location where u added the data file, u can do it but I didn't do that on mine. just some additional voice language I think so I didn't add it on.

7. okey last. remember off internet!(oh also check that c:/local disk/program files/ kalypso/tropico 3/ tropico 3 exe is version 2.0.467.35562 )

8. run the tropico 3 exe then u'll see the S:RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR-RRRRR type it in the line don't include the S: and there u go, ur set to play just wait for it.
Hope it helps! I did this on my laptop which is window vista."

,Sap_ru,2011-07-16T15:51Z,This game contains a virus in crack and setup-file.
,Sap_ru,2011-07-16T15:55Z,"Ooopsss. Sorry, wrong thread. There is NO VIRUS in this release. I'm sorry once more."
