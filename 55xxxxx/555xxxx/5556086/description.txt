Plot:

Alexander Pichushkin charted his crimes on a chessboard, attaching a number and a coin to each square every time he struck. By the time he was caught, Pichushkin had filled in sixty-two of the sixty-four squares. Most of the victims were elderly men whom he lured with the promise of a drink. In a televised interview, Pichushkin calmly bragged about his passion for killing.
