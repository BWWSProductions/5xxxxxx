            Summary        
                                     
                                        
                                                                  
                                                                     
         History Channel. The marauding mercenary of English           
         folklore is one of history's best-known tales, and the        
         legend of Robin Hood is the inspiration for more movies,      
         radio and TV programs than any other folk hero. But the       
         image of a hero in tights and a feathered cap is a somewhat   
         recent addition to the myth. In reality, Robin Hood is a      
         composite of several historical figures whose exploits date   
         back to the age of the Crusades. In the film Robin Hood,      
         starring Russell Crowe, director Ridley Scott's production    
         is based on the most solid and recent historical research     
         into the character and promises a startlingly fresh           
         interpretation of Robin Hood for a new generation. This       
         special will distinguish between historical evidence and      
         Hollywood fiction, and seek to create a realistic portrait    
         of the mythical hero. Includes clips from the film as well    
         as interviews with director Scott, principal Robin Hood       
          cast members and renowned historians.
