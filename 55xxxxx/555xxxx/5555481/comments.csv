,rettOpp,2010-05-12T20:05Z,This is NOT the real movie 2010!!!!
,scorp123,2010-05-12T22:27Z,@rettOpp:  It clearly says in the description that this is a documentary from the History Channel. So _OF COURSE_ it is not the 2010 movie. Duh.

[T],dramacore,2010-05-23T05:05Z,"i was hoping for something more informative, but 5 minutes in and this is littered with hollywood promotion. i honestly wasnt even aware of the 2010 movie, just thought it would be interesting to hear about the folklore.  lots of movie clips in here and perspective on robin hood from the actors in it.. meh.  thanks for the share though, good quality rip."

Thanks for the upload TvTeam; this looks very interesting!"
