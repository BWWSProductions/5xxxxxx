Aaron Karo (born June 18, 1979) is an American  stand-up comedian and author best known for his email column Ruminations, his web site Ruminations.com, and his books Ruminations on College Life, Ruminations on Twentysomething Life, and Iâ€™m Having More Fun Than You.

In September 1997, as a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Karo sent a humorous email about college to twenty of his friends. That email spawned a regular â€œemail columnâ€ called Ruminations on College Life that Karo began sending on a regular basis. Through forwarding and word-of-mouth, the column spread and readers began subscribing to receive the column directly. Karo continues to write the column, now entitled simply Ruminations, to this day. It is published every other Monday and has now been read by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.

On July 10, 2002, Karo made his stand-up comedy debut at Stand-Up New York in New York City. He currently headlines shows across the country.

In August 2002, Simon & Schuster published a collection of Karoâ€™s columns, also entitled Ruminations on College Life.

In May 2005, Simon & Schuster published Karoâ€™s second book, Ruminations on Twentysomething Life, a collection of Karoâ€™s post-college columns.

In September 2007, Karo celebrated the tenth anniversary of his Ruminations column by publishing several special editions, including a Greatest Hits issue and a glossary of terms coined in the column.

In August 2008, Karo announced the launch of Ruminations.com, a user-generated humor site that allows fans to write their own â€œruminationsâ€ and share them with the community.

On August 15, 2008, Karo performed on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on CBS.

On December 9, 2008, Comedy Central Records released Karo's latest stand-up album Just Go Talk to Her. The album reached as high as number eight on the iTunes Comedy bestseller list.

On September 15, 2009, HarperCollins published Karoâ€™s third book, Iâ€™m Having More Fun Than You. Described as a "tribute to modern bachelorhood," the book reached number one on Amazon.comâ€™s humor bestseller list.
