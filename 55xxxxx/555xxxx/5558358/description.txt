"Spil for livet" is a competition for young musicians 
playing classical music arranged by danish television (DR).

This is the finale, where the three best from each category
play with the DR National Symphony Orchestra. There are some
presentations and talking in danish, but most of the content 
is music.

They are all extremely talented...
