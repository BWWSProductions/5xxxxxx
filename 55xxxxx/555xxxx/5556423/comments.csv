,wcccmh,2010-05-27T08:55Z,"I dont know how to mount the .mir file, can you please help me."
,leogo188,2010-05-29T02:10Z,You Have To Have Magic Disk And Mount It To A Virtual Drive
,leogo188,2010-05-29T05:51Z,Magic Disc**** Sorry Not Magic Disk
,smash4686,2010-05-30T00:56Z,Doesn't work on Windows 7. I guess updating it makes the crack void.
,leogo188,2010-06-02T23:28Z,I Dont Have A Problem Running It On Vista Or Windows 7 All You Have To Do Is Under The Prefs For The Exe File You Run It As A Windows Xp Program
,uploader22,2010-06-12T11:10Z,it doesnt work on windows 7
,leogo188,2010-06-16T22:40Z,works for me no problem
,supanut,2010-07-03T04:17Z,"Guys it works on Windows 7 I had tried another torrent and it works on Windows 7 w/o running it in compatibility mode.
For those that complain it didn't, you didn't install it correctly."
,acer1984,2010-07-16T22:36Z,"Hey I followed your instructions, but I guess I must have got lost somewhere, this is the first time I\'ve downloaded a file such as this. I can\'t seem to get the game to play, I\'ve mounted all the discs for the installation, but the trouble seems to be with the .mir file. I used Magic ISo and it did turn from the .mir file into an icon with the cd picture. However, I\'m not sure what you mean by mounting this file because it\'s asking for Disc One to be inserted. I don\'t know I was hoping you could help me sort this out"
,Sanctun,2010-07-27T10:02Z,hey there! i'm also having terrible troubles! have a windows 7 as well. it looks like the crack is not working either
,Kattie036,2010-10-09T17:23Z,"When i tryed to mount it with MagicDisc, it didnt work, but with Daemontools it worked perfectly!!!
When you are finish whit the instalaton, you just mont Disc/CD 1 and play!!!
Thank you for this amazing torrent!!!"
,Make-it-happen,2010-11-18T15:46Z,"It isn't working for me, I have vista and it always gives me an error(unspecified error or insert the correct cd-rom) I've done everything what your instruction said, but still not working. I even tried to mount the necessary files with different programs such as magic iso, daemon tools and power iso. Can't understand what's the problem."
,gamesfortime,2011-11-01T10:34Z,"Hi!I installed the game but what i need to do with the crack?I copied the sims2.exe into the ea games/sims 2 folder,and what i do now?There isn't any ""crack folder"" in what i can mount the .mir file,and without crack i can't make it run without cd,please tell me what to do,ty!"
