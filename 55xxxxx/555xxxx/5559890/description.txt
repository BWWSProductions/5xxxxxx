A collaboration between the Yes singer and other like-minded musicians, IN ELVEN LANDS is a celebration of the mythical worlds of J.R. Tolkien, featuring an imagining of Elvish music using medieval instruments, early music techniques, and Elvish and Anglo-Saxon lyrics. There's also a cover of Led Zeppelin's "The Battle of Nevermore," done in typically archaic style.

Beginning in 1999, a small fellowship of recording artists from New Zealand including Caitlin Elizabeth & Adam Pike on lead & backing vocals, using musicological techniques, set out to reconstruct the music of Tolkien's lost civilizations. After seven years of work, they have brought to light the living music of Tolkien's mythical worlds. It features four songs from guest artist, Jon Anderson ( Yes). 16 tracks.
