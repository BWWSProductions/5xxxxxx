Since the 2006 release of the groundbreaking 'Live In: Nerd Rage' album, Brian Posehn has found fame on TV (The Sarah Silverman Program), co-wrote 'The Last Christmas' Comic Book, appeared in several movies and supplies his voice in Rob Zombie's animated 'The Haunted World of El Superbeasto' but he never forgot his first two loves, metal and stand up. Posehn has never been more hilarious than on 'Fart & Weiner Jokes,' the new release featuring two more thrashing songs with his all-star band. Brian Posehn is the Slayer of comedy!
