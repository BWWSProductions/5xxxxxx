,heroin99,2010-11-09T02:14Z,"@kasijatis Many people (inluding me) had the same problem as you have. The game would crash to desktop after intro movie. 

You need to install the all the latest updates... BUT THERE IS NOW A NEW PROBLEM...

The game won't start and gives a ""Launcher error"". The good folk at digitalzone know about it and are working on a fix.

You could register at official forums, http://forum.digitalpowered.net and check when the fix is released.

Atm there's no way to play DZ's L4D2 with the passing and sacrifice addons. :("
