- Can Box Music (Live 1971-77) -

I don't want to talk it down, but...

As an item of a limited and out of print box-set, containing the band's history, interviews, reviews, photos and videos, this 2CD-set includes (different from its misleading title) live recordings from 1972 until 1977, compiled from cassettes and other non-professional fan recordings under professional mastering conditions.
The sound quality of these often self-indulgent live performances is sadly not on par with what we usually expect from an official release. This applies especially to the second disc.
It's not recommended as a starting point for newcomers. They should better begin with one of Can's early studio albums.
Clearly for fans and completionists!
