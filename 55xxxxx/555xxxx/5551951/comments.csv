Enable the exchange of the bytes received (uncap your upload) or I'll be forced to delete this torrent due to improper behavior of peers.

You have 60 minutes to take cold shower or to go someplace else."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-11T11:30Z,"yes guys why don't you share huh? is it so hard to keep upload to unlimited huh?

anyway share more if you want to get more.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-11T12:01Z,"Yeah pluto, I love when guys from Scandinavia or Western Europe bitch about upload. Jon4fun have last week wrote about that. Currently, I have 42% percent of such peers - who doesn't know that their speed-limits are checked and negotiated during the ""handshake"" with any other peer - and - what they have bought (which ""package"") from their ISP is publicly available fact.

And the rest... LOL... guys who have ""dsl"" in their host names tried to sell me a story ""I am on slow connection - puhleese..."".
Yeah... slow it is if you have set the upload to others at 3 kB/s and call yourself ""the leeching beast"".
Leech is a small creature. Small and vulnerable."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-11T13:05Z,MY connection is pretty slow but all the torrents are always set to unlimited.. Now who get much much speed hats none of my problem but yeah i seed around 12-14 hours per day.. and just asking how can you know their packages? 
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-13T11:18Z,"YES, I am sure
and
NO ONE on this planet can have cable or DSL/ADSL with 1000kB/s dl combined with 3 kB/s ul, right?

Further, @signalboy, run Vuze for example, set speed settings on Auto and - name of your ISP would appear with EXACT ul/dl speed one bought. Magic? Further, you have tools (programs) to do that. Great deal of them is available from times BEFORE the Windows. I am on-line from 1998. and have bought my first computer '84. Past century. So, I COULD be right, isn't?"
,Smirfana,2010-05-14T00:21Z,"twentyforty: why do you tell signalboy that you are right when you don't know what connection he/she has? Myself I have a 25/10 line and when I dl at full I will of course not have a share ratio over 0,5 before I have fully dl the file.

I always leave my torrents going after I have fully dl a file but still I almost always have been dl more than ul cause of my bandwith. Further more, if you use a private ip service as Ipredator to be anonymous you don't always get the bandwith you have from your ISP.

Sure, there are a lot of leechers out but don't say that ppl are dumb, stupid or wrong just because you think you are right. Get some fact, then shout."
