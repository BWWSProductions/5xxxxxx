,astuz,2010-05-11T11:22Z,Yes it does. but it depends on what graphic card you have and how much memory you have.
,astuz,2010-05-11T11:35Z,It really depends on what graphics card you have. if you have after market crap then good luck! but if you actually know what your doing then yes.

,astuz,2010-05-28T18:31Z,and just because your a noob does not mean you can chastize someone elses work. i had this OS for 5 months now and not a damn thing wrong with it.
,eddie864,2010-06-09T17:26Z,Astuz.  Can I boot from this and fix a damaged installation?  Powercut has killed my Win 7 boot
,pwnerman,2010-06-10T04:29Z,hey could you please help me i downloaded this and it says when i go to the setup that its a bad image and its not designed for windows im running vista service pack 2 right now could you plz help me thank you
,jayno4,2010-06-13T06:17Z,Can i upgrade to this from vista home premium 
,astuz,2010-06-13T07:34Z,you can burn this to iso then boot from it. then you can also make a clean!!! installation which is highly recommended. and in order to upgrade from vista home premium you need sp2 to do so. and i am telling you this is not damaged in any way.
,jayno4,2010-06-13T08:18Z,k so all i need is sp 2 and i can upgrade with out loosing data. also what do i do with the activator.
,xXMRLDDXx,2010-06-27T10:00Z,burn it to a disc then boot from it
,astuz,2010-06-30T11:41Z,okay it is highly not recommended to upgrade but if you want to go for it but i warn you that it will transfer problems from your old installation into the new installation.. 
,Squrl,2010-07-02T21:07Z,"@GenoOrlando13 I had the same problem, and I am not a ""noob"".  Not a hacker nor computer guru but I know my way around my comp.  Try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5268148/Windows_7_Ultimate(32__amp__64_bit)_Self_Activation_-_Jz  Works much better but make sure you have a valid key first.  If you don't, then in 3 days it will tell you its not valid. Unless you never update it.  I got a valid key for $39 US @  http://www.licensekeycity.com/ You will have to google how to change your product key though.  "
,Proxl,2010-08-31T23:02Z,"i spent all my day downloading this ""w7 32bit"" n doesnt work at all.... highly highly NOT recommended.... it has an error ""winload.exe"" i i burn it like 4 times n none works!  "
,lanec42,2010-10-04T02:31Z,"Yeah winload.exe is fucked. (I'm running it under Parallels).

tl;dr, don't download."
,pianoman420,2010-10-10T20:51Z,anyone who cant do this is a fucking noob.
,astuz,2010-10-13T21:23Z,wow if  you cant figure out how to burn to ISO to dvd you need to go to youtube to learn the tutorials and learn how. and to fix the boot you can run the repair from the disk and open command prompt and i think the command is bootrec or bootfix and if you say that this is not working then why am i able to use it. exactly.... so stfu noobs.
