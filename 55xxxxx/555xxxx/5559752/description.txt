[color=cyan]Notes::::::::::::::::::[/color]
well this, R5 Is pretty damn good, prolly one of the best r5's in a longtime, quality is really, nice..
also for such a early release. Changed colors slightly lowering green a bit, changing shadows and background
colours, tried a new filter not tried before...so it's just a test...added .avs sharpness script, keeping
noise to a minimum, not wanting to oversharp...Audio is STUDIO, and AC3 Enjoy!
