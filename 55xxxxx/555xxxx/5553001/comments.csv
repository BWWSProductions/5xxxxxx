Ofcourse seeders choose themselves how they choose to seed...

Its a take it or leave it...

Anyhow a tips for distributing could be to seed fewer files same time to get others to help in seeding. Possibly one sometimes need to give a hand but if others are desent each one seeding to just maybe 1.5:1 to compensate for the few superleechers should be enough.

Waiting for a couple of weeks for 60+ GB at once seems too much work for one and to little left for the other.

I would have liked The Saint Season 1 alone and once that one was finished then Season 2 and so on. Better to punish later in the sequel. To see if too few are seeding Season 1 is easy...

But thanks for the great effort and file anyhow!"
