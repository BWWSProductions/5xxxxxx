first you have to download vuze( just put it into google ) 

then come back here 

then click on the film that you want to download but read the comments because it could be fake

if you still want to download it click the link DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT 

double click it 

open 

then click allow

and then you are downloading!!!!"
