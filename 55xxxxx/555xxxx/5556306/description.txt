Rx NOTES
-----------------
Video Source: Iron.Man.2.TELESYNC.German.720p.x264-PFD [THANKS!]
Audio Source: Our Own LiNE.

This time around we used the PFD 720p source. It was pretty good, but had a few issues.

Video has a slight rolling flicker to it & too much contrast and brightness, so removed a lot of both.

Also, we made our own subtitle SRT to Hardcode English subs for the non-English parts only. Might have missed a spot or 2, but definitely got most of them.

We used our OWN LiNE, manually removing each crackle, and then ran through an EQ to bring out a little more bass.

Anything worth doing is worth doing right, well we believe that at least. Those that know we have raw audio should know to wait for us by now. ;)

Extra: We've included the Iron.Man.2.2010.CAM.END-CREDITS.READNFO.XviD-SPOOKY release in this, for anybody curious about the credit scene. Enjoy! =]
