Andy Moor and Ashley Wallbridge featuring Meighan Nealon - Faces
AVA015 - July 6th, 2009

An exciting team-up of two major UK Producers. AVA Recordings owner Andy
Moor decided to join forces with Ashley Wallbridge. Ashley, mostly known
for trance smacker 'Masquerade' completes Andy Moor's lush progtrance
sound. The result is 'Faces' , a diverse vocal trancer in which Andy has
messed around with Meighan Nealon's vocals in the way only he can, and
Ashley delivered his distinctive synths. The result is a dreamy yet realistic,
tender but tough trance beauty that'll surely cause a stir around the scene.

Already featured on the A State of Trance 2009 album, and world-premiered as 
the highly sought-after ID in Armin's ASOT 400 set, 'Faces' is set to be one 
of the major tracks in trance land this year.

'Faces' is remixed by Tenishia and Ben Gold, two major names in trance and
house land. Where Tenishia fills in the prog-trance needs with a melodic
progressive remix, while Ben Gold bangs away with a base-driven trancer 
with a housy touch.
