Every guy has heard it, even girls have heard it. You've just gone out with your girl, thought you had a great time, even got back to her place and had sexâ€¦only to find out before you leave she dumps you. She gives you that old line, it's not you it's me. Donâ€™t you hate it when that happens! Our story follows two girls who are both in a relationship and both need to end itâ€¦which they do. You see, our two girls love each other, so they come up with the old, â€œitâ€™s not youâ€ line. In the end do they live happily ever after...or regret their decisions?
