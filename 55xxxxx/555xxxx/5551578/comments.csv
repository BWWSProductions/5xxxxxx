Today is a sad day my PS3 died, think it might be the power supply, worst part is warranty exspired a year ago and i cant afford a new one or have the money to fix it, and saving up for a new one at this stage isn't possible seems I'm back to watching everything on my pc bleh sucks but that's life i guess."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-11T10:51Z,"I wish I can help you, my friend. PC is not so bad... do you have composite video output (called ""TV out"" on your graphic card? If so, you can hookup TV ""video in"" or SCART input on PC and watch on bigger-screen. HDMI maybe?"
,stev666,2010-05-11T11:25Z,"guess that could work i just need to get some cables then i can hook up the pc to the tv, thank you for the suggestion my friend this will help me allot, i guess im just to lazy to sit and watch an hour long show on the pc much easier to lay on the couch and watch it on the tv hehehe."
