These are the Word documents and other relevant information that went into the creation of NeuFutur #9, which was published in December, 2002. NeuFutur Magazine dealt about LGBT politics, music, pop culture, and DIY projects like building an electric bike, creating your own magazine, and even how to successfully establish a record label.

NeuFutur #9's pieces included a listing of failed soda pops, humorous aphorisms, discussions on transgender identity, and reviewed a number of independent magazines and music.

If there is enough demand for it, I can upload scans of each individual page and/or other issues. NeuFutur is still actively being published, and resides online at http://www.neufutur.com .

Look for NeuFutur's Summer 2010 issue late in July, which ties together articles by the husband and wife combo along with a wide array of the most talented writers that Northern Ohio has to offer.
