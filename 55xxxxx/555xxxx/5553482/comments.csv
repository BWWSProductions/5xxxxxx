,kotique,2010-06-01T18:36Z,"guess what. I've tried updating and it errors out with ""Windows was unable to create a required installation folder. Please reconfigure your boot.wim file to use flag 9 settings for the first image, and restart your installation. Error code 0x8030002F""

MD5 hash of .iso is correct."
,colleraman,2010-06-07T23:04Z,"I downloaded it...
Installed it in a Virtual PC (virtual BOX)
I performed ""Windows Updates"" ...
I performed the ""Genuine Validation"" With Microsoft web page... and this shit is GENUINE...
GENUINE and Validated .... 
I still can't believe it ..."

,jfmherokiller,2010-06-10T08:48Z,does this work in boot camp
,johnmcarr,2010-06-15T17:14Z,"Okay, I have a problem.  

The first time I downloaded this .iso file, I found it impossible to burn to disc correctly.  I reburned it five times, and each time the end product was seriously messed up -- i.e. all of the files were on the DVD, but they were significantly smaller than the ones on the original .iso image.  Furthermore, when I tried to boot from this disc, it would not work.  HOWEVER, the .iso worked perfectly on a virtual machine (Oracle VM VirtualBox).  My question to anyone who may have some insight is why?  Is it something I did wrong, or something wrong with that particular download?

Thanks!

P.S. I'm already downloading it to try again."
,RadGH,2010-06-22T01:43Z,"How is it ""Untouched, no single thing modded or removed!"" but yet ""Activated!""?

I have a key, I just need a disc. I am fine activating it myself. Why have an untouched disc thats activated?"
,xXXMANICKxXx,2010-06-23T16:43Z,hey guys i have downloaded this file but havent been able to make a bootable dvd  isnt this image bootable ?? i use ultraiso to burn this image on the dvd. plus its not extracting n not even getting tranferred to my 16 gig PD

Yay! 

For people who are getting Error code 0x8030002F: You should read the microsoft website. This torrent only contains Windows 7 clean install, so you can only get windows 7 by booting off the dvd (if you have XP or 7). THERE IS NO WINDOWS ANYTIME UPGRADE, meaning that you cannot upgrade from a lesser windows 7 to a higher windows 7 by clicking the setup.exe on my computer. AGAIN, XP AND 7 CANNOT INSTALL BY OPENING THE FILE ON AN EXISTING OS, YOU MUST DO A CLEAN INSTALL BY BOOTING OFF THE DVD. Some versions of Vista allow upgrading, so if you have vista, try opening setup.exe off your OS, it's worth a try. If it works, you can upgrade without losing your files/programs. OTHERWISE, YOU MUST BOOT OFF THE DISK OR YOU WILL GET THE ERROR CODE 0x8030002F.

Thanks again caprioara1975. "
,thechemist79,2010-07-09T22:21Z,"this works perfect, ive installed a w7 starter and an ultimate 64bit so far. just what the doctor ordered....! big thanks for this...."

,a105108,2010-07-24T03:56Z,"@BolBlindass

You need to boot off the DVD for it to work. 

The Error Code 0x8007001 means that it cant work from double clicking setup.exe. 

It can only work from booting off DVD. Only some OS can work from clicking setup.exe, and if your's doesn't, boot off DVD and it should work. That's what i did. 

BTW THIS IS AMAZING, ACTIVATED AND GENUINE !!! :D:D:D:D:D"
,Dave_247,2010-07-30T21:16Z,"Works fine.
Whatever you do, when you running Windows Update DO NOT INSTALL UPDATE (KB970133)
THIS is what makes your copy non-genuine."
