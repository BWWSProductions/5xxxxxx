I always missed an updated app pack for the iphone or the ipod touch
So this is for all of you out there who felt the same
All the apps have been on my iPhone one time or the other and i have collected them from all over the net...
None of these have been my original contributions... and i would like everyone to give credit to all those who have made these apps possible for us.
Needs Jailbreak

Do Buy the apps if you eventually like them
