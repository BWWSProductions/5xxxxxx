" "Pegasus" is the story of an old shoeing-smith who is entirely surpassed by technology, and who revolts in his own way, absurd and unreal, by making metallic horses. We are shown the reaction of a solitary man opposing against society, a man who performs a repeated act, obsessed, determined to counter the present order of things. To make "Pegasus", Servais turns back to one of his old passions: expressionism. He considers, quite logically, that a visual form close to the aesthetics of Flemish expressionism would be prefectly adequate for his subject. The very pictorial material of the backgrounds causes the printing of the characters, superimposed in several layers of acrylic gouache on the celluloid, to be extremely fastidious. It reaches the limit of sophistication feasible for a modest budget production. "

Raoul Servais:
"The rural aspects of the subject required an expressionistic approach in technique. The Laethem painting school from the turn of the 20st century brought lots of inspiration. The technique we developed was extremely time consuming".
