Norman Osborn's control has spread wider than anyone could have ever imagined in their wildest dreams (or nightmares). Now he only has one obstacle left between him and complete domination...Asgard! Will Norman Osborn take control of Asgard and become all-powerful? Can the Marvel heroes trust each other long enough to stop him? What will be left when the dust settles? All of these questions will be answered during Marvel's most important event yet, SIEGE!
