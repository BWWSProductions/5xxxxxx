,insomniac86,2010-05-11T14:19Z,THIS IS REAL. No need for insults buddy. My VLC player usually gives me accurate previews but was playing a cached file I had already deleted. Very weird.

,astuz,2010-05-12T21:17Z,isnt it a amazing that people want free movies but bitch when its not to their standards? if you do not like it then go find someone else thanks...... (anon007)
,alanhawk0,2010-05-13T01:28Z,"Please people, don't call movies ""screeners"" unless they really are the ""screening"" pre-release copy of the movie.  pointing a camera at the theater screen and filming is NOT a ""screener"", it's a CAM or Telesync or TS.  Screener means one thing, the copy used for the producers to ""screen"" the movie.  I don't like wasting my time downloading a crappy looking video because someone decided to call it a screener.  REAL screeners, or stolen pre-release copys of the DVD are the only things worth downloading if the movie is not out on DVD yet."
,insomniac86,2010-05-14T09:40Z,This is a damn good cam copy. Better aspect ratio than many others and great bass in audio track. Many others out there are trebley as hell! Sorry about previous comments. You kick ass!
,astuz,2010-05-15T01:15Z,well thank you insomniac86
,Boadicca,2010-05-21T04:04Z,Thanks from me. Excellent!
,baron9876,2010-07-20T15:17Z,"alanhawk has a good point, we're not moaning about gettin free films, we just want people to understand what a screener is and not to say it is one when it ain't."
,neephius,2010-10-06T15:47Z,"UNLESS YOU EXPECT 100% QUALITY ALL THE TIME FUCK OF TO THE CINEMA. SOME OF THE RIPS ARE GREAT SOME ARE NOT SO GOOD BUT ALL ARE APPRECIATED. THANKS FOR THE UP.
