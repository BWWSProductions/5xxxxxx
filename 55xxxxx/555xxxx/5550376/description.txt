Bruce Palmer was the original bassist for Buffalo Springfield. He only recorded 1 album after the demise of Buffalo Springfield: The Cycle is Complete, a mostly instrumental album. This is an mp3 copy of that album. The music industry was not quite ready for this kind of music even in the late '60s when this was recorded & released.
