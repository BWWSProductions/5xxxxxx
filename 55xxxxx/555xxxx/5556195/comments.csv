,gonoje,2010-05-16T20:27Z,"Hello petcna,
Just two questions please. I've downloaded this, but when trying to install it in FSX, I dont' see the choice to select it during the installation wizard. How do I do? Then, in order to install this, should I have first the Radar Contact V4, or can I do it from version 4.01 directly?
Thank you very much."
,petcna,2010-05-17T07:33Z,You must first have RC V4 in order to use these updates. The link for RC V4 torrent is given in the readme. I think the answer for your first question is that you didn't install RC V4.
,vittupaa1980,2010-05-19T14:24Z,No there is no link to RC4 in readme file i know becouse i downloaded the readme file.
,vittupaa1980,2010-05-19T16:09Z,hope there was becouse i reallt want this

,paoloa,2011-06-14T10:48Z,"Does anyone got the original RC4 working with FSX on W7 64 bit? 

I keep trying both methods described in the hex editor information and Artmoney but fail over and over again to get it installed. 

Please let me know how I install it. Thx (will keep on seeding in the meantime). "
,petcna,2011-06-16T21:56Z,"paoloa, unfortunately i'm a 32-bit user.. but i'll try in a 64-bit system and let u know as soon as possible.."
,friezer,2011-07-21T20:42Z,"ATENTION 64 bits users (WIN7/XP/VISTA)!!!!!!!!!!!!

The reason why OLLYDBG is not working on 64 bits machines is because debuggers were pre-defined to work on 32 machines and not 64. So in order to work on 64 just download the following file and put in the same folder where you installed OLLYDBG (http://board.b-at-s.info/index.php?showtopic=6881&st=0) itÂ´s called stealth64. ItÂ´s in that same page"
,petcna,2011-09-19T11:14Z,@friezer: thanks for letting others know about the issue.
,laukejas,2012-03-16T18:33Z,"Hey, could someone make a working debugger for 4.3? That dumpserial.exe with ollydbg is working only for 4.0, not for 4.3. I followed all procedures for ollydbg, with stealth64 and everything (since I run Windows 7 64), but the program does not accept the serial. Please help?"
