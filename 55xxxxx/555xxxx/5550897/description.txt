        Freema Agyeman narrates a series focusing on the most        
        extraordinary and eye-watering cases to come through the     
        doors of a British A&E department. Featuring a man who       
        accidentally barbecued his own buttocks; a builder impaled   
        through the thigh on a metre-long metal pole; and a          
        footballer wheeled in with his kneecap facing the wrong way. 
        Plus, how surgeons successfully reattached a farmer's        
        severed arm by first stitching it into his crotch.
