,jakebot,2010-05-12T07:14Z,johnefp; thanks very much for all your effort. You are a film school education in a torrent file. I usually have to borrow movies from my local library because I have little money - having someone like you putting so much effort in the scene is pretty incredible and more than appreciated. Thanks ever so  much.
