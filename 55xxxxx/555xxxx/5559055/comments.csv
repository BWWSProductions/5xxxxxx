,stefkies,2010-11-08T06:56Z,The music video song isn't on here FYI:( But nice rips of the other songs!
,blombardo,2011-02-23T03:58Z,Nice post Seismicsnap - I loved this music... I posted a torrent like this that has more stuff included- take a search and keep up the good work.
,TPBBK,2012-05-20T03:57Z,"Torrent shouldn't be labelled as an OST if it's just a game rip (though appreciated).

Actually OST finally released after some prodding by the composer, Laura Shigihara on her Bandcamp page which includes all tracks + unreleased extras in several formats including FLAC.

Only $3.99 USD, worth supporting imo (who else is making awesome old school gaming music like this anymore? Not many.)"
