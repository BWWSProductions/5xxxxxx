"Don't get left behind"

Open Water

Susan and Daniel embark on a Bahamas island getaway to escape their workaholic lifestyles. Both certified scuba divers, they board a local dive boat for an underwater tour of the reef. Due to a series of innocent miscommunications and a distracted crew, the couple is accidentally left behind in the chilling open waters of the shark-infested oceanâ€¦ 



"Fatigue. Hypothermia. Death. How Long Could You Last?"

Open Water 2: Adrift

A weekend cruise aboard a luxury yacht goes horribly awry for a group of old high school friends when they forget to lower the ladder before they jump into the ocean for a swim. The boat proves impossible to climb, leaving them adrift, miles from shore. Soon the exhaustion of keeping afloat and the struggle to get back on board begin to take a terrible toll.
