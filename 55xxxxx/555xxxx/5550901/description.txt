Buff homogenization and the Blues dont like you.
http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401906297/shared-raid-lockouts-more-homogenized-buffs/
Raid buffs and debuffs exist for two main reasons:

1) They encourage you to bring a diversity of classes and specs rather than stacking whatever is highest dps at the moment.
2) They make you feel more powerful in a group than when youâ€™re solo. For an MMO, WoW is pretty soloable, so we like for it to feel really awesome when youâ€™re in a group.

Whenever we read â€œWithout my buff, there is no reason for a group to take me,â€ our typical response is: awesome. Youâ€™ll have to figure out another reason why they should take you.
