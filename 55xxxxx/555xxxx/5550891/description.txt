     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      A lot of mentalist Derren Brown's act looks psychic. But it
      isn't. And he doesn't pretend it is. It's showmanship and skill,
      not paranormal power. So how does the man who knows every trick
      in the book react to people who claim there is no book? To start
      his new debunking series, he spends time with Liverpool psychic
      Joe Power, who claims he communes with the dead. Excellent
      scenes ensue, particularly when Power fails a test that Derren
      sets up, and becomes a very unhappy medium.
