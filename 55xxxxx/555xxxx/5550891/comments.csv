,kiwilove007,2010-06-19T08:29Z,"Note - the so-called psychic featured in this programme is not one talented as such.  You'd feel sorry for those who get readings from this guy.  You'd guess that the big-name psychics are not interested in taking part with Derren - such as Colin Fry, James van Praagh, Lisa Williams, etc because they are in a different league altogether...

Need help with re-seeding this torrent... Mind Control with Derren Brown S01E04.WS.DSR.XviD-SYS.
It is a WINRAR file and there's about 13 people stuck at 99.5%
If you have this file - please re-seed it, thanks!!!"
