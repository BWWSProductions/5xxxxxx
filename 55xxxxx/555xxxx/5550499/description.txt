Tired of d/l all of the "new" SecurStar Drive Crypt programs on
TPB and none of the fucking key gens work??

Tired of unzipping a key gen only to have your virus program
detect it as infected?

Tired of d/l BLOATWARE only to find that your older version
worked better & hassle free without all the bells & whistles?

Here is a bit older version of SecurStar Drive Crypt with no
BS keygen to fuck with.

Just copy the cracked drive crypt .exe file over the installed
file and reboot your computer.

I have used this version for years on X64 VISTA and X64 Windows 7.

I did not d/l this file from TPB; I found it on another torrent
server a few years ago. I re-packaged it, deleted out the spam,
but kept intact the original down-loader .nfo file.

This program should work on x32 bit OS's as well i.e. XP.

Follow the detailed & simple install instructions.

Details of this very useful program can be found here:

Enjoy!
