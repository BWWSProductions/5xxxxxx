,moritz007,2010-05-13T18:14Z,"Is anyone else having trouble with the video file? Nero can't open it/burn it. VLC, which can play anything, can't play it. I tried a straight data burn to dvd. Nothing will play it. This is driving me crazy. Help."
,xSammaeLx,2010-05-13T21:13Z,There's a video file?Didn't notice one.
,moritz007,2010-05-13T22:59Z,"Never mind.

There is a 1.18mb file called ~uTorrentPartFile_40E72E16.dat

The .dat extension is associated with Nero on my machine which lists it as type Video CD Movie. Hence the confusion.

We all get up in the morning and put on our stupid shoes once and a while.

I wish there was video. Is there video? Somewhere?"
,MORE-C12H22O11,2010-05-13T23:35Z,"Yay!!!

My first upload gets the PAP smears in a tizzy... 1764 thumbs-down votes and counting!

It's great to get such a reception.

PS... there is no video file in the rar, and I don't know why there'd be a dat file, either. Maybe it's cuz I'm using an old-ass version of bitcomet.

 I wish she had done a video, and I REALLY wish Sugar had done one or ten, as well!!!!!!"
,MORE-C12H22O11,2010-09-01T11:16Z,"Anybody got more of her?

Is this all she ever did?"
