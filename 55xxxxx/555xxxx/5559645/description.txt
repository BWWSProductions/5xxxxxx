After working a couple of years in background Stoneface & Terminal decided in 2005 to put the main focus now on their own career - what was now required was a defining, breakout single, so Stoneface & Terminal produced two : â€œIncognition/ Drowning Sunlightâ€ with Ronski Speed and the AvB championed â€œVenusâ€. In October 2006 the â€œEarth EPâ€ was released with three huge tracks (â€œSuper Natureâ€, â€œAnother Dayâ€, and â€œSidewinderâ€). The EP became a monster seller, garnering glowing reviews from Germanyâ€™s Raveline magazine and the UKâ€™s DJ Mag. In 2007 Stoneface and Terminal have wrapped work on their first artist 
album â€œWide Rangeâ€, which gives the perfect window into their musically genre-splicing world. It was released on Euphonic and Watermusic (USA/Canada) in summer 2007. Till today, Stoneface & Terminal released 14 Singles & 30 Remixes played by the likes of Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold, Above & Beyond, Ferry Corsten Judge Jules, Eddie Halliwell and many more. Their tracks got airplays on BBC Radio 1 and the Galaxy network. Stoneface & Terminal were nominated for the Beatport Music Awards 2008. Stoneface & Terminal mixed and compiled the 5th volume of the established compilation series "This Is Trance" for the north american market.
