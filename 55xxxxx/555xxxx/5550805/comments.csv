@TKOG13:
HIMYM and TBBT as 360p and 24 as [quark]. I'll try to do quarked Chuck, but I never done it before and if you doesn't see one up it would mean that Chuck's [quark] turned ugly and grab 272p as usual."

[T],MelloYello,2010-05-15T05:26Z,"He is gonna be in Green Lantern.  Huh, Ryan Reynolds is gonna be Hal Jordan and Deadpool.  So much for Marvel/DC rivalry I guess.  Would of assumed they would want to keep there actors from each others movies.  Well anyways.  Keep up the awesome work 2040 and many thanks."
