,Nchant,2011-01-06T09:46Z,"Folks.... can you PLEASE up your speed for this torrent?  There are only 3 peers and everyone is going so incredibly slow--I know you are capable of faster since I have seen it from you 3 over the past day or two.  At this rate, it will take more days for everyone to complete.  
Also, it would be incredible if the only full seed out there could make an appearance and help us complete. Please!  Shame to have such a large up and then to neglect it... 
I would also hate to have this on for so long only for us not to be able to complete! Thanks! :-)"
,Nchant,2011-01-14T11:04Z,Thanks seeders for coming to my rescue!!!

,donaldduck13,2011-05-20T01:07Z,Thanks so much for this; it hasnt come out on dvd so i have been hoping to see this since 1984!
,happy_ending,2011-06-04T18:50Z,"what list above please?
cannot see one.
It is being seeded but only for an hour or two a day it seems, and it doesn't make much difference, except for occasional bursts of up to 50kb/s.
I've spent about 6 days on this continually and am uploading plenty on the ratio."
,happy_ending,2011-06-07T20:57Z,"please would the one seeder seed now please!
I am nearly finished - on 94+% and then I will seed after... but today has been SO slow, on bytes speed for most of the day :("
