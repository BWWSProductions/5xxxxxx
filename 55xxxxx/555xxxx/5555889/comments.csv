      I have a copy already but it looks like a low quaility VHS rip at best. I am going to DL this one and hope its better quaility.
      This is one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen and I love the macabre! It alternates between being a B movie and an A movie and is a MUST SEE flick IMO. Insanely bizzare^^"
