  This isn't a proper of HLS' release. The source of this release 
  is the limited edition EC Ultra Bit DVD. With a runtime of 91   
  minutes its the longest known print of this explotation classic.
  There are rumors that the long awaited Grindhouse NTSC DVD will 
  be completly uncut with the often mentioned "piranha scene"     
  included (even though Deodato has publicly stated that he never 
  filmed that scene) but Grindhouse is now where to be found. So  
  kick back and enjoy one of the coolest films ever.
