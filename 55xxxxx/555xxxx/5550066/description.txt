Brian Appleton's unique insights into the history of rock stem from the fact that - despite being a simple Brummie from Selly Oak - he played a pivotal, though currently unrecognised, part in that very history. Without Brian many of today's gods of rock would never have seen the light of day and many of the songs regarded as classics would never have been written.

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
