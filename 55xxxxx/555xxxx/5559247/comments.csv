,AngB,2010-06-14T15:42Z,"What should i do after i download this game and i want to copy it in a cd to play in me playstation 2?

please anyone!!!!"
,0815peter,2010-07-24T07:29Z,"hmm. currently i am not sure, if this also works in ps2 with the patch enabled.

usualy you can play dvd backups with a chipped ps2, or with FMCB with an ESR patched game (ps2 before 90001 serial number)"
,0815peter,2010-07-24T11:56Z,"Just tested it: works fine on my ps2 with FMCB on my memory card. english patch is good. needed to patch it with ESR before burning obviosly. I used image burn. Did not try online, like MH3 tri on my wii better for online play :D"

,Kratos91,2011-06-19T02:11Z,"Sorry Guys haven't been here for a long time !

The game works perfectly on PCSX2, on PC and MAC versions, even on a ""weak computer"" (laptop with Core2duo 2ghz and 128m GPU).

Since lots of people are having problem installing the patch and Japaneses certainly speak English, i think i'm gonna upload the patched version, just ask me.

I am also gonna add my saves for Pcsx users, i'm starting to be freaking strong !

Just one thing guys : if you know someone who is CRAAAAZY for MH and knows computers, can you get him to make it work online ? That would be so good. I used to play MH1 online before Capcom shut the server and that was the best game experience of my whole life.

I also have MH1 if someone's interested.

See ya"
