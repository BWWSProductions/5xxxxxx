Full working .iso of Monster Hunter Dos, Japan Version.
An english translation patch is available in my other torrents to translate items and quests in the game, check it.

Fully working on PCSX2 (free ps2 emulator) on computers, download it from the official website. You will need to find Original PS2 Bios, which are also available on the Bay.

If you have questions ...

NB: I would appreciate information if some of you managed to get PCSX2 working online. I can't help thinking i could play this one with other hunters. Thanks


Have fun !
