Has it not occurred to you that NO ONE knows what the hell is going on here anymore than the shamans, magicians, yogis, etc. do?! 

Modern ""science"" is just now catching up to the mysteries that were suppressed in its uprising.

Do you not realize that the HERO is ALWAYS portrayed as evil by the masses!?!?!

There is a problem right now of division, compartmentalization, dissociation, and fear that results in us thinking that ""things"", or situations, are one way or another.. ultimately its up to us to find the balance between the many polarities that make up our perception of consciousness.

I urge everyone who reads this to only accept things that coincide with your own intuition.
Not your rationalization,
or your justification, 
or whatever you feel is how you ""should be"".

Dont do.. be.

Look to expand your range of acceptance of what is beautiful so that you will grow in beauty.

Its getting to the point where we are entering a new dark age... and illumination will be needed."
