You used to have english subtitles and I like watching Thai movies but not if without subtitle as am not Thai.  Would appreciate if you could advise where to download subtitle in order to enable non Thais to watch your upload which I have found of good qlty. Thanks in advance"
[V],poothaijaa,2010-05-22T22:27Z,That is the problem with Thai movies release in Thailand (which I uploaded). redhat98 always upload with english sub. I can not find any site has an englisg sub.
