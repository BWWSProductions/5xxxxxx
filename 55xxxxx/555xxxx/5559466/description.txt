In New York, John Roth and Lawrence "Moe" Curley are friends, roommates and partners in a pornographic adult site called Intercon-X, where the fantasies of costumers may be satisfied, being necessary only a computer and a credit card. John is very lonely and has difficulties to deal with real people, and Moe is a "walking penis", only interested in having sex with women. John peeps Angel and the delicious Jordan Nash, and one day he makes contact with Jordan and they date. Meanwhile, the depressed owner of a thematic bar, Moira Ingalls, meets Moe and she falls in love for him, stops using pills and leaves her suicidal chartroom, keeping only touch with the twenty years old gay virtual friend Ed Simone, who is also lonely and likes Al Fleming from Intercon-X. The reaction of each person outside virtual world meeting the other one is very different, but in the end, there is a message of hope.
