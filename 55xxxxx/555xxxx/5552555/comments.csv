,CakeMonster,2010-11-01T20:07Z,"Mr meech if you could please upload season 2 of atlantis with commentaries it would make my day

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of âgood qualityâ of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
,CakeMonster,2010-11-07T11:47Z,There are no directors commentaries here in season 3 :(
[V],meech,2010-12-10T13:18Z,"Sorry, I don't know why they did it, but the original discs for this season did not include any commentaries.  So there was no extra audio track to include."
,vpiratos,2011-03-11T13:24Z,"Attention all pathetic leeches: since I have observed your IP leeching for hours, without uploading a single byte back, know that you are now being blocked by a custom made script. Good luck getting more without giving any back, you selfish fucks.
On another note, this is an incredible torrent. If only those douches would upload more so it would download faster than an average 10k/s"

,Jamjarstation24,2011-04-13T09:44Z,"Well i am done brace yourself for a long download thats all i can say, but hopefully it shouldn't be that long for you as i am now seeding :)"

,JamJulLison,2012-06-05T12:51Z,vpiratos  do you understand why some of us don't seed?  Some of us don't want to take the additional risk of getting caught sharing these. Others just don't have the necessary bandwidth or netspeed to be a good seeder.  I have downloaded torrents with large numbers of seeds in the past and yet have the download be slow. Why? Probably because the people seeding were on poor internet connection. Quality seeders is just as important as the number of seeders. If not more sometimes.  Also not sure where you are get 10kbs from.  I am hitting 200kbs at the moment and I expect it to go up higher soon. You might want to check your net connection cause speeds that slow seems to indicate a problem on your end. 
,JamJulLison,2012-06-05T13:00Z,"vpiratos I would also like to point out that a script such as yours goes against what piratebay and other free file sharing activist are against. We believe the net should be how it was originally ment to be. Uncensored. Unrestricted. The net itself was designed to allow people to send information and date to one another free and quick.  By using your script you are preventing people this free access.  So you might as well not be seeding at all then if these people can't download it. You can always say, if they seed it they can share download it? But how can they seed it if they can't download it in the first place?  If they got it, why would they need to download it from you?  So what is the point in you even seeding it? At least the rest of us who leech don't go and make ourselves out to be false seed. "
