Twoism was an album released by Boards of Canada on their own Music70 record label in 1995. It was a self-financed cassette and record distributed privately. Major public releases would not happen until 1996â€™s Hi Scores EP on Skam Records. This album was, however, the work which got them noticedâ€¦
