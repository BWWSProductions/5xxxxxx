To stop confusion. "english hardcoded subs during Mandarin dialogue" 
Means the main dialogoue is in Mandarin.For both movies!
Of course there are also English subs during the Japanese bits of Movie 1!
There are no English Hardcoded subs during the English bits at the end of Movie 2!
I have as much understanding of Mandarin as I do of Cantonese.Which is nill.
I have provided these Movies for English speaking peaople not Chinese!
All the best everyone xxx
