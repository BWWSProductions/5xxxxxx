""During"" could mean only during when the actors speak mandarin, like the northerner in Ip Man 1, as the rest of the dialogue is spoken in Cantonese. 

Do you even have this confirmed if Ip Man 2 in this upload is in Canto or Mandarin?"
,Depends,2010-05-14T03:46Z,"This is in mandarin, when is there going to be a cantonese release?"
,vincekage,2010-05-14T07:14Z,"@nijett

yes i've realised. i didn't see it till after i posted the comment."
,cheatsforme,2010-05-14T16:59Z,"Any comment on quality ?
All the others are bad copies for ip man 2."
,cheatsforme,2010-05-14T18:34Z,"nvm i found out for myself since no one else posted.
Its the same horrible quality as the others, its not a dvdrip more like a cam, although i have seen better quality cams.
Thanks for upload anyway, i await the uncut version with better quality.

A-8
V-4 (you need a good copy to be able to see donnie yens speed, its just a blur on this quality) but great film altogether"

WATCHABLE THOUGH.. "
,ZombiePanda,2011-08-10T15:39Z,"Sucks, I've downloaded about 4 copies of IP Man only to find they're all Mandarin dub."
,handsworthzark,2012-01-27T08:37Z,"agree about ipman 2 
awful encoding. I have no idea how this was messed up but there you go. 
It is very very poor especially considering all the tools available today. 
WOW! 
IPMAN 2 v=4 , a = who cares the video is a disgrace"
,handsworthzark,2012-01-27T08:42Z,"also ipman1 is bad bad bad
