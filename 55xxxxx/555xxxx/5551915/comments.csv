,nittany,2010-05-11T23:42Z,"This does not belong in the Highres section, only bluray rips or other material that has similar audio and video quality belong in here.  4.4GB for a telesync...don't waste your time people."
,kimm_24f,2010-05-12T01:24Z,"Oh man, this is not good quality..."
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-12T02:16Z,Damn it this is 100% real. I got it directly so decided to upload it unrared.
,-Leto-,2010-05-12T03:06Z,"not worth downloading, there's a constant flickering during all the movie, like dark shadows constantly floating on the picture."
,YotaFish,2010-05-12T06:07Z,"Excuse my ignorance but how do you you burn a converted 4.40 Gig file to a 4.7 Gig DVD? Its not big enough is it ? I checked out the quality and while its not the greatest, its still the best copy I've seen anywhere."
,orjanmac,2010-05-12T07:57Z,"This is not highres, this is crap. post this in the crap section please."
,somedude.1001,2010-05-12T13:33Z,Every time someone post a TELESYNC into the hi-def category god kill a puppy.
,caliwillbemine,2010-05-12T13:36Z,"total crap has nothing to do in HD section.
stupid cheap camcorders"
,juggalopride,2010-05-16T08:51Z,this video works and its doesnt look that bad 
,ExhamPriory,2010-05-25T22:38Z,"you'd need a dual layer dvd, because even though the actual size capacity of the 4.7gb should fit, the actual runtime (movie length) is too long for the standard blank dvd length"
,sugdenbra,2010-06-02T15:33Z,"Thanks Dibya! 

I cant´t wait to see this one so I´m glad this x264 version is available cause even tho it´s still a cam I find it better than the small avi cams out there.

Every time someone tries to help the (not all of them course) people here´s always acting like idiots writing stupid stuff about the torrent!   
What´s wrong with you guys? No one have ever claimed it to be anything other than a high res telesync version, which of course isn´t the same as 720p BD rip!   
Why is it in the high res section?  I don´t know and I don´t care, since it is a cam in high resolution I´ll guess DibyaTPB has to put it somewhere, right?

According to me it´s the best one out there so far (especially when played on a larger screen), so if you can´t wait this is the one to dl.
I just wish some kind person with skills could upload a english subtitle for it couse I can´t wait much longer, hahaha!"
,sugdenbra,2010-06-02T15:57Z,"Sorry forgot!

I´ll give it a A/8 V/8.

Telesync or not, audio is absolutely ok and much better than cams without external audiosource.

Video is also ok, definitely watchable and is good for a camsource. Video does flicker, and also it is a little pale and soft. But even so I personally think it´s good for a cam/telesync and when judged it has to be compared to other cams, NOT with BDrip´s!"
,bhead9318,2010-06-11T21:47Z,"At first I was a bit skeptical at first like I always am with cams, but after reading some of the comments I was a little more reassured to download this.

I'll say it straight and sweet so that those who are skeptical like me can get a sure idea about this.

V/7 - A/8

The audio is flawless, in fact it almost sounded like I was in a theater.  My only complaint is that when they speak another language the hard-coded subs are in German.  (This should be expected though as the source is a German cam.)

Regarding the video, this is probably one of the best quality cam's I've seen in a while.  Yes, there is a ""flickering light"" that is seen throughout the entire movie, but it's once again expected.  At some points in the movie it becomes so bright that it's hard to make out characters, but this is only for a minute or two.  Honestly, halfway through the movie I completely forgot I was watching a cam, you just get used to it after a while.

Overall I would highly recommend this if you MUST see the movie now, like me.  Probably one of the best cams you will ever see.

To all those haters calling this crap, shame on you, this is the best quality of Iron Man 2 we're going to get before an R5 shows up.  If you don't want to watch a cam then just don't say anything at all.

+1 to DibyaTPB.

,Dhatzster,2010-06-28T19:35Z,"shit ,how long till BD?"
,icelaw,2010-07-02T02:14Z,"It's packed as a .RAR file,
and the RAR files is.. BROKEN..

Torrent invalid. 
Dont download if you dont wanna be fooled by this uploder-idiot."
,pheonixrisen,2010-07-04T03:13Z,"How are you allowed to keep that pink skull with misleading uploads like this?  Crap upload, not high res.  Don't bother with this file."
,krilyx,2010-07-31T01:41Z,"its not high quality...
it looks like shots from the 90s..."
,trevster,2010-08-31T05:52Z,"What is this shit? Where in the description does it say cam? I wouldn't be complaining if SOMEWHERE it said it was a cam. It looks like any other piece of shit cam on thepiratebay. If you don't care about downloading a cam, then go for it, but for fucks sake, don't say ""720p"" and don't mention anywhere it's a cam. "
