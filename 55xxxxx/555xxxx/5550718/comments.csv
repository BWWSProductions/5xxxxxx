,DrRude,2010-05-19T04:56Z,"you said in the description that you're lookin for cats that reliably rip...

i'm that guy.

i can (potentially) rip vinyl losslessly, as soon as i figure out how to make the rane ttm-57 work in windows without clipping... 

not sure how to contact directly, so if you make the first move, i'm your dude..."

,wha007uk,2010-05-20T15:06Z,this album is awful. im a hiphop fan and have been for 15 years. if you havent liked nas before then dont waste your time downloading. this album could have been great with a mixture of dance hall raggae and hip hop but they take themselves too serious in it and dont try and have fun with it
,GonnaFindMyself,2010-05-22T22:47Z,"Wha007uk stop being so close minded, ok you say ""this album is awful"", i'm not saying your wrong but that is your opinion. i was never the biggest nas fan. but to me this album is crack. not the greatest with words but this is very soulful.
maybe you should let people decide for their own."
,muratura,2010-05-25T08:38Z,wow that was a fast download under 1 min thanks man
