[T],houruoha,2010-05-19T08:25Z,"@lover2040
its done already...

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T08:33Z,"Both. Shutter was done two days ago... but... you know what was.
I have BluRay of Book of Eli but have no clue when I would up them both. Shutter maybe, maybe tonight and Book maybe-baby tommorow..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T08:35Z,"Thanks houruoha.
But he was asking for new releases, I guess."
,lover2040,2010-05-19T09:03Z,"yes...i was lookin for the new one..!!!

and will be waiting for it...jus mention the size of both pls?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T09:20Z,"Shutter ~500MB because it is very, very long movie and such movies I encode only as either 272p or - as newest - as [quark].
Regarding Book, screener was done as [quark] and this one cannot be a [quark] again. What would be, I haven't decided yet."
,D07792,2010-05-19T09:32Z,"its great that TPB is up again as always.

Can u pls do Shutter.Island in quark as well.
Thanks."
,jjabrams,2010-05-19T09:49Z,"wow, another lethargic episode, only thing I can think of that would be remotely original for the finale is that someone replaces the smoke monster too. "

@twentyforty

@twentyforty
oops...
Whats going on!!
Just having fun.-:)"
,sherynoshka,2010-05-19T10:23Z,thank you. 
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T10:40Z,"@D07792: OK. But I do not know when I can up the [quark] - [quark]s are treated as garbage by many ""oh man, I should delete this shit - after I finished watching"" (sarcasm applied). Regarding that I need SAME TIME and same amount of work as for 272p or 360p, it does make me look&feel stupid, right?

@jjabrams: In past six years I have tolerated many ""empty"" episodes. Are we wrong when such obvious declination in writing appears in the last season ever? But, episodes before last two were OK, in general.. and at least 9 of the season.
Also, new-age rubbish about ""The Source"" and ""Light"" (for teenagers and new-age beginners) is mixed with main story-line which must be finished, resolved on best possible way. Right now, I second opinions that is not the case."
