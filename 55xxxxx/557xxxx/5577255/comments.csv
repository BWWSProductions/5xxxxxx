I'm planning to upload shutter island in 480p but I think I'll have to think twice or before uploading it.. Cause I don't want unseeded torrents & my HDD's are full and i need some space to download & rip new movies.. If you guys don't want new ones i'll keep seeding the only ones.. 

Thank you.."
,Mullen90,2010-05-21T06:45Z,Thanks Dude!  Ill comment on the quality when i finish the download. 
[V],pluto999,2010-05-21T06:50Z,Yeah you can always do that.. I don't think 720p copy needs screen shots.. I'll upload screen shots from now on only if I upload screeners
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-21T07:50Z,"I'm sorry, but I can't see a full length, 720p movie, that is ripped down to 600MB looking that good.

I normally don't even waste my time downloading any 720p, or above, movie unless it's 4+GB.

Either way, I wouldn't download it simply because it is only 2 channel audio.

Please note that I have not downloaded this and I can't comment on the quality for a fact, these are just my assumptions based on the size of the file.

Most people might think that they look good, but I'm almost positive that they would look pretty bad on my 84"" screen.

If you want to prove the nay sayers like me wrong, start uploading full sized screen shots of your rips."
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-21T08:03Z,"Or better yet, you should include a small sample."
,Gate2MasterChief,2010-05-21T08:17Z,"Can u plz upload ""The Last Song"" "
[V],pluto999,2010-05-21T08:23Z,"@Dirty_Joe_Dirt: End credits are removed.. Just for the record I don't understand why people always has this ""snob appeal"" that a 400mb copy wouldn't be good, a 600mb 720p copy wouldn't be good.. I think there was a time before people was completely aware about the xvid codec, that people said that a 700mb copy wouldn't be good and 4.4gb dvd would be good..

There is lot of people who just know a little & starts commenting whatever they want..thats why may be the proverb ""empty vessel sounds much"" was created..and joe if you don't like my torrents then don't download it..Its as simple as it gets.. 

@all as many of you suggested me for the screenshots so it'll be here.."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-21T08:24Z,@Gate2MasterChief: I'll once a good copy is released..

,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-21T20:48Z,"@pluto999
Like I said before, I have not personally downloaded any of your videos, but it just doesn't seem possible to me to have a 20+GB file compressed all the way down to a 600MB file without it looking pretty bad (at least on my 84"" screen).

I tell you what, I already have a 720p, 6+GB rip of this movie.  I'll download yours too and I'll do a comparison between the two.  If I'm wrong, I'll admit it.  If I'm right, I'll confirm it.

I'm not trying to be an asshole about it, I'm just simply stating my opinion.

BTW, congratulations on the pink skull."
,Gate2MasterChief,2010-05-22T02:24Z,"Gr8 movie... Copy is excellent...
Thank u very much pluto999....
U r the ri8 owner of pink skull bro..."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-22T07:25Z,"@Gate2MasterChief: Thanks!!
@Dirty_Joe_Dirt: Yup do that! It'll be equivalent to a 6gb rip apart from the 5 channel audio!"

[V],pluto999,2010-05-26T09:26Z,@al3x-.- : I'll do once a DVD or bluray is out..
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-28T07:49Z,"I finally got around to doing a comparison.

I have to admit, it looks better than I expected, but it still suffers from compression artifacts.  Most people probably won't notice it, but I could definitely tell on my 84"" screen.

I took some still shots with my camera, but it's kind of hard to tell the difference in the pictures I took.  You can kind of see it, but it's more obvious in person.

If you really want to see them just let me know and I'll upload them and post the links here."
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-28T07:51Z,"I know a lot of people love the small size of your rips, but for me, I'm going to stick with the larger sized rips because they do in fact look better on my larger screen.  Plus, I have to have 5.1 audio.

As I said before, a lot of people love what you're doing, so keep up the good work.  You're rips just aren't high enough quality for me."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-28T15:25Z,"Dirty_Joe_Dirt: within 700mb this is the best you can get.. For 84"" screen I admit bit rate has to be high.. mail me @ plutooo999@gmail.com"
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-29T04:19Z,"@pluto999
e-mail has been sent.  Pictures included."
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-05-29T04:21Z,"Oh, I forgot to mention, it's a fairly large e-mail.  A little under 20 megs.

It might take a while to download (depending on your connection speed)."

ASAP ty 
,CaptainBarbosa1.2,2010-10-11T08:21Z,"Pluto, this rip is amazing, for it's size the quality is great. I'm surprise more people don't release rips like this, it's way better than the common 700MB or even 800MB rips out there. 

Good work, thanks!"
,tejay4ever,2010-11-11T18:28Z,"Dirty_Joe_Dirt: hahahah ur just hillarious man and ur so lame. if u want nice quality and shit go to movie theater. stop complaining to pluto999, and for pluto999 u are really nice guy and your movies and all these mkv formats are amazing man. i don't know why u still have a pink skull you should already be green or blue. have good day from mongolia"
,anaoluser,2010-12-08T16:27Z,"this is bad, i dwnldd n now can open it, meaning i wasted my sweet time and space for all others in it"
,racktor,2011-03-14T03:07Z,"ive downloaded 4 of your movies now, and i gotta say, good stuff.  to be honest, id rather download a 400-600 meg file in the time it would take me to go to blockbuster and back.  I dont really want to take all night with it.  im impressed with the quality of it running 720 on my 32 inch.  no issues here, and thanks for the good work."
,PSJ_47,2011-05-11T08:18Z,great movie and best rip. how did you manage to rip movies to this small size? can you advice me the software
