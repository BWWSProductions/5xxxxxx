This is a charming tale of first love, seen through the eyes of its young male protagonist. The story is set sometime in the 1980s, in an idyllic Greek village. Fifteen-year-old Alexis and his friends are at an age where curiosity about girls - what their bodies look like, how they function, how to get close to them - has started to feature foremost in their minds and actions, and results in some mischievous pranks.
Antigone is a confident young Athenian girl who joins Alexis├óΓé¼Γäó class. Her father, a policeman, has just been posted to the village. All of the boys - but Alexis in particular - are drawn to this assured, aware female who knows about life in a big city and who also seems to know a bit more about boys than they know about girls.
Alexis quickly falls head over heels for Antigone and slowly but surely starts to win her over. As the story evolves, so do his relationships with those dearest to him: his oafish father and his sagacious grandmother. However, events soon follow that will change his life...
