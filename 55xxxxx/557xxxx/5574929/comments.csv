,dlarrym,2010-05-23T07:16Z,"You need to try ang et this new flick called SPLICE! It looks awesome. Also you know a new TRON is coming out this summer starring Jeff Bridges as Flynn ( the arcade owner and software writer of games.) The trailer for it too looks great. Having said that, big time thanks for the time and effort you so freely and unconditionally give to all of us at TPB. :~)"
,dlarrym,2010-05-23T08:00Z,"@penisfuck. . . You must have been letting one of your ""out of the closet"" friends ""tea bag"" you, because if you can read the INDB, you would have known that it is spoken in english.... no subs at all and if english is the ""spoken language"", what would you need english subs. I take all this back if you are truly deaf and need the ENG subs to watch/enjoy the story/movie. This is the only possible need for your sub titles being the same as the films spoken language.      Thanks -raymondhome-! great as usual"
