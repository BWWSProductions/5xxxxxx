[T],CHD242522,2010-05-21T15:44Z,"@ meteozond, I upload to a ratio of 2.0. Then I let the swarm build so people with faster connections don't hit and run and everyone can get enough pieces. If it ends up still being stuck, I'll seed until the problems solved. With my torrents you'll never see a non seeded/dead torrent. If you want faster uploads and downloads I recommend a good private tracker. "
