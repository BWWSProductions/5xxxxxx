The Mentalist is an American crime procedural television series which debuted on September 23, 2008 on CBS. On May 20, 2009, CBS renewed The Mentalist for a second season. CBS will also move it to Thursdays at 10pm ET, following CSI. The first episode of the second season will air on September 24, 2009 in the US and on September 22 on CTV in Canada. No date has been announced for other regions. The Mentalist follows Simon Baker as Patrick Jane, an independent consultant with the now-defunct California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. He has a remarkable track record for solving serious crimes by using his amazing skills of observation. Jane also makes frequent use of his mentalist abilities and his semi-celebrity past as a psychic medium using paranormal abilities he now admits he feigned. He abandoned his pretense out of remorse when his attention-seeking behavior attracted the attention of a serial killer who killed his wife and daughter. In 2007 the real-life CBI merged with another agency to become the California Bureau of Investigation and Intelligence.
