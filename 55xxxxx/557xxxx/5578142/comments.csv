,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T15:28Z,fsxdude98:My dl speed is 0.1-0.2 kb/s.You''ll have to wait a little bit.......:)
,StaffBerlin,2010-05-21T15:40Z,"Oh Dude I don t trust you. With your first torrent uploaded you also avdise us to ignore AV malware warning? I think you are a develloper/publisher or something like that, making fun with this community.
Nobody can be so stupid to download this torrent... "
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T15:51Z,"seed guys please!!!!!!!!

thx"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T15:53Z,neither i.If i realise that this torrent is a mallware or spyware or trojan i'll report your IP to tpb and you'll be ''IP banned''.Just in case its a trojan or something like that..................
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T16:03Z,"when paranoia, the destroyer, comes knocking down your door.

he's some guy this DCrack, comes from knowhere with a nice cracked aircraft to gain ya trust then the following day, BAM POW, concorde x cracked. install, watch ya system melt into the carpet. hahaha.

i commented on his torrent last night to have a look at the concorde x, he said he'll dl and have a look but obviously he already had it. no worries people, he couldnt just come on with concorde x, it would looked even dodgier, give him the benefit of the doubt, he might have cracked it and put it up, at least wait until tested.

now who's gonna test it??? ha i'm only 10% done"
,Muckypup9,2010-05-21T16:22Z,"Do not download this shit guys!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's not a rela cracked Concorde, but contains a fucking Trojan!  I had Kaspersky alert now and not fake, I'm sure. This crap contains a Trojan Win32 PePatch.dk 

DCrack, fuck yourself, then fuck your cat, you motherfucker ass!  "
,DCrack,2010-05-21T16:37Z,"You bunch of ungrateful motherfuckers! If you think this is a virus then don't download it and STFU!!!!! What a shame, I dedicated my time to crack this because I tought everyone wanted it and this is how you thank me... Cool, if you do believe and run the concorde please post a positive comment. I said it was a false warning, running on a debugger, decompile it, run it sandboxed, whatever you want, just don't go flamming me like a moron just because your AV says it's a virus, do you know how many files give a false warning out there? Even more when they're packed... Do whatever you want, just don't insult me without basis"
,DCrack,2010-05-21T16:40Z,"BTW i've been cracking for a long time, I'm doing this FS shit because I bought FSX and wanted to try some planes... I was in the FOFF clan... I'm done excusing myself to you guys, do what you want..."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T16:50Z,"nobody's dl'd it yet so how can you tell its a virus? 
you can tell nobody has the whole concorde file cus when you stop the torrent and restart it 15mins later it runs at 700kb/s until it catches up with the rest of the peers then it runs slow again.
at least wait until its tested before shooting the man down.
its understandable that everyones paranoid, especially after the last crack that infected a few people but this looks more promising so at least wait until tested.
innocent until proven guilty and all that.
anyway, i'm testing it when i've dl'd, it looks promising to me. "
,DCrack,2010-05-21T16:53Z,"It fucking pisses me off that I'm here at the office destroyed because I stayed up all night putting this release together, and for nothing. Do you think if I wanted to spread a virus I'd do it with a 2Gb torrent? Have you even bother to check all the files that don't give false warnings? Do you think I'll go through all this trouble, to crack every plane in the release just so I can infect the concorde?? Come on guys have some common sense..."
,gamer2010,2010-05-21T17:03Z,please seeeeeed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T17:08Z,"DCrack, dont worry about it mate, if everyones flying around in the concorde later you'll be getting ya arse kissed big time and ya torrents will be full of requests to crack everything possible.
so i'll get in first haha, crack that fucking Ultimate Traffic 2, its been around for ages and still theres no crack for it. you can dl the installer from everywhere and install it as normal but when you start fsx it gives the UT2 is not activated. its the best traffic add-on there is and the only one that aint been cracked.

everyones just paranoid mate after all the talk of it being uncrackable then there was a crack a couple of weeks ago that installed a load of shit and redirect crap onto peoples systems so people are just weary. i know where ya coming from tho, at least wait until its tested before flaming and the fact your on here defending yourself and your upload should say alot to people. 
i aint got a clue what muckypup is going on about, probably connected to the developers trying to put people off dl'ing it, that shit happens as i'm sure you know."
,aarque,2010-05-21T17:14Z,"Crack, don't trip. For every comment there are a hundred quiet leechers. Komu used to crack everything and I am absolutely certain he put keyloggers and other ""zombieware"" in every one of his releases. I used his stuff and never got burned but the chance was always there. he just didn't take advantage of his ""minions.""

So it's all good. Yes we appreciate your work even if you do add spyware (I probably would) and I am not accusing. Just chill, wait for some of the respected sharers to comment - they will - then hopefully you will enjoy this community as much as we enjoy your giving us a try."
,CJ888,2010-05-21T17:16Z,"DCrack, there's some of us here that don't feel the way that the other poster's feel. I appreciate what you have done and am looking forward to the download. Hang in there buddy as there are always people that don't appreciate other's work. I think its jealousy. So take heart in that the negative posts are in a way a compliment to your abilities.

CJ"
,DCrack,2010-05-21T17:17Z,"Thanks chuckmamuck, let's hope the crack works in everyones computer :D, in my computer worked like a charm, it was actually very tricky to crack, I had to code my own DLL and load the DLL via panel.cfg and the DLL injects the code to the Concorde DL wich was very good protected, that's why unpacking it didn't work... I could have spend days looking for all the crc and checksum checks... I'm telling you all this just so people know I'm not BS anyone.
I'll tell you later how I did to bypass the installer serial check... btw write to me next week with your request, I usually don't take private request, but I'm willing to make an exception with you... does piratebay have PM's?"
,DCrack,2010-05-21T17:18Z,Thanks for the comments guys
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T17:22Z,"also you need to look at it from everyones perspective. its what this means, if this concorde crack works then the crack and somebody being able to crack the latest releases is the best thing thats happened to the community for a long time, the fsx community has been pretty stale for ages now so to everyone this crack and the fact someone is on the scene that can and wants to crack the latest products is too ggod to be true. thats pretty much why everyones doubting it, people will be thinking, well if he can crack the concorde then he crack anything and he's here on the bay.
thats why i said if you crack it then you could change ya username to jesus."
,Muckypup9,2010-05-21T17:26Z,"DCCrack, Ok, ya man, I dl' this torrent and if it will OK, then I apologize and kiss your ass in every minute. :) I'm really got a panic from the fucking viruses and this dman' alert, cos my win has fucked up many times at last week.. 
But if your work is right, I will apologize, I promise you.  :)"
,DCrack,2010-05-21T17:27Z,"aarque you can be absolutely certain that you're not going to find spyware or malware in any of my releases. And for the future when you don't trust a file run it using a program called sand box, that way you won't get infected. And trust me, there are a lot of people out there cracking the good way and for passion and fun, like me, I only do this because of the challenge and because I like, for nothing more. I was in the scene a couple of years ago and there are a lot of good guys, geniuses, doing this just for good reasons. Just so you know we crackers are not all bad ;)"
,CJ888,2010-05-21T17:30Z,"Any reason why I suddenly got a ""Error:Access denied"" message on my uTorrent client? I just tried to re-download and now at 0.4% the same message appeared and it stopped.

CJ"
,DCrack,2010-05-21T17:34Z,"Weird, I'm downloading it from the office to help you guys out because I have more upload bandwidth here and the connection good"
,CJ888,2010-05-21T17:39Z,"I just tried my other computer, and I think there's a problem with the client on my laptop. Everything is fine on my main comp so my apologies. 

CJ"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T17:41Z,"cj888
yeah i got that but i just restarted it and carried on from where i was, my percentage didnt drop.
its not uncommon, i get it alot with utorrent, it usually says it stopped cus a ""usermapped file is open"" but i never worked it out, i always start it again and it carries on from where it stopped.
weird that ya percentage dropped."
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T17:43Z,DCrack:the only thing i said is that im sure about its quality.....I dont tell you that this is a virous(if it was you'd have uploaded that torrent as anonymous.......)the only prob is that my down speed reaches 3.0 kb/s
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T17:46Z,i found a file called INSTALL USING THIS...(concorde-x).A black window appears for some secs and thenn that was.......HOw do i use it???????
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T17:47Z,please give me detailed instructions how to install PLEASE!!!!!!
,DCrack,2010-05-21T17:47Z,You have to wait for the .bin file to complete
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T17:56Z,"thanks dude.If it works be sure your torrent will be the  BEST torrent ever for fsx.Please give the steps how to install the concorde......

,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T18:00Z,"DCrack, just read ya reply about UT2. nah theres no pm option on here, not that i've ever found anyway. theres no rush mate, i was just being cheeky and joking around really. if you ever get time and feel like looking at it then we'll sort something out at the time.
thanks man, i appreciate it."
,DCrack,2010-05-21T18:02Z,"Lol, I'm just as eager as you guys to see if the concorde's gonna work on everybody's computer... I sincerely believe that the installer's not gonna be a problem, is the gauges crack the one I'm crossing my fingers for... let's wait and see. If it doesn't work I promise you I'll make it work"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T18:04Z,"only a few people are downloading.WHY

it works guys no virus in concorde-x files........."
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T18:06Z,"i dont understand the reason you've uploaded so much stuff........The citation and the concorde crack would be enough for us............

JIM:)"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T18:44Z,DCrack please give the steps to install the concorde.Its a little bit complicated.Please write a comment with them..............
,DCrack,2010-05-21T19:08Z,Just open the file called INSTALL USING THIS.bat... that's all
,DCrack,2010-05-21T19:20Z,And of course after that follow the Crack.txt instructions
,DCrack,2010-05-21T19:51Z,"Ok I need some help here, as I was seeding the file Azureus Vuze told me a piece has been corrupted and moved the torrent from seeding to downloading, now I'm stuck as one more leecher at 99.9% since nobody has that piece that's missing from me.. I tried restarting vuze , moving the data files and nothing.. any ideas? If the file indeed has become corrupted, I'm gonna have to crack it again since I don't have the original one... What do I do? It's the Citation CJ1 btw"
,DCrack,2010-05-21T20:01Z,Did a force recheck and nothing
,DCrack,2010-05-21T20:18Z,Downloaded the file again and cracked it and nothing... it must be the timestamp that differs from the original.. is there a way for me to remove that file and add it again?
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T21:06Z,has TPB just been down for a while? not been able to get on in the UK for the last couple of hours.
,DCrack,2010-05-21T21:34Z,"Yeah, that's what I'm doing... but the upload speed as a leecher sucks, don't know why"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T21:35Z,"hey DCrack, who's kassie? ;)"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T21:47Z,"tpb was down for a while.Thatswhy the speed sucks.Their servers have not been refreshed yet.This is not the only prob.DCrack when u upload a torrent with vuze(azureus),click ''OPEN FOR SEEDING WHEN DONE''.thats the problem dude..............."
,DCrack,2010-05-21T21:57Z,Lol my girlfriend
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T22:23Z,what?????
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T22:26Z,lol. i saw it when i was messing about with the crack.
,DCrack,2010-05-21T22:37Z,"Ok guys, I changed the corrupted file priority to do not download and I'm back seeding :D all back to normal now, what sucks is that the CJ1 will not be available in this release, I'll post it in another torrent"
,Jimstalk,2010-05-21T22:53Z,so we will download the new one right????I suggest you to delete this one..........DO NOT FORGET THE CONCORDE FILES!!!!!
,DCrack,2010-05-21T22:57Z,"For those of you who think the concorde is not real:

,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T23:07Z,"DC, whatever you did man it worked cus i've just got a burst of speed and shot from 53 to 60%
its getting there"
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T00:05Z,i m downloading this one still almost all day what shouls i do now should i deleted it and wait foe new one ???? i m at 61 %
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T00:08Z,i we deleted this wery slowly torrent and i m waiting for new upload !!!!
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T00:09Z,"gamer2010.
nah man dont delete it, im at 63%, we'll be done soon. what DC meant was the corrupted file was the cj1 aircraft so he's skipped that and he'll re-upload that aircraft seperately, he's not deleting the whole torrent else it'll put everything back to square one. theres no point deleting the whole torrent when only 1 of the many files is corrupted, the corrupted file will be uploaded later. i'm sure thats what he meant."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T00:13Z,"its slow cus theres loads of us trying to dl that 1 file, the concorde, im connected to shitloads of peers, we're all at the same place 63% cus it cant go any quicker, we're all draining DC's bandwidth between us. if you dl the concorde again you'll catch up to 63% again within minutes but then be back at the same place as we all are. 
if DC re-ups it it wont be quicker cus we'll all just dl it again and drain his bandwidth and make it slow.
patience is the key"
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T00:14Z,yes well i we already deleted it besides it doesn t have seeds so there s not much diference so i m trying tomorow if there be more seeds !
,DCrack,2010-05-22T02:41Z,"Sorry lost connection for a while, I'm back up and full throttle! What's the ET for the concorde? "
,DCrack,2010-05-22T05:40Z,"Actually I didn't test the citation X, I didn't know it was such a big deal until I uploaded it... let me check it"
,DCrack,2010-05-22T05:46Z,"Mmm yeah it seems the gauge is not cracked... let me see if I can do it tonight, I'll let you know...
Sorry, my bad, I believed this plane was 100% working, obviously I didn't test it properly... I'll see what I can do. Please as soon as someone has some feedback on the concorde let me know"
,DCrack,2010-05-22T06:44Z,"What a relief! Thanks dude!

though Concorde X doesn't work for me, installation went ok and no problems, i rebooted after install and launched fsx. Everything looked allright and the concorde was available in the aircraft browser, but once i started my flight i got an error from Flight sim labs, the error code was 1082.
im running windows 7 64 bit btw. 

Anyone got it working yet?"

unbelievable. just need to work out how to fly it now cus it looks seriously complicated.
thanks Jesus, you're a fuckin legend."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T09:10Z,"jim
when you click on the INSTALL USING THIS just wait a few minutes before you click the ok button and it find the .bin and work.
i had that problem cus i was clicking ok immediately but after i waited a few mins it worked when i clicked ok."
,DCrack,2010-05-22T09:14Z,"Lol thanks man, glad it worked! Everyone enjoy!
Hope you all trust me now, btw my torrents are only published under my name, don't get fooled in the future.
Whenever I have some free time I'll look for something nice to crack ;)

,Jimstalk,2010-05-22T09:19Z,no no its not that the problem.For win7 users they'll have to run it as an administrator.........

you can go and enjoy ya weekend away now. ha 
thanks again man, i really appreciate it.

well it works everybody, i'm running windows 7 64bit and its perfect."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T09:26Z,"jim
i couldnt run the INSTALL USING THIS as administrator cus when i clicked compatability i couldnt check the box, it was greyed out. i ran as administrator from right click and it still did the same. it was only when i left it for 2 mins it worked and installed. how did you manage to check the run as administrator box? it was unclickable for me using win7 64bit, i had full priviledges also but it was greyed out. 
anyway its installed and working so sweeeet"
,Neon.Bbq,2010-05-22T09:32Z,"Yesss works perfectly :D

The problem i had was due to me running fsx in xp comp. mode.

is somebody can upload the Cessna O-1/L-19 Bird Dog by Sibwings "
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T09:56Z,how long i have to wait until instaler is done i havent press ok yet ???
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T10:03Z,i ve run it as administator and nothing hapend '??
,Jimstalk,2010-05-22T10:03Z,well i have problems.....I have completed the installation successfully but when i load the concorde i cant move the throttle flaps dont work parking brake doesnt work it the sound is off.I  click ''q''  in order to enable the sound (i hear the engines for one second) and then again the ''sound off'' bar appears.........................Any ideas?????
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T10:03Z,"gamer, just wait a couple of minutes after clicking INSTALL USING THIS, after a couple of mins click ok and it will work, thats the only way i could get it to work and i only realised it by ctumbling across it by accident.
the run as administrator didnt work for me, just keep trying it, if it doesnt work after 2 mins that wait a little longer until it finds the bin file ok."
,i9core,2010-05-22T10:04Z,"DC i haven't test the crack yet still downloading.  Anyway, thanks ppl like you exist so we can enjoy new flight sim product. "
,Jimstalk,2010-05-22T10:06Z,"STEPS in order to run as administrator:
1)right click on the .EXE FILE!!!!
2)properties
3)Compatibility
4)and then check the box ''run as administrator''

or


right click on the exe and select run as administrator..............

worked on me"
,i9core,2010-05-22T10:07Z,To DC it would be nice if you can crack ariane 737-800 since it's crack by komu. (Stll not fully crack)

,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T10:20Z,"jim
so run as administrator worked for you on the concordex_v1.0, it didnt work for me, i just got a different error about not locating the bin file.
run as admin didnt work on either, looks like gamer2010 is having the same problem i did then if run as admin aint working for him. "
,i9core,2010-05-22T10:23Z,product i think worth to crack is those aerosoft product that use new ascrypt.dll

it doesnt work, we're using 64bit so maybe thats the problem. i've installed it and been flying it for a couple of hours now but the only way i could run it was by clicking INSTALL USING THIS and waiting for it to locate the bin file before clicking ok, run as admin didnt work, thats the first thing i tried and then compatability mode but that didnt work either. clicking run as admin worked for you but it didnt me and it isnt gamer2010 either, thats what i'm trying to say. i managed to get it installed by waiting for it to locate the bin file but that aint working for gamer2010 either. run as admin was obviously the first thing you try. 
even clicking the concordex_v1.0 as an administrator it came up with the error ""bin_v1.0-0 is missing from the instalation"" run as admin made no difference. i managed to get past it but gamer2010 is having trouble to get past, he's tried run as admin also but its not working for him like it didnt work for me.
it me must be a difference with 64bit."
,i9core,2010-05-22T10:43Z,i'm also using win7 64bit and i got the same problem as chuckmamuck got here
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T10:51Z,i have vista sp2 32 bit or x86 do i need anything else instaled to make this torrent work
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T10:52Z,"i9core
yeah i think its a problem with the cmd in 64bit.
i've just tried it again and the only thing that works is to click INSTALL USING THIS, just click it without run as administrator. the cmd box will appear and dcracks box which says click ok.
dont click ok, just leave it, i've just tried it again and i waited 3mins and it worked when i clicked ok.
so just click on install using this so you have the cmd box and dcracks box open then leave it for 3 mins before you click ok. it works trust me, i've already installed but i just tried it again.
wait 3mins before clicking ok."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T11:03Z,"gamer2010 and core i9
its the user account control, ive just disabled uac and tried it and it works as soon as you click the batch file.

Thank you again, and although I do not this too often, but now I shame me, because I pushed my ass comment here first. The plane fly like a dream, all fonctions totally OK on Win7x64 and XP32bit too!

,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T21:43Z,"this concorde seems to run better the more you use it, at first it was taking a few seconds to change views etc but now after starting fsx a few times and flying it it runs smooth like any other aircraft, its not really that heavy on the frames either considering how detailed and good it is.
just need to learn how to fly it now without crashing it, ive made FL390 and 600kts but i cant get any faster without the engines on fire.

F1 cessna 441 works fine. nice also, and fast.
all the eglesoft sr20 and sr22 versions work fine.
eaglesoft raytheon versions all work fine.

if you installed that other concorde then you might have to clear the remains from your system and clean ya registry also. you could have some parts of it left over that wasnt removed.
thats all i can think of, you wont be installing wrongly cus the installer and crack are easy to use."
,gamer2010,2010-05-23T00:54Z,i think the best way is to reinstal fs and delete all folders then it should instal corectly 
,aarque,2010-05-23T02:17Z,"Hey Crack, you have become an internet sensation, how about that? Your Concorde is already showing up at the warezing websites, incredible huh?

Maybe you should run for president. 

So anyway, if you're looking for a challenge, you could do the Level-D 767. The only decent crack for it requires the user to change the ID if his hard drive to mimic the HD of the guy that released it. Personally I'd be into the CaptainSim 767, but I haven't seen an installer or rip available..."

id you track back thru the comments DC said he had a problem with the torrent, it took him from seeding to dl'ing at 99.9% and was stuck. the problem was the cj1 aircraft got corrupted so he had to disable that file to return to seeding the torrent.
basically you've got whats available so if you open the dl'd files now you'll have all the aircraft apart from the cj1. they'll work cus the torrent was split into seperate files for each aircraft, it wasnt just all put in 1 file.
open the torrent now and you'll see you've got it all but the cj1."

and what is this rig n roll bollox, sounds like some shit a 10yr old plays on a fuckin wii

if ya wanna be his apprentice u have to go thru initiation where he beats ya round the face with his big fat veiny cock then rams it into ya eye socket and skull fucks ya brains.

anyways, if you wanna be a serial requester, try uploading some stuff and sharing, ya know, earn it, otherwise its just like parasites in a feeding frenzy sucking the life away.
i see people come on here who share nothing and constantly make demands like the uploaders and crackers are just their little joey bitches here to meet their demands and provide everything they want. it aint like that.you look thru the torrents and try to find requests from people who upload and share, its rare you'll find any and if ya do its usually a 1 off, its always the ones that never share anything. 
just take what ya given which is fuckin plenty and be thankful. and also if ya gonna request then it only needs saying once, not like that kid who's appeared plastering every torrent about wanting an ol bird dog.

i tried the UT2 installer a couple of weeks ago and i've had no traffic since. dont know why i tried it cus i knew i wouldnt activate it.
anyway, i uninstalled it and reinstalled my traffic X 2010 and no traffic appeared so i uninstalled that and now i dont get any default traffic either. i've replaced back-ups i made of the cfg files before UT2 but still no default airport traffic, just ground vehicles and no aircraft.

Hmmm - that cant be true! Since 3 days 0 Seeders 9/10 leechers. Not only here in the web, also in the torrent-client...

99,9%, but all files are ready on the harddisk. Think, something goes wrong"
,PyrateStyle,2010-05-25T20:44Z,"The Cessna Citation X 2.0 crashes 15 minutes after flight. Anyone else experience this problem? 

After initializing the avionics and setting a course, 15 minutes into the flight everything shuts down on the plane. Engines, avionics and can't restart them. Replicated 4 times and FSpassengers doesn't recognize the failure when declairing a state of emergency. "
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-25T22:22Z,"pilotensitz01
100% aint available, there was a problem with a file that got corrupted so the uploader bypassed it. the corrupted file is the cj1 so its not complete, the rest of the files are good tho so you've got everything thats available.
the uploader said he'll re-upload the cj1 when he has the time."
,DominoFly,2010-05-26T03:48Z,"PyrateStyle

Yes, I can confirm the Citation X 2.0 seems broken. Mine also shuts off all power 15 mins or so into the flight, and there's simply no restarting it. You'll find the main BATT switches are both off, and you can't toggle them back on again, so the kite is basically 'dead' in the sky. Makes for a helluva forced landing though :)

Seems Citation X 2.0 IS NOT FULLY CRACKED yet. DC ... wanna investigate for us?"
,bubba1991,2010-05-26T05:29Z,"DCrack i have a great plane for u to crack

QW 757 i have installer and Serial but it will install and do exactly what the concorde does.  if you want me to upload to media upload so you can crack it email me at 
bubba1991@dval.info"
,DCrack,2010-05-27T03:52Z,"Sorry guys, I've been incredibly busy... is there anyone else having the citation x problem? If so, I'll check it out"
,fsexer,2010-05-27T04:30Z," DCrack  I can confirm Citation X goes down after 30 min.  Processmon shows FSX looking for CX750.Lic in the main C:/Eaglesoft Development Group folder - not found.  I tried a dummy .lic file but didn't work.  Any chance to look at this?

You da man DCrack, thansk for a smokin UL!!!"
,GWBushJnr,2010-05-27T14:15Z,"DCrack thanks for your wonderful job.
Regarding citation2, it looks like unchecking the exe in the esftchk5.dll releases the time limitation.
About UT2, maybe you could try the following: make a new fsx.cfg. Launch FSX again: you shouldn't have any traffic. Next compile a new traffic file and see what happens."
,Jimstalk,2010-05-27T19:00Z,please upload VRS SUPERBUGx.Highly detailed interior and exterior.The first fsx military aircraft wich can throw missiles&rockets!!!!
,crabmeat07,2010-05-27T22:35Z,"thnx, all of it downloaded very fast till I hit 99.9% done then it went to 7 hours ETA. lol will wait it out!! nice download ty very much!! DCrack"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-27T22:46Z,"crabmeat.
you'll be waiting a long time cus 99.9% is all thats available. 1 of the aircraft got corrupted whilst the uploader was seeding so he bypassed it to be able to continue seeding the torrent.
basically you have everything apart from the cj1 aircraft which aint complete and will need re-uploading. open the mega pack folder now and start installing the airctaft man, they're all in seperate files so you're able to open them apart from the corrupted file."
,crabmeat07,2010-05-27T23:38Z,"@ chuckmamuck, thanks very much, I appreciate the info"
