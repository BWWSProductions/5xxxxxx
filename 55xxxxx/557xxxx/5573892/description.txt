This is a small collection of modern arabic music, 32 pieces in total. It is in the free OGG audio file format. Most players should be able to play it. If not, I would recommend VLC Media player from http://www.videolan.org/vlc . Enjoy!

Please note that these OGGs were converted from mp3s, so their quality might not be as good.... Don't ask for the mp3s. I don't have them anymore.
