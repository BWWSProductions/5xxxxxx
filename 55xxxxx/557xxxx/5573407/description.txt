Combining old-school rhyming with soulful beats, the Washington D.C. duo Panacea have drawn comparisons to revered hip-hoppers like the Roots, Gang Starr, and A Tribe Called Quest. Panacea blend Native Tongues-inspired beats with warm major chords and soul samples and add smart, conscious rhymes about life, love, and of course, hip hop."
