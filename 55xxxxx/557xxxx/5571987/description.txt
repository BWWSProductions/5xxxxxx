With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa is a World War II memoir by Eugene 

Sledge, a United States Marine. Since its first publication in 1981, With the 

Old Breed has been recognized as one of the best first-hand accounts of 

combat in the Pacific during World War II. The memoir is based on notes 

Sledge kept tucked away in a pocket-sized Bible he carried with him during 

battles.


I dl this torrent from Demonoid and upped it here, since I couldnÂ´t find it 

here when searching for it.  

All of you that have seen The Pacifiic (The series) recently might enjoy this 

book extra much, it is written by Eugene Sledge based upon the 

"memoirs/notes" he wrote at Peleliu, Okinawa, etc.

This is some heavy shit, very unlike todays soldiers leaning on much 

technology to get the job done. Remember as much as 1/3 of their frind were 

killed on some battles so I canÂ´t help thinking this was written with a lot 

om motions, witch in my eyes just made it better.

Happy reading folks!
