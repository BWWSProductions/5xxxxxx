,chucktg69,2010-06-10T09:52Z,I would like to thank you for torrenting these audiobooks.  Have you tried listening to anything by Lincoln Child & Douglas Preston.  Pendergast is a great character  I think you would enjoy.  To all those wondering about downloading this series.  It's really good.  Thanks a ton for doing this again.  If you ever take requests I could give you a lot of good choices.
