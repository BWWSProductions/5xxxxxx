,sebastiansson,2010-05-21T11:34Z,Seed please..
,sebastiansson,2010-05-21T12:48Z,This is pissing me off...
,hdlover,2010-05-21T13:50Z,Dwnload stops at 735 MB please seed
,bigthrane,2010-05-21T15:14Z,SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[T],CHD242522,2010-05-21T15:45Z,"@ sebastiansson, hdlover and bigthrane, I upload to a ratio of 2.0. Then I let the swarm build so people with faster connections don't hit and run and everyone can get enough pieces. If it ends up still being stuck, I'll seed until the problems solved. With my torrents you'll never have a non seeded/dead torrent. If you want faster uploads and downloads I recommend a good private tracker. "
,edisonmk,2010-05-21T16:26Z,"Thanks CHD242522 for uploading the first (and still only one) 720p version. Still,as users said, we are stuck downloading on this, and myself on 2 other of your torrents (Grey's Anatomy). I hope we get it done. Again, thanks for the upload, there were no other HD versions available at the time, and for this one there still isn't."
,AmAziA,2010-05-21T16:39Z,"@CHD242522 i understand why you want it to swarm a bit before you continue to seed but my plan is to watch some of these shows TODAY so when will you start seeding again? How big of a swarm do you want?
Anyway thanks for the upload! i think..."
,hooghlyrocks,2010-05-21T16:41Z,it's well stuck!  common you @sses - don't just download then drop of!  is really rude!
,myryad,2010-05-21T19:04Z,"Hey CHD, get a faster upload connection!  I want to watch this NOW dammit, NOW NOW NOW!"
