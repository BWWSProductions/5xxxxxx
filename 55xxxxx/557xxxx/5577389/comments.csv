[V],poppedtart,2010-05-21T22:55Z,"Yea maybe.

Went up town today and was driving back and stopped at the dollar store and my dogs were there...  Someone let the dogs out of my house after I left.  Luckily we were there in time before someone made off with them.  One lady had my Maltese in her stroller!

Just ordered some new pet tags online for them.  Dogs are dumb I swear, just go home with anyone."
