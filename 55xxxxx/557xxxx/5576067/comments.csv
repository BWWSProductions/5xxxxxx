,mantibone,2010-06-09T18:26Z,"you are the fucking man kingdom, i don't understand how some of your br rips look so damn good cause they are so small, i thought the bigger the better before i d/l your 720P copy of burn after reading a a long time ago, 700MB and it looked perfect. whodaman youdaman"
,mantibone,2010-06-09T18:59Z,"oh yeah and leto why don't you lighten your dark levels if you don't like a real picture. i guess you prefer a washed out pic where you can see in the dark. i do not like to see what im not supposed to before light hits it. and its a dark movie for the most part kinda eery.  TiGORiN almost all of secretmyths releases are the shit, leto just doesn't know wtf he's talking about, my 10 yr old nephew always chooses the darker pic when i adjust the gamma and black levels. cause when somethings supposed to be bright its still bright. i can't see in the dark in real life.

,pratikmisal6988,2010-06-16T00:50Z,"Hey SecretMyth ! I am your Big Fan of the all the BRRips you Upload. I downloaded lots of them too.

But I am quit DISAPPOINTED when I saw that the Audio of your 2012 BRRip was slagging behind. Then I thought no no that would be some of my Codec Problem. So I Updated My Codecs (Actually was Up-to-Date) then Tried that Movie, but no use gives the same Problem. So I tried on another Computer, my Friend's Computers...etc..etc. But no use ! :-(
So I thought there would be some thing..Leave it !

Then I downloaded your The Spy Next Door BRRip. That worked Extremely Fine !

Then I Downloaded Avatar 2009 DVDScr and Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009 BRRip. These Movies are also giving the same ""Audio Lacking Behind"" Problem.

And this problem is Not faced by me only. My Friends to Face Same.
Help me Out Man.....!
Your Rips has the Awesome Crystallity in A & V both, thus I Like U.
So tell me What to do Now !  :-|"
,c3bhm,2010-07-08T03:43Z,"Good lord - the quality of this is AMAZING for the file-size.
SecretMyth versions of any movie are the only way to go.
There are so many 1.4 gig movies out there that don?t look much better than a 700mb version, so what are they doing wrong when this is just .3 gigs bigger and yet looks like it?s 720p on TV...!

Whatever encoding this is, it needs to be the standard for EVERYTHING. Spread the word..."
,samik1989,2010-07-25T23:47Z,"hi secret-myth....i am big fan of your high quality rips....i have a request,can u pls rip & upload the movie ""in the mood for love""...bcoz the other releases(of this movie) here are quite grainy...hope u will upload one"
,lsassexe,2010-10-08T17:53Z,Perfect quality! Definitely worth downloading!
,SURLEWEB,2010-11-11T19:06Z,"Yes, altough I was afraid that the small size ( for a HD movie ) would impact on the video quality, I must admit that it is a very good copy...how is it possible ?
Thanks a lot"
