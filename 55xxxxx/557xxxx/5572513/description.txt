This is scanned in The Barefoot Man's Typical Tropical Cruisin' Boozin' Song Book by H. G. Nowak. The Barefoot Man is a musician from the Cayman Islands playing Caribbean music. A great book with lyrics, notes, chords, drink recipes, and stories. If you like this, visit him at www.barefootman.com I would recommend his book "Which Way to the Islands" as a must read.
