The Vanishment of Haruhi Suzumiya or The Disapperance of Haruhi Suzumiya or æ¶¼å®®ãƒãƒ«ãƒ’ã®æ¶ˆå¤± or Suzumiya Haruhi no ShÅshitsu

Since the original file name is [Mazui]_Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu_[LQ][443A6A97] it's pretty obvious that I neither recorded nor subbed this.

About the subtitles: If you're using VLC, just right click on the video, mouse over Subtitles Track and choose Track 1 - English. If you're using another kind of player, I'm not really sure how it's done, but the subtitles might not show right away. You have to select it.

I forgot where I got this torrent though. I don't really feel like looking it up again.

Anyway, here are some information sites:
