'Shadows' is the ninth studio album from the Scottish power-pop band Teenage Fanclub. Five years since their 2005 release 'Man-Made', the Glaswegians wind down the jangly-pop of previous albums here, maturing towards dulcet harmonised rocksongs, such as the piano led 'Dark Clouds'. However the alternating songwriters of Norman Blake, Raymond McGinley and Gerard Love provide the band's trademark melodic, hook-filledsound on single 'Baby Lee'.
