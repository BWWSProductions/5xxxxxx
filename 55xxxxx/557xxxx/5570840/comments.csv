I'll try my best to help."
,rd31,2010-05-19T14:56Z,Can someone please confirm that this works with no virus? I read the instructions and am kind of leery of replacing anything in my windows/system32 folder.
,byteguy,2010-05-19T16:34Z,"This is the most simple and effective solution I have ever seen. It works perfectly and easily. 
Thank you DenyGod--you ARE the man!!!"
,7seven77,2010-05-19T19:55Z,"Thanks! 
This is the way to do it! 
Download the latest version direct from Adobe, quick download and then use this crack! 

Great stuff! "
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-05-20T05:19Z,"I'm kind of unsure, why do you upload in zip ?
You dont need to ZIP it. 

Your account got banned ?  "
,mrgrinder,2010-05-20T18:04Z,"Lol the most obvious fake torrent ever 611 BYTES for the entire program?
Nice Try."
,DenyGod,2010-05-21T01:25Z,"Read the torrent description. 

I can't fathom why people are so goddamn stupid. "
,derailer,2010-05-22T11:48Z,"How will this work when it becomes to updates?
Eventually there will be updates for CS5  from Adobe with improvements, fixing bugs etc. Can I update or am I stuck with this version forever."
,Logic0104,2010-05-23T13:49Z,"This is quite safe, its actually the best way because you download the Trial from Adobe and Just replace the Host which tells the App that it is now Full version and Not Trial which prevents the Application from Deactivating. Wicked or what. Big thanks From Me So Everyone show thier Apprieciation and SEED It"

,superfunk7734,2010-05-30T02:48Z,works like a charm. thanks DenyGod!
,OsgoodeLawyer,2010-05-30T16:31Z,"tomoliver: if the serial doesn't work on install, just install as a trial and then put the serial in when you run it for the first time.  it'll work then."
,YoeriGod,2010-05-30T20:08Z,"Thanks a lot!
I have to say, I absolutely love the readme...

,rostau,2010-06-10T05:31Z,"OK so I opened the hosts file and I noted the following additions:
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

Very clever. 127.0.0.1 is an old trick for blocking unwanted sites.

Are these PS- specific? Or will they work to block Illustrator et al from communicating w/ Adobe?  If so that's great... except for people who actually purchased some software from Adobe.... :-o   "
,Razorheart,2010-06-11T14:14Z,"I installed the program, but it did not create a C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\ folder.

Suggestions anybody?"

,jboi82,2010-06-14T10:29Z,"can't get any more simple than this, good stuff "
,5nark,2010-06-14T21:33Z,"Razorheart. Maybe your computer is not on, or your computer is not a Windows machine, but most likely your folder settings are set to not show system files. "
,100bugs,2010-06-15T06:25Z,"The host file is part of windows (not adobe) so if it doesn't show up it's because your windows software is set to hide system files.

127.0.0.1 is the address of your computer. So, when those adobe links are called, they are redirected to the adress of your computer. In clear, the computer is calling itself instead of calling adobe.

An other way of preventing your computer from calling those adobe links is to instruct your firewall. So, you can simply put those links into the blocked zone. With this method, you don't need to alter your host file.

Regarding the updates, they will not be possible if they are done from one of those blocked adobe links. We need to know which link provides the updates."
,bencooke86,2010-06-16T07:30Z,"right so i follow all the instructions to a tee, and then when i open photoshop up at the last, stick in a serial number, it starts the final install and then at about 10% through gives me error 6 and terminates. how do i fix this?"

This does work on 64bit, I've tested it several times.

Remember, this will only work if steps 1-4 are completed without a hitch. You skip or fail a step, and the whole crack fails.

,elite-sky,2010-10-07T02:44Z,".................................................
ok ima write DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS for thoes that are getting confused.
.................................................
1. install as usual
2. when it asks you for a serial number during install do not enter one just click on 'install as trial'
3. once the trial version has installed go to this location C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc in there you will find your hosts file
4. download this pre-modified hosts file http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5570840/Adobe_Photoshop_CS5_Extended_%28Crack___Instructions%29
5.once downloaded use winrar or winzip to extract the modified hosts file too you desktop
6. copy and past into C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc
7.replace the old hosts file with this one and YOUR DONE! just enter a serial for adobe and it wont call home to check the serial which means its activated forever.

Enjoy!! "
,Jeroen1302,2010-10-07T16:22Z,"Excuse me but I've never used torrents before. I think I downloaded the file, Adobe_Photoshop_CS5_Extended_(Crack___Instructions).5570840.TPB, but I can't unzip it. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong or forgot to do?"
,supadupa10,2010-10-07T23:20Z,"This is so awesome!  It worked first time.  However, I do get the ""enter serial number"" box each time I start it.  Clicking cancel runs the prog as normal.  Not a biggie.

BTW I would recommend that people make a copy of the original hosts file before overwriting it - just in case you want / need to go back.


@Jeroen1302 you need to download the torrent with a torrent program.  Utorrent is a good one.

Then you download this zipped torrent with Utorrent and open it with a zip program to access the folder. 7zip is a good utility.

You'll need to practice - once you got it, you'll never look back! "
,supadupa10,2010-10-07T23:22Z,The other question is - would this method work for all other CS5 apps ?  I'm after dreamweaver cs5 !

,listenherenow,2010-10-09T10:41Z,"I am going to try this.   i tried to do the cs 4 thing and I got all confused and then just blew it off. 

  I was wondering if you tried this on the premium cs5 - do you think it will work in that or do you think It's a waste of time to try it out? 
"
,listenherenow,2010-10-10T05:15Z,"I waited to see if anyone would reply to that premoer question but - I guess i will have to just try it eh? 

  lol"
,listenherenow,2010-10-10T07:36Z,"OK. 

  here is the deal: 


1330-1036-2793-5476-2605-5729
1330-1193-9982-0310-7670-2199
1330-1470-0441-6829-3063-2553  

  NONE of these are any good.  the intructions are followed to the letter without any variation what~so~ever.   
   I was not brave enough to try the premium thing that I was asking about in the previouse post. I am sure that it will not work becuase I looked up some codes for that and although the ones I looked up are probably not valid - they did all seem to be related numerically and very different from these three invalid ones listed in your instructions. 

   I am wondering now if I branded as an ass in the adobe site with my account being associated with these three failed attempts. 

  The host file is put exactly where it should be.

 So I guess this does not work anylonger for some reason.  

  The system is athalon 2 2800X4 running 64bit windows 7 legit.    No issues there. It just didnt work. 

let me know if there is something else to try if you can. i still need PS and I was looking forward to useing this. i will be useing it till it runs to the shit river in 30 days.  But something permenant and simple to load up is what I need. 

   I cannot help but think there must be something missed here since 14713 people are seeding this.    But I also hav ethe feeling that I am just too late and its been blocked by adobe somhow. 

  I will keep checking back.   

Thanks./
"
,listenherenow,2010-10-10T07:44Z,"LOL:   Supadupa10, 

  I just read this post above mine here. 

  says that you ""I do get the ""enter serial number"" box each time I start it. Clicking cancel runs the prog as normal. Not a biggie."" 

  LOL  the reason that is happening is because it DID NOT WIRK and in 30 days you will have no PS .   LOL 

  how awesome is that?    also means that you don't pay attention and did not follow the instructions at all ior you would know that you need to have a free account and you need to use a serial number.    If It worked you would no longer get that box that says enter the serial . 

 Ya Goof!   LOL    no offense. ( well a little offense since you are a bit slow. ) 

   So If You think it's awesome to run the 30 day trial and then have nothing - then you are good to go bro. LOL

If someone like me can do this, then you know it must be truly simple. 

I can't tell you how happy I am! I am an amateur photographer, and using CS2 just wasn't cutting it anymore. You directions were clear, concise, and EASY! I really don't understand how ANYONE could have a problem with this.

Anyone should be able to do this. You don't have to be a ""computer whiz""  to install this. Just follow the instructions exactly.

The longest part of the install I experienced was downloading the trial version from their web site. It took one full hour with Verizon DSL. The first time I oened the program I put in the included KEY. The second time I opened the program it asked me if I wanted to sign in for CS Live and I said No but there is an option to sign in later anyway. How about receiving updates or signing in for CS Live?? Is it recommended? TAHNKS AGAIN FOR A GREAT UPLOAD!!!!!

,cs7484a,2011-01-07T04:15Z,"I'm having a little bit of trouble with the programme.

Just so this is clear, I have been using a cracked Photoshop CS3 on my computer for for 2 years, without problems. I am running Windows Vista 32bit.

I followed all of the steps in the torrent in order: the program installed (trial version), I swapped the host file and plugged in the first serial in the .txt. Everything worked and installed properly.

When I opened the program and tried to open one of my .PSDs from Photoshop CS3, all that appeared was a black square. I couldn't manipulate the image at all. I also tried to open a new document, with the same result. 

Has anyone else had this problem?"

There's a bunch of crap included in that torrent, but the file you are interested in is the one called ""CS5 activation DLL.exe"".  Just ignore the other stuff. The exe is an archive that contains two files amtlib (2).dll and amtlib.dll.

The one called amtlib (2).dll is for 64bit Photoshop and the other one is for 32bit. 
Go to the folder where Photoshop is installed and rename or delete the amtlib.dll file there, then just copy the correct file from the archive over (rename amtlib (2).dll to amtlib.dll if you're on 64bit). 

This worked for me at least."

,FatFreddy465,2011-05-12T19:47Z,"It does work, check my torrent.


    So you want Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended but are too cheap to pay for it? No worries. I'll be showing you how to get it for 

free. These instructions are 100% safe and completely idiot-proof. No fancy key generators or other bullshit required.

Note: This will only work on Windows (XP and above) both 32 and 64bit.


Ok, lets get started.

==========================================================================================
==========================================================================================





-----------------------------------[Step #1]----------------------------------- 

First you want to download and install the Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended trial from the Adobe website. (You're going to need a 

free account.) URL:

https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=photoshop&loc=en_us 









-----------------------------------[Step #2]-----------------------------------

Then once the trial is installed, make sure Photoshop is closed and navigate to this directory:

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\









-----------------------------------[Step #3]-----------------------------------

There is a zip archive included in this torrent (titled ""main resource""). Inside the archive there's a file titled ""hosts"". 

Extract this file to your desktop, then drag it to the above directory (drivers\etc). It should ask if you want to overwrite or 

replace the file. CLick ""Yes"" or ""ok"". 

If you have trouble overwriting, take ownership of your original ""hosts"" file then try replacing it again. Google this: ""how to 

take ownership of a file"".






-----------------------------------[Step #4]-----------------------------------

Almost done. Open Photoshop. There will be a window asking for a serial number. Use one of these:

1330-1036-2793-5476-2605-5729
1330-1193-9982-0310-7670-2199
1330-1470-0441-6829-3063-2553 







-----------------------------------[Step #5]-----------------------------------

You're done, enjoy. :)

,anonymouspm,2011-05-15T10:01Z,"Dont Do this!

The hosts file manipulates the way your browser tranlsates the URL of a website into the IP of the website.

The File creates an address book type of list, so your borwser doesnt have to request the IP address of websites from the ISP every time it trys to connect.

This Host file that is available for download here changes the way your browser follows links from google. 

It is known as ' The google redirect virus' and is almost untraceable to McAfee , norton and AVG.

When you click on a link from a google search results page, it automatically redirects you to a 3rd party advertisement / spam website. This is very frustrating.

Stop seeding and downloading people"

,jbswear,2011-07-10T00:30Z,Okay...so I've tried what woo said on page nine.  I cut and pasted the .dll file for 64bit into the main CS5.1 folder.  Win7 asked whether I had Admin rights.  I clicked yes and it pasted.  I got no notice that I was over writing anything.  I then tried to start PS and enter a serial code.  What am I doing wrong?  If you can email me at jbswearingen @ gmail dot com I'd appreciate it.
,Lovehatewin,2011-07-17T02:51Z,"@ wingfoo   WORKS LIKE A CHARM!!!! 7/17/2011


If you are having trouble getting this to work, follow the instructions and install Photoshop, then download this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6076932/Adobe_Photoshop_CS5_Extended_Activator_by_Carlos_Manuel_Virus_FR

There's a bunch of crap included in that torrent, but the file you are interested in is the one called ""CS5 activation DLL.exe"". Just ignore the other stuff. The exe is an archive that contains two files amtlib (2).dll and amtlib.dll.

The one called amtlib (2).dll is for 64bit Photoshop and the other one is for 32bit. 
Go to the folder where Photoshop is installed and rename or delete the amtlib.dll file there, then just copy the correct file from the archive over (rename amtlib (2).dll to amtlib.dll if you're on 64bit). 

This worked for me at least.

,Batdawg,2011-07-21T09:01Z,"I've got the same problem jbswear and phiiillliiip have. I think this only works for older versions of CS5, and not CS5.1 that I have.

,PinkEgg99,2011-07-21T10:37Z,"I did what wingfoo advised, but the screen that pops up when you open Photoshop (to either enter the verification code or just continue the trial) doesn't pop up anymore. (And I can't find where you can click to get it to pop up, I feel dumb lol)

if you've used an invalid serial, a green check will show, however it will go to a screen prompting an adobe account to be created

if you've used a valid serial the window will disappear and the program will open immediately- just keep trying with serials until this happens!

""For an endless trial mode, just delete the folder ""C:\ProgramData\Adobe\SLStore"" before opening the program.

In this way, you can have the 3D features of the ""extended"" version.""

Worked with 64bit."

1330-1363-1206-9398-1328-8912

As the serials in this torrent (3 of them) didnt work for v5.1 (As it states mind!) But the hosts file was the bit needed so THANX AGAIN!"

Am I doing anything wrong or will it still work after day 0 if I just type in a new keygene everytime I start it?? I really want a ""unlimited"" Photoshop whitout buying it.. :/"

Oh well.  On to find a virus/crack."
,mx201er,2012-03-16T23:57Z,"@macw86

Your host file needs to be original when you do installation, that may be your problem.. it asked me to put in a cd for installation when mine was already swapped.

But as said above, it still says they are unable to start your subscription and will not let you run it.."
,mx201er,2012-03-17T00:35Z,"@winfoo

You are AWESOME! I was hung up on the ""cannot start your subscription"" after the serial, and your post fixed it.

""From Wingfoo:
If you are having trouble getting this to work, follow the instructions and install Photoshop, then download this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6076932/Adobe_Photoshop_CS5_Extended_Activator_by_Carlos_Manuel_Virus_FR

There's a bunch of crap included in that torrent, but the file you are interested in is the one called ""CS5 activation DLL.exe"". Just ignore the other stuff. The exe is an archive that contains two files amtlib (2).dll and amtlib.dll.

The one called amtlib (2).dll is for 64bit Photoshop and the other one is for 32bit.
Go to the folder where Photoshop is installed and rename or delete the amtlib.dll file there, then just copy the correct file from the archive over (rename amtlib (2).dll to amtlib.dll if you're on 64bit).

This worked for me at least. """

,Siouxie19,2012-05-06T23:19Z,"Ok, works fine for me, and regarding the problem where it won't subscribe when u enter the serial, all u need is a different serial, one not listed on the torrent :)"
,enneagon,2012-05-25T09:57Z,"Serials provided here do not work for me. And replacing hosts file is somewhat brutal...

Fortunately everything is so easy u never need any download/torrent, I can provide complete institutions right here:
1) install Photoshop trial
2) locate your hosts file (default: C:WINDOWSsystem32driversetchosts ) backup it
3) open for editing in plain text (notepad) and append following code at the end of the file:

# Photoshop crack
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sea.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com

127.0.0.1 3dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns.adobe.com 
::1             localhost
# end Photoshop crack 

4) start photoshop and enter serial(s) (serials.ws until it don't ask anything else...

Done."

,CoreXi7,2012-05-30T04:22Z,"For all those who are stuck on the registration screen with error"" your subscription could not be activated, relaunch product"" etc...

Here is solution. There are two serial numbers.:
1. for CS5 extended subcription
2. For CS% extended (without subscription)

You will get error if you add ""subscription"" serial number. 

So use this serial no. ""1330-1363-1206-9398-1328-8912"" and activate photoshop cs5...

Enjoy!!!!
