McDonald and Giles is early King Crimson with all of the edges rounded and smoothed, a bright, optimistic vibe, and a safe, comfortable approach to experimentation. In other words it is early King Crimson minus Robert Fripp. A lovely album to be sure, but I prefer my "Prog-Rock" wrapped in barbed wire rather than candy floss
