Vendetta has spent most of the season kicking butt and taking names in the Tag Team League. She won the Championship in February and is now getting a couple regular season matches under her belt going into the Summer Vengeance tournament coming up in June. 

Krystal Main is the mid-western girl-next-door. After getting her ass kicked against Isis Love she is ready for her second match at Ultimate Surrender. Krystal is a fast learner and strong opponent. 

Vendetta gets a little warm up practice for the upcoming Summer Vengeance tournament. Krystal tries her hardest and gives her best but she is completely dominated by the Former Champion. Vendetta's power leg scissors cause Krystal to submit on the mat, and Vendetta's finger are in Krystal's pussy most of the match. A great Rd4 as Vendetta just fucks the shit out of "The Demon"
