Deadline LIVE with Jack Blood

2010-05-21 (Fri)
---------------- 

Jack is joined in the first hour by David Robertson. David's show 'An American Radio Warning' airs on the American Freedom Radio Network daily from 1-3pm CENTRAL right before Deadline LIVE. You can find info on him and his show at the following links:

In the second hour Jack had intended for supermario to come on the show to discuss his latest article 'Failed State â€“ Photo of kidnapped Mexican politician surfaces on the web' which you can find here posted at www.deadlinelive.info (http://deadlinelive.info/2010/05/21/photo-of-kidnapped-mexican-politician-surfaces-on-the-web/), but didn't. He covered news and discussed the article solo instead.

PLEASE NOTE - for some reason the American Freedom Radio stream is a bit choppy. Unfortunately I don't have a local affiliate. You should notice a few clicks and blips during the show. And for some reason on Friday's which they no longer post the podcasts of, it's extremely glitchy. I'm hoping they can clear this up since a majority of their listeners must be from the stream.
