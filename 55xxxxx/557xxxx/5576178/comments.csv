,LeetBurd,2011-06-07T01:22Z,Why .MKV?
,uthacalthing,2011-06-07T12:32Z,"Thanks houruoha, this has been on a local station lately, but I've already missed the first two eps, so this will let me catch up.

@LeetBurd - Why not MKV?  It's as good a container as AVI, MOV etc."

,junaidzia,2011-11-14T07:23Z,i always find the .mkv format because its the best to cop files into small size...without compromising the quality... thanks in advance.. hope it would be a good torrent..
