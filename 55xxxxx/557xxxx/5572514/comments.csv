All of the songs you included in your torrent are known songs and are either on the official releases or on singles (except for something called 'Castlevania' which I don't know what is), and none of them has a special note saying the song was recorded before 1979.

I'm not saying you're bull*****ing people here, I just want to know why you say this collection is from 1975 on."
