Spearhead. The first release from Nemesis : Children of the Fey (2010)

Four tracks of epic self-proclaimed BattleThrash written and recorded in SeanMandrake's front room, Manchester, UK.

This is metal for the masses. For anyone, for everyone, who is furious and angry with the world. For those black days when nothing but vengeance fills your heart.
