Thanks to Youngstown State University for this file.

Play derived from the King James Authorised Version's  'Book of Job'.

Job's KJAV text adapted to turn reported speech into direct speech,
and the plot tweaked to highlight Job's dilemma, the play does full
justice to Tyndale's sonorous tone. Lovely stuff.

Paul Scofield plays Job.
