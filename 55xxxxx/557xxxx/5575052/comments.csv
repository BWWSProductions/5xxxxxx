,dizzienoo,2010-06-16T14:38Z,"@godtepose Its because its a long track title, for some reason Itunes hates them and refuses to even look at them, clip the track title and it will load in."
,Godtepose,2010-06-17T11:59Z,"No, it's not even possible to rename the file. It seems locked somehow. When I rightclick the other files, I get options like for instance ""Properties"", ""Copy"" and ""Cut"" but not on track 13. 

Other than that, great upload michelinman :)! Thanks!"
