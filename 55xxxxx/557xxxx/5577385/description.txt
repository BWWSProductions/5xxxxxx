       Since NASA has refused to allow the Dudesons to borrow the space  
        shuttle, the guys decide to build their own rocket and launch it
        where no man has gone before - Uranus! With Doug the Rocket Engineer
        by their side, the Dudes will endure everything from a run threw
        a wall of fire to an embarrassing (and disgusting) laxative chug,
        as they get closer to the big launch. Will the Dudesons be the
        first to go to the darkest corner of Uranus or first in line at
        the Emergency Room?
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
