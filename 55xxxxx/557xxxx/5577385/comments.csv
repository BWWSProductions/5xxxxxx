any idea as to why this is happening.  i have NEVER had this problem before with any time of movie file."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-05-27T12:18Z,"good job getting back to people.  i will never download another TvTeam torrent again.  it this really is a ""team"" then you guys suck and should get rid of that skull.  i make it a point to ALWAYS get back to people downloading from me."
