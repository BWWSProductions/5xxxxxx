Introduction:

So you wanna play guitar, huh? And why wouldnâ€™t you?
Because you may as well face it: In the music world, guitars set the standard
for cool (and weâ€™re not just being biased here). Since the 1950s, many of the
greatest showmen in rock â€™nâ€™ roll, blues, and country have played the guitar.
Think of Chuck Berry doing his one-legged hop across the stage (the â€œduck
walkâ€) while belting out â€œJohnny B. Goode,â€ Jimi Hendrix wailing on his
upside-down, right-handed (and sometimes flaming) Stratocaster, Bonnie
Raitt playing slide guitar, Garth Brooks with his acoustic guitar and flannel
shirts, B.B. Kingâ€™s authoritative bending and expressive vibrato on his guitar
â€œLucille,â€ or George Bensonâ€™s mellow jazz guitar stylings. (Even Elvis Presley,
whose guitar prowess may not have exceeded five chords, still used the
guitar effectively onstage as a prop.) The list goes on.
Playing electric guitar can put you out in front of a band, where youâ€™re free to
roam, sing, and make eye contact with your adoring fans. Playing acoustic
guitar can make you the star of the vacation campfire singalong. And playing
any kind of guitar can bring out the music in your soul and become a valued
lifetime hobby.
