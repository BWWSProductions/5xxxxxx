Huge V-Shaped UFO Emitted Beam On C-5 At Vandenberg AFB
	



In late December 1969, a USAF security man named "Steve" and several others watched an otherworldly 
aerial machine emit a greenish-blue beam on a C-5 at Vandenberg AFB. Steve has never talked to 
anyone about the experience until now in this exclusive Earthfiles report. Steve said the day 
after the encounter, he was ordered by a United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations 
(AFOSI) Colonel, â€œYou did not see anything!â€ See Steve's illustration at Earthfiles.com.
