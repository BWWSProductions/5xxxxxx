,lionjaqmurphy,2010-05-24T03:45Z,"also tried to install the previous version u have on here. install was fine, but the serial included or the one you gave in the comments don't work. have the keys been blacklisted or do you have another solution???"

,lionjaqmurphy,2010-05-25T05:28Z,"thanks for the new key, but i tried it on a new installation and it was invalid. not sure what's wrong. I've been trying to install on 32bit 7. i don't think that has anything to do with it, but if you have any other suggestions, please let me know. again, thanks."
