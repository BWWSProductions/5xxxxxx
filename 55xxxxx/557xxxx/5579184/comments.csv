,zorome,2010-05-22T07:31Z,"wth is THIS?

There is NO game called Super Mario 2009."
,zorome,2010-05-22T08:01Z,"After some research:
This is an OPEN SOURCE game, NOT related to Mario. Why is this here?

Its not that bad, though. You can download it directly from their page:
http://www.secretmaryo.org/"
,Anarith,2010-05-23T11:42Z,this is not the newest version anymore 1.9 is downloadable at the website
,dannbeau,2010-05-26T01:39Z,can't believe the number if seeders on this thing
,djME27,2010-05-27T10:17Z,"...and this is coming from a trusted uploder?  Ugh.  At least some info in your post to let us know what the hell this is, so we don't waste our time?  The fact that there is no virus inside keeps the ""trusted"" status useful still, I suppose... if not for quality."
,dannbeau,2010-06-07T13:41Z,why is this trash top seeded?
,schokoxx,2010-06-07T21:44Z,It's an awesome game for a netbook. :)
,Mork_Blasphemy,2010-06-13T18:54Z,"I see its hard to say THANK YOU FOR SHARING this days,even if you don't like it you should thank the time that thenoobish wasted bringing this to you that otherwise would never know existed!!"
,Mork_Blasphemy,2010-06-13T18:55Z,"DJme25,I don't see you uploading anything so we could trash your uploads man!!"
,real4xor,2010-06-20T14:30Z,"lol.

No, it`s not Mario, it`s Maryo. xD
This fair merchant is shipping freeware instead of pirated goods :P

I guess I`ll just download this game. :P Better than complaining the cracks of others haven`t arrived yet.

who knows, maybe I can patiently wait a whole day longer now."
,Betoriel,2010-07-01T21:10Z,"Bleh, cheap mario copy and not even very good at it.. It's great that it's open source and stuff, but atleast they could've made it something else than platant mario copy with sucky graphics.. Maybe try to change the game a bit.

Anyways, I hated it already after 5 minutes.."
,harddrivesixtynine,2010-07-09T19:30Z,Can\'t believe you actually believed this xD it sais Maryo too so.
