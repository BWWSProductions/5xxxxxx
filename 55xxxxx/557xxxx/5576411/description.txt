Alex talks with Charlie Veitch [hour 3, into beginning of hour 4], the man behind The Love Police blog. Veitch's videos have raised awareness of the authoritarian attitude of police and security guards in their dealings with the public in England.

Alex also welcomes to the show [hour 4] attorney and author Ellen Brown. Her latest book, Web of Debt, documents the Federal Reserve and "the money trust" and shows how this private cartel has usurped power to create money from the people themselves and how we the people can get it back. Brown is the author of several other books, including Forbidden Medicine, Nature's Pharmacy for Children: Drug Free Alternatives for More Than 160 Childhood Ailments.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
