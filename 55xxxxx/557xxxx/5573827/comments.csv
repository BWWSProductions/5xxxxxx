Weird or What:
We want to believe there is a reason for everything. That everything that happens in our world, no matter how bizarre, no matter how baffling, can be explained. But sometimes things happen that seem to defy logic. This documentary series tries to use science to explain weird events that happened around the world. 

Human Popsicle:
Possible Human Sacrifice in New Hampshire. A child is frozen solid and lives. Mysterious mountain lights. Ice Circles that can be seen from space. Weird or what?"
