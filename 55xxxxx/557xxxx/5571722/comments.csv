,RottenBrain,2010-05-19T13:26Z,Is this legit? Can anyone confirm?
,TiLLseed,2010-05-19T14:52Z,"Thanks! Really don't know why so many people insist on uploading crack-it-yourself DLC.

If nothing else, unencrypted data compresses better, so the pre-cracked DAZIPs are slightly smaller."
,kokonut1972,2010-05-19T16:15Z,"can anyone confirm that this works....

i have the danger boy version but not sure if i want to run the decrypting script.....would prefer an unlocked dlc..."
,matelian,2010-05-19T16:59Z,come on ppl does it work or we need another cracked version
,illiria,2010-05-19T17:33Z,"Can't you look at my other torrents? I've already uploaded pre-cracked Ostagar and comments confirm that it works. I've also uploaded other cracks. While you people are questioning whether it is legit or not others play. Yes, it's legit. I've tested only on my computer though, so I answer for myself."
,Mar86,2010-05-19T19:57Z,"illiria: some ppl are just stupid, but thx nonetheless for ur effort and time!"
,Tiucaner,2010-05-19T21:23Z,"Tsx for the share, but the new items that you get from this are missing, could u upload them 2?"
,Metalprofi,2010-05-19T22:02Z,"@illiria
illiria is the ancient place that Albanians used to have :)"
,silentpsycho,2010-05-19T22:19Z,It works. Thanks for upload.
,Metalprofi,2010-05-19T22:46Z,"when i enter the game, all my downloadable contents are there (wardens keep, etc), and only darkspwan chronickles says ""missing requirements""..i updated patch 1.03.. still doesn work, any suggestions?"
,Hellgaze,2010-05-19T23:58Z,"When im using the DA updater to install it, when its jsut about done it says error, what stupid thing have I missed that is making this not work for me lol."
,JackMack10,2010-05-20T00:04Z,I wanted to say thanks i tried danger boy s version but it sayd it couldn t load the module and i installed yours and it works thank you !
,illiria,2010-05-20T03:21Z,"Not sure why it works for some and doesn't work for others. I'm not there to see the problem, so I can't do much about it. Sorry. But I have to agree with Mar86, - if it works for some people and not for others, that usually points that the problem is on your end.

Mind that the game, with all its mod and DLC support, is fairly easy to get corrupted. You might wanna try to reinstall it."
,MasonDunne,2010-05-20T03:57Z,"I tried to install this on my desktop and before reaching the end, it said error. So I reinstalled the whole game from scratch and updated it, and now ever single DLC I try to install including this and the other one for this on here also get error. 

So, I tried to install on my laptop, I get an error. I reinstall the whole game, every single DLC that worked perfectly before now says error before completing. 

This is odd, since it didn't just happen once, or twice, but four seperate times! Twice on my desktop and twice on my laptop. On both old installs and reinstalls. And now non of the DLC is making it past the install and ends on a error. So all my save games can't be used till I can install the DLC fully again."
,MasonDunne,2010-05-20T04:17Z,"Ok, painstakingly went and installed each and every DLC one at time, after removing everything DLC related in the Bioware documents folder, making sure it installed before moving on to the next. Finally got to this one and after nearly a day of error after error, it finally says installed."
,houseofswing,2010-05-20T06:00Z,worked for me thx
,AwayToHit,2010-05-20T09:01Z,It works like a charm with the Steam version od DA:O (it's funny to have some hacked dlc in a legit version of the game)
,dANGER_boy,2010-05-20T10:27Z,"@illiria:

Just wondering...you know the process to decrypt the DLC?  I'm done creating new torrents for some time so if any new DLC comes out, looks like you're going to be the one helping these kids out."
,Vault_Boy,2010-05-20T11:54Z,"This DLC appears to be incomplete, just as the non-cracked version that's uploaded here. The missing files are DAO_PRC_DRK_DAO_1.0 and DAO_PRC_DRK_EP1_1.0 which contain the Blightblood bonus item for DAO and Awakening and need to be decrypted also."
,illiria,2010-05-20T14:08Z,"@ dANGER_boy

No, I do not know the process of decrypting the DLC, all I do is pre-patch it, and pack again. I actually do that for myself, but since I did it anyway, I've decided to upload.

Might try to learn it, but I'm not sure I have the skill for it. I'm not a programmer. If you'd look at my torrents, you'd notice that all of my cracks and patches are based on someone else's, all I do is automize and simplify the process. Finish the job, so to say, for easier use."
,Twillidan,2010-05-20T16:48Z,if you get the error when you try to instal try puting the back up of the addins-xml file (if you wher smart enuf to make one xD) in the MyDocuments\BioWare\Dragon Age\Settings folder then try to instal the dlc again worked for me (soz for my bad english plz have som pations whit me i did make this acc just so i culd tell you ppl this GL)
,Twillidan,2010-05-20T16:50Z,"ooooh and dont forget to chance the comand lines in the addins.xml  so it sas ""RequiresAuthorization=""0"">"
,Twillidan,2010-05-20T16:52Z,ok soz for tripel posing but for got to give creds to dANGER_boy its cus of him i thot of trying this after reading the descripton from his torrent ty and you to illiria 
,dddokter,2010-05-20T20:13Z,"Thanks for the great upload,
had some problems with otehr upload but this one worked fine"
,dANGER_boy,2010-05-20T22:26Z,"@illiria

I would reccomend deleting this torrent.  Vault_Boy was kind enough to point out on the torrent I uploaded that there were at least 2 missing DAZIPS, one for the original game and one for the expansion that enable the Blightblood sword.  After looking at this, I also saw that an Offer DAZIP was missing as well.  This was my fault.  I forgot to check for other necessary DAZIPs.  Thus, both our torrents were incomplete."
,kokonut1972,2010-05-21T03:00Z,"Again to Danger boy, why do you keep insisting on releasing an encrypted dlc if you can decrypt it and put it here as decrypted...it does not make sense.

I know that the mass effect 2 dlc's are encrypted but i have never seen any encryption on the dragon age dlc's so far...i know how to edit the adins xml file and it is not that big of a deal...that is how you unlocked them....

but still i appreciate your work....especially the mass effect ones...

i downloaded the files directly from the ea site as someone went as far as to post the link to the download of the file for the dlc because their dragon age program would not download it. they even posted the links to the blightswords but not the special offer....

I wonder if those one are encrypted or not...and if it is not then...well...what you're doing is odd..."
,TomSnaps,2010-05-28T03:11Z,"Listen you nigger, 
This shit isn't working, crack fail. You have wasted 353.39 MB of my bandwidth you fucking piece of shit! "
,hootieman,2010-06-29T06:34Z,"This made my Dragon Age Origins crash, now I have to reinstall everything... thanks"
,jaysie21,2010-07-31T19:08Z,"THANKS for uploading this i save 400pts 
It's working alright i hope no AV alert will
pop out :)"
,hatsand,2010-10-03T06:27Z,"whenever i try to download these with the daupdater i get an error with the first three files, but the last one installs, which doesnt help at all. anyone know a fix for this?"
