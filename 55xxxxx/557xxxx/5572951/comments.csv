now i know some of you will say well gird... problem with grid its a ghoust town online. thats not the case with this game.. (guess for it being new & all)  but this racer has a twist. you can triger set like objects to wreck your fellow gamers ;-) witch is quite fun to do.  cont to next post..."

now with that out the way. i must say that yes there are hacks being used online for this game.
one would think well thats killing this game.. wrong for thos who come accross hackers it really doesnt matter. cus most of the ppl that use em suck & also you have tunngle witch you can black ppl you catch with witch from entering your lan games.  cont to next post.."

even with the noob hackers (witch if you know your tracks good enough you can still beat them noobs) the game is fun as hell to play. this is a must dl..

as far as ppl saying it sucks or the gfx is not as good as grid & so on.. pay em no mind & give this a try. its well worth it.. very good job on the torrent. hell i might even buy this game to support the game makers..

on a side note i hate disney.. from the cartoons to w/e else that thay make.. but for this game its got too be the 1st & prob gona be the only thing that has come from disney that i love/like."

@cheesedawg
Try to scroll trough the comments and find a tutorial for how to install a game. (it's almost the same for every downloaded game) Here some info that can help you out a bit (I hope ;)
You need to download daemon tools. This program makes your pc think that there is a cd inserted.
When you downloaded daemon tools, open it. Find the option 'mount image'. Then mount the iso file from the torrent. Install the game and use a cd key if there is one in the downloaded file. If not, copy the files from the torrent (the cracked files) into you're folder where you installed the game. (if it asks to replace it, click on 'yes) I hope this helped"

,murrambingi,2010-07-31T06:57Z,"DestAIB,
yes you can play online ingame, all you do is enter your username and then press tab to enter a password then enter, if it says no profile created bla bla ignore and continue, it worked for me.
Cheesedawg,
if mounting won't work then right click iso and extract files using WinRar then install the game then go to crack folder and right click and copy the rld dll file and the split second file with it and then go to your shortcut and right click then properties the open file location then paste it and copy and replace then create new shortcut to desktop and delete the existing one, you should now be able to play.
To everyone else,
i will be seeding between 2am-8am australian time at 94KB/s until it is seeded 150%, hope that helps you guys. :)"
,maggotrape,2010-08-01T01:35Z,Cheesedawg: You usually have to copy the games exe fiole over the installed version. Go to your programfilesx86 directory and then to the games directoy and copy over the exe file. If there are any others in the crack copy them accordingly. it should run fine afterwards.... a really simple process!

,skyman77,2010-08-25T22:58Z,"xander, have you copied BOTH files from crack folder ?
.exe AND .dll  ?
As you say this happened on other games, i'd suspect  it's something with windows instalation (64bit, DXdrivers, below min sys spec...could be MANNY things, hard to tell ;) try turning OFF your resident antivirus while applying crack, maybe you get false positive, and cracked files go auotomatically to quarantine...
Good luck!"
