The Truth Will set you free, however It may cause you to get real pissed off and kick the couch or the cat.

Chuck Missler  --  The Rapture  --  God Is still batting 1000 on Prophesy. More amazing than that is that He has stood up to the Plate of Prophesy over 2000 times, everyone fulfilled as written. There are around 500 prophesies YET to be fulfilled in The Holy Scriptures. WHAT DO YOU THINK??? Will Yahweh make any mistakes on the next 500. I am betting on the PERFECT Record of The Creator. Even 2 digit IQ's should be able to grasp that one. Get ready, The Rapture can happen at any second. All prophesy has been fulfilled for the Rapture to take place.

The most preposterous event in Biblical Prophesy that is ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

Did we evolve from rocks to single cells,(a single cell is more complicated than an aircraft carrier)to lizards, snakes, fish, bugs, monkeys and other creatures? Do we die and we are then worth nothing more than dirt? Is that all there is? Or do I live on forever in a timeless eternity in multiple(11)dimensions. Do I want to live in a multi dimensional, timeless Universe? YES YES YES !!


The More You share the More shares you will receive, may Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
