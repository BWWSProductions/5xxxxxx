This is the CFA Level 1, 2, 3 Notes.

Specifically;

CFA Level One 2009 Notes by Kaplan Schweser

CFA Level Two 2007 Notes by Kaplan Schweser

CFA Level Three 2009 Notes by Kaplan Schweser


These are good quality scans in PDF format.


I like to have these bang up to date, but as anyone will attest, finding these ebooks is particularly difficult. They go out of date after 3 years, so finding recent notes is a big deal, especially for an exam as difficult as this, any edge is vital. (hence why you're on here downloading instead of paying hundreds of dollars)


If anyone has 2009 for Level 2, or the 2010 versions, let me know.
