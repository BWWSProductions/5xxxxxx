Though heavily indebted to earlier punk-pop acts, Taking Back Sunday manage to sound fresh on their debut album.  Lyrical nods to Brand New and other bands are sprinkled throughout.  The give and take from dual vocalists combines with catchy hooks and crunchy, ringing guitars to produce a fun if not terribly weighty album.
