Anne Strieber has a phenomenal discussion with one of the originators of remote viewing, Russell Targ. You will meet this amazing and important human being in a whole new way, in intimate conversation with somebody who knows just what questions to ask. A friend of people like Alan Alda, Ayn Rand, Alan Greenspan and the brother-in-law of chess champion Bobby Fisher, Targ has developed what he calls 'Five Keys to Liberation' that enable us to see beyond the limits of ordinary perception into a new world of meaning and joy.
