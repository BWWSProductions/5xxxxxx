,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:52Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
,T08-_-80T,2010-06-07T17:24Z,"You are a quite the visionary aren't you mrdirectorman.  Indeed it is real.  I know it could be done by the regular (non-3D) releases.  No need to go through the hassles of filming through multiple lenses and viewings and such.  You can also do this with 2 Recorders at one movie.

To make a long story short, here is a link...

I however will not be dabbling with this one as I am still feeling MY economic crunch.  Just letting you know.  I agree!   Enjoy"
,orihimekunn,2010-06-14T17:25Z,"Are there subtitles?? I know that they do not speak english most of the movie so if there are no subtitles, i do not want this torrent. On the file it says: Subtitle (0 stream)"
,orihimekunn,2010-06-14T17:32Z,Subtitles??
,orihimekunn,2010-06-14T17:59Z,"nvm! i watched it my my comp and there are subs, sorry for commenting twice, i thought the first hadden't worked. Question though: Did you write the subs or are they real?"
,T08-_-80T,2010-06-15T18:02Z,Hardcoded
,orihimekunn,2010-06-21T05:05Z,What does hardcoded mean?
,T08-_-80T,2010-06-21T11:16Z,They are the original subs
