,primalclaws1974,2010-05-22T10:52Z,"I remember this show from my teenager days. Was just reading about it by accident, and then thought I'd look it up. I guess I got good timing, as you just uploaded it! Thanks man."
[V],neon,2010-05-22T15:48Z,thanks for the comment primalclaws1974 its a pretty good tv series :)
,Enemy_Hero,2010-05-22T18:13Z,"hey man nice upload. lets hope u dont have the episode 9/10 duplicates, I've got this already i just need to replace ""beat the clock"". great series for the 90s, love the danny elfman score, very batman returns."
,Enemy_Hero,2010-05-22T19:18Z,"you've just re-upped the same one i downloaded that had more seeders. you didnt make this torrent and you clearly havent checked it to make sure it quality. heres a link to the actual ""beat the clock"" episode 11 that i found after extensive searching. im stuck at 99.7% atm tho, so dont get ur hopes up.

,Enemy_Hero,2010-05-23T04:48Z,"okay, i didnt bother waiting around to get 100% of episode 11 from the alternate source. the only person who's seeding is obviously waiting for the owner to come back and seed again. not gunna happen obviously. just download the file till 99.7% and uve got it. its the whole episode at 99.7 even with creds, nothing is missing from it. but the AVI index will be broken cos the file is incomplete. it still works tho. just google virtualdub and re-author the file as a complete AVI and ur all sweet."
[V],neon,2010-05-25T11:21Z,@ Enemy_Hero ...nowhere on this page says i put this torrent together...like you said i uploaded from another site cause this wasnt on pirate bay...thanks for the useful link :)
,rxdrxgx,2010-11-13T02:37Z,"Please, I can't not download the 11th episode, I need it to complete the series, i have searched all over the web, and I only found inactive torrents, please can anybody help me.
Please Enemy_Hero upload that episode.

Thank you."
