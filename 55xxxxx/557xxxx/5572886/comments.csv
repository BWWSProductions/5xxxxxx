,madtown4,2010-05-19T20:52Z,wow this one looks great. will wait to jump in .thank you. are you going to up the wolf man.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T21:44Z,"@madtown: After this one upped would be Book of Eli, 'cause I am just starting with encoding. Slight problem with Wolfie is that I have DVD, but it is very likely that BluRay would appear this week - and I prefer BR if I can get one. It is not so important, but if we can have gold, why to use silver. If I find that BR has uncertain release date, I would encode what I have - a DVD - but tomorrow. Now is late night here and I'll start encoding of Book of E. and hit the bed."

,maniaq77,2010-05-20T01:51Z,hey I noticed you've left Treme off your schedule - what happened?
,lover2040,2010-05-20T05:12Z,thanks for this one!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-20T06:57Z,"@maniaq77: Not at all - Treme never entered my Weekly schedule (listed TV shows by days of release). Treme only appeared in the schedule of specific day, when I - usually in first Description that day - practically announce which shows would be released that day.
Do not worry, all Treme eps have been encoded so far, as [quark], but I think that two episodes never appeared as torrents because in exact times TPB was down.
If you've missed some episode, download MU.txt file from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5572335/Law.and.Order.SVU.S11E24.H264[quark] - links are there."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-20T08:30Z,"@madtown: It was one of the few good calls, The.Wolfman .2010. UNRATED.Dir.Cut.BluRay has been released during the night. Only ""thingy"" keep bothering me - I do not have free upload slot till Friday or Saturday."
,D07792,2010-05-20T10:58Z,"@2040
i m already downloading Shutter.Island. If there r no request 4 quark, pls skip encoding it."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-20T14:41Z,"@madtown: Shit happens my friend. This 6.34 GB turned to be piece of crap, I couldn't believe that video has been falling apart. I went on one place and it is true - that copy of BluRay was NUKED all over the net and it was so early in the morning that silly haven't looked all around.
Well:
order  for ""nuking"" is issued
""video.glitches.and.freezes_e.g.00m56s.to.01m07s_01m34s.to01m44s""
and this time was absolutely a good decision.
It means that I have ""burned"" 6400 Megabytes for downloading piece of crap (LOL, name of the group is HUBRIS) and I have no desire to eat someone's shit twice. Sorry, I am in bad mood now...
Shortly, there will be no BRrip of Wolfman, but I upped [quark] from DVD and - that's all I plan to do. Sorry, no better Wolfie, never ever..."
,maniaq77,2010-05-21T07:03Z,nice...
