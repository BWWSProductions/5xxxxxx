@RitchieRich: Thanks! Installing asap."
,jordfot,2010-05-26T00:35Z,has anyone tested the torrent? 
,sadkins76,2010-06-03T02:55Z,"This torrent is 100% genuine.  It WILL NOT work on a Windows version of iTunes!  You MUST use an OSX iTunes.  You can do this through a VMware machine.  Make sure you backup your iPhone first on your Windows computer.  You MUST be activated with your UDID with a dev account before you attempt.  Then, run the updated software on your OSX VM.  Once complete, restore your data on your Windows computer from backup.  Almost all my apps worked fine, other than my banking app, but that was still in BETA on the 3.1.3.  Folders are great!  Enjoy"
