Do any of you encounter this kind of problem? If yes, how did you fix it?

By the way, my specs are:
Windows 7 Home Premium 2.13GHZ i3
4gb RAM DDR3
500 HDD
1GB dedicated video

Please help! I would really appreciate it. Thanks."
,Leviathan_Baphomet,2010-06-18T17:25Z,Well I've played it for more than 30 mins on multiple different computers and i know other people that have too and nobody has mentioned any such issues to me so far. Do you ever have problems with any other games? Maybe update graphics card drivers to very latest WHQL version and make sure direct x is at latest revision too. Apart from that i have no idea sorry :(
