,russell1nash,2010-05-23T21:41Z,big thanx!
,celaeno1970,2010-05-24T00:23Z,Thank you... but I don't hear a defect on the original Track 8... I looked over your log and it's A-OK unless it was tampered with...
[T],miona45,2010-05-26T03:14Z,"well, i heard the weird thing when i played back track 8.  i hadn't burned it to a disc though to listen back... so maybe it corrects itself with a cue sheet. i left the log as it was and didn't alter it...so it was just really strange.    i did try and rip a different cd and got some strange errors.  so i wondered if my burner was biting the dust and causing bad reads.  i changed it out and didn't get the weird errors on the second disc. but i didn't try to rip the Stones disc again.  so maybe it was my drive going bad.  i've only used it for 8 months but i do a lot of ripping and burning."

I am not sure what you heard, but it may be speaker-related, or some other system glitch. Matching CRCs *always* mean a perfect rip, as long as the other settings are as you have them in EAC. ;-)

Thank you for this rip."

celaeno1970 

well, i don't know. the whole thing with the log etc was weird. that's all i can say. i am just trying to make the rip right....so, if you don't hear anything that is amiss, that's great.  i just didn't want to chance uploading a 'defective' rip.
lol..who knows.  

i welcome any comments about this."
