The patched program has only two bytes different grom the original exe, and Setup has been downloaded from the original site. Looks like Antivir isn't so reliable... :o)"

This is the result of VirusTotal scan of the patched file. Even Antivir says that it's clean. And the Setup comes from the original site, so I'm expecting it should be clean."
[V],NoExcuses,2010-05-20T16:13Z,"Well, scanning Setup with VirusTotal it shows up four detections, all from minor AVs. Here is the VT report:

BTW, Antivir again says nothing about it..."

It can depend from many things, apart that it's normal that passing through a proxy your speed slows down. You have to choose also a good fake location, as not all of them have the same speed. You use a program like this to reach something that you can't access in the normal way, and slow is better than no access. For normal usage on non-blocked sites it's better to deactivate the program..."
