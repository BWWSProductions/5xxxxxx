,JuggaloStr3tch,2010-06-10T09:05Z,WOW 500kb/s for having just 8 seeders? excellent speed! Good quality and good sound. Excellent upload
,Cinj,2010-06-30T09:36Z,"Man, this was such a fucking awesome show. I'm glad I downloaded it. I would love to help seed it, but I can only push 10k/sec at best. Bad news for anyone stuck with me as the sole seeder.

I urge anyone with a good upload bandwidth to help seed this torrent. Good quality torrents like this shouldn't be allowed to wither and die.

Fuck it, I'll help seed it anyway once I figure out how to put it back into uTorrent (I kinda moved the files and renamed some directories and shit)."
,Cinj,2010-06-30T10:12Z,"Nvm, I just copied the files into my torrent folder and renamed the dirs back into their original names resulting in taking up an extra 4.9 gigs of my HD, but it's worth it to share this awesome show with as many people as possible.

I will seed this for as long as this torrent remains viable.

I suggest to everyone (who don't already know) that you goto filesharefreak.com and look up the article ""How to speed up torrents with low seeders"" and use that information well. The amount of seeders/leechers this page is showing (5/4 as I'm writing), is unequal to the real amount of S/L (49/32) out there. So use more trackers and turn on Peer Exchange and DHT and help keep this torrent going for as long as possible. Thank you.

This all coming from a guy that isn't fond of seeding, btw. I just love Black Lagoon."
,Cinj,2010-06-30T10:31Z,"Sorry to spam this page, but I forgot to mention: 
The quality of this torrent is awesome. I'm running it full screen on an HD monitor at 1600x900 resolution and there no noticeable artifacts or any sort of perceivable graphic problems inherent to the video itself. Audio quality is great despite that I'm using the lame speakers built into my monitor. I've watched all 24 episodes in their entirety and I have not witnessed any sort of fuckup whatsoever.

It's rare to see a torrent that is quality through and through, from the description all the way to the content itself. Whoever posted this is awesome, whoever ripped/encoded this is awesome (if not the same guy). It's rare that I stand behind something so zealously, but I believe we need more people posting and seeding quality torrents and if my words offer any encouragement towards that goal, then it will have been worth it (even at the risk of me sounding like a jackass)."
