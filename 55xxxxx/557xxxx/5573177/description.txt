This weekend the Raid Warning boys were joined by some of the biggest names in the Paladin community to discuss the class that loves to heal in a dress! From class mechanics, ICC tips and tricks, Flash of Light vs Holy Light, to the future of the Cataclysm Paladin, we did our best to cover every aspect of the class.
