The first live-action feature based on the manga Death Note covers much of the same material as the first 12 episodes of the animated series. Handsome Light Yagami has just passed the bar exam, but he's repelled by the injustice of modern society. His life changes dramatically when he finds a Death Note, a notebook dropped into human space by Ryuk, a Shinigami (god of death). If anyone writes the name of a human in the book, that person will die within 40 seconds. Under the pseudonym "Kira," Light launches a gradiose vigilante campaign to rid the world of criminals and create his vision of a perfect society.

The second live-action feature based on the manga Death Note by Tsugumi Ooba and Takeshi Obata, picks up exactly where the first film ended. After the death of the woman who had deduced his identity as the murderous Kira, Light Yagami plots to continue his vigilante campaign to rid the world of criminals using the magical Death Note. But his growing megalomania collides with the counter-schemes of phlegmatic super-detective L.
