,Gethyper,2010-05-20T20:06Z,The story sucks ass....but will download this to see the Special Effects in HD.....thanks for the upload mate
,JPeterson,2010-05-20T21:08Z,Why did they include Mandarin? I don't want that. Isn't there a scene rule against that?
[V],-jonny-,2010-05-21T01:30Z,"It's not a scene release. You can just ignore the existence of the extra audio track, or remove it quickly and easily."
,Ibuxx,2010-08-06T17:45Z,FFS. not even 720p
,GravityOne,2010-09-09T00:47Z,"No, its upscaled and looks like crap is what he means.  And hes right... its really grainy."
,kdallas2010,2010-09-13T14:29Z,"The grain is a little distracting at first, until you realise that Spielberg did it intentionally...

,ro4eva,2010-10-05T18:08Z,The video is not upscaled.
,rmalak,2010-12-20T18:29Z,I downloaded this specifically because it said that it had DTS-HD Master Audio. It doesn't!! Good copy and still has regular DTS audio but a little disappointing.
,bjr2293,2011-01-28T17:45Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT - IT IS BEING TRACKED BY PARAMOUNT. RECEIVED A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER THROUGH MY ISP TODAY. 
,dcutler,2011-02-28T07:28Z,agree with gethyper
,crimson85067,2011-05-18T14:52Z,bjr2293  use 'hide my ip' noobie
,crimson85067,2011-05-18T23:58Z,"It not quite 720p but its a good copy, I found a true 720p copy on here but it was dubbed in Russian :(

Still its a good quality but not 720p"
,H4LFB4CKS,2011-07-17T12:27Z,"WARNING! NOT 720p! WARNING!
Do not download this unless you do not want shitty grainy quality like the 80's vhs quality.
I wasted 24 hours downloading this SHIT to discover it."
,bonar123,2011-07-26T05:59Z,"""grain"" isa film element you moron.  It's eithe rin the film or added as a post production effect to make it look ""gritty"".   Compression doesn't add grain and neither does downscaling.

Blocking or banding?  Sure.  But grain? NO.

along with this ""true 720p"" nonsense.  Black bars are black bars.   You either waste bandwidth on themor you don't.  There's no anamorphic blu-rays, so for disc there's no way around it.  But these are rips.  Stop being a retard."
,natedog2,2011-08-14T06:20Z,"V 10 
A 1

this track with out a doubt has the worst audio quality i have ever heard in a divx format and should be avoided entirely unless you are highly skilled at fixing this kind of thing, and because of the huge size this copy should be avoided."
,ChipLife,2011-10-26T04:53Z,"This is a terrible torrent, avoid at all costs. Most 2GB 720p movies look and sound perfect. This is an 8GB movie and all you get is an upscaled-looking, EXTREMELY blocky, poorly compressed, unwatchable mess.

But yes, 1280x694 is 720p to the idiots who don't know what they're talking about."
