,tripmix,2010-05-21T23:07Z,"There should be a filter that auto permabans users and their entire ip range for posting spam like the above user, just add the main part of the url to the filter and keep adding them as they change the name. All the innocent that will be affected have to kill said user for the ban to be lifted."
