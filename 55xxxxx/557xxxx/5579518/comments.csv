,Da_ud001,2010-06-04T18:48Z,"Hi buddy,

First of all i must say, good job,

second, when can we expect to see seasons 7-10

Thanks"
[V],meech,2010-06-05T04:11Z,"Season 7 was posted a couple days ago: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5603441/Stargate.SG-1.Season.7.x264.ac3.subs-HighQuality  Not sure why, but it doesn't seem to be coming up in the search engine.

Expect season 8 next week.  Seasons 9 and 10 won't be far along after that.  Glad you are enjoying."
,CakeMonster,2010-11-01T20:09Z,"Mr meech if you could please upload season 2 of atlantis with commentaries it would make my day

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of â€œgood qualityâ€ of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:31Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys
