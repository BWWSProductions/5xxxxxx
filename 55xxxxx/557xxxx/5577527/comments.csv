,rizzon,2010-05-21T14:13Z,lots of people stuck at 84.6%. Seeder or another torrent is needed
[T],CHD242522,2010-05-21T15:43Z,"@ rizzon, I upload to a ratio of 2.0. Then I let the swarm build so people with faster connections don't hit and run and everyone can get enough pieces. If it ends up still being stuck, I'll seed until the problems solved. With my torrents you'll never see a non seeded/dead torrent. If you want faster uploads and downloads I recommend a good private tracker. "
,rizzon,2010-05-21T16:33Z,"@ Uploader, you might want to seed some more, the swarm never caught on. Get a few more to 100% ad I'm sure it will solve itself."
[T],CHD242522,2010-05-21T18:08Z,"@ rizzon, thank you for your comments, as I rely on feedback to let me know when a swarm is stuck. I will usually seed to 2.0, go to sleep for 8 hours and check on the swarms. This gives enough time for people with slower connections to get enough pieces that the swarm doesn't die due to hit and runners. Once again, thank you for your feedback and tonight I will seed to 3.0 before I let the swarm build just to make sure enough copies make it in. 2.0 used to be a sweet spot but now only seems it has a success rate on 50% of torrents I up."
,rizzon,2010-05-21T23:57Z,Someone must have managed to import seeders from another tracker because suddenly there were hundreds of them.
