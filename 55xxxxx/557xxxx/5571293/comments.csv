,Cathartik,2011-05-10T22:06Z,"Next time you upload, please just upload either the iso or the rar files. Not both. Thanks!"
,siadioni,2011-05-11T11:09Z,The BlackMirror.exe is infected by a Trojan virus :( Is anything we can do about it?
,siadioni,2011-05-11T11:48Z,"Ok..I found a solution!
When you install the game, your virus program will detect the BlackMirror2.exe as a virus(too bad it is infected but we don't need it anyway!you are supposed to replace it with the crack file ). Click on ""skip this file"". So, when the game is installed, go to the skidrow folder given by the SUPER uploader (Thank you for this amazing game!:P) and copy the 2 files to the suitable folder of the game. You are ready to play! ;) And your pc will be safe :P "
