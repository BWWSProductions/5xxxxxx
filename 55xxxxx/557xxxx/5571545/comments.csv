dimitrifavaro is just the name of the guy who made the upload were i got that app.. it works perfectly so i encourage you to use it... if you don't feel like trusting it content you are free to scan it with kaspersky ;)"
,chill06,2010-05-20T21:24Z,works... ty for upload!
,leekoonteng,2010-05-23T10:30Z,the file works great. just want to ask. every time i launch this program it will ask if i want to upgrade to version 5.5. can i upgrade? or i lose the license if i upgrade?

to update you need 1 email address from someone that had buy a pro version of it... if you don't have that email is imposible to update ;) so you aint losing any licence"
,leekoonteng,2010-05-24T20:55Z,oh.. ok cool. thanks for the info bro. looks like i'll just have to stick with this version then.
