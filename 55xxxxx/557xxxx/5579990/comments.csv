,bigjetcjss,2010-05-22T06:46Z,Thanks Lots! Yo peps if everyone adds bandwidth to the upload it'll increase our average bandwidth. I have my upload and download set to Unlimited. If you can do the same just for now at least. It shouldn't effect your download speed in a bad way. I believe it will only help you out in the long run.
