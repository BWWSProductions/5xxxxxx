,darin_god,2010-05-31T10:39Z,"I got Currupt data.


But I'm sure it's not the movie, just something happened during the download.

Kingdoms always the best, plus positive comments.

I'm downloading a fresh copy again. I trust it'll work.

Thanks for this up, I wanted to watch this, and there's no better than Brrip kingdom-releases.

,darin_god,2010-06-15T11:39Z,"I downloaded this shit three times, and all three, corrupt data.

I'm not saying originally it was bad, but over time, part of it might have gotten lost.

it's just not going to work for me.

damn..........."

,loser_monster,2010-11-12T22:05Z,I didn't notice the high-res aspect of this when I downloaded it. Much to my surprise it came up as an absolutely amazing crystal clear picture. Awesome movie made even better by the perfect resolution
,v.y.,2010-12-20T19:21Z,thx.
,Ogre_25,2010-12-24T05:26Z,"Great quality. Thank you for the rip.

If anyone is looking for the uncut version with the famous ""curby"", this is NOT it."
,Ogre_25,2010-12-24T23:53Z,"ooops!! My mistake. This does have the curby. I thought it was at the beginning but, it's at the middle.

Sorry to the uploader."
,Pimbax,2011-02-19T14:09Z,"Great movie and quality.

,Wave_rider,2011-11-24T01:49Z,"@ einstein. You obviously are no Einstein. Copy and paste the links for the screenshots and they work perfectly. 

Didn't your daddy ever tell you to think before you speak. Dumb ass."
