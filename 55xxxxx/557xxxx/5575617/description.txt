    In the 18th century the Royal Navy was the most            
    successful fighting force in the world. To maintain       
    this status it desperately needed better ways of         
    looking after its sick and wounded, so in 1746 it         
    decided to build the best hospital the country had ever    
    seen, near the Portsmouth dockyard at Haslar. Costing     
    100,000, it was the biggest construction project in     
    the country, and for over 250 years Haslar treated        
    sailors from The Battle of Trafalgar to the Gulf War,      
    until in 2009 the hospital closed its doors on the sick   
    for the last time. Between 1757 and 1826, thousands of   
    seamen and marines of the Royal Navy are believed to      
    have been buried in a Navy-designed cemetery in a field    
    beside the hospital. Exactly how and where they were      
    buried is not known and, as part of the closure          
    programme, the cemetery has to be excavated, to find      
    out where the burials are and how many there might be.     
    Time Team followed the archaeologists as they uncovered   
    multiple burials and carefully analysed the remains,     
    providing extraordinary insight into what life was like   
    in the Georgian Navy. There were no headstones and no      
    records, but painstaking research built a picture of      
    how and why the men ended up anonymously buried at       
    Nelson's hospital.
