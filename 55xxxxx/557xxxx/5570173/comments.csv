Plus your irritating name on the end of everything, and sometimes trying to take credit for actual rip.

You used to seem OK, but you're a complete prick now. And an utter hypocrite. You upload for no reason other than to get your name seen."

,-Cortex-,2010-11-06T19:43Z,"@TaZeRz 

Your post is so ironic, the 'black bars' are there to begin with, the encoder (who is from a scene group and knows more about video encoding than you ever will) cropped them so the image only consists of moving frames.

Don't believe me?

1) Go to IMDB and find the aspect ratio of the movie, which it lists as 2.35:1
2) Get a calculator and type 1280/2.35, which equals 544.

Well lookey that, it's the same as the vertical resolution for this film. I hope you feel like a complete tit right now."

,Junky099,2011-02-11T21:50Z,"jonny, why are you so negative all the time? I mean, this is beautiful, that we can get all those great movies in BluRay, without having to pay, and we owe it mostly to you. And if people don't like it, then you shouldn't tell them that they're on crack, because they obviously had a reason for saying it.

And SecretMyth is not shite, it's just really stupid that you said that, you've probably never even seen his rip. He DOES have awesome quality BRRips, and that's a fact. It's really great that you can download a 2GB movie with nearly the same quality as a 6.6GB BluRay equivalent. Those rips without a doubt statisfy everybody's quality standards, because the comments I've seen were all positive.

People are complaining because this upload is probably less perfect than the usual. The problem is that people can get used to EVERYTHING, even the best of the best, and then they ungratefully complain when they didn't get it, even though they're supposed to be happy that they're getting anything at all. It's even wrong to say that they're getting ""anything at all"", because they're getting much more than ""anything at all"".

One advice people, if you're watching BluRays on a computer, it can be out of sync because some computers have problems with playing movies with large sizes. I had problems when watching Toy Story 3 with 8.8GB size. I recommend always watching movies on an (HD)TV, they can handle everything, they're made for that purpose (Toy Story 3 was perfect on it :))

I don't think I'll download from you anymore, you sound like you're a real asshole. I don't know why you are going through the effort of uploading so many BluRays, you don't seem to be happy about it, because all you notice are negative comments, and in your reply you always make sure that people know you don't give a shit about problems they're having with your movie."

,Blackinaction,2011-04-19T18:31Z,A/V 10/10 Thanks a lot. I'll seed to a 1:2 ratio as with all the files that I like. 
,Zeptinune,2011-05-06T23:20Z,"Jonny knows his shit. All you faggots can fuck off and try and do better if you don't like his rips. Maybe people don't like hearing you bitch.

You little fuckers, sitting on your couch with your thumbs up your asses.. people like jonny go to hells end to upload good quality movies for fuckers like you, fuck knows why they even bother. I don't know.

This movie is epic quality and it kicks ass. Fuck you if you aren't happy. If you have a problem come see me in person and I'll sort your shit out for you.

Thanks the uploader. This movie isn't really worth a 1080p rip. The visuals aren't 'amazing' enough. A 720p is fine with me.

Thanks for the rip and high bitrate anyway. I feel sorry for fuckers on single cored piles of crap that cant decode anything over 240p lol.

Greetz."
,rlhq23,2011-05-25T23:46Z,"In response to Jonny being so negative all the time...

  Imagine you are normal person, living in a community. You take it upon yourself to clean the streets and sidewalks, despite having a busy life of your own. You don't do it to get paid and don't expect anything in return.You just do it because you like to help other people. However, the second someone sees a piece of trash blowing, they chastise you for not doing a duty you volunteered for out of the goodness of your heart. Instead of stepping up to the plate and helping, the other people just criticize you for not giving them enough FREE stuff. All they want to do is take and take, giving nothing back. After a while, would you grow slightly bitter as well?

    To Jonny,
   Thank you for doing all the work you do so we don't have to."
,Junky099,2011-06-18T21:38Z,"I don't know if anyone should let himself become that much bitter. I mean look at his previous posts.

But you're right, I agree that we should be grateful that he's doing all of this for free. Although, I think most of the time he's just the uploader (not the encoder)."

Very good picture and sound quality. For those who still didn't manage to play the movie, just go and download VLC Player, will solve your problems for sure. And make sure you have it set right to get the right sound (right click on the movie - Audio - Audio Device -  Stereo (probably))."
