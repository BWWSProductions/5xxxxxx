Isaac Hayes' second studio album.

The album begins with a cover of the Burt Bacharach and Hal David classic, "Walk On By." Second was "Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic", an uptempo funk song with wah-wah guitar and rolling pianos. "One Woman", at just over five minutes the shortest track on the album, focuses on the pangs of infidelity. An extended reinterpretation of Jimmy Webb's country music composition "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" closes the album. After an eight-minute spoken introduction, the song slowly builds to a climax of horns, strings, organs and vocals.
