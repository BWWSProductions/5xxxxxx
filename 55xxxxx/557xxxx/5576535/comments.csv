,souls2deny,2010-05-21T04:11Z,"PT, Just wanted to say thanks for stepping up in holyroses's absence. It is much appreciated! HR's handheld encoding is second to none and its good to see you keeping up with the new releases and same encoding methods while HR is away.

Keep up the hard work and once again thank you!"
