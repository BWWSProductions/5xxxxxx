    Nun of That is an action-comedy that follows Sister Kelly Wrath as       
    she transforms from a nun with a simple temper problem to a vengeful     
    killer. After being gunned down in an alley, she ascends to heaven to    
    receive training from some of the great figures of religious             
    mythology (Moses, Gandhi, and Jesus himself). She is then set back to    
    Earth to join the other members of the Order of the Black Habit, a       
    group of supernatural vigilante nuns as they seek revenge against the    
    mob.
