With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, 
billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from the government, 
the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let
go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and James 
Rhodey" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, must forge new alliances -- and confront
powerful enemies. 
                                                                    
Plot Synopsis:

Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has used 
his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super
powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only
furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by opening the "Stark Expo", to 
showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Stark is, however, 
still vilified by the United States government, and Senator Stern (Gary Shandling) 
in particular, who demands that he hand his armor technology over for military 
application. Stark refuses, publicly shaming rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) 
in the process by highlighting his own failed attempts at recreating the technology.
All is not well in Stark's life, however: he has discovered that the palladium 
in the arc reactor keeping his heart beating has begun to poison his body, slowly 
killing him, and all attempts to find a substitute element have failed. Slowly 
going off the rails as a consequence of what he believes to be his impending death,
he appoints his former personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) CEO of
Stark Industries, replacing her with Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson).
