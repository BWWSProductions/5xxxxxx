When you're trying to watch the movie the player doesn't find a Dolby Digital track and thus is silent. Try and change the audio to DTS instead."
,tunamgu,2010-05-23T15:00Z,"tried to change,but doesnt work.have you tried?"
,Janiqq,2010-05-25T21:02Z,"you dvd player is not supporting DTS sounds, so that's why it is silence :D you need home theatre system with digital amplifier :)"
