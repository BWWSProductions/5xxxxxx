,D0gmeat,2010-05-19T23:40Z,Thank you
,45ten,2010-05-29T18:52Z,"Hey Tanauser, is this the offical 1.6 patch or would-be RazorDOX 10?"
,45ten,2010-05-29T19:24Z,"Doesn't seem to work with the Razor1911 version. If I drop the files into the data folder it crashes on the first screen. I've tried adding the patch4.pack and patch5.pack to user.empire_script, still doesn't work.

Do I have to wait for RazorDOX 10?"
,45ten,2010-06-02T18:31Z,"Hey Tanauser,

Sorry for the false alarm, did a fresh reinstall + razordox8 update and then your patch5 update and its all working now. This is the official 1.6 patch that was just released recently right? 

Cheers :)"
[T],Tanauser,2010-06-02T22:46Z,Yes it is
,allangb,2010-06-05T12:31Z,If this is the 1.6 thank you so much! Some updated mods only work with 1.6...
,webtax,2010-06-09T17:00Z,"awsome

im just dl empire for the first time, so i just need empire razor 1911, update 8, and patch5?

no need to install update8 hotfix and update9?

thanks tanauser!"
[T],Tanauser,2010-06-10T11:24Z,Of course you need all the Updates before this one or it will crash
,Bircangelo,2010-06-12T19:43Z,"Tanauser i see you worked hard and long to do all this stuff for total war game for that i thank you but im kinda got noob with all the patch and pirate uploads you have and im kinda lost.No not kinda im really lost so if u can give me a hand here i would realy apreciate it.Thanx.

I just want to play empire tw with full playable content so if you can create a list for me on what to do each step (noobish style) it would be really helpful."
,Bircangelo,2010-06-12T21:14Z,"And when i said full playable content i meant : warpath , all special and downloadable units (like regiments or something) and so on and so on.Also do you know if there will be more patches and dlcs released?Thank you again."
,Bircangelo,2010-06-12T21:18Z,"Ah dammit i forget sorry about the spam 

I downloaded and installed only razor 1911 special forces edition and didnt do any crack."
[T],Mincan,2010-06-17T22:47Z,"The menu still says version 1.5... but it didn't crash, does this mean it has indeed updated to 1.6, or does this patch not have that ability to change the menu?"
[T],Tanauser,2010-06-18T00:25Z,"It's the real patch5 recognized by the AI ;

The cracked .exe will Unlock all original DLC anyhow  ; 

but the cracked Warpath mostly works upon vanilla if you place the main folders the way I have describe 
"
,newmanium7,2010-06-23T07:57Z,"Thanks Tanauser this is great!

I noticed a small bug that I thought you should know about-- whenever you try to fight a battle in which the Hessian Grenadiers (Great Britain unit) are present, the game freezes or crashes while loading. I experimented with many combinations of units until I narrowed it down to this one causing a crash. "
[T],Tanauser,2010-06-25T22:05Z,I just checked ; it's working with me
,cpt_acid,2010-06-28T14:10Z,"Thank you, Tanauser, you're the Man!

the .exe unlocks all the real DLCs?
What does that mean?
Does that mean I can rename your custom_unitsXX in your 44dlc4free.pack to their original names and they would work?
(I'm asking because mod compatibility issues)."
,cpt_acid,2010-06-28T14:47Z,"No, wait!

All DLC additional units work with no additional packs!

That means 44DLC4free.pack is... obsolete? :)

That is great, my friend. Thanx again."
,elect_86,2010-10-24T21:36Z,"There is a problem, the update9 of Razordox doenst work.

Is it anyway possible to install this one with only the update 8 and the hotfix?"
,imgonnadie,2011-01-18T06:59Z,"I got everything to work except the last step.

How do I get warpaths to work?

I copied the natives folder to the main installation directory..."
,0-LSD-0,2011-01-20T22:34Z,I've been getting about 15kb/s for a while now. Any chance i could ask for a seed? Cheers.
,Syteri,2011-01-31T20:49Z,Vanilla as in... No patches or whatsoever?
,bildast,2011-03-05T02:42Z,hi everone. is someone kind enough to tell us what other patches are needed to get Razors relese to 1.6 prior to this one. Thanks.
,bildast,2011-03-05T04:17Z,"its ok, i found a torrent that contains all of them, thank you"
