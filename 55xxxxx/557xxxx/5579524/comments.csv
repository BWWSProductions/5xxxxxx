Think logically. The server population on alter isn't huge. It's significant, but a lot more people use the actual game. By ""stomping them out"" as you say, it will alienate a large population of potential buyers. And why the hell would they sue, when like other companies, they can just patch cracks etc.? Or release some really nice DLC that us alter users (I own the full game) can't implement?

Do you really know anything? Have you graduated high school?

Are you *gasp* a ""dofus""?"

,Tyronian,2010-06-28T02:34Z,"@DofusOctopus

If you had any common sense, you would maybe use your brain and do a little research.

XUID's aren't ever the same, unless your primary network adapter is Hamachi/Tungle.

Innocent players being banned? HAH... don't make me laugh. A person who doesn't hack on alteriw shouldnt have any fear of being banned. A ban report requires video proof of you hacking, and people convicted of wall hacks require 3 clips to completely prove that they are hacking.

Yeah, some people are wrongly banned, and if thats the case they can appeal their ban.

You call them power hungry knobs because they are banning hackers?.... /facepalm

You say they treat the community like shit, though they offer us ways to break off of Infinity Ward and steam? Really, i'd say the power hungry knobs are IW and steam, why should i be forced to have an internet connection to play this game? Forced to install Valve's abortion called Steam, dedicated servers are out. modding is out. custom user made maps are out. Oh yeah, ... i just LOVE that.
The truth is, Big name companys are trying to make PC more like the console, focusing more on $ and graphics rather than the actual gameplay & features... but PC isn't a console, it's a PC.

It used to be far less players on the servers and I was able to find a game within 1 minute, now suddenly there is so much more players and I kept searching for a game even for 10 minutes and I never got connected. Also it seems rather suspicious that there is 1337 players connected on every game mode except first 3 and it\'s been like this for a day. Is it just me or does everyone else experience this?"
