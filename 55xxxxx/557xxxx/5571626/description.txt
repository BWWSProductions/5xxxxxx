Another small assortment of backing tracks for blues jams and practice.  I'm still working on the last BIG collection of back tracks for blues players I have collected over my many years of playing.  It will be up in the next month or so.  Watch for it, it will be worth the wait.  Please seed these as long as you can.  And I thank all of you whom have been seeding my uploads.  I really do appreciate it.
