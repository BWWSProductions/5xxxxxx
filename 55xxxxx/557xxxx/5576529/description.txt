DriverScanner 2010.2.2.1.4
Full Version with Serial

DriverScanner is a powerful but easy to use application for quick and efficient driver updates. 
As Windows requires driver-software produced by device manufactures to run practically every 
piece of hardware on your system, the drivers you have installed have a big say on your 
computerâ€™s level of performance. Unless you update your drivers periodically, your computer 
will run at impeded performance with higher risk of errors and conflicts. DriverScanner 2010 
scans your system for outdated drivers and provides the latest manufacturer released drivers 
for you to install with a single click. With the latest set of drivers installed, 
your hardware can run at its best, with fewer errors and better performance.

Main features:
Â» Keep you hardware up to date with the very latest drivers
Â» Download drivers quickly and reliably from one centralized location
Â» Keep restore-points with each driver update for maximum safety
Â» Install each new driver quickly and with ease
Â» Enjoy an elegant but simple to use interface
Â» Update drivers for 32 or 64-bit systems running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7
