,auracool,2011-04-11T21:13Z,"I have owned(at one time or another)all of these albums and i thank you for putting them up on here all together. Shit happens when you have children(cd frisbee's). No need in buying the same cd 2-3 times when its all on the internet, so I do agree with you. Support the artists you enjoy listening to or there will not be anything else to offer in the future. Thanx again!"
