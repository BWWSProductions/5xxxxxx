but this isn't the way Master Bruce Lee teaches it."
[T],Beebe85,2010-05-19T20:49Z,"Very true, this is not how Bruce Lee would teach it. Sifu Ted Wong is the only student of Bruce Lee that teaches it the correct way. There is a lot of info in this video that is useful, after all Jerry did learn directly from Bruce."
