,chaotic82,2010-05-20T11:51Z,"yeah I noticed that too, I fixed it.  But still reguardless it's a working torrent as apposed to the other one on here that will only install but not run...  I don't know if this one will run on windows 7 or vista, I am using XP still."
,chaotic82,2010-05-20T12:02Z,"Something I forgot to add, if anyone wants any other games send me a email @ dbubon7@gmail.com.  I have a few like this one and some random others....  But I do have quite a collection."
,Cryptly,2010-06-07T07:12Z,"Sweet thanks, finaly a working version (I'm on a vista)"
,chaotic82,2010-06-09T03:25Z,You are welcome Cryptly.  Finally someone thanks me for the upload.  Oh this is to everyone; if by some chance this becomes unavailable because of selfish ass leachers hit me up.
,Xaenor,2010-07-18T23:18Z,"Thank you, chaotic82. That's an interesting game for those who like D&D, and it's not that simple to find."

,sportslayer,2010-09-13T04:18Z,"i followed the instructions in http://www.ehow.com/how_5655957_play-pool-radiance-computer.html and it didn't work (it is a guide on how to fix the first game), however by adding ForceDirectDrawEmulation,
CorrectBitmapHeader,
CorrectCreateIcon,
CorrectCreateSurface,
DirectXTrimTextureFormats,
EmulateDirectDrawSync and
EmulateDrawText
i got it to work without every 3dobject being transparent, not all may be needed but works like that."
,sportslayer,2010-09-13T04:19Z,Running it on Win7 ultimate 64bit
,Nocat1988,2010-11-15T09:37Z,Even with the fix that Sportslayer posted I can not get this game to work for me on Win7 x64 Ultimate. Any ideas?
,Nocat1988,2010-11-15T09:47Z,"I figured it out. Instead of using all of those fixes on POR II.exe, I first right clicked on por2main.exe unchecked read-only, and used them on it. Fixed and 3d is working like a charm."
,SNMaou,2011-01-10T16:18Z,"I was looking for a new D&D game, and I'm enjoying this thoroughly. Thanks for the upload."
,mishnab,2011-01-31T15:10Z,"is this torrent still available? the availability line is marked at red (i might be doing something wrong =3 im still new with torrent) if you guys can help it would be appreciated :)
thanks"
,PiP3SM0k3,2011-04-21T20:22Z,supposedly the second iso isnt working. may just be me but when i tried to copy it to a disc (twice) it acts as if it is copying something but theres nothing on the disc. when i check the rar itself it says it is unknown format or damaged. cd1 copied fine and i can look at the rar's contents... anyone have any helpful info?? i love this game and am super looking forward to playing it!!!
,actiondubb,2011-09-30T07:25Z,its important to note that you have to used the unpatched version if you want the compatiblity thing to work. took me a week of forum searching to figure that out. AND the por2main is the one to use it on. AND make sure disc 2 is in
,tolisanon,2011-10-02T20:49Z,"Works fine on Windows 7 64bit, thank you :)"
,HackD,2012-02-25T22:09Z,I am brand new to this and I just got my laptop. >.< can anyone help me out? I'm running on windows 7.
,smusam,2012-06-27T23:23Z,"yo chaotic82 your awesome I love games like these if you know anymore games like the PC Version Pool of Radiance Ruins of Myth Drannor please can you do me a favor and give me a list.

I want games with the exact gameplay like this one.  I checked out Diablo and buldurs gate but they don't have the battle turn gameplay.  I mean like i get to attack then the monsters get to attack sort of thing.....  Thank you you're awesome!!!!!"
