I had seen this game on many sites all over the place and it is a unworking torrent.  So I found a used copy on amazon and decided to buy the game so that way I may share with you all.  So to the best of my knowledge this will work.  This is my first upload and I am new to the sharing part I usually just took but now I am giving back to the community and have to don my skull and cross bones to be a pirate.... LOL.  Oh I didn't have a no cd patch, but I am sure that you all could find one, so other than that this game is all in order.  

I will SEED for a few days....
