[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-21T05:46Z,@madwiggyNLD==No torrent gets a bunch of seeders when it just gets uploaded. So better fuck off and do not download this.
,BMW_318tds,2010-05-21T07:29Z,"There are now 800+ seeders and 8600+ leechers, downloading does not go very fast but that's logic of course, since the game came out 2 days ago..."
,BMW_318tds,2010-05-23T15:04Z,The game is really fantastic!!! I'm seeding right now without limitation :)
,nh_rabbi,2010-05-25T06:59Z,please seed.....very low speed.....
,Vaare,2010-06-02T17:08Z,"I've put it on my seedbox and will be keeping it there for a while. I can upload max 1.0MB/s on that one, so it doesn't interfere with ohers.t. I'll probably keep it on until it reaches 100-150GB upload."

The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.
I think this game is not compatible with x64. "
,Vaare,2010-06-06T08:01Z,Well I've already uploaded 260GB+. Might as well go for 500. But that's it. More people need to stick on the torrent.
,Sonnysrb,2010-06-11T10:01Z,"gays,please help me,i am stuck at 60 %...seeeddd please.....so i can finish this.thank you anyway"
,fingerdish,2010-06-19T02:59Z,"Just a question, How can i install this game with so many RAR files? Will i unRAR them one by one?"
,kostasthepirateGR,2011-05-25T21:09Z,fingerdish you unrar any file you want not all just one k?
