Alex welcomes back to the show [hour 3, into 1st of hour 4] William Gheen, the leader of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC or ALIPAC, which is one of the largest grassroots organizations in America fighting for more immigration enforcement, border security and against illegal immigration and Amnesty. Gheen appears regularly on hundreds of talk radio shows across America, as well as on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and CBS. Mr. Gheen is often quoted in newspaper articles and is sourced in publications like USA Today, the New York Times, the LA Times, the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, the Washington Post and the Washington Times.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
