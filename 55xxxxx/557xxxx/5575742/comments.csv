,dhruv990,2010-05-22T07:54Z,"hate to say this but first time I've faced some problem with a noir release. Some times the video skips audio is late, and other times video skips and pixelates for a few seconds before resuming. even after updating codecs."
,MasTeR_DooM,2010-05-22T11:52Z,"@dhruv990 yes i have same problem , you can use AVI-Mux_GUI-1.17.7 and fix audio , put "" -500 ms "" and it will work it will be fine but still audio is total C***
Its same copy as The.Wolfman.2010.UNRATED.480p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON but litle compress ...
Still video is 10 but audio is 5

A 05

,dhruv990,2010-05-22T20:13Z,"Sorry my bad the problem i faced only lasts the first 5-10 minutes after that theres no problem. Though I must say its a pretty bad movie, other than the effects and gore theres nothing, none of the actor's potential has been exploited, makes the movie seem bland."
