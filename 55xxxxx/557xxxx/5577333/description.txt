The 4 installer DVDs from the new Scientific Linux 5.5



From the announcement:

Scientific Linux release 5.5 has been released for i386 and x86_64.

We have added gnuplot42 as well as the iwlwifi 6000 ucode (firmware). The Upstream Vendor has also added freeradius2 and postgresql84, as well as updated OpenOffice to 3.1.1.
For the full list of what we have added, or updated, please see the release notes.

We want to thank everyone who has contributed, tested, and given us feedback. We say that every time, but we really mean it. Many of the features in Scientific Linux come from our community. Without everyone's contributions, help and testing, this release wouldn't be as good as it is.

Scientific Linux release 5.5 is based on the rebuilding of RPMS out of SRPMS's from Enterprise 5 Server and Client, including Update 5. It also has all errata and bugfixes up until the morning of May 18, 2010.
