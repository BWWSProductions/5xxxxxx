Muchas Gracias! ¡Salud!

Works for me
For this game I used:

latest ver. of USB Loader GX
Error 002 fix (on)
IOS 249
------------------------------------

Can this guy get a skull or somthin TPB? All you lil kids don't need to ask about fakes or viruses on Markuf's torrents. Always good. If you have problems configuring your wii to play this game DON'T post: ""OMG it doesn't work. Probably fake...""

Get a life and don't mess with stuff you don't know about and then falsely accuse uploaders of posting non-working stuff. This got especially crazy with all the Monster Hunter Tri uploads cuz alot of you noobs didn't know what you were doing."

Can anyone confirm that this game works on a -PAL- Wii with Wiikey 1?
Or must I do something with the ISO to get it to work?

I have already bricked one Wii (with Mario Galaxy 1, hehe) so I am a little nervous to burn and test NTSC games on my PAL Wii..

Thanks in advance / Mondo"

When I open the ISO in Regionfrii a message pops up that says: 

The file does´nt look ""normal"". Possible reason:
- not a WII ISO file

But it can be opened..


I have patched it to PAL and then used Brickblocker on it but it does´nt appear in disc channel.. Hmm..

Can my Wii be bricked if I just burn the game rigt away without  brickblock/regionfrii?"

Yes, you have to register to post.

Also, any sort of DVD-R is fine, +R's can wear out your DVD drives laser. There are also a lot of other ways to boot games, its all up to you.
Have fun."

Thanks uploader, yes it works guys! i am so happy, my wii wasn't even hacked yesterday, now it is I can play downloaded games!! 
First you have to hack you wii.
Go to http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/
Follow the step by step guide for YOUR wii version. eg mine was 4.2, yours may be 3/4.1 etc.

Once you have done (and installed Neogamma(to load from DVD drive, or USB Loader GX(HDD/USB), you can play from DVD or USB/HDD. I'm loading from DVD on a PAL system(awesome)

and once it is hacked look at this guide:
http://www.wiihacks.com/wii-games/59089-guide-super-mario-galaxy-2-a.html


Note! I didn't even need IOS56 that is mentioned on the game guide.

So basically, it is not too hard, this game does work, and it even runs on PAL from DVD (simply Unrar the file,. burn the ISO as slowly as possible to a DVD-R disc with imgburn(i used imation).

if u have a question ill try answer it,"
