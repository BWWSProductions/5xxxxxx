Bristow is a character in a popular British strip cartoon.

Since 1962, Bristow has been drawn by the cartoonist Frank Dickens, and until 2001 appeared in the London Evening Standard newspaper. 

The strip was widely syndicated. The cartoons follow the daily life of a buying clerk who works in the monolithic Chester-Perry building. 

He is a fantasist and has delusions of grandeur, wishing he was a brain surgeon and a writer. 

He lives in a small bedsit in East Winchley and commutes to work by train, invariably arriving late. 

Bristow is surrounded by co-workers, Fudge (his overbearing manager), Jones, Dimkins, Miss Sunman, master chef Gordon Blue, and the tealadies. 

Bristow was made into a BBC Radio series starring the late Michael Williams.
