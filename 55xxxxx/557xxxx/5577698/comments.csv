But what has happen? I can't download and everyone is at 0%.

I hope you can fix it because I really like these cover albums!"

,rockdude367,2010-05-22T18:19Z,"Biomechanicall apparently does not use a DHT enabled Bittorrent client. Otherwise we would be able to download. Let's just wait and see.

Dude if you are reading this I suggest Vuze or uTorrent. "
