alluded to on Necro's MySpace profile as a ""brand new solo album coming September 2009"";
 however on August 13, the page's header was updated with an announcement of the album's 
title and its release date, which has been pushed to May 2010. Die! will be Necro's first 
album effort since 2007's Death Rap, and will be released by Psycho+Logical-Records. 
The album finally got a release date when the album cover was released on March 25, 2010.

There will be no featured guests on the album as recently stated by Necro on his website forums: 
""I decided I wanna make the entire album no collabos. It will be Necro beats and Necro lyrics from start to finish.
