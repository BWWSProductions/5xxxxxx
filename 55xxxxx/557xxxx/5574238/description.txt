Complete Feature List 

Changes in J.River Media Center 15.0.35 (4/29/2010): 
1. NEW (Experimental!): Remuxing of television recording (digital television only, i.e. ATSC or DVB-T) jtv files to MKV. 
Requires Haali Matraska Muxer filter which is part of Haali Media Splitter installation. 
Select jtv files, and go to Tools > Advanced Tools > Convert Format... 
2. Changed: It is no longer possible to create a new library in a non-empty folder 
(the program requires full control over its library folder, and deletes files in that folder that are obsolete or foreign). 
3. Changed: List-style fields like image keywords are saved to the database with spaces 
after delimiters. ("Al; Bob" instead of "Al;Bob") 
4. Changed: Doing a manual 'Quick Find Cover Art' will force a rescan of a directory for 
art (previously could use a cached scan up to one minute old) 
5. Changed: MCWS (developers web service) is available on a client using protocol commands. 
(i.e. on a local webpage, mc15://MCWS/v1/Playback/Pause) 
6. Changed: The Library Server root page has a link to connect to the server (requires Media Center to be installed). 
7. Fixed: Crash in "Export to iPod..." when trying to export unsupported media types. 

NOTE: 
Some Antivirus scanners will give an Trojan Alert for the Patch file,
