Short film inspired by the poem by the English poet William Blake.
A tiger invades the streets of Sao Paulo transforming people into animals and things leaving a Trace Of the city glowing forms.
The brilliance of the people shown in color, flights, gestures that transform the metropolis.

THE TYGER

    Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
    In the forests of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

    In what distant deeps or skies
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
    On what wings dare he aspire?
    What the hand, dare seize the fire?

    And what shoulder & what art,
    Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
    And when thy heart began to beat,
    What dread hand & what dread feet?

    What the hammer? what the chain?
    In what furnace was thy brain?
    What the anvil? what the grasp
    Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

    When the stars threw down their spears,
    And water'd heaven with their tears,
    Did he smile his work to see?
    Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

    Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
    In the forests of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
    Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
