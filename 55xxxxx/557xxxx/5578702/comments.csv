,jersson,2010-05-21T21:15Z,Whats the difference between these two downloads Hide and superhide ?

Well, for what I can see, the files inside are almost equal, and also the graphic interface is pretty similar. Actually there are four different IP hiders that come from four different sites, that I think they are made from the same person, as they look almost the same. But it's OK, if the crack works well for all of them, you can choose which one you want. At least, if one doesn't work anymore, try with another one... :o)"

Thanks for your uploads m8!"

Here it's working fine, and the link above shows my fake IP. Obviously it says that's a Proxy, but it works. I shows the fake IP even reaching it through www.earthunblock.info. Stupid question I know, did you pushed the ""Hide IP"" button? "
[V],big_dad_e,2010-05-24T00:16Z,"@ NoExcuses, I did push the button and got the new IP display and it still shows my real IP on the site.  I'm running Firefox, I haven't tried it with IE.  The same with Hide IP Platinum, Real, and others."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-05-24T07:31Z,"It DOES work fine with IE, just not Firefox, and I did install & re-install their FF plug-in/add-on."

I use only Firefox and here it's working fine, clicking the ""Check IP"" button it shows the fake IP, not my real one. I can say that it works as my country has blocked access to TPB, and if you don't use some kind of proxie you 'll not be able to connect here. Did you tried to clean cache and other things from FF? Sometimes this kind of IP Hiders are working only on a clean installation of FF, don't know why. At lest is easier uninstall and reinstall FF than go hunting for the problem..."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-05-25T07:34Z,"Thanks NoExcuses, I must have a FF bug, like I stated none of these IP cloakers work for me.
@ unix66, You're a big help, STFU & learn how to create a torrent so you can put some booty on the table.  Leech."
