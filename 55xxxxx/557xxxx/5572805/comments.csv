,Chouonsoku,2010-05-22T00:38Z,"Technically these aren't ""old"", they just did a couple of the episodes as sneak peaks a few months ago. This is the first time the episodes of ""officially"" aired. :)"
,snowolfen,2010-05-25T06:10Z,Chouonsoku: Thank you kindly for your efforts to make Adventure Time available to everyone!
,Navirio,2010-05-25T17:27Z,"Thanks chouonsoku

,sweaterpuppies1,2010-05-25T17:27Z,"You sir rock. I been lovin these iTunes WEB-DLs from some other private communities (and those ones are HD), really nice quality stuff. Much better than scene quality.

I hope you continue to post Adventure Time publicly here. As I haven't seen decent quality versions of it anywhere else."
,whatxx,2010-05-29T02:30Z,"nice man! only people doing these are you, ken7 & 449. oh and you should resize to a mod16 resolution if you're gonna use h264. thanks keep em coming"

keep em coming? plz? :D "
,RelaxRelapse,2010-05-30T07:23Z,This is Rhombus! I only download from you because you have the best quality I've seen so as long as you're uploading I'm supporting you :)
,Chouonsoku,2010-06-07T18:39Z,"The mod16 rule is ridiculously outdated and doesn't apply anymore. Also, these aren't encoded by me, they're from iTunes. And this show isn't aired in HD, so whatever ""HD"" version you're getting is just an upscale. This is currently the best quality version of this series available."
,minicoz2,2010-06-13T19:25Z,Hey! Episode 7 is out! Part a & B! Do your have it in HQ .mkv! Please

,figrindan,2010-06-20T18:59Z,"Thank you, Chouonsoku.  Looking forward to Ep's 7 & 8.  Keep up the great work!"

,Chouonsoku,2010-06-22T20:27Z,"Never donate money to someone for something that they don't own the rights to. If you want to donate money, send it to Frederator Studios with a letter telling them how much you enjoy Adventure Time!

Episodes 7 and 8 are coming up in a few minutes. :)"
