,realdivers,2010-08-11T14:41Z,Downloaded this and found it's a crappy upsample that looks slightly worse than the original DVD. Please let this torrent die. Waste of bandwidth.
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-11-21T19:09Z,"Source, for fuck's sake, you fucking monkey, is this a retarded HDTV crappo bullshit like the rest, or are we looking at Bluray?"

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-01T15:34Z,"realdivers is just trying to kill the torrent.

This is NOT an upscaled version, it's definitely 1080p. Although I have to say the quality is not nearly as good as one would expect from this size.

Some filter has been applied, looks like a temporal smoother, which blurs out details. So far it's the only viable 1080p we have though... Hoping for something better, but it'll have to do for now."
