Summary:
SPOILER REVEALS ENDING Following King Richard's death in France archer Robin Longstride,along with Will Scarlett, Alan-a-Dale and Little John,decides to return to England.
They encounter the dying Robert of Locksley,whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey,who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England, and Robin promises the
dying knight he will return his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham. Here Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land being confiscated
by the crown,and he finds himself with Marian, a ready-made wife.Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak King John and allow an easy French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the king's service as Earl Marshal of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes. Walter tells Robin he knew his father,a freedom-fighter who hoped to unite the barons for a better society but Walter is killed by Godfrey after a raid on Nottingham. Robin rallies the barons and the king and thwarts the invasion,avenging Walter by slaying Godfrey. Sensing that Robin's popularity makes him a threat,John declares him an outlaw. Thus along with his friends,including his wife and her priest Friar Tuck, Robin joins other orphans and outcasts in the greenwoods where the legend begins.
