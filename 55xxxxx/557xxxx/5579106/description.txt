'City of Gold' is Mahesh Manjarekar's directorial magnum opus. It traces the story of the textile mill workers of Bombay from the strike of 1982, and how entire families slowly sink into the quagmire of hopelesness and despair.
The strike, amazingly, is still on today, with trade union leaders in eager anticipation of a court ruling, which is 28 long years due.
