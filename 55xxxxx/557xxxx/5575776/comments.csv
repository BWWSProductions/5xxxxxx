Thanks uploader."

,chaucerchris,2010-07-14T05:01Z,Firstly why is it when you open this program it behaves more like a Windows based pc program? For example when browsing for a file it was showing Drive C and a windows folder. Mac doesn\'t have a Drive C. And secondly it couldn\'t fucking see the poser pro 8 rar file that I\'d downloaded. This is going off my hard drive. Thank you anyway.
,Sir_RUSH,2011-01-27T23:05Z,"I believe this is running under Wine which for those whom don't know is a Windows Emulation.  Which is why the directory structure looks so strange as you browse.  That's the only challenge, so pick drive (letter) Z.  Then you'll be at the root directory of your Mac.  Navigate to User/[Login Name]/Downloads or wherever your file is, and there you go.  It's an older version of WinRAR, but it works. :)  You should be able to update to newest WinRAR (32bit) without worries..though you may also need a new key.

I'm not up-to-date with Wine, but my understanding is Wine only uses 32bit so far..so even if you have Snow Leopard (64bit) installed, using WinRAR 64bit won't work because it's not a Mac Native version unless this ""Emulated Windows"" is an installed 64bit.

Thanks a lot for the share!!  If you'd like a more Mac Native RAR program, check into JDownloader and it's Internal RAR...only Unarchive supported.

:)  Peace!"
