This is the official iTunes released single. I bought it, and reencoded it to MP3, which is the most common music format AND does not have my iTunes account linked to it (like the original M4A file did).

I reencoded the file at the SAME bit rate as the original (256 kbps).


When the full album "Nightmare" comes out, I plan on immediately buying the CD and posting the album here.  Look forward to it. ;)


foREVer.

RIP Jimmy.
