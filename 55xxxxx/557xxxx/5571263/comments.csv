,kendeats,2010-05-27T00:13Z,"This is NOT a movie version of the Clive Cussler story by the same name. This is a boringly slow film with little dialogue and lots of long, slow shots of blank faces and trees."
,sakkit,2010-10-31T22:38Z,världens sämsta film någonsin tror jag
,webspyder,2010-11-07T10:27Z,"This movie must have been a world record in budget film making. Crew + actors (one 'celeb') and a hanfull unknown (would you like to be in a movie? You don't get paid but it is a movie with one star in it! - Hell  yeah!) One sailingboat.. filmed in the high mountains and one forrest(sweden? Norway?)
And finally an effort of the producer to explain his delirium (commentator track) in making of this shitty movie (propably he snorted up the whole movie budget and was forced to do this budget crap).
It is not worth the time or the hd space to dwnload this crap. Better to floss your teeth, that's moor giving... :/"
