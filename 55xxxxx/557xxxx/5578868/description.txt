I wanted to make a mix so dirty it made people feel intruded.
But it also had to be uplifting & of course something to dance to.
This is Dirty Discoteka, the first few tracks will make you think' God this is a little on the umm! Dirty fidget side.
There are some nice summer tracks, some progressive house & little tech house. The main theme though is random, that's what I want to achieve.
