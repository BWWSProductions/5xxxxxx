Jussi BjÃ¶rling
The Swedish tenor Jussi BjÃ¶rling (1911-1960) was born in Stora Tuna in the district of Dalarna. As a boy he toured and recorded with the familyquartet, in addition to visiting the United States (1916-26). His adult teachers were his father David, John Forsell (1928-30) and the Scottish tenor Joseph Hislop. He was a member of the Royal Opera in Stockholm from 1930, making his dÃ©but in the small rÃ´le of the Lamplighter in Pucciniâ€™s Manon Lescaut. Hisâ€˜officialâ€™ first appearance was as Don Ottavio in Mozartâ€™s Don Giovanni later that season. Two years later he began his international career in Germany, followed by Vienna (1936), Chicago (1937), the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1938) and Covent Garden the following year. He continued to appear regularly in New York, except in the war years, until 1959. BjÃ¶rling was regarded as the foremost Italiansounding tenor of his day in the spinto rÃ´les of Puccini and Verdi, and he also excelled in French opera. His work was highly respected for its high artistic qualities, even if his acting ability was somewhat stilted and stiff. He recorded extensively from the mid-1930s until his early death in 1960. His poor health in later years was caused by heart problems.
