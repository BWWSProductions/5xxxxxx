,jimraso,2010-05-20T23:59Z,"These micro-mkv container rips are not low low low def - at least the ones that I've DL'd. I can't comment on this one though. The negative is they are only in dolby stereo not 5.1. They play great using Arcsoft TMT or Cyberlink PowerDVD10.

Considering the size and the fact that its 720p, the quality is insane! It looks awesome on my 19"" LCD.

Either you guys squint at ur screens from 2 inch distance, or are noobs! 

Great going, YIFY... expecting more such gems from you. Cheers!!! :)"
