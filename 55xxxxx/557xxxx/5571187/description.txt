Hello! We are Bambi & The Tin Man.

The Sugar Shot EP is our debut EP and we'd like to share it with the world.
We'll be posting all of our albums on here as we create them and hope to make some new friends along the way. If you like our tunes, please seed our torrent!

If you feel like purchasing our music on iTunes, that's cool too! We don't have much money to spend on music either, so we get if you can't afford our album. But if you have 2 bucks on your iTunes account leftover from a birthday present and feel like supporting starving artists, please do.
