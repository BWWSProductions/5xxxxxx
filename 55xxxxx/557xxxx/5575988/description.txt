Split Second is a street racing game action, carried out as if it were a reality show. Run across the street circuits full of explosives with the aim to become the champion of the season. Compete using powerful vehicles through the intricate street circuits. The players not only have to deal with opponents, but also changing the circuits will mean an additional challenge. Buildings and structures fell down on the road, water, fire, smoke and all kinds of dangers that hamper the vision and will lead to constant changes in the route. If a route opens, another closes. All actions are controlled by the pilots once they have acquired the skill and chosen the moment, so each race will be completely different to the last minute. Skids, jumps, avoid debris and flooded tunnels crossing. Split Second reactions will be conditioned by the changing environment caused by the explosions and destruction. Do not settle for running in the circuit. Dominal!
