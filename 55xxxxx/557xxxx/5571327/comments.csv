[T],Knaster,2010-05-19T10:24Z,I have actually seen a UFO for real. Here in Sweden.
,April.Swift,2010-05-19T13:16Z,"My husband is in the USAF as a fighter pilot flying f22. He has seen a lot of UFO but will not talk about it or report it.

A lot of pilots have seen many weird things in the sky but most of them will not talk about for fear of losing their jobs."
[T],Knaster,2010-05-19T13:20Z,"April.Swift i agree i havent reported it either. Because it's the general consensus that if you see an UFO you're an idiot or mentally unstable. 

Well atleast i know what i saw and thats good enough for me. "
,BishopRadar,2010-05-20T02:12Z,"I've not seen a ship, but I've seen 1 alien.  Unfortunately, it was in my room.  Worse, it was on my bed, and I was paralyzed (and terrified), and it was talking in my head that it was alright, go to sleep, etc.  I couldn't keep my eyes open.  I remember it to this day.  That was in 1997.  It (he?  she?) had four long fingers and looked pretty close to what you see the ""greys"" drawn as.  I even remember seeing it blink."
[T],Knaster,2010-05-20T03:23Z,BishopRadar You more likely had a nightmare.

,BishopRadar,2010-05-23T06:51Z,"Knaster -
You said you knew what you saw.  I have had a total of 3 nightmares in my life, so clear and vivid I remember them to this day.  This was not a nightmare.  Nor was it ""sleep paralysis.""  I've had two other occurrences without seeing any(one)thing that _saved_ my life both times.  There are things going on around us we are not told about in order to prevent mass chaos and panic.  I don't know what they wanted with me, but as far as I know, 1997 was the last time."

Can't seem to find it, and it aired quite some time ago..."

Don't know why it isn't showing up in the search but PB's search engine has been plagued with bugs forever."
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2010-05-31T05:42Z,"Yeah, looks like the search engine is totally broken right now.  Nothing seems to be coming up that has been uploaded in the last couple of weeks."
,chaosheritage,2010-07-04T14:09Z,Nice one cheers. Excellent quality
