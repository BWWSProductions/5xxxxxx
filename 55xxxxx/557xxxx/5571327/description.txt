         Reports of encounters with strange beings and sightings       
         of mysterious objects in the sky have occurred throughout     
         history. A 13th century historical book, Otia Imperialia,     
         includes an account of a creature descending from a flying    
         craft over Bristol, England. The log from Christopher         
         Columbus' first voyage to America contains a report of        
         strange lights in the sky. Medieval art pieces depict         
         disc-shaped objects floating in the heavens. Sightings of     
         flying cigar-shaped crafts were reported during the Black     
         Plague. And there were even discussions of extraterrestrial   
         life among America's Founding Fathers. Could these            
         sightings, coming from every part of the world, from          
         biblical times to present day, be evidence that aliens        
          have been with us all along?
