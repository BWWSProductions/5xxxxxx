3 BZIPped ISO CD images (unpack, rename *.img to *.iso and burn).

1) Solaris_2.6_Software_05_98 -- OS installation CD.
2) Solaris_2.6_Maintenance_Update -- ""Maintenance Update 2"", smth. like service pack. It is not necessary to install this update pack because the patches are already included in the OS installation CD.
3) Solaris_2.6_Operating_Environment_Installation_CD_February_2000 -- ""Web Start"" installer for Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6. It is based on Solaris 7, needs extra HDD space to install and requests to insert the main OS installation CD during install, so it's totally useless."

3) Solaris_2.6_Operating_Environment_Installation_CD_February_2000 -- maybe, it's useful for installing Solaris 2.6 on newer machines."
