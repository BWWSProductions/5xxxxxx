Jeremy Messersmith - The Alcatraz Kid (2006)


Jeremy Messersmith is a pop musician based in Minneapolis,Minnesota.

Jeremy Messersmith was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up in the Tri-Cities area of Washington. He moved to Minneapolis in 1999 to attend North Central University.




His first album, The Alcatraz Kid, quickly garnered the attention of the local media, resulting in Messersmith being named the "premier under-30 songwriter in the Twin Cities" by City Pages.The Alcatraz Kid also received the attention of Performing Songwriter Magazine, a national publication that stated, "Remember the way you felt the first time you heard the amazing harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel? That subdued, magical sound lives once more on Jeremy Messersmithâ€™s The Alcatraz Kid, but this time with a 21st-century twist. Messersmith lulls with his gentle voice and overdubbed harmonies, easing the shock of his sometimes-harsh lyrics. Quirky? Certainly. Will you like it? No doubt." This may also remind you to the music and lyrics of Elliott Smith.

The title "The Alcatraz Kid" was inspired by a man who used the name to prank-call where Messersmith worked.
