After Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman sneak into an R-rated movie, the rest of their third grade class is quick to follow.
The kids parents are outraged by the effect the movie has on their innocent young minds and demand to be heard from their small Colorado mountain town.
Anger leads to censorship, censorship to war, and before they know it the boys are risking their lives in the name of freedom. When the dust finally settles, the Baldwin brothers have finally been killed in the crossfire and everyone has learned two very important lessons; communication between parents and children is vital, and the world is a better place without the Baldwins.

Enjoy!!
