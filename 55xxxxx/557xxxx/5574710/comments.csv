,Receptionist,2010-06-09T23:03Z,how the hell did you get 1280x544 into only 600mb???
,Shplankey,2010-06-16T20:52Z,"I had my doubts but I stand corrected. Great upload YIFY, on both this one and The Wolfman. Awesome video quality in only 600 MB!"
,Bonesmasher,2010-08-09T11:35Z,"Dude, this rip is AMAZING. The quality is SO good. The only complaint I have is that I have to turn the English subtitles off everytime I open it (don't like looking at them). Awesome upload man, do you reckon you could do Kick Ass?"

,kotul1989,2012-01-02T19:48Z,Thank you so much! You are officially my torrent provider! Great quality! Happy new year!!!  
,[PoD],2012-06-08T06:58Z,The video quality is so good because the audio is 2.0 and not 5.1 or higher like regular Blu-rays. If YIFY rips had 5.1 they would be perfect.
,countryraj,2012-06-16T16:47Z,"great quality with less size !
thanks, +1 added."
,PauloFran,2012-06-29T01:28Z,"Nice video quality.
Thank you!"
,5a6r0s0,2012-07-08T12:37Z,"WOW thanks YIFY :thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup:
I believe Yify is the mayor Trending Video-Group
and I don't mean they only release HD version, as also 1080p HD version, they even realese 3D version, WOW!!! (I love the 1280x544p resolution)
I mean the image&audio quality and the subtitles are so so SO FAR the best!!! (Even Netflix would dream have this so good quality vs size video file).
This is a 600mb video mkv file and the quality is superior by far than other 1300-1500mb video mp4 files If you do a comparative.
I really need to change my movie library to this format and save tones of GBs.
Thank you so much, really appreciate the hardwork to make this.:thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup:"
,tman2010,2012-07-12T16:45Z,I know this sounds dumb but how do you turn off the subtitles?
