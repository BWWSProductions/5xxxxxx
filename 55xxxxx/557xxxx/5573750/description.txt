20 of the fattest reggae/dub jams of all time

it isn't all strictly west coast/california reggae (90% is), i got a bit of everything in there
but seriously this is the shit, i have loved this genre forever and i've scoured the
internet for the best poppin music and so i present to you this album that will blow you
away. post feedback on the torrent if you wanna add some tracks to the list and i'll 
update it. I'm so sick of reggae compilations with friken jimmy cliff and burning spear, 
gimme some real reggae thas what i'm talking about (not that i don't like the afore mentioned
but seriously, enough already)

enjoy
