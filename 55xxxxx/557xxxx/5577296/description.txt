Powder Burns is the fourth album by Greg Dulli's The Twilight Singers (not counting Dulli's solo album Amber Headlights. It was released on May 16, 2006 via One Little Indian Records on CD and double 12" vinyl. During the recordings in 2005, Greg Dulli was aided by Manual Agnelli, who co-wrote "My Time (Has Come)" and "The Conversation." "My Time (Has Come)" was first released in 2005 as "White Widow" on Afterhours' Ballads for Little Hyenas, which in turn was co-produced by Dulli. Other collaborators on this album are Joseph Arthur, Jeff Klein and Ani di Franco. The same recording sessions yielded the follow-up EP A Stitch in Time, released in early 2007.

Powder Burns was partly recorded with extra power generators in a deserted New Orleans just after the floods caused by Hurricane Katrina.

It was released to positive reviews, and actor/comedian Denis Leary called it "one of the best rock albums I've heard in 10 years," also putting the song "Bonnie Brae" in Rescue Me, his Emmy nominated TV series. In addition to that the song "There's Been an Accident" featured on the film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Choke.

The Twilight Singers made their live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on January 3, 2007, performing "Forty Dollars" and "Sublime" (which did not air).

A cover version of the song "I'm Ready" featured in the HBO series True Blood, in the episode "I Don't Wanna Know."
