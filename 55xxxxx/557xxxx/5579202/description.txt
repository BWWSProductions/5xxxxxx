As a long time Windows user you might have heard about registry. The registry is a special file in your hard disk that hold most of Windows settings data. Wish to improve your internet speed or display message at Windows logon? No problem, those tasks can easily be done by simply editing the registry value. Unfortunately registry is not a friendly place for most people. Changing a wrong value in the registry may cause an unpredictable problem to your Windows. This is why novice users should not edit registry value directly using a registry editor by them self.  In TweakNow WinSecret, we have gathered the most popular Windows XP/Vista registry settings and provide them for you in an easy and safe user interface. All settings are divided in  the following sections:

    * Applications
    * Control Panel
    * Desktop
    * Miscellaneous
    * Network & Internet
    * OEM Info
    * Special Folders
    * Start Menu
    * User Accounts
    * Windows Core
    * Windows Explorer

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. It's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal 
http://virusscan.jotti.org/ 
http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at: 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
