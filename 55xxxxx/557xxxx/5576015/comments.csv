,hauntnut,2011-05-19T08:17Z,"If the specs are correct on this page, then the problem others are having could be due to the fact that some PS3s will not play an M2TS file that has a DTS audio track. Could be a firmware issue; I'm not sure, I stopped using the PS3 a long time ago. As far as PC users are concerned, just update your codecs, or download VLC player."
