,commentboy123,2010-05-19T01:11Z,"No prob. :)
But they're just being smart about how they would sell much more albums this way...and besides the author loves Muse anyway.
You shouldn't think less of Muse or as shame just because they're supporting Twilight."

,commentboy123,2010-05-21T01:28Z,"Yup, hope they do...Origin of Symmetry was fucking awesome. :)"
