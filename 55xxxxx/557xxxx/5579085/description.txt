Dragapella Barbershop Quartet, "The Kinsey Sicks," do their worst to satirize
conservative politics in the USA. These guys make and market their own CDs, so
if you like them, buy their CDs! http://www.kinseysicks.com/

The group is a collection of men (all gay, iirc) based in San Fransisco who left 
their jobs, from the attorney who wrote Chicago's 1989 gay rights ordinance to
actors... and even the former Director of the national Gay and Lesbian Medical 
Association and one-time presidential advisor on HIV issues. 

The Kinsey Sicks have performed in 40 states (and will add Alabama later this 
year). They tour regularly, so go see their shows (they're a blast)!
