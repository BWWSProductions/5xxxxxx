,hofo_mofo,2012-03-04T19:03Z,"To increase your bandwidth speed (in uTorrent [3.1.2]) do the following:

--> Options --> Preferences --> Bandwidth

Look under NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS

Increase your Global maximum number of connections and of course your maximum number of connected peers per torrent; also while you're at it, increase your number of upload slots per download.
