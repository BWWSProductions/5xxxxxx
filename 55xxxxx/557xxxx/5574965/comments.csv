[T],FatFreddy39,2011-08-07T06:18Z,"I kept seeing the book scattered around in the game and thought it might be a real book. Thanks a lot, I like post apocalyptic/dystopian reads and this (I imagine) will be great just like the game :)"

,tatuDowns,2011-12-22T13:18Z,"Thank You!! 
I liked the game and in one of the missions I saw the book lying around on the metro rails. So i thought I would give it a look online. Since i'm not much of a book fan, i probably wouldn't read all of it so i'm not gonna buy it. So thanks for providing :)"

There is a Sequel to Metro 2033, called Metro 2034.
No, it hasn't been translated into English unfortunately. It has been translated into many other languages though."
