I am a firm believer in the Bible and the Chirstian God,  While I am no chapter and verse quoter, as some are, I have read the whole book more than twice, the New Testament more than a dozen times and I cannot find this Rapture some of you folks are so jones about.  Christ describes, briefly, how people will be going about their business and one will be taken, and one will be left; but that's it.  Nothing more.  Nothing in Revelations mentions a great even when half the world's population simply vanishes.  So are you basing your whole Rapture theory on a couple sentences Jesus said when describing ""the end"" to his followers?  Church scholars to this day debate what end He was even talking about, the fall of Jerusalem, or the end of the world!  The Bible must be taken as a whole; not diced up into little bits of belief.  Otherwise, why aren't more of the faithful handless, footless, and blind??  Are ye all without sin??"
