Hospital Brut is a squat Svankmajer fighting mass production with special edition, combating excess with excess; visual culture relobotomised into a Deleuzian cyborg nightmare that advertising can only dream of reaching. Conceived as an asylum where the audience calls at each of the wards to observe the heavily medicated inmates / artists, HOPITAL BRUT is a toxic mix of Visionary Outsider Art, Underground Comics, Manga and good olâ€™ Pornography from over 80 artists â€“ a world wide selection from Europe, Japan, the UK and USA. You won't believe your eyes when you watch the most amazing cartoon surrealist art and video work from prolific Marseilles based collective Le Dernier Cri.Truly one of the most unsung works of art to ever come from the 20th century. Hospital Brut is an absolute must see!
