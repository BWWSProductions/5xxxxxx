,Kaimyrholen,2010-05-21T14:12Z,"Is it really getting cancelled?

I seriously hope not, this is one of the best shows iv'e seen.

They can't just cancel such a successfull show.

,Dr_Science,2010-05-21T19:39Z,"why bother guys? this show is getting cancelled. TV Guide has it on their fall line up special and you can check it on other web sites.  

Hey Heroes got cancelled too so don't think that flashforward is safe."
,CemTheTurk,2010-05-21T20:15Z,"are you guys really suprised its getting cancelled,its hardly something they can get a second series out of and the fact its becoming a bit yawn now."
,Kaimyrholen,2010-05-21T20:50Z,"@CemTheTurk
Well, that's your opinion.

I don't think it's becoming even a bit ""Yawn""
It's getting better and better by each episode."
,Lassik,2010-05-22T00:09Z,"I'm sure people downloading the show here doesn't help with it's ratings....

That's why I still set my box to tune in to all my favorite shows. I only download here because I do most of my watching at work when it's slow."
,Kaimyrholen,2010-05-22T01:55Z,"Well, first of all..
It has not been confirmed by ABC that Flash Forward is getting cancelled..
So, it might happen, and it might not."
