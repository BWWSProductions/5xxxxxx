A battle of god-like proportions begins...right now! For months, the signs have been all over the Marvel Universe... The tension has been rising... All pointing to a single question: "What is CONTINUUM?" The answer turns out to be so deadly, so horrifying, that it will alter the course of the MU forever - unless Hercules and the New and Mighty Avengers can stop it in time. But, standing in their way is the fighting-mad ARES, God of War! And, in our backup tale, there's no love for Venus as Aphrodite's rain of pain continues to pour on the Agents of Atlas!

All hail to the glory of the original scanners and uploaders.
