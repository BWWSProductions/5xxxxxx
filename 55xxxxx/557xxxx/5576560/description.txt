Hello Everyone,

Thanks for taking the time to Download and help me with these songs.

OK ....

So I have these 13 songs, which I can't identify.
They are transfers to mp3 from very old cassette tapes.
( Sorry about the quality )
But I'm trying to find these again ( Good Copy's )

If you can help me out, that would be awesome !!!

Thanks again to whoever downloads.

Note:

These are just samples from the tapes not complete songs.
All the songs are not complete as the tapes were damaged.

Thx
Xenon

P.S. Feel free to leave comments with the number of track and name if you know it.
