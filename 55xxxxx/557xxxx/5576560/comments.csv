,techno935,2010-05-21T05:32Z,This was actually fun.  I enjoy IDing music.  Nothing I hate more than being in the dark with no song titles!

Awesome .... Thx for #4 for the life of me I couldn't remember that one but I knew that Sting was a ""guest"" singer on that track."
,johntroll,2010-05-21T05:47Z,"At first listen I could only identify one of them with certainity: Track no. 7 is ""Theme from Grea Cities"" by Simple Minds. You can find it on the album ""Sons and Fascination""....

I KNOW that I have track no. 5 somewhere, I thought it was Dead Can dance, but the song wasn't to be found on any of my albums. At least the vocalist sound like Brandon Perry"
,johntroll,2010-05-21T05:51Z,"Found it: No. 5 is ""ullysses"" from the album ""Serpents egg"""
,johntroll,2010-05-21T06:11Z,"No 11. is ""Haiti"" by Cabaret Voltaire from the album The Crackdown"
,johntroll,2010-05-21T06:28Z,"As mentioned by others here: No. 10 is ""Perfect"" by The The in 12' version. It can be found on the collection 45 RPM in original and 12' version. Song appeared originally on the album ""Soul Mining"""
