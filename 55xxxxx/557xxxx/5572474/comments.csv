[V],-jonny-,2010-05-19T16:50Z,Well if it isn't another DUPLICATE
[V],BOZX,2010-05-19T16:55Z,"This is just another torrent
not a Duplicate. No one owns The Internet.
So no have the right to descide dupes in this public place "
[V],-jonny-,2010-05-19T18:21Z,"wtf. i'm not talking about who owns the internet, bonny.

duplicates are counterproductive and you know this. you just have to get your name seen as much as possible. it's a fairly common disorder but you ought to do something about it."
[V],BOZX,2010-05-19T18:34Z,"what would u want to say about this....

,popejerico,2010-05-20T02:11Z,"That's the problem with other people... they are so busy using the internet that they have forgotten HOW TO READ!!! 

This is the only version of the movie which is in 1080p and in DTS format! So how can this be a dupe in the first place? No offense meant to others but I won't be downloading something in AC3 format and I'm glad this torrent finally available. And this is the only one of its kind."
,popejerico,2010-05-20T02:13Z,My mistake... I take it back this is a dupe. :P
,N2x,2010-05-20T02:23Z,This torrent contains a video sample and checksum file while aoloffline's does not. 
,pyromane,2010-05-21T09:58Z,"Yeah, Thanks for the great upload! 

-jonny- is the best! I have a few of his uploads and they are always highest quality! Whohoha ;-) "
,hpisaliar,2010-05-23T17:07Z,"Hi

Book of eli Bluray is supposed to be released on 15th June 2010. Just wondering then what is the source of this movie"
,xAlexburnsred,2010-05-26T05:55Z,thanks for the upload!  +1
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-05-29T18:27Z," -jonny-   is just an other hypocrite. He uploads just the torrent file made by others and seeds probably nothing at all. I'm curious how many of his torrents were actually ripped/made by him, if any. (torrent whore ;-) 
the size is perfect for a 2 Hours 1080p movie with DTS.
Thx  BOZX"
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-05-29T19:18Z,"pretty fast download by the way(avg 500 kB/s).
I wonder how many people are interested in a 120 MB Sample though. If one wants to see the sample first, should be able to download it in less then 5 minutes.
A 20 seconds long sample would be enough to see the quality and test if the system can play it(for those with lower RAM and older graphic card etc.)"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-06-09T03:48Z,is it a big deal if it's a duplicate ? He's serving the pirate bay as all of us.. Thanks man this is a excellent torrent.
[V],-jonny-,2011-02-16T17:19Z,"@mkvonly Check the meaning of the word ""hypocrite"", prick. A torrent's origin is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT, while making dupes hurts both torrents. Totally unrelated matters."
