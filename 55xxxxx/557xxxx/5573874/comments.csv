,Hawk-1,2010-05-21T21:18Z,"The torrent is dead it wont download for me.
Anyone know whats going on."
,james24dean,2010-05-21T22:32Z,"Hawk-1: Piratebay's torrent has been dead for months.

before starting to download a movie, right click on the mouse and add a torrent from OpenBitTorrent, which sadly is down right now, or from PublicBTorrent."
,james24dean,2010-05-21T22:32Z,I read about this at TorrentFreak too!!
,Hawk-1,2010-05-22T00:48Z,"""james24dean"" Not sure what you mean..I just downloaded a torrent from TPB yesterday.
I know TPB was down for a few days I read that to from TorrentFreak. But everything worked out. I downloaded this from Kickass this time ?
Thanks. "
,SystemFolder,2010-05-22T03:51Z,"It's downloading fine for me, but I can see that all the trackers are down. Maybe try a torrent client that uses DHT?"
,fakk_2,2010-05-22T19:04Z,Torrentfreak... so cool 
[V],WeeKnighT,2010-06-01T02:44Z,"Video: MP4v (h.264) , 640x480x, 993 kbps, 23.976 fps
Audio: 128kbps AAC, 44.1 kHz, 2CH (stereo)
Runtime: 1:26:34

Very nice quality, slides between WS and FS depending what they are showing. It's obviously an unfinished movie ( you see 11 seconds of:  Insert Picture of 11 Computers )

It's getting a bit dated, wikipedia shows more updated information on all the participants."
,Video_Veg,2010-07-02T04:20Z,"To see a good movie that would otherwise be discarded and forgotten is one of the great things about BitTorrents. Movie is a bit dated, but has good record of computer history ~ Thanks"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-10-12T10:51Z,"thanks again I lost this when I reformatted, forgot to back it up. Respect"
,burningrabbit,2011-02-21T03:22Z,"20.Feb.2011- this movie is downloading quick, fast, and in a hurry. Ten seeders are feeding me right now. Get it while it's hot. Thanks Anon."
,userbiasa2000,2011-04-24T14:49Z,April 24th 2011 Fast download with 22 seeders alive
