A black cloud hangs over Ken and Ryuâ€™s reunion. Brought together by the mysterious death of their master, the two warriors must overcome a challenge unlike any theyâ€™ve faced before.

Increasingly disturbed by the dark energies building within him, Ryu is unexpectedly confronted with the appearance of Shun â€“ a boy claiming to be the long-lost brother he never knew. Soon, signs of their common lineage are revealed as Shun enters a martial arts competition and manifests the same fearsome Dark Hadou. But before Ryu has the chance to consider whether Shunâ€™s timely appearance might be more than coincidental, agents of the insidious Shadowlaw organization kidnap the boy.

To recover the child, Ryu must undertake the ultimate journey of self-discovery and learn to control the power threatening to consume him. But with this confidence waning, will he have what it takes to confront Akuma - the vicious lord of the Dark Hadou himself?

Find out as allies old and new join forces against a sinister new threat in the pulse-pounding sequel to the phenomenally popular Street Fighter IIV series.
