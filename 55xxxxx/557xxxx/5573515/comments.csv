,Nakus,2010-05-20T01:20Z,"I had this anime on my Harddisk for a long time. I checked out TPB and seen a incomplete version. 

I have checked this version quickly and skipped througha couple episodes, it all looked fine. Been a while since i last seen this one and i dont recal any problems. 

I do not take any credit for the subs or the anime. im just a fan who wants to share this piece of art with the rest of the world. 

I hope the torrent wont give anyone problems downloading wise and viewing wise. if there are problems please post them and i will try to solve them. "

,q1u2acker,2011-02-06T08:14Z,@eatmyskills Use VLC from videolan.org. I haven't encountered anything it can't play and it's a small download (20 MB) for what it does.
,Teddikilla,2011-03-23T14:51Z,"I have this on dvd. My mum got it for me for $15, the whole box set lol. I thought it'd be shit since it was 15 bux and my mum only got it cus she knew I loved anime. BUT THIS TURNED OUT TO BE MY FAVE ANIME FOR LIKE 6 MONTHS LOL. Definately recommend it, A really great anime. I'm just getting a digital copy for quick access :]
THANK YOU :D"
,Grog95,2011-05-18T08:34Z,I'm having a problem loading the videos
,satans_joke,2011-05-20T09:15Z,Plz seed... This is a great anime but with only 8 seeders it will take me days to download
,krypking,2011-07-01T23:22Z,episode 11 and up are in japanese
,Nakus,2011-07-03T17:57Z,"@: krypking

I have checked if this was the case. Its dual audio, you need to set it to english if its on japanese. (if you prefer English) 

@: Grog95

If you can't play the video Download VLC or GOM player. Also Download Kazza lite Codec pack. It lets you play pretty much anything.  "
,nelsey98,2011-07-14T07:29Z,how do you select english? i've downloaded half the episodes and started watching but all i can get is japanese. 
,Sankou,2011-07-15T23:23Z,"Sad how few seeds this has. I'll try to seed at 100+ kb/s for as long as I can. Thanks for the upload Nakus, very nice."
,Sortium22,2011-08-09T05:52Z,"All episodes have dual audio, but VLC makes episodes 11+ default to japanese and 1-10 in english. 

A-10
V-10

nicely put together."
,Nakus,2011-08-20T09:55Z,"Sortium22 is correct.

After episode 10 or so it goes to japanese audio as default. Believe you can change that at the audio settings of VLC, setting it to a different channel. "
,RLight,2012-01-10T02:03Z,"to change the audio just right click on the screen, audio, select your prefered dub, and boom.
I thought everyone knew that...."
