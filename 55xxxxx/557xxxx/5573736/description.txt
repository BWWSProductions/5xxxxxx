From wikipedia;
Mike Bassett: England Manager is a 2001 satirical comedy film directed by Steve Barron, following the fortunes of the manager of Division One football club Norwich City, Mike Bassett, who having led his side to the 'Mr Clutch Cup', is appointed England manager.
The film takes the form of a fly-on-the-wall fictional documentary (mockumentary) following Bassett (played by Ricky Tomlinson) as he starts his international management career. Martin Bashir, well known as a journalist and presenter in real life, plays the interviewer and provides the voice-over, and the film features cameo appearance s from PelÃ© and Ronaldo. The film satirises many targets, such as the mysterious figures who run the Football Association, the stereotypical view of an old-fashioned manager, and the tabloid press 's unfailing habit of building the England team up so they can knock them down hard.
Only mentioned once, the film is set at the 2002 World Cup, as it is referred to as 'World Cup XVII', which would be the 17th World Cup which was the tournament in 2002.
The film was followed by a TV series, Mike Bassett: Manager in 2005
