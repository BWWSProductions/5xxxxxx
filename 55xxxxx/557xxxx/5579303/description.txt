Hey, if you've seen the American "The Grudge" and wanted to see the original, this is it !


This was somebody else's torrent, but they had RAR'ed it and also not put whether the subtitles were hardcoded or a text file, so I had to download to find out.


The subtitles are HARDCODED (embedded into the video).


The torrent contains 2 AVI files - the movie is split into two.

Enjoy.
