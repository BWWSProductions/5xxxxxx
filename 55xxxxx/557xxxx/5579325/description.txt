Bombay: Our City


A film by Anand Patwardhan

(1985/Color/75 mins)


BOMBAY: OUR CITY tells the story of the daily battle for survival of the 4 million slum dwellers of Bombay who make up half the city's population. Although they are Bombay's workforce - industrial laborers, construction workers, domestic servants - they are denied city utilities like electricity, sanitation, and water. Many slumdwellers must also face the constant threat of eviction as city authorities carry out campaigns to "beautify" Bombay.

BOMBAY: OUR CITY is an indictment of injustice and misery, and a call to action on he side of the slumdwellers.
