The film starts off with the original rhyme as told by Maleva (Chaplin). It then cuts to Ben Talbot, in the Blackmoor woods armed with a pistol. He is confronted by a werewolf which severely injures him. He flees towards a nearby mausoleum, with the creature in pursuit.

Traveling Shakespearean theatre actor Lawrence Talbot (del Toro) returns to his ancestral home to investigate the whereabouts of his recently missing brother upon request from Ben's fiancÃ©e Gwen Conliffe (Blunt). His distant and eccentric father Sir John Talbot (Hopkins) greets him and reveals that his brother Ben's body was already found in a ditch and surmises he will attend the funeral. Lawrence inquires about the body and goes to see it, where it is stored at the local mortuary: Ben's remains are thoroughly mangled and torn apart.

While investigating his brother's death, Lawrence heads to the nearby gypsy camp, to which Ben was the town's liaison. While there, an unnamed werewolf suddenly rampages through the camp, killing and maiming most of the gypsies. Lawrence gives chase, and is subsequently attacked by the werewolf and bitten on the neck, though the pursuing gypsies manage to scare it off. Lawrence is tended to and taken to his father.
