,FyxYt,2011-10-10T07:14Z,"It's a bit obsolete since his first album came out (Weekend in America, for the uninitiated), and in all honesty, a few good songs of his is as good as all of it. I mean, he's a good composer and great DJ, but Illmerica and Clap are so good that the rest of it kind of bores me. 

As far as the actual torrent goes, I've downloaded the full thing three times, and this time only Hook Shot, Push and Rise, and Heartbreaker, and I've found no problems. Great UL."
