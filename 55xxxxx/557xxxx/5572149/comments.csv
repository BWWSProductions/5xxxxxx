If you have them could you please reseed sets 28-30 and 34-36 which were on TPB a while back. I'm still missing a few pics from these sets and almost a whole set from one of them. These were on TPB under the general heading ""Eufrat - beautiful and sexy"".

The sets are from various sources and I was late in coming upon them.


As well I'm missing several pics from Eufrat and Gina B, a ""***********"" set. If you have it it could help me get a fuller Eufrat collection.

Sorry about the asterisks, but I think I shouldn't name them here.

TIA

I don't remember who the original poster was but if anyone could help, this would be great.

If you still have the sets, just reactivate the seeding of those sets. My client should eventually see them, if you can leave it on for a couple of weeks; I'm sure I'm not the only one missing a few pics, as my client indicates that there are up to 7 or 8 leechers still connected to those sets.

Thanks for your understanding.

And again, a great bug thanks for the set in this torrent."
