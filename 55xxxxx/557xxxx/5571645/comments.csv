,Future13,2010-06-11T18:57Z,Does this work with the expansions? Also what patches is it compatible with?
,viwp88,2010-06-16T00:54Z,"The censor removal works but I can not find out how to get the nude skins to work so someone else will have to give info on that...

As for the censor mod here is how you get it to work...

1. Open ""Sims3 Nude Skins""
2. Extract 1st Nomosaic to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 (yes that is right just put it into the Sims 3 folder where you see the following folders ""Caches"", ""Game"", ""Game Data""...ect)
3. open 1st Nomosaic folder and copy the ""Resource.cfg"" file
4. Paste it into the ""Sims 3"" folder like you did with the ""1st Nomosaic ""
5. All done now play the game

When you open the ""Sims 3"" folder you should see the following folders...
Caches
Game
GameData
1st Nomosaic (unless you only copied the ""mods"" folder over)
Support
Thumbnails
Resource.cfg (only one that is not a folder)

Hope this helps."
,viwp88,2010-06-19T02:06Z,"For some reason the nude skins now work for me...all you do is extract the nude folder into the Mods > Packages folder.

It might not work the first couple of times you play the game but it will at some point."
,naterowe,2010-06-22T04:58Z, i have world adventures installed and the game crashes right before the first gem pops up on the intro this only happens after i copied the resource.cfg file but not until copy it over it runs fine with the mods and packages folder but without the resource.cfg it wont use the skins or the patch help plz

,silencesummer,2011-09-15T05:33Z,"I have all expansions so far, up to Sims 3 Generations, and this patch worked perfectly! Easy to install, just unzip the first rar set of files to the main sims directory, then unzip the next rar to the mods/packages folder you created from the first rar. Thanks!"
