,snowmoh,2010-10-26T16:56Z,you must download a crack and place it in the map
,N1k0Bellic,2010-10-27T19:10Z,"Man, this is some bulls***. 

Everything works up until starting the game!

I install, copy the crack and all that s*** but when I try to run it from the desktop, I get an error!

,karlazzzz,2011-04-25T00:43Z,"Flames_To_Hell

If u wanna get rid of that error then go onto google and type in:
download d3dx9_29.dll
download it.
copy it into the scarface folder and the error should go."
,karlazzzz,2011-04-25T00:44Z,"By the way every1
FUKIN SEED THIS GAME. DONT BOTHER DOWNLOADING IT IF UR NOT GUNNA SEED!!!!!"
,karlazzzz,2011-04-25T09:26Z,"I installed it. placed cracked scarface in the folder. 
NEED THE CD!!!!!
how do i fix this????"
,lavaflav,2011-05-04T00:09Z,"Scarface doesn't run so great on windows vista and 7.  It's because Vivindi (developer) didn't set up the game to be played on current systems, and kind of made everything rely on XP.  

""WHY THE HELL HASN'T IT BEEN FIXED BY NOW!!!"" you may be asking yourself?  Well because the publisher of the game, Sierra,  was bought out by Activison about a year after this came out.   They then shut down the entire Dev team responsible for this game, and oddly enough canceled production of it.  It's really weird when you think about it because this game filled in the wii sandbox niche market perfectly.

Theres no chance of a patch ever coming out for this."
,lavaflav,2011-05-04T00:12Z,"But you can sort of fix it.  If you go into MSCONFIG.EXE you can switch the number of processers from 2 (or 4, depending on whether your running on quad or duo) to 1.  THIS MAY NOT WORK.  I'm running Windows 7, 64 bit, and it didn't work for me.  But apparently it does work on 32 bit systems."
,lavaflav,2011-05-04T00:13Z,"Huh, funny story, I actually went out and baught this game for wii.  It doesn't work.  Good times all around."
,itsstephenho,2011-05-12T03:32Z,when i open the file to play the game it tells me to insert a disk any help...
,Paulo_Redfield,2011-05-31T03:00Z,"The installation is great, everything cool, The movie...then the part where you start at the office very nice...
But when the game starts there's only squares in the screen y'know? this game is bugged.
I'm on Win7 x64"
,El-solo,2011-07-08T19:55Z,It's not a bug....the game isn't compatible with windows 7 nor vista
,maswanto,2011-08-19T06:54Z,i 'll try....
,robertification,2011-09-09T16:08Z,"The game has a multicore problem. Just switch off all but one processor, restart and it works. I have windows 7 64-bit and it worked with me."
,The_Quackhead,2011-09-12T02:03Z,"Works fine, for anyone who may have problems with Windows 7, try running the game in Compatibility Mode. Probably Windows XP SP3. I don't know right now. Let's see. If you don't know how to get there, right click on the .exe -> Properties -> Compatibility."
,madness99999,2011-10-15T03:39Z,"There is nothing wrong with the game or its compatibility with vista or 7, however this game is not compatible with multi-core processors on 7 and vista, mainly with nvidia cards. To fix...
1. Go to the run/search menu and type ""msconfig"" and press enter.
2. Go to the ""boot"" tab
3. Click ""Advanced options...""
4. Check the ""Number of Processors"" box and set it to 1.
5. Restart and play the game

You'll need to remember to switch it back and restart again when your not playing so your computer will run on all cores."
,RaptureMan,2011-10-16T15:57Z,clean download.. works great.. :) no problems or bugs.. just sometimes it fast forwards but i think because i have a dual core processor.. anyways.. best torrent for scarface.. :) +1 for you gablu
