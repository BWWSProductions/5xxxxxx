,countryboy78,2010-05-21T14:39Z,"Icebane your rips are awesome.  I just find with your rips the video at times becomes a little choppy, but not really bad. I haven't had this choppy video issue with lifechanger, secretmyth etc...

It might be a codec isssue.  I'm running Windows XP Professional SP3.  

If it is a codec issue with your rips what codecs should I have installed on my computer?

Thanks!"
[V],Team_xRG,2010-05-22T17:31Z,"quality is improving with every rip
at the moment not like secretmyth but anyway for best performance use kmplayer its good good player ...!
