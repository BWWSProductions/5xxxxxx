Mousepatcher 360

Insomnica released Mousepatcher 360 - a Drag 'n Drop SS/DMI Patcher:

MousePatcher 360 is an application for manually patching Security Sectors into an Xbox 360 ISO file.

Often, the best tool on the market, ABGX360 sometimes can be temperamental in repairing an ISO with SS version 2 sectors, and this program overcomes that.
It also helps those who are looking to inject a SS/DMI combination with a specific CRC. Again, ABGX does not discriminate based on the CRCs of the file.
