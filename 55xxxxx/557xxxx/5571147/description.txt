Nick, is a young Scottish soccer player living in the big city. 
He meets Karen, and the two fall in love and move in together. 
Soon after, Nick exhibits signs of a serious illness. As his 
body slowly succumbs to Multiple Sclerosis, he experiences 
a wide sweep of jagged emotions, and in the process gives 
himself and those who love him the strength to carry on.

The film itself is that sort that the Brits do so well, "a little film" -- character study, working class, interesting without trying to be earthshaking. I suspect that the difficulty of understanding the accents (not just Carlyle's "deepest Glaswegian", but the several other regional accents (notably "Tony"'s Irish) has contributed to the film's obscurity in the States, but it's well worth seeking out.
