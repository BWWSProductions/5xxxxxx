,Kljhg89,2010-10-10T14:34Z,"1) No one cares about your computer

2) My computer is more powerful than yours, it used to be used as a mainframe!

3) A server is more powerful than your ""super computer"", a mainframe is more powerful than a server, and a super computer is more powerful than a mainframe.

Just goes to show how crap your computer really is =) ... Ohhh and i probably have faster broadband (100Mb down and 80Mb up)

Oh, and incase your wondering how i got hold of a mainframe, i own my own company and upon buying a new mainframe i decided to use this as my home computer with a specially designed OS =)"

Seed for comments???? what a tool......GayLord!!!!!!!"
,shasha2333,2010-10-15T03:24Z,"Crack doesn't work, seemingly the only purpose of this torrent is for this nerd to brag about his pc, which by the way in 3 years time, everyone will have one just like it or better, so enjoy it while it lasts jackass"
,scottsasse,2010-11-20T04:24Z,"Just because you have 175.643 albums IN your computer does not mean you have 175,643 REAL albums!! Because you can't include as ""albums"" random sound bytes of Osama and you throwing pots and pans off a building:)"
,TechWizard86,2010-12-03T19:56Z,"I'd like to mention a couple of things, first of which this torrent doesn't work at all. Next off is that you come off as a cocky individual who thinks just because you have a high end PC, which I could easily build a better one, that you are higher than anyone else on here. This torrent needs to be removed. Seriously, if you are going to brag about a PC, go to a computer forum and do it there. Nobody cares about your so called high end computer here. I have no idea how you got those pink crossbones beside your name and really don't care. The bottom line is that you just made yourself look like a douche bag here. It's sad to see someone with crossbones beside their name act so cocky in a place where you are supposed to be helping others by sharing torrents that actually work."
