MUSE's new hit for the Twilight Saga: Eclipse! 
Neutron Star Collision (Love is Forever) in High Quality (320 Kbps) and with the iTunes Store pristine tagging (for you guys who just want to have an organized library like me!).

Whether you like the Twilight Saga or not (like me), you will like this song. It's one of the only songs in which Matt Bellamy reflects the true power of love.



Oh! So you want the lyrics? Awesome! Here you have:

I was searching; you were on a mission, 
Then our hearts combined like a neutron star collision, 
I had nothing left to lose, you took your time to choose 
Then we told each other with no trace or fear that 

Our love would be forever 
And if we die, we die together 
and lie, I said never 
Cause our love, would be forever 

The world is broken, and halos fail to glisten 
We try to make a difference but, no one wants to listen 
Hail the preachers Fake and proud, there doctrines will becloud 
Then theyâ€™ll disappear like snowflakes in an ocean 

Love is forever 
And weâ€™ll die, weâ€™ll die together 
and lie, I said never 
Cause our love, can be forever 

[Guitar Solo] 

Now, Iâ€™ve got nothing left to lose, you take your time to choose, 
I can tell you now without a trace of fear that 

My Love, will be forever 
And well die, well die together 
And lie, I will never 
Cause our love, will be forever

There is also a non-soundtrack version, which will be a B-side for Unnatural Selection, the next Muse single, expected in July/August.
Matt Bellamy explained on BBC Radio 1 that the song was written after he split with his long-term girlfriend at the end of 2009, and was based on his feelings at the beginning of their relationship.
