Since the mid-1990s, the number of sparrows in major cities
- such as London, Bristol, Edinburgh and Dublin - has declined
by about two thirds.

In an attempt to understand the problem, a Zoological Society
laboratory conducts an autopsy on a found sparrow corpse, and
experts from the RSPB and the British Trust for Ornithology
weigh the evidence and discuss various suspects - cats, raptors,
unleaded petrol, mobile phones, garden make-overs & loft conversions.
