The Rolling Stones - Exile On Main Street Deluxe - 2010

Well, there's not much to say about this... the title pretty much says it all.  After hearing the not so good 2009 remaster of Sticky Fingers, I was afraid this might be kind of bad...but it sounds pretty good.  

I was the first to submit this to music data bases so there weren't any matches for the tracks, but the test and copy CRCs all matched.

The discs were ripped to flac using EAC.  Cue, log and covers are included.
