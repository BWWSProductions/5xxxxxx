,canadianice,2010-05-21T04:26Z,how many times can they remaster this? Stick to the original Jap Vinyl.
[T],miona45,2010-05-21T06:15Z,"Sorry folks.  I just noticed there is a slight glitch at the end of track 8 on CD 2.  It's kind of strange because the log didn't indicate any problems.  Anyway, I've uploaded a fix for that track rather than upload the entire CD again.  Many apologies.

Uhm it's just been uploaded today.
Get a grip!"
[V],TheExecutive,2010-05-21T17:53Z,"This remaster has to be good.....Jagger did it himself earlier this year. :)

Also there are 10 new tracks on this ediition, 5 of which were never released songs. The other half are alternate takes.

Thanks for sharing this."
