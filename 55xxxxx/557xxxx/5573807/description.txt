           Orphaned at age 10 when his parents             
           were brutally murdered, every night Alex          
         dreams the same dream: cornered by a man         
           in a wolf's mask, a knife is brought to            
            Alex's throat, and then he wakes. But                
              waking moments confirm his worst fears,            
             and soon Alex is trapped in a tangle of            
            suspicions, lies, and fear. Reality fades        
               into terror as he is left alone to fight          
                 the relentless force that haunts his
                 Deadly Dreams.

                   This is an impressively sharp and good
                 looking Laserdisc for having been released
            in 1988. You could almost mistake this for        
             a DVD source if not for the peculiar wobble         
               and jitter present in this otherwise perfect         
               copy. You may recognize the lead actor,             
              Mitchell Anderson, from Doogie Howser M.D.         
           or Party of Five but you'd probably never          
           admit it! Enjoy this psychological horror,          
              like only the 80s could produce, from your             
               friends in FLAiR.

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
