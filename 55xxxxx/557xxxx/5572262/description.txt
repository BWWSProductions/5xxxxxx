A rip from my good friend Bandit Keith. His comments:

================================

The complete series of Bromwell High, ripped from the DVDs.

I made this rip because the only active torrents of Bromwell High I could find
before were full of staticy TV rips and broken WMVs and I thought people might
enjoy a decent, consistent quality DVD rip of the show.

The episodes are split into two separate parts because, well, that's how they
were done up on the DVDs and I figure it'd make it easier on anyone wanting to
chapter break it (or something) to leave them apart instead of joining them
together during the encoding process, not to mention saving myself alot of time
and hassle on sound sync issues.

The DVDs were ripped using DVD Decrypter. The video was processed through
Avidemux and the audio streams were directly copied from the DVDs. The audio and
video streams were combined together using AVIMux.

As far as the french audio and episode titles go, I'm sorry, but I don't speak a
lick of french - hell, I's don't evin speaks english that all decent - so I
don't know whether or not the french audio track are syncing up right or not.
They appear as if they're syncing, what with voices matching when characters are 
talking, but I don't know for certain. Plus what with it being animated and all.

As far as the episode titles go; I know they're wrong, but I just copied them
(more or less) verbatim from the back of the box. I did try to match them up to
the right episodes as it is painfully obvious they're not listed in the proper
order, but I don't know if I got them all in the correct order. And as far as
the spelling goes; Like I said, verbatim (cept for the all caps.)
