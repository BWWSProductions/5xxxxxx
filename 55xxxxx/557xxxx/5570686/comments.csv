,faanvet,2010-05-22T09:30Z,"MP4 files... ????????????????????
And whats wrong with the common AVI ??"
,Enigma2.0,2010-05-23T10:17Z,"Dont care what type file it is, all 10 parts in one thanks very much. ill prob end up converting them to AVI to put on disk but thanks alot"
,Jabuba,2010-05-24T01:10Z,For some god damned reason episode 10 stopped working 40 minutes in. Restarting and trying Windows Mediaplayer instead of VLC wont do it either. As soon as I go past 40 minutes it freezes and is fucked to cock tat. And none of the loose episodes wont start downloading either. One of those moments where you think the world doesent want you to see the episode. Fuck my life.
,thea_l,2010-05-24T10:24Z,lol
,apsandhu,2010-06-11T16:59Z,Episode 10 freezes after 44 minutes...uploader needs to upload it again separately....A=V=10/10...although some seconds at the start of most episodes seem to be missing but no big deal....for size n quality combo this is the best upload.....Thnx uploader
,Mr_L_,2010-06-15T11:46Z,Loved it! Too bad from the last episode :)
,thea_l,2010-06-17T11:06Z,"Damn good series!!
Nothing wrong about the upload except you will miss the ending of the last episode. Download last episode separately and theres no problem."
