From Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman -- the producing team behind the EmmyÂ® Award-winning and Golden Globe-winning 2001 HBO miniseries Band of Brothers -- comes an epic ten-part miniseries event. THE PACIFIC tracks the intertwined real-life journeys of three U.S. Marines across the vast canvas of the Pacific Theater during World War II. The miniseries follows these men and their fellow Marines from their first battle with the Japanese on Guadalcanal, through the rain forests of Cape Gloucester and the strongholds of Peleliu, across the bloody sands of Iwo Jima and through the horror of Okinawa, and finally to their triumphant but uneasy return home after V-J Day.
