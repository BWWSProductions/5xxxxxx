,Vazamilo,2010-06-22T14:49Z,"It works perfectly! This is the third time I download sims 2, and this is the first time it actually works! Thank You! :D

By the way, for those who cant get it to work:
Extract all files to one folder. Then, open the""no-cd crack.zip"" file and extract everything in it to the main folder. It should run perfectly.

Only problem is that I'm Portuguese, and the only languages available are English and Spanish, but I guess I can make it work."

,aShotOfJack,2010-12-08T04:44Z,"It works great! Thank you much xoxo4free

For all of you leeches,
1. extract everything to a folder on your dektop. 

2. double click autorun.exe in that folder, use the first license key to install, let windows choose the directory.

3. extract no-cd crack.rar to program files/EA GAMES/The Sims 2 Double Deluxe and click ""yes to all"" if a prompt asks you if you want to overwrite files.

4. go to program files/EA GAMES/The Sims 2 Double Deluxe/SP4/TSBin/ and double click on Sims2SP4.exe

5. Enjoy the game!"

,shreditdude,2011-08-06T04:17Z,"Hey, after I downloaded this, I extracted the files within the .rar, only to have no clue on how to install the game. How do I install this on my computer? I've already tried combining all the files, making them into an image (ISO file type), and then mounting the image using DAEMONtools. Help? Thanks!"

,lovemydog,2012-04-04T08:13Z,"Works great! Used these easy instructions from page 1 of comments, didn't have to mount any ISO's, had no problems and the game started right up:

1. extract everything to a folder on your dektop.

2. double click autorun.exe in that folder, use the first license key to install, let windows choose the directory.

3. extract no-cd crack.rar to program files/EA GAMES/The Sims 2 Double Deluxe and click ""yes to all"" if a prompt asks you if you want to overwrite files.

4. go to program files/EA GAMES/The Sims 2 Double Deluxe/SP4/TSBin/ and double click on Sims2SP4.exe

5. Enjoy the game! 

PROTIPS FOR NOOBS:

1. When you are extracting the crack to the EAGAMES/Sims 2 Double Deluxe Folder in Program Files (or Program Files x86) if you get errors or are told that permission is denied to overwrite the files, that means that you will have to change your permissions. Right click Sims 2 Double Deluxe Folder-> Properties-> Security -> edit permissions for admins and/or users, give yourself Full Control permissions.
2. Don't use the launcher to launch the game- use Sims2SP4.exe in the TSBin. You can drag this on to your desktop so you'll have an icon. "
,jpaz790,2012-05-18T06:38Z,you fucks i did everything i was told to do on here. when extracting crack i said yes to all and then it came up with three errors. i said whatever then wen to click on sims2sp4 and it tells me to enter cd. wtf im not a newb ur torrents is just shit. i have windows 7 with all requirements 6gs of ram
