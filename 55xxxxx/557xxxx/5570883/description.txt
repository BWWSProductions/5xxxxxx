"Tracy Flick is running unopposed for this year's high school student election. But school civics teacher Jim McAllister has a different plan. Partly to establish a more democratic election, and partly to satisfy some deep personal anger toward Tracy, Jim talks popular varsity football player Paul Metzler to run for president as well. Chaos ensues." (R.P.Falvey)

  This file is properly indexed, but it won't play in some versions of media Player Classic.  It works in Windows Media Player and VLC.  There are horizontal yellow lines at some parts, but the movie is otherwise watchable. This movie was a bitch to rip and I wasted my whole day to come up with this.
