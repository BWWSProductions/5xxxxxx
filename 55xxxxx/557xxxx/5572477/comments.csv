,dragana77,2010-05-19T18:03Z,"HI-RES movie in 500mb, hmmm.. I'll try and then tell."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-19T23:40Z,high resolution but low quality.  not considered HD.  Is more like a bad DVD upscaling.  At only 500mb it looks viewable though.

,bdlnaredi,2010-10-27T10:34Z,"good quality 
thnx for upload"
,SURLEWEB,2010-11-09T19:02Z,"You cannot call it a HD, high resolution, blue-ray movie...the video quality is just average DVD rip.
It's viewable though - thanks for that. But it is misleading to list it in the ""highres-movie "" section."
