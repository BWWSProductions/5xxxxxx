[b]The Keep[/b] (1983) {Very Rare, unreleased on DVD - [b]Michael Mann[/b].}

[b]Soruce[/b]:LD > DVD > AVI (Megui)

With the exception of his 1979 TV movie debut "The Jericho Mile", "The Keep" is the only Michael Mann movie that has yet to be released on DVD (blame Paramount Pictures!) If you are looking for the definitive  version, you need to obtain the Letterboxed ntsc Laserdisc  edition. (from which this Avi file was ripped. I Have made minor alterations in aspect ratio, but this is about as good as it gets. Your not good going to have the quality of a DVD rip because LD dose have its limitations. But, this is far better than a VHS rip; and the best you'll get till a DVD is released.)

[b]PLOT[/b]: Romania, 1942, a detachment of the German Army is sent to gaurd a mysterious Romanian citadel located on a strategic mountain pass. When soldiers begin to be mysteriously murdered, the SS arrives to deal with what is thought to be partisan activity. What the SS finds, however, is an evil force trapped within the Keep and a force which will do anything in order to escape.

[b]NOTE[/b]: One of the strongest aspects of this undeniably "odd" film is the fantastic soundtrack score composed by German instrumental legends Tangerine Dream.
