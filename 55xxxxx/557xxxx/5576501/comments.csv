,FSmonster,2010-05-21T14:49Z,"Cheers Guy ! I havent seen this since the 80s.

Hopefully we might get a re-master on BR from Criterion."
,myryad,2010-05-21T19:43Z,"One of my favourite films.  I can't believe it hasn't been released on DVD, is that true???  If so, Pirate Bay > copyright holders."
,dave196,2010-05-23T17:26Z,this is not avi.
,myryad,2010-05-24T19:17Z,"Erm yes it is an avi file, with video stream XviD MPEG-4 Visual and audio stream 128Kbps per channel stereo MP3.  However it is different from the MediaInfo output stated in the original post, also it's not a Laserdisc rip as there is a SkyChannel (UK payTV) voiceover during the credits!  Quality is fine.  Only possible confusion is that in this torrent there is a .txt with the same name as the file, which VLC tries and fails to open as a subtitles file."
,dave196,2010-07-04T00:32Z,"thanks for the download,"

,Bronk7069,2010-09-01T06:19Z,"Thanks Byron1799, this is an awesome flick. I first saw it with my uncle in 84 or 85, I was well under age still, but I had a good Ausie brew, Thomas Cooper & Sons Big Barrell. I just dnld'd 100%, in 16m20s w/ only 21seeds, avg 729.3kb/s, which is good for my cable. I will seed heavy on this, setting it high. Thanks again.   Bronk"

,gamecreator7,2011-04-26T08:34Z,"Thanks for the upload. This is a poem I wrote for one of the best movies I have ever seen, and that I found because of your upload (keyword rare). Maybe someone would like to read it real quick.

my poem inspired by The Keep (1983)

You know you have the power, now, your time to be. To chain the evil demon, in the ancient Keep. 

Built away from natures pattern, 
The darkness strives, but cannot blossom. 
We all will die, and reach the satin patterned prize.

If, if we can see a way to kill the demon, 
We would gladly give, our lives just to cease the evil. 
We won't give our lives, to evil scientists. 

If you sailed the sea with us, you would all know too,If you sailed the sea and stood beside me."
,topar22,2011-08-13T23:09Z,Thanks.....It had been about 25 years since I had got to watch this movie....Loved It....
,snairin,2011-08-22T13:56Z,"Hi,

Just downloaded. This works only in VLC Player. 

Regards

,mrwolf71,2012-04-05T06:27Z,"V 6 / A 7 - but not bad under the circumstances...

(and there is a t.v. voice-over on the end credits!)

I only d/l'd the main .avi, and skipped the other 7 files, so I don't know about any .txt files causing problems. It works fine with VLC player, but will not play on MPC or WMP players. It downloaded in only 40 minutes for me... thanks for the upload.

btw - anybody have a copy of 'Thief' (1981) ?
(also By Michael mann)
