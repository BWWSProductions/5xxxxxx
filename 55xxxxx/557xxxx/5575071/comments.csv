,toytoyy,2010-05-24T17:51Z,Why doesn't FXG Team rip the movies to 800MB or 900MB? I think people prefer to download 700MB for making CDs.
,toytoyy,2010-05-24T17:52Z,CORRECTION. Why does FXG Team rip the movies to 800MB or 900MB? I think people prefer to download 700MB for making CDs. 
,LateMan001,2010-05-24T21:41Z,"@toytoyy

Absolutely terrible movie. Do not watch. "
,michaelrwatson,2010-06-02T22:14Z,"@SumAussieCobber: toytoyy is absolutely right. 700MB can be burned to a CD whereas 800 (or even 705) cannot. Yet, there is no appreciable quality improvement by making it 800 instead of 700. Yes, 1.4GB will give slightly better quality, but still barely worth it. Thus for any regular length movie, 700MB is the target. 

Next time don't post dumb comments until you graduate high school. P.S. just for you, i'm going to download and NOT seed."
,yelloo,2010-06-03T12:05Z,Thanks FXG_team.

,Suckka-mothafackka,2010-06-24T22:26Z,"what fuckn movie!!!awesome.

,velcroman0001,2011-02-12T23:40Z,plainz is probably a Corporation flunky with the job of attempting to frighten off up/down loaders.  If he really received that letter why didn't all the other people that comment here make the same claim?
