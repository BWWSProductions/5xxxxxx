I ended up actualy downloading all the seasons and when you watch from Season 1 to Season 6 you find that it is actually a VERY good show.  It isnt as interesting or original any more (i think its thunder started to become less exciting from Season 7 onward).  In the earlier seasons it was the intrigue of the ""oddity"" of the fashion industry and the strange people that inhabit it...they dont do much of that exploration anymore and are now more formulaic....so as it stands it isnt as interesting anymore and i find i tend to skip newer seasons.

Season 1 was shot more like a documentary and showed the girls getting waxed for the first time.  They stopped doing that after season 2.  

It was also always fun to watch the girls get depressed when they traveled abroad to find that the show purposely put them all in terrible habitats to see how they coped with the lifestyle of modeling internationally (e.g. in Japan they'd be forced to live in 5x10 capsules).  They dont do this anymore which is a shame."
