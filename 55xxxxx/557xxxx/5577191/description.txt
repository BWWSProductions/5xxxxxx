Innocence has nowhere to hide

Written and directed by new British writer-director Paul Andrew Williams, London To Brighton is the critically acclaimed urban thriller that has proved to be one of the most important films in recent British film history. Violent, uncompromising and utterly enthralling, the film features an excellent cast, razor sharp dialogue and an edge of your seat, heart pounding climax.
