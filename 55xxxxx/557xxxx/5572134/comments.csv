,blombardo,2011-12-17T15:12Z,download a free program called imgburn - it works great.  be sure to use DVD -r discs (not the +r and not +RW)
,blombardo,2011-12-17T15:14Z,Or better yet - get a windows program = use Wii Backup Manager version 0.3.6 build 48 coded by Fig  (or newer )  it can read any FAT drive - and will auto transform your iso file into a wbfs - then you can use a usb stick or hard drive to play the game - no more disc needed.  (with configurable usb loader on your wii)
