[T],extremezone,2010-05-20T02:09Z,add more connections - i have few seedbox bandwidth problems (still uploading at 900KiB\s until 70-80 GiB) just start downloading and soon some of leechers will finish downloading (connected to 15 - 11 of them are on aprox 90%) enjoy and seed at least 1:1
[V],blaze69,2010-05-20T07:36Z,"Thanks Alot... :)

Very Much Appreciated"
[V],blaze69,2010-05-20T07:43Z,"guys as extremezone has explained In The Past,,,
Open bandwidth settings and Tweak To Connect To More Peers,,,,

In Utorrents Is Options\bandwith

For Example:
I'm Set To 

Global maximum Number Of Connections  >> 15000

Maximum Number Of Peers Per Torrent  >> 14050

Number Of Upload Slots Per Torrents >> ""By Default"" Is (4)

But Only raise Higher if Ur on LAN.. And Not Via Wireless network Card ,, Due To The Amount Of Pressure,, It Disables The Wlan card and Then always Reconnect,, So Leave as Default (4)


Ohh ,,, don't forget To Seed.. "

,whatever89,2010-05-22T20:46Z,"Saw in the theatres. Not a great movie. Some good gore, really predictable ending, great actors with some the most lackluster performances of their careers. No one seems to approach this movie as a labor of love, everyone acts like they really don't care. Shame, I was really looking forward to this. It deserves the reviews it got. I still want to see it again, maybe It'll have a different effect on me the second time. It's not horrible, just .....meh."

if you want to see a good movie with werewolves, go see dog soldiers, not this.

,hecker_slayer,2010-12-29T14:50Z,"video quality and sound 10/10, but storyline damn bored i'll never watch it again better keep my self suicide than watching this movie again and again, i hope Joe Johnston the director of this movie read what ever i wrote down here doing the same exactly do SUICIDE!!"
,mohiergauth,2010-12-31T20:58Z,"All of you who feel the need to shred this movie. All I can say is, Rise of the Lycans? And those wretched vampire/werewolf series of yuppie kids with lycanthropic love triangles? Is that what gets you going? Or maybe Harry Potter? Or the Fockers? Or maybe your anxiously awaiting the 'Friends' movie? DO everyone a favor, and shut your holes.

This film is in no way crap. And you wouldn't know good film if it held you down and shoved your head so far up your colon that you tasted eyebrows. 

Thanks so much for validating my theory of human stupidity. If you have to THINK then, it's not fun eh? NO PLOT? Are you I N S A N E? "
,mohiergauth,2011-01-01T01:54Z,"This is (mostly) true to the original Wolfman with Lon Chaney Jr. With homage to An American Werewolf in London, Picadilly Circus scene. And this particular storyline is far from boring. Don't listen to these cookie cutter 90210 martini heads.
