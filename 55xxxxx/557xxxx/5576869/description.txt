Review:

With a sultry voice and more curves than a coastal highway, Colombian singer Shakira is one of the biggest pop stars of Latin America. In August of 1999, the blessed beauty filmed a live performance for broadcast on the hit MTV acoustic series, UNPLUGGED. At the lovely Grand Ballroom of the Manhattan Center Studios, Shakira performs some of her best loved hits, including "Ciega, Sordomuda." At times, she is accompanied by a full mariachi backing band.
