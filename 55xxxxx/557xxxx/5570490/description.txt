Release notes:

Atlantic recording group Stone Temple Pilots has announced the upcoming release
of their hugely anticipated new album. 'STONE TEMPLE PILOTS' - the Grammy
Award-winning band's first all-new collection in close to a decade - will arrive
in stores and at all online retailers around the globe on May 25th. Produced by
Stone Temple Pilots and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge (Green Day, Dave Matthews Band,
My Chemical Romance), 'STONE TEMPLE PILOTS' sees one of rock's biggest bands
continuing to explore their enduring approach to music - melding big rock riffs,
classic pop hooks, and the restless experimentalism of glam, punk, and
psychedelia. Stone Temple Pilots - Scott Weiland, Dean DeLeo, Robert DeLeo, and
Eric Kretz - will introduce fans to the new album at their first live date of
2010, performing as part of the annual South By Southwest (SXSW) Music Festival
in Austin, Texas. The show - slated for Thursday, March 18th at the famed Austin
Music Hall, and presented by StubHub, the world's largest ticket marketplace -
kicks off an extensive worldwide 2010 schedule for STP, with U.S. dates, radio
festivals, and a European tour slated to follow. A full-scale North American
summer tour will also be announced in the coming weeks.

Enjoy!
