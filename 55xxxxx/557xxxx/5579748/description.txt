Jeremy Messersmith - The Silver City (2008)


Jeremy Messersmith is a pop musician based in Minneapolis,Minnesota.

Jeremy Messersmith was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up in the Tri-Cities area of Washington. He moved to Minneapolis in 1999 to attend North Central University.




Messersmith followed up with his sophomore album, The Silver City, produced by Grammy Award winner Dan Wilson of Semisonic and Trip Shakespeare. The production and sonic landscapes capture an extraordinary range of pop songs ranging from the electronically inspired "Miracles" to love songs like "Love You To Pieces."

Messersmith has toured extensively in support of the album and played with the likes of Kaiser Cartel, Joan As Policewoman, Dan Wilson, Sondre Lerche, The Meat Puppets and Solid Gold. The Silver City was recognized in a press poll as the second-best album in the Twin Cities in 2008, losing out only to the rising star of hip hop act, Atmosphere. Messersmith has been featured on NPR, NPR's Car Talk, World Cafe Live on WXPN, MTV's The Real World, and Delta's Inflight Radio.
