Jefferson in Paris tells the story of the love triangle between Thomas Jefferson, then ambassador for the United States in France, with Sally Hemings - his black slavegirl - and Maria Cosway. The main roles are portrayed by Nick Nolte, Greta Scacchi and Thandie Newton. Among the suporting roles we see Gwyneth Paltrow as Patsy Jefferson, daughter of Thomas Jefferson.

It not only tells a tale of twisted love but also of a country's tragedy. It tells of a Royal House that is doomed to vanish...The King and Queen are hated and laughed at around the country and Marie Antoinette is the aim of revolutionaries. But she is not only despised by the revolutionaries in France but also by the aristocracy and the commoners whose gossip lead to the tragic reputation of the Queen. Thomas Jefferson welcomes the idea of change in France, yet Maria Cosway fears for their French friends and the Royal Family when the revolution brings down the Monarchy.

Filmed at Versailles and other French estates this film does tell a tale of history, the revolution is shown in all its horror up to the point where the Royal Couple is forced to go to Paris and in the midst of all this Thomas Jefferson is in a struggle for the love of two women.

One historical fact is highly dramatised and that is the lenght of Jefferson's stay in France, as he had already left for the United States when the revolution swept away the Monarchy but other than that it is a great costume drama with a great story unfolding before our eyes.
