Downloading now... can't wait."
,echo873,2010-05-19T15:19Z,"Noobs ruin the torrent industry by not fucking seeding except with the 4 kB/s speed.

They don't understand that seeding faster will also allow you to download faster and it will not even slow down your network (if you won't seed like over 80% of your upload speed).

My speed is like 170 kB/s when it could be like 2.1 MB/s (over 10 times more).. just this minor difference."
