,Raz.B,2010-05-22T07:28Z,hello AZKiller7 i just download this and dont know how to make it work pls i need help
,AZkiller7,2010-05-22T11:44Z,"press CONFIG then EMULATION SETTING, a new window will appear, go to PLUGINS, choose the plugins you want to use or you may configure them like configuring your gamepad. make sure you have a PS2 game in ISO image format, in the main program window, press CDVD > ISO SELECTOR > BROWSE and choose you ISO, again in the main window press SYSTEM > BOOT CDVD ( fast of full as you wish )"
,chuchubo,2010-05-27T21:32Z,"So I downloaded this and I can say it is working fair.

So whats the difference between this and the other ones you have uploaded like .
EXE rev. 2956
GSdx rev. 2930

and

.EXE rev. 2888
GSdx rev. 2870

and so on etc? Is this supposed to be the better and latest version making the other ones useless to try?
Im just wondering because Although this version seems to work wonderful on most ps2 games im having a problem with a little slowdown on ff12 "
,chuchubo,2010-05-27T21:33Z,"Oh yah and Thanks, your awsome AZkiller.!"
,AZkiller7,2010-05-27T21:52Z,"each revision contains either enhancements, new features or bug fixes, like tuning the emulation speed up, correcting graphical bugs, sound issues ...., anyway, if you're encountering slowdowns or low fps overall, you can enable and configure SPEED HACKS in CONFIG > EMULATION SETTINGS"
,drel24ph,2010-05-28T04:44Z,"Hi. I hope you can help me. I am new to this PS2 Emulator. When I try starting the program, it gives me saying CDVD plugin failed to open. I tried selecting all the options for the CDVD plugin but non is working. What should I do? Many thanks."
,AZkiller7,2010-05-28T14:27Z,"DO NOT use a CD or a DVD, use an ISO image instead.

,drel24ph,2010-05-29T16:44Z,"Hi again. I have the program almost up and running. But I have another problem. When I load an ISO game, the program seems to be running but all I am getting is a blank screen? How can I resolve this? Thanks. :)"
,drel24ph,2010-05-29T17:00Z,"Hi. Please regard the prior question I had. I am able to make the program work in my computer. However, my logitech rumblepad 2 is not working with it. Can I used this pad with this program? If yes, how can I configure it to work? If not, what gamepad can I use for this? Thanks."
,drel24ph,2010-05-30T01:35Z,"I got the my rumblepad working. :)

When I tried playing games, I have noticed that the FPS is too low and that the games are too slow and the sound is cranky... are there any ways I can resolve this? "
,Four1Fool,2010-06-02T05:27Z,"If you don't know how to use the program, you should head to the PCSX2 website, and definitely check out the forums.  If you're having FPS issues, it is probably a result of either you lacking hardware (too low on processor power / graphics card power), or you have selected the wrong GPU settings for your hardware.  L2read.  Also note, not all games are fully compatible, check the PCSX2 website for compatability of games as well."
,zkush,2010-06-03T02:18Z,"Good DL, but can anyone help me please? I'm trying to play Madden 10 and it's really laggy. Here are my specs.

,xiIix,2010-07-31T04:16Z,"There is no reason why you shouldnt use a CD/DVD. If you have the legit copy on disc, then use it, it works fine. I have a legit copy of Enthusia and it works great with the emulator. The ISO's also work fine. I'm just saying, you can use either one.

Also, I really don't think that any of you are going to get this to run well on a laptop unless it's an i7 laptop, and even then, you can't overclock it, so you're out of luck. This emulator needs a lot of power to run at 100%. I have a Q6600 running at 3.8Ghz and it runs fine, but if I run my machine at stock clocks (2.4Ghz), forget it, it runs slower than dog shit. A T6600 isn't going to cut it. Maybe some SOME games, but not many at all. It would have to be an older game that doesn't tax the PS2 hardware that much. The PCSX2 forums are a great place to go for figuring this out, but just keep in mind that if you don't have a fast machine, then you shouldn't even bother, because this emulator needs fast clocks. Just get a PS2 from gamestop they're $60."
