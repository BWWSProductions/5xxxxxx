As a founding member of Field Music, drummer Peter Brewis wooed indie pop fans with his band's mixture of British guitar pop and Beach Boys harmony. The trio took a hiatus in 2007, prompting the bandmates to pursue their own projects in the interim. While David Brewis formed School of Language, brother Peter took a curveball approach to his own writing, peppering his indie rock epics with strings, piano, left-hand turns, and contributions from a wide cast of musicians (including his partners in Field Music). The songs were then recorded and packaged under the moniker the Week That Was, and a self-titled album appeared in 2008.
