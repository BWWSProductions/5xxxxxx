Deadliest Catch is a documentary television series produced by Original Productions for the Discovery Channel. The series documents the events aboard fishing boats in the Bering Sea during the Alaskan king crab and Opilio crab fishing seasons. The Aleutian Islands port of Dutch Harbor (located in Unalaska, Alaska) is the base of operations for the fishing fleet. The show's name derives from the inherent high risk of injury or death the crews face due to the hazardous work environment and nature of the work itself. Deadliest Catch premiered on the Discovery Channel on April 12, 2005, and runs in over 150 countries. The first season had ten episodes, with the last airing on June 14, 2005. Season two was filmed one year later and began airing on March 28, 2006. Season three began airing April 3, 2007. April 15, 2008, was the fourth season premiere. Season five premiered on April 14, 2009. Season six will premiere on April 13, 2010.
