It seems as though someone has tried to use a Chinese to English translator, and it doesn't really work. Sentences and tenses are all muddled and you can barely make out what is being said (note the included subs .srt file are the same as the film's hard coded ones).

Pity really because the video compression to 350mb is very impressive for the video quality. Credit to the uploader though. Might try and find proper subtitles to go with it."

For people who don't know: 
(1) Unrar subs download with Winrar (compression format).
(2) Replace crap .srt (subs file) with the one you unpacked (put in same folder as movie).
(3) This movie has its own hard-coded subs, so turn them off in the menu of what ever player you use. Then select the new subs (.srt) file in your player (this may be automatic for some players if it's in the same folder as movie). 

Note: If you get two different sets of subs on the movie then you haven't turned off hard-coded subs yet. You'll know which sub is which, one makes sense and the other doesn't.

These are the first subs I found in like 30secs. They seem very good so far.

Peace. "
