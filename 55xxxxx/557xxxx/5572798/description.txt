At Home with the Snails is a somewhat surreal BBC Radio 4 comedy about a British dysfunctional family. 


The story features Alex's obsession with snails, killing them, collecting them, having sexual desires for them and by season two, even attempting to turn into one. The story explored themes of family, sexual preference and aging in a humorous yet thought-provoking style.

The characters are all mentally deranged, but only aware of each others problems not their own.

George is a pompous academic who puts his obscure, pretentious and pointless pontificating above all else including his family. 
He encourages Alex's snail obsession to get material for his books. 

Beverly, his sexually frustrated wife makes "nice things", such as a 200ft tall "family mug tree". In one episode she develops racial dysphoria, and starts painting her face with boot polish, believing that she is a black person trapped in a white body. 

Their daughter Rose has her heart in the wrong place - jammed under her armpit. She runs a confectionery shop selling "chocolate excretions" and "jelly war babies".

The humour is politely and subliminally obscene.
