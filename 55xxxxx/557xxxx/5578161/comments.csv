,martin1841,2010-05-27T12:56Z,"pluto999 thanks for the movies, you r doing great job but i have problem :( i have console connected to my huge tv and i just want to put movies on pendrive and watch it on my console. 
But i cant your movies r in mkv container and xbox cant play these type of file. Xbox can play WMV, mp4, avi.
I tried to extract both streams audio and video and mux them again in yamb to create mp4 file but i cant. Says some crash. I mean i extracted them ok but i cant mux them in mp4. :(
Xbox 360 can play h264 streams up to L4.1
but only in mp4 or avi container.

Any help? 
btw can you just use mp4 container for your movies?

Thanks"
[V],pluto999,2010-05-27T15:07Z,"@martin1841: you can use staxrip and change the container to mp4. I guess you won't have any more problem then. 

Staxrip 1.1.6.7z"
,martin1841,2010-05-27T17:03Z,pluto999 thank you :) but there is no chance that your movies in the future will be more console friendly?
[V],pluto999,2010-05-27T17:57Z,@martin1841: I'm afraid not.. I'll keep in mind about your reuqest though..

,virtueflor,2010-07-08T04:48Z,"Wish subtitles weren't included, but otherwise, decent copy.  A little pixelated from time to time but it might have just been my comp running slow."
