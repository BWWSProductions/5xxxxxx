I got hold of the chinese region 6 anamorphic release, the only anamorphic transfer ever done more's the pity! Apparently it was not transfered using the original studio master, but some other 3rd party copy. However, it's a hell of an improvement over all other dvds and rips out there which are frankly SHIT!

So until Mr Cameron gets round to approving an HD master for release this is all we've got.

This was ripped 'anomorphic strict' to preserve the full resolution of the disc, I've watched on my 44" screen and it really does look much better than region 1 & 2 versions, especially the underwater stuff which looks great.

Sound. This is actually my first rip, but audio should be 5.1 DTS, hopefully has not been downmixed when ripping. **For some reason my copy of VLC will not play the sound track, but seems to play on all other media players (MPC, etc).

i'll seed for 2 or 3 weeks to see if this torrent takes off (I hope so), so please spread the love and seed for as long as possible!
