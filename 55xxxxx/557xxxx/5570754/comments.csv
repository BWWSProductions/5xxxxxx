U'll notice that the first episode - ""Broken"" actually consists of two episodes, although they were aired as one...

yes and its very sad that these poor russians have to explain this every fucking time.

in fact their numbering is more accurate, though not generally used."
,atomicrabbit,2010-05-26T01:14Z,"According to Fox's website, Help Me (this episode) is actually episode 22. Although TV.com says that this episode is #21. I would take fox's word for it. :P

,Sinamax,2010-05-26T17:14Z,"Here seems to be the confusion as to what episode this Ruski is trying upload. First the season opener was 2 hours long so we can say episode 1 and 2 but thats not how FOX marketed it. If you go to FOX's official site and COUNT the episodes to the finale ""Help Me"" you'll see 21 episodes. Done Deal. Stop Bickering You Morons."

,Gabel,2010-05-29T23:47Z,"FUDumbAssRusskie no wonder yer NOT trusted, episode 21 and NOT 22 wich U offcourse knew U ASSHOLE! FUCK OFF and go wank off the BABUSKA U kall honey!"
,mauriciolondoo,2010-05-30T02:32Z,"Episode 22 or 21 whatever!
This episode is:
""Help Me""
After a crane collapse buries a woman (China Shavers) beneath rubble, House must split his time between staying with her and diagnosing the crane operator (Doug Kruse) who passed out. But when she dies despite his best efforts, House must avoid the temptation to relapse on Vicodin ? until Cuddy admits her love for him."
,dstrehl,2010-05-31T00:59Z,Fake... fake... fake... Just download it. This is the chapter 21.
,jumpingphil,2010-06-01T19:51Z,"@Gabel...You clearly can't read can you?
This has already been mentioned in the comments here and this guy IS CORRECT with his numbering but as you can't read, you won't have seen that.
I assume that you don't understand Russian either and if that is true, then why on earth would you be downloading an episode that has been dubbed into Russian.
Oh, I just remembered, you can't read can you, you dumb shit.
You wouldn't have seen that it clearly states that the spoken language is Russian.


@mauriciolondoo...I'm sooooo glad I have seen this episode before I read your comments. It would really have pissed me off to have someone like you tell me what is going to happen before I watched it.
Have some decency and don't spoil things for anyone else in future.


@dstrehl....I can't understand your message. You say it's fake but then you say to download it.
Make up your mind.
I'm also assuming you can't read either as we have already covered the numbering of these episodes.
Oh, and by the way, it isn't fake, it is for real, and it is numbered correctly."
,ansfav,2010-06-05T06:04Z,is this the last episode?

,bmckin,2010-07-29T12:01Z,"You think explaining how combining 2 episodes into 1 does not make it a single episode is tough.  Try explaining to someone over here that you cant wait until the next Top Gear or QI series comes out.

""They are making a new Top Gear show??"" "
