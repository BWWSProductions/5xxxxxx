,turdler,2011-10-27T06:10Z,"Urgh, I wish there was a higher bitrate version on TPB. :(

Found on on KAT, but it has no seeds, so I'll leave that one overnight, while I hopefully get this one to listen to this great music."
,turdler,2011-10-27T06:13Z,"BTW, since I only got one reliable seed (at about 20kb/s on a campus connection) I will seed for a few days, hopefully a few weeks."
,ADDOriN,2012-05-28T19:44Z,"Nice one! I was looking all over for this album. This bands need more fans and more albums. 
It was going to be great if it was 320kbps but its Ok."
