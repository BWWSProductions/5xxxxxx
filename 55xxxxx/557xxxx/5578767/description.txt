Waiting for Armageddon explores the culture of 50 million American Evangelicals who believe that Bible prophecy dictates the future of mankind and that Israel and the Jewish people play pivotal roles in ensuring Christâ€™s return. The film raises questions regarding how this theology shapes U.S.- Middle East relations and how it may even encourage an international holy war.

"If behavior does not make sense to others and this behavior cannot be reasonably explained or verbalized by a person, then it may be seen as a form of abnormal behavior or as signs of a mental disorder. The main aspect of this definition is the belief that all behaviors should in some way be explained through a rational reason for their existence."

However, this documentary shows how mental illness can manifest, and how the people, who looks normal (and educated) can support and apply mass-delusion.

Men can't self-diagnose in case of mental illness. And yes, mental illness is - infective disease. On "special" way.
