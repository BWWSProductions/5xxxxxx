[V],twentyforty,2010-05-21T19:17Z,Congratulations pluto. It is nice to see another pink skull here (it happened five times in past six months).
,lilars26,2010-05-21T21:51Z,"Thanks 20/40.
I'm sure I will find this interesting.
50 million people can't be wrong,right?
Ha,wrong.Or I should say 
""Who the hell knows."""
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-21T22:34Z,"@lilars: Semi-scientific approach (best we can - there is no scientific data) yields an estimate of about 106 billion births since the dawn of the human race. Estimate here is that about 5.8 percent of all people ever born are alive today. 

It would be crowded, right?

BTW, ""rapture"" shit was concept INVENTED from TWO short passages, (one was added later, at will of ""forefathers"" and one is mis-translated, mis-used and mis-interpreted) in 19 century England (Scottish minister Edward Irvingand) and then ""transfered"" from proved idiots like Scofield in land of 13th tribe, sorry, I meant in USA..."

high ranking politicians inthe U.S.Some may someday be in a position to make their prophecies self-fulfilling."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-22T09:50Z,"@lilars: Prophecies ALWAYS are self-fulfilling. Always. It is applied statistic, where one variable is - time. All prophecies from ""good books"" have been fulfilled - several times.

Japanese saying goes: ""If you sit by the river long enough, you will see the body of your enemy float by. """
