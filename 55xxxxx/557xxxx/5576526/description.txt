When working with media files or documents in Mac, you need access to the high performance of your system regardless if the files are located on the Macâ€™s HFS+ formatted volume, or in Windowâ€™s NT File System. Paragon NTFS for MacÂ® OS X 8.0 is the only NTFS driver on the market that provides full read/write access to NTFS with the same high speed as native HFS+ files. The built-in â€œHFS+ for Windowsâ€ completes an effective two-way communication channel between MacÂ® OS X and Windows.
 
NTFS for MacÂ® OS X 8.0 is the first NTFS driver to support Snow Leopard in 32 and 64-bit mode!
