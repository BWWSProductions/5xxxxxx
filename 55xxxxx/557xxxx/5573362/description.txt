This is the add-on for Spell Tomes only for Oblivion for PC. Saw there was a need for it and I just happen to have the stand-alone exe. Just UN-RAR and run exe, tested working. You probably should have the latest patch installed. I believe you also can use this as a stand alone and don't need the other DLC's, but if you do, just search TPB. Is clean of any virii and spyware.

Enjoy bitches.
