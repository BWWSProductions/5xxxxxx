This is just a slimmed-down version of the existing AlterIWNet release, just a bit easier and faster to install and use.  No credit goes to Cv3 for this, only re-releasing it - credit goes to the COL7 Networks team - thanks!

1. Install COD:MW2 via DVD (the SKIDROW version is recommended) or Steam.

2. Find the installation directory (i.e. C:Program Files ... Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 2).

3. Extract the new files to the installation directory.
4. Install the 1.0.0.3 version
5. Run 'Config.exe' from the installation directory and edit your nickname.

6. Run 'iw4mp.exe' by hand or from the shortcut on your Desktop.  Enjoy!
