,shhbz,2010-05-21T12:23Z,please help i did everything as said but cant find any players online to play . help needed
,shhbz,2010-05-21T13:24Z,"when i start the game from sp icon it says to play cooperative player it says IWNET_INVALIDVERSION
 i am using the skidrow dvd please help"
,elementpz,2010-05-21T13:31Z,mrman54 spam once more and will be really badly punished !
,elementpz,2010-05-21T13:31Z,about the single player use Fuzzouts SP Fixer
,shhbz,2010-05-21T19:21Z,problem still persist iwnet_invalidversion when starting cod sp help needed any updated crack link
,mrman54,2010-05-21T23:25Z,yea but if both col7 and alteriwnet are spread its guna split the number of cracked players out there :/ theres already ovr a thousand playing on alteriwnet...
,mrman54,2010-05-21T23:29Z,"@shhbz about ur multiplayer problem, theres not many at the moment on the col7 server at this point. most of them are on the alteriwnet servers (about a thousand). u can either wait 4 more players to get onto col7 which may take a while OR use alteriwnet 4 the meantime. the  link 4 alteriwnet is in the first comment. its the same thing but with more ppl on it ;)"
,TheNightRider,2010-05-22T09:36Z,"Good thing this isn't an AlterIWNet ripoff...

I wonder if reporting it would take effect."
,elementpz,2010-05-22T16:03Z,absolutelly - no .. col7 networks are updating the emu on their own only using the basic alteriw lobby 
,TheNightRider,2010-05-23T04:43Z,So why are you causing fragmentation in the community. Do you think you can run it better than they do?
,elementpz,2010-05-23T08:31Z,I AM NOT RUNING IT I AM MODERATOR IN COL7 NETWORKS AND YES WE CAN RUN IT BETTER .. ON 10 TIMES STRONGER MACHINES WITH 6 TIMES BETTER CONNECTION .. LOL !!! THIS REALLY PISSED ME OFF !
,shhbz,2010-05-23T18:52Z,"man alteriwnet link is not working from 2 days will anybody please come up with an updated link as col 7 still has no players on the server

thanks"
