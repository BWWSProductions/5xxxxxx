,Saki33,2011-10-14T03:54Z,"Thanks for the upload. The quality is good. It is cleaned up well, but the tint does cloud it a little, like looking at it through cataracts. It is not as sharp as another one, but softer."
,Saki33,2011-10-14T04:35Z,@ shemyaza thanks for the VirtualDub tip. Gray filter makes it more watchable. Looks a lot better gray.
,McKiesling,2011-11-09T03:36Z,Incredibly fast torrent
,PiraatBae,2011-11-12T05:33Z,"Thank you for the upload, great quality.

As for those commenting on the tinting, this was how the film was originally released (see: http://www.celtoslavica.de/chiaroscuro/vergleiche/nos.html) and served a specific purpose.  I can understand how one might find it easier to watch by removing the tinting, but I think you are missing part of the atmosphere of the film.

Instead of running it through vdub (or other program) to use a greyscale filter, simply watch in VLC and turn the saturation down.  This way you can retain the film intact in your archive and watch it either way."

,aussietracker,2012-03-15T21:32Z,"all good ,thanks"
,camaysar,2012-04-02T00:23Z,"Thank you for this spectacular version of Nosferatu, the best and most authentic version ever issued. The tinted picture is very clear, and the music, a reconstruction of the original score, composed by Hans Erdmann, and wonderfully performed by the Saarbrucken Radio Symphony Orchestra directed by Berndt Heller, puts all other pathetic music tracks of this film to shame. Great upload!"
