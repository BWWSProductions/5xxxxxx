Info: An unemployed cocaine addict named Dennis (Samberg) goes on drug binge while singing an elaborately choreographed musical-theater number about how it is going to be a great day. The more cocaine he snorts, the faster he sings, and the more disjointed and surreal the song becomes. Eventually the whole experience is revealed to be a vivid hallucination. Jorma Taccone, Alec Baldwin and Tom Petty make cameos.
