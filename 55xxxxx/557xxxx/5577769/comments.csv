,hlime1949,2010-05-26T08:21Z,"Not sure if it's just on my end here, but I try to play a couple of the files with VLC and it says they are broken. They won't play properly in either MPC or WMP either. Tested out all the files and it looks like 4/5, 14, 19, and 21 are the bunk ones. Just gonna download them individually. Wondering if anyone else had similar problems.

Thanks for the upload, regardless of the broken files it's still much appreciated. Perhaps something happened when I downloaded them?"
,hlime1949,2010-05-31T10:49Z,"Yeah, pretty sure I fucked it up somehow while downloading."
,madlibman,2010-06-02T03:49Z,"Yeah, I had no problems and haven't gotten any other complaints.  All the files were checked and watching through by me, so I know they aren't broken. Sorry you had trouble!"

,seedammit,2010-06-06T01:51Z,"why the hell would you not name them properly?

Now the hundreds of people who download it from you will be renaming them one after the other

think of the hours of electricity wasted

think of the environment

thanks for the upload though :-)"
