Complete season 6 of the US version of the Office. Now that the season is over I figure it's time to start seeding it in a bundle! 

There's been a lot of confusion on the numbering of the episodes and what number the season is actually on. I went through and visually confirmed that each episode had the correct episode number as per the official episode list on the office website. 

Every episode number/designation is correct, whereas many of the recent torrents have been 1 number off. This season features 2 hour long episodes that actually are listed as 4&5 and 17&18 which messed up some of the other torrents. 

Now we have a consistent and correct set of episodes that covers the whole of the recently ended 6th season!
