There is an existing Torrent of the complete 'Avatar' soundtrack, but lots of the files are kind of disorganized.  So this was my attempt to organize them precisely as they appeared (a) in the movie, and (b) in the Academy Award sampler from where this looks to have originated.

But!  There are several dozen tracks from that other "Complete Soundtrack" Torrent that are NOT included here.  But if you just want to have all the music from the movie organized chronologically onto your iPod or whatever, I think that this is the way to go.
