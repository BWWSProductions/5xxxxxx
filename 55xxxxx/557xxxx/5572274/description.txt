* Description:

Terrorists, Killers & Middle-East Wackos also known as Terrorists, Killers And Other Wackos 
(UK Banned title) is a shockumentary video from the makers of Bumfights. 

It includes footage of riots, suicides, executions and the televised suicide by 
Budd Dywer, in which he shot himself through the mouth. The video is highly graphic 
and much better edited than the infamous Traces of Death and the fake Faces Of Death. 
All the scenes in Terrorists, Killers And Middle-East Wackos are real scenes of death 
and suffering, unlike Faces of Death, most of which had been faked and staged. 

The video  was released in the US on the 21st June 2005, by Bumfights. It was due to 
be released in the UK but was refused a certificate by the BBFC. The BBFC found that the film

"comprises a compilation of uncontextualised clips showing real killings, executions, 
suicides, accidents, mutilation and torture (of both humans and animals) and other 
distressing images. The work presents no journalistic, educational or other justifying 
context for the images shown. Rather, the work presents a barrage of sensationalist clips, for 
what appears to be the underlying purpose of providing prurient entertainment."

and that it "invites the viewer to take sadistic pleasure in death" and therefore was not 
suitable for its release in the UK. They also raised concerns that the film may violate 
the Obsence Publications Act. [1]

Terrorists, Killers And Middle-East Wackos also features music from, Happy Campers, 
www.happycampers.org tracks include "Wave the Flags". The video is not a serious documentary 
and its only purpose is to exploit the scenes shown.
