,Cpt.Howdey,2011-11-13T18:44Z,tracks are not separated. one long track. any way to correct this?
,Garler,2012-02-04T01:38Z,"Cpt.Howdey: It's not one big track, it's an image file, split using medieval cue or anything like that"
,keryneia,2012-05-23T02:40Z,Thanks for the tip Garler! cue files are fucking worthless for most people.
