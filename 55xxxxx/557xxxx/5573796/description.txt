           Duncan is a genius straight A student,          
           Blade is juvenile delinquent. But because         
         of a mix up with their school records,           
           everyone thinks each is the other one.             
            Now, Duncan kind of likes the attention              
              from being thought of as a real bad dude,          
             if only the school bully would stop trying         
            to rough him up. And Blade definitely            
               likes being thought of as important               
                 instead of as trouble, if only the teacher
                 would stop hitting on him for a date.

                   The year was 1992 and Kid 'n Play, with
            three records and two House Party films           
             already under their belt, were at the height        
               of their fame. Today we're delighted to              
               bring you the only film they made outside           
              of the House Party trilogy, Class Act.             
           But that's not all, you'll be enjoying this        
           and the greatest hi-top fade in film

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
