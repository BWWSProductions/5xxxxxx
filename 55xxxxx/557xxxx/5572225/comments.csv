Ultimate would mean ALL Rosetta languages available and all levels.

Thanks for you share but Ultimate, not a good choice of title. ;)

Also what is the version of Rosetta program you included?"
,sigmareborn,2010-05-19T20:34Z,"Honestly enough i have no idea, i bought this DVD when i was overseas from an iraqi and happened to make a digital copy. figured id upload it, i bought it back in 07. i labeled it ""ultimate"" because it has more languages then some of the top seeded packs, at a fraction of the size (i understand that level 3 has video hence the size difference).

TBH i wasnt expecting so many people to download this so rapidly  if you look at my other torrents ive uploaded they have all had a slower start. but here just for you"
,sigmareborn,2010-05-19T20:38Z,enjoy the name change :P
,xxx-yyy-zzz,2010-05-20T12:50Z,It is RS2 not 3!!!
,sigmareborn,2010-05-20T22:21Z,ok i get it that this may the best torrent out there but really? to go from 36 seeders to 7? guess people need to get more of a community spirit...
,MystereMan,2010-05-21T07:11Z,"Actually, no.  This is a very old version of Rosetta Stone.  The current version (3.x) is 10x better, which makes this version all but obsolete."
,sigmareborn,2010-05-21T07:37Z,ok? my point is either way if this version is so obsolete then dont download it... but if you do download it seed... (hence the community spirit part..) wouldnt expect someone with no uploads to understand that...
