The fan made extended cut. Information:

Original film name 		Waterworld
Film studio name 		Universal
Film release date 		1995
Original runtime 		176 minutes (Extended Edition)
Fanedit release date 		March 2010
New runtime 			177 minutes
Amount of time cut/added	1 minute added

INTENTION:
I was so pissed off when I found out that the Extended Edition which I believed to be the â€œUltimate Editionâ€ of Waterworld was a censored, softened edit for TV. Universal wasnâ€™t able to release a proper version on DVD so I thought I had to do it on my own.

EDITING DETAILS:
A â€œnever give up attitudeâ€ and a lot of support from CÃ©dric.
