,tofusoldier,2010-06-10T20:59Z,"I heard somone saying that something along these lines has recently been released.

http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/waterworld.html

Though, the version on that link is called the ""extended version"" which is what I think you were saying was the shortened made-for-tv version.

I'm just curious which rip and also which commercially available versions are the most complete/best currently available, in your opinion.  It's awful when directors are kicked out of the editing process just because of a few lousy reviews.  I still think this was one of the best mainstream post-apocalyptic movies of all time.  It did something new and different we hadn't seen before.

I really appreciate your work restoring this scene by scene from the various versions, and commend you for your effort on keeping this movie alive.  It's one of my favourite films, and it's nice to see there's an effort to keep it alive."
[T],PeteSapai,2010-06-11T15:42Z,"First, to be clear: this Ulysses Cut is not my release (neither editing nor encoding), I only posted and seeded it. All (editing) credit goes to Zaaacharias (whoever that may be ;) - see http://fanedit.org/9004/).

That said, as stated in the info ""the Extended Edition [...] was a censored, softened edit for TV"". The Ulysses Cut follows the exact same storyline, but Zaaacharias ""reintegrated all the cut out violence, nudity and profanity"" (the Mariner peeing, people cursing, Helen's naked behind, etc.) using the original DVD (and other sources) and added some small other changes.

So, in short: the Ulysses cut is what the extended edition should have been."

,ShinobiWolf,2011-09-02T10:36Z,"Wow.. I gotta admit, this version is awesome. The picture quality is decent, the deleted scenes are great to watch and make for a more fulfilling experience, and the file size is pretty nice too - fits perfectly on a dvd. Thanks for uploading! "
,kykyred,2012-02-24T22:12Z,"Thank you, and who says pirating is bad... you cant actually buy this haha.. 

Thanks though great quality my dad loved the tv version and he was pointing out the differences between the tv version and this version,
