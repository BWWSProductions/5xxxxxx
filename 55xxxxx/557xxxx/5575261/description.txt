Ok I brought this for Â£1.49 from a discount bookshop, I was drunk at the time and decided the blurb on the back sounded funny. on a crowded bus, three people sit patiently waiting for their stops, unaware that they are about to have extraordinary experiences. Thats all the info the box had with a pretty lame monster on the front.

The film is classed as a 18, yes a 18 why??? Its not scary its not good but its very funny when one bloke opens his fridge to find his rotten food has turned into a person, who is aroused by porn, another bloke has a car talk to him just cause the car wants a owner who wants a understanding driver, chucks him out on the highway and then picks up a woman driver. Also a woman who has a date from hell. Ok it may be a crap film but don't worry about the plot, story and just enjoy is pretty dumb acting, some parts are pretty funny, so if you see it on budget just give it a go.
