Notes::::::::::::::::::
well....thier is many release with the spanish CAM out their already, so we decide to do a version with
the russian source, as a few people prefer this over that, vice versa...anyway source as a strobing effect
and small angle mid way through, just changed a few colors, lowered saturation down a touch, added video
denoise and sharpness..overall it's watchable, but not great enjoy //prism
