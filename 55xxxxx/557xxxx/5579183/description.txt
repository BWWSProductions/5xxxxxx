Four of my latest works in music, one of them contains horrible vocoded vocals i see fit to plague the world with so listen up and be sure to read the two text files accompanying the download.

Just to do a short recap tho, all of this is my own production so it is free and no copyright is broken downloading this, so hey!, you would be doing an indie producer a favor listening this stuff. And link to this torrent next time someone craps for torrents being useless and only for pirates, link to me and other like me who use torrents for sharing OUR creations with the world.

Peace out!
Count Chris
