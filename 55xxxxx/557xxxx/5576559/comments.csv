,anub3005,2010-05-21T02:21Z,"hi guys, i would like a little help.
for old and healthy torrents i get avg. downloading speed of about 160kb/s, but for new torrents it comes down to about 60-70kb/s.
does any one have a solution, i have vuze 4.4 and windows 7"
,bychance,2010-05-21T02:57Z,"anub3005, at the moment there are 6 seeders sharing to 931 leechers, that doesn't leave
 much to share. Wait until there are more seeders than leechers and it will be faster to download. "
,anub3005,2010-05-21T03:21Z,"bychance i wasn't referring to this torrent, i meant  all recent torrents"
