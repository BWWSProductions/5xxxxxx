,Thootje,2011-08-05T20:47Z,Has a worm in it. Don't download.
,tflagger997,2012-05-12T06:03Z,"There is no worm detected with latest AVAST (May 2012).  There are EXE files, but you just use 7zip to decompress the ISO like a regular archive and then just run the movie files directly anyway.

There are two copies of each movie file AVI and MOV and the AVI are large with no improvement to the quality, so the AVIs are just bloat.

Worse than that, these are just free tutorials labeled as a DVD.  The video quality is good, but the audio ranges from acceptable to bad.

I have no idea why there is a Gnomon tag as they had nothing to do with these."
,tflagger997,2012-05-12T18:14Z,"Came back to apologize.  Apparently this IS a retail release.  Of course they have NO REFUND stamped on the purchase page, due to the low quality audio.

Sorry MOZierra for saying that they were free.  At this quality they should be, and I guess they are thanks to you!"
