        Location, Location, Location returns for a brand new series, 
        and Phil and Kirstie really have got their work cut out for  
        them. With nervous sellers and demand for housing            
        outstripping supply, buyers are battling one of the most     
        difficult housing markets for a generation. Luckily our      
        dynamic duo are on the scene to show the way, and make       
        property dreams come true for househunters across the        
        country. This time Kirstie and Phil are in the north west.   
        Richard and Helen Francis have been living the city centre   
        lifestyle in Manchester. But now they've only got three      
        months until bump becomes baby. They've got 400K for a move  
        to the suburbs, but with a search area that covers only      
        around 200 streets. In Preston, Graham and Nina Walker are   
        looking to swap their tiny rented terrace for their first    
        marital home. Nina wants a fast move, but Graham isa bit     
        nervous.
