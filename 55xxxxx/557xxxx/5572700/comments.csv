,captnfloyd,2010-05-23T01:46Z,"Thank you for all your help this season, I'm currently living in Costa Rica and do to the blackout of abc streaming in this country you have been my only reliable way of watching lost. your the best. If anyone has any problem watching anything, I found a nice codec on znet that allows ""microsoft media player"" to watch 99% of all codecs works great for me.  check it out here http://downloads.zdnet.com/abstract.aspx?docid=1625341&promo=100200"
