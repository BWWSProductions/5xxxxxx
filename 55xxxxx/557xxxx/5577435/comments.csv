,blackjack3864,2010-05-21T17:31Z,"Thank you !!!!!

Request :
 Is there any chance of uploading Moto GP 09 ????"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-21T17:45Z,"Notes on the comments :

To subzero : just stop putting comments in my files and it is ok .

To  h3x0r_c0d3 : 1 gb ram because the 2 gb ram can be problematic for 2 gb ram computer owners .

To  blackjack3864 : sorry but don´t because i need to concentrate my not too much available time in the newest nice pc games and i think that is understandable and if you search a little bit maybe you find the game you mention in a torrent or in a sharing service that you can use , good luck in your search but don´t forget to play this one !"

hy there ... nevermind that kid Subzero! he's just jealous .

besides i could be your father,  iam much impressed about your uploads and contribution so far!. just wouw!... phew....

globe: ya know IAM stopping ONLY when you 
dont dupe our stuff, you dupe ours, we do dupe yours(split).

usually when we see sir globe was faster , we only release the game on our site for our USERS ONLY. 
you see other versions, and you fukking keep upload yours including false info's on ""what has been removed/downsampled"" Thanks for putting this
info to your latest release!. atleast!. but i dont get it why fukking dont you upload it to your site only?, when you see another one was earlier, is that because you need to spread your mega... rapid... oneClickShit links to get as much as possible downloading from there , cause thats bringing you the money eh? , each download=cents=manydownloads=manyCents, thats what you are after all, nothing else in my opinion

i really would like to see you doing REAL DIRECT PLAY releases, in my eyes you didnt got the meaning of direct play. (unrar and play!), not unArc, and then using any converter.exe, this is in NO WAY direct play. 
ya know ToeD released the Very first direct.play games, so you know sure what direct.play means. with the above stuff, if that would be changed, i would gladly accept you and also would invite you to our site, but as long as there is no change, i keep moaning. besure!. if you want i can get that text translated for you from one of our nice portuguese users.(even them , cant understand your behaviours!).

note to all others, not involved.

>> stfu > dont get involved to things you have no slightiest clue about! > thanx  aloooot! ill give a flying fuck about your opinion, or whatcha think about that all."
[V],Subzero!,2010-05-22T02:42Z,"read this twice paulo, as this is the very last offer from us to make peace with you!. if you dont, iam ready ya know!.

note to my personal h8ers (you know who you are!) >ill give a flying fuck about your opinion, or whatcha think about that all."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-22T07:51Z,"To subzero : JUST BUS OFF OF MY COMMENTS ONCE FOR ALL , STOP FOULING ME AROUND WITH BULLSHIT THAT DON´T TAKES ANYWHERE , I DO MY WORK IN A CORRECT WAY AND MANY TIMES MY FILES ARE REQUESTS FROM USERS , IF I DON´T DO THE WORK THEY STILL REQUESTING , THE PLURALISM IN GETTING FILES IS A RIGHT THAT THE USERS HAVE , WHEN YOU GO TO BUY SOMETHING FOR EXAMPLE , YOU LIKE TO A HAVE A FEW VALID OPTIONS TO BUY WHAT YOU WANT , MAYBE WITH DIFFERENT STYLES AND PRICES , SO THE USERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE MORE OPTIONS IF IT THE CASE , I DON´T HAVE ANY CONTRACT WITH SOMEONE , I DO MY WORK WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE , THE OTHERS DO THEIR WORK IF THEY WANT AND THAT´S IT , YOU NEVER SAW ME GOING TO THE COMMENTS OF YOUR FILES SAYING ANYTHING , EACH ONE DO THEIR OWN JOB AND THE USERS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THEY WANT TO USE , IT IS WHAT IS CORRECT IN TORRENTS FILES WORK ."
[V],Subzero!,2010-05-22T14:30Z,"alrite, mr. capslock, it was just an offer, too bad you're not clever enuff to take it, and hell yeah...

I KEEP MOANING UNDER YOUR TORRENTS

WHY THE USERS CAN´T HAVE MORE OPTIONS AS POSSIBLE IF THAT HAPPEN AND CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES , WHY MUST JUST ONE FILE FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK AVAILABLE ? THIS IS THE TYPE OF QUESTIONS THAT I DON´T REALLY HAVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER ... BUT FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK MUST BE A MONOPOLIST WAY IN THE POSSIBILITIES TO THE POSSIBLE USERS ?

[V],globeplus,2010-05-23T20:58Z,"To aerofxrnu : as far as concerne me , you are more than welcome to get my files if you want in your own good wish and i certainly appreciate users with correct observations to my blog or forum , if you want , you are welcome in there too for wherever you want , talk about games , putting circunstancial problems , suggesting new files , wherever you want as pc games user , i respect all the users more as possible and that is why i try to do always the best competent work in what i do . thank you for your interpelation showing that is a kind of bad behaviour here on this uploading group guys , no one never saw me trying to perturbate somehow the work of this guys , they simply think that because they are a group they enough guys to be borring the others uploaders , the users have the right to choose for their minds , not because they get bullshit influence to condicionate the users choices . thank you ."
[V],Subzero!,2010-05-23T23:31Z,"lol... now we are having 2 peeps who drink n surf, well as i said i give a fuck about what freako's like that aero thing is saying. i dont care, get that!.
but hey, back to globe, me just like seeing you falled in love with him, there is nothing what can beat a gay'sh friendship... atleast blobe would like that!, and as i can see, you would too!.

about skull, looks like you are having wrong information bonehead, skull left because of something else (you dont need to know about).
Once again you proved your noobish and dont know about anything!. so you'll better shut up!.
and as long as i have fun and iam in the mood you can be sure that iam moaning around, especially at those ""fakey"" direct play loosars!.

[V],globeplus,2010-05-24T01:25Z,"To elxori : the ammount of space the program is talking is the ram , it is necessary close 1 gb ram to make the extraction , if you get problems doing the extraction of the arc file you and you have that ram in the computer you have 2 possible solutions :

1 - restart the computer before making the extraction to evitate background applications to interfere with the extraction

2 - reeinstall the freearc , in case of for some reason something beeing causing an exception anomaly to the extraction 

If you have close 1 gb ram the extraction is possible , no doubt ."

[V],globeplus,2010-05-25T00:16Z,"extract the arc file with the freeware FREEARC then put the extracted folder in the desktop then run the executable of the game , then you have arcade competitions , simulation competitions and multiplayer that is include but like the generality of the games avalable in the torrents more tough to use , then you choose arcade or simulation and the type of competition , bikes , you certainly take a look at the controls too then you start to play in the event that you choose .
