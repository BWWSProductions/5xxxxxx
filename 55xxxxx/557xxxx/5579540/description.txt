Occupation: Millworker

(Anand Patwardhan/1996/Colour/22 mins)


Textile mills were once the backbone of Bombay's economy and provided the city its working class culture. Today, foreign investment and rising real-estate prices have made selling mill lands more profitable than running mills.
Mill 'sickness' is now an epidemic.

OCCUPATION: MILLWORKER records the inspirational action of workers who, after a four-year lockout, forcibly occupied The New Great Eastern Mill.
