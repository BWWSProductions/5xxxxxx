Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Limited Edition (c) Electronic Arts  


  Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to
  the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected
  "Battlefield moments." New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter
  allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield. With the
  Frostbite-enabled Destruction 2.0 system, you can take down entire buildings
  and create your own fire points by blasting holes through cover. You can also
  compete in four-player teams in two squad-only game modes, fighting together
  to unlock exclusive awards and achievements. Battles are set across expansive
  maps, each with a different tactical focus. The game also sees the return of
  the B Company squad in a more mature single-player campaign.
