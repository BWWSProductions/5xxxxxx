(kidding) You can guess who."

,TKOG13,2010-05-21T22:28Z,is [micro] the new [quark]?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-21T22:46Z,"@TKOG13: As I said two days ago - nope, it's oldest thing. Very old. Today I've seen how somebody has done mp4, black-bars on top and bottom, using (not joking) ""unnatural"" XviD (this can be played on about 5% of the playback-systems), huge (695MB) and it was reason enough for me to encode this and show how XviD CAN be one half of the mp4... (if people know how)."

Cheers

,Zionfreak,2010-06-21T06:21Z,There is a directors cut of this but by the news I am assuming this is not it because it wasn't leaked online till June 12th.
