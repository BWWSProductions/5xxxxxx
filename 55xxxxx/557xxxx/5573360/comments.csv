,sonews,2010-05-20T04:14Z,Steam is only 32kbs so bumping the encode up to 64 kbs will do nothing but increase the file size.
,sonews,2010-05-20T04:14Z,Steam = Stream

PLEASE. please download this free little app. You can merge the three files into one yourself. It's VERY easy to use. Just drag the three files into the app then choose a name and location for the output mp3 in ""Output filename"", then click ""Merge files"". That's it...now you have your one mp3 file. The whole process takes ""LITERALLY"" less than 5 seconds.

btw, 32 kbps from sonews isn't bad at all.  32kbps is sufficient & can sound pretty good when ripped correctly. Especially for an AM talk radio. ."
,sonews,2010-05-20T04:22Z,"Or use this freeware program.

Just tested Meda Joiner...Not bad, but program seems bit large (over 3 MB) for a simple operation. MP3merger is only 612 KB and its merging process is a lot faster. 

Try mp3DirectCut...its better than both.

It's fast like mp3merger but can also split as well + other features. mp3directcut is more of an editor rather than just a merger.  Reason I suggested mp3merger earlier was for its simplicity."
[T],480v,2010-05-20T06:22Z,"@ TheExecutive, here's the comment I left for you on the lonefunman upload...just wanted to make sure you read it.

I really don't like the demanding tone of some of your comments lately. lonefunman has been nothing but generous to upload RR EVERYDAY for over a month. He was NEVER obligated, but did anyway because as a fan of the show, he wanted to share it with likeminded people. He went through the trouble of editing out the commercials for you. Obviously you've never done this or else you'd show a little more appreciation. He even provided meg4upl0ad links when he wasn't able to upload them here to make sure you still got the show. And he NEVER missed a day. You have NO right to demand shit. 

If he never uploads again, its because of you. Here's some advice...If his uploads aren't up to your satisfaction then do us all a favor and DON'T download them & just rip them yourself for yourself. We'll all be happier for it. Geez no wonder we haven't heard from him today. I'm just now reading your comment. Unbelievable how fucking rude you are."

[V],TheExecutive,2010-05-21T06:38Z,"480V .... I haven't been rude or demanding, and you're the one using profanity here.  :)

I asked nicely and said PLEASE. How is that demanding? Seriously...."
[V],TheExecutive,2010-05-21T06:39Z,"Sonews:   Mp3 Merger is for PC.  I have a Macintosh, so that won't work.  If you know of a Mac version I'd appreciate it."
[T],480v,2010-05-22T13:18Z,"@ TheExecutive

In your comment, you posted, ""Too bad Lonefunman doesn't always read these comments."" But I thought you posted, ""Too bad Lonefunman doesn't read these comments."". In which I felt was an unfair dig just because you didn't get what you want especially considering the guy was uploading two versions specifically to accommodate your preference. I mean who does this? Also using a little more tact when asking instead of stating, ""64K only"" would probably get better response, but I doubt it. Not everyone is like lonefunman. But anyway, perhaps I misread & therefore misinterpreted your comment & overreacted a bit. Looking back, I really shouldn't have said anything at all...Better to just keep your mouth shut & mind your own business. Because its really a non issue. "
[V],TheExecutive,2010-05-22T16:29Z,"Hi, 480v


Well, it's kind of easy to keep one's mouth shut when one is TYPING.  But in any case I accept your apology.

Don't worry so much about it.   3 files is fine.  One of them -- either Lonefunman or Sonews actually did make it into one file....but for whatever reason was inconvenient for them so they went back to three.

I saw your long response in my TV show torrent (are you a fan of The Virginian too?) about Audacity.

I appreciate your help there, however I had a copy of Audacity for Mac and as you said there is no way to join files.  It's one of the most complicated software programs I've ever seen. 

3 files are just fine.  

Maybe we should both keep our hands shut from now on.  ;)"
