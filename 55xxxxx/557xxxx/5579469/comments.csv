,vinnylima,2011-03-11T22:44Z,"Works perfectly on my 4.1U console w/ Wiikey 2 (running through Disc Channel). Thx a lot!

The size of the torrent is due to compressing. Once you extract the ISO of the rar file, you'll see the image has the regular size."

,i4gotmy_sn,2011-08-11T01:02Z,"@TweakedEh
Stupid question: After I'm done DL'ing this, is it meant to be burned slowly onto a DVD or do I have to have a modded Wii?"
,TweakedEh,2011-09-25T05:53Z,"@i4gotmy_sn

You need to have a modified Wii.

@wad11656
You do not have to mount it, you can just add it to your hard drive. You only have to burn if you have an older wii that will read it."
,na_tra,2011-11-18T09:53Z,"Hi all:

Does any one knows why WBFS 3.0 does not recognize this file at all?  It's rar file after downloaded.  I extract it which automatically became iso file but WBFS does not see it.

TIA"
,shkrulez,2011-11-22T16:14Z,"hey i seem to be having the same problem as @MorphzreaZ if any ones how t fix that pls tell me.

(it starts and everything.. but it asks me to plug in my nun chuk,im playing on pc,using dolphin.. what should i do.. any advice? )"
,deamonicus,2011-12-26T08:01Z,"@na_tra
i used backup manager for this file"
,PS3Vortex,2011-12-28T19:19Z,There are 12 rar archives becasue once you download them fully you need to use a program called Winrar to extract them to a location of your choice. Just extract the first rar file you see and it will automatically extract all the rar files in that same folder to create a wii game(: hoped that helped!
,ice_bat,2011-12-30T00:41Z,"great torrent, great game

,MrSan.,2012-06-05T18:15Z,I have a copy of this game and the disc doesn't works on my 4.0U Wii. But I don't know if the files are exactly the same of this torrent.
