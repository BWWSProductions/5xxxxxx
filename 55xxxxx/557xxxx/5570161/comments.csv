There is no easy way to extract the subtitles from a dvd. you will need patience and will.
to do this you will need the program ""subrip"" that allows you to do it.
 download from:
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Subrip 
you can use this guides:
http://www.doom9.org/index.html?/subrip.htm
http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/rip_subtitles_with_subrip.cfm
it's not to much complicated but takes time.
and if you passed all of this then let me know...
good luck"
