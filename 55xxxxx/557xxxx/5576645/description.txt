Audio Book of Carroll Quigley's 1966 Master Work: Tragedy and Hope. This is one of the Books you find at the End of the Rabbit hole. Please seed as much as posible, this is a great manual for winning the hearts and minds of your fellow humans.

Created using Alex (Apple Voice Synth). So... it's as good as I could make it. Works well with the 2x setting on your iPhone/iPod.

Take Care, One Love
