,nycrea,2011-04-24T22:23Z,26th episode included. That Ep is a DVD special. 
,Sleppmegin,2011-07-22T14:19Z,"This seems like a good upload I must say, Dual audio always the best, good size on the episodes.
Good supply of information :)

Haven't downloaded this yet, but it seems I prob will, rather than lots of the crap upped on the bay by others. I will come back and comment as to the quality and all after I've checked it out myself. If I remember to do it."
,Sleppmegin,2011-07-22T14:21Z,"Oh forgot to ask: Why is it that some times in the files overview the episodes are not in the right order ? Like it is with this.

I've seen torrents of exactly the same content only with this minor difference and always wondered why...?"
,Sleppmegin,2011-08-04T07:56Z,btw you don't suppose I could get this through usenet ?
