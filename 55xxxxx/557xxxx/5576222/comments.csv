@sinner77: I just loaded my 
Whiteout.DVDRip.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4.

BTW, somebody asked for same last week. I kept torrent loaded for two days - but for nothing (even if I promised 12 hours).

So, you have 12 hours. ""

Either stop asking OR get proper and new torrent program. This way, you'll be stuck - forever.

Another ""deadline"" passed and it cannot go forever like you have imagined. However, I still have Whiteout on seeding..."
