[V],poppedtart,2010-05-22T18:26Z,looks good to me.  i have had my fill of these muted colors movies though.
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-22T22:20Z,"Compared to ""The Road"", this movie is like ""The Wizard of Oz"" when it comes to vibrant colors.

Although, compared to most movies, this film is pretty bland colorfully speaking.  There are only a few post apocalyptic films where the colors aren't muted ... for some reason, the two I can think of off the top of my head are both Kevin Costner films -- Waterworld & The Postman ... both were also fairly unsuccessful films too :D"
