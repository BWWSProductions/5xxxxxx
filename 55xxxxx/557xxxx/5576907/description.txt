Wow, it's been a long week.  I'd planned on making the three Lord of the Rings films my next up (from the recent Blu-Ray release), but I figured this would be more in demand for now.  Personally, this film surprised me a lot, because I figured that the book Eli was carrying was a copy of the Bible before I even saw it in the theater, but I didn't figure out why the book had survived the purge-burnings that are spoken of until the final reveal.  I was also surprised that the film makers were actually able to make this cold-blooded killer a sort of sainthood-worthy character at the same time because while he kills ruthlessly, he only does so in defense of himself and the book.

Overall, the film is not for everyone, some people find post-apocalyptic tales a real downer.  In fact, if you're looking for a truly depressing film, watch "The Road" ... I've yet to talk to anyone who can tell me the redeaming value of that film, or the book.  Honestly, I watched the film hoping they somehow made the book's story a bit more sadly inspiring or something, but instead they just transcribed it onto the screen and depressed everyone.

However, this film, is both full of great action and inspiring.  Plus Mila Kunis is almost as cool of a bad-ass as Denzel is.  Unfortunately, they couldn't find someone better than Gary Oldman ... mostly because when it comes to a crazy villain, no one better exists!

I hope you enjoy this as much as I did!

Trivia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Because of scheduling conflicts, Kristin Stewart turned down the role which Mila Kunis plays.  Now everyone can thank their respective god because Kristin Stewart is a talented actress and can play the girl next door, a bad-ass rock star, and a number of other roles ... but a bad-ass killer ... who knows, but probably not.
2.  Denzel trained under one of Bruce Lee's protÃ©gÃ©s, Dan Inosanto, prior to the film and then to the astonishment of the cast and crew, performed all his own hand-to-hand fighting stunts.
3.  When Eli is imprisoned in his "cell", there is a poster on the wall for the 1975 film "Boy and His Dog," which is also a post-apocalyptic film.  In "A Boy and His Dog," the characters hide from the suns harmful rays underground, in "Book of Eli," nearly all characters wear sunglasses when in sunlight.
4.  In Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic (the language of Jesus), Eli is a variant on the name of God, usually meaning "my God."
5.  SPOILER: There are many many clues as to Eli's character being blind throughout the entire movie; he bumps into a table, he felt around for the boots on the body, he heard the rat, he said "you have to come to me", when the woman said he'd have to say something or come to her, he scratches his shirt (and finds out she too is blind), he says he travels by faith not by sight, he counts the clicks on the iPod to get to a song, he fiddles with the iPod because he cannot see the battery is low, he asks the shopkeeper if he has his trigger off of the gun, he's always listening to birds/people, he doesn't shoot until he's shot at, he says he can smell people (the ambush), he says he "didn't see the (no trespassing) sign" at the old folks house, he heard the china rattling so he knew that they eat humans, etc.
