First upload, boys & girls.  Picked this one as a test pilot 'cause I didn't see any recent Seger posted on TPB. Plus, had it ready to go, anyway.
I can already hear the screaming. bitching & moaning..... "Why Fraunhofer?? ....why not LAME?.....why not FLAC?.....boo-hoo-hoo...waa-waa."
Actually, LAME has become my encoder of choice for lossy recently, not for quality issues.....both are fine encoders, but the open source format offers a much wider variety of options.  As far as this upload goes, I already had these ripped a couple of years ago. (lazy) :)
Anyhoo, hope this works & somebody enjoys it.
