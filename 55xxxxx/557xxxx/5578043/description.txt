                          THE COMPLETE EDITION

    A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF LIVE COMEDY AND MUSIC FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL


IN THE BEGINNING

WHEN John Cleese offered to 'get a few friends together' to stage a comedy
benefit in aid of Amnesty International, the result was "A Poke in the Eye
(with a sharp stick)". His 'few friends' were the cream of the comedy world
including his fellow Monty Python stars Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Terry
Jones and Terry Gilliam, Beyond the Fringe members Peter Cook, Alan Bennett
and Jonathan Miller, Graeme Garden, Tim Brooke Taylor and Bill Oddie from The
Goodies, Dame Edna Everidge, John Fortune, Eleanor Bron, John Bird and
Jonathan Lynn. A comedy institution was born.
"The Mermaid Frolics" in 1977 saw music added to the mix and the shows
produced classic performances from artists including Sting, Pete Townshend,
Peter Gabriel, Duran Duran, David Gilmour, Daryl Hall, Tom Jones, John
Williams, Phil Collins, Dave Stewart, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Lou Reed,
Morrissey, Jools Holland and even Spinal Tap!
This special boxed set is a unique collection of classic live comedy and music
from seven Amnesty International shows spanning 25 years. Enjoy!

A Word of Thanks
In 1976 Amnesty International staged the first show in its now famous Secret
Policeman's Ball series. At that time Amnesty International had 3000 members
in the UK and was struggling to raise funds for its campaigns. The shows had
a dramatic effect and Amnesty's UK membership rose by a staggering 700% in
three years. Amnesty International is now firmly established as the world's
largest international human rights organisation with a worldwide membership of
over 1 million people. We are still struggling to raise the necessary funds!
Since Amnesty International was founded, its members and supporters have
achieved much and helped to save many thousands of lives. The contribution to
human rights made by the performers and everyone involved in making these
shows has been huge and simply cannot be overstated.
Amnesty International would like to pay tribute and give very special thanks
to all the performers, producers, directors and the many hundreds of people
who gave their time, energy and remarkable performances to make these
ground-breaking shows possible. And for making them so good that they ore
still making us laugh and still raising funds to help save lives today.
We thank you all.
