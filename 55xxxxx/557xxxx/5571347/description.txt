CONSaver v1.3.1

Scuba156 of Xbox1Crew released CONSaver v1.2.0 (formally Batch Con Flag Remover). It's a tool that can help you get back all those corrupt saves from a banned Xbox 360 Profile.

What's new/fixed:
+ Added Onboard MU and pluggable MU support (only with FSD, ftp is broken with XEXmenu for now, if XexMenu support is needed, please use v1.2)
+ Backups now go into the backups folder for easy storage
+ Added a few error messages
+ Updated X360.dll to v1.0.0.37
+ Removed Restore Backups Tool as it is no longer needed
+ Fixed a few bugs and cleaned up some unused code
