,paulosty,2010-05-20T16:23Z,"when you unpack the ""Battlefield 1942.rar"", will apear 2 folders(CD1 and CD2). Into these folders, the ISO is splited in many files(.00,.01,.02... Ignore it), just find the ""*.rar"" and unpack normally.
Emulate with Daemon Tools or Alchool 120% and follow the screen instructions.
Inside the Crack folder, is the crack(D達r!) and the Serial ( 5000-0000000-0000000-1318 ).
Enjoy it!

2.Explain better what you mean on description.

3.Help the other people >_> You just copy paste the description the same time.

There's no Crack"
,Brosif,2010-07-07T15:58Z,It begs the question why this wasn't just emulated to CD in the first place.........everybody else does it
