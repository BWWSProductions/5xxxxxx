,liam627,2010-05-19T04:58Z,"have also one question about lost i found out yesterday(because i live in the netherlands)that heroes won,t come back next season is this true and if so what about the ending are they going to make it up with their fans on the dvdrelease of season 4"

,King_of_Kings,2010-05-19T05:05Z,"The Lost finale on Sunday was increased to 2 1/2 hours.

As for Heroes, from what I heard, there is a possibility of NBC making a tv-movie for the fans to have some kind of closure."
,liam627,2010-05-19T05:07Z,"let,s hope it,s true then because apart from the second season(stupid writers strike)it was a good series"

,sk74,2010-05-19T10:01Z,"eztv, as always, thank you! you're the only name I look for and trust to dl lost (or indeed, anything!)...

@frivalousMC - LMFAO! Have to agree with u WORD4WORD... I used to be one of the biggest supporters of Heroes, now I just spit venom at the mention of the name... I used to convert people into fans, now I tell people that haven't seen all of the last season (or more) not to bother, just keep the good memories they already have of it!!! Redemption finale was one of the worst and most painfully disappointing things I have seen on tv. I want to say MUCH more to diss it, but the show doesn't deserve the time that it would take to type my thoughts. After last season, I'm actually glad it's been cancelled - YEAH, I SAID IT!"
