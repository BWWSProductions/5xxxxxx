Donny Osmond Live 2003 Filmed at London's Hammersmith Apollo


Donny Osmonds first ever England solo gig in 2003, glad to have been part of the "Donny History", it was the same show as the Donny Osmond: Live 2003 DVD. To be honest, as a none believer I was pleased that I went, read as took the wife, this DVD does give the Man justice, for being nearly 47 he can still run rings around the rest. The rest of the band are excellent, I wish I could play just half as good as these guys. If I could play at all. Triangle anyone?

Here are some of the 22 tracks that are on the DVD:

Could It Be I'm Falling In Love, All Out of Love, Puppy Love, Luck Be A Lady Tonight, I Can't Go For That. Others to enjoy are This Is The Moment, Go Away Little Girl, Young Love, Would I lie To You and the shows now famous epilogue Crazy Horses. 

This DVD shows what goes on behind the scenes of his 2003 UK tour, it is very well put together and comes with DTS. Yes, if you are a fan then you will already have this in your collection no doubt, but if you are thinking about it, then you will do no wrong in trying it out.
