,nkm10gt,2010-05-21T09:31Z,"Globe! Please upload the obrigatory update of splinter cell conviction on torrent because i can't download from the sites you have given the have very poor speed.
Can somebody tell me the full procedure of installing splinter cell conviction because i have already installed the UBI Launcher for AC2 and AC2 runs on it through a patch, so is there a possibility to run Splinter cell conviction without uninstalling AC2?"
[V],globeplus,2010-05-21T11:29Z,"notes to the comments :

Well , who is really prejudicated for the fact the files don´t have too many seeds is the users , for my part i did the correct work to do nice files with everything ok , i really don´t understand if the users like to have nice new pc games for a nice size and complete games anyway , if really playing the full game for less giga with everything ok deserve consideration or not or if this type of work deserve to be preserved more as possible , i leave this analysis to the reflection of the users , for my part i repeat my work is the best possible to justify that . 

This game after extraction have close 5 giga and it is complete ."
[V],Subzero!,2010-05-21T13:00Z,"close to 5gigs, and complete?... ya sure... kool"
,lolz55,2010-05-21T13:49Z,"Would you ppl stop complaining about the speed! The torrent has been out for less than a day, so you can't expect a 1:1 ratio. Also if you are too lazy to download a simple program (ARC) that will save you bandwidth pls don't ever commenting on RIP torrents, because they all have program of that sort. One more thing, just so you know all torrents from Globe1 start with a slow pace speed and eventually when the seed ratio increase you will be able to download games of this size over a night. Cheers and GJ Globe. Ohh btw could you RIP ""Medieval II: Total War"" I have been looking for it for ages. XD"
,Jayless,2010-05-21T13:59Z,"Hi globe first of all thx for the great work, i have 1 minor issue i can't change the graphics options screens goes black and get a microsoft error....its not the specs of my pc :) theire great.

Thumbs up for the work

,Likeadidas95,2010-05-21T14:08Z,"what the fudge ?! you said globe that after extraction is close to 5 giga .. mm, the reloaded versions is lmost 7 giga ! i mean, u have downgraded too much, or cut out many vids or what ?! of course i appreciate your work and downloading this cuz speed is normal and you are good ripper as the others are ( tptb and more )
but please reply to me , and 1 question more : 
1 ) do you have to disable ur antivirus resident shield, cuz mby some file is virus or smth ..
***
If u want to play many new games ( Cell : Conviction , Just Cause 2 ) you have to 
always disable your antivirus !

Plz download new version of freearec that is 0.66 its faster and u can even use it to extract rar , 7zip, etc file formats. "
[V],globeplus,2010-05-23T22:29Z,"To hiteshbit16 : thank you for your arc recomendation , i already picked up and the difference to the before one is that now is possible to extract more normal type of archives than before basically then have a few circunstancial things that was corrected or integrated in the normal GUI of the program . thank you .
To aerofxrnu : when he posted he certainly looks a little bit crazy without too much sense but i believe that wasn´t really on purpous and maybe he was thinking on something that doesn´t maked to much sense , i think if he read the posterior comments he get the correct interpretation of the normal downloading of any file , i hope he remembers next time that are uploaders in the torrents that really make an effort to present a correct work to the users , and i guarantee that normally the users of my files have a normal tendence to have a regular download since the beggining of the files beeing available , the true is that really wasn´t any special motive to put that comments and my work is always positive to the users no doubt ."
,flirtyguy10,2010-05-23T23:52Z,@ globeplus i appreciate for your work but its not my internet speed. I am getting half or sometimes less than half of the speed i usually get while downloading other stuffs. Its because of the people who remove the torrent after downloading or limit its upload speed. 
[V],globeplus,2010-05-24T00:54Z,"Things like that and download more files at same time , number of peers and seeds at the moment , oscilations in users come and go a you refereand of course the internet speed connection can always make oscilate a little bit the downloading speed but generically the users can get nice downloading speeds , sometimes a little patience keeping a file can improve the downloading speed too , it is always generally a little complicate analise all the factors that can condicionate a download from a file but of course still true that a nice internet connection always help ."
,dhruv990,2010-05-24T07:41Z,"Please seed after downloading. I've finished downloading and will seed for atleast one day(would've seeded longer but i have downloaded this on my bro's laptop which is running out of space)

Secondly I have a crashing problem, my monitor locks up showing blurr screen and soon afterwards flickers and then hangs after playing this game for about 5-10 minutes...
Have the latest updates already installed, driver for video card Ati HD 4870 is 10.4. Windows xp service pack 3.. firewall turned off, antivirus disbaled while playing, every other games run fine - played Assassins Creed 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, Just cause 2 (for this windows 7 is installed), so almost every other game i can play fine without any glitch. But not this one, the crashing thing is bugging me. Can anyone help me out, going to try out the patch if released or maybe the cracks..."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-24T10:28Z,"To ramsay21 : this car racing game needs 2 gb ram for XP , not saying with this that you don´t have the necessary ram but to run properly is a little bit more ram necessary then the more traditional 1 gb ram or maybe 1.5 gb ram for xp , what i mean the base standards to have the game running fine are generally a little more than usual , not only the surpreendent 2gb ram  for xp but also 2.5 gb ram for vista or 7 , ok beside this curiosity , update your drivers , vcredist , directx and physx , normal support programs that help run any game , the game run easy , if after this updates you still have problems , check or do it again the extraction , maybe you get the game folder with any circunstancial problem without the extraction correct for any reason , if it is that reeinstall the freearc and restart the computer before execute the extraction to evitate interferences from background applications , finally if after allm of this you still don´t run the game , use your default search for tips with other users that possibly getted the same problem for this game or in other games with that carachteristics and remember that even in real copys circunstancial errors messages or slight anomalys can happen and the prove of this is nice pc games that everybodys knows with lists with possible errors that can happen for users that bought the game , also true that normaly with more or less difficulty this type of errors messages or slight anomalys can be corrected with the correct analise of the problem in more than 90% of the case when this situations happen ."
,Ramsay21,2010-05-24T10:59Z,"Thanks globe for the suggestion... really appreciate it..
I have done what you said, also I have 2gb ram 800mhz of Corsair so basically it might not be the ram issues cause i have already stated that i can play all the game fine.

I had this problem before with Couter Strike Source and some of its maps. If i used to play de_dust2, de_aztec or some other map then I didnt use to get this squared-box freezing and computer lock ups but with maps like de_dust or de_train i used to get these lockups and i had to restart my pc again. But this issue is now happening with split second game as well, so therefore i am getting too much concerned and all. With the upcoming games or so if i get the same issue then i will have to switch from ati to nvidia. In any case, i have a sapphire ati radeon 512 and i have read some similar issues for the same card on most forums, lets check what they have to offer."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-24T11:03Z,"To dhruv990 : the games you refered i worked them properly at the time they comers out , after all this time i don´t if the files still with seeds and peers to be possible the download , if this files not possible for some reason search for torrents files where you can make the download or try to find them at file sharing services and download by links , they are nice games but not recent and i worked them when they started to be available .

and of course you didn´t said what is the number of the model of the video card , they are many sapphire video cards with 512 mb .
I hope this help you ."

If still this game doesnot work for u try downloading TPTB rip for this game as last resort. anyway i am playing this game and its really fun and will seed few days more as i m low on disk space :( . Can u guyz imagine i have only 80GB HDD -_- 
and total free sapce is like 2GB i will buy a new HDD this next month

@dhruv990  it will be difficult to find FEAR 2 rip that is being seeded now but u can donwload ISO image i guess."

[V],globeplus,2010-05-24T16:50Z,"Made by the masters behind Project Gotham Racing and Metropolis Street Racer, Blur is a racing project by Bizarre Creations that aims to take arcade-style action and realistic driving physics to a whole new level. The game drops players into heart-pumping, electrified racing action with 20 cars on a track all targeting the finish line and battling each other as they trade paint and collect intense power-ups, including the ability to blast other cars out of the way with huge bursts of energy, boost their speed, and more. 
While controlling photo-realistic cars, gamers can use offensive and defensive attacks as they battle for the lead and careen through real-world track locations ranging from L.A. and San Francisco to the streets of Hackney, UK and the treacherous roads of Barcelona, Spain. 
This is the presentation to a new car racing game nice as this one but we still have to wait beside the relese date is may,28 , the available time you get the game in the torrents can difere for sooner or later than the date release ."
[V],globeplus,2010-05-24T17:03Z,"To StexDude : the videos in the menu are not green , they have a slight quadriculate while beeing showed and the other videos that you are talking about they really don´t have sound , they just quick presentations for the next event for example , the original stuff is like that too ."

found the problem and rectified it..
The video card has some inbuilt auto feature to switch its core clock speed for 2d and 3d applications and games to save power. Downloaded rivatuner and installed it and set the clock core speed @ 750 mhz and ran the game and no crash since then. I am now a happy sapphire ati hd4870 graphic card owner now. :D
Still need to test maps like de_dust and de_train in Counter Strike Source, btw is there any updated version of CSS with all inbulit updated maps and sounds that doesnt requires downloading of stuffs when joining any server on CSS via its spectate or internet options? Thanks"
