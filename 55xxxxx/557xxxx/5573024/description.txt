Larry B. Max is an unusual specialist from a little-known branch of the I.R.S. (Internal Revenue Service), the all-powerful tax-collecting agency of the United States, which has every technological method at its disposal to investigate possible links between high finance and high crime.

Max investigates two seemingly-unconnected murders. The former president of an Asian country, who was accused of embezzlement, is bumped off in France. Meanwhile, the right-hand man of a corrupt US mayor meets a grizzly end in the Californian desert. Max finds a strange message stating â€œSilicia, 10 am, Ocean Driveâ€ and tries to figure out what it all means. Meanwhile, a mysterious young lady seems to be one step ahead of him and erasing one clue after the other.
