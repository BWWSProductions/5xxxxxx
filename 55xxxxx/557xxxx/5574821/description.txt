If the video looks worse than usual, it's because 
I used this lesser episode as an experiment with 
different software to make the The Virginian 
smaller-sized files.

That's actually harder to do on a Macintosh...
at least my Mac from 2005.

It took me over 6 hours to convert this, and 
although it's still very watchable I don't like 
the way it came out. The reason is because instead 
of going directly from DVD+R to AVI, I went from 
DVD+R to VOB to AVI. 

Making a singular VOB file copy from the original 
disc saved hours of use on my DVD burner that I 
read the discs from. But it also lowered the quality, 
so I won't be using it anymore.

Guest stars are William Shatner and Strother Martin.

That picture you see which I found in a Google search
of Shatner and Doug McClure is actually from 10 years
later from an episode of their TV series
The Barbary Coast.
