,ebanana,2010-05-21T04:33Z,"please insert disk, did you make an iso somewhere in here?"
,metrOjedi,2010-05-24T05:20Z,No ISO.  :/  what am i missing here
,Payrin,2010-05-25T00:13Z,"Get powerISO and make  an ISO, god damn..."
,optiva21,2010-05-25T14:36Z,"Ive been trying to get this to work for about 3 days,  i also get the problem where it asks for a disk. There is no iso in the rar and using poweriso doesnt work. I think its because in the folder it doesnt say which files you need to put on the .iso so you end up putting all the keygens etc on as well if you put the whole folder in an iso. I suggest people try the one with 300 seeders instead (even though a lot of the comments there seem to have the same problem)."
,optiva21,2010-05-27T22:16Z,"fixed it now, its only the sample librarys that you want to put on the iso. leave the rest out."
,wassan92,2010-06-04T15:11Z,"What files,or folder specifically, help would be most appreciated. "
,KetaKat,2010-06-17T17:33Z,"** FIX FOR ""INSERT DISK"" FOLLOWS **

If you get a ""Insert disk"" warning, follow these procedures:

1. Make a DVD or Virtual DVD with the folder Sound Banks inside (the .rfl files are inside the folder ""Sound Banks""!!)

2. ** LABEL THE DVD ""Reason 4"" without quotes **

This is the most important step. Again, make sure to name the dvd ""Reason 4"" without quotes!

3. Burn or mount the DVD, install

4. ???

5. Profit! 


If you get the ""Waiting for disk..."" window, insert the DVD (or mount it). Whatever DVD that you insert (or mount with a virtual drive) has to be labeled ""Reason  4"""

Why are they there? Can I delete them as I already have installed Reason successfully? Care to explain for a computer noob?"
,zuperduperboi,2010-09-29T15:10Z,"Also, here's how you mount an iso image: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkoff7fMN7c"

,jarg7,2010-11-08T04:22Z,will the reason 5 upgrade that includes record work with this? I am thinking about purchasing the upgrade to reason 5 with record and was wondering if the upgrade version that requires reason 4 will work?
