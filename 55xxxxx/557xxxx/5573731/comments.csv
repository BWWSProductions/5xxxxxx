,xxmeegs20xx,2010-07-20T00:11Z,"Is anyone else having an issue with the store items not showing up in the game? I'm running Ambitions, and I have downloaded this torrent, another torrent to test, uninstalled and reinstalled all my games. All the items worked with the base game and WA. Once i got to High End, the items didn't appear in-game. Once I installed Ambitions, the items still haven't appeared. The launcher shows them as 'installed' - any ideas??"
