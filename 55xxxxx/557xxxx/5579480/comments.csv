[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-26T16:36Z,"Why rar? so that we're forced to download the whole alot even if we suposedly already have many of the songs from the list?
Also why not mention the quality KB/s ?
I have at least 20 songs in 320 KB/s CBR from the list...From the high  number of songs I think the bit rate is 192 VRB or lower... what ever I'm not interested in ""cat in the sack""."

This is exactly why in rar. In order not to cherry pick and run. Don't like it? don't download it

Most tracks are in 320kbps or V2. Only a few (mostly older) are in 192kbps. So don't make assumptions beforehand."
,frogski,2010-06-27T11:11Z,"btw, there's no ""cat in the sack"". don't believe me? Go to demonoid where I upload these torrents as well and read the comments yourself. All are positive and peeps appreciate the time and effort I've put in collecting and sorting the tracks, then sharing. Only you are bitching around..."
