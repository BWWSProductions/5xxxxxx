Ahoy Pirates!

I want to finally give back to the community!

As I don't crack Software, Games or have lot's of Music,
I had to think of a different approach to the whole torrent thing.
As I am addicted to TV shows (mostly drama, scifi, mystery and some comedy),
I'll try to give you all my favorite shows I download from here and there, and present them to you for you to enjoy and add them to your collection, with every episode of a season properly named and in the right order.
Thanks to all the original uploaders, who provided us with the single episodes when they just had been aired, I'm merely wrapping them up into one package for all the people, who are looking for rather one torrent to download than 20 or more single files.
So all hail  to the guys like eztv, VTV,  TvTeam, etc. - without you we would have nothing!

It's my first upload, so if you have questions, suggestions or requests,
post a comment or PM me on SuprBay

                                I present to you:
                         The HBO-Miniseries 'THE PACIFIC'

Plot:
A 10-part mini-series from the creators of "Band of Brothers" telling the intertwined stories of three Marines during America's battle with the Japanese in the Pacific during World War II. 

For those of you, who haven't heard yet from the series and want to get a first impression, I added a little trailer I made.

Every part is properly named.
All Files are in sync.
All Files are Xvid/mp3.
Aspect ratio is 624x352.

I know about the two other uploads, but as both of them have at least one or two episodes in a different codec, this one is genuine.

Pirate Bay is back in business!!! Ahoy to that!!!
