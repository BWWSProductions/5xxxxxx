,snowbirds,2010-06-11T07:28Z,"firstly, thanks for the up.

secondly, gonna tear this movie a new *sshole, because I need to vent my frustration with its dumbness.

***may contain spoilers***

this is one of those horror movies, where the suspense and scares mainly come from the characters doing totally stupid things and/or the music score producing a sudden, extremely loud noise.

everyone in the movie knows the doll is evil, and yet no one locks it up in a trunk or burns the little fucker. Instead they carry it around wherever they go like it were a little baby, and sit it up in whatever room they are hanging out in, so that the camera can watch the doll in the background as it slowly moves it's eyes back and forth.

The main character comes home to find his wife's jaw halfway ripped off, and the doll is sitting nearby, and furthermore, he knows the damn thing is evil and connected with the gruesome murder, and yet he continues to sleep with it in his bedroom every night, propped up in a chair near his bed? WTF, people? this is one of those movies where you're hoping and praying the main character gets killed so you can enjoy a little satisfaction for having to watch how stupid he is...

okay, that feels better. cheers "
,snowbirds,2010-06-13T06:00Z,"oh yeah, and it's also one of those movies where people stumble around in a dark house that has an evil, killer doll running around in it.  

Turn on the fucking lights people!  It makes it easier to see where the evil fucking killer doll is!

okay, now I really feel better."
