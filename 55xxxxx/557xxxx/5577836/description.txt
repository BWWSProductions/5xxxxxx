A fix to my previous torrent with a pre-cracked version of Darkspawn Chronicles. It was missing a few files, I assume that sword you get after the campaign - I didn't look into it much.
First thing first - I didn't test it. This one's on you. I currently have a tragedy within my family going on, so I cannot dedicate much time to this, I hope you understand. Not to mention that my head isn't at the right place at the moment, so please someone test it out. All content shows as installed and verified for me. Didn't go any further than that.

If anything, I'll just delete both last torrents of mine. Again, I'm sorry. It's hard for me to think straight now.

Again sorry for the inconvinience. You don't need to re-download the big (300+ mb) file if you already did - just the small ones you are missing.
