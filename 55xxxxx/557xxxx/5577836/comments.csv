,RottenBrain,2010-05-22T05:22Z,"From what I've read, the sword (Blightblood) is supposed to appear in my inventory after completing the DLC, but it doesn't even though I have the Darkspawn Chronicles completion achievement and the sword appears in my installed DLCs list. Any suggestions?

Btw, thanks for the upload dude. Sorry to have doubted you on your previous DA:DC upload."
,TiLLseed,2010-05-22T15:30Z,"Thanks, much appreciated.

But does anyone have a brief description of what exactly the three small DAZIPs do?"
,RyukuRift,2010-05-23T22:44Z,"Great downloads =D ive downloaded both pre-cracked DAO addons and was wondering if you are also going to create pre-cracked torrents for soldiers peak and wardens keep =D as it would be amazing and i would also like to wish the best of luck with the tragedy and i hope everything gets better =D.

Thanks alot =D"
,elven-archer,2010-05-24T23:11Z,"Hi Illiria we all wish you well.

The unlockable item that comes with the campaign is a sword called ""Blightblood"".

I installed everything you uploaded here. The problem is: the sword was correctly registered to my in-game list of installed DLC, but when I completed the campaign the item was not unlocked. It was not automatically added to my main campaign inventory as prescribed.

I don't know whose mistake this is because Bioware guys have done a lot of awfully sloppy work lately. Maybe it's another bug to add to their very long list, maybe not.

Just promise us to look into it when you have the time.

Peace."
,astrojeet,2010-06-23T06:24Z,thanks!! works perfectly.
,TiLLseed,2010-07-09T19:47Z,"Yeah, I have to confirmed that this download is bugged. No Blightblood in your inventory, and I experienced some crashes while playing through the scenario.nnAfter installing the other non-cracked version, I played through again without crashes and got Blightblood."
,Benttley,2010-12-08T23:38Z,I'm sorry but... How do I install it?
