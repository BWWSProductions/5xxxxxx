Pendulum made one of the biggest breakthroughs of the 2000s with their hit album In Silico. Having sold over one million records worldwide, the band completed a sell out Academy tour in 2008 and went on to smash the international festival circuit in summer 2009 with killer appearances at Glastonbury, Download, V and Global Gathering to name a few. Both Pendulum studio albums to date-In Silico and the band's debut Hold Your Colour-have gone Platinum.

Immersion's lead single "Watercolour" heralds a glorious evolution in the Pendulum sound. Now utilising a richer sonic tapestry than ever before, Watercolour" finds Rob Swire's vocals alternating between eerie distortion and full-blooded energy amidst flourishes of horns and an atmospheric, tension building breakdown. The track's progressive structure highlight's Pendulum's continuing development in constructing contrasting dynamics.
