,vatrix,2010-05-21T23:26Z,thanks for the upload... but 7-8/10 for the quality.. to much bass leaving the sound a bit distorted.. gets annoying
,jordanh91,2010-05-22T09:09Z,"You, sir, are made of some serious winsauce."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-05-22T09:49Z,"there is no ""too much bass"" or distortion bullshit.  its 100% perfect for sure.  i just think people need better audio equipment rather than that $2 crap they use."
,Afterscore,2010-05-22T16:35Z,"For serious?

I thought this didn't come out for another 3 days?"
[V],bubanee,2010-05-22T21:32Z,"V2 normally states scene releases and actual album release depending on your location is/was set for 18th ~ 25th There abouts.... 
as for bass and distortion, Z i like your response So True! plus remember people it's also a MP3 LOSSY format... i'm sure there is Flac and 1411 Releases as well out there.. this is just another option.. and i think it sounds alright.... "
,Bubbel_Boy,2010-05-23T11:50Z,This made my day! thx 4 the upload :D
,amputate,2010-05-23T12:32Z,"YES! YES !! PENDULUM :D
SEEDING :D"
,ryz866,2010-05-23T13:03Z,"made an account jst to warn users the bass / quality puts pendulum to shame. i dnt know what the uploader did to the audio but its terrible im listening to this on a dolby headset. there a good one on pirate bay thats fine and 155mb and 320kbps

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5572512/Pendulum-Immersion-(2010)

this one does this amazing group justice. and the uploader shouldnt flame ppl for saying this is bad because there is something wrong with it. ... even went down to my car and tested this version and still fucking up on 16x9s + 2 x 12inch subs pioneer sysem."
,tadux3000,2010-05-23T18:42Z,Thx!!! i was waiting for this a long time ago!thx again;P P.S. Bubanee keep it coming :DDD
[V],bubanee,2010-05-23T21:16Z,"ryz866... Since ya new i'll let ya know how i work..

Firstly if you see CDRip in the title of whatever i put up it's that.. if you don't see it, it is something i have sourced from elsewhere and put here. i used to write scene, web release.. and for the record i did actually get the CD first as well but it was pointless me doing it Public because of the one here.. something else i used to was delete the older and put the CD up.. that too is gone out the window.. Thats me "
,bongsrus,2010-05-24T11:10Z,sounds good as alway's. you the phukken man
,Kettingzaag,2010-05-24T11:30Z,"Bubanee, don't worry about this ryzz dude. you delivered a good job; there's nothing wrong with the quality"
,ryz866,2010-05-24T11:44Z,just ran it through audio monitor and played it side by side with the other rip i linked. the lvls on this one go too high for some reason in the low freqs causing distorting on good sound equip. probably sounds fine on low bass options. like ipods with earbuds or mini hi fi systems ... but on dolby or a good car setup. its bad. i dnt know why but it is. chucked ur cd in my mates stock subaru sti 2009 model which is a good stock sound system and same shit... so yeah if this ones fine for u... keep on using it. if not grab the one i linked. its higher bitrate and doesnt mess around
,j4y1981,2010-05-25T00:11Z,Sorry but the sound quality isnt that great not when i compared some of the tracks from Pendulum's website :(.
,with_teeth100,2010-05-26T21:43Z,GREAT quality! Thanks SO much bubanee. Also very quick download and works great with iTunes! A must download!
[V],lan3y,2010-05-27T22:19Z,Respect Bubanee :)
,skull-shaker,2010-06-07T08:26Z,fucking great album thanks a million bub you have single handedley supplied my whole music collection and trust me its a big fucking collection i edo however have a request plz can you find hell yeahs new album for me plz mate  
,cloudlime,2010-06-10T08:28Z,"Bitchin' upload, my friend! Thank you vera much! But as for the album... ugh, I can't hold my tongue. Pendulum has changed so much.
Incredible album but damn have they become the boy band of drum and bass. Don't get me wrong, the album truly fucking delivers, and on many levels, but unfortunately Immersion dies early. So strong, if not the best shit since Hold Your Colour.... that is, until the last three tracks. Prior to tracks 13, 14, and 15, we have 12 winners. Crush & Watercolour were the most original, Island - Part 1 & Part 2 were like ying and ying, two extremes in harmony; Salt In The Wounds takes it back to their Jungle Sound Gold days, good stuff; Under the Waves was like 9,000 miles in structure but not quite as immersive. The Vulture, and others were so INCREDIBLE. 

But the last three take drum and bass to this electronic-pop level, almost sounding boy band-ish in the vocals. One of the songs tries a metal approach and while its not bad, its NOT pendulum. Their great musicians, I just hate seeing them deviate from their roots. They need to progress, NOT CHANGE. Other than that, the album is a mix of genres, each song having elements from a certain established sound. But it's great overall. Like a good movie with a bad ending. Or a drama, with a chick-flick musical number at the end. Everyone breaks into singing and dance! A total WTF moment. 

4/5

Respect, bubanee!"
,ef6854,2010-06-10T21:23Z,By far pendulums crappest album to date
,xIKMS,2010-06-11T14:20Z,"Amazing torrent great work!

,Godjason100,2010-07-30T07:41Z,they need to change there name there not even pendulum anymore! boo!! bring back the old stuff!
,daltonlm,2010-08-04T13:30Z,"Pendulum is one of my fav groups, not measuring only DnB, but overall. Of course the good things produced by them are the DnB tracks, and it made me dig for other similar bands/djs...

Unfortunaly this last release lacks the inspiration for the earlier ones... The energy, the crystal beats, the immersive (the real one, not this album title) isnt here... its like a parody of what Pendulum could be. I almost say it sounds cheap, even with all producing / performing techniques.

IMHO, the only tracks witch saves the album are Watercolour (reminding a bit the best songs from them) and Set Me On Fire (A good but not exceptional Dubstep, since this genre is highly wanted at these days). But some rebots from classics doesnt works, like Salt In The Would (boring and without inspiration). Even Liam Howlett didnt helped enough.

I wouldnt even like to mention the ""hardcore"" and ""deep house"" attempts, because these tracks sounds souless for me...

I give a honest 3/5 for this release. Even being a Pendulum Fan."
,Gili_Alpha_1,2010-08-09T17:17Z,Nice :) thank you!!!!!!!
,lovetheherb,2010-08-30T00:50Z,Nice 1 dude :) wil u have the new kings of leon album anytime soon ???
,Thorbears,2010-09-19T17:25Z,"Thanks for the upload.
Around 200kbps on all songs, fair quality.
(could've been same on all tho)"
,darkpoet1978,2010-09-20T11:05Z,"I agree with cloudlime... except that Pendulum may have DrumNBass roots but techno sucks.  This album rocks (except the last few tracks which seem to totally deviate from techno into Industrial territory)... All in all, a kick-ass album."
,De_pwnz,2010-09-23T22:10Z,Wasn't too impressed by the album. but definitly good quality and downloaded in like less than a minute ;)
,Shynobi,2010-10-16T17:04Z,"@ Cloudline - I have to correct a few things here for you. You complain about the ""metal approach"" they take, and you are right, it isn't them, it is In Flames featuring rob swire, In Flames ARE a metal band. 
As far as it being ""Pendulum deviating from their roots"", well the founding members were originally in a rock band and are from Australia if I am not mistaken, so really, doing things coming from a rock influence is actually much closer to their roots that DnB or any other kind of electronic music. 
I love how everyone becomes a critic on here just because they have the ability to leave comments. I dont really give a fuck what you thought of the album, you are in no way qualified to give a legitimate review from an obvious overall knowledge of music itself. 

It would be nice if people could just comment on the quality and speed of these torrents and leave it at that. 

I already have this album but thanks Bubanee! "
