,getred,2010-05-23T01:20Z,Hey Wendy... always download your torrents and find them awesome. Thanks a million. But when i try to install this avira isn't allowing it saying it detects crypt.xpack.gen... I know it is impossible with your downloads... but i am a lil worried about running the exe file. Could someone tell me if this is happening for them or it is just me? Thanks in advance.
,getred,2010-05-23T17:55Z,Can someone tell me if there is any virus in this? If not... why is Avira detecting one... didn't do it any other downloads from Wendy... this is the first time... help pls!!!
