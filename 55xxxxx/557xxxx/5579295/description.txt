X-MEN: PIXIE STRIKES BACK # 4
The Story: You canâ€™t pick your parents. And if you could, Pixie certainly wouldnâ€™t have picked Mastermind, the man who turned Jean Grey into the Dark Phoenix. But right now, thatâ€™s the least of her problems. A giant demon named Saturnine has been using her Pixie dust to lull her fellow X-Men into submission and itâ€™s worked. Now heâ€™s one step away from all the power he needs to take control of the world. Can the fast-talking Welsh girl with wings possibly stop him?
