Maybe your System Can't Handle 1080p HD Movies! Try Upgrading your CPU, I Guess Quad Core will do the Job with Enthusiast GPU and Lots of RAM, Also Make Sure you Have the Right Codec's for DTS ;)

BTW* Extremely Excellent X264 Video Quality with Crispy 24-bit DTS Sound! Thanks a Lot!"
,euphoria4949,2010-06-11T03:36Z,"## Mahoraba3 ## I agree you PC obviously can't handle Blu-Ray because the audio is perfect its not out of sync at all. If you have a PS3 try streaming it through that you wont have any problems then.

Ok now the film isn't just about a random book its about the Bible. Now I'm completely anti religion but it didn't matter because the film is really pretty good and doesn't have a lot of praise jesus crap in it, so if you are like me and can't stand religious momob jombo don't worry you understand the significance of the book in the film.

,FindingDori,2010-07-05T20:16Z,"@Mahoraba3
Try some other media players? But as some other people have said you do need an upto date computer and codec's."
