This game is designed for people, those who want to do some mind exercise. A small game but a good one. 



Directions : 

1.) Use mouse click to move boxes up, down, left and right (Click on the Box you want to move and take Blank box's position but this box has to be touching the blank box).
2.) Try to place all boxes in ascending order (horizontally), to win the game.
3.) Compare your score with your friends.

Enjoy all
