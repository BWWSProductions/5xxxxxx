      An observed documentary series following the dramatic and
      often emotional highs and lows of daily life for six different
      families all living in one large housing scheme in Kilmarnock.
      From parents battling to keep their kids on the straight and
      narrow to people fighting for community projects, the series
      offers a snapshot of life in modern day Scotland. Marvin and his
      dog Bullet are reunited with an old flame while another family
      struggle to deal with one of their children being jailed. Single
      mum Kay decides to take in three of her teenage daughter's
      friends.
