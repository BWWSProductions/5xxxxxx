brings back a fan favorite with 4-player split-screen gameplay."

,jogfsovt,2010-05-31T21:13Z,"This game works 100%. Thanks, uploader.


-- Note to new downloaders --

Just run it through abgx360 for SSv2 and DMI like any other game. YES, you need to flash your Xbox before you can play this or ANY backup game. If you don't know how to mod your Xbox, search Google or read the Jungleflasher tutorials. It's a bit more complicated than someone could tell you in a comment box. "
