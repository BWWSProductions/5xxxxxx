,DarkRedoSin,2010-11-06T19:04Z,"Works perfectly.If you don't know what to to read this-
(1)Download.
(2)Unzip RAR Archive.
(3)Inside the newly created folder you have:
FoxitPDFCreator-(text document),Keyfile-(text document),FoxitPDFCreator302_enu_setup, and FoxitPDFCreator302_x64_enu_setup.
(4)Choose the correct version for you-x32 or x64 version and install.
(5)Double click on Keyfile(text document) and copy from [Foxit Licence] to Sign=xxxxxxx and paste into Registration box and click on Register the Key.
It's that simple,thanks"
