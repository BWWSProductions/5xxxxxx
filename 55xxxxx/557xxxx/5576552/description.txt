Here are some key features of "Foxit PDF Creator":

Search ability:
Â· Many PostScript-driver based PDF creation tools create PDFs without character 
encoding information. Therefore it's not possible to do a search in the resulted PDFs. 
Even though you can look at all those characters, you can't search them. 
Foxit PDF Creator retain all character encoding information, so you can search it, 
extract it, and convert back to pure text document.

Display and process efficiency:
Â· Many PDF creation tools break text contents into individual characters, causing some 
performance issues for displaying and processing. Foxit PDF Creator groups texts with 
similar "display attributes" together, which improves performance when the PDF gets d
isplayed or processed.

File size:
Â· Many PDF creation tools require all or many fonts to be embedded with the PDF file, 
resulting in bigger file size for the PDF. Foxit PDF Creator can reduce the file size 
for many documents.

Speed:
Â· Many PDF creation tools adopt a two phase creation procedure: first print to PostScript language, 
then convert to PDF, not only is some information lost during the process, but it also takes more time. 
Foxit PDF Creator directly creates PDFs from any printing application fastest among all current 
PDF creation tools.

Accuracy:
Â· Many PDF creation tools don't handle complicated Windows drawing features like transparency 
and the generated PDFs are not identical to the original documents. Foxit PDF Creator processes 
all Windows drawing functions so your PDF is always same as your original document.

Compatibility:
As developer of popular Foxit Reader, Foxit Software knows PDF standard very well. 
This ensures that PDFs created by Foxit PDF Creator will have the best result in any standard PDF reader.
