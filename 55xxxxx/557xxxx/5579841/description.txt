Review	by John Floyd  allmusic.com
A superb assortment of rare surf instrumentals from 1961-1964, it doesn't have many hits but included are plenty of previously unreleased gems.  

What I like best is by adding the sequel you get a "best of" of some of the lesser known groups that were still highly influential in their day. Check out "Night Scene" by the Rumblers and you'll see the beginnings of surf noir. "Intoxica" and "Church Key" by the Revels are also classics that predate frat rock. All giid stuff.
