i will not comment yet on this one coz am not starting the download. if u already installed it and having blank screen, maybe its the same problem with COD 5.  goto c:\documents and settings\NAME\local settings\activision\COD***  if no folder(s) in it, make one and named ""players"", inside the players folder create another folder example ""shaune"" then also in the players folder create a text file and name it ""active"" (active.txt), edit it and put the name of the folder (shaune) in it and save the text file.  then try to launch the game again.  hope this works, and if it works, i'll download the game immediately.

@roky56
