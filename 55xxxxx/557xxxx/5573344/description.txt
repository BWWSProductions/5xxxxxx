Elephant Stone - The Glass Box (2010)(EP)





Elephant Stone is a Canadian indie rock band. Fronted by Rishi Dhir (formerly associated with The High Dials), the band's style incorporates aspects of traditional Indian music including the sitar.

Dhir formed the Elephant Stone after he left The High Dials and began to explore Indian classical music. He later found that the 1960s pop that he grew up with, such as The Kinks and The Beatles, was influencing the way he played.

The band's debut album, The Seven Seas, was released June 2, 2009 on Dhir's own Elephants on Parade label, with distribution by Fontana North. The album was a longlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize on June 15, 2009.

On July 4, 2009 The Seven Seas was released on Irish label Indiecater Records.
