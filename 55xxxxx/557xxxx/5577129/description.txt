Some edited highlights, in the â€œjust as arbitraryâ€ recommended style of a leading self-appointed Expert in the Unexplained (!), from The Royal Society of Magic (RSM - actually  M = medicine - believe it or not) 2008 revenge meeting, held by a little group of very nice kind and compassionate people, after being snubbed by NICE for their dodgy views, but who still find a crippling disease a fine vehicle for their own self-expression, and their compulsive stereotyping habit of others, eagerly exploited and welcomed by the privileged few to their considerable advantage, via both Government and Corporate. A grey area of mutual interests.

Dedicated to all who suffer so egregiously - directly and indirectly from the malignant effects of the pseudo-sciences of pop-genetics and pop-psychology,  and gossip-based medicine ( behaviourism - a stupid experimental attempt on humans in this instance - called 'GET' - and 'CBT') - dressed up as science â€“ and allowed to pass, reflecting deeper problems of creeping authoritarianism, and of highly constrained genuine free-speech and democracy, and declining scientific literacy within society. 



Please seed generously if you can so that others may come to learn something of the distal origins of their difficulties, especially in countries less well off than the UK, where Governments and Healthcare might uncritically accept the British example without realising it's flimsy and misleading nature.   

Beware, it's satire!
