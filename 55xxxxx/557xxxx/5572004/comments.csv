I loved the Pacific show, who didnÂ´t?  I was very worried when I started watching it cause it had so much to live up to, considering how good Band of Brothers actually was.  But it didnÂ´t let me down one bit, and neither did this torrent, With the Old Breed. 

What impresses me a lot is under what conditions these soldiers lived and fought without any of the modern technology that the modern day marine core use, without water for long periods of time etc, etc..  

They were indeed a tuff bunch of Raggedy Ass Marines, hahaha!  Not that todays marines around the world have an easy task, not at all.  But honestly, they have nothing on these guys, especially if you strip them of their tech.

Just my humble opinion.

Anyway, enjoy guys."
