           Alice is an innocent virgin who acts            
           and dresses younger than her age. She             
         rejects William, her suitor, because she         
           considers his sexual advances inappropriate.       
            One day while daydreaming a white rabbit             
              taps her on the shoulder, and leads her            
             to Wonderland, where she is introduced to          
            her imagination and to pleasure. After           
               encounters with the Queen of Hearts, Alice        
                 realizes that Wonderland may not be for
                 her, and that she misses William.

                  As with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
                before it, kids today are happily walking
                around thinking Tim Burton's Alice in
                Wonderland is the one and only version, and
                certainly the only version worth seeing.
                Not so.

                  Over the last more than 100 years, countless
                adaptations of Alice in Wonderland have made
                it to the big and small screen. Some of these
                have had a twist, but you'd be hard-pressed
                to find any single version crossing into as
                many diverse genres as this one.

                  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's Alice in
                Wonderland, the musical comedy porno, like
                only the 70s could have made it! Producer
                Bill Osco (of Flesh Gordon fame) somehow
                managed to convince stunningly beautiful
                Playboy model Kristine DeBell to star in
                this fun-filled interpretation of a classic
                children's tale. It stays surprisingly true
                to its source material, give or take a few
                hundred raunchy puns and sexual innuendos,
                and the music is actually catchy! Production
                value is obviously low with its near-naught
                budget, but the costumes are elaborate
                enough that you actually start buying into
                the story after a while, and you'll be
                humming those tunes long after the movie
                ends.

                  Aside from the significant novelty value,
                the real reason to watch this is Kristine
                DeBell, in by far her naughtiest role ever.
                Her innocent acting, combined with her little
                lost girl looks, makes her perfect for playing
                Alice in any version. Lucky for us she chose
                the version where she gets to show her bits!
                                                               
                  We've tagged this as the uncut version,      
                even though that may not be entirely accurate. 
                Uncut is what others are calling it; it *is*   
                the longest version, and it *does* have all    
                the hardcore scenes missing from shorter cuts. 
                But that doesn't necessarily add anything as   
                the hardcore scenes were spliced in years      
                after original release. If anything it's a     
                hardcore edit rather than an uncut version.    
                Any XXX scene where you can't see Ms. DeBell's 
                face is a spliced in body double, and that     
                includes the now infamous penetration scene.   

                  Nevertheless, it's quite an enjoyable flick  
                from a different time in porn, when story      
                actually mattered more than the amount of      
                silicone and peroxide. You get to see a drop-
                dead gorgeous Playboy beauty give head and   
                play with herself, all while singing along to
           infectious ditties! What more could anyone         
            ask for?

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never
