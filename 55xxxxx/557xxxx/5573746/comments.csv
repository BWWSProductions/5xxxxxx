... before private bits were given a 'fashion' make-over/shave/airbrush like today's unreal porn.

The entire movie has a commitment to combining a genuine musical with a 'mild' pornographic aspect (that really comprises such a small amount of the total run time of the movie), making it a real teaser in comparison to more modern ""How do ya do? Let's fuck"" type of erotica.

The http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074113/ reviewers seem to prefer the softer 'R' rated version over the uncut 'X' rated version, but you and I can do our own editing if required.

I enjoyed this, thanks to TvTeam :-)"
