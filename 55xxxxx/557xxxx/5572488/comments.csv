,SATURNIANTITAN,2010-11-20T13:14Z,"I only needed track 4 (Warhorse) as for some reason it didn't download correctly when I redeemed my Limited Edition code,
for this reason I was a little annoyed that you zipped all these files, as it prevented me from just downloading the single file I wanted.
There is NO NEED to zip a torrent this small"
