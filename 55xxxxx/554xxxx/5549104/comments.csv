,gundy101,2010-05-10T10:52Z,Thank you so much for this. Was trying to download the TvTeam copy for the past hour and a half and was at 1%. Within 2 minutes of starting this one I'm at the same and only getting faster. I'm glad there are people out there who have the decency to seed after downloading
