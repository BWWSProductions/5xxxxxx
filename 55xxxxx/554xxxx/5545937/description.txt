PrisM Notes::::::::::::
video was very orange in some effect, so lowered the saturation down quite alot, then changed gamma, hue, and contrast ... editing some of it just slightly, and some of it a fair bit ... added slight video - denoise and slight sharpness, added IMAGINES line audio (thnx) // prism
