,insomniac86,2010-05-11T15:35Z,Nice bass in the audio. Some versions out there sound very trebley. Audio synch seems very good too and apsect ratio is also better. Thanks!
,agosign,2010-05-11T15:59Z,"V 6
A 6
Barely watchable but a good cam nonetheless."
,supa[ANT],2010-05-11T19:59Z,this thing has great seeds but still slow DL

,nemozeen,2010-05-12T15:10Z,Seems like the same russian video but with way much better audio. Now I can really enjoy this movie! thx
,teknicz,2010-05-12T18:57Z,"Fast download, and a very watchable CAM. Probably the best version out right now. It is, however, missing the post-credits scene.

A 6 / V 7 (for a CAM)"
[V],raymondhome,2010-05-13T02:20Z,"you can also try this release...

,nishanrh,2010-05-13T09:07Z,all those guys who hav marked this down... witch off!
,brock01384,2010-05-14T22:26Z,Audio cuts out at 16:00 for about 15mins. Very dissapointed. Other than that its good.
,s-i-x,2010-05-15T00:31Z,Audio buggy. Might have been encoder for iPod. Video fair. Watchable.
,haavdwee,2010-05-15T16:52Z,"@proguyxl
If sound is good on PC but bad on DVD you should consider changing burn application, you must be doing something wrong."
,Woutterr,2010-05-15T16:53Z,thanks for this upload :D
,BIG1ification,2010-05-16T05:02Z,Jus saw the sample... and it looks pretty good for a cam... 8/10
,kludge420,2010-05-19T04:22Z,"You don't rate a video ""for a cam"" dumbfucks. Who the fuck knows what you think a cam should look like you stupid fucking asshole.

Here is a REAL rating

A:3 - Blurry, pixelated
V:3 -  REALLY tinny, people talking in theater"
,kludge420,2010-05-19T04:25Z,"Don't waste your time. Horrible copy. The person that rated this A-10 and V-8 hates you and hates movies.

REAL rating:
A-3 Blurry, pixelated
V-3 Tinny, speech hard to hear"
,torrent_reviewer,2010-05-22T21:41Z,"I don't know what is happening. I am downloading torrents for last about four years and this is happening with me for the first time. I have never been fooled four times in a single movie. This is the fourth copy of Iron Man 2 I have downloaded in two days and ALL OF THEM ARE FAKE. This is from a person who has a green skull with his(/her) name!!!!!!!!!! I checked out in opensubtites that a subtitle for Prism exists and that really had conversations. So, I was sure that this is a real one. so many seeds and so many good comments. BUT, THIS IS ANOTHER F*CKING FAKE COPY. The sample contains real cam take of Iron Man 2. I first downloaded that. Then I found that the main movie is a black and white video of a god damn band. F*CK FU*K FUC* *UCK"
,torrent_reviewer,2010-05-22T21:46Z,"Oh! I have identified this black and white video of band. This is ""Doors"" from Jim Morrison. Thanks uploader for Jim Morrison video as I was searching this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,torrent_reviewer,2010-05-22T21:48Z,"Oh! I have identified this black and white video. It is ""Doors"" from Jim Morrison."
,tuffscout,2010-05-23T17:32Z,"Kludge420, I'm sorry, but you must be retarded. Anyone who follows your comment must be of equal retardation. A stands for AUDIO and V stands for VIDEO, you retarded fuck... jesus christ...

Anyways, yeah, this isn't the best, but neither is any other cam out there right now."
,Xthlon,2010-05-27T12:40Z,"@kludge420 - ...epic fail...

gonna wait till decent scn or dvdrip..."
,LordDamyn,2010-05-27T20:55Z,"This video file isn't actually all that bad. It is watchable, and is only really annoying in dark parts, and a few times it loses focus. Its a CAM so it's not going to be DVD or Blu-ray quality, but that should be obvious. If you expected that a few weeks after the movie was released, you shouldn't be on the internet. Don't listen to the comments that are all practically carbon copies of each other. And don't listen to comments that have names of websites. Unless those websites are other pirate bay links ;). This is a quite recommendable copy of IM2. If you just can't wait for DVD and don't have money to blow on the big screen, this is the one you want."
,Metalsand,2010-06-13T20:00Z,Damn good quality for a cammed release.
,TheSnapppy,2010-06-21T20:00Z,"hi, i am new at piratebay and i have a big problem....  when i have downloded this torrent, i wanna wach it. but when i do it only thing that happend is that i hear the audio and i can not see the film..... HELP"

,fightoffyour_demons,2010-07-03T21:48Z,"@TheSnappy
What are you trying to open it with? Sounds like WMP. You need to download VLC and it will work wonders. "
,the_admin004,2011-01-04T13:41Z,"hi PrisM
