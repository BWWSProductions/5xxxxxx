,beckinsale_95,2010-05-08T13:04Z,"@extremezone
The reason why it is labeled as R5 because it was taken from a region5 dvd where the audio is replaced. Just because the audio and video are good, doesn't mean that it is a DVDrip...

COALITION is just being honest. Unlike others..."
,Q_77,2010-05-08T13:34Z,"Nice one thnx, am seeding at full speed"
,mufuti9,2010-05-08T13:46Z,"Why am I under the impression the morons always posting SEEEEEED PLOX!!, RAISE YOUR UPSPEED PLX!!! DURRRRR
are the ones limiting their upload speed because they actually believe this is going to help with their leeching? (hint: It will not)

Seriously, stfu up, it won't do anyone any good posting this trash in the comment section. Nobody cares, either.

actually..... limiting the upload speed to around 75%-90% of your maximal up speed is in the most cases (esp. low bandwidth ones) going to make it possible to reach a higher download speed...
but yeah those comments are seriously useless, these torrents always have a slow speed the first couple of days no matter how people ""seed plox"""

Listening to the movie with headphones I can really tell that it's all messed. The audio is stronger in the left ear / speaker, speech is quieter than the backing music tracks, right speaker kicks in and out. Test speakers with various other movies and music files and they are fine.

Disappointing as the video quality is very good."

,maxram2,2010-05-16T02:33Z,"Watched this via XBMC running on Windows 7 > HDTV.  

V:9
A:7.5

Being an R5, the mix is somewhat unsettled, enough in parts to render dialogue unclear as the soundtrack can 'rage'.  Nothing enough to spoil the experience though.  

Anyway, this movie - for once - is probably worth the Bluray purchase.  Wet your appetite with this R5.  Even I may take my cheap ass down to HMV when this releases.

Excellent offering, fun movie too, well worth the admission price.

Aaaah me mateys.  'Tis a fine download.   Thanx upr.
