,BlackKnight810,2010-05-12T02:55Z,"hahaha its much more then that Shaderpixel!!
I dont watch movies thats not watchable
i didnt record the cam just edited it"
,evilpiratened,2010-05-12T18:06Z,not a fake but audio is maybe a 6 or 7/10. the video is about a 5/10. definitely not the way to watch this for the first time
,cevdet82,2010-05-12T22:12Z,"If you have downloaded a movie and it is saying that you need to download x3 player or PlayVix Playerto watch it, then beware, it is a big scam. I have gone through this.

Then I installed that.
Then I was bombarded with bullshit porn websites in my browser.
When I tried to play the movie? its was only a trailer.

What these people do?
They make a movie file which contains a high quality clip or trailer
of the movie and if you play that file with media player or VLC or any other player, there will be layer of text on the movie saying


You need to download X3 or PlayVix Player to watch the movie. It will also give you a website address to go and buy that shit player.


Once you buy the player and install it, it will install adware programs and open porn sites and even then you will not be able to watch the movie, because that movie file is just a clip of 5-10 seconds only.


Don?t be caught.


Whenever you download a movie and receive this message, then please delete the movie immediately and leave a negative comment for the other downloader.


One more important thing:


If any of your friend has been caught in this scam, please go and raise a claim for refund in your paypal account .


Final and most important thing:


Never ever buy such products and pay by paypal. They will take the payment and they will put a subscription on your paypal account.. so without your knowledge they will take about $15-$20 from
your paypal account every month.
If any of you has already caught in this scam, please make sure that you have checked your paypal account for any subscription and cancel it straight away.

Even if the size of movie is around 700MB and its avi file.. it is going to be only a
trailer..
No luck
Beware others of this bull shit Don?t waste your time and money. Thanks."
,BlackKnight810,2010-05-14T02:41Z,"Thanks@Evil
some of people on here need not to lie,and first of all if you download a movie and it asks you to install something on your pc besides a codec then your a fucking idiot@Cevdet82..lol"
,bluecarvw,2010-05-23T02:07Z,"You need to download X3 or PlayVix Player to watch the movie!!

You need to download X3 or PlayVix Player to watch the movie!!"
