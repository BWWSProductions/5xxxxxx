,Shitpoop,2010-11-17T05:53Z,"Episodes are fairly low quality, and are direct from TV rips, so yes, they are censored.

Better than nothing, I guess. Thanks."

,Shitpoop,2011-01-29T03:49Z,"Why do you have to find uncensored? Is it really a big deal? Are you unable to watch the show because there is a beep instead of a ""shit""?"
,Shitpoop,2011-02-15T21:31Z,"Just so people don't save it for last and then get disappointed like I did: The movie is nothing but clips from Season 3 sewn together. They changed a handful of scenes, but if you've seen season 3, then you've seen the movie."
,vivatpb5776,2011-05-31T19:06Z,Seasons 1 & 2 are ripped straight from The SciFi Channel. The video quality of season 1 is grainy with full screen resolution (512*384). The video quality of season 2 is still full screen (512*384) but there is no graininess. Season 3 is a wide screen (672*368) DVDRip. The video quality is very good.
