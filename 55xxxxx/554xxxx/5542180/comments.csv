,glisk,2010-05-29T08:42Z,"Can anyone confirm that this is real? Looks too small to be real. I have seen other cata torrents at 2GB, complete installs at 14GB, why is this only 18MB?"
,glisk,2010-05-29T08:51Z,"Looks like an online installer that downloads the alpha files from Blizzard. That sounds like a great way to get caught, they might even be able to ban your actual wow account..."
