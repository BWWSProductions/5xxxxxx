[T],Sunblock.,2010-05-11T09:13Z,You mean flash a the dvd?. Yes i know. done it 100 times. But it best if you find guides (google it). You will need hardware & software to make this happen. Or find a store that do it for you.

RROD is still with us. Not so much as before. And this is my third XBOX 360. I had XENON,FALCON and JASPER. And they all got RROD."
