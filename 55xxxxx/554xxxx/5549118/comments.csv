Do you know if this will play on iPad?  It wasn't listed on the compatible device on your page.

Thanks in advance."
,countryboy78,2010-05-21T14:38Z,"Icebane your rips are awesome.  I just find with your rips the video at times becomes a little choppy, but not really bad. I haven't had this choppy video issue with lifechanger, secretmyth etc...

It might be a codec isssue.  I'm running Windows XP Professional SP3.  

If it is a codec issue with your rips what codecs should I have installed on my computer?

Thanks!"
