All the noomas to date. 1-24.

Jesus lived with the awareness that God is doing something, right here, right now, and anybody can be a part of it. He encouraged his listeners to search, to question, to wrestle with the implications of what he was saying and doing. He inspired, challenged, provoked, comforted, and invited people to be open to Godâ€™s work in this world. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Jesus started discussions about what matters most, because for Jesus, God is always inviting us to open our eyes and join in. NOOMA is a series of short films that explore our world from a perspective of Jesus. NOOMA is an invitation to search, question, and join the discussion.


Encoded specifically for iPad BUT will play on almost ANY device.

The encoding is particularly good with each video checked individually for quality. The SHE nooma is the only one that has any issue - the sync is out, and nothing seems to fix it. Sorry about that.



IF YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD, UPGRADE TO A PEX CAPABLE CLIENT.


IF YOU'RE NEW TO TORRENTS, LET ME EXPLAIN. YOU DON'T JUST STOP YOUR TORRENT CLIENT ONCE YOU HAVE IT ALL. YOU LET IT RUN A FEW DAYS, OR LONGER, SO OTHERS CAN ALSO GET IT FROM YOU. THIS IS CALLED SEEDING. SO PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN. PERMANENTLY WOULD BE GOOD TOO!
