Two soldiers are sent to find a satellite that has crash-landed
near a small town in Utah called Piedmont; but someone has removed it from where it
landed. The soldiers make their way to town in order to find it. But what they find in 
"the armpit of nowhere" is unexpected and horrible. Dead bodies are lying about 
everywhere. Suddenly an old man runs up to their Humvee screaming for help. But it's 
too late - for the soldiers. Within moments they are stricken by something unknown. 
And then they're dead. Soon, Dr. Jeremy Stone will lead a crack team of scientists as 
they work feverishly in a secret, state-of-the-art laboratory to discover what has 
killed the citizens of Piedmont, and why two survivors seem to have been immune. 
They have little time. Whatever wiped out the people of the small town is spreading 
across the country and killing everyone in its path. Meanwhile, a rogue television 
reporter battles with sinister government agents to learn the truth about the disaster.
