10x"
,ettin,2011-02-04T03:01Z,There are no official checksums for these versions so you have no way of knowing if these are untouched. 
,xueimel,2011-11-28T16:08Z,"volume license is a corporate thing. MS does it so that companies don't have to keep track of hundreds if not thousands of individual licenses on their computers. 

the official hashes are listed on Microsoft's website https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/default.aspx if you view the details on a given image it contains hashes."
