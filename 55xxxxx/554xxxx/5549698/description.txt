Should the FBI been able to prevent the recent May 2010 Times Square almost terrorist attack ?
Incompetence ? ?? Illuminati ? New World Order ?  NWO ?
The gang at McDonalds controlling the world ?
Or just a plain Simpson mystery man up to no good ?
Let "Conspiracy Cargo"  set you straight
No grass talk here for sure
