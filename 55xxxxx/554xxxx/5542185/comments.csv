,g8aso,2010-05-08T10:52Z,"There are a lot of people who upload a FLAC  album as 1 long track with a cue file to split, I wonder why then, when we have a mix album, it is invariably split into tracks, so you can't re-create the original mix effect................just wondering, but you can't really complain about free music!"
,triolan,2010-05-08T12:03Z,"You are certainly right, but I collected this collection from many albums and did not see sense to unite all it in an image of a disk
(FLAC+CUE)
