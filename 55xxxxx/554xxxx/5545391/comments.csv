National Geographic photographer Reza journeys to Afghanistan to seek a portrait of a nation... and comes face to face with a people on the edge of an uncertain future. Few journalists have come as close to the wars in Afghanistan as Reza, whose photos chronicle more than two decades of fighting. Now, with Afghanistan again heading into prolonged war, Reza follows his photographs from the past on a quest for a new image of Afghanistan today. This is a story of fragile hopes amidst very real fear.

Two days before the 9/11 strike on the World Trade Center, two al-Qaida operatives posing as journalists set off a bomb that killed Ahmad Shah Massoud, the man who led the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan.

An Iranian who prefers to be known just as Reza took a series of famous pictures of Massoud when he was fighting the Soviets. In this special, Reza goes back to the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan to fulfil the promise he made to Massoud that one day he would come back and hold an exhibition of his work.

But not in a slick gallery in Kabul; Reza treks deep into Tajik country to where Massoud was killed. Along the way, he seeks the one photograph that will epitomise the Afghanistan of today."
