As numerous news crews focused on the obstructive movement of ash clouds and reported on the woes of stranded travelers, National Geographic Channel's film crew were on the ground in Iceland, documenting dramatic natural phenomena leading up to, during and after the volcanos two eruptions, first of which occurred on March 20 and the second and larger of which came on April 14.

The National Geographic Channel's crew was the only one to cover the story from the beginning, and got first access via helicopter to the glacier atop the volcano. Enduring extremely risky conditions at the edge of the enormous crater, they captured incredible, unparalleled footage of the volcano as it was erupting, spewing fire and ash into the air. Every 10 minutes, the eruption's gigantic sonic boom hit them, rocking them to the core.

The crew also filmed other dangerous circumstances they faced, including being trapped the road ahead of them disappeared, either due to massive flooding that washed away the blacktop or because seemingly inpenitrable walls of dense ash cloud obscured their way, causing them to lose all sense of direction and making it difficult for them to breathe.

This timely documentary also presents interviews with eyewitnesses, with geologists who collect samples of lava and ash and analyze them, and with other experts who discuss volcanic activity and its global impact, including the disruption of air travel. Whether you or a loved one were effected directly by the eruption of Eyjafjallajokul, this is a documentary you'll want to see.
