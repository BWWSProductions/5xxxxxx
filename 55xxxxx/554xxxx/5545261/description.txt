                    Death in Venice.                         
                    Behind-the-scenes series about the making of  
                    Doctor Who. The cast and crew get a trip  
                    abroad. But not to Venice, because as episode  
                    writer Toby Whithouse explains, modern day  
                    Venice doesn't really look like 16th century  
                    Venice anymore. Instead the episode is shot in  
                    Trogir, a small medieval town in Croatia that  
                    is the spitting image of 16th century Venice.  
                    However, Matt Smith and Toby Whithouse do go to  
                    Venice and meet up with Francesco Da Mosto, who  
                    gives them a unique tour on his boat.
