Matthew Broderick stars as the title character, an underachieving high school senior in the Chicago suburbs whoâ€™s become a master at skipping school by pretending heâ€™s sick, much to the chagrin of his older sister, Jeannie (Jennifer Grey), and the aforementioned Principal Rooney. One fine spring day he convinces his uptight best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck), and his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), to join him in taking a day off, â€œborrowingâ€ Cameronâ€™s fatherâ€™s 1961 Ferrari and embarking on an adventure through downtown Chicago. While Ferris and his friends gallivant about the city, Rooney and Jeannie set out to prove that Ferris is a faker, with hilarious results.
