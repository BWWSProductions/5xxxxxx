Thirteen years after his last stand-up performance, prolific comic Sinbad takes the stage of the Club Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, California to do what he does best â€“ keep an audience in stitches. Itâ€™s a whole different world than it was the last time Sinbad performed, and in addition to filling his fans in on what heâ€™s been up to over the past decade, he also takes time to poke some fun at the president, comment on the state of the economy, and reflect on his relationship status.
