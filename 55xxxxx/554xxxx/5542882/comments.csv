,giannisbeast,2010-05-11T11:47Z,ok thanks 
,don_cannon,2010-05-13T23:51Z,"my emulator is going really slow, can anyone help me with this please?"
,ImNotLikeYou,2010-05-14T04:46Z,"You have to change the settings around. And just to tell you, this runs on your RAM."
,timmyxthexwolfx,2010-05-20T23:27Z,i cant seem to get it to save right
,McHunterXL,2010-06-10T19:50Z,How i need to download?
,ImRetroxD,2010-06-20T01:23Z,"@ImNotLikeYou: Dude, this really sucks. It great in the beginning, but it keeps freezes and fucks up the game. ATM I have 3 save slots. They're all fucked up (I can load them, but the first one freezes after 3-4 steps, the second is black-screened and the third is bugged (Me and my pokemon is invisible and all other humans are invisible as well)).

This game brought me back to the old days, but now - after hours of gaming on this one - I just want to throw it all away.. I'll go try another, 'cause this one sucks.. I'll give it one more chance."
,supanut2000,2010-07-26T05:14Z,"Cause apprenly pepole here talk bullshit...if you emulator slow then go to menu-->config--frameskip and set it to 5, then push the = key. Also go to 3D settings and set it to soft resterizer.
Still slow? fuck you...your comps sucks...buy a new comp with W7 or if your comp has W7 and it slow then downgrade to winxp...Vista/W7sucks...!"

,Dacre117,2011-03-15T02:09Z,"Good at first but freezes randomly and turns the guy into a pixelated version of a girl with the a marill following?
Wtf man lol"
,Makkie1337,2011-07-10T16:37Z,nice torret :)
,Zeptinune,2011-07-24T21:25Z,"This doesn't work guys. There is absolutely no known working computer/emulator/rom version of Heart Gold and Soul Silver working 100% at all. The copy protection has totally fucked the game. You can finish the game if you have the patience sit through thousands of black screen glitches, pixel glitches and random freezes. Also because of the glitches if you turn the game off or have to do a reset due to a glitch your save file can get corrupt forcing you to start again. It's not worth it. Go play pokĂÂŠmon black and white."
