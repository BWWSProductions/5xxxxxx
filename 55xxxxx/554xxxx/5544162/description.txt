An amazing package of work from George Duke -- 6 of his legendary fusion albums for MPS Records, including the never-reissued double-length set Solus/The Inner Source! That incredible album is worth the price of the package alone -- as it begins with some sublime trio work from Duke, rooted in jazz but already stretching out in amazing ways -- then moves into some even hipper Latin-styled grooves, with Jerome Richardson on reeds and Luis Gasca on a bit of trumpet! Other albums in the set are equally great -- and trace Duke's evolution from straighter jazz into funky freer fusion and soul -- an incredible musical shift that's presented on the albums Faces In Reflection, Feel, I Love The Blues She Heard My Cry, The Aura Will Prevail, and Liberated Fantasies -- each of them classics in their own right, presented together wonderfully here in this complete MPS package! The set is amazing -- with a whopping 64 titles in all, and complete notes on all the music -- including some recollections from Duke himself.
