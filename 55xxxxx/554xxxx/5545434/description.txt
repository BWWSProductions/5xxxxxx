In a world where a critical opinion matters, Infinity Ends sheds a light onto their beliefs of what is wrong, twisted, curious of beautiful, writing songs about matters that shapes and creates our lives, such as personal struggles, battles to be fought, choices to be made and beliefs to be protected Infinity Ends is a band consisting of three individuals, which grants them immense freedom and personal space but also encourages each person to occupy multiple functions within the band.
