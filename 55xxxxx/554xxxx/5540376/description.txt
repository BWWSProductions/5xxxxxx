          Stevie Ray Vaughan was a great guitarist, but he had trouble making consistent       
          albums. Greatest Hits rectifies that problem by collecting all of his best-known     
          tracks, from "Pride and Joy" to "Crossfire." Not only is it a terrific introduction, 
          it's his most consistent album, demonstrating exactly why he was one of the most     
          important guitarists of the '80s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide

                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
