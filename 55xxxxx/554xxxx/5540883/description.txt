"Babyfather" is a song from the English soul  and R&B group Sade. It is the second single from their sixth studio album, Soldier Of Love.

The music video which sees people wearing bright-colored outfit is directed by Sophie Muller who also took picture for the single's cover art. It premiered on May 4, 2010 and it features frontwoman Sade Adu  as a homemaker who is doing daily chores from cooking to washing dishes to doing the laundry. 

In this Reggae-flavored number, Adu sings of a male figure who can be the father of a woman's child and a strong male role model, without necessary being a life mate. Frontwoman Sade Adu told to People that "Babyfather," is "about how great it is to be a parent, what a great honor and privilege that is, and what a terrible thing that is to waste,". "As long as you feel good about yourself, you can be a good parent, and then it becomes an endless fruitful cycle," she says. As for the sound of the new song, "I wanted it to sound quite rough and scrappy, not too honed," says the Grammy-winning singer, 51. With a little whimsy mixed in, too. "The beginning," says Sade, "feels like the ice cream van coming down the street".
