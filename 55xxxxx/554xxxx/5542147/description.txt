This is the most solid snowboard movie I've seen. These guys are basically flown to the sickest places on the planet (New Zealand, Jackson Hole, Canada, Alaska) to create fresh lines after being dropped from helicopters. The aerial camera-work is solid, and the film includes beautiful shots of the mountains and the wildlife in these areas. The sponsors definitely paid up for this one; the guys are hitting massive kickers on otherwise untouched slopes.

No wasted time on rails and jibs. Just big mountain riding and big air. There is a short segments which shows the guys at different big air competitions as well - those could be left out.

The soundtrack is excellent.
