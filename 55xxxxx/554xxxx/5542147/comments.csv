Sick film. 

Also suggest seeing Brainfarm's latest: ""The Art of Flight""

Both are sick. Love park and rails and all that jazz, but am a larger fan of powder, big airs, and freeriding on steep mountains and the dangerous stuff I typically put myself into here. (But not as hard core as the stuff these guys do. WOWzers)"
