,throwing_wheel,2010-05-07T07:00Z,"Yeah, what is the meaning of that, when there's 300-plus downloaders and the file is unplyable or a gimmick to generate web traffic or worse, infected?  Why don't even one or two people comment?

This one is not only real, it's as real as you are.  It is also true, because what it purports to be is in agreement with what it actually is.  Which of you are like that?"

,MomoShab,2010-05-08T03:39Z,"There is (was?) a clown with a green skull named GoodFilms who posted nothing but bogus TV torrents that were WMVs that wanted you to download a ""FLV Player"" which was likely malware/trojans. He'd always have the most seeds up the first night a show aired. I don't know how he got a skull, but he definitely wasn't trustworthy."
,Sattori,2010-05-08T19:43Z,This episode is so much better than the ones before. Maybe (Hopefully) they can scrape through the bad scripts now. But not in this season I think.
