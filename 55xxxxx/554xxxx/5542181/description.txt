Ubuntu Complete Remix 10.04 Live DVD has been released (Friday 7th May 2010)! As expected, all packages have been updated to the latest as of the day of release, and comes with Adobe Flash, Java, Mp3 support, Firefox 3.6, OpenOffice 3.2 Suite, Gimp, Pidgin, programmer IDE's and editors with syntax highlighting, a collection of games, and a lot more applications as you would expect with a 1.9 GB 'complete remix'.
