      Ã› Ã› While in the competition stages, we had at least a decent      Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› amount of respect for the work Razor1911 and RELOADED normally Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› do. Now during the last weeks they have for sure lost our last Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› lines of respect.                                              Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 1. RELOADED, get some balls and bring your stupidity out in    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    the open. At least get someone who we don't know to write   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    your FAKE nfos for the FAKE content of the Assassins Creed  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    2 nfo release. The writing style is so obvious, that        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    several non scenere already caught who was behind it.       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Also, when you plan to make such FAKE nfo statements        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    releases, then at least cover your tracks of it's origin.   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Our FTP scanning logs, verify that the release was first    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    upped and spread by a certain RELOADED affiliated person.   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Furthermore we have already guessed your purpose of all     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    this dissing towards us. It's obvious that you want the     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    public, as well as the scene to believe that our 100%       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    working Assassins Creed 2 release is nuked, so that you can Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    make path for yet another dupe. Do we even have to mention  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Just Cause 2?                                               Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    RELOADED, your lies and propaganda can help you boost your  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    ego beyond your talent, but eventually your lies and        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    propaganda will stand out as the most talented about you.   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› 2. Razor1911, you took the liberity to use bigger words, than  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    you can handle. You obviously haven't even looked at our    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Assassins Creed 2 crack.                                    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    You judge our Assassins Creed 2 crack by reading public     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    boards and FAKE nfos with FAKE content really made you look Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    nonworthy to use the blade's group name. It's so obvious    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    that you're not the sharpest blade in the drawer.           Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Claiming you was the first to crack the new Ubisoft         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    protection, is just so ridiculous, so much actually, that   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    we're infact still laughing since you released Settlers 7.  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    You even praised the new Ubisoft DRM, as it apparently to   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    you, gives the scene a chance for redemption to bring back  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    the good old days of REAL cracking. You're so full of       Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    bullshit with that Settlers 7 nfo, that you're starting to  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    sound like RELOADED.                                        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› For the people with no cracking knowledge, then we will        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› explain a few things about the Ubisoft DRM:                    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› a) Ubisoft DRM can't even be compared with protections of the  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    "good" old days.                                            Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› b) Razor's "crack" isn't really any different from our         Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    Assassins Creed 2 crack, it's the emulated data that makes  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    the differences.                                            Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› c) Razor just moved the Ubisoft launcher into the main folder  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    of the Settlers 7 game and patched it to work from there.   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› d) To make these "cracks" work correctly you still have to     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    gather and emulate the data that are being sent/recieved    Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›    from the communication between the game and your PC.        Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› The cracking method is still the same for each title. It's the Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› handling of the data being sent/recieved between the Ubisoft   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› servers, and the decryption methods of it, that takes time to  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› do properly.                                                   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Obviously, that has nothing to do with exterme skill, nor has  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› it anything to do with the REAL protections of the past. It's  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› also getting more obvious that 1+9+1+1 marks the IQ level of   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› whole Razor.                                                   Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› The real old blade, must feel very ashamed now.                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› Note to anybody else:                                          Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã›                                                                Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› This will be the last nfo, where we defend our Ubisoft DRM     Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› work. We're here to compete, even if we lost a lot of faith in Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› the two mention groups above. We're here for scene matters and Ã› Ã›

      Ã› Ã› Beware with the trigger, as you never know if the bullet will  Ã› Ã›
      Ã› Ã› hit yourself in the end!                                       Ã› Ã›
