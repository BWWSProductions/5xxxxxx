,Horizon88,2010-06-20T18:47Z,"I'm seeding it as fast as I can, but it's obviously quite a large torrent.  It doesn't help that people don't seed worth a damn on public/semi-public trackers.  

I've uploaded 243GB of this torrent to leechers between TPB and Demonoid, and there are two seeds from Demonoid and no seeds from TPB.  

If you're going to be an ingrate about seed speed, aim your ire at the right people (namely, yourselves) or use my freely-given script to rip them on your own."
