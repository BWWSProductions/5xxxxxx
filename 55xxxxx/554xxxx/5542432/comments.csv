,OrpheusDude,2011-03-04T00:19Z,"PLEASE please please list the orchestra and conductor when you upload classical music!!!  The link which you post shows an album cover of music by another composer.  The extensive notes (in Italian) give a biography and a history of Teldec's recording methods, but the conductor and orchestra are not mentioned anywhere.  Teldec has released several different recordings of ""Sacre."""
,OrpheusDude,2011-03-04T00:40Z,"OK: I've determined that it is Lorin Maazel conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, from a Teldec CD recorded circa 1990.  This torrent is in FLAC format, not mp3."
