,neogaidenx,2010-05-25T15:37Z,"To OSAMA700:
This is what you call DVD RIP. Full and untouched. Although i don't know why people call a modified/encoded/compressed or whatever else a dvdrip, that's not a rip, that's a junkyard of low quality poopshit."
,neogaidenx,2010-05-25T15:38Z,"I've been using 2Lion's Full DVDRips, and none of them i downloaded is anywhere near low quality. All of them are good."
