,on_the_edge,2010-05-11T16:46Z,thanks for the upload yockner-benzo. great vid quality.
,listenherenow,2010-05-19T13:01Z,"I see this is made for ps3 and other types of playback are listed as well - I am curious how it will play through a USB jump drive on my divx player though - 

  so I am going to try that. 
Thanks for the upload. i can't believe there is only one comment.
  i will come back and let ya'll know how this goes.
  Thanks again, I just need it so my kiddo can watch it for a report for school.  I will like seeing it again as well though :O) "
,listenherenow,2010-05-21T07:28Z,"m2ts file extension - 

 I am not sure what to do to for this - apparently it will not play correctly on a computer - choppy and not understandable. looks like a great upload as far as clarity- 

sucks that my hopes that it would play on a divx player are completly dashed. 

  Thanks anyway.  back to the drawing board on this one. "
,POTMONSTER,2010-05-29T01:03Z,use VLC PLAYER to play this.. works a treat

,riico1,2010-07-01T16:58Z,Cant get subtitles on it  :(
,echris,2010-07-09T14:47Z,"listenherenow at 2010-05-21:nnFurther to your comment, m2ts is the same file format as your standard bluray disk.nnThe uploaders have made it less than 4.7 gig so that you can burn this to a single blank DVD and play it through your Bluray player.nn------nndeedzeh at 2010-06-1:nnIn regards to your comment, the reason why it looks like it\'s the same resolution is because I can almost guarantee your TV/PC is not 1080p resolution - if your max screen output is 576p or 460i than that is the maximum resolution you\'ll achieve.nn-----nnComment to the uploader:nnYour a rockstar - keep \'em coming. Thanks heaps."
,Donald-X,2010-08-15T19:43Z,Are the subtitles for non english parts hardcoded?
,ianisthis,2010-08-28T04:31Z,"greetings. as always, thanks for the upload. be warned: this is not HD quality. dvd at 4 gb is better than this. no offense intended to the uploaded, just info for the masses. have a grateful day."

,Ghostmb76,2010-10-23T05:01Z,"And for those people sayin its bad quality, Your just retarded. You have to see the Moive threw a HD TV Running at enough HrZ And HDMI and Digital Optical. You Cant Just run it threw a normal SD TV. Nubs...."
,aku77,2010-11-20T13:50Z,"I must agree with deedzeh "" video quality doesn't even look HD looks like dvd quality in a bigger resolution."" 
& ianisthis ""this is not HD quality. dvd at 4 gb is better than this"" 

Really video quality is too poor to be FullHD 1080p. It looks like a DVD video with upscale 1080p resolution technique.

V = 5
A = 8
M = 7

My System..
-Panasonic VIERA TH-P65V10K 65"" FullHD 1080p
600Hz Plasma TV.
-Yamaha RX-V667 7.2-Channel Digital Home Theater Receiver.

-AMD Phenom II X555BE, unlock 4core,  overclock @3.9GHz.
-16GB DDR3 2000MHz
-XFire 2X Saphire Radeon HD6870 overclock @1100MHz

all conection via HDMI

,osriccc,2011-01-09T17:39Z,Can anobody upload screenshots (in close and wide shots) of this rip? I really want to download a reasonable file sized 1080p one but I'm worried about the comments.
