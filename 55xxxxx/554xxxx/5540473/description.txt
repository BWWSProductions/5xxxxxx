"Northwest Passage" 

Peter teams up with a local law enforcement official, 
Sheriff Mathis (guest star Martha Plimpton), on a 
serial murder investigation with ties to Newton 
(guest star Sebastian Roch). Meanwhile, Walter copes 
with the possibility of being sent back to St. 
Claire's, and someone from the "other side" pays a 
visit.

Enjoy :)
