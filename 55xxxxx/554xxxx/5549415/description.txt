|   |  Optimo Espacio, aka Glasgow's Jonnie Wilkes and Keith McIvor,      |   |
|   |  head up a long overdue and completely crucial installation for     |   |
|   |  the Fabric mix series, just in time to mark the end of the         |   |
|   |  legendary clubnight the pair have been running since 1997. In      |   |
|   |  their Optimo Espacio guise the legendary pair of record            |   |
|   |  collector/DJs cherry-pick across 30 years of electronic dance      |   |
|   |  music and make it all fit like a bespoke pair of Italian           |   |
|   |  underwear. While rooted in the drive and immediacy of early Italo  |   |
|   |  and Industrial disco, they draw connections between old and new    |   |
|   |  styles, like the inspirational blend of Roni Griffith's            |   |
|   |  rare-as-f*ck Italo killer 'Spys' with Levon Vincent's 'Love        |   |
|   |  Technique', or bumbumbox beats like Rebolledo's 'Amigos CÃ³meme'    |   |
|   |  with The Minister's 'Jack Your Bodey House Your Mind' and the      |   |
|   |  exceptional mainline of Roska's 'Feeline' into a terrific South    |   |
|   |  American Cumbia from 'Cumbia Moderna De Soledad'. It's blends      |   |
|   |  like this and the Desire 'Don't Call' into Crazy Cousins           |   |
|   |  'Inflation' that effortlessly make 90% of DJs today sound boring,  |   |
|   |  lazy and narrow minded in comparison. Next to equally important    |   |
|   |  installments from Villalobos and Autonomic, we reckon this is one  |   |
|   |  of the very best Fabric mixes yet.  Very highly Recommended!       |   |
