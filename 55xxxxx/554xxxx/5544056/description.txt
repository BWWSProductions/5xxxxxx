Work Done:

Here we go with our version of Kick Ass.We took the original dvd-r and encoded from there 
.we noticed the saturation was a little low on it so we increased to get the colors right.
brightness and everything else was left untouched.also we left the ac3 audio in it.you dont 
get those often on R5s.we want to thank elektrika for the release.as with out them we 
wouldnt be releasing this.hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.
