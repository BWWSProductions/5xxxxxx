,groundbreaker59,2010-05-24T14:53Z,"Just Perfect!!
First i was little sceptic for this, but when i installed it, man it was awsome, with its new graphics, sound and layout. Had to activate it with an activator, (used 7loader by Hazar 1.6). System worsk like a charm, and the speed is much better than my preveous version of 7. Had just one problem when burning it to a disk. My system didnt se the file as an iso, but only as a file, but i managed to find it, and burn it with ImgBurn by just pressing show ""all files"" in imgburn when burning it to an dvd.

as i said, the system is awsome, and incredible, and i recomend it. activation was simple without any problems, just remmeber when uptating the system with windows uptade, do not, i repeat, do not dowload the ""KB971033"" uptade fom windows, in fact just hide it from the update menu, because if you have activated the ystem with a loader, and downloading this uptade, you will fall into a ""windows is not genuine"" ambush. Do not let that happen.

Cheers, and thx for the great upload MrExtreame "
,phatfunk,2010-06-07T01:51Z,you need to put a full stop infront of the ISO in the file name for anything to be able to see it as a compatible file. Torrent works good so far. good man Mrextreame
,problade,2010-06-10T05:14Z,"Do NOT download this ""windows"" it looks as bad as it is just possible!!! May be works a bit faster and has lots of gadgets but is it that useful when your desktop and all staffs look like KAKA or poop or peace of shit! I registered here only to say that! DO NOT EVEN TRY THIS! and for developer I wanna say do not make people to waist there time!!!"
,kopfknartzen,2010-06-15T16:35Z,"thx for this nice release i can just say a strong and perfect enhanced OS,it works fine on my pc+notebook even no problems with 7loader/activators...BUT WHY CANNOT I ACTIVATE THIS VERSION WITH ALL TRIED LOADERS IF THE PC USES AN ASUS P6T DELUXE V2 MAINBOARD (Help :( i need a solution)"
,groundbreaker59,2010-06-22T00:35Z,"Quite weird that you cant activate because of your motherboard. Have you like tried uptating your drivers on the pc, or like first recover your important files on the hard drive, then wipe out everything on it, and then isntalling windows on a clean drive?"
,hiteshbisht16,2010-06-24T18:33Z,"even im getting some bios flash error when i try touse 7 loader activator theni used removewat22.exe and now its wrking fine i can even dwnld updates.

,coolluv01,2010-09-13T23:22Z,how do u activate this??????????
,SolidMario7,2010-09-26T19:36Z,"The perfect activator for this is chew-wga v0.9. I should should know because all the other loaders (that i know of) bricked my ASUS N80Vb (had to use manufacturers recovery disk and launch it from BIOS). This hack has far less risk and can even pass all genuine test. WITH ALL updates added. I recommend you use RemoveWatermark v0.8 with chew-wga v0.9 if you happen see any watermarks. But for some reason chew-wga v0.9 won't work for the real/unmodded windows 7. And yes, google these programs, there everywhere."
