The denoiser part of it made it rather worse than better. A hear a lot of dynamic artifacts. I think to upload the tunes without any sound processing would be better. 
by the way. What means RTR?"
,k7sparky,2010-05-10T01:56Z,"Darn if I knew you had it I would not have bothered.  I converted over 3K LP, 78, Cassettes, 8 Tracks, laser disks and RTR. Unfortunately it was a learning experience.  I wish I had bought a bigger drive sooner and kept all the original wave files.  As always hindsight it 20/20.  RTR Reel to Reel.  The Roberts 5000 is the best I have used.  With selective parts replacement on the boards and a lab set up it is better than 20 to 20K +/- 3DB both channels.  My original was stolen and it took me many years to find a replacement.  I have read most of the other RTR specs and lab tested quite a few.  The original TT was an original Rek -O- Kut with an 18"" tone arm, Pickering and elliptical also stolen about 1974."
