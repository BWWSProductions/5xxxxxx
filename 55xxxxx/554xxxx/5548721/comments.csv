In Options > Hotkey tab, Recent Clip Up and Recent Clip Down section, setup Ctrl+Shift+Up and Ctrl+Shift+Down keys (click in the empty box, press Ctrl, Shift, and the Up Arrow key simultaneously).  When you quickly want to access recently used clips, just press those keys.

It's a terrific program.

Thanks Victory144 !!!"
