,Life Is A Haze,2010-05-17T00:48Z,"Hey, I greatly appreciate you providing this content on here, but I'm new to this whole torrent thing and I'm not sure how to make sure I'm seeding and sharing properly so I can be fair and help everyone else. I really don't want to be a leecher but I'm not really sure what I'm doing. Is there any way that anyone on here can help me out?"
,Life Is A Haze,2010-05-17T01:11Z,"If someone wants to (or even can, I don't really know if there's anything you can tell me that might help) you can email me at da382546pyro1@sbcglobal.net. I have over 150GB of music and other audio I'd gladly share with anyone who helps me figure out how to share it and download and seed other things on here."
