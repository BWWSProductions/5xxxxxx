,rainbowcarnage,2010-09-17T13:55Z,"I'm having some trouble getting the audio to work, anyone else? Tried VLC, Winamp and WMP so far but no luck. Probably overlooking something obvious..."
,xtorrentaddictx,2011-02-25T14:26Z,"A/V - 10/10 (applies for all.)
Dont hesitate on this one, th quality (for a dvdrip) is perfect on ALL of them, and the down speed is VERY high, took me like 6 hours!
thx a lot neonrainbow, CHEERS!"
,moovyman,2011-04-22T20:17Z,"Let your up speed fly, so I can monkey around.   Please?"
,ripper564,2011-05-15T19:53Z,great collection of films. cheers for the upload. do you agree that C.G.I Ruined it all. they should have kept it all puppets and masks. it was more realistic and i could get into it better. the first one was the best. cheers man :)
,ripper564,2011-05-15T19:57Z,@rainbowcarnage. just to tell you mate - VLC player is a virus that hijacks your system. dont use it trust me. just crack WMP and update all the codects for it.
,frostyfreak40,2011-07-13T23:01Z,"Love you very much for these movies! Brings back fond memories of summer nights at the drive in with mom and dad! Fried chicken from KFC and soda in the cooler and popcorn from home. Many thanks, I will seed for a long time!"
,bensteele,2011-11-12T23:14Z,Great torrent! Thanks.
,miked45419,2012-03-21T19:58Z,"Great torrent, but I think you missed a movie, Return to the Planet of (or is it from?) the Apes."
,miked45419,2012-03-21T20:53Z,"My bad, the movie I mentioned was animated, you did get all the movies in the series.  Quality is pretty good, considering the original date of movie release."
,pumpman109,2012-04-30T00:07Z,No mention of Hard Codes Subs! Very annoying. Thanks for all the hard work uploader and TPB
