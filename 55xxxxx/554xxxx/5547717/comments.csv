,somedude.1001,2010-05-10T15:49Z,"Is this real? Kinda early even for a leak.

And how the A/V?"
,MitsEvX,2010-05-11T21:07Z,"Great video quality, but the audio is a bit noisy and weak! ;)"
,AidyD,2010-05-16T02:08Z,"Seriously.. 283 seeders and only 3 comments..

Is this worth downloading for decent quality?

How is the audio noisy and weak?

Thats like saying 'my ice cream is hot and cold'.

Its a contradiction....

Can anyone say, in black and white... This is worth downloading 

V - ?
A - ?

Please!!"
,MitsEvX,2010-05-18T13:42Z,"@AidyD: It's not a contradiction, but I could have be en more clear: I meant to say that the voices are a bit inaudible and that increasing to a higher volume results in a crackling sound......you can compare the sound with the sound of a cam version, but it's just a little bit better:

V: 9
A: 5

It's worth downloading and the best copy so far out yet! ;-)    "
,MitsEvX,2010-05-18T13:44Z,"And yes, I agree with the sync problem!"
,Captain_Planet,2010-05-23T04:25Z,"Thanks guys, I was going to DL this, but with my little amount of bandwidth I will wait another week to see if a copy with audio matching the video quality is released.
