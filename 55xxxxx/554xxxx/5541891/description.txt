The Tudors chronicles the period of Henry VIII's reign in which his effectiveness as King is tested by international conflicts as well as political intrigue in his own court, while the pressure of fathering a male heir compels him to reject his wife Katherine of Aragon[8] for Anne Boleyn. He also has a string of affairs, and fathers a son, Henry, by Elizabeth Blount.
