Translated from the Spanish 
DICCIONARIO DE SIMBOLOS TRADICIONALES

The result is a volume which can either be used as a work of reference, or 
simply read for pleasure and instruction. There are many entries in this dictionaryâ€” 
those on Architecture, Colour, Cross, Graphics, Mandala, Numbers, Serpent, 
Water, Zodiac, to give a few examplesâ€”which can be read as independent essays.
FOREWORD x 
But in general the greatest use of the volume will be for the elucidation of those 
many symbols which we encounter in the arts and in the history of ideas. Man, 
it has been said, is a symbolizing animal; it is evident that at no stage in the 
development of civilization has man been able to dispense with symbols. Science 
and technology have not freed man from his dependence on symbols: indeed, it 
might be argued that they have increased his need for them. In any case, symbology 
itself is now a science, and this volume is a necessary instrument in its study.
