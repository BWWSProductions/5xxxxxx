There have been many efforts over time and around the world to wake up and get what many call the "ecological conscience." Brochures, radio and TV spot are recruited to the proper viewing, ecological practices, to act as role models to have a greener lifestyle.

Whatever the organization behind these awareness efforts, the messages are usually the same:

    * Separated the garbage and recycling your everything (special bins for paper, glass, aluminum, batteries, etc.)
    * Make savings in electricity (replacing light bulbs with new economic, etc.)
    * Make saving water (do not let the faucet run unnecessarily, drinking patterns, washing, etc.)
    * Make fuel economy (use public transportation, do not make unnecessary movements, etc.)
    * Etc.

Sure, most of these actions are legitimate and no one can doubt that following these tips we can, at least temporarily, to mitigate the rape of the planet.

The remainder, however, when education and the media do not display the "eco" lifestyle, raise another lifestyle: the consumer. And no reason for it. In our economic system, consumption is a key factor for development and since the exponentially increasing growth is necessary for the operation of the system need to resort to overuse of not confronted with a karampinati recession. And of course, not just over-runs counter to the "ecological" way of life but is the main cause of destruction of the planet.

So one would assume that the most correct course of action is to address the problem at its roots, namely the overthrow of the established political-economic system. What is the meaning of individual effort to change the way consumption in a system based on exponential consumption?

Yet, the "green campaign", some deliberately and some unwittingly, not simply affect the underlying cause, but they are a deceptive and subliminal message. Proposing actions only change the way power or eco-activism (recycling, become a volunteer to rescue turtle, etc.) makes us immediately blamed for the destruction of the planet and responsible to rectify the situation, rather than fighting the real causes, but looking only Our balance between the consumer and the ecological standard of living. Another pseftodilimma us tired ...

And here comes the "Wake Up - Freak Out", the video is the occasion of this publication. This is a 10 minute video animator Leo Murray on climate change, which 'run over' the other day when plagal wrote a related post. Apart from the beautiful artistic presentation of the (acquired) arguments, so was pleasantly surprised by the way which suggests that within a few hours I made very Greek subtitles now to find time to post it here. Watch it and spread the word:
