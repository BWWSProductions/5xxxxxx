,frankiejankie,2010-05-11T14:10Z,"tdmk1, now that albiondean has decided to turn his back on F1, is there any chance that you can provide the three practice sessions?

It's very cool to have an archive of an entire weekend's on track action.

In any case, thank you so much for your uploads. I was hanging out for the post race forum. :)"
