,tehburn,2010-05-09T14:48Z,"Packaged in folder labelled ep 9, video file is labelled as ep 8 and is actually episode 1?
Mistake or just fake idiot"
,RandomZero,2010-05-09T14:53Z,"I just downloaded the x286 rip from a different website, which was labeled 01/09 all the way through but really turned out to be ep1.
This rip could very well be what you indicated, but it's probably not ep09."
,seriosbrad,2010-05-09T21:06Z,"There is only 8 episodes in Season 1.   Thus ""Episode 9"" is simply a re-run of Episode 1 !

Obviously a mistake of ""TvTeam"" group, it's just a habit of routine to capture and upload the show.  "
,KevMovieMan,2010-05-14T16:25Z,"Guys COME ON U SHOULDA BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE THIS ONE 1 ON UR OWN!!!!

Pure Pwnage only has an 8 episode listing on the showcase site and IMDB. There is no episode 9..."
