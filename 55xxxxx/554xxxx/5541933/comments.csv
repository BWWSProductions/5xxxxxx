,jer4251,2010-05-13T20:05Z,"how do i go about changing the audio to make it work on my 360?  most mp4s work just fine.  i think its the 6 channel audio causing the problem.  i need to convert just the audio.  

thanks"
,reel2real,2010-05-14T01:29Z,"Why would you want to watch it on an XBOX? why not just use your pc. Anyway, whatever the case there is a very goo free video converter that will probably do the trick known as a anvsoft any video converter. Its free, easy to use and pretty quick. You may jus tneed to convert the whole thing to avi or something. Good luck!"
,jer4251,2010-05-14T17:16Z,"i stream them from my pc to my xbox to watch in hd. i tried anysoft and it made the file down to 1 gb and put borders around the movie, completely crap quality.  i had a version over 2 gig that was good, but i wanted better, i ended with with a 11 gb mkv file, which i couldnt use, then i found this mp4, and i though to myself, bingo.  until it didnt play because of the audio file.  just trying to fix it before i grab another copy  "
,reel2real,2010-05-14T20:40Z,"Ok sorry dude, so thats why people rip there audio down to stereo on 1080p movies. I never understood before why they'd sacrifice sound quality for a couple of megabytes when the file is so large.....pleasing the masses, never easy!"
,zirali,2010-05-15T02:20Z,"Hi there thanks so much for this I wanted to play it on my ps3 is that possible and I tried to copy this file onto my western digital hard-drive but it said there wasnt enough room is this due to the fact that the hard-drive is FAT32 instead of NTFS then it should read please help as I'm dying to watch it on my ps3 I need the info and thanks for the RIP reel2real.
:)"
,jer4251,2010-05-15T03:36Z,there are ps3 rips out there ready to watch
,reel2real,2010-05-15T03:42Z,"jer4251 is right, your probably best off just getting a smaller ps3 ready rip. Sorry bud this is mainly aimed at pc users with entainment system hooked up.

Peace"

,zendarx2,2010-06-09T17:48Z,"First I?d like to thank you for the download. Second, I opened the file with Winamp and only the audio played (the audio sounds great by the way) So what do I do to get the video to play? I?m looking into other mp4 players but not sure if I?m just doing something wrong of if I need a specific player. This is my first time with a bluray rip.
Thank you again for the download and any help would be much appreciated. "
