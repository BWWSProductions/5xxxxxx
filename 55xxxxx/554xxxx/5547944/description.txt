The Top 1000 Hip-Hop & Rap Songs of All-Time Pt. 4 #601 - 800

My contribution to Hip-Hop


This list is brought to you by: The Professor


**Because of problems uploading the torrent, I have split the collection into 5 parts. Each Part has 200 songs**


PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT AND READ THE DETAILS


Introduction:

The absolute best in the history of real hip-hop and rap; West Coast, East Coast, Dirty South, Midwest, Underground. If you're already a hip-hop head, this is a dream come true. You'll find all the old-school classics, the golden years from the 90's, the new soon-to-be-classics... it's all here. But no matter how much of a connoisseur you are, you will find some new tracks that will have your head noddin'. If you are pretty much a mainstream listener, get ready to have your world rocked. And if you are new to hip-hop... then that just ain't fair. If that's the case, then I wish I were you and I were downloading this torrent.

How this torrent came to be:

Creating this list took a ridiculous amount of time which I don't even want to guess at. Some of you have downloaded my Top 500 that I put out before this. I want to say a special thanks to all the love shown for the Top 500. Without the props and appreciation shown by ya'll, I would never have been inspired to create the Top 1000. With that said, the Top 1000 puts the last list to shame. And I hope everyone will keep showin' love. If you love it, drop a comment and let me know.

Some details:

Something helpful I've added to all of the songs for the Top 1000 is the year they came out. You can see what era you are listening to. As far as ID Tags for Ipod and the like -- it's a really a mixed bag. I'd say the majority are correct, but there are definitely a good portion that are not ID'ed. As far as quality - about 50% 160kbps to 320kbps, about 50% 128kbps. And to answer a simple question I often get - Are these in order? YES

In my defense:

Creating a Top 1000 Hip-Hop and Rap Songs collection is a daunting task to say the least. No matter how many hours I switch songs in and out and I find new music and old music, and I play with the order... it'll never be perfect, never really finished, because I haven't heard it all, and I'm just one head. I've tried my best to get it all in here, as fairly and un-biased as possible, and I hope my effort is appreciated. In specific, in response to those who will say Wayne and 50 and the like don't belong on the list: I'm not a fan, but c'mon now... they got some bangers.

Without further ado...
