,begna113,2010-05-08T10:13Z,"hey guys. i used hypercam 3 for thses recordings. please if you have any suggestions for my future recordings (as I plan to do the entire series) PLEASE tell me. HC3 is kinda annoying and not 100% quality i dont think. also, if there are better file types, etc that could be used, feel free to tell me."
,begna113,2010-05-09T08:41Z,ok. i had to stop seeding. for some reason my computer crashes every time i start seeding again. hope its out there enough for u guys to get it.
,begna113,2010-05-09T21:42Z,"just realized some of the audio is dead for some reason... sorry

i will go back and record those sections again once I finish with the photoshop one.

feedback is welcome. im using camtasia no also it seems much better than hypercam"

,pirate_11,2010-05-23T14:09Z,"dead audio in some parts, though the video quality is good.... is it possible to pm me when you updated this torrent??"
,pirate_11,2010-05-23T19:42Z,"now that you're done with photoshop, maybe you can start re-doing this torrent. thanks"

Any ideas?"
,slicedt,2010-05-24T22:33Z,"ok, it works if i use magnet link and if i enable peer exchange and dht."
,putnut00,2010-06-22T02:07Z,I can't get the video to work on quicktime or vlc on my mac.. sound works fine.
,princeshrey,2010-06-28T07:31Z,"Pls Upload the few part soon which having dead sound...!!! We will be glad for that

,charlie1-2-3-4,2010-06-30T06:15Z,"In re: to the software -- although the name could use some work, Camtasia is too damn good and fast to not use. New version is outstanding.

,pirator2010,2010-07-11T17:01Z,begna113 has doen his best to provide us with quality content but unfortunately the size is too big with compromised A/V quality. same tutorials are avaliable with more added videos which are lacking in this torrent with an astonishing size of just under 500MB.rnhttp://thepiratebay.org/search/flash%20professional%20cs5%20essential%20training/0/99/0rni was surprized to see small size but just finished d/l..it is exactly the same thing but still no exercise files...
,markw96,2010-08-19T13:25Z,any ideas as to when the audio is going to be sorted on this? ive watched quite a few but had to stop now because of the missing audio :(
,wessOlive,2010-09-19T11:03Z,"Is it possible for someone to please upload Lynda.com - Flash Professional CS5: Animation Projects? It is urgent for a varsity project and I cannot subscribe to Lynda from my country. Thanks!

Suggestion: use ScreenFlow if you are on a Mac!"
,xx__J3SSi,2010-12-06T23:01Z,"Hey, thanks very much! I'd be really grateful if you could upload Lynda Flash CS4 Creating a Portfolio? Been looking for it everywhere! Thanks again!"
,smallfoot,2010-12-27T08:58Z,"Dear Begna113

Thanx for all your efforts.. I may join the swarm later. "
,dhariuz,2010-12-30T06:43Z,heeey you can use ashampoo snap for recording..... 
,dhariuz,2010-12-30T06:46Z,you can reduce the size of the videos without losing quality and with the same extension too with mediaconverter free...just a tip but thaks i will start downlowding
,DiabolikalO,2011-01-26T15:14Z,"Videos 9, 10, and 11 have no audio. I've tried them in several different movie players and I've checked the audio tracks. Its just white noise. "
,cubstudios,2011-03-25T11:17Z,"I'm wondering why you screen-captured the movies? Screen-capture is the last resort when you can't work out a way of downloading the original movie files, but you tend to end up with large file sizes plus poor video quality. I'm running Snow Leopard, and none of the videos work properly with any video player (from VLC to QuickTime), and VLC reports that the link between video and audio has been broken but can't repair it. On my computer the videos play at 10 times their normal speed and often without any sound. I will have to trash all 5 gigs worth. At which point can I really say THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD?"
,cubstudios,2011-03-25T11:21Z,"If you want good complete software video training with exercise files, go to Demonoid instead."

,Necrotic__Love,2012-03-04T06:56Z,"The only one I was interested in is : ""Flash CS5: Creating a Simple Game for Android Devices.""

The only problem is that it was removed from ALL the sites.  Does anyone know if there is a stand-alone copy of that somewhere, otherwise I am hoping it is included in this one.  Thanks!"
,Necrotic__Love,2012-03-04T17:39Z,"Well that sucks, suddenly :""Lynda.com Flash Professional CS5 Animation Projects"" also vanished mid download.   So I am looking for that one again as well.  "
,no.user3,2012-05-30T21:42Z,"The video is by a screen capture. The video quality is good and the content is informative. However, the video fps is very bad and horrid. "
