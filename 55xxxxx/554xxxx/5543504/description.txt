This is the product of long hours of watching these videos and recording them for my own and your use. 

Please excuse the occasional popup box getting in the way or the mouse or the window disappearing (this was because i was at the same time navigating between applications on win 7), i did my best.

Enjoy.



Note: This is the "Essentials" video series. It does not include the EXTREMELY in depth tutorials. It basically teaches you how to use flash cs5 and how to do alot of the basic stuff. though it is still alot.


PS

hey guys. i used hypercam 3 for thses recordings. please if you have any suggestions for my future recordings (as I plan to do the entire series) PLEASE tell me. HC3 is kinda annoying and not 100% quality i dont think. also, if there are better file types, etc that could be used, feel free to tell me.

just realized some of the audio is dead for some reason... sorry

i will go back and record those sections again once I finish with the photoshop one.

feedback is welcome. im using camtasia no also it seems much better than hypercam
