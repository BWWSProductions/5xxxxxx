,DarkMan70,2010-05-29T23:31Z,Working like charm under Vista Ultimate x64. Great up. Thx!
,elitegamernl,2010-06-06T15:56Z,"do i need to have 9.0c for this ?
because 9.0c won't install for me 

or is this a standalone

i have Windows 7 X64 Ultimate"
,elitegamernl,2010-06-06T16:31Z,"i get a message that the authentication code isnt correct and i know 100% sure that i use the one with the serial key

and ive tried several times already and no luck"
,jnse2,2010-06-08T08:15Z,"Something is wrong with the patch?
The instruction say ""choose Sony vegas 8 series"" in the patcher.
But the serialnumber then starts with 1FW-... and it needs to be 1HF...

So HOW do you get the serial to work?"
,jnse2,2010-06-08T08:23Z,"Never mind, i found the other keygen to..."
,AlienAL1A5,2010-06-20T01:33Z,"Don't waste your time, keygen serial doesnt work no matter how many times you try. and yes, i replaced the starting bit to 1HF or whatever it was, it just doesnt work. shame."
,gteweq,2010-07-01T18:35Z,Try putting the keygen in the install directory. It worked right after I did that.
,gravesblade,2010-07-04T09:49Z,"when i click ""crack me"" it says:
Acces denied

little help please?"
,melis123,2010-07-07T08:50Z,If it is Acces Denied you need to start te program as a Admin
,ThePlatypus,2010-07-17T20:55Z,"When you run the activator it will say the key is for Vegas 8, thats ok, just change the first part of it to 1HF, that will make it work fine. And also, DO NOT RUN AFTER INSTALL!!!"
,Norrisade,2010-07-19T23:42Z,"alright, after numerous tries, i got it to work.

1) after you install it don't use that sony vegas patch thing, use the keygen in the KEYGEN_D.7 folder. RUN AS ADMINSTRATOR OR IT WONT WORK.

2) once you have that opened, go to sony vegas 9.0 (32 and 64 bit series), generate a serial, but dont open sony vegas, click patch and go to :C/Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 9.0.
it should work, if it says error, exit the keygen then run as administrator and repeat the beginning of this step and it'll work. DO NOT CLOSE KEYGEN AFTER YOUR DONE WITH THIS.

3)so, now you should have your serial generated. so open sony vegas (run as adm) and it should prompt you to enter the serial. so go to your keygen, copy paste the serial, and click next.

4) go to register from another computer, then click next, then enter fake information. your name can be w/e you want as long as its a first and last name. check the box that says i have read and agreed with the tos, and uncheck the one that says i would like to recieve shit from sony blahblahblah. then click next, save, then next.

5) now, copy paste the authentication key from the keygen, and it should work. 

the reason for it working is because the sonyvegas patch doesn't patch the x86 program files so no matter what you do the authentication key won't work, but the keygen does patch those files so yeah.

cheers :D

,cwentzell2002,2010-07-25T06:22Z,This has many viruses
,.Shadow.,2010-07-30T01:52Z,"Thanks Norrisade, that did the trick!"
,robaleca,2010-07-31T04:54Z,Big thanks to Norrisade for the explanation.
,pythonpro,2010-07-31T11:48Z,"once you have that opened, go to sony vegas 9.0 (32 and 64 bit series), generate a serial, but dont open sony vegas, click patch and go to ....

I dont understand that part Norrisade, please explain further more, big thanks to you for creating that guide!"
,pythonpro,2010-07-31T11:56Z,"Ok i got it now, it was that keygen thing that had to be changed, but now i have a new problem.. it asked for the authentication key, and the keygen delivered the wrong one, so i clicked generate again, and yet it didnt work.. What do i do now?"
,prodgirl,2010-09-19T16:06Z,Tried 6 other versions to work with Win7 64 bit.  This one was the only one that worked.  Thanks!  Great torrent.
,Ezel,2010-10-11T09:29Z,Worked for me on Win7 64bit. Although there are 2 keygens and as I see it no instruction on what to use. I used the one under the KEYGEN_D.7 directory instead of the one under PATCH.
