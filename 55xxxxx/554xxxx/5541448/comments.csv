Cheers

@ The rest of you who downloaded its a disgrace that none of you thanked 20-40, its utterly offending. He asks nothing from us and this is how you repay him? Disgraceful. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-07T19:24Z,"@Stev: As usual, my friend. Last week my torrents have 26163 downloads.
I bet that you know anyone who even bothered to say something. It looks like people who came here not understand what I'm sayin';
There is only 24 who have spoken at all.
Out of 26163 - that is less than 0.0001%.
Deduct calls ""motherfucker"", insults and stupidities - and I was hoping that   people would see what's going on. 

It was NEVER about people who say something. Even stalkers and maniacs have been more vocal then the rest -  their verbal poop is written testimony of their insanity, and I know (IP address can be seen as accompanies every comment) that some of them came for evil purpose they are louder in that apparent wasteland of TPB than silent majority.

However, I have followed your list from few days back and even if some shows must be upped as [quark] I hope you can find any show you've ranked."

know = ""know"" by screen-name
two zeroes less in percentage"
,believenu,2010-05-07T22:00Z,thanks. seeding is sharing
,believenu,2010-05-07T22:04Z,dear stev666.. not to nitpick but even though I do not always comment I do seed and share. I sometime just have time to d/l and seed for days before i even get a chance to watch the showI try to thank on at least one of his d/l per week.
[T],houruoha,2010-05-07T23:39Z,"i seed every single torrent i download from 2040?
never missed?
under any given bad circumstances i still atleast seed to 1.000
otherwise 2.000-3.000
so dont blame one another and lets keep this precious torrent alive and help some late comers...
dont be a stingy bastard
as always ""sharing is caring"" 
If you dont know the meaning of P2P
you can go jump of a BRIDGE
we/i dont give a damn
thanks 2040
:)
always
your FAN 
"
,believenu,2010-05-08T18:28Z,it is not hard to share just leave torrent seeding when d/l finishes which I do every single  time!
,ick0,2010-05-08T23:51Z,"Thanks mate for all of your uploads, if you wasn't around, I wonder how I would watch some of my favorite TV shows (I have 15 GB monthly limit) when I over do it, download is 4-5 kb/s so...THANKS"
,Sagacity61,2010-05-09T14:21Z,"Thanks heaps 2040.
I'm one of the guilty thankless I'm afraid, and I repent deeply.
Good work. "
