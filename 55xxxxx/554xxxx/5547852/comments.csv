,ThoSni,2010-05-09T20:35Z,Thanks! Is this BBC?
,ccdxb,2010-05-09T20:45Z,"wow Angelic u saved the day man!!!! Albiondean didn't upload the race yet due to some criticizing comments unforunately. 
thx a million. really."
,soryu,2010-05-09T23:36Z,thank you.
,giffo5,2010-05-10T02:34Z,"Oh my god ! you saved my day !
Thank you so much !
It seems some complaints have annoyed Albiondean... we hope he comes back to the F1 torrents....but thank you so much for uploading this ! .... will you be doing all the races ???

Thanks again for your efforts ! "
,Leib,2010-05-10T03:22Z,"Hi, thanks very much for this. I only have one small compaint.

 If another user hadn't mentioned an ""AngeliC"" upload of this race on the comments of Albiondean's upload of the qualifying I'd never have been able to find this torrent. You have this titled as "" Formula1..."" as if it were all one word.

 No one would search for it spelled like that, They'd use "" F1, Formula 1 or Formula One ""

Other than that, keep up the good work and I hope you'll be able to maintain a regularity in uploading the F1 series this season."
,.Stikk.,2010-05-10T14:55Z,"This file is awesome, perfect quality. I actually just registered for TPB to comment on this file, thanks SO much for this! I really hope you keep uploading them, we really do owe you..."
,giffo5,2010-05-10T16:57Z,"Well.... i cant thank you enough man !! 
There is a HUGE market for F1 on here.... i know thousands of people watch the BBC coverage because speed and other networks are garbage.
Please Please continue to put the races up ! 
Ignore any bad comments ....they just hatin ! lol"
,ccdxb,2010-05-13T18:52Z,"hi. can u please upload Monaco Thurs. practice sessions if time permits. 
It's always eventful and much information is given during those sessions. thank u for ur efforts."
,epajet67,2010-07-04T05:37Z,"Many thanks, it's getting difficult to find reliable F1 torrent these days. Much appreciated. I agree SPEED channel coverage is garbage. Ads all over the place! "
