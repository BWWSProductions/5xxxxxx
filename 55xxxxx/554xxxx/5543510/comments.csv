,nemaca,2010-05-21T07:20Z,"Hello. I dont know, I got an Avira warning the second I downloaded it. The just for curiosity wanted to go to virustotal.com to check out just how many threats will trigger. Couldn't open it because I did not had ""authorised permission"". Crossed my mind that when I will actually go in the folder and fiddle with the .exe it will prolly activate some malware. Unfortunately I burned myself with some antivirus software before that looked legit(no I'm not dumb enough to run into any software with a shield icon, I do some reviews and wikipedia research at least before downloading anything) and now I just avoid any potential threats. 

I'm just saying this cuz there might be some extra-cautious people out there and this is a heads-up. I'm not saying it HAS a virus, I'm saying it trigger my antivirus instantly and didn't allow me to use virustotal.com on the fly. My conclusions are my own of course.

Not rating this, but thanks for the upload anyway.

Have fun!"

I downloaded this version (4.37.1000), did an uninstall of the previous, ran a registry cleaner, rebooted and then installed this version.  Applied the patch, it gave the message it was patched but it's still the trial version.
Ideas?"
[V],Slickinator,2010-05-24T07:42Z,maybe get an older version and then update too this version using the patch as u can see in the picture its all good and if you do update the newest program it will make it trial again untill you repatch it and try in safe mode also
