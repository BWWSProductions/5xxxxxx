PLOT
When Yannick Berube falls off his bike, he knocks at the door of the Beaulieu residence so he can clean the blood off this hands. But Jacques Beaulieu and his family have other plans for Yannick. Beaulieu is a self-righteous psychopath and fanatical chess player who wants to rid the world of "evil". And even though Yan has done nothing wrong, he is beaten, tortured and tormented before Beaulieu makes him an offer: win at chess and he is free to go. And so Yannick is now a pawn in Beaulieu's game. A game in which he will either lose his mind or his life.
