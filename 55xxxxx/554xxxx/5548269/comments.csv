I can see day 3 is in English but is this one also? Never mind if not as a big thanks anyway..."
,Bum_Fluff,2010-05-13T01:58Z,"Yup, English.  I am presently creating Japanese language *.AVIs.  And will be posting both versions separately.

I don't have the software to create dual language files (it would take the same amount of recording time, anyways.)

Minesama, gomennassai!  Nihongo no hoga, desu-ne?  Ima suru-no yo!  Ja, koko (Bum-Fluff) mo ikkai mitte de kudasai"
