This movie centers around two vampires. One longs for a companion, while the other cannot bear to kill humans to satisfy its hunger. It's about a vampire who gives a down-on-his-luck man a choice to either live eternally or die. The man's decision causes him to regret many of the things that he does in his life to come.
