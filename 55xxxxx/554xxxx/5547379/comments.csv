,xiIix,2010-08-06T23:09Z,"There is no damn virus. Most cracks and keygens for games will trigger the heuristic alerts in your antivirus, which is why your antivirus is saying it's suspicious. The file is not malicious, it's just a damn crack. If you want to be paranoid then fine, but you're just making things difficult for no reason. 

My cousin is like that. The fuckin' guy runs a hardware firewall, two software firewalls, 2 antivirus programs and like every spyware app known to man. His computer is the slowest piece of shit in the world as a result of this, because it's scanning every single byte of information being accessed, sent, received or otherwise. It's insane and stupid, and the funniest part of it all, is that I heard from a family member that he had to reinstall Windows because of a virus not too long ago.

It's really easy to spot a virus. You scan it using a remote scanner, if it's positive, and you determine it's not a false positive, then there you go, delete the fucker. "

,sjaam,2010-08-26T00:32Z,"@xiIix
this one has some kind of a virus in it, it isn't the crack offcourse. but its a file that he copies to some place it doesnt belong. The game still works but you better get a safe, clean and smaller version here:
