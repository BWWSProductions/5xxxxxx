Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band
Capitol Theater
Passaic, NJ
September 20, 1978


What follows are the original notes, slightly edited to fit in with this seed (and I disagree with the assertion that this one is not as good as the previous night!  You don't have to be a fan of anything but rock and roll to love this one!).  Enjoy and share - it's another good one!

======================================================

PASSAIC #2 1978 WITH SONG SELECTION MENU!!

LINEAGE: DVD discs from Tailschao - ripped with DVD Decrypter - ABMS

Miles Hai's restored version of Passaic 20. Sept 1978 have now been re-authored by Tailschao, who has made a new main menu and - YES! - a song selection menu of the concert. 
He did this on my request. Thanks,T!!

Myself, I have adjusted the front artwork that came with Miles Hai's torrent upload: I have only added the credits to MIles Hai and Tailschao, and also indicated the song menu on the front. 

Previously, Tailschao had given the same treatment to the Passaic #1 dvd set, 19.Sept 1978. 

Enjoy!

ORIGINAL RESEED TORRENT INFO:

This is a DVD from Bruce and the band's legendary stand at Passaic in September 1978, the second show on the 20th. Miles Hai have done an amazing job and made the footage much more enjoyable and less "grey"/"foggy". Simply better b/w contrast etc. 
This restored video is not as good as the restored one from the first show (the 19th), as the footage source was of poorer quality. As a fan, however, you will likely be very much able to sit throug this! 

Miles Hai originally uploaded this show in one torrent per disc. I have organized it into a 2-DVD torrent.

Cover artwork included. 


Enjoy!
I think I've read somewhere that Miles Hai's versions is the best ones around?!!
