PLOT
Imagine John Lennon's childhood... A spirited  teenager, curious, sharp and funny, growing up in the shattered city of Liverpool.  Two extraordinary sisters tussle for his love - Mimi, the formidable aunt who raised him from the age of 5 and Julia, the spirited mother who gave him up to Mimi's care. Yearning for a normal family, John escapes into art and the new music flooding in from the US. His fledgling genius finds a kindred spirit in the young Paul McCartney. But just as John's new life begins, the truth about his past leads to a tragedy he would never escape.
