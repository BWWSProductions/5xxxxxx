"Some People" is a 1985 single by British New Wave artist Belouis Some, from his 1985 debut album Some People. The song reached #33 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986.

Belouis Some (born Neville Keighley, 12 December 1959), is a British New Wave musician. He had a few minor hits  in the 1980s with "Some People", "Round and Round", (produced by Bernard Edwards, which appeared on the soundtrack album to the film Pretty in Pink), plus "Imagination", which reached #17 on the UK Singles Chart and which can be heard in the movies Ghost Chase and The Business. "Some People" and "Imagination" also charted on the U.S.  Billboard Hot 100 in 1985.

Born Neville Keighley, Some released his first LP, Some People, in 1985. The title track was a club hit. Although Some's contribution to the Pretty in Pink soundtrack, "Round, Round", did not penetrate the mainstream, it introduced him to an audience outside of discothÃ¨ques. Produced by Bernard Edwards, "Round, Round" included an electric guitar rock sound while also featuring a dance groove. "Imagination," a song from Some People, was reissued in 1986, peaking at number 17 on the U.K. pop charts. Both "Some People" and "Imagination" were remixed several times. In 1986 he appeared at Knebworth at the bottom of a bill including Queen, Big Country, and Status Quo, where audience members threw plastic bottles at him. In 1987, Some recorded his self-titled second album, but it failed to duplicate the success of his debut. Some then disappeared from the music scene, until 1993 when he released Living Your Life with a techno sound. He has since made sporadic appearances under the alternate pseudonym  Belouis Many.
