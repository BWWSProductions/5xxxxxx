This doesn't appear to be the one w/Rosie Greer's (black) head put onto a body w/the head of a racist white man's head-  I saw that one decades ago... that one was knd of campy as I recall.  But, as said here or on Co7's collection site- there never was a bad sci-fi flic!"

,beachside777,2011-07-17T18:03Z,The Rosie Greer/Ray Milland version was renamed The Thing With Two Heads in the '70s to avoid confusion with this film. I consider the Rosie/Ray version to be the best. It's hilarious. Where else can you see a two headed man riding a motorcycle and fighting with himself at the same time?
