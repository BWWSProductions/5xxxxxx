,gregmlr,2010-06-04T01:07Z,Is this one narrated by David Attenborough or Oprah Winfrey?

Well, it says BBC, so probably the english guys. If it said ""Discovery Channel"" then probably oprah.

I downloaded a discovery channel episode... Oprah. Downloaded a BBC Episode... David Attenborough."

,denverr,2010-08-20T14:54Z,Can anyone tell me NTSC or PAL?
,zerosk8a,2010-09-15T00:33Z,"I'm guessing its PAL because of the dutch subtitles, which really sucks because ive yet to find an NTSC version out there. 

Thanks for uploading this, but seriously i hate to sound like a dick NLUPPER but its not that hard to put NTSC or PAL or even the damn region code. "

,shauwny,2011-04-26T09:49Z,"why would anyone want any dvd in NTSC instead of PAL? both the resolution, AND the colors are way better on PAL dvd's... remember: ntsc stands for Never The Same Color, whereas PAL stands for Perfectly Adjusted Levels ;)"
[V],Petey85,2011-07-20T16:24Z,"stop crying about ntsc or pal or dvd's
