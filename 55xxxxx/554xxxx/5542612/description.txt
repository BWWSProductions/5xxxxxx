Hailing from a small town in Belgium, Netsky is one of the most promising upcoming producers of the moment. In the last 4 years involved in music production, he realised that he likes his drum & bass deep and soulful. He is trying to ballance the deepness and musicality of his sound with big enough beats and bass to keep the dancefloor alive. With a number of 12"s on Hype's Liqweed Ganja and Twisted Individual's Allsorts in the pipeline, he is definately one to keep an eye on.
