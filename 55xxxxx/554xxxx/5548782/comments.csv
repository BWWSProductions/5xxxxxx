,CuntfaceRapist,2010-05-10T08:48Z,"Fuck downloading it, there is 10 to 1 leecher to seeder ratio for at least the next several hours. I've seen the episode, it was good, I saw it on a zshare link that I got at...

http://www.tvduck.com/frame2.php?view=718235&epi=334401

Believe me, I'm not fucking you around. And in the end, the whole episode only juiced 150 megs out of my bandwidth...

If you don't mind slightly shitty quality, go to the link I've shared with you. I gave the video a 7 and the audio a 7.

You don't want to miss this episode, Hank's fate is shared with us, as well as they flesh out what's been happening in Mexico with the Cousins.

And the black guy Gus, boy does he put on a decent show in this episode. 42 mins is NOT enough of a Breaking Bad fix per week.

Those who wait until they have a whole season to watch, are people that I'm jealous of, I am so desperate for the next hit of this show, that I spoon feed it to myself each week.

As of this moment and for the next several hours, that will be a working link. So you can thank me, CuntfaceRapist... for the goods.

And yes, I do rape cunts who have faces."
,CuntfaceRapist,2010-05-10T09:17Z,"I've also found in recent weeks, given I live in a different country to the one where this shit is being aired....  I want to get my breaking bad hit quick, and consistently I'm appalled by the crazy bad ratio to be found on the BB episodes in the first few hours after they are posted  on pirate bay... so I've been exploring elsewhere and opted for the streaming video versions...

I find Project Free TV, which is fucking awesome, never has the BB episode until like 24 hours after it airs...

I'm find that a google news search brings up some great streaming links.... some of them are fake, but some of them are always real.

Last three weeks I've had great luck on google news finding links to the BB episodes like an HOUR after they air in the United States.

Which is fucking great.... I recommend cunts like you reading this should do what I do... 

Go to google news, each week around this time when it airs, a couple of hours after it airs.... then search for something like, next week for example...

breaking bad episode 9

that's next week, as an example of what you should search for on google news.

I guarantee you'll get 5 or so promising results, and maybe 2 or 3 will turn out to be spamming cunts... but I'm getting 1 or 2 each google news search per week that end up being greating fucking streaming vid links....

A final word,

Suck my fucking dick."

,caius24,2010-05-11T05:30Z,"Hey halfwit wannabe tough guy muttfucker Cuntface...
I agree Breaking Bad is the shit however I'm trying to figure out why you have the nerve to think you deserve the arrogance that permeates the lamedick posts and links you've given here rofl...
Unless u are the ultimate and slam shards like a champ perhaps you should dial down the conceit a notch or two- I live within 2 hours of Abq (thats albuquerque for the uninformed) and 6hrs from Juarez (been there done that far too many times...) and have been immersed in the life for more than a minute...
You ""spoon feed it..."" to yourself each week? ROTFLMFAO!!!!  Speaking of ""spoons""....sounds like you don't have a motherfuckin clue as to what that actually means with regards to fixin a bump...
Like I said- what I'm thinkin is unless you have any idea as to part of what this series entails (wish I could go back and never see or experience even a fraction of the pitch black meth reality that exists...)- then it's probably a good idea for you to check your wannabe tough guy coat at the door before commenting on this show...
Those like you never cease to amaze me..."
,ReluktantSkeptik,2010-05-11T05:35Z,"Amazing show. I wish I could watch when it airs, but i'm always at work on sundays... =(  "
,CuntfaceRapist,2010-05-11T07:45Z,"To caus24... shut the fuck up you spic cunt.

You've got NOTHING to say.

Oh, and listen to me you malignant cunt, when I said 'spoon feed'... more specifically when I said 'I am so desperate for the next hit of this show, that I spoon feed it to myself each week.'... 

When i said that, you fucking birth defect, I was OBVIOUSLY referring to me watching the show each week instead of saving up a pile of episodes or perhaps a whole season to watch.

hose out your dad's asshole."
