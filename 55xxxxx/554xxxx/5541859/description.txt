U.F.Orb is the second studio album by ambient house/techno group The Orb that reached #1 on the UK Album Chart. It featured an edited version of The Orbâ€™s single â€œBlue Roomâ€. Noted graphic design group The Designers Republic designed the cover art for the album.

Orb member Kris Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Alex Patersonâ€™s Eno-influenced ambience on U.F.Orb, creating â€œdrum and bass rhythmsâ€ with â€œvelvet keyboardsâ€ and â€œrippling synth linesâ€. U.F.Orb reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be progressive rock. Heavily influenced by The Orb and U.F.Orb in particular, many trip-hop groups sprang up emulating The Orbâ€™s â€œchill-out blueprintâ€. U.F.Orb expresses The Orbâ€™s fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the albumâ€™s title itself. The albumâ€™s single, â€œBlue Roomâ€, is itself a reference to the supposed Blue Room of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which was heavily investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.

Some say that the albumâ€™s best song is â€œBlue Roomâ€, an 18-minute piece(thereâ€™s a 40-minute version that comprises the entire single, too), that features bass playing by Jah Wobble and guitar by coproducer Steve Hillage.
