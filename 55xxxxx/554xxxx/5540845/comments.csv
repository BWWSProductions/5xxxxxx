Does anyone know what's up with that?"

,kludge420,2011-03-29T04:28Z,"Don't waste your time downloading this, it's the trial version. If anyone tells you the trial is the same as the retail they don't know what the fuck they are talking about. All you have to do is read Adobe's website and it will tell you that the trial is missing several plugins."
,MustL0veD0gs,2011-06-29T22:40Z,"I'm having issues with the Bridge application. It opens and the menu at the top works fine, but the actual window doesnt load images properly, it acts as if its buffering and doesn't fully load. I tried to reinstall photoshop, but that did not fix the problem. Is there anything I can do to make it work properly? my email is mariyanovitski@yahoo.com Thank you!"
