Back to the nineties. Era of Karl Kani, grunge singers decapitating themselves with shotguns and the dopest Hip Hop ever to be made. Crack Kopen takes you on a journey in which you will hear all the classics that you've either been bumpin' since way back, or that make you wonder why you haven't been bumpin' that shit since way back!

And of course, vinyl only. Cause that's just how Crack does.
