"Itâ€™s rare to find a band that can successfully balance the immense responsibility of a self-imposed â€˜grand designâ€™ with the endless pursuit of entertainment. The ministry-minded Arkansans of Take It Back! are surely no strangers to fun as evidenced by their brand of high-energy posi-hardcore. Taking inspiration from bands such as Verse, Have Heart, Modern Life Is War, and Kings of Leon, Take It Back!â€™s sound strikes a chord of candor in this synthetic and often insincere industry, and honesty is what they aim for.

â€œWe are tired of watching people around us live and die for nothingâ€ says frontman Nick Thomas.  Their lighthearted approach to life on the road and their fun, youth-crew sound belies the bandâ€™s willingness to take on a matter very dear to their hearts.  â€œWe are motivated by the unfortunate state of the world around us.  We want to show people that there is a purpose for this life.â€  On their follow up release to Canâ€™t Fight Robots Take It Back wear their heart on their sleeve as they chronicle the atrocities of an apathetic society.

Atrocities is Take It Back!â€™s sophomore Facedown album and will be released on November 10, 2009."
