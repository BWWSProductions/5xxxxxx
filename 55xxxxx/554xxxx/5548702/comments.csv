,mrhozer,2010-06-20T21:58Z,"Works Perfectly! Thanks!!!!!

PPL remember that most keygens will be a false negative for virus software because it is a small program that doesn't have a dedicated install directory which is usually the trademark of a virus. Just temporarily disable your antivirus/syware software if you have issues opeing the keygen.

Also run the keygen first, use they $erial, then the disable activation script."
,Bazzoo,2010-06-21T02:24Z,"Hi DibyaTPB,

Everything seemed to be working fine with this.

But everytime i open one of the programs in the collection, It keeps saying that the serial number is invalid, and asks for a new one. Do i have to generate a new serial each time i open one of the programs?   "

,Bazzoo,2010-06-22T15:34Z,"All sorted top notch,

Had to go in to etc\host file and manually add in the the line from the instructions.

Had no idea what i was doing or what an editor was, so i tried dreamweaver from the install and saved the line in to the file. Now working 100%

What are the chances of adobe tracing this to me?"
,termin8or123,2010-07-03T07:42Z,Can you still get updates from Adobe with this crack?
,TPBSPY,2010-08-31T16:13Z,"Nothing wrong with the Keygen guys.

Works as advertised on Windows 7 x64 and x86, plus XP-Pro x86.

Don't be scared of the false positive some of your AVs may display. If you are that paranoid, then simply don't download. 
As for the rest of you guys, ""Enjoy"".  ;)"
