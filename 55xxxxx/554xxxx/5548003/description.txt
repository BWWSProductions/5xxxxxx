Pat Benatar - 1985 - Seven the Hard Way (Japan 1st Press CP32-5097 Black Triangle)

From Wiki:

Benatar would hit the U.S. Top 10 with the #10 single "Invincible" (the 
theme from the movie, The Legend of Billie Jean) in 1985. "Sex As a Weapon" 
would climb as high as #28 in January 1986, and "Le Bel Age" (#54) in 
February. The album Seven the Hard Way peaked at #26, earning an RIAA Gold 
certification.

The title of the album is based on a bet in the game of craps: "Rolls of 4,
6, 8, and 10 are called "hard" or "easy" (e.g. "Six the Hard Way", "Easy Eight", "Hard Ten") depending on whether they were rolled as a "double" or as any other combination of values, because of their significance in center table bets known as the "hard ways"." The album was the band's seventh release in seven years. Benatar is holding a pair of dice on the album cover with three and a half dots each.

This is not my rip.  Many thanks to the original uploader.
