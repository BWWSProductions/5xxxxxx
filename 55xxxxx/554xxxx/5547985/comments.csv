The course does not go into depth on one narrow subject but sets out to explain how everything e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g fits together in our universe, our world and our society, why we are where we are and where we are heading in the future. There's a lot of lectures so don't expect to finish watching it all in less than a week but it's worth it. 

Strongly recommended!"
