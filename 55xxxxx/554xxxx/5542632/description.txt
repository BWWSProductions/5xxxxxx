         More than 70 percent of Earth is covered in water, but        
         we've only explored roughly 5 percent of it. We've roamed     
         even less of our solar system. Now, armed with some of        
         the latest advances in technology, we join scientists on a    
         voyage into the unknown - from the far reaches of space to    
         the extreme depths of our oceans - where new discoveries      
         have experts questioning everything we know about the         
          universe, and ultimately ourselves.
