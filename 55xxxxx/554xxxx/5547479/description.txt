        PLOT:

        Bruce Lee has just died, but the BSI is swinging into action to
        salvage the situation. Aided by the brilliant Professor Lucas, cells
        from the martial arts master's body are removed and grown into three
        adult Bruce Lee clones. After undergoing training to bring their
        skills up to the level of their 'father', the three are sent out to
        battle crime, with one sent to take on a gold smuggler, and the other
        two teaming up to shut down an evil mad scientist.

        RiPPERS NOTES:

        Crappy print. But it's widescreen! And we have to ask ourselves the
        question: Do we really care? I mean.. There are a whole bunch of
        Bruce Lee's in this (and Bolo)! The story is crazy as hell and there's
        some gratitious random nudity, although censored.  It's all wrapped up
        with an original soundtrack.... From the cult classic The Warriors!

        We have a fullscreen uncensored print of this aswell, but sadly it's
        out of sync beyond repair so i guess this will have to do for now.

        German dubtrack included as extras.
