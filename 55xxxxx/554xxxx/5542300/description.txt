In 1943, the first major U.S. offensive of World War II is drawing to a 
close on the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal. To put an end to this campaign, 
the United States Army arrives with a full division of troops and equipment, 
deployed to break the last resistence of the Japanese. The exploits of this 
Division are seen from a number of perspectives amongst the soldiers; 
to include a war weary Sergeant, a power hungry Colonel, a Private who 
has known only desertion and AWOL, and a Company Commander is struggling 
with his abilities as a leader.
