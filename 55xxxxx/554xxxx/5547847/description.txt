From Wiki:


Information Society (also known as InSoc and InfoSo) is a U.S. band originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota, primarily consisting of Kurt Larson (aka Kurt Valaquen/Kurt Harland), Paul Robb, and James Cassidy; the latter two reconvened the band in 2006, initially with Christopher Anton as lead vocalist, then with Harland rejoining them as lead vocalist by 2008. Their breakout hit was 1988's "What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)", a dance/ synthpop hit which included a sample of Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from Star Trek, saying "pure energy," and opened with a sample of Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), also from Star Trek, saying, "It's worked so far, but we're not out yet!" They are known for their loyal fan base in Brazil, Japan, Spain and Mexico.[citation needed] Information Society became part of the American response to the Second British Invasion.
