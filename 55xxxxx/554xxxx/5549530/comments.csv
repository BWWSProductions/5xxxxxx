,true_Menace,2010-05-25T17:01Z,"This is just a complete rip-off of my torrent!!!

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5461210/Garmin_Mobile_XT_v5.00.50_3rd_edition_Symbian_and_Europa_2010.3

piggie84 you are a fuck!"
,Dani12345,2010-06-08T08:41Z,"Deze werkt super!!!

Kreeg eerst problemen met koppelen aan mijn interne GPS. Kwam met melding alleen te gebruiken met Garmin GPS ontvanger, maar met de bekende ''hack'' is het uiteindelijk gelukt. Heb dat ''sw.unl'' bestandje 5 keer moeten veranderen en bleek dat hij de verkeerde code had. Dus paar keer proberen en hij werkt wel, dus probeer verschillende codes met de keygen die erbij zit als het niet werkt. Ik heb een Sony Ericsson Satio.

THANX 4 THE UPLOAD!!!!!"
