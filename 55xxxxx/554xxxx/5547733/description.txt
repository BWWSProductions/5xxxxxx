NegurÄƒ Bunget is black fog rising from a never-ending deep dark forest. Itâ€™s a symbolic name that somehow tries to picture the kind of musical and spiritual atmosphere weâ€™d like to create through our music. The two words come from the oldest Romanian language substrate, symbolizing this way tradition and authenticity.
