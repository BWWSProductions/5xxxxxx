FLAWL3SS NOTES
We took the original dvd-r and encoded from there.
We noticed the saturation was a little low on it so we increased to get the colors right.
Brightness and everything else was left untouched.
Also we left the ac3 audio in it. You dont get those often on R5s.
We want to thank elektrika for the release. As with out them we wouldnt be releasing this. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.

credit FLAWL3SS & BDK & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
