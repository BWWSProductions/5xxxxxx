You'll have the chance to drive incredibly powered
vehicles, up to 200k HP. These last generation "cars" are equipped with
twin turbines that can push you up to 1200 Km/h, floating on a magnetic
surfaced track with sudden turns, ups and downs and tunnels.

the pilots wear pressurized suits to sustain the incredible acceleration
and g-forces during the race. Choose a team and lead it to the very top,
gaining credits to buy new, more powerful engines and magnetic pods to
improve your vehicle's performance.
Race against the cpu driven cars with no mercy strategy making them
smashing against the outer bounds of the raceline and wisely choose the
timings for refueling at the automated Pitstop system. Learn how to drive
with the Single Race mode and then embrace the real GPE World Championship
challenge against your friends!
