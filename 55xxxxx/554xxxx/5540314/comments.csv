British proto-noir?"

It's not actually British, because Columbia Pictures produced it and it was made in it's USA studios.
However, the history of the film happens in England, some actors are british and the filme really has a british atmosphere."

Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've made my day! xx"

,AJNorth,2011-10-24T09:29Z,"A terrific film noir, with stand-out performances by Nina Foch and George Macready -- and especially Dame May Whitty, playing wickedly against type. A respectable transfer, too. Thanks for the upload!"
