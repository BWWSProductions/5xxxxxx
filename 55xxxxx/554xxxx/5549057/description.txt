EA Mobile are right up there because they are the ones dominating at the moment, and now they have the all new iPhone app called â€˜Skate Itâ€™, which is the Apple iPhone edition of the very popular skate series.

Activision seem a little slow when it comes to bringing out its hot games, so EA Mobile can have the limelight at the moment. The new Skate It game gives you a pass to the San Vanelona world, which is hardcore skaterâ€™s heaven because you will become city planners.

You will use the iPhoneâ€™s tilt controls and flick the screen to control every movement, get right down with moves such as kickflips, heelflips and nollies. If you play the game well you will complete challenges that will allow you to get new boards, clothes and much more, you can even open new skating areas.
