I'm no newcomer to this but after installing Steam & creating my account, whenever I tried to install the Worms app., it told me that Steam had to be running to allow installation.......but it was. End result, no Worms & a whole lot of wasted time & effort! Thanks."

,eatjar,2010-05-23T13:57Z,"Error - Steam must be running to play this game!
same for me
3. Install the game
What the hell does it mean?

I think the game cannot be installed with the ""WormsReloaded.exe"" couse its not an install, its a play file.

So do we have to install it from steam?
but i can't find worms 2 armageddon in the games list.
And What is peggle extreme?? i cant find it either.

DjAligator or someone who istalled it please leave some comments!

Cheers"
,eatjar,2010-05-23T14:35Z,"OK
so here are the steps:

Install
1. Install cracked steam 2009
2. Create an account
3. Install the game:
install eg.: Peggle deluxe from the steam games list 
4. After install close the steam
5. Copy all files from Worms Reloaded in C:program Files\ Steam\steamapps\common\peggle deluxe
6. Delete or rename deluxe.exe
7. Rename file WormsReloaded.exe to Peggledeluxe.exe
8. Run the game Peggledeluxe.exe from steam.(click to play)

So this worked for me, but i dont have sound :)

and look out :Available only multiplayer!
so this is just the beta test of the game.
siriously guys we should wait some weeks with this to get the full game... this torrent just waisting time"
,Screamroot,2010-05-26T03:09Z,"I got this working, add me on steam if you either need instructions on how to, or wanna play, my steam name is StabbaJack"
,rajko88,2010-06-09T16:54Z,"works but u have to do next steps..
instal steam... create username...
than instaly any steam game... and copy the worms instalation in that game directory .. and rename WormsReloaded.exe to the game exe you downloaded for example .

i downloaded 7 wonders 2 game.. and i copied worms reloaded into C:\Program Files (x86)\steamm\steamapps\common\7 wonders 2

and i renamed WormsReloaded.exe into Wonders2.exe , and then in steam run 7 wonders game and it will run the worms.. hope i helped.. ty for upload..."
,Filip89x,2010-06-16T12:50Z,Rajko88 do you have sound?
,Filip89x,2010-06-18T21:15Z,Any solution for sound problem???
,crimson00100,2010-07-06T02:13Z,"seriously WHO WOULD DOWNLOAD A GAME THAT NEED A PROGRAM TO RUN IT AND A REGISTERY TO THAT PROGRAM???????? ARER YOU TRYING TO MAKE OUR LIFES HARDER????? TRUST ME IT AAALLLLREADY IS!!!!!!!!!

pffffttt why people dont download stuff thats wasy to use and in the simple addictive way that torrents was on like before? :("
,kyllopardiun,2010-07-12T21:07Z,"For people without sound, i guess it\'s because of the ncf file, which isn\'t the retail for worms reload,rnso if anyone have this beta full working, please, post a torrent with the nfc file for this game..."
,Merklez,2010-07-13T16:37Z,Maybe it\'s not working because MAYBE this game isn\'t even out and available for PC @_@?
,crackerz9x,2010-07-18T19:14Z,"how can u play single player you can't even play 2 player on the same pc.

multiplayer and tutorial works great though"
,h3dblad,2010-07-23T10:56Z,How to play single playe? in main menu its only multiplayer.. HELP!

,squallzy,2010-08-21T03:53Z,test
,squallzy,2010-08-21T03:56Z,"omfg posting finally works again! ive been trying to post this for a couple of days now.

If your having trouble.
1. Make sure your anti-virus software/peerguard/windows firewall are either turned off or unblocking steam.
2. Install cracked steam. 
NOTE: If you have windows 7(and maybe vista) install cracked steam into something other them program files. (for some reason my computer would show a message saying please move cracked steam into a different folder with the right privileges or something like that)
3. Create an account"
,squallzy,2010-08-21T03:59Z,"4. install Peggle Extreme.
5. Once installed Close Steam. (I restarted after installing cracked steam, but you might not have to.)"
,squallzy,2010-08-21T04:00Z,"6. Check Peggle Extreme is in C: Program Files Cracked Steam steamapps common 
7. Copy all files from Worms 2 Armageddon to Peggle Extreme
8. Delete or rename PeggleExtreme.exe
9. Rename WormReloaded.exe to PeggleExtreme.exe.
10. Run steam(cracked, with administrator rights)
11. Go to games and play Peggle Extreme (it will load up Worms 2 :D and your done.)
Worked for me but noone is playing and its only multiplayer, I'll be waiting for ever unless someone is willing to create a game and just sit there all day hoping for someone to get it working and join lol
I dont know if you can use tunngle for this butf theres no room for it. I think some people play this on Himachi...but it should just directly work through steam right?"
,slavdodov123,2010-08-24T08:24Z,"this version of steam is old(2009)and makes problems with updates....
FIX:
Install cracked steam 2009(after running it will try to update....wait until updates)
Then
Download SteamUp.2010-REVOLUTiON from http://www.rev-crew.info/node/3/release
Ectract the files in \Programs Files\Cracked Steam\
Overwrite if asked
Run Steam and here you go...You have cracked steam 2010 :)"
,SumoGrenade,2010-09-18T18:37Z,This is crap I did everything it says to do and it still says : Must be running Steam to play this game. Even when I run it on Steam!!!!
,Valtrex666,2010-10-28T00:43Z,"Game Works, but DOES NOT HAVE THE SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN. This version only has the multiplayer; and you may never find anyone online to play with. So It's ultimately pointless unless you have someone else to host a game with. 
**note for people running Windows 7, I kept getting a ""steam must be running"" error when trying to open the .EXE file to the game. Be sure to go to the Steam website and download the newer version of steam, install, and reset computer. Everything should work after that. 

""Keep it Real, Keep it Free""
Peace.
Thanks for the upload Aligator, works great"
,OSkully,2011-03-03T01:38Z,"hey if any of you guys want an easy to install great game that has no problems so ever that i noticed at least check out dont delete me blindly's post for worms reloaded, its a clean great and easy install, just download open and run the exe and it installs no problem so if you guys want worms check it out still trying to get it for multiplayer though.."
,dispatch88,2011-03-10T06:04Z,"Erm, this is not in english.  Is there a language setting in the game, if so can someone tell me how to get to it?"
,norbi96,2011-03-12T20:48Z,thx for upload!
,Zareste,2011-06-09T23:38Z,Doesn't work. Next
