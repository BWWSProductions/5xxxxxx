You Gotta Go There to Come Back is Stereophonics' fourth album, released on V2 in 2003. It became their third consecutive album to top the UK chart.

The album shows a newly found maturity compared to the brazenness of the previous three. After this mature and soulful album they returned to the sound of their previous albums with their next album. The title can also be explained by this statement: they had to go here, and record this album, to come back and return to their old sound.
