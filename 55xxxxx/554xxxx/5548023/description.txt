Thanks to Flambay (Cristian Reichert) who did the speed correction,
 especially on the tracks that  need variable pitch adjustments (tracks 06-07-11).

Sound Quality  from B- to C+ ----  see below for a more detailed analysis track by track

Lineage > 2 dime torrents > Audacity (high pass filter (default value) - normalizing - noise cutting ) > TLH (sbe- flac) > Dime  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version comes from the sum of 2 versions  of this concert :
The "MASTER"  version and the " SOUND IMPROVED " version.

I had to do so because both the MASTER version and the SOUND IMPROVED version weren't  complete .

See notes below .


The SOUND IMPROVED version: http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=230194 
Was uploaded by myself  the first months of 2009 


The "MASTER" one is the version uploaded last December by Tranehead  with the following notes :
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 #279267  John Coltrane Quintet / Kobe, Japan / 17 july 1966 / KNOWN GEN. complete (UPGRADE)/
***This version does not come from any previous tree, branch, CDR trade or unk.(x)gen. cassette, etc. 

Lineage: Master reel > DAT1(Fuji) > DAT2 (this) > 
CDRW (speed correction) > Flac 

Reportedly recorded under the recordists chair. some foot tapping is evident. this tape is complete and unedited. 
NOTE: as with all other circulating copies, indeed the master, there are many speed fluctuations and overall it is a very flawed tape.
 that said, Naima is beautiful, and MFT is the longest known version from the tour. 
very OUT! We are lucky to have this. 

enjoy! 

***CONTRAST CLAUSE: 
this torrent should be considered an upgrade to the previous torrents seeded here (listed below), 
as this is a known gen. DAT copy, whereas those derive from a trade CDR of unknown generation. 


Recent version:  
http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=278666 

Sound improved version: http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=230194 

Other than fixing the pitch as best i could (matching to the official release), i have left the sound raw and intact from the original dub. 
I think some eq'ing or other "technical tricks" might bring out a wider spectrum of sound. I'll leave that to someone else.

Was uploaded by myself  the first months of 2009 

cdr in trade (from bad tape)> Audacity (removed as much noise as possible and some 
volume adjustment > CD Wave [tracking > FLAC
Sound Quality very variable from track to track 

MFT and  LEO weren't complete but there was LEO's Finale !!!

below what I used of leo :


09 - Leo - Saxes Reprise 06:31
10 - Leo - Finale 01:10
11 - Leo - Reprise (inc 2:42 + 0:18) 03:00 

What I called Reprise is just the beginning of the 'Master' version of Leo plus in the very end the last notes 
of Leo finale missing from the 'master' tape

_________________________________________________________________________________________________


SOME HISTORY 

______________________


First of all I divided the tracks of the "MASTER" following MORE OR LESS  the sequence of Solos

first surprise : in Leo we have the following sequence :

 Theme
 Drums solo (with leo theme)
 Piano solo
 Drums solo
 Piano solo (truncated)

 a very original sequence to be true !! 

In Fact after careful listening I discovered that 2 of the solos  were clones of the other 2 (with different lenghts)
and the 2 good ones were not in sequence one after the other!!

I Wonder what happened to this tape !!
What is missing from this 'Master Tape'	luckily is present in my "sound improved" version of this concert
of last year 

So I had to cut some 11 minutes to obtain a version of Leo Complete and without repetitions 


second surprise : in Leo we have the same finale as MFT !!! (I mean the last few seconds)
this comes from the 'SOUND IMPROVED' tape  which contained a really puzzle-version of MFT 
that was 2/3 MFT 1/3 Leo and for a few seconds  again MFT

N O T E S    to Tracks

02) NAIMA 		20:30  
I really recommend it - wonderful music
 
contains a 6'35  solo by Sanders  from 6'50 to 13'25
really the best I've heard from him(I'm not a fan of Sanders though ) -
the differences in timings (from 20:26 to 20:12 is due to noises cut off) 
now the time is back to 20:30 due to time speed correction  
sound quality is B /B-     A MUST 
Speed Correction : -1.5 % (= -26cts)
 



********  M F T   ********


03) GARRISON SOLO		16:04
I worked on it for at least 40 hours (in some places i worked an hour to clean 20 seconds)
That's the reason why the length passed from 17:49 to 16:04 !!
Sound quality now is B-  Highly recommendable now !! (imho)
No speed correction done

04) Trane Solo			09:52
A really powerful solo containing quotations from Kush (by Dizzy) and India 
The tape was pretty bad and in 3 or 4 points i Couldn't eliminate tape twists without eliminate 
music
Sound quality now is B-  -   listenable (imho)
Speed correction : +2 % (= +35cts)


05) Sanders Solo		10:04
A good solo 
Sound quality now is C+  -   listenable (imho)
Speed correction : +1 % (= +18cts)

06) Piano solo 			06:23
I managed to improve it but the sound is  poor (warbles)
Sound quality now is C-  -  i'd leave it out of a cd - for completists
Speed correction : variable pitch adjustment  (+ 3%)

16a) it's a shortened version of the solo just to join well track 5 with track 7

07)   MFT - Trane finale	13:39
Really grand 
Sound quality just a bit under the quality of  the trane solo beginning    
Speed correction : variable pitch adjustment (+ 4%)


END OF MY FAVORITE THINGS 


********   L E O   ********


08) LEO - THEME 		10:31
After the statement of the theme The Caos Begins
The first 2'40 are the same as the "Leo Reprise" of the SOUND IMPROVED  version 
Sound Quality B-/ C+
Speed correction : -3 %  

09) - Leo - Drums solo with Leo theme 	13.18
Very long Drum solo
Sound quality now is C   
Speed correction : -3 %  


10) - Leo - Piano solo			10:40
I managed to improve it but the sound is really  poor (many warbles)
Sound quality now is C--  -  i'd leave it out of a cd - for completists
Speed correction : -3 %  

20a) it's a shortened version of the solo just to join well track 9 with track 11

11) Saxes Reprise Finale		07:49
A powerful ending for Leo with the 2 saxes together
Sound quality now is B-/ c+   -  listenable (imho)
Speed correction : variable pitch adjustment

12) Leo reprise				03.09
What I have entitled as "Leo reprise" is a track containing the Beginning of Leo 
with the theme of leo lasting 2'42 plus a very brief ending with applause.
Sound quality now is B-- -  pretty listenable (imho)
Speed correction : -3 % 

I have left it even though we already have it as track 08  because this is all we had in the "SOUND IMPROVED" version
of the beginning of the track and to me it sounded also as a good "encore" 
 and this is the way I suggest everybody to burn the second CD 
with this second statement of the Theme as an encore .
