Batch Con Flag Remover v0.2.2 *Update v0.2.3*

Scuba156 of Xbox1Crew released a new version of Batch Con Flag Remover. It's a tool that will batch-uncorrupt game saves from a banned console instead of having to do it one by one.

What's new/fixed:
+ Redesigned the GUI
+ Changed 'open' button to 'Add' which now allows you to select multiple directories to add for batch removing
+ Added a remove button (can remove multiple selections)
+ Now also searches for files in the selected directory (for single file flag removal)
+ Fixed a typo
+ Now only writes to file if the flag needs to be removed instead of writing 'FFFFFFFF" regardless
+ Check if file is already listed so no duplicate items (determined by file
location)
+ Begun to write for resigner (very little but its a start)
- Ignore the product ID column, it is not working as of yet

!Update! v0.2.3 has been released, here's what's new/fixed:
+ Basic resigning (Wont work for all games) using X360.dll from DJ Skunie Butt
+ Fixed a bug where backups were getting created after editing file
+ Now needs a KV.bin file, which should be placed in the Resources folder
