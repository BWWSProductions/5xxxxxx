
Charles Bronson, in typical tight-lipped-Charlie fashion, plays a Russian intelligence officer given a strange mission: kill 51 deepcover Russian agents now living in the United States. According to this fictitious script, 15 years ago, following the U-2 American spy plane incident, the Russians decided to send into the United States a bunch of agents who will respond to posthypnotic suggestion. When given the proper command these agents will take hidden explosives and move immediately to blow up a critical American military and communications facility.
