Plot:
Gangs are society's ultimate devil figure. They symbolize transgression and embody the deepest fears of middle-class citizens. Few filmmakers have dared or been able to get behind the headlines to confront the human reality and complexity of street gangs in late twentieth-century urban America. Challenging media stereotypes, this documentary brings to the center of the screen the human faces and voices of street youth who speak from inside their world. They give voice and meaning to the underground culture they have created, an intricate web of symbols and passions, borders and brotherhood, honor and, all too often, death. Theirs is a world the middle class does not see or know.

The Heart Broken in Half is a face-to-face encounter with the people behind the labels. Street-smart survivors, many of them first-generation immigrants and refugees, they guide the viewer through their "hood", a journey that traverses the territory of the soul as well as inner-city Chicago.

The Heart Broken in Half deepens and complicates our understanding of gang culture. The violent death and funeral of a young Latin King gang member stir up the deepest feelings and most haunting questions about both the vulnerability and the heroic ethos of gang life. And what may surprise many viewers, the street youth themselves offer a sobering critique of gang life, but their critique differs sharply from the simplistic assumptions and easy answers of law-and-order pundits.
