Virtual DJ Studio (VDJ) is an MP3 Mixer for live DJ performances.

With Virtual DJ Studio you can play Karaoke with Multiple Monitor Support, Mix MP3 Files, use multiple Sound Cards, and adjust Pitch and Tempo on each file individually.

VDJ also contains a full 10-band Graphic Equalizer, full support for Audio Plugins, a Spectrum Analyzer, and many more tools for DJs.

Virtual DJ Studio is not like all of the other DJ programs out there. While other programs limit you to two players with a Cross-Fader, Virtual DJ Studio provides you with an entire studio.

The two-deck metaphor is out-dated. There is no reason to limit yourself when your PC can easily give you so much more.

Now, with Virtual DJ Studio, you can break free from this tired metaphor!

You will quickly see how VDJ is different from other DJ software. Laid out like a Mixer, each Line features a full MP3, WAV and Playlist player, with its own Volume Fader, Pitch/Tempo control, and more.
