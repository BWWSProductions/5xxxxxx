If you love beer, maybe you shouldn't work in a brewery. Head brew master Herman values his lager more than his life. During one of his drunken sprees he topples over into a beer kettle. An event that will prove to have strange effects on his colleagues, a group of Japanese tourists, and eventually: the typical Dutch tradition of Queen's Day.
