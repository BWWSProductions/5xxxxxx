This is a raw dump of a 3.30 ps3 us PUP file.
this shows what happens during the update of your Sony Ps3.
I will upload a dump of 3.21 Us if requested so you can see what the difference is between updates, and with that knowledge potentially make your own version of a PlayStation 3 update. 

CFW.... Coming soon.

Note. The jaic_ ... file is used to find the authentication key by selecting all the files in the folder and moving them to the file. A message will pop up and show some numbers and letters. To the average user, this is completely useless. but to those devs out there. This could be the beginning of the PS3 CFW scene.
