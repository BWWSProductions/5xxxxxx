,j0e_hill,2010-05-27T02:30Z,"Okay, seriously, once and for all: DO NOT ADD BLACK BARS TO THE VIDEO, YOU RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE WHO USES PROPER SOFTWARE/HARDWARE. IF YOU NEED TO ADD BLACK BARS FOR YOURSELF, IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE USING SHIT SOFTWARE/HARDWARE.

At the very least, if you are too stupid to understand this, please make a note of it so intelligent people can avoid downloading your stupid shit."
,j0e_hill,2010-05-27T20:25Z,"Okay, okay, I found something out today and maybe I should apologize.

It seems that if someone is receiving an analog signal of a show that is recorded in HD, then the broadcast will add the black bars. If they then record this stream and upload it, it will have black bars encoded into it.

Still, please, please, please, do not upload stuff from analog streams that is meant to be in HD format. Please. No one wants to see it. It looks terrible on HDTV's, because it's all squashed.

There is plenty to be uploaded from people who have _real_ HD content."

Icarly suppliers are limited. why do people like you complain when they get **** for free.
IF you want absolute HD content of this, then buy it, or DVR it yourself. "
