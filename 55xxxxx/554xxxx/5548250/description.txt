Kill Bill - Volume 2 (2004)

Encoded for playback on PSP, iPod or Zune.*

This video also has soft subtitles embedded.(Basically you can turn them on and off for use during the non-english spoken scenes.)**

Encoded from a HD 720p source for a sharper quality for the file size.


*(Tested on iPod Classic 6.5G, iPod Touch 3G, Nano 3G, and Nano 5G, there is no guarantee that this will work on iPod Video 5G. I do not have access to a PSP or Zune, so I cannot test it on those devices, however, if I've got it right, theres no reason it shouldnt play on them)



**Likewise I have only tested this on iPod 6.5 gen and so on... but hopefully they do work on other devices, PSP at least. I have found that providing subs are turned on for the film on iTunes, only then will the subs be available with an iPod/iPhone synced to it. I don't know why, but thats just the way it is. It's not hard to find though, just click the speech bubble on the iTunes player and select them, sync your iPod/iPhone or whatever, and turn subtitles on from the device itself)
