It is mentioned in the description, to encode this I used Holyroses' 'Windows PiZ (PSP, iPod, Zune) Encoding'. This isn't a usual program for converting videos, it is a command line based tool combined with the correct instructions in order to perfect these videos for handheld devices. If you have no idea what I'm saying, then I wouldn't touch it. Unless you want to learn how to do it by researching it thoroughly, it took me a very long time to learn how to do this, and even still I only know the basics. HR has done all the legwork on this, I'm just uploading things he/she has'nt yet.
