,lydonit13,2010-05-11T17:58Z,"Please pardon my ignorance, but this is just one Beatles song, right?  If so, this must be VERY high quality.  I know all about FLAC, but I've never seen such a large file size for one song. A 16-bit, 44,100Hz uncompressed WAV might be smaller.  Is this 24/96, or something else?"
