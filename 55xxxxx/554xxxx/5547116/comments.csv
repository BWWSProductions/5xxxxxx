,RellikFolla,2010-06-07T23:48Z,"Hey, could somebody help me out? I've already downloaded this and I am trying to install, but when I install I choose my language and then it tells me that Microsoft Visual C++ SP1 Redistributable is required by the software.... I already have it installed (did so through the windows site) and when I click on install anyways it just""requirements not met, Click OK to exit install"" and the installer closes...

I am running Windows XP.
Thanks in advance to anyone knows what the problem is here."

,PerkinsII,2010-07-20T19:07Z,Wait it was just a trial the last comment i posted what i did was update to the latest version(from the website) and patched it with the first program but i also patched it with the keygen(u have to select sonyvegas 9 series before u click patch) and from the dropdown box select sonyvegas 9.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series click generate and then open it and when it says register enter a serial(leave the program open so u can get activation code) click register from another computer and enter fake info then enter the activation code from the keygen) then when it opens it should show who its registered to and the serial!!! Good luck ur done P.S. the keygen has catchy music!!! =)
,wowjoakim,2010-07-25T02:53Z,"same problem with all the sony vegas i have downloaded, it says that Microsoft Visual C++ SP1 Redistributable is required. and then its the end of the install. so can't get anywhere with this problem"
,kol4,2010-07-26T09:36Z,"i don't know if it's just me or of people are ignorant to the matter, but i'm running this on xp, and i've experienced several errors with the application after a seemingly successful install

most noticeably, all sound and video fx are absent from the plugin chooser, and neither plugin presets or application preferences can be saved"
