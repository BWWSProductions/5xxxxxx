In the early 1980s, Charlie Wilson is a womanizing US congressional 
representative from Texas who seemed to be in the minor leagues, except 
for the fact that he is a member of two major foreign policy and 
covert-ops committees. However, prodded by his major conservative supporter, 
Joanne Herring, Wilson learns about the plight of the people are suffering 
in the brutal Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of the maverick 
CIA agent, Gust Avrakotos, Wilson dedicates his canny political efforts to 
supply the Afghan mujahideen with the weapons and support to defeat the Soviet 
Union. However, Charlie Wilson eventually learns that while military victory 
can had, there are other consequences and prices to that fight that are ignored 
to everyone's sorrow.
