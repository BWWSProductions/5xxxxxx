,nosferatu501,2010-05-20T21:45Z,"Hey dude, i recently downloaded your avatar 720p rip and it was awesome, great job. But i was wondering if you could point me in the direction of some dvd authoring software to rip them to dvd with? Everyone if tryed re-encodes them and so the file is too big for the dvd, and i know you kept the file below 4.7GB for this reason. Any help would be appreciated from fellow pirates aswell, cheers."
