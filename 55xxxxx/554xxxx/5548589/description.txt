"Moe Letter Blues"

As Mother's Day approaches, Moe narrates an 
episode in which he writes a letter to Homer, 
Apu and Reverend Lovejoy, who are 
vacationing with their children, and 
threatens to run away with one of their 
wives. While the trio tries to determine 
whose wife Moe is referring to, Homer, 
Lovejoy and Apu flashback to the intimate 
moments they initially ignored between Moe 
and Marge, Manjula and Helen Lovejoy. But 
when the boys return from their trip, they're
in for the surprise of their lives.

Enjoy :)
