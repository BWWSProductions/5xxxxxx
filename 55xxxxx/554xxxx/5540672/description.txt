Visualize Your Message

Also keep in mind that the modern reader spoiled by rich-media content... hates reading! In every single text he opens, he first looks for pictures. And even when scanning the rest, he still tries to associate whatever he's reading with familiar images rather than to get a grasp of the text.

So why keep your reader suffering? VISUALIZE your message by turning it into a 3D TEXT!

Go 3-Dimensional!

3D Text Commander turns any plain-text message into a captivating 3D text, letting you create your own 3D text logos, banners, messages and save it to your computer for use on your web pages, in documents and presentations.

Give your 3D text a perfect look. You can choose from a variety of professional templates and add your own pictures and text. Choose a font (all system fonts can be used), colorize it, size it, add transparency. Set your 3D text position right on the screen, in real-time by just dragging it.

Make your 3D text even more captivating by animating it. Toggling just a couple of extra checkboxes will turn your 3D text into a rotating 3D banner. The software comes with a library of pretty textures fitting just about any taste and demand.
