not great, but definitely watchable.
download took me 2 hours. which is average for my connection."
,cactus316,2010-05-08T14:16Z,"this is better than the watermarked/5mins missing at the end copy(s) out there. 

For a cam its ok and watchable. maybe A4/V5 or A5/V4. Thanks XoLWox

btw can anyone get a copy of valhalla rising. UK release date 30 April.

cheers"
,cactus316,2010-05-08T16:12Z,"when watched on the TV the audio is a bit distorted or something during the loud moments. it was better to watch on the computer, but maybe only coz it was easier to adjust the settings in VLC player than it was on the TV. still maybe you will have better luck with your TV and if you dont its still just about worth burning to dvd"
,ltcmdrData,2010-05-12T01:53Z,This IS the same watermarked version that has been going around. It's just been cropped to cut down size. Same quality as the others.
