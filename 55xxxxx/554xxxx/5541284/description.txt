The Orbâ€™s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld is the seminal 1991 ambient house concept debut album by the electronic music collective The Orb. The albumâ€™s framework is of a two-hour psychedelic trip though music genres and studio electronics, pushing the threshold of live stage performance. The double album is a continuous progressive composition consisting of several tracks advancing the travel concept and composed of vocal samples and sound effects interspersed with original music.
