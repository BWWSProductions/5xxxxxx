======================================================

Synopsis:


The British Prime Minister calling a voter a bigot has caused a sensation in the UK. Not only was it embarrassing for Gordon Brown, it touched a political nerve. The UK's Labour government has been accused of down-playing concerns about immigration and not doing enough for the white working class.

British musician and political activist Billy Bragg believes the government's lack of action on immigration, is playing into the hands of the far right. He talks to Zeinab Badawi.
