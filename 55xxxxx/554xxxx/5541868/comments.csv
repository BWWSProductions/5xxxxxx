Yes this idiot has actually cropped this perfectly good 16:9 to be 4:3 so as ""formatted to fit your TV"" as is quoted at the start. Well, fuckwit my TV and about another 6 billion on the planet havent been 4:3 for about 5 years."
,CaVinci,2011-04-11T05:11Z,I don't know how you did it but this movie looks great on a Full HD TV Good work. This movie is too old and still you keep the good quality and sound. The only thing was a strange line at the right side but not big deal. Thanks man nice work!!
