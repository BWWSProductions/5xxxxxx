Debaser is a simmered down version of the Northwest-based crew Sandpeople.  The two-man group is anchored by the rising star Sapient, who along with being the founder of SPâ€™s cutting edge sound has also produced tracks that feature the likes of Slug(Atmosphere), Aesop Rock, Inspectah Deck (Wu-tang) and many more.

In 2006, Debaser released their debut album titled Crown Control. The project quickly spread via word-of-mouth promotion and has secured itself as one of Sandpeopleâ€™s most successful albums to date.

Peerless is the latest effort by the hardworking pair with features from some of indie hip-hopâ€™s most household names like The Grouch(Living Legends), Cage (Def Jux) & Eyedea (Rhymesayers).  Debaserâ€™s new album Peerless is now available everywhere, including a special iTunes version that comes with a 14-page digital booklet & bonus track featuring Eligh (Living Legends)!

Donâ€™t miss out on the brand new album by one of the Pacific Northwestâ€™s finest!
