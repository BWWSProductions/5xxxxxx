The newest, and largest, vehicle carrier has 13 decks the size of 11 football fields.

With the ability to ferry 8,000 luxury cars, heavy trucks and tractors from one continent to another, the Faust is the biggest and the newest ocean faring vehicle carrier on the planet. This ship boasts 13 decks the size of 11 football fields to accommodate her wheeled cargo - big or small - without leaving a single scratch or a dent.

Not only is her capacity impressive, but every inch of Faust is designed to make her one of the most environmentally-friendly ships afloat. And with state-of-the-art technology throughout, she's so fully automated she hardly needs a crew.

But a winter crossing of the North Atlantic requires more than high-tech instrumentation to dodge rough waves and gale force winds directly in her path. Watch as this trip puts every one of her 22-member crew to the test.
