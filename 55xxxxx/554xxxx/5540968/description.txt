Hi all hope you are all well. I thought I should just share a little Goody with you all.
Here Is the Dsp Waldorf XTk, took me some time  to compile the new bac file but its working fine now 
To install Just insert this pack to for example : C:Program FilesSteinbergCubase SX 3Vstplugins
i did  a new skin and new banks and added a new mod from the existing dsp ,the mod has its own banks as well.


for info on the hardware synth please check this link

another important thing  you should know is when i did the mod  I made it hardware compatible so you can download banks for the hardware synth and import them into this vst via bank import

well have fun and Enjoy
cya all Fschd1
