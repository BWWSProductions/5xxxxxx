Orbus Terrarum is the third studio album of electronic music artist The Orb released on Island Records in 1995.

Before leaving The Orb, member Kris Weston had begun work on Orbus Terrarum. However, when he left The Orb, German producer Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member. The Orb, now consisting of Alex Paterson, Andy Hughes, and Fehlmann, finished producing Orbus Terrarum. Unlike previous albums by The Orb, Orbus Terrarum featured more â€œearthboundâ€ and â€œorganicâ€ sounds instead of the trippy science fiction themed music they had previously written. Orbus Terrarum suffered, as Paterson described it, â€œa good kickingâ€ at the hands of the British press, who described it as â€œgeneric ambient musicâ€ and stated that it was a low point for Patersonâ€™s creativity. Orbus Terrarum further alienated many of the groupâ€™s fans as they had with Pomme Fritz, causing the album to only reach #20 on the UK charts, much lower than their previous albums. American critics, however, gave it great acclaim, including Rolling Stone who made it their album of the month, citing the albumâ€™s symphonic flow coupled with The Orbâ€™s â€œuniquely British witâ€.

A quote from Tony Benn, Labour MP, graces the inner case of the 1995 release and the CD booklet of the 2008 re-issue. It says, â€œThere may be a legal obligation to obey, but there will be no moral obligation to obey. When it comes to history, it will be the people who broke the law for freedom that will be remembered and honoured.â€
