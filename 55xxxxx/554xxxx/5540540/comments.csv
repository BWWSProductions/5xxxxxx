I've been looking all over the internet for these episodes!

Is there any chance of getting them in the unaltered 720p format?

Either way, thank you so much!"
[T],solstars,2010-05-07T21:22Z,The 720p version would give you the same quality with black bars around all four sides.  There is no benefit to getting it in 720p format.  No quality improvement since this is 480p material that is upconverted by the network (hence the black bars).
,YamishiXV,2010-05-07T22:52Z,"Oh, I see. Sorry, I misunderstood!

Anyway, thanks again! Looking forward to Just Another Manic Kahn Day! :D"

Are you supposed to convert them to a certain file or what?  Also very fast torrent good quality thank you for sharing!

[T],solstars,2010-09-30T16:29Z,What WMM files?  There are no WMM files in this release.
