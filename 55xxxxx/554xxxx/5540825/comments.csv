Proper Notes:
The release from Fairlight does not work. They simply didn't crack it!"
,iCE_DiCE,2010-05-07T14:35Z,WARNING! Skidrow PROPER version is out! Don't use this one.
,masterfaster2,2010-05-07T16:15Z,Or you can download this torrent (which has good download speed) and use the crack from SKiDROW release.

,DenisVase,2010-05-08T17:53Z,"I have launched the game without using the Skidrow crack. 
I guess it has been cracked by FLT.
The FLT Installation Information is valid. 
I have extracted it, burned it, and I am playing right now.
Good luck, all!"
