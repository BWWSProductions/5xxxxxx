Ludacris - Red Light District - Live In Amsterdam [2004] DVDRip

Description
Following his performance in the lauded 2005 feature film CRASH, Ludacris flips back to music for this release. Combining 10 live tracks with a bevy of extras, THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT is a fine way to sample Ludacris's musical talents. A tour of Amsterdam's Red Light District is one of the many highlights, with Ludacris sampling some of the many pleasures that can be found there, including some very potent weed. Four music videos are also included, all of which were filmed while Ludacris visited some of Amsterdam's finest storefronts, where he coerced some of the city's finest ladies of the night to join him as he performed.
