I checked this guy's torrent, he .rar'ed the .iso.

WTF for, I don't know..."
[V],thethingy,2010-05-08T19:19Z,"LColCAF, raring an iso creates an iso of the same size or slightly smaller, ive just looked at his and they are iso files not rar.

does this have acrobat?, is that whats missing?"
,skipbr,2010-05-08T19:23Z,The original release was rar'ed (from what I've seen on TL)... the other one is the same thing... he just unpacked it before sharing.
[V],thethingy,2010-05-08T19:45Z,"skipbr, you cant unpack an iso, you can copy the files from an iso and that gives you the same size of files as in the iso "
[V],Chris-Aksel,2010-05-08T21:39Z,"@thethingy
This version dont have acrobat too . It is 2 dvd's only , no acrobat in here cause acrobat was not updated . When they update acrobat then they will make 3 DVD'S RETAIL Version and there is acrobat . :)"
,cajuclc,2010-05-08T21:47Z,"Guys, this is rar and other is unziped.
So other one size is bigger.
I have downloaded from a private tracker and created this one.
It's only English (I hoped it was multilingual) and I think there is no Acrobat (Adobe page says you must download Acrobat). I already have Acrobat, so I did install and it's working. This one has activation. Read .nfo."
[V],thethingy,2010-05-08T21:47Z," WordL, its still 3gb smaller than the retail version linked in the first comment??????????"
,cajuclc,2010-05-08T23:29Z,"Even the retail DVDs of Master collection, dont contain Acrobat 9 it comes on its own DVD inside the box.

Inside a retail master collection you get

DVD1 - Master collection
DVD2 - Master collection
DVD3 - Content
DVD4 - Acrobat 9


EDIT - Taken from the Read Me on DVD1 of Master Collection

""Install your software

Install a Creative Suite 5 edition from disc

The components of Adobe Creative Suite 5 Master Collection are located on multiple DVDs:

? Adobe Creative Suite 5 Application DVD set (multiple discs)
? Adobe Content DVD (a single disc, contains the 32-bit support package for Windows)
? Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Application DVD (a single disc)

The product box also contains serial numbers for the following:

? 32-bit support for Production Premium CS5 and Master Collection CS5 (Adobe Premiere
Pro CS4 and After Effects CS4) (Windows only)

Locate all installation media and serial numbers before you begin the installation process."""
,skipbr,2010-05-09T16:28Z,"@thethingy 
as cajuclc said, this one is still packed, hence the 130 rar files instead 2 iso files (as the other torrent).
You can't unpack an iso for sure, but you can pack it into smaller files.

From whats been said around private trackers, you can download ""Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended"" which is by far a better option."

Cant evade ( get past) the activation code popup.

I have to each time use the keygen on startup, fine, but when u have Photoshop, illustrator, Dreamweaver, Flash etc it gets kind of irritating AND I guess I?m gone run out of codes!!

I have done as described: used the ?127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com? in
Windows / system 32 / drivers / etc / hosts
