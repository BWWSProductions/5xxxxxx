It's about time J-Church got around to putting out another compilation album of all their impossible-to-find singles that were released between 1993-1996. Sure all this material has been previously released, but no matter how much time and money was put into looking for all their scattered EPs, there's a guarantee that Nostalgic for Nothing has something you don't have. Still a lot of the J-Church trademark of laid-back pop-punk with the touching, poetic lyrics -- but it never gets old. There are also some pretty classy renditions of Heavenly's "Cool Guitar Girl" and Duran Duran's "Planet Earth." Convenient, easy to find, and a lot cheaper than if one purchased all ten of the singles included here.
