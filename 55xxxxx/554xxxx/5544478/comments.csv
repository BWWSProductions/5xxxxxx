[V],meech,2010-05-13T22:48Z,"Gaukou:
Sorry about the Spanish/French.  Living in the U.S., I have the NTSC dvd's.  For whatever reason, the Spanish/French audio is included on only (I think) the first season.  I assumed it would be like that for all of the seasons, but noticed the difference when I broke out seasons 2-4.  Seasons 2 and 3 only have one English audio track included.  Season 4 has two audio tracks: English and English Director's Commentary...which I will be including with the season 4 torrent.  Season 5 also includes an English commentary.  I haven't checked out the other seasons yet.  So to answer your question, unfortunately the dvd makers did not decide to keep the Spanish and French audio tracks with subsequent seasons after season 1."
,Gaukou,2010-05-14T01:16Z,"Thanks for your complete answer. I'm impressed !
And I take notes for the next seasons. Keep up your excellent work !"

,tra1n3d-sh00t3r,2011-02-05T18:00Z,very good torrent... only wish it was a bit smaller
,technosailor,2011-04-07T21:23Z,"Great job but what about making 2 qualities, 444 MiB and 888 MiB?"
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:42Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys

,gix10000,2011-09-12T17:15Z,"FFS SEED!!

For the leechers who don't seed or don't know how;
Doubleclick on the torrent in Utorrent or bittorrent, click on begin seeding. Second ; Options, click on installation help, click on start speed test. It optimizes your settings, afterwards click on store & close. You are set to maximum speed. 
Seeding means that you help speed the download for all downloaders, and yes, that includes yourself !!! LOL but true you know.
By seeding you add your computer's upload speed to the torrent in general, which ultimately
helps you too, it is that simple...
I don't know how to make a torrent, so i am very greatfull for people like meech, however, i haven't read the reason or neccesity for seeding anywhere besides the reason i just gave.
It might be handy if the skulls include the reason/neccesity in their describtion of the movie. Just a suggestion :)
Greetz and a joyfull year folks :)"
,MortnoiR,2012-04-02T10:36Z,"Great set of archives, well done Meech, however I noticed episode 4 the gamekeeper does not load on my VLC or mediaplayer classic, nor on my Veolo, I get a cannot render the file, anyone else have that problem?"
,MortnoiR,2012-04-04T16:13Z,"Me bad, I downloaded the torrent again, must have been damaged the first time, now all is fine. Great job Meech, thanx a lot"
