All 8 of TOOL's music videos, including both versions of Vicarious.


These are the best versions I could find on the web. The search for all of them took a bit of time, so I wanted to share my hard work.

For 6 of the videos you will need VLC. They are in mkv format. The first version of Vicarious is in mp4 and the Enlightenment version is in avi format.

Tool is an amazing group of talented musicians and artists. Be sure to buy their albums and DVD's whenever you get the chance. 

Enjoy!
