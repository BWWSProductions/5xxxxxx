I was fortunate to get this from one of the great people at TTD as a bonus on a memory stick that is still making the rounds via USPS. It came to me in shn. Reading comments on torrent posts over the years, I'm surprise at how many don't know how to work with .shn so I converted this to flac8 for fast easy enjoyment as you will want to hear this. I also therefore had to fingerprint the flacs. Those were the changes. This is great quality music all around. Nice artwork is included from rcomet69.

This was here from 12/2004 into 2005 from Jackstraw_1969 then reseeded again in 2007 by trustthex also by request.

As far as the rest, it's already said better than I can ever say it. The comments of the original poster are in blue text.

Thanks very much to Jackstraw_1969 for the music torrent and to rcomet69 for the art. ...69?

Song titles in quotes I took from lyrics and aren't official, the rest are either my best transcription of announcements or from titles I looked up.

These tracks come from multiple broadcasts, specific locations and dates are unknown, but at least some of the tracks were recorded at The Zanzibar Club in NYC.

Generally, the quality is very good for the time period it comes from. I don't feel it's anything that detracts too much from the music.

Hope you all enjoy this disc - it's like taking a step back in time -
