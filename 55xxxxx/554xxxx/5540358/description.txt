"Isobel"

Isobel (guest star Mia Kirshner) returns to town and 
stuns Alaric (Matt Davis) with her attitude and her 
demands that he arrange a meeting with Elena (Nina 
Dobrev.) When mother and daughter finally meet, 
Isobel refuses to answer most of Elena's questions, 
but reveals that she will stop at nothing to find 
the mysterious invention Johnathan Gilbert has been 
searching for. Isobel's dangerous actions lead 
Stefan (Paul Wesley), Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and 
Bonnie (Katerina Graham) to step in and help Elena 
deal with the situation.

Enjoy :)
