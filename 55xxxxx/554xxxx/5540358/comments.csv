,AvBNeO,2010-05-08T09:45Z,"have been using pirtates bay n torrentz n have been downloading for 10 years, registered on pirates bay only so that i can comment on this torrent.

In my 10 year use of torrentz i have never come across a torrent like this which stops at 99percent for more than4-5 hrs on my 2mbps download connection it was still at 99percent, in d end i downloaded the ez tv genuine torrent .avi file n saw d episode...

so conclusion is that something very very wrong with this torrent if any 1 other has maaged to completely download this torrent then congratulations n for d rest recommend to look elsewhere."
