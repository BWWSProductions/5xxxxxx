Synopsis:
David is a successful writer. He got a few awards. His publisher puts all his eggs in one basket and pays him a huge advance on his next three books. But just as David's supposed to write his fingers to the bone he runs out of ideas. Frustrated he tries to find inspiration with alcohol, sex and women. His randy publisher likes to fuck literature-journalists and lets David join in. When David, after spilling some sweat and sperm, gets some ideas, he's choked to death by a female author-friend who then steals his manuscript and becomes famous. Fiction or reality?
