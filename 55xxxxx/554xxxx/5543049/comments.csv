,EnisFe,2012-01-05T11:43Z,I Didn't Download at all it i'm currently on this way but ... work it on XP >?
,PandaBear1147,2012-01-31T01:00Z,"for any who are having trouble with this torrent, first, make sure that your system specs can handle the game.  next, make sure the crack of this game is the right version, otherwise it will never work.  I believe this game was developed for xp and vista so for us win7 users, just set the crack.exe to windows xp(service pack 3) compatability.  it ran like a charm for me 100%"
,Deathuponyou97,2012-03-23T04:18Z,im just getting a black screen with music and a different cursor when i launch? suggestions?
