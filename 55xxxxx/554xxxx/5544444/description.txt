        A brand new urban music and culture show, hosted by none     
        other than Radio 1Xtra's Mistajam. Featuring an explosion of 
        the hottest and freshest comedy, fashion, sport - and of     
        course music from the UK and beyond. We hang out in the      
        mountains with Skepta, Chicago's Kid Sister gets her nails   
        done and Master Shortie talks fashion. As if that wasn't     
        enough Plan B tells it like it is and rocks the house from   
        the 1Xtra live lounge.
