Video Jukebox Collection â€“ A collection of music videos containing lots of different kinds of music including Pop, Dance, R & B, Soul, Hip-hop and Rock.  These videos I got a while ago from another tracker but the person who had uploaded them had made a mess of it.  The videos were all named wrong and I had to sort them all out (took me a while).  When I got them a lot of the names were incorrect but now I have sorted these out completely and they are all named exactly right now.  Most of these videos are taken from a video jukebox from what I understand and they are clean without logos on them but a few of them do actually have logos but most are clean which is why it was a problem getting them named right.  The guy who did them didnâ€™t have a clue what all the videos and artists were called.  I have now corrected all these and also checked them all to make sure theyâ€™re of good quality.

All the videos are MPEG and the most common video size is 352 x 288 with a video rate of 2000kbps and at 25fps.  Also the audio is 44.1Khz in 16 bit Stereo.  Some of them are also in a slightly different quality of 352 x 240 with a video rate of 1150kbps and at 30fps but usually itâ€™s the 352 x 288 video size.  I have checked them all, some of them are actually 480 x 480 video size, 30fps and 480 x 576, 25fps both with 2500kbps video rate on average.  I noticed that a small number are also 448 x 336 video size at 1150kbps video rate with 25fps but not many.  Maybe there might be a few other very slightly different ones but I have mentioned the main ones already.  Every video is in 44.1Khz 16 bit Stereo sound regardless of what video size, video rate and frames per second they have been encoded at.

There are 654 videos in total across all 3 parts I have made.  Be sure to get all the parts if you want the whole collection otherwise you are always welcome to cherry pick at the ones you want, simply deselect the videos in say uTorrent before you choose to download them and just download the ones youâ€™re interested in, either way you can decide whether you want some or all of them.

The entire collection is 39.3 GBs, each torrent contains 218 videos in Parts 1, 2 and 3, all the way through the alphabet from A to Z.  I will seed it for a very long time and once I get it going hopefully lots of people will also help to seed this as itâ€™s a good collection of videos with some of the great artists of the 80s, 90s and 00s.  Iâ€™m sure it will be popular.  I am glad that I have sorted all these out now.  When I first got them they were so messed up in the naming it was very annoying but I have done the work now so nobody else has to.  If you play all the videos back to back then in total the time it takes to watch them all is 1 day, 18 hours, 52 minutes and 4 seconds so itâ€™s quite a lot of watching.

Hope that you enjoy these, if you click my name â€œSpandauBabyâ€ you will be able to see the other parts.

Makes a good video jukebox, I recommend loading all these into a playlist in VLC player and then randomise them in shuffle mode to give you a video jukebox experience...

Many thanks for downloading :)
