But.. maybe it's usefull when you seed for some time because untill this moment there are no real seeders at all.

Thanks!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-11T20:19Z,@mauzzz:  Thanks...  That is why it is the initial seed.  I have to get nearly all 40 gigs of this up first before then it can grow.  It will take a few days but it will get there eventually.  I am gonna be seeding 24/7.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-14T00:42Z,"Just over 28 gigabytes uploaded now so far... that's for all 3 torrents.  This thing is getting bigger and bigger by the day, it's taking a while for it to grow but surely enough when it gets there there'll be a lot of music videos being past around lol"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-16T18:23Z,Total now uploaded so far.... 51 gigabytes for all 3 torrents and rising.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-21T22:07Z,Total uploaded now: 72.8 GB
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-25T23:58Z,"I started this torrent on the 9th of May 2010 and it has now grown and almost all 3 of them have sucessfully uploaded.  Just this one is left, Parts 2 and 3 have already got going now.  With Part 1 I'm just getting it beyond 95% now at the end.  It has taken ages for me to upload these 3 Video Jukebox torrents.  It is now the 25 of May 2010 and I have uploaded almost 90 gigabytes for all 3!! LOL now that's a lot, I'm not that fast but that's quite a fair bit to get it going.  I hope that people will seed these fairly as I have taken just over 2 weeks to get them started properly."
