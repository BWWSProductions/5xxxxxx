,bhobson333,2010-05-20T01:39Z,"Thanks for the validation, Jack.  My only regret is that I couldn't include subtitles.  I used to use Auto Gordian Knot which would give me good external subtitles, but it's no longer working for me and no longer under development.  Anyone who has a good tool for extracting subs (and video) from a DVD please email me at nairb3200 at yahoo dot com."
,nalar,2010-07-01T19:54Z,Can someone confirm this is really the cropped letterboxed (ie. 4:3) version instead of the widescreen as it was originally shot and released?
,bhobson333,2010-07-07T23:22Z,"The DVD I ripped it from says 2.35:1 Widescreen.  It's dated 1998, from Universal Home Video.  It wouldn't surprise me if there's a better quality DVD release out there; this one was pretty cheap."

,bhobson333,2011-01-10T16:37Z,"Do not download this torrent.  If I could delete it, I would.  I re-made this at much better quality here:
