,brega10,2010-05-10T03:21Z,Thanks!  Can you recommend a reading order for these?  I wasn't able to catch it from the beginning.
[V],ParrowJack,2010-05-10T10:08Z,"You're both welcome.

brega10 the War of Kings torrent comes with a reading order.  As stated in description above there is no reading order for Realm of Kings.  Writer Andy Lanning stated ""It's less an event and more a state of mind."" about Realm of Kings.

After reading the Realm of Kings one-shot you can then read the other titles in any order."
