Realm of Kings is a comic book crossover published by Marvel Comics. The series, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, follows on from War of Kings crossover and leads into the upcoming Thanos Imperative storyline.

A giant time-space tear called the Fault has been created by Black Bolt of the Inhumans T-Bomb, which apparently killed both himself and the Shi'ar leader Vulcan.  The Fault becomes an immediate concern for both the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Nova Corps.  The Fault turns out to be a tunnel, leading to another universe which reeks of corruption and is ruled by evil organic masses that have consumed their universe like a cancer.  The being in this evil universe plan on imposing their Earth on the Marvel Universe, to enable their gods, the Many-Angled Ones, to continue to spread.

The crossover does not have a typical reading order as each title and Realm of Kings mini-series is self-contained and deals with how the different characters; the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, the Inhumans, Guardians of the Galaxy, Nova and Hiro-Kala (the second son of Hulk), deal with the situation.  After starting with the Realm of Kings one-shot you can then read any of the mini-series and Nova and Guardians of the Galaxy titles in whatever order you want.
