,vladmir21,2010-05-13T17:11Z,"thanks for the upload.
can you clarify beforehand if all the songs that are in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4905730/Top_500_GREATEST_Hip-Hop__amp__Rap_Songs_%284_TRUE_Fans%29_-StudB- 
are included in this torrent?
So i dont need to download that one, i will just download this updated one.
thanks!"
,luvingfreeedom,2010-05-14T00:47Z,"Yes, you are safe to just download the TOP 1000 :)"
,timbo084,2010-05-15T15:43Z,"Alright luvingfreedom, I gotta put this on the record.

I've been a musician for a while, always played rock music, but always had that special appreciation for true hip-hop. I don't care what a guitarist says, some of the rhythm and flow of the artists here seems impossible to do.

All my friends of course listen to mainstream rap, and don't really appreciate this stuff.

Well I've gotta say this: thank you. It isn't the album sales that preserve history, it's people like you, who bring the tracks to the unenlightened masses. This torrent means a whole lot to a whole lot of people. You've brought back memories and made new ones, just by making this torrent. You said you wanted some love for this? Well hell, I could never show it to you in words. This is amazing.

Thanks for all of this, it's absolutely flawless, clean, and organized. You keep pirate bay alive, and you keep hip-hop alive. Thank you for this."
,luvingfreeedom,2010-05-16T11:05Z,"Thanks, Timbo. Without the appreciate for the Top 500, from you, the downloaders, I would never have made the Top 1000. :)) Enjoy!"
,MrBUDD,2010-06-06T13:59Z,"Next time dont put 001, 002, 003, etc etc in front of the songs, very time consuming to delete it.."
,houghammichael,2010-06-16T05:50Z,"if someone could help me, downloaded the torrent and wont show in my itunes like all the other 1s ive downloaded, also says its only 31kb, not over 1 gig, any help would be great"
,luvingfreeedom,2010-06-19T11:41Z,"Really not sure why that would be -- if its not showing in iTunes it would make me assume it has something to do with where the actual files downloaded to, though. Otherwise, I'm lost :("
,Shoofy2,2010-06-21T13:13Z,"Thank you SOOOOOO much.

Seriously. I was into mainstream hip-hop for a really long time, but now that I've found this list... holy shit.

It has truly changed the way I listen to music. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH. "
,CeeJaaaay,2010-07-02T02:03Z,"Thank a bunch for the u/l- it's much appreciated. Check it out though, I was reading your description and you said ""If you're new to hip-hop, well, that's not fair, I wish I was you...."" That's awesome. I've said that same thing before about other things - movies, for sure. I'm not new to hip-hop, but I've never been a  fan, I dabble here and there, then let it go for long periods of time - years even. Recently, though I started re-living some of the old school stuff from my youth - Gang Starr, BDP, Erik B & Rakim, Tribe, the D.O.C. I was really just scratching the surface there, and kind of got away from it for a while (one thing I say about hip-hop is that there is a TON of shitty hip-hop out there) anyway, living in Detroit it was mandatory to check out the new Eminem album....that shit floored me! It's awesome having that fucker back on his game. So, yeah that album has me thinking about rap/hip-hop a lot right now. I haven't even listened to your mix yet, but I'm looking forward to it - 

Thanks again!!"
