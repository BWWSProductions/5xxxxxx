"Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicate's cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves." - From Wikipedia
