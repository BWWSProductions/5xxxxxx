[V],pluto999,2010-05-10T12:28Z,I've installed utorrent I was using bittorrent before and teh other thing you asked me to. So i can block using utorent or the other software? or should i google it if have a busy schedule..
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-10T15:12Z,"uTorrent and BitTorrent are the same program, just named differently for legal reasons. Both are OK.
Now, you should read again what I wrote to you just yesterday. Google and install PeerBlock and COMODO firewall. In Comodo disable Defense+ Security Level (check/mark Disabled) and install and use separate anti-virus program which has Web protection built-in. I use Avast!. All this software exists in free public versions on their home sites (never use hacked/cracked firewall, anti-vir. or similar program). Rest has been said."
