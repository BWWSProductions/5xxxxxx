another djsforfun exclusive!

To Our Forefathers came as a wonderful surprise. Not only because I had no idea
it was coming, but Iâ€™ve loved I Am Abomination since the moment I first heard
them. Fairly recently they got signed to Good Fight Music and therefore share
label with great bands such as This Or The Apocalypse and Cancer Bats. So how
will To Our Forefathers be in comparison to their previous release, Jaw Dropper?

Fortunately, theyâ€™ve managed to maintain the same sound and style theyâ€™ve always
had. Thereâ€™s still nothing out there that sounds like I Am Abomination. Okay,
you may be able to draw some parallels between them and Protest The Hero,
music-wise. But with their progressive guitars and Philâ€™s amazing vocals theyâ€™ve
really scaled their own mountain.

There was no screaming in Jaw Dropper, but you get a tiny taste of it in To Our
Forefathers. Songs like Rock Nâ€™ No Soul will provide you with their own form of
catchy post-hardcore and brutal screams which, by the way, are pretty similar to
Trevorâ€™s (Our Last Night) new style.

Introducing To Our Forefathers is Since 1776. If you hear it youâ€™ll understand
what I mean when I say Protest The Hero. Quite surprisingly, the lyrics in this
song are politically directed. I did not expect I Am Abomination to write about
that kind of stuff â€“ donâ€™t ask me why. I just donâ€™t get that feeling. Anyhow.
The chorus is masterfully executed and will have you sing along right away, and
in the end thereâ€™s some sort of orchestra that plays the same melody as the song
itself. Itâ€™s pretty cool, actually.

Each song is mostly built up with lots of sweeping, solos, reoccurring modest
electronics and melodies that radiate positive energy â€“ you get real happy when
you listen to them. A real treasure is The Deceiver, which is without question
the best song on this album. It feels like I could listen to it forever and ever
and never tire. The chorus sets me in a trance each time it comes, and the
lyrics fit very well. The small â€œbreakdownâ€ with the lyrics â€œThis is survival of
the fittest, where is your savior now?â€ is real mighty. The verses are very
fast-paced and packed with energy and it almost makes me want to dance around in
glee.

Next up is aforementioned Rock Nâ€™ No Soul. Being the only song with screams in
it, it serves as a sort of pace breaker (even though itâ€™s only for like 8
seconds). Whenever I find pace breakers I instantly recognize a bands skill to
make their songs unique instead of them all sounding the same.

To Our Forefathers is an amazing follow-up to Jaw Dropper, and evidently they
havenâ€™t lost their touch. Philâ€™s vocals are as amazing and there are as many
sweeps and catchy builds as before. Solid effort by I Am Abomination, and I hope
they will be making a tour in Europe soon â€“ they are ready for it.
