102 Episodes of Mike Duncan's - The History of Rome

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A weekly podcast tracing the history of the Roman Empire, beginning with Aeneas's arrival in Italy and ending (someday) with the exile of Romulus Augustulus, last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire.

This is a free podcast. You can download all of these episodes from his website free of charge. The reason I've put it here is because I have downloaded, sorted, renamed and tested all of the files for everyone's convenience. I have also added a folder with all of the images that correspond to the episodes. If at some point he says "Go to the website and see diagram ???" you can just look in the folder and find the image with a matching name.

Sweet eh?

Anyway, this is a fantastic effort by the author and I highly recommend going to his website to download future episodes and maybe shoot him a few dollars for all his hard work over the years.
