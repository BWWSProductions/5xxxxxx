,bukopie,2010-05-12T03:27Z,"why is it people who upload stuff for others to download don't include appropriate instructions. If you want us to reseed to others then at least give us a chance to get the bloody thing working. i downloaded this only to be offered 2files neither of which i could open. only by luck did i manage to get daemon lite to open the cue file which then installed the game. Crack File??? where is it. why do you assume that everyone who downloads something knows what to do. we all had to start somewhere including you so please follow up with better instructions as i have yet another game from pirate bay that i cant get to work. your info says install game, copy crack, and run, what a laugh"

,GreatL,2010-05-12T16:59Z,Are you blind? Crack on CD!!
,joethehoe,2010-07-17T07:14Z,"I agree with bukopie, I could install the game and find the crack just fine but I usually look for torrents with clear instructions before I download. I got an error message saying \""cant init hal device\"" after I copied the crack and pasted it into the exe folder"
