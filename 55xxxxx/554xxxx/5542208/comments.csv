,MARKOS-MK,2010-05-15T21:19Z,"Clean torrent, Avira Premium SS 10 do not detect anything suspicious.

Thanks for great upload. "
,SisterAttitude,2010-05-22T19:10Z,Excellent working torrent! Thanks.
,Breoghan,2010-05-24T01:38Z,"Downloading now, I sure hope this is not one of those trial versions I could save an hour downloading from the makers site: http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html , and is an actual FULL version without time and software limits like the last one I downloaded. I only need it to rid one bad install that I cannot remove. FYI - NEVER install a Cakewalk product if you have direct X ver 9."
,Breoghan,2010-05-24T02:44Z,"I see the crack, I used it, it works so far, anyway it seemed to remove Cakewalk from my system. Thanx for the upload."

,hdk94,2010-06-05T16:38Z,Works great. Thx
,comet.vermont,2010-06-08T02:55Z,"that's pretty funny, all the ""100% clean"" shit.  As soon as I attempted to install (& I should have known better, 1) it didn't look like Revo's Icon 2) it was the FIRST torrent I forgot to check 'anti-virus'...serves me right I guess) ALL my anti-virus software went NUTS!

fuck me right? fuck me...""Hey asshole, your trying to steal software so fuck you, HA HA HA! shithead""  fuck you

so what is all the RiteMood virus shit anyway you fucking cunt? "
,ZDaddy,2010-06-08T05:19Z,Checks out ok w/ NOD32. Thanks for sharing :-)
,pxpx,2010-06-09T17:07Z,"Thank you Library.Source & seeders! Works fine on Win 7 64-bit.

To all the dummies pretending that there is a virus in this file: get a life!"
,EnragedPlatypus,2010-06-11T02:04Z,"@comet.vermont & pizzapizza, Torrent is completely clean, scanned it multiple times with NOD32 and came up with nothing (Before and after install).

PS: any detection by your antivirus is probably a false positive due to the crack."
,porridge2,2010-06-13T15:47Z,"CONFIRMED TROJAN! DON'T DOWNLOAD!
The setup file has a file packed inside it called gpupdate.exe which executes upon startup of the installer... Avast also detects this as NSIS.Downloader-DB. Now, inside gpupdate.exe is a file called intec.dll. I managed to decompile the file and found out that it infact is a download-trojan. I found out that it connects to the internet and is capable of downloading files onto your computer and also UPLOADING files from your computer which means that it can steal your files and personal data. However, i didn't manage to find out which site it connects to so everyone DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS!!!! Feel free to prove me wrong, but that would be difficult since i am speaking the truth..."
,incurablegeek,2010-06-13T21:49Z,"From this Dummy to others who feel ""enlightened"". please heed the advice of porridge2 and 

                    DO NOT INSTALL 
       (lest you wish to reinstall your OS)"
,comet.vermont,2010-07-27T12:29Z,"Well there ""EnragedPlatypus"" & ""pxpx"" I like how everyone claims that they checked these torrents with NOD 32!!!!!! the end-all be-all of anti-virus.

I have Nod 32 & this torrent FUCKED EVERYTHING UP as soon as I opened it & NOD 32 caught the virus, along with Avira, & Microsoft security essentials.

Just because you believe that your a super-computer-hacker-genius-i'm-smarter-than-you'll-ever-be-you-stupid-nOoB-Ha-hA-HA-DArW!n!eN/H-1-9-4-2-4/L!FE! & all that other bullshit doesn't mean that every ""crack"" is a false possitive.

DONT DOWNLOAD THIS!!!!"
,comet.vermont,2010-07-27T12:31Z,"BTW...

fuck off.

,EinStupid,2010-08-16T06:34Z,I'm using this with no problems. Never a sign of a virus. Someones crackwhore mother forgot to feed their little junior addicts.
,EinStupid,2010-08-16T06:55Z,"I downloaded again and no virus' or any thing else found other than Revo Uninstaller. You people having problems should ask for help, plenty here. I first started here and comcast screwed most keys and such up and deleted them. Don't think you know more than the people who crack and do the work we enjoy. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. THANKS TO ALL UPPERS."
,cembaum,2010-09-01T22:59Z,"THANKS !!!! Works great !!! No bugs that I have noticed, very nice."
,visable3,2010-12-25T00:27Z,"hey you fucking retard its full of trojans ,BEWARE DONT DOWNLOAD ,uploader get a fuckin life you sad geeky  twat."
,SpiritWolfe,2011-06-25T09:25Z,"@visable3:

First off seems to me you CANNOT READ, motherfucker! If you put your little mouse over the nice purple skull & x-bones it says ""TRUSTED"" (in this case)... this means Library.Source has BEEN DOING THIS and posting on to TPB ... for a VERY LONG TIME! 

It is JACKASSES like yourself that does not know WTF they are doing! 

Like people have said here, even in THIS torrent, ask for help! We UNDERSTAND that people need help with sites like The Pirate Bay. YOU are NOT the first and certainly NOT the last!

HOWEVER, DO NOT GO FLAPPING YOUR FUCKING LIPS ON ISSUES THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE *FUCK* ABOUT! HONESTLY! 

This is also implied to the other IMPS that are dittoing the SAME THING!

I have gotten some excellent help here with software that I needed for school and getting myself through college. 

It is GREAT PEOPLE like the ones on TPB that work tirelessly and effortlessly to bring us these programs and offer 100's $ in help FOR FREE!  It might take some time to get a response, not all of them check in every day, some do, most do not. 

It PISSES me OFF to no end (and I am SURE I am NOT the only one) that PEOPLE such as yourself cannot seem to POLITELY ask for help!

SOMEBODY NEEDS A SERIOUS *BITCH SLAPPING* and a REALITY CHECK on their attitude!

GET A LIFE AND STOP HARASSING THESE GOOD PEOPLE!

Okay, I vented....I feel better now...

Cheers!

By the way....

THANK YOU....

For the download, man!

Nice Job!
