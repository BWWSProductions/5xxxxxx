For over a month, I've been helping to seed.  According to my torrent manager, I have uploaded (shared) this torrent 12.4 times.

Also, according to my torrent manager, the Seeding Rank is still 99999, which is the highest level of demand and the lowest level of availability.

In other words, people are downloading this torrent, but not sharing it afterward.

I expect more from the Classical Music aficionados.  Please share after you're done downloading.  Again, for instance, I've shared 12.4 times, so far.

If I were to begin rambling on, I might also mention that Comcast recently announced that they have started limiting us subscribers to 250 GB per month, combined upload and download.  In April I hit 113 GB, in May I hit 226 GB.  And most of that was sharing torrents, not downloading.

In June, I'll try to eek a little closer to the 250 GB limit, but I can't do too much more.  After sharing this torrent so many times, it would be nice to see the Seeding Rank finally drop.  Something less than 20000 would be comfortable.

f you seem to be having trouble breaking in to Classical Music, this TV program is smart and enjoyable. Narrative intersperses the musical selections. Excellent musicianship, speedy fingers, and Mendelssohn and Schumann (the composers) have always been favorites.  Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax, and Izaak Perlman are three of the most favorite performers today."
