,Xx_ucantwin_xX,2010-05-11T02:52Z,How do we do step 2
,Jake1715,2010-05-11T03:18Z,Great torrent. downloaded and worked perfectly for me. keygen and all worked perfect. Thanks allot outsidereunu!
,sisco09,2010-05-11T05:33Z,"Ok guys, for all of you that are having trouble with this torrent:
1. Extract everything to your desktop using WinRAR or something similar. 
2. Open the Adobe CS5 folder and double click the Set-up.exe archive. This will allow you to install Photoshop. When asked to enter a serial key just click the option to install the trial. 
3. After it's installed, go back to the original folder on your desktop that contains the extracted materials and right-click the keygen.exe archive. The reason many of you will be getting the ""Patching Failed"" message is because you skip a very important step. You must right-click on the keygen.exe file and select ""Run as Administrator"" to get it to work properly. If you have installed Photoshop correctly go ahead and click ""Patch"" in the keygen window and you should get a confirmation message saying it was successful. 
4. Now, before closing the keygen or clicking ""Generate"" in the keygen, copy the key that appears in the window. In other words, after you hit ""Patch"" and you get the confirmation message, immediately copy the code that appears in the keygen window. DON'T CLICK GENERATE. I experimented a couple of times and found that if you click generate after you hit ""Patch"" the key won't work. You must use the one generated automatically. 

I hope this helps some of you guys, however, I am a mediocre techie so I'll try and answer any questions you guys might have that do not go too far into detail as my knowledge is not too profound. Thanks guys!"
,howya,2010-05-11T20:22Z,Many thank's sisco09. Followed your instructions and it worked a treat. Thank's again to outsidereunu for the UL.
,bigflirt383,2010-05-11T20:50Z,i installed this and followed the instructions i got to 3 and the patch was successful but i didnt write the code down and now its not working :( any pointers?
,sisco09,2010-05-12T05:10Z,"@bigflirt383

This happened to me as well. Like I said in my last comment, I experimented a couple of times with the keygen before I got it right. If simply right-clicking the keygen.exe archive and hitting ""Patch"" is not giving you a successful confirmation message again, just uninstall Photoshop and start from scratch. You should still have the download somewhere on your hard drive, most likely in your downloads folder. So, just try doing step 3 again and again. If you are unsuccessful, then uninstall everything and start from scratch and be sure to copy the code that is given once you get the confirmation message. I too had to do step 3 numerous times until I reinstalled everything and it worked. I hope this works for you!"
,brushfoot,2010-05-13T05:27Z,What's up with the TR/Drop.Agent.81920 that Avira AntiVir finds in this?
,sisco09,2010-05-13T05:54Z,No idea dude. I am running Photoshop perfectly with no viruses. I scanned numerous times.
,brushfoot,2010-05-13T06:23Z,"There were two files that came up with the TR/Drop.Agent.81920 trojan in a subfolder of the payloads folder. I found and deleted them and it installed okay. Seems to run okay too, but I can't be sure about all the functions. They were files #1 and #164 in the subfolder."
,sisco09,2010-05-13T06:34Z,"Good to hear. I've been working with it for about four days now and it's been fine. Like I said, I scanned it and my system numerous times and found nothing. Glad it's working for you."
,brushfoot,2010-05-13T06:34Z,"Oh, and it wouldn't let me ""Run as Administrator"" cause I never selected a password and Windows wouldn't let me do it with a blank password, but it worked anyway after I selected my username from the dropdown menu."
,nick.davies,2010-05-13T17:11Z,Worked first time. Brilliant torrent
,drkwing3,2010-05-13T17:58Z,"I found I had to remember to ""restart"" photoshop and THEN start the keygen process. Even though the keygen says that the patch failed, I used the serial anyways and it works wonderful. Thank you very much."
,yuna27,2010-05-16T00:20Z,"Thanks for the instructions, sisco09. Tried that first try and no probs registrating it. I'm a total noob at photoshop, but I need it and ima study this now, lol. Thanks again."

,stomper101,2010-05-23T21:12Z,has any one tried installing photoshop from a dvd. it allways ask to insert ps cs5 cd. i would like to make a hard copy
,daotterone,2010-05-25T01:44Z,"If after installing Photoshop CS5 instead of launching you get the error message ""The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000001d). Click OK to close the application."" it is a known issue related to AMD CPUs (usually older AMD CPUs). You can follow the thread at Adobe Forums: http://forums.adobe.com/thread/630771?tstart=0

Adobe is yet to find a workaround but they're working on it. Hey, it happened to me and I went looking for an answer, just thought I'd share.

Happy to see it worked for so many others!"
