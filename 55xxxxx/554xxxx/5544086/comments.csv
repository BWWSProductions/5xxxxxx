720p turned out big - 700 MB. So, I encoded another ""size"", 480p (Hint to T_Fish and similar morons: 720x304) and that one would be 500MB.

,mattbdon,2010-05-08T15:46Z,"Hi 2040, Finally got my login problems sorted. An extra big thank you for uploading this early. I'm desperate to see it. Thanks for everything."
,lover2040,2010-05-08T15:51Z,"thanks for the details..!!!
i will be downloading the 480p!!


and till wat ratio would u like me to seed for that torrent?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-08T16:39Z,"LOL lover, as I said million times: I do not expect nothing, I never prescribed anything and I wont tell no one what person one should be.

People from all around the world need solidarity and understanding, for any reason imaginable.

I guess that they expect nothing what haven't been seen before. However, their appreciation could be shown at places that every human have."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-08T16:53Z,"@Matt: Glad to see you back. Speaking of devil - last night someone has logged-in under my name and using my password uploaded some shit.
Just imagine, someone log-in as ""mattbdon"" could visit torrents of prominent TPB members and spew insults, curses and similar crap. Then, as logical consequence, ""mattbdon"" gets banned. Not the real one.
Or - the same person log-in as me has unlimited access to my torrents. Delete one or more - or ALL together. Such person can up torrents with viruses, stuff he likes, practically do whatever he wants.
It happened less than 20h ago and it could happen again.
But - I am logged-in 24/7, how ANYONE else could log-in on already ""occupied"" user account I cannot take too easy.
As you have experienced first-hand, there is no one to help or to listen.
Well... welcome again in the pit."
