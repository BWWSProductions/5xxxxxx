,larisena,2010-06-23T08:57Z,is the software free?or u pay for using?
[T],victory144,2010-06-24T05:29Z,"@ larisena
Just burn the content of this Torrent into DVD, rename the   autorun  to autorun.inf   if you like to autoboot from DVD and you're done...Or can run that directly from your hard disk with  start.cmd  .


@ unix66 & @ larisena

At the License (in the description) say:
Its an open source software....  :)

So its free.... And you can donate if you like to support the project :)

,Scullyy,2010-07-22T18:47Z,wtf is up with comments
,davesantulan,2010-07-25T15:54Z,"for those who are having a problem with script messages, just install the latest version of Internet Explorer."
,cdkrash,2010-07-31T01:15Z,I had the same problem with this program changing my home page. I modified the HTML code and resaved it so that it doesn't do that anymore. If anyone wants it let me know and I'll post it. But definitely a sweet program!!!! Love it!!!
