The Ultimate Burning with Nero Burning ROM

Nero Burning ROM is probably the best all-in-one CDR / DVDR / Blu-ray application on the market.

Nero combines huge amounts of features in a compact and easy to use package. It handles disc duplicating and
pre-mastering with ease, supported by a cover designer and even an audio file editor. The excellent GUI desing
keeps all the functions handy and guarantees that simple tasks can be done quickly.

If you have to settle with just one CDR / DVDR / Blu-ray burning software, then Nero would be it.
