,kathpayx,2010-05-10T01:31Z,"Pixelated movie, poor rip"
[T],insinuendo,2010-05-10T01:44Z,"Maybe you need to update your equipment mate :)

...and get new glasses while you're at it.

This rip is fine and so is the audio.

You're welcome."
,kathpayx,2010-05-10T04:59Z,"I have an HP 8510W, which is an HD workstation laptop, with all the latest codecs.  The audio is fine on it, but the movie is pixelated.

I also have an LG 47LH50 w/ USB input, the video is fine, but the audio is not supported.  All my equipment is up to date, your RIP sucks.  Plain and simple."
[T],insinuendo,2010-05-10T10:58Z,"First of all it's not my rip. Second, you suck :)"
