,michaelcrossland,2010-05-08T07:51Z,This not a install disk. It is a working copy of 10.6.x that well run in VM Ware. I thing it boots in 32 bit so any intell P4 should work to host it as for AMD I have not tested it yet well post when i know more.
,naughtydougraw,2010-05-10T02:27Z,can i update it?
,crook71,2010-05-11T22:14Z,"I get an error regarding the encoding in the .vmx file: ...\Mac OS Snow Leopard.vmx"" line 2: Value ""8"" for variable ""config.version"" is not valid in encoding ""windows-1251"".

I am running on a win7. It seems that vmware does not want to allow windows encoding with a macos system. Or am I misreading something? I tried removing the line, the import went ok, but then I got a disk encoding error. Pls. help."
,derda2,2010-05-12T09:11Z,"never used vmware, installed ok but now? no iso only Mac*7z or alike.
What to do now? Thanks for help"
,JORdel,2010-05-12T09:53Z,Yep. I got similar. Is it  possible to get some short note to changing for understandable language.
,JORdel,2010-05-12T10:03Z,Nothing anymore. It was quite simple. Just navigate tools(below bar) there you find FLAG. All res;t use your own talent's.
,derda2,2010-05-12T12:05Z,nope i get a read. error discs seems faulty? 
,derda2,2010-05-12T12:39Z,ok loaded but where to change to english?

,paranoid_penguin,2010-05-12T22:57Z,"Boots great but it sure would be nice to have information on how to change the language to English. Some of you have posted that you changed it then don't explain how to do it. Clicking that 'FLAG' on the toolbar does nothing. 

Why would you post a torrent explaining everything in English when the OS loads in Russian? "
,derda2,2010-05-13T16:42Z,"now what's the ROOT password?

Can i enable Opengl 3d acceleration?

,merlin1976uk,2010-05-13T19:33Z,"well thanks for the upload, most i managed to do was install the VmWare software, when i try and load the MacOSX snow leopard it gets to the grey screen with the apple logo and then it just reboots it was saying something about a processor being in the process of shutting down or something? has anyone had this trouble and got around it?"
,sumaguar,2010-05-14T02:29Z,"To change to English:

1. Click on ?Apple Logo?, and then click on System Preferences (4th from the Top)
2. Click ""Internationalization"" (last icon on the top row, looks like a flag)
3. Click the button below the list (bottom left).
4. Select your language and click OK
5. Reboot or click around a bit and there you have it."

,johnmcarr,2010-12-30T20:16Z,"@fenderbenderczi: Yes, it is possible.  You have to ghost the virtual hard drive's image to your physical drive.  It's a bit complicated, but it has been done successfully several times."

,prugio,2011-02-16T02:50Z,"This one is SUPERB! I've tried others and a Kalyway install -- all had too many things wrong with them. But this one is excellent! The best so far. All you have to do is change the Russian language, change the home account name (if you want), and set it up. 

Only problem is that when I tried a restart it comes up with Operating System Not Found or something and hangs my whole Linux box. However, a shutdown works fine. 

Well done. Wish I'd come across this one before wasting so much time on the others. "
