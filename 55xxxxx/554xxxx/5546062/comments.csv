[T],winto_bungle,2011-06-03T23:49Z,@smarfling if you have such a problem with free music why dont you upload it your self or go out and actually buy the CD. dont be a jerk.
,Blackfilm,2011-11-11T23:01Z,"@smarfling - blame him for you wasting a cd-r.... when in fact its your responsibility to see all the songs are there before you burn it. GG bruv.

Anyway, awesome upload, thanks!"
