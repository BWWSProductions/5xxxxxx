19-year-old Alice returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure, where she reunites with her old friends and learns of her true destiny: to end the Red Queenâ€™s reign of terror. When Alice tumbles down, down, down a rabbit-hole one hotsummerâ€™s afternoon in pursuit of a White Rabbit she finds herself in Wonderland. And there begin the fantastical adventures that will see herexperiencing extraordinary changes in size, swimming in a pool of her own tears and attending the very maddest of tea parties. For Wonderland is no ordinary place and the characters that populate it are quite unlike anybody young Alice has ever met before. In this imaginary land she encounters the savagely violent Queen, the Lachrymose Mock Turtle, the laconic Cheshire Cat and the hookah-smoking Caterpillar, each as surprising and outlandish as the next.
