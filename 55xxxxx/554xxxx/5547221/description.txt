About this game:
In Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey, girls play as their own customized heroine, taking part in a fantastic adventure and helping the Disney Princesses restore order in their kingdoms. Girls exercise their creativity by choosing their character's name as well as customizing her look â€“ selecting hair color, skin tone, dresses and more. As they meet and interact with their favorite Disney Princesses, girls discover that each Disney Princess has a unique story and magical world. These stories inspire players as they ascertain the attributes of being a true princess -- courage, friendship, trust and discovery. The game's two-player mode allows girls and their moms or friends to work together to fix the princess worlds.
