Plot outline:
Sent on a National Geographic survey of the jungle to capture the largest anaconda, a group of cardboard cutouts posing as actors bite off more than they can chew and get chewed up by an over sized and very agitated snake. That sums up the film. What looks like it may be a turkey is saved by a CGI snake upstaging all the actors and devouring them. Unfortunately J-Lo survives since she would be too glamorous to be devoured and she would have made the snake look tame by comparison by throwing a hissy fit if she was to be eaten. The perfect Saturday night film showing that not all films need to aspire to Citizen Kane and fun for the sake of it is an art form in itself.
