Excellent Story, Screen Play, Photography... One among the best movie i have seen, among all the movies. This is a movie which has even dragged, Non-Kannadigas to movie theaters, and has made Bollywood make look into sandalwood ..

This movie shows the exotic location in karnataka. Totally filmed in Karnataka, Westhern Ghats. Every body will love this movie from young to old.

Excellent dialog's - very funny

Its the magic of director Yograj Bhat, who hails from the coastal district of Udupi. Three Cheers to him. He has returned charm to Kannada movies.

The best scene in the movie is the Jog Falls Photography in the song "Kunidu Kunidu Bare". And the best song is " Mungaru male-ye.. enu nina hanigala Lille.." followed by " Anisuthidhe yako induu.. nenenu nannavalendu..." 

The best is the ending.


Love is sweet, but sacrifice is immortal
