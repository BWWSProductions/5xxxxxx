Ai Lin (Shu Qi) and her sister Ai Quan (Zhao Wei) are computer hackers and espionage specialists who use their late father's advanced secret satellite technology to give them the field advantage over their enemies and the local law enforcement. At the start of the movie they assassinate the chairman of a top Chinese company.

In the aftermath of their successful mission, an intelligent Police Detective named Kong Yat Hung (Karen Mok) is assigned to their case and is able to track them down. The cat-and-mouse chase becomes more complicated when Lin and Ai Quan become the targets of the very people who originally hired them.
