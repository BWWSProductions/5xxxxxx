Sipola is released from the prison, but things dont start well. The life of crime has left him deeply in debts, and its time for payback. While hes getting money to pay off the debts, a local ex-gangster (current junkie) messes up things for Sipola even more, and a soon-to-retire hitman is sent after the duo. 

6 Killers is an adoration movie for asian cinema. Its a tribute to asian action/mafia movies, and Takashi Miike has been a big influece in it. The movie drills inside the characters, and hits the viewers straight in the face. An artistic view of the human mind, its weaknesses and its impact on life..
