This timely series set in a slumping economy follows the winding karmic adventures of fallen corporate exec, Steve Unger, who was caught cooking the books and now finds himself legally forbidden from working in any position that involves ?other people?s money?. Clinging desperately to the last vestige of his former self ? his luxury sedan ? Steve hopes to begin anew. Shunned by family and friends, under court order to teach an ethics class to other ?fallen angels?, Steve now makes his home inside his luxury car. Propelled ahead by his needs and whims, trying to simultaneously help and exploit everyone he meets, Steve attempts to survive in the land of the have-nots and at the same time somehow resurrect the charmed life he once had."
