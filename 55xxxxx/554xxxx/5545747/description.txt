Plot: Nawin (Jesdaporn Pholdee), an army secret service agent decides to withdraw from a scientific investigation because of unlawful procedures involving International Forces. Although he has tried desperately to avoid the illegal acts of the armed forces, it seems the harder he tries the more involved he becomes. He is constantly under surveillance no matter where he goes or what he does which makes him realize there is more to the situation than that meets the eye. Jin (Ploy Jindachote), a young woman whom Nawin once saved from a brutal attack, is undergoing a strange transformation within her body as her blood circulates through mutation. This transformation on Jin is what Nawin believes the International Forces are after, the half breed mix between animal and human. Nawin decides to help Jin by taking her back to her birth place. As he leads her home, her illness seems to subside. They will soon grow close and fall in love. When it comes time for Nawin to choose between her and his life, he awakes to find that it has all been an image of his imaginationâ€¦or was it?
