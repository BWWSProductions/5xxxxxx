                    The Vampires of Venice.                  
                    Science fiction drama. Desiccated corpses and  
                    terror fill the canals as the Doctor takes Amy  
                    and Rory to 16th Century Venice.

                    FoV used SeperateFields.Selecteven or more
                    likely an equivalent deinterlacing method in
                    their source decoder. We reproduced the same
                    effect using DirectShowSource with the DivX
                    h264 decoder and enabling deinterlacing in
                    the DivX decoder config.
                    
                    The use of this forbidden deinterlacing
                    method is most noticeable on the Doctor's
                    shirt, for example from 28:29 to 28:34.
                    
                    Deinterlacing should be disabled in the
                    decoder that you use with DirectShowSource.
                    Most sources are progressive and should not
                    be deinterlaced at all. And for sources that
                    should be deinterlaced use a deinterlacer
                    such as LeakKernelDeint in your avisynth
                    script.
