	 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
	 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
	 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
	 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
	 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
	 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
	 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

	 Think for yourself!
	 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
	 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
	 until you've researched it yourself.
