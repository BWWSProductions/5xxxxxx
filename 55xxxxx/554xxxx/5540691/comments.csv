,nerdicus,2010-05-08T12:16Z,"Sounds like an authentic CD rip, but if you had the CD I question why you'd rip at 128 CBR... Def better than i_make_trouble, but still some distortion at highly layered sections. Very 'noticeable on difference between us' at 1:50-2:10 ish. I didn't run it through an external DAC, but listened to it on studio quality earbuds (couldn't crank the B&Ws since it's 6am on a Saturday. Overall, not a bad job. Best yet. I just couldn't wait for my copy on Tuesday..."

[V],bubanee,2010-05-08T15:14Z,"@ nerdicus firstly i rip using VBR not CBR.. i'm guessing your using windows with no added extra ripping music programs so there for you will get a false reading typical windows. 
MP3 is a lossy format which at the top end you will ALWAYS get some sought of distortion no matter what... when i rip a CD it is set at 0 across the board.. for instance this Rip was made by DBPoweramp set at Slow, Secure, 2 Pass.. i swear by DB.. 
And to settle this matter once and for all it was released in Australia on Friday! 
anymore doubts from the next person.. GOOGLE IT!!!!!
have a nice day.. "

,Zefkaas,2010-05-10T13:50Z,"thank you so much bubanee. you just improved my life immensely. Jack White is the shit and alison mosshart...well of course she is amazing. anyway here's a torrent you should check out: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5459914/The_Pretty_Blue_Guns_-_Cutting_Heads_%28full_album_192kbps_2009%29
You might not have heard of the band but if you like the dead weather I'm sure you would appreciate it. enjoy..."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-05-13T03:37Z,"people make me sick complaining about quality acting like they know something.  people do it to me and i get my CDs free direct from the record label.  you say you own something and they call you a liar.  nice to see they know what is in your house and collections isn't it?  i own around 5,500 cds as of right now and they are all retail.

keep up the amazing work bubs.  you are the man."
[V],bubanee,2010-05-13T06:27Z,"Cheers All!

@ Zombifuzz... how are ya buddy.. yeah it's amazing i haven't had doubters in a long time it seems if i don't add [Cov+CD] i'm a fraud!!!! 
Ah Well i should know better by now they caught me in a bad week.. lol.. Keep up the good work too!!!! Bubs..."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-05-14T07:05Z,"i'm doing pretty well.  

as for the doubters, i think you are the most reliable person on TPB for music and i upload music myself.  yes, you are the best hands down haha.

if i download a music torrent it always has [bubanee] attached to it.  even if the cd is here with 10,000 seeds i still won't download it.

that's what happens when you have someone like you who uploads quality all the time."
,bongsrus,2010-05-14T11:41Z,zombifuzz is right. you the phukken man thx again as alway's. re: nerdicus i've got 150+ albums from bub's  and perfect every time. i search his torrents  first before anything. he own's this shit
[V],bubanee,2010-05-17T02:13Z,Thanx Z.. and B... :))))
,Seth01,2010-06-21T08:22Z,You rock many thanks for this!  You're 100% right about mp3 being lossy...it's not bubanee's fault.  nerdicus is just being a whiner.
,Klebacher,2010-07-24T11:15Z,Downloaded in less than a minute. Good Quality. What more could be asked for?
,leandrooduarte,2010-11-06T20:24Z,DL in 2 min! Great. But is Mr. White sounding like Michael Jackson or is it just my impression? ;-)
,defendor,2011-02-19T23:47Z,Sick album! Download this shit right away!!
