Audio and Video: 10 and 10.

kbuddy, in the description says what you need.
If you use Media Player Classic (like me), for the subtitles you just need to download Haali Media Splitter, VobSub and VSFilter (you can google for them). Then when you play the movie, you'll see a green arrow in the task bar, which will give you the option to watch with either of the three subtitles included (as you can see in the last picture of the description)."
