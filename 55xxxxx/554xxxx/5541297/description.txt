Classic Sci-fi film from the 60's



Dr. Steven Sorenson plans to tap the geothermal energy of the Earth's interior by means of a thermonuclear device detonated deep within the Earth. Despite dire warnings by fellow scientist Ted Rampian, Dr Sorenson proceeds with the experiment after secretly learning that he is terminally ill. This experiment causes a crack to form and grow within the earth's crust, which threatens to split the earth in two if it is not stopped in time.


This is an ISO ripped from a homemade DVD. 

The film itself is only of VCR quality.

A torrent exists for this film here but the OP stopped seeding before anybody had the full file.
