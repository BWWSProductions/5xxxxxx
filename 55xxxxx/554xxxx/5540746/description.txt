       Follow the Leader                                                 
       The Dudesons move to America and hook up with Johnny Knoxville's  
        good pal, bull-riding champ, Gary Leffew. While staying at the
        ranch, they decide to play a painful game of Follow the Leader,
        where they will get their ears nailed to a board, balls smashed
        on a stairway slide and face an angry bull while on stilts. The
        winner will get to crash in the master bedroom, while the losers
        get a "USA" cattle brand burned on their asses.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
