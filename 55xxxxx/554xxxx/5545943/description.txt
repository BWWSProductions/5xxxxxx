[color=cyan]Notes::::::::::::::::::[/color]
video was very orange in some effect, so lowered the saturation down quite alot, then changed gamma,
hue, and contrast...editting some of it just slightly, and some of it a fair bit..added slight video-denoise
and slight sharpness, added IMAGINES line audio (thnx) //prism
