Win7 Free Programs Pack

I collect this program pack for WIN7, as I needed few tools and programs for my laptop, and Find some of these very usefull.

IT'S ALL FREE PROGRAMS. no serials no keygens needed, and no drag.

Theres separate folder for Win7 gadgets and another one for Word 2007 and 2010 addons.

Theres NO burning programs in this pack or security/antivirus programs.

If you need some detailed info on programs, google for program name. All programs have version number in folder name.

Entire pack is scaned with Norton 2010 on 08. May 2010. And it's clean with this day virus definitions (IF YOU FIND ANYTHING SUSPICIOS POST IT HERE, SO IT DOESN'T SPREAD FURTHER).
