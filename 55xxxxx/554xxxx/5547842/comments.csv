[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-11T04:12Z,"yeah i figured it'd be better than upping all 3 albums, i did axis cause i love little wing, and its not on this record"
,JohnTheBastard,2010-05-21T20:58Z,"Hey HMVinyl, 

Notes say you are taking requests. I'm not sure where those are supposed to be submitted, so I'll post mine here in hopes that you see them: 

Pretty much the whole Radiohead catalogue, but especially Kid A and OK Computer.

Led Zeppelin's Mothership might also be a good option. Its got a good selection of tracks and I thought they did a great job with the remastering for that release.

Also, have you tried using BIAS Sound Soap to strip out the crackles and pops?

Thanks for all the awesome uploads!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-22T05:17Z,"this is exactly where to leave requests, only i personally HATE radiohead (sorry :P) but i'm working really hard to get Mothership, your totally right its a great collection of tracks, and I prefer to do greatest hits records, seeing as most people wont listen to the ""other"" tracks when it comes to dling vinyl rips

p.s. for everyone else

i just got my Kenwood KD-2055 up and running, if you dont know what that is, heres two words: Marble Base"

I was wondering if you could post the label & catalog info, along with the thickness number (i.e. 150g, 180g)"
