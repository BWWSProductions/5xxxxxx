,SapphireMP,2010-05-15T17:55Z,"Tested it out, so far works great. Running Windows 7 Ultimate."
,lucidpaul,2010-05-16T11:28Z,A huge thanks
,rodbrenz,2010-05-22T03:16Z,do this work on enterprise?
,Mush_Mushi,2010-06-03T01:12Z,"Work perfectly, even after ""this copy of windows is not genuine"" message. Tnx for the upload"
,mikeybeila,2010-06-03T03:54Z,"I installed win7 Full Retail on a second hard drive and installed it as the straight trial version. I right click, left click ""properties"" and get no area to enter a key.

I also downloaded the 1.79 loader. I open it and it gathers the info about my computer, but the buttons never light up so I can use this. I have let it sit in ""Please Wait"" mode for 30 minutes or better. I installed the same windows 7 and used this loader on another hard drive on this same computer and it worked wonderfully, but the file system recently encountered some trouble, which prompted me to install it on the second hard drive. HEEEELLPP!!"
,twopoint,2010-06-04T11:36Z,Tried this since the new geunine update and it dosent work for me
,pinesol,2010-06-05T04:14Z,"It worked for me today. My copy of Windows 7 had been declared not a genuine copy for a few days. After installing Windows 7 Loader, I don't see the nagging reminder any longer.

Thank a lot IIsuperIVIanII  for a fine peice of work. "
,xofz,2010-06-14T20:32Z,"Will this work on Windows Server 2008 R2 Trial, or will I need to get a retail/oem copy first?"
,stekenberg,2010-06-15T17:01Z,"Used all 5 modes, none of them work.
I have Windows 7 Ultimate and got the ""non geniune"" warning about a week ago..."
,davitodude,2010-06-28T03:48Z,"Worked great! Open the loader and install using default drivers. The loader will close and hang for just a second, then prompt you to restart your computer. When you do and it's up again, choose to activate your windows license. This will take you to a microsoft webpage where it will read the certificate you have installed and verify it's authenticity. That's it!"
,ShareMore,2010-07-21T04:24Z,"I tried EVERY patch on TPB.

This is the only one that worked for me :)

Thank you"
,chipsngravy,2010-07-25T01:06Z,"Worked perfectly. Just run the programme then after the restart and login go to the microsoft website and run the validate genuine microsoft software check. It will take several minutes but mine came back as validation successful! Sir and/or madam, you are a genius!! Many thanks  :o)"

,s2009,2011-01-03T03:05Z,"I really love this Windows 7 Loader. But regarding the recent Loader, you can read this post. http://www.techlikes.com/2010/04/download-windows-7-loader-genuine-hack.html"
,LaDulceVida,2011-01-20T01:12Z,"Maybe I did something wrong???

If someone could give step-by-step instructions...
I opened the .exe file... set it to MEDION, MEDION, HP and it ran... then it asked to restart. So I did.
and still have a black desktop with a sign that says:

Windows 7

This copy of Windows is not genuine

,Junto1,2011-03-01T03:09Z,"IM getting this Artemis!72EE2E9C9B43 by Macafee. But since it is a hack tool, im not surprised that it's blocked by Macaffee, just like Cain.

This piece of software is safe though."
