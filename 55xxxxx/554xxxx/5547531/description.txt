This compilation is a first attempt for unity and common action in the music scene. It is a self-financed release, independent from for-profit rationales which began as an answer to the dead end of modern music industry.

In this system, our thirst for music expression turns into commodity and our needs are shadowed by the need for profit. Additionally, the monopoly of clubs and live venues leads to the devaluation of the bands but also the aversion of the audience to the music scene. This way, the musicians are pushed into competitive rationales, and see individualism as the only way through vain approaches that don't have much to offer to music.

Towards these we propose the collective way and solidarity. We believe that the independence from the profit-making aims of companies and clubs and the constitution of a united music movement should be our further goals. Some essential actions in this direction are the organization of live concerts, the release of D.I.Y. compilations, the creation of printed and web spaces etc.

MANIFESTO isn't restricted to the CD that you hold in hand, neither concerns solely the bands that comprise the compilation. So we address an open call to those who share our worries and want to participate actively in this attempt.
