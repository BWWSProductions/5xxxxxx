               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          Hailing from the state of Florida, singer-songwriter Tom Petty has come to epitomize 
          a new rootsy style of California rock'n'roll. Rhythmically, the music harkens back to
          the basic crunch of the Rolling Stones and the dancing pop of the Beatles, while     
          Petty's gravelly vocals and sing-song narrative style suggest roots in the folk-blues
          Americana of Bob Dylan. This new Greatest Hits collection replaces the classic hit of
          "Something in the Air" with "Stop Dragging My Heart Around" featuring Stevie Nicks.  
                                                                                               
          I'm glad to see this album remastered. If you own the 1993 version and you decide to 
          buy this because you had heard that the sound was going to be great, right you are!  
          There is a huge difference in terms of sound here.                                   
                                                                                               
          And, of course, this collection has all the Tom Petty songs the casual fan will      
          probably ever need. 1970s hits like 'Refugee,' 'American Girl,' 'Breakdown,' 'I Need 
          To Know' and 'Don't Do Me Like That' are here, as are his '80s hits like 'Free       
          Fallin,' 'Don't Come Around Here No More' and 'Runnin' Down A Dream.'                
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            
                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
