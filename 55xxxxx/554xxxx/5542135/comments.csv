,lilchick,2010-05-11T21:32Z,"Aaaah need this, but will there ever be a PAL??

my chip doesnt allow ntsc games...."
,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-05-11T22:03Z,"@lilchick this can be forced to play in PAL using a region free app in the homebrew channel or try a region free loader on disk im sure there is one you can burn to disk on here
try this

,aagaliarept,2010-05-11T22:07Z,"@lilchick

You can use a region remover on the iso. I suggest Wiu."
,xx21playerxx,2010-05-12T02:22Z,"Hey guys!!
Just force video to your region and use the link I posted earlier to download Ocarina codes for PAL and NTSC-J.
Its a sure go.
Good luck and thanks for seeding."
,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-05-12T08:01Z,@xx21playerxx which 2 are the custom tracks and how you get baby wario and baby waluigi 
,xx21playerxx,2010-05-12T14:04Z,"@rhys_dvduk2001:

Use the Ocarina codes to unlock everything. Also included are the FAQs and details you are looking for.
Let it be a surprise....."
,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-05-13T18:35Z,"@xx21playerxx 
i have used the codes and the faq in the download but still no baby wario or baby waluigi"
,steviekeyz,2010-05-14T04:05Z,"I really hate to be negative because I love customs, but this custom is not good at all IMO. I wont get into details as it would take up more than this page.

thx for it anyway.

one last note that was cool though is if you have your original mario kart disc with the saved data on your wii, this custom will read it."
,xx21playerxx,2010-05-14T04:41Z,"@rhys_dvduk

You didn't take good care of your babies thats why you lost them. Have you raced with Daisy on a Dolphin Dasher yet? If you want to see her in nude then do so."
,lilchick,2010-05-15T00:44Z,"i dont want to do a lot of shitnitz with my wii, got a wiikey2 with 1.3 and can only play pure pal-copies so.....
