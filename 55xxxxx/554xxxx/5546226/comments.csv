,enonumus,2012-02-20T12:39Z,"Those screen shots are all stretched horizontally.  They look like 4:3 content stretched to a 1.875 AR.  The only copy I've found of this so far was also 4:3, so if anybody has downloaded this, please confirm if it's truly 1.875, or if it's actually 4:3 with an incorrect AR set to 1.875."
,enonumus,2012-02-21T00:16Z,"Well based on the screen shots I was afraid the aspect ratios specs were totally wrong and they were.  This is a FULL SCREEN 4:3 movie, NOT a widescreen copy.  Taking a 4:3 movie and stretching it to a widescreen aspect ratio doesn't make it a widescreen movie...  Setting aside the incorrect AR, the A/V quality is pretty decent and it's perfectly watchable once you correct the AR using MKV Merge, Yamb, or on the fly if you're watching with the VLC media player.
