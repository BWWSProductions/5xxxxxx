,basha04,2010-05-27T16:13Z,pardon me monsher just want to inform you that KIS 9.0.0.736 CF2 has found a trojan and automatically deleted the infected executable file. do you have an idea about this? nice upload though.
,AcidGlow,2010-07-12T15:04Z,"Would advise caution with this one. Installation file has been tampered with (thus the digital signature of the company is not present). Also further investigation revealed that the \""main\"" installation file is a dropper for a file named tbmain.exe (Trojan downloader agent). Once the tbmain.exe is dropped into the temp folder (and executed) it will proceed to execute the real installation file (packaged inside the trojan itself) for the app. Again trust me when I say. It\'s not a false positive for the crack. The crack/patch itself is clean the infected file in this package is the installation file. Only weird thing that a trusted user would upload this, unless s/he did not realise it."
,AcidGlow,2010-07-12T15:49Z,"Sorry for double post but to update on the infection. Further investigation reveals that the tbmain.exe file is a dropper for the UAC Rootkit. You may be able to check existence of the rootkit by going into your system (or system32) folder and checking for existence of UAC[random characters].dll (amongst .log and .dat files with same name). Also sometimes visible will be UAC[random characters].sys inside the system/drivers folder. At times trojan will change locations (too many to list) however you may notice that your browser will redirect to windowsclick.com website randomly while using search engines or security websites (symantec etc.) Aditionally security programs such as firewalls and antivirus software may fail to execute upon restart of the machine. 1 Good deed for the day done, singing off. :P"
