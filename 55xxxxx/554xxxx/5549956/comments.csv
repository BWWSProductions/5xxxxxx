,ShiftyEyedGoat,2011-09-18T21:45Z,"Kudos for trying to seed such a large torrent, but the video quality is quite lower than hoped. Not sure if you used a generic encode setting or a one-click program but yeah, after looking at two eps I went to other torrents."
,visum,2011-12-29T23:20Z,"So all of these episodes have been converted to a 4:3 aspect ratio - instead of the native 16:9 for seasons two through five?  And if so, I'm wondering why?"
