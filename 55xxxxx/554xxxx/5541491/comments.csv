,micumed,2010-05-07T18:32Z,"I've got this file from a friend, and that's how it was named... Malestrom.... "
,annabelle31,2010-05-07T19:19Z,"Ok, I asked because Malestrom is a regular poster here.

See: http://thepiratebay.org/user/malestrom_hh

So it was a bit weird..."

As such, other members like myself will search by the members name as a keyword to quickly locate their torrents.  Adding their ""name"" in the filename makes it a breeze to locate any new torrents, etc."
