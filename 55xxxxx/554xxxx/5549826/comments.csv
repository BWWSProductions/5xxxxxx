TvTeam ftw"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-10T14:48Z,"LOL, try with bricks bro, right in the screen. "
,Pothead808,2010-05-10T17:26Z,"Thanks 20, will you be upping a quark of this?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-10T17:35Z,"Sorry pothead, I cannot. ""Treme"" as [quark] goes after ""Pacific.360p"". Or before. I haven't decided yet. It is probably the last Breaking Bad in any form or shape. Minimal interest combined with idiots is one hell of the mixture."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-10T18:07Z,"Oh, I forgot - I am encoder AND uploader. And my 720p are without any doubt - BETTER then official ones, by the third of the size.
TVteam is just - uploader. Someone who made torrents (roughly 3 seconds) for encodings of other people.
 Ftw that."
,jjabrams,2010-05-10T18:12Z,Dont listen to them 20/40 - there will always be haters. The quality on this is so high that I cant play it on my netbook lol.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-10T18:48Z,"jj, have you tried my recommendation (what I use) for playback? Before that I was unable to  play even 720p, not to mention 1080p... Now, I can play both, VLC and other players are too ""heavy"" for proper playback of HighRes encodings.
It's in the probably in 770 torrent-descriptions right here and last time I spoke about was two days ago (on Gravity E3 720p) when such problems as yours have been raised."
,jjabrams,2010-05-10T19:07Z,"yeah 20/40 the problem is with my netbook i think, if I use vlc - 1st second plays - then dead.

Using coreavc + wmp = plays but has some sync issues.

I think its my netbook - z530 +gma500+ win7 = driver problems.

this series deserves to be put on large screen anyways :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-10T19:14Z,"Yeah, Atom is more concerned about saving the power than giving. Sorry. I was mildly criticized before and decided to release B.Bad only as 720p."
,lilars26,2010-05-10T22:59Z,"ftw-does this mean f the world?
or something else(still learning)"
,jjabrams,2010-05-11T00:24Z,"ftw= ""for the win""  i think
but yeah as 20/40 said - tvteam is only the uploader - they have nothing to do with the quality/size.

I have no idea why more people dont do 720p@350mb - the quality is definitely noticeable from regular 350mb rips.

Would love if you did the upcoming season of mad men in this format 20/40 - thanks "
,lilars26,2010-05-11T01:27Z,Thank you jj.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-11T10:06Z,"""ftw"" in biker gangs it meant Fuck the World, 

In online usage it mainly means For the Win."
,yinzer,2010-05-12T13:48Z,"TY 2040, do you know why this version will not work on Iphone?"
