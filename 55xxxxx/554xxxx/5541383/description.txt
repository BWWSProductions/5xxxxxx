The sustained dry wit of the dialogue and the wonderful interplay between the three main characters - 

Jim Hacker, Sir Humphrey and Bernard Wooley - made Jonathan Lynn and Antony Jay's satirical comedy 

compulsive viewing. 

The strength of the writing makes these audios a joy to listen to. 
These sixteen episodes of "Yes Minister" were specially adapted and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 

1983 and 1984




Cast:
Paul Eddington as James Hacker

A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.
I have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice
I was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.

There is little point in downloading a "Torrent" and then recreating a "Torrent" using the same files.

The fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make 

another exactly the same version,

All you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the "same" files and make both have less seeders.
