Scorpions - The Videos (2010)

This is NOT an official commercial release, only something put together by fans. 
The release has all the music videos from "20th century masters" and "a savage 
crazy world", plus some more stuff thrown in and the quality is just as good.  
So, it's certainly much better and worth the download.
