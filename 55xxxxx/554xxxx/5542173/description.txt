Finally, the season is over and all the episodes have been ripped in 720p -- which is good, because I love using those high-quality rips as sources for my iPod / Portable conversions. Now, last year, Cartoon Network continually aired the season in 1.78 aspect ratio, but SkyHD managed to air some of the episodes in 2.35 AR (the show's TRUE aspect ratio). But this year, all the rips were from Cartoon Network, and all were ripped in 1.78 AR. However, Cartoon Network did accidentally air episode 17 in 2.35, but like I said, the ripping team still ripped it in 1.78, so it has black bars at the top and bottom.

Hopefully, one day LucasFilms will start supporting Blu-Ray and we'll get the Saga, the Indiana Jones films, and all this Clone Wars goodness on Blu-Ray in it's real aspect ratio. Until then, we've just got to make do with what they give us.

Once again, I've converted these episodes and squished more info into the container than it's dimensions normally allow, which allows for a high-resolution and the high bitrate isn't wasted. I think you'll agree from the screen shots, these look amazing. And all of the episodes sound amazing too, except one!

I hate to have to upload a flawed episode in with the rest, but episode 4 has a minute or two where the broadcast switched back and forth between mono and stereo. You can still hear the entire episode, there is no buzzing or interference, but the audio switches sides repeatedly over the course of a minute, so it sounds strange for a while. Again, this was in the Cartoon Network broadcast, and all the rips I found had the same problem, so I couldn't fix the issue as it's in the source.

I just finished watching the season the other day, and I thought it was even better than last year. Ahsoka Tano fans will love the season because she gets quite a bit of screen time, but Ahsoka Tano haters will also like the season because there is a whole sequence of episodes (Mandalore Plot episodes) where Ahsoka is nowhere to be seen. Plus, Aurra Sing, Boba Fett, and Bossk all make appearances.

For those who remember season one's "Duel of the Droids", the episode where R2-D2 is a main character, this season once again has a similar episode, "R2 Come Home" in which Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker are trapped inside a downed and burning Republic Destroyer and R2 must fend off the bounty hunters trying to kill them. Overall, the season is spectacular, and if you haven't seen it -- you really SHOULD! I decided to be fair and take a single screen shot from every single episode, and not take all of them from my favorites. I figured you'd get sick of screen shots of the Mandalorian with the black lightsaber (known as the Darksaber) and R2-D2 at his finest :P


Enjoy, and May the Force Be With You!
