,ChristianNiegemann,2010-05-08T16:57Z,Were is E23 or is that season 3?
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-08T18:49Z,"There is NO episode 23.

Anyone who tells you there is ... is lying.  Season One had 22 episodes.  Season Two has 22 episodes.

http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-19187/episode_list/2
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458290/episodes#season-2

Every single major site with episode listings (including the OFFICIAL SITE) lists only 22 episodes.  The final episode of the season (e22) aired on April 30th.  


So ... *where* is episode 23?  In the scrotum of a unicorn being ridden by a nice man-loving lesbian on top of Mount Olympus ... or, in other words ... episode 23 is a figment of your imagination."
,ChristianNiegemann,2010-05-08T19:54Z,just guessing that there where a 23rd E because my 22and E dident say anything about a new season so i just guessed that there where a 23rd E (sry for bad english)
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-08T21:04Z,"The only difference between E22 and every other episode is that all the other episodes (when aired) ended with a preview of the next episode.

E22 just 'ended'.


Last year, I do believe they promoted S01E22 as the ""Season Finale"", but I don't think they did that this year -- I don't know why.


As far as I know, there hasn't been any confirmation that there will be a third season, but ... considering the second season had higher ratings than the first, I'll continue to assume otherwise until told so ... plus, the Star Wars:  The Clone Wars merchandise is what is selling primarily now ... and we all know George Lucas is all about the 'merchandising' ...

I can't wait to get my hands on a ""Star Wars:  The Clone Wars -- Flamethrower"" ... heh-heh!"

thanks for uploading"
,Dourig,2010-05-30T19:50Z,"VixenofVenus:

Lucas has said that there will be a possible five seasons and maybe a total of 100 episodes.

from searching around I would say season 3 will debut about the same time the other seasons did in 2011."
