,Bundi001,2011-01-09T21:55Z,"Hi, I tried to install this but it doesn't work at all. Every time it I try, it says ""Fatal Error"" and then aborts installation. It won't even let me install a Trial version. It says: ""Error 2908: Could Not Register Component"" and has a bunch of numbers and letters after it. Please HELP! I tried using both PowerISO and D-Tools and neither of them work. I want only the 64-bit version."
