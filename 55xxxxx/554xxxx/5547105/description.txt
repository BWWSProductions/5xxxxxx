The FIRST music video (originally only available on audio cassette and VHS video!)
I had to merge numerous files (of different dimensions)so re-authored them all to the same size. Once joined to a single avi file of 1.07Gb and 1h 31m 01s - 2 points to make, 1- there's a 19sec watermark warning at the start, and 2- the "side 2" logo (2 seconds) has been left in to keep audio in perfect synch.
For a 26yr old concert this is a MUST for dire straits fans - i bet at this, their 1st ever music vid, nobody expected them to go on to sell 120million albums!
Please seed and please ENJOY!
