,D07792,2010-05-09T18:41Z,Do you have plans to encode it in [quark] as well?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-09T18:48Z,"Yes, but wont be up today. I have 1018 ""bytetrashers"", ""gremlins"" and other payed shills and scumbags on this torrent alone and - no one (other than few people in this swarm) seems to know how to spot them and how to block them...
I spoke about - I wrote about - but..."
,D07792,2010-05-09T19:03Z,Thanks. I can wait. 
,springw,2010-05-09T19:12Z,Does this one go in and out of focus 
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-09T19:19Z,"@springw: Sure, absolutely, in - and out. Do not download, wait for BluRay."
,D07792,2010-05-09T19:41Z,@springw: Sample is included. Size is just 12 Mb. Check it for yourself. 
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-09T20:21Z,"Sample have two ""parts"", deliberately chosen and ""glued"" together: first is the beginning of the movie, when issues like ""pixelization"" (when the ""cube-logo"" folds-out) and focusing (when such ""in and out"" on sand-dunes is clearly visible) have been raised;and then the second part - where color balance and sound have been shown.
It is just better than plain and ugly looking CAM we had so far. Whole purpose of any TS (as I have parroting al'alon') is - improved watchablilty. Nothing more.
One should remember - cam and ts ""business"" is not for faint-hearted. Anyone ""who needs more"" should wait for DVD or BluRay disk to be released.

Honesty costs a thing. And to remember - I sell nothing. Take it or leave it. I wont profit anyway."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-09T21:13Z,"I really like this line bro.. ""I sell nothing. Take it or leave it. I wont profit anyway."""
[V],pluto999,2010-05-09T21:17Z,@2040 : could you repeat once more how to block them?
[V],pluto999,2010-05-09T21:17Z,thank you..
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-09T21:46Z,"@pluto: I'm not feeling very good and I will hit the bed. So, I'll be short and not of big help, OK?

The main thing is to spot them, you must run uTorrent because that is only program which shows the names (not just IPs). They usually goes by same host-name. LOT of same names means that swarm is flooded and you should block them one-by-one or their ranges transcribing their IP addresses from Peers window (Resolve names un-marked) in Blocked Addresses list in your firewall (anyone who asked me went COMODO fw).
Further, you must have running PeerBlock whenever you're in P2P. He would take care of 106 millions of permanent shills.
That's all right now. Maybe some of the regulars could continue."

[V],pluto999,2010-05-09T22:05Z,THank you..
,lilars26,2010-05-09T22:25Z,"Thank you 20/40.
