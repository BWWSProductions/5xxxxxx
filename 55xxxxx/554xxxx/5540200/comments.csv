,snivlle,2010-05-07T22:31Z,"I seeded well over 300% on this and everyone who downloaded just hit & run. Now that's something I would expect from the world, but not from christians. What part of this album being ""RARE"" do people not grasp?

Here's a reminder - It's more blessed to give than receive. When you d/l, stay on the thing, keep the torrent open and bless others.

Luv in Christ,

One thank you.

It must have been all unsaved downloaders. Christians wouldn't hit n' run . . . nor would they not be bothered to jot a note of appreciation."
