RE: Geoff Moore: The Distance (1987)

Greetings in the lovely name of Jesus:

Brothers n' sisters, here's another rare gem! This CD has long
since been OOP (Out of print).

Geoff Moore, "The Distance" (Power Discs PWD01088, 1987).
Produced by Billy Smiley.

This is easily one of the rarest CDs in Christian music!
Released right at the dawn of the compact disc era, before many
people had even purchased a CD player. Not many CDs of this title
were manufactured and sold before it went out of print. The CD of
this title shows up on eBay only once in a blue moon!

This is widely regarded as one of Geoff Moore's best rock albums,
and it is most notable for including a duet with Larry Norman on
Norman's classic song "Why Should The Devil Have All The Good Music."
Moore also includes a driving cover of Randy Matthews' song "Didn't He."

(Please note that Geoff Moore & The Distance later re-recorded this
song for his album "Evolution"--that later version does not feature
Larry Norman.)


Minor enhancements have been applied to the recording to bring
the musical dynamic range up to more modern standards. Volume
levels were carefully increased through standard wav normalizing
and subsequent maximizing with the incredible Aradaz Maximizer 5
(v1.5) VST plug-in.

Simply burn this NERO CD Image file with NERO or a NERO compatible
CD burning program.


God Bless U,
Luv in Christ,
Bro. Charles (aka "snivlle")
