This is an updated collection of all my themes so far. All my themes are made with HD size  1920x1080  and SD size  640x480 . The other torrents seem to keep going dead every time I shut down my computer due to a lack of seeders. I'm hoping this might help. Plus now it's a one stop shop. I have the whole folder here but you will only need the "P3T" file which will be labeled with the theme name to put on your PS3.On a flash drive create a folder labeled PS3 and in that folder another folder labeled THEME. Put the P3T file in the second folder. With the flash drive in the PS3 go to settings - theme settings - theme - install then select the file from your flash drive. SEED and enjoy. Any suggestions please pm me. No promises but I will do my best.  Also please help with SEEDING. Thanks.
