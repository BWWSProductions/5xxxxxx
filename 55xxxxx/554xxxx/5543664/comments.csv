You fucks that are whinning about slow seeds have your up speed to nill and complain on here that it's slow. This downloaded for me in 6 hours using max upload and max download in my torrent program (Utorrent)

,spartan22,2010-05-11T04:41Z,"sorry for the noob question but i have to folders, dvd1 and dvd 2. I used the installer on the dvd 1 folder and its asking for dvd 2?? how do i make it go past that? "
,spartan22,2010-05-11T05:36Z,"ComputerArt- Thanks for youre help! i wasnt sure what you meant but i unmounted both iso files, then i put the ""payloads"" from DVD 2 in the DVD1 ""payloads"" not merging, but adding the new files to the same named folders, and it worked!! "
,2morowMan,2010-05-11T10:39Z,"you the man!!
Thanks. This is what i've been waiting for.

DVD2 Trouble?
i extracted DVD1 and DVD2. Then i moved 'payloads' from 2 into 1 (overwrite identical files/folders). Then run setup. And it automatically mmoves to disk2 when needed.

PS. Apple Sucks"
,2morowMan,2010-05-12T11:13Z,"@computerart
Thanks for the detailed notes re mounting.
I'm sure it helps lots...

I prefer to have a software library where i only have to run 'setup'. no faffin' about with mounting required.

To each his own - and noobs now have the choice. Hallowed Be TPB. :)"

,checkitin,2010-05-13T15:00Z,"tryd several times to intall the application  properly
 i burned the lot on 2 (large )dvd's  it only installs a number of progamms that i dont use 
suchas adobe extendscript toolkit ,etc
while photoshop ,illustrator ,premiere, aftereffects
and so on does nt get installed 
would it have something to do that i still adobe cs4 on my machine ,i already have taken  that in to acount an installed the new version on a different drive ,so not on c
does someon has the same problem .
and/or a tip how  to get this working "
,spartan22,2010-05-13T21:32Z,"checkitin- i would just uninstall cs4 and install cs5 for a fresh install. and for the dvds, you should just unmount them in youre desktop and install cs5 from there. when youre installing it you can choose what programs you want so you dont have to install all of them if you dont want to."
,checkitin,2010-05-14T02:04Z,"spartan22
thanks for yor reply ,it worked (although)I uninstalled cs4
and got all the progams that containd in cs5 installed that i needed
I used the disable activation key ,but is seems that this is not working 
the problem is when i open a application the activation panel pops up and tels me to provide another serial number for this product ,i checked the %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file if the 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com was added .
and it is ...
hope there is a way to overcome this 
help is appreciated

When I did manage to get the keygen extracted, it says windows cannot find the path or I may not have app. permissions.  I tried opening as admin...no avail.

This works for W7 right?

,LuxZg,2010-06-03T09:07Z,"No ""32bit package"" as this is DVD3, and these are actually just old CS4 apps.. if you want them go download CS4 from other torrents.
No Acrobat either, that would be DVD4, and again it's because Acrobat is ""old"" version and you can get it from other torrents. Adobe still hasn't updated Acrobat, so it's wait and see..
This is English only, and has English/International and English/US options on install.
Premiere works with all codecs now, while in trial (+key) I had no sound on some video clips.
For mounting these ISO files you can also use Daemon tools Lite which is a free app: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
Yes, Color Finesse is included, it says so in readme, please read..

I think this covers most of the un-answered questions :)"
,LuxZg,2010-06-03T09:08Z,"Btw, I haven't downloaded this exact torrent, but I've got that other torrent in utorrent on 100%, and I've just started this one, copied files from other torrent, forced re-check and it all works.
