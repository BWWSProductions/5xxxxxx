Dr. Andrew Burt ( www.aburt.com ), professional science fiction writer and former Vice President of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Inc., has published dozens of short stories and one novel. You can find more of his fiction at http://aburt.com/fiction . He also herds Critters ( www.critters.org ), a cozy 5,000 member writers' workshop specializing in science fiction, fantasy, and horror, and home to other writers' resources, such as the Black Holes response time tracker and other fun tools for writers and readers. Outside of science fiction, he's been a computer science professor (research in networking, security, privacy, and free-speech/social issues), founder of Nyx.net, the world's first free Internet service, purveyor of the NewNewForum.com - The Innovation Forum, and a technology consultant/author/speaker. He's currently CEO of TechSoft, and President of GreenAroundYou.org. For a hobby, he constructs solutions to all the world's problems. Fortunately -- nobody listens. He lives in the Rockies with his wife and their two parrots.
