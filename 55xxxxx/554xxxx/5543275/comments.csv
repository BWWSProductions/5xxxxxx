I thought this would be a movie for the kids. Well that's not the case. This is an awesome movie!!!! Great action, some humor and very original.

Can't thank you enough for this upload, especially because it's 700 mb and the quality is no different from the larger torrents.

Tanks!!"

,haakon.t,2010-05-10T19:20Z,"@Skeelol, are you serious? Every movie theater show movies in 2.35:1, those that fill out your tv is either cut off on both sides, or have been released straight to dvd. You could always cut it off on the sides yourself, or use the ""zoom in"" function in your media player, but I don't see why you should."
