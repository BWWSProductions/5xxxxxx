and this should work on battlenet if i have my own cd key right?
i'll check back, so please answer.
thanks :)"
,emak212,2010-05-12T05:37Z,"Much appreciated... you are a master.  Should I be able to run battle.net with this?  It says my CD key is invalid.  I do have another CD key I can use, but do you have any ideas how I could change the key you provided?  Thanks again."
,howie1384,2010-05-12T05:39Z,How long does the rebuilding usually take?
,emak212,2010-05-12T05:50Z,@howie1384: rebuilding took me no longer than 10 minutes.  then it will create shortcuts on your desktop and you're good to go. let me know if you have any trouble with battle.net as it tells me either my CD key is invalid or I am trying to connect to an invalid server
,howie1384,2010-05-12T06:13Z,"When I run the SETUP.bat file it just opens a window with music and a crazy dancer, i let it go for like an hour and nothing.  Am I doing something wrong?  I followed the instructions."
,ice-cold-flames,2010-05-13T01:24Z,ditto howie1384
,emak212,2010-05-13T01:24Z,"Did you disable UAC first?  The same thing happened to me until I disabled UAC (and restarted).  Then, the blue prompt screen will ask you to press enter to continue and everything is golden after that."
,howie1384,2010-05-13T06:12Z,"My UAC was off, and I even restarted again just to make sure.  Same thing, just the dumb dancer and music."
[V],blaze69,2010-05-13T15:39Z,"jeeeeez,,, when The Dancer appears.. just press (Esc) wow... lmao"
,howie1384,2010-05-13T17:03Z,"well maybe I was just a retard, but I hit Esc and it worked perfectly.  Thanks for the great download blaze-69 and the help too."

[V],blaze69,2010-06-04T23:48Z,"@ moonbyt3

That File Is Not A Trojan...
Simply A False Positive

Simple Maths::::

No Need To Re-Download The Torrent.
Turn Of Ur Av Software. Extract The File. Go To The Extracted Folder And Delete The blaze69.exe file , Turn On Ur Antivirus Software.. Go ahead and Continue Installation.


That blaze69.exe file Is an Intro That a Friend Created For Me From Over At TPTB Website.... It's Probally Getting Flagged a A Virus Due To The Fact That's a Packed .exe file.. No Need To Worry ,,

For Everyone Else. Just Extract and Go To Folder And Delete The ""blaze69.exe"" File

Enjoy !!!!!!"
