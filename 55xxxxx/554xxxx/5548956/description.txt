"Okinawa"

After battling across the island of Okinawa for 
over a month, Sledge and the rest of the 1st 
Marine Division are ordered to relieve an Army 
division that has been in combat against the 
most strongly defended Japanese position on the 
island. The primordial conditions and the moral 
dilemma posed by the presence of civilians put 
tremendous strain on the physical and 
psychological endurance of Sledge and the other 
Marines.

Enjoy :)
