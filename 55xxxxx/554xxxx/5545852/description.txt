Storyline:

Little Red Riding Hood: A classic story, but there's more to every tale than meets the eye. Before you judge a book by its cover, you've got to flip through the pages.
For this story, we begin at the end. Furry and feathered cops from the animal world investigate a domestic disturbance at Granny's cottage,
involving a girl, a wolf, and an axe.
The charges are many: breaking and entering, disturbing the peace, intent to eat, and wielding an axe without a license.
Not to mention, this case might be tied to the elusive "Goody Bandit" who has been stealing the recipes of goody shops everywhere.
