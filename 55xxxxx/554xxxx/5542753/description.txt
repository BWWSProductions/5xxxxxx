Robert Neville is a scientist who was unable to stop the spread
of the terrible virus that was incurable and man-made. Immune, 
Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City
and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out 
daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be 
out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague
-- The Infected -- lurk in the shadows... watching Neville's 
every move... waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. 
Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one 
remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus 
using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered... and quickly 
running out of time.
