I assume it's referring to the file size? Doesn't say much. There are many good rippers out there that can get great quality into small file sizes, and have seen some shit quality in huge file sizes... I will post A/V when it's finished D/L I guess."

my guess is '350 quality' means 350Mb quality :) "
