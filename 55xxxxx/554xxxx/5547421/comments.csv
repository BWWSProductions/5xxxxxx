,pastevens,2010-05-10T04:36Z,"Okay, never mind. I don't know how that happened and I've never seen it before but when the pics were half finished some of them showed Katrin B. and now they're all Betty ! 0_o Never saw that happen before!"

,niggyniggnigg,2010-05-11T03:38Z,"dude, i have totally seen that...before the pictures are totally complete it actually shows some other people in the torrents pic previews...very bizarre.

i never understood that either...where the hell is it even pulling that image from!?"
,pastevens,2010-05-11T21:49Z,"As far as I know it should be impossible; a torrent file is like a hash file and it can't include data that wasn't there when it hashed the folder.

Maybe it's a Windows glitch and our pc's have pulled shit up from 'recent documents' or deleted files; something like that to fill the command when it's commanded to display thumbnail views in the incomplete folder.
Both of the chics it was showing me besides Betty were sets I already had and moved/deleted. "
