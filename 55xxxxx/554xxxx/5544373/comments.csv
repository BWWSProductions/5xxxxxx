,Paolo_Legnetti,2010-05-10T13:29Z,Is this as good as the other one?
[T],Vazzt,2010-05-10T16:08Z,"Yes, It's the original cubase 5 with update and crack from Air. Works really good!"
,cuervo7,2010-05-11T15:05Z,has it the same interface with cubase sx?
,guerraslb,2010-05-11T23:49Z,"I need cubase for MAC, pleeeeeease."
[T],Vazzt,2010-05-14T16:27Z,"Same interface at cubase 3?! what do you mean? 

Buy it if you want it for mac or get windows."
,reckem63,2010-05-17T07:30Z,"Sorry, I know I seem like a dumbass, but what did I do wrong?  Everything went fine until it attempted to install the emulator.  I get an error - ""cannot import ""Waterlib.dll""  

Cubase won't run, its asking for ""Synsoacc.dll""

Where do I go from here?"
,zip2009,2010-05-19T23:45Z,"I had it running fine on Win 7 64bit in x86 mode...but had to re-image my drive and I get the ""cannot import ""Waterlib.dll"" message ever since...Boo Whoo... ¦¬( any ideas???

Thanks for the up, it was so easy to install the first time around."
[T],Vazzt,2010-05-20T15:14Z,"Haven't hear about that problem, I've installed this release on over 5 different computers, all working.

It might be that you have a old crack for cubase in you system folder.

try the latest crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5575270/

Try to uninstall all cubase,cracks,emulators and all that shit. try searching you C: drive for Synsoacc and delete all those files.

Other then that, a total format  on your C: drive will solve it."
,ChukNorris,2010-05-25T04:40Z,How to set the folder to which you need to install? I do not find that
[T],Vazzt,2010-05-25T14:03Z,Can't you find the option for where you wana install cubase to? etc the E: drive? or?? what exactly do you mean?
,ChukNorris,2010-05-25T14:38Z,"Explain what to do with this folder. It is necessary to make an image? If I install directly from the folder I receive an error that you need to select the installation folder, but I can not find where to choose"
[T],Vazzt,2010-05-25T19:06Z,"1.Unrar

2.Mount hte .iso file

3. follow the cmd pop up window, if there is no pop up window, open the monted dvd drive and open air's setup file."
,AlwaysQuality,2010-05-28T11:38Z,I'll grab this one! Thanks
,cuervo7,2010-05-30T15:43Z,i mean if it has the same options with sx version
,sakeynii,2010-06-02T10:57Z,"Wow this works Great for me, but there are no presets for the New features and Halion one presets are only and Yamaha presets is there way to get all the presets appear in the presets brows window ??"
,sakeynii,2010-06-02T10:58Z,"Wow this works Great for me, but there are no presets for the New features and Halion one presets are only some SR and Yamaha presets is there a way to get all the presets appear in the presets browser window ??"

,JRod527,2010-06-02T16:18Z,"Getting the ""cannot import Waterlib.dll"" message. Also tried the newest dongle emulator patch without success.

I'm running Win7 64. I know that the program ""will  perfectly work as a 32bit application on a 64bit OS like Windows7,"" but does that mean I need to install it in 32-bit mode? Not sure how to do that. Since I'm not the only one with this problem, I'll post back if I figure it out."
,bzath218,2010-06-11T18:43Z,"""cannot import Waterlib.dll"" 
I get this message with both the fix and update.????anyone know whats going on?"
,bzath218,2010-06-12T02:33Z,"I uninstalled my anti-virus, then followed the instructions. Waterlib.dll error message is because your anti-virus puts it in quarantine. Restore it and remove antivirus,then reinstall anti virus after. I have had no problems. "
,tizzleh,2010-06-13T05:21Z,I am installing this on a VM. The dongle passes security. When CSX5 starts it crashes with no code while loading help files. I have attached  to debugger and found the address that can't be read. Does anyone else get this problem? Any ideas? I will try and debug the assembly. I just wanted to see if anyone had an easier solution.
,tizzleh,2010-06-13T07:22Z,Team AiR... just wanted to say props. On more than one level. You guys have done work that is nothing short of amazing. The time and effort put into this... It must have been very challenging. I don't know where else to post that one of your team may read.
,drews_subin,2010-06-16T23:10Z,Works great!  Thank you uploader.
,dubwise101,2010-06-18T17:20Z,I'm running Vista (32 bit). Everything installs + loads fine but there is NO SOUND. Any ideas? Thanks in advance...
,ricem84,2010-06-19T19:53Z,"I installed steinberg.cubase.v5.1.AiR, which I can no longer find on here for some reason, but I think it was similar to this one.  Everything installs, but when I try to start it it stops at SSE Optimized Audio DSP Library.  I've tried uninstalling Quicktime and deleting the preferences folder to no avail.  Any ideas?  "
,shawnbell88,2010-06-20T04:34Z,this works perfectly thank you team AIR!!
,bigivan75,2010-06-28T21:59Z,"the download was fast and easy, unrared and mounted in no time, as i got to the end a message poped up ""cannot import ""Waterlib.dll""...i think a few people had that problem, im assuming thats the reason why it crashes as soon as i try to open cubase...if someone knows how to fix this would be greatly apreciated and thanks to team AiR for the upload"
,bigivan75,2010-06-29T06:22Z,"Once again thanks for the upload, finally got it to work. I suggest to disconnect from the internet, remove the antivirus, and then follow the three steps. Awesome upload. Thanks"
,soulsurfer69,2010-07-07T16:56Z,"not happy that i downloaded this, asked for help with a problem that half the people on here have, somehow my comment for help has disapeared and now I have a tracking cookie on my pc... fuckyou very much for waisting my time and dl !"
,Malus_demonblood,2010-07-10T08:38Z,"the .dll problem is resolved by uninstalling your antivirus. I personally had avg and when i uninstalled everything in cubase worked fine. Just closing off the antivirus by the way wasn\'t enough uninstalling only solved the problem. Stop complaining people this is an excellent release all you have to do is a simple uninstall. If i could also make a request by the way, since there is a lack of worthy guitar vsti out there, if someone could crack and upload either virtual guitarist 2 from steinberg or the full prominy lpc, it would be really great. thnx! :)"
,metalnando,2010-08-10T06:15Z,"Thanks to Team AIR on this,  the install was almost perfect, the only thing is it doesnt read my sound card, but i will be purchasng an interface to work with it! "

Do someone have any tips how I could install this new update 5:5 for cubase"

,contralog,2012-02-16T13:32Z,"Sweet Air!

Thanks for your release. I used the your original 5.1 version dvd crack and installed. It workes fine but some functions in cubase are locked. Things like folding tracks are locked (grey) in the program. Have I done something wrong? Is there something I can do?"
