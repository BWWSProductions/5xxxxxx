[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-05-08T06:36Z,"OK, what's the gist of this film? There are hundreds of anti-NWO movies. What males this one so ""mind blowing?"""
,Resist-NWO,2010-05-08T06:47Z,"It covers everything from NWO, Illuminati, Bohemian Grove, Skull & Bones, the Banker takeover of our nations, 9/11 cover-up, etc.  Then it covers a section on how it all ties in with End Times prophecies of the Bible.

I've seen all the documentaries out there just about and this one just stands out to me more than most of them.  Even though most of them are also very very good.

For me, this is the one that I make copies of and hand them out to people.  Although the brand new one by Jason Bermas ""Invisible Empire"" is also a favorite of mine for that now."
,Resist-NWO,2010-05-08T07:02Z,"Since the size and scope of this massive conspiracy is difficult for most that are new to it to comprehend, this film is perfect for them.  

I guess it is very ""NWO-newbie"" friendly."
,paramount71,2010-05-09T15:48Z,"This should be send on tv. On every channel, every day and night. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!!!!"
,Papaoso42,2010-06-06T18:22Z,"Saw an interesting movie called ""Fall of the republic"" It was pretty upsetting. Interested in how this one is. I'll report back. I discovered after years of hearing the conspiracy theory stuff that we should not dismiss it so quickly anymore."
,SurrealAndReality,2010-06-17T21:51Z,What makes this one so different is that most of the things shown can be proven by real facts and the images you are shown are real. Even i had to make an account here to comment because it really opens your mind. Not telling you that you should believe this but its hard when they can back their story up. Good video and after watching this all i can say is the new world order can suck it.
,Resist-NWO,2010-08-01T20:13Z,"It is basically a very high quality and well done collaboration of the best clips of some of the well known documentaries out there.  I even saw some things here that I haven't anywhere else.

Put it this way. If you have an interest in learning all there is about the global New World Order agenda, then this film is certainly worth a watch."
,Resist-NWO,2010-08-01T20:27Z,"Btw, the title is ""A Wake Up Call"".

I have been trying to update the description to add the title, but the ""Save"" button isn't working.  I've tried it in IE and FF.

Anyone have a solution for this, lol"

,blurrybigfoot,2010-08-26T00:46Z,"Please stop calling these documentaries.

Documentaries tell a story of real people and let the viewer decide.  This isn't documenting anything.

Reality TV is more of a documentary then this, and that's saying something.

Micheal Moore has ruined it for true documentary fans."
,Resist-NWO,2010-09-04T22:16Z,"@blurrybigfoot, its not documenting anything?  You obviously haven't watched it then.  It clearly documents the New World Order agenda, the people  and organizations involved, and tons more.  

I'm sorry, but your above comment makes no sense at all to me.  What exactly do you consider a documentary?    Perhaps knowing your definition of the term will help all of us understand exactly what you mean.

I've studied these topics in depth and watched every film available as well, and I still chose this as very helpful for educating the average person on some very important details concerning issues that affect them greatly all the time.

Also blurrybigfoot, I don't think your comment was the least bit useful or productive to anyone at all.  Who really gives a shit what ""type"" of film this is?  The content is solid and educational."
