,nice_big_guy,2010-08-23T08:48Z,"Fist of all I did not ""steal"", I ""copied""!
I make this compilation of files so anyone don't need to search for crack or need to unpack or need to burn DVD.
So you decide am I nice guy or am I bad guy."

,mmster,2010-10-17T22:59Z,"ThankÂ´s! It works.

Also for oblivion (found in another torrentcomment):

- For Oblivion Lost, copy gamedata folder from ol22_for_10005, to the STALKER folder:
http://www.filefront.com/11944194/ol22_for_10005.7z/

- Edit file fsgame.ltx in the STALKER folder, at the game_data line. Change both variables to true (one of them is already true).

Play."

,Assassin2009,2011-07-05T09:56Z,"For those, who don't understand: 

""6. Copy the file XR_3DA.exe from installation directory to /Program Files/THQ/S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl/bin and overwright existing file.""

1) Open a directory, where did you downloaded this game, and where is an ""setup.exe""
2) Move this window to right side of your screen.
3) Now click (twice) on ""My Computer"", then ""Local Disk (C:)"", then ""All Programs"", then ""THQ"", then ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl"", then ""bin"", and move this window to the left side of your screen.
4) And the final step is: Move ""XR_3DA.exe"" from the right window to the left window, but only hold ""CTRL"" on your keybord too (to copy this file, not to replace)


Now you are ready to play this game.

But I won't be able to play, cause my PC is too bad... :(

But I will seed for some time ;)"

,ohdamns,2011-08-23T23:15Z,Works great. 
,boarding546,2011-09-24T09:32Z,Works well thanks!
,marasmo,2011-09-28T23:48Z,"Hey, big guy! Awesome upload, but I have a little problem. Once I did all the steps successfully, I'm required to insert the disc. Any ideas? I use winXP"
,lukyblakcat,2012-03-17T19:04Z,"To anyone having the issue of this (or any other) program you were successful in installing but are required to insert a disc in order to run it, here's a possible solution:

Create an ISO of the program with MagicIso (or similar), then mount the ISO with Daemon Tools (or similar). Then try running the program again.

Using a crack may help, too...

The only other solution would be to buy the software, but where's the fun in that? That's effectively why torrents and cracks were made: To help those who bought the software, but can't find it, to be able to run those annoying programs that require the disc to run. And to aid those of us who can't afford the program to ""try it before we buy it""."
,tflagger997,2012-04-07T02:42Z,Thanks for the decompressed version!
,HealthyRingworm,2012-06-15T21:48Z,"Hey if any of you could help me that would be awesome. I went through with all the steps up to the crack copying part. When i look through the files of S.T.A.L.K.E.R i can find a /bin. file. It's really bothering me because if i just try to copy it onto the  S.T.A.L.K.E.R- Shadow of Chernobyl, it succeeds, and when i try to play it. It says i need a disk. I'm going to mount it, but if someone can help me, that would be easier.
Thanks."
