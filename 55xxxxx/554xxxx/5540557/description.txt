Film Description

â€˜Ibogaine â€“ Rite of Passageâ€™ is a documentary about the use of the controversial substance â€˜Ibogaineâ€™ for the treatment of addiction. Ibogaine is a substance that is derived from an African plant, which is used during initiations of the Bwiti culture in Gabon. In the sixties the anti-addictive properties were discovered by Howard Lotsof, who was an American heroin addict at that time. Shortly after his discovery, Ibogaine became illegal in the US.

Ibogaine is surrounded by controversy and the pharmaceutical companies show no interest in this substance. Is it because of economical reasons or its hallucinogenic effects?

Cy (34) has been using a mixture of heroine and amphetamine for about 11 years, but his three children and his ambitions are more valuable to him. Kicking his addiction is a tough job for him. It reveals all his suppressed emotions.

Massavou (22) lives in the village MitonÃ© in Gabon. For her the traditional African initiation is part of a healing process. She suffered from an illness for more than a year and she hopes that eating the holy plant will be the starting point of a new phase in her life.

This revealing documentary shows the different aspects of this special substance by means of personal experiences and explanations of ex-addicts, treatment providers and â€˜expertsâ€™.
