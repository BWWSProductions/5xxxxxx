I dont remember if my old version had those.
Thx!"
[V],Slickinator,2010-05-11T19:48Z,yes it always said that what it is is a full working trialware with the trial crap removed so basicly a full version it just does not know it lol

31 antivirus programs report eset fix.exe as a trojan or other malware. I'd like to run it sandboxed but it needs to modify other files. So I am sort of stuck at the moment. This may be a false positive but if so it is a unusually suspicious one."
[V],Slickinator,2010-09-06T14:11Z,its your choice i have been using it on my computer for a long time and nothing wrong and others and everyone is happy and it is a false positive so its up too you

,Killer Death,2011-04-25T17:15Z,"This fix is the best crack for Nod32. It works also on Smart security. Don't bother with that Tnod or Nodenabler or Nodlogin, just use this and disable updating program components just in case. Many thanks to the uploader, Slickinator!"
,TheHumanBot,2012-02-07T00:49Z,Works PERFECTLY. Thanks. No more crappy NodLogin updating every month.
,hawkeye3813,2012-03-18T20:09Z,"I have had this program with the crack for months and months and never had any problems updating the definitions. It has worked for me flawlessly.
The only problem I had was Nod found the crack and deleted it lol. This is a wonderful program and crack and it is 100% virus free so if you people out there have the silly free virus  programs ie: AVG Free and the likes, then they will pick it up as a Trojan,,, It is NOT a trojan and there is no need to panic. Just do as the instructions says and ""hey presto"" .  Wonderful stuff. "
