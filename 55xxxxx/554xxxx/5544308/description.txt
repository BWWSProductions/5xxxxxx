These are Yu Yu Hakusho Blu-Ray encodes. I did not encode these myself. Originally, they only had Japanese audio. All I did was add in AC3 audio (resynced) and subtitles from DVD sources. All episodes and textless openings and endings are dual audio with subtitles. I will release more whenever QTS provides more RAWs.

How can you enjoy your summer vacation stuck in the hottest parts of Hell?

Yusuke Urameshi is not exactly what you'd call an angel. In fact, some might call him down right devilish. But when he dies in an accident trying to save a child, he finds himself in the Spirit World. Unfortunately for Yusuke, his name is not listed in the Book of Enma, which means it was one big mistake!So he should return from the Spirit World, but must pass a few tests first, and become a detective of the spiritual world.
