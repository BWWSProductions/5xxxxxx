Organize everything
Stay on top of your entire collection. Drag and drop photos into WindowsÂ® file folders, add keywords and ratings, edit your metadata, and create your own categories. Assign images to as many categories as you like without taking up more space on your computer. Rename, rotate and resize groups of photos at once. 

Find your favorites
With ACDSee, you'll never lose track of a single shot again, even if you have thousands of photos in your collection. Enter multi-word keywords like â€œNew Jerseyâ€ or â€œwedding partyâ€, search only specific folders, and find that one special image with the Quick Search bar. 

Use the handy Calendar or Events view to see photos from a birthday party, vacation trip or other special occasion. 

Picture-perfect memories
Show off photos in their best light. Instantly adjust exposure, fix common problems like red eye and blemishes, and erase distracting objects. Rescue photos that are too light or dark with a single click, thanks to ACDSeeâ€™s patent-pending Shadow/Highlights tool. Write text, add a vignette, or apply an artistic effect such as sepia, stained glass, or crayon drawing. You can even adjust a selected area of your photo, such as a single flower or a face in the crowd.
