The Marriage Ref S01E10

The panel consists of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jerry Seinfeld and Greg Giraldo. The marriage problems this week are: a wife who won't answer her cellphone when her husband calls, a husband who wants his wife to dress in the "stripper chic" style of Miami, a husband-and-wife magic act in which the wife feels uncomfortable with the new knife-throwing act and a husband who sleeps on the couch to get a good night's sleep. 

The resolution is 512x384 and the video quality is good but the audio quality isn't great (the source recording had the same problems). However, the episode is still quite watchable in my opinion. A sample file is included that gives a good idea of the audio quality. 

I am uploading this poorer-than-usual-quality copy because this episode doesn't seem to have been uploaded to a public site by anyone else.
