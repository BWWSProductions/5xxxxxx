Series info (from Wikipedia): This Is Wonderland is a Canadian television series which aired on CBC Television. The show is about Alice De Raey, played by Cara Pifko, a young criminal lawyer fresh out of Osgoode Hall Law School, and thrown into a chaotic justice system. She encounters characters ranging from the truly desperate to the bizarre. Alice, with a good-natured openness that cloaks a tenacious, committed spirit, finds herself on a journey that constantly tests her patience and compassion. 

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
