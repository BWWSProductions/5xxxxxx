,theos911,2011-07-19T03:51Z,"How to use:
To burn on a windows PC:
Put the CD you wish to burn on into a macintosh computer and format it as hfs+ in disk utility. Then come back to your pc and download the demo of TransMac. In transmac go to File -> Open Disk image and choose the image. Then, in the left panel, right click on the image you selected and hit Burn to CD/DVD. I tested it on an iBook g4 and it is bootable, so stop whining because you don't know how to burn mac CD on a windows PC."
