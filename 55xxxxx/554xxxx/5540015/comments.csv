,23joecool,2010-05-07T09:07Z,"so, but can that be played without the beta key and battlenet account ?"
,beamto,2010-05-07T14:29Z,"I tried it on MacOS 10.4 :
after clicking the game icon, a window appears and downloads updates. After having successfully updated and then clicking the ""Play"" button an error message says, that necessary files are missing and then it quits. When I try to start the game again, then only the error message, asking for the missing files, appears.

The missing file could be a License file...

Result: I cannot play it...

,monkeybro,2010-05-07T23:04Z,"wont creating a B-net account with another Blizzard game work? ie, WC3, Diablo 2."
,fsmc,2010-05-08T05:07Z,"fl1m, you can get a free bnet account from blizzards website.  but i don't know if this will help you:
.on 10.5 i get an error during patch updating at around 85% or so:
Blizzard Updater was unable to read the file ""Mods/Liberty.SC2Mod/Base.SC2Assets/Assets/Textures/commandcenterwrecked_diffuse.dds"".

,ionlyknow,2010-05-08T11:48Z,"Hm okay... I installed the game succefully and started it with no problems. But whn i enter my battle . net accout it says ""this account does not have a valid CD-key attached to it."" 
So i'm gonna need a valid CD-key in order to play it. "
,ionlyknow,2010-05-08T12:09Z,"Hmm I just found the next best thing. 
This version ill not be playable online, but singleplayer works. It's legit and downloadable from a website. Remember to remove the spaces. and change ""dot"" to a real dot

,rikal,2010-05-09T02:17Z,You need a Battle.net account AND to have been invited to the beta to get in.
,Tseran,2010-05-09T06:03Z,"Indeed the commenters are correct.  This is BATTLENET ONLY.  You need an INVITE or it will NOT work.  There is NO SINGLE PLAYER BETA.  How do I know?  I am actually in the beta, and I wish there was a single player.  For now at least, they are testing Battle.net with it, as a lot of the new features are being added into WoW as well, so may as well get both tested at the same time.  If you don't have an invite, the most you can get from this is datamine a few graphics, animations and sound files, most of which are already out there.  But seed all you want."
,bettse,2010-05-09T07:51Z,"Get AI (single player) maps from http://darkblizz.org/Forum2/ai-scripts/starcraft-2-beta-offline-ai-maps/

Run using Terminal command:
open ""Starcraft II.app"" --args -run ""${MAPLOCATION}""

This worked for me for the (4) - AI - Lost Temple (1x) map with the caveat that there was an error at the beginning of the game, and the AI never got beyond gathering resources.  It might be a map bug, I'm not sure."
,adriensmart,2010-05-09T14:41Z,"@bettse I've tried your method, Starcraft II beta loards succesfull, but it says it can't load the map... Do you know why ? Is there a problem with updates of the game ?"

He's available here : http://mp107.free.fr/Fichiers/SC2/
Simply download the maps and launch the app. Then, select the map that you want to play and point out the SC2 app ;)

Have fun !"
