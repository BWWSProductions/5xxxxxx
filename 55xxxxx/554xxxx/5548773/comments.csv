,gary27,2010-05-11T02:59Z,Awesome thanks bro....I look forward to these updates..  :-)
,ptv83,2010-05-11T03:49Z,"lol, don't know roman numerals? 

1=I
2=II
3+III
4=IV
5=V
6=VI
7=VII
8=VIII
9=IX
10=X
11=XI
12=XII .. can you guess what 13 is?
14=XIV
15=XV
16, 17 and 18... can you guess?
19=XIX
20=XX
50=L , so 40 is XL (50 minus 10, just like 4 is VI, or 5 minus 1)
and 60 is LX or 50 plus 10 , like six is five plus one.. or ""VI""
65 is LXV, and 68 is LXVIII
88 is LXXXVIII
89 is LXXXIX
90 is XC, because C is 100 (cent)
500 is D
1000 is M .. all the numbers in between follows the base number(V,X,L,C,D,M) plus or minus the variable of lower value, listed before one less than the base number, and after is one higher
...if you need more help than this, go back to grade school.. or google it if you have any self respect."
,katespam8,2010-05-11T07:07Z,"eztv, you are the absolute BEST. Can I make a request--could you do The Soup? I can't find it anywhere. Thank you!!"
,lewisg,2010-05-11T08:45Z,ptv83... shame. They was just asking if its 'nine'. not for you to over explain and belittle them. 
,lewisg,2010-05-11T08:46Z,"Super fast download, thanks heaps EZ"
,Dalej,2010-05-11T09:27Z,"Not knowing basic roman numbers IS spectacularly pathetic. 

Are you an american? "
,Ufa_kefe,2010-05-11T09:39Z,Cheers bud
,Malakka,2010-05-11T12:15Z,"Thanks for the ninth time, eztv. 
Mondays are worth waiting for. 

You are the man!"
,necronwn,2010-05-11T17:39Z,Good torrent but the Pacific series are half as good as band of brothers
,Minerva7101,2010-05-11T20:13Z,"Why are the episodes numbered with roman numerals anyway? There's no reason to do that, it just confuses people who don't know them.

Use the proper episode names instead."
,IMINFLuential,2010-05-11T20:23Z,"Actually Roman Numerals aren't ""American"" they were for the Romans who were in no way American. Moron. It should be a lost way of doing numbers because the Romans are gone as should their cruel creations."
,claireparker,2010-05-12T01:28Z,"ptv83. You are a Dick Head.  It is you who needs to go back to school (Infant School that is). """"3+III""""  and also """"just like 4 is vi"""" !!!!!!!!!!!.  You need to be taught some manners and how to respect others.  Put the dunce hat on and go and sit in the corner of the room."
,giantslayer12,2010-05-12T05:38Z,"eztv, Thanks for the upload, great quality and very timley.
