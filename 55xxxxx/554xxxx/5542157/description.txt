I don't know what has happened to Farnorth our provider of the Nintendo DS Rompacks since rom 3301, but I hope he/she is alright.

Since Farnorth has vanished from TPB, also all Torrents went with him/her.
So here they are, the complete legacy of all Torrents Farnorth has left for us.

All Torrent files where checked and still work.

For your convenience I've also added all Torrent descriptions as a NFO file.
No NDS file lists though, only the description which Farnorth has written on his posts.
You have to check the files for yourself with OfflineList or similar program.

The included torrent files can be used to download the following Nintendo DS Rompacks:

A big shout out to Farnorth for giving us this legacy of the finest Rompacks.
Wherever you are, I hope you're doing alright!

Also a big shout out to Joda for beginning this legacy and to Emuparadise for continuing where Farnorth has left off.
