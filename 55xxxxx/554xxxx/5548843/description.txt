Description: International Hip Hop superstar Nas and Grammy-winning artist Damian â€œJr. Gongâ€ Marley join creative forces to release this highly anticipated and exciting 2010 collaboration. This is an album created by the two serious artists to explore and celebrate the correlations and deep-rooted connections between reggae and Hip Hop, tracing both sounds back to the African motherland that is both the cradle of humanity and the wellspring of mankindâ€™s music. The project features the signature instrumentation and musicianship of Marley with the hard-hitting beats and lyrics of Nas. Distant Relatives traces the direct line from Dancehall Reggaeâ€™s breakthrough moment 40 years ago to the rise of Hip Hop several years later.
