Track descriptions:
01 Contains a different Springsteen vocal overdub and a very long, extended jam ending. 
02 This track has the original Van Zandt background vocals.
03 Slighly different version / mix.
04 Unedited, contains an entire extra verse (about Bruceâ€™s dad) that was cut from the officially released version.
05 One of his finest studio performances. For some bizarre reason Springsteen & The E Street Band re-recorded the 
song in 1995 and released that re-recording on 'Greatest Hits' â€“ but it pales in comparison to this original.
06 Different mix than on the one released on 'Tracks'.
07 Bruce borrowed the first two lines from Chuck Berryâ€™s song â€œBye Bye Johnnyâ€ (as well as the play on the title), 
which is why itâ€™s registered as a Springsteen-Berry composition.
08 Originally recorded for "Darkness", and recorded again here, this was considered for the 'Greatest Hits' collection but was finally dropped.
09 Full, unedited version that includes lyric changes and the complete raucous ending. This track runs nearly a full 1:30 longer than the released version.
10 Slighly different version / mix.
11 A bit longer version.
12 Beautiful keyboards by Danny and Roy augment some fine acoustic guitar playing by Bruce.
13 Presented in best-ever quality, this unreleased gem far eclipses any current circulated versions.
14 Unreleased studio outtake.
15 Wonderful tune with a killer chorus - note the bass line similar to the Human Touch B-side '30 Days Out'
16 Short but energetic rocker.

* 'Thrill Hill West' is Springsteenâ€™s home studio in Los Angeles (aka 'Hollywood Hills Garage Studio').
* Most band tracks are E Street Band backing versions from so-called â€œelectric Nebraska sessionâ€

- Track 8 from 'Lost Masters IV', LOVE 004

Track descriptions:
01 The original mix without the new (90's) vocal track or the overdubbed second guitar on 'The Essential BS'. One of my favourite tracks, too bad the sound quality is what it is.
02 Different mix permutation of the same core recording as #1.
03 Completely different recording than the released 'Cover Me' done in a dramatically different arrangement. 
This may actually date from a later period in the sessions than the original 'Cover Me'.
04 Same core recording as on 'Tracks', but has a much longer fade out (very nice) and features Steve Van Zandt on background vocals and guitar.
05 Different mix permutation of the same core recording as #1.
06 Different mix than on the one released on 'Tracks'.
07 Includes slightly different lyrics and an alternate beginning and ending.
08 This song was given to Donna Summer, who was recording an album at the time at the same studio. 
Summerâ€™s cover version (with Springsteen on guitar) was recorded in March 1982 (released Aug 82). 
Bruce and Donna also recorded a duet vocal version at her sessions â€“ it remains uncirculating.
09 Original mix with the saxophone track (deleted on 'Tracks').
10 Features Ruth Jackson on background vocals. Possibly recorded at the same session as 'My Hometown' (which also features Jackson).
11 By far the definitive version of this song â€“ contains an additional, important lyric verse that has been cut from all the other versions.
12 Brilliant song that developed from a 1981-82 work-in-progress composition called 'James Lincoln Dear'
13 Unreleased studio outtake.
14 Unreleased studio outtake.
15 Compelling song. Features a dark, brooding beat that mirrors the disturbing nature of the lyrics. A nice vocal performance here and we're left wondering what possessed him to write this one.
16 Add this to the ever expanding list of Bruce's greatest unreleased songs. A man surveys his life and wonders if he can ever escape the demons of his past.

* 'Thrill Hill West' is Springsteenâ€™s home studio in Los Angeles (aka 'Hollywood Hills Garage Studio').
* Most band tracks are E Street Band backing versions from so-called â€œelectric Nebraska sessionâ€

======================================

OK, so I had already done the 'Born To Run', 'Darkness' & 'The River' outtakes, most BITUSA outtake bootlegs only have 1cd
and don't include as many different tracks as I'd like to. So I just tried to add all important tracks to the same boot.
I know, not every outtake is included and that wasn't my intention either.

The first disc is supposed to be the original track listing of 'Murder Incorporated', the never-released 1983 album which was
(as you can see/hear) a lot darker than 'Born In The U.S.A.' Also included are the 5 b-sides Bruce had intended to use. (SEE BELOW)

When burning this compilation, make sure you burn it DAO - without the 2 seconds gaps between each track.

Big thanks to a few people on SPL (reidneile, jumpstone) - I hope you all enjoy this.
This one's dedicated to 'richr' and all his friends over at 'Thunder Road'.

Thanks to brucebase & theboots.net for some of the song descriptions.

===============

By July 1983 Springsteen was in the final stages of mixing and track selection for the album. There was talk of a pre-Christmas release. 
There was certainly no shortage of outstanding material to pick from. A document exists from mid 1983 revealing Springsteenâ€™s selection for the BITUSA album, 
as well his selections for b-sides. It was as follows:

BORN IN THE USA
MURDER INCORPORATED
DOWNBOUND TRAIN
GLORY DAYS
THIS HARD LAND
MY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN
JOHNNY BYE BYE
FRANKIE
Iâ€™M GOIN DOWN
WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY
Iâ€™M ON FIRE
b-side / SUGARLAND
b-side / FOLLOW THAT DREAM
b-side / DONâ€™T BACK DOWN
b-side / ONE LOVE
b-side / LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU
