Mac OS X Snow Leopard Retail DVD modified by myself to be burned on a single layer DVD. (DVD+/-R) 

I removed:

1-The Printers drivers (but the Gutenprint wasn't removed because it supports a lot of printers and it takes only 10Mo)
2-The X11 Package
3-All additional languages i don't removed the French and the German package.
3-Additionals fonts package.

The iso is already in Test and can be used with EmpireEFI for hackintoshs.


Good luck! ;)
