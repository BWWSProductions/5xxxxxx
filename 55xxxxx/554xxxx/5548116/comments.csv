Thanks in advance!"

,Cody1233,2010-06-11T22:53Z,Is it in english? Will I have to register this or pay any money for it after i download it?
,Giraffe19,2010-06-13T11:38Z,Is this a dmg file or iso????
,dj_akasha,2010-06-13T21:35Z,"Giraffe19 if you read the info you will see that it says ""The iso is already in Test and can be used with EmpireEFI for hackintoshs."" I'm pretty sure that means its an iso."
,mreps07,2010-06-17T14:11Z,can this be use in an ordinary PC..?either intel or AMD processor..?
,macca0126,2010-06-18T00:11Z,"Guys i'll try the torrent and tell u lot if it works alright, but for now PLZ SEEEEED!!!!!!"
,DrStoooopid,2010-06-24T03:56Z,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the X11 packages required?"
,pastebaye,2010-07-02T17:05Z,"Its a DMG, so difficult to manage in a PC. I have been unable to produce anything but coasters with this in a mac virtual machine, though things like snowosx burn fine. Best avoid."
,StephanFortin,2010-07-06T09:34Z,"Avoid using it, it is only to install the ORIGINAL OSX, not snow leopard."
,boring123,2010-07-12T12:34Z,I haven\'t downloaded this but I want to say you do not need the X11 package for anything but running Unix applications. All Mac applications will run without it.
,boring123,2010-07-14T04:05Z,So does this work?n
,boring123,2010-07-14T21:48Z,"I have been using this for several hours now with a problem. Its real and appears to work fine. 10.6 changes the default gamma on the display, that was a small shock. Its slightly faster overall, but mostly you can\'t tell its not 10.5."
,boring123,2010-07-14T21:50Z,"Crap, I meant WITHOUT a problem."
,annidas,2010-07-27T17:47Z,"@boring123 

How do I burn this onto a DVD? I converted the dmg file to an iso file and after this the size exceeds one dvd. Please help.."
,annidas,2010-07-27T17:48Z,Oh and I am using Windows.
,Adi11,2010-08-02T09:01Z,"Hi.

I searched all the internet, tried a lot of software but can't get it done.
And can it be used with Iboot for Hackintosh?
but, thank you for the good work.

,njastars,2010-08-02T20:23Z,"@adi11 u need to convert the dmg to an iso, im pretty sure u can use ultraiso, you may want to  find an install tut for ur specific pc. not all are compatible or have the necessary drivers"
,uberblunt,2010-09-01T03:51Z,has anyone successfully used this on a mac? i'd like to put snow leopard on my macbook.
,CustomA,2010-09-01T19:00Z,can anyone confirm that this is snow leopard? and also can i boot to this from my mac mini so that i can partition my drive?
,tbonzes,2010-09-15T18:24Z,"I got a macbook pro with intel core duo 2.16 and the cd booted up holding the c button and it is snow leopard and everything works. I burned the disk in disk utilty on my hackintosh, Its a dmg file and my MBP had turned off while doing a system update and would only boot into panic and need to be restarted. Yesterday Tiger and today snow leopard with all the updates. The only mac cd I had was snow leopard 10.6 DL and my superdrive don't read DL disk so I'm glad it worked."
,tbonzes,2010-09-15T18:55Z,"And for thoose people tring to burn download it and get transmac. Download transmac its a free trial download just go to cnet download.. with transmac find the file sorry I just checked and my transmac is expired or I would tell ya step for step, so find the file on transmac and I think in the tools section there is a place that says burn file and I have win 7 and I can't remeber its been over a year which burning program I used or if win 7 did by defalt. Hope this helps"
,kenmo346,2010-09-26T23:13Z,"I downloaded this and tried both dmg2img and UltraISO and both told me it was corrupted. I then copied it over to my Mac and it burned with no complaints to DVD and appeared to be OK, but it will not boot on any PC I have... not worth the bother IMHO."
,kena85,2011-01-09T04:55Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! 

I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM MY INTERNET PROVIDER STATING THAT THIS DOWNLOAD WAS ILLEGAL... I THINK IF SOMEONE GETS 3 OF THOSE THEN YOUR INTERNET GETS SUSPENDED. IT ALSO SAID THAT APPLE COULD PRESS CHARGES... SO JUST BE CAREFUL!!! "
,xfact0r,2011-02-16T18:18Z,"Seed, please. I will post a comment right after I install and test it as well."
,UAofE,2011-04-26T17:44Z,kena85 is a genuine idiot. NOTHING on TPB is legal!
,georgi25,2011-05-20T21:49Z,"Installed it on Mac Mini 1.66Mhz Intel, working perfect for now, did the updates as well, everything good, thanks a lot for the torrent!!!!:)"
,Sireniankyle,2011-10-20T21:52Z,"you only get those warnings with ISP's that are nosy assholes. i straight up asked mine, and they said they don't give a shit what i do so long as it isn't spam e-mailing."
,Sireniankyle,2011-10-20T21:53Z,oh and i think apple has its hands full with samsung atm.
,antoniosolo13,2012-03-27T12:07Z,"You are the man!!!!!!!!!! I've been trinna make myself a Snow Leopard single layer DVD for weeks now!!!! Now that I found this torrent, Imma seed untill I downgrade from Mountain Lion!! I'll recomment if it worked for me!! "
,gary2234,2012-04-14T00:10Z,Great downspeed. 1MB/s+ the entire time! Yet to test install though
,Suomisisu,2012-05-30T15:42Z,If you're scared shitless of your ISP tracking your downloads you should just install 'Peerblock' and it'll block your ISP from being able to see what you are downloading. I'm going to try this out because unfortunately my USB drive is 100MB too small to fit the disc on it as a 'restore' when I select the GUID partitioning scheme...
