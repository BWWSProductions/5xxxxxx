======================================

First of all, this was originally going to be a 2cd set of 'Darkness' studio outtakes. As I kept editing these songs, there
was no way they could've fit on only 2cd's. (Plan was, 1cd 'Original Darkness Mixes', other cd of various outtakes)
Then next thing I noticed, I had planned a 6cd set with 2cd's of Live tracks... In the end I decided not to
include the live cd's which made this 'only' a 67 track, 4cd collection. I used John's 'brucebase' website (link somewhere below)
as a database to see which tracks were 'worth' editing, where I could find them and so on.

Making this a 4cd set allowed me to include some of the tracks I would've otherwise left out, such as the alternative
'Dont Look Back' & 'Ramrod' which are both in a bit worse sound quality. I wouldn't say any of the tracks sound 'bad'.

When burning this compilation, make sure you burn it DAO - without the 2 seconds gaps between each track.

My favourite tracks: D3Track01 & D3Track16.

Big thanks to FrankiesJoint & Jumpstone for finding me most of the tracks.
