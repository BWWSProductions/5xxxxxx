FSX Digital Aviation Fokker 70/100 (RIP) Dont know if it will work as its a rip, just stick the files in the normal places!! If any other files are needed and you know where they are located let me know and ill upload them!!!

NOTE:- .DOES NOT WORK WELL ON WIN 7 64BIT (Which i have) FPS drop in main cockpit

       .Also there maybe textures missing of the FMC, please go to the Digital Aviation folder in FSX  and read the RAR fokker fonts to sort the proplem!!!!

        .2D cockpit only!!!!!
