,aarque,2010-05-09T01:05Z,"The CaptainSim 767 is uncrackable. Even if you uploaded it you would have to re-write the panel.cfg to include replacement gauges. The Level-D 767 and the Concorde-X are the same. The Overland 767 uses the same textures as the Level-D and I have uploaded one here which includes the LVLD Aeromexico livery to demonstrate.
