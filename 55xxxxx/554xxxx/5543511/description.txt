ONE OF THE BEST HELICOPTERS FROM ALPHASIM!!!!!!


The awesome Kamov attack helicopter swoops into action in FSX and FS9. This outstanding premier package depicts the 'Werewolf' in meticulous detail, both the exterior and interior models display breathtaking realism, the VC in particular is a major tour de force in terms of realism for both FS9 and FSX (note that FSX model is full-spec, not merely a 'port-over') - using AlphaSim's amazing 'RealGauge' tech, in-cockpit framerates and fine gauge detail reach unbelievable levels. All the actual Russian text is there, the Heads-Up display is also fully authentic. The expertly-crafted flight model depicts the physics of the unique Kamov contra-rotating rotor system to the highest level!
