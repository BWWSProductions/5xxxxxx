,mustavapoo,2010-05-10T18:50Z,"Thankyou so much for adding this to The Bay.
Works A Treat.Just What I Needed And Sorted In A Double Click.
Scanned and Clean. I Only Upgraded My RAM and then was told Windows needed Re-Activating.Within 3 Days!! And It Would Not Let Me. Apparently When The 3 Days Are Up,Windows Shuts Down And Your Computer Is Basically Useless.
This Is A True Lifesaver.Thankyou to the maker behind it.
Highly recommended."
,yen11m,2010-05-13T05:04Z,"I've been using xp-pro sp2 since ages, and it has automatic updates shut down. Do u mean it upgrades my old windows with all new ms-updates w/o any risks or is it something else."
,PoliteMan,2010-05-13T10:04Z,"No,You can leave your automatic updates switched off.All this does is by-pass the windows product activation(WPA) and leaves your computer as was. You still have the choice to update or not,your computer is in a completely activated state and will pass any genuine checks."
,4Gustav,2010-05-19T11:57Z,"Yeah, thanks from me too !!
It works just as described."
,velvetyavro1,2010-05-25T02:29Z,"I have used this patch 3 times in the past 3 months...it works initially, but then after 30 days, I am not able to log into windows until I activate...I have windows xp home edition...can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong?...thanks"
,guitarplayer5544,2010-05-25T17:56Z,"omfg, best ever, i was looking for something like this for a long time, my copy of windows was originally only for big businesses with liscences with microsoft. thank you PoliteMan!"
,PoliteMan,2010-05-27T10:40Z,"Danjerus1,Thankyou for letting me know this also works on MCE 2005. There are probably lots of systems it will activate too(it is always worth trying).
I am also happy that you have included this patch in the torrent you have uploaded.The more people this can help out,the better.
I was not happy about the changes Microsoft have made,you can't even upgrade your RAM,Change your Hard Drive without having to Re-Activate Now.Then You find it won't let you.
Well YOU CAN NOW with this. Ha ha

Good luck my friend.

Also,If anyone has got this to work on different platforms could you please leave a comment saying which.That way it will be most helpful to others having the same issues.
It is completely safe and worth trying on any.

,KIWIXBOXER,2010-06-10T22:10Z,This does not work at all ... and it is a virus
,PoliteMan,2010-06-19T13:04Z,"KiwiBoxer,Whilst this may not work for you,it has for thousands of others.This is a second updated version of an original patch and definately has no virus within.Have you heard of the old false negative? Depends what you are running and what spyware/antivirus you are using.Also,as it states in the ""read me"" part.It is always advisable to scan any program for virus's before running/installing.If that shows clean then go ahead and install.If you get a virus warning then,you can guarantee it is a false negative and it is completely safe to continue.
It is also advisable to have automatic updates switched off and just update manually and selectively to ensure trouble free continued use.
Whilst programs like this help thousands of users it it not going to work for everyone.That said,it does not hurt to try.
Look at all the good comments above!!
Not that bad aye!"
,yen11m,2010-07-21T04:51Z,"Politeman, just done the patch, can i download updates from MS? without any fear of activation request from MS. Before 2-years, once i tried . and lost my hard-drive.. it scared hell out of me...will appreciate your reply. Ta"
,PoliteMan,2010-07-23T23:03Z,"Yes Mate,I still Update From MS with no problems.
Make a back up of this incase you ever need to use again say after hardware upgrades.MS are a pain in the arse. Good luck my friend"
