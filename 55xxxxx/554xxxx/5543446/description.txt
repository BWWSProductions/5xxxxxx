Paul Lamb and the King Snakes play the blues with an authenticity and drive unmatched by any other band in the UK today. As the interest in quality blues of all types continues to rise higher and higher, the undoubted brilliance of Paul Lamb's harp playing, combined with the band's great technical skill and tight performances, will ensure that the title of Top Blues Band in London stays with them for sometime. This album was recored in the autumn 1989, "live" in the studio, and blues fans will undoubtedly read many influences into their varied set that uses a Chicago-style reference point, tinged with some West Coast swing, all performed with unbeatable style."
