The Urantia Book (sometimes called the Urantia Papers  or The Fifth Epochal Revelation) is a spiritual  and philosophical book that discusses God, Jesus, science, cosmology, religion, history  and destiny.[1]  It originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA, sometime between 1924 and 1955. There has been much debate and speculation on how the papers were produced[2]  and who the authors were.
