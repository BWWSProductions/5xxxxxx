,shully1995,2010-05-08T20:53Z,"This trainer is no better than shit,if you activate Unlimited Health the enemies will have also unlimited health :-|"
,azothegreat,2010-05-08T22:19Z,"@shully1995

what in the hell are you talking about just activate the cheats and press C so the enemy would be taken out easily and you can take out many enemies like this i have tried myself."
,blazeddddd,2010-05-09T21:07Z,"hey.. i was wondering if you could add something that would enable execute all the time. like an Always Execute option. dont get me wrong, the other cheats may be great, but i just want something to enable execute.. thanks"
,blazeddddd,2010-05-10T07:25Z,"also.. this isn't working. i did the check game version and it said it was the correct one. i went in game and pressed Insert, and then numpad 7- to save my place, and when i press 8 nothing happens. i also tried pressing ""c"" i also tried numpad 1,2,3, nothing worked.. not sure whats up. got windows xp."
,LanceLionroar,2011-09-07T02:18Z,Fucking seriously? No seeders?? What's the use of this goddamn download if there are no seeders..
