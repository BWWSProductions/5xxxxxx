,truenova,2010-05-08T21:13Z,Thanks alot was just looking around for a compilation download and this pops up as the first search result
,krokie10,2010-05-09T00:53Z,"I need to shut down for now. I'll be back in 12 hours to seed further. Availability in uTorrent reads 2.737 (I've upped 45 GB already), so if everybody stays connected there should be no problems."
,devilstutor,2010-05-09T11:29Z,"please seeeeeeeeeeeeed!!!
its downloading at 15-40 kbps only :S
and thank you for uploading!! :-)))"
,devilstutor,2010-05-14T17:54Z,"ok i had downloaded the first file of 5.5 gb and its an ISO but how can i burn it ?? it says not enough space on my DVD disc!!
please help me :S"
,devilstutor,2010-05-14T17:57Z,i mean do it need a DVD copy to run or the crack is enough ?
,Nerte,2010-05-14T19:56Z,"^ Dude, welcome to 2010. Dual layer DVDs are 8,5 GB. Also, why burning it when you can simply load it with virtual drive?"
,DarkWish1,2010-05-15T01:21Z,"I have a similar torrent, but with its crack you can update and do whatever you want, and use the EA Download Manager. However, I cant seem to get the torrent uploaded to TPB for some reason, is there something Im missing? ive filled everything out right in the Upload Torrent page, but it just loads a blank page..."
,devilstutor,2010-05-15T09:06Z,"well i installed the first part as for me downloading mean 30/Kbps and it takes me days to complete downloading,
1) there is no crack for main part so i had download from some where else and its working
2) patch is not working it gives and error after finishing !"
,krokie10,2010-05-15T11:04Z,"devilstutor, as instructed, you should run the updates on the uncracked versions of the game. After that, you only crack the latest expansion. (High End Loft Stuff in this case)"
,Nerte,2010-05-15T11:31Z,The instructions are wrong. I've installed the Sims 3 and now I should World Adventures. But it won't allow me because it wants to update Sims 3. Next time do better step by step manual.
,devilstutor,2010-05-15T12:49Z,"@ krokie10
I had done as you mentioned in the instruction but it dont wana update the first part as. Do i need to download complete versions and install for your crack ? coz i had downloaded the first part and installed it and the 2 other are still downloading in que!
i even found a crack from other but it starts the game but i cant make sim do anything coz it stays in car all the time :S"
,krokie10,2010-05-15T13:28Z,"If you only would like to install a proper subset of what is provided in the torrent, you'll need a crack for the latest expansion you'll be installing.
For instance, if you only want to install The Sims 3 (without expansions) you'll need a separate crack, specialized for The Sims 3.
If you like to use only World Adventures, you install and update only The Sims 3 and World Adventures. After that you need a crack which is designed for World Adventures.
In the creation of this torrent I assumed, you like to run The Sims 3 with all the expansions currently out there. To keep it as simple as possible, I only provided the crack for High End Loft Stuff, such that after closely following the instructions provided, you have the most recent (as to today) version of The Sims 3 and all it's expansions, retaining the possibility of future upgrades."
,lisathanthree,2010-05-16T02:35Z,"Can somebody please tell me exactly how to install?  I'm confused. D:
Thank you."
,krokie10,2010-05-16T17:17Z,"@lisathenthree
To install everything (as it's meant to be), just follow the instructions provided in the torrent closely.
However, if you don't want to install everything, follow the instructions in my previous thread."
,lisathanthree,2010-05-16T17:52Z,Do I extract all the files first into the same folders?
,krokie10,2010-05-16T19:55Z,"@lisathenthree
The torrent doesn't contain any files that require extracting, so I don't quite understand. Perhaps you mean the ISO-files. You can install directly from these DVD-images, by mounting them with an application like Deamon Tools. See also http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon"
,lisathanthree,2010-05-16T20:20Z,"What I downloaded has ""The Sims 3"", ""The Sims 3 - World Adventures"", and ""The Sims 3 - High End Loft stuff"" all as folders in the Sims 3 folder in my downloads.  (Plus the cracks and updates).  In those first three folders, it's all Winzip files. Should they not be Winzip?"
,Hailgun,2010-05-16T20:32Z,"I have the same problem as Nerte - after installing basic Sims 3 it won't install World Adventures, because it supposedly requires an updated version. I tried updating first, but it won't update because files are missing. Halp?"
,MS000086,2010-05-17T00:25Z,"I have a solution to make World Adventures install. Call me a genius. Now, it's a small fix because it probably won't work in future releases; however, it will now. I tested it with the game open now.

Nerte pointed out the same problem I ran into. This is how you fix it. It's quite simple.

-After installing the Sims 3, mount or put in the High End Loft CD.
-The same update question should pop up, so agree to it.
-Do NOT install High End Loft!
-Mount or place World Adventures CD and install the game.
-Mount or place High End Loft and install the game.
-Place the two provided cracks in the Bin file as per the instructions.
-Play the game!"
,m_vandy,2010-05-17T05:12Z,"So...here's my dilemma. Spent 2 days downloading. Run the sims 3 .iso with daemon tools. All is well. Enter the serial. And my computer resumes normal duties, as though I wasn't running an installation at all. Installed my actual copy of sims 3. Attempted to install World Adventures, get the message that the regional code is all wrong. What's up, and how can I fix it?"
,MS000086,2010-05-18T13:14Z,"Here's the issue. The Sims 3 is super anal about which version it uses.

I would check to see what language you have the original Sims installed as. If it differs from the World Adventures, it won't work.

I don't know what to do though, sorry. I would check Sims forums for possible answers.

Since the Pirate Bay is up and running again, I'm seeding. Aaarrrr."
,codak29,2010-05-18T16:44Z,This torrent is a mess. It downloads slow and the instructions in the readme file don't work. Took 4 days to download and I REAAAALLY regret it.
,m_vandy,2010-05-18T19:08Z,"I installed the sims 3 using the u.s as my region, and I can't even get to that point with world adventures, it tells me the versions don't match."
,pienoso,2010-05-19T13:32Z,"Pleas seed!
its downloading only 40/50 kbps!"
,jubrand,2010-05-25T04:06Z,"hey krokie10
 I have a very slow internet connection to download this file, and I need only The sims 3 World adventures version: 2.6.11 crack, the others games I have already been installing, but the the sims 3 world adventures is not with the correct version of the crack, and always erros returns when I start the game  
Could you separate it of yours package and to do the uploading only of that crack 2.6.11?"
,nikumus,2010-05-25T18:00Z,"(for devilstutor) Just download the Daemon Tools Lite, say to me if you need some help"
,dustinwebb,2010-05-28T04:26Z,seed please i will seed once i have it im DL @ 29KB/s!
,qtoot,2010-05-31T20:54Z,"the only thing is i cant get the packages to install such as riverview it shows i uploaded them but they don't appear in the game and nether do custom content that says its for high end loft  
thanks to MS000086 the instructions worked great i had so many problems at first with it not updating extra then i followed the directions and its like wow it works! if anyone can help with the package updates that would be greatly appreciated "
,qtoot,2010-05-31T23:05Z,and i also noticed when i go to any of the adventure spots and buy things they disappear when i get home might be a bug somewhere unsure
,Viviel,2010-06-06T22:44Z,"So I have a problem here, I installed everything, updated trough launcher as I thought it made no difference, oh well, now the crack doesn't work.
Do I need to have the exact versions of the game as mentioned in the instuctions?
If so, are the updated deletable?"
,Viviel,2010-06-06T22:46Z,"Ah, I see it now, need to get proper version of TS3SP01. Now to search if the update can be deleted."
,gvrega,2010-06-07T02:29Z,"What region are these isos? Also, can I update to more recent updates for the base game and expansions that I'm not loading with? In other words, if I'm launching with Ambitions with a crack for a specific ambitions version, if I update the base game and previous expansions to something more recent than what's here, will that matter?"
,urza4315,2010-06-07T04:47Z,"In case any of you are having trouble updating to the latest version of High End loft stuff, check your skuversion text file in your Bin folder. 

If your game version number ends in ""4001"" instead of ""4017"", you'll have to download this update here due to regional difference:

,amandadawnpalmer,2010-06-15T19:18Z,"I have the same problem as unsavory, but I'm new to torrents so I have no idea how to fix it.

I've installed all three of the games, but when it comes to updating them it tells me that it is an invalid file. 
Please help! "
,amandadawnpalmer,2010-06-15T21:32Z,"Nvm, I no longer have that problem, but I'm extremely confused about how to crack the game.
Please explain?"
,amandadawnpalmer,2010-06-15T22:10Z,"In the instructions, it mentions that you need to have the 3.2.8 version of TS3SP01. From what I can tell, I don't have this version, and I'm wondering how to get it. "
,ldbean,2010-06-17T05:49Z,"I followed the directions and did everything right, but when I tried to update the games, I noticed the same problem unsavory did. 

@unsavory 
where did you find the updates to fill the blanks?"
,ArtJenneration,2010-06-19T10:38Z,"Thanks for this!
Installed this and then downloaded http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5602530/The.Sims.3.Ambitions-ViTALiTY-%5BPC%5D-%5BMulti%5D-%5B2010%5D-%5BDirectasXD%5D, and it all works great!"
,shizzmonaay,2010-07-02T17:59Z,"Help me, it wont let me update the game, its says ""invalid file found error"" HELP PLEASE!"
,hobodan666,2010-07-03T10:57Z,The only way i got this to work ( I live in canada) is by selecting united kingdoms when installing the original sims iso then i installed world adventures then high end loft stuff did not crack anything did not update anything but then downloaded The.Sims.3.Ambitions-ViTALiTY installed then finally used crack included in file and FINALLY this all worked struggled with these fricking dvds and this Sims copy for days b4 finally getting this all to work IT WAS A NIGHTMARE used tons of patches tons of no dvd fixes nothing worked till then so i thought id help others out. oh and ps i installed zone alarm pro  firewall and blocked the Sh&% out of EA games and sims launcher because it has a nasty tendancy to try and dl stuff and verify your passwords and do crap behind the scenes without your permission so word to the wize. so to be clear: STEP 1# install sims 3 Step#2 install world adventures Step#3 Install high end loft stuff Step#4 install vitality version ambitions dled on pirate bay Step#4 dont dl updates nothing just crack with incuded cracks on ambitions image and bam works like a charm!
