          Wildflowers is the second solo album by American musician Tom Petty, released in     
          November 1994 (see 1994 in music). The album was the first released by Petty after   
          signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records and the first of three albums produced  
          by Rick Rubin.                                                                       
                                                                                               
          Three singles were released from the album between 1994 and 1995, the most successful
          of which, "You Don't Know How It Feels", reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and    
          topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for one week.                                     
                                                                                               
          The album features all members of the Heartbreakers with the exception of drummer    
          Stan Lynch, who left the band earlier in 1994. Steve Ferrone plays drums on          
          Wildflowers and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album
          was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, "Rick (Rubin) and I 
          both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys."                        
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            
                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
