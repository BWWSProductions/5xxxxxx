,lizette26,2010-05-13T23:30Z,"HI, I downloaded it and it worked but I'm having problems its in tons of different files they open but there are all separated its weird, I'm seeding it now as well can you please help me get them all together Im using a mac do I need to burn in it for it to work."
,Alemada,2010-05-14T04:20Z,"Hi Lizette,  It works best it you burn them to three separate DVDs so they would work just as if you had the original discs. If you must play them on your computer you can open the different chapters individually. They are the .vob files, I'm not sure about a mac but in windows they show as a preview icon, they play well in a VLC player. Or if you have a movie editor or something you can take only the video files and put them in order so they play one after the other but if you want the menu and chapters and everything it's best to just burn it to DVD. They you can play it anywhere.

They're all separated because that's how the video TS folder files are formatted on the DVD."
,marhia,2010-05-18T14:59Z,I'm trying figure out as well how to open them as well. I been searching all night 
,marhia,2010-05-18T17:06Z,Nevermind. I used DVDSanta and it works just fine. Thanks again

,frodolai,2010-06-19T00:23Z,I tried ImgBurn and it worked well. No error on VTS_14_1.VOB. Thanks for sharing.
,aniqueone,2010-06-23T22:28Z,hi i downloaded and burned this but the tummy tuck workout and the rapido workout is missing. did anyone else have this problem
,Kristaandthetots,2010-06-23T22:35Z,"This says spoken lauguage is English, just played it and it was in Spanish, I think?...."
,Kristaandthetots,2010-06-23T22:38Z,I also could not play the rapido..
,Alemada,2010-06-28T17:51Z,"If you downloaded the entire file the you shouldn't be missing any workouts, each disk has an audio and video TS file, already shrunk to fit a standard DVD, all you have to do is write the files to a DVD disk. I know ImgBurn works well (It's free) and someone said DVDSanta works as well. 

The DVD's are in english not spanish although there is an option for spanish on the DVD set up.

Try burning it again"
,naskaradok,2010-07-06T18:36Z,How exactly do i burn it. i tried earlier and just burned everything and it wouldnt show up on my dvd player. i have the dvdsanta but i still dont get it... sorry
,Alemada,2010-07-07T22:10Z,"I don't have DVD Santa but I do have imgburn (download it, it's free) When you open it, you have six options choose WRITE FILES TO DISK.  Browse for and select the file Brazil Butt Lift Disk 1( the file that contains the video TS and Audio TS files) the click the Burn button (it's the disk and green arrow on the bottom) then when it's finished repeat the same for the next two disks.  You should have 3 separate disks."
,BubblyMcAwesome,2010-07-18T20:48Z,"Almeda, I followed your directions but when it finished burning, the DVD wouldn't play.  I opened it on my computer and saw that it only burned as folders.  Is there a setting I need to change in ImgBurn?"
,Alemada,2010-07-20T04:06Z,It's suppose to burn like that..... have you tried putting it in your DVD player. When I put the disk in my computer it shows both files burned also and it opens automatically in the VLC media player. 
,SiSavage,2010-07-21T01:04Z,"Worked Perfectly...Used ImgBurn
Thanks Anonymous"

,aGoos2309,2010-10-08T22:30Z,"Used ImgBurn on a PC for DVD 1 and works, I'm playing DVD1 on my Mac right now. Thanks!"

,amusg,2011-03-22T02:39Z,Thank you so much! Discs 1 and 3 work great but for some reason I'm having problems burning the second disc. I used ImgBurn but it keeps failing....
,zedaglam,2011-04-06T06:53Z,"hey so i used imgburn, and when i tried to add the first dvd to the program, it opened the folder so I selected all the files in the folder..is that what I'm supposed to do? cause when i burned the dvd, my dvd player said that there are no audio files :(

,maximus_maximum,2011-04-21T02:13Z,Disc 1 is missing VTS_14_2.VOB....Discs 2 & 3 are fine.
,Gdlt_34,2011-06-15T10:18Z,"Works great but every video I open (ex. VTS_1, VTS 2, VTS 14) they all open the same CD, is that the way its suppose to be? Thanks for a great torrent though!"
,nazberry07,2011-09-21T00:26Z,"Hey guys I wanted to know if anyone could help me. I'm having a hard time downloading this as a torrent! And I wanted to know how are you guys doing it?
If anyone could help it would be GREATLY appreciated.
Thank you"
,itoorari,2011-10-19T18:37Z,"I used DVD Shrink to create the ISO for the discs. Disc 2 and 3 worked fine but it kept complaining about ""Can't find file VTS_14_2.VOB"". So I copied VTS_01_0.BUP to VTS_14_0.BUP, VTS_01_0.IFO to VTS_14_0.IFO and VTS_01_1.VOB to VTS_14_1.VOB. I was able to create the ISO with DVD Shrink. I burned all of my ISO's to DVD with Infrarecorder."
,itoorari,2011-10-19T18:39Z,"I want to clarify that disc 1 had the issues and required me to copy the IFO, BUP and VOB files to the VTS_14 set."
,FlameJanes,2012-02-11T01:09Z,"I tried to burn using Nero Express and get these error messasges:

Backup file 'VTS_13_0.BUP' should be identical to 'VTS_13_0.IFO'

Backup file 'VTS_14_0.BUP' should be identical to 'VTS_14_0.IFO'

What do I do now? :-("
,kgspin,2012-02-13T21:53Z,"I was able to extract Disc 1 and 2 and burn in the torrent list.  Did I miss something?  I did see a list of loose files, but when I tried to relocate them the following error appeared VIDEO-TS.BUP the system cannot find the path specified."
,kgspin,2012-02-13T21:55Z,"I was able to extract Disc 1 and 2 in the torrent list and then burn with imageburn. I did not see the files for Disc 3 in the torrent list.  Did I miss something?  I did see a list of loose files, but when I tried to relocate them the following error appeared VIDEO-TS.BUP the system cannot find the path specified."
,acheung,2012-03-25T03:50Z,"works great. thanks! some files don't work and extra informercials at the end of some segments. as the other user suggested, use VLC player."
,chameche,2012-05-09T09:24Z,"Before this I didn't have a program that could convert the TS files into a .iso image. I actually had to install a several freeware and ""freeware"" before I found one that made a file that would play. The one that I found and am keeping is CDBurnerXP. Its actually a pretty good program. You can use it to burn files to disc or create .iso files. Probably other stuff too. I would highly suggest using it if you don't have a program and don't already know where to get one like i did!"
