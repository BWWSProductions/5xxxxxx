This torrent contains all SOAD rare stuff such as Toxicity 2, Demo tapes 1, 2, 3, 4 and even the Untitled Demo tape, live song and covers. It also includes SOAD rare picture with the old drummer Ontronik "Andy" Khachaturian. And you have the mashup of DJ Lethal Rush song with a duration of 47 minutes with all SOAD hits. You have also the song A Wake Up Call. It's not a new song.It's just a mix of SOAD old song like Lonely Day, Aerials, Hypnotize, ATWA and other. You have also Serj Tankian bonus songs from his debut Elect The Dead and Scars on Broadway too. You have also Scars on Broadway demos which includes the rare demo of B.Y.O.B. and more. You have also the cover of the probably new SOAD album called Disease, but it's probably fake.
