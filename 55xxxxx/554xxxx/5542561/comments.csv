I hope they at least release the rest of the seasons on DVD. I'll buy 'em if they do."
[T],solstars,2010-05-08T04:58Z,Well... I almost have seasons 7 and 12 done.  Been catching them on Adult Swim and encoding them.  I'm ONE episode short on season 7 and I need about three more to finish 12.  I'll post them all here when done.

Apparently if you missed it on some random TV air date this is the ONLY mofo on in the entire internet, nay, WORLD who is bringing it to ya

The great ended to a great, unique, hilarious satire

To ""Hank Hill"" and the KOTH makers: thanks for 13 great seasons, 'I'll tell you what'"
