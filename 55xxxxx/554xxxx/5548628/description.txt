If you believe in the power and majesty of rock and roll, this is the DVD for you.  And if you don't, maybe this is the DVD to change your mind.

I've been trying to put up some of the best of my collection, and this one has to be right up near the top.  

It's a tad over 30 years since this truly historic performance.  This version was available on another tracker, and here it is for you.  

There are several versions of this show out there, but I personally prefer this Miles Hai restoration, with menus added.

The bad points - not the greatest image, and it breaks up sometimes, with an occasional minor synch issue.

The good points - well, it's Bruce on the Darkness tour, and many consider this to be his best show ever.  That should be enough to sway you.

Carve out 3 hours and watch it straight through. If this don't move you, well, maybe you cain't be moved.

Cover included.

Enjoy and share!
