1.) Are ALL the music videos included (have you verified this with airing lists)?
2.) Are the episodes all uncensored? If they are DVD rips or captures from later MTV airings, chances are they are heavily edited
3.) Are all the season specials included, i.e. Halloween, 2x X-mas, Thanksgivin (complete with videos)?

I'm just wondering how this compares to the KingTurd Collection which is, thus far, the Holy Grail for all B&B fans."
,ZeRaWaKH,2010-07-29T16:52Z,Really awesome man! RAR could've been in 4 GB parts though. FAT32 is still the FS to use for absolute compatibility.
,cyberjail,2011-08-20T17:44Z,Please seed. Seems people i upload to at pretty decent speeds give less than 5 KB/s in return. If any old seeds or seeds are reading please seed because i can seed when done at up to 900 KB /s and will for as long as i can 24/7 which should be at least a year
,cyberjail,2011-08-20T18:15Z,for example im uploading at 540 KB/s to a peer and hes not giving anything and hes about 5x as complete as me
,cyberjail,2011-08-24T10:21Z,"ill be done downloading in a day or 2 will continue to seed then. watch out alot of leechers on this torrent, like one guy whos 84 percent about 15 ahead of me and i uploaded 2 .5 gigs he only gave me 235 mb. wish the utorrent ipfilter worked when i entered ips but it didnt."

,jccl87,2011-11-24T15:33Z,"This torrent lacks for a few reasons:

1. IT'S EXTREMELY SLOW, IT TAKES FOREVER!!!!!

2. There are no music videos, (to me, the music video commentary was one of the funniest aspects of the show.) How can you call it an ultimate collection if you're missing about a third of the show? If you don't like the music videos that's cool, but that makes you not a true fan of the show.

3. It's in rar format. Not a big deal, easy to un-rar, but you can't download individual videos. You must dowload whole thing.

I will admit the videos are in good quality, but the King Turd collection videos are pretty much the same quality and they have music videos. Unlike what it says in the description, the King Turd Collection has all of the episodes. It also has a lot more extras (yes it has some dumb ones like the Cher duet, but if you don't want it just delete it)

I'm not telling you not to download this torrent, I'm just letting you know before you spend A LOT of time on this. Downloaded King Turd in 4 days, this one took 2 weeks. Might speed up in nearby future because of the comeback, but i still prefer the King Turd Collection.

This Collection - 7/10

Kingturd Collection - 9/10"
