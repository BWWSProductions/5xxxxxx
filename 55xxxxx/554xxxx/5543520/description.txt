St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold sees Annabel (Talulah Riley) promoted to Head Girl at St Trinian's in the absence of Kelly (Gemma Arterton), who now has a new and exciting career as a superspy. Annabel struggles to unite the warring cliques of Posh Totties (led by Tamsin Egerton as Chelsea), Emos (led by Montserrat Lombard's Zoe), Rude Girls (led by Zawe Ashton's Bianca), Geeks (led by Ella Smith's Lucy) and Eco-Warriors (led by Juno Temple's Celia) but when the evil, woman-hating Lord Pomfrey (David Tennant) stages a raid on the school looking for clues to a 400-year-old treasure, the girls realise that they'll have to work together if they're going to solve the mystery and beat him to it.
