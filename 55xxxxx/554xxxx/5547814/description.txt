Joselito
"The Little Nightingale", as he was widely known in Spain when he became a widely successful child star,had a very troubled childhood that led to an even more troubled life as an adult (guns and drugs) 
JosÃ© JimÃ©nez FernÃ¡ndez was born in Beas de Segura (JaÃ©n, AndalucÃ­a, Spain), on February 11, 1943,although some sources claim it was in 1947, due to false advertising by the studios that made his movies,and which wanted to make him appear younger than he really was (an obsession that haunted him through the
whole of his career), pretending he was 9 at the moment of his debut, when he actually was 13.

Nostalgia and Kleenex warning! 
The film is best suited for nostalgics that love singing childstars from the old millenium.

In this film the story is so simple that you do not need to know french or have subtitles. You can enjoy the little nightingale anyway.
Joselito plays an orphan a shrew treats badly.But he takes a job in a gypsies  small circus as a singer of course .Thus he will be able to travel across Spain and to find his mother.The only thing he 's got from her is a medal.Television will be a great help in his search.
Like in "Saeta del Ruisenor", there's a good fairy here too:an aristocrat ,a marquis ! 
A box of Kleenex is needed for the last third of the film.
