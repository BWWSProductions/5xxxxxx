,abhikrit,2010-05-09T09:57Z,"hello bro! 
until & unless you wont post some screenshots & sample...your torrents wont be seeded by people...!
the same goes for me personally.... came across your rip of Valentines Day but i have not started downloading as you have not provided any samples! hope you add some samples! good luck!"
,deadlyshadows,2010-05-10T22:31Z,"agree with abhikrit
I won't even start downloading because i do not know what i'm downloading.

I prefer H264 than Xvid, because it's smoother and have better quality with lower size than xvid.
movies encoded with xvid are a little noisy.
better encode using h264 and always provide a sample.thanks"
,yesbos,2010-05-15T15:56Z,"It wud nice in x264, but I always select xvid bcos of same reason (dvdplayer support).
I am also with abhikrit n deadlyshadows.
If u continue with xvid, u may have to be under 480p to maintain quality with size. So 720p will need more size, like rips from Vision,Flawl3ss.
