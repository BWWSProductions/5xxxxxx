Line audio bitches, this is how it's done. "

I know why they 'use' to do it, because most people wanted to be able to burn them to CD's and they would need to split the movie in order to do it, but does anyone even use CD's any more?

Still though, thanks for the upload.  I know you (the uploader) are just passing it along."
