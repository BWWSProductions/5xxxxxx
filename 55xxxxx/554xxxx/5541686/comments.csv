,j2good,2010-05-21T05:16Z,is this the same patch that was in the other torrent you have for Ableton Live Suite 8.1.1? 
,dimitrios,2010-06-24T06:54Z,"This is the same patch as in the full suite download, however, it does not work with Windows7 Starter. When Ableton opens a small box opens saying ""Please take a moment to authorize your software, if you're connected to the internet click here"". When I click ""Authorize later"" it opens the program but can't save nor export. Sucks. Any solution out there?"
,SNiPerXP,2010-09-27T16:23Z,"When I run the patch, I get an error message, ""Cannot find kcmouse.mfx"". I am running Windows Vista btw, so if anyone knows how to fix this error please post a comment. "

unpack AbletonLiveSuite8.1.1Patch.exe (i used winrar)
you should get three files: Authorizelive8.auz , Live.exe and LivePatch.exe
rename Live.exe to Live 8.1.1.exe and then copy it over the original file (for me it was in C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.1.1\Program)
open Authorizelive8.auz with ableton (right click it, choose open, choose ableton in list of programs)

Worked for me."
