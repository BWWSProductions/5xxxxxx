[V],twentyforty,2010-05-07T21:20Z,"I loaded Castle right now. I have one peer from Norway on 12, on 16. - none.

But - I see 2 seeds on 12 and 3 on 16..and that's ""normal"", my torrents dies of natural causes after 48h, week max. I cannot and I wont keep torrents alive for more than a month."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-07T21:32Z,"It sounded - wrong...
Better is to say ""I can't"". I have really slow upload speed and since Caste 12 or 16 I have upped more than two hundreds torrents.

Nevertheless, I'll keep these two loaded this night."
