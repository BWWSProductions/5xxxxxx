Cofused.."
,nice_big_guy,2010-05-09T17:22Z,"Very interesting! I use mTorrent and have no such problems.
What is the Vuze anyway?"
,typ050212,2010-05-09T17:37Z,Is this activated forever?
,nice_big_guy,2010-05-09T19:43Z,"Sincerely, I don't know for sure. But hope so.
Only installed this Office today. So far have no problems. "
,btboy,2010-05-09T19:48Z,Vuze is a down loading torrent site..
,psychogenesis,2010-05-09T20:10Z,"Snooping around after installation it says that product activation is required and that the product is unlicensed and to connect to the corporate network or contact your system administrator for further assistance.  However, I have not found any mention of a time limit for usage.  One thing which seemed interesting is that going through the online update feature no flags were raised though there weren't yet any updates to download of course."
,Desolator4u,2010-05-14T05:35Z,"@nice_big_guy where did u get this? 
@psychogenesis i have hadd another office 2010 for like 2 months with the same experience u described. it tells me its not activated, but i can simply skip that screen and use the offics apps with no problem.

When will the official RTM come out!? :("
