OX + Kid Lightning - IPX No.6 (2004)(2-EPs)


About OX:

OX | VANCOUVER & SUDBURY | CANADA

After extensive tours in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Holland and multiple sea-to-sea Canadian tours, Ox has finally been back in the studio for the long awaited follup session to the Canadian college chart topping Dust Bowl Revival. Wilted, broken, skeletal. In the tradition of the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa - Ox is the incarnation of deconstructed pop & vintage indie from the fertile sils of the Canadian heartland. A reflection of middle-america - where trash and beauty meet - a musical liquor store heist that will leave a distinct flavour of dust in your mouth. Studio weary fragments, fragile masterpieces, sonic accidents ... 'lo-fi' at its best.

This EP features features 4 new songs from Ox.

About Kid Lightning:

KID LIGHTNING | LOS ANGELES | USA

After years of churning out perfectly polished pop-rock for cult-heroes Gigilo Aunts, singer Dave Gibbs, aka: Kid Lightning, releases his debut CD, Her Smallest Breath Is Full Of Grace, a home-made sound track to a heart falling apart. Warts and all, he takes you through the 5 stages of grieving, then adds: 6) poking; 7) stalking; and finally, moving to a new city for good measure.

This EP includes 2 songs from the Kid's album, one of which is a hidden track Dave now wishes he hadn't hidden, plus two previously unreleased tracks.
