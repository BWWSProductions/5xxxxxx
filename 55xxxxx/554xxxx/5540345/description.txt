          Released in 1993, Psychoderelict is a rock opera conceived by Pete Townshend in 1991 
          as the follow-up to The Iron Man, but despite having recorded several demos, a       
          bicycle accident in September 1991 forced him to delay work on the album until his   
          wrist was able to heal properly. It is structured more like a radio play than the    
          more "traditional" rock operas Townshend had recorded both with The Who (Tommy,      
          Quadrophenia and the unreleased Lifehouse album) and as a solo artist (White City and
          The Iron Man).                                                                       
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            
                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
