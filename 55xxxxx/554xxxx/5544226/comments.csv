You just got your VIP-status back, try to keep it mate! 
The title should be: Law Abiding Citizen[2009]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG, not that shit. 
Sure, you can still understand what movie it is, but it does not describe the quality or who's the realese is. 

i think it's time that you lose that skull of yours and never get it back, just my opinion. 

About the movie then.
Great movie, Gerald Butler is excellent in the role and so is Jamie Foxx, you should definetly see this!
