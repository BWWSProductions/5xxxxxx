Hi,over the past few years I've been collecting the PILOT GUIDES/GLOBE TREKKER series of TV shows.Now I have a huge collection and I want to share with you.I didn't rip  these series, I only collect them from different sources.Big thanks to those who did do the ripping and capping.

Please visit this link:
http://www.pilotguides.com/tv_shows/globe_trekker/shows/series.php

and you will find very helpful Globe Trekker episodes list.Every episode has his originally place and number in this list.At this day list contains 13 series,each series contains 13 episodes.My goal is to present my collection BY SERIES.

And now HERE YOU ARE.SERIES 06 contains:



       06.01 Mainland Greece.avi
       06.02 Ireland.avi
       06.03 Deep South USA.avi
       06.04 Sri Lanka & The Maldives.avi
       06.05 Bolivia.avi
       06.06 Madagascar.avi
  *****01.08 Vietnam (Dual)(by Taquilla55)[Tusseries].avi******
       06.08 Micronesia.avi
       06.09 Cambodia.avi
       06.10 Eastern Caribbean.avi
       06.11 Russia:Moscow,St Petersburg & Murmansk.avi
       06.12 Short History of England.avi
       06.13 Southern Spain.avi

Note:I find that I replaced two episodes(01.08 and 06.07) with each other.
     I am so sorry for this mistake.

Note:The word (Dual) means that episode has two audio tracks-english and spanish.
