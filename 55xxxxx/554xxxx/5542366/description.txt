[NOTE] This torrent includes the Alex Jones video special uploaded today [and featured in hour 1 of today's show]: "Government Admits they Deal Heroin, Terrorize Families for Pot"
Alex puts into perspective the radical behavior of SWAT teams and other government enforcement agencies who recently raided and terrorized a family and killed two dogs in order to bust a man for one gram of marijuana.
At the same time, the CIA and other agencies of government have admittedly carried out narcotrafficking operations for decades. This is especially true in Afghanistan, where troops guard opium crops, and the fight against the Taliban is mired in drug trafficking.



Alex dissects yesterday's Dow stock market meltdown with trends forecaster Gerald Celente [hour 2] and regular guest Bob Chapman [hour 3]. Celente is the publisher of the Trends Journal  and is a business consultant and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events. Bob Chapman became a stockbroker in 1960 and retired in 1988. He publishes an economic and current events newsletter, The International Forecaster, twice weekly.

[Ted Anderson -- owner of GCN radio network -- is in-studio for several minutes in the 2nd half of hour 3, doing a "live commercial" for his gold business, Midas Resources]

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
