[T],Vazzt,2010-05-08T21:58Z,"@ worru

Sorry man but... are you fucking stupid?!

First of all your torrent is a really old release of Traktor. READ! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traktor

DJ Studio is an ""old younger brother"" to Scratch Pro . DJ Studio is from 2005, This version of Scratch Pro is from 2009.

Second of all. Why the fuck are you making promo for you stupid ass ice age torrents? Let the people choose from there self. the comments are from feedback!

Cheers
