,OGma59,2010-05-11T01:03Z,"hey, davidh27, u r a retard.  the intermittent black & white scenes are common for screeners.  they do it so pirated copies can't be sold (or so they think).  i have not seen ""fixes"" for this since ive been doing this - six years now.  just watch it, or wait for the R5.  Or do u kno what that is?"
