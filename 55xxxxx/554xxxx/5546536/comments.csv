,theonewithboringusername,2010-08-16T21:31Z,I'm going to check for viruses if there are seeders for this.
,theonewithboringusername,2010-08-17T21:52Z,"This is what I found: W32/Parite-B
Description:
Once W32/Parite-B has been executed, it will remain in memory, infecting every PE and SCR file on every drive and network share.

Keeping AS anyway, just deleting the virus."

And, you could just download it straight from the cracked steam. This torrent is useless. Sorry guys."
