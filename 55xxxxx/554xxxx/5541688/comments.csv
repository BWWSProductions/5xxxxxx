,jsmiths2,2011-05-26T03:09Z,Thanks! I've been looking for this.
,yoncenator,2011-07-04T04:49Z,I appreciate that 98% of this film is here in perfect condition.  I did scream when the climax of the film had a HUGE glitch that almost crashes my vlc player.  Wish it really was dvd quality.  It's mostly here but not quite.
,yoncenator,2011-07-04T06:18Z,I should say 3 HUGE glitches.
