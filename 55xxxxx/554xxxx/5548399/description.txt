Allows you to detect and remove HackerDefender Trojans and its clones

UnHackMe allows you to detect and remove a new generation of Trojan programs - invisible Trojans. UnHackMe is a very useful security
utility for your operating system.

They are called "rootkit" A rootkit is a collection of programs that a hacker uses to mask intrusion and obtain administrator-level
access to a computer or computer network.

The intruder installs a rootkit on a computer using a user action or by exploiting a known vulnerability or cracking a password. The
rootkit installs a backdoor giving the hacker a full control of the computer.

It hides their files, registry keys, and process names, and network connections from your eyes.

Your antivirus could not detect such programs because they use compression and encryption of its files.
