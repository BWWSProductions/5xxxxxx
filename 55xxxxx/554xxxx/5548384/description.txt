IMAGiNE NOTES
Well here you go with a new source video and audio wise......
Work done....well loads :P
Sharpness,contrast,rotating video,syncing, colour you name it......
Yes contrast is slightly off but if made any darker it would be too dark and any brighter would make glares alot stronger so .....

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
