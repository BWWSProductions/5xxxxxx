,Mr.Brow,2010-05-19T20:15Z,Thanks!
,antropophagus77,2010-05-22T02:02Z,Thanks for the post but this is THE worst freddy movie ever. They've outdone themselves with this piece of crap...I couldn't believe my eyes. I expected something at least as good as the original but nooooo...it had to suck. I won't spoil the movie so you can make your own decision but any true fan will be deceived. Don't waste your time and your bandwith...it's defenitively not worth it.
,bullyooo,2010-05-23T22:15Z,very good been waiting for this thanks
,epicfrog,2010-05-26T02:15Z,antropophagus77 has clearly never seen The Dream Master or The Dream Child. those are THE most terrible Freddy movies. maybe some of the worst movies ever made.
,wackaday,2010-05-30T01:37Z,"epicfrog has clearly never seen Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, because that movie makes The Dream Master and The Dream Child look like The Shawshank Redemption!"
,adrian639,2010-06-02T10:53Z,thans alot looks ok very watchable.
,Un1que2012,2010-06-21T06:12Z,Is it just me or is this Freddy more sinister? Somehow I enjoyed ths re than the original for plot
,angel12789,2010-07-28T01:40Z,great movie thanks man
