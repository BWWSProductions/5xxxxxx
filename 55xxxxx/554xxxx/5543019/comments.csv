I'll seed this to at least a 2:1 ratio.

Also... for those who don't own PS3's (like myself), but who DO own either a Panasonic or (regular) Sony (and a few other brands) Blu-Ray player... give this file a pass through multiAVCHD (Google it... it's free) and burn the BDMV folder to DVD with something like ImgBurn... then just play the disc as you would any standard BD."
