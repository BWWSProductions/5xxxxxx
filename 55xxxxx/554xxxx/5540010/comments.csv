If that's the case I'll reupload the torrent tomorrow with all well known trackers in the list."

I just found this on the interwebs myself so it's not my work.
I could imagine if you update it, the files you replaced could be overwritten. You could try to update but it's at own risk. Currently there isn't any update as far as I know."
,spifster,2010-05-26T09:27Z,"Idk if anyone else has had this problem, but I dont know what to do. When I start up sketchup, is asks  me this:

SketchUp wants to use your confidential information stored in ""Google SketchUp"" in your keychain.

The authenticity of ""SketchUp"" cannot be verified. Do you want to allow access to this item?

options: Always Allow /Deny/Allow

Im not sure how to take care of this problem, it pops up every time i open sketchup"
