PLOT
'A Brand New Life' is a co-production between South Korea and France.

1975. Jinhee is 9. Her father entrusts her to a convent of Catholic nuns that houses an orphanage for girls in the hope that she will be adopted. She cannot believe that this father whom she loves so much has abandoned her. She attempts to run away. In vain, she finally accepts her fate, forced to hope and wait for her possible adoption.

Jinheeâ€™s time at the orphanage will be one of multiple and permanent separations, of barely forged bonds destined to be shattered. And, at the journeyâ€™s end, there will be the promise, perhaps of a new life, of a brand new life.
