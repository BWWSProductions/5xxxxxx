,ocsalev,2010-05-13T00:52Z,"Nope. I was having trouble downloading your torrent since it got stuck. I had to download only the missing files from the original Zoo Tycoon in order to play the game... Then I found out that the most difficult expansion to download was Endangered Species, so I downloaded it from another Torrent Source and made it available here. "
