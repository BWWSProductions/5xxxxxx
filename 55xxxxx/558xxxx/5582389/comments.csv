My apologies to those of you who got off to a slow start with this torrent. This is a brand ney machine and I forgot to set up port forwarding on my router. Oops."
,blackwidowfarms,2010-05-24T06:30Z,"thanks KeMBro for all your hard work! I've taken the same set of files you have here and put them into an installer, and I've also removed anything that isn't part of the game from the Google HTML page... and I made the background black. To solve the sound issue permanently, I've made the game open up in a portable browser. I've also included Adobe Flash Player (installs silently, but does not install if the use has a newer version installed).
 I'll be cleaning it up a little more and trying to make the game take 100% screen width. Not as simple as it sounds lol!!! I've just uploaded it but it's not showing up yet. What the #$%$ is the tracker announce for this site? I may have the wrong one :(
