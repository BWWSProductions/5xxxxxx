Clean Of viruses.

Also a fast download which is nice but here is a tip:
When Utorrent slows down, stop the torrent for 5~10 seconds so all the seeders and peers disconnect then resume it. I have tested this a lot with my PC and it seems to work quite well. I think it works by reseting your position in the queue back to the top, which means faster downloads! :) "
