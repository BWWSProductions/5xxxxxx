Party Down is an American comedy television series created by John Enbom, Rob Thomas, Dan Etheridge, and Paul Rudd that airs on the Starz network in the United States and Super Channel in Canada. Party Down has been renewed for a 10-episode second season which will premiere April 23, 2010. The concept of Party Down was six years in the making, with many of the ideas for the episodes conceptualized years before the show was made. An original unaired pilot was shot at Rob Thomas's house with all the original cast with the exception of Lizzy Caplan, whose character was played by Andrea Savage. The pilot was used to sell the show to the Starz network. This half-hour comedy follows a Los Angeles, California, catering team for the titular company. The sextet of aspiring Hollywood actors and writers, as well as drifting lost souls, work small-time catering gigs while hoping for their break or some positive change in their lives. Each episode finds the team working a new event, and inevitably getting tangled up with the colorful, affluent guests and their absurd lives.
