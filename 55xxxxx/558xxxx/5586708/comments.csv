,THEADreaNaL,2010-05-24T16:56Z,"The last episode parts have been mislabeled. ""The End Part 1"" is actually ""The End Part 2"" and vice verse."
,THEADreaNaL,2010-05-24T16:57Z,"@ Hannibal
Yes"
,hannibal0,2010-05-24T17:02Z,Ok Thanks :-)
,agwywatx,2010-05-25T01:05Z,"Thank you.

Can you tell me which files those are? Because I need the subtitles to proper watch those episodes, but I need the name of the rip in order to find the correct sub."

,THEADreaNaL,2010-05-26T19:27Z,"You're welcome!
Thank you all for your support, and all those that keep on seeding..."
,imad81,2010-05-28T00:17Z,how come the file size is smaller than the standard 350Mb size? Is there any loss of quality in the rips? Sorry but i need to ask before i download this..thanx for the answers in advance..
,THEADreaNaL,2010-05-28T01:08Z,"Yes, the files are smaller than the standard 350MB group releases because they have been ripped at slightly lower bitrates. However, the quality remains still very watchable, and shouldn't take away from your viewing experience."
,Sawtell,2010-05-28T13:54Z,"Thanks so much!! 

:)"
,AceChev,2010-05-28T22:42Z,Thanks!

,xsilenciox,2010-05-31T18:50Z,"Woww THEADreaNal, what a fine job u did here!!
I usually don't place comments, but this is great, and very fast as well.
I will keep it on my computer for a while to seed untill like 5.0 :)
Keep up the very good work!!"
,THEADreaNaL,2010-05-31T22:57Z,"Thank YOU, it feels nice to be appreciated."
,freshbreathman,2010-06-02T13:01Z,"I downloaded both this 4.35 gb and the other 2.85 gb .mkv version.
I highly recommend the 2.85 gb .mkv version!

Not that this torrent isn't a quality upload, but the other torrent is smaller and even has some advantages!

The quality is surprisingly good! Of course it's not blu ray quality but it looked good enough on my PS3 + 50"" plasma.

Also, the episodes are labeled correctly and two nice bonus features (recaps and interviews) are also included.

As far as the actual content is regarded: without spoiling anything, the finale is really the most beautiful thing I have ever seen on TV."
,AdinaB,2010-06-02T14:40Z,"Thank you very much for all the time you put into this.
Will give you feedback as soon as I'm finished downloading, and of course , will seed.
Much appreciated.:)"
,Baronbl0d,2010-06-22T17:43Z,Sound quality much below standard i think. Video not too good either...
,Cavanger,2010-07-22T17:27Z,"The last episode numbers are wrong. Just watched the whole series in a couple of days and got screwed in the end. The end part 2 is actually the end part 1.

Somebody has probably already written this, but PB code is so fu**ed up that I can't see any comments. Just single letters."
,Deluge178,2010-08-08T20:36Z,"V-10, A-10. Excellent thanks"
,twinghost,2010-08-18T02:38Z,"thanks alot, i ended up watching the last one before the second to last one wondering what the hell was going on, so now ive seen the end and missed the part one, thanks, reallly, thanks."
,samstrosity,2010-08-18T18:47Z,"Thanks, I will stay on as long as I can!"
,JRiderG,2010-09-17T06:56Z,No doubt twinghost the whole last 2 episodes really messed me up. I was like wtf is going on.
,Adventia,2010-09-21T10:27Z,"Well i'm sure if you would have read the comments before going of on a tirade against the author you would notice that it says ""The last episode parts have been mislabeled. ""The End Part 1"" is actually ""The End Part 2"" and vice verse.""

Learn to read!"
,theneonraindrop,2010-10-14T02:02Z,"good quality for the size, a9 v8"
,mayhemrules,2010-11-18T05:50Z,"Video quality is subpar but i appreciate the work, since a compilation takes time.

Thanks"
,the.subz,2010-11-25T16:14Z,"awesome thank you!
downloading and will seed :)"
,sortalv,2011-02-24T08:19Z,"well Adventia. i also saw the whole thing and got 2nd episode first and i thought it was just a final ""fuck you"" from the makers. as they have messed with our minds for 6 seasons now. And i do understand how many others also could have miss watched it as if its good with seeds am not in the habbit of reading the comments before i watch my downloads. isnt there some way for the the uploader to maybe relable them or wil that ruin the torrent?"
,Gigakos,2011-04-12T14:52Z,AAAAAA MAN I CANT BELEIEVE IT I CRIED LIKE A BABY AT THE LAST EPISODE :( !!!!
,scotho,2011-07-18T02:29Z,you completly ruined the end of that whole show with ur stupidity u fukin waster
,Zhamnov37,2012-01-06T06:21Z,"I'm going to upload The Sixth Sense with the ending at the beginning just for you ""THEADreaNaL"".

An extreme example, but c'mon man.  I waded through 6 seasons of average TV only to have the ending spoiled.

Thanks for the effort.  Better luck next time."
,kfstevens2003,2012-06-10T02:13Z,the ending was lame anyway. i hate it when the ending ends up being a dream or you died. so predictable. Yes they all die okay. i gave it away too.
