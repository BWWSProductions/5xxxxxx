Menomena - Mines (2010)


***ADVANCE***


Original release date: July 27th on Barsuk Records (and in Europe July 26th on City Slang)

Menomena (pronounced /mÉ¨ËˆnÉ’mÉ¨nÉ™/) is an indie rock band from Portland, Oregon, United States, made up of Brent Knopf, Justin Harris, and Danny Seim. All members of the band share singing duties and frequently swap instruments while recording.




Menomena began as a side project of Seim's solo project Lackthereof.

The band formed in late 2000, when Knopf graduated from Dartmouth College and returned to Portland to collaborate with Harris and Seim.

The name "Menomena" was chosen for "the way it rolls off the tongue, sexually, or something" and has no specific meaning, although it is often assumed to refer to the Piero Umiliani song "Mah NÃ  Mah NÃ ", a staple of The Muppet Show. In an audio clip from SpotDJ, Knopf sarcastically stated that the band name was a portmanteau of the words "Men" and "Phenomena".[citation needed]

Menomena played their first show in July 2001, at The Meow Meow, a now-defunct all ages venue in Portland. The trio opened with a cover version of "The Abandoned Hospital Ship" by The Flaming Lips.
