IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scan results of OAF TrialReset v2.5A.exe:
*************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security identifies OAF TrialReset v2.5A as a threat:
   - Risk name: Trojan.ADH  	
   - Risk type: Virus  

2- avast! Pro Antivirus: Clean.

4- Avira identifies OAF TrialReset v2.5A as a threat:
   - Risk name: TR/Agent.720371 	
   - Risk type: Trojan

3- Kaspersky Antivirus: Clean. 


The av scan results are from May 22, 2010. 

The av scan results of Norton and Avira are false positives due to some used 
binaries and cryptors (or maybe OAF TR v2.5A is added to their virus database).
So just stay cool or don't use this!!!

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!



<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
> Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! <

         Online Armor Premium/Personal Firewall 4.0.0.44 + TrialReset v2.5         



If you use online banking, buy things online, send and receive emails or just 
browse the internet then you're open to serious threats that your Antivirus 
Software just wasn't designed to stop. That's where Online Armor's Personal 
Firewall comes in.

Online Armor personal firewall protects your computer's internet connection 
(inbound connections and outbound connections), stops unknown programs from 
running and detects keyloggers, etc.

Online Armor is a full security system for your computer, offering 100% leak 
protection right out of the box.


Adjust the firewall settings precisely to your liking:

In standard mode most decisions are made completely automatically based on Online
Armor's whitelist - meaning that you never need answer a complex firewall prompt 
again.


Advanced mode, and additional options for power users are present.

Import blacklists from Bluetak directly into the firewall and apply them against 
rules. This allows protection of P2P programs or web browsers, without applying 
these lists against every connection. Filter web pages that you visit to remove 
potentially dangerous content.

If you perform transations online, Online Armor's banking mode protects you by 
only allowing you to go to legitimate bank websites.

Online Armor also provides powerful protection against keystroke records and even 
filters your email messages to weed out banking scams.

You can also use this feature to block countries or networks known to host malware,
zombies or other dangerous content.

If you want to limit the connectivity of your computer to known systems (for 
example, VNC to your home computer from the office network only) you can restrict
it in Online Armor easily. You can also restrict connections by country ("Don't 
allow connections to this country") or, alternatively, only open up certain 
countries ("Only allow my browser to connect to sites in the USA or Australia").

Online Armor includes powerful "HIPS" functions, which give you the ability to 
stop all unrecognised programs from running on your computer unless you say so, 
making it possible to protect yourself against these new attacks.

Programs Online Armor knows are safe will be allowed to run, no problem.

This is different to a pure Antivirus program - these let any program run, unless 
they know it is a virus. This means that it must have that that exact threat in 
its database before it can do anything about it. Your antivirus will completely 
ignore programs it does not recognise - which unfortunately includes new viruses.

Overview Online Armor premium protection. 

Easy to use
You do not need a computer science degree to use Online Armor. The setup process 
is straightforward, and configuration is a one-time event and part of the initial 
installation process.

Light on Pop-ups
Online Armor's aim is not to annoy you with too many messages and when it does 
give you a message, there are clear options given on how to respond. 

Doesn't slow down your PC
Online Armor does not slow down your PC. 

Personal Firewall
Online Armor's new personal firewall provides awesome protection from inbound 
threats and complete control of data leaving your computer for the internet. 

Online Banking Protection
Never worry about banking online again. Online Armor's Banking mode is a standout 
feature that locks down your session while you are doing your banking online.

Identity Theft Protection
Probably the number one threat online; identity theft ruins lives. Online Armor 
protects you from phishing and keylogging techniques that these criminals use. 

Safe Browsing
This allows you to lock down your online browsing sessions and protect yourself 
from malicious websites installing nasties on your machine. 

Prevent Spyware
Program Guard gives you control over which programs are allowed to run on your 
computer. Known safe programs don't harass you with popups, and dangerous 
programs will give a red warning popup so you can prevent them from running. 

Remove Spyware
If spyware gets onto your computer - perhaps because you have accidentally 
allowed it, Online Armor will allow you to remove it. Unwanted extensions to 
Internet Explorer can be removed with a mouse-click. Unwanted programs can be 
blocked via Program Guard, or removed completely. 

DNS Checker
This stops programs from manipulating your Windows settings to misdirect you to 
fake sites. 

Hosts Checker
Similar to the DNS Check, Online Armor checks your HOSTS file and alerts you if 
anything changes. The hosts file can also be used to make your web browser visit 
sites other than the one you intended. 

Autoruns Management
Allows you to control which programs start automatically with your computer. 
This can be used to help defeat spyware (it must start sometime) as well as 
optimize your computer's performance. 

Tamper Protection
Malicious programs are getting tougher and tougher and often attack other 
programs (including security programs) to do their nasty deeds. Online Armor's 
Program Guard guards not only itself against tampering, but protection other 
programs from malicious code. 

Keylogger Detection
Online Armor protects your passwords and private information from being stolen 
by blocking the keylogger as it tries to activate. Online Armor's behaviour 
detection ensures that even specially created or new keyloggers are detected 
and prevented. 

Mail Shield
"Phishing" is the name of a scam which uses fake emails and websites to trick 
users into disclosing personal information. Online Armor checks inbound mail 
for tricks used by scammers and, depending on the certainty it will warn you 
or remove the email. The mail filter works with any email client that supports 
POP3 or IMAP, including Outlook, Outlook Express, Thunderbird, The Bat!, 
Incredimail, Eudora and others. 

Web Shield
Many websites use tricks to install dangerous software on your computer. 
The type of software can range from the irritating display of popup advertising, 
through to software designed to steal information or defraud you.

The domain used by Online Armor changed from tallemu.com to online-armor.com.

There is LIMITED Windows 7 x64 support. What this means is that the core x64 
support is in place, but some features do not work. We do not consider the x64 
version of Online Armor release ready, but as a result of user requests, we're 
making it possible to install Online Armor (paid versions only) on Windows 64 
with this release.

However, to prevent a situation where a user un-knowingly installs Online Armor 
on an x64 machine and incorrectly assumes full protection, the installer program 
needs to be run with of a command line parameter â€“ consider this as 'informed 
consent'.

Therefore, to get Online Armor Premium or Online Armor ++ installed on 
a Windows 7 x64 machine, add the command line parameter "/dragonslayer" 
when running the installer.

Online Armor currently runs on XP/Vista/Windows 7. This program is not suitable 
for Windows Vista 64. However, check the compatibility section to see if there 
are any conflicts with other software you may be running.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
