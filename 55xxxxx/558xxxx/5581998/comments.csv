Maybe Dibya now will also repost our torrents at TPB, which gives him more work. I really don't understand why people would like too work more anyway ............   "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-23T23:33Z,"@Rebellian_ 

Of course a firewall can be combined with an antivirus program, cause a firewall is just a part of pc protection. For more info about av software see my previous post, but the decision is yours of course."

any comments mate"
,narfdude,2010-05-25T12:27Z,"thanks for another great trial reset rh
I got one problem though, according to this:

http://support.tallemu.com/vbforum/showthread.php?t=12585 

you can install it on 64 bit windows using the ""dragonslayer"" switch. But the trial reset wont work on a 64 bit system. So, just wondering when a new one will come out. i got 29 days though, so no hurry
thanks in advance

@arulkarthik
you dont have to launch it everytime. it autostarts with windows"

[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-07T21:45Z,"@Mixalos7 

Maybe the trial resetter does work for a newer version, but don't update the program version through the program itself. "

,cssmalli,2010-12-16T19:26Z,this has some trojan but i think it is False positive.. thx for this
,ROYALSPIN,2011-03-26T07:17Z,"DL-d this and immediately Avira smacked it into the quarantine box.I would really love to be able to use this product but even a false positive is still a positive.I did some investigating on this virus found and the results are not that good at all.Ive had viruses slip past Avast ,AVG and Kaspersky  before which is why Im using Avira now.

Im just wondering if anyone has dug deeper to see if this is in fact the actual virus or to ask have they checked to see if the OS has been modified as described in this short description Im attaching .Im assuming that OLA should be able to catch a key logger which is one activity
this virus does amongst a few others.Anyways feedback would be good not just for myself but for all.Here is the description for Trojan. ADH

""""""Trojan.ADH exploit Aliases:

    * Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.bhpj (Kaspersky)
    * Win32/Soglueda.A (Microsoft)
    * Trojan.ADH (Symantec)

Trojan.ADH is a worm that replaces an existing Windows system file named services.exe with a copy of itself. Trojan.ADH spreads to other computers by copying itself to removable drives. The worm also installs a key logger that captures user-entered keystrokes and sends the data to a remote server.

When executed, Trojan.ADH copies itself to \services.exe, replacing the existing Windows system file. The worm also drops a copy of itself as .cmd into the Windows system folder.

The presence of the following files may indicate presence of this malware:"
