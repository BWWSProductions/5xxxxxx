,naraku00,2010-06-11T20:22Z,Can you backup partition to DVDr with this ? If so then that'll be perfect I just don't want to waste a dvdr for a 80mb program.

It's just a demo!

You can boot the media and try everything, but you can't start the backup process itself. The last OK-Button just replies ""it's a demo. buy the real thing."""
