Video: I'm no good at rating video, but it's about average quality for the 700 meg range avi's, and so good. I saw no problems.

Audio: The audio impressed me actually. A lot of the 700 ones I found I had to keep the volume maxed out to hear anything. I was able to keep it at a lower volume for this one without problem.

I don't normally do reviews, but I thought I should point out that the quality isn't bad. The movie itself is a matter of taste, though I thought it was sweet myself."
