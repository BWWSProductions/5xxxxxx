From Wikipedia:
Doodle Jump is an action game developed and published by Lima Sky for iPhone OS and Android. It was released worldwide for iPhone OS on April 6, 2009, and was later released for Android on March 2, 2010.

The game has been relatively well-received. On March 9, 2010 it was announced that the game had totaled over 3 million sales. It has been reported of having 28,000 downloads per day. The game publishers expect 4 million downloads by the end of April.

Gameplay consists of guiding a four-legged creature known as the "Doodler" up an unending series of platforms without falling in an attempt to gain a high score. The character is controlled by tilting the gaming device in the desired direction. In the BlackBerry version, direction of the Doodler is determined by tapping in the desired direction.

Install:
Just copy the apk file onto your phone and use the standard android installer
