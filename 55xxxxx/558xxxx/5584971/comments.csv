,svadilfari,2010-05-24T10:49Z,"terrible omg hands down awful i dont know why im still watching this shit...not 1 single joke the entire episode, theyÂ´ve long passed the point where the simpsons couldÂ´ve gone off air in dignity"
,scatattack,2010-05-24T11:30Z,"ref svadilfari. 
So true svadilfari, I still find myself watching his balls of a show hoping to find something like the old episodes, but it's all tits up American cheese. I guess they're playing it safe now adays since it's released practically all over the whole world/ not affend anybody, it's all about money at the end of the day. That's why I find myself watching less and less of this tripe each week. They're will (soon) be a day when I never watch this shit again and forget that it was once good. scatattack out, peace my niggers and bitches"

,AylaMM,2010-05-25T16:14Z,"Haha wtf at the comments... I've thought that the The Simpsons episodes lately have been brilliant! Haven't seen this one yet but I've really liked the latest ones? 
Then again I was quite young when I first saw The Simpsons and thought they were, well, scary. 
Even seeing the episodes as a grown-up still makes me think ""IT'S SO PSYCHEDELIC! NO WONDER I GOT SO ANXIOUS OVER SEEING THIS AS A KID! IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY!"" 
So I don't see how that was better... o_O "

,scatattack,2010-05-26T02:44Z,"Ref to aylaMM. 
There's something up with aylaMM, I find him suspect to say the least i.e as in he probably works as part of the creaters of something in that respect for The Simpsons, because if you're trying/ you actually are saying that nowadays simpsons is better than the old..... Well I guess I'd rather believe that you're working for The Simpson, because if you're not, then you generally are a a tard....."
,NewfieJason,2010-05-30T04:48Z,"Its a fucking cartoon you retards, shut up and watch it or shut the fuck up and don't......thx 4 up as always I will seed"
