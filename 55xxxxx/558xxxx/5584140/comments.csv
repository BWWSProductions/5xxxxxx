,WolfParty,2012-04-24T05:13Z,"This movie is HILARIOUS! And the quality is perfect. It's split into two avi files with the subtitles embeded into the film. For some reason, the audio for me didn't work in windows media, but played perfectly using VLC.

I'f you're a fan of college humor like the american pie movies, you will definatly appreciate this. It also stars the gorgeous Ha Ji-won from '100 Days with Mr. Arrogant'. Remember to seed and enjoy!

Thanks again mizurin!"
