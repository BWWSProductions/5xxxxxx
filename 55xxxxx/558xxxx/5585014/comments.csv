[T],minifrepper,2010-05-24T22:30Z,I was only joking ;) Sorry
,william999,2010-05-25T02:25Z,"@coolmanuk ---Well im no bloody joking ,,these copys are crappp all of them.Same quality ul'd every time ,,Why upload a torrent with the same flaws as all the 1ns b4 it,its stupid....U/Loaders ,if youve not got anything better just leave it till you do..!!!!!!!!!!!"
,balander10,2010-05-25T03:27Z,"The guys even say its not of great quality on the comments about the movie why so bad?

Cut them some slack they waste time out of their life's to offer those on the rest without receiving anything while me and you and most of the other ones who visit just enjoy other peoples work. 

Good torrents will come when they have access to appropriate resources. Just have some patience. "
,ExhamPriory,2010-05-25T04:34Z,"Many good points people. I can see how disheartening it would be to take the risk of filming these cams (not taking into consideration that these people not only PAID to get into the theatre with their own coin, but probably don't really get to enjoy the film they paid for because they are handling the filming of it and dealing with the stress of getting caught) then transcoding and posting them, just to find out their efforts pissed more people off then made them happy.     And on the other hand it IS too bad that despite the effort some can barely match other poor quality copies.. I figure it is best to be honest when rating the torrents, but it is also necessary to be grateful to the uploaders in almost ANY instance just for the risk they take and their obvious need to contribute and not just download and larp about DLs like most users (myself included).
 So thanx all uploaders for not only letting me get to see these movies early, but at the very least, making it so I never have to pay for ANY movie!  :)"

,michaelrwatson,2010-05-27T22:31Z,"Yeah, i too appreciate the efforts of cammers, but this isn't 2002 anymore. This video is hideously bad-- Terrible rolling flicker/brightness variations throughout. If for some inconceivable reason you are utterly desperate to see this movie, go ahead and ruin it.  Otherwise WAIT.

Cammers should just write toss crap like this instead of uploading it. Write it off as a learning experience and do better next time. "
,LTGENRED,2010-05-28T02:43Z,i dont know why we havent got a decent copy yet its been long enough
