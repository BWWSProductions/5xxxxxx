,avist,2010-05-24T20:15Z,Is this different from the recap that showed before ep1? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5326281/Lost.S06E00.HDTV.XviD-NoTV-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D
,Seth01,2010-05-25T01:40Z,"^^ 
I was wondering the same thing.  I think it must be as it just has been released.  What I'm wondering is this to be watched before ep. 17 & 18 or after?

Thanks for this and any answers."
[V],AiTB,2010-05-25T04:53Z,"it's different, now includes season 6
watch before 17"
