KING DIAMOND THEM AND CONSPIRACY ALBUMS WITH LYRIC'S AND ALBUM COVERS.zip

Widely regarded as the finest vocalist in all of death metal (who possesses a multi-octave range), theatrical rocker King Diamond first rose to prominence as a member of Mercyful Fate, before launching a solo career on his own. 
The group's original lineup included such former Mercyful Fate bandmates as Hansen and Denner, but over time, bandmembers would come and go (the only constant member besides their leader has been guitarist Andy LaRocque). King Diamond's first three solo releases, 1986's Fatal Portrait, 1987's Abigail, and 1988's Them, are widely considered to be Diamond's finest, as the singer continued to issue further releases until the early '90s (1989's Conspiracy, 1990's The Eye).

THIS TORRENT HAS ONLY THE 
"THEM" AND "CONSPIRACY" ALBUMS BUT I HAVE ADDED THE LYRICS AS AN ADDED BONUS IN WORD FORMAT.
