"You're the Best Man, Cleveland Brown"

Much to his dismay, Cleveland finds out that Cleveland 
Jr. will inherit all of his ex-wife's belongings and 
that his parents, Cookie (guest voice Francis Callier) 
and Freight Train (guest voice Craig Robinson), plan 
to remarry. To add insult to injury, Freight Train 
dumps Cleveland as his best man in favor of Donna's 
ex-husband, Robert (guest voice Corey Holcomb.)

Enjoy :)
