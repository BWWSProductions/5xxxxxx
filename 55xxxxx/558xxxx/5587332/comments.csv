,FAHQUES,2010-05-25T05:16Z,question ? am i missing something ?  the app keeps crashing. i looked for included text files & there's none of any importance that I saw. what up ?
,elect86,2010-05-25T13:18Z,"Regarding my experience, i didnt see any crash, but only a big slowness.

Remember it is a beta ;)

Ps: what are u running?

Mine was Snow 64 bit"
,FAHQUES,2010-05-25T17:03Z,"Im running on a X86 build of a leopard. its a 32bit though, would that be a possible cause of ot crashing ? I wasn't aware that the app was for 64bit systems only.
 I downloaded it & did get it open but as soon as it did, a crash log screen came up & listed a bunch of files it created to send with a crash report. I obviously didnt send it. I snagged maya 2011 3d software earlier yesterday, might that have something to do with it ?"

,seeker7,2010-06-01T18:01Z,Can somebody give me Serial Number and Product key?
,rogiirarom,2010-07-05T02:34Z,"It doesn't work. The serial number and product key were already used. It can be used juste once, then, the key product and serial number are no longer valid. Your torrent is a bullshit."
,nrth_orfn,2010-07-06T16:36Z,"push the trial button, worked for me.
If someone got a working beta 2 plz upload."
,zork78,2010-08-15T21:11Z,"try this: sn: 666-42943644, product key: 001C1. This is for the beta 1 version."
,rubengarciajr,2010-08-29T05:27Z,"zork>

,pstefanis,2010-08-30T17:02Z,">Zork78
Did the sn: 666-42943644, product key: 001C1 work for your mac? If I use these serials the installation goes on, but after installation when i try to load the program I get the following message ""evaluation period has expired"". Can you help?"

the app is probably crashing on your macbook air because it's a MACBOOK AIR. The highest possible processor in that thing is 2.13GHz. Check your computer's stats against the system requirements. http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&id=15435044

NOBODY should be running a program like autocad on a computer like a macbook air. It's like asking a baby to carry an elephant on its back."
