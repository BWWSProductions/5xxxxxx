,redrum455,2010-09-15T06:24Z,"Awesome footage, great video.
Worth downloading.

I'm seeding. Footage like this need to be shared with everyone so that the next generation will know what once happened may years ago, and so that it may never repeat. "

,Crillie,2010-12-18T20:17Z,Dont bother downloading unless youre american. Biggest pile of propaganda Ive ever seen. Not a second goes by without someone raising the US flag.
,Maggen66,2010-12-19T23:26Z,"Undoubtably a good series, but VERY american-oriantated."

Maybe it was made by Americans for Americans. Unless your were there, you have no clue. I live in Germany but was born and lived in America for 40 years and what I have seen as far as Docs. go whether German or USA made, are really close and the over all opinion of Germans is also close to the American point of view. If you don't like it, don't watch it but keep negative comments to yourself in regards to a great upload here."
,majinbuxl,2011-03-29T04:48Z,"I watched a couple episodes here and there on TV and never really thought much of it then. Afterwards, I decided to torrent it and see the entire series on my PC for the heck of it. Wow I'm glad I did. You need to download this and listen to it with good quality speakers or headset. The footage and sound alone are amazing, it feels like you're there. It's really captivating.

@Crillie
It makes me sad that you say such things. The documentary, as it rightfully should be, was made by Americans, for Americans, to honor the Americans that served and died during those terrible years. You owe it to them as much as you owe the other soldiers around the World that fought and died for freedom. American propaganda has nothing to do with this and I hope you one day realize your immaturity. "
,nole101,2011-04-01T19:21Z,"Got the first episode down and the quality is very good. However we dont have enough seeders here my share ratio is almost 1.5 and I only have a 1/3 down total. Please seed guys, thank you GoodFilms!"

Before you go judging others, perhaps you should brush up on your history.  The americans didn't join the war until it was almost over.  They sat back biding their time and waiting.  Then when everyone else was running out of men, money and resources they jumped in for the killing blow and took all the credit.  In sports that's called cherry-picking.  The US doesn't deserve half the credit they give themselves."
,poppy20,2011-06-09T21:47Z,"Thanks so much for this, really looking forward to watching it.

My ISP is gonna kill me though :)"
,cheborneck,2011-09-18T01:09Z,"@BuckNaked69 As an American, your comment is treasonous. You must be Republican! And your knowledge of history sucks! Dick!!!"
,xieschan,2011-09-22T10:54Z,@BuckNaked69 you are right. Don't bother about the rest of them. Patriotism is a way to control and keep these mindless creatures inline. The fact remains the fact that World War II was actually fought between Germany and Russia. UK & Americans joined just to make sure that Russian doesn't take away the whole Europe.
,ultimatehuman,2012-01-26T06:36Z,"After reading comments criticizing an American program for an American tv audience, for focusing on the American point of view, it makes me wonder why America bothered with the European Theatre at all?  I've watched plenty of BBC programs and didn't think twice about their bias towards the British view of the war."

Troll harder faggot"
,Theambassador,2012-03-29T11:35Z,"Just to add my own little note here... The U.S. ended the war. You European fools started it, we finished it. So STFU or GTFO.
