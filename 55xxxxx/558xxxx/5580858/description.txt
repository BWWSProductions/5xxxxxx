Not long after Betsy Garth got married and left 
Shiloh for good, this important episode introduced 
Jennifer Sommers, played by a lovely but long forgotten 
actress named Diane Roter.  Diane was seen in the 
4th Season credits for several episodes until making 
her first appearance in this story.

Jennifer was Judge Garth's niece, who travels west to 
Wyoming to live with him after the death of her mother 
(the judge's sister).

James MacArthur is the only noteable guest star, 
although stuntman and occasional character actor 
Hal Needman is also in this episode. Hal continued 
to do and coordinate stunts for many years, and he 
also directed the first 2 Smokey and the Bandit films, 
Cannonball Run, and other Burt Reynolds movies 
in the 1970s and 80s.
