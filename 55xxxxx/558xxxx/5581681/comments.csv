,gamer2010,2010-05-22T23:17Z,what s wrong with the instal language where can i get 767 expansion package ??
,Muckypup9,2010-05-22T23:26Z,"In my opinion, nothing wrong with it. It were cyrill letters originally , but just click on left-middle-middle button and  everything will all right. :)"
,gamer2010,2010-05-22T23:29Z,too bad it needs serial for updates anyway thank you wery much for this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Muckypup9,2010-05-22T23:32Z,"Offcoz, this is not the updated or the expansion version and contains not the expansions pack, but fly like a charm and seems more better like nothing. :)"

,VEIVE,2010-05-23T17:09Z,"when i install it i dont see it in the game, it just dont show up wtf.. i install it in the normal fsx folder as the rest but this ting.. not showing up "
,Muckypup9,2010-05-23T17:15Z,"Be calm, if you have installed the right FSX folder, the plane is there. Only try to find lower than other Boeings, cos it's a CLS. :) Scroll down, and you'll find it :)"
,VEIVE,2010-05-23T18:17Z,"it works fine now yes, it got installed in a different folder in the fsx folder =) but it's nice now hehe"
,Carlospilot,2010-05-23T20:34Z,Great upload Muckypup9!! do you know where we can find the FS9 version??ThanksThanks
,Muckypup9,2010-05-23T21:37Z,"Thx Carlospilot,  I have only this FSX version only and I have not found the FS9 version as yet.. "
,Jimstalk,2010-05-23T22:20Z,sRRY DUDE but AP doesnt work correctly the overhead isnt clickable and in order to takeoff you have to set trim&pitch at 14.00 (normally should be 0.02
,Muckypup9,2010-05-23T23:17Z,"I'm sorry that you have trouble with the plane. Unfortunately I can't help you, because on my pc everythig works prefectly. The overhead fully clickable 2D or VC mode too, nothing toruble with autopilot and trim. I dont know what happened at your pc. Try reinstall perhaps, but if the plane stay wrong, please tell me, and I will delete this torrent and I apologize.   Guys, please leave some feedbacks, that have troubles or not with this bird.  "
,raclim1,2010-05-23T23:57Z,"Nice upload, but for somekind of reason the plane can't go up??? i can stear en turn the nose down, but i can't turn it up:(  Any idea's?"
,Muckypup9,2010-05-24T00:18Z,I fly with this crap now and everythings OK. I don't understand this troubles.... :s
,VEIVE,2010-05-24T14:13Z,"What is b-10 and how do you set that?

overhead panel and all works fine here, only thing is the trim, which is the best trim setting for it ? i tryd some and it all gets to sensitive..  
"
,Muckypup9,2010-05-24T14:24Z,"Not b-10, set the trim between 8-10 degrees. :)"
,VEIVE,2010-05-24T17:20Z,"8-10 is way to much, the plane takes off it self at 110 kts, i put it on 4 and thats good, above 4 the plane gets very light "
,Muckypup9,2010-05-24T18:19Z,"When I fly this bird  I set the trim between 4-5 degrees and seems perfect to me. But others says, the plane can't go up with right trim settings. On my pc this plane works like a charm, the cockpits fully clickables, autopilot works perfectly, the takeoff and any other goes without any troubles....
I run Win7x64, and FSXsp2...."
,737300,2010-05-24T18:54Z,"I have FSX+Acceleration and all works perfectly, bit of a frame rate killer. I prefer Captain Sim 767 but thanks for the upload.:-)"
,glasswings21,2010-05-25T00:00Z,Very nice addon indeed! ....but i believe the Captain Sim version is more perfected and a slight better choice over this one....and still i guess not a bad addon....thanks for the upload!
,Muckypup9,2010-05-25T00:22Z,"I agree with you guys, that the CLS 767 not perfect and the CS 767 more better maybe, but I have not  found that plane with working crack till now.  I have CS767 rip, but it's a crap, the gauges not working and the plane not flyable.  Although I have full working Level-D767, and FS2Crew 767 addon what is the best  B767 on my mind, but it is accessible here on TPB already. "
