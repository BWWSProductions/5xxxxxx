Rare Stephen King's THE MIST Black & White Director's Original Vision. Apparently what director frank darabont initially wanted to release, but studio would not go for a black and white 'B' movie, he shot on a colour process and lit the film in such a way that would allow for post conversion to black and white. feels like a very different movie and definitely one for completists.

Encoded 'anamorphic strict' to preserve full resolution.
