,Raukan,2010-05-23T21:47Z,Is there any more differences from the theatrical version than the obvious? Any extended or exluded scenes or something?
,DILLINJAY,2010-05-23T22:28Z,"yes but it's about 24 minutes longer, new scenes, extended scenes, and a very different ending."
,DILLINJAY,2010-05-23T22:47Z,"sorry, bugger. thought this was bout the abyss extended torrent. no it's exactly the same film, but in black and white, but as i understand it, not the same as just turning on black and white for a colour movie but the movie was reprocessed specifically for a black and white master. some will say so what and could be right but i personally enjoyed watching it much more like this with all the lights out, a homage to B movie horror flicks of the 40s and 50s. personal taste really."
,mc_homes,2010-06-15T05:59Z,"thanks to the 1 seeder, but can anyone else please seed?"
,kookoobird,2010-06-15T22:39Z,"While this is a nice upload, it's hardly a ""rare"" edition... "
,lazurust,2010-06-18T12:01Z,"KooKoobird, don't be a dick"
,DILLINJAY,2010-07-01T03:50Z,"buddy.. not a rare film maybe.. but a rare torrent. in fact the ONLY torrent of the B&W version. or you could just pay for the much less rare DVD  :o)

as the previous poster rightly says ""don't be a dick""."
,DILLINJAY,2010-07-01T03:55Z,"you really did hurt my feelings, so i shall defend myself even further. my abyss special edition R5 anamorphic rip is not only rare but unique. i'm the only person to obtain the chinese dvd and upload a rip.. so please show a brother some love kookoobird, we can't all ne axxos.."
,funkysexpotato,2010-10-03T14:24Z,"Thanks so much for this! It is the only torrent available for the B&W version which for my money is much better than the colour. I'll seed as much as possible....
A/V 10/10
Thanks again!"
,funkysexpotato,2010-10-03T15:47Z,"Hang on. I have to take that back, the video seems to be skipping...not sure if this is my problem or the files. I've tried it on several different players but it just won't play right. If you have an answer please help! Desperately want this!"
