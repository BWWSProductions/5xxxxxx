It is a concept executed by director Rajesh Ranshinge by merging facts and fictional events.
The movie is a narrative about two female protagonists Anushka and Ahana. Anushka wedded an elderly man named Ravi. Ravi ties the knot for the second time after an unknown death of his first wife Pooja. Anushka's mother is a single conservative parent who totally refuses to accept their relationship. However her only help in distress is her sister Ahana.

The couple begins their journey in a beautiful home purchased by Ravi two years ago. Their life was content until one day... when unexpected turns and twists take place in Anushka's life. Anushka tries to share her experiences with her husband, who in turn thinks that his wife is hallucinating and so decides to move back to his earlier house.
