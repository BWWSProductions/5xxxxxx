   Recorded live at the Centrum in Worchester, MA. on November 4, 1983 and broadcast on FM radio. Needless to say the quality is fantastic and the performance is truly unique. Being a huge Deep Purple fan and a bit Black Sabbath fan, this was one hell of a line up. Ian Gillan is perhaps the most talented vocalist Sabbath ever toured with, unfortunately the Glenn Hughes line up was so short lived we may never know of their potential. Instead of trying to replace Ozzy or Dio, Ian brought his own unique style to the delivery of the vocals. Ian Gillan doesn't seem in the least bit intimidated working in the legendary Sabbath. Could be because as a member of Deep Purple, he enjoyed far more commercial and public success. A fun and facinating concert. 

Makes for an incredibly interesting show, even more so considering they perform "Smoke on the Water"!

I really like the short-lived version of 
Sabbath with Gillan- and this is a storming 
set- Gillan being in particularly fine voice. 
Perhaps it was an odd choice of pairings, 
but I'm still kind of glad it happened. 
This transfer came out very well indeed- 
minimal hiss, and a good, clear sound.
