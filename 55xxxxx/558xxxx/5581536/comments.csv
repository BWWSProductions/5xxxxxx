Video often out of focus."

watching it on my laptop on with totem movie player... the audio distorts the hell out of my speakers when it gets loud. and it is so dark many points are unwatchable. The worst part of it all... it's the first Shrek movie I did not laugh out loud at... if you want to save bandwidth, wait for a later release... I won't be...I was sadly disappointed in the movie itself, regardless of the quality of the writing. 
A: 4/10
V: 2/10 (some points are good, overall 2)
M: 3/10 (simply because it's Shrek, if this was Shrek 1... they would NOT have made sequels) 

THANK YOU TORRENTZONE01 FOR POSTING, I'm glad I got this... so I won't waste $ in the theater to see it."
