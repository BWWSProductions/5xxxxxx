Wolverine - The Anniversay 01 [2009]
THE STORY:
Double-sized one-shot with two all-new stories!
In â€œThe Anniversary,â€ itâ€™s terror at thirty-thousand feet! It's a few days before the anniversary of Mariko's death, and Logan is making the long pilgrimage to Japan to pay his respects when his 747 is suddenly seized by a group of terrorists who plan on blowing up the craft over downtown Honolulu! If Logan is to save the plane and its passengers, heâ€™ll have to rely on all of his guile, instincts and predatory skillsâ€¦ because all it takes is one bullet to destabilize the planeâ€™s pressure, or a split-secondâ€™s warning for the terrorist leader to detonate the bomb strapped to his chestâ€¦And in â€œGhosts,â€ a squad of ninja assassins is the least of Loganâ€™s problems.
