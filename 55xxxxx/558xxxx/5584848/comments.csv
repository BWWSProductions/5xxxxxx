[T],FaeGiN,2011-01-02T01:32Z,"Wow was it REALLY requiring a separate upload? You just want the glory or what?
The file was upped and is fine, with plenty seeds. The subtitles are here as anyone with google would know:

,Mitch123100,2011-05-09T09:40Z,"I know this is noob, but how do I get the subs to play with the movie??"
,lovelyanchor,2011-09-01T23:33Z,I agree with Mitch123100; how do I play the subs WITH the movie? :(
,Typoopie,2012-02-27T23:45Z,To get the subtitles to play in the movie (using VLC media player): Right click > Video > Subtitles track > Select the .srt file from the folder with the movie in it.
,PineappleStarz,2012-06-17T16:24Z,"why don't you just drag the sub file onto the movie window..?
put a flashy screen in front of some people and logic falls out their heads.

thanks and thanks to seeders, got it in 3mins. heh."
