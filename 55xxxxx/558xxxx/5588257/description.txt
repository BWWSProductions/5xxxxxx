Synopsis:

In Minangkabau, West Sumatra, Yuda a skilled practitioner of Silat Harimau is in the final preparations to begin his 'merantau,' a century's old rites of passage carried out by the community's young men which will see him leave the comforts of his village and make a name for him in the bustling city of Jakarta. After a series of setbacks, Yuda is left homeless and uncertain about his new future. Later on, he encounters an orphan named Astri and protects him from becoming a victim of a European human trafficking ring led by Ratger and his right-hand man Luc. With Ratger injured in the melee, he seeks both the boy and bloody retribution. Yuda is then forced to go on the run with Astri and her younger brother Adit. In the end, he has no choice but to face his attackers in an adrenaline charged finale.
