Who knows what'll happen when Play and Record are pressed.

A BBC7 showcase of new comedy writers and performers. Play And Record is a mixture of sketches, characters, songs and other funny bits and bobs.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 


A mixed bag, as one would expect from a show aiming to help nurture new talent.

One thing to highlight: the two series are very different in style and content. As you'll be able to see from our cast list, not only did the producer change between the series, but there was also virtually no overlap of writers or performers.
