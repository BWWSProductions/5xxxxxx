I already watched half of it.
If anybody found that there's no seeders, send me an email and I'll get it on: crave4m@aol.com."
,srmx,2010-12-25T21:36Z,"I have downloaded this torrent through torrific.com, which downloaded it to their servers first, then offered the files as a VERY FAST (compared to the torrent) direct web download (through http).

Because I have downloaded it, the files are still in their cache (for 2 weeks as far as I know), so if you want you can get them too."

All you have to do is register an account (it's FREE for 10 GB per day) and introduce the torrent URL:      http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5581221/CSI___Crime_Scene_Investigation_Season_10_Complete_720p.5581221.TPB.torrent 
 in the ""get"" field of torrific.com. Then you'll be able (for two weeks from now on) to download the files simply by clicking on their name. If the two weeks pass, you'll first have to wait for the torrent to be downloaded to their servers."

If you get the files in this easier and faster way, it would be nice to seed them to the others who don't know about torrific.com. How you do that?
For example, using uTorrent: 
â– 1) download the .torrent file from here and load it into uTorrent;
â– 2) stop downloading the torrent as soon as possible;
â– 3) If any folder was created for the download (this happens if you didn't stop fast enough or if you have a very good internet connection), delete it, you don't need it.
â– 4) right click on the torrent in the list Â»Â» Advanced Â»Â» Set Download Location...    and here you choose the folder that contains the files you have downloaded from torrific.com
â– 5) right click on the torrent in the list Â»Â» Force Re-Check. Wait for it to finish, then start again the torrent to seed. 
â– 6) this works OK only if you have all the files, otherwise the rest of them will be downloaded. To avoid this, go to the ""Files"" tab in uTorrent and right-click on the files that you don't have and choose Â»Â» Don't Download.

If you download the other files and you want to seed them too, here's what you have to do:
â– 1) repeat steps 2(stop seeding in this case), 3 and 4, from above;
â– 2) right-click on the new files (which, of course, are still marked as ""skip"") then choose Â»Â» Priority Â»Â» Normal. If you don't do this last step, the new files won't be seeded."

If you download later the other files and you want to seed them too, here's what you have to do:
1) repeat steps 2(stop seeding in this case), 4 (!) and 5(!), from above;
2) On the ""Files"" tab in uTorrent, right-click on the new files (which, of course, are still marked as ""skip"") then choose »» Priority »» Normal. If you don't do this last step, the new files won't be seeded."
