,pschlosser,2010-11-12T07:53Z,These videos correlate to an [presumably] older version of the course.  They do not match the current (Nov 2010) course outline and textbook.  These videos match the table of contents of 'Calculus: An Applied Approach 6e by Ron Larson' a textbook for life science majors.
