At 48:25 The first words that this guy said was ''there are a lot of ideas about this and they are all speculation.''

Unfortunately from that point onward this show presented this speculation as FACT.

Before time 48:25 I rate this show as 100% - Really interesting , after that time ,  I rate it a big fat ZERO.

Its a shame when ideas plucked out of the air are presented as science."
