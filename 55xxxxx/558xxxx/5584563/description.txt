When amnesia robs a man (professional wrestler "Stone Cold" Steve Austin) of everything -- including his family and his own identity -- he's confounded after discovering that he's wanted by the feds and Russian gangsters. But he's not willing to succumb to the present until he reclaims his forgotten past. In the meantime, that means dodging bullets and backstabbers and figuring out whom he can trust.
