,Uncle_Fuzzy,2010-06-05T20:56Z,"Thank you for this one!

Flies wonderfully.  But. . .  must have Acceleration installed to show full fuselage. Otherwise, see-through effect showing only windows, cabin interior, intake duct and wing tips & trailing edges.  Makes for a strange flight experience, but it does work that way."

Lionheart released the ""Skylark"" recently. That one looks awesome too.
