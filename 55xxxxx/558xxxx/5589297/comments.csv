I've stayed up long into the night on many occasions to see Jack Bauer defy death and save humanity and I know millions of you out there have to,.... go on admit it :-)
Truly amazing series so sad its over but i suppose it had to end some time and shit it definitely went out with a bang.
Many thanks to all involved in the series, thanks for all the shocks, tears and nail biting action.

A few stingy peers, though; with an up speed of 1600 kB/s I got an average of only 300 kB/s in return. With my settings I usually do much better on a torent this size & composition. You can do better than this, ppl! Crank up the upload speeds, and sacrifice some hd-space by keeping the watched eps on-disk for a while!"
