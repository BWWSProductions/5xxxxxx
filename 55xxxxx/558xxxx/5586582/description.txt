This is one of the few movies that I wrote subtitles for myself. I don't need them, but the movie was so good, I wanted to sear it into my mind.
The comments file does a very good job of explaining all the details of it. Be sure to read them before watching the movie.

As always, the subtitles belong to you. If you don't like certain phrases or comments, then change them---if you know how. It's not hard.
