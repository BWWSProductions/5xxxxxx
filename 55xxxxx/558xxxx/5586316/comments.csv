there is absolutely no point in a 16/96 recording as it has the same frequency response as a 16/48 recording.   "

,lemn8,2010-05-25T20:39Z,"@ MadDog You are absolutely right. I searched internet what went wrong. I did't know flac did't support Floating point bitrate 32+ sorry :S  but instead flac made it to 24 bits no, he reduced it to 16 bits and i dont understand why."
,lemn8,2010-05-25T20:42Z,i meant @ManDog sorry again...
,mandog,2010-05-25T23:39Z,"lemn8
You need to use Sony Soundforge pro10, to record to your hardrive as a 24/96 recording, normalise, then save as a 24/96 flac with Soundforge. You will then get 24/96 flac, that plays as it should
I hope this helps"
,lemn8,2010-05-26T19:26Z,@ManDog The originals are 32(floating point)/96 but flac convert them to 16/96 automatically. Reconvert is also not an option because i thought flac was lossless so i deleted the original wav files so i need to rerecord i'm affraid. :S i learn something here today.
