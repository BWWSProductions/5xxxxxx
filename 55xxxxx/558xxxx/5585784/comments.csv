Seriously, it's long EXACTLY as any other version (1h 44m 26s) and - do not worry - enjoy The Finale."

,zdude123,2010-05-25T06:06Z,"Thank you 24 for this. I was hoping to see a 700MB version on net. But 1.4GB for a 2 hr finale is just too much. Where were those effing rules which say a 2 hr epi shud be 700 mb.

NoTV acted as JERKS.

Though your version seems 350 mb less, I will manage with it thou. Thanks again!"
,zdude123,2010-05-25T19:55Z,"Ok Guys, downloaded this & watched. Absolutely WATCHABLE QUALITY for such a tiny size. Good job twentyfour & thanks once again :-)"
,lynxdonn,2010-05-26T05:30Z,thankyou so much :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T08:33Z,"@zdude123: You can only imagine now much  your words means to me, after 986 torrents on TPB alone, 3880 on minin. and 9239 encodings so far I finally get confirmation from true expert (known by anybody) like yourself.
""It's watchable."" is damn smart observation.
So, thanks for taking your valid time and report back."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-28T16:21Z,"@afkuser: LOL, 141.12 GiB... people who download my encodings would never be so stupid. One of my regular downloaders pays 0.74$ per 100MB - so, that one would cost 1500 bucks.

BluRay seems cheaper, right?"
