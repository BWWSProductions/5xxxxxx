Ken Weston lives in the not-too-distant future and is not your typical human
being. He is more organized than a day planner and more regimented than a Marine
With his goals of dating his pretty co-worker Allison and achieving a perfect
daily routine almost realized, Kent's clockwork existence is thrown into disarray
with the arrival of Adam - an all-too-human robot. Congenial and brilliant
(not to mention, handsome), Adam wastes little time in ousting Kent from both
his coveted job and Allison's affections. In his efforts to rid himself of his
competition, Kent is confronted by his own mechanical nature and is challenged
to do the one thing that humans find most difficult - change
