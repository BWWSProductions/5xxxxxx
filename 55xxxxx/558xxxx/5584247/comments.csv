,mikeabcd,2010-05-27T14:33Z,"What's with all the idiots who don't know a good movie from a typical piece of Hollywood junk?

This is a great movie!

Many of us have absolutely no desire to watch Hollywood crap. It's all the same; lots of killing, guns, explosions, sluts, mean people, cheating, blah blah blah blah.

The idiots who post these inane negative comments are just high on steroids and their own (made in Hollywood) platform shoes. So high that they repeat what other idiots say - don't they ever engage their brains?

Great movie! Thanks for the upping!"
