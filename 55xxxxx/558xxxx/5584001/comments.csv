,matawich,2010-06-06T22:14Z,"I was sceptical myself however this is a legit and virus free torrent.
Cannot get the expansion to work though! Any help on that?"
,futfutfrie,2010-06-16T16:36Z,"Works perfectly, the addon too. Vista/7-users: use the XP SP2 compatibility-mode."
,iepurasulbugs,2010-12-08T15:19Z,"WOW nice upload... old game.. great game...

Unfortunatelly i can't get the expansion pack to work either... 
It works on my dad's desktop (that has a 19""display and a win XP professional sp3 OS)

i'm using Win 7, i tryed every compatibility-mode option, every one of them.
(i've even tryed to modify the config file inside.. the game will launch in a window, but the display is corrupted). 

Also i've tryied it on a windows xp virtual box virtual machine, didn't work there either.

Had this problem in the past and gave up and played the original game.
I'm using a 17"" wide laptop display, i love the expansion, finished it only 3 or 4 times, i'd like to do that again, can anyone help??? any ideeas? "

,0SolidSnake0,2012-06-09T21:01Z,I can't play the Skirmish. Whenever i go to multiplayer to set up a Skirmish (regular match). It crashes. Campaign crashes after playing for 10 minutes.
