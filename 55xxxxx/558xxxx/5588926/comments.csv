,sharpnova,2010-07-19T14:27Z,"seriously? 650 meg 720p movie?

and the terrible quality shows. looks much worse than dvd quality.

download the 7.95 gig torrent instead. this one is fucking trash.

also, to cut corners on file size, this fucking dimwitted dumbshit cut audio depth too. you have to blare the volume to hear anything.

fuck this shit and boycott this poster."
,Krimsonhascake,2010-07-24T00:27Z,"@ sharpnova 
why are you even using this site if your gonna complain about something someone did and you get it for free if you dont like the free movies and shows on this site then go to your nearest store and buy them your self plus i bet you kept this file too stop putting other people down just cause your to selfish to upload a vid your self"

Excellent upload. I grabbed all 6 from you, and while sleeping, on about the slowest DSL you can get, 4 of them finished. I'll definitely be seeding this for a while, and copping more fom you in the future."
,ssnnowwyy,2010-11-02T21:23Z,yeah it's nice that he uploaded it but it's very misleading to label it as 720p. it's just been upscaled. better off with a different torrent if you want good quality.

,black3666,2010-11-27T02:51Z,Excellent quality! Thanx....
,randomfive,2010-11-27T05:18Z,For anyone thinking of downloading this torrent a 40minute TV episode at 720p is 1.1GB . A 2.5 hour movie which is only 0.65GB either uses magic compression which is 8 times better (over 4x as long and just over 1/2 the size!) or it's shit quality. If you're not wattching it on a HD screen it might look ok.
,randomfive,2010-11-27T05:22Z,"Yes it's a lower resolution because it's in cinema aspect ratio but if he's going to call it 720p anyway... 1280x720 is 720p, 1280x534 isn't. This would only help the filesize slightly - 0.68 MegaPixels per frame vs 0.92, you'd still need compression 5 times better than anything anyone else is using... and if it existed people would be using it)"
,FKoops,2010-11-27T12:46Z,"My bad, my previous post was intended for your other upload (the Goblet of Fire (2005))

,Anti11,2010-12-23T16:15Z,"Great seeding and quick download. But at such a low bitrate 720p does not make any sense at all. If you plan to play on an HD TV, resolution will be poor every time there is movement, and heavy pixelation is evident in many scenes. 
Sound is also mediocre, as it is off synch and only sampled at 24 KHz and 2 channels. A far cry from a 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS.
So, download it only if you plan to watch it on your laptop."

Until you release 5.1, you won't be as big of a releaser as you could be. HDScene puts out 5.1 and they're very popular, even though your video quality is superior. 
If people are going to download a 700MB movie, they're not going to mind another 75-150MB or whatever it takes."

it's a 650 MB upload, WTF do you expect?  Play it on your laptop using VLC and smile.   If you're bitching that you can't play it on your 62"" BR with full 1920 then perhaps you need to remove your head from your hindquarters.  It's perfect for what it is supposed to be."
,Ichigo0Soul,2011-06-30T04:00Z,"@in_dg94
I know it's a 650MB file. I wouldn't be bitching if he didn't have 720p in the file titles. Just because the frame height is 720 pixels doesn't mean you can advertise it as being 720p or classify it as highres. It's like he took a 480p video and upscaled it so the frame height was 720 pixels. This upload (and all of his other ones) should NOT be in the Highres section. There should be an upscale section for shit like this.
