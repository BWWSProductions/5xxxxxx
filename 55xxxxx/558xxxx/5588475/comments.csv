Anyhow... number of Hit&Runs exceeded 80% and I wont share with people who don't what I am and what I parroting all the time.
I guess that my great Lost encodings attracted lot of moths... and I hope that you understand that such move wasn't because any of you. You are really small minority, to start with.

So - nothing unusual, really. :-(

@tyrone69: Read the schedule, please."
