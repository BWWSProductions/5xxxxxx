America's Army: Special Forces (Overmatch) 
Release Notes - Version 2.8.3 


What's New 
============================================= 
Our goal is to tighten up the game, increase performance and reduce the size of 
the installers. We improved the frame rate a great deal in this release. Some 
people have reported as much as a 40% increase - although performance varies 
based upon your specific system setup. 

-Instant Action- 
The new Instant Action mode of Americaâ€™s Army allows you to quickly jump into 
the AA action without the need to complete training first. Now with Instant 
Action Recruit status you can play alongside veteran AA gamers and complete 
training at your convenience. Instant Action is available on any mission that 
is not restricted to Special Forces only players. You will need to complete 
Basic Combat Training in order to achieve honor levels higher than Honor 20, 
plus you'll gain the benefits of improving your skills as a soldier with each 
training level you complete! Your Honor will remain at 20 until you pass BCT, at 
which point you will receive all of the additional experience points you have 
accrued. 

-AA Loader- 
The new AA Loader checks your version of the game to ensure you are up to date 
with the most current release. It also provides easy links to other community 
tools and support information. The AA Loader requires Internet Explorer 6.0 or 
later be installed on your system. 

-Flashbang- 
The flashbang has been tuned a bit to make it more realistic. The effectiveness 
has been reduced when used outdoors. Also the blackout duration has been 
reduced. 

-Weapon Reloading- 
Weapons reload faster then before. Fixing jams and using the 
supported/unsupported function are also quicker now. 

-Every Soldier is a Sensor (ES2)- 
Every Soldier, as a part of a small unit, is a potential information collector 
and an essential component in achieving situational awareness. The updated 
SF Extraction mission includes new ES2 gameplay designed to embrace this 
new ES2 philosophy. 

-SAI Creation Tool- 
The AA Mission Editor now includes tools to help you set up and capture images 
for use with the Situational Awareness Indicator (SAI). You can customize 
the captured images and import them into your maps to enable simple SAI 
functionality. Look in the 'Tools/SAI Map Image Tools' menu to give it a try.

Technical Notes 
============================================= 
Important Note for Server Hosts/Admins 
The cooperative missions will take significantly more CPU resources to run during normal gameplay due 
to the additional AI processing load (shared between the server & client). Server hosts planning to 
run Co-Op servers should plan accordingly. In addition, players running a Co-Op server and client on 
the same machine will experience heavy CPU demand. 

It is recommended that server rotations switch only from Co-Op level to Co-Op level, or MP to MP level 
for best performance.
