Notes

Ok Did a lot of good work on this. Felt original source was too
sharp so i added a smoother filter, also added a slight sharpen.
Fixed Brightness and Contrast and added a bit more color.
Pretty decent for a first cam. Also fixed AR to 16:9 Audio isnt
too bad for cam audio either. this will do till R5.

Looking for cam video/audio, direct line audio, pre released
r5s, ntsc and pal dvds, dvd/screeners, anything useful
