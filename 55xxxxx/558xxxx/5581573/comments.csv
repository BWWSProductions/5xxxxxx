Cheers anyway!"
,lledorin,2010-05-24T11:41Z,"trev777 is absolutely correct.  Sample pic would definitely get more people to download.  If I didn't actually know who the model Franziska is, I would have passed on this torrent and moved on.  A good idea for a sample pic is the cover (if the set has one) because you can upload anywhere.  If I may suggest, if you plan on making a torrent of a photoset from a well known site,  the name of the site, model's name and set name are helpful to have in the name of the torrent.  A standardized naming system for your uploads gives it a little more polish and will ultimately get more people interested and therefore the torrent will be seeded longer. Take a look at the methods many of the other posters use as a starting point for your own  way.  While the content of your torrent is a great FemJoy set, just posting the model's name for the title is not the best way to get people interested.  

Thanks for the upload and hope my comments could be of some help."
