plot:

Majestic mountains are in the background and a waterfall in the 
foreground. Is that a canoe on the river? No it's a cradle with a baby.
The buoyant Molly Brown has survived the first crisis of her life -- 
a flood. Sixteen years later she sets out to make her way in the world.
Can she sing and play the piano? She assures the Leadville saloon keeper
that she can and learns quickly. Soon she is the bride of Johnny Brown,
who in a few years will be able to replace the original cigar wrapper
wedding ring with a replica in gold and gemstones. But it takes more 
than a few million dollars to be accepted by Denver society. The Browns
head for Europe and bring a few crowned heads back to Denver for a party
that turns into a ballroom brawl. Molly goes to Europe alone, returning
on the Titanic. She didn't survive a flood as a baby for the story to 
end here
