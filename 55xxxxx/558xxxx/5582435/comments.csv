,jonesyboiii,2011-04-13T00:07Z,"Almost top marks here:

~ The book is excellent, arguable better read than the movie
~Fast download, simple PDF file
~Chapters work well

Unfortuneately, the book (as do lots of books downloaded from TPB) has occasional spaces missing, mixing two wordstogether. Quite infrequent compared to other novels on here, so don't let it put you off!

9.5/10, great job insinuendo!"
