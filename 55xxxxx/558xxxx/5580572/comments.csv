,VscarfaceV,2011-07-08T13:48Z,I use BSplayer. It is the best i think:P It is very simple. It checks automatic for subtitles if you need them. It checks the subtitles for the language you want.

,Nemo_Russia,2011-11-01T14:55Z,Guys this is Season 6. Why can't the people compiling this just have a small quick look at IMDB. Jesus Christ. 
,Conchord22,2012-02-16T15:19Z,"Nemo_Russia Troll. This is season 5 without any doubt. I've check'd it myself. 

A: 9
V: 10

Thank you Roland115."
,MongaNOR,2012-04-23T12:05Z,"It's not season 5, this is season 6.

Go to IMDB or any other similar site and you'll for example see that ""In Country... Club"" (and all the other episodes) are part of season 6.

The reason it's labelled season 5 is because they merged season 1 & 2, but the DVD should've said Seasons 1 & 2 in the first place, making DVD #2 season 3."
,jusclem74,2012-05-04T17:44Z,"funny.... i found 3 torrents labeled american dad season 5. only one is, while the others are season 4 and 6. why cant uploaders just label the regional code so the rest of the world knows if these are uk or american releases. to confusing between uk seasons and american volumes."
