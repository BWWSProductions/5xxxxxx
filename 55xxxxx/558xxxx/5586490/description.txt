Cornysh - Stabat Mater et al[c16](Tallis Scholars)[FLA][twistle]

William Cornysh [the Younger] (1465-1523)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cornysh

A selection of the sacred and secular from this important but poorly-extant composer.  Track 5 is by far the most well-known these days, due to the arrangement by the South African folk group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, but all of the tracks on this CD are popular with choirs and re-enactment groups performing music of the period.

A very good recording, as usual, from the Tallis Scholars

I am not sure who ripped this originally: this is another of those (few) recordings I possess only via an online (non-torrent) source.  Whoever you are ... thanks :)
