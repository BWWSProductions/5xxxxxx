I couldn't have asked for anything better than this, I thank Chiyokins for coming up with such a classic anime upload from the 90s.  One of my all time favorites as a kid, if you haven't watched these you are missing out.  I will seed"

Would anyone know where to pick up the original full Japanese version of this? Or the OAVs?"
,goldaries,2012-07-07T19:49Z,"Pins, you can download the OAVs and the japanese version of this at bakabt. Just search for ronin warriors for the ovas and yoroiden samurai troopers for the japanese eps."
