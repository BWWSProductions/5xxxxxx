[T],Magash,2010-05-23T12:21Z,"I'm having some kind of tracker problem and don't know if the torrent is working. 

It shows that I'm not seeding it but I am. If nobody leaves a comment soon I'll assume it's not working and delete the torrent soon. "
[T],Magash,2010-05-24T00:18Z,"Yeah I found all that but I was gonna remove it because I figured that nobody would download it with no seeders listed. 

A lot of people must be having the problem cause it shows only 6 leechers but I have more then 30 in the peers. 

I'll do like usual and leave it till the ratio gets to somewhere between 4 and 6 . "
[T],Magash,2010-05-24T01:45Z,"Yeah I used the public trackers you gave me and it seems to be working. I know at least that everything is fine so I'm gonna be making ""Modern Family"", ""The Middle"", and the ""Big Bang Theory all 3 seasons""

Thanks for the help I'm a complete computer retard. :D"
