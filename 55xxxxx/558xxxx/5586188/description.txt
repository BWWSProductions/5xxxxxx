The terror continues in this sequel to the cult sci-fi hit about a race of robotic killing machines intent on destroying the human race. Thirteen years ago, the human population of planet Sirius 6B was completely wiped out by Screamers - blade-wielding, shape-shifting cyborgs that make a horrible high pitch sound while literally hacking their victims to pieces. When a distress signal from Sirius 6B reaches Earth, a team of rescuers is dispatched in order to find out whether a long-lost colony of human survivors have somehow managed to elude the murderous robots all these years. But the truth is far more sinister, because now the machines have managed to evolve into half-man/half-machine hybrids, and their determination to escape from Sirius 6B and find their way to Earth is stronger than ever before. Now, all that stands between the Screamers and the complete annihilation of the human race is a rescue team with dwindling supplies and limited ammunition.
