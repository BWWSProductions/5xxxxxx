SUMMARY



Before leaving on his second tour in Afghanistan, Marine

Captain Sam Cahill, a leader, an athlete, a good husband

and father, welcomes his screw-up brother Tommy home

from prison. He'd robbed a bank. In country, Sam's

helicopter is shot down and all are presumed dead. Back

home, while Sam wastes away as a prisoner in a remote

encampment, Tommy tries to take care of the widow and

her two children. While imprisoned, Sam experiences

horrors unbearable, so when he's rescued and returns

home, he's silent, detached, without affect, and he's

convinced his wife and brother have slept together.

Demons of war possess him; what will silence them?
