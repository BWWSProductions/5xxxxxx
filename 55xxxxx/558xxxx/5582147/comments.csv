[T],insinuendo,2010-05-23T03:06Z,"""Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on other. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this -- and I have, countless times, in just about every act I've committed -- and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. i gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has ben no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing..."""

I purchased and read the book (hard copy) and just had to have it in other formats. It is an excellent quality document - that I have perused over and inspected of course - and I am just writing here to tell you that I appreciate your contribution to my collection. The typeset used is easy to read and proves to be not too harsh on the eyes while remaining with some personality. Thank you for the upload."
