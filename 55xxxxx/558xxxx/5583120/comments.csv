,Sattori,2010-05-23T16:22Z,"Hi beldrog,
Though I have an email address, I don't share it with strangers. What do you want to know? Just ask here and I will see if I can answer."
,bedrog,2010-06-05T12:13Z,Maybe you should get an e-mail address that you *can* share with strangers.
,Sattori,2010-06-05T18:19Z,I am too lazy for this.
,bedrog,2010-06-16T11:43Z,"Maybe if you got an address you could share, someone would share something with you in return."
