The incorrigible cast of the most offensive animated reality show to ever air on basic cable is back and this time theyre starring in their very own feature-length movie!

When the mystery-solving musician, Foxxy Love, notices she and her fellow housemates can curse without being bleepedsomething theyve never been able to do beforeshe realizes that their show has been canceled. Determined to get back on the air, the gang ventures to such far-off lands as Bedrock, a Fairy Tale Village and the fantastical Make A Point Land, all the while outrunning their enemies, who are hell bent on keeping them off the air and are prepared to use any means necessary to do so.

Bigger, badder and certainly more uncensored, The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie! certainly lives up to its tainted heritage and provides you with a not-so-healthy heaping of what youve come to know and secretly love from the showcopious amounts of drunken-revelry, taboo-busting, and cartoon-on-cartoon violence.
