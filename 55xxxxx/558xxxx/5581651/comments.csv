,dardar6t9,2010-05-26T08:56Z,Watching these epic-type movies in anything less than R5 isnt worth it. The background and whats going on in the background is what makes them worth watching.To watch a cam or TS is as enjoyable as watching static on a tv for 2 hrs. :)  That's my opinion anyway. What others do is up to them. Enjoy.
,McNekki,2010-05-27T14:16Z,tbh people u should know that u can quite easily increase the quality slighty just connect your laptop or pc to your hd tv using the hdmi cable it makes it easier to watch

,ExhamPriory,2010-05-28T01:14Z,i THINK it means you are DL'ing off peers only
,ExhamPriory,2010-05-28T01:15Z,... I hope all spammers die of something unique and awful.   X(
,j-d-uk,2010-05-28T13:31Z,"Look, cam versions are all ways shit, you miss so much of the film. Even the best ones can't stand up to an average DVD rip never mind a decent 1GB plus rip.

Wait till the DVD rip gets posted on here, unfortunately that's gonna be the end of the year for this film.

Check here for release date : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0955308/dvd"
