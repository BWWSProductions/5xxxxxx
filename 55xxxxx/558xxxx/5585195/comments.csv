,mass_chaos420,2010-05-24T05:23Z,i want lost
,ChancerBR,2010-05-24T05:23Z,"Subtitlers said ABC may have encoded the signal (like they did on 5th season finale). This makes everything harder.
Must emphasize it's not confirmed."
,FileError420,2010-05-24T05:26Z,The east coast broadcast hasn't even finished yet. Will end in 15 minutes.
,rickregen,2010-05-24T05:27Z,episode's not even over yet dude. earliest showing was eastern time 9-11:30.
,eMoKitty,2010-05-24T05:27Z,editing the movie to submit it? its hard to submit it while it havent even ended..
,oproski,2010-05-24T05:28Z,eztv website said that they synchronized the broadcast worldwide.
,Islandstone007,2010-05-24T05:28Z,"Unless you can do a better job than EZTV, then stop complaining. You should show some respect to those ppl giving you stuff for free. Grow up.

Long live EZTV"
,remedyVenom,2010-05-24T05:29Z,"yeah, waiting like crazy too ^^
it`s funny, it`s gonna air at 5 GMT /6 GMT+1 in most european countries including turkey.... except germany..we officially have the stupidest licensors sitting on their fat asses :>
well, at least you can count on eztv :)
it`s gonna be up sooner or later, hopefully in the next half hour.. gotta watch Jimmy Kimmel too, if someone could upload that, would be a hero ;)"
,eMoKitty,2010-05-24T05:32Z,well i was watching well.. then i remember that i got 1MB internet splitted on 3 computers and the episode started to lag.. i think its better to download instead of broadcast..
,kelsexy,2010-05-24T05:33Z,Oh boy! First TV episode I have actually sat at home staring at the screen and refreshing to see if there's a copy out there yet. I can't wait! Anyone know how long it is now until it finishes airing? Is this episode 2 hours long?
,DavidCake,2010-05-24T05:37Z,Why would you do this? I am unbelievably annoyed right now. Jesus.
,Y0sHisCoOki3,2010-05-24T05:38Z,"Yeah its 2 hours long, we are all waiting :D"
,xos2010,2010-05-24T05:38Z,watch 16 again while we wait!
,prankstr,2010-05-24T05:39Z,Does anybody how long was the actual episode that is minus the commercials ?
,sarahbuttercup,2010-05-24T05:39Z,"whatabout the pre finale they show before lost, its a one hour special, is that on here, there is one that is only 15 min, is there the full length version of that because that was out before the finale"
,Y0sHisCoOki3,2010-05-24T05:40Z,I hate being in the uk right now :P
,bharatrn,2010-05-24T05:40Z,It will out in half an hour if its not encoded as someone here suggests.
,warlockwizard,2010-05-24T05:40Z,We are all waiting and clicking refresh but it will come.   TV is the only torrents where us pirates have to wait until everyone else has seen it. Just be glad we often get movie screeners and such before the theatres.    
,xos2010,2010-05-24T05:41Z,"lol david, did u think e18 was called FORUM?"

,08millerj,2010-05-24T05:46Z,"is it just me in cleveland, or was there major problem with the broadcast? it was constantly getting pixelated and the sound distorted, it was almost unwatchable because of that. "
,xos2010,2010-05-24T05:48Z,thats west coast orange pee
,Y0sHisCoOki3,2010-05-24T05:48Z,"just no spoilers plz, have some respect guys, its the finale after all :D"

,Sneeuwballetjes,2010-05-24T06:06Z,The plane will leave with Lock onboard and flies through the Bermuda triangle. When it comes out the other end it crashes on a Island....and everything starts all over again.
,vegaton1,2010-05-24T06:06Z,the internets are going to crash when this ep seeds.
,Y0sHisCoOki3,2010-05-24T06:08Z,"08millerj woke up trying to count his fingers again, when he got to 3 he gave up and decided to do something more tricky, posting on a torrent site. Plz all congratulate him :)"
,remedyVenom,2010-05-24T06:11Z,"so we gather one last time for the show that made TV torrents a big demand. Farewell to one great show!

and we`ll have to wait at least until 2011 to have a new addictive TV series... if rumours are correct, working title is Dead Empire but apart from that not much info except it`s gonna be a 'not so average' scifi series. However, as long as it`s not another 'Stargate' or 'Galactica' incarnation it should be awesome :D"
,08millerj,2010-05-24T06:16Z,SPOILER ALERT: lost fans suck cock 
,warlockwizard,2010-05-24T06:17Z,I think the finale was encoded by ABC like the finale in season 5 and it will take at least a couple hours to sort it out.  We will have to be patient
,kelsexy,2010-05-24T06:18Z,"Who wants to take bets on a world record for most seeds/leeches on one file when eztv uploads this? Will we even be able to get onto pirate bay, or just ""Search engine overloaded"""
,Y0sHisCoOki3,2010-05-24T06:21Z,"im more worried about the fac this may take a year to download cos of so many wanting this, be a while be4 some decent seeds"
,blitzkriegend,2010-05-24T06:24Z,"arrg...Im not a patient man, spent all night @ wrk to come home to the finale still airing BS"
