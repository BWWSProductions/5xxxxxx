[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-05-24T11:13Z,"Hey, cat.   How goes it, bro?   Thanks for your comment.

I forgot to mention when I uploaded this that all the artwork for each seperate disc is included.

And don't forget -- keep an eye on the top blues uploads that fendermental has been doing lately.   Some real wicked stuff!

Cheers, neonrainbow.

I choose this torrent but I will have said the same for other torrents (fat freddys drop, Son House, John Lee Hooker... and many others) :
Your work is amazing and the choice of the records is always at the top! (without speaking of the very good quality of the MP3)


Thanks for your ""music taste"",
And just one more time, thank you very much brotha!"
