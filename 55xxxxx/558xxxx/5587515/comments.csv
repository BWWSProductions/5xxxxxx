,KEITH864,2011-02-05T07:28Z,"I never had any download at over 1MB/s.
800 kb/s is about the best I have got but I still think that is relatively fast.

You must have some crazy internet service to be downloading at 2mb/s or higher.

This one is going well though, at the moment I am connected to 217 (536) seeds and 59 (680) leachers.

DL at 500 kb/s - pretty good IMO

Thanks fro seeding pirates.

Avast ye matees!!!!"
