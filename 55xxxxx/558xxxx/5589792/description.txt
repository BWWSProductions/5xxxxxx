PLOT SUMMARY

At the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, no-one's
heard of Tim Minchin, a young musician who in a last ditch attempt
to get noticed decides to give comedy a go. He needs to start
to make an income if his childhood sweetheart, now his wife, is
to get her way and start a family. This will be his last try before
he'll have to get a day job.

After a dramatic image change, his self-produced solo show catches
the attention of Edinburgh producer Karen Koren, wins him the
surprise Director's Choice award and an offer of a coveted spot at
the Edinburgh Arts Festival. He takes it. Our camera goes with him.

Even for the big league players Edinburgh is the most competitive
comedy festival in the world. Tim was a complete unknown. He was
deliciously na ve. He was a hit.

After the most successful first season of any performer in the
history of Edinburgh Tim walks away with the prestigious Perrier
Newcomer Award, TV appearances, offers from Hollywood and the West
End, the best management in the business and a gig at Albert Hall.
Now everyone wants a piece of him.

He arrives home to Melbourne a hero with all the pressures of the
"second album syndrome" to contend with as he writes his next show.
Can he live up to the hype?

It's not long before he's saying good-bye to the safety and comfort
of Melbourne for London to find out if the UK industry buzz is hot
air or the sure beginnings of a long career. Will his talent be enough?
Will his wife get the family she so desperately wants? Can the marriage
survive the maelstrom of new pressures? Can the rise continue?

For the first time in his life he has somewhere to fall.

Filmed over 3 tumultuous years by a close friend Rock n Roll Nerd is an
intimate tale of love and ambition and a rare record of the very first
steps in a brilliant career.
