,kptSpace,2010-05-22T16:23Z,"Thanks for the upload.
Do you have Real GirlFriend English Launcherv1.0A perhaps ?
Got runtime error on W7."
,kptSpace,2010-05-22T17:53Z,"Nah, I've read the faq, and runtime error happens in w7 too. When you click on a bubble. Fix is suppose to be either 1.0A or just to use japanese.exe "
,kptSpace,2010-05-22T18:03Z,"Hehe, I've fixed it. Thing is that you have to change your system locale to Japanese... even thou you play English version... then it works fine!
Thx for the help random :)"

,cr0sspyre,2010-05-29T19:34Z,"@randompirate

Thanks man! Game works perfectly and easy to install. 

One question though, if ever HF modders release a new patch or mod for REAL KANOJO, what chances you would release an update for this file (e.g. like you did in ARTIFICIAL GIRL 3)?



@Meganl1996ish

You could use a program called ""3d-analyze"". This might solve your problem but then again there is no guarantee that it will work for you."
,Hamayumi,2010-06-02T15:38Z,"Man, this the BEST game I ever had! The graphics, the innovation, the interaction and everything!

Thank you very much, Random Pirate, as always you're the BEST!!!

I LOVE YOU! (not in a gay manner, of course) :)

I'm gonna seed and do my part to!"
,Hamayumi,2010-06-03T04:36Z,"@RandomPirate

Yeah, I tried 3D too, it was like a game straight out of PS3 or Xbox360.

But too bad, I need to upgrade my PC to full enjoy the game.

Anyways, I have a question: I'm confused whenever I enter this site, sometimes it's on HTTP and while on some other times it's on HTTPS. Is it different?"
,Hamayumi,2010-06-05T09:16Z,"@RandomPirate

Wow, thanks for the link, I finally understood everything~ XD"

,Wild669,2010-10-31T22:52Z,"Someone else has problems with the webcam feature? Sometimes it freezes the game  after a while at a scene with the webcam, other times right after it starts."
,Wild669,2010-11-02T02:04Z,"When the webcam works, it works smoothly. I play it in an Asus laptop, G73Jh: i7-720QM @1.6GHz, Mobility Radeon HD 5870 1GB VRAM, 8GB ram... I run it at full quality, beside the cam issue, I only have some minor page tearing in animations between game's main actions. Anyway, the webcam feature is neat, besides nodding it allows some game's camera movement  that you can't make any other way (or can you?). oh, I have to get another mouse to play with the girls with both hands!! hehe"
,Soban100,2010-12-11T18:21Z,"First game succiusfuly installed from you, say. I extracted everything from Winzip to a foilder, then installed it, and it created a new Real Kanojo foilder. Should I delete the origonal Winzip foilder?"
,chow15,2010-12-24T14:29Z,for some reason at the end of the torrent download it tells me that this torrent contains a virus in it and cant be finished.. any helps?
,Black-Embrace,2010-12-30T20:05Z,"I had a issue playing this with the webcam plugged in but quickly found a way around it.
Whenever i had a webcam plugged in and working in game, as soon as i left clicked it would freeze all graphics, sounds would continue and could here game pausing and unpausing but no vision. 
Quickly fixed by restarting and hitting f9, this replaces webcam image with white background and silly smiley face but no more crash, hope this well help someone out!"
