,T_Zero,2010-08-11T17:01Z,yes... it's definately a description that leaves one speechless... lol
,Ryanbread,2010-09-11T05:55Z,"Great torrent, includes everything needed to install. I thought this would be a good program to have as I'm taking French 101, however, there is no option to translate from French to English. The only language which can be translated to English is German."
,soft-n-fluffy,2010-10-05T23:17Z,"Does this have Japanese? If not, is there a way I could download the Japanese expansion pack for it? Because I'm sure that it exists, I did some research on this program. "
,GraveDiggerman,2010-12-29T22:48Z,"does not include certain languages like japaneese.

Power Translator Premium comes with a wide variety of language pairs, including such languages as French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese. Unfortunately, not all of these languages come on the disc. The only languages on the disk are German, French, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish and, of course, English. This is fine if you know you will only need to translate from one specific language, but it doesnâ€™t offer as much for your money as some other translation programs. To get more languages you can download them using one of the subscriptions that come with your product."

,StagMan196,2012-04-22T13:03Z,"@ soft-n-fluffy ...There is a World version available that might have what you need...
Power Translator World Premium 15 v3.1r9"
