Google ""save our seeker"" for information on how you can help save this amazing show."
,maqsmihil,2010-05-23T04:10Z,"No offence.But this is a crappy show.Considering the likes of pacific,chuck and house MD this is too much romantic and teenage show."
,pfan313,2010-05-23T05:46Z,"@ maqsmihil.

,Treekodar,2010-05-23T18:46Z,"Shows such as Glee and Chuck are a lot better than Legend of the Seeker... Oh wait, they suck.

At least I still have my other shows such as Fringe, FlashForward, House MD, SGU, Supernatural, Lost and V."
,skyflat,2010-05-23T19:47Z,I hope to the people who end this serie never see the light of the creator and to get burned in the green fires of the underworld.... Thanks!
,Babik0s,2010-05-23T22:01Z,thanks
,mallorn,2010-05-25T15:05Z,"@Treekodar 
Flasforward got canned too.

I watched the first 6 episodes of LotS but as much as I love the books I can't enjoy these series. Each his own I guess."
,honunet,2010-05-31T02:04Z,"Does nobody else her see the irony of a pirate downloader comp;laining that his show he illegally downloaded is being cancelled?  Until Neilson tracks torrents, nearly every show made today will be cancelled almost immediately."
,tbbw82,2010-06-13T07:33Z,"The book is way better then this show.
Seriusly read the two first books and you will find out exactly how mord sith torture realy is."
