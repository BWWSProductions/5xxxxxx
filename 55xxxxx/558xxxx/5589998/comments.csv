,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:36Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!"
