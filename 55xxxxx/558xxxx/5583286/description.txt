Yesterday Once More is a 2-disc compilation released by the Carpenters in 1985. 
It was re-released in 1998 with the addition of an extra track I Just Fall in Love 
Again and a changed track ordering. The reissue was remastered in 24-bit sound with 
new notes by Paul Grein.

"Yesterday Once More", written by Richard Carpenter and John Bettis, is a hit song by 
The Carpenters from their 1973 album Now & Then. Composed in the key of E, "Yesterday 
Once More" preceded an "Oldies Medley" on the album, consisting of nine songs from the 
1960s. At the end of the song a motorcycle engine was heard to transition into the first 
song of the medley: "Fun, Fun, Fun". The motorcycle was mixed out on The Singles: 1969-1973 
compilation. However, very few copies of that particular version are on CD.

The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number one on the easy listening 
chart, becoming their eighth number one on this chart in four years. Though not quite as celebrated 
as signature songs Close to You or We've Only Just Begun, the ballad is nonetheless the Carpenters 
biggest selling record worldwide, becoming their best-selling single in the UK, peaking at #2. Richard 
Carpenter admitted on a recent Japanese Carpenters documentary that it is his favorite of all the songs 
he's written. He has gone on to perform the instrumental version at concerts.

According to Cash Box Magazine, on June 2, 1973, "Yesterday Once More" was the highest debut single, debuting 
at number 71. By August 4, it had reached number one.
