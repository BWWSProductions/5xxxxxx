It's the end of an era. For now this is the final "LIVE" broadcast of The Infowarrior with Jason Bermas as we know it. With the release of Invisible Empire behind us Jason is going back home to New York. In this show he covers the latest Obama news, the film 'Kick Ass', Rand Paul, interviews 'Tommy' from WeAreChange-Scotland to discuss the 7/7 bombings and takes calls.
