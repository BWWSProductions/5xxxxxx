From the overwhelming mass of official literature dealing with World War II, this book presents fifty of the most significant documents. The selections, some of which appear in the editor's own translations, have permanent historical value relating to the origin, course, and results of the war. They delve into little-known topics such as the official naming of the war. They also shed psychological light on the leading figures of the period. (As one example, there is Hitler's private explanation to Mussolini of his reasons for invading the Soviet Union.) Concise and absorbing introductory notes give the historical setting and explain the importance of each document.
