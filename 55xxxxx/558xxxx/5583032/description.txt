Wrecking Ball is a 1995 album by Emmylou Harris in which she moves away from the traditional acoustic sound for which she was become known, to team up with rock producer Daniel Lanois (best known for his production work with with U2) and engineer Mark Howard. The album has been noted for atmospheric feel, and featured guest performances by Steve Earle, Larry Mullen, Lucinda Williams and Neil Young, who wrote the title song.

Though her choice of songs had always been eclectic, the album was regarded as a departure for Harris who, by the age of 48, had become something of an elder stateswoman in country music. It received almost universally positive reviews, making many critics' year-end "best of" lists, and pointed Harris' career in a somewhat different direction, where she would incorporate a harder, albeit plaintive edge that would single her out from the complacent, country music mainstream. As a career-redefining album, Wrecking Ball was likened to Marianne Faithfull's 1979 Broken English album and Johnny Cash's later American Recordings. Wrecking Ball won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording.
