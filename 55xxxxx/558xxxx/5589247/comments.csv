[V],twentyforty,2010-05-25T18:17Z,@drs1982: Fate of some shows was connected with presence of our little friend. Since his ascension some shows vanished from the radar.
,Stevc,2010-05-25T20:13Z,"Thank you my friend!!


Just a question.

Now that lost, the mentalist, supernatural, vampire diaries, fringe, 24 and HIMYM seasons have ended are there any new shows you wil be doing? Example True Blood season 3 starts on june 12/13 will you be upping it?


Thanks my friend!!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-25T20:30Z,"@Stev: Summertime starts earlier on TV than in nature. Almost full schedule stops around June 15th. - and I honestly have no idea what would happen. TB goes for sure, if not by me, eztv would be there. I have no long-term plans, my friend, I cannot."
