,TheGreatBunghole,2011-02-15T11:00Z,"Thank you SOOOOO much for making this available to everyone! My Prealgebra college class (096) had some of the first sections available in part on the online portion of the course, and let me tell you, this guy seems to be teaching me more than any of my professors have! Thank you again, I will try and seed as much as possible! This is going to really come in handy for factoring polynomials in (098) Algebra 1!   :D"
