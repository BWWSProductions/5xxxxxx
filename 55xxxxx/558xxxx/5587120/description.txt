plot:
Halley is a young high school student who is disillusioned with love 
after seeing the many dysfunctional relationships around her. Her parents
are now divorced and her father has a new young girlfriend she doesn't
care for too much. Her mother is now always alone; and her sister is so 
overwhelmed by her upcoming wedding that she barely leaves the house anymore.
On top of that, the shallowness of all the girls and guys at her school 
convinces Halley that finding true love is impossible. A tragic accident, 
however, leads her to meeting Macon, and suddenly Halley finds that true love
can occur under unusual circumstances.
