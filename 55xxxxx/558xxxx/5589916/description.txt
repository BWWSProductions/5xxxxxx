New York-based anti-folkie Jamie Block debuted in 1996 with the indie label Lead Me Not to Penn Station; favorable reviews and tours opening for the likes of the Brian Setzer Orchestra, Bob Mould and They Might Be Giants helped bring him to the attention of Glen Ballard, who signed Block to his newly-formed Java Records imprint. The singer's debut for the label, Timing Is Everything, followed in 1998. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide
