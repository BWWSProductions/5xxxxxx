Comedy, 1939 Director: George Cukor. Cast plenty of female stars: Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Joan Fontaine, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard ...
 
The cast is fantastic, virtually a who's who of female MGM talent at the time the film was made. The script is hilarious. It could be considered a "Gossip girl" of the 30s.
