can you also do : X-Men Origins Wolverine...

could not find a good 720p here between 1,4 & 2gb."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-05-24T06:03Z,why not just upload 1 file in mkv format ?.. I hate all this audio track and all that x)
,satfilez,2010-05-24T11:13Z,"I think a MKV file will be around 4 GB then, and the MP4 is around 2 GB....
a lot of diskspace save....

and the mp4 is standard with 6 channel audio...
only if you need the 2 channel you need the other file, otherwise you can delete all other files and keep the movie MP4"

,jrpalletman,2010-05-25T18:28Z,does anyone else have a video glitch at 30min mark? looks like the video is missing in little blocks around his head when he wakes up in bed. 
,arian25,2010-05-25T19:47Z,"Please someone confirm about the ""video glitch"" thing."
,MasakiLHW,2010-05-28T20:12Z,"Tested with 2 computers with different codec packs (updated versions), and with a tv that reads h264. For about 7~10 times during the movie, appears macroblocks. Was just with me?"
,arian25,2010-05-29T14:33Z,"@MasakiLHW- Same issues here. The video freezes in a few places. Expected better from GM.

I had two options for this movie, 3Li's & GM's rip. And i choosed to go with GM & now here i am, stuck with an imperfect copy of the movie. X("
,CS126,2010-06-03T19:23Z,"Even I faced a few problems with the video..macro blocks keep appearing here and there during the movie..I saw those in the uploader's ""Valentine's Day"" movie too.."

someone answer me,please"
,docgreen81,2010-06-09T04:11Z,"@Nodelz

It's only important to download the separate audio track if you need it.  For example, if you intend to watch this on an XBOX 360, you need it because XBOX can't do surround sound for some retarded reason."
,docgreen81,2010-06-09T04:12Z,Also...  would re-encoding the movie fix the macro-blocks by any chance?  I usually re-encode them to convert the AAC audio into AC3.
,Nodelz,2010-06-10T21:04Z,thanx really thanx docgree81
,nbhatia,2010-06-16T23:50Z,"thanks

,Demosthenes928,2010-08-25T21:49Z,"Just want to confirm what everyone else is saying about the video. There's a shit ton of horrible blocking and artifacting throughout the movie. I expected better from a kingdom release.

@docgreen1
Unfortunately no, re-encoding it will not help at all, in fact it'd probably make it worse. As they say, ""no matter how much you polish shit, you can't turn it into gold.""

@ianalovera2
Great to see yet another idiot who doesn't know anything about computers."
