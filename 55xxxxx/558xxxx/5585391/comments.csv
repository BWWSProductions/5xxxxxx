,ChaserHUN,2010-05-24T09:13Z,"Is this the real deal, or it stops at 99,8%?"
[T],CHD242522,2010-05-24T09:33Z,"@ poffik, ChaserHUN, I upload to a ratio of 4.0. Then I let the swarm build so people with faster connections don't hit and run and everyone can get enough pieces. If it ends up still being stuck, I'll seed until the problems solved. With my torrents you'll never have a non seeded/dead torrent. If you want faster uploads and downloads I recommend a good private tracker. "
,SliverC2X,2010-05-24T12:59Z,Thanks!!^^
,JakesterX,2010-05-24T20:16Z,I tried to play the seed to leech ratio game on this torrent. Stayed away from some of the mainstream ULs thinking this would end up faster. Comin' up on 12 hours later... not even halfway there. Speed can spike fairly high but average is very s-l-o-w... Oh Well. Eventually.
