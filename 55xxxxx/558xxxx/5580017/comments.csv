,mamboze,2010-08-16T17:54Z,"This is one of the very best C books. King (the author) is not only a C expert but has the gift of being able to clearly explain how to program in C. This is one of the few books that is suitable as a beginner text and also for the intermediate level programmer. I don't know about the experts since I'm certainly not one of them. King's treatment of that difficult subject in C, pointers. is one of the clearest I've read. I've learnt a lot from this book and I recommend it strongly. I'm sure anybody reading it who is studying C seriously will find it indispensable. Thanks Unsane260 for this fine upload. "
