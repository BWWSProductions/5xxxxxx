Constraints allow the user to set up animatable 'transform node' relationships between objects. These can be used in a wide range of applications, from how a characterâ€™s eyes follow an object, to how a character might pick up a staff. While the latter is relatively straightforward to rig, what about situations when an object must pick up a character? This lecture gives an in-depth look at techniques that can be used to animate character/object interactions including situations when a character may jump from one moving object onto another.
