,luvhandler,2010-05-28T14:24Z,"Yes, thanks, by why oh why only 320 x 240 resolution? This is below VCD quality, when laserdisc resolution is capable of 560Ă480. Unless your watching this on a phone, the picture is going to be really pixelated when stretched, especially on a plasma. Too bad, because it sounds like from the opening that this was a great show. I'm not one to complain, but others should know before using time and resources to download. Thanks again. "

,bodgg77,2010-10-25T20:27Z,"I advise everyone not to download this, the picture quality is terrible, its all pixilation and the sound quality is awful aswell
disappointing as i was looking forward to it, deleted straight away"
