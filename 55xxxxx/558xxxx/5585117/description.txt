WINDOWS 7 ROG x64

I claim no credit for creating this and a big thanks to Neuropass for allowing me to share this with you

Author:_________Neuropass
Code name:_____ROG
Language:______English US
Size:__________2.42 GB (2,603,726,848 bytes) ISO
Architecture:___64-Bit
Version based:__7 Professional and Professional N (two edition integrated)


I used Windows 7 Professional as a base version for this release, simply because
7 Professional comes without backup and bit locker features.
Dism has been used to integrate updates and removing useless packages like 
"The upgrading version option" (the annoying entry in the control panel that bothers you 
to update to the ultimate version), Country packages and others...

You will have two installation choices:

1- "Windows 7 ROG 64-Bit" with full multimedia supports, (Suggested for every day use)


2-"Windows 7 ROG (N) 64-Bit" with No multimedia. (no Mediacenter, no MediaPlayer, No IE8, no DVD maker.) Keep in mind that 

the rating system will not be working in this version. This because the "N" has no multimedia support. To have it working 

you have to install the mediapack from Microsoft. This will reinstall all the packages above and fix the rating issue. (If 

you ask me, that is a bug that Microsoft should be fix.)
