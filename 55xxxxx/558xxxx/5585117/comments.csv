,ogorir,2010-07-23T21:05Z,"I'm having an issue w/ .net 3.5. it doesn't actually seem to be in this release and the installer package for vista won't let you install it on win 7.

also, on a fresh install, if i turn the .net 3.5 on in the stupid 'turn windows features on and off' dialog, it doesn't turn .net 3.5 on and when it reboots, the 'turn windows features on and off dialog' is permanently blank, even after following all suggestions to restore it. 

other than this snafu, this is an awesome release, but not having .net 3.5 prevents me from using solidworks or inventor, which is a pretty big deal breaker. so, any help getting this working would be great. Ive been trying for a few weeks to resolve this issue and haven't had any luck."
