,hank266,2010-05-24T01:31Z,"I could not patch it in ESR because it was not an DVD. ESR can just patch DVD,not CD. I try to look for an solution"
,hank266,2010-05-24T01:43Z,K. I found the solution here on tpb. cd to dvd. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5159884/[PS2]_DVD_Disc_ID_Utility_(DNAS)___CD_to_DVD___patched_with_ESR
,theblasphemousbear,2010-05-24T05:58Z,"Oh, sorry, I had to have Imgburn convert it to an ISO.
I hope that works out. If it doesn't, I could upload the original .bin, since I know you can ESR patch those, too."
,hank266,2010-05-24T13:15Z,plz can you do that. I didnt get it to work. If its not to much trouble^^
,theblasphemousbear,2010-05-28T05:57Z,"Sorry for the wait, here's the .bin:

Save before entering Madril Sewers, the first dungeon, and if this occurs, try the binary unaltered on CD rather than DVD. OKAGE is a blue-CD disc.

Excellent game, worth the effort. Thanks, TBBear."
