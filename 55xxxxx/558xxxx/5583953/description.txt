Series investigating what makes the perfect rock 'n' roll band.

Meet the band's secret weapon: 'the other one'. They might play bass; maybe keyboards; sometimes it's not clear what they do at all. Underestimate them with peril though, these guys are the glue holding the band together. Stepping out from the sidelines are bassists Peter Hook of New Order and Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses, keyboard players Rick Wakeman and The Doors' Ray Manzarek, plus the Happy Mondays' lord of the dance, Bez.
