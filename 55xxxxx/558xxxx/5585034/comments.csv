,x.morbid.x,2010-05-24T08:33Z,"A=8/9  V=8/9    For a cam, this is good quality.  You are not getting 70mm.  Sound is not very tin-like as you get with many cams not run through process.  Video is slightly grainy and frame rate reduced.  Very watchable!  Thank you UNDEAD and TvTeam!  Always reliable!"
