Barbaraâ€™s son Abram, a twenty-year-old mechanic, is homosexual. In the small Bavarian village where he lives this cannot be hidden for long. Wherever Abram goes, he is abused and driven away.

In a fit of rage, the young man strangles Hannelore and is consequently chased like an animal by the villagers.
