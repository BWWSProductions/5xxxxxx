Red Robin is a vigilante superhero associated with the Batman Family, usually a graduated form of Batman's original sidekick Robin. Tim Drake took the mantle at the end of Battle for the Cowl after his position as Robin was given to Damian Wayne. He uses it to assume a darker persona following the death of his mentor and father-figure Bruce Wayne during Final Crisis.
