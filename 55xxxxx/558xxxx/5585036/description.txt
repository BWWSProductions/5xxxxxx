Sinead O'Connor - She Who Dwells In The Secret Place Of The Most High Shall Abide Under The Shadow Of The Almighty (Phew, that's a long title.)

From Wiki:

She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the 
Shadow of the Almighty is a 2003 double album by SinÃ©ad O'Connor.  It is a 
two-CD set. The first CD collects several rare tracks O'Connor recorded as B-sides, for soundtrack albums or in collaboration with other artists, and 
the second disc contains a live concert.

The album's title is a modification of Psalm 91, verse 1. This is the same 
psalm that gave O'Connor's first album, The Lion and the Cobra, its name. 
The album sold 100,000 copies worldwide.
