plot:
The story involves Rose Chismore's youth. She flashes back and 
remembers her coming-of-age. Her recollections are sometimes less
than sweet, particularly those of her troubled and alcoholic 
step-father. Her memories of Robin, her first-love, are much happier
and she also recalls her colorful Aunt Starr -- who's visit is fun
but also detrimental to her family's health. The setting of 1950s 
Las Vegas' bomb testing is increasingly significant to the 
development of the story
