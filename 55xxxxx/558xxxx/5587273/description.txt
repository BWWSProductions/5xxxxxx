plot:
In 1974, a teenage newspaper heiress and Berkeley undergrad was kidnapped 
at gunpoint from her apartment, setting off one of the most bizarre episodes
in recent history. The kidnappers, completely off the map before Patty Hearst
disappeared into the San Francisco night, were a small band of young, 
ferociously militant political radicals, dedicated to the rights of prisoners
and the working class. They called themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Over the course of about three years they robbed banks, senselessly killed two
innocent people, instigated a firefight after attempting to shoplift a pair of
socks, and, most famously, converted their hostage and victim. They also 
achieved an undeniably visionary manipulation of the media, inciting perhaps
the first modern media frenzy. Presenting resonating questions about the role
of the media in America--mouthpiece? Messenger? Truth seeker? --The ethical
dilemmas posed by new technologies, and the proximity of madness to political
extremism.
