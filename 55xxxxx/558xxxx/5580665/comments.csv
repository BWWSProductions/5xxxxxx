Don't complain about the file format. Using ISO is cool and everything but you can use DVDFab to handle these files and the only DVDs I haven't been able to run on my PS3 are the ones that are PAL (hate that Sony did that).

I guarantee you that you're doing something wrong when burning. Just burn the Full Disc and let it go. The only complaint I have about anyone's DVD-R uploads is that they don't fit perfectly onto a disc. I always end up burning at 96% quality, which ultimately forces me to make a TEMP copy at 96% instead of burning immediately, straight shot. If these were made to exactly 4300 MB, then I'd have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.

Also, sailo uses the custom menu because the retail ones don't accommodate the added non-retail subs, and the menu takes up space that could be used for higher quality BDrips. I'd sacrifice the menu any day for higher quality video.

And if you're using DVDshrink still, omg...get DVDFab."

,Poglodyte,2010-05-29T05:50Z,"You should be able to fit 4.37 gb on a disc.  I don't know if low quality discs don't allow that, but all I use is verbatim dvd+r.  I burn the files with 1click dvd copy pro using the directory as my source and the 'exact copy' setting.  I've actually burned 4.38 gb, but that's right on the cusp."

,ohrton,2010-06-18T07:09Z,"I use ImgBurn on the folder containing the VIDEO_TS folders. It auto detects that it is a DVD and will burn it appropriately for playback. If your trying to burn straight as files to disc I would suspect you could have issue perhaps. Also if your set for ISO9660 you wont full the use the full size of the disc and it may say it wont fit. Use UDF for data discs in this case. Also no reason to run torrents through DVDFab or Shrink, etc, torrents are already extracted from the retail dvd this way. But I guess youre just using the burn feature of these programs."
,1200Mics,2010-06-19T05:00Z,"Thanks for the up!
@badhabitremix: your remark on file format is totally incorrect and holds no ground whatsoever."
