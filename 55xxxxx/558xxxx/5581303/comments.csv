,jahem1980,2010-05-23T07:37Z,"You tell'em TvTeam! People get'em from me and think they're gonna get blu ray quality outta a movie that came out at the theaters last night and for half the price they charge for 1 adult admission,WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,jackel1671,2010-05-23T14:07Z,TvTeam u do goodwork.... dnt thro sumthing on here just to say u have it....
,4U_upload,2010-05-23T18:46Z,"Very Pixelated, Very Blurry, in very dark scenes (e.g Nights, dark Rooms) it's very hard to see them and very mushy and blurry. It loses focus every couple times now and then and a little dis coloured in dark scnes as well. But The Audio is very good! There should be a R5 with this Audio!
Recommend boycott of this torrent unless you want to be disappointed by the quality. Everybody, just wait for better quality CAM! Seriously!!!!!"
,jackandbudlight,2010-05-23T20:12Z,"The Audio is Way off. Video is pretty dark. Wait for a TS version. 
Wont be long im sure. 
A/4  V/6"
,skysober1,2010-05-23T23:18Z,"Don'tcha just love guys who say boycott this or that and NEVER have a thanks to give for those whom share here?

Even if it is not perfect (which the author warns) it IS a first release and I for one am THANKFUL that people are doing their best to help out!

Yes, there will prob be better versions come along.  But this came out the same day as at the theater, and I for one am impressed!

THANKS!!!"
,skysober1,2010-05-23T23:22Z,"And I REALLY hate SPAMMERS whom want you to go to watch something 'online"" in its overcompressed - click on a million adds to watch version.   Somehow, waiting 3 seconds every 5 seconds for an online movie to buffer is stoopid.  That is why I use PB here to get the REAL movie COMPLETE without SPAM.  THANKS for sharing the REAL movie here."
