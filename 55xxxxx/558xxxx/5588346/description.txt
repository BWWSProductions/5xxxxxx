1938. Hampstead. Sigmund Freud's study. After some stage
shennanigans, Abraham Yahuda - another psychiatrist - arrives,
and starts analysing Freud to understand why he is wearing his
raincoat and has ladies' undies in his study.

Soon Salvadore Dali seems to be the only sane one there.

The play shows Freud's obsessions leading him into weird
misdiagnosis to the significant detriment of some of his patients.
