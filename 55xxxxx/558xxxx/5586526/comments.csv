,freshbreathman,2010-06-02T13:00Z,"I downloaded both the 4.35 gb and this 2.85 gb .mkv version.
I highly recommend this one! 

The quality is surprisingly good! Of course it's not blu ray quality but it looked good enough on my PS3 + 50"" plasma.

Also, the episodes are labeled correctly and two nice bonus features (recaps and interviews) are also included.

As far as the actual content is regarded: without spoiling anything, the finale is really the most beautiful thing I have ever seen on TV."
,felinerat,2010-06-03T08:31Z,"Hey RiddlerA......

[V],RiddlerA,2010-06-06T18:24Z,"@ above

There is a software name - Subtitle edit
It can be used to sync the Subs 

Or 

You can use Gom player

It is one of the most user friendly & feature rich Player I have come across
One can Do a load of things with it
Disable/enable subs
Manually sync the subs, audio
Sharpening & smoothening of Video 
& many such features

Also install codec packs & update it regurarly
K Lite & Combined Community Codec Packs are 2 of the most Popular packs"
