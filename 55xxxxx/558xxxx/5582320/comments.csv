,greekfirefor,2010-05-23T04:41Z,Can I use this over my Win 7 Home Premium which already had its loader and failed by Microsoft Update KB971033?
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-05-23T06:14Z,"Yes, I need to know if this can ""neutralize"" this update? I used RemoveWAT so my copy of Windows 7 is still activated, but the update keeps ""popping up"" a ""Non Genuine"" message."

,Banditten8520,2010-05-28T16:19Z,"Hey guys. I recently had the ""Your windows copy is not genuine"" problem.

So i did as told in the readme:
* Launch the loader application and select to uninstall
* Restart the PC
* Install the loader and restart the PC
* Visit the following website to revalidate Windows: www.microsoft.com/genuine/

but it still says my copy is not genuine?"

just delete/uninstall update KB971033"
,milkytech,2010-06-14T23:12Z,"I had windows activated with Daz 1.7 months ago.  all was fine and then rebooted a couple of days ago and now i'm not activated and  says copy not genuine.  tried uninstalling and installing Loader a couple of times with no change. still says it needs to be activated and not genuine.  tried new 1.8 loader with no success.
how did the OS find out it wasn't genuine.  it was activated and I have always had updates turned off"
