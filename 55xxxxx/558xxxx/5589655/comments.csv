,psp88,2010-06-11T18:56Z,How do I get his working on my TomTom Start? It doesn't have a SD Card but it has 1GB of inbuilt memory. 
,snellejapie,2010-08-15T08:50Z,It works for my tom tom one V3 and Start! First you format the Tomtom. Then you install a new patched version of Navcore. Then copy the new 1 gb map on the tom tom and use a program called Easydctmaker to make the map work with the device.
