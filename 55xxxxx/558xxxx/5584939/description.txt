Hi Pirates around the world,


Because of a continuous flow of questions about antivirus & security software,
here's a Top 10 list of well known and reputed antivirus & security software. 

The list below is based on popularity, and the number of users and downloads. 
However, it is not an official Top 10 list, and also there's no such thing 
as an official Top 10 list (or a "the best of whatever it is" list).

Making a choice all depends on your own wishes and needs, as always. 
In case you need it then take the time to read the torrent descriptions 
and comments, because they may help to make a decision.

All torrents below are clean and working, and have been tested by many TPB users 
by now. In some cases problems and solutions have been posted, so remember to 
read the torrent comments before reporting issues. Also don't forget to read 
the included Readme!.txt file and Install notes!.txt file. Report possible 
questions only at the torrent(s) in case.


Note that of some torrents there's an older and latest (newer) version. Also note
that the Internet Security software contains a firewall, and already contains the 
antivirus option. So install either the Internet Security or AntiVirus software,
but not both of the same company/publisher. In case of installing a second 
antivirus scanner just install the av scanner feature by custom install, because
the other features may conflict with already installed (full) Security Software.   


As said, the list below is not an official list. However, if there are any experts 
who feel the need to discuss the rankings, then go ahead. You may never know if
someome will feel the need to reply, but don't expect me to be that someone. 



Enjoy & Cheerz, :)

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
