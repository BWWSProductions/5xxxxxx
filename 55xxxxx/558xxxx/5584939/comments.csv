u always rock++++++++++++++++1111111111 for ur works"
,tramho,2010-05-24T13:35Z,"don't bother downloading this AV software with keys and cracks.
Be smart and install Panda Cloud.
A free and easy to use AV."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-24T16:21Z,"@tramho 

The problem with free things is that you get what you paid for. So be stupid and suit yourself.


@silverfangs 

Why do you think the better av software is popular? Right, because of their detection rate, etc. Maybe you should try another pc in case some of the software slows down your pc. And just like with free versions, you get what you pay for, although here the paid versions are free."

,tramho,2010-05-26T08:37Z,"@ LoayAhmed 
Have you ever tried Panda Cloud?
I've tried NOD,Norton,Avira,MacAfee,AVG
PCTools.
There is nothing wrong with Panda Cloud.
It captures everything with very little false positives.
I reinstall my windows every month just for fun!"

[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-26T18:49Z,"@tramho 

You're acting like a Panda agaent, who's just trying to promote Panda.

Note that all free software is stripped: they lack/miss the features and updates of the paid version. Basicly freeware is just meant to promote the paid version. That's one of the reasons why free av software generates more false positives. 

After all a free car wouldn't be the same as a paid car, even if it's a car. Free cars can be fine, but when it gets serious they would fail."
,Morgan1189,2010-06-30T20:22Z,"Hello, RobbingHood!

I am feeling so thankful for your work, it's really awesome, thanks a lot!

But, please, can you answer me? I am having troubles with Norton Antivirus 2010. I have installed NTR, but i was such a fool to delete Norton and then trying to uninstall NTR. Now I can't install Norton Antivirus, because the install window immediately shutdown after i press big yellow button ""Accept And Install"". Can you help me? It'd be so great! Reply to my e-mail: morgan1189@yandex.ru"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-01T03:50Z,"@Morgan1189 

Try the Norton Removal Tool, it's free available."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-01T03:51Z,...Or run the NTR to see if it can be uninstalled.
,Morgan1189,2010-07-01T08:05Z,I tried both things. Nothing. Maybe I should do it in a Safe Mode?
,Morgan1189,2010-07-01T09:22Z,I've done it in Safe Mode. Nothing again. Do you know what to try else?
,m3123,2010-07-23T22:41Z,"@Morgan1189 (or anybody else), did you ever find a fix to your problem, I did the same thing, removed norton before to unistall NTR and can't reinstall norton anymore, it does say in the instruction to remove NTR before to remove norton but I totally forgot about it since I was running the program for 6 months already...anybody ?!"
,Damien_74,2010-07-28T21:57Z,Cant say for the rest of the list. But Norton is not a good application. Its unpresidented large! Its not among the top 5 in finding viruses. Those that use and vote for it is users that do not know better. I have never met anyone IRL or on internet that did not remove Norton after a while and regret it.
,collectr,2010-10-18T15:26Z,Bitdefender 2011 with proper patch please
,peegee23,2011-01-09T04:16Z,"well in the end it really depends on the user's preference. as i am using avira premium side by side with agnitum outpost firewall pro. thanks RobbingHood for the trial resets. Should it be flagged by your AV as a malware, it's not, just a false positive. you can look into Av-comparatives or matousec for reviews. but they were not conclusive evidence of the performance of the different protection programs.. tnx again."
,Redt0rrent,2011-08-23T12:14Z,BitDefender for me.
