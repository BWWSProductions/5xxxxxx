PLOT:


In small-town of West Canaan,Texas, high school football is a way of life and religion. The head coach is deified, as long as the team is winning and 17-year-old schoolboys carry the hopes of an entire community onto the gridiron every Friday night. In his 35th year as head coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) is trying to lead his West Canaan Coyotes to their 23rd division title. When star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) suffers an injury, the Coyotes are forced to regroup under the questionable leadership of Jonathan "Mox"  Moxon (James Van Der Beek), a second-string quarterback with a slightly irreverent approach to the game. "Varsity Blues" explores our obsession with sports and how teenage athletes respond to the extraordinary pressures places on them.


TAGLINE:


Make your own rules. Small-town heroes, big-time dreams. In a town where winning is everything, these guys have nothing to lose. It takes a hero to know what's worth winning.
