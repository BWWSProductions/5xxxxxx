PrisM Notes::::::::::::
to be honest, source was pretty poor, in all ways color, noise, focus issues etc, anyway, changed the colors around a touch, added some brightness but not to much, added a video denoise filter onto it also, and slight sharpness, filtered audio etc video is still far from great, but it'll do for the kids :)

UPLOADER NOTES
QUALITY IS NOT THE GREATEST...BUT PROBABLY THE BEST OUT SO FAR...FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T WAIT :)
