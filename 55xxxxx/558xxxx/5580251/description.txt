Sister Drum is an album by Chinese singer Dadawa, which is heavily influenced by the music of Tibet. The album is notable for being the first Asian CD to ship over one million copies in China. The use of Tibetan folk music as the basis for some of their recordings has aroused some controversy in the context of China's rule over Tibet. A music video was made for the title track.
