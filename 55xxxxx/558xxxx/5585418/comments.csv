,Kyta,2010-05-24T09:08Z,"Lost, you stole 6 years of my life and I would like some sort of monetary compensation

For anyone that doesn't know the ending, here's a mini bio-

pain and suffering and death still exist in the same universe it started in, while Jack lies bleeding to death crying in the woods on the god-forsaken Island he wanted to protect. While in some other stupid universe, everyone's fine and dandy and happy as a clam while they sit there knowing that all that bad stuff happened to an other version of them but for some reason they're all crying.

END SCENE

lame show"

,dark_arts,2010-05-24T15:16Z,"Oi faggots who already have the fucking CD1. Do you assholes mind sharing that shit with the rest of us? 

Why the fuck is it that CD2 finished 4 hours before my CD1 which has been on download for the past fucking 6 hours now? "

,beasteeee,2010-05-24T19:15Z,"TOOOOOOOOOOO SLOWWWWWW....... 

SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
,SEoF,2010-05-24T20:50Z,"Hmm, for a 50 minute episode, it sure does seem large.

Those complaining of people not seeding, learn what the numbers are telling you.  When you see ""2 (32996)"" in the seeding column, it means ""you are connected to 2 of the 32996 seeders"" NOT ""the other 32994 people with it aren't seeding""

Learn how it works before you complain!"
,zaabon_70,2010-05-24T21:42Z, Thanks eztv!! :-)
,goodnoah.com,2010-05-24T21:52Z,Jake has swet dogsex in the end

,Rocker10,2010-05-24T23:23Z,Does anyone know a link to the Jimmy Kimmel Aloha to Lost special that aired right after the finale?? I can't find it anywhere!
,NPJH,2010-05-24T23:39Z,"Thanks eztv, but there is supposed to be some more footage during the credits sequence, a shot of the beach of some kind...."
,sammy-b,2010-05-25T00:58Z,"am i the only one seeding ?

,panosol,2010-05-25T01:12Z,pity and shame..........what to say...just pity and shame for the unacceptable & inglorious end of the far most finest tv show ever...!!! complete disappointment........and finaly the LOST were our 6 years !!
,endassey,2010-05-25T07:38Z,They're all dead. Jokes on you.
,kamelc1128,2010-05-25T09:12Z,hey
,scatattack,2010-05-25T10:57Z,"What a load of balls. I never liked lost from the get go and all I ever seemed to hear from people was how good it was, so I watched every episode to see if I was actually  missing something and guess what? it was actually shitter than I originally thought. I don't know how anybody can truly watch this shit and think it's good. To be honest I found 10 good episodes, but that's like out of 100+ episodes. That means less than 10% of this fucking shite is actually good. Monkey see monkey do I guess, the black sheep public will follow any bullshit that they think is popular, hence the simpsons, two and a half men and so on and so on and so on and so on. All I can say is THANK FUCK this tripe has ended. "
,matttxxx,2010-05-25T13:40Z,"If you have not yet seen this yet do NOT read previous comments they reveal the ending in a number of posts, be warned...."
,darksniper88,2010-05-25T13:48Z,hahaha i didn't notice that it was cd2 xD damn 15 minutes into cd2 already hah
,Saiji,2010-05-25T22:47Z,Fair doos; 2 days in and I'm still barely getting transfer rates over 5kbps when I'm usually around 250kbps. Might be able to watch it soon - the worst is trying to avoid all the bloody spoiler posts that are on apparently every site on the net!
,sugdude,2010-05-25T23:04Z,Don't read the above posts you'll get spoiled... but I for one loved the ending... it was soo sweet and character orientated. They were never going to be able to explain all the mysteries in one episode so don't expect that. Watch it with an open mind and you'll love it!

,zuriki,2010-05-26T12:07Z,THERE REALLY ALL DEAD
,instantcarma,2010-05-27T02:22Z,"Lame, lame, lame.

The shittiest possible ending available on an otherwise enjoyable show.

I really loved the first season, and I have with declining interest still followed the rest.

But watching the finale was like waiting for a great light show and then finding out the fireworks were wet.

I was pissed at the writers after watching the end. I still wonder what really was the answer on everything. The end just left you with loose threads. Lame."
,_gata_,2010-05-27T16:29Z,"NOOOO!!!! LOST IS OVER!!!

Live long and prosper lost....."

,crazy_ass,2010-05-29T11:13Z,great end to a great show
,For_The_Alliance,2010-06-09T08:23Z,"**SPOILER** **SPOILER**

i dont think the flash sideways was purgatory....think of all the Egyptian Mytholoy in this show...it was cleary meant to be like the afterlife and them all being together in the ""Afterlife"" DOES NOT mean that they all died at the same time....what im trying to prove is alot of people are saying they were all dead at the scene of the origional crash.....BULLSHIT everything that happened happened. Jack died from ""turning the light back on"" charlie died from drowning,christian died from being a drunk.
Hurley and ben could of went on protecting the island for 5374985634 years like christian said to jack in the ""Afterlife"" ""There is no now here""

in my opinion if you disliked the Show/Finale you just dont properly understand it

Also...Dark_Isle you can suck a stiff one faggot"
,432was,2011-01-08T17:09Z,"thank's eztv for the season 6
for who's wondering this is the part 2 of the final episode and it's about 50 min
the part 1 is the e17 cd1 which is about 53 min
voila "
