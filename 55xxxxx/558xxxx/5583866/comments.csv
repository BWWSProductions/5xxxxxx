,dpance,2010-05-23T22:42Z,"Thanks again buddy.  Couldn't help myself and watched the shitty coverage on Speed just to see the outcome.  I've had my new Ducati 1198S for about a week now and cried when Stoner went down AGAIN.  Sigh.  At least Nicky is starting to come around.  And what's the deal with Dani The Complainer?  How did he loose two positions on the last lap?

Regardless TDMK, thanks again for posting the preferred MotoGP coverage.  Always appreciate your time and effort.  Will watch this tonight after the kids are in bed and I check on the Ducati one more time to make sure she's comfy in the garage!  :)"

Thanks so much."
,ipso74,2010-05-25T18:29Z,dpance why the hell would you spoil what happens in the race? We are downloading this to find out.
,Vulvax,2010-05-27T00:18Z,"Thank you,
and fuck you dpance !! 
if your gonna say something like that then first place: SPOILER ALERT, you asshole !"
,tdmk1,2010-05-27T01:32Z,"Guys, guys, guys! Please say Spoiler Alert, but let's not go overboard with the insults - I know @dpance would never spoil the results maliciously..."
,dpance,2010-05-28T22:00Z,"ipso74 & Vulvax,

I just re-read my initial comments and NOWHERE do I ruin who won the race.  Yes, I said a couple of things that occurred and for that I apologize.  The intelligent downloader knows NOT to peruse the comment section first.  In future since I download and comment an ALL tdmk1's races, I'll not post germane comments or will provide a tag stating SPOILER ALERT.

Again, my apologies if I ""truly"" hurt your viewing experience although I don't think my observations were THAT egregious.

Never ceases to amaze me given the shelter of a keyboard and a dimly lit room how tough the mutants and human excrement of society become.  I'd thoroughly entertain parting with some serious cash for a face to face meeting to see how bold and brash you two would be."
