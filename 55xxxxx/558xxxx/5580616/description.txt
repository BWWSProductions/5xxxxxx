EDIT: I messed up on listing the properties for the space lord .avi video, 
i fixed it here on the website, but the torrent text file has to remain 
because you can't edit a torrent once it's made. might as well say that 
the .avi version was included because it is partially uncensored, but not 
as good in quality as the VOB, and the .wmv remix is completely uncensored,
but very low quality, the video is edited differently though.



Hope you enjoy these promo videos as much as i do, and look for a "The B-52's"  
rare promo video collection that i will be posting in the future.
