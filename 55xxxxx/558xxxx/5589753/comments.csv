""Chuck Season 2 Complete (iTunes)""
just...
to make it easier for others to recognised it

Then I realized it was ""Chuck"" season 2, and I knew my search had just begun.


Obviously, j/k, but like houruoha said, it would be really handy if the title of the torrent mentioned that it was Chuck. ;)"
