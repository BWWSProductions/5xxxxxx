Uncut Mag.Strange Brew(may 2004)[FLAC]

Over the years, Eric Clapton has discussed with a number of interviewers the music he was currently listening to or what he simply enjoys. Despite his deep and abiding love for the blues, the other recurrent theme is the wide variety of music he listens to. The music crosses all age groups, cultures and genres.

In May 2004, Eric Clapton was the subject of a cover story for Uncut, a U.K. magazine. Each month, the magazine comes with a free CD of music. In some months, the editors ask the musician featured on the cover to compile the CD for listeners. Eric Claptonâ€™s choices for his Uncut CD were:
