Race at the speed of Sonic when this All-Star cast of Sega characters hits the track! Join Sonic, Dr. Eggman, Tails, Amigo, AiAi, and other favorite Sega heroes and villains for a dash to the finish line. Each character guides their own unique vehicle, including cars, planes, motorbikes, and even a banana mobile. Take secret shortcuts, collect power-ups and weapons, and speed past the competition with special All-Star moves that give your ride a custom boost. Chase the checkered flag in three ways: scramble for first in frantic single-player races, jostle with up to four friends in split-screen contests, or compete with up to eight online.
