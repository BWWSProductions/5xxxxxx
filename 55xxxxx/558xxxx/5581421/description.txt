I took this (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4721521/Assy_McGee_-_Seasons_1-2___Extras_%28Complete%29) and made a dvd with menus. In my opinion, this is one of the better shows they had on adult swim. So until they release an official dvd, we will have to make do with this. 

Assy McGee folder includes AUDIO_TS & VIDEO_TS folders. 
VIDEO_TS includes all the files to burn onto dvd. 
Also included are my dvd case insert design in JPEG & PSD formats and the disc label also in JPEG and PSD formats. 

DVD works, have watched it numerous times already. 

DVD made with Sony DVD Architect Pro 5.0. 

Enjoy! 

DISCLAIMER: Videos have the adult swim logo (bottom right) and feature the TV MA rating at the beginning (upper right). I do not know how to remove these.
