Dear Ladies - Series 2 (1984) [TVRip - Xvid]





Take Hyacinth Bucket (Bouquet), Joyce Grenfell and Emily and Florence from Little Britain - mix them up - and you have the sublime Hinge and Brackett. 

Sensible, practical Dr Evadne Hinge and her old school chum, opera star and national treasure, Dame Hilda Brackett are brought to life by the talented George Logan and Patrick Fyfe in 6 witty episodes, co written by Gyles Brandreth. 

With more than a nod to Noel Coward, the gentle world of these two maiden ladies is a joy from start to finish as they show us round their home village Stackton Tressel, playing bowls, organising recitals, providing music for weddings, shopping for hats. Their tussles with the local Librarian ("Shhh!") are a recurring joy, as are the phone calls to Town Clerk Teddy and his daring - but accident prone wife - Peggy. The humour is spiced with double meanings - but the U certificate means there is nothing offensive here. 

When Hilda and Evadne burst into song, the music genius of their creaters is there to see, yet they are happy to play the dotty ladies with a warmth that shines through and makes them real characters. Many viewers will associate an old auntie, a neighbour, a school teacher they knew with one or other of the "girls".
