@yazinbhai: It should be after - but it depends on the people - how hard they will try to obstruct others by keeping their upload speeds at minimum. Currently, 58% of the peers have been playing with their settings and my nerves.

I measure real speed of every peer during his first ""handshake"" with my server - and compare result with their real speeds. It usually ends bad for either such peers or torrents."

If everyone would simply turn up their upload speed to unlimited and stick around to seed at
least what they have taken,there would be no problem.You will find that your download speed 
will be faster as well.Help make 20-40's torrents
the best that they can be and everybody wins."
