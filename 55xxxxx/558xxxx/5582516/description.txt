With the release of his latest mixtape Gang Green Season, Lloyd Banks
had the mixtape game revved up for his upcoming Rotten Apple sophomore
album from G-Unit.

But before the album drops later this year, DJ Semi compiled this
blends/remix compilation of the hottest shit from 'The Boy Wonder.'
Also featuring a gang of new material plus even a few classics,
this mixtape will help hold you over.

Lloyd even stops by to chop it up on the mixtape as he helps narrate
the 40-track Lloyd Banks experience. Blue Hef is back!
