Alex talks with Dr. Andrew Wakefield [hour 3], the British former surgeon and researcher who was banned by the General Medical Council from practicing medicine in UK for his research and public statements linking the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine to childhood autism. In November 2001 Wakefield became a fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists in recognition of his research publications. Dr. Wakefield is the author of Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines -- The Truth Behind a Tragedy, available at the Infowars Store.

Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
