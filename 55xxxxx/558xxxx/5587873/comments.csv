Any one knows if this is the last season, or will there be one more?"
,Bob__Dole,2010-05-25T22:54Z,"Their contract is up and it is an expensive show, this was supposed to be the last season and probably will be, but they hope to make a box office movie to get the last few dollars out of the show."
,Volkerball,2010-05-25T23:13Z,"Great ending of the best show ever made!
Thx for all the years of great acting by Kiefer Sutherland!"
