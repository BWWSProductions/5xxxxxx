It's party time! Namco is celebrating 50 years of bringing you the greatest games on the planet by releasing the biggest and best compilation of time-honored, all-star arcade classics for the PC. Namco Museum 50th Anniversary features 16 of the most treasured Namco original games in arcade history wrapped up in a retro-cool menu interface that allows you to explore a virtual arcade and dominate your favorite games. Because this museum was developed by Digital Eclipse rather than Mass Media, it features "true" arcade game emulation (the games are emulated using the original game ROMs). Relive your arcade years and rock out to a cool 80's soundtrack that takes you back to glory days of arcade gaming and this time...leave your quarters at home.

Extra's: 

â€¢ You can launch each game individually by running the batch files in the Games 
  Directory
â€¢ The batch files launch the games without the "Press 1 - ONE PLAYER START / 
  Press 2 - TWO PLAYER START" info screens so you can see the rolling demo's 
  without interference :) 
â€¢ If you want to load a game in Windowed Mode, edit the batch file and add -window 
  to the commandline

  Example: N50.dat -window -game Galaga88
