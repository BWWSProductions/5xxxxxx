,madmarkus,2010-05-24T15:49Z,"Appreciate the appreciation. With regard to me keeping doing this; I´ll do but hope I don´t have to. So far Sea Patrol eps were always up´ed quickly. I wonder what was in the way this time and why there aren´t many more rips up´ed already? 

Speaking of what was in the way, any idea why the trackers did not work for me? "
,EeeGee,2010-05-24T17:46Z,Awesome. Been waiting for this to appear. Thanks! :D
,cliveowen,2010-05-24T20:33Z,"this is great!, but anyone know what happened to the 720p rips?(who ""usually"" does them?. Not only did this episode take several day to surface, but there aren't any HD versions to be found(even using several search engines...)"
