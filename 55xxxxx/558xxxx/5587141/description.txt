Once a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth I fighting Spainards in Africa,

He met the Devil's Reaper and discovered he was bound for hell!

sins, seeking out redemption in a life of peace. That is until

the followers of priest turned sorcerer Malachi kidnap a Purtian

girl Meredith Crowthorn and brutally slaughter her family before

his very own eyes (including butchering her beloved younger

brother Edward who Solomon had befriended)! Forcing Solomon to

take up arms and return to his violent ways once more to rescue her!

In doing so means returning to his birthplace and facing his older
