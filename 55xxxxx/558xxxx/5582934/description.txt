PLOT
In 2001, two films were released simultaneously about the real-life murder of a prostitute in Kowloon. Thanks to the media frenzy surrounding the subsequent trial, these films were responded to with equal parts disgust and curiosity. The young prostitute was brutally tortured and tormented before ultimately being killed and dismembered. With this being said this film IS NOT for those that are easily disturbed or offended, but this is a rare and hard to find film that I know some collector's of cult cinema and gore hounds will want to add to their collection so here it is!! In all of it's stomach-churning glory lol.

Duration: 90 minutes
Language: Chinese
Subtitles: English Hard Coded
