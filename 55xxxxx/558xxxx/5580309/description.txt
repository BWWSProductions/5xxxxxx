Vehicles: In Battlefield, vehicles are more than a means of transportationâ€”they're 
powerful implements of destruction. Reference the Vehicles section for information on all light, heavy, water, and air vehicles, complete with field-tested tactics. All vehicle specializations are covered in this section too, helping you decide which bonuses to apply to your ride during chaotic multiplayer matches.

Campaign: Marlowe and the gang from Bad Company are back in action, this time chasing after a rumored Russian superweapon. Follow the step-by-step walkthrough in the single-player Campaign section to complete every objective and uncover the truth behind this latest threat.
