Ripped from the original 1983 LaserDisc

This LaserDisc was done as a documentary of the Beatles.  There is a Lot of early material from Liverpool, Germany and the original trip to the US and the Ed Sullivan as well as the later material.

I have seen lots of the later Beatles clips and material, but never this much of the formative years.

LaserDisc quality sound and video.

Front and Back Cover art.


Enjoy and PLEASE seed!
