,k7sparky,2010-07-19T01:11Z,"I will upload the MPG I made and you can compare and please comment.  The Avermedia card I have says 720X480, but I do not know how to check it.  I used MPG-2 ""best"" quality whatever that signifies, file is 5.9G.  I do not remember what I did on the conversion to AVI, the file is 3.8G.  I also have the MPG files for the other LDs I uploaded if anyone wants the bigger files."
