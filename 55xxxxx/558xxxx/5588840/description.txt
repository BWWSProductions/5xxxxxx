Iglesias either wrote or co-wrote every track on the album. Enrique has said that for many of the tracks on the album he started out simply with titles that he later based the songs on. The first song to use this method was "Don't Turn Off the Lights", which was originally going to be the title of the album and the first single off the album. Enrique also stated that he wrote many songs for the album, but picking the ones he considered to be the very best.
