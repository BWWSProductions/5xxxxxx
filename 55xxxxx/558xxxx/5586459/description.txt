Chuck Berrys legendary breakthrough 1950s Chess recordings has gotten their
first thorough presentation anywhere via a 4-CD, 103-song box set on Chess/Hip-O
Select Records. These are the groundbreaking recordings by the first poet
laureate of rock n roll that set the tone lyrically and musically for all that
came after. To paraphrase John Lennon, if they didnt call it rock n roll,
theyd call it Chuck Berry music, and this remarkable new set shows why.
Digitally remastered from the original Chess masters, the collection features
not only such oft-covered classics as Maybellene, Roll Over Beethoven, Rock
And Roll Music, Memphis, Sweet Little Sixteen, Johnny B. Goode, Carol,
and Little Queenie, but it also shows the evolution of the artist and his
songs, while presenting a surfeit of rarities, including 16 previously
unreleased tracks.
With the exception of two live recordings, all of these tracks were recorded at
Chess Studios from May 21, 1955, through a massive late July 1959 session, which
culminated in the only time Berry played session lead guitar for an artist other
than himself: two tracks by a studio group called the Ecuadors. Other rarities
on the set, aside from the unreleased tracks, include a pair of live versions of
Maybellene and Roll Over Beethoven Chuck recorded for Alan Freeds 1956 New
York Camel Rock n Roll Dance Party album, several original masters
overdubbed for the fake On Stage Chess album, and a number of recordings making
their U.S. CD debut.
The unreleased recordings include take 3 of Sweet Little Sixteen, which is one
of five versions of the song that tells the story of its recordingfrom its
demonstration record to two rejected (and intriguingly different) session takes
to the original master to the sped-up master finally released by Chess. There
are also unreleased alternate takes at different tempos than those released,
some with different lyrics, and one (for Broken Arrow) which features Chuck
Berry instructing his backup singers in their parts. And, finally, there is a
pair of previously unreleased 11 minutes-plus in-studio jams featuring Chuck
with pianist Johnnie Johnson, bassist Willie Dixon, and drummer Jasper Thomas
a blues called Long Slow Jam and a rocker called, suitably, Long Fast Jam
from 1958.
