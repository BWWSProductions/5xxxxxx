[T],RedHatcc,2010-07-02T03:05Z,"@elamre - seeding is greatly appreciated man!


HaxLi - sorry just common procedure for all my torrents. some people like to scan files before the use them, so i .rar them to give users a feeling  of more security. 

@arulkarthik - thats odd, try using the win7 activator in my torrents (click my name the sort from highest seeder to lowest, should be near the top) or open a thread in our forums our members can help you. "

,rtlong,2010-09-22T10:27Z,"@RedHatcc Thank you so much for this awesome upload. I have been using it for a month or so now with zero problems, but now I fucked it up. I went and blindly deleted the ""System Reserved"" partition because I didn't like it or something. Except, it contained the bootloader, I guess... I had Windows recover the boot files and everything, it boots just fine again, but now the activation is no more. On logon it informs me that it is not Genuine. What did I do! I am asking the source of the hack, I think? Is there any way to repair the activation?? Thanks in advance..."
,rtlong,2010-09-22T10:53Z,@RedHatcc Never mind. I just grabbed your Windows 7 Activator Patch and used the WGA remover! Thanks a million for your efforts!
