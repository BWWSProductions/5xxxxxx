Meet Ogroff,the most bestial and savage backwoods killer in the history of French horror genre.This masked psycho randomly butchers random people doing random things in the forest including men,women and even kids.Extremely cheap and awful French slasher with tons of inept gore.The editing is extremely amateurish and there is often no sound.Even the voices have been added later.There are some random zombies thrown in for a good measure.The killings are nasty and inane including the scene in which the guy gets the hatchet in his face."Mad Mutilator" rips off "The Burning" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and it surely looks like Nathan Schniff's ultra low-budget gore fests.If you are into crude dismemberment,axe masturbation and leather masks watch this utter trash and be amazed how ridiculous it is.5 axes out of 10.

The quality of this movie isn't excellent, probably due to the rarity of the film itself! I mean come on, it's only got 30 votes on IMDB and has been out for nearing 20 years!
