Type Compilation 
Released April 07, 2005  

An eclectic selection of obscure tracks that doesn't make a very coherent compilation musically, but many of them feature sonic characteristics that Led Zeppelin utilised in their recordings, so really this is a sort of compilation of influences on Led Zeppelin's sound. Mainly of interest to Led Zep trainspotters and obsessive completists
