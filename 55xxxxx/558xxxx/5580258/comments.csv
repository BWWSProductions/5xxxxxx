,rocco_sifredi,2010-05-22T12:21Z,nicely done!
,doodlebox,2010-05-24T07:21Z,"Nice torrent. Downloaded great, but I tried everything, but it still says I have to insert the Oblivion disk after extracting the crack and plugins and whatnot. And if I try to use the crack, it says binkw32.dll was not found.
I'm kind of new to torrenting things, so is there any help?"
,giamevil,2010-05-24T08:46Z,"doodlebox ~ I am sorry to hear that, can you double check to make sure you put the crack and plugins in the right file. 

For windows xp and 32-bit vista and 7 it is C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\oblivion\Data

For windows vista and 7 64-bit ~ C:\Program Files(x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Data

If you have double checked that you have put them in the right spot, then i would suggest that you mount with daemon tools, because thats what i have tested it with on all of my computers. www.Daemon-Tools.cc and make sure securom, and all the other options are UNchecked, as this was the options set when i tested it. Sometimes, unfortunately you can get a bad download. If you need help feel free to E-mail me at Giamevil@aim.com ill help you the best i can.  "
,darklink11,2010-05-24T19:06Z,"HEY  sup giamevil 

just to know are u using only OFFICIAL plugins or some plugin are not!?


btw ur torrent look pretty perfect^^ downloadin righ now"
,doodlebox,2010-05-25T01:36Z,"Yeah, I mounted it using Daemon's Tools lite.

It seemed I had to download binkw32.dll from a website, and after I did that, it now says ""the procedure entry point _BinkCopyToBufferRect@44 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll""
I heard I had to reinstall the game for it to work, and after I did that it said the same thing. I guess I'm stuck?"
,doodlebox,2010-05-25T05:37Z,"Okay, everything's fixed. No help needed. Copied the bink file and moved it to the Data folder.
Anyways, the game starts up and goes well, but then when I try to start a new game, it says Yes/No, I select yes, it closes, and then nothing happens."
,giamevil,2010-05-25T08:41Z,"Yes these are official plugins. 

Doodle... Im thinking it might be a graphics issue....

But what im also having in mind, is that if you tried installing a different oblivion from a different torrent, that the registries got saved, and there is something wrong with that. The same thing was happening to me a while back, but i got a new computer.... Which means either graphics card, but if you have a good one, then im thinking the registry "
,Timmcm,2010-05-28T19:32Z,"hi Giamevil. problem: when i mount disc 1 it comes with the oblivion menu saying:
play
data files
options
elderscrolls.com
technical support
uninstall
exit

how do i install disk 1 because an installshield that installs it doesn't appear unlike disc 2 which asks me to install nights of the nine and shivering isles"
,Timmcm,2010-05-28T19:35Z,also where do i find the crack and plugins?
,Timmcm,2010-05-28T19:40Z,how do i reinstall the game? (sorry to be a pain)
,Timmcm,2010-05-29T00:16Z,sorry forget all those comments. i managed to get it working and there's no faults so 5 stars for you mate. well done
,delryne,2010-06-07T00:06Z,yeah giamevil i uploaded it and am seeding it but you surely have a lot of leechers srry to say cause it says i have 80 seeds and 101 leeechers
,delryne,2010-06-07T00:06Z,nope srry 106 now
,spark89,2010-06-07T06:24Z,this 1 is not that great it will not load even win u make it in to a iso
,Psy.mon,2010-06-08T06:00Z,"I've done everything..
Still doesn't work, tried Daemon Tools lite, no different than MagicISO, didn't work..
Did I miss something:
unzipped & installed disk 1&2
unzipped cracks & whatnot
Put them in Data file
Tried to mount..
Nothing to mount..
Game doesn't run, it wants the CD..
It seems like I'm not alone in having this problem, any suggestions?"
,Psy.mon,2010-06-08T06:07Z,Do I need to unzip all the Data files and engin32.cap inside disk 1&2 in Miro and move them into Oblivions Data file on my computer as well?
,Psy.mon,2010-06-08T07:42Z,"So,
I found my old copy of Oblivion (non GOTY w/ no plug-ins)

Put it in and tried it, AND IT WORKED! I was stoked..

So,
My problem is resolved, I guess..
But I would still like to know if it was just me forgetting to do something..

Peace,
Psy.mon"
,Jaitsu,2010-06-11T21:36Z,is it safe to assume that this particular version (considering its GOTY version) works with most to all mods including the oblivion overhaul?
,FECracker,2010-06-16T13:04Z,"doodlebox (or anyone else if they can help), would you mind linkning to the site where you got the .dll file?
I tried a torrent like this before and it needed that file, but the last time I downloaded the binkw32.dll, it was from some dodgy website, which crashed my computer.

Giamevil, many thanks - it looks good. Can't wait 'til it's done."
,tizgal0094,2010-06-16T19:30Z,"Ok, so everything went well on the installing and mounting, but I have a small problem.  Everytime I press play, a small, black box shows up on the top left corner of my screen, then after a few seconds, Windows says ""Oblivion has stopped working, Windows is checking for a solution to the problem"" (or something similar to that),  then the program closes. Is there anyway I can solve this? My OS is Windows 7, and I have all the games minimum requirements. Any and all help is appreciated."
,Nellybui,2010-06-16T20:42Z,"Nice torrent man ! Easy to install, good job =)
I just have to say that if you have Windows 7, you have to run it in XP compatibility. In the folder you installed the game, you have 2 .exe files. One named OblivionLauncher.exe and an other named Oblivion.exe. Put Oblivion.exe in XP compatibility. And just run OblivionLauncher.exe :)"
,Nellybui,2010-06-16T20:45Z,"tizgal0094, do what i wrote above, it will solve your problem =)"
,tizgal0094,2010-06-16T22:33Z,Thanks Nellybui. Works fine now. :)
,Nellybui,2010-06-16T22:52Z,Np =)
,atclaeys,2010-06-18T05:17Z,Big thanks to those seeding at 500+kb downloads!!!
,FECracker,2010-06-19T16:28Z,"Have now seeded about 13Gb.  Will probably be leaving it on for the the remainder of June and most/all of July.

I really recommend everyone and anyone to download this game - it is easy enough to complete to be considered a game not for hardcore gamers, but equally has enough sidequests to give it a gamelife of over 60 hours. And then you start again as a different race!

Still requesting if anyone can link me to a website which they trust which will allow me to download binkw32.dll

Many thanks again to Giamevil :D"
,giamevil,2010-06-22T18:01Z,"Im not sure how anyone is installing this wrong. This is probably the easiest torrent for oblivion. Its really self explanatory. Mount disk 1, install, mount disk 2, install, go to crack, copy and paste the crack in to data folder. play. Its not rocket science. Some of you are just taking it way to technical or something. Its not hard. Theres been, over 500 downloads, as of now, and only like 5 of you cant figure it out. There is a detailed readme included in this, and if you are new at this. If you follow it, it is dead on. I didnt leave anything out. 

Anways, if you experience ANY problems. Go to www.systemrequirementslabs.com and select oblivion, and it will scan your computer, and tell you if you can play oblivion or not. 

Happy gaming!!!!!

?Giamevil?"
,splamadoo,2010-06-25T23:13Z,"ok i'll start off by saying this was a great game untill one day I tried to play and the game crashed after i tried to play. It loaded alright, got to the menu, i press continue, it loads about half then crash. ""Oblivion has encountered a problem and needs to close"" anyone wanna help?"
,Chris98999,2010-06-27T06:49Z,"This torrent has very poor seeding... I took a nap for 14 hours... I have downloaded 1 GB so far, and uploaded 25 GB. I'm going to turn off my upload altogether if I don't get some decent speed soon"

,ohno147,2010-07-03T18:31Z,"Okay, so i'm pretty new at torrenting(started yesterday) I've been trying to find so many copies of Oblivion because I personally miss that game, okay so, i've been having the same problem over and over again, either it won't let me download the torrent from frostwire or tixati, I also found this great version of the game, it goes up to a installshield, yet after a while it says the file is wrong, if anyone has a solution please message me at Ohno147@hotmail.com, I'm constantly on windows live messanger, sorry for the offtopic post."

,RetroViruses,2010-07-05T08:04Z,"Hi, are we supposed to get the crack from another source? Because it isn't in the Rar, so I assume so...just some confirmation would be nice..."

,Altec71,2010-07-06T03:47Z,"hey FECracker, if you still need that binkw32.dll
you can go to nodevice.com, i used them to recover missing dll files sometimes,  went there after a dll file went missing from my playstation emulator folder.

although i would scan the download every now and then, just to be safe :)"
,koukister,2010-07-06T18:22Z,"Hey,

i have to say it worked well. the game works also well and gongrats to you Giamevil, but some files cannot open... i mean some plugins (in the folder ""plugins"" in disk 2) so i cannot install them too. it is probably cause i dont have a certain program to open them... could you tell me please what program should i download in order to make them open? 

P.S. i used daemon tools but nothing :/"
,giamevil,2010-07-07T05:04Z,"Koukister

some of them dont ""Autoplay"" 
Solution 1:
so when u mount it, go to ""My Computer"" and right click the Virtual drive. (If you dont know, right click daemon tools and it should say Device 0: [?] the ? is the letter in which ou should do the following) Right click and clock open, and look for setup.exe and double click it. and it should install.

Solution 2: Easiest
Right click and make new folder and drag the plugin that doesnt work into it. ThenrRight click the plugin, and click extract here. "
,prince88011,2010-07-08T06:30Z,"I saw some gameplay on my friends computer of this game, and Fallout 3 is a CARBON COPY of this (uses the same engine as well). This I have to check this out."

,lunfear,2010-08-06T19:00Z,"i downloaded and installed everything according to the read me, so no problem there, but every time I try to launch the game I get an error ""Oblivion has encountered a problem and needs to close"" 

so I was wondering if it had anything to do with the graphics card, I checked up and found out that my graphic card can support Oblivion

Any ideas???"
,Alejandrote,2010-08-06T20:03Z,"Hi all.

I have just downloaded Oblivion, installed both CD's, started to play normally (although on very low graphics because of my computer) but when I arrive at the hole leading to the sewers and try to enter there, the game crashes and I get that Windows message saying that Oblivion has encountered a problem and must close.

I have reinstalled the game but the game still crashes at the same moment.

Does someone know what is happening and how to slove this problem ?

Thanks very much. :)"
,silencesummer,2010-08-09T00:18Z,"Thanks uploader, version worked perfect, instructions were clear (got a little confused on the CUT and paste part, basically you only need to extract one file from the plugins folder) and torrent downloaded fast (thanks all seeders).

@lunfear, I had the same error (x1950PRO card here), what solved it for me was turning off my second display, and making sure my first display matched the resolution I was playing the game on. Hope that helps any whom were having the crash at startup error."
,neekitz,2010-08-09T01:38Z,"Thank you uploader for the upload, I was hoping you could help me fix the problem I am having though. This is the second separate version of the game I have downloaded and am experiencing the same problem, so I know the problem must be with my computer. I went over all of the included readme files and there was no mention of this issue. I have also searched via google but could not find anyone else with a similar problem. I have Windows XP Pro svc pack 2, my system requirements slightly exceed the minimum requirements. I was able to install Fallout 3 with complete success yesterday.

When I mount the image on PowerIso and run Oblivion Launcher, the oblivion startup menu appears but the only selectable options are the link to oblivion.com and the exit option. I cannot start the install, I can only exit the window. I can provide a screenshot if needed. Thank you anyone that can help me figure this out!"

Any idea what the issues is? "
,necrocide,2010-08-11T02:32Z,"Cheers giamevil for the up, I'll assume this works fine since the original oblivion had no copy protection whatsoever. "
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-08-11T23:06Z,"Downloading now. I've never actually played this game before believe it or not, looks interesting. I'm assuming it's from the same people who did the Fallout series since it looks so similar to FO3.

,Angelsbane12,2011-01-12T09:08Z,"just wondering, but would there happen to be a plugin in your torrent called ""the Fighters Stronghold"" ? "
,Handsome_Hawk,2011-01-15T19:56Z,Will try thiiis sheeeiiiiit
,mijay1991,2011-01-18T13:21Z,"Downloaded epicly quick.  Great program, have an issue though.  It's probably resulting from my computer stats, however, I load up the Oblivion Launcher and windows error reporter decides it would be fun to brain fuck me and shuts it down.  I am running XP, not 7.  I have minimum specs.  I have to run Oblivion in Medium detail.  I've read all other comments to gain some insight.  Seems this has happened with quite a few others running 7 (which is the best OS in my professional opinion :]) Anyways I probably won't check this again for an update, if you are replying to this please shoot me an email, I will hurt spammers, yowasup20@yahoo.com"
,Classic00,2011-01-26T19:08Z,"Ok so I just finished downloading and opened the file with a thing called IZArc. But when I go to mount the Image on Daemon it won't show up, what can I do?"
,mijay1991,2011-01-27T11:33Z,"Alright, I am back with new pc specs.  Got mad and bought a new pc.  Hopefully this one will be okay.  Per www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/ I far exceed the requirements.  In fact it says I'm fast, we'll see what happens when I download it again.  Still good speeds though."
,YourStepDad,2011-01-30T18:55Z,"""There is most of the plugins in this torrent. The ones included are the ones in my opinion that are worth having. 

What an attitude, and WHAT are these plugins you thought are not worth having?

This torrent is trash, if you are so lazy you cannot name the content included in this torrent you shouldn't be allowed to upload torrents.

Also, keep dreaming about that skull. You suck.
