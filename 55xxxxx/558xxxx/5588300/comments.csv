,Spurty,2010-07-13T05:30Z,Is this version censored?
,1eyedfishstick,2010-08-01T09:28Z,"Yes this version is censored because it is from PBS TV, not from the DVD.

Worse is that is was ripped in the wrong aspect ratio. It is supposed to be 16x9 but it is 4x3 so the movie is squished. 

If you have a TV or player like VLC that can stretch it, great. Otherwise it's crap. 

If you enjoy watching movies that are squished or are too stupid to tell the difference then download away."
,lestatvvvvvv,2010-09-25T00:20Z,"@ 1eyedfishstick  for someone who has zero torrents going you have alot of bitching going on, it may not be 100% or done perfectly but at least Jugz decided to take the time and all to share what he has .
Nobody on here has to share anything , they do so because they want to keep the torrents flowing some torrents will be better than others but , but don't put down those who have taken the time and energy to share what they have.
It may not be the best video quality to your standards, why dont you go find the dvd and put up the 16x9 uncensored version? Otherwise I feel those of us dling any torrent should thank the uploader for you cant beat the price here ..... look at other sites you need to register and pay a fee , here you can come and get anything you want. So if you dont like the quality of this one then dont download it of keep it, but dont put down anothers efforts for shareing"
