,Myrkd,2010-09-18T21:14Z,You guys cracked Dragon age orgins awakening yet? or recommend any to work with your version 
[T],Games4theworld,2010-10-19T14:37Z,"Hello,

@Myrkd

I think it is on our Request -list. Meanwhile, I think all other Uploader's versions would work. Just apply the Cracks correctly."
,RememberJesse,2010-10-20T14:36Z,"So dude, the torrent is great, it ran pretty fast for me. But then when I start up the installation, it asks for a disk.

[T],Games4theworld,2011-01-09T01:02Z,"Hello,

@RememberJesse

No, you forgot to apply the crack. Please re-do the crack part and copy the crack to the correct folder, as described in the Installation Guide.

@jthurst93

Please update your Graphic Card drivers to the latest version, restart your PC and see if it works.

@drtruedat

There's no need to Mount anything, just open the .rar file you downloaded using WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org, and select Ã¡ll the files in the .rar file.
Drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When done, open that folder and read the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" on how to install the game.

@khalifa1942

No, this is no .ISO and in English. I don't know a French version, sorry. (Maybe you can change the language in-game)"

[T],Games4theworld,2011-03-17T22:27Z,"Hello,

@rajeevrn

You can request Games / Software via our Forum: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com .

@marackulus

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

,B3ff3ct,2011-04-06T16:52Z,"Hi -

not sure If I was able to post my comment here. I completed this game 2 weeks ago.  Another game from Bioware that doesn't disappoint.  another epic game.  followed instructions and everything worked well for me.  Same with MAss effect 1 & 2.  now working on the DLCs.

I appreciate the guys from Games4theworld.  I just hope I can help you guys out some other way.  For now, I'm going to continue seeding.

All -

Anyone here who can point me to a working DA: Awakening download?

Thanks!"
