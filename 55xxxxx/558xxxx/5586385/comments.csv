,yoker36,2010-05-24T16:41Z,uÂ´re the best :)
,mx_phreek,2010-05-24T20:53Z,"Thanks slick. You have done a great job as usual. Only watched 450's up to now, not quite as sharp as usual in detail but i am betting it more to do with the speed broadcast as you have the encoding off to a tee. Its amazing how much more detail you have managed to get for a extra 400 meg on last year 700 meg rips. Keep up the good work mate."
,slicknick610,2010-05-25T01:38Z,Yeah I have always noticed that the outdoor series looks worse than the supercross series. I wonder if they use less quality cameras because they need so many and they could be damaged by rain. I did not change anything in my process.
,JohnnyRickard,2010-05-25T21:21Z,"wish you would go back to your old settings when i were able to watch your uploands. have tried k-lite and all other codec's I could find, but nothing works. get freezed frame all the time and the sound doesn't kepp up. haven't complained until now because of the tvteam's supercross releases. so please, no more hd 720p! :*("
,jeffro30,2010-05-25T23:22Z,"JohnnyRickard I really think is there is nothing bad with this uploads, for me they all work good on K-lite, VLC, or any other player with codecs.....The only thing I have notice is VLC is noto that good with high quality videos.....so I use K-lite.....it has to be your PC, give it try on other PC to see  how it works....or maybe you should try another OS."
,akito76,2010-05-25T23:33Z,"Same shit for me. Mine just Plays like it is in slow motion but the sound is normal speed. And I am desperate to find out what the hell is wrong with my PC. I treid everything from K-lite, VLC to KMDPlayer, but nothing has worked for me."
,jeffro30,2010-05-26T00:11Z,"why don't you guys try to reinstall the k-lite, and on the custom installation, be sure of mark all the mp4 and mpeg4 extension....maybe that can help."
