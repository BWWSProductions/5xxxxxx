I was hoping that more would bring their finished and partial files into this from the original seeding to fill in some of the gaps, it may just take a little time for users to notice this new torrent. If this doesn't happen, it could be awhile, my speeds aren't that fast and I have no control over the router ;-), this is why I didn't just put up a complete torrent to begin with. In any case, I'll stick with it, and eventually it'll get done. Maybe I can find a faster hot spot, we'll see how it goes."
