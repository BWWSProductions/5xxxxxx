Paul Rodgers is no stranger to the music community. Mr. Rodgers has been performing on stage 
for 41 years, and has worked with some of the best artists in the rock and blues genre. He has 
not just worked with them; they request him, which shows his level of talent and professionalism. 
When Queen asks you to perform with them, you know you have arrived. When they ask you to 
tour with them, not only have you arrived; you have arrived first class. Rodgers not only sings, 
but he plays several instruments including the guitar, piano, bass, drums, harmonica and flute. 
Aside from being a part of several successful groups, he also has six albums under his belt as a 
solo artist. Here, backed by a 5-piece band, Paul Rodgers displays his many talents in front of a 
live audience in Glasgow, Scotland..
