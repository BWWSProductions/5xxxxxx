-Game doesn't run ultra fast
-Everything works wonderfully (no lagging spots) as well as the install being just as described.
-Flashlight works
-Israeli music? wtf you talkin about :)
-Games clean no virus
-No errors whatsoever (whole time)
-Save games work fine

Gotta say... not many torrents work as well as described but this one gets two thumbs up and a middle finger to the haters with love LOL!!!!

,Pedevil,2011-07-26T09:45Z,"Game works fine thx

For those of you who hear shity music playing the game, its your own music that is on your pc that starts playing. :p

the best solution i found is just quicksave and quickload again (takes about 3 sec.)
that should stop it.

thx again for the good upload"

The downloaded file is just a 'file'.  When I try to open it, I get a list of programmes to run it with.  I've tried most of them, in vain.

Any help?

I'm running Windows 7, 64 bit."
,TProdigy,2011-08-30T07:48Z,"igsey: from an earlier comment, it looks like it's a .RAR file. Download winrar, the trial. The program says it expires in 40 days, but never does."

I've had problems with the HEV suit sound on a legal copy of the game. It crashed and then the sound looped until I hit the next save point. I think it's just buggy."
,Calliopic,2012-04-09T20:30Z,"I just downloaded and installed the game. I'm playing it with no problems. Thanks for the awesome torrent! 

Hilariously, the game runs smoothly on my six-year-old, piece-of-shit laptop, but the Steam application won't. All of the shiny interfaces and blinged-out graphics make my computer seize up. So I gave up on a legal install and had to torrent it."
