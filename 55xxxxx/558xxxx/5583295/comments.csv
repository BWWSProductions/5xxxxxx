,vivek36929,2010-06-23T15:39Z,"decent rip at pretty decent size
thanks YIFY"
,Azgamer,2010-07-06T21:02Z,The audio and video are slightly out of sync.
,Azgamer,2010-07-06T21:09Z,"Using VLC player you can adjust the audio/video sync very easily.

Tools > Track Sync

I found that -0.30 made things about right, but you can tinker with it of course."
,Frogger89,2010-08-01T10:44Z,lol robert padison was in this movie xD

,cj4thee,2010-12-21T06:15Z,"I have uploaded Harry Potter (1-6) collection in small size

Follow this link:

Enjoy!!!

P.S. The sixth movie's credit goes to YIFY. Its his work after all. i just put them together. "
,0-LSD-0,2010-12-22T12:01Z,"Audio is off. There's a few times the picture pisses about, especially with white surfaces. I noticed the last one which you uploaded, Azkaban, was off by about a millisecond. This one is off by about 5. Downloading VLC as someone mentioned to see if that works."
,Anti11,2010-12-23T16:12Z,"Great seeding and quick download. But at such a low bitrate 720p does not make any sense at all. If you plan to play on an HD TV, resolution will be poor every time there is movement, and heavy pixelation is evident in many scenes. 
Sound is also mediocre, off synch and as it is only sampled at 24 KHz and 2 channels. A far cry from a 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS.
So, download it only if you plan to watch it on your laptop."
,makinho,2011-01-24T14:30Z,"can you upload harry potter and the deathly hallows?
thnx"
,klick_ken,2011-04-06T17:20Z,thanks! i'm gonna download all your harry potter torrents! and seed it of course...
,marrydwth4kids,2011-05-20T06:59Z,can you please upload harry potter and the order of the pheonix.ty . there is like only 5 uploads for that one and they are not very good.
,redched,2011-06-10T18:52Z,"a 10

,Pwnage94,2011-07-04T04:16Z,"wooww for those ppl who say ""wtf 600mb BRRIP?? who do u think we are....blahblahblah"" this movie is in new format called mkv. which compresses the movie to half its original size. this movies approx size is 1.3gb. only Divx Payer is really good player for this kinda movie so suck it up and get yur facts straight. nice post bro V:10 A:10 :))"
,azwtf,2011-07-13T06:27Z,"You're fucking blind if you're rating this copy at 10/10. I've watched plenty of HD MKV videos from this site. This is by far the worst. The video is blotchy, there was ghosting in one scene early on, and audio falls in and out of sync.

If this wasn't listed under the Highres section of TPB, it could pass with a 10 for video. Judging this copy against a far superior quality copy barely warrants a 4 for video. I'm downloading a better 3GB copy from a much more reliable supplier. Better to wait 40 minutes for a different copy than have to sit through any more of this.

Just so we're clear, I'm not mad at the uploader. He can upload whatever the fuck he wants. I'm pissed at the clearly retarded asswads who leave misleading comments saying this is a perfect download. A-10 / V-10 implies flawless you bloody morons."
,chanchan46,2011-07-16T22:20Z,"Thank you for this nice small download, YIFY, will be seeding, too :)

V=9

@azwtf : If you can't appreciate the work of uploaders who let you have movies for free, just don't pollute comments with your wannabe ""oh I'm such a pro critic"" who can't even write 2 words without saying fuck (big vocabulary) and go play with your pimples, kid. 

We don't care about your whining. 
Get a life."
,hitokiriyetz,2011-07-17T01:38Z,one of the best harry potter uploader here in TPB..keep it up dude..thanks!
,shk28,2011-07-18T12:59Z,"Another Great Upload!! ^___^

No Doubt YIFY Is The Best Uploader For HD Movies!!! 
\m/

Keep On Uploading YIFY!!"
,mendota,2011-07-19T08:18Z,"again, not actually high-definition. it's heavily compressed and there are plenty of artifacts.

this download is NOT a faithful blu-ray rip. it's a small file for small screens."
,Monster1512,2011-07-20T07:14Z,"Lol strange, im watching this on windows media player on a 24"" Full HD monitor, with k-lite mega codec pack and it is awesome.

Video: 10/10
Audio: 10/10 
and not out of sync

Thanks for the great upload :)"
,ivansama,2011-07-20T10:59Z,@mendota  lol you're such an asshole. don't pretend to be a pro critic. if you don't like it buzz off

Awesome YIFY. Keep up good uploads."
,Millor1,2011-08-13T00:58Z,"I like the people saying that this is actually good quality, and then telling everyone who says it isn't that they shouldn't pretend to be a pro critic... Are you fucking retarded? no ones trying to be a pro critic, they're just trying to give a real fucking A/V quality.

The quality of this version is fucking awful... the other YIFY uploads weren't as bad but its really noticeable how bad this one is. Just because you can ""deal with it"" doesn't mean its worth anything over a 6 in quality... but this version is probably a 4 on A/V... the audio is out of sync a lot, there's a lot of blotchiness and nothing is very clear, and several times audio popped and/or the video become distorted. Just like what was said before, the uploader can upload whatever the fuck he wants, if people don't mind dealing with it, that's cool. But don't kiss the uploaders ass when the quality is shit, because its not like he's going to fucking be like ""Wow they really like this version, ill upload a better quality!""... because they wont. If the ever were going to re upload a better quality... it would because everyone let the guy know, one of his movies... is in really shitty quality."
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-08-17T01:46Z,"@Millor1 and filmcrave I really cant see these massive faults you are stating. I seen two glitches whille playing this on my 32"" Audio and video is perfect Bar the 2 video glitches and even with that i cant say its less than 10 for vid and audio.

,azepos,2011-09-08T13:14Z,great torrent. nice quality. thank you YIFY. a/v 9/8
,xiIix,2011-09-28T00:27Z,"PFFFFFF!!!!! ServiusTheBear are you fucking SERIOUS?? 10 out of 10 is a raw 1080p BLURAY!! I've been a non-linear editor for over 13 years, and there isn't a single, solitary frame in this ENTIRE file that doesn't have a slew of artifacts. And not just artifacts, but GHOSTING and TRAILING artifacts. He didn't even TRY to soften the artifacts either. He literally just set the bitrate with a ceiling of around 700kb/s and let it rip. Unreal.

I already have a raw 1080p of this, but when I saw the comments, I just had to download it and see for myself. I am BLOWN AWAY that anyone can sit there and say ""awesome dude!! 10/10 keep it up!!"". What -- the -- fuck? Have any of you even SEEN what a raw 1080p bluray looks like on high dollar hardware with edge and sharpness enhancements etc..? You can see the peach fuzz on peoples faces and the pores on their noses!! You can see individual hairs on their head. THAT is V10 A10! 

My honest rating for this, is an audio of 5 and a video of 2. Absolutely no excuse for anyone to think they can get away with a bitrate this low with a resolution this high. Just because there are people with poor eyesight and/or soft displays saying this rip is fine, doesn't mean they're right, it just means that, for some reason; they can't see the amount of detail we can.

Audio sometimes does not sync with video, it's not too noticeable but it is a little annoying. Thanks!"
,frumpypanda,2012-01-17T04:30Z,"hey xiIix, or however you spell that faggot ass name. on behalf of all of us in the entire earth and universe; SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU WHIIIIINY BIIIIIIITCH.
i'm sure you'd love to take it in the ass after watching two hairy studs ram each other in your precious blu ray setting where you can see the dimples and pores of each throbbing cock.

good job uploader, you have the sex of many supermodel women awaiting you with acdc playing in the background and heroin injections to the dick. :) rock on friend.
victory, or sovengarde!"
,grampa45,2012-04-08T19:31Z,my roomate is gonna love ya forever she has been waiting for this for a wile now thanks and btw i have never had a problem with any of your torrents they are top notch keep up the good work
,ChasUGC,2012-06-05T16:26Z,"@Millor1&xilix - Show me your uploads so I can see what you mean. What? Don't have any? I didn't think so, so STFU! You dickwads obviously work for the MIAA, otherwise you wouldn't be searching for movies where you already allegedly have the DVD, and then wasting 2 hrs re-watching it, just so that you can rag on it. Can you say stupid?!! Get a life, haterz!

LONG LIVE PIRATE BAY!!!! Thanks, YIFY. 
You Rock."
