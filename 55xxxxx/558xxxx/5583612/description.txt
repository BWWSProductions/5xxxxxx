> teenage insecurities, hopes and fears. Nell (the smart, cute girl) and Woody (the big dumb jock) 
> are two teenage rivals who find themselves in each others bodies after arguing in front of an 
> Aztec statue in a museum, which then transfers their souls as they sleep, causing them to awake
> in each other bodies. After trying to work things out but coming to no conclusion, 
> both Nell and Woody, inside each others bodies, begin ruining each others lives. 
> But after all this bickering, both of them soon discover that if they work together and help each other,
> a happy ending might turn out after all.
