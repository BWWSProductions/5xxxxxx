,CaptReg,2010-10-29T09:54Z,"Same here, stuck @ 64%.

If someone seeds to me, I'll seed it indefinitely! Forever!"
,cybercow222,2010-10-30T19:21Z,"also im in search for WebObjects 3.5/3.5.1 developer CD iso - w/key (for openstep), would pay for it ... who knows what's inside here as we are stuck ... "
,CaptReg,2010-11-02T00:33Z,"Not sure where you could get WebObjects.. 
Still stuck at 64%... Really want these Apps :(
All we need is one person to seed."
,cybercow222,2010-11-02T10:15Z,"Yea, i know, find anything for NeXT these days is a real pain in the az, people that have their private software collections are really tedious to share it. We hope this guy will wake up and reseed :}"
