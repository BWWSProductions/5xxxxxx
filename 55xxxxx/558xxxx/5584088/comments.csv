,tj00ts,2010-05-24T14:08Z,"Thanks a lot RiddlerA! I just registered here to thank you!

I absolutely love your uploads, keep up the good work :) I even set up my torrent client watching up your RSS feed and download new uploads right away. I have made myself a promise I will seed every single torrent to ratio +5.0 ;)

One thing I could ask though is your tracker list. It has a lot of trackers, which many of seem to be pretty hideous, some offline and some just otherwise bad. I would suggest you to use generally well-proved trackers like:

// PublicBitTorrent, reliable and rock solid
http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

// Tracker from OpenTracker's developers, very good one too
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com/announce

// OBT-copy from Kyrgyzstan, away from MAFIAA etc.
http://tracker.openbittorrent.kg:2710/announce

// The reliable tracker of 1337x, choose either this or genesis.1337x.org
http://exodus.1337x.org/announce

and then deny all the rest.

Most of people will use DHT+PEX on their clients for finding other peers so trackers any not that necessary. Those I listed are generally good to have in-case client doesn't have DHT-support etc. Including too much trackers to torrents just cripple up your network and may even pose security risk if you accidentally put an fake tracker provided by an anti-piracy organization there.

Thanks a lot for your uploads!

[V],RiddlerA,2010-05-24T18:38Z,"@ tj00ts

Thanxs man for all the interest & support shown by You :)
On Trackers ......... I keep on experimenting with them ........ Adding the ones which work & removing the ones which don't
I monitor my torrents on Torrentz also
Many trackers are already tracking my torrents, I have just added them to my Torrents
The addition of trackers have made my torrents reach more people, in my observation
I will try the trackers u have suggested
I know 2-3 trackers are more or less sufficient if one is using DHT .......... but as i said I keep on experimenting 
I have heard using large no of trackers affect ur swarm & create problem for Leechers ......... but no one has uptill now complained regarding this"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-05-24T18:40Z,"@ timewarp93 

No problem :)
Don't take tension & cheers"
