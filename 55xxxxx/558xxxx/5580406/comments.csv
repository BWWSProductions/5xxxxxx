[T],rjordan21,2010-05-22T17:39Z,"Clearly the best out of the three.  I used ""Money"" to compare and also listened to the MFSL and Black Triangle versions.  It amazes me how much better vinyl consistently is.... even played back by budget equipment.  The decay of the cymbal splashes.... the tone of the sax.... the timing and pace.... the coherency of the musicians.  Vinyl simply sounds more like music.  "
[T],rjordan21,2010-05-22T17:47Z,"No the negative.... HMVinyl, these TT's you're using mask alot of the greatness that lives in the groove.  There is a veil over the music...as if David Gilmour is singing behind a towel. Consider this.  Look for a used Rega TT.  Check out Ebay.  I saw a Planar 3 for a few hundred dollars this morning.  Analog can be so MUCH better!  I applaud all you efforts though!  Anyone whose only heard this album on CD should be impressed. "
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-22T17:57Z,"I agree that the last two tt's werent that good, but this one is. it's been recently apraised at $650 i think this'll be my tt of choice for the next few years"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-22T21:01Z,"lol i didnt even listen to it before i commented, i was busy recording, so i just checked the file properties while i was waiting"
,]eep,2010-05-22T23:10Z,"Hi HMV, I think you've got the recording prettywell down and the tt is getting better. But there is still a loooong way to improve. There I agree with rjjordan. Have a look around for Pro-ject or Music Hall. Best deals depend a bit on where you live. "
,JohnTheBastard,2010-05-25T08:55Z,Check out audioclassics.com if you haven't.  Some day I'll own a McIntosh tube amp...
,JohnTheBastard,2010-05-25T19:46Z,"Oh, and another request, since you didn't like Radiohead... how about Spoon's
vinyl catalog. If you hate Spoon, too, I'm not sure there is any hope for you. 

I am largely skeptical of vinyl releases of music produced in the past decade, 
as its mostly mixed for CD and digital distribution. I doubt many bands care 
enough to do another mix for vinyl when it accounts for such a tiny fraction 
of album sales, but hopefully they at least gets us out of the dynamic compression 
bullshit.

Anyway, here is how I would prioritize Spoon's vinyl releases, so if I can only have one:

1. Gimme Fiction
2. Kill the Moonlight
3. Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga
4. Transference
5. Girls Can Tell

BTW, what are people using as their set-up for playback.  I don't have any hi-fi equipment, and the line-out on my laptop sounds quite dirty anyway.  My best results for getting good sound reproduction is to transcode to Apple lossless and play back on a solid-state iPod with a pair of Etymotic's ER-6is. I think my most cost-effective way to improve this set-up is to pick up a Headroom Total Bithead headphone amp from headphone.com."
,JohnTheBastard,2010-05-26T06:56Z,"Me again.  I cleaned up one of the tracks with BIAS SoundSoap. It can be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5590696/Pink_Floyd_-_The_Great_Gig_in_the_Sky_[vinyl]_cleaned_with_Sound

I think its a substantial improvement and would appreciate feedback on the quality from anyone that downloads both and compares them."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-05-27T02:48Z,"i use Sony Noise Reduction Pro 2.0. works great for me, i'd run it at a higher ""cleaning"" rate but i worry that it's reducing the sound quality, as i've done a lot of test with it.

and yeah sorry John i've never even heard of ""Spoon"" I don't really listen to mainstream music anymore, unless they REALLY catch my attention (e.g Gorillaz for the maticulious work they put in)

but vinyl records drop in my lap everyday so if one turns up i'll put it on just for you :)

NEXT: Billy Joel - The Stranger"
,JohnTheBastard,2010-05-27T04:11Z,awesome.
,retardoface,2010-06-03T03:17Z,"Hey HMVinyl ive been downloading vinyl records for a bit now, yours are good man buat you really should do some click removal, it doesnt demote the quality at all. I know this site where they are uploading SUPERVINYL and audiophil shit that sounds amazing, and they do click removal, it absolutely is amazing.


I gotta say thanx though to you for getting me into the vinyl downloads in the first place, baut after i found this site i must say that they are quite amazing, your original vinyls with click removal would be fucking amazing"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-03T17:53Z,"hey retardoface, i appriaciate all your downloading and comments :D i'v been using click removal all along, but I don't go to heavy on it. 

maybe what i'll do i release another sample torrent that shows how it can degrate the quality.
also you should check out the most recent torrent i put up:

,flaming_ninja,2010-06-22T12:31Z,"Hey HMV, I really appreciate what you're doing, but a lot of your rips seem to be really loud, especially considering that they're vinyl rips. One of the reasons I got away from CDs is that they can to be as much as 10 dB louder on average than their vinyl counterparts, which means less dynamic range and more clipping. Lowering those peak levels (less clipping) and reducing the amount of compression (higher dynamic range) is usually more important than a lossless compression versus a lossy compression or 16/44.1 versus 24/96 sampling, as far as the listener's experience is concerned.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers' album Stadium Arcadium is a great example of what I'm talking about. The CD version (Vlado Meller) is compressed to the point at which the guitar solos often turn into unintelligible noise and Anthony Kiedis' voice is frequently clipped (a la Californication). I think the CD has an average loudness of about -11dB. The vinyl version of the album was mastered by Steve Hoffman and is about 9.5dB lower in RMS, with the peak levels effectively equal ( = amazing sound, especially John Frusciante's guitar). Btw, if you do take this advice at all and if you happen to come across the vinyl version of this album, I'd love to see a 24/96 rip of it."

,warriorbest,2010-09-14T16:58Z,i have a question: i can play this flac files but if i want to burn the cue file with Img burn than it says that i need directshow filter but i don't understand that. can you please help me?
[T],rjordan21,2010-10-24T18:22Z,"warriorbest,  you convert any flac file to WAV with this free program:

http://download.cnet.com/Pazera-Free-Audio-Extractor/3000-2140_4-10820817.html

and then burn to disc....... I don't use Foobar so I'm unfamiliar with that program.  Hope it helps."
,thermal_audio,2010-12-13T16:51Z,"hi,

i have to say i'm very pleasantly surprised to find a vinyl capture archive project going on if only unofficially.


question
is there a forum for vinyl snatchers/capturers/archivers?  to discuss process issues, hardware, software, tubes, preferred equipment debatable issues etc?

seems it's being done or not in pirate bay messages and that seems a bit odd.

i thought the 'bay got busted?  that's another story i guess.

i guess an example issue would be recording levels.  i thought the range was supposed to be -18dB to -6dB peaking leaving headroom for ""ooops"".

i'm not knockign anyone's efforts understand just wondering if there's a forum for this kind of stuff.


"
,thermal_audio,2010-12-13T19:04Z,"again i am very supportive of vinyl capture efforts.

i'm not slagging anyone.

just compared ""breathe"" HMV version vs MFSL 24/192 in ape lossless.  

i prefer the MFSL version.  rich full and there is a nice crisp high end.  a fine example of stunnig vinyl hifi

also the cybmals decay nicely.
not much ""S"" distortion to speak of if any.  

i don't find the high end as nice in the HMV version.  the cymbals seem to decay a little abrubtly or not as smoothly.  also some ""S"" distortion.

just MO.

i'm not attributing the difference to the higher bitrate either.  if a higher grade cartidge and stylus were used for the MFSL version that could account for it.

also the quality of the source vinyl etc.  the usual stuff.

also noise reduction can induce high end artifacts in my experience.  HMV doesn't say if any is used or not.  i've run into problems with digital scrubbing messing up really delicate stuff like cymbals.
