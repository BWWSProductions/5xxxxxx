,FreddyMills,2010-05-25T20:52Z,So why don't you seed?
,pooper55,2010-05-25T22:27Z,with no preview it doesn't matter how beautiful you think you are
,dobiebarns,2010-05-25T23:41Z,"Min sweet and so innocent Thai girl.  Have small hips and breast.  Small round bottom never touched by boy!  Must have man, not know what do!  Please help!"
,fubaru,2010-05-26T02:44Z,"Sorry, can't help you if the author won't seed the damn thing. No seeds in the last hour."
,dobiebarns,2010-05-26T04:30Z,May not PhilFree no how seed!  PhilFree try seed now.
,rainagain777,2010-05-26T04:41Z,"He's busily putting up vids in video/other too, all unseeded. Phil, the trackers are broken, unless you enable DHT on your torrent client, you're wasting your time."
,PhilFree,2010-05-26T06:11Z,"Sorry you guys, but I don't understand why I am not seeding?
My DHT is enabled, and I have checked the 'initial seeding' in all my torrents.
My computer has been on 24/7, so please advise further if you see I am not seeding."
,rainagain777,2010-05-26T06:30Z,"Still nada. What client are you using? I just did one yesterday using utorrent, no problems. Basic default settings too."
,PhilFree,2010-05-26T06:41Z,I'm using Bittorrent.
,jojcoc,2010-05-26T07:21Z,change to utorrent!!! 24/7????
,anton300,2010-05-26T08:23Z,"...hey PhilFree , check (START SEEDING ) leave initial seeding alone ,I'm using Bit torrent and works fine "
,PhilFree,2010-05-26T09:45Z,"anton300, where exactly do I find 'start seeding'?
I only see 'start' on my menus, and after I start, I get a 'seeding' message."
,rainagain777,2010-05-26T10:57Z,Phil figured it out
,anton300,2010-05-26T14:52Z,"...go to file , open menu , click (create New Torrent) open window ,at the bottom part find (other) there's 2 boxes to check (Start Seeding ) and (preserve file order) click this two ."
,anton300,2010-05-26T17:03Z,...yyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh  seeeeedddiiinnn  gg
,PhilFree,2010-05-26T18:15Z,"Cheers Anton, I followed your directions, and I already had those two boxes checked, but something I did along the way must have triggered it!
Problem is, ... I don't know what it was!
I think I need to make a test torrent before Min comes back?
Thanks again for your advice."
,anton300,2010-05-26T18:32Z,"...yes make a test torrent . when you open the window , torrent properties ,( trackers) , type the name of the tracker.

sample: http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

or any other of your preference..."
,PhilFree,2010-05-26T18:45Z,"Thanks Anton!
I'll set up my test torrent right now just to make sure this problem doesn't happen again.
Cheers!"
