Most of us Americans are dumb enough to take anything our government and media fed us with BUT interestingly, this movie is directed toward that small percentage which still has their CONSCIOUS, who questions what they see and hear. Its an effort to convince them that whatever our government is doing; is doing for good, maybe to make us safe!!!
The Question is.. would making more enemies really make us safe?
Its like living in the fools paradise by believing that making new enemies every now and then is making us safe. In the past, it was fear of Communism that led us to take down Germany & Russia. Now its terrorism to bash those poor Muslims, to take their resources and strengthen our grasp on World domination.
In my opinion; all of our Victims, Russia, Germany, Japan, Vietnam and so on.. has not forgot what we have done to them and so they are just waiting for the right time to take their revenge. Blood of Millions is on our hands; we can deny this fact but cannot escape it.

Cheers!"

As he said, ""i wanted to be here""...as the old saying goes, ""all is fair in love and war""...he wanted war, he got it and war is not pretty sissy ass...his constituents wanted to save two children and at the same time condemning more then a thousand times of our own as well as their parents and innocent children. Jackson should have finished the job with the children and he'd have spilled it all!! So in short you pansypanted fag, you sissy ass, punk who sits while good men and women give their lives so you can sit and run your shit trap, should be the one in the chair and then you'd know just how much we love this country...cause you my dear little cumsnacker, would have no more children nor would you be speaking anymore, nor would you see anymore, or walking anymore...and you'd live in a nutward where you'd live the rest of your speechless, blind, sterilized, gimpy life remembering the way your children were disassembled because YOU wanted to be a hero... and if you were lucky, nobody in the nutward would be aware of your bullshit and torture you til you finished dying...slowly...very slowly...that's what UNPATRIOTIC, TERRORIST SYMPATHIZING ASSES deserve except ten times what you saw in the movie...and then...finally we burn your worthless stubby corpse in front of the White House to show just how much we will tolerate such inhumane bullshit..."
,pjthunder,2010-06-03T10:00Z,"Now that I've had my rant, trparadox for someone that has never tasted war or even getting your sissy ass kicked in the street, you're awfully ignorant about why we did what we did and ya know why? Cause like most of the kids in our schools these days, they're being lied to about true history. But it's morons like you that shit their pants when in the shadow of a nuclear threat and don't wanna die and yet you want to sacrifice US for the sake of being nice to towelheads  and giving them rights they don't deserve, so in essence there little boy who sits in judgement of those that do the dirty work that keeps us free, GO FUCK YOURSELF!!"
,trparadox,2010-06-04T21:32Z,"@pjthunder
Simply PATHETIC!
I wont course you back cause what good it would do when all the world is coursing us 24/7. Its obvious that you are too young and blinded enough to see all sides of the box. You are seeing this situation in Black & White as our policy makers wants you to see. Maybe you'll get it when you start hearing other side of the story, when you hear the testimonies of those solders that quite army by realizing it was them who were terrorizing the whole world. Many countries have nuclear weapons but its only us who used it against a another nation. No wonder we fear an attack!"
,trparadox,2010-06-04T21:34Z,"Invading and bombing other countries will never make us safe and respected around the world.

In 2009, from Drone attacks alone on Afghanistan Pakistan border, more than 900 people were killed in which only 11 people were real targets, more than 889 were innocent men, woman and children. Now how can this be fair?? How we cannot expect their relatives to take revenge for those killings by fighting against our troops and if they do, we call them terrorist, extremist and what not. What an irony!!

Please realize before its too late."
