,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-08-29T13:51Z,Heard about this movie. Thought I'd give it a look. Appreciate the share.
,nonewbie,2011-03-03T03:37Z,"IMBD rates this 7.5 / 10

Video / Audio quality is perfect.
Shame the subtitles are in Chinese or something. Can anyone show me a link for english subtitles for this?"
,nymersic,2011-03-20T12:26Z,"Not entirely sure mr. no-newbie, [haven't downloaded it], but I'd bet the subs are both English and Chinese.  If you have a decent media player, you can switch which subs you're seeing.  If you're on Windows, I recommend Media Player Classic.  It'll do it."
