,BMKid,2011-10-15T12:55Z,"This is a great torrent. First things first: NOT THE ORIGINAL SCORE!!!! That's not a bad thing though. This version is the one with the score written in 1998 by Philip Glass and performed by the Kronos Quartet. So if you want to have an experience closer to what folks had back in the 30s, this isn't for you. BUT! It is an amazing score and technically the only ""real"" score ever written for this film. When originally released the movie was mostly unscored except for some generic songs Universal threw in in 2 scenes. Though I will admit, I totally equate that part from Swan Lake to this film and not hearing it durring the opening is definitely unnerving to me. However, I am also a fan of Kronos Quartet and the modern score in this version is amazing. In fact that makes me wish the person who made this had chosen something a little better than just 128kb/s CBR mp3 for the audio. Non-the-less, it still sounds good."
