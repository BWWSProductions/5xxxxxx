Took - This Funeral of Flowers

"It's very hard to describe this sonic heathen mystery created by this Ukrainian
collective. It's a mixture of various metal genres combined with acoustic, ambience,
dark and weird atmosphere. It's worth to listen if you are connoisseur of great music although the bad producing. The album was released as CDR and artwork printed with InkJet printer."
