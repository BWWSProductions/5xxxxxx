LMAO!!! Haven't you heard that 10% of users are using a MAC.  MS is about 80% and Linux holds its share around the 10% range as well.  You better check your facts before saying that Apple is bigger than Microsoft. As much as I would like to see this happen its not going to.  Apple would be dead if it wasn't for the iPhone and iPod"
