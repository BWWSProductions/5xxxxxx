REMEMBER THE SECRET POLICEMAN'S BALL?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Secret Policeman benefit shows for Amnesty International brought together
comedy grand masters - from Python and Beyond the Fringe - and performers then
relatively unknown, like Rowan Atkinson.

Narrated by Dawn French, the programme includes interviews with many of the
comedians and musicians who took part: John Cleese, Stephen Fry, Michael
Palin, Sting, Lenny Henry and many more.

The shows and their stars had a huge effect on modern British comedy. There
are few comics today whose careers have not been heavily influenced by the
anarchic and surreal humour of these events.

"I was kept naked in an underground cell. When the first 200 letters came, the
guards gave me back my clothes .... The letters kept coming, 3000 of them, and
the President called me to his office. He showed me an enormous box of letters
and said: "How is it that a trade union leader like you has so many friends
all over the world."
                                       Union leader in The Dominican Republic
                                      campaigned for by Amnesty International.

"Words are too poor to express the gratitude and thanks of my mother for the
return of her son, my wife for the return of her husband, and my children for
the return of their father.... You were the only organisation (as far as I
know) ...which raised its voice for the rights of citizens unjustly denied by
the government in power."
                                                          Timonsheno Pekmezi,
                                             Albanian prisoner of conscience,
                                   released by presedential decree following
                                         pressure from Amnesty International.

These are just two letters Amnesty International has received from people we
have worked for. They show what a difference individual members of Amnesty can
make.

Amnesty International was founded over four decades ago in 1961 when lawyer
Peter Benenson launched what was intended to be a year-long 'appeal for
amnesty' after reading about two Portuguese students jailed for drinking a
toast to freedom.
Today Amnesty International is a worldwide voluntary movement with more than 1
million members - including more than 180,000 in the UK - who campaign for
human rights. Our appeals for victims of human rights violations are based on
accurate research and on international law. We are independent of any
government, political ideology, economic interest or religion and to protect
our independence and impartiality, Amnesty is funded entirely from the pockets
of its members and from fundraising projects like this special box set - thank
you for your support.
By buying this box set you are supporting human rights worldwide. You can help
further by joining Amnesty International simply by calling 0845 60 120 60,
