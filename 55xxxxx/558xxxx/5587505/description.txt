EM Forster's personal passage to India was the key to both his great novel
and his political radicalism. What drew this shy and retiring figure from
British suburbia to the mysterious heart of a faraway subcontinent?

Taking a fresh look at the links between Forster's homosexuality, his
critique of the Raj and his remarkably modern capacity for crossing racial
and cultural borders, Zareer Masani rescues him from the stereotype of an
old-maidish, closeted gay, writing tea-table novels.
