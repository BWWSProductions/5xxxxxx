Even when I lived in Japan I couldn't find some films and so, well thank you. 

Especially in the climate we face ourselves, people like you who take the time, effort to share with others, due thanks and respect is due. 

Like many others here, I end up buying a great many of the films I download too ^^

Keep up the great work mate! "
