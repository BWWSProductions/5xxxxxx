,k7sparky,2010-05-23T15:08Z,I just checked using Windows Media player on the copy in my upload directory and it has full video and audio.  Might check your media player or plug-ins for AVI. The start is the DiscoVision sign on and goes to ABBA singing the first song in the recording studio.  I have played and watched these rips many times after making them.  Hope you get it figured out.  They are worth the effort
