[V],mothergoose56,2010-05-25T04:34Z,"This is a link to the May 22nd Unmasked with Colin Quinn, by request CF64K. 
It originally aired on ""Raw Dog"" Comedy 150 which is compressed even worse 
than 202. I was going to do a 128k up but there's no point. Also, even 
though I set it for an extra 5 minutes (guess I'll do 15 next time) it 
didn't get the whole show (it's 58 min 49 sec.) so no torrent from me.

Request... can you not have the show opening intro in the torrents... I am always just FF the 3 mins to the live hello start.

Thanks!"
[V],mothergoose56,2010-05-25T21:27Z,"Yea I usually fast forward through the intro as well, but I've always included it as it is technically the ""start"" of the show. They do occasionally change it, only Ecstasy of Gold stays the same permanently. I've done it that way for over a year, as annoying as it is to FF changing it now would be odd for me. Yea I know, obsessive compulsive much?

However, I will do it if it's what the peeps who download it want. So - please let me know - should I keep the 4 minute+ daily intro or start with ""Enough of this palaver""?

Make your case one way or another and I'll side with the majority. "
,mancation,2010-05-26T16:43Z,fast forward is easy enough...either way is fine for me.  thanks
