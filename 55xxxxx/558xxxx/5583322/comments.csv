,dlarrym,2010-05-25T11:45Z,"@Morpheuz2o15  -   It can easily be a DVDrip even if the movie isn't out on DVD..... The way this occurs is easy, have ever heard of a SCREENER COPY.... A screener is a term used widely on torrent sites to indicate a true DVDrip that was ripped from a real DVD that was given to a trusted film critic like Leonard Maltin. However, others involved in the technical, behind the scene type of work in the studio where Leonard Maltins movie critic show is made, may not care if it isn't supposed to be scene by anyone except the film critic himself. If one of these other employees could  have a chance to get ahold of this screener DVD and quickly burn a copy onto his laptop he brought to work with him. SO all the above is not factual, but something very much like the above description of events IS taking place. Screeners, (which is a DVD that is ripped so it can be posted) end up being posted/uploaded all the time. SO  this -palic21 person might have a friend that works at a Tv studio and had an opportunity similar to the above description. HELL, this -palic21- guy might have a job at a studio hiMself as far as I know. ANYWAY.... apparently, this uploader didn't feel obligated to explain HOW he got a true DVD copy, but, he obviously DID get a copy. LOOK up his torrents, this is not his first time of uploading at this site. I doubt it is FAKE.... WHY don't you download it, then you'll know if it is a true DVDrip (screener) I just get tired of comments that are made by idiots that do NOT know what they are talking about. I myself had a real NON CAM, NON TS copy of DISTRICT 9, 4 months!!!!!!! before it even got to the theaters, much less been released on DVD yet but a DVD copy I in fact did HAVE... So please -Morpheuz2o15- don't post CRAP like you did here. Others or NEWB's might believe your totally incorrect comments and miss out on getting a DVD copy before it is released. Getting a true DVD copy well before it is released is the main GOAL of everyone at this site, the second most important reason for this site is to share what we have with others. "
,dlarrym,2010-05-25T11:52Z,"My point is this: EVEN if this guys full of shit about his info on what this torrent is, doesn't mean that REAL pre-release DVD's are not a real thing found on this site.... WOLVERINE WAS ON THIS SITE AS A WORKPRINT AND NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT RELEASED, IT WASN'T EVEN FINISHED BEING EDITED AND SOME SPECIAL EFFECTS HAD BEEN COMPLETED EITHER.....THIS IS A FACT!!!
This is not the only example of DVD copies being circulated on this site even before they are released to the general public!!! LASTLY, my comments are not a review of this particular torrent, but an attempt to suppress lies and FALSE info being put out on this site!!!! EVEN if this torrent is a LIE and sucks,  That doesn't mean that some films are posted from DVD screener rips on this SITE. ANYONE that has been using this site for more then a few months will know I am right. that is all...END OF LINE..."
,dsabljak,2010-05-25T12:10Z,ok
,Loiosh,2010-05-25T21:13Z,I'll pick this up tonight and let you guys know what exactly it is.
,Loiosh,2010-05-27T02:07Z,"This is a TS, it's the PRISM release with Croatian subtitles. NOT DVDRIP 

Video/Audio from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5476748/How.To.Train.Your.Dragon.2010.TS.XviD-PrisM%5BExtraTorrent%5D"
,extremeuser3,2010-05-27T22:01Z,"@dlarrym: ""I myself had a real NON CAM, NON TS copy of DISTRICT 9, 4 months!...""
When u hav it then y dont u upload it 4 months ago..
and for your kind information:
""Getting a true DVD copy well before it is released is the main GOAL of everyone at this site, the second most important reason for this site is to share what we have with others."""
,yesbos,2010-06-06T09:59Z,"@dlarrym:
I cant figure, whose ass u r going to save, or r u fired own ass.
We know this is NOT DVD rip, So admit it, one way to do it by blame up loader with shits.
In Pb we have, green & pink skulls, I hope u know them. If they comment or upload something, its 99% correct. 

Nxt thin z, i hope u dont know wts original dvdrip mean. When someone says, dvdrip it should be original retail r1,r2... level copy. Not cam, not TS, not TC, not dvdscreen, not R5. 

So according to Morpheuz2o15:
How the fuck can this be a DVD rip?
No info? 
Fuck palic21; where is info, do u think we can read ur fucking mind.

Trusted pluto999: FAke!! 
Fuck yaa, this is FAAKE

@Loiosh, tx, u did the best wt v need. Ur the real person here. N me another asshole who tried to download this crap. :)"
,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:49Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
,Roscoe666,2010-06-14T19:41Z,"dlarrym you are an idiot.
