Yoav - A Foolproof Escape Plan (2010)





Yoav (born Yoav Sadan in 1975 in Tel Aviv, Israel) is a singer-songwriter of Israeli-South African descent whose debut album Charmed And Strange was released in early 2008. Yoav's music is purely based on his own vocals and acoustic guitar, which he uses to create electronica-style beats with his hands. He has also released two singles, "Club Thing" and "Beautiful Lie", the former having some success and charting in countries around Europe. His song "Adore Adore" was also featured in "Redwood", an episode of The Mentalist.

Since Yoavâ€™s critically acclaimed debut album, Charmed and Strange (2008) he has been on a journey of sold-out headline shows in Canada, the U.S., and Europe. A North American tour with Tori Amos saw Yoav sell almost 9,000 discs off stage in just 3 months. Heâ€™s been an iTunes Canada â€˜Single Of The Weekâ€™ feature artist. Heâ€™s had a #1 song in Russia, where he also received a special RAMP award (Rock Alternative Music Prize) in recognition of his achievements. After only one radio session in Denmark Charmed and Strange climbed to number one on that country's iTunes album chart within 24 hours.
