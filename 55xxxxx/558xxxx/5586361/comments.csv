Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-05-24T15:01Z,"@ ALL - I read the comments from BBE09 that is referred to by 20-40 in his NOTE: 'lies'.

Do NOT believe them. It is coming from a bunch of HATERS (I will not name anyone but they KNOW who they are) who do not do as good a job on their encodes as 20-40.

20-40 has slowly being winning their audience and they are running scared and are fighting back by trying to slur his release(s).

I am a huge fan of 20-40, won't say or pretend otherwise and would wait for his release(s) rather than get some other (bigger size always) release that comes out quicker.

I watch ALL his encodes on a PS3 via HDMI to a 32"" LCD. I have no problems with any of them.

@ HATERS - do a better job on your own release(s) and FUCK OFF!!!"

,dice100,2010-05-24T18:32Z,thanks for the up.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-24T19:09Z,"@dice100: Thanks for that. ""Upping"" take about 3 seconds. Encoding however, took 6 hours (22800 seconds to be precise) and I am ungrateful bastard who rather wants to receive thanking for that."

Thanks again 20-40."
,yinzer,2010-05-25T14:00Z,TY 2040 keep these coming
,yinzer,2010-05-25T14:56Z,"This version will not sync to my Iphone 3gs, it says it is not compatible.  Not sure why."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-25T18:45Z,"@yinzer: It is 720p. Older iPods handle 272p, newer ones up to 360p. Their graphic engine cannot handle 1280x720 frame-size."

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-28T12:39Z,@baguingr: LOL. Nice try. Already seen.
,baguingr,2010-06-05T23:43Z,"what do you mean ""already seen""? did you hack my computer? I Had to end up doing a complete system wipe."
