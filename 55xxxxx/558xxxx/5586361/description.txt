Monday:  Lost (Finale) as 272p;
         Breaking Bad as 720p

SUBTITLES: external, English, English for hearing impaired.

NOTE: DO NOT waste time spreading your lies here!!!
      I am not psychiatrist.
      YES, this is TRUE and REAL 720p, NO, IT'S NOT UPSCALED from anything (how in 
      hell 1920x1080 COULD BE upscaled at all and - NO, IT'S NOT PIXELATED at all, 
      never was and never be...
      IT IS - PERFECT ENCODING IN ALL POSSIBLE WAYS.

      So, more you send here your satellites, trolls and "fans" - more I will
      point out crap you encode as "official" 720p - OVER-SATURATED (by silly 
      26%), TOO DARK (for what? To achieve higher compression of your 
      Gigabytes big turds?) with audio-levels BELOW human hearing abilities.

      MORE MAD you get, instead of lying here, you could recalibrate you 
      equipment and LEARN from me. I am not joking.
