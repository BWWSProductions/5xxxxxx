so this does not freezes? "
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-22T18:06Z,"It uses REFiNED 1080p as source, it does not freeze and pixel up at the 56 second mark."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-22T18:33Z,If anyone wants to get into the video encoding game you should visit your local library and check out a bunch of DVD's and start messing around with them.  My library stocks a pretty large inventory of DVD's for free rental.  Most do now a days I would imagine.
,noOrp,2010-05-22T21:33Z,"Thanks, PT ! :D


I prefer HandBrake for encoding...nice & easy...gets the job done ! :D


currently ain't got time to break my head with MeGUI :P"
,nosferatu501,2010-05-22T21:47Z,"Hey guys, can any of you help me out? I downloaded a rip of a movie and the file size was 4.3GB, meaning it was able to fit on a dvd. But every dvd authoring software i use re-encodes the file and makes it too big to fit on a 4.7GB dvd. Can anyone suggest any software that burns the dvd but keeps the original file size? Thanks for any help!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-23T01:07Z,"well i have never installed or used megui either, so i am no help there."
,noOrp,2010-05-23T02:05Z,"@ nosferatu501


Convertxtodvd is the best !


but how is this even remotely related to PT's rip ? ...neither is ur source / destination file related to it ...so why post ur question, here ? "
,moshster,2010-05-23T11:34Z,Good idea about the library.  Do you recommend any tools for ripping and encoding?
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-23T18:20Z,handbrake should work fine.
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-23T18:21Z,rip me some nice audiobooks while you are there.
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-24T04:31Z,"I really hate manual labor, I had to mow and weed whip a huge lawn yesterday and today.  3hrs of mowing and weed whipping is hard on me!

I tried to pull some nasty weed out by hand and it attacked me too.  Got some nasty welts now on my fingers.  not sure what that thing was, but it was like a damn bee attack it hurt."

,Cespur,2010-05-25T00:51Z,"I'm into the video tagging game. It's easy as hell, but takes huge amounts of time. You think there's need for torrents like that, PT? Like, exactly yours but with all the tags on 'em and stuff?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-25T02:19Z,dont know about need.  doesn't make the video play any better.  its all about eye candy i guess.  most of the tags on these rips are automatically generated.  if you desire the tags or artwork then put them.  all things considered i would probably download a fully tagged video over an untagged video though i guess.
,arian25,2010-05-25T19:54Z,Wish u ripped em in plain mp4 format! :x(
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-25T20:15Z,"hmm, seems like mp4 to me."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-26T01:33Z,"i made chloe brrip, but the audio is a little weird, goes out of sync once or twice, also the stereo is not good, the dd is ok.  so not releasing it."
,noOrp,2010-05-26T01:41Z,"I'm guessing ..'From Paris With Love' :D

,noOrp,2010-05-26T01:48Z,dvdrip of 'From Paris With Love' is out ...so I'm hoping Blu Ray Source shud be out soon :D
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-26T06:51Z,"Chloe 2009 1080p BluRay DTS x264-DNL

this is the one i have.  its ok, audio goes out of sync and I dont think its a true DTS source as the audio channels aren't mapped correct."
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-26T06:52Z,the blonde girl was in dear john
