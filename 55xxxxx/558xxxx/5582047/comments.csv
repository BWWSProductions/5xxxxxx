,Trinitylynne,2012-04-12T00:31Z,"Does anyone know if these are the remastered and/or edited versions ? I guess when they remastered them to DVD, there was some censorship. I am downloading now, but I am not sure if I would even recognize the censorship once I am watching them. However, I'd LOVE to be able to watch the originals! :) Thanks!"
