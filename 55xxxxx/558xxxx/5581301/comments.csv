,dansmm,2010-08-21T21:43Z,Any step-by-step instructions on how to get this to play? - keeps asking for a DVD which I don't have!  Which files would I need to burn to a DVD otherwise?
,RXRA,2010-08-31T22:00Z,"I'm having a strange issue. The first I play this game it has 1920 resolution available. But then, the resolution is limited to 1280. Tried uninstalling the game, and reinstalling it again. Doesn't work. I'm unable to play this game on a suitable resolution. Does anybody know why this happens? It happened with Lego Indiana Jones too!"
,stern300,2010-10-07T19:13Z,"Double-click the .dmg-file and wait a bit until it's finally open. it's a big file, be patient. 
Then drag the game icon into your application folder as usual. Wait until the copying is done. 

NOW open the zip with the crack in the extra folder. It holds a cracked version of the game. Drag this into your batman game folder and replace the one you have installed a moment ago. Bingo!

Works fine on my Imac. 

Thanks for this great upload."
