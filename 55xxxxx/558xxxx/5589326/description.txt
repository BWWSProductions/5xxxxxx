With 30 million albums sold worldwide and the prestigious honor of being the only artist under the age of 30 included in Rolling Stone Magazineâ€™s list of the 100 greatest singers of all time, 5 time Grammy Award winner Christina Aguilera has already achieved an unprecedented level of success. Aguileraâ€™s been hard at work in the studio for the past year and is pleased to announce the release of her highly anticipated 4th studio album Bionic (RCA Records) on June 8th, 2010. The first single from Bionic is the fiercely energetic anthem â€œNot Myself Tonightâ€, produced by Polow Da Don.

Bionic features songs co-written by Aguilera along with her much buzzed about collaborations including Sia, Tricky Stewart, Polow Da Don, Le Tigre, Hill & Switch, and Ladytron among others. Aguilera notes, â€œWorking on this album with so many talented artists and producers that I admire was really an amazing experience. The artists I chose to work with added so many unique sonic layers to Bionic. My intention was to step into their world and what they do combined with my own vision and sound. The results were magic.â€ The album also features a ballad produced and written by Linda Perry titled â€œLift Me Upâ€. The title Bionic reflects Aguileraâ€™s ability to take her range to new levels and use her voice in various ways never heard before.
