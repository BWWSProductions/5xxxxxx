I seem to be only able to get onto step 4 and nothing passed that.

Step 1: Open Driver Checker? and click the Start Scan button on the right side to check your driver status.

Step 2: Optional: There will be a backup hint if you haven't made a backup before the updating. Click ""Yes"" to backup and then update your outdated drivers automatically. Click ""No"" to continue the driver updating without a driver backup.

Step 3: Driver Checker? will start scanning all your hardware devices for the outdated drivers. In seconds it will show you the report of outdated drivers with a tree diagram.

Step 4: You can click the check box to select the drivers you want to update, and then click Next to start installing new drivers.

Step 5: Click OK to finish the update.

Step 6: Click OK to reboot and make the update take effect.
