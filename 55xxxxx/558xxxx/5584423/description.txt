plot:
A chronological look at films by, for, or about (or "by, for, and about")
gays and lesbians in the United States, from 1947 to 2005, Kenneth Anger's
"Fireworks" to "Brokeback Mountain." Talking heads, anchored by critic and
scholar B. Ruby Rich, are interspersed with an advancing timeline and with
clips from two dozen films. The narrative groups the pictures around various
firsts, movements, and triumphs: experimental films, indie films, sex on 
screen, outlaw culture and bad guys, lesbian lovers, films about AIDS and 
dying, emergence of romantic comedy, transgender films, films about diversity
and various cultures, and then mainstream Hollywood drama. What might come
next?
