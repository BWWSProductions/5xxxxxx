Ripped NTSC PS2 iso of the action-adventure game "Dog's Life".

Wikipedia: ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog%27s_Life )
"Dog's Life is a video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for the Sony PlayStation 2. It was released in Europe in October 2003 and in North America in 2004.

The game averaged review scores of approximately 70%, with critics praising the game for its originality and fun factor.

Plot:
Set in rural midwest US countryside, Dog's Life sees its hero embark on an epic journey that spans the US, taking in everything from ski resorts to vibrant cities along the way. Playing as the nimble-pawed protagonist Jake, a plucky pup with a nose for adventure, the player must sniff out a sinster dog-napping plot involving the canine-hating Miss Peaches and Jake's pedigree chum, Daisy.

Dog's Life allows the player to take the role of a lifelike hound, able to fetch, sniff out food, chase chickens and explore."

If anything, you should try this game out for the simple fact that you can poop, pick up that poop, and then throw that poop at people.

Thanks for downloading, and please seed. (And comment, if you'd like.)
