,xMontages,2010-05-31T16:26Z,"Hey guys, the movie is even worth to see in cinemas. I really recommend it before watching it on your comp.,
cheers!"
,lds24601,2010-06-03T16:44Z,"Don't bother with this download.  The album, artist, and track info are not properly included and are all stuffed into the titles, each track cuts off about ten seconds early."
,xMontages,2010-06-04T10:35Z,"yy, true. Most of them cut about 5 sec. before it should end. Sorry but that's all what i got. Beside this, the quality is really high and it's ok to use them in your own movie, when you don't need it in full,
cheers and sorry 1 more time."
