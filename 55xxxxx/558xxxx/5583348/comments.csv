[V],twentyforty,2010-05-24T09:16Z,"@sanyam: I've calculated and calculated - but I cannot. It is too long - 1h 44m 26s - long almost  as three episodes. I had ""problems"" achieving 350MB. So - it would be 350MB. Compared to Xvid - 1400 MB or 720p' 3055 MB it is small as 272p could be. Hey, reason more to mourn our little quarked friend (he could achieve 199.9 MB with utter ease)..."
