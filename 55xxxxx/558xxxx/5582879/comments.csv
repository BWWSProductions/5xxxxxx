No need to upload something if you do not seed.
Or are there hitÂ´nÂ´runners... ? 
No not on piratebay.......hahahahaha, yeah right !
The decency to seed has left TPB nowadays...to much retards not thinking about others....."
,theblasphemousbear,2010-06-10T06:31Z,"I've recently run into some problems preventing me from seeding. I'll get back to it as soon as possible.
Don't always assume someone's being selfish.
Also, am I the only one that thinks it's a bit stupid to complain about the 'decency' of seeding pirated software...?"
