I'm using rtorrent and I'm getting this error for the The Passions - [Could not parse bencoded data], and this error for Prealgebra - Tracker: [Unable to connect to UDP tracker.]. Do u have any idea why? I had no problems downloading College Algebra and Basic College Mathematics."
[V],dohduhdah,2010-05-24T12:39Z,"No idea why.. I've been having some discussions on the piratebay forums regarding some issues with the trackers, but I guess it hasn't been resolved.. I'll see if I can figure out what the problem is by starting another thread there soon."
[V],dohduhdah,2010-05-24T12:42Z,"Judging from the number of seeders/leechers, it seems there defininitly is a problem with ""introductory and intermediate algebra"" and ""prealgebra"", but the ""ttc - passions"" torrent looks healthy.. maybe try a different client, like utorrent instead of vuze and see if that helps."

Introductory and Intermediate Algebra doesn't work on my pc either, Passions does download on my pc using utorrent."
[V],dohduhdah,2010-05-24T18:30Z,"When using vuze, you might try to install this plugin to see if that allows you to download my latest uploads to TPB:
