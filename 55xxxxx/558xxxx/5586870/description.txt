Rush - R30: Live in Frankfurt is the definitive live, in-concert rock'n'roll DVD extravaganza.

Celebrating their $21-million grossing, sell-out 30th Anniversary World Tour, Rush - Geddy Lee on bass and vocals, Alex Lifeson on Guitar and Neil Peart on drums - deliver an explosive performance. The set list spans Rush's incredibly diverse 30-year career. Filmed using 14 hi-definition cameras at the Festhalle, Frankfurt on 24th September 2004.

The Deluxe Edition includes 2 Discs: featuring the Frankfurt concert on one; and interviews, rare and classic footage from the late seventies to the Tsunami relief benefit concert in 2005 on the other. Also included are two audio CDs of the Frankfurt concert, only available as part of this deluxe package.
