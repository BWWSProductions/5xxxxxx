,katespam8,2010-05-23T07:44Z,Thank you SO much!! What is up w/the Soup uploads? Are there evil E! minions hunting people down or something? 
,ekillians,2010-05-23T20:06Z,"Anyone know where I can get The Soup from 5.21?

I watch it live, but a friend in South Korea can't access it anywhere.  Why isn't this show on Hulu or streamed on the E! site with commercial advertisements?"
,ekillians,2010-05-23T20:16Z,Anyone know where I can find the Soup from 5.14??
,katespam8,2010-05-23T23:04Z,"You can buy it from iTunes, $2 an episode. (I don't know if it's available internationally, tho.)"
,ekillians,2010-05-25T06:21Z,boooo...  E! really needs to get on Hulu or post them on the E! website.
