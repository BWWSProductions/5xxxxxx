,est1987,2010-11-23T16:07Z,I've downloaded all your Harry Potter torrents and NONE have the English subtitles. Perhaps you should adjust your information since it's misleading.
,ruthless_toothless,2010-11-25T05:58Z,YIFY!!!!!!!!!!! You're the man!!!!!! THxxx:):):P

Total size is abt 3.9 GiB

Follow this link:

Enjoy!!!

P.S. The sixth movie's credit goes to YIFY. Its his work after all. i just put them together. "
,Anti11,2010-12-23T16:11Z,"Great seeding and quick download. But at such a low bitrate 720p does not make any sense at all. If you plan to play on an HD TV, resolution will be poor every time there is movement, and heavy pixelation is evident in many scenes. 
Sound is also mediocre, as it is only sampled at 34 KHz and 2 channels. A far cry from a 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS.
So, download it only if you plan to watch it on your laptop."

,kanphetigogo,2011-05-09T20:44Z,"I am a big fan of mkv files just because of the size. The video quality is pretty decent, 8, and the audio is excellent, 10. Thanks for the upload!"
,bobalazs,2011-05-24T09:05Z,"Anti11 you obviously don't know what you're talking about. If you had seen any of these YIFY potter movies, you wouldn't be saying that. 
A10
V10 in my opinion"
,redched,2011-06-10T18:29Z,"a 10

,RS27,2011-06-23T21:49Z,It's not bluray rip. It looked like 720p of PreDVD rip. Dont download this torrent if you are expecting bluray quality.
,yurified,2011-07-13T05:26Z,great upload! thanks a bunch
,stayoutoftrouble,2011-07-18T04:01Z,"@bobalazs

If you give this a 10/10 you're the one who doesn't know what you're talking about. Now, I haven't watched this one, but I did download the first movie from YIFY and it isn't 10/10.

As someone said, if you're looking for BlueRay quality, this isn't where you'll find it.

I'd say perhaps A:6 V:7, definately watchable. Thanks YIFY for the upload."
,mendota,2011-07-19T05:40Z,"despite your cadre of dicksuckers, YIFY:

it's a flat out lie to call this high-definition. it's also a lie to say there are subtitles. and it's misleading to post a picture of the blu-ray case.

this is a low resolution, zero feature, minimal size download for people looking just to watch on a laptop."
,gameraby,2011-07-28T19:22Z,"A-10

Thanks."
,azepos,2011-09-08T13:11Z,Great torrent. Thank you YIFY. A/V 10/9!
