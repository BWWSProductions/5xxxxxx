PLOT
A new case for the cult detectives! Not by coincidence, a mysterious videotape falls into the hands of Jupiter Jones (CHANCELLOR MILLER), Pete Crenshaw (NICK PRICE) and Bob Andrews (CAMERON MONAGHAN) during Jupiter's birthday party in Rocky Beach. On it is a recording of Jupiter's long dead parents. In their message they want to communicate to their son the key to an especially tricky riddle.
