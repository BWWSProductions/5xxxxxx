Thanks a bunch. Excellent quality and swift download too thanks to the seeders."

,gg2008,2010-08-21T20:24Z,this is not 720p chk the reolution
,WatermanInk,2010-09-03T17:08Z,"How is this possible? :P  haven't downloaded yet, but it seems pretty strange that it has better quality but smaller size than an ordinary 750 Mb-rip."
,doron_doritus,2010-10-21T03:06Z,"Excellent =D Thanks!

It's not 1280x720 because the file is not in 16x9, but in letterbox format, which is used in the big screen and most of the times kept in the dvd/blu-ray releases."
,Friman02,2010-10-27T23:24Z,"This is shitty version if you are looking HD! In that resolution, itÂ´s impossible to have a great video.. What a dumbass!"
,Subtracting,2010-11-22T01:38Z,Judging by the file size this isn't hd its just a dvd rip blow up to 1280x528 don't download this if you're looking for a high quality rip
,Havaica,2010-11-22T08:53Z,"Its not 720p but its outstanding quality for the file size.

,The_Raged,2010-12-06T20:22Z,i can't hear any sound in the movie. :\
,ultimagic,2010-12-08T12:14Z,"this is a good one if you have a low hard drive space. but if you want a better one with a few loss of quality. try secretmyth, HDLiTE or 3li. sizes are 1.5BG to 3GB depend on how long the film."
,wolski888,2010-12-17T18:55Z,"@ The_Raged
What player do you have? Some players don't have the right codecs. This file is .mkv so here is a description of that file and what programs open it: http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/mkv
If u are using Quicktime on MacOSX, then get Perian! That has ALL the codecs for QT. As mentioned in the above link. Or just download VLC player, but....... NAHHH lol jk I "

P.S. The sixth movie's credit goes to YIFY. Its his work after all. i just put them together. "
,Anti11,2010-12-23T16:14Z,"Great seeding and quick download. But at such a low bitrate 720p does not make any sense at all. If you plan to play on an HD TV, resolution will be poor every time there is movement, and heavy pixelation is evident in many scenes. 
Sound is also mediocre, as it is off synch and only sampled at 24 KHz and 2 channels. A far cry from a 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS.
So, download it only if you plan to watch it on your laptop."

Everyone who comments on this guys torrent for harry potter movies are either god damned retarded, or just his other accounts/friends saying 10/10 Quality.

I don't think anyone who's downloaded this and watched it could actually give the ratings anything over a 6.

 Skip this torrent unless your really desperate to just see the movie and want a really small size. Watching good movies with such low quality in both audio and visual is an awful idea because its so hard to not focus on how awful everything is.

,hmccarthy7,2011-08-16T16:48Z,"Hi, How am I supposed to know if the movie I want to download is an ISO file or not? As I like to put them onto disks to play in my normal dvd player and I only know how to do this with an ISO file

cheers"
,nomadgen,2011-08-31T23:34Z,"stop whining about darn quality! YIFY's HP collection is good, watchable quality if you use proper player and on proper screen size. I use DivX PLayer or Portable VLC on 1024x768 and i got no problem with pixels. 

Go buy original DVD if you want 100% quality, jackass!

and yeah AV : 9/10

Thanks YIFY!!   "

Oh, for fucks sake! Look at the section! FUCKIN HIRES!
10/10 quality compared to WHAT? To 1920*816 High@L5.1 perhaps? With 1510 Kbps DTS sounds perhaps?
Might be good to some other section, but here? No fuckin way! This goes to all ya ppl who posts wrong shitty rips to Hires section."

For a small screen: A-8 V-7(still a little pixilated)"
