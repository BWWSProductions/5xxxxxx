"TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter video game available for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube game consoles that is the sequel to TimeSplitters. The game was published by Eidos and developed by Free Radical Design, a company founded by some ex-Rare members. The game was first released in October 2002 in North America and Europe, and later in Japan.

The game features a single-player mode consisting of ten levels in which the player assumes the role of one of two space marines as they attempt to stop the alien race of TimeSplitters from ruining history by collecting the time crystals in various time periods, ranging from the Wild West to the 25th century. It has several multiplayer modes.

TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter that requires players to kill enemies and complete objectives using a variety of weapons and tactics in different predefined scenarios. Armour and health bars on the sides of the screen lower when the player is shot, which can be increased by walking over body armor and medical kits.

The weapons of TimeSplitters 2 include handguns, rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, a grenade launcher, various explosives, a crossbow, a flamethrower, a fire extinguisher and a brick. They are of many different time periods, from the historical to the futuristic. Some weapons have an alternate fire which activates a feature such as launching a grenade or detonating a remote mine. Sometimes a player can use two of the same gun simultaneously."

Fantastic game, I highly suggest anyone that likes quick-paced deathmatches (like those found in Quake, UT or SkullTag) download this game.
