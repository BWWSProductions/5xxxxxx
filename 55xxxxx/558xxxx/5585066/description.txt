The Cleveland Show is an upcoming American animated series created by Seth MacFarlane as a spin-off from Family Guy, also created by MacFarlane. The Cleveland Show, originally announced as the working title, is the title for an animated series focusing on the character of Cleveland Brown and his family as he moves from Rhode Island to the fictional town of Stoolbend, Virginia. In the closing scene episode of Family Guy, "Baby Not On Board", Cleveland breaks the fourth wall by mentioning to Quagmire that he is getting a spin-off. The theme song originally had a line with Cleveland referring to his â€œhappy black-guy faceâ€, but was removed to be more racially sensitive. His newly introduced family includes his new wife in her late thirties, Donna Tubbs (Sanaa Lathan), her teenage daughter, Roberta Tubbs (Reagan Gomez-Preston) and her five year-old son, Rallo (Mike Henry). Cleveland Jr., who also appears in the show, is now fourteen and is more obese than in his previous appearances on Family Guy, and is now voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson.
