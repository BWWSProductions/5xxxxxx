,thefrozen999,2010-05-30T08:00Z,"anyone else has problems playing this?

If I use GoM player I get  audio desync.If I play it with VLC the movie plays with ,,lags'', if you know what I mean.Didn't try BS player, but I know it's weaker than the two above.

I have a very good PC, so I don't know what might be the problem."

P.S.: my monitor is not really HD, as its highest resolution is only 1680*1050."
