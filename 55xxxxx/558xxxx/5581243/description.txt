Description: The story of this episode continues right where it has left off in the last episode. In a shocking cliffhanger, Sam and Max have discovered skeletons that look like themselves. Now, they have also found some old film reels and a projector to play them (how convenient!). As Sam & Max are watching the film from these reels, they are somehow dragged into the movieâ€”and into the action!
