,FreeTibet,2010-06-03T03:22Z,"Thank you. This is a decent quality rip, the only drawback being the hardcoded Russian subs (unless you're a Russian, lol).

The movie itself is very interesting. Definitely worth a watch. It's kinda like 'The Fountain' meets 'Amelie' meets 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' meets 'The Butterfly Effect'."
