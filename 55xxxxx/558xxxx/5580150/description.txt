In the origional TV version of Business Guy they were going to include a scene where Peter does the Jerry Lewis pantomime "errand boy" but it was cut for time reasons. I have uploaded the version that still has Errand Boy in it. enjoy =)

the file is only 81 MB because it's compressed by Windows Movie Maker but it assure u it is NOT fake and it is still in HD quality
