[iphone ipad ipod touch ]NAVIGON MobileNavigator Europe v1.5.1


With the NAVIGON MobileNavigator you can transform your iPhone into a fully functional mobile navigation system that is every bit as good as the multi-award-winning personal navigation devices from NAVIGON in terms of its user-friendliness and features.
Thanks to a faithful adaptation of the menu functions, the NAVIGON MobileNavigator fits in seamlessly with the operating concept of the iPhone.


This application can be run directly on any iPhone 3G or 3GS. It is also possible to install it on first-generation iPhones or an iPod touch. However, additional accessories are required for GPS navigation on these devices!
