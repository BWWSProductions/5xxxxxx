WireTap from CBC Radio
Season Five

Enter the mind of Jonathan Goldstein. Itâ€™s a nice place to visit, but you wouldnâ€™t want to live there. Part monologue and part telephone conversation, WireTap ushers you into the endearingly odd, funny universe of Jonathanâ€™s friends and family. The Montreal Gazette calls the show "something between borscht-belt comedy and Franz Kafka" and the Toronto Star describes it as "[pitting] the absurd against the plausible. The sense is of a world not completely unlike our own that runs parallel... conversation, storytelling and introspection, culled from equal parts real-world experience and the warp of Goldstein's imagination." WireTap was awarded the Gold World Medal for Best Regularly Scheduled Comedy Program at The New York Festivals in 2006.

WireTap is produced by Jonathan Goldstein, with Mira Burt-Wintonick and Carolyn Warren, and with production assistance from Cristal Duhaime.

This is the COMPLETE 28 episodes from Season Five of WireTap.
