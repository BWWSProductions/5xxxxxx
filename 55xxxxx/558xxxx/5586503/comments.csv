,Adam_OSFP,2011-05-25T13:56Z,"Quality of video is WAY below what can be achieved with x264 and 1000 kbps. Thankfully, it's still better than most ""xvid""s  of similar size. Shouldn't be a big problem on handhelds, but on bigger screens is pretty awful. Oh, audio is bad too. And hey, thanks for sharing. "
