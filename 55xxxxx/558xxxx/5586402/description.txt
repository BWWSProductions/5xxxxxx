           Twelve-year-old Bazarbai is unlike other Nomad boys his        
           age. He dreams of leaving behind the green pastures of         
           his native Western Mongolian province, lured instead by        
           the call of the urban jungle: Ulan Bator. But Bazarbai's       
           father has his own aspirations: One day, the young boy         
           will make him proud by following the famed eagle hunter's      
           own footsteps. When Bazarbai's brother, Khan, is forced        
           to leave home for Ulan Bator, Bazarbai feels deeply hurt       
           and betrayed; he should have been the one sent into the        
           big city. In an attempt to cheer him up, Bazarbai's            
           father takes him to the great Eagle Festival; but the          
           young boy is inconsolable. Suddenly, the prize eagle           
           belonging to Bazarbai's father flies away, scared off by       
           a photographer's bright camera flash. Stricken by fear         
           and remorse that his father's beloved pet might have           
           escaped for good, Bazarbai decides to follow the animal,       
           thus embarking on an adventurous journey through               
           torrential rivers and snowy mountains that inevitably          
           lead him to Ulan Bator - the city of his dreams. Along         
           the way Bazarbai discovers that a happy life does not          
           necessarily result from a departure from long-lasting          
           traditions, but that tradition itself, deep respect for        
           nature, friendship and loyalty form a strong unity             
           despite constant outside threats. Intimate yet powerful,       
           "The Eagle Hunter's Son" is a thrilling and emotional          
           story about redemption, reconciliation and resolution.
