,PAWZ76654321,2010-05-24T14:31Z,Is this one meant to be watched before or after the final 2 episodes?
,d_sellers1,2010-05-24T15:11Z,"Per Wikipedia, The Final Journey is the episode that was played just before the season final. The special at the beginning of season 6 was known as Lost: The Final Chapter. I think the S06E00 is misleading and should  have been labeled S06E17S or something.
