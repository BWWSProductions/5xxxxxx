Monday:  Lost (Finale) as 272p;
         Breaking Bad as 720p

SUBTITLES: external, English, English for hearing impaired.

NOTE: 272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds
             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems
      360p = frame-size 640x360 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback
             as for 272p (except streaming)
      480p = frame-size 720x480 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 720x304
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
      720p = frame-size 1280x720 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 1280x544
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR), hardware intensive
      
      Most problems people have with frame-sizes 1280x720 (720p). I recommend 
      and use one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 and part of DivX7 for AAC. 
      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p 
      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic CPU decode H264 
      using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec (I have ATI card, 
      just in case you've asked yourself).
      
      Any problems one can have come from wrong playback system, malfunctioning 
      device or lack of knowledge. 
      For instance, any so called "jerky" playback of "system-heavy" 720p comes
      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded 
      computer. Use of ddshow filters and "codecs" is suicidal. This is not 
      Russian 720p Matroska format ("official" 720p) and completely different 
      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extension
      "hide" bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, 
      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as 
      much is possible.
        
      Any blurriness of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. VLC 
      and few other players are most versatile and good - but quality is 10-20%
      lower.
      Any block-ness comes from "system-too-slow" situation, when decoding engine 
      of one's device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames as it 
      supposed.
      On "I have no video" and "I have no sound" I don't waste my time.

      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There is no B-frames, no CABAC
      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness 
      of any kind.

      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).
      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system 
      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones 
      with Line In of any Stereo rack).
      
      I encode H264 for six years and I have experienced (first-hand) any problem 
      one might have or imagine. I have heard almost every â€˜complaintâ€™ out there 
      and would, if asked POLITELY, be happy to answer questions and give as much 
      help as humanly possible   
      I always have.
   
      
NOTE 2.: For people on slower connection and with slow or inappropriate hardware
         (read about in Description of 272p Lost) I suggest 272p version 
         upped this morning.
