,hkoraddi,2010-05-25T08:15Z,hi can u rip the wolfman?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-25T09:22Z,"Thanks to all. I watched this one last night (with one day delay) and probably after all of you. Usually, it takes more to find the time.

@madtown4: Check the mail my friend.

@Demise69: ""Last journey"" is in my hands - but today is ""24"" finale with two episodes, ""Chuck"" as double too, HIMYM and TBBT. So - later... after all aforementioned.

@hkoraddi: According to some reports Wolfman have Cinavia shit and by that not playable in PS3.
So - I'll skip it. As the sign of my support to smart asses who haven't been able to crack this yet.

But, you deserve a medal for supporting late lil' guy.

@lover: I do not watch Kimmel, and Last journey special must suffice. Lost in 720p was on you at least 33%. (kidding)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-25T11:32Z,@jjabrams: LOL... finally! Somebody asked the right question the right man.
,jjabrams,2010-05-25T15:37Z,"Yes - I hope now that everybody understands - I have no idea how to write for TV or Movies. First Alias , now lost. Star trek wasnt explained very well either, its just lucky that star trek fans dont mind quantum time theory mumbo jumbo that doesnt make sense. :)

SPOILERS
btw. to answer the original question, ben is still on the island, the pilot wasnt on the original plane so he's not dead yet. Jack also doesnt have a son because the whole flash sideways was just a made up hallucination.
Funniest thing I've read is that someone claimed this ending was better than the sopranos ending - thats lol."
,wag666,2010-05-25T21:58Z,"I downloaded this just out of curiousity, having gotten web-dl already. And... how do I say this?... Well, it's very bold to call this ""TRUE and REAL 720p"". So to everyone who's curious like I was I might probably say, trust me you dont wanna be disappointed. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T07:42Z,"FO my old stalker. Web-DL is PLUS 3050MB. You can NEVER download that on your 10kB/s unless vodka has totally eaten your mind. And play 720p? On what? I know you, do not forget that.
You knew shit, and yes - IT IS PERFECT AND TRUE 720p.
BTW, you can Hit ""-1"" as many times you like, wag666. I give a flyn' fuck."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T08:54Z,"Crazy can?t be argued with. Facts don?t matter. Logic need not apply. The reality of the situation is a waste of time to explore because the only one that matters is the one that they?ve created.

Crazy has time on its hands. I?ve got stuff to do. Because crazy has the time, focus, and energy to sit at a keyboard for long lengths of time ?

Crazy LOVES to write angry comments and send out comments. He can and he think he's entitled to. He just - have such urge. 

Crazy has other issues they need to work out. In fact, there?s usually a lot going on when the crazy decides to erupt. The actual triggering event is typically only the last straw. A lot of little things had been building up unresolved before the eruption point.

Crazy has to save face. At some point, crazy recognizes the mess that they?ve made. But they'll  never admit that thay have been wrong. Admitting that would be equal to saying others ""I am crazy, but I cannot see that"".

So, I don?t argue with crazy. I?ve even quit poking crazy with a stick for my own amusement . Nor do I defend myself against crazy. For one thing, my life speaks for itself. If the accusations made by someone matches the experience people have had with me, then so be it. Secondly, crazy speaks for itself. Most people recognize it as such.

The bottom line is that I try to ignore crazy and leave it alone to work out its issues. And since I?m not going anywhere, crazy always has a place to return to."
,jjabrams,2010-05-26T10:28Z,"hey 20/40 - dont sweat it - these people dont understand anyways. Maybe a note saying that YES the bitrate is lower than ""standard"" 720p bloody obvious) but the quality is much higher than ANY other 350mb rip."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T11:40Z,"@jjabrams: 720p stands for 720 pixels. Nothing more. This encode has 1280x720, it is 4.5 TIMES SMALLER and those morons haven't figured out yet what is wrong with them and their skewed anticipation. In fact - they cannot.

Sane people can make calls, judge, weight-out by putting the things in perspective, using several factors - not just  - one. As my friend once said on mininova ""Oh, most people do have size ""issues"""". I answered ""Thank-god, I have not - in any way thinkable.""

What drove them insane is a fact that I am one of many, meanwhile you can find dozens of H264 movies in 720p UNDER 700MB. In the same time they fed their ISPs, burning money for nothing and times never have been harder, right?

I needed three minute to write this shit down.
In these three minutes NINETY PEOPLE have died out of hunger.
Meanwhile, pricks and morons have burned tens thousands of dollars for what? For 3.055GB big shit which would be replaced by BluRay in month time.

Idiots are in the majority, and I somehow,feel obligated to talk about."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-26T18:01Z,"... and I was right - in last six hours crazies log-out, log-in and pressed the ""-1"" button FIVE times... In 48 hours before - none. Just 4 times ""+1"".

Well, I've said also that I understand them - and therefore doesn't care... I watched, I think is good and they cannot get that.
