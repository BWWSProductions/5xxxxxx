,dc.centr,2010-05-22T20:39Z,"The.Genius.of.the.Hole
Game - full English (audio/interface)
Installator - Rissian =)"
,dc.centr,2010-05-22T20:43Z,Russian*
,norberg18,2010-05-23T23:32Z,"How do I change the language to English? When I play the game, it's in Russian.

Otherwise, really GREAT rip! dc.centr, you're ****ing AWESOME!!!"
,dc.centr,2010-05-24T05:13Z,The game is full English. Maybe you mean Russian chat in game? - simply switch the keyboard language (Alt + Shift)
,INeonLeonI,2010-05-24T16:52Z,"Hey, I just downloaded it, it's really fast and has many players (it's private server, right?) and works perfectly. But today, the server kinda went offline suddenly and I'd like to know whether there is some kind of limited time using it or when it's online again. "
,INeonLeonI,2010-05-24T19:12Z,"Ok, it all still works perfectly ;) thx again dude! 
last MW2 i got didnt have multiplayer, and  I heard it was kickass. Drem come true XD"
,norberg18,2010-05-24T19:37Z,"Updated DirectX, so it's working now."

Thanks dc.centr!"
,INeonLeonI,2010-05-26T04:49Z,"Heya, another question concerning the server... as you know, there is only 1 in the list to start with and it sometimes goes offline... is it a well frequented private server or does it hack into the actual MW2 server of IW? Why does it go offline, when and for how long? 
Oooh important: I'm lvl 35 alrdy and I don't like my name... can I change it in the AlterIWnet launcher without resetting my lvl or anything else?
Cya ^^"

,INeonLeonI,2010-05-27T19:40Z,"Oh, and this torrent is a fast download, easy install and huge online community for an alternate server. Over 5000 people online all day is enough to get any game you want. 
If you don't have the brains to double click on a file called SETUP.EXE, then you should probably GO BUY THE FUCKING GAME cuz this is hopeless dweebism dude"
,INeonLeonI,2010-05-27T22:20Z,"Oook, im gonna try changing my name, but I'm alrdy lvl 57 by now, not 35 anymore... =/ hope this works..."
,phat13h,2010-05-28T14:10Z,titikab odnt give me crap about that i know how to run ripped games. but this game is to buggy. im running vista. All i can say is this guy needs better instuctions.
,INeonLeonI,2010-05-28T16:07Z,"@ phat13h:
I have Vista with the best working drivers - a gaming pc - and this is how I did it: 
- I downloadeed it at the speed of about 600kb/s
- Then I right-clicked the download file in BT and clicked on ""open containing folder"" 
- There was a SETUP.EXE file and 3 more setup file used to run the .exe file but otherwise of no concern. Don't click those. 
The setup started up like any other game, though not in InstallShieldWizard but as a special layout. 
- Afterwards, I had the Desktop Icon ""AlterIWnet launcher"" and ""iw4mp"", which is the game, but only works through the launcher. 
- I opened the launcher, set an in-game name in the bottom right and selected the server (only 1)
- I clicked ""Connect!"" and the multiplayer menu of MW2 was opened, from where I could access this great alternate server community! 
Hope this works for you too, otherwise get the newest DirectX and the latest Nvidia driver + updates. 
When I got Battlefield Bad Company 2, it showed a black screen at first, because I did have the best graphic driver, but not the latest updates (version 162.3 instead of 192.1) 
Good luck, this works for most people, so no point in griping about it. ^^"
,Nuggs,2010-05-28T19:49Z,"Works great, thanks for this.  :)

Anyone having problems and you're on Windows 7(Maybe vista as well) try running the launcher as administrator, only way it works for me.  :)"

,trial2err,2010-06-12T13:57Z,"@ Clance.  Also, the letter issue can be the result of overclocking if you set anything too high..  You'll get the strange looking letters and multi-colored artifacts, just lower whatever you set if you have overclocked your GPU.  But as said, if you haven't overclocked- just update your GPU's drivers."

,[-unk]Nexus,2010-07-05T05:17Z,"Just want to say THX THIS TORRENT IS AWESOME!!!!: Ive been noticing that a lot of people have been posting that there getting symbol bugs, or that they cant connect to any matches also not being able to change your username, so i've posted below how you actually fix these bug's.

1) The menu bug is caused by your graphics card not being up to date with the recent drivers.

NVIDIA DRIVERS
www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html

AIT DRIVERS
support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx

2) Not being able to join matches, there are a number of ways to resolve this bug but your best bet is to look at pages 1 to 3 because there are a few fixes in there, my best bet is to run the game as ADMIN (if vista or 7) otherwise i will post what is the best way to install the game and how to make it WORK!!!

3) This is how to change your name quoted from ""DomToretto""

To change your name
Right click your file, open file location
Right click alterIWnet_configure and run as administrator
change your name
All done bud, don't worry i couldn't figure it out either at first

Hopefully this help's and i hope to see you guys online...."

I updated the program and finally I can get to the main screen. But still I can't connect to the server. What should I do now. I'd appreciate the help. Do I need any new patches?"
,ardryll,2010-08-06T11:57Z,"@cassonberry to use aiw37a, you must find an update first. but they are easy to find just google it. but not manual update ok?"
,ardryll,2010-08-06T11:58Z,"find an auto-updater, download it, update the game, use aiw37a, play"

,Sienk,2010-08-07T17:22Z,"@ ardyll,

I did all that you said to do, I downloaded the auto updater, and I extracted the aiw37a folder into my root modern warfare folder, but whenever I try to start the game, it says the server is still offline. Are there any other servers I can connect to?"
,ardryll,2010-08-08T10:32Z,i dont know it worked for me:S i dont think there is eany other servers but searching wont hurt
,viggeli,2010-08-09T22:57Z,"I need some help, i downloaded the torrent, installed it, but every time i try to play an error notice that says ""Could not connect to the configured server (damageware.no.ip.info). Possibly you've misconfigured alterIWnet.ini, or this server is actually down."" pops up. Now my first question is where do i find the alterIWnet.ini to configure? My second question is if anyone could give me a link to everything that possibly is needed to download to get this game working properly?"
,Sienk,2010-08-11T00:23Z,"@ viggeli

Try to add a new server. Use this IP address 109.237.208.88, this is AlterIW's actual IP address. It should connect you straight into thier server with no problems. If it still does not work you may need to update the game"
,auketje,2010-08-11T10:30Z,How come the server is still offline? Please give us some information.

,viggeli,2010-08-14T09:00Z,"@ Sienk


Thanks A lot! now i got an online server! now the only problem is that The alterIW launcher launches this error-note ""video card or hard-drive doesn't support alfa blend, glow will be disabled"" and stalls to that point. I haven't got enough time to see if the game starts after some time, though. But thanks anyway, one step closer to a great working game!"
,Sienk,2010-08-14T17:49Z,"@ viggeli

That's odd, I was trying to help my friend set this up too and he was getting the same message. I know when I set it up it worked fine. It could be a possability that you need an update or something. But, it could also mean your graphic card can't support the game, and if it did play you would lag so much. Your graphics card is what displays everything on your monitor and the higher it is the more it can MB it can support per second. What kind of computer are you using? If it's an older model than that would be the cause. I'm using Windows 7, but my friend was using Windows XP."
,viggeli,2010-08-21T17:05Z,"@ sienk

I updated the game, but still it launches the same error-message, so i think i need a better graphic-card. Im using an approx 4 year old toshiba satellite, XP. Still it has with an nVidia G-force FX, which should be quite good..? I also think that 512mb RAM (i know..) is not enough for playing the game properly.."
