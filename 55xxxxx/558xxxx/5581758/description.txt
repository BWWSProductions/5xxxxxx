The registry is central to the health of your computer as it contains essential hardware and software instructions that need to be accessed continuously. While a new computerâ€™s registry is clean and structured,with use, particularly through software removal and changes in settings and hardware, bad or useless entries start to accumulate. Furthermore, data can start to fragment with once ontiguous registry instructions breaking up into multiple locations. The result is a loss in system efficiency with system slow-downs, errors and conflicts.

RegistryBooster improves your PC by optimizing your registry in two distinct ways. After scanning for obsolete and harmful entries, RegistryBooster will clean and fix your registry, removing errors and improving your computerâ€™s processing efficiency. RegistryBooster can also defragment your registry by re-ordering instructions for contiguity. With a cleaned-up and defragmented registry your computer will speed along,experiencing fewer errors and better performance.
