Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck

Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame
To be what you is, you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar, hey baby
I'm a rockstar, hey baby
Big city, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all night

Baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, it's big cities, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all nights

Baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, hey, hey, hey

Six inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good, check my panties and my bra

Wildin' out a crazy house with my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?
To be what you is, you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar, hey baby
I'm a rockstar, hey baby
Big city, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all night

Baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, it's big cities, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all nights

Baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, hey, hey, hey

Hey, I'm rocking out tonight
'Cause I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I'ma live my whole life in the night
'Cause I ain't got time to borrow

I'm rocking out tonight
Why wait 'til tomorrow?
I'ma live my whole life in the night

I'm a rockstar, hey baby
I'm a rockstar, hey baby
Big city, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all night

Baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, it's big cities, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all nights

Baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, oh, baby I'm a
Oh, baby I'm a, hey, hey, hey
