When the express elevators in the Millennium Building, one of New York's most famous landmarks, 

start to malfunction and behave in erratic ways, elevator mechanic Mark Newman is sent out to find 

the cause of the problems. His investigation meets unexpected resistance and not everybody seems to 

be happy with his involvement. After a gruesome and deadly incident, in which a blind man falls 

into the shaft and a security guard is decapitated, the police start an investigation. They are 

however not very successful. Mark is determined to find the cause. He is joined by a female 

reporter, Jennifer, who is looking for a juicy story. Together they try to unravel the secrets 

behind the mysterious behaviour of the elevator that seems to have a life of it's own. When things 

get worse and death toll rises, The Government, fearing terrorists are involved, seal off the 

building. What at first looked like a routine job turns into a horrifying nightmare in which Mark 

has to face an enemy whose blood thirst is only met by it's unpredictability. An enemy that is 

determined to fight off any intruder looking for the dark secret that lurks inside the belly of the 

building. An enemy that has to be feared. An enemy that has to be taken .......DOWN.
