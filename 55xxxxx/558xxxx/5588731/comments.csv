[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-05-26T02:40Z,"take your pills always before getting online :))) . the original is 20 kilos LESS than mine, because it lacks many files although mine has a higher compression rate. 40 megs dream aquarium ??? what images ? it has ALL the tanks ! and the splash screen before launching the installer I simply do not care at all. The uninstall procedure is done by the inno commands !!! no need of crap files...this is tested to clean the registry entries before installation, to clean any  preexisting settings.txt file either of craked or original versions...and when uninstalls it does that the same clean way...deletes files, settings , registry entries... there is nothing hidden there...IF YOU TRY TO EXTRACT THE INNO INSTALLER THE EXCTRACTION IT WILL HIDE TO YOU MANY SPECIFIC COMMANDS USED...IT WILL ALTER THE ISS... the original projected dream aquarium it is kept along with other 2 old versions...sorry I cannot disclose the projects. I repeat, it is done to repair all possible conflicts from older versions and future versions even...deleting any extra entries possible...and letting only the present legitimate files...do not bother please, and yes some TPB mods are blindly deleting users...there is a saying that if you use anonymous upload and a strange ID...you are deleted at sight...I understand that, they do not need us , we are more than 4 millions...and TPB has a serious issue cleaning the parasites... only that I am not one of those...I only share some of my works, bye
