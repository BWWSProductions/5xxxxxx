[V],SciFi-Sumo,2010-07-15T00:26Z,@h1pp0 - There is no full 2 hr show each day for July due to yakuza scandal. Read more here:nnnhttp://www.sumotalk.com/news.htmnnThey are just showing a 1/2 hr show all in JAP and it is like my old Sumo Digest that is just the matches real quick.nnAlso there will be no cup to the winner for the Basho so the whole thing is just silly in some ways!
