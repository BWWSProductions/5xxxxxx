Natsu Basho [JAPANESE]- Day 15 - 2010 May (Xvid-*.AVI)

Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 15, the final day for some to get Katchi-koshi of the May honbasho from the RyÅgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo.  Good luck to all your favourites!

This recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG

I will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.

Iâ€™ll be around for the next basho, so â€˜seeâ€™ you all in July
