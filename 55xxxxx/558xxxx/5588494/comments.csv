....... WOW!! Holy shit what a season and what an end to this brilliant series. Truly amazing!
I've stayed up long into the night on many occasions to see Jack Bauer defy death and save humanity and I know millions of you out there have to,.... go on admit it :-)
Truly amazing series so sad its over but i suppose it had to end some time and shit it definitely went out with a bang.
Many thanks to all involved in the series, thanks for all the shocks, tears and nail biting action.

24..... (The End)"
