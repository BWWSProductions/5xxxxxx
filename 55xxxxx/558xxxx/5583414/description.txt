1. Load and unpack it
2. Go into the Alliance or Horde Guide Folder (or both)
3. Copy everything in this folder to the Addons Folder (when you copy both guides windows will ask you if you want to replace files, press yes or no, it doesn't matter)
4. You need to make sure you open the Alliance or Horde folder and see all the cartographer folders and 2 Zygor folders. Those need to be copied not the Zygor Alliance/Horde by itself.

The default location of your World of Warcraft AddOns folder is:
C: -> Program Files -> World of Warcraft -> Interface -> AddOns
If you are running Windows Vista, the folder you need to install the guides into is:
C: -> Users -> Public -> Games -> World of Warcraft -> Interface -> AddOns
5. Make sure the Load Out of Date AddOns button is checked in the top right corner above your addons list.
6. Click the Okay button.
7. Click the Enter World button.
8. Congratulations, you're now setup and ready to go! I hope you enjoy the guide(s)!
