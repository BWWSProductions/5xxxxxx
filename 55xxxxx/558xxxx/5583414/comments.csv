,gunmaker,2010-12-05T15:48Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

THIS IS THE FUCKING PIRATE BAY! WE DONT TAKE CRAP FROM SCALLYWAGS! YARrRrR!"
