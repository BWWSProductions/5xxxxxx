,Michael_Essien,2010-05-25T03:24Z,Isn't this exactly the same as the Tvteam release??
,mizfan91,2010-05-25T07:59Z,No this is a different source the other cam was from prism this is from IMAGiNE with direct line audio read the nfo
,mizfan91,2010-05-25T08:00Z,"IMAGiNE NOTES
First off many thanks to Relizlab for the video source and PrisM for the line audio... Thanks both :)
Well we balanced the colours out, made it a touch sharper and also used a smoother and changed the brightness, contrast and chroma. 
Then it was just syncing PrisM's audio to it. Its surely not the best source out, but is watchable for now.
