IMAGiNE NOTES
First off many thanks to Relizlab for the video source and PrisM for the line audio... Thanks both :)
Well we balanced the colours out, made it a touch sharper and also used a smoother and changed the brightness, contrast and chroma. 
Then it was just syncing PrisM's audio to it. Its surely not the best source out, but is watchable for now.

UPLOADER NOTES
IMHO THIS IS PROBABLY BETTER VIDEO QUALITY THAN PrisM RELEASE...PLEASE COMMENT :)
