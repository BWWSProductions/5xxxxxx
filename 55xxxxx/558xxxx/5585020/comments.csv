axxo is active?????"
[V],catflap,2010-05-24T11:56Z,"FAKE!

axxo's home is the darkside RG site, but
there is no mention of axxo's return and
this film is not listed in axxo's pages there.

what's going on, tvteam? why are you
posting obvious fakes? VIPs don't post fakes!"

[V],pluto999,2010-05-27T09:24Z,is a VIP mislabeling things or has aXXo returned? pls answer TvTeam
,petercontact,2010-05-27T10:06Z,this is not axxo this is just a torrent with good quality with the name of axxo for people to download it simple :)
,petercontact,2010-05-27T15:23Z,ok something i hear maybe not true that axxo move to a private site and this is one of site's torrents
,circlensess,2010-05-28T17:02Z,"Well this movie is released under axxo. How can anyone else determine who axxo is? We can make resonable assumptions of who axxo is but maybe axxo split from the others in the group and now started his own. One of the reasons I left was because the mods here were becoming editors and making decisions on what could be posted. Axxo has an account on here and he could come and dispute whats posted is not his and that is the only way to determine it. But since he is not doing that.... Others trying to determine it is not the way of the internet.

Obviously just anyone releasing things using axxo to make a gain should not be allowed. But as long as its resonabely certain its not a scam we should let the market decide.

,idontfail,2010-08-18T06:06Z,"I liked this movie.

In terms of quality I would give it;
v:9
a:9
(considering compression)

Sound was in sync for entire movie (for me) and movie very watchable. 

Don't think it's really axxo but who ever it is ... Thanks for the upload !!. ;)"
