- Just kidding"
,MitchC9,2010-05-24T11:12Z,"I'm gonna vote fake
1) .rar for no reason when CTU doesnt rar there files
2) Other torrents dont watch file size: Your FQM boondocks torrent is 187mb. The FQM boondocks episode is 175mb from eztv which is an official source.
"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-05-24T13:38Z,LOL @ MitchC9. You don't have a fucking cluueee what you're on about.
,VonEviL,2010-05-24T14:11Z,I agree that RARs are a pain in the ass...
,podivan,2010-05-24T17:38Z,"MitchC9:

CTU and all proper scene release groups rar their files. Eztv is not scene, they simply unrar and upload other groups releases which is pathetic. 

It makes no sense that this should be fake, so stop whining when you don't pay shit to see this.

I hate the ""fuck rars"" mentality, NONE of these releases are meant for you in the first place, so shut your mouths. "

RAR is simple to use.  Just get a free trial version of WinRAR, then get a serial keygen via BitTorrent to make a permanent license.  You're already using BitTorrent to get other stuff, why not WinRAR?!?!"
,MitchC9,2010-05-24T23:57Z,"Not fake, apologies to uploader. Seeing uploaded files named identically to other files from reputable sources yet at a different file size is a legitimate reason for suspicion though give me a break, "

A: 10

thanks!"
[T],DiGiB0X72,2010-05-26T05:54Z,"@MitchC9
The differing sizes is cause for paying closer attention. What causes it in non-malicious cases? Man, no idea, I suspect it occurs as the release travels from middleman to middleman. Eventually someone unwraps it, removes the sample, repacks. Or even worse, someone sneaks adverts in."
,yuckfoo,2010-05-26T07:07Z,"@ podivan
Shut your festering cake hole you ignorant little shit... WTF are you doing here boy?
If someone has a concern they have a right to voice it. If you can't handle acting like anything more than an arrogant little brat then I suggest you shut you stupid fucking mouth  little bitch."
,Numberwang69,2010-05-26T15:20Z,"This is definitely not a fake, video quality is great. Audio on the other hand is so fucking low I can barely here it with all audio levels set to max. WTF!"
,Dutchlike,2010-05-30T15:36Z,"Definately real.
Numberwang, that's not a problem over here :\."
,andy72184,2010-05-31T05:25Z,Awesome can you rush the 11th episode please.
,lanec42,2010-06-21T05:08Z,Thank you!
