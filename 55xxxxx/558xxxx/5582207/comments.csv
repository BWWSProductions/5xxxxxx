,Firekid42,2010-07-04T02:15Z,"Got partway through downloading this torrent, torrent disappeared from uTorrent, and in the folder I have a bunch of media files that won't work, and 45 minutes of From Paris With Love under the label of episode 18. Wtf? 
Will try downloading again, will let you know what happens."
,zerosk8a,2010-07-06T15:28Z,"big waste of time.. asshole uploader.. In this torrent you will find the following: Smallville, Heroes, Boondocks, and slow ass download speeds.. Why do people do that? People like this should be hung from their tiny testicles and be gutted like a stock pig.. FUCKIN ASSHOLE!"
,mariek82,2011-01-28T09:50Z,Seem to download ok although it had Spanish or Portugese subtitles which was annoying!
,cri5ti,2011-04-28T17:50Z,"Downloaded the first episode, and so far so good.

Firekid42, zerosk8a, when you download a movie, if it hasn't finished downloading completely, you might see some parts of old deleted files on your disk. Have you recently watched / deleted Smallville, Heroes, Boondocks, ... ?"
