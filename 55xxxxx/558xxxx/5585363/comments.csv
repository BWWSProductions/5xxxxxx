,dark_isle,2010-05-24T06:36Z,"I still cant believe Desmond TRAPPED THEM ALL IN THE CONCERT AND KILLED THEM! EVERYONE!! But i dont blame him he just wanted to go home to the real timeline (LIKE MiB)! I was practically screaming at the tv! Especially when Jack tried giving Rose mouth to mouth while the place was burning just like in the PILOT! And all their memories got sent to the real timeline and they all remembered and that was enough to kill MiB! And then WALT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND SAID HE WAS THE ISLAND all along and the HE WAS THE HEART and that teh real WALT had been dead since the plane crashed!! God i was so shocked, but it makes sense! what an awesome show I'm gonna miss it so much!  And these aren?t spoilers cuz I already saw it!"

@warlockwizard: it`s only the first disc to have more seeds on the first part.. which does make a lot of sense since we`re all eager to have it rather sooner than later :)"

,dlarrym,2010-05-24T07:39Z,"Dark Islands comment is SO not the real ending... I won't spoil anything for those who haven't watched it yet... WALT NEVER shoes up, and isn't the Island at all!!! If you saw season 6 episode 15, you learn what the island is about... It isn't an entity of any type not WALT or anyone. It is just a special place... I'll say no more...but Dark_isle is pulling everyones legs!!!! again....  Desmond DID NOT KILL anyone or trap anyone.... This is not meant to spoil anything but to let all know that dark_isle's comment are totally bogus, so don't stress, he must be joking  or retarded or was watching something other then the LOST we all love. Enjoy this truely Final ending. With commercials was 2 & 1/2 hours. take care all. Lastly, I am sad LOST is over, but it was meant to be.... For you that liked LOST, a new series is out called HAPPY TOWN with SAM NEIL, M.C. Gainey (Played  the guy named TIM FRIENDLY - apperared in LOST: episode 6,  season 4 episodes. Enjoy"

At least seed while you watch the episode, or when you go away to a darkened corner to contemplate your life without Lost.

,SEoF,2010-05-24T20:48Z,"Hmm, for a 50 minute episode, it sure does seem large.

Those complaining of people not seeding, learn what the numbers are telling you.  When you see ""2 (32996)"" in the seeding column, it means ""you are connected to 2 of the 32996 seeders"" NOT ""the other 32994 people with it aren't seeding""

Learn how it works before you complain!"

,scatattack,2010-05-25T10:53Z,"What a load of balls. I never liked lost from the get go and all I ever seemed to hear from people was how good it was, so I watched every episode to see if I was actually  missing something and guess what? it was actually shitter than I originally thought. I don't know how anybody can truly watch this shit and think it's good. To be honest I found 10 good episodes, but that's like out of 100+ episodes. That means less than 10% of this fucking shite is actually good. Monkey see monkey do I guess, the black sheep public will follow any bullshit that they think is popular, hence the simpsons, two and a half men and so on and so on and so on and so on. All I can say is THANK FUCK this tripe has ended. "
