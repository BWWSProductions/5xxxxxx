has three files in the package:
AS_PBY-CATALINAX_FSX_V100.exe
AS_PBY-CATALINAX_FSX_UPD_V110.exe
ascrypt.ddl
no readme.txt file"
,Muckypup9,2010-05-26T18:52Z,"Yes, it's my fault, I have thought everybody know this..   But here: 

If you have trouble about install: 

1. go to C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp
2. start the installer
3. select a language
4. go back to the 'Temp' folder. two new directories will have been created. 
5. look for the the ascrypt.dll in one of them.
6. copy the 'ascrypt.dll' from the torrent's folder to that folder you just opened, overwriting the original file.
7. now proceed with the installer and leave all the registration fields open.
8. You needed to do this procedure again when you install the update file."

Thank you very much"

,runningdeer,2010-06-28T03:22Z,"Hi, ty for this aircraft, it's pretty neat.

Recently I've dl'd and installed a few aerosoft products from torrents. My ""Temp"" folder is getting cluttered with files that are beginning to confuse me, since they are named with numbers instead of a better description.

After installing an aerosoft product...can I delete these temporary folders?

Thank you for your time and terrific uploads."
,Uncle_Fuzzy,2010-06-29T15:51Z,"runningdeer: 
You can delete them - they are just empty folders after the install finishes. A way to make the new files easier to find when installing is to arrange the files in the TEMP folder in order of update.  That way, the 2 new folders will appear at the bottom (or the top - depending on which order you specify) of the list. Another thing I have done to rid the clutter in the TEMP folder is to create another folder inside it which I named HIDE.  Then, I put all the existing folders into that new folder before starting the Aerosoft install. This also worked nicely & caused no problems. "

,TheRavenWings,2011-03-22T22:59Z,"Hi guys Just thought Id give you a heads up on where to Places the ascrypt.dll file when useing Windows 7.  

1. go to my computer
2. go to C:\ 
3. in there you should see a folder called ""Users""
4. Go to the ""home"" floder
5. Go to ""Appdata"" if you cant see it you need to unhide you folders

6. Go to your ""Local"" folder
7. Go to your ""temp"" folder
8. Open your installer for any of the Aerosoft stull and you should get to new folders open up in your temp ""Dir"" if you cant see them Delete all the folders in temp and open the installer again

One you found the last folder when the installer is open,   Copy the ascrypt.dll into the folder that already has the file and there you have it.. continue the istallation

Dont worry about putting in any rego inforemation, it will install as nomal 

And Enjoy   "
