Synopsis
:-

Mammootty is back with director Shafi(Thommanum Makkalum, Maayavi) for the action entertainer, Chattambinadu. Produced by Mammootty's banner Playhouse, the film shooted in Pollachi. The film will be completed in one schedule and is being planned as Mammootty's Christmas release. In Chattambinadu, Mammootty plays the role of a planter Virendra Mallaya, who is also a goonda with 37 criminal cases against him. When he goes to Chembanadu, in Karnataka, to buy a coffee plantation, he finds it overrun with criminals. So he takes it upon himself to clean the place up! Benny P Nayarambalam has written the screenplay. Mukesh will play an important role, along with three heroines, in the film. Mammooka will speak in Malayalam with a heavy Kannada accent and will have a new look in this film, says Shafi. We are keeping our fingers crossed that the Shafi- Mammootty team will be able to score a hat trick of hits with Chattambinadu.
