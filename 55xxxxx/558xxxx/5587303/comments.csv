,MAiWhang,2010-07-17T23:36Z,"These movies are beyond bad...just awful...abysmal, horrid, and FUBAR; they suck! Please keep them coming. This is my favorite genre. I am building the ultimate Toho collection and am one sick Otaku. I haven\'t seen so much bad shit on TPB since I last had my septic tank emptied. So, please keep uploading...you are truly blessed by Kamisama himself. You will reap a heavenly reward for your service to us bad movie fans. Bad mivies are like sex...ain\'t no such thing as bad! LOL"
