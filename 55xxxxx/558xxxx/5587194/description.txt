Not much, just a 7 song dubstep playlist.
Some of my personal favorites, only one of the songs is in MP3 format, but don't be alarmed.
All the other songs in the playlist can be played using windows media player even though they don't have an extension listed.
When it asks you what program you want to use choose WMP and you will be just fine.
