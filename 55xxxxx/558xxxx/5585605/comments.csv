Seed people! "
,niaomi,2010-05-24T15:14Z,5.6kbs you've got to be kidding me.
,niaomi,2010-05-24T15:19Z,"Does anyone have a direct download link for this file? I will pay to register if need be.

This is going to take days to download, I've been goin' for 4 hours and average at less than 10kb/s on 20mb cable broadband. My upload is around 65kb/s. Sucks bigtime."
,XSCounter,2010-05-24T15:39Z,"So, eztv, do I understand correctly? First, you give Ep17 which is split in 2 parts with names CD1 and CD2. And now you give Ep17 (non-split?) + Ep18 all together? Doesnt make sense. So I have to download Ep17 twice just to watch Ep18 if I already started downloading Ep17 CD1 and CD2?
Nevertheless, thanks for your work!"
,leevi1974,2010-05-24T17:02Z,why the h*ll is it so SLOW?!
,emilek737,2010-05-24T17:34Z,"READ THIS.
Wikipedia:
The more seeders there are, the better the chances of getting a higher download speed.

If we ALL seed here without upload limits and by seeding we will have much faster download! What the shit don't you understand? Think, just think if we all do this we will exchange parts of the episode! We all want to watch the F I N A L. Help for this!!!"
,jahnee,2010-05-24T18:41Z,seed you fucking greedy capitalists
,badman65,2010-05-24T18:50Z,WANKERS
,kid_charlemagne,2010-05-24T19:46Z,"why is it so much harder for people to seed things in 720p? all the other torrents for this episode is healty but for some reason the HD stuff always has few seeds. are the awerage person with highdef tv's more selfish than normal tv owners? 
to the 3500 people who actually uploads, thank you! keep on rocking in the free world wide web"
,nehirkaya,2010-05-24T20:14Z,seed please ..
,kid_charlemagne,2010-05-24T20:31Z,"i just gave up and downloaded the divx instead. you fuckers who dont seed ruins a fantastic community with your greed and selfishness. 
may polarbears sodomize your asses for eternity!"
,mentalism,2010-05-24T20:32Z,"@ Kid Charlemagne:
Because the 720p files are usually pretty big. People with low space on their hard disk copies it onto a different space to be able to keep their machines from crashing. But it's really not cool at all, always seed at least the size of what you downloaded!
@ eztv:
thanks for providing quality every week for 5 years. I can't believe Lost is over! I am already so nostalgic about watching this... can't wait to see it! 
@all: No-one is allowed to not seed this one! As soon as you have it 100 %, seed like a mofo, with ulimited upload, we are all dying to see it, that's why it takes sooo long time...
Last time we ever have to download a new episode of lost, though... :)"
,Rocker10,2010-05-24T23:26Z,Does anyone know a link to the Jimmy Kimmel Aloha to Lost special that aired right after the finale?? I can't find it anywhere!
