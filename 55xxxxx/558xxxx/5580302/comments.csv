,4142738,2010-05-25T14:03Z,"this has gotta be the worst stupid movie ever!
wasted an hour and a half watching this and was irritated the next 4 hours!!!
the opening credits itself is so god damn irritating that i should've decided to discontinue watching. for the first hour and a bit, nobody knows anything and all we get to watch are the same stupid irritating flashbacks which dont have any significance. A vERY VERY LOW BUDGET FILM i assume, so low that they couldn't hire a half-decent storywriter. DONT WASTE YOUR DAY ON THIS CRAPPY MOVIE"
,QuantamCowboy,2010-05-25T15:04Z,"I have to agree with 4142738.  This movie is a total waste of time.  A really crappy script that you find yourself fast forwarding continously just to see how it turns out.

It is a real shame that Steve Austin doesn't get some better roles as he is a real hard ass and easy to watch.

Don't waste your time and bandwidth on this one."

This movie is great in my books. Steve defo plays an interesting role in this one. Its a little jumpy at first working out whats going on but pretty much worked it out 20 minutes in and am liking it. I see its got that native American that starred in Wind Talkers and Flags of our Fathers.

This is worth a watch movie :)"
