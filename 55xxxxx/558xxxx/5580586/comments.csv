,OttifantSir,2010-05-22T12:58Z,Untill you upload something of your own: SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!
,OttifantSir,2010-05-22T13:07Z,"Having checked the torrent you speak of: I find it very messy. I like my series to be properly/uniformly named, and I don't need to see samples of every episode. This is how *I* prefer my torrents/shows, and I am guessing others do too.

For those not yet having seen the filelist: The episodes are named such - 2xep Name Of Episode.mkv

No nfo-file, because I don't need it, and usually they're not really informative. All information I need I have now provided. Season-number, proper naming, HD-quality, good show."
,OttifantSir,2010-05-22T23:16Z,"Because I have already downloaded every episode twice, once in AVI-format, then MKV, seeded most of them to a ratio of 1.2, named them with episode names, haven't downloaded the same episodes as the other torrent has collected (some of their CTU is my 2HD and vice versa), don't really have a desire to download several hundred megabytes worth of samples I'll never see, I won't be seeding the other torrent for about 3 weeks when I have to download it all over again, I'll be leeching, I like to do something for others, I like having the right to tell jerkwads like you to fuck off because I actually upload things while you haven't.

And please stop abusing the quality controls, will you? You've now given it a -4 based solely on the fact that you don't like similar torrents? How old are you? 4? 5?"
,kriptikchicken,2010-05-28T23:23Z,"I am going to support this torrent, just because 'trolkan' is acting such a baby.

""and hurting both torrents"" - eh? What? - oh the drama!"
,OttifantSir,2010-06-01T20:40Z,"I have seen some of you get 99.92% of this torrent. Has anyone completed it? I'm asking, because right now I have uploaded 56.3 GB or a ratio of 2.240 of this, and still I am the only seeder...."
,OttifantSir,2010-06-01T20:43Z,"And just as I was asking that, suddenly my bittorrent-client reports 21 seeders. From 1 (me) to 21 within 3 minutes. I'm astonished, amazed, in awe..."
,coreystone,2010-09-05T00:38Z,Thanks for the up OttifantSir...
,millennium5,2011-01-04T06:06Z,"Thanks fo a great upload, don't ever let yourself be bothered by this trolkan character. Your right we need no freakin NFO nor do we need samples for the eps.

I also like that you are using a human understandable naming convention."
,strinjim,2011-07-28T12:56Z,Thank you OttifantSir.  I signed on specifically to dl S2.
