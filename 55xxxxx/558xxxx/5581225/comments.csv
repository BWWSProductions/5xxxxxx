I don't wanna DL sumthing that could get me into trouble, u should not have posted then.... there are other/better files of the same film to DL here.... and I already did."
,ChrisKink,2010-06-08T18:49Z,"Wow, you guys are idiots. It's not 'this' file that's going to get you in trouble. It's any file. 

Any real comments here, not from dumbshits, about the quality of the rip?"
,_Dux,2011-01-10T22:51Z,"I'll comment about the quality! It is very good, a bit better than DVDrip. It's just that I think the quality could have been a bit better considering it's MKV and that size (but it's still an excellent one).
