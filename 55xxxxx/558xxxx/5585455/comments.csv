Well, seriously - I cannot encode any faster (unless you donate new PC). Lost Finale is in the ""oven"" and cooking there from the middle of the night - right now is second pass in progress (and ETA is 35 minutes). You've mentioned a size (well, I obtained a HDTV source of several GIGA first, right?)

Look conversation sanyam and me have almost two hours ago on Winnie the Pooh thread:

hi 2040
its like a request... can you plz do some magic and keep lost finale under 300mb... plzzz...cant wait for it...

@sanyam: I've calculated and calculated - but I cannot. It is too long - 1h 44m 26s - long almost as three episodes. I had ""problems"" achieving 350MB. So - it would be 350MB. Compared to Xvid - 1400 MB or 720p' 3055 MB it is small as 272p could be. Hey, reason more to mourn our little quarked friend (he could achieve 199.9 MB with utter ease)... "

,laptopdog,2010-05-24T11:42Z,"Just wanted to thank you for this episode of The Tudors (I realise it's not the world's greatest show but am still kinda hooked and I would much rather downlaod a small file like this miraculous one.. thank you.)

PS. Seen the Ashes finale yet??"

@laptopdog: Yeah, I did, last evening. And you know what? I am not disappointed with ending. It has been in sync with A2A premise, BTW. few camera shoots have anthological value and -  acting was wonderful. Some dialogs are beautifull... and some were endlessly funny. Great, great series, one of the best UK serials ever done."
