,ContraX,2010-06-06T12:19Z,"yeah, Winrar torrent and the Winrar instal file is in a winrar file..... WTF, if u are downloading this torrent, u download it becuse you don't have winrar."
,Maoxx,2010-06-10T23:15Z,"Your Winrar exe is winrared. You sure you thought this through properly, Bigwimpie?"
,Putrid186,2010-06-15T19:16Z,"This place is laden with morons putting winrar installers in rar files.  It's like some sort of gag reel.  Really, winrar isn't that large of an installation file."
,glenn6h,2010-06-16T20:20Z,"lol bigwimpie u r weirdo :D
winrar is winrar-ed haha"
,KingXerxes,2010-06-20T08:13Z,Why the bloody hell is this in a rar file? zip would be acceptable - but raring winrar? really?
,xCh3wyx,2010-06-21T06:40Z,"Works great, easy install, but it is in a .rar file (Seriously?) so it is probably best to use this to upgrade your WinRar."
,Dave_247,2010-06-24T07:08Z,"Could have put in a ZIP, windows can use of that at least."
,Dave_247,2010-06-24T07:10Z,Maybe he thought it be funny...
,Catbodi,2010-06-27T12:09Z,"Thanks bigwimpie it really works perfect.

,Damien_74,2010-07-19T00:35Z,Why did I not read comments.. This release is rar-ed. Cant think of anything more stupid!
,morteusX,2010-07-20T02:50Z,Thanks for the upload; and LOL and Winrar torrent that is Rar'd. what circular logic
,coolio1007,2010-07-20T05:25Z,Thanks man works 100%
,sanachama,2010-07-21T00:32Z,"You're people are the hilarious ones.. 
Winrar has free usable versions everywhere. if you're REALLY getting your first winrar version HERE then you're the one's that fail at life.
winrar's a necessary program to have first thing on a computer. just cause you actually need to go pirate a full version first hand doesn't make the uploader the stupid one."
,koolscorptheking,2010-07-30T15:13Z,sorry guys i m bit dumb on this can some one tell me where to paste the key to register. thanks
,koolscorptheking,2010-07-30T15:16Z,sorry guys i m bit dumb on this can some one tell me where to paste the key to register. thanks.
,koolscorptheking,2010-07-30T15:27Z,"thanks a lot bigwimpie i got it..
working like a charm.."
,jaymac407,2010-07-31T21:04Z,OP is a fucktard. Distributing WinRAR in a RAR file? Well that's a new one.
,halfaKing0,2010-08-01T11:59Z,"@koolscorptheking. There is file in Program Files called WinRAR. Copy the key and then paste it in that folder. Excellent job, for those who complain about the RAR file, just download the trial version only to unrar the file and then remove it to instal that version...."
,quic,2010-08-13T01:07Z,"7zip is much better than this, as far as system resource consumption and file compression speeds."
,LordLoktar,2010-08-15T17:41Z,Thanks man works real nice
,Grohl,2010-09-06T20:20Z,"Well done!

*facepalm*"
,BLV3-B34RD,2010-11-30T22:04Z,Why did you make it a RAR file? I was looking for something to extract from RAR! (>_
,fonyfreak,2011-01-17T21:18Z,"To all you retards bitching about the fact that this is RAR'ed:

Go download the trial version from RARLabs, then use this version to upgrade.
