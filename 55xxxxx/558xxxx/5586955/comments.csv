I've even asked AK 1200 himself, because I'm a friend of his & he told me that he doesn't even have it anymore.  It would be REALLY FANTABULOUS if some one out there put up the Discography of ALL of his stuff.  That Would Totally Rock!!!!  Please drop me an email as soon as you post Thr Discography or Fully Automatic or Both....jokerswild_travels@yahoo.com.  Thanks Everyone & please pass this on so that the word gets out of what I'm looking for."
