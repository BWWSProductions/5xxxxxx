,Motocrossmus,2010-05-24T12:08Z,"Hi Slicknick, i just wanted to say thanks for al the torrents! 

I will definitely give you an donation becouse i know that recording these races takes time and money!

One more thing. When i play these file on my Xbox i just rename them to .AVI and they work

Example
Original: 2010 AMA Motocross Rd 1 Hangtown HD 720p Slicknick610.mp4

New: 2010 AMA Motocross Rd 1 Hangtown HD 720p Slicknick610.AVI"

Always here, even for the outdoors !!
Great !!"
,charlestoast,2010-05-24T19:28Z,"I had trouble getting this to play on my laptop,(C2D 1.83Ghz, 2GB RAM,XP)which already had ffdshow, media player classic and vlc media player amongst other things. I was getting 50% dropped frames. I then downloaded and installed a K-Lite Codec Pack/Media Player Classic combo installer (7MB from TPB) and that purged all the old stuff and sorted things. No dropped frames now, perfect! So if you're having similar problems, I'd recommend the re-install and clean up. Don't blame it on slicknick!"
,dd15,2010-05-25T01:23Z,"just ran new codec pack with mp classic, can watch now but audio lags behind and freezes video every so often till it catches up
could this be a RAM issue?  1.5gig ddr1 :$"
,piratebaysux,2010-05-25T10:45Z,"Thanks Slick. Looking forward to a cracker series.
From Korea."
,poorliltweaker,2010-05-26T08:28Z,How do I get this to play correctly? its out of sync or the video is in slow mo and the announcers a far ahead on VLC and KMplayer.
,poorliltweaker,2010-05-26T08:32Z,"ahh damn I didn't see the instructions lol, I got it working,.... thx slick!!!"
