This is the latest release of Smart Scroll 3.6.3. It adds a cool inertial scrolling feature to Mac OS X. Makes scrolling like iphone scrolling. Super fun and efficient. 
I will seed for a week(ish) or until 15 or so people have it. (I know it says 0 seeders right now, but I promise I am seeding at 20 mb/s.)

Hopefully this one works, sorry.

Please COMMENT and SEED.
