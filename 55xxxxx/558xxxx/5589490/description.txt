CARP ADVENTURES AFRICA DVD REVIEWS:

 

"...Once again you have created a quality DVD, only this is the best of the lot. Totally stunning film work and in a country that is so beautiful. The fish are amazing and the intro over the waterfall is breathtaking.

I now have the complete set of films and a super leather-bound copy of your book. You can be proud of this work and I look forward to the next chapter in your very interesting life..." - Gerry Richards.
