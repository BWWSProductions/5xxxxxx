DJ's will love it, crowds will dance to it.

DJ friendly intro with immediately recognizable theme from ""Tom' Diner"". Solid, quick build into a pulsing electro-house groove. A quick vocal break, and then Ludacris makes his entrance, with the acapella from ""How Low"" making this one fun to play, sure to pack floors, and likely to get stuck in your head.
