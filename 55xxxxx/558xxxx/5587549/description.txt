Instead of releasing a second volume of his excellent "Chip Tricks" DVD, Rich Ferguson re-releases the first DVD with lots of variations and new tricks. He has effectively taken a great DVD and made it even stronger, and thereâ€™s seemingly nothing that Ferguson canâ€™t do with a single poker chip or stack of chips. Whether you want to twirl, stack, toss, shuffle or roll poker chips, Fergusonâ€™s first rate DVD shows you how. 

Variations 
The original Chip Tricks Volume 1 released with some 20 stunts while this re-release offers some 70 stunts that include the 20 from the first DVD. While there are some new flourishes, many are variations on a single flourish. 

For example, Fergusonâ€™s â€œButterfly,â€ a poker chip variation on a coin rollout, now comes in multiple variations that include: â€œFat Butterfly,â€ â€œButterfly Balance,â€ â€œButterfly Collapseâ€ and more. On the first DVD, Ferguson offered a few variations with some flourishes, but didnâ€™t count them as single â€œtricks.â€ They were simply discussed with the main flourish. Despite this, the new DVD is indeed far more comprehensive than the first title. 

Coin and Card-Like 
New to the collection are Fergusonâ€™s â€œcatches,â€ â€œspinningâ€ and various â€œtosses.â€ Catches are variations on those old coin tricks where you, for example, rest a stack of quarters on your elbow or back of your hand and attempt to quickly reach up and snatch them out of the air. The flashy â€œspinsâ€ and â€œtosses,â€ where Ferguson causes chips to fly through the air and then catches them or causes them to return in different ways, are welcome new additions to the flourish collection. 

Interestingly, Ferguson adapts some card moves to poker chips. â€œDribblingâ€ of chips is just as you would with cards. And some chip tosses are variations on card spinning. Ferguson also offers a â€œSybilâ€ style four-way cut (Chris Kennerâ€™s original with cards is a five-way cut) using chips. Since he teaches his four-way cut on another DVD, he doesnâ€™t explain it here but encourages viewers to refer to that DVD. 

Great Learning Tool 
The DVD features professional production values and throughout, Ferguson does a great job of explaining and teaching each flourish. Some of the flourishes can be adapted to coin work.
