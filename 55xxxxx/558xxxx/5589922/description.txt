Christina Lindberg (THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE and ANITA) stars in this incredibly sexy US-Swedish co-production. Young Inga (Lindberg), a country milk maid, longs for a trip to Stockholm, the Swedish capital. Leaving her rural home for a weekend in the big city, Inga soon discovers her beauty and (ample assets) gets her into a bit of trouble!

Deserting her country life sensibilities for a slice of urban values, Ingaâ€™s romantic adventures will shock and entertain! MAID IN SWEDEN is an erotic coming of age story and is one of the very first film roles for cult-film starlet, Christina Lindberg.
