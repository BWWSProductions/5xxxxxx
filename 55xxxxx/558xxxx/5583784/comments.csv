,Doloranal,2010-06-24T21:10Z,"does it run with a original copy of the game (not GOTY) if not what should i do for playing the game en mac?:

Will it run smooth (nearly 20-25fps) with an nvidia 9400M core 2 duo 5,56ghz 4GB RAM??? (MBP 2009)

I used crossover to do the install

,LooseMorals,2010-12-06T15:57Z,"Hi, I'm not an expert in these wrappers, the best place to ask is here: http://portingteam.com/ for general questions. It is were the original full game wrapper came from. All I did was delete the Fallout directory. I tested by replacing the directory with one I installed into VMWare from GOTY PC installer.

The alternative is to download the game already wrapped.
"
,LooseMorals,2010-12-06T16:00Z,The reason I prepared a wrapper only was there was some demand for it on http://portingteam.com/ where one had expired and was no longer available.
,LooseMorals,2010-12-06T16:02Z,@ Dolorana Yes thats correct. Just install GOTY in VMWare then copy the Fallout Directory into the wrapper.
,LooseMorals,2010-12-06T16:04Z,"@ Dolorana - sorry correction, just re-read your post. Its not tested on the normal game. Just try it and see what luck you have."

,notthat1guybuttheother,2011-09-21T15:36Z,Every time I try to install the game into the wrapper it freezes up at the beginning of the installation. I've tried several different FO3 downloads and they all do the same. Anyone know what to do?

,LooseMorals,2011-12-04T08:53Z,"Intall the game in VMWare, then move it to the wrapper"
,LooseMorals,2011-12-04T08:54Z,"@edvanvesstid yes it will work, if you get the game of the year edition."

,Elias1618,2012-06-17T20:38Z,"Having a strange issue. I used Crossover and installed it where it's supposed to and it runs great, however the strange part is no matter what resolution setting I put (I tried 1920x1080 for my 21.5 iMac) it goes fullscreen but half of it is only actual game. The rest is black screen. If you could get back to me on this I'd really appreciate it."
