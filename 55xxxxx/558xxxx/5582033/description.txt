The Beach Boys are an American rock band, formed in 1961, who gained popularity for their close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of cars, surfing, and romance. Brian Wilson's growing creative ambitions later transformed them into a more artistically innovative group that earned critical praise and influenced many later musicians.
The group was initially composed of singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers, Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. This core quintet was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 1988.

Trying to collect a complete, and I mean complete, discography with all Beach Boys releases seems to be almost impossible. According to Wiki there are 28 studio albums (32 with the live albums). According to AMG there are 38 albums (including live albums). The compilations seems to be countless/innumerable. And I don't even want to think of all unofficial releases.

But here's one more contribution to your collection. Enjoy!
