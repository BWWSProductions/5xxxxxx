Nurse Jackie is an American dark comedy series that premiered on June 8, 2009 on Showtime, Movie Central and The Movie Network. The series stars Edie Falco as title character Jackie Peyton, a "flawed" emergency room nurse at All Saints' Hospital in New York City. For Jackie, "Every day is a high wire act of juggling patients, doctors, fellow nurses and her own indiscretions." Showtime says the half-hour series "is at turns wicked, heartbreaking and funny." On November 6, 2009, Showtime announced that season two of Nurse Jackie will premiere on March 22, 2010. Nurse Jackie was created by Liz Brixius, Linda Wallem, and Evan Dunsky, with Brixius and Wallem serving as showrunners for the series and sharing executive producer duties with Caryn Mandabach and John Melfi. Showtime initially ordered 12 episodes. Before the series premiered, Brixius told the New York Daily News that "Guys' stories tend to be about conquests â€” getting the job, winning the Olympics, whatever. Women stories aren't as immediately climactic so they need to play out over the course of three months ... And every medical show out there has been about doctors.
