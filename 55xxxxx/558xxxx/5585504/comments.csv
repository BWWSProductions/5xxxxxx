Thanks for your steady supply (not only) to LOST fans overseas who otherwiese would have had to wait half a year or more before they'd show it on TV (translated... ), and I don't receive HD TV ^^

Although IMO the airtightness of the story degraded towards the end, I'm still burning to see how things turn out :-D

cheers"

,matrices,2010-05-25T18:36Z,"People should know that there is an additional 30 seconds of the show that's not shown in this download (some cable companies made a mistake).

It pretty definitively settles the 'debate' (not that there really is much of one if you're paying attention) as to whether the island itself and what happened on it is real or part of purgatory."
