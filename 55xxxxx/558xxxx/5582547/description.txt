PLEASE KEEP SEEDING - Movie: Cunnamulla (2000), Australian, Language: English 

Difficult to find on DVD

"Cunnamulla, 800 kilometres west of Brisbane, is the end of the railway line. In the months leading up to a scorching Christmas in the bush, there's a lot more going on than the annual lizard race. Here, Aboriginal and white Australians live together but apart. Creativity struggles against indifference, eccentricity against conformity.
