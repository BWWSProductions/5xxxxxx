[V],mothergoose56,2010-05-25T04:35Z,"This is a link to the May 22nd Unmasked with Colin Quinn, by request CF64K. 
It originally aired on ""Raw Dog"" Comedy 150 which is compressed even worse 
than 202. I was going to do a 128k up but there's no point. Also, even 
though I set it for an extra 5 minutes (guess I'll do 15 next time) it 
didn't get the whole show (it's 58 min 49 sec.) so no torrent from me.
