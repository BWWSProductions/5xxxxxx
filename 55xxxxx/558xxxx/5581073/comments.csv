,Azgamer,2010-07-06T17:43Z,"Watching this on my 1680x1050, I was actually surprised at the quality of this 500+mb version of the movie.

While getting a better version may suite some, I only wanted to watch it once, and this was easily a good choice. Fast download, and relatively good quality."

Follow this link:

Enjoy!!!

P.S. The sixth movie's credit goes to YIFY. Its his work after all. i just put them together. "
,Anti11,2010-12-23T16:10Z,"Great seeding and quick download. But at such a low bitrate 720p does not make any sense at all. If you plan to play on an HD TV, resolution will be poor every time there is movement, and heavy pixelation is evident in many scenes. 
Sound is also mediocre, as it is only sampled at 34 KHz and 2 channels. A far cry from a 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS.
So, download it only if you plan to watch it on your laptop."
,DrkPrncss,2011-01-06T10:30Z,Great rip. Awesome upload! Thanks. :-)
