192kbps recording of the Led Zeppelin concert April 27th 1969 at the Fillmore West in San Francisco.

The recording sounds quite fine (good microphone job?), and I take it as an excellent capsule of the earlier-era Led Zep show

Artist: "Led Zeppelin"
Album: "1969.04.27 - The Fillmore West (San Francisco)"
Date: "1969"
Genre: "Rock"

(That date system ensures that it will sort chronologically with other live recordings that are labeled in a similar manner.)

Tracknumbered as if it was one disc, even though the show was longer than 80 minutes.
Tracks 1 through 6 on CD1 and tracks 7 through 11 on CD2 if you wish to put it on disc.
