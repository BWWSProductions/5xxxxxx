,5oL1DaR15,2010-05-23T22:24Z,"The subtitles are already in the movie. Apparently the film has them by default, or the feature the guy watched had them.

A: 7.0/10
V: 6.5/10

It's definitely one of the better TS copies I've seen but the angle at which the person shot the film makes it difficult to read the subtitle lines at times."
,akouisy,2010-05-24T03:10Z,it took me 3 hrs to finish d-load then watched it.. friends I m telling u now .. don't waste your time to download this one.. video/audio are terrible. pls wait until the real DVD coming out later. I personally love the first 2 ONG BAK movies Tony Jar is gymastic guy and some of his movies are broadcasting  on American cable network..it is rare to see international films on american cable network...

Bare bones r if its not a good copy dont bitch n cuss your friendly uploader out but comment with your constructive views ,zombie and kingbe this is the best course of action thanx"
,heavydiamond,2010-06-13T20:22Z,oh yeah zombie boy this is a cam it says it after the title expect less than good quality and if its good thanx and praise what i suggest is as your name is zombie boy shoot yourself in the head
,bartlaz,2010-06-17T19:00Z,"thank you poothaijaa
i'm sure the dvd hasn't been released yet. here in Bangkok no authorized shop have it, and on street u can find only this cam copy. must wait, but for sure will be released without english subtitles at first, as most of the thai movies"
,BreezeLou,2010-06-30T21:17Z,thank you !
,novamdm,2010-07-05T12:16Z,"First off, thankyou poothaijaa, I appreciate the upload.

It's hard to believe this is the same Tony Jaa from the first two Ong Baks and The Protector.  The action is few and far between.  There is far too much dream sequence and torture scenes.

V6 - It's grainy and blocky and high contrast, but its a cam so...acceptable. Frequent ""skipping""
A5 - meh

Subtitles: At parts of the movie, like the first 20 minutes, maybe 40% of the subtitles are readable.  The other 60% are placed against light background and impossible to read (for me at least).  For the majority of the movie though, the subtitles are off screen.  So if you are counting on the subs to understand what is going on, tough shit.

,ken_70450,2010-08-07T08:13Z,พวกนี้ใจร้อนไม่รอ ดีวีดี ฮ่าๆๆ
,Hybrid_Styles,2010-08-11T05:26Z,"Not going to get this movie until the DVD rip, but many thanks to you poothaijaa. It takes alot for these guys to go out and risk their time, money, and effort in recording these movies. Lets give them as much respect as possible for their hard work and dedication. Fuck all the haters."
