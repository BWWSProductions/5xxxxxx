Bonkers is an animated American television series that aired from September 4, 1993 to December 21, 1995 in first-run syndication (after a "preview airing" on the Disney Channel). The syndicated run was available both separately, and as part of The Disney Afternoon. The show was last seen on Toon Disney, but was taken off the schedule in late 2004.

The series originated from an attempt at a television adaptation of the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which never reached production due to legal complications. As a result, the show created original characters, but still set the action in a Roger Rabbit-like world where "toons" and humans co-exist. Unlike the film that inspired it, however, Bonkers was entirely animated and featured no live-action.
