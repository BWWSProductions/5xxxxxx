Plot
In modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater), interviews a man named Louis (Brad Pitt), who claims to be a vampire and tells the story of his past.

Louis' story begins in Louisiana in 1791, when he was 24 and suffering from a death wish after the loss of his wife and child. The vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers him a chance to be reborn and proceeds to turn him into a vampire. Lestat teaches Louis how to live as a vampire. At first Louis rebels against hurting humans, drinking animal blood instead, but he finally succumbs and kills his faithful housemaid .He tries to kill himself by setting fire to his house, but Lestat rescues him and they flee.

In New Orleans, Louis gives in to his bloodlust again, and bites a young girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst),whom Lestat later transforms into a vampire "daughter", to discourage Louis from leaving him. Lestat begins to teach Claudia how to live like a vampire, making her copy his actions, as to killing. As thirty years pass, Claudia becomes a sadistic killer and closely bonded to Louis and Lestat. But when 
she realizes that she will live forever but never grow up, she becomes furious with Lestat. By tricking him into drinking the blood of the corpses of twin boys, whom she killed by overdosing them with Laudanum, knowing that blood from the body of a creature already dead is fatal to vampires. She weakens him and apparently kills him. She and Louis dump Lestat's body in a swamp but he later returns, having drained the blood of swamp creatures to survive. Lestat attacks them but Louis sets him on fire and flees to Paris with Claudia, assuming Lestat is dead.
