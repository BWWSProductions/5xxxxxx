This very rare piece of art (Like my friend said) is a recording from The "Nasty Music" Concert in Europe 1973 (that is what i found on the internet i don't know for sure).

This Record was hard to remaster because it was deformed filthy and the auto cleaning function recognized almost the whole allbum as NOISE ;P.

Never the less for the real fans i think it's good, clean and clear enough.

A name was also mentioned on the record SODD (Singer's Original DoubleDisk) NR: 012



The piece of vinyl is recorded with a M-Audio Delta 1010 and the turntable is modified by myself, The needle frame is also designed by me.






I hope you enjoy it and appreciate my work...




Have fun...

P.S. "Angie" has 1 big pop impossible to avoid because of the quality of the press..
