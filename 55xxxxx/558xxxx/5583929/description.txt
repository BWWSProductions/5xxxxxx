From Amazon.co.uk
We can more or less deduce the following of the main protagonist in Choke; Victor Mancini is a ruthless con artist. Victor Mancini is a medical school dropout whoâ€™s taken a job playing an Irish indentured servant in a colonial-era theme park in order to help care for his Alzehimerâ€™s-afflicted mother. Victor Mancini is a sex addict. Victor Mancini is a direct descendant of Jesus Christ. Welcome, once again, to the world of Chuck Palahniuk.

â€œArt never comes from happinessâ€ says Manciniâ€™s mother only a few pages into the novel. Given her own dicey and melodramatic style of parenting, you would think that her sonâ€™s life would be chock full of nothing but art. Alas, thatâ€™s not the caseâ€”in the fine tradition of Oedipus, Stephen Dedalus and Anthony Soprano, Victor hasnâ€™t quite reconciled his issues with his mother. Instead, heâ€™s trawling sexual-addiction recovery meetings for dates and purposely choking in restaurants for a few moments of attention. Longing for a hug, in other words, heâ€™s settling for the Heimlich.

Thematically, this is pretty familiar Palanhiuk territory. It would be a pity to disclose the surprises of the plot but suffice to say that what we have here is a little bit of Tom Robbinsâ€™s Another Roadside Attraction, a little bit of Don DeLilloâ€™s The Day Room and, well, a little bit of Fight Club. Just as with that book and the other two novels under Palahniukâ€™s belt, we get a smattering of gloriously unflinching sound bites, such as this sceptical slight on prayer chains: â€œA spiritual pyramid scheme. As if you can gang up on God. Bully him around.â€

Whether this is the novel that will break Palanhiuk into the mainstream is hard to say. For a fourth book, in fact, the ratio of iffy, â€œdudeâ€-intensive dialogue to interesting and insightful passages is a little higher than we might wish. In the end though, the authorâ€™s nerve and daring pull the whole thing offâ€”just. And whatâ€™s next for Victor Manciniâ€™s creator? Leave the last word to him, declaring as he does on the final pages: â€œMaybe itâ€™s our job to invent something better â€¦ What itâ€™s going to be, I donâ€™t know.â€ â€”Bob Michaels, Amazon.com â€”This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

â€œIF YOUâ€™RE GOING TO READ THIS, DONâ€™T BOTHER.
After a couple pages, you wonâ€™t want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while youâ€™re still in one piece.
Save yourself.
There has to be something better on television. Or since you have so much time on your hands, maybe you could take a night course. Become a doctor. You could make something out of yourself. Treat yourself to a dinner out. Color your hair.
Youâ€™re not getting any younger.
What happens here is first going to piss you off. After that it just gets worse and worse.â€
