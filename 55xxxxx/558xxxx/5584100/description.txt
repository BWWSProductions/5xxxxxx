***************
"Italy, 1757. Meek tailor Pippo Popolino disguises himself as the great Casanova in order to romance attractive widow Francesca. He little suspects what he's getting into: locked into the incongruous role by the greed of the real Casanova's creditors, Pippo must journey to Venice on a delicate mission far beyond his capabilities..."
