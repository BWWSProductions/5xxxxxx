,SpaceMutant8,2010-07-14T18:10Z,"What the fuck? I found a better CSS torrent so I try to get that one. So I delete this torrent, then delete what I downloaded and I get this error message when I try to delete: nn\""Cannot delete Counter-Strike Source - Deluxe edition: It is being used by another person or program.nnClose any programs that might be using the file and try again.\"" nnnWell of course I thought it was just uTorrent torrenting it, but I stopped the torrent, deleted it, and exited uTorrent, it still happens. I think this could be a virus or something, but I doubt it. nnWhat should I do?"
