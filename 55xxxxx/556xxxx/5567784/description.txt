    From the dawn of the sexual revolution comes the outrageous and true     
    story of 1970s gay porn icon Jack Wrangler. Jack rose to become a        
    major brand name in adult entertainment, as well as a hero to the        
    newly liberated gay population, only to cross over to straight movies    
    and fall in love with famous vocalist Margaret Whiting.
