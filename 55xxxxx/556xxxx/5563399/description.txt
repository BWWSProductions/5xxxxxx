"Electric Blue" is a 1987 hit single by the Australian  rock  / synthpop  band Icehouse and was co-written by Iva Davies of Icehouse and John Oates of the U.S. band Hall & Oates. The single reached number one on the Australian singles chart on 16 November 1987, number seven on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart the same year, and number 53 on the UK singles charts. Released in August it was the second single from their number one album Man of Colours on Regular Records in Australia and, with a slightly different cover, on Chrysalis Records for European and North American releases.

The video clip for Electric Blue was shot on the roof of 189 Liverpool Street, Sydney City, Australia. It is now the YWCA Hotel aka "Y On The Park".

John Oates became involved with Davies after contacting him to state he was a fan. The resulting collaboration produced this song and Oates has stated that if Davies had not released the song under the Icehouse name then it would have been a Hall and Oates track.

A remix version by Skipraiders was released on the Icehouse album Meltdown in 2002. In July 2007, it was covered by pop artist Steve Ward at the Pink Lemonade Breast Cancer Foundation fundraiser.
