Crowley thoroughly explored many aspects of spirituality, the occult, and the physical world during his lifetime. He gained a notorious reputation for his occult writings, drug use, and hedonism. However, unbeknownst to many people, he was also an accomplished mountaineer, poet, yogi, chess player, painter, and astrologer. Due to his notoriety the title of "The Wickedest Man in the World" was bestowed upon him by British tabloids, and even his own mother proclaimed him to be "The Beast", a nickname that he would eventually readily adopt.

"The Great Beast Speaks" collects early 20th century recordings of Aleister Crowley. The claim that this collection features every Crowley recording in existence is false. Though they are very few in number, there are Crowley recordings which aren't featured on this album. Opinions vary on the year that this was recorded, but most experts agree that it was recorded circa 1920, which would have made Crowley close to 45 years old at the time. These were originally recorded on wax cylinders, and later digitally transferred. The quality is still very poor despite the digital transfer, but if you want to hear Crowley this is the only option that you have.
