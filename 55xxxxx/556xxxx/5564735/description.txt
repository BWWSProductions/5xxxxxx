A small-time Vancouver drug dealer traverses through time in a desperate bid to alter the grim fate of his comatose girlfriend in this bittersweet time travel fantasy from first-time director David Ray. Art (Jay Baruchel) is a petty drug slinger whose relationship with girlfriend and addict Cody (Sarah Lind) is starting to get serious. After Art arrives home one evening to find Cody overdosed on the floor and drifting into a coma, he seeks refuge at the home of eccentric junk collector Harvey (Jim Byrnes) â€” an old street friend who claims that the ratty recliner he has recently acquired is actually a cleverly disguised time machine. Immediately dismissing his friendâ€™s outlandish claim but desperate to fulfill his promise that he will always be there to protect her, Art collapses in the chair and wishes himself back to the time before Cody became addicted to drugs. Upon awakening in another time, Art realizes that the chair is in fact the real deal and embarks on a desperate mission to change the future and save Codyâ€™s life.
