,VicVega,2010-06-10T04:40Z,"Hey, any plans on putting out a 720p recode of this one? That would be good.

This one doesn't have as high picture quality as the R5 rips but at least it's true widescreen. I think I'm going to wait till the real DVD or Bluray rips come out though.

Yeah I heard it sucks but hey, Laura Vandervoort is in it. "
