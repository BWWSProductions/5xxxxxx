Danko Jones takes a lot of flak for the trend-averse sensibility that fuels his
unapologetic cock rock. But the Mango Kid (does anyone even call him that any
more?) is bound to have the last, Gene Simmonsâ€“sized laugh as his riff-laden,
pop-inflected, high-energy jams are as catchy and punchy as ever on the trioâ€™s
fifth full-length, Below the Belt.  â€œMagic Snakeâ€ is full of AC/DCâ€“worthy
innuendo while â€œFull of Regretâ€ and â€œI Think Bad Thoughtsâ€ are decent anthems of
excess. Leaving the slightly psychedelic production of Never Too Loud behind,
however, robs BtB of dynamics and makes for little distinction among the 11
tracks. â€œActive Volcanoes,â€ on the other hand, offers the sort of â€™70s-sounding
cowbell rock that should play well with the KISS crowd.
