Thanks for the upload extremezone.

About the movie, its your average nothing special post apoc movie. In my opinion little better than ""the road"".

What I dislike about those movies is you always have the same stock of unrealistic post apoc characters that in my honest opinion wont exist in such worlds.
For instance the majority of the world being pillagers on roadbikes with bad teeth killing everybody on sight."

I don't even have to read the comments for your rips!  If you are the upload er, I already know that the quality is good and the movie is real with no viruses embed-ed!

If someone can show me how, I will put up 100s of DVD/BR rips of the finest quality.  I just got a new computer with dual 750G hard drives and a DVD ROM/burner with 6 gigs of ram and a dual processor, so I have plenty of memory to put up movies, I just don;t have the know how.

,carly2010,2010-08-14T19:56Z,Great Movie if IT HAD AUDIO!!!!!
,Sekiro,2010-08-24T10:41Z,"I guess that the majority of the people who have commented negatively on this movie suffers from close to non-existing intelligence.

This movie is a masterpiece and simply put a work of art. From the CC of the film (which suits perfectly to this ""judgement day scenery"" to the audio and soundtrack, it's technically by far the best film of the year.

And the cast didn't let the technical side down. They worked VERY well together. Denzel is awesome  as well, Mila is getting better for every film and Gary Oldman is great as the ""baddy"".

The story is probably not ALL that original, but still original enough to keep one seated for the entire film. I found it to be brilliant.


Even though I haven't watched Inception yet, I still consider this to be the best film this year and I'm highly recommending it to anyone with more neurons than the average showed on these pages.

Go watch Operation Endgame or Toystory 3 instead haters, that'll probably suit your intelligence better!"

It seems like a lot of people get butt hurt when anything deals with religion. I mean come on, if something like this offends you, I really feel sorry for you. I'm guessing a lot of little kids come on this website.

V=10 (perfect quality, at least for me)
A=4 (can barely hear the dialog)
M=8 (mila is yummy)

Turning on ""loudness equalization"" helps, like someone else stated. If you're in Windows 7 right click your speaker --> playback --> click a device --> properties --> enhancements --> loudness equalization."

,TomCatJak,2010-09-13T01:57Z,"To the people who are commenting on how bad the movie was. Shut the fuck up. No one cares about your opinion all they want to know is how the quality was, go to IMDB if you want to post a rant that nobody will ever give a damn about."
,pleblian,2010-09-15T09:09Z,"Sekiro

It was nice of MAX to share the file but the movie was no where near brilliant. 

""A street car named desire"" or even ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" was brilliant, TBOE was ok at best.

I find people who like this movie are religious but people who think this movie was brilliant are religious fanatics."
,Sekiro,2010-09-17T00:45Z,"pleblian, I find it funny that you call me religious. In fact, you calling me ""a religious fanatic"" is probably the joke of the year.


I'm baptized and that's it. I didn't confirm ""the belief"" when I was 14 (as the only one of my mates).

Moreover, I see religion as an excuse. An excuse, that some (allright, a lot) need in their life to have so when they fuck up (and they will), they can turn to their religion and say that it's ""Gods"" way etc.



Even though I often proclaim that ""Religion is the root of all evil"" I must say, that I CAN see beauty of the 10 commandments, but that's more due to the morality.


Anyway, what I was trying to say was that you couldn't be anymore off than you are, when you're calling me religious. It's an awesome film with an awesome cast, it's hands down the best film of the year, although Shutter Island is up there too.

As others might have pointed out already, Denzel's a muslim, he plays a christian in the film. That's another effing ""brilliant"" aspect of this film."
,bluetigerusa,2010-09-17T07:36Z,"wow sounds like a great movie  this guy who runs down the movie must watch movies like 

MacGruber"
,mR-EMiRO,2010-09-18T20:53Z,"You never get to know if he's blind or not, but with the extreme sun, it's highly likely he is.

A very good post-apocalyptic movie! 9/10 from me. If you are mature enough. If you're not, go watch Twilight instead.

@Sekiro: Religion has caused alot of damage to the world. I'm a non-believer myself. 
But to be honest, religion has had an enormous impact on society in a good way, like ethics. ""You shall not kill"" is one of the ground rules religion has empowered.

Believing in something greater also helps sick people find meaning and peace, which I see everyday at work.

But, yeah. Religion has and still cause alot of damage. This movie is a flawless example of that. Go watch it, guys ;) "

LOL you're saying a film about the bible is good, and telling ppl that they're retarded.. that's just wrong..
