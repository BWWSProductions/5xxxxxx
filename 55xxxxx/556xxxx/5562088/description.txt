http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1312234/



After his fiancee breaks up with him and gets engaged to another man, Dennis can't get over the idea that the cheap engagement ring he bought may have triggered it. When she dies, he convinces two grave robbers to steal the new ring from her body, in hopes of learning how much true love really cost, whilst partaking in "wet" cigarettes.
