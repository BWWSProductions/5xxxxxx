,NitrogenUA,2010-05-15T14:16Z,"btw, the game is called Naruto Shippuuden Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, so noone will be able to find your torrent by exact match."
,crazyedex,2010-05-15T20:40Z,Does it work?
,dontforgetp,2010-05-15T21:49Z,"Still receiving the 8002013c error on 5.50 GEN-D3, followed readme instructions. If anyone who got this working can post their EXACT settings, that'd be helpful. "
,crazyedex,2010-05-15T23:54Z,"Ok i got the game working... it's currently installing Game data... it said that extra 400mb is required for game data.... haven't actually played yet but got into main menu :D

PS! It requires extra 460+mb dont remember how much exactly less than 500.... So if u dont have that much space then dont download it :)"
,bboyeyohh,2010-05-16T01:14Z,"iv got the same problem as dontforgetp.

help pleasee !!!
"
,dontforgetp,2010-05-16T03:33Z,"Alright, got it working. The reason this doesn't work is because the KHBBS patch included is missing files. Either google and find it, or just download the patch portion in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5565849/%5BPSP%5DNaruto_Shippuuden__Ultimate_Ninja_Heroes_3%5BUSA%5D%5BFIX%5D 

 After that the game should run fine as long as the patch is enabled. It's also worth noting that the additional requirement this torrent's readme says are not needed, such as disabling VSHMenu or using Debug Fake Region"
