FAQ from http://www.mileswebsolutions.com/FSXTextureConversion/

Q2.  	Can it be done with scenery addons installed?

A2.  	Absolutely.  This installer only replaces your default textures... stuff like the ground, snow, terrain, trees.  Addon scenery (airports, etc) will not be affected. "
,vittupaa1980,2010-05-16T18:02Z,"forget my last comment 

FAQ allso says

I wouldn't recommend using these texture conversions for the REX textures, because distortion can occur when converting 3rd party addons. I recommend using these conversions with the default FSX textures only."""

,fuzdemon,2012-01-04T04:48Z,Maybe its only a frame rate boost if you are using a pure default install of FS.
