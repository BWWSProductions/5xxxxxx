,Monoespacial,2011-02-12T03:04Z,@Luvli3 how did you got the real names for the files?
,bloitz,2011-04-08T22:20Z,"A few of these files have their audio/video run out of sync after a while. No major problem if you use VLC media player (which you should ;) ). Press H to decrease audio delay, or  J to increase it. 
Otherwise, good stuff. A: 7.5 V: 7.5

Thank you damasta55"
