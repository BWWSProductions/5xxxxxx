"Bright Falls" is a mindblowing six-part web series directed by Phillip Van. It's also the prequel to Remedy's psychological action thriller Alan Wake (Xbox 360). This is all six mini-episodes merged into one 32 minute video. I also took the liberty to replace the intros/outros in between episodes with just the title for each episode. If you're experiencing playback problems, I suggest trying VLC media player.
