Abraham Abroad: The England and Ireland Tour Video
Vortex of Creation Series - 2 DVD Set 
http://www.abraham-hickslawofattraction.com/lawofattractionstore/index.html

During one week in May 2008, Esther and Jerry Hicks presented a series of workshops in London, Bristol and Dublin. During these presentations the enthusiasm of the attendees elicited from Abraham a flow of ideas which have become central to their teachings. The power of the questions and the clarity of the answers make this distillation of those seminars uniquely historic.

Join Esther and Jerry on their only journey "across the pond" and share the best from five unprecedented workshops, during which Abraham's Vortex concept was born. Includes behind-the-scenes footage and original music.

However, the donor, who just came into the possession of these original, two tapes, says, "The best I can achieve is a black-and-white copy from this material. This has to do with the tape being recorded in NTSC format and my equipment originally being PAL.â€ Can you help us to convert these NTSC tapes into DVD format and share them with us via a torrent?

Jerry & Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abrahamâ„¢ are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

â€œThe thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.â€

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham â€” whom Esther calls â€œinfinite intelligenceâ€ and Jerry refers to as â€œthe purest form of love Iâ€™ve ever encountered.â€
