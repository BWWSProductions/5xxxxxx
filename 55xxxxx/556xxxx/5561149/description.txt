About The Baseballs
The Baseballs are three certified rock 'n' roll singers who bring back the essence of the 50's with a modern twist. To quote the band "we take good songs and lead them to their true calling".

Basti, Digger and Sam have achieved enormous success across Europe with their rock 'n' roll versions of hits by Rihanna, Leona Lewis, Robbie Williams and Beyonce.

About the Album
The concept of this album is simple; covers of songs with a Rockabilly, Elvis-esque twist. There's no way that this should work as well as it does, and the reulting album is surprisingly fantastic!

The opening track, Rihanna's 'Umbrella', is so instantly recognisable I jumped out of my chair when I first heard it on the radio. Its a very good version of the song, and so infectious you just can't help singing along! This is definitely a stand out track, as are 'Hey There Delilah', 'Hot 'n' Cold' and 'I Don't Feel Like Dancing'. Some of the tracks don't work as well as others, perhaps because they aren't as well known / as recent as others, but the excellent ones more than make up for it.
