,ahmed103,2010-05-21T23:43Z,"thanks for the upload

kindly what other subtitles, and is Arabic included ?"
,tysfamily,2010-05-23T05:30Z,Is this for North America or everywhere else you know PAL format? Can this be burnt to a DVD and Played on my TV ?
,Interneter,2010-06-07T05:20Z,It's an .iso in PAL.
,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:53Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"

Thank You Very Much."
,Bakaat,2010-06-09T05:43Z,"Need to know if there are any NTSC versions that only show the subtitles of the planet's inhabitants. If I download a rip and add subtitles to the DVD, I will see all subtitles. Thanks."
,Felony69,2010-06-10T09:55Z,"Has anyone tried burning this to DVD? I did and when I tried to play the movie it came out distorted, unwatchable. I tried burning with Nero and DVD Shrink. Anyways, I had no issues playing it as an ISO file, looks great! Thanks for the upload, rtstorm."
,jakeou812,2010-06-12T03:35Z,"Will not play on a regular DVD player in North America. This is PAL, not NTSC."
,scandanathian,2010-06-13T08:36Z,"The video and audio on this are good. I used VLC to watch the iso without burning to disc, but I only had two subtitle choices: 
1) watch English subtitles for both the Navi and English spoken parts OR 
2) have no subtitles at all. 

I don't know if others have this problem, but it is not exactly what I am looking for.

I do want to thank rtstorm for the time and effort of the upload though."
