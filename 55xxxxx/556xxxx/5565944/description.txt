What is the DNA of a great rock 'n' roll band?

The series breaks this mythical beast down into its constituent parts - singer, guitarist, drummer as well as the shadowy 'other one', whose face we don't quite know but without whom the magic wouldn't happen. 

Does the drummer's clown-like personality and appetite for destruction mean he doesn't get taken seriously? Or is he the band member most in tune with the primal power of music to get us moving? Speaking up for the much maligned sticksman are Queen's Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, Stewart Copeland of The Police and Red Hot Chili Pepper, Chad Smith.
