"Dodgin' Bullets was a side project from some of the members of NIV and xDisciplex AD. They released 2 CDep's: "Soundtrack To The End Of The World" and "World Wide War". Both of those CDep's went out of print but were later repressed with 4 new songs on the full length titled "Earn Your Respect". Dodgin' Bullets was never a full time band, and that was never the goal or point of it. DB played shows in So Cal, Erie, PA and Cornerstone Festival in Illinois."
