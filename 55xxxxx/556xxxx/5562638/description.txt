NEW Star Trek The Next Generation 24p Smooth Motion Rips - No Blending!

FINALLY a High Quality, Motion Corrected 24p XVID encode, with the original ac3 audio track.

These come from the NTSC DVDs, and are of much better quality than any
 deinterlaced encode I have ever found, including the official PAL DVDs.

Stuttering, jerky effects and or live action are 99% eliminated. (A few remain,
 particularly during that pesky title sequence, but only a small number.)
