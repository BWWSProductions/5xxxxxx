        Dr Andrew Brown moves his 15-year-old son Ephram and         
        nine-year-old daughter Delia to rural Everwood after his     
        wife is killed in a car crash. But Dr Brown's hopes for a    
        new start are immediately hindered when Ephram rejects his   
        father's attempts to rebuild their relationship after years  
        of neglect.
