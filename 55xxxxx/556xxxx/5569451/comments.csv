,w4rmong,2010-05-19T05:35Z,Thanks for the up!!!
,tj11823,2010-05-19T07:10Z,Thanks for the up. Will this work straight up on the 360?
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-19T16:22Z,if you stream it it should.  Too big to fit on a fat32 drive unless you remove the AC3 track.

I examined the area in question and it didn't seem too bad."
,LMTPBay,2010-07-01T14:05Z,doesnt work on 360.
,LMTPBay,2010-07-01T15:47Z,"gonna guess the reason it doesnt work on 360 is because its larger than 4GB, Xbox cant play anything larger than that for some reason."
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-05T09:42Z,"stream it, it wont fit on your external usb drive."
,adpanzerlover,2010-09-21T16:38Z,"Thanx !! 4 uploading mate!!!

,osriccc,2011-01-09T17:50Z,"In other releases, try to make snapshots of the wide angled shots of the movie. We all know that almost any movie (even DVD) looks like ""HD"" when in close shots of the faces and stuff."
,jdboro,2011-01-17T21:24Z,Are the subs hardcoded?
,jdboro,2011-01-18T09:23Z,Not HD
,osriccc,2011-05-29T23:52Z,"Video is almost perfect, the best quality possible for that size (which is actually awesome). Audio I noticed, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is out of sync like half a second after some part of the movie. Is this a rip of the first version of blurays that came with that problem?"
,Sniper997,2011-06-01T06:18Z,"@osriccc, yes audio in bluray that came out had audio out of sync problem, its quite annoying when they shoot guns :/"
