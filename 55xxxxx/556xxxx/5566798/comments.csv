This is a good version.... no virus and to unzip you need to use WinZip."
,flexxotronZ,2010-05-24T05:05Z,BK nice torrent you're the man!
,uncholowapo,2010-05-25T02:17Z,Stop bitching and use 7-zip if you don't know how to extract it. Easy as that.

,dinoman123,2010-06-29T09:06Z,When I try to patch the keygen it says A error has occurred while attempting to patch the files? 
,luckyduc9,2010-07-07T18:38Z,"Firstly, after using 7zip to unpack, the instructions note is blank. And then, the program will not accept  the authorizing code. This is after a successful patch to program files/sony, and using the techniques recommended in other sony vegas torrents. "
,Mezereon,2010-07-19T13:52Z,Thank You Very Much :3

,craputchic,2010-12-05T00:00Z,"Uninstalled old version... and all tried versions, one after the other (64 bits). Cannot patch (error).

May be it's because I am unable to remove the x86 Sony shared pluggins ???? (W7 says it's used by another program ).

Can anybody help me ?"
,Xemnes,2010-12-08T22:02Z,"If you get the patch error try this
Before you open the keygen, right click and run as administrator.

It didn't work for me till I did that. I'm on vista"
,craputchic,2010-12-13T12:59Z,"Thanks to Kemnes;
but it doesn't work.
I am on an W7 64 bits system; whitch  had an old vegas 7 installed.
The removal of that version do not remove the shared files in the ""program x86"" folder, hand removal is  not possible as I get the response ""used by another program"". I don't know whitch one...
But may be it's not the main reason ????"
,original_maine,2010-12-17T00:50Z,"how do u patch this shit really b cause all that instruction shit is wroung as hell cuz i tried every possible way to patch so who ever that can tell me how please help 
cuz i read pple comments n they seem to have tha same problem"
,craputchic,2010-12-19T23:03Z,"Scuse-me, I wanted to thank Xemnes...

It works now: I succeeded by stopping the remaining automaticly starting services: ""MSSQL$SONY_MEDIAMGR"", and ""SQLAgent$SONY_MEDIAMGR"", using ""Autoruns"". Then I renamed the ""Sony Shared Plug-In"" sx86 folder. Then I could patch teh new installed Vegas. Then it works.
I THINK YOU NEED ABSOLUTELY NO SONY AGENT RUNNING AT INSTALLATION TIME.
I hope this can help someone..."
