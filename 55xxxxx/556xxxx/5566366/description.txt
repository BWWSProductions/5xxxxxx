Notes

Alright video wasnt the best, fixed it up a bit added LU audio
to it. not to shaby for cam audio. Fixed colors a bit, thought
there was to much Red, also fixed brightness/contrast a little
and added a slight sharpen filter, thought cam was to blury.
Also thought AR was slightly off so i fixed it to 2.35:1.
For a cam i would say video 5 audio 6 maybe 7, very good for
cam audio, defently not the worst ive gotten.

Looking for cam video/audio, direct line audio, pre released
r5s, ntsc and pal dvds, dvd/screeners, anything useful
