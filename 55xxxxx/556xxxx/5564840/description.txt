WHAT IT IS

With these files you should be able to listen to CD STEREO version of
Heroes 2 soundtrack on modern systems.

This torrent includes:

 * h2cdplay - a sound server that plays tracks

 * 192kbps mp3 version of CD audio soundtracks from HoMM2: The Succession Wars
 
 * patched exe file for Heroes of Might and Magic II GOLD

HOW TO USE THIS

1. Install Heroes of Might and Magic II GOLD.
  Other releases will probably work as well, but I didn't test it.

2. Check if CD music works for you. If it does - enjoy your game, you don't need this
  sound server. If it does not:

3. Overwrite your heroes2w.exe (usually located in
  C:Program Files3DOHeroes II Gold) with a patched one.
  Save a backup, if you want to.

4. Start h2cdplay.exe. Don't close it, it will play tracks for your game.

5. Start your Heroes of Might and Magic II.

6. Use in-game "Options" dialog to switch music type to "CD Stereo with
  Opera" (or "w/o Opera", if you don't like city themes).

7. Enjoy forever young classic game.

8. Close h2cdplay window after you're done.
