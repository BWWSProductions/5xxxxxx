,mafiadog,2010-05-18T12:58Z,Thanks man.
,raindr0ps,2010-05-19T04:28Z,"Thanks Playboyman. You know, I see a lot of torrents requesting a ""thank you"" for their torrents. I usually replay ""You ain't gonna get many. If you really want to see if people appreciate your torrents just see how many are downloading them."" I can see you currently have 148 peers. Far as I'm concerned that's a pretty big ""thank you"" and well deserved.

BTW, I wasn't inferring that you have ever requested thanks because you never have. But, you always have lots of peers. Nuff Said."
