 	 Politically incorrect and damn proud of it.
Brought back to life in 2005 assembling the scattered unburied remains of 6 Italian punks, 5 Star Grave equals a middle finger straight in the face of any kind of trend or musical compromise. After unleashing the first bunch of resurrected corpses in the 2006 release entitled The Zero Hour (still under the name Ground Zero) the first mass undertaking has been achieved in the year 2008 with the release of Corpse Breed Syndrome: an energetic mix of old school heavy/thrash metal with rock'n'roll/punk influences, catchy keyboards and corrosive vocals; without forgetting an overdose of horror-influenced slutty lyrics.
Shaking hands with the red light world and the most gruesome forms of human imagination the first step out of the grave of these 6 ghouls represents one of the most genuine and untamed visions of what modern heavy metal should be.
