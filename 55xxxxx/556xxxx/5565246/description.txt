Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)

Rogelio Paris's 1964 documentary We Are the Music provides a systematic overview of the "Golden Age" of indigenous Cuban music (roughly 1940-1960, or before and immediately after the Cuban Revolution). It features extensive footage of Cuban musicians performing in such locales as beaches, nightclubs, concert venues and streets.

I've included the "extra" included on this DVD, which is a FANTASTIC biographical documentary on Omara Portuondo, the only female singer from the famous Buena Vista Social Club.
