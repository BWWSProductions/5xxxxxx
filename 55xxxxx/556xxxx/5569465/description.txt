Yello - Touch, the virtual concert

Electronic Beats Classics is proud to present a visionary new music experiment by the highly influential Swiss duo Yello, with Touch Yello: a virtual concert. The cornerstone of the evening in Berlin will be the world premiere of this 50-minute movie that visualizes classics as "The Race", as well as songs from the groupâ€™s new album â€“ to be released October 2, 2009. Touch Yello evokes moods, pictures and movie scenes. For the creation of this virtual concert they're working with Kevin Blanc, a Swiss moving image designer and art director. The premiere of Touch Yello will be accompanied by live performances by the famous German jazz musician Till BrÃ¶nner and singer Heidi Happy.

This is the logical next chapter in Yelloâ€™s 30-year history, which has seen the electronic innovators pushing the limits of music video production since 1981, when they released "Pinball Cha Chaâ€, a suave figure-oriented video that was later included in the Museum of Modern Art's Music Video Exhibition.

However, the most mainstream aspect of Yelloâ€™s music and film career sprung from the success of the 1985 single â€œOh Yeahâ€, an addictive number which was prominently featured in John Hughesâ€™ classic Ferris Buellerâ€™s Day Off, among other films. After that, the group continuing composing for the silver screen: they scored the comedy Nuns on the Run and band member Dieter Meier directed the 1990 feature Snowball.

Yelloâ€™s extending dabblings in film made them natural candidates for Electronic Beats Classicâ€™s virtual concert dedication. This groundbreaking event will take place at 9:30 pm on October 1, 2009 in the charming and historic Kino International Berlin.

Yelloâ€™s next Album Touch Yello appears on October 2, 2009 on Universal Music.
