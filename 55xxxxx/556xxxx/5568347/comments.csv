I know you have been back for a few months now. Well I stopped looking at your name because I thought you were done. lol"
[V],greenbud1969,2010-05-17T07:55Z,BigBird75 == I couldn't afford the internet anymore and all my neighbors have passwords on wireless routers so I was pretty much screwed for awhile. If I disappear again for awhile it will be for the same reason. Internet is just so damn expensive. I wont delete all rips like MovieExtreme did. My rips are here to stay. Take it easy. peace out  greenbud !!
[V],greenbud1969,2010-06-03T06:22Z,Links to screenshots no longer work. A mistake was made on my part. Sorry. peace out greenbud !!
