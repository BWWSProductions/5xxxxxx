Music : Indie : Lossless

Band of Horses - Infinite Arms (2010)


**FLAC**


Correct CD-Rip MP3 versions of this album are already available, which have a better quality as my original uploaded leaked album. For the ones who prefer lossless, here's the FLAC version.



Band of Horses, previously known as Horses, is an American indie rock band formed in 2004 in Seattle by Ben Bridwell and Mat Brooke. Their first two albums were released on the Sub Pop record label, while their third album will be on Columbia Records.

Vocalist Bridwell has been likened to Jim James of My Morning Jacket, early Neil Young, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.




Infinite Arms is the upcoming third album of indie rock band Band of Horses, set to be released on May 18, 2010 on Brown Records, Fat Possum Records and Columbia.

The first single off this album is "Compliments" and the official music video was presented on the band's official page on April 2010.
