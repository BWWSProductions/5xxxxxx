The Antichrist, Is He the Pope or the Papacy? - A Collection:

It has been an obsession of the Christian world to try to identify and name the Antichrist who is supposed to fulfill Biblical prophecies concerning an adversary of Jesus while resembling him in a deceptive manner. Throughout the ages, many candidates were suggested for this infamous person. Interestingly, the Pope and the Papacy were favorite nominees with the latter getting most of the votes.

The Pope and Papacy may not be the Antichrist of the End Time. But their apostasy and that they practice and promote a version of Christianity that contradicts the teachings of Jesus would certainly qualify them to be antichrists.
