Itâ€™s Friday, ya bastids!

Randiâ€™s out today but will be back on Monday.

Our friend Nicole Sandler will be filling in today with comedian John Fugelsang â€“ just back from Haiti, and two Democratic primary contenders: Marcy Winograd, whoâ€™s challenging Blue Dog incumbent Jane Harman, and Congressman Joe Sestak, whoâ€™s running against Republican turned Democrat incumbent Senator Arlen Specter.

Enjoy!
