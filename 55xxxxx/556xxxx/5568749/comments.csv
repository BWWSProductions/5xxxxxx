,MitchC9,2010-05-17T07:01Z,I'm having some trouble connecting with peers here. I can't seem to stay connected for either upload or download; they are both still at 0 bytes despite re downloading the torrent and restarting it twice. My other torrents work fine. Anyone else experiencing this?
,MitchC9,2010-05-17T07:01Z,test?
,MitchC9,2010-05-17T07:06Z,Can't quite figure this one out. If you're having the same problem download the standard definition by TvTeam
,Lixifer,2010-05-17T07:29Z,Yes.  I (and it looks like - everyone else) have been on 0 % since 1 min after original upload.  Must be on TvTeam's end this problem I guess.
,Lixifer,2010-05-17T07:51Z,It works now!
,euphoria4949,2010-05-17T08:17Z,"OMG i love this show!!

Torrents only 15minutes old and the average completion is like 3% but its DLing at 1.2MB a second!! Super fast or wot!

Thanks soooo much for all your work TvTeam on all your torrents :-) Long live TvTeam and long live TPB.

Thank you good nite and much love! "
