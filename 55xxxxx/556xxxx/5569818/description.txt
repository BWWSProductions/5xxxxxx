Alex talks with Margaret Roberts [2nd half of hour 3], a journalist who wrote the preface to David Hammerâ€™s 2004 book Deadly Secrets: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing. On May 18, Roberts contacted Alex Jones and said death row inmate Hammer was locked down after his interview that aired on the Alex Jones Show.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
