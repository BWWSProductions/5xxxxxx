,kirk87,2010-05-19T19:02Z,how do i burn this game?
,LeSet,2010-05-21T06:59Z,"Ubisoft made a big FAIL with this game, dont you test your software before shipping you jakass!, near the end, you will encounter a totally brainded enigma, two doors are locked, and you cant go anywhere.

Its the official UBI sandbox bug, you have to delete your autosave every time you die.

Totally waste of money and time dont forget that.

game is so so, but with this huge bug, ubi only get one sword!

Crap of the year!"
