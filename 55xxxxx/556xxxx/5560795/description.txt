In late 2008, my family and I were given an opportunity to spend three months in China. Renmin Park is a reflection of my family's adventure in China. It's a fictional love story about two people whose two worlds will forever keep them apart.

It's a thank-you letter to an obscure city and the people who opened up their lives to five very strange strangers. It's a document about a bewilderingly complex culture that is, once again, experiencing a massive upheaval. It's another chapter in a band's ongoing twenty-five year journey.
