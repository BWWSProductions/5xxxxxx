,LTGENRED,2010-05-16T13:46Z,these people should stop putting IMAGINE on their crap work your not fooling anyone
,keith23uk,2010-05-16T14:40Z,Watched this last night quality isnt as bad as people are making out. I give audio 5 video 6. In my opinion a movie not reallly worth waiting for an R5 or dvd rip.
,xamoj,2010-05-16T15:20Z,"Why are all the ""cam"" almost as bad? Are they not filmed with cameras of different qualities?
The sharpness and the sound looks almost identical."
,Babik0s,2010-05-16T20:02Z,thanks

It's because all the Robin Hood 2010 releases out so far all use the same source for video, and most use the same audio source too, they just tweak everything to get it as good as it can possibly be. They all look similar because the source is too shitty to really make something out of (can't polish a turd).
TL:DR - ONE cam source, 100 ""different"" releases."
