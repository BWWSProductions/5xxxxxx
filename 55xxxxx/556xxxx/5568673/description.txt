Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow (2006) by Bathesda Softworks

The iso I downloaded didn't install on Windows7 or Vista, so I had to install it on an old XP machine and copy the program files over.  It works like a charm.

I figured I'd save anyone else who wants to play this game on Vista or Windows7 some trouble and create this torrent.

These are the instructions in the Read Me:
1. Use 7zip to Extract
2. Place "Bathesta Softworks" folder in you "Program Files (x86)" folder (or just program files for XP users)
3. Run "PiratesLoJS.exe"

That's it!
