Based on the novel by best-selling author Barry Eisler, RAIN FALL follows John Rain, a former U.S. Special Forces operative turned lethal assassin whose clients pay extraordinary sums for his ability to make murder look like natural death.

In the aftermath of an otherwise routine hit on a government bureaucrat, Rain is brought to the attention of two men he knows from the old days in Vietnam. When the CIA lists a woman that Rain has come to love as a target, his worlds collide.
