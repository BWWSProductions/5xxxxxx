,brawltillyallbawl,2010-12-05T15:51Z,"Why is one of the tags ""season 4""? I'm pretty sure I've been trying to download season 1"
,pokehim69,2011-01-04T05:42Z,"What a helpful bunch of comments - I thought the comment section was meant to give an indication as to the quality of the torrent, NOT for fools to beg for more seeds.  Seriously, do you really think that writing ""PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE SEEEEEEEEEEEEED is going to speed up your download?   For those that are interested: A=9 V8 IMO"
,Lewy_H,2011-01-08T15:06Z,"Great torrent, sometimes the video weirded out a bit on the pilot episode and i've only watched first three episodes up to now but it looks high quality."
,Helenxangel,2011-01-30T07:12Z,"Great quality, although in the first video, it was a bit fuzzy in a small part the rest were fine. Thank you heaps!"
