"xDisciplex A.D. was a straight edge Christian hardcore band from Erie, PA. Formerly xdisciplex or disciple, the band had to change its name to avoid legal actions due to a prior established band named Disciple.[1] They released albums with Goodfellow Records, Triple Crown Records and Facedown Records. After they disbanded, Dan Quiggle, Dave Quiggle, and Adam Salaga started another band called Jesus Wept,[2] while Neil Hartman joined No Innocent Victim.[3] Dave Quiggle moved to California during the summer of 2005 and also joined No Innocent Victim and works for Facedown Records doing design[1]. Members of xDisciplex A.D. also played in the bands Anchor, Dodgin' Bullets and Shockwave."
