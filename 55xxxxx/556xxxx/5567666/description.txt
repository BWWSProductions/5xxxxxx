M*A*S*H is an American television series developed by Larry Gelbart, adapted from the 1970 feature film 

MASH (which was itself based on the 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors, by Richard Hooker). 

	The series is a medical drama/black comedy that was produced in association with 20th Century Fox 

Television for CBS. It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army 

Surgical Hospital in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.
The series premiered on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale becoming the 

most-watched television episode in U.S. television history with 105.97 million viewers. 

Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on real-life tales told by real MASH surgeons who were 

interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam 

War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.[3] It took a number of minor 

creative liberties with the actual facts of the Korean War.


M*A*S*H - S01E04  - Chief Surgeon Who?

       Frank Burns complains about Hawkeye Pierce's disrespect...and Henry appoints Hawkeye chief surgeon, 

to Burns's shock. The rest of the 4077th "coronates" Hawk while Frank and Hot Lips complain to General 

Barker. The General's visit provides him with a view of life at the 4077th M*A*S*H unit: camp hijinks, a 

poker game, and a surgery session. This shows him M*A*S*H has fun but gets the job done.
