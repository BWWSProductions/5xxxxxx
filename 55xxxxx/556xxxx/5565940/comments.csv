,PL44,2010-05-16T19:09Z,I greatly appreciate the up. Been trying to make a decent conversion from my VHS but had some issues and the outcome was frankly shite...
,PL44,2010-05-16T20:14Z,...mh...download doesn't seem to start. I remember having the same issues with the avi version you upped earlier...nobody in the cue has downloaded anything from you as far as I can see. Any chance you can change that?
,PL44,2010-05-18T20:27Z,"Slowly, but it works now. Thanks. I'll help as soon as I got it."
,keith1955,2010-05-23T18:13Z,"I'm doing my best to be on line as much as I can to share this, but its not always possible due to ISP speed issues just lately."
,PL44,2010-05-25T22:40Z,"I'll stay on it. If you feel at some point that you want to quit, let me know ;-). Thx for giving me a quick info on why things are going so slowly at the moment."
,keith1955,2010-05-26T11:58Z,"Thanks  PL44.   If you have this now and are happy that its okay, then I will leave it on for another week at least to make sure that there are enough people out there who can share it on on to others.  I certainly will leave it untill you have it in its entirity and have tested it....."
,keith1955,2010-05-26T12:26Z,"EVERYONE........

PLEASE   SEED THIS FILE................ ;-)

Others want it, and I need my disk space.

I did the hard work, converting it from Video Tape to DVD.  If your happy with the quality, then please share it with others and take the load off of me.

Thank You."
,PL44,2010-05-27T15:47Z,"...but where are you? Been online for days without any new parts downloaded. I will definetely seed it, but first  I have to get it ..."
,keith1955,2010-06-06T21:47Z,"I do my best. I only have a laptop to do this with, and I have other things I need to do as well. And the wife complains about slow internet when I am on here.
Please let me know when a couple of people have it, then I will take a break.
Thanks all."
