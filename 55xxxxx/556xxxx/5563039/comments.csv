,MrMemphis,2010-05-16T03:20Z,"This show lacks the typical Stargate quality of small amounts of comedy and truly loveable characters...
Get Ronan Dex aboard :) aaaand some more fights would be nice... we've yet to encounter a true enemy... It's just a rip off of Galactica... The timed hyperspace jumps, the old battered ship, the religion aspects, everything... All we need now is an... oh wait aliens following them has cropped up... 
Make more use of the Stargate, more comedy, and some fucking fights please...
and before you all start bitching I know asking here wont make much, if any difference, but hey maybe the writers realise their true fans lie with us the pirates... oh and fellow IMDBers ;D"
,MrMemphis,2010-05-16T03:22Z,"and thanks EZTV, love all your uploads... No need to comment on quality, haven't finished downloading yet, but I can almost guarantee it'll be damn near perfect. "
