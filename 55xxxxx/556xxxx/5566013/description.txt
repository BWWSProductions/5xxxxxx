IMDB: The film begins in The Hive, a top-secret genetic research facility owned by the Umbrella Corporation located deep beneath Raccoon City. A technician loads vials of blue and green liquid into a secured case, then tosses one blue vial onto the floor inside a lab, exits and seals the room. The vial breaks and the facility's security system, the Red Queen, detects possible infection, and in response, seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.
