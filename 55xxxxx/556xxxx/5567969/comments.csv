,drunkchef,2010-05-19T09:25Z,this film is rubbish ! dont waste your time or bandwith ! ive had more entertaining poo's !
,pen8tr8tor,2010-05-20T11:49Z,i dont know what the f*ck some people are saying but this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen. cool cinematography and all but no plot what so ever
,_MAXIMUS_,2010-05-20T12:39Z,"I agree with Pen8tr8tor and Drunkchef........

Great upload Picture - great, sound - great but........

What a load of pretentious crap........watch the film and waited an hour and a half for something to happen then it ended.

,Zacodrome,2010-05-20T20:56Z,I found this film kinda slow and boring :/ but thanks for putting up great torrentz! :D
[V],GoodFilms,2010-05-21T12:45Z,I find it's usually best to check IMDB rating and comments before watching something. Saves you from disappointment much of the time.
,kinvore,2010-06-05T07:37Z,"It's an art film, folks.  I didn't understand a lot of it myself but I was still kinda glad I watched it.

Definitely not for the average viewer."
,totenkopf1891,2010-06-18T19:34Z,This movie is a frigging joke. At some scenes I nearly fell asleep. A/V is 10 if you really have to watch this... Not recomended. 
,zappacrew,2010-06-21T04:29Z,"I am getting brutal video artifacts on the latest version of K-lite, and VLC was actually bombing out at times...poof.

The video artifacts are nonstop at times, with lots of times the movie sticks.

Still watchable if you're really persistent in wanting to see it, i.e. babysit the playback, but it does get over the top at times.

Thanks just the same."
,zappacrew,2010-06-21T05:03Z,"n/m I figured it out...stupid x264 setting in klite.

Did a reinstall of klite....movie plays clean now.

whack..."
,zappacrew,2010-06-21T05:27Z,"Spoke too soon, I even downloaded a dedicated x264 player...

This movie absolutely hates my computer....

Insane artifacts in the third part...I can't count to 5 without the entire screen going insane.

Oh well."
,n8schicht,2010-06-27T15:33Z,"This movie may be considered as some kind of art. The scenes and landscapes are really beautiful, but the story is almost non existant. Nothing important is happening during these 2 hours.

V: 10
A: 10  (DTS, yeah)  :)
M: 2  at best"
,UrHighness,2010-09-03T21:07Z,"I usually like original and creative movies, which doesn't follow the hollywood recipe for predictable and unintelligent films. But about this film I have to say:

It is the most pretentious, wannabe-artistic and confusing piece of shit movie I have ever seen. It has 0 artistic value, 0 entertainment value, and 1 craftmanship value (the 1 come from some nice nature shots, but even those are not anything special). 

If you want to waste a few hours of your life endulging yourself in the worst homanity has to offer in the art of filmmaking: then please watch this lump of shit.

I am sorry but if you appreciate this film (and don't just say you do because you want people to think you have fine taste, which you don't) you simply have a minor glitch in your brain. Please seek professional help."
,FluffigtDjur,2010-11-14T20:04Z,"Promising start, nice photography and a mood that fans of the genre will enjoy... but by act V the plot completely deteriorates into utter bullshit. What the hell where they thinking?   "
,FluffigtDjur,2010-11-14T20:08Z,Suggestion: Watch the first 2 or so acts if you really loved Hrafninn flĂ˝gur... then go dl Herzog's Aguirre: der Zorn Gottes to see the bullshit acts V--> done right. 
,juiuce,2010-11-25T04:17Z,"Don't let the Hollywood style trailers trick you, this is more Art House than Hollywood, if you like the director than you'll love the film. Watch Bronson to see if you like the taste."
,PoopChef,2012-02-28T19:20Z,UrHighness: Something tells me you're the one with a mental problem. If you had to work that hard to describe the movie as pretentious you're probably doing so to make yourself feel better for not liking the movie due to your own mental shortcomings.
,chrispyfries,2012-04-28T01:30Z,"great movie, though some colour banding detracts from the quality of the encoding. dunno if thats just me
otherwise, it looks great, sounds great, and plays perfectly"
