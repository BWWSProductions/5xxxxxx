,Sillerulz,2011-01-28T11:44Z,Hi everyone. I found a simple solution. You don't need any cracks for University. Just install Night Life and it will use that .exe.

,lizXoX2008,2011-08-16T17:16Z,"READ:
Okay. Download Sims Double Deluxe then just install this and you don't need to mount or replace crack. Just open Double Deluxe when you've finished installing the university and it should give you an option to add it.

Sigh."

,niem_arrelio,2011-09-10T02:48Z,"I was able to get this to work, and I am in the mood to help out.

1. Make sure you have the 4th ISO of the original Sims 2. 
2. Mount both ISOs in this torrent, and click Autorun in the 1st ISO to install. Use the serial provided in  the instructions.
3. When it prompts for CD 4 during the update, mount the 4th ISO I said before, and click OK. It should start updating by that time.
4. After the installation, do not launch University yet. Create another virtual drive, and mount the .MIR crack. If nothing comes up in the Crack folder, select the ""All Files (*.*)"" option in the drop-down menu. You should see the file by now.
5. Finally, visit C:/Program Files/EA GAMES/The Sims 2 University/TSBin, and click on Sims2EP1. Create a shortcut for it on the Desktop if you want to.

That should clarify everything. If you have followed it correctly, the game should start playing by now.

Don't ask me if you don't know how to mount."
,BrendaSong2NE1,2011-09-24T13:04Z,"If I don't leave a comment after downloading this, it would be a sin BECAUSE IT WORKS SO WELLLLL!!!! THANNKS YOU!!!!!!!!!"

,pankagumilang,2012-07-10T13:40Z,"I ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF PROBLEM DOWNLOADING FROM YOUR TORRENT !! SINCE HOLIDAY STUFF, GLAMOUR STUFF, AND THE SIMS 2 UNIVERSITY. STUPID SLASH !!!"
,pankagumilang,2012-07-11T05:15Z,"for you guys, who can't get the crack try downloading from this :

http://205.196.122.166/56u9v456a46g/3hn9qeqr99jea23/Sims2EP1.exe

if there's something wrong maybe you should reinstall all the expansion pack and start downloading from The Sims 2 University, Nightlife, Open For Business, etc. 

hope it help you, guys. "
