This review is from: Dingly Dell (Audio CD) 
I understand that the talented geezers that are and were Lindisfarne were, for various reasons, unhappy about this album. As a teenager I had this on vinyl and only last weekend bought it on CD. I was staggered by the strong tunes and power of the first few tracks and loved this trip down memory lane. Time has treated this collection of songs very well and the last track on the album (and penultimate on this) completes the release with a song full of excellence, atmosphere and unease
