This is Michael Collins Piper's shocking book The High Priests of War - The Secret History of How America's Neo-Conservative Trotskyites Came to Power and Orchestrated the War Against Iraq as the First Step in Their Drive for Global Empire (2004) which is probably the only book that unmasks a secret cabal of Jews whose billionaire backers have propelled them to power and behind-the-scenes control of the White House, the CIA, and the Pentagon. Theyâ€™re called "neoconservatives" but in reality, they are hardcore communists and trotskyites. Four decades ago they assassinated President John F. Kennedy, proving they are capable of anything, even mass murder and genocide, to get their way by using America as their proxy to establish a global empire of the Illuminati. Beginning with a brief overview of the Cold War fraud which was played out in great detail and with great drama on the world stage, Piper shows us how a small but tightly-linked cabal of "neo-conservatives" rose from Trotskyâ€™s shadow to become adherents of US Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, then moved into the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations, where they were largely viewed as "crazies" that had to be contained. Along the way, we also discover how these twisted intellectuals are intricately tied to an underlying Zionist cause, and how they're able to promote their aims via a well-established network of media outlets, think tanks, and politicians who had sold their souls long ago. High Priests of War blows the lid off the real origins of Americaâ€™s disaster in Iraq, exposing who really started the Iraq war - and why. 145 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.
