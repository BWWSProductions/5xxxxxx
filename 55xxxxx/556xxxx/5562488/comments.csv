,Eajas,2010-05-15T22:12Z,where to get subtitles for this movie
,aldrinstryder,2010-05-16T00:12Z,how's the movie? was it good or bad?
,dsafjaly69,2010-05-16T03:32Z,"Thanks for the up,  A/V 7/7

Well the actor is indescript as to heritage. This is nothing like the old ""GOOD"" Sinbad movies from Ray Harryhausen / Charles Schneer, where Sinbad was clearly arabian, or at least intended to be.

This is actually more along the lines of the very bad TV series. It borrows from every other adventure movie indescriminantly and executes it all poorly. The TV series actually has moments of special effects that where better than ones seen in this flick. It's essentially the junk food of movies and a little sub-par of what the SyFy channel seems to be churning out these days, so brace yourself.

I did manage to watch the entire thing, but maybe that says more about me than the movie."
,dsafjaly69,2010-05-16T03:39Z,"Just to clarify,  I don't think SyFy channel had anything to do with this movies, just that this movie is actually worse than the majority of the garbage the SyFy channel is making these days.  The release company involved is ""the asylum"" thier IMDB link pretty much spells out what to expect.

,zappacrew,2010-05-16T08:40Z,"This movie was so absolutely bad it basically can be classified as a total disaster.

It's so bad on so many levels...all of them actually.

Plot, CGI, intelligence, acting....

omg...what a mess of a movie.

,someonegotmyusername,2010-05-16T15:01Z,A/V both good. movie is attrocious
,mtadesse,2010-05-16T15:07Z,"Yo ""dsafjaly69"" according to your link these guys a kicking out 5 to 6 shitty movies a year. Some years its like 10 movies. That why the dont have time making good ones...their to busy making shitty ones  "
,Zlaktaren,2010-05-16T17:11Z,"This ""movie"" is the crap that crap craps! If you like this shit, you have to be a retarded workingclass hero!"
,biquinetto,2010-05-16T17:15Z,"Horrible movie. please stop downloading this, it has nothing to do in tpb's top100. Between the fakes, the crappy movies, and the spanish versions we don't get many good top100 links nowadays."
,superbanned,2010-05-16T17:19Z,"Another fucking assylum ripoff. This time, trying to cash over Prince of Persia"

,arildus,2010-05-17T08:33Z,Thanx;)
,sentient1,2010-05-18T17:08Z,OMG ASYLUM>>> JUST STOP
,jambuban,2010-05-19T03:06Z,"thnx for the trashing comments people, was downloading it, but will not as this movie seems to be really crap."
,tenka73,2010-05-19T06:39Z,"WOW!!! The Asylum company put out Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls. Just knowing that I refuse to dl this movie. Sorry raymond, I just know how bad a movie this company produces. They spend more on their box art than on the actual films they produce."
,tenka73,2010-05-19T06:46Z,I'm ashamed I saw Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls. X(
,J33SEJ,2010-05-19T12:50Z,"After reading all the comment's i have to ask the question!!?... Was this movie not meant to be like Spaceballs was for Star Wars??? lmao
Well i downloaded it a day or two ago but dont think i will bother watching it now lol."
,tenka73,2010-05-20T07:21Z,Spaceballs had comedic genius and a budget higher than the total value of loose change found in a couch. Asylum Inc. has neither!
,fith78,2010-05-20T15:36Z,another CRAB mockbuster
,keithtselle,2010-05-20T18:28Z,One of the worst piece of shit of all time. Don't even waste your time on it.
