Anchored by the dual talents of vocalist Steve Winwood and drummer Jim Capaldi, the late-'60s/early-'70s psychedelic band Traffic melded folk, rock, jazz, and soul into a brilliant amalgam that made them one of the most adventurous bands in popular music. Though Traffic disbanded in 1974, Winwood and Capaldi reunited 20 years later for the 1994 album FAR FROM HOME and a corresponding U.S. tour that took them from New York to Los Angeles and many points in between--including a stop at the historic Woodstock '94. THE LAST GREAT TRAFFIC JAM assembles that reunion tour's never-before-seen footage into a remarkable concert film that combines candid backstage interviews with rare live performances of hits like "Low Spark," "Glad," "John Barleycorn," and a once-in-a-lifetime rendition of "Dear Mr. Fantasy" featuring guest guitarist Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.
