This comedy episode can actually be considered a
season finale because of the extended opening theme.

Although it's really the pilot to the LAREDO
series, which premiered the following fall that 
lasted 2 years.

The entire LAREDO cast is here, including Neville
Brand, William Smith, Peter Brown, and Philip Carey
(as their boss Captain Parmalee).

Also in the guest cast are veteran actors Fernando Lamas 
as a general, Ida Lupino (in her worst performance ever 
as a Mexican woman), and sexy 40+ redhead Rhonda Fleming.

Seen briefly are Bing Russell of BONANZA (he's Kurt's dad)
and pretty Holly McIntire (daughter of future Virginian
cast members John McIntire and Jeanette Nolan).

Series regular Roberta Shore appears as Betsy Garth for
the last time. She retired from show business for the most
part in 1965 to raise her family. Over 40 years later she 
still shows up at western conventions with former co-stars
James Drury, Gary Clarke, Clu Gulager, and Randy Boone.
