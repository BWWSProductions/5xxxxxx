Don't forget to seed.

Note: I am unsure why, but the links and such to Lionhead Forums in the Readme no longer work. In fact, if one Googles or clicks on any link to the Lionhead Forums, they are redirected to the homepage. This makes me sad.

AAR, aka TheKingOfTheGuild used to have an account on Lionhead forums with which he trolled around. Eventually, a guy named Arzock got him banned, but AAR returned under the name "Imightis."

You can also in this folder, other than the video, find two web archives of my PMs with Arzock and Swordbane85, and in the DestroyKookyinc folder, you can find an archive of a site the AARmy made to hate on me.
