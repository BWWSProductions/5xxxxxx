,FileError420,2010-05-15T12:00Z,"Thanks so much for these small size downloads!!
Yes, Movies and visual TV shows should have high resolution, but for talk shows, daily shows, etc., I really love having the quick, small size torrents.
Please keep em coming :)

THANKS AGAIN!!"
,Pothead808,2010-05-15T13:02Z,"Love your ups of talk shows, such great quality for the size, thanks again 20."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-15T13:27Z,"I must to quote myself, because what you're saying was exactly my ""spiritus movens"" for starting ""Talk.Shows"" daily-packs. Fact is: they do NOT NEED better quality, their shelf-life is ONE DAY and one who thinks otherwise probably should NOT watch these shows anyway - let put it nicely - he isn't ""target audience"".

Let see what I have said on May 6th 2010:

NOTE: Last ""Talk.Show.Pack"". And yes - there is a great interest, savings on monthly basis could be immense.
There is one guy who releases some talk shows in very small sizes, little bigger than mine and definitely worse looking.
Such encodings can be played only on computers. [quark]s are more - versatile.

From time to time I have looked what going on with his torrents (he's not on TPB), puzzled by ""Pack"" unpopularity.
His torrent has 94 seeders after two hours and after 9 hours - 624 seeds.
I get two (2), three (3), four and up to 9. I am lucky when that happens.

So, you have saved even more. By cutting my ""Pack"" out.""
*************************************

It stands to every single word in it... Those ""immense"" savings I mentioned have been anticipated in 14 GB range JUST for the talk shows.But - my try has one built-in flaw: - smart people as audience. And by that I mean not 26 people who have signed their comments here last week, but more than 80 THOUSAND who just filled their bellies - and vanished. Not you guys, got that?"
,DMVIN,2010-05-15T16:05Z,"Thanks 20-40

I try to seed as much as long as I get users downloading. As u rightly say, their life is one day and so I stop seeding and delete after a few days and no leehers"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-15T17:19Z,"DMVIN: Yeah, but Packs stayed on few seeders (probably you, Jon and few and me, plus one to three guys who seeded occasionally) within 6-9 hours. That's what I'm telling. There is few Packs or RTWBMs which have been downloaded by hundredths and number of seeders were pretty much the same.
As I explained earlier, torrents cannot ""function"" that way. It leads to serious depletion of seeders in numbers and their quality (speed) 'cause their bandwidth has been ""eaten"". Sooner or later seeders see what's going on (they have insanely high ratio) and morons just take and leech and - vanish, without giving back even 0.1.
I do not want to support leeching (true, blatant one) and Hit&Runs. Therefore I often begged seeders to sync with active torrents (if I delete one, they should stop seeding that too) and not to seed longer than 48h unless it's their favored show or movie. I know from the experience (not just mine) that after 12-18 hours any torrent ""goes"" Hit&Run only, rarely people who are ""late bloomers"" stay to seed, even for a minute. 
And I keep repeating, it was never about you, few people who have logged-in and left comments. It never was - but it seems to be something that lot of regulars here do not understand. You are - just 0.001% of the people who have downloaded my torrents. It's about ""others"", not about any of you.
Somehow, I still ""fertilize"" my opinion that no one of the ""regulars"" is so double-faced, to speak one thing and actually do opposite, undermining not just my work, but generosity of others."
,tincase,2010-05-15T21:17Z,I still have space left till my cable bill cuts off in 48 hours so I'm leaving it wide open
,FileError420,2010-05-16T10:51Z,"I think it's just too ""NEW"" for many people. They have to catch on and that might take longer than anticipated. Once all the guys who download Daily show, Colbert, etc. every day at 175MB a pop figure out that they can do it quicker and with less space, it'll take off. Think of it like one of the smart sitcoms that took a few seasons to built an audience. :) Please don't cancel us... "
,DMVIN,2010-05-16T12:48Z,"I understand how you feel 20-40 and I know you didn't cancel the talk shows but for the lazy leechers. I guess a few have to suffer. I get my talk shows now from eztv, not as nicely bundled and small as yours though :-("
,parvulus,2010-05-17T05:02Z,"Thanks a lot, I really love these small size videos that have good quality.  I have a bad upload speed and when I download bigger torrents it takes me forever to seed even just back to 1.  With these I am always seeded at least back to 1 within a week, and of course I try to seed more, but usually I stop around 1 because then I start another one.  It is hard always trying to play catch-up with seeding, and restraining downloading habits because you still have to upload more to even break even transfer-wise; these torrents are really a great help."
