Combining their unique blend of talent and years of experience
with some of rock's most well-known bands,
the Eric Singer Project, better known as ESP is
giving fans around the world a chance to experience
their incredible live show. The very busy band members,
comprised of Eric Singer (KISS Alice Cooper),
Bruce Kulick (Grand Funk Railroad Union KISS),
John Corabi (Ratt Union Motley Crue), and Chuck Garric (Alice Cooper),
found the time in early 2006 to travel to Japan and Australia,
playing for sold-out audiences and delighting fans with their
energetic and exciting concerts.
The arrival of the new DVD is welcome news to ESP fans,
who have been wanting more from the group since the
release of their 1998 debut, Lost And Spaced.
