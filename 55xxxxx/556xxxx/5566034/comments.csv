Can I just pop it onto ISO and it will run or Do I need to use KHBBS patch which I have already and/or UMDGEN, replacing the .EBOOT and the other folder in USERDIR or whatever with ""patched"" files from another site? I did that to this ISO and it just said error and F'd up when I tried to save the Iso after replacing the files.

This is the tutorial I followed

Any help would be appreciated. Thx"
,FernFrond,2010-07-02T10:23Z,Ok it works fine without any of that crap they told me to do. Ty for a good upload and +1 for you.

God Eater is an Epic game like Monster hunter but less impossible. It still has time limits on Missions which is good since there isn't much reason to be frolicking around in the first place. God Eater has area based maps like in Monster Hunter, With attribute based Bosses most likely for the different areas. There is a somewhat upgraded form of the Gunlance where you can switch between sword and gun form at the touch of a button, but unlike Monster Hunter you have infinite ammo since ammo is just your green bar. The bar goes up every time you attack with the sword form. You can change the ammo type to hit certain armored enemies for full effectiveness. 

Ex: Drill ammo, Spear ammo?, explosive ammo etc. 

 The system of switching out is much like how you switch ammo types in Monster hunter. The freedom of item usage whilst moving is as effective in this game as it is in other games in this genre. What makes this system more smooth is the fact that you can add other party members to distract enemies while you heal etc.

If you are downed in combat the nearest party member will revive you with a fraction of your hp but you retain your green bar. Instead of Wyvern flame From MH as a special, You have a special move with your gun. 

Holding triangle is the most legit thing ever. It reminds me of Hellsing with the dogs and such. Just see it for yourself. It's Probably where the game got its name. The game is definitely similar to Monster Hunter and also shares a likeness to Dissidia since you can jump and freeze in the air for a few attacks. It's more like Phantasy star Mission wise, where you can choose which missions to go on without getting loot from every enemy like in Bounty hounds. 
This just means that the weapons you have don't need to constantly get replaced. 

Your money supply is most likely gained from mission to mission along with selling items. Then it seems that you can buy new weapons and armor. No English is required for the basics of the game. I've only played the game for like 45 minutes and I'm just letting you know that it's worth the trouble of getting ( Being a Japanese game and requiring Updated CFW)


It's non turn based( Obviously) and has great graphics. Definitely worth the download. Just have GEN D2/3 running( Im using D3) and the KHBBS patch enabled and you're good to go. No UMDGEN futzing. Seed and give a plus if you get it working. 

Gen D3 is so easy to get on your psp. All you need to do is look it up on Google, put it on your psp, run it under game and bam. You have it. You don't need to run recovery flasher for it.

If you like this game or like playing missions with a friend and don't find it frustrating since it's in Japanese, I would recommend Phantasy star portable 2. You can get up to like level 200. Other good ad-hoc games are Fat princess for psp, Army of 2, Renegade squadron ( I don't like Elite squadron much since it only allows for pitiful ad-hoc matches),
Tekken or Soul Calibur for psp, ( If you're into fighting games), and possibly Worms open warfare 2, or Full Metal Alchemist. FMA seems too slow to be fun, but I only played it for like an hour so who knows. "
,FernFrond,2010-07-12T22:20Z,"Ok. Right now my brother and I have decided not to play for a while since we ran out of time trying to kill the Cover art boss after the mission with the dual-Harpies. IT just WOULD NOT DIE so we thought we had to kill the mummy enemies when we only had 4 mins left. There was only two. We killed the mummies but only the boss was left which we had fought for 26 minutes full on. I shot at it often with Fire Corkscrew ammo whenever my green gauge was full from using a light sword with presumably 65 attack and 30 in someother stat. ( The sword that looks like a purple fish spine) My brother was using a great sword and out team members revived us often. Is it even possible to kill it or are we just not damaging it for some reason. I know that some parts of the boss deflect your hits, but that only happened rarely."
,FernFrond,2010-07-14T17:07Z,I beat that fag in around 23 minutes but now I am on chapter 4 and I have killed around 8 of them and 3 upgraded versions of them. I threw stuff across the room when I had to fight A baboon god and this boss in the same arena with like 5 regular enemies also. What was almost worse was two of the baboon gods in that arena. I am only missing one damn item to make the cover art boss great sword but it doesn\'t seem worth it anymore since my red fishlike longsword already tops its\' attack with 150.
