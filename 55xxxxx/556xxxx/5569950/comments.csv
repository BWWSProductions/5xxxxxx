,homericICON,2010-06-08T16:42Z,Beautiful quality rip. Pity though it's for a 4:3 Full Screen version. Such a waste of time if you've got an HDTV w/16:9 aspect ratio.
,DathVada,2011-11-05T05:14Z,"Hey - can anyone please seed this? My download rate is fast, so it wouldn't take long.  Thanks"
,DathVada,2011-11-29T12:57Z,"Folks I've been waiting patiently.  I just need one or two people to seed me the rest of the movie - it's 60% complete.  I'm sure that at least one person still has it on their hard drive, so please seed this."
