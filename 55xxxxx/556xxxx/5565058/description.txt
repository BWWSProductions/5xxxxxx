Bodycall is dark electro, aggrotech and electro-industrial band. The style can also be reffered to as cyber goth or hellectro. This is the most up to date collection of all the music Bodycall has released so far. It contains the latest Bodycall's release, "Reiteration" (2010). This collection also includes Etylen, Bodycall's side-project.

Bodycall creates dark electronic music for the underground dancefloors. Screamy, but relatively clean vocals, melodic but aggressive synth lines and fast beat are the distinctive elements of Bodycall's music. On the latest album, "Reiteration" you can also hear some EBM inspirations - as long you are not a crazy oldschool fan.
