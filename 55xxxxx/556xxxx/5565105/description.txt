The role-playing game from veteran developers Bioware is set in an ancient version of the Star Wars universe, when both Jedi and Sith number in the thousands. It is four thousand years before the Galactic Empire and hundreds of Jedi Knights have fallen in battle against the ruthless Sith. As the last hope of the Jedi, you must lead a band of freedom fighters in an epic struggle to save the galaxy. Can you master the awesome power of the Force on your quest to save the Republic? Or will you fall to the lure of the dark side? Hero or villain, savior or conqueror you must choose wisely as you alone will determine the destiny of the entire galaxy.

Players train as a Jedi Knight and choose which path of The Force they want to follow: the honorable Light Side or the passionate Dark Side. The hybrid combat system combines turn-based and action elements into a totally new style of gameplay: slow enough to let players soak up the details of the story, but never bogged down by fruitless quests or collection tasks.
