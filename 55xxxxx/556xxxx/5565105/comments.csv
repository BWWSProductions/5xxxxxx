,JackJackAttack,2010-06-29T23:33Z,"I'm sorry, but mine didn't crash 5 min into gameplay... I never made it that far.... My DEP (Data Execution Prevention - Something that ""protects"" your computer from error-programs) went bananas with the game, and so I can't seem to launch..... Any idea how to unlock that feature for a program (that somehow has gotten the DEP locked by the system, so it doest work the way it should..)??????"
,archphonix12,2010-07-04T23:36Z,"works perfectly for me didnt crash once ive been playing for 4 hours now

,dinsuga,2010-07-18T12:10Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4687197/KOTOR_II_launch_Crash_fix
read it and it works :)"
,Beazlexd,2010-07-28T12:22Z,"Oh, hey, for those of you guys having problems running this game on windows XP, such as frequent and random crashing, i found a really simple solution that so far has had me playing for 3 hours straight.

Simply open the SWkotor.ini in notepad and paste the following under [Graphics Options]:

Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1


Apparently with graphics hardware of the time when this game was develope ran smoother and faster with this setting activated, so it is by default set to =0, which is enabled. Current graphics hardware, meaning most cards from 2006 on will run into this random crash problem. From what i read on the Bioware site, this problem occurs on many different OS's and the solutions are may be varied. 

For XP user's, this solution has been proven in at least 4 cases. As i said, i ran the game with screen resolution of 1400 x 1050, max AA and AF, and i have yet to have a crash.

I really hope this helps all of you having the crash problem, and i apologize if this solution has been previously stated or if it doesn't work."

,Whytepathe,2010-08-26T12:20Z,"Ok, guess I'll post this here too. Hope this isn't spamming  . Beazlexd is either very correct or somewhat correct. If you have a newer graphics card it doesn't really matter what resolution you play in. From what I've read it has to do with how SP3 (for xp users) works with modern cards and drivers. Roll back your driver to 177.79 . Since I've done that my computer doesn't know what an error is anymore. Install the game, update it then get the 1.03 nocd from Gamecopyworld. Go in and adjust your graphics the way you want it from the game side while leaving your card controls obedient to the game wishes. If you are using vista or 7 I can only presume rolling back to an earlier driver will help. I'm not sure. Today's cards and drivers try to make the game do things it wasn't designed to do. At least in my demented opinion. I hope this helps somebody."
,Walrussel,2010-09-22T03:37Z,"I might figure it out by the time anyone actually replies, but am I supposed to extract the 'data' files, 1, 2, 3, etc. before I put it onto the disk? granted, it installed, but checking the disks' content, the data files are not actually in the data folder. Also, my hardware [driver] is not compatable with this game, presumably more than what the game was made for, but followed the link to the Nvidia site to download the right thing, and my make wasn't even on the list [8800M], and I think the highest number on their list was a 4xxM or 5xxM, there could have been an 8xxM, but still....  Anything? Oh yeah and no ""Bioware"" or ""StarWars"" or ""KOTOR"" folder showed up in my programs (x86) folder at all. Couldn't find any installed data, but I know it installed.     BIOWARE!!!,......... Aight now!!!  WTF?  Anyone got anything?"

,masterofstealth,2011-04-06T18:12Z,Whytepathe how do you roll back your drivers? is there some security setting you need to change or something?
,masterofstealth,2011-04-06T18:50Z,"I've now got this weird ""emulator detected"" error when i try to play. ny seggestions?"

,Millor1,2011-05-29T09:28Z,"Ive tried everything that I can think of. Got the MS32.dll, tried cracks from several different websites, run the game with compatability mode for XP SP2, everything is updated. It still crashes on start up. Does this just completely not work for some people at all? is there no working versions? I have vista btw. Also the vertex buffer thing isn't even in my .ini file, I see everything else but that one isn't there, I even used Ctrl+F"
,nazorunty,2011-06-08T23:23Z,"How the fuck.
Whenever I try to launch the game an error window pops up with some weird wingdings looking font, Im running on windows 7 right now, what should I do?"
,xxxDFRedxxx,2011-11-13T19:26Z,So why does it say please enter disk 4 at the end of the installation process after you put the shortcut on the desktop. i need to know
