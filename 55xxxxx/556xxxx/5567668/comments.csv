,jersson,2010-05-16T23:53Z,Do you know if it's possible to download Spotify for Iphone and did you make a portable vers of Spotify ? I cannot find one ?

Spotify is already a standalone exe file, just take it from the installation and this one works as a Portable too. I don't have an iPhone, but I suppose it should work the same, so the problem is to find the iPhone version somewhere. I've not seen it anywhere."
