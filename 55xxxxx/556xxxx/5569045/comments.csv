,plonkerboy,2010-05-21T14:24Z,hey sailo thnx fo norwegian subs man:D
,plonkerboy,2010-05-21T14:26Z,can you get the wolfman to with norwegian sub?:D
[V],maestral,2010-05-23T00:05Z,Thanx. Another great BR -> DVD rip by Sailo. Never been disapointed with your work. It's always great. Keep it up
,Fepiro,2010-05-24T00:29Z,"Thanks Sailo :) !

From Chile :D"
,fuzzilla,2010-05-25T20:52Z,"Nice job, and thanks for Finnish subs.
It would be even better if you could make the real menu work. Why would I spend hours downloadin 4.37 GB when I could just download a lot smaller .avi file and use ConvertXtoDVD to make my own DVD without menu?"
[V],sailo,2010-05-26T18:15Z,"simple, cause your avi conversion would look like shit on a screen larger than 10"".
don't understand why people are obsess with a menu that they won't watch for more than a few seconds."
,ekuapa,2010-05-26T18:40Z,"Thanks for the Spanish subs =)

and yes, don't put menus, it just compress more the video "
,cinopher,2010-06-04T00:19Z,"Thanks! and thanks for including the finnish subs also :)

I think the difference whether you keep the menu or not, is pretty much insignificant :)"
,Assman123,2010-06-30T02:13Z,You`re the best upper on tpb!
