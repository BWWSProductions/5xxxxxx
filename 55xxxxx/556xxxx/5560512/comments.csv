[V],DeGun,2011-05-31T11:39Z,"@@ UNIT  : 

IF it is not because of the lengh of archive name it is then that you downloaded wrong data - to avoid that it is highly recommanded to use IP FILTER DAT here for utorrent http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=36952  and here for vuze http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=48359

so check which albums is corrompted and re download the torrent then choose the ones you need then it should be ok .

Otherwise this is available on direct download at my blog sctv83 blogspot com letter # T #... all of em .

Enjoy dat great music though"
