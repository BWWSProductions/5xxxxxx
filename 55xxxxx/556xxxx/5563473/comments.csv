,tdatb,2010-05-17T07:41Z,We need to arrest ALL the illegals in the country and sentence them to a couple years of prison at hard labor before deporting them. Make them work at building a nice electrified fence/wall in two tiers with a 50-yard minefield in between them and machinegun towers every hundred yards or so along the inner barrier. Let Mexico keep their people and their drugs; we don't want either!!!

If we can just get Kurt Russel to act, it would be a surefire blockbuster... Escape from USA where only citizens are allowed!"
