This is the major label debut from the guys who helped to popularize emo and continue its long transition from a tiny underground hardcore movement in Washington, DC to an international phenomenon.  The songs are replete with the soft / loud dynamic contrast made famous by peers Sunny Day Real Estate.  Fans will appreciate this sonic trip through the genesis of a truly great band.
