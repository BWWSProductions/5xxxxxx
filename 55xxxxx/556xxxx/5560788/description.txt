The Strawbs started out in the 60s as an English bluegrass band (!) called the Strawberry Hill Boys, but had become a singer-songwriter folk band (as opposed to traditional folk) by the time they started recording. This is their first properly released album (they had done some wonderful recordings with the lovely vocalist Sandy Denny beforehand, but these were not released until later). The overall style is based around Dave Cousins folk songs, although they've been produced in the studio to take on a little bit of that late 60s pop sound. Overall rather quaint and nostalgiac, but with an underlying tasteful and well-written art to the songs. 
If you like the late 60s original folk scene, particularly the British one, you're in for a treat. The band would go on in the early to mid- 70s to embrace progressive rock, but with a folk basis, so it's only on the Sandy Denny recordings, this album, and the following Dragonfly that we really get to enjoy the full "folk" aspect of the band.
