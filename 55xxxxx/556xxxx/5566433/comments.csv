Experiencing some connection problems atm. Super-seeding alone. Sorry for that, one of my first releases. Adding couple of fast hosts tonight. Hopefully it'll help. Seed until 1.000 ratio if possible. Thanks for contributing to community!"
,NitrogenUA,2010-05-16T18:10Z,"Wow, it worked) First two screens is a title-screen and main menu. Second pair are the screens of the first level."
,mylifsux,2010-05-16T21:00Z,Not working on mine. 4.01 M33-2 any help? And please don't tell me to update to 5.50 Gen D3 because my twisted metal eboots wont work properly on that update. I am not a noob but could use a little help here. Getting error 8002013C .  I am using a 2000 PSP (JP Final Fantasy VII PSP system). TNX :)
,NitrogenUA,2010-05-17T01:14Z,"Once upon i found this 5.00-M33 popsloader that helped me to play both parts of Parasite Eve and original FFVII. So i suggest you to try update your firmware to 5.00-M33 at least. This game is claimed to be playable on it. And try this popsloader:

Also i could try this Twisted metal of yours on my console and report back. What is the exact title?"
,mylifsux,2010-05-17T01:34Z,"I know about the Parasite Eve eboot problems as well and a hand full of others. I tried the popsloader you are speaking of and the twisted metal games will play but with no background music. TM2,TM3 and TM4 and I am pretty sure Head On has audio problems as well. "
,Rofellos,2010-05-19T04:06Z,"@mylifsux
did you find a working copy for this game and mimana iyar chronicles? we have the cfw."
,Rofellos,2010-05-19T04:06Z,we have the same cfw.*
,NitrogenUA,2010-05-19T22:00Z,"mylifsux, mate, i've downloaded TM2, TM3 and TM4 from here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4490233/(PSX-PSP)_Twisted_Metal_1-4_Small_Brawl_converted_properly(Kingd

tested all of them on my 5.50 GEN-D3. All games play background music, so i assume there is nothing to worry about. I'm using popsloader that i posted above with pops version set to 4.01 M33 (probably similiar to your firmware).

P.S.: Also i've tried this release of TM2:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4511935/PSX_PS1_PSOne_Twisted_Metal_2

and it doesn't play background music on both the PC-emulator and PSP. So i assume it is also a matter of proper game-image.

P.S.2: One day i understood that the update is inevitable if i want to play upcoming games. It's up to you now. Good luck."
,notforlong,2010-05-23T23:15Z,"is this the full game? is anything missing from the game? like movies, or in-game voices or something like that.. any information is appreciated :)"

,imakethetreesgrow,2010-05-28T05:39Z,what do you mean by the root of your memory stick? and is this the full version. with movies and such?
,NitrogenUA,2010-05-29T19:03Z,"Root directory is a basic top-level directory of the data storage device that contains all the other files and folders. Here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory
And yes - this is full version with movie-cutscenes and all that must be there."
,NitrogenUA,2010-05-29T19:05Z,"""Root is a root directory of your Memory Stick. At my pc Memory Stick locates at letter G. So the root directory for drive G will be G:\."""

,NitrogenUA,2010-06-23T14:23Z,"i've read a suggestion that you have to update your firmware up to 5.00-m33-6, in case you haven't done that yet. Also, you have to make sure KHBBS plugin installed correctly."
,redrum671,2010-06-29T20:02Z,"Hey can someone point me in the right direction? My PSP-GO is brand new and all i did was update it to firmware 6.30.

1) Will this work for me?

2) If not, what step will i have to take in terms of downgrading or whatever it takes."

,creatura_90,2011-12-24T09:44Z,"For those of you who tried to do everything and still no result, I found a solution. You have to have your plugins enabled not only in the plugins section of the boot-up menu but also in the advanced preferences. I hope I made it clear."
