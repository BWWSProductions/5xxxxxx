,djvikas,2010-06-11T19:30Z,"@ all ppls

please somebody send me the hindi audio of cars & v for vendetta

please please ........................... "
,noddyfever,2010-07-11T14:55Z,@oblivionz to switch to English on VLC by going to audio- audio tracks and selecting English
,sneezehead,2010-08-02T10:02Z,"thetorrentlord is right, the quality is awful and does not belong in the highres section. English audio track is especially heinous. I can't even watch this. I'm redownloading somewhere else that has a 5.1 soundtrack instead of this stereo 64bps junk that sounds like mid-90s era streaming video. FOR HINDI THAT ARE ILLITERATE ONLY.  You have wasted my time, ruined my movie night and used me to keep this on the internet when it belongs on betamax cassette tapes thousands of miles away from me.  Please download a real HD rip and play it on a worthwhile system to know what it's supposed to look and sound like."
,thedarkrai,2010-10-05T19:36Z,not bad.....bt cant b called an awesome release....
