Leave it to the French to find a place for kung fu in an 18th  century corsets and werewolves epic. And, give them credit for including a generous helping of sex, bawdiness and a dash of Native American mysticism, too, just to make things interesting. Precisely that and more can be found in writer/director Christopher Gans hyperactive historical horror melodrama The Brotherhood of the Wolf (Le Pacte des Loups), an everything-including-the-kitchen sink film that defies almost any form of explanation.
