,spygat,2010-05-15T16:48Z,"Hey guys

I live in Europe so the game will be released a week from now, and I cant wait that long :P

So I was wondering..
If I just create a new profile where I dont enable Xbox Live, and I just unplug my internet cable? 

Will that prevent me from getting banned? :)

Since Im playing it before the release date :P

Im no expert at this so be nice ;)"
,mabarian,2010-05-15T17:36Z,"@spygat
in your xbox360 there's a ""secret"" register with all your activity. If you do what you're saying, Microsoft DO WILL KNOW and they do will ban you sooner or later."

,les907,2010-05-15T22:33Z,"So far, with this recent firmware, I have had no problems burning RF iso files vs. back in the day where I could only burn NTSC only files. And, from what other pirates have told me, DVD Decrypter (which I use) is pretty basic, so maybe your issue is your firmware?"
,Seser,2010-05-16T00:08Z,"Alright. Lets clarify some things about banning on XBL or not.

Everything you do will be uploaded to microsoft. Is this a bad thing? No. It cannot get you banned.

What got people banned is the firmwares before would trigger one of the microsoft security checks that would flag a system to be banned. Lite touch firmware automatically passes those firmware checks for the most part. 

If your on Lite touch your one step ahead of microsoft at the moment. This could change later.

What also got people banned is playing games on Xbox live before there release date and not checking there games using abgx. You want your backups to be as close to the original disk as possible. Some people burn them without verifying the disk which will show on what gets uploaded to microsoft and you will be flagged and banned.

Now on this torrent, the games street date has been broken, so It might be  safe to play online. I walked into a wal-mart, target, and bestbuy and the game is being sold already (in the USA at least). It generally can be considered safe to play however there still is a risk right now. Its best to wait till 12:01 am on the release date to play any game that has been leaked.

If you modded take no chances:
-Keep your firmware up to date
-Check all your backups
-Dont play the games early
-Dont be a retard

There ALWAYS will be a chance to be banned. Being as safe as possible will only lessen the chances later on."
,pekerhed,2010-05-16T00:11Z,"Tested it out today.  Works perfectly.  Don't listen to the idiots who call it fake, as they obviously haven't tested it out before commenting.  Thanks, Morck22!!!"
,pekerhed,2010-05-16T00:17Z,"If you don't want the chance of be banned, the only way to be sure is to not play these burned games on the console you use to connect to XBL.  I got banned over a year ago.  So I bought another console.  Since then, I only play my ""backups"" on my banned console.  ...and I play my legit copies on my un-modded console.  It's the only safe way.   If I like a game enough to wanna play online multiplayer, then I buy it and play on my unmodded/unbanned console.  Sure you can ""stealth"" your games, but eventually Microsoft will catch up and ban you.  It happened to me, and it sucked."

But the official release date is 21 so before abgx360 dont have it on its verified online database you will get the yellow stealth uncertain message.

But the iso is ok.
If you worry about it, means tha you're afraid of the ban. DONT play it yet.

Un consejo: Play it a few days AFTER release date, no before, no de same day, no de next day, be patient and you can play 99% safe of getting a ban."

yes, remodding ur 360 is actually very easy! i did it myself (and if i can do it, anyone can do it!!).

but u need some opening equipment, so that u can open ur xbox..  do you have this?

also, u need a ''big computer'' (sry, don't know what the english name 4 ''stasjoner datamaskin'' er, lol), with a sata card and a sata cable.    
(i had sata ports on my ''main card'' (sry again) so i only used that one...

thats it, thats all u actually need of harware, but to make the process easier, u can buy some other modding devices (u'll figure).

then the software is not too hard getting ur hands on,  try searching 4 ''xbins'' google. there u'll find everything u need...

Is your console flashed? If not it won't work.
You need a program called imgburn(it's free) and DL discs and a burner capable of burning DL. If you play online there is alot more you need to do to not get banned.

Just run it through abgx360 for SSv2 and DMI like any other game. YES, you need to flash your Xbox before you can play this or ANY backup game. If you don't know how to mod your Xbox, search Google or read the Jungleflasher tutorials. It's a bit more complicated than someone could tell you in a comment box. "

i just updated my xbox to ixtreme LT.
I burned red dead redemption and splinter cell conviction but when Iput it in my xbox, nothing happened, it didn't recognize it and just said ""Open tray"" like nothing is on the disc. 
Then I have put the DVD to my PC to check if there are actually any files - everything was fine, there was even the system update folder.
After that happened I found out about abgx and patched it with the correct patches from abgx. 
Still not working, i used verbatim discs and burned 2,4x.
Battlefield bad company 2, and all other non wave 6 games work fine.
Could someone help me? I have no idea what is the problem.
