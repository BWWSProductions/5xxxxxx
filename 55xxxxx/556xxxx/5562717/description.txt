PLOT:


Marshall Seymour (Judge Reinhold) is a Executive Vice President for one of Chicago's most prestigious department stores. He is also a divorced, stressed-out workaholic with little time for his 11-year-old son, Charlie (Fred Savage). But when the two find themselves under the influence of an ill-gotten mystical skull, they become much closer... mostly due to the fact that their minds have switched bodies! Now a preteen boy is up against backstabbing co-workers, politically dangerous board meeting and a blossoming love affair- while a grown man is forced to contend with grade-school bullies, homework and a surprising scarcity of Evian water in the school cafeteria.

The comedy about not acting your age.  Just when he was ready for mid-life crisis, something unexpected came up. Puberty.   The Comedy For The Kid In All Of Us.
