"Intermittently lyrical and brutal, these are still-hot fragments from stories you'd hesitate to hear. Exhilarating and damaging, sometimes beautiful, their heat and frigidity is borne of an ironic, iconic awareness that rock and roll is not music, but theology - a belief system to which some must cling, just to keep breathing.

Driscoll employs that singular mania through a fanatical, injured intelligence and a predatory lyrical maul."

- Neil Cross
