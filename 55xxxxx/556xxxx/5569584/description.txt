Electronic experimental music.
Subtitle: Breaking the Patterns

This collection includes the experiments in breaking the patterns
and uniting all wold's musical traditions into one.

Most of the music out there is regurgitation of the same patterns,
repeating the same thing again and again is all possible permutations.
Is this the way of creativity?

It turns out, no matter what continent or tradition you look,
they fit seamlessly into one whole.
