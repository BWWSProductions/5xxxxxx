,KvdV_96,2011-08-30T14:23Z,"This torrent works completely, but the installer is Russian (which causes some problems I guess). I don't speak Russian myself either, but I managed to install this anyway. You just press what you think is next, and then you'll get a dropdown list where you can select English or Russian. The rest of the installer remains Russian, but the game will be English. Also when it stops installing you need to mount the other.mdf file!!

I enjoyed the co-op of this with my little bro!"
