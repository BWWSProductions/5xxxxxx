,Highwired,2010-05-15T21:40Z,I am seeding at 2mbs so we can get fast DLs but not sure why it is showing 0 seeders. I just need the one other individual to DL & seed with me to get this torrent going.
,Highwired,2010-05-25T11:23Z,"Sorry I have been down! I am updating & posting seasons 1, 2, & 3 complete this morning! Again, I will seed only 6 fold to maintain seed abilities but also want to keep this sustained by all instead of just me. Seed it at least once when you complete. Let your ratio hit 1 & if you want to pull it then...go ahead. I had already seeded 93gb."
