In this brand new eight part series George Clarke is The Restoration Man, travelling the British Isles meeting the stubborn romantics who want to breathe new life into the architectural treasures he unearths on his journey. His mission is to help them transform these undervalued gems into brand new homes fit for 21st century living.

In my view not as good as Grand Design series (too much talking and not enough building) but here it is anyway... :P 

8 Episodes.
