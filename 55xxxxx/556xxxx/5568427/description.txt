Those are all sourced from a different analog tape source than this and three of those are marked sources The one that isn't marked is a remaster and also transferred with Dobly B off.

Notes:
Alternate set of unmarked tapes for this show transferred with Dolby B on as per Mike's notes on the tape labels using an adjustable outboard Dolby B unit. This is the 1st time (May 2010) these tapes have ever been digitized. The sound is completely unaltered except for pitch correction during playback and fades added for each of the tape flips.

Some further info concerning this and the other unmarked tape source Winston released a few years back. That one was transferred with Dolby B off so the highs will be a lot sharper sounding than this. After much deliberation between myself and members of JEMS it was determined it was best to do the playback with Dolby B on since Mike specifically mentioned to use it even though the 1st gens were dubbed with it off. The only real question was just how much Dolby B decoding was needed. The adjustable unit allowed for the necessary fine tuning. This should be more faithful sounding to Mike's actual masters since best we could determine he used Dolby B when recording.
