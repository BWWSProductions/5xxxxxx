      Fresh from his success at the RTS Programme and British
      Comedy Awards, Charlie Brooker hosts the new series of You Have
      Been Watching, the corrosive comedy quiz show that reviews the
      weird and wonderful world of television. This week Charlie is
      joined by David Mitchell, Victoria Coren and Andy Nyman.
      Together they'll shout and shake their collective fist at the
      biggest bastards who have ever appeared on television. As ever,
      Charlie and his guests give their take on an array of TV clips
      presented for their delectation and dissection. In the spirit of
      competition, they'll be answering questions about them too.
