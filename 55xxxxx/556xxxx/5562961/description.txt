This is my first torrent, and i have been using this program for a good 6 months with no problems.  The only thing is that with vista and 7 users, right click on the .exe and hit run as administrator.  If you want a desktop shortcut, just click on the .exe file, hit create shortcut, and drag and drop the shortcut to your desktop.
