to install so it works. turn off Internet. (disable network adapter. You know how to do that in Windows?)
install program. copy and paste crack.
delete update manager folder.
copy new short cut to desktop. 
it works!
turn Internet back on if you want.
AVS makes a really handy program I'll be buying it soon.
cheers"

,trh2086,2010-08-28T23:29Z,Unfortunately I'm living in the dorms at my college and torrents programs don't work on their network. I can't even download the file from TPB. Does anyone know of any other way I could get this program?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Fasteddie_felson's advice with my tweeks) I did it and it worked

1) Turn off Internet.
2) Install program. (dont hit ""launch"" after it downloads. keep that window open)
3) Copy the crack and paste it in the directory where you installed it at. If you didnt change the default setting then it should look something like this.... C:\Program Files\AVS4YOU\AVSVideoConverter6 (thats where mine was automaticaly saved)
So it should be pasted in the AVSVideoConverter6 folder.
4) Delete the UPDATE MANAGER folder (its in the AVS4YOU folder)
5) Click the ""Launch"" button in the completed instalation window
6) Turn internet back on
~For me another window popped up and said something like ""you have 0 days remaining in your trial... bla bla bla"" i simply clicked OK.. or CONTINUE (i forgot what it said... the button on the LEFT) And when i opend the program again it worked just fine. i didnt get the ""trial experation"" window. "
