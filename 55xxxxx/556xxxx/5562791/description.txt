PLOT
The story begins in October 1941, with Japanese security forces closing in on Sorge's spy ring, which has just celebrated its greatest coup: relaying Japan's strategic war plans to Moscow. Japan, Stalin now knows, will not invade Siberia but will instead sweep south to secure its oil supplies. He can now concentrate all his forces on Hitler, without worrying about his eastern flank. When the ring's leader, Richard Sorge (Iain Glen), and his top confederate, Hozumi Ozaki (Masahiro Motoki), are arrested, they face their captors with defiance. Having brilliantly accomplished their mission, they can better endure the worst.

They first meet in Shanghai, in 1931, where Ozaki is a reporter for the Asahi Shimbun, hopelessly in love with Agnes Smedley, a leftist American writer. She introduces him to a "Mr. Johnson" -- Sorge's cover name. By this time the half-German, half-Russian Sorge has been a Soviet spy for nearly a decade, in Germany and the Far East. Ozaki begins feeding "Johnson" information about the Japanese military that he in turn relays to his Russian masters. A beautiful friendship has begun.

Fast-forward to 1933. Sorge arrives in Yokohama, again as a German journalist. He re-establishes contact with Ozaki through an artist named Miyazaki (Toshiya Nagasawa) and begins to build a spy network that includes a Croatian reporter and a German wireless operator. Sorge also joins the Nazi party and becomes close to the German ambassador, Eugen Ott, who begins to reveal sensitive information over friendly games of chess.

Meanwhile, Japan is undergoing social and political turmoil. Dire poverty forces rural farmers to the wall and drives their daughters into prostitution. Young army officers, outraged by a government they see as venal and corrupt, stage a coup on Feb. 26, 1936, that fails -- but rocks the establishment to its foundations. The militarists gain power -- and Japan begins a fatal march toward war.

Meanwhile, Sorge is busy with his love life, bedding not only the ambassador's zaftig wife, but Hanako Mitake (Riona Hazuki), a bar hostess whose combination of porcelain beauty and mysterious Asian delicacy he finds intoxicating.

Espionage remains his top priority, however. He continues to milk Ott, while Ozaki, using his expertise on China, becomes a government adviser -- and privy to top secrets.
