,Bliep,2010-05-22T14:19Z,"I'm new at this, and I realise now that maybe I should've compressed this file somehow. I've noticed my uploadspeed is not very high. Doing the best I can however. I'm seeding this for 24 hrs a day. And I will keep it available for months to come. Not during my vacations though, and I've got 2 weeks coming up this June. Please be patient."
