My other wii games that I have downloaded also are not detected!!!"

This game is amazing. Thx a lot!"
,jmugwump,2011-06-18T21:02Z,"hey strike317. Updating to 4.3 means your mod chip is no longer region free. But back-ups oin your own region will still work. If you want to get around this, and still use your ntsc discs, you need to soft mod and use the neogamma disc loader."
