,keith1955,2010-05-26T12:07Z,"REPLY FOR JESSUP:- I BOUGHT this recovery from someone who had it but wouldn't share it. I have SHARED this at my cost to help out cos NO ONE else had this. I have been seeding since the 14th of this month, and have started it again, but it is up to others who have it now to share it on.  I know by the ammount of data transfered, that at least 7 or 8 people now have it, so why not share it.  I did this to help out, not cos I had to. I also don't have the disk space or the bandwidth to leave this available 24/7."
