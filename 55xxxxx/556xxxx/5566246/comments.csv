,ripper9,2010-05-16T07:00Z,"This torrent is half the size and includes all the expansions. Why on earth a 13.53GB file?


Use this one, much faster and is half the size.

,Belhene,2010-08-01T11:11Z,"Don't use the torrent ripper9 posted. How could possible be 7.66 GB (note the ""no compression"" thing, moreover), if only Lich King client is a 6 and something GB file? It's nonsense.
I'll go with this one. At least I know that when my download finishes, I have everything inside."
