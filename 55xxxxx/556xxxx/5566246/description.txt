So yeah, this is WoW and both of the expansions (Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King) in an ISO format.

To install, just mount Disc 1, run the installer, and when it asks you for the certain disc, just mount that one.

To install the expansions, wait until the main WoW installer is done, then mount Burning Crusades and install. 

Then, mount Wrath of the Lich King once Burning Crusades is done and install. Create an account once it prompts you to, and start to play. You will then have to install all of the patches though.

I will seed this all night and sometime during the daylight hours. So don't forget to seed!!!
