,heady233,2010-07-11T19:48Z,"If anybody is getting the issue where they cant press Continue after entering any of the serials found here on Pirate Bay, this one might help. I got it from one of the torrents, and it worked for me with the 10.0.7 DMG from the Roxio website FK-2RNHX-W2N7X-M0DXP"
,vasicp,2010-09-05T23:27Z,"After  several months of normal use, I started receiving a message ""This pre-release version will expire soon. Please contact Roxio for a release version or a new beta."" with an option to 'Buy Now'.

I'm not sure if anyone else got this."
,mindfield1001,2010-09-06T16:44Z,I got this Message too .... any help?
,gerdsperd,2010-09-14T07:04Z,I'm getting the same error message despite entering the pw provided.
,Spock1000,2010-09-20T21:33Z,When upgrading from 10.0 to 10.0.8 you have to go through adding your serial again. The serials for 10.0 won't work. The serials posted here for 10.0.7 works for 10.0.8 FK-2RNHX-W2N7X-M0DXP
,Haggador,2010-12-22T00:18Z,WASTE OF TIME....vasicp is right the software locks up and does not offer a way to enter a password.  This torrent did not work for me.  I downloaded and used an update from roxio to 10.0.8 and blocked the TCP with Little Snitch
,Haggador,2010-12-22T00:19Z,BTW using the 10.0.6 installer
,Haggador,2010-12-22T00:20Z,Upgrading from 10.0.6 installer
,DJ_NRG,2011-03-05T09:00Z,I did the same as Haggador  - which seems like a much easier way of doing this.
