,passerby22,2010-05-25T01:13Z,Jesus Christ why is it that you p2p faggggggggots need EVERYTHING SPOON FED to you. Fucking retards.
,alexross8,2010-06-05T06:52Z,"uwhfuwf , it's not hard.
I use winamp.
I think that winamp comes with a free flac plugin.
If not , go online and search for a flac plugin for whatever your using to play music with.
Also , FLAC files are high quality audio files that are much better than mp3s. Honestly , I think people should make their songs in FLAC format first."

,Ardroth,2010-07-24T02:12Z,"@ passerby22 - no need for that passive aggressive behavior.  The kid asked a simple question which warrants a simple answer (which you failed to provide as well, making your comment completely useless).

@ uwhfuwf - Foobar2000 for PC is the preferred audio player for fans of lossless music.  You can get it here:  http://www.foobar2000.org/

Simply drag the .m3u file into the main window of FB2K and have at it!  

Thanks for this flawless rip of the *explicit* version!  More specifically, a BIG thank you for actually including a 100% Log, Cue, and m3u."
,Twilight99,2010-08-07T14:09Z,Thanks for this! FLAC rules!
,Imperator42,2010-08-16T05:18Z,"AFAIK, only Bad Romance, Monster and Dance in the Dark are affected by the censoring.
Glad to find this in FLAC."
,UltimaSlacker,2011-08-02T08:34Z,"@passerby22 We can't ALL be as knowledgeable as some of you arrogant, nerdy, dipshits... now can we?  Takes all kinds, moron.  Some of us have lives outside of Linux and Windows and every other frustrating and maddening device created by megalomaniacal little punks like you.  So, next time you wanna bash on someone for wanting help... stick your head up your ass, if it isn't up there already... and stow that shit."
,Mikeer,2012-05-13T16:50Z,"@UltimaSlacker, I myself get pissed off at people who expect answers to simple questions. What is so hard about typing ""how to play flac"" into google? First off, this gives an answer in seconds, rather than days, and saves time of others too."
