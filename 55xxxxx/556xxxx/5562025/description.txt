When it is discovered that the Judges--the mythical assassins who walk among the shadows to silence criminals--are real, the Galactic Federation begins the manhunt to bring down the dangerous vigilantes. Darek Wayker, an innocent delivery boy, is the first suspect...and the first to be sentenced to death. Aided by his friends, Darek escapes the clutches of the government and flees to a distant world. But the world is nothing like he imagined. Monsters lurk at every step and all signs of civilized life have mysteriously vanished. With no way off the planet, Darek loses all hope. But when he finds two others who are also stranded there--the reckless heroine called Azura and the cold-blooded assassin named Sorren--they set off on a journey across the desolate land. Together, they must battle terrifying beasts, incite a revolution, survive a horde of wrathful spirits, and uncover a plot so frightening that it will change the fate of the universe...forever. A story packed with action, suspense, comedy and mystery, The Coranite Chronicles is an intense thrill ride from start to finish!
