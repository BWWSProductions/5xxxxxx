PLOT
A slick, sometimes over the top action adventure set in New York City during the end of the disco era, Nighthawks stars Sylvester Stallone as a hotshot New York cop with a troubled personal life drawn into an international terrorist vendetta. Stallone and partner Billy Dee Williams are recruited into a covert operation to stop an infamous terrorist named Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer), whom they believe to be in New York. Soon a cat-and-mouse game ensues between the blue-collar cop and the refined terrorist through the streets, discotheques, and subways of the city. And then things get personal as Wulfgar targets Stallone's wife (Lindsay Wagner). A well-photographed action thriller with the usual fast-paced adrenaline rush sequences for which Stallone has become famous.

Run Time: 99 minutes
