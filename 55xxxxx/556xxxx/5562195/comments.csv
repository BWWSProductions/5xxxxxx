,jcja123,2010-05-15T07:07Z,how can i seed if i use limewire??
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-15T20:49Z,"i dont know jcja123.  i am guessing just dont stop it.  seeding is just when you have the full download and are keeping it running/going (not stoping) and seeding (aka sharing the full download) to the world.

i recommend utorrent for torrents."
