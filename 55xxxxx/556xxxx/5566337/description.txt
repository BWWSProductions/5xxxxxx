Hi Break Heads

Over a few months Ive recieved a few emails requesting a new breaks mix. Well Ive finally found an hour away from doing housework to put a few of my Fav tunes together (Some old, Some new and of course one cheesy) Starts at 105 BPM though quickly works upto 128 and BPM peaking at 136 BPM. Unlike my previous mix this one goes for over 50 Mins though has 15 Shit hot tracks mashed up.

Heres a track list

Super to $hort - Nick Thayer 105 BPM (Mario Bros theme sampler - the cheesy intro)
The girls say - Groove Armada 128 BPM
War Joint - Nick Thayer
Day N Night - Kid Kudi
Invaders Must die - Prodigy
Out of my mind - Lee Combs
Bass Phenomenon - Krafty Kuts
Champion Sound - Fatboy Slim
No You girls - Frans Ferdinand
Bad Boys - Inner Circle
Professional Widow - Tori Amos
Bad Ass Sandman - Crystal Method Vs Metallica
Da Funk - Daft Punk 136 BPM
Electric Avenue 2009 - Duncan Beatz

If you appreciate breaks Id love to hear your feedback.

Enjoy

Let me know what you think
