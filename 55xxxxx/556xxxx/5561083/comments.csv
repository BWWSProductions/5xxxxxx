,i9core,2010-05-14T11:51Z,cfto_can to crack aerosoft product in win7 just type %tmp% in the search programs and files box. You can find this box by click start in win7. 
,darkvisor,2010-05-14T12:14Z,"if you type %temp% in your search bar on W7, that will bring your temp folder up, then, start the FSX program only selecting the language, go back to your temp folder and copy and paste the ascrypt file into the temp file that has been created that also includes the ascrypt, hope that helps "
,cfto_can,2010-05-14T12:29Z,"It worked ...thank you very much guys!

To become a successful pirate you need to learn how to seed your torrents."
,aarque,2010-05-18T11:22Z,"cfto_can aka Rob the Hoser, take off Eh? You are a loser because you don't seed your own torrents or even return to them to check your comments/feedback.

So if you're Rob McKenzie, wheres Doug?
Beauty, Eh?"
,cfto_can,2010-05-18T17:51Z,"I did SEED the torrent for 72 hrs , by then 144 Leechs had it , I then felt ok to leave the torrent...by which NO ONE SEEDED of all those 144 ( more at later times ) .....Dont blame me sweethart... I did EXACTLY what was expected of me.
"
,cfto_can,2010-05-18T17:57Z,"As for comments and feedback , Ill ONLY REPLY to NON fighting type comments..dont like no seeds , dont download plain n simple.  Comments NOT fast enuff for you....DONT READ EM!

use yer head ...I did YOU A FAVOR...In return  , you shit on me ? How  nice , Ive explained why...as for a late REPLY here...TPB was down yesterday at least on my end.

I tried to get on many times , so how about you learn from this, maybe ask nicely why a guy didnt seed...chances are he did , if you posted , give a person a chance to reply...as you see if I could not get on here...how cvould I answer you ?  Again , out of my control....

You can post a sorry to me anytime now.

Thank You

Respectfully

,aarque,2010-05-19T01:12Z,"Hello slice, you did me nothing. I already have all your warez. I just think it is ridiculous for an uploader to proclaim how giving he is with absolutely ZERO seeds. On a torrent that is FOUR DAYS OLD, OMG! You obviously know nothing about the bit torrent peer-to-peer protocol. All TPB does is introduce us, once we have the torrent link, all - and I do mean all you have to do is leave your client connected and the seed cloud will grow. As it stands, this torrent will die in a few days when all these leech's wise up and disco.

 Oh and BTW, no need to reply hoser."
,aarque,2010-05-19T01:16Z,"oh and Pirate Bay took less than 8 hours to switch hosts - which is why they were down at all.

We suggest you grow a hide and learn to accept a little sarcasm, or don't they teach that up in the Great White."
,darkvisor,2010-05-20T11:22Z,"Hi, just a little comment, when you said had 144 seeders, they were actualy leechers who were taking it from you, if you then have seeded 100% of this upload to someone, then that would make 2 and so on but up to now, nobody has actually DL this torrent as you have not seeded to 100% and your leechers have gone from 144 down to 63"
,cfto_can,2010-05-21T06:41Z,"aarque : I agree 100 %  good constructive criticism is very good !!!

However you started out that way in your posts here, but ended up with a simple name kinda calling.

Thats  ok , I don't dislike you what so ever...and by calling a Canadian a HOSER is an Insult...somewhat.

You also drifted off course with your constructive criticism , but again ...this was my 1st torrent , I never meant to cause a ny trouble with anybody.

I just wanted to share files , and that I did.

I learned some stuff , and Im sure the next torrent will be much better , or at least Ill know how to obtain the traffic.

It was fun !!

Thank you to the many who emailed me....
I was glad I could assist them.

all in all ...it was a success !

,meda1,2010-05-27T20:20Z,"I used the ascrypt.dll trick on w7 no probs....

STEPS......

1. open one windows exploder window, go to users\[user name]\appdata\local\Temp\ and scroll to the get the last folder near the middle or clearly visable with files below.

2. Run your installer, select language (for most installers) before begining the actuall install, you will notice it has added 2 new folders at the bottom,,, the second one is what you want to go into, and inside that one is a 3 or 4 files and anotehr folder, go in that folder, you will see the stock ascrypt.dll, replace it...

3. Finish install."
