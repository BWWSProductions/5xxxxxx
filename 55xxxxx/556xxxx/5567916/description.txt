I derived the reading order from the checklist found in the various
books and also from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_(comics).

I have renamed all the files to reflect the reading order and for
sake of organization. All credits go to scanners and the writers of
the books. All files were left intact, no credits were removed.

If there are any files you think I should add or change the reading
order of, let me know! I will be glad to update the files to reflect
a better order and a fuller list.

This is my first upload under my new account SimsThePirate here on
TPB. I will also try and get it seeded elsewhere. If you reupload
this on any other site, please leave this text file with the torrent.

If you haven't read Dark Reign yet (the precursor to Siege) go snag
