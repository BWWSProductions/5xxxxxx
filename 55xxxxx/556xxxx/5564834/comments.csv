,gomatto,2010-05-16T08:19Z,PS Anyone got a keygen for the email companion?
,Jevin,2010-05-20T17:02Z,I Ran a scan with McAfee Kaspersky and Malware Antibytes so that must be the problem of online scans ;)
,James_Uno,2010-05-21T11:01Z,It Works! Scanned with Macaffee and it didnt bring up anything...when opening up the Keygen I got an alert..but thats because my AV software reads them as so. thanks uploader.
,Jevin,2010-05-26T19:00Z,"I said so :)

No need to bother with this since it might contain Viruses and Trojans!

Instead pick up the LATEST Winzip from its own site:

http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm

And then just use:

name: WinZip

Serial: F7LH3-ZHK80-EJ7EF-WX4XC-HQW01-MGN9X

And DON'T FORGET to turn OFF the

>>Options>Configuration>Miscellaneous>Check For Updates!
Set it to: ""Do not check for updates"".


And do NOT let it install the Google Toolbar while installing Winzip ...

,Jevin,2010-07-03T09:03Z,"That isn't true at all!
Cause many people checked it, read the other comments!!!

And with this you CAN update,
you don't have to put it off and you got your own serial, not the one from other ones..."
