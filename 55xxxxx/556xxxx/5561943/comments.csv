[T],KickAssTorrents,2010-05-15T01:02Z,Gipsy you will learn on here there are not many comments only complaints demonoid is the only place where people respect what you do
[V],poppedtart,2010-05-15T02:19Z,what plays this?  never heard of AVC in AVI container.
,Gipsy_,2010-05-15T10:05Z,"Thanks KickAssTorrents, but i need an invitation for demonoid :(  If you know of someone who wants to share an invitation, say something :)) Thanks"

we can do it easily, by early versions of Handbreak. (latest dont support avi)
Although container is avi, it cant play on xvid dvd players. Bcos this need x264 support.
U know how n what will play this now :p

@ GiPSY, since the movie has lot of animations, to look perfect, it need more bitrates. So dont bother about SIZE in this kind of rips. we need quality only (but b reasonable size , i.e. little more than ur avatar release :))
I'm confused now which to download now, things become more greedy. :)'

,robbievega,2010-05-16T14:26Z,"Gipsy, great rip! love the 1280x720 resolution (no black bars)... hope to see more in the future :)"
,deadlyshadows,2010-05-16T14:50Z,"@robbievega
all the movies do not release in full screen.
The rippers do not create that black bars, the original movie has that black bars."
,JadeBoy,2010-05-16T22:58Z,"Some little problems:

Size should be a little more.
Audio could do with 224kbps.
The AVI container.
Subtitles?

Except all these a good rip. Thanks"
,deadlyshadows,2010-05-16T23:41Z,"@JadeBoy
It's not Xvid, it's encoded to H264, so it's container is MP4.
224 kbit AC3 Audio is not sufficient for 6 channel audio."
,JadeBoy,2010-05-18T11:12Z,"@deadlyshadows

The uploader has himself said that the container is AVI. H264 in AVI was possible in older versions of Handbrake. Maybe you're right that 224kbps is not sufficient.

Personally, I want SecretMyth-type 720p video, and MP3 audio 2 channel. Even 128kbps will do. Do you know any uploader which does this?"
,deadlyshadows,2010-05-19T16:13Z,"@JadeBoy
Search
most of the Rippers does not use MP3 for HD movies.because MP3 does not support 6 chennels.when some one watching a HD movie, wants great audio too.
you can find 480p (DVD Size) with MP3 Audio stream."
,drjay1975,2010-09-19T01:20Z,"Sorry Gipsy_ not playable on my equipment.  PC's fine but if I plug into my LG TV's USB port it bombs, guess it's the AVI vs MP4 container that's confused it."
,penelo39mt,2011-10-09T07:42Z,The sample looks great. I'll be downloading this. Thanks!
