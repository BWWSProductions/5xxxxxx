[V],Morck22,2010-05-19T14:45Z,"you have to open the console, remove the dvd drive and conect it to your pc for reflash the firmeware, google it for tutorials."
,trulsp0r,2010-05-19T21:07Z,Ok. so i cant download any program and burn it on a cd and drive it on the 360 to update?
,sin_city_prince,2010-05-22T21:23Z,"@Mashi, no it's 2.4x is the speed you need to have it written as otherwise the game won't work properly. and i'm downloading this game right now. and its already halfway finished. maybe if you guys learned how to do shit right then you wouldn't be having these problems. keep up the good work, morck22. "
,vivek87,2010-05-24T19:43Z,finished downloading...haven't write yet.. i will seed another one week..enjoy seeding...thanx morck22..great uploader so far..
,mad4mp3z,2010-05-25T23:29Z,"it is not vital that you burn at 2.4 exactly, i personaly burn them at x8 with no problems and the still work perfectly. but the slower the bur is done the less chance of errors, it also depends on how good your pc is eg a dual core pc with 2 gig of ram and not to much running in the background should find no problems at all ware as an older pc say single core 3 ghz 512 ram would find difficulty doing it at faster speeds "
,aarstadpew,2010-05-28T15:29Z,"@mad4mp3z

Not entirely. It's definitely hardware related, but what matters the most is the type of disc you use to burn, Verbatim being the best.

It also matters what type of dvd dl burner you use, a cheaper one sucks whereas a quality burner can burn most of the games on max speed (that is the disc's max speed, never the burner's speed)."
,meatheadrhino,2010-06-10T12:45Z,Works great -noobs!!!
,eNLogic2000,2010-06-13T18:14Z,I downloaded this and burned it 3 times. I got 3 unreadable discs. I'm running iXtreme 1.61 on an NTSC XBox. You sure this is region free? Anyone get this to work on NTSC?
,Feurian,2010-06-18T13:28Z,"Thanx bro, gonna enjoy this one. Will seed for as long as i can."
,CameltoeOfTorture,2010-07-18T16:16Z,"As i'm trying to unpack it, it gives an error twice that the files are dead or whatever...
