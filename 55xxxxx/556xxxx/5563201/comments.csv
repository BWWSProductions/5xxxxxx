Is this for Windows? Mac?
Is this 1.0? 1.1? 1.2? 1.3? 1.4?

You should be more specific..."
,altar22,2010-08-01T08:27Z,Possible to have some details on the version please?
,altar22,2010-08-04T16:24Z,"Ok, installed it without a problem. So thanks for making this available.
It's MBL 1.2
However, when I open Vegas (32bit only) there's only one new fx from MBL that appears in the fx menu list, is that normal? It's not like in some video tutorials I've seen online. Any ideas?"
