Star Trek: Fan Collective - Captain's Log is a DVD collection released by Paramount Pictures. This set contains episodes from Star Trek: Enterprise, Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager.

The fans and captains have spoken! Not only have Star Trek fans voted online for their all-time favorite captain episodes from all five Star Trek series, but each show's legendary leader Captain Kirk, Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, and Scott Bakula has carefully chosen their favorite episode, which resulted in Star Trek: Fan Collective Captain's Log.

Excerpts of copyrighted sources are included for review purposes only, without any intention of infringement.

Each disc is devoted to a single series, and the first episode on each disc has been chosen as the "Captain's Pick" episode by each actor. The picks for the first four captains had previously been used as part of the BBC's Star Trek Night in 2001. The other episodes were selected based on the results of an online vote conducted on StarTrek.com.
