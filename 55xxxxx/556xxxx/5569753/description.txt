The Million Pound Radio Show was a long-running radio programme written by and featuring Nick Revell and Andy Hamilton. 
A series of sketches, interspersed with dialogue between the two, the show ran for at least six series between 1985 and 1992 


The Million Pound Radio Show, like many shows which came after it, mixed sketches about all manner of subjects with crosstalk between the two frontmen and interviews with â€˜guestsâ€™ played by the supporting actors.  The material used in the series reflected the observational preoccupations of the Not the Nine Oâ€™Clock News generation (talentless celebrities, bad government, faulty escalators), but it also dipped its feet into the history of the world from time to time.
