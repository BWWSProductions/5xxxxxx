Great set from the 'Animalize' 
tour- the usual nonsense involved 
(e.g. the 'women around here are 
like submarines' spiel- very silly), 
but this features some entertaining 
old songs- e.g. 'I Still Love You' 
etc. Transfer came out well- superb 
sound. This brought back some good 
memories of seeing them at 
Southampton Gaumont on the same tour.

Thought I would upload this as Sandra & I are off to
see Kiss in Glasg tonite.

An edited FM show most likely recorded by the
Radio Clyde mobile and broadcast on the Tom Russell
Rock Show.

Some slight crackles, don't know if that's the taper
or a vinyl rip.

Good FM recording.
