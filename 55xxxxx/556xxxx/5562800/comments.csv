,Not_Random,2010-07-16T08:08Z,"DL\'d and watched like 4 episodes...8, 1, 2 and 3 L...8 was out of order so I watched it first...Meh =\\nnAnyways, about the out of sync problem on Episode 3, if you are using VLC to play the files, then go to Tools > Track Sync. > Advance of Audio over Video > Set it to \""0.250 s\"" it works/looks fine like that still possibly a few Milliseconds off, but at least now it\'s bearable.nn@faridam, thanks for putting them all together. +1"
