"Home"

After the Japanese surrender, Leckie, healed 
from his wounds, leaves the hospital and 
returns home, while Sledge heads back to 
Alabama to be reunited with his family and 
Sid Phillips. Lena visits Basilone's home 
and has an emotional meeting with his family. 
Leckie adjusts to post-war life by resuming 
his old job and starting a new relationship, 
but for Sledge, unsure why he survived the 
war seemingly unscathed, adjustment will 
require more time.

Enjoy :)
