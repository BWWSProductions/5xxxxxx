,finalmotoko,2010-05-19T19:06Z,"This is a massive fail. Just attempted to extract it via a universal extracting program, which supports arc files, and it gives the error :

UNIX: Invalid argument
An entry in D:\Documents and Settings\My Documents\Downloads\PC Âť LEGACY OF KAIN Full Collection with Interface by glo has a bad header.
hdrver: 41
  2657 bytes skipped.
ARC: Invalid header in archive

So your arc file is corrupt. Was looking forward to this so please sort it out."
