* STORY :


* Legacy of Kain is a series of fantasy action-adventure video games developed initially by Silicon Knights in association with Crystal Dynamics. After a legal battle, Crystal Dynamics continued the series without Silicon Knights and Eidos Interactive became the publisher. Each game in the series incorporates elements of action and puzzle-solving in its gameplay and all are set in the fictional setting of Nosgoth, united by the character of Kain, the series' amoral vampire antihero.

To date five games comprise the Legacy of Kain series, each one developed for video game consoles and later ported to Microsoft Windows. The series has enjoyed critical success, and has been widely praised for high-quality voice acting, storytelling, and visuals.

Title Year Platform Notes
 
Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain NA 1996
PAL 1997
PlayStation

Windows A 2D action-adventure game in the same vein as Diablo. The game's selling points included its 50+ hour length and the wide array of items and abilities the player character commands. Blood Omen introduces Nosgoth, a fictional world designed with fantasy novel-like complexity, and gives the player control of Kain, a newly resurrected vampire seeking revenge against his murderers and a cure for his vampiric curse.
 
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver NA 1999
PAL 1999
PlayStation
Windows
Dreamcast

Based on a Crystal Dynamics game concept dubbed Shifter, which was integrated into the Legacy of Kain universe at an early point in development. The game's staff likened the technological advance from Blood Omen to Soul Reaver to the evolution of The Legend of Zelda series from the Super Nintendo to the Nintendo 64 - bringing the franchise into 3D while maintaining a similar style. The game introduces a new protagonist, Raziel, one of Kain's six 'sons' and lieutenants.
 
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2 NA 2001
PAL 2001
PlayStation 2
Windows 

A direct sequel to Soul Reaver which picks up the story where the previous game left off. The developers' overall goal was to retain the elements that made the prequel successful, but they decided to eschew the 'complete a level, fight a boss' game flow of the prequel in favor of a more story-driven approach. Raziel is still in pursuit of Kain, but now he must uncover the mysteries surrounding his own destiny.
 
Blood Omen 2: Legacy of Kain NA 2002
PAL 2002
PlayStation 2
Xbox
Windows
Nintendo GameCube 

Developed by a different team at Crystal Dynamics, this sequel to Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain has many of the qualities that make the series popular, but shifts the focus more on gore and combat, while the puzzles were criticized as simplistic.[26] The setting, an enormous industrial city, is a departure for the series. In this game, players again control Kain in his campaign to conquer Nosgoth. The events of Blood Omen 2 did not occur in the original history, and only took place in Nosgoth's timeline due to a paradoxical event which took place in the final act of Soul Reaver 2. 

Legacy of Kain: Defiance NA 2003
PAL 2004
PlayStation 2
Xbox

Windows The fifth Legacy of Kain game represents an effort to consolidate and re-balance the storytelling, puzzle-solving and combat aspects of the series, taking cues from Devil May Cry in gameplay. The player takes control of both Kain and Raziel to discover how their destinies are intertwined, concluding on a hopeful note, but without full resolution.
