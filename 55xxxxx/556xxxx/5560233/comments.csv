The Negotiation 
On the eve of the flashforward day, the world waits to see what will and won't come true from their visions. Meanwhile, Mark must protect Gabriel, Aaron finds Tracy and attempts to rescue her, and Simon meets the organization responsible for the Blackout. "
,2soxJoe,2010-05-16T21:31Z,eztv is always the best and fastest. You Rock! When the world blacked out for 2 minutes and 17 seconds I saw myself online on the eztv.it site and I was happy.
,rangers1983,2010-05-20T11:30Z,"@keka_umans

Yes this is episode 19. Episode 11 was over an hour and was labelled as 11 and 12. Which is why each episode from 11 & 12 is labelled incorrectly. Simple mistake but if u have seen all of eztv torrents you havent missed any episodes. 20=19, 19=18,18=17 etc etc"
,Z3120,2010-05-20T19:14Z,"EZTV is uploader of the year 2010! 

Great and fast uploads, which is great if you want to follow the best serie since X Files (come on, back then it was great...) from europe."
