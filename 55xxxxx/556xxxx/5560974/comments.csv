,rickredline,2011-05-12T02:18Z,The last code listed worked for me on 1.05
,killingfeilds223,2011-06-26T05:14Z,As of June 25t and 26th AH66V13Z9B works. =D
,RapierApe,2011-08-01T11:11Z,"Yeah, AH66V13Z9B works. It's a neat game. "
,ZtorkX86,2011-11-26T03:33Z,It refuses to even start for me. I found some crack somewhere and then it won't start and with the original .exe the main menu locks up instantly. The first game works fine. Anyone got an idea? Win7 64-bit here.
,Zeroarc,2011-12-25T01:09Z,Guys. Please seed a bit more?
,Leviathan07,2012-05-31T02:20Z,"Hi, just to confirm, this version of the game works for Linux?"
