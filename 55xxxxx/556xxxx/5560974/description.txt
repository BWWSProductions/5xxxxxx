This is the demo for Eschalon: Book II. The demo is fairly substantial, but you should know what to expect if you have played Book I. I personally purchased this game because I believe in the indie PC market (especially for RPGs), and this company made a great old-school game with Book I (which I admit I did not purchase). My goal, then, is to get this out to as many people as possible, to further encourage such development.

If you want to crack it, you will not have to go far, and in fact can easily get the crack separate from the game file (it is, in fact, the easiest way to go). This is because the demo actually includes the FULL GAME, but limits unlicensed copies to a demo area. This area is of sufficient size that it will be enough for most people to judge whether or not it is worth the money ($25). As the developer says, as there is no DRM, they always "respect the customer."

Enjoy.
