BBC Radio 4 Tarantino's Jukebox Part 1/2 (fixed)

Format : .wma

Duration : 00:28:32

Last broadcast on Fri, 23 Apr 2010, 23:30 on BBC Radio 4 

Composer and film music historian Robert Ziegler talks to American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino about the music he has used to soundtrack his films.

Music plays a key role in Tarantino's films, including Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, and he reveals to Robert his musical influences and the way in which he plunders his own backstory, remembering the tracks of his youth and making references to - and featuring music from - cult films and television.

Recorded on location in Tarantino's favourite virtual Los Angeles diner, the programme also provides an insight into the way music can infuse a film, and the way a film can bring music back to life from the dusty vaults. It not only forages in the annals of great popular music, but focuses on the new styles of music Quentin has found for his latest movie, Inglourious Basterds.

The programme also features contributions from Mary Wilson of the Supremes, the Dusty Springfield's manager Vicki Wickham, film producer Laurence Bender, music and film critic Paul Gambaccini, film editor Sally Menke and music supervisors Mary Ramos and Karyn Rachtman.

A Heavy Entertainment production for BBC Radio 4.
