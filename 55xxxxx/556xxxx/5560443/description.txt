               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          Puddle Of Mudd underwent a serious personnel overhaul following 2003's LIFE ON       
          DISPLAY. Drummer Greg Upchurch jumped ship to join 3 Doors Down while guitarist Paul 
          Phillips chose to follow his muse with new-to-the-scenesters Operator. POM founder   
          Wes Scantlin (vocals, guitar) and longtime bassist Doug Ardito keep the Mudd sound   
          intact here, though, moving a bit from the early nu-metal stylings to a more natural 
          comfort zone of raunchy post-alt rock. The solid collection of songs on FAMOUS       
          flaunts track after track of made-for-radio anthems, with Scantlin channeling Kurt   
          Cobain's sneer as it communes with Layne Staley's predilection for sinister-sounding 
          vocal harmonies.                                                                     
                                                                                               
          Puddle of Mudd: Douglas Ardito (vocals, guitar, bass guitar); Christian Stone        
          (vocals, guitar); Wesley Scantlin (vocals, guitar synthesizer); Ryan Yerdon (drums).

                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
