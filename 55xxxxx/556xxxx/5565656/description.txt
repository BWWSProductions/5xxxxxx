TV Title    : Big Time Bad Boy
Season	    : 01
Episode	    : 03
Code	    : BTR103
Wikipedia   : The record company CEO thinks adding a fifth band member will broaden Big Time Rush's appeal and sticks the guys with a self-proclaimed "bad boy" named Wayne Wayne, who tries to inject dissension and tension within the group. Ultimately, Gustavo and the guys band together to get him booted out of the band, in a "bad boy-off". Meanwhile, Mrs. Knight gets persuaded that there's an axe maniac on the loose, and forces Katie to play with a girl named Molly, who is later found to be a con actress that's 20 years old and tries to pass herself off as an 11-year-old girl driving in a high speed chase with cops, using Mrs. Knight's rental car, trying to get a job in Hollywood. Kendall becomes the bad boy after beating Wayne Wayne who really isn't a bad boy. Also, Mrs. Knight finds out that the axe maniac is actually the grounds keeper named Buddha Bob.


Note: Wayne Wayne is a parody of Eminem and the Magic middle school wolf is the same wolf used in Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide although in red and white instead of yellow and green.
