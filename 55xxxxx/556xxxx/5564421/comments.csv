i didn't say it is HDTV it is only Display aspect ratio of 16:9 for Wide screen Monitor Purposes.. if you have nothing to say nice don't comment. Make your own torrent."
,fdlsys,2010-05-19T16:54Z,"You really need to get the basic facts together before you start posting torrents. Resolution and Aspect Ration are NOT the same thing you know? You have declared it a/r 16:9 which it is NOT. If this is still not clear enough for you, maybe you should ask yourself why has no one thanked you yet? That might be clue... Your false a/r statement has cost me bandwidth and 1/2 day of downloading this rubbish."
[T],izialcita,2010-05-21T04:46Z,it is SDTV and it is not pixel stretch.. only Display Aspect Ratio even if i dont change it to 16:9 aspect ratio to normal 4:3 NTSC still the same... *there i change it to SDTV DAS 16:9
