           One of the first acts signed to Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst's label, Flawless   
           Records, was the alt-metal quartet Puddle of Mudd -- consisting of Wesley Reid      
           Scantlin (guitar and vocals), Paul James Phillips (guitar), Douglas John Ardito     
           (bass), and Greg David Upchurch (drums). While their songs expectedly contain the   
           rage of such contemporaries as Korn and Rage Against the Machine, Scantlin's voice  
           at times is eerily similar to Nirvana's late great frontman Kurt Cobain, containing 
           unmistakable elements of traditional hard rock (unlike the other aforementioned     
           band's penchant for rap). August 2001 saw the release of their major label debut,   
           Come Clean (which was preceded by the independent release Abrasive), as they        
           embarked on a European tour with Godsmack a month later, before touring the U.S. as 
           part of the Family Values 2001 tour, alongside Stone Temple Pilots, Linkin Park,    
           and Staind.
