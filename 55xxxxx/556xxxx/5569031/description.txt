Some funny stuff, if you like her sytle:

"When God gives you AIDS - and God does give you AIDS, by the way - make lemonAIDS."

[on anal sex] "He's, like, trying to sell me on it being "natural". I'm like, "Um, first of all - doody comes out of there, ok? And second of all - fucking doody comes out of there." I don't need two reasons when doody's involved."


Thanks for sharing & caring.

From Wiki:

The movie was a concert film consisting of 72 minutes of clips taken from Silverman's previous stand-up show of the same name, interspersed with flashbacks and comedic sketches. Silverman addresses a number of issues, including religion, AIDS, The Holocaust, race, sexism, political parties, the disabled, the homeless, and dwarfs. Silverman also performs several original songs in the film.

This soundtrack CD was also released featuring most of the musical numbers, excerpts from Silverman's stand-up comedy, and several additional non-movie songs.

In a July 2001 interview on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien Silverman used the ethnic slur "chink" explaining that a friend advised her to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something inappropriate, like 'I hate chinks.'" Silverman said she decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist, so "I wrote 'I love chinks' â€“ and who doesn't?" Silverman said that the joke satirizes the racist thought process. Guy Aoki, of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, objected to her use of the slur.

Silverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her stand-up act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: "And I mean bad, like in that black way."

("There are only two Asian people that I know that I have any problem with at all. One is, uh, Guy Aioki. The other is my friend Steve who actually went pee-pee in my Coke. He's all, "Me Chinese, me play joke!" Uh, if you have to explain it, Steve, it's not funny!")

A minor controversy also arose over Silverman's performance in the documentary film The Aristocrats (2005) [which, btw, is phrykin hysterical].

[oh, and Sarah on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, after they broke up... damn funny]
