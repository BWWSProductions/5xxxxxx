,jmadams85,2010-05-18T21:40Z,"so.... is episode one 2 hours long or something?  because ""Broken"" was a 2 episode thing..."
,ppereira1,2010-05-18T21:42Z,"if you see, broken has the double side of the others..
go imdb and check the number of the episodes ;)


each episode has more less 40min, except ""Broken"" that has 1h 20min ^^"
,bussurin,2010-05-24T04:35Z,"Hi, please upload episode 21 ;) thnx..."
,ppereira1,2010-05-24T12:22Z,"episode 21 is the last one, and it's there ,)
choose the last one if it's all that you want ^^"
,bussurin,2010-05-24T15:44Z,how?
,delston,2010-05-24T16:48Z,"Missing the last episode:

,ppereira1,2010-05-25T00:17Z,"no it is not.
go check imdb for the numbers, wikipedia is lame.

they count broken as 2 episodes but it is only one, that's why it has 120min and no 40min like the others -.-'

you are just wr-r-r-r-rong mate..."
,ppereira1,2010-05-25T15:44Z,"@ bussurin

instead of using magnet link, download torrent -> open it -> and choose only the episodes you want ^^"
,athanas19,2010-06-08T18:19Z,Im trying to dowload only the last episode but i cant :S.i chose the last one but still dowloads the whole packet
,ppereira1,2010-06-10T17:43Z,"@athanas19

,odan47,2010-06-13T16:33Z,"This is not HD, right?"
,ppereira1,2010-06-17T12:19Z,"not it's not, my mistake... 
it's not hd, but it has great quality as well... if all the season was HD it would have 21GB+, would you seed that? :/"
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-25T23:07Z,"hi man thanks , i was with u the hole way.

THANKS ONCE AGAIN .
To everyone this is a complete season ."
,DannOrly,2010-07-01T10:56Z,"TROLL TORRENT. Not legit. It's the Twilight Zone, not house (or at least its that way for the first episode). Epic troll is epic"
,ppereira1,2010-07-02T04:02Z,"@ DannOrly

do you have any idea what are you talking about? :S
of course it's legit... in case you didn't see it on television, ""Epic Fail"" start's that way, try watching at least 5min of the start...


thanks for the seeders for helping me keeping this torrent alive for all the Dr. House Fans =)"
,DannOrly,2010-07-03T00:46Z,"Your file ""Broken"", an the season premiere that was 2 parts and 2 hours long, is an episode of the twilight zone, from beginning to end.  

The beginning of Epic Fail is just like a videogame. I'm not sure about the rest of the season, but your Episode 1 is not from House at all."
,ppereira1,2010-07-04T03:31Z,"@ DannOrly


you gotta be kidding me... don't i know Hugh Laurie (House) and what he does?
tell me, why are you THE ONLY ONE who say it isn't an ""House"" episode? Maybe you don't know a thing about ""House M.D"" or you are too much addicted to ""Twilight Zone""... just stop playing me for a fool.




Don't listen to him, it's the real episode, 2 parts together which makes it the biggest episode, it's when Dr. House goes to the rehabilitation thing and he asks Wilson to do something for him so he could get out of there earlier but Wilson won't help him and then House has to do what he's told so he can leave that place..."
,24hourssleeping,2010-07-18T16:27Z,"Hey erm i downloaded this torrent and i am wondering what media software are you using to watch these files, because i am unable to watch them on windows media player even tho its a .avi file? "
,ppereira1,2010-07-19T10:58Z,I use VLC media player to watch everything =)

,MJKW2Ab,2010-07-31T02:49Z,"I was almost in shock when I heard actor Hugh Laurie (Dr House) speak in his native tongue on Saturday Night Live for the first time. He does one awesome job talking like most any American does. I just wanted to post this for anybody that was unaware, as he really is one talented guy in many ways, including playing music."
,stupey7,2010-07-31T17:19Z,Hey is there any way you could put these up converted for ipod? ive been looking everywhere for season 5 and 6 without much luck :(

you don't need to convert the series.
Just use the VLC app from app store.
It's free and easy to use."
,ppereira1,2010-11-11T21:11Z,"@hond120

i think he/she wants to see it on his/hers ipod.

,Umpie,2011-12-16T12:29Z,"BAD video quality!!!

Not really sure why so many people download this.
If it the size download the standard version of 2,5GB instead of the hi-res.

Because this torrent might be 900 width the compression is way to high, so everything is blurry!

if you want quality:
