I was just looking for the original dvds so I can rip them the  same way that you did :-D
You saved me weeeeeks!

Thanks again!"
,evilminded,2010-05-16T05:58Z,"Also what soft are you using for the rips?
I use Handbrake.

Can you post the encoding settings you use?"
[V],meech,2010-05-16T18:14Z,"Hi evilminded:
I use Handbrake as well.  I really think it's the best program out there for ripping video.  I turn all the settings up pretty high.  Probably some are overkill, but like I said in the description, my computer handles it pretty well.  The following options take about 1.5 hrs for a 4 min show.  If I rip a movie, I usually use 1-pass with a Constant Quality/RF of 16.5. with Motion Estimation Method: Exhaustive (which takes much longer...not feasible when ripping an entire series)

The options string I use for t.v. shows: ref=9:bframes=8:subq=9:mixed-refs=0:8x8dct=1:trellis=2:b-adapt=2:direct=auto:b-pyramid=1:me=umh:merange=64:analyse=all:no-fast-pskip=1.

[V],meech,2010-05-16T18:16Z,Typo on previous comment.  It takes about 1.5 hours to rip a 45 minute show....not a 4 minute show ( :

,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:33Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys

,Enh4nc3r,2011-06-26T21:15Z,"Very nice quality, but downloads at only 20 kbps average
