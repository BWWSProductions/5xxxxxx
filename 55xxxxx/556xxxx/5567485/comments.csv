The Obama Administration has exceeded Bush Administration efforts on border control.

Last year saw the highest number of people ever deported: 387,790 up from 116,782 in 2001 and 349,041 in 2008.

Thus far this year some 185,887 people have been deported, a record pace that, if maintained, will nearly double the number of deportations in 2010 to 604,133.

The Administration has also doubled the number of agents assigned to the Border Enforcement Security Task Forces and tripled intelligence analysts along the southwest border."
,oracle_omaha,2010-05-16T18:58Z,well thank you for the info from that ever so unbiased Time magazine hrmitcrb! Might I suggest you go read 'Obama Zombies' - you truly are one - 
,hrmitcrb,2010-05-16T23:15Z,"It's interesting that when conservatives are presented with facts which they don't like to hear, they invariably resort to name-calling."
,oracle_omaha,2010-05-17T04:24Z,and what facts are those troll? the fact that we deported 40 K more people last year? Great - and how many are still left that we aren't looking for troll? poor FOOL - bet you don't like AZ having to do their own illegal roundup either do you .... tell you what - why don't you go and come back later when you have grown up and learned a little something. children - they are our future - God help us all.

This book has the tag ""conservative"" because many of Dr. Duke's views would be classified as conservative, in the sense of traditional but not in the sense of status quo.  Obama, McCain, and Hannity are status quo conservatives.  Duke is a traditional conservative.

He shares the views of America's founding fathers regarding integration and multi-culturalism.

He believes in securing the border and even organized the first citizen border watch programs in the 1970s. 

He is also anti-globalist and anti-imperialist.

All of these are traditional American views that place him in sharp contrast to the diversity-mongering, open-borders marxists like Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and their cheerleaders on the False News Network."
