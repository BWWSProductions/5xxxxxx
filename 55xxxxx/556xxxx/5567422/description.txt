Firefly is the tenth album released by British rock band Uriah Heep. It was first album without David Byron, lead vocalist and a founder-member of the band, and the first of three albums with John Lawton.

Bassist Trevor Bolder made his Heep-debut on this album and has been (almost) ever-present since, bar a break of about 18 months in 1981-82.

The single from the album was "Wise Man". Also, "Sympathy" became a hit which was crucial for fans to accept the new lineup.

"Who Needs Me" was written by drummer Lee Kerslake and is about his unhappiness at the rejection, by manager and label boss Gerry Bron, of pretty-much any material by any one other than Ken Hensley. This is ultimately somewhat ironic, given the song's acceptance for recording.

Kerslake was credited as Lee "The Bear" Kerslake on this album only, due to his strong physical build and then newly-acquired beard growth.

The original vinyl album was a gatefold sleeve, with a cardboard lyric-liner.
