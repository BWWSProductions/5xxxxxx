In 2008, Barack Obama lobotomized a generation.

For an entire year, otherwise clear-thinking members of the most affluent, over-educated, information-drenched generation in American history fell prey to the most expensive, hi-tech, laser-focused marketing assault in presidential campaign history.

The result: an unthinking mass of young voters marched forward to elect the most radical and untested president in U.S. history.

Thank you's are always appreciated
