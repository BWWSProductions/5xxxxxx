"Founder's Day"

Founder's Day has finally arrived, and everyone is 
busy with last-minute preparations for floats and 
fireworks. Stefan (Paul Wesley) is uncomfortable 
with Damon's (Ian Somerhalder) new attitude toward 
Elena (Nina Dobrev), but Elena is more concerned 
about repairing her relationship with Jeremy 
(Steven R. McQueen). Jeremy is worried about Anna 
(guest star Malese Jow), but not sure he's on 
board with her latest plan for the future. While 
Caroline (Candice Accola) is enjoying her day as 
Queen of the celebration, she also tries to help 
Matt (Zach Roerig) and Tyler (Michael Trevino) 
get their friendship back on track. Finally, 
although Damon and Alaric (Matt Davis) do their 
best to stop him, Johnathan Gilbert (guest star 
David Anders) sets a plan in motion that brings 
Founder's Day to an end amid chaos, destruction 
and death.

Enjoy :)
