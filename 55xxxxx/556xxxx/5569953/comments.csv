,syl3r,2010-05-19T23:17Z,this file is to small to be BR even when you shrink the file it is not 700. most file shrink on a BR is around 1.50GS. and if you some how manage to get it that small then you have just ruined the video quality but i will DL and see how bad it is or good. p.s. standard  bluray is above 5 GS
,nisse_hor,2010-05-20T00:25Z,"thanks dude, ill take it from here."
,PhilnLisa,2010-05-20T01:31Z,"Lmao @ styl3r you don't know shit..

Look at quality of videos, like quality of clothing, a Versache shirt is a hell of a lot better quality than the a $5 one at kmart, but effectively it's from the same stuff.

I've seen a 720p movie on here, it was 'the informant' it was only 500 meg, and I shit you not, easily as good as the 4.7 gig one I'd downloaded before.

It's all about the programs they use, and the settings they prefer, each one of these guys using their own style, some have perfected it like a fine wine, so stop your bitching!

Thanks raymondhome ;)"

and thanx for upload.. :)"
,syl3r,2010-05-21T01:30Z,"ok PhilnLisa  you dumb shit 720p aint shit when you have a 60"" 1080p. and yes there is a bigg diff. you can not say they are the same. BR has more video quality b/c it can hold more data than a DVD.

BR makes no diff on a 720p it looks just like a dvd.

now watch the same BR on a 1080p (of any size) and you will see a big diff."

,Tru_Warrior,2010-05-23T04:12Z,Movie quality is terrible. wtf happened?
,PhilnLisa,2010-05-23T04:59Z,"lmfao @ Stylr

I play all my programs, via the ps3 to my 50"" series 8 samsung led, yes there is a difference between 720 and 1080, noticeable in some aspects, Avatar is a perfect example of what you're talking about...However when a 720p movie such as The book of Eli, or most of the movies coming out of Hollywank Only a pedantic retard such as yourself, can tell the difference.
If you aren't dribbling out your arse about your tv like I believe you to be, I suggest you buy yourself, or ask mummy to buy you, a decent television. Just because it's big to look at, doesn't mean it's any good....

You're comments here are bizzare, as if you were as pathetic about quality as you make out, why aren't you bitching on at the uploaders of the 1080p versions? Just as the 700Meg - 2Gig uploaders, there is a vast difference between uploader quality...Again just because the file size is 10 gig, doesn't mean it's any better than a 4 gig version.

This was a fast download, very low size, and exceptionally good quality considering the size...If I wanted full quality, I would buy the blu-ray disc, that trumps any download period. I like the other 3000 seeders wanted to watch the movie, wanted good quality to watch, and wanted it quickly, which is exactly what this torrent is.....
When you really watch it on a big screen through a $200 HDMI cable, you will realize that a quality tv will upscale this file, amazingly well...stop watching it on your 15"" computer screen, and stop bitching. "

,Jannelle,2010-06-18T07:35Z,"@ PhilnLisa 
You obviously are the one not knowing anything. A 200$ HDMI cable you said? You know that the signal is digital right? Not analog. So no matter what god damn cable you buy, 2$ or 200$ the only difference is the time that it is going to last. There is no difference on the signal sent to the HDTV."

Movie: A virtually B&W movie (a technique stolen from movie '300) and yet another post apocolaliptic roaming ""tough guy"" movie. You can reverse the 'desaturation' effect manually to make it colour again, but you can't enhance the plot. "
