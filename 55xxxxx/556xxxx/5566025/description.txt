Universal Piper is a new instrument that aims at faithfully reproducing the sound and the playing sensation of bagpipes of any types.

The idea of this new instrument emerged facing the limitations encountered with a real bagpipe while composing, rehearsing or playing on stage, especially with other tempered instruments (guitar, piano).


This new instrument is composed of two parts:

- A software with a genuine and high quality sound generation

- An electronic chanter (under development) which will capture the piper's play and pilots the software to trigger the corresponding notes.
