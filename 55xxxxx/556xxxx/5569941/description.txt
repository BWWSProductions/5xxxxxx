        Freema Agyeman narrates a series focusing on the most        
        extraordinary and eye-watering cases to come through the     
        doors of a British A&E department. Featuring a teenager who  
        stepped on a red-hot four-inch nail; a woman injured after   
        punching her partner in her sleep; and a lumberjack who      
        sliced into his own arm with a chainsaw. Plus, how medics    
        saved a woman impaled on razor-sharp railings. And           
        professionals confess the most bizarre cases they have ever  
        been confronted with in casualty.
