Lyrics and translation
Shaam savere teri yaadein aati hain (Day and night you remain in my memories)
aake dil ko mere yon tadpati hain (and they tortures my heart frequently)
oh sanam,mohabbat ki kasam (oh darling,i swear of true love)
milke bichadna toh dastoor ho gaya (separation soon after unition has now became a ritual)
yaadon mein teri majboor ho gaya
(and your memories have made me helpless)
oh sanam,un yaadon ki kasam (oh darling,i swear of those memories)
samjhe zamana ki dil hai khilona (world thinks that the heart is toy)
jaana hai ab kya hai dil ka lagana (now i have known what is union of heart)
nazron se ab na hamko girana (now don't let me put down from your eyes)
mar bhi gaye toh bhool na jaana (don't ever forget me even if i die)
aankhon mein basi ho par door ho kahin (i find you in my eyes but still you are far away)
dil ke kareeb ho yeh mujhko hai yakeen (but i still believe that you are close to my heart)
oh sanam,tere pyaar ki kasam. (oh darling,i swear of your love.)
