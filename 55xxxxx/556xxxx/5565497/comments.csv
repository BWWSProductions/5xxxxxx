,noobmert,2010-05-16T11:39Z,Old? the newest version is 1.1 this is 1.0 its not so very old? But it works? i'm seeding now :)
,jt567,2010-05-16T21:43Z,the patch works..but when camtasia updates to the newest version it needs a new code..where is it? please?

I'm sorry to tell you, jt567, that you're obviously a noob at this.

Just as caution for when you download other things, DO NOT UPDATE THEM.  This basically downloads a new version and you just completely lose the cracked version.

Download this again and install again, but don't forget to seed."
,remicornelissen,2011-07-12T17:30Z,"The software is working fine, but I do have one problem. Like... Today... From the 43 minutes which I record, Camtasia makes a video of only the first 9 minutes and 32 seconds! So not the whole recording!
In the complete 43 minutes which I want to record, my laptop is getting filled with megabites (so until I press the 'stop recording' button), so you would expect that Camtasia makes a video of the complete 43 minutes, but sadly this is not what happened.
Does anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be appreciated, thank you."
