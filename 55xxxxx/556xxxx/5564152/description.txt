JOHNNY ROTTEN PLAYS HIS OWN RECORDS ON CAPITAL RADIO 1977

Recorded at a moment in time when the young Mr. Rotten was routinely getting his head kicked in by skinheads and hassled by the police, this is probably my single favorite bit of punk rock audio ephemera (actually, itâ€™s a tie with the infamous Slits college radio interview, but thatâ€™s another blog postâ€¦). What am I talking about? A guest appearance by Johnny Rotten on the Capital Radio program of deep-voiced DJ Tommy Vance. Rotten/Lydon was invited to play records from his own collection and talk about them. He comes across as whip-smart, honest and refreshingly free from muchâ€”if anyâ€”social programing and religious brainwashing. He discusses the Sex Pistols, Malcolm McClaren (he calls him the fifth member of the band), being educated in a Catholic school he despised and his passionate love of music. Thereâ€™s no put-on here or any hint of the deliberate obnoxiousness of later years.

Where did you go to school?

[sighs] This poxy Roman Catholic thing. All they done was teach me religion. Didnâ€™t give a damn about your education though. Thatâ€™s not important is it? Just as long as you go out being a priest.

Which you havenâ€™t become.

Well no. That kind of forcing ideas on you like when you donâ€™t want to know is bound to get the opposite reaction. They donâ€™t let you work it out for yourselves. They tell you you should like it. And thatâ€™s why I hate schools. Youâ€™re not given a choice. Itâ€™s not free.

Itâ€™s an inevitable question, and a corny question, but can you think of any better system of educating people?

No I canâ€™t [laugh], I just know that oneâ€™s not right. I wouldnâ€™t dare, itâ€™s out of my depth, I have nothing to do with that side of things. I havenâ€™t been to university and studied all the right attitudes, so I donâ€™t know. No I havenâ€™t.

[fades in Doctor Alimantado - â€˜Born For A Purpose â€˜]

This is it, â€˜Born For A Purposeâ€™, right? Now this record, just after I got my brains kicked out, I went home and I played it and thereâ€™s a verse which goes, â€˜If you have no reason for living, donâ€™t determine my lifeâ€™. Because the same thing happened to him. He got run over because he was a dread. Very true.

The music he plays is a revelation.  Can, some rare soul, Tim Buckley, Peter Hammill (he accuses Bowie of copping the Van Der Graaf Generator front manâ€™s moves), Captain Beefheart (he plays The Blimp!), Nico, John Cale and of course, lots of reggae. When Rotten plays the dub B-side by Culture (the track with the lopping bass, barking dogs, crying babies and blaring car horns) you can hear the blueprint for the PiL sound that would come along just a few months later.

It must be said that for a 19-year-old heâ€™s got astonishingly good taste in music. This really is an incredible thing to listen to. For the musical education alone, itâ€™s great, but listening to the thoughts of this controversial, brilliant young man at the height of powers is a sublime pleasure. It even contains the radio commercials from the broadcast.
