,war59312,2010-05-25T06:26Z,"WiKi group sucks ass!!!

Too may reference frames!!

And 1080p release has too high of max bitrate.

These Idots suck!!"
,docgreen81,2010-06-09T04:15Z,"Gee War59312...  If they suck so bad why haven't you uploaded your ""better"" version?"
,crayolakidd,2010-06-17T13:02Z,"I very rarely rarely can a b/t upload, but have to break tradition for this one. While the audio was crystal clear, it was rarely in synch with the video, which flickered at rapidly alternating frame-rates like a moth on LCD!

This is NOT a codec issue... I regularly enjoy movies (inc bluray rips) in HD MKV format, all without issue. This was just plain unwatchable!"
,totenkopf1891,2010-06-18T19:37Z,"Nice movie, for viewing once though. "
,Quark1,2010-08-13T17:24Z,"Ok d/u-loadspeed ~1,3 MB/s both ways. :)"
,Payhour,2012-06-19T02:10Z,"Hey, I have download this torrent and I got an e-mail warning about this download any one know where it comes from ??
