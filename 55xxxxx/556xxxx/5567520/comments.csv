,ScreamingDeath,2010-05-16T20:39Z,Doesn't this come on the original OS dvd?
,cameronis,2010-05-16T20:42Z,"Yes it does. But it's a pain in the butt if you lost your cd or scratched it. And this also includes the 3.1 update. It is nothing that can't be found elsewhere, this was simply created to make the process much easier! "
,cameronis,2010-05-17T02:23Z,Is this working for people? Please post results.
,bossob,2010-05-18T16:51Z,just download the dvd and extract the image
,classy35,2010-05-18T17:04Z,I have 2.2 on windows xp.  It doesn't autoupdate?  is 3.0 for WIndows 7?
,cameronis,2010-05-18T21:58Z,"3.0 is for XP SP2 (I beleive) and up. It is exactly what comes off of the Snow Leopard DVD. It won't auto update (also as far as I know), but if you just download and install this then the Apple Update for windows should update to 3.1. If not that is included in this torrent. I just made it to make this all as easy as possible! ;D"
