Didn't know if this should go under Windows or Mac. :P

This is exactly what the title says. I zipped the Bootcamp folder straight from the CD, and this comes with the 3.1 update for either 32 or 64 bit. Choose the one you want to download and have a go at it! This is my first torrent, so leave a comment if you need help or have a question!

Thanks and Enjoy

Please Leave comment and give good rating (if it works of course). 

I'm uploading as fast as I can until 15 or so people get it (20 Mbps), or for a few days, after which I'll still upload, just not nearly as fast. :)
