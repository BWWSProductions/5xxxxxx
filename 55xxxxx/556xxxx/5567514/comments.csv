,Tant_Asta_03,2010-12-29T22:36Z,"CHEAT:

Make the towing trucks cost only one Euro: Go to the directory where tow truck simulator is installed, open the folder ""vehicles"", example: C:\Program Files\astragon Software GmbH\Tow Truck Simulator 2010\vehicles.

Now you see about 8 files called ""towtruck-file"".

Open each towtruckfile with notes and look for the column ""price"". Change the price to 1 in every towtruck file and you can know go to the dealer and buy each brand new towtruck for one euro!
