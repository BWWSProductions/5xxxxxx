[V],poppedtart,2010-05-20T23:00Z,wonder why these videos are having glitches now.  This and wolfman.
,Robbah187,2010-05-21T01:16Z,glitches were during a super cool part too heh
,vikoula,2010-06-25T19:07Z,SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Archangeldawn,2010-08-02T06:38Z,"like aoloffline previously stated there are glitches in 39m09s-39m30s and like Robbah187  said, during a super kool part too. I had this converted to DVD so I wasn 't sure if it was during the conversion process or the original file source. So I applaud you aoloffline for the honesty.
  The few seconds of glitch did not take away from this movie.
V : 8/10
A: 10/10"
,ultimate_fluff,2010-08-04T15:23Z,ive never downloaded blu-ray before...so can i just play this straight from my ps3?
,Hshin,2010-08-05T02:02Z,"@ Dartgh who claims:
""No glitches. Everything depends on your computer.""

Really? Then I must have your computer, seeing as both my 2010 bought PCs, one a laptop, the other a desktop, both having great video cards, and both showing the same glitch at the exact same time. Tried 4 different ways too: K-Lite, CCCP, BSplayer and VideoLan. So let us know what computer you have, k? That way we'll know what PC to upgrade to the next time. "
