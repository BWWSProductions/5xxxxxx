Those contain the soundboard or a mix of the soundboard and audience recording in some form, this is only the Millard audience recording

That is from a different analog tape source which is a marked Millard copy. This is mark free copy of the recording.

That is a remaster from a different marked tape source with patches from an alt source of this recording while this just Millard's recording with no patches, no remastering.

Notes:
Previously uncirculated set of unmarked tapes for this show transferred with Dolby B on as per Mike's notes on the tape labels using an adjustable outboard Dolby B unit. This is the 1st time (May 2010) these tapes have ever been digitized. The sound is completely unaltered except for pitch correction during playback and fades added for each of the tape flips.

Some of you may ask what's the point since an awesome soundboard recording has come out for this show recently. Well the answer is exactly that what is the point of sitting on something like this now. This has always been one of my favorite recordings and argueably one of Millard's best he ever made. Soundboard or not this recording is awesome and possibly one of the best sounding ever by any taper period.
