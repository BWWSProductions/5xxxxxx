,cainemvhzc,2010-05-15T19:04Z,"congrats RiddlerA the leachers for alice in wonderland crossed 1000!!!!!!!!
now u r getting recognition. . . . ..  u should get a purple skull
congrats again mate....... "
[V],pluto999,2010-05-15T20:00Z,@cainemvhzc: As far as i know purple skill means trusted and green means VIP.. So i think you know now which one is better..
[V],RiddlerA,2010-05-15T20:22Z,"@ pluto

Infact, Cainem is right, to an extent
Purple Skull is higher than VIP

Purple - Helper
Green - VIP
Pink   - Trusted

But, I don't think I deserve Helper as i don't spend any time on the forum or in helping by reporting Spammers, Fake Torrents etc"
,sadhu19,2010-05-15T22:25Z,"hi RiddlerA,
