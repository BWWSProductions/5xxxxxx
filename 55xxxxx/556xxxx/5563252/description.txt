Sid Meier's Railroads! marks the return of the watershed title in simulation/strategy gaming that launched the popular â€œtycoonâ€ genre, and inspired a new generation of games. Sid Meier's Railroads! comes home to its original creator, the legendary Sid Meier, who, together with his team at Firaxis Games, will take this game to a whole new level of fun!
The greatest railroad building game of all time is back in a vibrant 3D world delivering exciting multiplayer options, in-game customization tools, streamlined interface and unmatched gameplay, that's easy to learn yet challenging to master. Combining the best of real-world and model railroads, Sid Meierâ€™s Railroads! puts you in charge of building the greatest rail empire in the nation - managing trains, cargo and your bottom line - while engaging in all-out corporate warfare against rival tycoons, slick entrepreneurs, and robber barons!

 - Real-time action â€“ lay track, route the trains, and the world comes to life. Cities and      industries grow up around you as you service them, hauling raw materials to market and    carrying manufactured goods away; Cargos are loaded onto train cars and passengers    shuffle between cities.

 - Easy to get started â€“ laying track is as easy as clicking and dragging. Bridges, tunnels,    railroad stations and switches sprout up automatically where theyâ€™re needed.
 - Challenging to master â€“ with a new market system that tracks supply and demand and         complex random events that can cause a boom or bust at any time, players must stay on        their toes at all times or risk obsolescence, financial collapse, or hostile takeover.
 - Itâ€™s all about the trains! â€“ over 30 trains to use, from the primitive 0-4-0 Planet to    the Super powerful 4-6-6-4 Challenger, from the classic diesels to ultra-modern bullet    trains.

 - LocoBuilder â€“ design your own steam engine from the ground up, and deploy it across your    rail empire! Customize your train liveries, from color schemes to custom logos.

 - Weâ€™ve got the goods â€“ over 20 different goods to harvest, produce, and sell, and 30    unique industries, from lumber mills to war factories, each with detailed, unique    animations.

 - Scenario and map editor support â€“ enables user-created maps and scenarios. Want to create    a race to complete a transcontinental railroad in 30 years using only steam engines? No    problem!

 - Something for everyone â€“ build your dream train layout in train table mode, or challenge    historical giants like Cornelius Vanderbilt, J.P. Morgan, and others in single-player    scenarios.

 - Multiplayer â€“ Ruthless real-time LAN and Internet play. Buy out your rivals or cash in       favors to sabotage their shipments! Whether you prefer heads-up competition or the    camaraderie of cooperative team play, youâ€™ll find a fantastic multiplayer experience    here.
