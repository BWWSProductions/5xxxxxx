press any key and it will install

this takes about  30 mins,did 4 me

it will then come up with 5 options, these i had problems with as couldnt play, kept askng for steam to be running, now i pressed them all and some how dont know how i got it to work without steam installed. and had no problems with it.

if its ging straight to the 5 options when u go to install it could be a problem with the download or hasnt installed prop, check your C drive and delete any left 4 dead 2 folders and start again, this game does work but some people are having problems with it"

And telling me that there's no malware in the .bat file, holy no shit sherlock. And here's me thinking there was a line somewhere in there that said FORMAT C:! Good thing not even some serbian retard with fetal alcohol syndrome would think to fuck with the actual files extracted by the .bat!"

5: if you think you are smart gay you don't want to put viruses on your Pentium III why you came here ? and you start winning also if i want to format you HDD to be more specified you gay porn you think that's hard ? you think your AVG will protect you go get a life looser 
6: maybe some anti Low viruses will give you an alarm it would  say something like this file contains CMD command idk i guess i use  McAfee VirusScan Enterprise v8.7i / NOD32 v4.2.40 best for now 

this game works for me just fine so i shared with yo it does not matter if you download or not it's up to you if you think there is a virus don't download it am against files that contains viruses also i don't understand why ppl compiling viruses ? maybe there is a war between those companies that building Anti Viruses and selling them that's lot's of money :) who knows maybe our retard friend here knows ?

,evilmtv,2010-06-12T11:06Z,"ZhangKhaiEn>
1) in console, key in
snd_rebuildaudiocache
it'll bring you to the page as though you're loading a map. Its taxing on your PC so do it when you aren't going to need to tab out etc. Takes about 10-15 minutes depending on your PC. Once completed (loadbar reached full), you have to manually close the program eg. end task/process.
2) not sure, sorry. Have never encountered it. Try updating to v2.0.2.0?

Emp230E>
Yes. I've tried with Garena after updating these files to v2.0.2.0

heywood_j>
My licensed up-to-date AVG scanned it clean.
Game worked perfectly for me.
Up till now it has done nothing to my PC.
So please have 2 MSN accounts and screw yourself instead of flooding the comment box with your useless spam.

Alari93>
Yes, that is one way. I'd recommend that or you could try cracked private severs. I've not tried that myself so I can't give you any details. Try googling them

Christ, this torrent is more confusing than a $2 German hooker. ""NAI RONG HOLE NAI PULL OUT NAI PULL IN NAI!!"".

Here's a tip for your next torrent: Tell US -the people who download your shit- in the SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE, how to USE YOUR SHIT.

Such a convoluted, overly complicated, and fucking useless torrent. I advise everyone who's interested in playing L4D2 to leave this page and download it elsewhere, it's not worth the fucking headache to try and understand HALF of the instructions on this fucking page.

,FagBelowMeSucks,2010-06-19T11:38Z,"Okay, for all you guys saying it freezes in mid-loading. Its because you have the multiplayer dll running instead of the Single player and too change that all you have to do is go into Rev.ini and write ""\\"" or ""#"" beside 'ClientDLL=steamclient_l4d2.dll'. Thats how to make your game load all the way to actual play. If your are suffering from lag, disable SteamCloud, V-Sync, and make sure you have at least 2 of the video setting set to either Low or Medium depending on wether your computer sucks ass."
,DaniilEST,2010-06-20T15:24Z,"Let me say that this torrent is pure sh*t. Why?
1. Long install
2. Messing with .INI files
3. Malware
I went through all this and all I got is intro video and an engine error after that. 
Anyone who thinks the same way should go and download the original version of this messed up junk. 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5415400/Left_4_Dead_2_-_V2.0.1.1_(Patched_For_Online_Gameplay)_PROPER_.F

Download this one instead. 
1. No messing with .INI files
2. No malware
3. No frustration
All you have to do is extract and double-click the ""setup"" icon and go have a smoke (if you smoke). Easy.
Haven't tried it online, but the singleplayer works just fine. Oh, and do read the ""readme"" file.

Thanks for reading. Cheers!"

Noticed that some people are wondering what the minimum requirements are, and if their computers will run this game.

Simple way to find out:
Go to www.canyourunit.com
Choose Left 4 Dead 2 from the drop down list.
You may have to install the java runtime application, but it's completely legit.
________________"
,Dig1taL,2010-06-23T13:11Z,"Just to let you know:
I installed, I didn't update anything, just ran the setup.exe

First thing I did: Play on a versus server. IT WORKED.

Then, I decided to play on The Passing. The game closes itself before loading the campaign.

Then I tried Dead Center. That crashed too, so I assume that either single player doesn't work or co-op doesn't work.

Gonna try updating it to 2.0.2.3 now."

,silentbob515,2010-07-01T12:59Z,"working release,but there is some things.Lets say Trimidogg need think before action and dont be such a noob.Why he have to think and dont be such a noob?Because this motherfuckin instaler extract L4D into C:\ partition and it cant be changed.Im not talkin how much lame is when you have games on same disk with systam.If you wish lost all your data with reinstall...feel free.Anyway i have quite new light speed disk for my Win7,unfortunately there is not enough free space for this game.So if u have 40gb 10k Rps disk with Win 7 do not download this release.U will wish kill this uploader"

,AntraxM,2010-07-06T16:19Z,"Hello.

I still can't understand a lot about this game's setup.
I've installed the 2.0.1.8. v of this game, and already used this 2.0.2.4 update.
But when I try to create a new game or join servers, it doesn't seem to connect to the network and it ends up in a loop. I've read some .txts and it seems I need to choose option 4 at the update.exe to join an online game.  I tried it and the answer was ""no instalation record find at.... /left4dead"". How do I get this to work? Sorry for the spam."
,Infected03,2010-07-07T16:07Z,"Steam dosnet allow me to play this version    its says  ""no permission to play left 4 dead 2"" when the intro trailer finished. How can i get around this        in order to play the game  it requires steam so i cant turn it off and when i turn it on steam says i have no permission       Any Help?"

,Ello64,2010-07-12T22:24Z,"Hey trimidogg, for some reason, my AVG (how worse or good it may be) detects a virus in both the normal .exe as the V2.exe in the download. I believe you if you say you didnt put one in, but now I cant run both the .exe as the V2.exe. What is the password from the .rar files so I can install from there? or is there an other solution?nnAnd the links to the play-shqip website are down."

,sharkzfan,2010-07-25T02:39Z,"Hm... I downloaded this game, chose option #4, and when I tried to run it, it CTD'd after the intro clip. So, I tried updating it to v. 2.0.2.4 (the other torrent), and when I tried to run the game, a message popped up saying, ""Failed to load the client DLL, the operation completed successfully."" Am I the only one here getting this... or did I do something wrong?"

,delakron,2010-11-02T01:07Z,because i have free space in my second and it seems that installation path is unchagable.
,MonkeyPirate419,2010-11-02T06:33Z,"Nice torrent, seems to check out...
but i never install games on my C:\ drive, its just a bad idea. I keep it partitioned at 50GB and another partition for gaming at 200GB. So how do i change the installation path? Or is it even possible? Because i only have 5.5GB free :P
Thanks"

,cire666siuol,2011-03-05T07:53Z,"@cnotorious2: I haven't downloaded this yet, but my guess on why you can't open the rar files without a password is probably because you're not supposed to open them... Just run the install that comes with it and it extracts and installs the game, I'm guessing anyways..."
