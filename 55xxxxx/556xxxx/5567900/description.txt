Parade of the Athletes is a retrospective mix by trance  DJ/producer TiÃ«sto of his live set performed during the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece on August 13, 2004 (see 2004 in music). This was the first time that a DJ was asked to perform for a ceremony at the Olympics. Recognizing one of their own, the Dutch  team came up to the booth while TiÃ«sto was performing this set. All of the songs on this track are original songs composed by TiÃ«sto except for Adagio for Strings, which is his own remix of Samuel Barber's piece by the same name (the remix was also influenced by William Orbit's original electronic remix of the song in 1999), and "Athena", which is also a remix of Albinoni's Adagio in G minor..
