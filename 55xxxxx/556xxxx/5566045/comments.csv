I'm sure there's a VLC expert out there that can tell me how to fix it.

Keep on seeding guys and spread the love.

Mister_Gee: Im 
using kmp and hpch and it sounds hollow on both so i dont think its the vlc."
,LordErzU,2010-05-17T04:52Z,"Yeah, the audio is bad. It's only got the left and right front 5.1 channels, not the center, so everything sounds hollow and center-channel dialog is inaudible.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you haven't already; someone will presumably nuke and proper it soon."
