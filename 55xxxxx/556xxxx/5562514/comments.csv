,jkidd89,2010-05-16T17:39Z,"Hey Dimmis80.

When I download both the .dvd and .iso.

Do I only write the .dvd file onto the the disc using img burn?"
,ZaaX,2010-05-16T19:45Z,"I got a problem, Since my xbox is banned from Xbox live i got worried i shoudlt be able to download and rip anymore games, but my old games seems to work so i tought this would do too. After i downloaded it and burned it with imgburn ( The DVD file ), But it doesnt seem to work. Is this because im banned from XBL or might i done something wrong, someone said something about clone dvd, dont think ive done that."
,ZaaX,2010-05-16T20:41Z,@Dimmis80 I don't get any message at all. Its just like i put in a completetly empty disc. The xbox 360 intro just loops around. Like im playing a normal DVD video.
,ZaaX,2010-05-16T20:44Z,"I'm starting to think ive burned it wrong. This is how i did it, i burned the iso file with imgburn, but it told me to burn the DVD file instead, so i did, I waited for the whole burning process. And that pretty much it. Can someone tell me exactly how to burn this with Imgburn? BTW i use DVD+R DL too."
,ZaaX,2010-05-16T21:45Z,"I did it with MAX speed, Whats the diffrence? Otherwise i have done like you told me. Btw Dashboard? How do i update stuff on my xbox without xbox live?"
,shaliru,2010-05-16T22:08Z,"@ZaaX thats the problem. you're burning at max speed. Always burn at slow speed. people say 2x, but i usually burn at 2.4x and my games are fine.
Let us know how you get on. I too have a banned console but other games play just fine. hope that helps."
,ZaaX,2010-05-16T22:47Z,"I just burned it at 2x Speed, Same problem. Btw why do i have to burn it on such a slow speed?"
,ganjacooliman,2010-05-16T22:59Z,burn it 2.4x or 4x speed you don't need the verbatim disks imation dl work fine too.and many others
,ZaaX,2010-05-16T23:11Z,"Just updated my Dashboard too, still doesnt work."
,jkidd89,2010-05-16T23:55Z,"Thanks for the tip dimmis, quick question. What verbatim do I use? The 2.4x Verbatim disks or the 8x verbatim disks? I do know that you have to burn at 2x or 2.4x but I am confused as to which verbatim disk I have to buy. "
,joeboo1972,2010-05-17T00:53Z,"playing great 
i burned it to a memorex 8x
works great
is the rockstar code o 1 time thing or can someone share thiers"
,ZaaX,2010-05-17T02:46Z,Whats activate iso disc?
,CivicScootin,2010-05-17T03:41Z,"@Zaax - Check out this link for more info on the Active ISO boot disk - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5133040/Xbox360-activate-iso

In short though you do not need it as long as your running IXtreme 1.6+

As long as the .dvd forwared to the .iso disk with in ImageBurn the game should work just fine..

Running on the latest dashboard on a banned system now.. 

Plus yes its a great game.. 
Might as well just buy it ya'll...

Later,

,dj_fabio,2010-06-26T23:27Z,"Why doesn't this work for me? I have Ixtreme LT and burned it with imgburn (2,4x, verbatim) 
And yes i updated trough a flash drive"
,dj_fabio,2010-06-27T15:56Z,"Hi there,

i just updated my xbox to ixtreme LT.
I burned red dead redemption and splinter cell conviction but when Iput it in my xbox, nothing happened, it didn't recognize it and just said ""Open tray"" like nothing is on the disc. 
Then I have put the DVD to my PC to check if there are actually any files - everything was fine, there was even the system update folder.
After that happened I found out about abgx and patched it with the correct patches from abgx. 
Still not working, i used verbatim discs and burned 2,4x.
Battlefield bad company 2, and all other non wave 6 games work fine.
Could someone help me? I have no idea what is the problem.

Thanks"

,apwhitelaw,2011-01-17T06:53Z,"Oh my gawd this is a fast download. It started off jumping back and forth, slow and fast, but after a few minutes it got settled at around 1.0Mb/s but at one point it went all the way up to 3.0Mb/s and now it's settling around 2.5 or so. still crazy fast."
,LadyBlackArachnia,2011-08-22T00:44Z,"I'm new at the game content thing, so how does this work exactly? I get this torrent, hook it up to my harddrive and magically I get the whole game on my xbox with no questions asked? I heard that content can't be copied kinda like Disney's movies."
