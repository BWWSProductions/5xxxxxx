Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel was a radio situation comedy aired during the 1932-1933 season on the NBC Blue radio network, and which starred two of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico.

During the early 1990s, adaptations of recovered scripts from the original Marx Brothers radio show were performed before modern audiences and broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

This experiment proved highly successful, and two further series followed. The lead roles were taken by professional soundalikes, and the show attracted guest stars of the calibre of Spike Milligan and Dick Vosburgh.
