,Tex_NL,2010-08-24T22:07Z,"The 2006 game (this one) is crap. Maybe a 6 year old will like it but you probably won't. Gameplay and graphics are prehistoric.

Looking at available screenshots from the 2010 game (NOT this one) atleast the graphics look alot better. I know the game must be out there somewhere but I haven't seen it yet."
