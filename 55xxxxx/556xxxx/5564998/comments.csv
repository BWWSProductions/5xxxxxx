Kagan's historical review of why socialism in the first part of the last century achieved only minor success is nicely written and rather interesting.  But it's hardly an advocacy piece.  In fact, if you lean that way you'll probably be disappointed that the next Supreme Court Justice showed so little enthusiasm for her subject even in what for many is a period of idealistic youth."
