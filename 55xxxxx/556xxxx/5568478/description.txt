In Formula One every call you make means the difference between podium glory 
and bankrupt disgrace. With EA's F1 Manager you can take on the likes of Ron 
Dennis, Jackie Stewart, Eddie Jordan and Alan Prost. You'll be able to direct 
your team strategy from the virtual pit stop while viewing the real-time, 
3D race. Commentary, race previews and post-race analysis will be provided 
by ITV's Jim Rosenthal.
