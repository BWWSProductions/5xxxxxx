,aquickheadsup,2010-05-28T16:11Z,"The game worked for me, but then froze shortly into the third or fourth enemy encounter.  Can't say I was too upset, though, as this game feels like a step backwards from previous PoP titles.  I uninstalled immediately after the freeze and haven't looked back."
,EpyxZ,2010-06-22T21:42Z,"if you get freezes create a text file with gameid.wip with the following inside it.

007AAC6A 7A6B6F6A 6F6A7A6B
007AAC75 7C7A6939 69397C7A
007AAC82 7376686B 686B7376
007AAC92 80717570 75708071

,MechwarriorPuppies,2010-12-15T07:03Z,"The text above for the .wip file works for me. Here's how I got it to work: I updated to the latest version of USB Loader gx (r938), then opened notepad, pasted the above text and saved it as RPWZ41.wip and put it in the USB Loader gx folder on my Wii SD card. Simple! It didn't work for me before I updated."
,vinnylima,2011-03-11T20:46Z,"Works perfectly on my NTSC-U console w/ Wiikey 2 (running through Disc Channel).
By the way, this is indeed the American version of the game, but Wii Backup Manager shows it as Region Free."
