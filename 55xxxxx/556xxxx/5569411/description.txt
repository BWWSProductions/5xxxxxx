'Ours is an elastic planet. Things bounce. Things cohere. And things snap.'



The series was by Ben Moore and narrated by Oliver Postgate


Six episodes were made and overall the show went down very well. This was mainly thanks to the wonderful narration by Oliver Postgate who made the utter nonsense written comprehensible and entertaining. 

Ben Moore: Being a child at the time of Bagpuss, Ivor the Engine and Noggin the Nog, his is a voice I instantly trust. I could listen to him read bus timetables all day. Not that he would, I'm sure, but if he did, I would listen to him.

Elastic Planet is a very gentle show, nothing too challenging and fairly meandering in its style.

Episode 2 - THE TRAIN

You and five other passengers are sitting in a carriage on a train to Whittleble in 1947 - a child genius, a government minister, a man with the head of a fish, an opera singer and a chef. All their stories interrelate but none of them quite realise this before they leave the train.

Cursed Swedish operas, the elite Mime Squad from the Second World War, Methodist pirates and primitve restaurants all come into the tale.

With Miriam Margolyes, Dan Strauss, Michael Troughton, Neil Mullarkey, Ben Moor, Patrick Moore, Richard Baker and Sir Robert Stephens.

Episode 3 - THE SHAPE

Johnny Ball on 'Think of a Number' draws an odd shape with four and a half equal sides on a blackboard. The show is 'lost' by the BBC and reporter Eric Poems follows the conspiracy that has suppressed the truth about the 'Ballagon' ever since.

Spanning the sinking of the Titanic using artificial icebergs, Practical Home Voodoo magazine , drugged electricity, in-utero advertising and rearrangement engineering, the truth is a shocking one. . .

Epsiode 4 - THE LIFE

Following the story of Hamilton Pramden, who was born literally with a silver spoon in his mouth, a whole range of facts about the natural world emerge. He translated the rude songs of birds into English in the Nineteenth century and we meet people developing sharper grass, hurdling cattle trainers and proponents of ant prisons. Along the way the beauty of nature is everywhere, from gong beetles to the carpenter elephants of Africa who toil in the elephants' lumberyard.

With Dan Strauss, Kerry Shale, Geoff McGivern, Fiona Allen, Ben Moor, Brian Hayes and Julian Pettifer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 5 - THE OBJECTS

A chest washes ashore on an island in the Indian Ocean. What connects the objects within and what is the history of the man who owned them? And how does a piece of flamenco guitar music fit in?

Siren writers, spoon designers, the tactical paint deposit, and the invention of washing up liquid all contribute to the strange tale. And the flamenco guitar music. . .?

With Rebecca Front, Geoff McGivern, Dan Strauss, Kerry Shale, Ben Moor, Caren Keating and Raymond Baxter.

Episode 6 - THE TRAVEL

The World Unfurled, a travel radio series presented by Warren Spurgeon is previewed in this story. We follow Spurgeon as he travels around this elastic planet and wonder just why he's doing it.

He visits the doubting monks of St Thomas the Disciple, the original location of the White Cliffs of Dover before they were brought to Britain as spoils of empire and Pennsylvania where too much gravity has been dug up along with the coal.

With Dan Strauss, Michael Troughton, Doon MacKichan, Kerry Shale, Alexander Armstrong and Ben Moor.
