,c_programmer,2010-08-16T05:12Z,I lost all interest in the series when in passing I saw the guy explain that any fraction that is over a 0 is infinity. This guy has a degree from Harvard and made a high school math mistake... There is either something wrong with this guy or he knows that we don't know very much about the subject and will make crap up. I find the latter more likely.

it *is* kinda classic...

In reference to the mention ""divide by zero"" - I picked 
up on that too, but I assumed it was intentional, using
(apparently) non-standard thinking/labeling.

""The function y = 1/x. 
As x approaches 0 from the right, y approaches infinity""

Thanks for the feedback. Hope you (all) enjoyed the book.

,c_programmer,2010-09-15T20:10Z,"If thats his alternate thinking, his math doesnt match reality. Let me explain:

While all fractions approach infinity when their denominator approaches zero, assuming their numerator is constant they approach infinity at different but constant rates. As soon as they reach infinity (which is not a number) they all become equal regardless of the numerator. The laws of Algebra looses effect if this can be done, see the following equations
x=9
y=6;
x/0=inf
y/0=inf
This means that
x=0(inf)
y=0(inf)
Therefore:
x=y
6=9

This is obviously not true, so division by zero can not be justified for any reason. "
,c_programmer,2010-09-15T20:20Z,"A quick correction to my last comment. A fraction when approaching infinity does not do so at a constant rate, rather a predictable one. An equation can be made to represent the change in the fraction (the derivative of the equation), I misspoke by saying it was constant."
,kenjamen,2010-09-23T10:11Z,"@c_programmer

By your logic:
x=9 & y=6
x=0(inf)=0
y=0(inf)=0
x=0=9 & y=0=6....no.
-------------------------------------
The correct thought is to consider limits.  As the denominator approaches 0 the number approaches inf.  Very common calculus problem.
-------------------------------------
Consider x=1/10.
Now consider x=1/0.1.
Now consider x=1/0.0001.
What I'm getting at is that as the denominator gets smaller, x gets larger and larger until it does in fact approach infinity.  As far as basic math goes this is accepted but possibly not ultimately correct in the universe... that's a question for the Einsteins to figure out."
