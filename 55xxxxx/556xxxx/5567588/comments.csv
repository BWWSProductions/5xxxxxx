,Imansensi,2010-05-18T16:23Z,"Just dl the sample, looks really good!"
,MountainSnake,2010-05-18T16:29Z,Jerky playback.
,n1ck1216,2010-05-18T16:58Z,"This guy is reliable, not need to say this is fake."
,Klysmic,2010-05-20T20:54Z,"Excellent quality, thanks."
,silgt,2010-05-21T11:35Z,Beautiful copy...thank you!!!
,Captain_Planet,2010-05-23T04:35Z,"Excellent quality indeed. However if you are looking for a perfect rip this is not it, as the video is often jittery throughout the film ( though I have only tried it on WMP so far, VLC may not suffer)

Other than that I found this torrent to be fantastic and look forward to actually asitting down and watching it. Thanks Great magican, the kingdom rules."
,Thjald,2010-05-23T21:25Z,Thx ! :)
,XxSTICH666xX,2010-05-24T00:56Z,"Beautiful copy. I've never seen a move this far from actual DVD release, look this good. The video is on par with DVD but the sound is incredible."
,wayawesomer,2010-05-24T23:46Z,"There is jerky playback throughout. Video quality is excellent, but it really kills the actions scenes if they're jittery."
,JackSparrow2007,2010-05-26T23:17Z,"How can you guys say that the video quality is excellent? There's way too much edge-enhancement and it looks quite bad on a bigger screen. I doubt that the original had this amount of haloing. The video is also a bit jerky.

Video quality: 6/10"
,aquarian3,2010-05-27T11:47Z,"I wasn't sure whether to d/l this based on the comments but I'm glad I took the chance, you won't be disappointed either - it's a full film, great picture quality and sound quality is good (tho we had our tv turned up quite high but for a free film is that really a negative?  Easy enough to turn the volume down once the film was finished eh?!).

It's a very funny, action packed film - thanks GreatMagician, your a star!"
,badboy420,2010-05-31T11:58Z,"Why do u complain.

It is stated as a r5 release and not as a DVD rip.

if u want awesome quality wait for a few months & the bluray will be released by secretmyth.

Untill then enjoy this."
,weerab1981,2010-06-10T22:54Z,"best r5 on internet.
