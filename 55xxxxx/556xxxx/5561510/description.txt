         Riley crosses the pond to scale three iconic bridges in the   
         U.K. The famed Tower Bridge in London is being restored,      
         and the lead paint being stripped must be contained. In       
         Scotland, he'll construct scaffolding at the top of           
         the Forth Bridge, a vertigo-inducing 367 feet over the        
         water! Just upriver, he helps implement an experimental       
          technique to prevent a suspension bridge from collapsing.
