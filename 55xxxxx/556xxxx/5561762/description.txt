German Learning Tips
German pronunciation and spelling are regular and predictable.
There are three categories of German nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
German nouns are always capitalized, regardless of where they occur in a sentence. For example: Der Mann lÃ¤uft.
Many verbs have two parts: one part that comes after the subject and one part that comes at the end of the sentence. For example: Der Mann hat einen Apfel gegessen.
The German alphabet contains all the letters of the Roman alphabet and in addition includes the letter ÃŸ.
The vowels in some German words have a mark written above them, a pair of dots called an umlaut Â¨. This mark shows you how to properly pronounce the word, and it may distinguish one word from another, which is identical except for the mark. For example: ein Apfel â€“ zwei Ã„pfel.
German has both formal and informal ways to address others, depending on the age of the speaker and his or her relationship to the person or persons being addressed.
