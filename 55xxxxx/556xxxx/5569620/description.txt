Wikipedia   : When Grace, an elderly woman, wins the "Be So Random! for a Day" contest, the "So Random!" cast ends up planning an "old geezer" sketch that not only offends Grace and her entire retirement home, but all elderly people. Grace and her friends turn the tables and play a practical joke on the cast. Meanwhile, Chad attempts to help a group of kids with their fear of clowns and ends up looking like one himself.
