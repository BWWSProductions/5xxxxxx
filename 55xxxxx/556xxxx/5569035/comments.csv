,_luciferi,2010-05-20T01:47Z,"Quality is Fine.

I highly recommend never ever paying for this movie as it is a chore to watch. There is barely any dialogue.

Some advice for while watching the movie in order to understand it:

The main dude (as in the guy on the cover) dreams about the future so keep that in mind, but still this movie sux ass. The environmental depiction of early America is rather mesmerizing though because America is so industrial now."

I still hate these simple minded asschewers with all my heart that spoiled the end, but this movie is fucking awful terrible bad. Early on its kinda cool and it looks like its gonna be kinda sweet, but then it becomes basically a silent film with a bunch of useless crap going on that u pretty much have to make up what u think is going on. Im focusing all my hatred at Kimkim cuz these other spoilers are just second hand assholes. She came up with the idea 1st u nerdheaded penis handlers!!!

See that image of the DVD cover? See those dudes with shields 'n spears?  NONE of em are in the film...hows that for false advertising hehehe...

the whole 'violence, blood, hell thing is a bit charged and is totally misleading...ok, yeah, theres some violence...and a wee bit of blood...but its an artsy/intellectual take on hell.
I personally enjoyed it, but it is NOT a mainstream movin, so if you're looking for something like the 300, or gladiator or something like that....save your bandwidth for somewhere else...

Perfect quality

I loved the movie, it's great and different. Not hollywood bullshit with over the top action. 

But can someone explain the moral of the movie for me ?
So...One Eye is Wotan/Odin, and sees the future in dreams, right ?
What is the underlying message of this movie, I don't get it. Is it just about the absurdity of Christianity and about the importance of Pagan realism over false beliefs ?

Someone explain their take on the movie ?"
,Probednz,2010-05-24T10:33Z,"Lessons:
1. Don't go on some stupid mission with idiots that don't know where they're going.
2. In a strange land, stay together or close to the main character. You'll live longer.
3. Stay near the boat... if shit starts... get the hell out.
4. and Pointy end of your sword goes in bad guy, not your mates.

I like the main actor, seen him in other movies. Thought this was an art movie, for a bit. Not a fan.

Action Adventure.

SHORT SYNOPSIS

Harald is living a silent and miserable life captured at the chieftain Barde at Katanes in Scotland (around 1000 A.D.). Barde thinks that Harald is set on earth ?only as a gladiator? and forces him to participate in bloody tournaments on which Barde makes a lot of money.

One day Harald finds an old axe head and a slow awakening starts; he wants to get out of his apathetic darkness. By help from the ten-year-old slave Are he succeeds to escape Barde and burns down his farm. Are wants to go home to Norway but Harald still has unfinished business in Scotland ? Bardes son Kenneth whom he also defeats. Among Kenneths belongings Harald finds an amulet, which help him to regain further pieces of his memories ? maybe he can find out where he really comes from and who he really is?
Harald and Are join a group of Norwegian vikings who are going back to Norway to re-conquer the estates they lost when King Olav christened the land.
But in the Northern Sea their ship is attacked by an enormous and continuous storm. They get lost and is brought out from the world they know and into a completely new and strange ? they continent later to be known as America.
Without any possibilities of getting back they start exploring and conquer the unknown. They sail up the river and set out through the swamps and over land.

They meet formidable natives and are confronted with their own madness and are struck by illnesses and unexplainable phenomenons. While the friendship between Harald and Are is strengthened, Harald realizes that not only are they on their way to the ?heart of darkness? but also towards the re-conquest of his own destiny. A heavy darkness has been upon him since he was five years old. Now he can enlighten it if he is just able to kill what on this unbelievable journey has transformed his from animal to human ? what is the prize of humans?"
,NedPickles,2010-05-29T02:28Z,"This is from an interview with the director, Refn, at the end of this summer: 

RS: Can you tell us a little bit about your next project, Valhalla Rising, starring Mads Mikkelsen?

NWR: Valhalla Rising came out of me working on a horror film that I just couldn?t solve. I just got so fed up, that I went back to an old idea I had about the discovery of America by the Vikings and that was suddenly a very easy story for me to develop, and I?ve learned that if it?s easy, go with it, and so I focused completely on that one. It?s going to be about a mute man who doesn?t know where he?s from, and about the Vikings discovering America. But, I?m not a big fan of Vikings, and I?m definitely not a big fan of costume films. So it occurred to me while making Pusher III, and thought, what if I took this way of making a movie and made a film set in the year 800? Once I got the technical concept, and then I got the story down, then I needed the overall view of the story. It?s the discovery of America, so what? It?s science fiction. For the Vikings, it must have been science fiction?it?s Valhalla. And of course I?ve always wanted to do an action film."
,the_law,2010-05-29T22:51Z,"Holy crap, this is the worst film i have seen ever.  The first 45 minutes is a silent film.

,FreeDerry71,2010-06-11T00:28Z,This movie sucks.  It's not what it looks like on the cover. And it's almost a complete rip off of Severed Ways.  
[T],dramacore,2010-06-13T01:13Z,"very enjoyable film. not many things out there like this with fantastic landscapes, and great costume design. there's a bit of CGI but it's for the blood. which i think could have been done better with blood bags or something.  overall this was a pretty awesome somber adventure.  worth checking out if you have interest in this sort of theme, vikings and crusaders and such.

,the_big_lebowski,2010-07-24T00:41Z,"HOLY FUCK-BEANS WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!

if u need a quick synopsis of this film....

its basically, fuck all happens, really fucking slowly, its like the directors have said ""ok guys weve got enough story for 3 minutes or so, lets throw in lots of slow-mo pan shots with faces on the sides, oh and cut the sound on the bits that do have the slightest bit of action, then we only have to spend half the ?6.50 budget on the soundman's wages!"" if your watching this expecting to see any more action than the first scene, just hit stop, find your torrent and delete it, then  be thankful you wont have wasted 90mins of your life watching some raggedy ass actors trudging thru fields or sitting on a boat IN SLOW MOTION!!!

can anyone who had anything to do with the production of this film please find yourself a new job, cos its clear your not too good at this one!!

and finally can whoever designed the cover for this dvd actually watch the film before setting off to work, there is no ""army"" infact i dont think theres a single scene with more than 6-8 people in it, and if there is you can bet your bottom dollar they will be sitting down and the shot will be in slow motion with half the fucking sound missing!

SHIT FILM!!"

The movie reminded me a lot of Aguirre: The Wrath of God.
Beautiful landscapes, great costumes, much time to think. Artistic, really. It's a welcome variety from all those movies where one action sequence chases till there's one big showdown, preferably with a twist.

Perfect for a quiet sunday afternoon."
