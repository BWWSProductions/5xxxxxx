Soundboard Recording

Taken from the liberated bootleg DEMON DRIVE from KING STORK Master Reel Tape - remaster UPGRADE VERSION

[Moderator's note:
The uploader did not provide the required contrast clause to distinguish this from the existing torrent of this show at http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=265595.
However, the two come from different silvers: this one from "Demon Drive" and the other from "Living in the Hell." Both can run as alternatives.]
