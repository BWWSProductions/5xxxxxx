description from
sebaygo1's original release

Bermas is live again today.  This broadcast's first two hours are to focus primarily on Cass Sunstein, 
Obama's "Info-Czar" [Director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs] and his ideas about 
internet regulation and censorship, taxing or outlawing conspiracy theorists, the 2nd Amendment, etc., etc..

In the 3rd hour, Jason talks with Cindy Sheehan.

He also takes a number of calls.
