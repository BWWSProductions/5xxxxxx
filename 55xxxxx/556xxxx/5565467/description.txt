The Crystal Method is an American electronic music duo that was created 
in Los Angeles, California by Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland in the early
1990s. The Crystal Method's music has appeared in numerous TV shows, 
films, video games, and advertisements. Their best-selling album, Vegas,
was certified platinum in 2007. The Crystal Method is made up of two 
members, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland. Both of them were born in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Kirkland was born when his mother was only fifteen. He grew up 
listening to his mother's musicâ€”discoâ€”and his father's musicâ€”rock. When he
had grown a little older, he began listening to Heavy metal, as well as
bands like Depeche Mode. Ken Jordan also grew up listening to classic rock 
and '80s electronic as well. By the early '90s, both Ken and Scott had moved
to Los Angeles. Before The Crystal Method was formed, Ken and Scott started
working on music while working at the grocery store and while Ken was a 
local DJ in Las Vegas
