Continue your kick ass werk"
,subversivelemming,2010-05-20T17:08Z,"SpandauBaby, I must give you the greatest of thanks for my repeated appreciation of every single Prog/Kraut... collections youve composed.
I have found things that I almost had given up hope finding over the years of looking n seen other things tht I listen to regularly. You are indeed a welcomed kindred spirit in your appreciation of music n kindly sharing it all with us.
This is absolutely awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,gearofwar,2010-05-22T15:47Z,"Yay, all hail SB! 1 seeder to 1298 leechers, can't wait til it's done so I can start helping you distribute!

P.S. Have you heard (of) a band called Skywhale? Based in Bristol, UK (my hometown) they produced just one amazing album in 1977 of beautiful uplifting fusion music, not dissimilar to Kenso. It's in FLAC form here:

Check it out, you might find it worthy of inclusion in your ""S"" collection! If you'd rather have it in MP3, let me know and I'll gladly upload my own copy."
,vandergraaf100,2010-05-22T18:56Z,Thanks gearsofwar Im on it!
,vanmanu,2010-05-23T23:39Z,AsI said before Spandaubaby you're a god for me thx for your great job . I love Miriodor's music . 
,dagseoul,2010-05-25T10:44Z,"thanks again.  the first 13 were great.  these 3 look promising.

as always, the music is appreciated.  but you get extra love for properly tagging everything.  man it's so cool you do that.  ^^"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-25T22:19Z,"I'm so glad that you're all getting these lovely files :-)  Enjoy these very much, I've still got a fair bit to go yet, like this section S and T section will also be fairly big which is another couple of hurdles that I have to get over yet.  I just need to get loads of uploading finished and then it's off to the next one, I've kind of started N but haven't done all that much yet.  N won't be massive but then there's O and P and Q after so there's more bands coming.

This collection is gonna be really quite something when it's all finished, I just hope that people can keep the early ones still seeded incase new people come along and download it all.  Almost 60 gigs now I have put together.  I think if people can still seed them at least then new ones I can concentrate on getting them uploaded when I do them."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-27T05:41Z,"@vandergraaf100: Hey vandergraaf, won't be too long before I have N section up.  It shouldn't take too long, I haven't forgotten about putting that Nirvana album up for you.  It's on it's way just as soon as I can sort them out properly and get all the tags done and make sure the album covers are sorted out also.  I just really need to get them converted into MP3 ready for the next lot.

I haven't had much chance to work on it today because I have been busy sorting stuff out, I have had to upload masses of torrents just recently to get some of my new ones going but they're up, took me just over 2 weeks worth of uploading to get my music videos torrents going.  I had to get myself a new drive the other day cos this one was full so I've put that in now to give me extra room for uploading new stuff.

It is good now, I have lots of time on my hands, I have now finished college and that's it I have done.  I don't need to do any of that anymore so it means I can really get the last lot for the collection done.  It'll be pretty cool once I get them all finished.  I've been listening to a lot of these albums now since I first started these back in October 2009.  Just wow, some of this music is amazing!  I really do especially like the King Crimson stuff though, they're music is awesome, I think it's some of my favourite.

Wait till I get to Vandergraaf haha!  They will be coming also..."
,vandergraaf100,2010-05-27T11:31Z,Thanks SB been seeding for a couple of days now so have had a chance to play some of it! Never heard the band Man before but Im a bit of a fan now!  Also good to hear more stuff from the manfreds!  Thanks again SB!

,trd1587,2010-06-03T20:36Z,"I'm excited, and I hope you guys get all the parts of the collection.

After This is all done. We all toghether should do an ""add-on"" with Albums we think SpadauBaby ommited and should be in this great collection.

I'm Thinking just right now of a group named ""Archive"" and Anekdoten wich were missing in ""A"" . 

Be Sure that this comment does'nt discredit SpandauBaby at all. Nice F""/""$""$/ing Work Man.


PS: Early albums of King Crimsons are considerated as ""Chef d'oeuvres"" ( In the court of the krimson King"" is one of a kind. Thanks to the Mellotron! Lol

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-06-06T21:56Z,"Hiya peeps, hope you're all enjoying these latest albums.  Regret to inform you all that I have encountered a problem at the moment in the place where I am living.  My neighbour has got issues and it's a serious problem so I have had to make arrangements to move ship.  I do apologise about this, my neighbour is the one to blame he is a total wacko.  Once I get this problem sorted out I shall let you know, it's a dam shame I was getting N completed almost and had to shutdown my little operation.

Hopefully it won't take too long, I will carry on with these when the day comes that I can continue my Prog Rock saga.  So annoying but there's nothing much I can do.

Didn't want you guys to think I'd given up (which I won't) I'll get this whole thing finished one day.  Peace for now from SB!"
,subversivelemming,2010-06-07T14:48Z,"Happily awaiting to see n hear what you have up n coming for the remnder of the alphabit!!!!

Your selection of musicians that you appreciate is fantastic!"
,subversivelemming,2010-06-07T14:53Z,"Just read you notice about having to move due to neighbor.
Hope you find a space for yourself that really compliments you in everything you love having within n doing in your own home.....
Its essential Ive found..as Im nocturnal n a prog musicn for years myself.
I love living in nature but near enough to a city where prog music, avant arts of all sorts are happening. I love space to be n live as I desire.
Really we all deserve it."
,subversivelemming,2010-06-07T14:55Z,"Sorry to hear about your neighbor.
Hope that you find an incredably wonderful new space to live where you can have, do n be who you need to be to be happy!"
,vandergraaf100,2010-06-08T18:13Z,Sorry to hear that SB! You let us know where your neighbour is and me and my fellow progsters on PB will pay him a visit!
,grubtrot,2010-06-09T13:21Z,I think about you daily while I listen to music
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-06-10T00:06Z,"I can't tell you the exact details of what happened but I can tell you that the Police came down to see what was going on.  Also he (my neighbour) was threatening me with violence, this guy who I'm talking about is a complete nutcase.  I was glad when the Police did arrive as he was quite scary to deal with, this guy was once in the military police, he decided that he would threaten me with violence when I hadn't even done anything to him.  It was all something he had created in his head.  Anyway I can relax more now about it because I am making plans to move very soon, I have to get away from this creepy neighbour because everytime I see him now I feel some what disturbed by his presence."
,subversivelemming,2010-06-10T18:01Z,"Protect yourself,
your belongings n yourself from anything the nutcase might conjure up to do.
Better to use preventive medicine then be assualted with having to cure things when sht has hit the fan."
,gearofwar,2010-06-10T18:47Z,"I'm sorry to hear about all that!
Good luck in the move SB, you have my support and best wishes."
,Prog_Dog,2010-06-15T17:03Z,"Dear SpandauBaby, thanks so much for sharing a wealth of incredible art. It is interesting to discover so many facets of a gem and to find the treasure trove yielding in waves...Bravo!"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-01T06:32Z,"You finally got your Skull, Soz i missed the Party..
Keep up the good work my old friend.. :))
and your neighbour sounds like a C#cksucker! "
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T01:36Z,"This is SpandauBaby here, I am sorry to say that TPB has gone very weird and I have lost my account now.  I cannot log into it anymore and I can't complete the collection I've been making grrrrr"
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T01:38Z,"It's not fair, I've worked really hard to make the torrents I have so far and now I can't even access it anymore.  TPB is all messed up, I feel like ditching this place now and going somewhere else and starting again because this site is knackered.

:-("
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T23:34Z,"Greetings my friends.  This is SpandauBaby again.  I am back now.  I am sorry to say that I am now leaving PirateBay and I've headed over to Demonoid instead with this Prog Rock Collection.  For those people who were seeding my collection parts 1 to 16 please hop over to Demonoid as soon as you can where I am there hosting the files again.  I urgently need your help to seed it as I've had to move to Demonoid because PirateBay has messed up and I can't access my SpandauBaby account anymore, you need to take the files on your computers and seed them there instead."
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T23:36Z,It's a fairly simple process to delete the torrent from your client and then download the new torrent file over on Demonoid and then just point the directories for each one to the existing folder for that torrent.
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T23:37Z,"The files are just the same.  They are in my new name on there called ""OddZod"""
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T23:38Z,"I have had no choice but to move to Demonoid now, I think this is the best decision at this point.  I hope you can all follow me over there and help to keep the Prog Rock Collection alive over there.  I just need lots of help to get it going again.  I shall look forward to seeing more of you sharing the full seed for each part of this."
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-25T23:38Z,"All the best, SpandauBaby.

(Dam, this site is all messed up really bad, having trouble writing comments!)"
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-07-26T21:17Z,Part 17 is now available over on Demonoid.  Please please please come and help me seed this collection over there...  thanks

I have been trying to get into Demonoid for over a year+ n NEVER have gotten a chance.
Sad to say I wont be able to access your great torrents ever again."
