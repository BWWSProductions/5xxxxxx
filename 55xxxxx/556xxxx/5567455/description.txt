White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen was locked in a secure room and given access to the most sensitive intelligence when he was tasked to write President George W. Bushâ€™s 2006 speech explaining the CIAâ€™s interrogation program and why Congress should authorize it. Few know more about these CIA operations than Thiessen, and in his new book, Courting Disaster, he documents just how effective the CIAâ€™s interrogations were in foiling attacks on America, penetrating al-Qaedaâ€™s high command, and providing our military with actionable intelligence. Thiessen also shows how reckless President Obama has been in shutting down the CIAâ€™s program and releasing secret documents that have aided our enemies. Courting Disaster proves:

How the CIA program thwarted specific deadly attacks against the U.S.
Why â€œenhanced interrogationâ€ was not torture by any reasonable legal or moral standard
How the information gained by â€œenhanced interrogationâ€ could not have been acquired any other way
How President Obamaâ€™s actions since taking office have left America much more vulnerable to attack

In chilling detail, Thiessen reveals how close the terrorists came to striking again, how intelligence gained from â€œenhanced interrogationâ€ repeatedly stymied their plots, and how President Obamaâ€™s dismantling of this CIA program is inviting disaster for America.
