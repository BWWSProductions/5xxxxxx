,hkoraddi,2010-05-18T21:07Z,hi i'm seeding file on demenoid do i need to add this tracker?
,madtown4,2010-05-18T21:37Z,hey pb is back . wow that other site people are just not knowing how great your uploads are. thanks for what you do.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-18T21:47Z,"@hkoraddi: I think you should left all as is. That's why all my torrent have neutral trackers beside TPB pair or demonoid one. Members of demonoid can connect through their tracker, and people here have on disposal aforementioned public trackers...

And we ALL have trackerless DHT, if one haven't deliberately turned DHT off."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-18T21:58Z,"@madtown: Well, this place have issues too... but honestly, no one can compare TPB with anything. Jesus, I have 12 seeders on Desperate Housewives - 86 downloads... and here, usually thousand of downloads. ""24"" had (I should laugh) - 103 altogether, whole day! That place kooks dead compared with this pithole. Huge pit hole."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-18T22:00Z,"kooks = look as

LOL... almost correct."

And good for emergencies.

,drs1982,2010-05-18T23:42Z,is this any good what is it? ive watched all of season two of this top show is this any good?
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T08:13Z,@drs1982: Honestly - no. Only reason why I have encoded is simple: version that appeared today was 1.09 GIGA .mkv... and I felt obligated somehow to save few nickles for fans of TB.
