I don't understand what you are talking about lol sorry there mate.  Kind of confusing to me.  I hope DJFred does get these DVDs.  They're all really good after all those movies that he has uploaded recently this kind of thing makes a nice change to all those action/thriller/adventure/horror and everything else kind of films he has been uploading for us.

If DJFred hasn't got these then hopefully he might wanna download them from my torrent.  There's something very special about this mountain and just how dangerous it is to go up there to the top.  One mistake is all it would take for you to topple all the way to the bottom and never seen anybody again!

So anyway if anybody does see this torrent then don't miss these, they're awesome especially the real everest climbers.  I was hoping that this torrent would be more popular because seriously nobody has put these films up before in DVD format.  The IMAX one is also good but lots of people have already shared it.

I thought about it for a while and decided that these 3 DVDs would make an excellent colletion to upload but please if anybody knows of any more recent ones that are also very good like these please let me know which ones they are as I might buy them myself."
