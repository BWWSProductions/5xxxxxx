This torrent will help you softmod your PSP. I have taken the liberty of downloading everything that you need for you. I have organized it in such a way that the chance of failure is almost nil. This guide includes both how to use a Pandora battery, and a magic memory stick creator, as well as the ChickHEN method which I have left no stone unturned to describe in detail, leaving this guide almost fool proof. If you have a firmware that is greater than 5.03 and you have no intention of buying a Pandora Battery, then you might as well skip this torrent. Please seed as much as you can to give others the chance to know the glory that is custom firmware. If this guide has helped you, then please comment on your success. If you have any questions, then ask me on mychannel. Myprofile name is Disbuylshite. I am going to upload a video tutorial to this torrent very soon.

Edit:Hey guys, I made a mistake. On the Gen D3 installation, you must rename the "500.PBP" file on the root of the memory stick to "550.PBP"
