,seedammit,2010-05-16T20:08Z,"Man thank you very much, I've downloaded a dozen games now that I was missing in  my collection, this is an incredible upload. I just realised it's size: 80Gig- wow, someone that just got a PSP and is starting to download games for it won't need much more than this.

Thank you again!"

,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-09-10T19:21Z,I thought about doing this except that I got 225 + iso/cso's alone like double this size but it would take to long th ever upload it all.

,jmda91,2012-05-18T04:17Z,2 Obstacles I have from completely downloading this. It won't fit in the HDD (just 160 GBs) and I'll max out the data cap of 40 GB every month. :(
,jmda91,2012-05-18T04:54Z,I'll come back here when there are at least 50 seeders.
