,storm919,2010-06-17T19:51Z,so i have the original version of mw2 and if i get banned i will go and download 1 from the mw2 games in this site.. (should i do that?)
,storm919,2010-06-17T22:15Z,"i open the game after all this progress and it says : cheat detected, and closes lol help?"
,kissofd3th,2010-07-06T23:48Z,if it says cheat detected then you are fucked. especially if you are using a real steam account and a real mw2 serial. if it says cheat detected that means you are banned forever. they will never un-ban that account. you will have to buy a new mw2 and register it on a new steam account.
