,rabbit2003,2010-06-17T19:42Z,yo for real guys you need to check on IMDB.com some times...... there are only 21 eps in season 9
,gkb42,2010-07-08T21:06Z,please seed. my vuze says theres only 39 seeders. and the season is taking ages to download.
,RivieraDude,2010-09-08T04:06Z,"If you bother to check it out before annoying the UL you should notice that episode 11 is a very big episode, it could be counted as a double episode 11-12, continue counting from there and you will get 22 episodes in all.
OR just accept that there is 21 episodes with a long episode 11, anyway it is a complete season 9.

This episode was originally conceived as two separate episodes, but the CW budgeted extra money, promoted, and aired it as a single two-hour movie event. The two episodes would have been titled ""Society"" and ""Legends"". Due to this change, this is the first, and so far only episode to have two words in its name instead of one."
