,umim,2010-05-25T00:43Z,"Eli60, Take your daily pills. Do not skip it."
,umim,2010-05-25T16:03Z,"There is a typo in my comment. It should be:...""after reaching 100% download, just vanished""...Now it is makes some sense..."
,inginsh,2010-05-28T19:20Z,"I have installed it from Windows XP and I don't know, why I havn't seen the menu where I can choose which version I need??? Automatically t installs -32 bit version... Can anyone help ASAP???"
,umim,2010-06-02T01:26Z,"During the installation, in certain moment, you have to ""choose"" CUSTOM! Then you'll be able to install 32 or 64 bit version."
,chrismbo,2010-06-17T00:28Z,"Hi, I have downloaded, burnt the iso onto a DVD and succesfully installed on my Toshiba laptop.

My question is, since this is activated, does that mean I can download and install windows updates?

Thanks."
,umim,2010-06-26T00:50Z,"Yes, you can."
,umim,2010-07-21T19:34Z,"One important update: You can legally update this version, BUT... always remove ""Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool"" from update. This SUCKER is running constantly on your machine, removing all cracks/patches/keygens and preventing installation/use of all of them. ALSO: NEVER download/update ""Windows Genuine Advantage Validation Tool"" especially this one: KB 892130. It can f**k your activation.
BTW I'm using Acronis to make WHOLE drive/partition backup. If something happened (you never know) using that backup return me ""back in the business"" in matter of minutes! "
,dianenchester,2010-08-06T19:48Z,"This is probably a stupid question but I have Windows Vista - when I download Windows 7, what do I do about the Windows Vista? Or, will it automatically replace it? Thanks, dianenchester"
,Van_Zemljak,2010-08-12T14:30Z,this is 64 & 86 bit version ...no 32
[V],thethingy,2010-08-13T22:23Z,"Installed, IT IS NOT ACTIVATED!!! Just another BS. Do not bother to download. "
,umim,2010-09-28T18:33Z,IT IS ACTIVATED AND INSIDE THAT DVD ARE BOTH : X86 AND X64 VERSIONS OF WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE!!!
,umim,2010-09-28T18:36Z,VAN ZEMLJAK: X86 means - X32!!! DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE ASKING TRIVIAL QUESTION.
[V],thethingy,2010-10-01T21:59Z,"tried this again, IT IS NOT ACTIVATED!!! Just another BS. Do not bother to download. "
,umim,2010-10-02T22:49Z,"thetingy, do not skip your daily pills. Without them, your brain will not work. It looks like you are skipping them frequently.....
Everybody can try this download and tell you about your pills skipping....I""m right, you are wrong and moron."
