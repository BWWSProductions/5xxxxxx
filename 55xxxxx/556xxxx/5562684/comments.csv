Have a safe weekend, everyone :)

@Barry - Beck's podcast and daily tv show download are as important (to the wife and I) as is Limbaugh's daily podcast...

We've been archiving both men's programmes several months now. While we can that is...

@tobalaki: if you have a problem with Limbaugh, I'd be curious to know what it is.

""Truth has its own attraction"" That's why people appreciate Beck and Limbaugh."

The message MUST get out & we are all thankfull that you take the time to do it. Rock On! Hope to see someone get new Jerry Doyle and Michael savage shows posted someday as well."
