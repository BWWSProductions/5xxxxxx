One of the all time great film made in malayalam film industry. Its a unique Suspense, Horror, comedy, drama which is aptly directed by Fazil & with the support of other great directors like Priyadarshan. The latter has made an hindi version of the movie, Bhool Bhulayya; but failed to keep up to the original. The acting is superb by the whole cast including Mohanlal & Shobana..
I have ripped the original dvd with english subtitle so that non-malayali audience can enjoy the movie. Hope it wont disturb the viewing experience.
Thanks
