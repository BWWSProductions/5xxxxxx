,DustyBtmz,2010-05-16T14:43Z,"This is the actual Dark Island. Not fake.
A fair ""B"" formula popcorn flick.

I didn't notice the pixilation to which Notfat is referring. It doesn't mean it isn't there, but it must have been very brief.
Audio was fine.

The plot is satisfactory but not horribly original, but then, what is these days?
The acting was slightly better than the script.

I really don't see what the fuss is about.

Perhaps forcing myself to sit through Birdemic has damaged my sensibilities, but this wasn't horrible. I'd watch it again if I was strapped to a chair and had my eyelids taped open."
