One of the most astute followers of bebop titan Charlie Parker was and still remains alto (and tenor) saxophonist Sonny Stitt. One of the most popular acolytes of Art Tatum (possibly the most incredible pianist ever) was and remains Oscar Peterson. Put them together and you have the makings of a classy, enduring, and simmering session of straight-ahead jazz. 

Recorded in 1957 and '59, features bass ace Ray Brown and the superb swing/bop guitarist Herb Ellis. All are modern jazz masters with a thorough grounding in the verities of swing.
