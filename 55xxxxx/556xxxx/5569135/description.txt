Written to accompany the long awaited  Fender 'David Gilmour Signature Stratocaster Guitar'.


The Black Strat book tells the official chronological story of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmourâ€™s favourite legendary Black Stratocaster from 1970 to the present.


Written by Phil Taylor - Davidâ€™s personal guitar technician and the bandâ€™s chief backline tech since 1974 - the only person to know Pink Floydâ€™s equipment better than the band themselves.


Davidâ€™s Black Strat featured on Pink Floyd tours and iconic albums including Meddle, Atom Heart Mother, Obscured By Clouds, The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall. It was also used on Davidâ€™s solo projects: David Gilmour, About Face and On An Island.


It can be seen in the film Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii, at the 2005 Live 8 Pink Floyd reunion and on Davidâ€™s Remember That Night and Live in Gdansk dvdâ€™s
