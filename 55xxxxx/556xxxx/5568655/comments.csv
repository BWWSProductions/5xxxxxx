,crudmax,2010-12-15T08:26Z,"""Love for All and Sharing is the first step to solving all the problems of humanity""... mmmm 

Theres a problem with this sloppy sentimental nonsense (apart from the fact that it is sloppy snotimental nonsense) .... this isnt sharing - Its theft.
Hey, dont get me wrong, Im stealing too - but I know I am and Im not deluding myself about it nor  amd I trying to flog a religion which would not at all agree with this form of proselytizing. Im pretty sure old Sidharta would not agree at all. Not one little bit.
Im sure ""everyone involved in the production"" will be delighted with your saccharine drivel, especially since they have zero financial interest.

Thanks for the up anyways..... just keep your religion to yourself.
