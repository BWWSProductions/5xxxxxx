Set in New York City, this compelling drama about a young graffiti artist 
highlights the risky--sometimes life-threatening--nature of such a pursuit. 
Director Adam Bhala Lough casts the talented young actor Mark Webber (DEAR WENDY) 
as Blest, a graffiti artist the NYPD is desperate to catch. Blest roams the 
New York streets, spraying graffiti wherever he can and dodging angry shop 
owners as he steals spray paint from hardware stores. The art world tugs at 
Blest's sleeve as he slowly makes a name for himself, with several galleries 
interested in displaying his work, but he has more pressing concerns as one 
of his gang, Lune (Jade Yorker), winds up in jail. Discovering Lune has been 
badly beaten by the cops, Blest instructs his gang to cover the city with 
graffiti, starting a deadly running battle with the cops. A movie that 
highlights how difficult it is for many youngsters to escape the impoverished 
backgrounds they grew up in, Lough's film is also an interesting look at graffiti 
culture and the talented characters who love to decorate New York with their work.

Notes: SCUM is back to m4v. The reason for this re-up is because the first one we put up
was a much lower VBR and ABR and was only one file. This is a completely new 
re-encode with higher everything and a nice split file for ya. Enjoy and 
keep it SCUM.
