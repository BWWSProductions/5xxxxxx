,inianlion,2010-05-15T20:12Z,"He/She credited the original uploader.
Since blackjesus is not uploading on piratebay this guy is sharing here, so nothing wrong."
,inianlion,2010-05-15T20:15Z,If blackjesus started uploading here johnnyrep will be correct DibyaTPB.
[M],vicerock,2010-05-15T21:17Z,"how can people say that DibyaTPB is stealing this torrent he has,nt taged it as his own he is doing wot every uploader does uploading torrents the only time its classed as stealing is when you retag the torrent like renameing it with you,re own name people this is how we all share files it seems to me like theres a lot of people who just have,nt got a clue today "
[V],DibyaTPB,2010-05-15T22:58Z,"Everytime uploaders like blackjesus or noir uploads there is someone who uploads there torrents here and this time its me. So there is no wrong. Also i am not editing the tag or anything. So i m doing no mistakes rather than i am helping the torrrents to get a more good health.

@vice thnx for your support m8."
