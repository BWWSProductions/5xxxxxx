,Dantheman420,2010-05-17T10:09Z,"we'll see wats up..... i tried one of these guys torrents b4, and even though EZTV didnt upload it first, his speeds were allot higher, faster

........ it could have nothing to do with him laggin at all, he could just be on the west cost, and have a 3 hr time delay in his seeds"
