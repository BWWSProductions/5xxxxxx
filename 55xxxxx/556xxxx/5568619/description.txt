--About The Movie--

After Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life, she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family. However, a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed, a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens, who decide to leave the town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Initially heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits.  {Written by IMDb Editors} 


--Other Stuff--
This movie does NOT play correctly in some versions of MPC.  It works in Windows Media Player and VLC. My rip doesn't have motion grain or smears, but it will look muddy if you blow it up big on your HDTV.  I tried to achieve a balance between quality and size with this rip, And I think that it is better than ones I've made before.  If you have any tips regarding ripping protected DVDs, please comment.  My composite video encoder PVR card doesn't support high resolution video, but I want to make better rips.  I couldn't rip this one and many other new ones with VLC because of this protection.
