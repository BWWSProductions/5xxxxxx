,blueboy7948,2010-05-30T13:50Z,"love the 'rest in peace' comments then you rip him off and download it for free. Might as well steal the flowers from his grave
Irony is a wonderful thing."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2010-07-02T19:58Z,"You make an excellent point Mr. Blueboy, but we've been through this before. Open up any Michael Jackson torrent and you'll see the exact same thing. ""We love you Michael, but we'll happily steal your music."""
,Kelbin,2010-07-28T00:54Z,lol Blueboy you are so full of shit.  We can't steal from him because sadly he is dead.  The only people we could possibly be stealing from is the lowlife leeches that are left behind.
