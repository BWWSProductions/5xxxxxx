,Ruby_pirate,2011-04-14T03:29Z,"Thanks a lot for the trilogy you uploaded and for seeding :):)
The quality is very good on all 3 Rush hour, but on Rush Hour 3 the frame is to wide.. even if I crop it it doesn't look good :S.
Anyway thanks a lot for providing this torrent to us!"
,vivatpb5776,2011-06-14T21:52Z,Very bad encoding on this .torrent. The encoding for RH3 was worst than any. The other two are definitely not encoded correctly but they are passable. The resolution (720*304) is not large enough to stream to a larger television.
