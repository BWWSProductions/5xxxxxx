,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T14:34Z,"@thethingy... I've already got After Effects CS4 and I don't really need Premiere Pro. Can I keep After Effects installed and just un-tick CS5 when installing your master collection or do I need to un-install my after effects and install this version. Also, I'm pretty sure I had Vista 64 bit installed before but when I installed windows 7 (not your torrent) I'm now on 32 bit. I don't know if it was just because it was a early torrent or what... If I downloaded your Windows 7 All Versions 64-bit torrent could I upgrade my Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit to windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit? Thanks."
,hameerabbasi,2010-05-16T14:41Z,"@thethingy:
desperately waiting for your retail Adobe MC CS5 upload."
[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T14:42Z,"CTFxCFTW, my windows 7 upgrades so yes you can

if you have 64 bit windows then best thing to do is get rid off all CS4 apps and use CS5.

if you have 32 bit windows then leave after effects & premiere pro CS4 installed (if you have them) and install CS5 mc, if you dont have premiere pro cs4 / after effects cs4 then use this download with mc.

You can still keep every CS4 app and install CS5 side by side if you want, but you are just duplicating things :)"
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T15:27Z,"@thethingy Brilliant. I was just going to keep After Effects CS4 installed but it doesn't matter then. so you mean if I was to download windows 7 64 bit and put it onto a system with 32 bit already installed, I'd be able to upgrade and keep all my settings and stuff saved?"
[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T15:31Z,"CTFxCFTW, yes if you have vista 64 download my 7 64 and you can upgrade and keep all your apps and settings and things.

if you have vista 32 download my 7 32 and you can do the same :)

you can upgrade 32 to 64 though"
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T15:32Z,"@Kraken Please, go crawl back into your corner and die. Nobody likes a troll. I've downloaded quite a few torrents from thethingy and they've all worked perfectly. He's like what axxo was to movies. Always has the newest releases and they're always top-quality. He's good enough to reply to people like me, constantly asking questions, which is something that most uploaders don't do. He shouldn't have to waste time on fags like you."
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T15:34Z,Nah I mean I've already got windows 7. It's just 32 bit though not 64. What I'm asking is if you can upgrade from one windows 7 version to another. Thanks.
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T15:39Z,"That's weird, my comment didn't save. Erm yeah what I meant was can you upgrade from one windows 7 version to another."
[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T15:40Z,"CTFxCFTW, no you cant upgrade 32 to 64, you can of course upgrade 32 bit home premium to 32bit ultimate for example.

if you want to change to 64 then use windows easy transfer to create a file with all your settings and files on it then do a clean install of 64 and reinstall your apps then run the easy transfer file to put back your files and settings.

or create another partition and install 64 bit there then use easybcd to dual boot till you know what one you like the best, if you have less than 3gb memory then id leave 64bit alone"
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T15:43Z,"Thanks, never thought about using that. Yeah I've only got 2 Gigs of ram but I'm going to get another 2 Gigs soon so I might as well. I'll download it once the CS5 collection is finished. Thanks for the help."
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T15:54Z,I know I should probably post this on your other torrent but I thought it would make more sense continuing on this one. You know that Windows 7 activator you posted... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5140605/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_7_ACTIVATORS__KB971033_SAFE Well I heard a while ago that windows would check with Microsoft every three months to check that it is genuine. Do you think the crack can be patched? The reason I un-installed vista last time was because of an update. The activator was working fine and I was recieving updates until one day when it found out it was cracked.
[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T15:58Z,"CTFxCFTW, them ones are all good with the 3 month check, the 3 month check is KB971033 update.

to be doubly sure just add this to your hosts file;

,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T16:39Z,"Cool, that sounds easy enough. I'm surprised Virgin haven't banned me :) Ah've downloaded over 30Gigs this month. They must know I'm using torrents by now..."
[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T16:49Z,"^^^ they know your using torrents (unless you turn encription on) but they dont know what you are torrenting, if you are in the UK get this;

as the UK law changes next month and virgin will ban access to pirate bay and every other website that does torrents"
,CTFxCFTW,2010-05-16T17:10Z,WOAH! Glad you told me that! Erm yeah I've heard different things from different people. Do I put encryption to Forced or enabled? Right now I've got it on Forced... And should I have allow incoming legacy connections unchecked cause I have it ticked but some people say to untick it? How do you learn this stuff :P So I'm guessing Ipredator will let me on blocked sites then?
[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T17:18Z,"CTFxCFTW, force encription and dont allow legacy conections.

ipredator will let you do whatever you want anonamously, you dont need encription with ipredator running :)"

[V],thethingy,2010-05-16T21:14Z,"DooFoss, the support is actually the full versions of after effects and premiere pro cs4, so its not really support at all but they call it that its just after effects and premiere pro on the same installer.

32 bit apps do work on 64 you know :)"
,DooFoss,2010-05-16T21:20Z,This is the fourth time I've asked so please answer. Is this the Disc or Electronic Download. Need to know so I can try and solve this. Everything on Adobe support refers to Disc or Electronic Download so which is it?

It won't let me enter the serial, so I install as a trial as directed, but when I start the program it says 'Licensing for this Product has Expired'. I haven't even entered a license at this point.

Anyone else had this problem? Any suggestions?"

If you have any licence issues with this then download this; 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5323279
and in the dll folder thats extracted copy the adobelm.dll file and replace each one in the CS5 support apps folders (CS4 After Effects etc) then restart the apps.
If that fails do the licence expired steps in the Adobe Licence Recovery folder.If that fails do the Licensing for this product has stoped working steps in the
instructions.If you still get errors then check your hosts file is set correctly."
,duel,2010-05-25T22:05Z,"Phew! What a mission, but finally success. Thanks for spelling it out for me.

ignore all those haters, if they know best as they claim than they would have their own torrent or wouldn't be here.

Second thing is, i have installed this so that surely means no need to think installing AEF CS5 would now be supported because this ""ADOBE CS5 32 BIT SUPPORT PACKAGE"" is sort of already the  After Effects CS5 version for Windows 32bit system right? That is if i understood all this right.

And for the last part. I aappreciate  your effort very much and keep up the good work and just ignore the ""HATERS"". 
Will be looking forward to more of your uploads.

My sound external cart, is ?E-MU 1616M, no cpu load/3.ms.latency time, maybe its better for PR/AE, than the pc.sound cart ?
PR/AE find asio !, try insert some music VST, in AE vst folder.
On my nr.2 partion I have 49.gb. music softvare running on a clean installation, tweaked a lot, nothing to interrupt realtime rendering, no net/antivirus/ect.

,grebbly,2010-07-19T10:16Z,"Hi thethingy,

thanks for the upload. I'm having some troubles though.

The serial didn't work for me initially so i loaded the 30 day trial and then the serial was accepted. However, when i went to open premiere pro CS4 an error box came up saying it had expired.
So, I followed all your instructions very carefully from the cleaninstall and error toolkit (changing hosts file, licence recovery methods, replacing dlls etc) but I now get an official adobe error box saying to contact adobe support or the IT admin and mention error 6.

Do you have any ideas? thanks - i'm new to this so appreciate it."

I recently downloaded two of your torrents (Adobe Acrobat 9.32 Pro Extended and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended) and they both installed and work perfectly. As always, thank you for the great uploads.

My question is: Can I still download this support package (or the Adobe Premiere CS4) with the previously mentioned Adobe software on my computer already? I'm only asking because this torrent contains outdated CS4 versions of the CS5 versions that I've installed through the other torrents. If this is possible, then what steps would I need to take before I download this (if any) so that the programs from this torrent do not interfere with the ones from the CS5 products?"

1) This is a retail version (autoplay does not work because it just doesn't).

2) Copy & paste the hosts file to replace your own.

3) Install as trial then enter serial on first launch.

4) Copy the dll file and replace each of your own ones, use Windows search to be sure you have found them all. 

5) Any errors then treat this application as CS4 stuff and use this;

4. Set the date back a couple of years, I set it to 2004.
