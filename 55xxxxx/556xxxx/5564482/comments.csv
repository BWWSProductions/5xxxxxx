,ocyrus70,2010-06-07T00:10Z,run tnod and i have a license for 6days and the point of tnod is please..is it to give you a crack thats less time than a trail from the vendor!!..
,EnragedPlatypus,2011-03-10T12:06Z,"@ocyrus07, Actually the point of TNod is to ensure that you always have a working serial. If it can find one that lasts you a year, it'll use it but sometimes they're not available.

What's more important, that you have a long lasting serial that could be locked out by ESET at a moments notice, or that TNod ensures that you stay protected no matter how many keys they lock out?"
,Is4lip,2011-05-14T03:38Z,"Looks legit so far. I'm downloading right now. I'll report in a few minutes/hours. We need more seeds, but so far good. "
