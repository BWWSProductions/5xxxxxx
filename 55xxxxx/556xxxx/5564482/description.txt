Self defense prevents malware from degrading your level of protection
Tiny signature updates happen discretely as needed and won't bog down your system

Key Features
Smarter Scanner â€“ Threats don't always enter in ways you expect. 
ESET Smart Security inspects SSL-encrypted communication channels 
like HTTPS and POP3S, and intelligently scans compressed files to find threats 
that other products miss. ESET's Smart Optimization feature makes file scanning faster than ever.
Time-saving Firewall â€“ New Learning Mode saves time by automatically creating firewall rules 
by observing how end users use the network, while offering advanced firewall modes for power users. 
Pair customized firewall profiles with trusted network zones and have appropriate firewall rules 
applied automatically based on detected network presence.
Trusted Zone Authentication â€“ Identify trusted network zones by network configurations 
(a configurable combination of host/DNS/DHCP server IP address, wireless SSID, 
connection profile, etc) or securely authenticate into a network using ESET Authentication Server.
Upgraded Antispam â€“ ESET Smart Security now takes care of annoying spam with a smaller, 
faster, and even more effective spam filter.
Removable Media Security â€“ Threats can enter your PC from removable media such as USB thumb drives. 
For self-running media, ESET Smart Security scans autorun.inf and associated files when the medium is inserted, 
in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed, or during a full-scan of the media.
System Tools â€“ ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosing and cleaning of infected systems 
by allowing deep scans of system processes to find hidden threats, 
and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.
Self Defense â€“ ESET Smart Security has built-in technology to prevent malicious software 
from corrupting or disabling it, so you can rest assured your system is always protected.
