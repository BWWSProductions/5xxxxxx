[T],PeteSapai,2010-05-19T00:08Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD:
The bin file cant be mounted, you have to install it with the included exe (so no, that wasnt the crack).
The install shield is very unclear: it contains lots of weird characters. The only reason I could install it, is because its layout is quite generic.
Then when I try to start the game I immediately get this error message: ""RocketKnight_ConfigTool has encountered a problem ..."" The game can't be loaded.
Therefore I recommend DON'T DOWNLOAD"

,IZZY-E,2010-06-04T06:39Z,Good and very easy install. I don't know why everyone else is struggling i installed and then just played right away. It was as simple as that. But my computer sucks so I can't play the game anyway. Still good torrent!
,nefisto,2010-07-05T19:55Z,Works perfectly. Very nice game. Thanks Dibya.
