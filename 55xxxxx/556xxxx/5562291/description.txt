In anticipation of the new A-Team movie IDW Publishing have published two comic book series that act as prequels to the upcoming action-adventure from Twentieth Century Fox.


The A-Team: War Stories
Each issue focuses on a different member of the team, offering details of their Desert Storm adventures as Army Rangers before each joins The A-Team. 
Written by Chuck Dixon and Erik Burnham, with art by Alberto Muriel, Casey Maloney, Guiu Vilanova and Hugo Petrus.


The A-Team: Shotgun Wedding
After a successful-but harrowing-completion to a mission in icy Alaska, Hannibal and the team are up for some much-needed leave in sunny San Diego to attend the wedding of a high-ranking U.S. official's daughter.  But when threats are made against the event, the A-Team is forced to quit their vacation and go undercover to foil what might be a terrorist plot. 
Written by Joe Carnahan and Tom Waltz, with pencils by Stephen Mooney.
