Thanks, as always, for your excellent work and the effort you have gone to with this show to provide these excellent quality epsiodes.

I know it is something you do for only a very small audience.

Cheers
Jon"

LOL... I even have replied ""That is mathematically impossible 'cause HDTV was SHARPENED with 3x3 matrix by - 50% (by factor 1.5) and it is ethically impossible to have, made or found anything ""sharper"" - at 350MB and 1280x720.
I guess - loony tooneys are everywhere."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T11:04Z,"err.:
ethically = technically"
,Mainers,2010-05-21T06:24Z,"Thanks in advance twentyforty, first time I have tried your files, got all previous from eztv, but I am curious to see if these look better, going by the nfo they should, keep up the good work."
,Orchonic,2010-05-22T23:42Z,"ummm, it is not high quality video, its not really 720.  the filesize really does equal quality to a point.  this feels like it was upscaled to become 720p, because it quite pixelated.
DONT DOWNLOAD, BETTER ONE HERE:

[V],twentyforty,2010-05-23T19:54Z,"@Orchonic: Sorry to inform you - but EVERY single thing you've claimed is - LIE. If you need exact expansion of the word ""lie"" - look at Merriam-Webster, it's free and on-line."
,Mainers,2010-05-24T04:52Z,"Just wanted to add that these are truly the best 350mb episodes out there,they are not pixcelated on my screen Orchonic !
Cheers again twentyforty"
,MitchC9,2010-05-24T09:10Z,"He's right this is a 350mb file, a 720p one would be about 1.09gb. The original feed could not have been HD (whether or not your file is 1280x720 or not) it's a sham."
