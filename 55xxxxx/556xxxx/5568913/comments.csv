,tigomir,2010-05-20T23:39Z,"whay don't i have audio on samsung b7000 with wiki,metis mkv and with dimension, immerse wel"
,fetalblow,2010-05-21T06:35Z,almost 4.5 gigs and not even HD? there are better copies out there. don't label as 720p if its not 720p. bluray is 1080p so there's no excuse about how it was ripped either.
,hollohill,2010-05-22T07:02Z,"A-10 V-9

Will be seeding for quite a while because 30 kb/s DL sucks."
,J33SEJ,2010-05-22T10:26Z,"@fetalblow... I havent laughed so hard since i last read that!
Have you ever heard the saying ""Better to remain quiet and thought of as stupid, Than to open your mouth and remove all doubt!?

aoloffline yet another fine upload many thanks for your time and effort! Will seed."
,hpisaliar,2010-05-23T11:01Z,"Hey  
Blu ray forum says that this movie is to be released on June 15 ,2010
How come the Blu-ray rip Is is duplicate .Some body explain"
,Sammmoo,2010-05-23T14:44Z,"tigomir, its because ur tv doesnt support DTS although this movie isnt in dts.. this should work fine"
,highrez,2010-05-24T03:39Z,"movies skips the whole way through, it was completely unwatchable. anyone else?"
,fetalblow,2010-05-25T09:08Z,"@J33SEJ
The resolution is in the description which is not HD. So there is no reason to label it as 720p... because it's not."
,leepee2000,2010-05-25T13:44Z,"fetalblow ! ? just stop dude it's embarrassing, the description does not say 720 because there is no point encoding the black lines at the top and bottom of the screen (that would be stupid!) instead we have been given a 1280x536 HD image to watch (much bigger than SD which is only 480 high, by the way thankyou very much aoloffline, really appreciated), if you want 1080 they are weighing in at over 8 gig (but wait a minute the description of those files says 1920 x 800 ! so that must mean that they aren't HD ! either =-) )"
,Gabbytangent,2010-05-26T01:58Z,"quick download for me. thanks guys n uploader. ill seed this for a while.
"
,Metroidn1f,2010-05-27T18:27Z,"If you watch it in MPCStar (Tiger Player) you might see squares.  But if you watch it in if you watch it in something like BS Player Pro, It will look better."
,xerobacter,2010-05-28T01:31Z,"Nice pictures and good video quality for this movie, but its a theocratic peace of shit"
,grotler,2010-05-28T14:42Z,"Nice, wathed with qq player.
Video 10/10
Audio 10/10
Movie 10/10

This is one of the best movies ever..."
,DecoySquad,2010-06-03T23:54Z,"Ha ha fatalblow you must be the biggest noob on this site, welcome you idiot. Thanks aoloffline as always."
,AxMataz,2010-06-10T00:07Z,"Do you guys leave comments before you even look at the movie?

As highrez states, the movie skips a little bit about every second, wich makes it unwatchable.

Is this not the case for any of you?"
,VEGA83,2010-06-13T00:09Z,"Jeez... some people actually think that 1280x536 is not HD. It is.

With the common movie aspect ratio of 2.35:1 the actual picture's height can not be 720.
That would require a resolution of 1693x720."

,MIXicant,2010-06-22T16:29Z,"up until about 0:06:20 h:mm:ss the audio skipped, but I couldn't tell any visual skipping.  now, at 0:06:20, it seems everything is running smooth, so try to skip there and see if you get the same resolve"
,MIXicant,2010-06-22T16:45Z,"the audio skipping seems to persist throughout the next ten minutes of the movie, possibly through the rest.  quite a shame since the video quality is a 11/10"
,MIXicant,2010-06-23T21:56Z,"I've found that, for some reason, the audio skips when playing this movie in VLC.  when playing this movie in QQ Player, someone mentioned earlier, the audio does not skip.  here's the catch: the QQ Player I've found is in a foreign language, a form of Chinese.  besides that the audio is fine
I would test WMP but my default install of it can't play the file lolwat

Anyone else with other player audio success, or a solution to the VLC's audio issue?"
,MIXicant,2010-06-23T23:15Z,"I have tried another player, Media Player Classic, and the audio does not skip.  I'm a big fan of VLC, and it hurt to leave it, but MPC seems alright.  the interface is clean, and if you have windows 7 (or possibly some sort of taskbar hack similar to), it shows movie progression/status on the taskbar, as if it were a download.  pretty cool feature

link to a massive codec pack that includes MPC:
http://k-lite-codec-pack.en.softonic.com/download#pathbar

I chose advanced install, but I'm pretty sure you can just as easily get away with simple install.  I changed very little in advanced"
,downpayment,2010-07-04T01:49Z,This is not real HD and Im a tard and blah blah lol ... joke! Thank you aoloffline and Wiki. :)
,s0wh4t,2010-07-28T15:30Z,that was a nice movie
,evildrugmonkey,2010-08-05T13:20Z,Quality ia excellent. thanks alot.
,raoul63,2010-08-08T14:31Z,"Good quality, no problem with audio as some others reported.  Worked fine on WDTV Live."
,Kale_z,2010-08-24T23:52Z,"Don't download that enormous K-Lite codec pack. It's quite awkward and includes stuff that you will propably never need. Instead of K-Lite, download FFDshow codec pack. It's smoother, faster, smaller and does the equal job."
,BadMoonz,2010-09-02T09:17Z,"Wish I had read the description and saw that it was subbed... 

Just wondering as to why people need subs in there video in the first place"

,bbtuna,2010-10-24T20:00Z,"are the subtitles hardcoded or whatever its called, if so how can i turn them off or get rid of them?"

,Fifth7,2010-11-20T18:23Z,"Please seed, 1d17hours left."
,KineticTowel,2011-05-06T08:59Z,"I watched this on the latest VLC Player and I had no problems with the audio or the video. Amazing quality by the way. Thanks for the upload. Also some people earlier were talking about FFDshow? Now I don't know alot about this, but I think if you have the latest version, it should run just fine on VLC. Again I'm no expert so it could be that they're not even connected.

-Towel"
,KineticTowel,2011-05-06T09:02Z,"@BadMoonz

Some foreign people might have difficulties understanding what the actors are saying, therefore subtitles are useful.

Also for movies that are of another language."
,satwn187,2012-03-04T22:40Z,"SUPER AMAZING QUALITY.  whoever put a negative rating for this is a dipshit. i watched on 42''LCD with xbox360 and its seriously one of the best looking movies i have seen on TPB.  aoloffline thanks so much!!!! 
A10+
v10+"
,satwn187,2012-03-04T22:45Z,"i just read the other comments, and i didnt notice any skipping.  but i didnt watch on a computer"
,marcoshank,2012-06-18T02:34Z,"V: 10/10
A: 10/10

Superb quality! We should thank the uploader. If you don't want the subtitle just disable it. What is so hard about it, damn?"
