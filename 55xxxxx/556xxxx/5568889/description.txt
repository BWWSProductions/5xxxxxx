Since Cancer last year (asc 28 gem) I decided to make music "albums" for each sign of the zodiac the sun was in, at that time I used the sidereal zodiac but switched to the tropical. Ever since I was 4 at the beach songs would come to my consciousness (19/M), the first melody was "the waves go crashing down, the water never drowns" I've probably written over 1,000 songs and after awhile I would feel certain shifts, like my life is moving to a new level so I organized albums before I knew astrology. Now knowing what I know about astrology, these changes correspond to the life cycles of the moon and the suns trekk through my natal houses, so I use the life of the moon to make an album for each tropical sign the sun is in. And all the music I make I release free, and tomorrow I'm having a blogtv release party for my Taurus Cd "Too Any Doors...Only Windows" w/ free mp3 
 
By Sidereal Scorpio I said I had 20 albums (though most were just in my head) I've undergone what I consider to be a spiritual rebirth, and now consider this the first 2.0 album as well as I just assembled a chronological "Best Of Pelican Music Stuff" 09 CD. I'm very fascinating and left a good paper trail, it be fun to dig into my life with people who read the heavens. 
 
I think musically rx Mars / Neptune yods push pulling is where I can channel that "spark", plus I love being a 5th House Scorpio Sun. I'll post music in this thread, hope we can have fun!
