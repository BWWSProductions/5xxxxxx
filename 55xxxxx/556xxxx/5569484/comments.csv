,bergraf,2010-05-18T22:34Z,Is this the real thing?
,Iamnotamember,2010-05-20T00:08Z,I can't believe these assholes let this leak.  LMAO - typical blackwell briggs bullshit.
,jurij1338,2010-05-21T18:40Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEED
,RedBusterd,2010-05-21T23:37Z,TPB is The most educational tool the world has ever seen. Love you guys and all who upload such things. Never knew who these Blackwell briggs fuckers were 'til now... I almost puked after seeing this video clip.
,Jonas,2010-05-21T23:51Z,"This is the worst troll shit I have ever seen. I really hope that the mail response is bullshit and all this will lead to something real. There aint no law suit, there aint no...ah, I just give up. "
,Menthix,2010-05-22T00:54Z,"This is nothing more than some kind of viral ad campaign for Nokia.

See http://www.conspiracyforgood.com/, the are the ones spreading this. Then go to http://www.conspiracyforgood.com/rules and click the 'Terms of Service' and 'Privacy Policy' links.

In case they change it, those links lead to https://account.nokia.com/acct/public/termsAndConditions?serviceId=Ovicom&tlang=en&country=GB and https://account.nokia.com/acct/public/privacyPolicy?tlang=en&country=GB"
,Kgeorge86,2010-05-22T09:26Z,So the pirate party is conspiring with nokia... 
,Menthix,2010-05-22T17:09Z,"Meh, doubt it. TPB probably had no clue it was an ad campaign when they wrote this: http://static.thepiratebay.org/legal/bwb_mail_resp.txt"
,baxter84,2010-05-22T18:28Z,"lol @ Menthix, they posted their first legal threat for 2 years and u think they got fooled? they knew and its damn good pr for tpb to have companies using their site for distribution"
,Armoreska_,2010-05-22T18:28Z,The mail was sent right after the torrent was upped considering GMT -7
,jazztelia,2010-05-22T19:06Z,Awesome AD
,merethan,2010-05-22T19:17Z,"It still stuns me how good this clip looks. There's lots of money spend on it. And it is unlikely to be the only one ever made.

I can only imagine how much money is spend on making clips like this, let alone lobbying all together. And since a corporation is only created for generating stakeholders value, there's some sort of ""return of investment"" calculation somewhere, which states there's much more money to be made then this lobbying and film making costs.

When surveillance becomes profitable, and it clearly is, is it weird we see so much of it?"
[T],extremezone,2010-05-22T19:29Z,this BlackwellBriggs noobs must stop messing with tpb leading force :))
,Gurthag,2010-05-22T20:48Z,"This is obviously a Viral. Now, question is: Has been TPB fooled into thinking this was for real? or is the funny letter answer part of the viral?
"
,77777joker77777,2010-05-23T01:32Z,"Yep it's a viral.
Both blackwellbriggs.com and conspiracyforgood.com are registered to the same persons according to whois... check yourself."

[T],raidy,2010-06-07T06:48Z,Nokia sucks ass. Using TPB as a publicity stunt no less.
,CGar,2010-06-19T00:36Z,"wow, that video is a load of crap from that dude. basically give us the power to remove your human rights at will so we make more money and u can do shit about it, eat my balls Blackwell Briggs.

,Unit431,2010-12-11T10:14Z,"This is a viral marketing ploy for an upcoming movie, in case you didn't know. K4YCee works for the film company who created it, and the whole lawsuit email was another clever ploy that was created in order to spread the word about the film. The joke's on TPB and anyone who actually downloads this bullshit..."
,xbox360jtag,2010-12-31T21:56Z,I didn't download. I just wanted to see if they took it down after the legal threat. LOL

,iAppleseedy,2012-05-19T09:47Z,"@Wi-Foo-er, if it was all fake, then why do you think they bothered to ask TPB to remove it?"
,PyroTheGreat,2012-06-05T01:23Z,"I got here from the legal section... TPB is just amazing. LOVE them for standing up like that. 

Piratebay forever! don't be afraid of those industry bitches! "
,romi1968,2012-06-08T00:22Z,"**WARNING**- If you are like me you read the comments b4 d/l. If you do then you may get the impression that the d/l is a n*&ia ad. Why would a company block out the name of a cell phone if the presentation was to be for government eyes only? Thatsx just stupid. It is showing you can use off the shelf tech. That is smart. However I see other mobile phones and laptops and other devices that arent n*&ia. Did S*#y, n*&ia, Sam$%^g, iP%$e. all gang up to create one ad? No they didnt. What those comments are is employees of BlackwellBriggs who were told to quickly come up with a way to make people think it wasnt real. This is some real bad shit if it is real. Think of the tv series person of interest where a computer monitors behavior for possible   
violent tendencies, they monitor everything and compile lists and correlate data and knock knock someones at your door to arrest you for something you may do. Be very afraid of this technology. "
,romi1968,2012-06-08T00:24Z,Yeah we get it 99.99%of the people are here from the legal section. 
,romi1968,2012-06-08T00:25Z,This link is obiously BlackwellBriggs sponsored too--- Misdirection at work. http://www.hudghton.co.uk/the_nokia_-_blackwell_briggs_-_conspiracy_for_good_-_crap_viral_campaign.html
,romi1968,2012-06-08T00:46Z,The whoule hudghton blog was made up on the spot and back dated for 3 mos now look theres no more posts just eh 3 mos then. Alos his video links only 2 work its all fluff to make you think its a real blog. it isnt. Dont fall for it. Also he says he closed comments cuz its not what his blog is about...well why post it if you dont want comments? Haha even the comments on his comments page are from 1 hour old commenters. haha. This is fantastic for anyone who can do 15 minutes of web research. So the BB thing is real and they just want us to think it isnt. nice try. not.
