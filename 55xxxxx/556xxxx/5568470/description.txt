welcome to the XP/SP3 black edition. installable to USB.
this version is not my creation but iv used it many times and its a beaut!passes wga and will update.permanantly activated!im pretty sure its almost an unnattended installation except for when you choose whitch drive you wish to install on.(it recognizes usb stick as a drive,somethin the dicks at microsoft tell you aint possible lol).
NOTES TO REMEMBER!
1.take care as to identify clearly which drive you will be   installing to!
2.this install to usb is SLOW!and i mean SLOW!set aside 90 mins to   install(i dont know why exactly,it just takes ages).it may appear   to hang at some stages but dont panic!just slow is all.
3.YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE A VISTA/7 WINDOWS DISK OR A MICROSOFT   STARTUP REPAIR DISK FOR THIS INSTALL IF YOU ARE GOING TO DUAL   BOOT THIS ON A VISTA COMP!!!reason?xp will overwrite the MBR  (master boot record)when it installs, so XP is the only system     that boots.its how XP works.to fix this after install,pop in your   vista disk and hit startup repair and it will return your MBR     (master boot record)back to normal(vista),and youll have a new      option(windows xp)in the boot list.:-) 
4.any version of windows on a stick is only setup to run on your   computer ONLY!.YOU CANNOT PLUG THE USB INTO ANOTHER   COMP/MOTHERBOARD.!this is because when windows installs,it loads   its drivers according to the host computers settings(go complian   to microsoft,see how you go lol!)
5.this install has sata and all raid drivers you will need.works   fine on new style stuff.
6.this version is preactivated,passes wga and im pretty sure will   update.happy trails.seeddddd ppl!!seeeeedddd!!
7.if your unsure about any of what you just read?do some research or find someone with some skills though its really not that hard:-)
INSTRUCTIONS!

FINAL NOTE:YOU MUST FORMAT THE USB STICK AS YOU WOULD ANY DRIVE BEFORE INSTALL(NOT JUST A QUICK ONE,DO A FULL FORMAT FIRST)use"hpusbfw" google it ppl!
