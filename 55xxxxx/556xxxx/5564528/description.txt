Martin Manser has created an oversized book filled to the brim with more than 7,000 facts and quiz questions to test your Bible knowledge. Quiz sections include General Knowledge, Biblical History, Geography, Who Said That?, Where Is It Said?, The Bible in Art, and The Bible in the Movies. A variety of questions and facts-ranging from the incredible to the inspirational-are included so that everyone, including children and those with advanced Bible knowledge, can participate in hours of learning...or just plain fun. Humorous cartoon illustrations abound to add visual appeal and help the book entertain while it teaches. A big book with great value.
