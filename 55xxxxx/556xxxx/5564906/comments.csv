,NickDanger,2010-05-17T00:11Z,"Agree - old and pointless.  OP, do you even use Photoshop?"
,daotterone,2010-05-19T14:42Z,"To DrAnal- onOne's Plugin Suite 5 is not for Photoshop CS5. Don't let the ""5"" fool you. I just read on onOne's website that Photoshop CS5 plugins will be available May 31st.

onOne's Plugin Suite 5 has been out for quite sometime, is last years plugin suite for CS4. The CS5 update to the suite is yet to be made available.

Furthermore, until compatible plugins are available I really don't see a reason to bother installing Photoshop CS5. It's like buying a new car without tires. My opinion anyway...Cheers!"

,Harrygohil,2010-09-15T16:56Z,"Well, it has been released now for CS5 ready (64bit) but even b4 it was working, providing you use in 32 bit instead of 64. As CS 5 is default at 64bit which you have to change it in to 32bit. "

,Emmory,2012-03-01T16:36Z,Every single one of these got flagged by Avast. I don't really care if they're false positives or not - not taking the chances on this one.
