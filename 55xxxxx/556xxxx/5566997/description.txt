As much as I love Tuesday Weld, it's weird seeing 
her normally long blond hair cut so short 
and a different color. There is nothing glamourous 
about her in this episode of Cimarron Strip. 
1968 was probably not a good year for her.

Also in the guest cast is character actor Bernie Hamilton, 
who would late become best known as Starsky & Hutch's 
police captain boss!
