           Puddle of Mudd's sophomore album finds the band both digging deeper into its grunge 
           tendencies and broadening its musical horizons with a collection of sometimes       
           sinewy, sometimes uncharacteristically introspective tracks. The almost restrained  
           "Sydney" falls into the latter category, its reflective lyric adding another        
           dimension to the band's usually testosterone-driven songwriting. And it's by no     
           means alone here, being immediately followed by "Time Flies," an extended exercise  
           in surprising sensitivity.
