Notes:
Previously uncirculated unmarked tape for this show transferred with Dolby B on as per Mike's notes on the tape labels using an adjustable outboard Dolby B unit. This is the 1st time (May 2010) this tape has ever been digitized. The sound is completely unaltered except for pitch correction and fades put at the beginning and end of the recording. This was the show Millard got into a car accident and wound up missing most of it. This was all he was able to capture this night.
