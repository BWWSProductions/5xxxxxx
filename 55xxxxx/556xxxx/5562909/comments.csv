Good file sharer's don't expect a lot of thank you's. Watch your seeders and leechers and you'll get your thanks. I'm always very happy when I see 20, 60, 250, or 500 leechers on my torrents. Then I know I'm very much appreciated. There are currently 25 seeders and 23 leechers on this torrent. By this you should know that people appreciate your efforts. THANKS, again.

This book has the tag ""conservative"" because many of Dr. Duke's views would be classified as conservative, in the sense of traditional but not in the sense of status quo.  Obama, McCain, and Beck are status quo conservatives.  Duke is a traditional conservative.

He shares the views of America's founding fathers regarding integration and multi-culturalism.

He believes in securing the border and even organized the first citizen border watch programs in the 1970s. 

He is also anti-globalist and anti-imperialist.

All of these are traditional American views that place him in sharp contrast to the diversity-mongering, open-borders marxists like Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and their cheerleaders on the False News Network."
