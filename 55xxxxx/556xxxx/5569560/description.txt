Here is a very under-appreciated set of Beethoven's symphonies conducted by the great Rafael Kubelik. It's kind of a 'mongrel' in that every symphony in the cycle is done with a different ensemble; maybe this is why you rarely see this set mentioned at all. In any case all the readings are worth listening to, and a few (especially the 9th) rank among the very best. Sound quality is excellent mid-70's analog.
