======================================================================================================================

Note about virus warnings: If you get a trojan or virus warning then it's a false positive! - I've added nothing!!
You get exactly the same warning when you download and install the retial version because it's the same setup.
I only removed and modified some files to disable MoovieLive, Movie Remix and RichVideo and to make it pre-activated!

Here's how to check the Digital Signatures:
â€¢ Extract Setup.exe with 7-zip and open the directory where you extracted the files
â€¢ Right click on an exe file, select properties and click on the Digital Signatures tab
â€¢ Double click on the Signature and read the line below "Digital Signature Information"
â€¢ If it says that the Digital Signature is OK, it means that the file isn't altered!
â€¢ Click on the "View Certificate" button for more information

======================================================================================================================

Install: Just run Setup.exe and you are done, it's registered and activated.
