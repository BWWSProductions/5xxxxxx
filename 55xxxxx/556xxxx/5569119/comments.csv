,Fejj,2010-05-18T22:20Z,"thanks! Perfect download, file finished in about 15 minutes :)"
,deldelak,2010-05-18T22:23Z,please seed
,FormaldehydeFTW,2010-05-19T00:21Z,"I don't see how this could be 720p, considering that the size is only 300 MB and usually it takes almost double that for a twenty minute show in 720p."
,lilars26,2010-05-19T01:22Z,"@formaldahyde  This file has 565 seeders and
twentyforty has a pink scull.Do you really think 
this is fake.Use your head."
,FormaldehydeFTW,2010-05-19T01:59Z,"@lilars26 My apologies. Perhaps I wasn't clear. I am not claiming that this isn't real, but that it isn't in HD. I have often watched this show in 720p (which is why I visited this torrent) but usually they are around 1.5 GB each. For it to be 300 MB, at around a fifth of the usual size, something doesn't feel right.

But, this is all speculation. Can someone confirm one way or the other? And bear in mind that a 480p picture stretched out to 720p is not 720p even if the dimensions are correct because the amount of information in the picture doesn't increase, only the size."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T05:59Z,"@FormaldehydeFTW: So far you could download this dozen times instead wasting of people's time.

I posted the data - and you practically asking: Have this 20-40 lying? Have he fucked ALL 2 MILLION people who downloaded his encodings? 

And you could done ONE SIMPLE MOUSE-CLICK on my icon and see 30 pages of 900 torrents. And I'm here only 6 months.

Now - dp NOT even think that your question is completely legal. Do NOT think that you're entitled to ask am I a crook, thief, layer, motherfucker, cunt (all nice terms I can hear on TPB all the time). Do NOT even think that your rubbish about ""stretching"" the picture make any sense. 
To you... for sure.
Just stop coming and go someplace else."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-19T09:13Z,"@FormaldehydeFTW : go prepare formaldehyde don't put your shits in 2040'z page.. Just for the record the 720p you downloaded earlier wasn't encoded in h264 or x264 codec then it would have been a lot smaller

@2040: thank you.."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-19T09:14Z,"@2040: why didn't you upload gg in 272p this time?

Some time if you have time could you do all the 3 seasons in 720p and per episode within 305mb?"

,FormaldehydeFTW,2010-05-19T11:30Z,"@twentyforty You see, the problem is that I do not have the best of connections and in fact, would most likely not even have the file downloaded in this time. Hence, the caution.

If you will look through my former remarks, you may note that not once have I made any mention of you, nor any of those 'colourful words' you mentioned. This is because it was never my intention to question your honesty, or your competence. In fact, I was counting on a very logical explanation for this happenstance (such as the torrent being named incorrectly, or as I have found, that the format causes the file to take up less space).

Once again, I will add that I have yet to fling the first of insults and this being the case, do not understand why you have taken to such a hostile approach. But, perhaps, this is just the way things are nowadays.

Regardless, I apologize for taking up your time and thank you for the great service you have done for a lot of us.

@pluto999 Despite the insult attached to your comment, thanks, that's all I was looking for. I had a feeling that this may be the reason for the smaller size."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-19T12:46Z,"@FormaldehydeFTW: ...and by same miracle you cannot see what actually you've said. Not what you write right now in you response - but word for word as I have ""received"".
You could click, as I have said - and it would take only two seconds to see ""Wow, it is one of 900 such encodings, this guy is for real"" instead of writing two long turds and kept wasting yours and mine time.

Look, I do sympathize with your ""caution is needed"" part (I am doing ""my things"" FOR people like you, on limited budget or connection) - but every single word I have said still stands.
Maybe you'll learn one day, that you cannot nicely walk in the someone's house, speak rubbish, ask the owner how big tits have his wife, laugh, fart once or twice and then ask may you take a dump on the living room floor.
You can - but you'll get with a baseball bat across your face.
That's is what you can get here, for same persistent trolling."
[V],pluto999,2010-05-19T15:30Z,"@FormaldehydeFTW: First of all i don't mean to insult anyone but there are many douchebags who just talk shit and comment shit rather than appreciating the hard work that has been done by the encoders & uploaders..
