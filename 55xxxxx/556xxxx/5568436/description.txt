                    Your Sudden Death Question.              
                    Over an August Bank Holiday, an empty Oxford  
                    college is the venue for a weekend attended by  
                    professional quiz contestants. Lewis and  
                    Hathaway are called in when outstanding  
                    competitor Ethan Croft is found floating dead  
                    in the college fountain. They learn that Croft  
                    was an outrageous flirt with a number of  
                    secrets, and the pair race to uncover the  
                    killer before the gathering breaks up.   
                    Meanwhile, Hathaway discovers that Lewis was  
                    planning a romantic weekend at Glyndebourne  
                    with a mystery date.
