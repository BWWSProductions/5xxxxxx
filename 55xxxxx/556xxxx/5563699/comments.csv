,mollers69,2010-05-16T15:58Z,Can some one help please.  I'm currently downloading the Amiable 10g file and plan to copy onto my PS3 hard drive.  Will it then play the Navi subs or do I need to do something with this file?  I'm not very technical I'm afraid.  Cheers
,tuthpik,2010-05-16T21:17Z,"you need mkv2vob.

get it here: http://www.mkv2vob.com/

100% guranteed to work for PS3!!!

Just make sure you split the files for 4GB Fat systems and check mark Add Subtitles From File then select English (ENG) subs from the language box and you're done.

I made it sound technical, but when you see it, its really really ez to use!"

just rename the .srt subs file to the same as the video file, and it should display automatically on most players.  or you can manually choose/browse for the subs.. at least with VLC."
