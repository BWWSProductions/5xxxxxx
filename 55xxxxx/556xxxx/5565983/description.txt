Beast 1333 is an underground rap artist bought up by KRS-One. Beast 1333 has 2 albums out and due to release his 3rd soon. These are his 2-CD's "Birth of the Beast" and "Mark of the Beast". His mission is to expose the NWO agenda by reaching mass numbers of people by the means of music and with the help of dedicated people like your self. The average person will not sit down and listen to a 5 minute
speech, but if we encrypt or message in the song, people will not only listen, but be intrigued by the content of the song, that they themselves will look up the information and wake up to the truth of whats really happening around the world. Or mission is not to overthrow any government, nor are we against them. Our mission is to Resist tyranny and Restore the Constitution and bring justice and freedom back to the people of this earth.
