         Earthquakes and volcanoes pose an unpredictable and deadly    
         threat here on Earth, but they also occur far out in the      
         universe. What can we learn from these interplanetary         
         phenomena that may help us predict when Mother Nature         
         will next unleash her fury? Scientists are looking to Io,     
         a moon of Jupiter that is jam-packed with volcanoes, for      
         insights. Then we'll travel deep under the Earth's crust      
          to see the physical source of these catastrophic events.
