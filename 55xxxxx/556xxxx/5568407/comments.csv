,oversoul53,2010-05-17T06:56Z,"Tonight?s Family Guy marks the second one to ever be done without cutaway gags. Any references were used as a part of the actual storyline and/or narrator driven-plot and therefore cannot be considered as cutaway gags. Also, there were no lines such as ?Like that time I?? or ?Than the time I was?? at all tonight"
