heres a request list:
 ultimate traffic 2,
 level d 767,
 flightsim labs concorde x
 haha, just messing, if anyone uploaded those 3 working they'd become an instant hero, elevated to rock god status.
i'm trying to move away from my gps dependency and use more traditional navigation but its bloody hard work using maps, headings and eyeballs, different tho.
just keep em coming mate, if its not on here and you've got it just upload it."
,cfto_can,2010-05-14T10:22Z,"CHUCK : I only fly GA or Light twins or single engine stuff , CARENADO Planes etc...no Heavies here.

Im adding a near 30 GB FSX  Torrent..Various stuff in it...makes it a b=nice grab bag!

Try the GPS I posted...I too use maps , approach plates ( all on paper ) Provided by Pilots who here in Canada must toss em out every 90 days I think..so I wrote so custom software for a semi private Air Ambulance Company , so the pilots cage me HEAPS of Sectionals, IFR Enroute Maps , Low - High Altitude maps...I have have all of CANADA...so if you like flying around here...I can make JPG of any approach or sectional ya wish...

Is the speed ok out there boys n girls ?

,chuckmamuck,2010-05-14T12:46Z,"cfto_can
same here mate, i got fed up of flying heavies, my joystick was unused flying on autopilot and landing ILS, it got boring in the end so i started flying props again and i'm loving it, i now mostly fly my baron, skylane on floats and most of all my super pup with tundra tyres, its loadsa fun going to the back of beyond and finding places that nothing else could get in.
any maps of good out the way places in the Canadian wilderness would be much appreciated mate, im sure you know some good places you've found so if you up the maps i'll defo make good use of them.
cheers. "

,Sniperz,2010-05-15T07:49Z,"Thanks for this add-on

The only problem is that there is no seed and i still stand on 0%."
,aarque,2010-05-15T11:21Z,"Sniperz, the torrent is fewer than 24 hours old.  If you had ever uploaded a single dam thing, you would know that is takes some time to ""seed"" to the other computers that will inevitably continue to share your torrent when you bug out. That said, it is a little unsettling that there are over a hundred leechers and not a single seed...

Speaking of seeders Rob, I strongly advise you edit your torrent description. Spammers use web crawling bots, just like Google's, except these bots don't catalog the entire internet, they sequentially scan each page searching specifically for the ASCII string that corresponds to ""blabla@blah.com."" They will capture that email address and add it to their ""mailing list.""

 That is the reason why you see so many people obscure their email address ""webscamminghotmama at somewhereinafrica dot com."""
,Sniperz,2010-05-15T13:15Z,"Yes i know it's just 24 hpur since the upload, but the size of this rorrent is smal and i see 75 leechers now all standing on 0% :) But i just wait, no hurry "
,FS_Junkie,2010-05-16T15:28Z,When you've all quite finished requesting other stuff ... could I request someone please SEED THIS ONE? LOL! Much appreciated.
,Kaluleomorir,2010-05-19T16:09Z,Request ----> FS Force 2 (from Dirks Software)
