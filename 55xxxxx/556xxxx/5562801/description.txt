another djsforfun exclusive!

ThereÃ†s a sentence in Dead Letter CircusÃ† official bio that might just be the
first accurate thing a band has ever written about themselves, Ã´Watching someone
on their first listen to Brisbane alternative breakthroughs Dead Letter Circus
searching to come up with a neat description is fascinating viewing... Ã´ItÃ†s
kind of like... no wait, itÃ†s more of a... Wow, I have no idea what it is, but
itÃ†s different...Ã¶ It describes the band perfectly, with their delay soaked
alternative rock drawing comparisons ranging from The Mars Volta to U2. For the
last couple of years with the help of a brilliant EP, thousands of very loyal
fans and more recently, a major label, DLC have become one of the more popular
bands in Australian rock. Thus with the release of their debut album there is
quite a large amount of expectation. Fans however, can rest easy, because the
album is killer.

Epic is a word thrown around all too frequently in reference to bands in this
genre, seemingly becoming just another genre name for bands with big vocals and
spaced out songs. However, on This is the Warning, Dead Letter Circus have
actually achieved the definition of epic. Coming across as a combination of The
Temper Trap, Karnivool and everything else in between, the band manage to
maintain an air of experimentation while still being inherently catchy. ThatÃ†s
essentially where This is the Warning succeeds as an album; it has a crossover
appeal that will appease music fans in general. This is particularly true on
songs such as the scintillating opener Ã¦Here We DivideÃ† and the insanely catchy
Ã¦Big.Ã† Both are songs that are reasonably straightforward in terms of structure,
but still manage to maintain interest over and over.

The bandÃ†s progression from their debut EP is apparent from the get go, both in
song writing and musicianship. Throughout This is the Warning there is a myriad
of extra sounds and instruments. This is particularly true for some of the more
experimental songs on the album, namely Ã¦The DrumÃ† and Ã¦The Design.Ã† Without
getting too far ahead of ourselves, Ã¦The DrumÃ† may just be the best thing DLC
has written. Featuring everything from industrial influences to Karnivool
inspired heaviness, Ã¦The DrumÃ† shows that Dead Letter Circus is not a Ã¦one trick
pony,Ã† but is in fact capable of experimenting and, funnily enough, excelling at
it. Ã¦The DrumÃ† is quite a subdued track, giving vocalist Kim Benzie the perfect
vessel to prove his worth (If the rest of the album hadnÃ†t already done that for
you). Ã¦CageÃ† also sees the band head in a new direction. While still a
straightforward song in terms of structure, it deviates from the traditional
Dead Letter Circus sound in that it is largely industrial based, particularly in
the chorus. This inclusion of new influences and instruments once again gives
the band room to experiment, giving rise to a brilliant song.

Staying true to their roots, there are a couple of songs that hark back to Dead
Letter CircusÃ† early days. Fuelled by Rob Maric and his guitar delay, Ã¦This Long
HourÃ† is essentially Ã¦The MileÃ† on speed, featuring the best chorus that Dead
Letter Circus have written so far. While first single Ã¦The Space on the WallÃ†
sees the band in rock anthem mode, with Stewart HillÃ†s bass propelling the song.
Conversely, the title track and closer ditches the verse/chorus format all
together, giving drummer Luke Williams a chance to show off, pounding his toms
amidst BenzieÃ†s consistently astounding vocals. Williams also proves his worth
in Ã¦WalkÃ† with the jangling guitars and huge vocal bridge providing the perfect
medium for him to experiment with his style, and doing so to perfection.

The only real negative is that a couple of the songs, namely Ã¦ReactionÃ† and
Ã¦Next In LineÃ† are not completely new, having been around since early 2008.
Funnily enough, while they were probably considered some of Dead Letter CircusÃ†
best songs prior to the albumÃ†s release, they are the two weakest tracks on the
album, if only for the fact that there is little deviation from the sound of
their debut EP. This however, should not be a deterrent, as they are both great
songs in their own right, they just lack the extra oomph and flesh that the rest
of the album has.

By including a huge range of new influences and sounds, Dead Letter Circus have
quashed fears that their sound was becoming stale and have instead created a
superb and diverse debut album. With This is the Warning under their belts it
shouldnÃ†t be long before everyone is on the DLC band wagon. You better jump on
quickly.
