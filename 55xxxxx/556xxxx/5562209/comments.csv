,dreadpirateluffy,2010-05-17T07:33Z,Where are all the seeders?!
,lukaslover,2010-05-20T08:08Z,"Thanks for posting this, Carlos.
Sadly, the seeding is being hampered by a really poor download speed: it's reduced to 0.6kb and won't go above it. 
WTF is going on? Something is throttling the seed. "
,carlosinfabula,2010-05-21T10:55Z,"Apparently I'm still the only seeder. Gave it some extra bandwidth, but you know, patience... :)"
,lukaslover,2010-05-26T18:26Z,"ok...point taken. 
*smiles meekly*
I'm playing with my new pc now, so I'll just let the other one download quietly."
