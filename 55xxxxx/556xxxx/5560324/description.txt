Rod Stewart & the Faces (1974) The Final Concert

Recorded in November 1974 at London's Kilburn State Theatre, the show itself provides a likable experience as the band finishes their time together with a reasonably loose and lively performance. Those with an interest in Rod Stewart and/or the Faces should take a look as it is a valuable piece of rock history.

Bottom line is this: to see a slightly strung-out Keith Richards & a young, vital Ronnie Wood duel out Chuck Berry riffs on "Sweet Little Rock & Roller" is worth the download. These guys just don't kick out the jams like this anymore.

1. It's All Over Now
2. Take A Look At The Guy
3. Bring It All Home To Me
4. You Send Me
