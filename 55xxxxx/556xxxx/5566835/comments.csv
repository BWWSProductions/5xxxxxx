,m2rflpn,2010-05-28T19:37Z,"works like a charm.  I did buy xp twice n lost it both times, so I'm legit, IMO.  Can't activate, but since I'm using it on a Virtual Machine, not a big deal re-installing once a month.  Thanks, Matt.  Best xp torrent so far."
,Focus88,2010-06-01T20:32Z,"Thank you. I have legit OEM-keys and un-offical keys *ehm*. I only need the professional version. Thank you. Only downpart for me, is it in english, my second language. =)

,maxtoon,2010-07-19T22:46Z,"thanks for a great torrent. I also have a dell but my disk was only SP1, and it was annoying having to upgrade every time I reinstalled."
[T],Mattlb0619,2010-07-25T09:00Z,"your welcome guys, glad you find it useful. :)

idk if it is a dell OEM, i purchased it from newegg as OEM software for the computer i was putting together(that im on now).

@ashbey - ty for filling the request for a key."
[T],Mattlb0619,2010-07-25T09:02Z,@Luxverus - thats because it isnt the same iso. i ripped my cd and made the iso.
,tyrelleze,2010-08-23T07:39Z,Id laugh so hard if you burned the exe ;D

You're so funny my friend.

,JulioSalvador,2010-12-07T10:27Z,hey . what is the product key ? tnx ..
,JulioSalvador,2010-12-07T10:27Z,what is the product key>?
,jazzpill,2010-12-28T03:30Z,"Why oh why is the iso inside an exe?

- I want to install Windows, because I don't have it. 
- I can't run the exe, because I don't have Windows.
- I can't install Windows.

:)"
,ursus2,2011-01-13T11:42Z,Perfect! Doar Windows XP fara alte aberatii!

,kellmoo,2012-02-05T18:54Z,"@ Mattlb0619, thanks for the upload!

But it appears your ISO Hash is wrong or hacked:

md5: E132A261D96B5CB1FE7D76D3598A0A02
sha-1: 7F85CBB614CFB1E483342A206ECD663468643A2D

Could you double check your hash?

Thanks!"
