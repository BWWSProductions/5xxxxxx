Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)





Cuba Libre
The title is a literal one: Raimundo Garcia's satirical political comedy Cuba Libre (or 'Free Cuba') coincides with the first free elections in Cuba. As the story opens, a group of squatters are evicted from their cultural center and burst into the Cuban Embassy in Madrid - little realizing that their actions will make them the central targets of a die hard, take-no-prisoners reporter and an even more determined police force. Mario Arias, Luciano Federico and Sara Deray co-star; Garcia co-authored the original script with Enrique Calvo and Ulises Bermejo. 

Released in 2006. In Spanish with soft-coded English subtitles.
