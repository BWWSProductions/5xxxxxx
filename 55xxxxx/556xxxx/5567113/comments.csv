,MySecrets,2010-05-16T14:49Z,"Please tell us what is different about the files. Are they simply better quality? Do we need both sets?

Can these be played without iTunes? If not, then this torrent is not worth very much."

the files in this torrent have some noise reduction filter applied to them - what is best out of these two torrents is a choice of colors really.

I use iTunes hence the format; and you can convert them to MP3's in there I think."

,jniska,2010-05-17T06:17Z,"pls download this one instead as it seems dead - same files:
