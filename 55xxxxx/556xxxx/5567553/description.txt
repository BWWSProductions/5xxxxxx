Set in the very near future, The Knackery asks the question "How far will people take reality television?" with the gameshow in question pitting 6 contestants against each other in a "last man standing" fight, to win Â£1,000,000.

To add a little extra excitement to the show, the producers release a horde of genetically modified zombies after 13 minutes which helps splash a little colour around, as blood and guts spray the walls and floors of the Knackery!
