,pssyluvr,2011-08-29T23:30Z,"when it starts up it looks great but, when it comes to the part where you pick the team there are big blocks over the words. as far as the the whole renaming the config files, when I try it, it says there is already a file named config and wont let me change the name. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Can anybody help me? Thank you."
