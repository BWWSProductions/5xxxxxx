Change is good. Sometimes, you just need a little shake-up to get things to how 
they always ought to have been. With Heat Sin Water Skin, BettySoo adds some welcome edge and grit to the heartbreaker ballads and bell-pure vocals she's come to be known for. 

Teamed with seasoned producer Gurf Morlix (Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier, Slaid Cleaves), BettySoo has made a record worth sitting up and paying attention to. Her vocals are striking, the players strong, the sound gripping, and the lyrics compelling.

Joining her on Heat Sin Water Skin are Todd Wilson on organ, Gene Elders on fiddle, and Dave Terry on drums. BettySoo and Gurf handled the guitar and vocal parts themselves. As for genre, sheâ€™s still nestled in the folk-rock world, but she is bringing something new to her listeners. â€œThereâ€™s a little gospel, some straight-ahead folk, a bit of twang, and maybe even a familiar oldie with a new twist. Be ready for a surprise.â€ 

Then again, not much about BettySoo isnâ€™t surprising. People are surprised just to see her take the stage. Plain-faced, petite (clocking in at exactly 5 feet), and freckly, people donâ€™t have any idea what to expect â€“ they certainly donâ€™t expect such a large voice and moving songs. â€œI guess Asian-American singer-songwriters arenâ€™t that common,â€ she comments, â€œat least, not in Texas.â€ 

I couldn't believe such a talent wasn't on TPB so i had to share,

Enjoy!!
