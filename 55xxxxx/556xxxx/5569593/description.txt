Ronnie James Dio Live at Vredenburg Utrecht Holland December 4 1983. VHS rip

Dio plus Queensryche in 1983 on their first European tour was the first rock gig that I attended. Indeed Dio Live was the very first rock video that I ever bought. It was deleted from the catalogues ages ago. Here it is ripped to HD and saved as a DVD copy, which I have re-ripped to a single XVID PAL file.

Quality is excellent - especially for such an old tape.

Ronnie was one of the greatest rockers of all time. So when I heard today that he had died a couple of days ago, I decided to rip my first torrent, because I know that the fans of Dio will appreciate having a copy of this, the first Dio Live video.

All the best Ronnie - you've been part of my life for decades, helped me through the years and inspired me (and countless others) to become a singer and songwriter. The entire rock universe will miss you enormously.
