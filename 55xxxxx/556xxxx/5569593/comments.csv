,illuminateebob,2010-05-19T11:03Z,"Mastermic69 - The dvd copy was from the vhs and it has a compilation of other vhs stuff on it unrelated to Dio. This is why I ripped it to a single file. I also have a low UL bandwidth (60kbs). The quality of the AVI is essentially the same as the source. If you want a dvd of this, there's nothing to stop you creating one."
,mastermic69,2010-05-19T21:17Z,"Ok! i understand
Thanks! the quality was very good."
