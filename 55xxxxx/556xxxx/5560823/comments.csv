,ezboard,2010-05-14T15:00Z,what the FUCK is a .ts file?
,kencure,2010-05-16T02:54Z,"My Satellite receiver records in .ts Format.  Same thing for my security camera DVR.     Get yourself VLC media player  to play a .ts.  Also a great program for disabling the subtitle track in a movie.

That's what the FUCK a .ts file is"

Extremely grat capture, man! The animations are amazing, and close up's are as sharp as a knifeedge.

Great show, great upload, thanks!"

The bigger the file the better (usually), I'm avoiding the small files coz the quality is crap.

HD is not only about resolution, you know."
,zossie,2010-12-04T17:13Z,"Maybe you should buy another screen Ohnets, the quality on mine is just fine, better than fine, awesome!"
,soldiermoney,2010-12-29T18:42Z,"Please seed, this is great video material itÂ´s important that we share this. Please seed :)"
,davis_u5t00,2011-02-25T18:33Z,"Actually the quality of this encoding is quite terrible.
Ohnets is absolutely correct, watch this on a 50""+ screen and you will notice how blocky this really is.
Nice effort, but result is poor. I hope there is another torrent of this thats been transcoded with a higher bitrate and double passed in true HD as this series is fantastic.
Thanks but is not the best"
