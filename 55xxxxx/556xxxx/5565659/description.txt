PLOT
Joe's Apartment is a 1996 musical-serio-comic film starring Jerry O'Connell and Megan Ward and the first film produced by MTV Films. It was based on a short 1992 film first made for MTV (which was used as filler in between commercial breaks), but was also inspired by both the 1987 Japanese film Gokiburi-tachi No Tasogare (known as Twilight of the Cockroaches in the USA) and the American short film "Those Damn Roaches", also made in 1987. The main focus of the story is the fact that unbeknownst to many humans, roaches can talk but prefer not to since humans "smush first and ask questions later". They also sing (as they do many times in the movie) and even have their own public access channel. Actors providing the roaches' voices included Billy West, Jim Turner and Dave Chappelle.
