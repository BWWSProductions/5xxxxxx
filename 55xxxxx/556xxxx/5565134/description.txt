        Julie Walters (Filth: The Mary Whitehouse Story; Mamma Mia!) 
        stars in A Short Stay In Switzerland for BBC One, a one-off 
        drama inspired by the true story of Dr Anne Turner by award-
        winning writer Frank McGuinness. Having just witnessed the 
        death of her husband Jack from an incurable neurological 
        disease, Anne Turner (Julie Walters) is diagnosed with a 
        near-identical illness. With determined rationality, Anne's 
        answer is that once her illness has reached a critical point, 
        she will take her own life. And she needs her children's 
        support. But the more her son and two daughters struggle to 
        gain consensus over their mother's desire to die, as they 
        struggle to find another way through, the further they pull 
        apart. From Jessica's silent recriminations to Sophie's 
        stubborn practicality, the magnitude of the situation 
        threatens to tear the family to pieces. Anne must also face 
        the fury of her best friend Claire whose opposing views bring 
        them into direct and vocal conflict. Kate Harwood, Controller, 
        Series and Serials, BBC Drama Production, says: "One of 
        Ireland's foremost dramatists, Frank brings a lightness of 
        touch, dark wit and a heart-wrenching humanity to this piece 
        inspired by Anne Turner's story about life and death, love 
        and family."
