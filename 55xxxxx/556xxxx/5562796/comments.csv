,Sabre_of_Pain,2010-06-03T03:22Z,when i try to run the game the screen turns black and a bunch of lights start flashing on my monitor and my motherboard it sort of looks like its doing some kind of system compatibility check (even though it didn't say so beforehand) but i left it for like 20 mins and nothing changed

When I tried running it for the first time, the Ubisoft screen was displayed asking me to login, which I did, as soon as I logged in, it asked me for the CD Registration Key that came with the software.  Is that key anywhere in the zipped files?  If so, can you tell me where to find it.  I thought it was located at the setup file, I saw a file name PRODUCTGUID and a bunch of numbers but it was not the right key.  Can you help me?"
