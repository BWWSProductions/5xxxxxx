,Dflect,2010-05-17T02:43Z,"I wish this could be true, but feels a bit shady i must admit, any chance of making ones own server so you can just run around perhaps try some things out a bit?"

when i run the launcher it automatically patched the game and then after that i tried to login after registering with both WoW and Blizzard and combining accounts but now i can't login. so i cleaned everything and tried again from the WoW Folder and it said this when trying to login #""Unable to Validate game version, this may be caused by file corruption""# Can you tell me wtf is going on here and what i can do to get this working plz, i hate to think this is a big 14GB fake.."
,johney101,2010-08-06T22:09Z,"lol...
You are not supposed to use this on the official realms. Do a hash check of the torrent and use WoW.exe to start the game. Also make an account at www.lolomgwtfbbq.info ."
,murrambingi,2010-08-14T18:22Z,"Ahh ok it is done, but there is no-one online, i am running around and also checking for other players and it says that there are no players wtf is going on, this game is boring without online play..."
