This is the Backup DVD for the Acer Aspire 3610 series Laptop.

This is a standard ISO file, and should burn with ANY ISO burning software.

This is COMPLETE with Windows XP Home, and everything that is installed onto the laptop on the day it comes out of the box.

This doe NOT have an XP licence key, But if you install it on a the  correct computer, you will not need to authenticate it or insert a licence key.

It DOES NOT make recocovery partitions or hidden partitions.  However, It does install ALL default programmes and Drivers.

Please share and seed this, as it has been difficult to get hold of, and a lot of people want it.

Maybe. some one with the know how could inform me how to make this disk make the partitions on the disk. If so, I will share the info as well.

Thank You.

Feedback would be appreciated.
