"The Bob Next Door"

Bart becomes convinced that his new neighbor, Walt, 
is his archenemy, Sideshow Bob (guest voice 
Grammer), disguised and back for revenge. But when 
Marge tries to convince Bart otherwise by taking 
him to visit the state penitentiary, a disturbing 
truth is revealed.

Enjoy :)
