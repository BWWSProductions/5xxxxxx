Hate steam being slow?

here is my backup of portal from may 14th, 2010.

this obviously won't be all the files, since new updates are released every day; but keep in mind, once you restore it, it will grab the necessary files from steam, which isn't as bad as downloading the whole game.

this is a legitimate steam version, so you need steam, and you need to own portal.

this is backup, not a hack or crack for it.
there are none of those in this upload.
