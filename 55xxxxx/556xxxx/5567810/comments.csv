You throw this file onto a usb stick or an SD card and just plug it into the Nbox, and it plays great.
Look it up , or just put mkv player into Ebay... it will bring all sorts up from about $30 upwards.
ENJOY ! "

If you have any.... But you last post was good , well done boy.
And i wasnt selling ANYTHING... i dont sell those boxes, i just bought one and its awesome for watching these torrents on your tv...so i was trying to share that info with people who might not have a DVD burner or have the knowledge of how to get this onto their TV.
Chill out and read properly smegger ! "
