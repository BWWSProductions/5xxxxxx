The supergroup called KGB, from the initials of Ray Kennedy - vocals, Barry Goldberg on keyboards and Mike Bloomfield on guitar never really made it. The band had a rhythm section of Rick Grech on bass & Carmine Appice on drums. Grech and Bloomfield immediately quit after the debuts release, stating they never had faith in the project. The album was not well received, but it did contain the standout track "Sail On, Sailor".
