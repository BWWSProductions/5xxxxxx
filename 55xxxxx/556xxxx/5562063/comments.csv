,Thinyman,2010-05-17T00:00Z,"sorry guys, when i put some trackers, probably some of them require pass. Sorry,
i Just changed the trackers to just : 
http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

udp://tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

if there are problems like these, please notify me . I hope everything is gonna be ok ."
,Thinyman,2010-05-17T01:42Z,i can see now that the upload speed is 40-50 :) 
,TheSpenner,2010-05-22T21:06Z,"So is this thing dead? After nearly a week the seeder's only sent out like 12%. Bummer since it's the highest-bitrate version around, short of the 30-40GB uncompressed blurays. Would've been nice."
,Thinyman,2010-05-22T21:53Z,"it's not dead, If you want just don't download it .

I've noticed that a torrent with such a good quality isn't available and i decided to upload it , but still if its too big for you - leave it .

The speed is low because , so far no one has yet downloaded it ."
,Thinyman,2010-05-22T21:55Z,And i'm so far the only source . So far according to my bittorent client i have uploaded 3-4 Gigs.
,Thinyman,2010-05-24T20:01Z," so far 13 people are on their 30th per cent of downloading .
although slow, still connections still exists .

Once these first 13 ppl have completed their download, you understand that (if they continue to upload ,of course !!!) for the  rest of you it would be faster ."
,shabadoo01,2010-06-06T21:49Z,"i'm having a little trouble with my download.  The audio functions perfectly, the way its supposed to.  But the video while definitely looking like a bluray is very choppy and really doesn't stream all that well.  Got any idea how to fix?"
,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:52Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
,Thinyman,2010-07-31T22:03Z,"To shabadoo01 - did you use Arc Soft Theater media player ,its in my profile, before i tried many player ,but only Arc Soft Theater plays is good - no problems with video or sound "
