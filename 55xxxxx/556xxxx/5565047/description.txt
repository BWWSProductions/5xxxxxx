Abraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM DVDRip+MP3 from 5 VHSs

These avi files are rips from DVDs that are made from â€œConversations with Abrahamâ€ VHS tapes. My intention with this avi files was to reduce size of files to the minimal without noticeable lost of sound and picture quality. I used vob files from Abraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD torrent.

The avi quality and size was achieved by adjusting brightness, contrast, saturationâ€¦ and cropping the picture by 4% to 8% (to remove the disturbing tape noise). Result: The experience when watching the avi files seem to be a better than when watching the vob files.

There are 9 sessions on 5 VHS tapes. Each DVD rip is a session, therefore there are 9 avi files and 9 mp3s. 

Some audio of these recordings goes up and down on the vob files but I have adjusted some of it in mp3 rips and trimmed the beginnings and the ends where video is needed to understand what is going on. 

This and some other materiel was a result from a request for a Group-Buy at

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abrahamâ„¢ are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

â€œThe thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.â€

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham â€” whom Esther calls â€œinfinite intelligenceâ€ and Jerry refers to as â€œthe purest form of love Iâ€™ve ever encountered.â€
