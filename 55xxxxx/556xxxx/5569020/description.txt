This action-packed fantasy takes place twelve thousand years ago, an undreamed-of
age before recorded history filled with fantastic kingdoms across an uncharted
world. An age of superstition and myth populated by mystical wizards and menacing
creatures, this Hyborian Age spawned a true hero, Conan. With the aid of ragtag
warriors Otli, Bayu and Zzeban, he quests to free his homeland from the rule of an
all-powerful sorcerer and deals with beautiful, fiery bandit queen Karella.
