We Are Scientists will release their fourth and by all accounts best studio album, Barbara, on June 15th 2010. The album follows the We Are Scientists rock music brand by including beat-driven, melody-wrapped, harmony-draped, lyrically-savvy tracks. W.A.S. is Keith Murray and Chris Cain. On Barbara, the duo recruited a brand new set of hands and feet behind the drum kit in the shape of Master Andy Burrows (ex-Razorlight drummer). 
With Barbara, devoted We Are Scientists fans will hear a record that more closely resembles With Love & Squalor in its tendency to sound like three guys playing, singing and drinking and, very occasionally, cussing. Recent converts will appreciate the continuation of melodic and lyrical trends begun on Brain Thrust Mastery. Barbara features efficient pop singles like "Rules Don't Stop" and "Nice Guys", as well as expansive harmonic adventures such as the tracks, "Pittsburgh" and "Foreign Kicks."
