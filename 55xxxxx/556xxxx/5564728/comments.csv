,hkoraddi,2010-05-15T17:31Z,its out so soon thanks man
,lilars26,2010-05-15T20:00Z,As good as any other samples I have seen.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-15T20:45Z,"@lilars: Well, it is domain ""whose shit has more vitamins"".
LU's CAM has almost inaudible audio and totally wrong aspect-ratio - characters appears ""taller"" (2.25/1 AR).
On iND's prank no need to waste the words.

All four CAM's are equally bad, but at least, one can spare few nickles by downloading [quark] instead of 800MB or 1.4GB for Russian flickering epileptic-seizure-inducing crap."
,believenu,2010-05-15T21:03Z,I have tried sample and am now d/l. not bad for a cam as you say better than russian***. will seed as seeding is sharing.. thank you for your efforts on our behalf
,viedma,2010-05-15T21:12Z,"C´MON, FELLAS, ITS IN MY OPINION V7/A8, IT´S PERFECTLY WATCHABLE AND ONLY 200 MEGAS... I WISH MANY MORE WOULD OFFER THIS KIND OF QUALITY AND FAST DOWNLOAD, PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY EXCEPT FOR THE EXQUISITE... AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF THEY WERE ALL LIKE THIS, I´D BE IN HEAVEN. THANKS A LOT AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."

Next time, please, read what has been written by uploader. Most times there is no real need for you to reiterate or to repeat or to modify what has been told. However, I do sympathize with your need to be heard."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-16T13:54Z,"@Demise69: That torrent is Lineage. Part I.
You should do Google - not me."
