
DO NOT download if you watch on high resolution TV or monitors.
NOT for handhelds or phones, just computers. 
Playable in VLC, WMP and MPC with CoreCodec and DivX 7 AAC DShow filter, 
mplayer, KMplayer and of course, in QuckTime Player.
However, picture is better than 90% of CAMs and definitely watchable. Goal was "preview" quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).
For example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set. Not to force you, but take my advice regarding watching seriously.

NOTE: It is first English spoken CAM. Watchable, but overall bad.
      DO NOT burn your money. [quark] is good enough for this generation of R.H CAMs.
      And... sorry to break someone's bubble - but 
      so called TS appeared today is a - prank.
      Plain and ugly CAM...
