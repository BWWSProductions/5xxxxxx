,techcluse,2010-05-14T05:40Z,My first torrent - feel free to give feedback. I found this video somewhere else and noticed there were no torrents with this movie at 720p with active seeders.

Everyone avoid this movie or avoid actually buying this movie!
They changed all the music from the dvd version and added some stupid LAME tracks!

I don't know who did the subtitle, it's good but annoying. Half the time it says ""[SPEAKING IN THAI]"", how many f**ing times will it tell us that? When the movie is a thai movie!

The video/picture quality is not what I call HD. It's basically upscaled to a high quality so you won't see any sharp details or vibrant details.

I don't know what they did to the Thai audio but it's weird, it feels like they are speaking in a studio.


Thank you for uploading, now I know I won't have to waste my money on this piece of trash.
Problem now is I have to seed this sh* back:/

I'll advice people to stick with the DvD version instead. It has better music and quality even though it's not in HD."
