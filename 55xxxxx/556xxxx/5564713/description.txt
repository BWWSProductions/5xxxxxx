After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.

So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
                      
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	      
                
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	                   
   
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                   
   
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce                   
   
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce                   
   
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce                   
   
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                     


Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 

Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 

Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

I've searched long for a DVD version of Tommy by Ken Russell with subtitles.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)

but I found only a good 7GB DVD torrent with no subtitles.
So I did it myself:
I found the english subtitles on Internet, but I had to resynchronize them completely and add several lines that were omitted or truncated.
I demuxed the DVD and rebuilt it adding a menu and the subs. 

There you have it:

PAL


English  audio
English, Italian subs


It's an ISO, fitting a dual layer DVD.

The whole task was performed with free software available in Internet (VobEdit, DVD Lab Pro 2).

If somebody is interested to learn how to demux and rebuild a DVD, drop me a note and I will provide you help.

The output DVD works like a charm on my cheap DVD player on TV... So, enjoy :)
