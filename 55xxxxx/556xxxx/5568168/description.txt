Miami-based DJ/producer George Acosta began spinning records while in his
teens, emerging as a staple of the underground rave circuit thanks to his
appearances at clubs including the Omen, Le Boom, Mach 1, XS Frankfurt, 
the Shadow Lounge and the Love Parade. The founder of his own Waxhead 
Records label, Acosta remixed everyone from the B-52's to Ultra Nate in 
addition to issuing his own records, which include 1997's Miami Beach Bash,
Vol. 2 and 2000's Awake. The double series Release: AM Edition and Release:
PM Edition followed in early 2001. He and trance guru ATB collaborated on
Trance Nation America, Vol. 2 later that summer. Jason Ankeny, All Music
