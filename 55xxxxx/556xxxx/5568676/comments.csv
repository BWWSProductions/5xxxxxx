,gel_ooh,2010-05-17T06:46Z,please seeeeed!!  I can't wait for two weeks for it to be shown down here in Australia!!
,4finger,2010-05-17T09:42Z,"2 weeks before they show it to ausralia and they show it to thailand on cable tv now already , funny in thailand we have the show before austalia , sad for you , cool for thai"
,Jonathan.Bacon,2010-05-18T20:41Z,Just a heads up but they dont announce the winner at the end of this. You have to download the reunion to find out.... This was a pretty big deal for me since I didnt have the reunion downloaded and this one just ends....Im always giving props to eztv but this thing is a massive FAIL
,a8eoi,2010-05-25T15:57Z,"I couldn't agree more with Jonathan.Bacon. It ends right after they have voted and Jeff walks off after announcing the votes will be read in New York. Massive fail on eztv's behalf, and I think this is the first time I have ever thought this about eztv as they are usually brilliant with their uploads.

Currently downloading the Reunion episode now."
