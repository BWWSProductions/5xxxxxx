Here at RiffTrax, we've worked long and hard to try to make it as easy for you, 
the watcher/listener, to enjoy your RiffTrax experience.  After experimenting with 
many different methods, techniques and gimmicks, we feel confident in recommending 
the following method as the best way to ensure that your RiffTrax stays synched up 
with the DVD.  If drift should occur between RiffTrax and the DVD, we simply gauge 
how off the timing is, using the handy Disembaudio narrator, then pause the DVD 
or the RiffTrax, (which ever one is ahead, obviously), and then unpause after 
we feel an appropriate interval has passed, (usually no more than a second.)  
This can be repeated as many times as necessary.  It's not pretty, but it works 
darn well.

If your power goes out, or the phone rings, or you simply want to rewind the nude 
scenes, we've provided the below guides.  They breakdown the DVD's chapters, and 
indicate the timecode of each RiffTrax at the chapter markers.  This should make it 
easier for you to synch up the RiffTrax with the chapter you want to rewind to.

Please note that all times are approximate and should be used simply as a guide.
