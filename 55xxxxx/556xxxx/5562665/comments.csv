[T],Knaster,2010-05-15T04:42Z,"jordanfire ok good, write back plz if you find something out."
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-05-15T06:25Z,if you can find the language packs in the install directory if both russian and english are there dont delete the russian pack just try moving it out of the folder and see if the game loads the english language pack up 
,DikkatDeliVar,2010-05-15T14:34Z,"Thanks, gonna read the Russian description to see how to make it in English."
,Milkootje,2010-05-15T16:39Z,Hhahahahaa indeed very difficult that way ;)

,DikkatDeliVar,2010-05-16T22:03Z,"I definitely chose the English from the installation menu by 'Angliyskiy yazik' (English language), however the crack is only in Russian, so when you overwrite the gamedata folder, the game becomes Russian... Well, I can play with my poor Russian :P Thanks a lot :)"
,jordanfire,2010-05-17T03:34Z,"@knaster I got some buddies working on a patch atm. But, we haven't had too much luck . So far we;ve only got the savedata stuff translated, I have no idea if/when we'll be done. I'll keep posting any updates we have,"
,allex7,2010-05-17T08:16Z,"When i started installing ,the antivirus sais it has trojan, but it lets it continue installing saying that the virus has been blocked and my computer is safe :> so i guess it's ok ^^"
,jordanfire,2010-05-18T20:10Z,"@ allex7. 
this file is legit, I've scanned it with Kaspersky , Norton, and AVG. It's all good except for the Russian jargon that was mentioned earlier. I;m thinking you can change the language settings though..can anyone bring up an English instruction booklet?"
,jordanfire,2010-05-18T20:10Z,"pfft.never mind. It's in the readme that I didn;t bother reading,"

Except for the fact that there isnt nearly enough information to install the game theres on 1.24G\'s there should be around 3.65GiB. This also has a trojen AND All of his downlodes are \""Trusted\"" even though some of them like (Sniper: Ghost Warrior [PC] [DEMO]) and this one click his name ALL of his torrents are trusted. lol your not geting to me noobish your to much of a noob to hack me."
,TombRaiderAddict,2010-07-14T06:32Z,"ALL PEOPLE SAYING THIS DOESN\'T WORK ARE COMPLETE FUCKTARDS. nnThe Noobish has put alot of work into this, and it DOES WORK, NO VIRUSES, NOTHING.nnThe problem is that it is in RUSSIAN. And this is easily overcome.nnNow, when you download the files in the torrent, and run the setup, it is initially in Russian. However, a few screens across you\'re presented with a drop down menu in which you select the launguage. If you have Russian charecters installed on your system then it will appear as \'Aengelski\' or something like that. It is the only other option/second option on the drop down menu. YOU CANT MISS IT!nnChoosing this then Installing, mounting the image in Daemon tools (NOTE, When choosing the image to mount, YOU MUST take off daemon tools file filter to find the correct one, this is done by selecting All Files (*.*) at the drop down menu near the bottom) and selecting the file which is the biggest.)nnOnce this is done, Right click on the BattlefrontII.exe and run it. If it crashes on startup, run it in compatibility for windows 95. (from properties)nnIF IT DOESNT WORK AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD QUIT THE INTERNETS."
,halfchalupa,2010-07-14T22:33Z,Dude....i\'ve downloaded a couple things from you now that have made my anti-virus spring up.nnI\'m not sure why the hell this is even still seeded. this file i s apiece of shit tojan loader
,surrealedifice,2010-07-19T13:45Z,"Despite smaller seeder swarms I picked this up in about 20 minutes, and everything is working great.  Managed to work out the instructions Tombraideraddict gave, even if they're confusing as hell (Sorry man, no offense but telling ppl to quit the net after a run-on-sentence with random filler consonants made me lol)  Just do this.  

1)Run Setup.exe
2)Find the only pulldown menu in the russian installer, the enlish option is the second and only other option.
3)If you use Poweriso or something alternative to dameontools, just compile setup1, and 2 into a .daa or .iso file with your program, and mount it.  (The torrent didn't provide a no-cd crack, so you're riding old school.)
4)Copy and replace the Game Data folder into your game directory, and hopefully it should work.  

I hope this helps someone, GL and buy the game if you enjoy it!

(Like all cracked games, online play is for paying customers only)"

,{me},2010-09-09T01:48Z,"Quit ripping on thenoobish if you don't know what you're talking about. If your antivirus starts bitching, kick it to the curb or figure a work-around. If you aren't smart enough to figure out that a MULTI2 install that says ENGLISH + Russian in the description, is probably going to have a way to install in English, then please refrain from using the comment button. No one wants to hear you bitch about how you can't figure this or you don't know jack.
I haven't even downloaded this yet and I can already tell you:
NO VIRUS  (thats your crappy AV throwing false positives)
WORKS   (enough said, keep trying shit till you figure it out. First hand experience is the best way to learn)

If you are having problems with no audio, I have learned (with my super observational skill called reading) that you may need to update your audio drivers.

If you want to play online, go buy the game. It can't be more that $10 now. Or you can do some more of that reading stuff and research Hamachi.

Thanks for another much appreciated upload noobish."

,J-Razor,2010-10-12T09:34Z,OK I have Vista 64 bit and id like to make a suggestion. #1 there is no virus. The so called virus is just daemon tools.

I have dowlaoded the new version but it doesnt work cause the game is set up to auto run off of the one that he has installed. Can you update this or something.

,cheese_face,2011-04-05T18:42Z,Running perfectly on Windows 7 64-bit. Just make sure you install in English as explained above. This download uses daemon tools to avoid the CD check but if you just download a No-CD crack to replace battlefrontII.exe it'll run just fine. You can also delete daemon tools and the img folder after doing this to space a lot of space.

You'd think only lobotomised people are allowed on the internet these days.
