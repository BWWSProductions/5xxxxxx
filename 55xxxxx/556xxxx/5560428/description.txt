          Give Puddle of Mudd credit for the title of their fourth album Songs in the Key of   
          Love and Hate, as it makes plain their obsessions while dropping an offhand allusion 
          to Stevie Wonder and Leonard Cohen. Musically, Puddle of Mudd hasn't changed, ...    
          Full Descriptionstill playing Nirvana as if they were party music like Stone Temple  
          Pilots. POM manages to crank out a brute-force riffs that hook deeper than it has any
          right to, and there's amusement to hearing "Spaceship," "Keep It Together" and "Out  
          of My Way" play as the life cycle of a love affair with a stripper in its progression
          from sex to love to hate. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
