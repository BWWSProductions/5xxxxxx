Following a tumultuous year that included a highly publicized divorce from rapper Nas, the birth of her first child and numerous family court hearings, Kelis is finally back with a new label home, a new album and a new sound. Now signed to Interscope Records through will.i.am Music Group, she premiered the single "Acapella"-her first new material since 2006's "Kelis Was Here"-online in November. On the track, produced by David Guetta and inspired by her son, the New York-raised singer/songwriter takes her hip-hop-driven style in a more electronic/dance direction. Other songs on the anticipated eight-song project include "4th of July," produced by DJ Ammo; "Kids," inspired by homosexual clubgoers; the acoustic-guitar based "Carefree American," produced by Jean Baptiste; and "Alive," helmed by Diplo. Kelis is currently in the studio with label head Will.i.am.
