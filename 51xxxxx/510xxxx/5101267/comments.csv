,MagiciansFR,2009-10-08T09:00Z,"What am I doing wrong? I've installed the application, been forced to reboot, and immediately closed the app when it came up after reboot and then applied the key. No joy, says the trial period has expired, keeps saying that no matter how many times I apply the key. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling and running the keyfile before rebooting. Again, no joy. All I get is ""Trial period has expired! How do you make this darn thing work?"
,icansex,2009-10-10T19:23Z,im having the same problem
,azer000,2009-10-14T15:52Z,I'm having the same problem as well.
,fredpc,2009-10-18T10:43Z,Do a search for a file called anyDVD.chk and rename it to anyDVD.bak or something similar this should help registry issues  :)
,fredpc,2009-10-18T10:44Z,btw disable updates in settings 
,Timewarptwo,2009-10-24T04:14Z,I can't get this to work. I disabled updates and made sure it was not running in task bar. I also tried to install other anydvd torrents from TPB. 6.5.8.7 & 6.5.7.1 & 6.5.9.5 None these work. I keep getting a message that it is expired or have a few days left on trial period. I noticed that when I uncheck updates it becomes checked again automatically. A message pops up saying that since it is a trial version the defaults will be reset when you close the window. I also had no idea where to find the DVD.CHK to change it to DVD.BAK?? It is not in the program files thats for sure. I tried all of these versions about 3 times each. Installing then uninstalling. When I uninstalled I chose the option to delete ALL information and NOT save anything. Still no go. My only other thought is that something must be left behind in the registry which is not deleted when uinstalled making any other version after it read as a TRIAL version. I am running windows 7 64bit. Is there a registry removal/cleaning tool specifically for Any DVD???

you will have to delete the anydvd.chk file or delete it 
It is found in hidden files and folders  "
,fredpc,2009-11-12T10:52Z,"sorry or rename it to anydvd.bak  

the location is 
C:localdisc/programdata/slysoft/anydvd

hope this helps  :)"
