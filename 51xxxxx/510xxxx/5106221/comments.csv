[T],swebarb,2009-10-01T17:14Z,I can confirm from pspiso that this even works on my phat 5.00 m33-5 without any problems.. no need for GEN if u on it ;)
,khronicana,2009-10-01T19:29Z,Excellent. though I upgraded to 5.50 thinking I needed it for this. 
,GOD_UK,2009-10-04T13:41Z,The game works for me (CFW 5.00 M33-6) however the psp crashes on the second single player track.
,GOD_UK,2009-10-04T13:52Z,"Yea confirmed ""Snowgod canyon"" crashes your psp. "
,khronicana,2009-10-04T23:43Z,And I can confirm that if you have 5.50 gen-b2 everything works fine. And the only thing that stopped me from switching to 5.50 gen was lack of irshell support... which is now available via a patch. 
,neoz28,2009-10-09T05:37Z,everything works great for me on 5.00 m33-6
,AuRteam,2009-10-09T22:56Z,"Same here neoz28, Snowgod Canyon works perfect for me on my 5.00 M33-6 Phat PSP. Wonder why it isn't working good for other people..."
