,Zaak,2009-10-23T19:11Z,"After install the game, in a correct way. Start the game an a clock is showing and the game says loading... nothing more happens. How many hour needs game the game to be loaded?
If you have a game which not working, donÂ´t place it on Piratebay, OK?"
,broad_x14,2010-01-03T09:03Z,"Just because you cannot make it work, it doesn't mean it's not working.

Instead, it means you're a fucking incompetent noob.

Thanks for the upload!"

,xiIix,2010-08-15T07:41Z,"Is this even released yet? I'm confused. The release is TBA and the demo is 839MB. Is this a leak, or an insiders review copy?"
