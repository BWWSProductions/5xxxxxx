Science Fiction Secrets

Date: 09-16-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Nick Redfern, Joshua P. Warren

British ufologist and cryptozoologist Nick Redfern talked about his new book Science Fiction Secrets which probes the intertwining connections between works of fiction, and governmental secrecy & experiments, conspiracies, and the paranormal. 

Among the items he covered:

- Pres. Ronald Reagan, upon viewing Steven Spielberg's movie ET at the White House in 1982, was said to have whispered to the director that a handful of people in the room know how true this movie really was.

- Soviet leader Josef Stalin may have been inspired by reading the H.G. Wells' science-fiction novel, The Island of Dr. Moreau, when he created a project that attempted (unsuccessfully) to breed humans with apes, in order to create an invincible soldier.

- Another Wells novel, The Invisible Man, may have influenced the US military's secretive attempts to perfect invisibility for its warships in WWII, in what became known as the Philadelphia Experiment.

- Government documents at Fort Dietrich mention lethal alien viruses and plans of action, which are similar to the scenarios written about by Michael Crichton in his book The Andromeda Strain.

- The pilot episode of The X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen, featured a plot line similar to the 9-11 attacks, though the program aired seven months before the event (video clip).
- The FBI secretly spied on a number of science-fiction authors, including Philip K. Dick, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell. The US Air Force spied on 1950s filmmaker Mike Conrad, who claimed to be using real UFO footage shot in Alaska in his movie.

- Bernard Newman may have incorporated secret files about crashed discs in his 1948 novel, The Flying Saucer, which describes a "false flag" operation in which the military stages fake UFO crashes to bring the nations of Earth together.

- The British Ministry of Defence offered assistance to the BBC in its science-fiction TV series Invasion Earth in 1998, amid rumors they were trying to acclimatize the public to the alien presence.
