(Posted: August 14, 2009)  

Being trapped and confined has a lot of psychological effects, like the walls closing in. But when cherry sees the water level rising in her cell she knows it?s not in her head. she?s struggling enough to keep her head above water when PD decides to make things a lot more complicated. Here she is, just trying to survive, and he?s got her performing aquatic acrobatics for his pleasure. 

Of course being on dry land isn?t much better when PD is playing his games. He?s got her locked down into the floor with only her head and feet free. Of course the price of that freedom is the tortures they?ll endure. PD has electricity, fire and good old fashioned canes to make her day miserable and his that much better.
