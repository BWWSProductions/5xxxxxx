I like a large swarm as it helps with the heath of the torrent. Oh, and if thats too long for you you can always go down to the record store to buy a copy. Or find another FLAC of this album to download.

Better yet, go back to USENET. Torrent community doesn't need snivelling, whiny ass babies like you."
,shinemaster99,2009-10-08T08:22Z,"well, its ""ignorant thinking"" like this that actually got us to this point in the pirating world. now the fact that he has to comment like such a douche is whats wrong. but don't criticize the man for wanting fast downloads right away. thanks to impatient douches like this one, we may someday achieve such a goal. in conclusion i agree with all your comments, but they are all wrong. how is that for useless input? wow r u still reading? ur dumb..."
,shinemaster99,2009-10-08T08:25Z,this album rocks btw and I'm downloading from this torrent right away on limewire. Almost 300KB/s so i don't know what all the complaining is about anyways.
[T],rjordan21,2009-10-09T11:12Z,Kitlope.....Thanks again for the great torrent.  You rock man!

Just like all your other excellent stuff. Keep it up.

Question. If ""god"" is omnipotent, does he/she have a cock?"

,PTheD,2010-05-04T19:32Z,Is there a torrent of this album riped from the vinyl available anywhere?  Acording to this (http://popdose.com/cd-review-alice-in-chains-black-gives-way-to-blue/) review the vinyl version is lesser the victem of the Loudness Wars than the CD version.
,captorofsin,2010-06-01T14:02Z,I'm interested in finding a vinyl rip as well. The CD has no dynamic range!
,Wolfareon,2011-04-30T15:33Z,"Thanks ! 
I use 'swith sound file converter' to convert this FLAC to MP3 extention."
,pezed,2012-04-03T19:58Z,Thank You. I like all the extra info.
