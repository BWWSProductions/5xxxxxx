,leezaal40,2010-09-30T14:00Z,"Many thanks indeed.
I can also confirm it works perfectly, i also downloaded the official 1.02 patch with 5 extra cars and it installed fine as well. just copy over original game exe  apply patch included, download official 1.02 patch & install it if you want it.
Then copy over the 2 files in the crack folder and your good to go."
