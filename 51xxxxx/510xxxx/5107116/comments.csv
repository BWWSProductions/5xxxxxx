And I also thank you to appreciate what I created. 
And everyone else who takes part of this ""torrent"""
,Softlink,2009-10-02T15:07Z,What's here that's not in the Remastered series??
[T],torrentguiden,2009-10-02T16:13Z,"@ Softlink
Wish I could understand your issue now?"
,Softlink,2009-10-03T15:55Z,"My issue is:
Who needs this compilation when you can download the whole remastered series."
[T],torrentguiden,2009-10-03T16:08Z,"@ Softlink 
Well, it was what you meant, but where does the point of writing it? 
Are you not think this is a good thing, it's your choice! 
And one more thing to contribute something yourself instead of whining here :)"
,Softlink,2009-10-04T00:46Z,"Whining?? Ok.
Whatever makes you happy.
Tnx for placing the torrent.
Not for me but maybe for someone who thinks this is enough Beatles to have.
Keep smiling.  ;=P"
