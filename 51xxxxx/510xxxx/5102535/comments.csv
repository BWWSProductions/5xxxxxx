I hope everyone is well. This movie is in English with no available subtitles. The picture and the sound quality are of a very high standard. The movie is in a single file which runs for 2 hours, 50 minutes and 55 seconds.

This is a brilliant effort.


Thank you.
Pakistani Dragon

From what I have learned thus far, this movie is the best representation of the truth about Islam. With all that is going on in the world today and many people's misconceptions about Islam this is a must see for all.

Not only is it an educational masterpiece... The Message has a brilliant musical score, beautiful cinematography, a wonderful script, and terrific acting. If your video stores do not carry it, order it from Amazon.com and learn the truth about the origins of the worlds fastest growing religion and what it stands for. "
