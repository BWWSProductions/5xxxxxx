,rickstar,2009-09-28T08:40Z,"judging people is not kool and you should know that. Since no one has ever uploaded this movie, in dvdr format, it is a big deal because when u judge content, you also judge the people. 3.7 of us who like this kinda stuff, judge your attitude as a 2.4 "

[T],hjsn1,2009-09-29T16:44Z,"mikexxxryan: I don't care how good a movie is, I put the same amount of work into each one. This one was a request from a person that downloads movies from me frequently.  Also, there are 114 people downloading it from me as I type this, so if you don't want to download it, there are plenty of people that do. You must have too much free time on your hands to complain about good quality on something you don't want to download. Stop wasting my time and yours commenting on stuff you have no interest in and spend your time downloading something you want and stop bitching about stuff that doesn't interest you. 

daqck: Please elaborate on ""(if anything)(guess he gives gays a bad rep)"""

I was wondering if you could upload some of the movies in the nightmare on elm street movies, those are classics and i'd like to get my hands on them."
