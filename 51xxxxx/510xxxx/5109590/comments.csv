,9warbane89,2010-02-07T03:44Z,@Lord_Manslaughter - No you can't throttle the speeds. Much around with the settings and you might get better performance.

He/she probably didn't know that you have to unzip the file. To unzip files I recommend 7-Zip.

Good Torrent NOT FAKE. Playing Pokemon Heart Gold right now."
,Sm0knFly420,2010-03-17T02:24Z,"NO$ZOOMER.EXE contains Malware, AVG had to completely remove the file, making it unusable. Don't download."
,9warbane89,2010-03-21T09:30Z,I just want to let everyone know that Sm0knFly420 is also a retard.
,bumbata19,2010-03-30T19:09Z,Works perfect for me thanks 9warbane89.
,bigggdan,2010-04-08T09:30Z,"avg removed it because avg sucks, get good antivirus like Avast."
,shiftygoescrazy,2010-04-09T04:57Z,Avg is not a virus scanner m8 LOL
,eastwickkidd908,2010-04-10T08:38Z,how do you seed stuff?
,Robbin123,2010-04-22T13:17Z,"The emulator works fine, I downloaded pokemon heartgold and soulsilver in another torrent, they work fine but whenever I try to save the game no$zoomer crashes. 

Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong or how I fix it?"
,yamaruxninja,2010-05-02T02:09Z,"lmao @ Sm0knFly420

it's perfectly fine.. great upload thanks 9warbane89."
,9warbane89,2010-05-06T14:21Z,"@ Sm0knFly420

It's clearly a false positive. Get a real anti virus program."
,Shealtyl,2010-05-06T22:01Z,"uhm guys i downloaded this and Avast says it contains Malware, u guys sure it's a false positive??"

,Spacecow96,2011-03-28T09:33Z,"I did find malware(using avg), so I removed it, but it only removed the zoomer. The emulator still worked fine.

,Dushanth,2011-11-03T01:58Z,How do you link two games together?
,mvkprincey,2011-11-12T05:34Z,nozoomer has a trojan in it and its the same no$gba you can download off the website cant save DS games but can save reg. gba games
,PikachuCLS,2012-01-20T23:12Z,"Really good torrent. I found this a long time ago (2010?) But then the stupid flash drive failed on me, so I had to find it again! Hey, don't use AVG, its full of BS. Even the most sensitive but good antiviruses like Norton won't pick it up as a virus."
,bombay43,2012-06-11T01:32Z,I'm having a problem opening the select menu.  For some reason when I hit select or start nothing happens. Anything I can do?
