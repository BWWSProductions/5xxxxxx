The Taming of the Shrew
by William Shakespeare



This hearty comedy has always been a favourite with audiences. Three suitors pursue Bianca Minola, but her father won't let her marry until her older sister, Katherine, is married. Kate is wilful, loud, volatile and above all, shrewish. Her suitor Petruchio is stern, jolly, and somewhat odd. A match made in heaven? 

The play has an all-star cast including Bob Peck, Cheryl Campbell, Moira Leslie, Robert Glenister, Stephen Tompkinson, Douglas Hodge, Christopher Fairbank, Michael Deacon, Anthony Jackson, Willam Simons, John Badley, and Paul Copley.

Music composed by Mia Soteriou.
