Sweet Home 3D

Sweet Home 3D is free software designed to draw the plan of a home, arrange furniture, and display the result in a 3D view. It's aimed at people who want to design their interior quickly. The user may:

* draw the walls of his rooms upon the image of an existing plan

* change the color or the texture of the walls, the floors, and the ceilings

* drag and drop doors, windows, and furniture onto the plan from a catalog

* organize by categories, and import user-created or downloaded 3D models

* change the size, orientation, and elevation of each piece of furniture

* view the changes in the plan simultaneously in the 3D view, either from an aerial view point, or from a virtual visitor view point

* draw dimensions, compute areas, and add text to the plan

* print the home plan and the 3D view or export them to a PDF file

* export the plan to SVG format, and the 3D view to OBJ format

* compute a photorealistic image from the 3D view and export it in PNG format
