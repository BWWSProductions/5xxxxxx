Ep Summary:

Singapore.
Jake Humphrey presents live coverage of the Singapore Grand Prix, the 13th of
the 17 races in this year's championship. Singapore hosted the first ever night
race last year and it was judged a huge success. Renault's Fernando Alonso would
certainly agree with that, having scored his first win of the season on the Marina
Bay circuit. As usual, Jake is joined by F1 experts Eddie Jordan and David Coulthard,
who was seventh in last year's Singapore race.
