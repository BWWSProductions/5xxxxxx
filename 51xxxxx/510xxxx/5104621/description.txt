At least, until one day.. when he suddenly receives a gift from his internet friend named "Mr.K.". It turns out the gift is a machine capable of hypnotism.. but Yuta is such an extraordinary guy with such a bright future, he couldn't possibly come up with anything devious to use a machine like that for.
