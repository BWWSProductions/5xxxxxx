Gravity is a rhythm driven band that lays down instrumental grooves combining a range of different musical genres and influences. A sonic balance is achieved by infusing elements of funk, hip-hop, dubstep, and drum 'n' bass. The music is structured while allowing space for spontaneous shifts in rhythm and melody. The result is an intriguing blend of improvisation and composition that provides a framework for electric live shows.
