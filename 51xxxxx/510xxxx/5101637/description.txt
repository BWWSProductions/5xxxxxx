"Funhouse" is a song written by Pink, Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry and it has been confirmed as the fourth (fifth in Australia and New Zealand) worldwide single from her fifth studio album, Funhouse. The track was produced by Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry. 

The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered on June 20, 2009 in the United Kingdom on 4music at 11:00am. Tony Kanal of No Doubt, also the co-writer and the producer of the song, appears in the music video, playing a piano. References to the lyrics are made, like "I'm gonna burn it down" and "But now it's full of evil clowns", showing a burning set and "Evil Clowns", respectively.

The video takes place in an barren lot that is later shown to be what's left of a house that is still burning. There are 'evil clowns' throughout the area who are picking though the rubble and playing the instruments as the band.
