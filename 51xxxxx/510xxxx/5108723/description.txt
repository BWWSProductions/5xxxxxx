After the release of Prairie Wind in 2005, Swedish TV did a special on Neil Young.
A 7 min teaser was sent in the fall, and then a longer program was sent in
the beginning of 2006.
This clip includes the teaser as well as the full interview joined together.

The interview is in English but the speaker is in Swedish.

Enjoy!
