
This artfully rendered Jeong Brothers horror story follows a man and his wife who investigate a string of murders, a medical student who is taunted by horrifying visions of a dead girl, and a child who is haunted by the ghosts of her late parents. Nothing is what it seems in this chilling tale of fractured love, set in a small Korean hospital of a bygone era and tucked beneath a tapestry of tortured souls. Bo-kyeong Kim and Tae-woo Kim star.
