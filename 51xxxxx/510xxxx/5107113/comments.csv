,Tripgnosis,2009-10-02T16:50Z,"For some reason this doesn't include the new and current tracker that TPB uses...

Add this tracker:
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

I was under the impression that TPB automatically added this tracker to newly uploaded torrents, even if the uploader doesn't include it.....

You could probally get rid of any trackers that end with *piratebay.org, but it doesn't necessarily hurt to keep em in there. Who knows, maybe those will be used again someday..."
,Tripgnosis,2009-10-02T17:34Z,"BTW, in case you're wondering...

The reason they switched what tracker they're using is so that torrents are using a tracker that is not dependant on TPB. This way torrents can stay active no matter what happens specifically to TPB - such as change of ownership. (I got this from the forums.) A pretty good progressive idea IMO...

Sorry for the double posts, I am leaving now ;)"
,giggedyguy,2009-10-03T18:28Z,Thanks. Wondering why other torrents weren't working for me.
