Thanks for the up."

You are right somehow it converted it twice so that the file was double the size it should be.Will have to do again now as i deleted the downloaded file.Thanks"
,robbo86,2009-09-27T14:46Z,Its done the same thing again and come out at 5.19GB.This is the only download this has happened to.?????????????????????????
,Caspers_Ghost,2009-09-27T16:25Z,"Hi All, about Re-Enccoding for Newbies

 This movie is Two and a half hours long. Most are 2 or less. Any two hour file should convert to a standard 4.3Gig DVD on Standard Settings.
 This 2-1/2 Hour Movie WILL NOT convert to a standard DVD on standard settings without some type of compression... (Or Dropping The Recording Settings to Long Play...etc)
 Here's a simple trick I figured out that seems to work out well for me... I went ahead and let it convert on standard settings resulting in a 5.19Gig folder. I then ran that folder through good ole DVD-Shrink which then took it down to 4.3 without adding artifacts. Turned Out Great!

DVD-Shrink can be found easily for Free.
Yes it is time consuming to process twice but the results are worth while at least for me...

Hope This Helps !!!"
,robbo86,2009-09-27T18:34Z,"Hi all im not a newbie at all.tThanks for all your help .Anyway,I use easy dvd creator to convert from divx to dvd files and then run through clone dvd which puts to dvd for me and shrinks if need be.Ijust cannot understand why its coming out at 5.19GB.When i first convert i notice that where usually i would get 2 files i could put to dvd i am getting doubles of each file(if that makes sense).For instance the first half of the film will show up twice as will the second half of the film.As i said earlier this is the first time this has happened to me over the years and is very strange indeed."
