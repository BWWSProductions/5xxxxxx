ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Although Kirk Franklin's career already has shaped the faces of gospel, R&B, and contemporary Christian music irreversibly, his relentless drive to bring glory to God has not slowed. Similar to 1998's monumental Nu Nation Project, 1NC (One Nation Crew) is an extraordinary design of unity and praise. Comprising 10 culturally diverse vocalists, 1NC both bridges gaps and breaks boundaries by fusing South African and Latin American sounds with R&B, gospel, praise, and pop influences. With each song a new adventure, this project takes the musical scenic route, visiting heated urban grooves and intimate vocal showstoppers. While all but one of the 13 tracks were written by Franklin himself, the fervor and honesty displayed by the vocalists unquestionably demonstrates ownership in heart and soul. Including spoken-word interludes between some of the cuts, the Christ-centered vision of 1NC visits spiritual and social issues with sincerity and jubilation.
