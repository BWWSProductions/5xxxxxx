Spiricom & EVP

Date: 09-25-09
Host: Art Bell
Guests: Stephen Rorke, Joe Meyer

Due to technical difficulties caused by a tropical storm in the Philippines, Art Bell was live for only the first half of Friday's show. In hour one, financial advisor Joe Meyer provided an update on the current economic meltdown. Then, Art spoke with paranormal investigator Dr. Stephen Rorke about Spiricom and Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) during the second hour. The final two hours were a replay from 10/5/03, featuring Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Heiser.

Art will continue his interview with Dr. Rorke on October 23, 2009. They will be discussing the work of the late Ralph Rene, who wrote extensively about the lunar-landing hoax theory.
