CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - SEPTEMBER 2009
        ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

New tracks by: Alex Metric, Yppah, Pete Yorn & Scarlett Johansson, The
Drums, Air and Sufjan Stevens. Plus, as usual, great remixes: YACHT
remixes Wolfmother's latest single, Freeland remixes Metric, Boards of
Canada remixes Beck, and more.

This month's playlist has a different, spacier sound than usual. Whether
it's a good "different" or not is up to you to decide -- let me know what
you think!
