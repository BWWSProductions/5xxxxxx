The other version here doesn't have a crack or serial.  Also worthless.  Better to use the Laxity version http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5090518/AllMySongs_Database_v1.1_WinAll-LAXiTY_[BeLLBoY]"

The license name and code are in the readme.txt file. The GAOTD Setup obviously works in the day of submission only, but the other setup is working also today. The Portable version has been built using Thinstall and it should write with no problems on your PC, even if I haven't tested it wery much yet."
