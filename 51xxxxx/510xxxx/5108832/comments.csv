,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-10-03T19:36Z,English? or lame Russian?
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-10-04T02:32Z,"I say its lame cos' a very few people in the world talk exclusively russian, about 70% of the world or so can speak english.
And about 90% of the people who visit this page speaks English!
Russian FTL"

help me if u can guys and thanks"
,whiskhot,2009-10-05T04:20Z,"Otomachi,i think you for trying to help me.Fortunately,directx 11 is also available on Vista.They didn't make the same mistake they did with directx10 only on Vista...
When you say highest,do you mean maximum?And if you don't do,what happens?"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-10-05T05:21Z,"This game is horrible, thanks for the upload Spanish dudes. 2005 Graphics (I set them all on high, not maximum, it wont look much better though), horrible gameplay, weird start and no tutorial"
,martinw2008,2009-10-06T22:31Z,"For me, it's currently the best game of this year.
It's the only game that creates a true apocalyptic atmosphere."
,mexanic,2009-10-07T19:05Z,"Is there anything to be done to stop crash to windows right before the Prypiat?
Did anybody who downloaded actually finished the game? "
,xMrAx,2009-10-07T21:42Z,Apparently there is a patch not sure though. Anyway. Would like this torrent more if there wasn't all the junk files.
,xMrAx,2009-10-07T22:00Z,By the way any confirmation that this one works with vista?
,MasaX,2009-10-08T01:35Z,"My mouse keeps getting stuck in the top left corner of the screen whenever I go into a menu.  If I move my mouse it will move but then quickly be pulled back to the top left like there's a freaking mouse magnet up there, it's completely unplayable.  I would guess it has something to do with my settings I set it to, since I didn't have this problem initially.  I will have to reinstall and try again later since I can't get into the settings now.  Also, the translation is pretty bad and parts aren't even translated at all.  Also it'd be better if they wouldn't translate Strelok to Shooter, that's just stupid."
,MasaX,2009-10-09T04:10Z,"Can anyone tell me how to fix my mouse ""bug"" ?"
,mexanic,2009-10-09T14:09Z,"To Otomachi Thank you, found it , trashed repack version, installed licenzia version, skipped verification, copy-paste: tadaaaaa.
All savegames work, all fine. But if you dont read russian, tough shit, hard to figure it out.Thanks for posts."
,platekbyslaw,2009-10-09T16:06Z,"Hi. I've a problem, I downloaded and unpacked the game , but when i try to start, it show only comunicat about missing d3dx9_41.dll. please help someone !!!"
,MasaX,2009-10-10T03:55Z,I figured out the mouse problem.  Just make sure the resolution in-game and the resolution on your desktop are the same.
,Disco8,2009-10-11T06:29Z,"Yeah Im getting the same ""d3dx9_41.dll"" error after trying to start the game. Anyone have any idea how to fix this?"
,drpb,2009-10-12T14:42Z,"The DLL is DirectX. Install the newest version (or as new as it wants).


OR... just get the dll from dll-files sites and put it in the local folder

OR, OR... search for it on your PC, it might already be in another game folder somewhere..."
[T],swebarb,2009-10-12T18:08Z,this is already cracked and can work on xp 32bit?
,seedMeister,2009-10-13T17:05Z,HAS ANYONE FOUND WHERE THE KEYS FOR THE POISON GAS ARE???????
,Mr_Bigglesworth,2009-10-13T19:46Z,"!!!the d3d dlll problem fix!!! if you dont have dx9c installed EVEN if you have dx10 it can still error dxd?_37.dll, or missing the file for directx9. I installed dx9 on a dx10 system and it fixed. I think microsoft has online updater, 2 minutes."

,Delfistyaosani,2009-10-22T16:18Z,"Hey there... did anyone go to the Prypiat town without a crash? I have PlayBay repack and everything worked like charm but when trying to go to the town game crashes without any errors or ""BugTrap"" messages, so I'm searching for a working release.

What about Russian language I would tell, that STALKER in English is kinda james bond ordering a ""maskovskaia vodka"" instead of martini :D I fu wanna feel the game, gotta speak RUS."
,Lucky13s,2009-10-24T00:33Z,"For everyone with the Pripyat Crash:
Download the new crack. 
The old crack (The one that comes with this game) was bad, get the new one that fixes that bug.

For everyone having d3dx9.dll problems:
d3dx9 mean Direct 3d X 9 (Directx9). You're either out of date (windows XP and below) or you have Direct3dx10/11 (Vista/Win7).

Direct x10/11 come stock with Vista/Win7 and most people haven't bothered to download directx9 since they already have 10 or 11. The default settings for this 'pirated copy' of the game are in directx9. (If you used an ISO on the other hand, it would have detected your directx10 and set it to default on that)

To fix your problem, download the latest Directx 9c, install it (it wont removed directx10/11).

Then when you've launched the game, set the renderer to directx10.

-OR-

Change the default from Direct3dx9 to Direct3dx10.

Go to: ""C:\users\public\docume~1\stalke~1.-""

Open ""user.ltx"" with notepad. 

Scroll down to where it says ""renderer renderer_r#.##""
change it to ""renderer renderer_r3""

(r3 = Street Lighting (Dx10), r2.5 = Dynamic Lighting (Dx9), r2=static lighting, etc.)"
,mc-ak,2009-10-24T21:17Z,"Hey guys, i fixed my dll issue cuz i have win7 x64,
but when i tried to run the game, the splash screen come up, and the black screen come up, then a god forsaken error come up as well.. it says: your video card does not meet the game requirements, but i got a 9800 gx2 and it rapes games like this, i got the newest evga driver that supports win7 x64.. any suggestions??"
,mc-ak,2009-10-24T21:21Z,actually.. i downloaded the newest dx9 and it fixed it.. but in the options menu why is detailed texture blanked out?? and also where can i find the newest no cd crack?
,Minbargen,2009-10-27T20:08Z,I still have no idea how to get this going. Can anybody give or find a full start to finish tutorial? I'm so lost.
,tangariatto,2009-10-30T19:10Z,"hi guys, im having an issue.

cant get it to work in dx10, i've tried just about everything but the dx10 features are stillblacked out in the advanced options menu.

i've manually downloaded dll's i though could be missing and changed render render2.5 in the user.ltx to 3

anyone got any ideas. it bugs the crap out of me
and im using Windows 7 64bit"
,TTKRickJames,2009-11-03T21:59Z,"I cant get the game to run on Windows 7 x64

Which I find extremely odd, considering SOC and CS run perfectly fine on my rig:
E6850 @ 3.6 Ghz
8 Gb DDR2 
GTX 260 core 216 Superclocked


the game uns fine on my XP sp3 partition, but i would rather play it on win7, so i can get max textures and dx 10. as well as not of to restart my PC just to play Stalker.

As far as i can tell by googling the issue im the only one."
,TTKRickJames,2009-11-03T22:12Z,"^^^^ 
sorry for double post, I forgot to mention that it just hangs forever at the splash screen, with 50% cpu load and about 25mb of ram used, also i have tried both the cracks available and the mini img
installed a shit load  of Dx9 files dating as far back as 2006, .net framework. Old video drivers, nothing will fix the game hanging at the splash screen on my desktop."
,saintzy2,2009-11-09T16:24Z,"The game works, but it's half english and half russian. The english part is also faulty. I respect you for trying, but i wouldn't suggest this."
,Bukkake0,2009-11-16T20:27Z,"So how do i install this?, ive been trying to figure it out for a long time"
,mmsandi,2010-01-24T15:48Z,I did unzip it and started .exe but it asks for key ...anybody?
,altairx26,2011-04-22T14:43Z,"what is the game version?
v.1.6.00 or v.1.6.0.2?"
