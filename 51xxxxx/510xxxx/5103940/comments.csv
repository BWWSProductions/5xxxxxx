,Saberus,2009-09-30T13:32Z,again switched channels.. and btw 720p rips works fine
,Saberus,2009-09-30T13:34Z,maybe don't touch the audio and compress only video :P?
,Saberus,2009-09-30T13:36Z,"too bad that i deleted the 720p source, then i can merge sound with mkvmerge ehh.."
[T],teslaman,2009-10-02T01:49Z,Well that would lower the video bitrate considerably. But what do you mean by switched channels? This time I checked it and the audio was on the Right channel so I moved it to center. And it played center on my system.
[T],teslaman,2009-10-02T02:03Z,*the voice audio that is.
[T],teslaman,2009-10-02T05:36Z,"Ok so here's the channel order chart I found:
5.1 WAV FL , FR , FC , LFE, SL , SR 
5.1 AC3 FL , FC , FR , SL , SR , LFE 
5.1 DTS FC , FL , FR , SL , SR , LFE 
5.1 AAC FC , FL , FR , SL , SR , LFE 
5.1 AIFF FL , SL , FC , FR , SR , LFE

Now the MKV with AC3 uses:
FL , FR , FC , LFE, SL , SR
Which according to the chart is wrong

My AVI with AC3 uses:
FL , FC , FR , SL , SR , LFE
Which according to the chart is correct

However, I just demuxed the 720p ac3 and muxed it with my avi, both the 720p audio and mine play correctly on my system with voice on center......lol.

See this time Center was labeled Right after decompression, so I fixed the labeling, which should allow proper playback, which on my system it did. But from now on I will also make sure it follows the same order as well since some systems must not work as good."
