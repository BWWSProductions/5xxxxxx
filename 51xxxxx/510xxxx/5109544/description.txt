BOOK REVIEWS:	

The Art of Agile Development is one of my best books in a long time. I've read a lot of Extreme Programming and Agile Software Development books and this one really nails it. Many are too theoretical, vague, or just plain developer-centric. This book however is of real practical value to everyone in the team: customers/business analysts, testers, and developers alike.

The book builds around 37 agile development practices in five categories: Thinking, Collaborating, Releasing, Planning, and Developing. Respective examples of practices are: Energized Work, Ubiquitous Language, No Bugs, Vision, and Incremental Design & Architecture. It's obvious that the authors are experienced practitioners as the text is littered with symptoms of common problems and remedial advice. Each practice has a clear explanation, answers to common questions, results you should expect to see, and when to and when not to adopt the practice given your current environment.

As a developer I'm finding this book invaluable. It's helped me think and communicate far more succinctly and effectively - even for material I was intimately familiar with. It's also a book that's accessible to everyone in and outside the team. In short, this is a great book.
