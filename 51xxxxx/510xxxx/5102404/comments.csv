,Jaliya,2010-01-05T17:58Z,"I had no trouble putting the .dmg together and running the install, but it asks for a registration. Do I have to worry about that -will it quit working after a time, or what? "

,egarc01,2010-01-23T04:37Z,I downloaded already and i dragged it into UnRAR. I also opened the DMG file and installed. It told me it needed to restart so I did that too. Now where is it? 
,fstarf1,2010-03-02T02:08Z,looking at everyones comments i think i'll pass on this one.
,Mojo_66,2010-08-21T01:18Z,Works on a Dell Inspiron 1501 Hackintosh w/ 10.5.8. When asked for a registration...CLICK LATER...some ppl are really stupid...if it doesn't fit on a DVD...install it from a HDD...but...why put the DMG into 46 RAR and put ppl through the hassle of downloading software etc just to save 113 Mb of data...? Well thanks for sharing anyways :-)
