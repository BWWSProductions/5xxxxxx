I don't know why they picked the title "Country Collection" for this CD. Kris is considered a country artist (although he treads the borders of rock and folk as well), but this is not a collection of his most 'country' songs. Rather this CD combines two of his lesser known albums, "Repossessed" from 1986 and "Third World Warrior" from 1990. - - - - - Although his music was always political, this period is when it was the most explicitly so. Shipwrecked in the Eighties" was dedicated to the Vietnam vets. "They Killed Him" is about all those activists who were assassinated (King, Ghandi, Christ). The other songs on "Repossessed" are along the same vein, most show Kristofferson's trademark sarcastic cynicism. "The Heart" and "Love is the Way" are a bit more upbeat.  - - - - - "Third World Warrior" is something of a concept album about Reagon's dirty war in Nicaragua. Given that, the album is surprisingly accessible and universal. "The Hero" and "Don't Let the Bastards (Get You Down)" are among the better songs. Willie Nelson duets on the tribute "Jesse Jackson".
