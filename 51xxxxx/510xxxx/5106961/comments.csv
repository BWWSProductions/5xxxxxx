,SeanLor,2010-02-19T00:24Z,"Thanks for the up, great sound quality & good speed. Nice work!

As far as the album itself is concerned, anyone familiar with Lorin's previous work will be disappointed. This album, IMHO, is a giant festering pile of downtempo dubsteppy shiat. Underground Communication lacked the beauty and flow of his first 2 albums, but it's still got one hell of a leg up on this sorry excuse for whomp.

Again, just my opinion, and thanks again for the quality upload. ;) "
