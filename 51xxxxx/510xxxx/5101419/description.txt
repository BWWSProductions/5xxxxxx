Taller In More Ways - Sugababes [2005]


Taller in More Ways is the 4th studio album by British pop trio Sugababes, released by Island Records on 10 October 2005 in the United Kingdom. It was primarily produced by Dallas Austin and Xenomania, with additional production from Cameron McVey and Guy Sigsworth. The album topped the UK Albums Chart.
The title of the album, Taller In More Ways, was inspired by a line in the album's single, "Ugly", which says, "I didn't know my body would change / I grew taller than them in more ways".
During an interview with The Daily Mirror in October, 2008, band member Keisha Buchanan revealed that during the production of the album, Mutya Buena was not involved in the writing of the album material, unlike Buchanan and Heidi Range who, for instance, solely co-wrote "Push the Button" with Dallas Austin. However, on the album credits, Buena was listed as a writer for eight songs due to the group's policy of having "everything [...] split three ways".
The first single to be released from the album was "Push the Button" which reached number one in the the UK Singles Chart for three weeks It was nominated for a BRIT Award and won a TOTP Award. The subsequent release, "Ugly", also managed to reach the top three in the UK.	
Mutya Buena left the Sugababes in December, 2005 and was replaced by new member Amelle Berrabah. As a result, the album was re-released in March, 2006 featuring a new song, "Now You're Gone", and three pre-existing tracks being re-recorded with Berrebah's vocals, "Gotta Be You", "Follow Me Home" and "Red Dress". The latter preceded the re-release of the album, being released as the first single for the new line-up, peaking at number 4 in the UK. The final single release was "Follow Me Home" which only reached number 32 in the UK, their lowest chart position to date.
