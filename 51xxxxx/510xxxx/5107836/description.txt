Intermediate Japanese study book (Chuukyuu wo manabou). Basically, what we use in university, in our third and final year here. 

(uploaded because I have it, because I can and because I don't know how many books are out there to help an intermediate student)

There we go. Enjoy and, well, happy studying.
