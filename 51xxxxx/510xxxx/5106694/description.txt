A Mind Like Mine
Air Date:On Wednesday September 30

TVO explores ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and adulthood in an interactive TV-Web event starting with the world premiere of the documentary.

It's seven years after Odd Kid Out and O'Donnell has now turned her lens back on the now-grown Daniel and, her son, Kail, in A Mind like Mine, to create an intimate portrait of how ADHD affects them as young adults. 

Chronicling a year in the lives of the young men, the film captures their triumphs and challenges as they work toward their educational goals. Daniel, who has had to cope with depression following devastating losses in his personal life, is attending his first year of college and struggling with classes, homework and fitting in. 

Meanwhile, Kail is striving to get into university: he and his mother consult with his teachers to ensure strategies are in place to help him meet admission requirements, and he takes the decision about medication into his own hands. No matter the issues that ADHD brings - the struggle to concentrate and to inhibit and regulate behaviour, time management, organization - both men are intent on achieving success.
