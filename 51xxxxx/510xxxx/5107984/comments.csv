,protongeek,2009-10-03T19:10Z,"So news - Just another Liberal mouth piece of true ignorance. The Republicans health care plan is posted on line. O ' thats right the elitist in you uses "" ESPN "" in order to comprehend everything as your so superior to everyone else thats why you already have read there plan online havent you? But wait ....  Thats right your the typical Lib, if anyone has a better idea including the unborn you have to lie in order to possibly have some viability in the realm of ideas. The problem with Libs ideas is there out of a playbook Karl Marx wrote. We've all read it and its the same old, same old BS. When are you libs gonna learn Canada is not your Omen of great health care. They are moving away from it and have been allowing privatization of health care which until several years ago was against the law. But here we have politicians in all of there infinite wisdom who seem to think they can reinvent the wheel. What morons! Whilst every other govt in the world is trying to get out of there obligation to national healthcare were running as fast as we can towards it in hopes of running through that brick wall thats coming up in front of us. Any last words Libs ? The brick walls a coming.... Splat! "
