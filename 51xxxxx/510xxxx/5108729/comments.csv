,187mr,2009-10-08T05:53Z,"hey BOXX can upload this movie on full blu ray quality.
by the way thanks man for all your hard work on pirate bay"
,pantigana,2009-10-09T13:45Z,"The resoultion of this movie is NOT what it says in the torrent title/info and i'm surprised that no one said it after so many downloads.

Video resolution is 1920x800, so it's NOT true 16:9 and it's obviously NOT 1080p."
,theBudders,2009-10-14T19:13Z,"Don't listen to pantigana, he obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. The video resolution in it's entirety IS 1080p, it's just the actual resolution of the movie itself, because of it's panoramic film style, is 1920x800.

This is the case with all movies people, the movie itself isn't 1920x1080, that's including some of the black space."
,Henriku,2009-11-09T22:20Z,"pantigana; you'd be surprised - maybe - to know that the reason why there have been a whole lot of downloads without any complaints towards the ""resolution"" of the film, is because everything is A OK, and you are a moron. Try to understand the concept of the ratio before you start pooping out your mouth. Thank you."
,bdfortin,2009-11-30T05:05Z,"@pantigana:

1080p refers to a 1920x1080 resolution, but for a video to be considered 1080p it only needs to have a horizontal resolution of 1920.

Likewise for 720p and 480p."
,AlienAvatar,2009-12-04T16:47Z,"_The Johnny you are referring to, WillyT, commented on a different torrent, posted by Harry711. However that is a completely understandable mistake as this torrent is identical to that one right down to the last byte. The only difference is that BOZX's name is at the end of this one, and it was posted a few days later."
,y2j514,2009-12-25T00:52Z,Every now and then I find 1080p movies in what I believe is mkv format.  Also included with the torrent is a tiny exe file that literally converts the movie to several formats including WMV with 5.1 or 2 channel sound.  I am no longer able to find these sort of files - can anyone help me out?  I know the Quantum of Solace I have was like that but I am still unable to find it.  Thanks!
,amerelium,2010-01-31T20:05Z,"Pantigana is an idiot - the movie, like most, is in cinemascope format, 2.35:1, not 16:9, hence the 800 vertical resolution"
,mictrmbl,2010-02-01T15:19Z,"Pantigana, shut your fucking mouth and learn to appreciate other peoples' hard work! This looked TERRIFIC on my 65 inch HDTV; it also gave my a/v reciever and speakers quite the sonic workout!!

Maybe this gentleman can help ground your arrogant ignorance, Pantigana:



As always, many thanks to the uploader:)"
,Jintoboy,2010-02-25T03:09Z,"Hey can we get more seeders?
I'm getting 1.5 Kb/s
That's pathetic considering I usually get speeds up to 900 KB/s"
,xylolz,2010-02-25T03:49Z,thanks
,Jintoboy,2010-02-28T03:05Z,Why the fuck is this torrent set to private so that using DHT and the such is impossible?
,ro4eva,2010-04-06T16:52Z,"v 10

Tyvm 4 this."
,cclloyd,2010-05-03T23:17Z,"God damn DTS, so incompatible.  Just upload in AC3 or AAC so it plays on the Samsung and LG 3D TVs and LED TVs."
,shizosloth,2010-06-10T19:43Z,"Please don't use the f'ing ending of the movie as sample ... I kinda don't want to watch it anymore now, cuz I know how it ends ... :("
,shizosloth,2010-06-13T23:05Z,"Forget about that, I was just being stupid. Great quality, 10/10. All thumbs up."
,sudhan,2010-07-04T12:44Z,"Guys Guys Guys!!!

,strevisand,2010-08-31T04:41Z,Splendid. My first 1080p film. Thanks.
,strevisand,2010-08-31T04:44Z,Splendid. My first 1080p film. Thnaks.
,Flanker-B,2010-10-23T10:20Z,"To all that argue that cropped 1080p is still 1080p is stupid. The most important thing with resolutions like this bluray rip is that they are not 1080p compatible. That means that if you want to burn this movie (or any other like this) in AVCHD format, you will need to add black bars on top and bottom to make it real 1920*1080. The best porgram to do that is UncropMKV. Similar thing can be achieved if you ad an incompatible resolution mkv file to a project in MultiAVCHD, which will then add a black bar on the bottom of the video (by recoding it) before transcoding it to AVCHD. This method isn't as good as using UncropMKV because the video is not centered vertically (black bar is only on bottom).
PS: AVCHD is basically a dvd with video in BluRay format (at least the resolution and filee and folders). It is compatible with almost all blu ray players and ps3."
,deviance159,2011-06-02T22:34Z,Can some seeders/peers please open up some bandwidth for this torrent? I'm on a 100Mbit connection and getting horrible speed off of it... It shouldn't be so slow with 12 seeds available... :P I already restarted the file once after waiting 24 hours :P
,Mutegrill,2011-07-23T11:07Z,"Some tv-sets can only handle the actual presence of 1080 vertical lines! If those 280 lines where missing, like in 1920x800 with no black bars, a movie of that stature would be unplayable on tv-sets like that.

See? Pherhaps we instead of complaining should appreciate the uploaders for this. I would actually want the black bars, not being sure the move would play okey on my tv-screen.

If you belong to those only viewing movies on your computer, please try and understand some people want to use the full quality on their tv-screens, thus needing the black bars.

This requirement for certified TV sets from DIGITALEUROPE really causes many misunderstandings and unnecessary name calling on piratebay, but thats how it is, now."
,sams-town,2011-09-12T08:22Z,Great quality! Thanks for the upload mate :) Will seed for a long time.
,macman76,2012-01-30T08:15Z,"How come no one uploads these BR copies into the original 7.1 mix or at least 6.1? Everything is always 5.1. Come on we get BR torrents for sound as well as pic.

Thanks for the upload though. 

The guy who was complaining about DTS. Every modern stereo system will do DTS so not sure your complaint"
,President_Kush,2012-03-27T02:57Z,"@ macman76, FYI... many people don't have a stand alone stereo system.  Just a TV.  And Certain brands of TV don't decode DTS because they don't wanna be ripped of by DTS's huge licensing fees.  "
,President_Kush,2012-03-27T03:05Z,"WTF... pirate bay?  seems like I can't even download shit from here anymore. After 16hrs I'm only @ 2.3% (338 MB) fucking pathetic.  

Yet multiple peers are downloading @ over 1 MB/s"
