From Amazon: If you are a Connoisseur of science films as I am, you will love Darwin's Dilemma. Like a who-done-it film it presents a mystery, and then presents the evidence, and, last, tries to solve the mystery. The central mystery the film focuses on is the so-called Cambrian explosion and the incredible animals that existed then that were very unlike life forms that exist today. The evidence is presented using incredible animation, sound, and graphics, and then you, the viewer, can decide what the answer to the mystery is. No matter what your view is on the subject of biological origins, this film informs and challenges while it educates. One is sure to learn a great deal about this intriguing period of history from this effective presentation by a scientist who studied this problem at Cambridge University for his PhD degree.


Something for all you trolls to come and leave really intelligent comments /s

A documentary about ID that not a single troll will bother watching before showing how small his penis is by trying to know something about science. It will also be only trolls that talk about religion and turn a scientific debate into a religious one, all the while accusing the "other guys" of being the religious fanatics.

Ready... go....
