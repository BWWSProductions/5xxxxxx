,deepblue_mag,2009-10-06T23:22Z,"Who's the troll here, trying to mix religion and science?! I have no problem at all with faith, god or religion but only insecure fundamentalists need to justify their faith by pretending it is a science.

Bullshit as everything else that has to do with ID and as if this wasn't enough the film is so eager to prove problems with Darwin's theories that it simply ignores some of the central points of ID (the fact that earth and all life on it only have existed for about 6000 years). In order words, it tries to prove a point by disproving itself. As a scientist and as a believer I'm offended by this POS."
,xenu678,2009-10-08T04:07Z,"Yeah, um, clearly you HAVE no clue what ID even is deepblue_mug, for ID does not even approach the age of the earth argument. You surely are NOT a scientist, nor even a philosopher of science if you can't fathom how science and religion are so intertwined that they are impossible to separate. And trolls are not uploading valuable much wanted content, they are the ones leaving comments that show how utterly ignorant they are. Um, like you just did.

The only POS I can see here is the stuff dribble out of the corners of your mouth."
,xenu678,2009-10-08T04:13Z,"Because it's clear that some people just do not understand what ID is, and confuse it with Creationism like the idiot above, allow me to define both.

ID Defined

The theory of intelligent design (ID) holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. ID is thus a scientific disagreement with the core claim of evolutionary theory that the apparent design of living systems is an illusion.

In a broader sense, Intelligent Design is simply the science of design detection ? how to recognize patterns arranged by an intelligent cause for a purpose. Design detection is used in a number of scientific fields, including anthropology, forensic sciences that seek to explain the cause of events such as a death or fire, cryptanalysis and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). An inference that certain biological information may be the product of an intelligent cause can be tested or evaluated in the same manner as scientists daily test for design in other sciences.

ID is controversial because of the implications of its evidence, rather than the significant weight of its evidence. ID proponents believe science should be conducted objectively, without regard to the implications of its findings. This is particularly necessary in origins science because of its historical (and thus very subjective) nature, and because it is a science that unavoidably impacts religion.

Positive evidence of design in living systems consists of the semantic, meaningful or functional nature of biological information, the lack of any known law that can explain the sequence of symbols that carry the ?messages,? and statistical and experimental evidence that tends to rule out chance as a plausible explanation. Other evidence challenges the adequacy of natural or material causes to explain both the origin and diversity of life.


Creationism defined:

God did it.


So the next time someone comes on here and tries to link the two, trust me, we'll just be left feeling sorry for you that you just weren't gifted with the mental capacity to differentiate the difference between a boiled egg and a jet engine. That's ok, we understand how indoctrinating the education system is, how it has rotted away your core synapses till at last all you can do is regurgitate secular humanist propaganda and yet actually believe yourself that your intelligent. Don't worry, we understand."
,deepblue_mag,2009-10-09T19:11Z,"OMFG you're ignorant! You just got to be American.

How can you believe in something you don't even know what it is? ID as a concept was defined by the Discovery Institute (yeah, that's right, the same people that did this movie) in the document most often referred to as ""the Wedge"". The Wedge is a strategic plan for how evolution shall be challenged and eventually replaced by a ""better"" theory, ID, on scientific merits (something they so far utterly have failed in doing). If you actually read the Wedge, or better yet, took a look on the agenda of the parties involved in the Discovery Institute you quite quickly would realise that ID, as it is defined by its inventors, is nothing else than creationism in new clothes. Religious dogma passed of as pseudo-science.

And if you want to discuss ID from its scientific merits in relation to evolution then you really are in deep shit. Whilst, evolution rests on a valid and sound scientific foundation that is completely coherent with all other aspects of modern society and its basis in physics, chemistry, geology etc etc, ID at best is a patchwork of unproven, incoherent ideas that on issue after issue have been disproven.

Evolution is not a theory, it's simply a fact and if you doubt that and is too dumb or too lazy to read up on the subject, visit a farm, a garden or a kennel and see it in action, happening right in front of you. Or just do as you probably will, remain ignorant and discard the basic scientific principles on which most of your daily life rely."
,xenu678,2009-10-09T22:05Z,"Good try deepblue_mug, but you fool no one here, except yourself, whom you clearly have VERY fooled."
,livewire120v,2009-10-29T04:28Z,"I wish scientists would debate the matter.  I hate having to weed out the myths.  I dibelieve evolutio because of science.  If they can explain the short solar pulses, where the radiation on earth from the sun went, helium dating results and other such anomalies, then I am all ears.
I ignore the opinions of Red herrings, Strawman, Circular Reasoning, Chasing the Argument, Ad Hominem, Fallacies and Begging the Question. Amongst a slew of others like McCarthyism.
Is there one intelligent being that would discuss science?  Not nationality, religion or unrelated issues.  That the source is religious is not the issue.  We all get intelligence from sources that we do not believe in.  "
,maxpejn,2009-10-30T14:07Z,"deepblue_mag: You almost sound like the most religiously fanatic evolutionist I've come across: ""Evolution is not a theory, it's simply a fact and if you doubt that and is too dumb or too lazy to read up on the subject, visit a farm, a garden or a kennel and see it in action, happening right in front of you."" -This is a PURELY religious statement. It has no other value in any context whatsoever. Please read up on what religious belief is, before making retarded statements like that or mock people for having a different BELIEF than yourself.

Evolution is no less a ""myth of origin"" or religious than any other religion. Look up the words ""science"" and ""religion"" in a dictionary, and you'll see that EVOLUTION IS NOT SCIENCE, and never can be so by definition. It CAN NEVER be fact, if you BELIEVE it can then you are VERY confused. Check what proof is needed to establish a ""FACT"" according to the term science, and you'll find evolution never has nor ever will be proven. Argument solved.

It's obvious you have a strong conviction and faith, but please try not to get fanatic about it. Or you might just end up judging yourself, such as this: ""...insecure fundamentalists need to justify their faith by pretending it is a science.""
Sounds a lot like yourself, man!

Watch out falling for this one: ""...if you doubt that and is too dumb or too lazy to read up on the subject"" -I recommend you go read up A LOT!  Why not start with the terms ""science"" and ""religion""? You need not go much further... I won't say if ""you is too dumb or lazy"", you be the judge.

xenu678: Thanks! Highly appreciated!"
,llahsram,2009-11-08T05:19Z,"The world's leading scientists (USUALLY not the scientists funded by corporations, governments or educational institutions), are discovering overwhelming evidence that simply disproves the theory of evolution as we know it. (It is, by the way, a theory. Although you would never know it as such if you were in school these days). Real, scientific evidence for Intelligent Design of EVERYTHING in our known universe, has been consistently stacking up over the past 10-15 years. The calculated odds for life to happen out of ""chance"" far out-number even the total estimated number of atoms in our universe (I believe it's somewhere around 1 in 10 to the 159 power) Also, having an infinite amount of time for this ""chance"" to take place, works against the evolutionary process of interdependent systems within a living cell. It seems that the theories of evolution and bio-genesis will eventually be going the way of the ""Flat-Earth theory"".

Leaving religion aside, there's really only two ways you can look how we got here; either it all happened by chance, or some intelligent force (that we're not yet fully aware of) put it all together.

Religion is where you consider the implications of those two views."

You have to love Creationists. They are so creative.

Evolution is real. If you think that Evolution and Religion conflict, then you don't understand religion, and you need to go back and reread your holy books, and this time keep your mind open."
,uflinks,2011-02-10T08:00Z,"Thanks for the awesome upload!

The controversy is not over evolution at all, but over Darwinism which is the grand claim that all species evolved from a single  ancestor through undirected natural selection acting on random mutations, and which claims that design in living things is the result of blind chance processes."
,llahsram,2011-03-21T01:46Z,"In response to Animal1000000:

Evolution is based on the theory of Natural Selection. Natural Selection requires the process of death and new life. According to the ""Holy Book"" of Genesis, human beings existed before death existed. Therefore (and for many other logical reasons as well) the Bible and Evolution can never be in agreement.

Maybe you should actullay read the Holy Books before claiming to know what is written in them..."
