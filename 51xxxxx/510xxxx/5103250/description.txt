Late one night, Lucas (MichaÃ«l Cohen) and ClÃ©mentine (Olivia Bonamy) encounter strange events in their remote country home. It starts with prank calls and strange noises, but when the power is cut off and their car disappears, the terrified couple is trapped by the unseen force. Is it simply kids from the school where ClÃ©mentine teaches, or could it have something to do with a mother and daughter who mysteriously vanished the day before?
