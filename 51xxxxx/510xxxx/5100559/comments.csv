1. Mount or burn iso image (using DAEMON Tools Lite or any .iso mounting program)
2. Install (don?t install EA download manager because you don?t need it)
3. Use one of the keycodes below
4. At Product registration just press ?skip registration?.
5. Copy the files from the Razor1911 directory (on the virtual disc) to your installation directory overwriting the existing one
6. Run the game using FIFA10.exe
