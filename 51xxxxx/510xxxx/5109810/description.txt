The American, the premier superhero of the United States, rebels against the government.  He publicly humiliates the president, while friends broadcast his message to the nation.  That message: "You are being lied to and controlled by a secret alliance of political and corporate masters.  Now I'm going to expose them".  The government sends out the superhuman team of Enola Gay to kill The American.  Although they may not have to . . .


The series, written by Rob Williams with art by Trevor Hairsine, was due to be launched in November 2001, but had to be delayed because of the 9/11 attacks.  The first three issues were finally published between January and July 2002 and were collected into a trade paperback in 2003.  When the publisher came back from a hiatus caused by problems including a serious burglary, Hairsine had already moved on to Marvel and, while Cary Nord was initially pencilled in as his replacement, a job that finally went to Travel Foreman and the last three issue were published between March and June 2004.  Len O'Grady provided all the colouring to "maintain colour continuity".  

Although people make the link with The Authority, Williams has said he had not read the series before starting to write Cla$$war and he went on to explain the actual inspiration:

"Cla$$war was influenced by my love of people like Noam Chomsky - I was reading his Class Warfare when I came up with the idea for the series - and Bill Hicks, my fascination with Nixon and American politics in general.  I spend half my time reading books on subjects like the CIA, biographies of people like Martin Luther King.  For some reason Iâ€™m captivated by US history over the past 50 year... I also love intelligent superhero comics - a legacy from my dysfunctional youth and the effect Alan Mooreâ€™s Captain Britain and Marvelman had on me in the early eighties. So I figured Iâ€™d combine the two".
