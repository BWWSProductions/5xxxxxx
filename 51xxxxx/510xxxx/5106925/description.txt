Storyline: On the day of James Kirk's birth, his father dies on his ship in a last stand against a 
mysterious alien vessel. He was looking for Ambassador Spock, who is a child on Vulcan at that time, disdained by his neighbors 
for his half-human nature. Twenty years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker inspired by Capt. Christopher Pike to 
fulfill his potential in Starfleet even as he annoys his instructors like young Lt. Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at 
Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikura Sulu, Pavel Chekov and 
even Kirk himself thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier 
where the old legend is altered forever even as the new version of it is just beginning.
