,Taze007,2009-10-04T12:10Z,"Superior work!
I got a file that was 4 gigs for 720p.
It looked bland and the audio was shit.
Then I got this one...
Had to come back and drop a comment.
This isn't a sharp but looks so much clearer..
(I know that sounds retarded but it's the only way to say it.)"
,GITFACE1,2009-10-04T21:22Z,"hey who let the retard loose on here? or is that your prisoner number? or maybe its the number that you whore out your mother on?
the truth is, dickhead that people like secret myth make great uploads and retards like you never bother to seed it after downloading. I dont see you uploading shit on here, just whinging like a little girl that your free lunch isnt shoved down your greedy little neck fast enough. now go and get some respect.
respect to you secret and all your work, not finished the dl yet but im sure its up to the usaul standard"

,corbinjurgens,2010-05-09T14:30Z,"I have been trying to convert this down for my iPod Touch, but failing no matter what I do.

 I tried using a simple ipod touch video converter which normally works but the converted video has no audio. I tried converting it through iTunes itself but I end up with a white video with only audio. I also tried handbrake but the audio was really slow while the video was normal. I am now trying mp4box to extract the aac, convert it to 2 channel and put it back together. 

Ok! That seems to be working now. Ill try and explain what I did. Download 'My MP4Box GUI' search it in google. Install, once installed open, go to the 'demux' tab, find the video that you want to make 2 channel audio and then press demux. The files will save in the same place as the video. Once thats done right click on the .acc file and open it with Quick Time, in there go File, Export, Export as WAV or something and then once thats done, drag the WAV file into iTunes, select it, click the advance tab at the top and press create AAC version and then wait for that. Then go back to mp4 box, press the mux tab, select the .h264 file from before and the file you just converted with itunes and then press mux or something like that. 

I'm sure theres an easier way but thats how I did it. I don't know why my computer doesnt like 6 channel audio "

,.Leto.,2011-01-15T22:50Z,"The usual SecretMyth problem, the rip is so DARK that it has nothing to do with the original anymore.
Use another source if you want a real copy, because this one is really far from the original."
,ultamanl,2011-02-19T04:10Z,thnx
