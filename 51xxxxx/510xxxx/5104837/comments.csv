Ice Blink is the remarkable story of a conventional family of five living a very unconventional life afloat. Follow Dave and Jaja Martin and their crew of three children from their beginnings on the 25-foot day sailer Direction in which they circumnavigated the globe and join them on a sail to the Arctic where they encounter new friends, icebergs and polar bears. Share their voyage into opportunities that test their physical and mental limits, prolong that self-sufficiency is the key to survival and that the rewards of the world can be had with a commitment to family, a simple lifestyle and the courage to choose differently.

Ice Blink is an affirmation that yes; we really can choose how we live our lives.
