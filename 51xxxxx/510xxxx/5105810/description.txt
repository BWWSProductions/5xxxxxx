This is Final Fantasy VIII encoded in 4 separate eboot.pbp

Customized Icon, Background, and music while hovering the icon. (It does not repeat, I had problems when I made the sounds repeat)

Has been tested trough the first save point by myself.

To use: Copy folder containing eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

A lot of people experience lagg and freezing with Final Fantasy VIII and IX, if you simply go to the restore panel or your psp (hold down R during boot up with custom firmware) and there should be an option to overclock processor. Overclocking has prevented nearly all lagg and freezing FOR ME.

Please comment if you enjoy my torrent.
