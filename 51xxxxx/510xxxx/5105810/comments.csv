,Sad_Man,2009-10-01T09:06Z,how do you overclock the processor under the recovery manager? so that prevents the freezing issue right?i have 5.00 m33-6 thank you
,iammrfrank,2009-10-01T09:21Z,"Step 1. Turn off your psp.
Step 2. Hold down the R trigger.
Step 3. While holding R trigger, turn on psp.
Step 4. There should be an ""processor"" or ""overclock"" option on that menu.
Step 5. Overclock to 333."
