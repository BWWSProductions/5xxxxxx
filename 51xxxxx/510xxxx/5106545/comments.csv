,brianxxx,2009-10-01T18:14Z,"Boy, Acronis has a lot of fucking balls trying to continue to sell this shit. I love Acronis' stuff but DD has been a terror in varied environments and just now...since 2007 there has not been an update...until just now.

One can only guess the mess it will cause with Win 7.

Better to get it from here than pay for it! But I switched to Paragon a long time ago for partition tools and it is much better if anyone wants to know of a good alternative."
[V],Murlok,2009-10-01T20:27Z,brianxxx  all have a different taste.I used to this and if used as a bootdisk its for me easy to work with so you have yours  I have mine :)
,sgriff59,2009-10-01T23:33Z,Doesn't work with Windows 7
[V],Murlok,2009-10-02T17:13Z,ailef  you do and we might clear that up :)

,143pb,2009-10-15T19:29Z,"this DOES work with windows 7, i have win 7 enterprise and it works just fine, plus windows 7 kernal is the same as vista kernal so..."
,giggedyguy,2009-11-06T16:07Z,"143pb, NO, it's NOT the same kernel. 

I believe this is the server version, hence the reason it's not compatible with Windows 7."
,zhennessy,2010-01-02T01:57Z,Thanx works great with VISTA ! 
,riadulmazid,2010-01-05T11:17Z,It doesn't work with windows 7 even after selecting windows xp compatibility.... If u don't believe me then give it a try.....
,face-plants,2010-01-12T22:40Z,"Not sure whether the problem is with this torrent or with the Disk Director installs you guys are using but I have been running Disk Director 10.0 (build 2160) as well as True Image 2010 (build 5055) on Windows 7 x64 for months. It has worked through all the betas since build 7000 came out for Win7 and I have used it on 32-bit and 64-bit machines running the retail release for 2+ months. I just tried it in XP-mode on my Win7 x64 box and it even works on there.

One thing that might help is that after installing Disk Director...rebooting...then loading True Image and rebooting again. I still was asked to reboot TWO MORE times when opening either program before they worked.

I haven't tried this newer build of DD and now I'm not sure that I will since mine is working and so many ppl had issues with this. Maybe I'll make a full image and then try and let you guys know :)"
,hossmonkey,2010-05-24T10:23Z,"Direct from Acronis website
Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0 is not compatible with Windows 7"
,switspk,2010-07-02T19:01Z,sadly... win 7 not supported
,_Zotov_,2010-08-18T22:28Z,"@murlock
