About the Docu:
The cell phone, a gizmo that fits in the palm of one's hand, has many features and provides many services to millions of subscribers. In Cell Phones: The Ring Heard Around the World, viewers will see the dramatic rescue of a woman whose cell phone saved her life, an interview with the inventor of the cell phone camera, and will meet Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, who claims the cell phone can be used for almost everything, except making love. This compelling documentary takes viewers on a journey through cell phone culture, showcasing its numerous functions around the world from Japan to India.
