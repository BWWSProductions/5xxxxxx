Classic Oz Rock from 2000



"Like a Dog" is a song by Australian alternative rock band Powderfinger. It was released as a single on 15 January 2001, and appeared on the band's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five. The song was later included on Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger 1994-2000.

The song's lyrics are based on the band's feelings towards Australia's political position of the time. Musically, "Like a Dog" is strongly influenced by Ian Haug (guitar and backing vocals) and his love of Iggy Pop. "Like a Dog"'s video starred Anthony Mundine in a "raging bull" type sequence. Paul Williams - "Rose Against the Odds" also makes an appearance in video.
