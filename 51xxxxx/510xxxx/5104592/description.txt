Dumbo is a 1941 American animated feature produced by Walt Disney and released on October 23, 1941, by RKO Radio Pictures.

The fourth film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, Dumbo is based upon a child's book of the same name by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Perl. The main character is Jumbo Jr., a semi-anthropomorphic elephant who is cruelly nicknamed Dumbo. He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using his ears as wings. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy â€” a relationship parodying the stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants.
