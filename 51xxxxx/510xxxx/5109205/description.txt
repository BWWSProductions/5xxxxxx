ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

To meet the needs of Christafari's growing Spanish-speaking fan base, we proudly present another Christafari first: Spanish Christian Reggae. Palabra Sonido y Poder is Spanish for Word Sound & Power. This album is the third and final chapter of Christafari's WordSound&Power "trinity." (Part II being DubSound&Power â€“ the first Christian "dub" album.) This album reaches out to a growing but under-recognized segment of the US population. With the recent success of Spanish language music and Latin music styles in the US, Palabra Sonido y Poder is a timely release. The album contains the most popular songs from Christafari's WordSound&Power album, the hit song "No Puedo Dejar" (Spanish version of "Can't Stop") from Valley of Decision, and bonus tracks that include a brand new meringue style song. It also features guest performances by Latin hit recording artists such as Gamaliel Ruiz. The majority of lyrics on this album are sung in Spanish, but the album also contains! Spanglish (Spanish-English hybrid), English, and the song "Why You Ago Look" sung in Portuguese.
