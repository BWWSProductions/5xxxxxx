Isabella was the daughter of Philip IV, King of France, and of his wife Joanna, Queen of Navarre in her own rights, and sister of three French kings: Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV. 

At the tender age of 12 she was married to Edward II, King of England, twice her age, very handsome and very gay. This might have been quite bad on a personal level and might have led to just another unhappy queen of a marriage of state. However, Edward was quite an incapable ruler, letting his favorite Piers Gaveston, raised to be Earl of Cornwall, rule the country. 

Isabella - humilated as this proud royal princesss felt - remained through the various ups and downs of Edward' reign a loyal consort. England was most of the time near or in a kind of civil war due to the king's misrule. When the Despensers - now the favourites - got hold of Edward and he started to move even against his queen, deriving her of her dower lands and income, she became tired of it all. 

While in France she become the lover of Mortimer, one of the English exiles, and organized the overthrow of Edward and the Despensers. This was much helped by the fact that the future Edward III was with his mother. Most English were quite happy to get rid of Edward II. 

In 1327 Edward II was either murdered or escaped from captivity. With Edward III as nominal king, Mortimer's power through Isabella was unquestioned. However, the new regime started to abuse power and behaved as badly as the previous one. In a brazen move, the 18 year old Edward III had Mortimer arrested and executed and started to rule himself. 

Isabella spent the reminder of her life in quiet seclusion.
