The debut album from mysterious Wizard Rocker(s), The Hallows EP by The Sorting Hat is a beautiful, intimate, yet theatrical record from someone who clearly has musical experience outside of the wizard realm, and who just as clearly has a deep love for the Harry Potter books.

A large collection of ancient sounding instruments is to be found, mingling with 80's synthesizers and the occasional rusty banjo part. The actual genre of this music would be hard to define as any sort of rock, as the music shifts from operatic to dance to hip hop to folk, all while keeping its feet firmly on the path through the Forbidden Forest.

The journey, clocking in under a half hour, focuses on many side characters, including a love song for Luna, something I can only assume is about dementors, and a strangely bittersweet funeral dirge for someone named Tom. The whole thing ends up coming off as strangely, and quite effectively, personal.

A highly rewarding album, for anyone, Harry Potter fan or not.
