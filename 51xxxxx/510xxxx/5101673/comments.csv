,mrbrimley,2011-05-08T02:31Z,"It's the damnedest thing...every torrent I download and seed has no problems whatsoever, EXCEPT for torrents I personally upload. There are 7 people trying to get this torrent right now, and I can't connect to a single one of them. 

However, you can get this album for free at

sortinghat.bandcamp.com

Sorry for the inconvenience.
