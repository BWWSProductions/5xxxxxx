,Crustynudger,2009-09-30T06:23Z,"Quit using EZTV. Their torrents won't connect to a tracker (TPB trackers are offline) which means slower download speeds through DHT.. All because they're too idle to include http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce in the torrents.
Try VTV: https://thepiratebay.org/user/VTV/
or AiTB: https://thepiratebay.org/user/AiTB/
or xsaimex: https://thepiratebay.org/user/xsaimex/"

,sparks67,2009-09-30T07:40Z,crustynudger get a life or a green or purple skull if ur so clever ..........
,coolyot3,2009-09-30T07:50Z,"Don't wave Crustynudger off like that and call him retarded, he may have been a total jack off about it but adding that tracker really did speed up the torrent, it added like 20 more seeders.  Ill still use Eztv since their the best, Im just going to add the tracker everytime, you all should too until they decide to add it themselves. http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce"
,j4m3s,2009-09-30T09:18Z,"Crustynudger is right, but still much love for eztv :)"
[V],big_dad_e,2009-09-30T11:29Z,"Yes TPB trackers are gone and have been for weeks, common knowledge.  If people aren't loading their own trackers too bad.  Here's some public trackers:
http://tracker.bittorrent.am/announce

http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
