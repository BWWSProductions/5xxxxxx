A heads up for future downloaders: The track names on the ""Bliss"" single are incorrect. They should be
Bliss
Hey Jupiter (Live)
Upside Down (Live '99)"
,ugottahaveheart,2010-12-12T02:09Z,Thank you! You have done an excellent job! I'll be buying the music too. You should see the Tori Amos gift collection for this year. I'll be buying all her merchandise and her concert tickets as soon as she comes my way.
