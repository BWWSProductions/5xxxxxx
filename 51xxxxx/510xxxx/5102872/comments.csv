If you EVER get the time, write a EBook on how it's done.  I'd like to not only take some of the pressure off you, but also be a provider.

Thanks for your efforts, they are appreciated,

 Bonsai56."

No, there's no need for a serial for this, just double click the crack & run it.

Please read the instructions inside.

And i'd recommend NOD32 to Mcafee.

God Bless you too ! ;D"
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-10-26T22:46Z,"Halp!  I installed it, ran the fix, and then rebooted.

Well my virus database in this edition of NOD32 is May 11, 2007, virus database version 2257.  When I go to try and update the virus definitions, it says they are completely up to date!  I think this has something to do with the fix changing NOD32 to the demo update servers so no username or password is required.

Now I got a NOD32 with a virus database over two years old and it won't update.

Halp!"
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-10-26T22:49Z,"Oh wait, I figured out a bypass.  I switched from automatic select and manually selected the first server on the list.  Now update is downloading something."
,Bebre3zy,2009-10-30T03:48Z,"I agree with Bonsai56 I've been your apps and their are great, I also would instruction or tip on how it done, because I also want to be a good provider"
