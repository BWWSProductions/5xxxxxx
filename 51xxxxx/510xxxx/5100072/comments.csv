,jorge56,2011-03-22T06:45Z,"people think that just because is DTS audio, it will sound better than ac3 or aac, you will need  good speakers  to hear the difference, otherwise DTS will only sound louder and that's all."
,cyber_system_tk,2011-03-29T18:58Z,"I have a highend surround sound system with a Denon Reciver and B&W Speakers (2500 Dollars)

I can easily hear the difference between DTS and Dolby Digital

But at a mate, that have a lowend surround system (Below 500 dollars) i can't hear a difference between DTS and Dolby Digital

So the sound system does the difference :)

You also have to install the system right and calibrate it
That will also make a big difference

I allways download movies with DTS if it is available
Or els i go for Dolby Digital which is also quite nice :)"
