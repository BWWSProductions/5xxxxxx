CPU: Intel
GFX: ATI or NVidia (Intel GMA not tested, but should working)

There are some bugs:
The mouse pointer has a black square border
The ball has no texture when settings are mid or high

The game is very playable, tested on iMac (C2D 2GHz / 2,5 GB RAM / ATI X1600)
and macbook ( C2D 2.16GHz/2GB RAM/ GMA 950)
Game is working


Obviously not my release. This has been floating around the interwebs for a while now. But none of the versions seemed to work properly or were dead. So I just updated it to a working cider wrapper and am re-upping it.

Hopefully someone more talented than me will take it on themselves to try and get some of the newer versions working. But until then, this remains the only major working football game for Mac.

Joga Bonito!
