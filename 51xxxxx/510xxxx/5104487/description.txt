iCarly iSpeed date
Aired  September 26th Saturday 2009

When Carly has trouble finding a date to a dance, Sam asks for Seattle-area boys to apply to be her date. When the gang is overwhelmed by the amount of boys who show up, they hold a speed-dating session. Meanwhile, Carly convinces Sam to ask Gibby to the dance since no one else did, but Sam becomes enraged when Gibby turns her down. Carly finally finds a boy, whom after the dance, she dumps for being so talkative. In the end, Carly and Freddie share a dance together at the Groovy Smoothie, which Sam walks in on. Upon seeing them, she silently leaves.
