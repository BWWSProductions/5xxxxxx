"Jason Bermas, the intrepid host of The Infowarrior, sits in while Alex tracks down the APF/Blackwater story in Hardin, Montana. 

Jason talks with Michael Hollingsworth, the investigative reporter who revealed important details about the Hardin story on Alex's show yesterday.

Alex calls into the show periodically with reports from the road.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
