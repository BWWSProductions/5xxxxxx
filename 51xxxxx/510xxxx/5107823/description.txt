Rip+Edit mg56

10/02/09 Rundown: David Letterman talk, Opie & Bobby Fishing, 
Zombieland & movie duscussion, The Office, Jocktober cont., 
Bill Burr, Vinny Brand and David Duchovny in-studio. 



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
