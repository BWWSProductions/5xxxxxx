Sure BD can be updated, otherwise it would be pretty useless."

But I see you have two different kinds....which one is better....I just want one that simple and good. I'm guessing norton because you have tons of torrents on it. But is bit defender somehow different. "

Three important parts from the torrent description and included Readme.txt file:


Note-1:

[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-11T02:11Z,"@alynut 

BTW: Another important part of the torrent description:

""When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted.

Thanks mate for your effort your work is appritiable. I trust Kaspersky & Microsoft & both reported it as CLEAN.

@ All F***ing noobs 
 Instead of spamming hear just go & buy a genuine copy of Bitdefender. Because whoever uploading on this site is not your servent on whom you will shout or use bad words. You or site owners are not paying them even a penny. So shut the fuck up. "

 One personel question.  Which antivirus do you use?"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-18T05:49Z,Norton Internet Security is quite good because of their firewall and features like Auto-Protect etc. IMO Norton's av scanner however is as good or bad as of other good sucurity software.

Could someone give me some help on how to download the program without creating complications with McAfee?

I use norton internet security thn i right click on the folder and scan now NIS wont detect any threat but if i right click on the file use insight network scan (the only option when i right click on the file) it will recognize it as a virus. In the discription here say that NIS wont detect threat so i am doubting is there any possible the torrent has been poison by other people and what the different between scan now and insight network scan."

Such a long post from someone I don't know! Too bad it's all very boring, but also quite funny."
,TheMercO,2010-04-21T03:27Z,"thanks for this 
 but  after reboot  BD  says there is a problem  and to contact tech support( or something like that)  then the comp reboots 
I uninstalled in safe mode.
  I have  NOD32 and comodo running so that could be the problem . i have XP  on an 4 1/2 year old comp

I sure hope the sheriff of Nottingham doesnt catch you


LONG LIVE ROBING HOOD"

,porsche6714,2010-05-07T17:29Z,This is no longer working on any of my computers after months of successful updates.  It still says my license is valid but the update fails every time.  I could have something to do with bit defender updating the software version of Total Security 2010 to 13.02
,TAIM2DAI,2010-05-07T18:49Z,"@porsche6714

I had the same problem and came back to this torrent to see if anyone else was suffering with the same issues and just assumed after your post that the new id sig has made the patch obsolete but it recently updated itself ( around 5:45pm) and has done again the following hour however manual updates do not work.

Not really sure what to make of it to be honest I'll see how it runs for another week before uninstalling I hope you get similar results :P"

,JohnVictor,2010-05-20T21:54Z,"Hey Robbinghood, I've been using your patch for like 4 months now, everything works like charm but yesterday the auto update is not working anymore, i try to update over and over again it just doesn't work. I don't know what to do, I check all the settings right from firewall to a newly installed software but nothing seems wrong. You think bitdefender guys blacklisted it already? Please help.."
[V],Anacondaz,2010-05-22T05:46Z,"@johnvictor 
i had the same problem also
just do as following it worked for me and its now updating fine
FIRST UNINSTALL THE PATCH THEN RESTART THE COMPUTER HE TRIAL DAYS WILL BE 30 DON'T BOTHER ABOUT IT
THEN UNINSTALL BIT DEFENDER USING UNINSTALLERS LIKE REVO OR YOUR UNINSTALLER, I USED YOURUNINSTALLER
THEN DOWNLOAD THE LATEST BIT DEFENDER VERSION FROM THEIR SITE AND DO AS IT SAYS AND UPDATE IT COMPLETELY
THEN INSTALL THE PATCH IN THE SAFE MODE
CHEERS MATE
HOPE THIS IS HELPFULL FOR U"

,ProdigalWoodlouse,2010-06-08T21:43Z,"Works a treat. Thanks RH for yet another clean, high-quality torrent! 

However, I would not recommend BitDefender Internet Security, despite its great reviews -- it is a complete resource hog, and frequently stops responding. Also, it refuses to perform any kind of scan on my PC. (This is not due to the patch, it happens in the trial too!) I don't seem to be the only person with this problem, and the fix provided by BD doesn't work! 

BitDefender seems to me to be more trouble than it's worth. "
,Professoriz,2010-06-09T21:29Z,"Well, atleast it worked for me few days ago."
,chakabear13,2010-06-10T18:33Z,i downloaded the torrent and install it.seems perfectly fine.but when i tried to scan [deep system scan] it takes more than 15 hours to be completed.whats wrong?
,Az4z3l11,2010-06-21T12:17Z,"@any1 w/ update problems 

BitDefender doesn't update when you try to do it manually it just cancels the progress for some reason. (Anti-Piracy protection?, BitDefender server failure??) But no worries. You goto ""Update"" tab and make sure Automatic Updates are enabled. When manual update fails Automatic Updates kicks in, though it might take a day or two, but my BitDefender updates itself automatically after couple of days. 
(ATM. my BD  Last update: 18.6.2010 18:31:35,
 Virus signatures: 6.157670 and
  Engine version: 7.32070)"
,Az4z3l11,2010-06-21T12:23Z,"@chakabear13

It takes so long becuse it's DEEP system scan.
It scan frigging every file on your PC and does it so meticulously that it probably scans every HEX of every file. No wonder it takes so long. Do a quick system scan for faster results."
,raven49,2010-06-26T10:19Z,"my BD total security update tab is GRAYED OUT, hence i cannot update manual or automatic, well i can update manual but it doesnt work forever. comment fixes dont work.

running patched BD total security on TPB win7 32bit

help?"
,raven49,2010-06-26T20:28Z,"nevermind, i read the official forums and it seems that the GRAYED OUT update tab is a COMMON problem among users, especially with XP and WIN7 users. there isnt even a permanent fix yet.

I suggest if you want bitdefender then go for 2009 ver."
,hassanen,2010-06-29T21:35Z,"frist of all i will thank you for this awsome program very good job robbinghood i hope u can make better better i think u are the best uploader in the side then chatshitto  nice job i uing bitdefender and i used this and very good   ,, i have 1110 free trail from today very good again"

,TheEtherealBeing,2010-08-15T18:04Z,"RobbingHood, I downloaded this torrent but when I open it, Avast! and AVG tells that there is a trojan in there even though you posted the scan results for both the AV's as clean...

Is this a false positive or is it for real?"
