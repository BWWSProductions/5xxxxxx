,QoMSoL,2009-09-30T09:39Z,"R5 (Region 5): The R5 Line is a retail DVD from region 5. Region 5 consists of Eastern Europe (Former Soviet Union), Indian subcontinent, Africa, North Korea, and Mongolia. R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they are a direct Telecine transfer of the film without any of the image processing. They take the information from the DVD disc and sync it to an English version of the film, usually a previously released version. Which means that the sound often isn?t as good as DVDRips.

So R5 IS a dvdrip... if U R Russian =)
And only the sound can be lousy cuz it's provided by God knows who..."
