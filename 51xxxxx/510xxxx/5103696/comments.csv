Did anybody actually look at the link Tausee put in the description, the virustotal report??  It's chock full o' trojan downloader detections!!"

[V],[HB],2009-10-11T12:05Z,"The Reports & Alarms are false positive.
Dont use keygen if you think its infected.
Always use Sanboxie while dealing with keygens.
Use the keys which I've provided inside the torrent.

And dont leave comments even when I've already provided some serials inside the torrent."
