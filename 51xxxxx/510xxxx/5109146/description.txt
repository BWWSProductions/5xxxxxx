ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:


This 2-CD set is packed full of chart-topping Christian music, ranging from old-time gospel favorites ("He's Everything To Me" - Cliff Barrows & The Gang), to 70s folk-contemporary ("Which Way The Wind Blows" - 2nd Chapter Of Acts, and "I Wish We'd All Been Ready" - Randy Matthews,) to the mammoth hits of the 80s ("Thy Word" - Amy Grant), to some more recent favorites ("My Redeemer" - Nicole C. Mullen, "This Good Day" - Fernando Ortega).
The great thing about this collection is that many of these are songs you probably haven't heard for quite awhile. Even if you wore your old records out, it might be time to give these songs another listen. And, if all you have are your old records, the more contemporary cuts on this CD will expand your horizons.
