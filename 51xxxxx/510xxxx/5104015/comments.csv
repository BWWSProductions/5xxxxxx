please uploud transformers revenge of the fallen"
,Otaku1,2009-09-30T22:23Z,Thank you. Quality +1.
,jimk770i,2009-10-06T19:41Z,"thanks for the upload secret_myth...your uploads are really cool...
...to those who finished downloading could you care to spend some time seeding? that would be appreciated...I got 10 kbps...so, if anyone could have a heart to freely give what they have freely received, everyone will be able to seed as well...
usually when i download secret_myth's uploads, they take a very short time...this is the slowest...no wonder there are only 12 who are seeding, I don;t know what happened to the other 259 who finished downloading....
this is about sharing, so please seed for a week maximum if that would be alright for you...
thanks!"

,n1ck1216,2009-11-04T03:01Z,Im using limewire as the client and lately it been slow to download.. right now it 44p2p user running at 358kb/s
,now4real954,2009-12-10T06:19Z,hey just got a notice from my cable company that they put a complaint against me for this torrent and 2 others from this uploader...so keep your nose clean people...great product but it's being watched by the powers that be...be carefull all
,AusMakka,2010-03-04T14:43Z,"Silly question time. I know this is ripped from Blueray but what would happen if I used say ConvertXtoDVD and burnt it to a standard DVD. The size here is only 1.5gig so would it work ok or not at all?

Thanks very much for the upload!"
