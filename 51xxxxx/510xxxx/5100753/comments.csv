,PbMonkeyface,2010-06-16T14:32Z,"3 dvd's (2 -R and 1 +R) wasted. Every single of them stops while loading match.
About 85% loaded, then freezes.

I'm using swapmagic 3, burned game using imgburner 2X speed -> not working
Dvd decrypter 2X speed -> not working

This torrent is waste of time, if you are using
swapmagic."
