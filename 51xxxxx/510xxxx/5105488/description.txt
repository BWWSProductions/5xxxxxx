Everything you could possibly need to soft mod your Wii, with a detailed step-by-step guide.

detailed info about whats included can be found here:

The above link has much newer information than what is inside this torrent.
You'd probably benefit from reading it.



This package was intended to mod a Wii that has not been upgraded to the newest system menu, 4.2


There is no way to soft-mod 4.2 yet. 
If you have 4.2 you are out of luck until someone finds or creates a new exploit.
IMO you are going to be waiting awhile, waninkoko doesn't work with wii anymore.
What can I say besides that you shouldn't have upgraded.
