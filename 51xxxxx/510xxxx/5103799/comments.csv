,starcrydragon,2011-01-20T00:55Z,"Beware of this one, my ISP sent me a notice of copyright infringement for The pilot episode, and I was running PG2.
Just uncheck that one and find a .rar for it.
Just because this guy is VIP does not make his torrents trustworthy.
I will say thanks for the episodes that did not put in deeper troubles."
