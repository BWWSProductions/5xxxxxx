More people are seeding the other version, I was getting it at 500kbps for the majority of the d/l.  If I'm the n00b then why are you people begging for seeders?"

,fleetkid,2009-10-03T19:46Z,"@M_Wagnerthr aka ... should I even type it...

There is no problem in being a noob. we gotta help them so they could also enjoy the great games. 

I am pretty sure you can never rip a game like Shroo does. That doesn't mean you are useless right.
"
,Reaperke,2009-10-03T21:01Z,"Updated nothing wrong with the game.
just killed Ivy and the game still works 
so i'll say it again thx shroo for this awsome rip!!!"
,N.M.H,2009-10-04T03:33Z,"Please seed guys, I've been trying to DL this for like 3 days now. This is ridiculous.. "
,fleetkid,2009-10-04T08:39Z,"Works fine :)

I usually don't like to play beat em up action games on a PC but this is awesome. Try it out guys.

Noob special instructions:

1. Use latest Winrar to extract the files to a partition with 5-6 GB free space

2. Run setup.bat (Run it as Admin for Vista/7)

3. Press Esc (escape) key in TPTB splash video to close the TPTB splash video

4. Press any key in the command window to start extraction

5. Wait (this is the important part), wait before complaining it is hanging or whatever. It will take a while at some points. Just check the disk space used and it will be changing.

6. Let DirectX update. Be connected to the internet.

7. Google search ""physx download"" and download PhysX 9.0x from the first link in search results (you will have to do this even if you have an older version of PhysX

8. Install PhysX

9. Go to the installation folder and run \Binaries\BmStartApp.exe

10. Chose settings and set the details level as per your system (try out Low first, is it is smooth go higher up)

11. Then chose play and watch the bat mobile zoom :) (If you just see a blank screen with audio just wait until the batman screen appears)"
,M_Wagner,2009-10-04T18:19Z,"Looks like others are having problems with this rip.  The RELOADED version works great and I've already finished it.  

As for ya'll calling me a n00b, typical teenager comment from brave internet tough guys.  "

go DL it and make an offline account, that will fix your problem, it will also save you from issues with a lot of other games.

,tangster03,2009-10-14T12:41Z,"Hi Shroo,

I wonder if you can help me.  I have this graphics problem in the middle of playing the game.  I started the game with no problems or errors.  When I was in the middle of saving the 3 doctors in the medical facility, graphic problems started to came out.  First, I experienced big lag-like, then after restarting the game, I experienced a much more big problems like I can't see Batman, the enemies, and the environment seems a little bit empty.  I already tried deleting the current game folder then re-extracting then re-running the setup.bat, but I still have the same problems.  I have core 2 quad processor, 8500 GT graphics adapter, 4 GB ram.  Can you help me with my problem?  The other games I downloaded from TPTB tag seems to run normal.  I appreciate your big help.  Thanks.  :)"
