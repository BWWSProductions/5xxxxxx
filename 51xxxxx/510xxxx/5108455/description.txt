Yippie!  The new season has started.  Technically, even though this came out hours ago and then I had to wait for a 720p release and wait for it to encode, I've had plenty of time to watch it, but I've just been too busy with SLEEP to actually get a chance.  I only woke up to take some screen shots, type this up and start the upload, so if any of you on the West Coast US are still awake like me, you should go back to bed TOO! :D

Unfortunately, this isn't one of the great Sky-HD rips which show off the full aspect ratio, it's a darned Cartoon Network rip which means it's cropped.  But only real videophiles will nitpick.  I'm sure if one of the British groups does do a rip of the 720p Sky-HD airing, I'll download, convert and then probably do another full-season upload of all those when the season is finished.  If you haven't already, I recommend downloading my HDRip conversions of S1 & the Feature film, plus I released all new HDRips using this 853x method of the Star Wars Saga.  All worth downloading due to their quality and the way they really give you a full experience even on a tiny iPod screen.

Enjoy, and May the Force Be With You!
