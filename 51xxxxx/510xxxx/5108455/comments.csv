Very nice."
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-04T01:32Z,Ahhh ... too bad ... no more Seth Green :(
,penetr8or,2009-10-04T09:44Z,"Nice, I like these two episodes.

Were they aired like this, or does anyone have them separately? Having two episodes merged together in 1 file always messes up my archive system, unless I compensate by subtracting 1 from every episode thereafter (ep3 becomes 2, and so on)

But thanks, this was great to watch :)"
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-04T22:11Z,"I thought about encoding these separately, but I'm still hoping a full-aspect ratio 720p version gets released ... if not, I'm sure I'll re-encode when the season is finished and I re-upload them all together."
