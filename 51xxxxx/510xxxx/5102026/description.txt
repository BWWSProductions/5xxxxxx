FOR THE LOVE OF...: ALIEN ABDUCTION 
March 1998
   
Channel 4 TV 

Un restrained by the usual TV half hour schedules and when smoking was still OK on TV - For the Love of was a chance for people to discuss 'fringe' culture phenomena on late night programming.
Jon Ronson meets six people who believe they have been abducted by aliens. The abductees are split into two camps - those with a conscious awareness of their experiences and those who remember seeing a UFO and then experiencing time loss. Those on the programme include Ros Reynolds who was abducted from a car while out with her boyfriend and returned two hours later. Her experience was so traumatic that she was afraid to leave her house for three years. James Millen and Elsie Oakensen developed new skills through their abductions. The former saw an advance in his IQ, while the latter became a spiritual healer.
