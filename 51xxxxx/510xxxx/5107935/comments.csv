Just one caveat, for American listeners in particular. The title is something of a misnomer. These are NOT histories of the Middle Ages, or even of the Middle Ages in Europe; but rather of the Middle Ages in WESTERN Europe, ie, in Europe west of the Rhine. Europe between the Rhine and the Elbe is barely dealt with;  as to Europe east of the Elbe, that might just as well have been on the moon. The brilliant civilisation of Kievan Rus', as well as major states, such as the empire of the Asens, are not even mentioned. Now, there may (or there may not) be good reasons for it, but, if they are, they are not made explicit, let alone discussed."
