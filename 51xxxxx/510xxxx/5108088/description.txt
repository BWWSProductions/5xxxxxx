ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Like his peer Michael W Smith, the exuberant Steven Curtis Chapman only gets better with each album. The 1996 release Signs of Life shows Chapman at his best. With thoughtful, introspective lyrics and crisp production, Signs of Life bursts with many high moments, including the intro "Lord of the Dance," spiced with Chapman's hot Dobro licks and zesty fiddle. The title song and "Let Us Pray" are the two most radio-ready cuts and will leave you with irresistible melodies. "Celebrate You," "Free," and "Hold On to Jesus" slow it down enough to showcase Chapman's calmer moments. There are few artists like Chapman that can combine his mastery of musicianship and forthright lyrics to produce releases like the must-have Signs of Life.
