please, if you'll find time to look at them and will be having something to answer, answer to all here ))"
[V],2nafish,2009-10-02T07:00Z,I don't believe there is a video for Stryper - Lonely or at least I've never seen it. Like you said there is probably only the live version. I don't have any of your requests. I consider it lucky just get the few metal mania videos I can off that crappy VH1 Classic channel. They have been playing the same videos over and over for the last 2 years so it's really hard getting any new videos.

,kvestantin,2009-10-02T07:34Z,"...and for all those videos that you constantly grab and share, of course!"
