This is Evan Sadler's mindblowing video presentation Who is Undermining our Monarchy and Freedoms? which exposes centuries of conspiratorial activities of Roman catholic church against the protestant British empire. Sadler uses numerous slides with book quotes, rare pictures and his vivid commentary to present the less known history of Catholic manipulation of the world and consequent protestant revolution which ultimately settled on the British isles and gave rise to the British empire as its protector. But the papacy continued to conspire against principles based on the freedom of individual to pursue his life as his conscience sees it fit. A tour-de-force of major events that shaped world history well into the 20th century, a rare and great overview of what actually happened behind the scenes as the battle rages on to this very day. 2h 20 min. long. A must see for everyone.
