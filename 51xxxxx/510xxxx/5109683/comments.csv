,rottenfruit,2009-10-08T23:31Z,Does anyone know why Nero won't allow me to pull this file into a DVD build? Nero says it is unable to import file. I have never had this problem with any other files when burning. Any help would be appreciated.

Apparently you are the one that sucks. First, who waits that long to download something? I mean there are like 4 other links that have 100+ seeders. Secondly, after having problems all the time with your dl speed, ever think it might be your network configuration? Sometimes you have to accept the fault in life. And lastly, if secret_myth decides not to seed it's ok. As long as there is at least one seed the torrent will stay alive. All he needs to do is seed until it looks like there are enough seeders. In short conclusion.... you fail at life."
