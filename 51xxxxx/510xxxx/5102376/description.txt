Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday; September 27, 1947), better known by his stage names Meat Loaf and Meat Loaf Aday, is an American rock musician and actor. He is noted for the Bat out of Hell album trilogy consisting of Bat Out of Hell, Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell and Bat out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. Bat out of Hell has sold more than 40 million copies.[2] After more than 30 years, it still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and stayed on the charts for over 9 years.[3][4]

Although he enjoyed success with Bat Out of Hell and Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell, and earned a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo for a track on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native United States. However, he has retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for number of weeks overall spent on the charts. He ranked 96th on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock'.

Meat Loaf has also appeared in over 50 movies or television shows[5] sometimes as himself, or as characters resembling his stage persona. His most notable roles include Eddie and Dr. Scott in the American premiere of The Rocky Horror Show, Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Robert "Bob" Paulson in Fight Club, a memorable role as Tiny the bouncer in Wayne's World, and JB's father in Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. Meat Loaf starred as Police Detective Jack Morris in The Hallmark Channel Original Film titled "Citizen Jane"






Bat Out of Hell 1977



Bat out of Hell is a 1977 album by singer Meat Loaf, songwriter Jim Steinman, and producer Todd Rundgren that became the third best-selling album worldwide (together with Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon) behind Michael Jackson's Thriller and AC/DC's Back in Black, continuing to sell approximately 200,000 per year. Rolling Stone magazine ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003. Its musical style is influenced by Steinman's appreciation of Richard Wagner, Phil Spector and Bruce Springsteen.

This album's title also became the title for two more Meat Loaf albums. Steinman produced the 1993 album, Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell. Desmond Child produced the 2006 album, Bat out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose.
