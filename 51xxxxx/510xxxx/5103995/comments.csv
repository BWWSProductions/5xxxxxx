,TGWGO,2009-09-29T18:30Z,Thank you so much for the upload! Would you mind uploading it in FLAC? If you would could you upload it in Ogg Vorbis (-q 6)?
,_Rarr,2009-09-29T18:54Z,"I'm afraid that I can't upload it in FLAC. Firstly because I don't have the correct programs to do so, and also because there is barely much difference between FLAC and 320kbps mp3.

And, besides, AFI are amazing, so you could always go out and buy the CD :P worth every penny. The artwork is pretty."
,capnJB,2009-09-29T20:26Z,Wow this is downloading way fast.. Thank you
,capnJB,2009-09-29T20:31Z,Flawless download.. Greatest band in the world. Thanks again.
,BlaqkQaos,2009-09-30T02:12Z,"Best. Band. Ever.

,Dhawny,2009-09-30T22:59Z,Thanks!!!
,TGWGO,2009-10-01T00:44Z,"@_Rarr:

mp3 is lossy and FLAC isn't I prefer to have a lossless collection with lossy Ogg Vorbis for my iPod so it's battery isn't killed from the awesomeness of FLAC. But yeah I will be buying the CD so I guess it isn't a big deal just there are no CD stores in my area so I have to go to Barrie (I don't get my license for another 10 months or so). And I'm on Linux so I don't know how hard it is to encode FLAC on Windows.

I'll upload FLAC when I buy the CD."

STFU ^.^"
,dehlanie,2009-10-10T05:35Z,"I have to agree great band, great track record, but this CD is    t e r r i b l e.  RIP AFI, I still love you, but please make sure your next release is not a joke."
,TheDangerous3,2010-02-23T07:22Z,"Very good rip sir! Thank you for your efforts! I bought the iTunes Expanded after listening to this rip. The Expanded has another 2 bonus tracks and they're as well as the rest of this gem.

@_proppi; @dehlanie;
AFI is amazing in that they make new albums with new sounds and can keep pulling it off. 
I don't know why everyone thought this was going to be ""sing the sorrow pt. II"" or would even want that, AFI isnt doing this all to be Popular they are actual artists.
When STS came out AFI ""sold out"" according to all the AOD fans. AOD was great but STS was more polished as is usually the case when a band actually has a studio putting money behind them and giving them options. After STS was well received a whole new fan base arose that then cried ""sell out"" when DUG hit the stores... Miss Murder was a huge success, it is and will likely remain their most successful song, These ""fans"" can't enjoy it though cause it was successful... child like logic, we all go through that phase were we are ""deep"" though and can't enjoy popular stuff, were different, like everyone else... so when you get to the other side of the experience maybe you will appreciate AFI's natural evolution from Hardcore Punk as teenagers to more Alternative/Punk with Sorrow then a more glamorous Alternative sound on december to the straight forward and overall sexy Rock sound of Crash Love.
If you want a band that never evolves or pushes their boundaries just put your All American Rejects or Nickelback back on and leave AFI to the people who actually appreciate quality music. You don't deserve ""Beautiful Thieves"", ""End Transmission"", ""To Shy to Scream"", ""Darling, I want to destroy you"" or the awesome bonus track ""Fainting Spells"" which are some of the best tracks on this imo most complete album of theirs."
,AlphaOkami,2010-08-31T11:21Z,"If you want a band with a sound that stays the same, go find AC/DC.  Here's a good torrent of them. :P

,BCRAvA182,2010-09-15T20:38Z,"Thank you.

I don't think this is the best AFI cd, but its not horrible."
,The_Wx13,2010-12-23T15:09Z,"Sing The Sorrow was the last good album, what I have heard off of this one was ok, so I suppose i'll be listening to it later. Thanks _Rarr!"
,Wolf.79,2011-01-08T10:00Z,"Awesome upload man...
Good to see some AFI fans out there :)"
