Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 64k mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

9/29/09 Rundown: Gun laws, Hugh Jackman gets angry, fun with 
Andy Rooney audio, editor of Rotten Tomatoes phones in, music 
discussion, Dana White in-studio.

Note: This replaces the previous upload which had sporadic
drop-outs for 7 minutes about an hour and a half in. 



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
