Just download it again, sometime garbage 'occasionally' gets through."
,ShootToKill,2009-10-05T02:48Z,"Yeah, if it says ""Corrupted"" the first time, just try installing it again."
,jess_b6,2009-10-07T00:04Z,Great! Juste thx ;)
,belizefan,2009-10-07T21:20Z,"reader downloaded perfectly, but the content (serial box update) is apparently corrupted, even after multiple attempts (using shoottokill's advice).

is there another place to obtain verified serial box content once you have the reader?"
,TorrentinoPB,2009-10-08T03:45Z,Idem for me. Nothing works even after many attempts.
[T],nobody2007,2009-10-08T10:25Z,"Download this bug fixed version of serial box encluding iSerialReader (2.0.7).
