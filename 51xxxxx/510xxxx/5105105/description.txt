Out of Ashes is a beautifully crafted album which skillfully takes the listener on a whirlwind trip through Benningtonâ€™s remarkable trials of recent life. He lays bare his deepest, most personal moments from when he hit rock-bottom, through his pain and suffering and to his discovery of new love and the process of healing. Bennington, with the help of his band mates, has managed to create a completely new sound, a sound very different from Linkin Park â€“ something that is often very difficult to achieve when starting a new project. It really is refreshing to hear such honest lyrics which donâ€™t have to be deciphered through daftly constructed metaphors. The meaning and message of each track is clear yet the listener still has room for their own personal interpretation. To any fan of pure honest music, whether you like Linkin Park or not, I suggest you pick up this album on October 13th, I know I will. Overall Rating Out Of 10: 9/10
