can this still be played on a PAL Xbox but just not on live? Or not at all. 

 great question , ive waited a long time for this=P ive downloaded it today and wanna know if i can play it on my pal console cause i dont wanna waste a dvd, i wanna know the answer =D"
,mrle264,2009-10-04T23:10Z,i could be wrong but i don't believe this is will work for a pal 360. when i ran abgx360 and ntsc and ntsc-j came as options. hope this helps.
,ozke,2009-10-05T14:28Z,"Nope, this will NOT work on a PAL xbox"
,anthony073,2009-10-05T16:48Z,"well just have to wait till the pal version comes out, great upload though"
,simonpip,2009-10-06T18:05Z,"Yep. Regions aren't related to where you can play them online. Some games are locked, so a console set to PAL (not something you can change) can't play those locked to NTSC. Same concept as DVD regions.
A word of warning, just because it can be played on your console doesn't mean MS can't see you playing your imported game. And these days, pretty much anything redflags you as a pirate. Have a P in your name? You're obviously a pirate!

Looking forward to a PAL release, I've decided to suspend cynicism and expect this to be every bit as good and fresh as seeing the first movie for the first time. *crosses fingers*"
,skytwin,2009-10-07T13:27Z,"MS would never ban you for playing imports so that comment is a little misleading.

MS would ban you for a shit stealth job though so perhaps wait til this is verified.

But yeah, its region locked."
,guyver2077,2009-10-07T23:50Z,why is abgx taking to long to update their db! i want to play this game dammit
