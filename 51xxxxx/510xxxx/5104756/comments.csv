,Madd_Dowg,2009-09-30T04:01Z,"Ok Extremezone  dont hit yourself too hard on the back lol. For a cam its proble an 8/8, but for watching its really down in the 5/5, or 6/6 range. Still watchable but not really enjoyable. Thanks for the up, I'll have to wait for the R5, or go see it. Thanks"

,7thSense,2009-09-30T20:33Z,"extremezone, it's getting a little annoying, you arguing with people who give their honest rating. Just put the vid up and let people give their feedback. Don't you understand that someone rating their own upload is worthless? You're going to be biased. The audio is pretty poor, no matter how much you fuss about it."
,Wayward3051,2009-09-30T22:33Z,"Hey yo, extremezone, I know you happy about your audio and all. And Imma let you finish. But this audio is the same as all the others. AS ALL THE OTHERS. -Kanye West."

,bajendanne,2009-10-03T11:00Z,"TELESYNC (TS): A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled."

Great JOB!"
,MyKingdomHeart,2009-10-04T07:17Z,"THANK YOU EXTREMEZONE!
       I think it is funny how people bitch about stuff on tpb for a few reasons. 
1. All this shit is free! Take it or leave it! :)
2. Most of these spamming fags have never uploaded a thing! Lol (Im pretty sure extremezone has uploaded 800+ torrents. Thank you e.z.)
3. Extremezone dosnt get paid for this shit. He does it to give us some entertainment.  If uploaders stopped because of stupid comments people would bitch at them for not uploading!)
4. Anyone ever heard of the word thank you? 

Once again. Thank you extremezone for all your hard work and dedication and most of all for all the FREE torrents. :D :D :D"
,vrolok_1,2009-10-04T07:46Z,"apparently some people are confused about the difference between a TS and a Cam


TS:  Direct input from the projector with better sound.  Typically uses a video output from the projector

CAM:  exactly what it sounds like...somebody used a Camcorder to record the movie.


TS will usually result in quality that is on par with TV broadcast over the airways...or a old VHS tape converted to Digital

Cam is usually like softcore homemade porn with shitty quality and barely watchable."
,vrolok_1,2009-10-04T07:47Z,"so that being said...is this a TS or a CAM

can somebody simply put up quality on a 1-10 scale.

You are a disgrace to TPB.  No one gives a shit about what you have to say.  We look at the comments to see A:  V:  M:   Thats it.  No one wants to hear you bitch and whine over the most meaningless thing in the world.  Plus extreme zone is an amazing uploader.  I will just assume you haven't been layed in years and you just vent your sexual frustration on these torrents."
,MyKingdomHeart,2009-10-07T01:42Z,"@ blah_blah_bloots
       Thank you for your opinion. Now would you please comment on the quality or say thank you.  Think of it this way. Since you think this is such a ""shit"" movie, good thing you got it here for free and didn't ave to pay for it. :)"

Thanks for the up extremezone! Though the quality is kinda shitty because it's a TS, but I appreciate your dedication to upload this anyway. Honestly speaking EXTREMEZONE!! I still do think you're an asshole for spamming and fucking up the Bay search engine. You are one of the most popular Pirate here in the Bay at the same time holding the recognition as the worst green skull ever!.

,Wayne94,2009-10-17T07:42Z,"nice movie, u shud watch in the theatres for good quality"
,worldnick,2009-10-17T09:59Z,"Review: Bruce Willis is great.  His wife is good.  The story makes sense.  The only problem I have is with the execution.  I think this movie would have needed a few more million dollars to do it right really because if this takes place 20 years in the future or in any kind of future where this stuff is possible then there would likely be a lot more difference in the way we live than JUST these robots.  For instance why even use cars?  Just run there with your super speed.  Why even live in reality?  If you can feel what your robot does then you wouldn't even need to be in reality at all.  How do people procreate?  Sports would probably be really cool.  I think they just switched out people for robots and barely changed anything else.  It got the message across, but if something like this ever approached reality there would be so many other changes to our daily lives this would hardly be the biggest.  Also to be a little nit-picky everything about these surrogates is nearly possible except a brain interface that you can FEEL through.  That isn't even a zygote in a laboratory anywhere so most people wouldn't want to pretend to be robots without getting any physical pleasure out of it.

Audio: 4 (barely understandable)
Video: 5 (washed out: however the actual movie probably looks awesome in the theater or for real)

Thanks for the great upload!!
