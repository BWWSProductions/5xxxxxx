,beelover9481,2009-10-26T05:03Z,If it's real why is the song only 3:22 when the official time is 3:33 to coincide with the song
,ebrox,2010-02-03T12:02Z,"i have an album version and the music video version which are different lengths.  i cannot find the remix that plays on the radio at the gym though.  it has the phrase ""get me out of here"" in the middle several times."
