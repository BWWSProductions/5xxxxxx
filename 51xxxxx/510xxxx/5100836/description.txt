You heard the story. The one about the goriest, bloodiest splatter fest ever, the one made in the â€™80s but mysteriously lost. Flash forward to now: Young fright fans search for the secret location where the movie was shot, hoping to find the film. What they find is that the mysterious slasher flick is more than a movie. Itâ€™s real. And theyâ€™re its newest stars. The terrified cinephiles confront a demented killer who wears a nightmarish babydoll mask. Wait, Babyface is just a character from the movie, right? Wrong. Heâ€™s alive. Heâ€™s waiting. And heâ€™s thrilled to meet fans who will die - slowly, gruesomely, shockingly - for his art. Roll camera!
