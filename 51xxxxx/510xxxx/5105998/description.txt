Here is a selection of music for you, it contains many different bands.  The following types of Rock are included, Progressive Rock, Krautrock, Psychedelic Rock and Avant-garde type Progressive also plus maybe others that are slightly different.  I am currently working on putting this whole collection together and it is going to be very big in many different parts.

Next to follow will be 'C' and 'D' etc..  It is going to take some work so please be patient until I can eventually get more parts done.  I hope you can take some time to download the first 2 parts already and have a listen to this very obscure music from the late sixties, early seventies and beyond.

If you're looking for something strange to listen to and you're bored of the same old stuff day after day then this is the torrent for you.  This is not your average kind of music you would hear in the charts every week.  It is some very artistic forms of Rock music and has lots to offer so don't miss out here!

I have made sure that each MP3 is at an outstanding quality of 320kbps CBR @ 44.1 Khz, the best possible MP3 sound I can produce.  Bearing in mind the size of this whole collection when it is finished is going to be huge I shall be making them all into MP3s so that it will save on disk size.

All cover art is included with each album, sorry if the track listings for the back covers are slightly different but it's because I couldn't find a better cover than the one present!  Also I have made sure that each track is fully tagged ready to be loaded onto say an IPOD or whatever MP3 player you might choose.

Don't miss this folks, it's gonna be a monster Rock collection once I get it going...


Hope you enjoy this music!
