,crazybeaner,2009-10-24T02:24Z,Question.. I extracted this and it had a mdf file so it patched on abgx360 and made a DVD file to burn. During abgx it said 2k10 but when I burn it instead it burns another game I downloaded called borderlands. What is wrong?

,jason119,2010-03-21T08:53Z,"once i get the torrents, how do i put the files on the disc, because they are files....i need some help with this"
,sin_city_prince,2010-05-17T00:15Z,"wow, you guys need to learn how to do shit right. @themamba247 verbatim is what you need period if you want the game to perform well on your 360. i downloaded this game last night and just got through playing it and it works just fine, no freezing, no lag, no anything. just smooth sailing. so thanks gamerguuy for the upload, download is kind of slow tho other than that, good stuff man."
