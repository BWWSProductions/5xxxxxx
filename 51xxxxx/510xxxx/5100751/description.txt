One Touch - Sugababes [2000]


One Touch is the debut album by British girl group Sugababes, released by London Records on 27 November 2000 in the United Kingdom and by December 2000 in most other European territories. The trio worked with producer Cameron McVey on the majority of the album, which produced four top forty hits, including the top five hit "Overload", and "Run for Cover."
Despite peaking at number 26 on the UK Album Charts and being certified Gold by the BPI, and faring even better in German-speaking Europe, where it reached the top ten in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, the sales of One Touch did not meet London Records' expectations, and the group eventually got dropped in Autumn 2001, making it their only release with the label. In addition, it became the group's only album with the group's original line-up. SiobhÃ¡n Donaghy left the group stating initially that she wanted to pursue a fashion career, eventually being diagnosed with clinical depression amid reports of in-fighting between the Sugababes members
The album received favourable reviews, with critics applauding the girls, who were all 16 years of age at the time, for writing and singing songs, which were considered to be unusually mature for their age.
