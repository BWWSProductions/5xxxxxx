,MrOsborn,2009-10-06T19:56Z,"The sample is definitely from the source. I had to go back an check myself because I was surprised by how dark it was in many scenes.

Good film though, and thanks. I'd just recommend that people follow Killawife's advice because this type of film demands a clearer picture IMO. It's not like Batman Begins where I could just write off a few seconds worth of relatively unimportant fight scenes, annoying though they were."
