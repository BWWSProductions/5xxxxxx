A PDF of "Ragnar Benson's Guide to Home and Recreational Use of High Explosives".

I hear it's hard to find - certainly every copy I've downloaded has been absolute crap, if even the pictures are there - most of the time, it's just a poorly formatted copy of all the text.

Not this one, my friends! This is the actual images, everything's complete.

Rumour has it this book is out-of-circulation; I don't believe it's illegal.
