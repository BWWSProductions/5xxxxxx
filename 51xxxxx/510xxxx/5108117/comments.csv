,Draco878,2009-10-07T00:02Z,me too doesn't work.... :( It says me: You cannot apply the patch to this file! I drag n drop the civilization beyond the sword icon in the crack unsucessful...
,SpudsBM,2009-10-08T02:06Z,"ok guys this does work it just takes time, when i first tried it took me 3 days. 

UsernameHere: your problem is that you didnt properly follow step 5.5, try it on all your civilization folders and see if that works. 

Draco878: you might not of picked the right ipatch file you actually open ipatch up then show its package contents then scroll down the giant list to ipatcher not ipatch and show its package contents then follow step 8. I will fix this in the description"

,RomanSPQR,2009-10-15T20:49Z,"The crack is not as difficult to apply as the instructions lead you to believe.

1. install beyond the sword
2. go to the BTS app in the BTS folder
3. right click the ""beyond the sword"" app and show package contents
4. get info on ""contents""
5. give read/write access to everyone and click on the gear to apply to contents.
6. run the patch on the BTS app.
7. done."
