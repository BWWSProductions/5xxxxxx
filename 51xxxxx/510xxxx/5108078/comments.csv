,MomoShab,2009-10-04T22:11Z,"Another useless torrent for Xbox 360 users. It shows as being only 2:17 and then cuts off when it plays back fine on the PC. Only by opening and resaving in Windows Movie Maker is it playable and that's a PITMFA. This the 3rd or 4th Dollhouse ep that I've been burned by. Whatever EZTV is doing, STOP IT!! DO IT RIGHT!!!"
,sg3232,2009-10-08T06:18Z,"Momoshab, you need to find someone who does a download for Xbox 360. eztv gets it right for the majority, and I for one appreciate it. Dollhouse is only available on PayTV where I live, and I don't have pay tv, so this is the only way I can see it. If eztv tries to change the download for you and stuffs it up for the rest of us I will hunt you down and give a wedgie! :)"
,ZenRhino,2009-10-09T18:52Z,"thanks, +1 as usual!!!"
,ZenRhino,2009-10-09T18:54Z,@MomoShab  I don't see you making anything available... so quit bitching & be thankful for those who do. Or why not get an app like Vuze and convert it to your device yourself?
,Sudoku123,2009-12-18T10:28Z,"Momo:  Waaa, this free stuff isn't working!

Dude, find what works or don't.  But don't complain to people that provide it, especially when you're obviously a special needs case."
,Sudoku123,2009-12-18T10:29Z,"By the way, thanks eztv.  Massive amounts of great shows available.  You **rock**"
,RALSTON8358,2009-12-23T23:54Z,Thanks.
