LEGEN â€“ a band which started a new music expression in Croatia at the beginning of 90's, merging traditional chants and instruments with electric guitar and synth sounds.

After playing throughout the World, making music for theatre plays and movies the members of the band decided to take a break from each other after 10 years.
The seed Legen planted brought a lot of fruits cause each member of the band took his own path continuing the work.

MOJMIR NOVAKOVIC â€“ the frontman and one of the founders of Legen formed a new band KRIES (bonfire)
