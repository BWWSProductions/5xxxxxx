@knockX2

You're an idiot. You say ""there's a difference between R5 and DVD otherwise they wouldn't call them two different things"" yet you fail to mention what the difference is.

That's because you're a moron TROLL who fucks with people who contribute to this site. R5 refers to the Region Code 5 and an R5 can be almost indistinguishable from a DVDRip since many movies are published on DVD with minimal editing. Meaning you will never tell the difference.

So if you're going to be petty and argue whether this is a certain set of letters in the title and not appreciate the upload then you're a fucktard who needs to LEAVE. THANKS to XoLWoX!

you ppl actually are aware r5's are dvd-rips? just that those dvd's are released bevore postprocessing...
as if it was that hard to screw up a dvd-rip so it looks like a TC...
depends on the R5-quality either it looks like shit or like the final dvd1/2

,clyde4210,2009-10-02T20:31Z,"R5's are crap copies period. They look more like a clean cam copy.

They in no way resemble a dvd copy. Please do not post vids calling them dvd when in fact are nothing more than an R5.

As for being a vip that matters shit to me. If I wanted I could be vip but I choose not to. 

A R5 is just that a R5. A dvd copy is just that a dvd. 

R5's are not dvd's. Unless of course you live in a third world country where 75% of the population lives in poverty."

just take the fuckin free movie and shut your mouths. if you want quality go to the theater, if you can manage to remove yourself from the computer chair."
,dopeSOAP,2009-10-11T10:34Z,"I made an account just to say that you're a fucking TOOL if you don't understand that an R5 is actually a DVD.. like the DISK itself, its just in a different language HENCE the different audio when its converted to the correct language. So in reality an R5 = DVDRip that has an audio track ran over it. 

If you want something to complain about go yell at the guys with cam versions where they can't focus or hold the camera still for more then a few seconds."
,dopeSOAP,2009-10-11T10:39Z,"oh, and stop being a virgin knockx2, jesus dude.. you REALLY need a life.

""I know I'll never get tired of calling you out on your bullshit ;)""

... Seriously? Is that your life goal? To harass people about their post title on a public tracker? hahaha wtf is wrong with you?!"
