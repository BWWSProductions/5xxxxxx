Ripped by r3d
I do not take any credit for ripping.
I uploaded this because there was only a promo release. No others.

320kbps, release version so there's none of those fucking "digital watermarks". :)

Please keep in mind that I do not have the best upload speed in the world, 30kbytes/s so please seed!
I will seed for as long as I can.
