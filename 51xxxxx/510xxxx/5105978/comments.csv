,visable3,2010-05-12T00:31Z,this is a good video splitter its fast and easy to use 10/10 for app and download cheers robinghood.
,1stmatejohn,2010-05-27T08:28Z,Quick and dirty splitter. Very basic (almost too basic). Gets a little buggy after about 30 consecutive splits - system reboot clears that. 6.5/10.  Thanks RH.
