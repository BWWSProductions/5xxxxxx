[T],Mincan,2009-09-26T16:53Z,No seed? How do I download this?
,PoENoZ,2009-09-26T18:04Z,"Add the trackers, it's just a torrent that I uploaded here on piratebay from other sites. because I did't find it on PB :)"
[T],Mincan,2009-09-26T20:08Z,The repack I've seen is 434 MB.
,d23c612d4b,2009-09-27T00:14Z,"Also what's strange is that files altered by Razor1911 update 5 or 6 are NOT altered by this patch, though it states it can be applied to version 1.0 to update it to version 1.4. Strange."
[T],Tanauser,2009-09-27T12:34Z,Confirmed working upon Razor's update 6
,Ivica121,2009-09-27T12:42Z,Yes this works with razor update 5 i 6
[T],Mincan,2009-09-27T19:30Z,"Works for me as well, but as someone else noticed I see changes back to pre update state. The text on the city names is blurry to read again (like no cleartype) also some new random fuck ups in the game, army unit icons getting mixed up with each other (cavalry with artillery, vice versa, can't replenish), but the game only CTD once in the entire time I've played Ep 4.

So all in all it works, I've even seen the Mexicans invade by sea with a navy... nice, this is the only thing I cared about in this update. Realistic now :)"
,AshSocka,2009-09-30T23:52Z,How the hell do you install this? Instructions would actually be nice.
,AshSocka,2009-09-30T23:58Z,"Does not work. I keep getting a:

Application Load Error: 50000065434 error. "
[T],Tanauser,2009-10-02T11:04Z,Extract the files in a separate folder and replace carefully each ( 1 by 1 )   (careful with the campaigns directory)
,adiSal,2009-10-02T14:34Z,will this work with the Kaos release and Kaos fix??? 
,GiGaFlare,2009-10-03T18:30Z,"Hey Can anyone ANSWER this Question>>THOSE THIS WORK WITH ""KAOS"" RELEASE??

[T],Tanauser,2009-10-03T19:41Z,"It should work with ANY version , this one is universal ; (as long as you are careful about replacing the files)

I repeat 
This Update 1.4 is 100 % working"
,GiGaFlare,2009-10-03T19:51Z,"Thanks for the fast Rep. but Ain't working for me with KAOS release pack KAOS Fix.

I already Copied the Crack to the Folder and Also Tried a few Extra things but No Luck...

IF ANYONE GOT THIS WORKING WITH A KAOS RELEASE (UNUPDATED)PLEASE DO SHARE HOW YOU DID IT.

Thanks in advance to the one who would help."
[T],Mincan,2009-10-04T06:52Z,"I had the KAOS release. I think this one (RAZOR 1911) is better, I do not believe you are able to update the KAOS one at all."
,GiGaFlare,2009-10-05T12:41Z,"Oh Dang it T.T Now I have to DL another one but this time its 11gb...I only have a bloody 35kb\/ps Max DL and 1kb\/ps max UL and at morning I get a raging 500-1000PING!!!Next time around I'll just get a Razor release...

Peace"
,GiGaFlare,2009-10-05T15:41Z,"Mincan Seems there is no Hope for Kaos...

,kaan90gs,2009-10-07T16:03Z,"Application Load Error: 50000065434 error. 
how can I fix it?"
,AlexCCCP,2009-10-09T02:19Z,Crashes on a clean razor1911 install when starting a campaign. Any ideas??
,AshSocka,2009-10-09T18:29Z,"""Extract the files in a separate folder and replace carefully each ( 1 by 1 ) (careful with the campaigns directory) ""

Um, what do you mean by replace each one carefully with the (1 by 1)? I don't understand what you mean."
,GiGaFlare,2009-10-09T19:46Z,"What he means by ""Extract the files in a separate folder and replace carefully each ( 1 by 1 ) (careful with the campaigns directory)""
is to
1.Extract the Archive(Meaning this DL)
2 Go to Folder where to extract it
3.Press Setup
4 Change the Intallation Path to anywhere other than where you put your game
5.Go to the path where you intall the update
6 You can see Folders/Files there
7.Carefully copy the Folder/Files to your game.

Now thats what he Meant by ""Extract the files in a separate folder and replace carefully each ( 1 by 1 ) (careful with the campaigns directory)""

Hope this helps."
,AlexCCCP,2009-10-10T00:06Z,Aha... works on a clean razor install with manual copying of the files
[T],Tanauser,2009-10-10T08:02Z,Who will  Upload the latest Razor  Update 1.5 ?
,torrentboy1311,2010-06-17T14:29Z,Will this work with PROPHET?
