Try VTV: https://thepiratebay.org/user/VTV/
or AiTB: https://thepiratebay.org/user/AiTB/
or xsaimex: https://thepiratebay.org/user/xsaimex/"
,pelph,2009-09-30T13:53Z,Or wonder why you are so obsessive with getting ppl to quit eztv?
,SOBB3029,2009-10-08T08:54Z,"Brilliant show. Keep 'em coming. 

I have no problems with TPB. It was down for a few days but so what, they always bounce back. As for EZTV, stick with them, best quality at the best price !  FREE !"
