There's the imdb link...

The boards are full of bad reviews, and the news articles don't look promising...

I am a HUGE Frasier fan, and Kelsey is a fantatic actor, so I doubt it will be THAT bad, he will be able to pull it off.....

Lets not forget that Frasier recieved awkward reviews for the first few episodes, and although the writing for the show was epic, it was Kelsey that took it to huge heights!

Quality will be perfect as all the eztv torrents I've downloaded have been

21mins remaining, will copy to the ps3 and watch, will post afterwards...."

Had a few laugh aloud bits, and the Mrs loved it.....

Will look forward to seeing more, I hope it isn't cancelled...I doubt Kelsey would put himself out there for a pilot only contract...."
