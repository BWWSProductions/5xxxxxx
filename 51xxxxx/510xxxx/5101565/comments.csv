,troweprice05,2009-09-27T03:08Z,can someone confirm that it works now?
,xkkat69x,2009-09-27T06:36Z,Zip file corrupted or it was zipped with the wrong permissions.  Either way I can't unzip it.
,xkkat69x,2009-09-27T19:00Z,"On that note, you can also just download the 1.2.3 version straight from the Things website and use one of the serial numbers from the latest KCNcrew pack (they say 1.1.2 but it I found quite a few that work with 1.2.3)"
,zogulusnig,2009-09-27T22:56Z,"troweprice05, how are you ZIPing the file?  Are you right-clicking, and choosing 'compress', or using some other tool?

I also discovered that many of the current serials work for the 'from their site', current 1.2.3 version.

,troweprice05,2009-09-28T01:51Z,"thats exactly what i did, downloaded and used a serial. and i right clicked and compressed, do you have a suggestion for something better?"
,zogulusnig,2009-09-28T04:34Z,"There are a ton of tools out there that will do it, but that's the way I would have suggested doing it.  I can't imagine what is wrong.  Weird."
,eldiab21,2009-10-01T16:44Z,so far so good !!! Thanks so much ! 
,zogulusnig,2009-10-03T10:51Z,"troweprice05 ? this file is working as expected.  I DL'd it today, just to check it out, and it unZIPs just fine.

Thanks for the extra effort!"
