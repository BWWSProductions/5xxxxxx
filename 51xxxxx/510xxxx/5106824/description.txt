Recorded Books has taken the acclaimed Spoken Arts poetry collection produced as an LP in 1969, remastered it, added succinct introductions that provide a biographical and literary context for each poet whose works follow. One may, of course, quibble with who might have been omitted or lament the exclusion of a particular piece. However, the complete three-volume series consists of 464 poems and is not only the most comprehensive of the audio poetry anthologies on the market today, it is also beautifully balanced, showcasing, along with the poets typically represented in such anthologies, the important contribution of many modern American female and African American poets all too frequently omitted.

Most of the poets are highly impassioned readers of their own material. The sound quality of the earliest recordings is a bit uneven, but given the technology of the day, that is no more than could reasonably be expected. 

Kellgren presents all of the introductory information throughout the series. Her clear voice and engaging tone keep the biographies and literary criticism from sounding repetitive or dry. This audiobook should be nibbled at rather than listened to from cover to cover. Enjoy discovering the voices of your favorite poets, and then go back again and again to learn about the rest. 

Cover scans included.

Thanks for sharing & caring.
Cheers, FerraBit
