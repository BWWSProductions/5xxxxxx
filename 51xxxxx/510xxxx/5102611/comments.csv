,Potvora007,2009-09-29T20:59Z,"I have not downloaded it, but I think I can say for sure that some of the language packs that are supposed to be version 3 have NOT been released, like Pashto. Check official RS website. "

,dowant,2009-10-08T11:57Z,"So i download the torrent. Install it no problem, add the crack, that also works good. Now i mount the german v3 lesson 1 iso and i go onto rosetta stone and click add language. It searches for the language and its unable to detect it. i tried poweriso, daemon tools, and thats not the problem. I figure its the crack or something? any solutions to my problem?"

,dangerzone.il,2009-10-26T19:36Z,f---ing noobs nobody told you to downloads this torrent if you're not happy go to the store and buy it beside why don't you just search the pirate bay for the missing language pack or do we have to post the links for you too. winy little noobs

Can you please provide me with idiot proof step-by-step instructions of how to install the langauges after I finally get this thing downloaded? I have two potential barriers to success with this download - I have vista and I'm about as tech savey as a dead earthworm. I do have PowerISO. I also want to install it on my laptop which has XP. Can someone give me instructions for Dummies (or blitering idiots)?  At least I admit my limitations. Thanks for making this torrent available."
,rijulpuri,2009-11-10T01:56Z,Pashto isn't working either :(
,bulletcowboy,2009-11-12T17:02Z,"To get this working this is what I had to do: Extract all the files from the original download file into any file you prefer. Run setup - copy crack from where you extracted - copy & replace into program install destination. I couldn't get the mounted language packs to copy into rosetta so I burnt them using just Windows 7 ""burn 2 Disc"" feature onto a DVD+rw. When the program is started up DO NOT connect to the internet. Good idea to disconnect from interent entirely during inital setup & cracking. It will ask for a language pack & automatically scans for packs on CD / DVD... Works a treat, although does say packs are limited due to not being activated but yet to see a problem... Good Work Harry :)"

,ardera,2009-11-12T21:39Z,"Don't know what I am doing wrong, but I downloaded the Turkish file, I mount the ISO file, and Rosetta Stone is not recognizing the language ""pack"".  I have RS 3.2.11, as I am unable to successfully get 3.3.5 to work with a patch/crack.

Do I HAVE to be running 3.3.5 in order to use these files?"
,ardera,2009-11-12T21:42Z,"BTW, I have already tried burning ISO to disc using Alcohol 120%, but won't recognize language from disc either."
,bulletcowboy,2009-11-12T23:25Z,"@ardera If I were you I would download revounistaller ( google it ) & delete the current rosetta you have installed using the advanced removal option. This insure no trace of this on your drive. Then install this as described & make sure that you uncheck the ""start after installation"" box, otherwise you are screwed & will have 2 start again. Make you get the crack in correctly & do not whatever you do, have the internet connected intially as it tries to sneak a couple of internet checks... Btw it has been said not all the packs work like I said b4 put them on disc first instead of a virtual drive as I had trouble when doing this trying Magic Disc & Ultra Iso..."
,ardera,2009-11-13T00:37Z,"@bulletcowboy
I will definitely give that a try.  I guess the thing that is confusing me is that language packs I have downloaded from other torrents work just fine.  It's the iso from this torrent that isn't working.  But the Turkish is the only one I downloaded from here, the others may work fine, I just don't need them."
,DeepBluez,2009-11-13T04:02Z,"great...the language packs work, but when i downloaded the PORTUGUESE V 1,2,3 and PORTUGUESE (BRASIL) V 1,2,3 and try to open the PORTUGUESE one, the rosetta stone picks it up as a brasil language."
,ardera,2009-11-13T06:28Z,"Ok, I am getting really tired of trying to get the Turkish to work.  I have installed 3.3.5, but it has yet to detect the language.  I have mounted the Turkish iso file, I have burned it to a disc, for the 2nd time, and still nothing.  There is also apparently an autorun file, that tries to install an older version of RS, in the Turkish file.
Can anyone confirm that they HAVE gotten the Turkish to work?!  The others seem to work just fine, although I only tried the (Latin) Spanish and the Arabic."
,humdee,2009-11-13T19:25Z,"ardera,
The Turkish files in this torrent are for v2 of the program (specifically v2.0.8.1).  I dl'd them and compared them to the v2 files I already have."
,ardera,2009-11-13T21:38Z,"@humdee
Would that be why I can't get the dumb thing to work?  Since I now have 3.3.5 installed?

@harry711
Description needs to be updated, as it claims all the files are version 3."
,ardera,2009-11-13T22:05Z,"@humdee

,dylanb,2009-11-16T00:51Z,"What a heap of shit, like DeepBluez said, Portuguese is recognised as Brazilian, that's because it is, they have put the same files on twice and just removed 'brazilian' from the file names and hoped nobody would notice, look at the file sizes. Rosetta Stone don't do Portuguese EU, just Brazilian. Why don't you just copy and paste all the files a 100 times, and make it 1000's of gigabytes, maybe that will compensate for your small penis?"

This sucks!!! I've now spent four days downloading this torrent because I couldn't get the Thai CD to work and I thought my torrent client where acting up if I only downloaded one of the CD's! Why not try and label correctly so you don't waste peoples time? :(

Is there anywhere one could find a working version 3 CD for Thai to download??"
,H1JAAK,2009-11-18T00:24Z,I'm having the same problem as ahmadpop with the Farsi language pack. Can anyone confirm that this is even a real v3 pack? I'm trying to learn Farsi so i can impress my fiance's parents so if anyone knows where to get a real v3 farsi or the proper RS version please respond to my comment. 
,H1JAAK,2009-11-18T00:27Z,Just read Potvora007's comment. Anyone have a link for a real farsi v3 or for the right RS v2?

Once again, I continued my search and tonight I hit paydirt. I came across Hindi files at General Search. http://www.general-search.com. I thought for sure it would be another BS set of files. Well, my friends, I was pleasantly surprised. Look for Hindi at General Search and you will find all 3 of them complete with Audio Companion. Merry Christmas! It will take some time to download but it's well worth it. PS: I want credit if this turns into a torrent!

Just kidding, sort of........ "
,812many,2009-12-17T04:56Z,do you have V 1-3 of Thai ?
,Novawire,2009-12-17T09:10Z,"No, I don't have Thai. I've looked for that recently also. So far, I haven't found anything. I take that back....what I found was Version 2 language packs. If I run across it, I'll tell you where to find it. Likewise, I hope that you will tell me where to find Version 3 packs as well. I'm also interested in Audio Companions so if you know where to score a set for German Version 3, please let me know. "
,Thurizdan,2009-12-19T03:17Z,"When I run the setup from either the application or by mounting the image, I get an error just before the installation completes saying a program that is part of the installer did not complete correctly and it has to cancel the install. Has anyone got a solution for this or should I try another torrent? Running Vista(x64)."
,Novawire,2009-12-19T08:14Z,Which Application Version are you running?
,Novawire,2009-12-19T08:25Z,"If there is an option to run the Application in a 32 bit mode, you should try it. I'm not entirely sure if the program will run in a 64 bit environment. From the information found at the Rosetta Stone site it doesn't appear that they recommend 64 bit. It's worth a shot to attempt to run the product in a 32 bit mode if possible."
,pochenikan,2009-12-19T17:05Z,"Novawire, I downloaded level 1 Hindi v3 from the site you posted but I can't seem to get them to be recognized by RS when I mount them on PowerISO. How did you get the Hindi to work? I have the version 2 but it kinda sucks. I saw how v3 RS is bc I dled Irish for my wife and it I like it much better. Could you please help me with this? And thanks a ton for finding v3 Hindi! Greatly appreciated!"
,Novawire,2009-12-19T20:20Z,I don't think this makes a difference but you could try mounting with Daemon tools. This is the virtual drive software I am using. You can also try burning the image off onto a CD-ROM. I have installed the packs both ways and each works fine. Which Application Version are you running? I think at least Version 3.35 may be required. Can you open the ISO to see the files inside? Get back to me when you can.

,Thurizdan,2009-12-20T01:39Z,"I got it to install fine on 32-bit XP and there don't seem to be any registry entries for Rosetta Stone, do you think I'd be able to copy the program files to the other machine and have it run?"
,Novawire,2009-12-20T04:59Z,"Okay that's not a good sign. It's an indicator that something isn't right. You should be able to open that ISO file and view the contents. When you mount the ISO image, can you see the files then? If not, then we need to try something else. To ensure that the files are being unpacked correctly, why don't you go ahead and grab 7Zip and extract the ISO file that way. Perhaps whatever you are using isn't completely unpacking the files. Just a thought. I'm thinking out loud."
,Novawire,2009-12-20T05:13Z,"Better yet, it looks like someone made a torrent from this material. The entire Hindi package can now be found at Piratebay. Sheezzz. These guys didn't give me any credit. Didn't even mention me. No honorable mention no nothing. Darn! Oh well, what can you do? Download it and enjoy! Well, now that Hindi has been found, I guess I need to search for something else. If I find anything, I'll post it here or at least tell you where to get it. Happy Holidays!"
,pochenikan,2009-12-20T05:16Z,"Ok, here's the thing...When I DL the file and try to extract it PowerISO it says""This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Set Associations control panel"". I'm gonna try to dl what you suggested and I'll let you know what happens. Thanks so much for your help!"
,pochenikan,2009-12-20T05:26Z,"Oh, I'm working on dling the Torrent. Thanks a ton for your help Nova! I hope this works...!"
,Novawire,2009-12-20T05:35Z,"You won't be disappointed. The package really does work and it truly is Version 3 Hindi. I understand your apprehension and I share it in many ways. For example, I don't have any idea how many times I have been told that a language pack is truly Version 3 but after I download it, turns out it is Version 2. Very frustrating. If not that problem, there was the issue of the package being plain old garbage that didn't even work. The directory structure was all wrong and it simply wasn't even close to being the correct product. It wasn't Version anything it was just junk. Complete waste of time. I hate when people do that. Well, I wouldn't think of wasting people's time in that fashion. This is the real thing, no question about it. "
,duucktape,2009-12-21T08:48Z,"i have a problem wiht some of the language iso's

other then that its works great and prefectly if you follow instructions "
,Novawire,2009-12-22T01:40Z,"The first thing that comes to mind for me is the possibility that you may be using a Version 3 Application with Version 2 language CD-ROMs. If that is the case, this can explain why the language packs aren't being recognized by the software. The two products are not compatible with each other. All of the components must match. I'm just thinking out loud but this is the first thing that comes to mind. Make sure your products match. "

Turkish
and Vietnamese,

My question is there any chance you might be able to get these in the future? Thanks! ^_^"
,Edict,2009-12-25T09:13Z,"To the best of my knowledge (and I've done my research) there are *NO* v3 Farsi (Persian) *.iso files on the interwebs (as of this date). The fact that it's listed as 'Farsi V3 Level 1 - 2' is a give away that it's v2 (I haven't seen an *.iso that has multiple levels). If this is what you're looking for, don't disappoint yourself with this (and related) downloads. 

Secondly, and this is addressed to you true-blue pirates out there, if someone could distribute even the first level of the v3 Farsi, I would not be the only one in your debt."
,Dobroslav,2010-01-02T20:53Z,"I've downloaded the Greek language files, and i believe that they are for older versions of Rosetta Stone because the program doesn't recognize the image drive and the folders inside the ISO have different structure and are from older date than, for example the french language files that worked just well.  
Can anyone perhaps suggest where to find Greek for RS 3? 

Thank you, and thanks for the uploader."
,psychokittie,2010-01-04T04:56Z,"It has levels 1 - 3 on the RS website for Farsi. I've tried it all on my computer, and it's all working for me. I haven't had any problems, except that I have to mount the different *.iso's on their own disks. But I have a lot of disks, so I suppose it's worth it. Thanks uploader!!"
,Edict,2010-01-06T00:51Z,"@psychokittie:
A couple quick questions: When you say 'it has' Farsi v3 on the 'RS website', do you mean 'Rosetta Stone' or 'Rapid Search'. If you got it off from the official site, how'd you come by it without paying for it? Or, if you got it off Rapid Search, what were the links you used to get them?

(I've gotten to the point that I'm so frustrated trying to find these, that I'd put out my own torrent if I got my hands on these *.iso's)

Thanks for your time."

appreciated it"
,psychokittie,2010-01-08T20:23Z,"@Edict... I meant the Rosetta Stone site. Sorry for not clarifying on that. I never said I had it, just that if you go to the site, and you go to the Farsi page, it shows all the editions they have. It has those levels I mentioned in my previous post. I had went through as was wondering how much this torrent was really worth and came by it then. 

@DuhChick...

They ask you to activate them, but just click ""Activate Later"" and you will still be able to use the full version. Also, never update this program.

@rea1994
Don't update the program or languages. If you do, you will only be able to do the first 3 lessons."
,finalfx,2010-01-28T22:38Z,Works very well thank you for this compilation. Unfortunately I found a typo. The Latin language file is actually V2 not V3.
,liquiland,2010-01-29T01:23Z,finalfx that's bad news... :/ i'm after latin. anyone has it for v3?
,finalfx,2010-01-29T14:31Z,Yeah I downloaded this one trying to get latin V3. I don't think there is a copy of it anywhere on the trackers right now.

,TGRandini,2010-01-31T12:52Z,"Hey, just a couple things. First of all thank you so much for putting this on Pirate Bay. Second of all, so far I haven't had any problems other than the fact that I can't get past the ""activation"" window when I want to go to Core Lesson 3 of French 1.
Every time I select to go to that section it says I have to activate. 

(Trust me I tried everything before posting this comment)
Please respond soon. 
And thank you again."
,larsoning,2010-02-01T04:22Z,"Wow this is great, thanks a lot.

I had a problem so I thought I'd share my solution in case anyone else has the same problem and it hadn't been addressed yet.

For ""ERROR 2123 There was an error in the application"" you need to go to your C: drive and under options in the top left corner show hidden folders, then apply and OK. Then go into the programData folder and into the Rosetta Stone folder and delete the tracking.db3 file. Restart your computer and you should be good to go."
,larsoning,2010-02-01T04:50Z,"TGRandini: From what I've read, with the cracked application you don't need to activate and still get full access. You just say activate later each time. I don't know this myself but others have said it's no problem so I'm going with that. Hope that helps."

program works.
I mounted the level 1 japanese cd but when it asks me to install the language it says it needs a cd which makes sense since there is no cd in my cd-drive...but why doesn't it search in the virtual drive?it worked with rosetta stone v2,why not with this one?
do I have to burn the isos to a cd?because I don't wanna waste 3 cds for that..."

I checked the first 7 languages. Arabic, Chinese, English UK and English US are really Version 3, but Danish, Dutch and Farsi are old Version 2 packs, they don't work with V3.

What about Thai? Look at the official Rosetta Stone website; there IS NO VERSION 3 OF THAI, it doesn't even exist!

Their seemed to be like 15 extra rar packages for the rosetta stone setup.  They all had the same contents, I think that might have slowed down the download speed, in other words it added to the file\'s size and slowed the download speed quite a bit.  Other than that smooth sailing here.  I will seed.  Thanks again. :)"
,elung_trings,2010-08-25T03:16Z,"Hey there. I've been trying to get RS to work for a while now so I know my way well around the whole process. Last night, I was able to get japanese lvl 1 and 2 installed, they work PERFECT but I tried the lvl 3  and then it started saying:
9121, 9114
There was a minor error. Click OK to continue.

Tried german, lvl 3, same thing.

I've read a vast number of comments, but haven't bumped into anyone with the same issue. So, any ideas?"
,elung_trings,2010-08-25T03:30Z,"Here's more info. After installing JAP 1 & 2, I shut off my computer. Then I immediately turned it back on and tried the JAP 3 to find this error.

My tracking.db3 file situation:
I read that some people were having problems with a blank grey screen after they deleted tracking.db3. In one forum, one genius guy says he renamed the file to now be tracking.db3.old.
I tried exactly that and that is how I got it working, because before doing that, I had a different problem (database is out of date).

So now, I've restarted my computer and I see that a NEW tracking.db3 file has automatically been created alongside my tracking.db3.old file. Maybe I just need to delete the new .db3 that will likely pop up every time I restart my vista, that is whenever I want to install a new .iso
