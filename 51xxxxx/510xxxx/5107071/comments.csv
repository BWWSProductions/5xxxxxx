What about e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ?? :P"
,Verosu,2009-10-04T06:07Z,"In good time my friend. Lately I've had a busy schedule and it's been taking more time to get all the galleries. The next one will probably be E-F or E-G because of the lack of models for each letter. I'd rather upload a larger one as opposed to a 20-30mb pack.

You're patients will pay off though!"
,hancelove,2009-10-08T21:22Z,You just take your time Playa! Much Love!!!
,Verosu,2009-10-09T23:20Z,"Haha, thanks! I did manage to get the next batch up and I'm slowly working on another. As well as any updates that come out for the previous ones. I haven't decided if I'm going to wait and release some update packs after I get all the galleries done first or just upload them as they get big enough."
