,RockyMM,2011-02-14T13:44Z,"There is no good crack for Amazing Slow Downer. Since version 2.2.0 or somewhere around that the author added 2 security checks. One obvious to hackers and another deep inside the code. No cracker ever thoroughly tested his crack, playing song 100%, so everybody keeps getting that ""redo the complete unlocking instructions"".

I do believe that some old old version did not have that double checking, but I'm not sure."
