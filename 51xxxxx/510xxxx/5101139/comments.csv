GET WITH THE FUCKIN TIMES..............

( i know you prob didnt rip this kerouac, just my beef...shit makes no sense!)"
,minhdo,2009-09-28T15:12Z,thank so much for this cool film and many your other upload !
,luther_b,2009-09-30T10:33Z,"Metalcore, I have seen you banned from other places. No need to act like an idiot here. 

FYI, the proper reply would be ""thanks for the up, Kerouac. I'd prefer a 1-file rip"". But you'd have to grow up to be able to produce this, wouldn't you ?"
[T],pastafari,2009-10-03T14:25Z,Excellent movie! Muchas gracias!
,puppyup,2010-10-30T23:21Z,Good flick. Thank you. This one is the original cut.
