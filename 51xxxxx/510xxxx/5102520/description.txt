This book compares the two computer algebra programs, Maple and Mathematica used by students, mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

Structured by presenting both systems in parallel, Mathematicaâ€™s users can learn Maple quickly by finding the Maple equivalent to Mathematica functions, and vice versa.

This student reference handbook consists of core material for incorporating Maple and Mathematica as a working tool into different undergraduate mathematical courses (algebra, geometry, calculus, complex functions, special functions, integral transforms, mathematical equations).

Part I describes the foundations of Maple and Mathematica (with equivalent problems and solutions). Part II describes Mathematics with Maple and Mathematica by using equivalent problems.
