[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-25T21:19Z,"Yea but it's all relative. In general, they get treated like shit by SXM (and I know they've been assholes themselves) and that's what they are upset about I think. 

It's like listeners who make 35,000 a year can't understand when Ant bitches about half his money going to taxes -  but it will eventually hit everyone at some point. He's basically right, rich asshole or not - taxes and government ARE out of control. It's not even a left / right thing that most (including him) make it out to be. 

I'd love to see Ant publicly move away from the right-wing neo-con Fox ""conservative"" towards a more freedom oriented, socially liberal (which he is), anti-pointless war w/ strong defense (which he supports), anti-over taxing (which he is) classical libertarian. Whether he'll admit it or not - he aligns more with that than with the Fox crowd. 

However, there isn't a Libertarian network giving him face-time so I guess ""Fox"" it is."

[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-27T18:46Z,"It came from an O&A wallpaper, I modified it a bit (quickly and sloppily actually) and added the ""Worst of"". If you search Google Images (large size pictures) you'll find it. You may need to dig a few pages in though......"
