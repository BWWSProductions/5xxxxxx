Review

The new masterpiece from X-FUSION! With "Ultima Ratio" they demonstrate their premier position in the harsh electro Scene. In his own extraordinary way Jan L. combines at the highest level various styles of electronic music to achieve a complex unity. Intelligent samples, catchy melodies and hard beats blend with a sinister soundscape. The result is the best X-FUSION album of all-time. Includes the club-smashes "Leave No Seed", "Follow Your Leader", "Daily Dose", "House of Mirrors" and "Exspes".

This limited 2CD digipak edition contains the bonus disc "Beyond Reality (The Orchestral Works)".
