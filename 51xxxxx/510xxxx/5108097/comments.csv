,anighean,2009-10-03T12:07Z,"Great, but I cant connect to any tracker, had this problem for some time. I just cant connect to the most popular torrents. Is this a common problem or am I alone in this? "
,MrsA,2009-10-03T13:14Z,"anighean: I have the same problem, but only with eztvÂ´s torrents. Really sad!"
,anighean,2009-10-03T14:58Z,MrsA- Thats exactly my problem and his uploads used to be the absolute best. I'm wondering if it could be Vuze that is the problem but why would it only be with EZTV uploads???? :)
