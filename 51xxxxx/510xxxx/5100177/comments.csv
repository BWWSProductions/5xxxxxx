,08millerj,2009-09-27T06:08Z,what kind of xm radio do you use for the ups?

[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-27T19:02Z,"There are only 2 XM radios with the means for 100% digital recording - and both have the same chipset and will yield the same exact quality results. Both are also discontinued. One is the Polk XM home receiver, the other is the ""XMPCR"". Additionally, the XMPCR needs an added $30 board (requiring minor soldering) to get the optical digital output. 

Those are your hardware options (to keep it digital anyway). With a reliable internet connection, you could do a stream rip of the XM202 online feed and get excellent results as well - and it's probably a more realistic, cost-effective solution. The key to quality in this case is ripping the stream data, not just ""recording"" the analog sound. 

Before I stop the early ups, I'll post a torrent with software and how-to's so anyone with the means can do their own rips. "
,08millerj,2009-09-27T19:22Z,are any of these good for recording an xm stream? http://all-streaming-media.com/record-audio-stream/all-streaming-audio-recording-software.htm
,08millerj,2009-09-27T19:24Z,would someone consider this for recording a stream? http://all-streaming-media.com/record-video-stream/Replay-AV-capture-Streaming-Video-Audio-Radio-Shows-Online-TV-Broadcasts-Video-Clips-Audio-Archives-Podcasts-Free-to-try.htm
[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-28T05:08Z,"I use Replay AV to do my optical digital rips, I know it does stream ripping too but have not tried it. Not sure currently what format XM is streaming in (might be wma) but as long as it can rip it you're good to go. Of course, I think XM is getting like $10-13 a month for the HQ stream subscription alone these days. 

BTW, I'm not at all opposed to paying for software but it is here on tpb if you look for it......

Anything that stream rips will work (assuming it rips the right formats). For the highest quality, 
you may want to avoid the built-in converting options (depends on the program obviously) and convert after it's been ripped. You may have to go wma to wav (no quality loss there) and then wav to mp3 as some encoders aren't going to do wma to mp3 directly. "
