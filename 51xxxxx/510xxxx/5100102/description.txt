Starchild Skull & Open Lines

Guests: Lloyd Pye, Open Lines

In the first half of the show, researcher Lloyd Pye presented a short history and an update on the mysterious Starchild Skull. Pye said a young girl stumbled upon the skull in a Mexican mine tunnel around 1930. She brought the weird artifact back to the United States as a souvenir, and kept it until her death in the late 1990s, he continued. The skull then passed to its current owners, Ray and Melanie Young, who immediately realized that it did not belong to a human child, Pye explained.

According to Pye, every piece of (physical and anatomical) evidence he has collected indicates that the 900-year-old relic is not from a human. He believes the skull likely belonged to a human-alien hybrid, and hopes to prove his hypothesis with DNA analysis. Pye said recent advancements in DNA testing along with falling costs (around $250,000) mean he may soon know for certain if the enigmatic skull has alien origins.

But now that a definitive conclusion seems within reach, "things are beginning to work against me," Pye admitted. A deal with the BBC to film a documentary on the Starchild Skull as it undergoes DNA testing has fallen though. In addition, a favorable story set to run in The Daily Mail this past June was pulled, he noted. Pye suggested listeners check out his new Starchild eBook for more info on the topic. He also chatted briefly about human origins, ancient civilizations, and the work of Zecharia Sitchin.

Open Lines

During Open Lines, Henry in Salt Lake City recalled when he was 13-years-old and taken ill with a severe week-long stomach ache. Henry said one night he fell asleep and dreamed of a brightly lit amusement park, where he spent time with a mysterious woman. At the end of the day, the woman asked him if wanted to stay there with her -- forever. Henry told her that he needed to go home, and the woman smiled and said she'd be waiting for him. At this point, he remembered being awakened by his mother and taken to the hospital. Fortunate for young Henry, as his doctor said he would have died of appendicitis had he remained asleep.

Tim in Dayton, Ohio phone in to the "somebody did something special for me" line. Tim said he'd been diagnosed with thyroid cancer when he was 18-years-old and had elected surgery to remove it. While recovering in the hospital, a good friend visited and gave Tim a rare vinyl recording by American punk band Screeching Weasel that he'd be looking for but unable to find.

Another caller to the special topic line, Marianna in Kansas told George how she had been bullied by her classmates in the sixth grade. One teacher who saw how the other kids treated her allowed Marianna into her classroom during recess, she explained. In that classroom Marianna started drawing, encouraged by the teacher's interest in her work. According to Marianna, she went on to become a professional artist.

The final half-hour featured part of George's January 16, 2008 interview with astronomy writer James Mullaney, who discussed his book Edgar Cayce and the Cosmos.
