One Million Strong - Various [1998]
	

Originally released on the Sound of Los Angeles record label in early 1995, just before 2Pac became a genuine superstar, One Million Strong is a solid collection of gangsta rap from a diverse selection of artists. 2Pac takes center stage with the title track, but Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre and the Wu-Tang Clan also make appearences -- just a few short months later, such team-ups would only seem possible in a fantasy world. It's a little brief and a couple cuts fall flat, but One Million Strong remains a good snapshot of the state of gangsta rap circa 1995. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
