  From Recorded Books:

A Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Ron Suskind has scored numerous New York Times best-sellers with his probing investigative journalism. Here he blows the lid off another hot-button political issue â€” nuclear proliferation. Taking on this complex and convoluted problem, Suskind details the major players and the terrifying consequences of failure if action is not taken soon.
