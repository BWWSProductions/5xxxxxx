Romance Of The Three Kingdoms XI - PC

REQUIRES DIRECT X 9 - Included

This is the exact same version made for PlayStation 2, but it is a PC Install. DVD can be burned or image file can be run with an application like Alcohol 120 or Nero Imagedrive ( Imagedrive is included in Nero instalations ).

This is a great war-strategy game, many tactics involved and very unique caracters. Cool unit animations, sounds, scenarios, and grafics. Game runs light and does not soak up too many resources. The user interface includes ALL of the Playstation 2 control buttons, and is actually easier to play than on playstation. Looks much better on PC than on regular TV.

I recommend this game if you like strategy games or if you follow the ROTTK saga

UPDATE OCT 27, 2009

I recently noticed this version has added functions and commands, like the "Auto Unit Action" command, and the ability to negotiate reinforcements with rulers, i dont remember seeing these commands in the PS2 version, lots of small details that are different too.
