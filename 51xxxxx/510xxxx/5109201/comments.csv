I have one little favour for ask you, do you have any more video about how to learn dancing ballroom dances or do you have any more music and can you write in description like you did in ""Latin Jam 7"" torrents description, where you had written which dance can be danced on that song....

I will be very pleased if you can do that for me...
and let me just one more time repeat - GOOD WORK, GOOD TORRENTS, I just love them!"

This one was my very fisrt torrent I uploaded.   With time it gets better.    I do have a lot more videos and music, but  I need time to upload them. Thank you for the suggestion. "

I just got into torrents and registered myself just to comment on on of your uploads.
Long time I've been looking for all kinds of dance music and video's. I just found all the uploads you done and..well..I am currently downloading and uploading them all.
Many thanks from me and if there's any more uploads I'll definitly check them out!

Kind regards,
Louis Hogenhout"
