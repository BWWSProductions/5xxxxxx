Now That I've Found You (A Collection) - Alison Krauss [1995]



Now That I've Found You: A Collection, is an album by Alison Krauss, released February 7, 1995. It is a retrospective of the early part of Krauss' recording career. It includes songs that appeared on her solo albums, albums by Alison Krauss & Union Station, and some that appeared on an album by Alison Krauss & the Cox Family. It also contains some new material.

The album features the hit country single "When You Say Nothing at All", sold over two million copies earning double platinum RIAA certification, and is often regarded as the album that launched Alison Krauss' career. The title single "Baby, Now That I've Found You" won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and "When You Say Nothing at All" was named the Single of the Year by the Country Music Association.

Other highlights include a radiant version of the Beatles' "I Will," recorded with banjo man Tony Furtado; the gospelish "When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart," recorded with the Cox Family; and two previously unreleased gems, a lovely, lilting take on the Foundations' infectious Top 20 hit from 1968, "Baby, Now That I've Found You," and a bluesy interpretation of Bad Company's "Oh Atlanta." Risky stuff but beautifully done.
