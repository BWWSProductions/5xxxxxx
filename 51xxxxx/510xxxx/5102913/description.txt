DU Meter
Version 3.05 Build 148
for Windows

DU Meter graphs bandwidth usage and bytes transferred.

It produces an easy to read graph of current IN/OUT
usage, and keeps transfer totals. You can also set it to
notify you when you have reached a certain amount. This
is useful if you have a metered connection, and you don't
want to go past your limit.

This older version still works as well as the newer ones,
but doesn't require complicated cracks and doesn't phone
home. It does not include all the bells and whistles of the
newer versions (4.0+).
