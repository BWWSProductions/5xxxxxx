,homieonekanobie,2009-10-05T00:43Z,I know of this trial reseter and it work fine. I downloaded Kaspersky Antivirus 2010 straight from the website and reset the trial another 30 days. I had to do it manually but it stilled worked. Great up load thegrimreaper123.
,MobiusVortex,2009-10-10T02:19Z,is there a way to enable to delete/disinfect options?  they seem to be disabled for the trial version
,MobiusVortex,2009-10-10T21:43Z,and the trial notices keep popping up like 10x/day.  crazy annoying
,soulp0wer,2009-10-11T08:08Z,"scanned the file Resetter.exe containing 
Trojan.MSIL.Rettesser.b"
,soulp0wer,2009-10-11T08:30Z,"do anyone have the REGISTRY FILE for trial reset for Kaspersky 2010?

that method is safer compared to .EXE applications.
