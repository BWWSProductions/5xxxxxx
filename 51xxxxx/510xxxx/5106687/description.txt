In this Slamdance Film Festival Audience Award winner, things go downhill fast when a mild-mannered office drone (Chris Sharp) plucks a Halloween party invitation off the street and suddenly finds himself the main event at an art student-hosted "murder party." But the students turn out to be more of a danger to themselves than to their intended victims in this horror comedy that explodes in riotous violence set to a fierce punk-metal soundtrack.
