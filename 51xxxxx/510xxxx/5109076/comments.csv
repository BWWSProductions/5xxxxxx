,doalwa,2009-10-05T00:54Z,"Am I the only one who can't download any Conan torrents anymore from the Pirate Bay? I'm using rtorrent and Transmission, both clients reach a timeout while trying to connect to eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org .
I can however download other torrents from the pirate bay without any problems.
Anybody else having the same problem? It started for me about 4 or 5 weeks ago..damn, I need my Conan fix :-("
