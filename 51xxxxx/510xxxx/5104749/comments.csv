,woodrowwilsonsmith,2009-09-30T01:19Z,episode 2 just aired last night. How are you getting episodes 6 days before broadcast? Or is this mislabeled?
[V],Morck22,2009-09-30T02:14Z,"yes is second episode, the first episode is a double episode."
,goodluck4287,2009-09-30T09:03Z,"That's probably going to confuse a lot of people because the first (double) episode was uninterrupted.

Meh.

Thanks for sharing."
,Talonade,2009-09-30T23:20Z,"For the record, episodes 1 and 2 were aired in a double header, uninterrupted (its so good im sure people didnt ntice it lasted length of a feature film), so what was aired on monday night in the States is EPISODE 3."
,Ind0,2009-10-02T02:26Z,"Correction, S06E01 was an extended episode, called Broken. Check out the wiki pages and even FOX episode guide. S06E02 is Epic Fail."
,huntermckiller,2009-10-03T22:36Z,"it's hardly an ""epic"" fail. Most torrents listed the ""first"" episode as ""S6E1&2"" or similar."
,Schwein,2009-10-04T19:47Z,The name of the episode is Epic fail. :)
,huntermckiller,2009-10-04T21:36Z,oh lol.
