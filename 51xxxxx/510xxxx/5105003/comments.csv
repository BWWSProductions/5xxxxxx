Thank you so much for your swift post, i believe this is the best psychedelic album of the 80's, will seed it till the end of time."

,bikk3,2009-10-04T03:39Z,80zforever I appreciate all your hard work uploading great and obscure 80s music.  I especially have to thank you for the Scars LP.  Might you have a rare 45 from the Australian band Bastanados?
