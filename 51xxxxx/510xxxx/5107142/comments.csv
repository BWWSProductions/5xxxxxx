,Arienette,2009-10-19T06:08Z,"Hey, I've been trying to download this torrent all week, but for whatever reason none of the torrents on TPB are working for me, internet explorer will just stop working after I click ""Download this torrent""... I know this is not the uploaders fault or anything, but this is very frusterating, I have been able to download torrents many many times before, but for some reason it's deciding not to work and I don't understand why. I've tried everything I can think of (all obvious reasons) and it just won't work. If someone could help me, I would really appreciate it... I'm a HUGE supernatural fan, and I really wanna watch this episode... thanks :)"
,GramKrakka,2010-01-05T17:20Z,Perhaps because U R using internet explorer. Firefox is generally more reliable with this kind of thing
