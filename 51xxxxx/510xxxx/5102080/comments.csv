i had a few probs with the keygen but 20mins of playing around finally solved it.
if anyones having problems with the patch, just run the keygen as administrator then close registry winner before clicking patch, it should then say its patched and when i opened RW it was registered until 2019, didnt have to enter a serial. it also updates, just run the patch again after updating to the latest release."
