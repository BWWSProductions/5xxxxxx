,PerfectH,2009-10-26T23:18Z,"Wow this is great! I originally purchased this software from Corel few years ago, but now they won't let me redownload it because they only allow you 2 years to redownload it. Bastards.

Thanks for the upload!"
,milsorgen,2009-10-27T21:26Z,"I've downloaded this torrent a couple times works great. If you try and use it in Vista it will disable aero while it is running. Which is a step up from v8 which would randomly crash, checking online for a solution would download an .ocx and 8 would run pretty good after that. I'm not sure how 9 runs on 7 though I'm sure there is going to be a similar problem with Aero, that's why I'm going to install it in the XP Compatibility mode and hope for the best. If v9 doesn't run I'm making the switch to Adobe as the corel editions of PSP are trash in my opinion."
