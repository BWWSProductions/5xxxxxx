Product Description
Develop strength, power, coordination, balance, and core stability using the medicine ball and stability ball exercises included in Strength Ball Training. Preferred by elite athletes, fitness experts, and strength and conditioning specialists, these exercises train the body as a linked system rather than targeting muscles in isolation.

Exercises start with the core, where most movements are initiated, and then move out to the periphery, combining strength and balance in all the major muscle groups and the supporting muscles. And the enclosed companion DVD shows you how to perform the most complex and advanced exercises.

Strength Ball Training also includes a sample 16-week program with an excellent array of strength, flexibility, and balance challenges that may also be customized to design your own strength ball program.
