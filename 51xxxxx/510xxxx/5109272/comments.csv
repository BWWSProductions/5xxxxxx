According to my installed version of KGB (there is a portable version that is in the download, I don't know if it works or not though) the uncompressed files which is currently sitting in a .kgb archive is a 2.2 GB ISO. When it is uncompressed, I will check the file out using some precautions and if I think to later I will report back."
