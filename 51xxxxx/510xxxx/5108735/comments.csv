,dusna,2009-10-11T13:24Z,"Hi guys,

what about resolution?
I saw it at theatre and I think that image there was bigger. I think that HD rip image is cut off on top and bottom. You can see it at the beginning of the movie when logo of star trek is shown and in all movie you can see that actores have their heads cut off a little. You can't see it all. I don't think directro wanted to do that so what is the reason?
