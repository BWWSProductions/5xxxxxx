,ciscoman,2009-10-02T18:14Z,"this uploader was banned from mininova coz every R5 that came out, they renamed a proper dvd rip and tried to pass off as that.
it's an R5 and they should state that!!!
they only got a green skull coz of that fact...i know what an R5 is so stfu!"
[T],DUQA-TEAM,2009-10-02T18:42Z,"@ ciscoman

DUQA never been banned from mininova
DUQA removed the torrent by himself and   also axxo at the same time but DUQA never will come back mininova because they are now using axxo account but it is not the real axxo. 

all axxo account are fake because it was  made from the  mininova.

End of story.
if you like it or not it is DVDRIP"

,badlands,2009-10-11T12:11Z,"And once again, all the little TPB-fairies come out and bitchslap each other over if it's a real dvdrip or not, whether the audio is 7 or 8 et cetera et cetera. Why don't all of you prom queens open a separate debate for all your pathetic arguements? For the ordinary viewer, this torrent is of good quality both audio and video. Let's focus on that instead."
