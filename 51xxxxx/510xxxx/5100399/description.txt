/ JAMES HOLDEN DJ MIXES COLLECTION (2003-2009)

+ NOTES

Here's a collection of all the James Holden DJ mixes I was able to gather over the years. I'm sure there have been more recorded and shared since 2003, but I don't think it's possible to find all of them anymore and this collection is fairly extensive as it is. There are 25 sets in total, spread over 35 .MP3 files.

Quality varies. Most sets sound nice and clear with the majority having a bitrate between 128kbps and 192kbps. I am a bit of an audiophile myself, so while there are some sets that sound worse than others, I only kept them because there was no better copy available. In all instances, I tried to get the best recording possible.

This collection DOES NOT include any commercial releases (i.e. Balance 005). Only live sets and radio recordings. Two DJ sets are included that co-feature James Holden with (1) Nathan Fake (Essential Mix) and (2) Petter.

Tracklists for all sets are included in the LYRICS metatag of the .MP3 files (hint: foo_lyricsdb plugin). As ThePirateBay doesn't allow .txt/.rar files in the Audio>Music upload category, I have made available all the tracklists in .txt files, contained in a single .rar archive at a direct download link, but I cannot paste it in this description, so check the first couple comments instead.

ReplayGain has also been calculated and applied directly to all .MP3 files in order to normalize volume levels across all files.

Thanks to evil from The B-Log (www.b-log.se) and TranceAddict.com forum members for many of these mixes and tracklists.

Enjoy!
