It's absolutely Ok without crack. But game needs the disk in that way..."
,Diepen,2009-12-06T06:05Z,"@Shiitman (or anyone else)

Can you confirm that the saving of games is possible / working

Thanks
JD"
,SecretDJ,2009-12-15T13:32Z,"For some reason when I click install it tries to start my scanner (which is not plugged in).
Any known printer/scanner software bugs?"
,conchalex,2010-01-28T20:10Z,"I'm getting the same f***ing error message every other torrent for Civ IV gives about binkw32.dll.

Anyone knows how to fix this? I've tried downloading other versions of the .dll but none of them work =("
,lugarthecougar,2010-01-29T22:41Z,"It's not the dll, it's the cracks. Some of them don't work so you have to get new ones"
,Gavra87,2010-03-02T01:16Z,Please seed!
,Ziaix,2010-03-05T13:53Z,"Awesome. Files I can actually use, not just a big mess. Thanks!"
,sleepingclockaround,2010-03-12T17:35Z,"Please help. I realize I'm probably making a simple mistake- but everytime I try to open either one of the expansions it tells me to put in the CD, even if it's mounted with Daemon tools or if I actually burned and have it in the drive. What am I doing wrong? any help would be greatly appreciated."
,tammot,2010-07-12T00:42Z,new to torrents. this download has 2 cracks for sword exp.witch one do i use or do i use both?
,hasbeenhonshu,2010-09-27T07:05Z,"I just got done downloading this torrent and decided I'd better burn just one game first to see if it worked. I had the same problem as conchalex when I tried to start civilization IV using the crack provided - ""The procedure entry point_BinkShouldSkip@4 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll.""

So I guess there must be another crack on the planet that does work for the civilization 4 game?"
,hasbeenhonshu,2010-10-04T06:32Z,"Thank you fireblade80, I finally got to see if these games would work on my machine; tired of wasting dollars on stuff that doesn't work on my third world laptop.

Tried installing Civ IV with a DVD burned with Nero and it wouldn't work; don;t remember the error. I installed a Civ IV from Demonoid instead. That worked so I came back and mounted/installed Warlords and Beyond the Sword with Daemon Tools and then installed the BTS 3.19 patch. Warlords and CivIV worked but BTS didn't. Removed BTS and reinstalled per fireblade80's BTS iso and used the 3.17 patch and everything works great.

Wish I knew what I was doing with the CD/DVD utilities...

Thanks again, and I'm seeding."
,dopeydave420,2010-11-06T23:04Z,"u guys just might need the bink video player installed , maybe the custom install didnt install it correctly im prety sure theres external installers for it try googlein bink video player, its a vid encoder thats ive see naround since starcraft1"

,Dysto,2011-03-04T02:07Z,"Alright, so the cracks don't work, where can I get ones that do with this already installed?"
,oxyzero,2011-04-18T20:54Z,"nice upload dude,and thanks for the detailed instructions"
,Rasmus95,2011-04-30T00:50Z,"I got the Binkw32.dll error to. i downloaded the missing .dll file, but it doesn't seem like its working. this is the 3rd civilization IV torrent I've downloaded, and none of them work like they should. what do can I do? is it something wrong with my computer, or is there an error on the files this (and the other) torrents contain?"
,theaussiebattler,2011-08-02T09:27Z,beautiful download all works prefectly if u follow directions!
,Lm602,2011-08-07T20:41Z,Thank you for not including civilization! Its gay..
,MirroredCeiling,2011-08-24T21:42Z,"Followed instructions using the included Daemon tools.  I installed everything and copied the cracks as described.  The only game of the three that I can play is Civ4.  Warlords and BTS do not play.  I mount their images into Daemon, then try to run the games and it tells me ""Please insert the correct CDROM, select OK, and restart the application.  What am I missing?  I followed the steps exactly.  Some help please?"
,kathykat63,2011-09-28T01:55Z,"The program is running flawlessly and updated.  I am no pro, but if it helps anyone, copy the ^instructions^ and save to desktop.  Follow each step.  Mount the ISO and run the setup file.  The program detected and updated each install, then close and install the next.  Copy/paste the crack files.  If you do not get a prompt to copy and replace, the file may not be in the right place.  I had to look around for one of them.  If the program does not run correctly, I would try uninstalling and start over.  May be easier than figuring out what is causing a problem. 

Thanks fireblade80!  Seeding. [: "
,wallaceqe001,2012-01-31T17:30Z,can someone (ANYONE) please seed so i can finsh downloading this?? it would be much appreciated !!
,Lyca77,2012-02-12T00:04Z,"Someone please explain to me why ANYONE is seeding this!?? Everyone gets an  binkw32.dll error.

JUNK TORRENT, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
,tushkano,2012-04-29T17:53Z,"You need to patch the base game up to 1.74 to avoid the binkw32.dll error. This error occurs because the crack included into the release is 1.74, but the game is not. Download the official 1.74 patch and install it."
,tushkano,2012-04-30T12:18Z,"Important note: Installing the addons (Warlords and BTS) will automatically patch your game up to the version the crack is. So, this error may occur only on uncomplete installations. For example: you install the base game only, but not the addons. If so, download and install the 1.74 patch before you play."
,Acardium,2012-05-20T14:11Z,"After install game (basic civ IV) you need to update game to ver. 1,74 ( http://civilization4.filefront.com/file/Civilization_IV_v174_Patch;81215 ), and then copy crack file over the original file (""Civilization4.exe"" )"
