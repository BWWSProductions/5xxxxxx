,eveningztar,2009-11-21T20:25Z,"We are a lot of ppl just waiting for someone to seed,check out the big list of ppl stopped at 63%. PLEASE seed. I promise to return the favoure for the next days,if anyone who sees this actually give us the seeding to finnish the dl. I really want this torrent. Please."
,eveningztar,2009-11-21T20:29Z,"You cant seriously mean that this torrent was active for a week,and that was it? Then you should remove it instead of leading people on to belive that this is a actuall torrent!!! If it appears on the searches it should be active. Please seed it again and i will try to seed it at least for a couple of more weeks,and then after that every now and then if i see a load of ppl like now just waiting for a dl."
,Rappoz,2010-04-12T11:02Z,"I've got about 100 peers all stuck on 66,7% 
( i got to 66,8% by adding a list of 100 extra tracers... so everyone is knoking on my door for that 0,1%)
It is just not out there, and what's worse, non of the 10 rars are complete.

Could someone (maybe blacktroy) please seed this for a while?"
,Rappoz,2010-04-12T11:06Z,"oh, i am mistaken. the tree-storm rar is complete.

So if this is the only plugin you need, the torrent is fine"
,Aca48,2010-05-28T15:29Z,Seed pls.
,iClient,2010-11-07T06:02Z,"I am dead stuck at 66.8, this is a great torrent and promise to seed x2 on original file size but please isolate this torrent and seed this or tell me why me and another person are stuck at 66.8."
,imunionjack,2010-12-21T11:48Z,Please either re seed or delete. I have 3 others I am TRYING to dl at the moment all stuck at differenrt levels. 1 has 65 like me all stuck at 98.6% all by 'VIPs' Why not just keep seeding??? Im still seeding some I up'd 3 years ago because I think peeps should like them.
