Andrew Bacevich is that rare breed in American political discourse: a principled conservative who stands out in stark contrast to themonstrosity and demonstrably incoherent, unprincipled ideology that is American conservatism, sometimes labelled libertarianism[/url], of the Reagan revolution and Republican party variety, which is mostly a racist, "God Bless America and kill the darkies abroad!!" screeching, anti-government, anti-tax, corporate-and-private-power-worshipping philosophy.  It is an ideology that hypocritically preaches incessantly about "limited government" [url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/09/14/resentment/index.html]but which is anti-government and anti-state only when it comes to social programs for the poor, the weak, the powerless and minorities[/url], and whose criticisms of expansive government, coercive state-power, and executive and federal power overreach are notably absent when it comes to the expansion of the domestic police state and of [url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/09/03/afghanistan/]the grotesque, weapons-of-mass-destruction-producing and mass-murdering apparatus that is the expansive American military establishment, American imperial power-structure and the National Security State[/url].

It is quite revealing to see a principled conservative like Andrew Bacevich arriving to very similar conclusions about American power, imperialism and foreign policy as someone from the left, such as Noam Chomsky.
