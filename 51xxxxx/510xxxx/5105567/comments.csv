Looking forward to listening to many of these bands for the first time...keep those other torrents coming..I for one can't wait for the next instalment ! Cheers."

,haakjay,2010-01-07T22:46Z,"This is just a great collection. Normally when I download music I have to retag whole torrents when I put it on my mp3 player, because people just can't seem to get it right. Tagging is very important. Thank you for doing all this work for us."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-08T21:36Z,"@haakjay: Yes mate, I think it is very important to tag them properly, that's what I'm trying to do now with every single mp3 I put on here.  I'm still having a slight problem though and that's with the cover art or cover flow you know like you get on the ipod touch say.  The problem is that when I tag an album I always put the front album cover so it will show up like you want on the ipod touch say but I have a Cowon S9 mp3 player and it seems to have a problem displaying some of the pictures sometimes because I think they're slightly too large or something.  I find that usually they're ok but the odd few won't display and just show up with a black empty box instead.  Maybe I'm doing them too large when I tag them, it's just one slight problem I had really.  Apart from that they're all ok."
,Meafer,2010-01-20T22:06Z,this shit fucking sucks. stay far away from it if you know what's good for you.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-17T20:36Z,"^ Ignore that last chump, he has a stick up his ass and I had dealings before with his cocky know it all attitude.  The guy is a prick, he talks crap for fun, take no notice this torrent is lovely :-P"
,subversivelemming,2010-05-20T16:59Z,"SpandauBaby, I must give you the greatest of thanks for my repeated appreciation of every single Prog/Kraut... collections youve composed.
I have found things that I almost had given up hope finding over the years of looking n seen other things tht I listen to regularly. You are indeed a welcomed kindred spirit in your appreciation of music n kindly sharing it all with us.
This is absolutely awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
