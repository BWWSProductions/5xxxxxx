When asked about the song in an interview with Courtney Love for Spin in October, 1997, Nicks said:

â€œ You know what, Courtney? I don't really know what â€˜Gold Dust Womanâ€™ is about. I know there was cocaine there and that I fancied it gold dust, somehow. I'm going to have to go back to my journals and see if I can pull something out about â€˜Gold Dust Woman.â€™ Because I don't really know. It's weird that I'm not quite sure. It can't be all about cocaine. 


A cover version by Hole was released on the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels and was produced by former Cars leader Ric Ocasek.
