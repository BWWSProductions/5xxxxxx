Galactus! He's devoured worlds since the dawn of the Universe. Consuming the Korbinites' home was nothing special. But for Beta Ray Bill - oathbrother to Thor and the Korbinites' defender - it was a failure of his life's duty... and has given him a certain clarity. How can a hero suffer such a threat to exist? Beta Ray Bill sets forth to hunt down Galactus, force him to his knees, and make him pay - with a plan so audacious even the Planet Eater will feel fear!
