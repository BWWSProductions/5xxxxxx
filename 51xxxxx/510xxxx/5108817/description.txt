Symphony Orchestra / Yevgeny Svetlanov

Magic Dances ("Ruslan and Ludmila", Act III) - Bolshoi Theater Orchestra / Yuri Simonov


Having once searched without success for a CD reissue of Svetlanov's anthology of Glinka's orchestral music (from about the mid-to-late 1960s would be my guess), I wouldn't be surprised to discover that either it never made it to the CD format - or else it's unavailable for some time.

But, here it is (without additional equalization) - paired with a wonderful set of dances from Act III of Glinka's "Ruslan and Ludmila" conducted by Yuri Simonov (from the equally wonderful recording of the complete opera).

LP transfer of material issued c. late 1960s (Melodiya-Angel); digital material recorded 1979 (Melodiya).

Includes original covers and notes.
