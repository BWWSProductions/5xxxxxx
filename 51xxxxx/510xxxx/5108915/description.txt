Pneumonia is an album by the alternative country band Whiskeytown, released in 2001.[1]

The album is noted for its troubled history which saw the band lose its record deal in the midst of the merger between Polygram and Universal,[2][3] and the already volatile band fell apart as a result. The album sat on the shelf for nearly two years and it was said that over 100 songs were recorded during the 3 years [4] , was bootlegged heavily and gained a reputation as a great "lost" record from fans, before getting released by Lost Highway Records as something of an appetizer for Ryan Adams' 2001 album Gold.
