,scrabulot,2010-02-03T19:49Z,"Ignore me, I figured it out... Didn't notice the drop-down option :-)"
,blackwidowfarms,2010-04-28T22:14Z,"glad you found that drop-down menu. ok for anyone that cannot find your MP3 export options.... go to ""file / export audio"" as usual. Then look under your file name in the export audio box, it should show you different formats you can export in (WAV, MP3 etc...).
 do NOT choose ""mp3"" as that's the expired built-in encoder, look at the BOTTOM of the drop down menu and you will see your chosen bitrates in this format:

MP3 ___ kbps 
MP# ___ kbps

etc...

sorry, I should have pointed this out. if you have any questions or concerns I am at

thanks, and I'm glad you find this useful.

,aaronbewza,2011-04-17T00:24Z,"This is to follow up an obviously old post...

Aaron's Sonar Patch v5.2 is now complete, it features ALL available bitrate options (CBR and VBR), a fully-functional interface and the ability to add tags to your Mp3s. Two encoder engines are incuded (32 and 64-bit), and the appropriate one is used based on if your system is 32 or 64-bit.

This is the solution for us who would like to export Mp3 from Sonar longer than the one-month allowed period.

Works with Sonar X1, and all previous versions.
I will post it in a few days.
