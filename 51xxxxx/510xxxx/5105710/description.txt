Aaron's Sonar MP3 Encoder Patch V2 (32 and 64-bit)

    This program will allow you to add entries in Sonar's
    "Export Audio" menu, for instant MP3 export without
     having to configure anything ever again. All of the
     usual MP3 bitrates are included and available,
     from 32 kbps to 320 kbps (16-bit stereo, 44.1 khz).

    A shortcut named "Sonar MP3 Encoder Patch 32-bit" will
     be made on your desktop. Inside are the registry entries
     you can choose from.

 HOW TO USE:

   -You will need to use the registry entries to add
     MP3 encoding options to Sonar's "Export Audio" menu.

   -The entries are all labelled by bitrate, add them by
     double-clicking on them. Choose from some, or all of them.

   The new bitrates will instantly show up on Sonar's
    "Export Audio" menu, where you choose the type of
     file you want to export.

 TO UNINSTALL:
 
    Use the included uninstaller.
    Any registry entries you have made will also be safely deleted.
