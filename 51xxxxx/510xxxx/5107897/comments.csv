Generally, it looks like a rather decent DVD quality record, but there's a noticeable picture noise, as if the movie was recorded on an ancient tape. I didn't see a similar effect on a DVDRip or the TV broadcast, so I suppose it's a matter of encoding here. Note that although the movie is encoded in 720x480 aspect ratio, there are black bars on top and bottom, so the actual viable picture dimensions are 720x350. Nonetheless, it's the best copy I've been able to find that's still available, so I'm quite happy. Thanks for the upload!"
