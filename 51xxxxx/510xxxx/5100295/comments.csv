This is the original disc released by Sierra with nothing modified. It even contains the Pharaoh demo that the original disc contained. The only extra stuff on it is the crack folder with the cracked application which you must copy-paste over the original one to break DRM-lock and play it without the original CD.

Please comment after checking it out. Everybody new downloader checks comments first to ensure the stuff is working. 

And last but not least... PLZ SEED AT LEAST FOR A WEEK AFTER DOWNLOADING"

,jay510,2009-11-01T00:17Z,"just a note:

Crack doesnt work on vista."
,bard777,2009-11-23T22:05Z,I use XP + 7 dual boot. No Vista shit. and I've played it only on XP. So can't verify that.
,warofdead,2010-02-06T20:32Z,Thanks but it unfortunately doesn't work on XP for me... it says the application couldn't be initialised correctly when I use the crack. Any idea?
,bard777,2010-03-04T21:29Z,"@warofdead, first verify the md5 digest if it matches with the file you downloaded. If it does, then try uninstalling and reinstalling it while temporarily shutting down any anti virus. That's a very generic answer I know, can't help much. Maybe try on another puter to see if it works."
,Dark_Fields,2011-10-27T16:17Z,"i know you probably cant do this but is there any way to install the enhancement update pack?

iv got the right update for it but i need a registered copy of Zeus, so i downloaded this torrent, which I cant seem to register. any ideas?"
