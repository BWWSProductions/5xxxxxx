A reality-bending fantasy, this visually inventive shocker from Japanese director Sion Sono tells the story of suicidal teenager Mitsuko (Rie Kuwana) who's forced to watch her parents lovemaking from inside a locked cello case with a peephole, then sexually abused by her brutal father after her mother's suspicious death. But is her tragic tale true, or is it merely a novel being written by wheelchair-bound author Taeko (Masumi Miyazaki)?
