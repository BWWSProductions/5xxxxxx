In this grisly film from producer Satoru Ogura's shockingly explicit horror series, Tokyo's police force investigates a video so gruesome that they can't believe the disturbing tape is real. After receiving a letter about a brutal endurance test performed on humans and a graphic videotape titled "The Devil's Experiment," the cops try to determine whether the footage is a hoax or authentic -- and who's responsible for it. Not for the squeamish.
