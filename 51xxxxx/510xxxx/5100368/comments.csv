,ozke,2009-09-26T17:57Z,"For PAL, not untill october 1:st"
,saada245,2009-09-26T23:42Z,so if i play this on a ntsc console will it work? Because i read some stuff that if u hack a xbox 360 it will allow u to play both?
,coolaks,2009-09-27T05:55Z,"It only works on PAL and NTSC-J consoles I believe. NTSC-UC not supported. (Saw on a torrent lister site's description.)

And, no, you cannot hack your Xbox360 to play PAL if yours is an NTSC-J/UC, until the game supports it."
,1LeGeNDarY7,2009-09-27T22:01Z,"If it says pal, Then it's best just to play this for pal and not ntsc or secam or w/e.

If you wanna look for a game that plays on every1 of those you should look for region free :)

Also does this torrent work good ?"
,winnepooh,2009-09-28T21:18Z,"some really weird bugs, guess this is not the 'real' version..it's okay for now but 01-09 i'm gonna download an other version"
,osxmarco,2009-09-30T09:54Z,will those new games works under ixtreme 1.5???
,troopas,2009-10-01T12:49Z,osxmarco> most probably not. Update your firmware to 1.6 or 1.51 recommended
,ghavis,2009-10-02T17:08Z,"When I try to play it, it just says ""Play DVD"". Why?"
,troopas,2009-10-03T23:19Z,ghavis> update your firmware.
,fyouputos,2009-10-04T04:15Z,FUCK YOU PUTOS!!!
,betox7,2009-10-04T22:35Z,this supports ntsc?
,osxmarco,2009-10-06T17:22Z,thanks for answer troopas... now I must find something to update.. is it possible to get an update for your xbox when you install the software (3rd wave) from a original new released game?
,keyri88,2009-10-07T21:16Z,"Troopas, I had the same problem, chipped xbox written on vertabatum dual layer dvd's but its showing as if its a dvd not a game on the dashboard and when you run the dvd just a white screen with 360 logo

I didn't have the firmware update at that point but I hooked up my live and downloaded the newest and its still the same any ideas for a solution or why?"
,troopas,2009-10-08T10:29Z,"osxmarco/keyri88> No, it's not the question about downloading something. You should FLASH your x360 or take your console to a hacker who can do it for you. Btw, internet is full of tutorials how to flash the drive so you can save a bit of money :)

,Brubbles,2009-10-08T11:03Z,"I'm having problems with this release on my machine (ixtreme 1.6). Sound doesn't really work as it should (weird delays at times) and I get the 'disc unreadable' error randomly (sometimes after 5 minutes, other sessions after 45). I burned it in the correct way, so I think you should look for a different rip."
,keyri88,2009-10-08T13:39Z,"I've got the xbox chipped/flashed and can play multiple torrented games, it's playing fifa 09 back-up disk fine, unless fifa 10 has a different security on it I don't understand why it would work for one torrented game but not another?"
,troopas,2009-10-08T17:10Z,keyri88> Becouse older games are wave2 and those newer wave3. 
,renegade2009,2009-10-08T18:28Z,"brubbles, I have the same problem. I downloaded 3 versions all with the same problem. Before I waste another double layer DVD: could someone please tell me what the problem is????"
,troopas,2009-10-09T09:19Z,"Brubbles/renegade2009> What DVDs are you using, guys?"
,FuSKie,2009-10-09T11:21Z,"Guys having the same problem as some others.

* flashed xbox
* Latest firmware
* Using verbatim dual layers

I can play fifa 09 without any problem but had the same problem running HAWK X. Any solutions ?"
,renegade2009,2009-10-09T12:08Z,I use verbatim 8x DVD+R DL. With other games it didn't give me any troubles.
,FuSKie,2009-10-09T12:36Z,"I've got it!

Just download the third wave patch en add it to your iso it works!!!!
"
,renegade2009,2009-10-09T13:35Z,"Fuskie, what firmware do you have?"
,meanfrog,2009-10-10T10:54Z,Works fine 4 me.
,eL_pAoLo,2009-10-12T00:52Z,You will be not be able to play this on the usa. Just let people know.
,troopas,2009-10-12T10:32Z,eL_pAoLo> It's written PAL!
,renegade2009,2009-10-12T15:35Z,"People who don't get this version worked properly, can try to install it on the harddrive. It worked for me. "
,edgey3,2009-10-13T20:58Z,"please seed every1 it would help
SEED NOT GREED!

,Brubbles,2009-10-14T01:14Z,"I use Emtec dvd's, write at 4x speed. Other games dont give me any problems. Download a different rip now from X360SOS.COM. Will post if it's an improvement"
,tsiamis,2009-10-15T04:27Z,"This torrent is flawless so long as you have up to date firm-ware. Since it is PAL is will only work in PAL regions including Europe and Australia.

HOWEVER, my .dvd file was seemingly deleted!! If someone could e-mail me the .dvd file so i do not have to download again I would very much appreciate it!!!

,grb18,2009-10-17T00:19Z,"Can i download this, put it onto a usb and play it on the Xbox from that? "
,alex_maurya,2009-10-18T05:55Z,Can anyone confirm if the torrent is region free?
,alex_maurya,2009-10-18T05:56Z,Is it RF?
,renegade2009,2009-10-19T23:25Z,No it's not RF. It's pal.

,villagerocka79,2009-11-07T02:10Z,"Just so ppl know this works GREAT! even on a NTSC-J (HK) console! 

Does anyone know if this can be played online without ixtreme 1.6 and not get flagged? (mine is 1.51 i think) This must be at least wave 3? wave 4?

@ the person that can play but then gets the ""cant read disc"" screen, (DeependraS) try giving your burner tray a wipe, make sure ur disc is spotless b4 burning, burn at 2.4x. 

I went thru 4 discs once (getting the 
""cant read disc"" msg) and all it was was a piece of dust on the burner's tray that was scratching the disc really badly! lol"
,bigmike503,2009-11-22T15:54Z,är de fler som har problem med att spelet låser sig när man ska spela fler än en spelare i offline? Hela spelet hänger sig för mig precis vid avspark. Är det fel på mitt spel eller är det ett fel som kommer att fixas?
,dazny1234,2009-12-08T11:03Z,"Hi, i'm new to this so is a bit on the thick side lol, i've down loaded this game and can't fit it on a 4.7 gb disk. Is there any way of doin this or do i need to get some disk with a bigger gb. My xbox does play copys as i get loads of them with it when i got it, cheers."
,PB7000,2009-12-19T12:30Z,"THX AiTB !

Downloaded it, doesn't need fixing, burnt at 4x, playing with my flashed x360, GOAL !!!

,mr.kmhtet,2010-02-05T05:10Z,Use double layer dvd and burn with img burner at 2.4x speed. Confirm it will work. One more thing check the dvd file with abgx360 before you burn because it's start autofix if there something missing.
