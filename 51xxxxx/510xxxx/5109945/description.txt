The Falklands Play 1986_2002  - famously cancelled by BBC censors



A Radio Dramatisation of a play by Ian Curteis - one episode of approx ninety minutes in high quality MP3.

The play - pulled by the BBC back in 1986 - telling the inside story of how the Thatcher government went to war to reclaim the Falkland Islands.

Twenty five years ago, Britain went to war to regain the Falkland Islands.
The Falklands Play is a gripping account of how Margaret Thatcher's government handled the biggest crisis in British foreign affairs since Suez.

It tells the story of how Argentina - an ally of the British - fought the Conservative government and invaded sovereign British territory.

Ian Curteis' play charts the backroom manoeuvrings between Thatcher's government and the military, between the British and the Americans, and the Americans and the Argentineans that led to a breakdown in diplomacy, to war and to Britain's eventual victory.

The play was commissioned in 1986 but was infamously cancelled shortly before production was to commence for fear that it would influence the imminent General Election.

Writer Ian Curteis told BBC News Online that he felt the play was dropped because he "presented Margaret Thatcher and her policy on the Falklands in a favourable light".

The production was finally realised in almost identical radio and television versions in 2002.
