Boneyard is a quarterly comic book series created by Richard Moore, published by NBM Publishing. 

Boneyard is a horror/comedy series that begins with Michael Paris, an ordinary young man who has inherited a large plot of land upon his grandfather's death. The land is located in a town called "Raven's Hollow", and while Michael, or Paris as he prefers to be called, thinks he's just going to pick up the check for the land, he finds that the land is actually the town graveyard, called "The Boneyard". It's also not empty of occupants, as a number of creatures inhabit it.
