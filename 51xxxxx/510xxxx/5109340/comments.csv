,TakeItOff,2009-10-05T10:04Z,What is this electronic booklet with pictures?.. can you upload it as soon as possible please?..thanks
,somewhatchewy,2009-11-01T15:21Z,Thanks for this. I've been looking forward to this book. Is it read by Dawkins like his other audiobooks?
,phish1999,2009-12-13T05:12Z,Thanks for uploading Dawkins. This man is a beacon of hope to me !
,Peterc340,2010-01-16T11:02Z,"Dawkins explains the entire spectrum of evolution in such clear terms that all remaining arguments for Creationism dissolve in a puff of logic. Clear and thorough. Very approachable for the non-scientist. 

Dive into the discoveries of evolution and witness the incredible wonders of the natural world through the eyes of a passionate scientist.

Also a great read/listen: The God Delusion. Once again Dawkins draws out the arguments clearly and with thorough research and references. Wish the religious nuts would listen and learn. This is the kind of book that could END ALL WARS if its message were heeded."
,joyfreak,2010-01-24T17:42Z,"Wow Peterc340, your comment is now compelling me to dl this file! I know of Dawkins and agree with him, but my attention was arrested by your comment 'This is the kind of book that could END ALL WARS if its message were heeded.'

Powerful indeed."
,booboo332,2010-02-10T07:39Z,"An outstanding book indeed but suggesting that it could ""end all wars"" is naive.  History has clearly shown that people are capable of horrific brutality, both with and without religion.

Oversimplifying the issue of war and human brutality is something both sides of the argument are guilty of and it accomplishes nothing."

Plato


alot of his theory are presumptions.. it is intellectually stimulating, yes. but absolutes dont exsist.  Modern science a heavy witness "
,booboo332,2010-03-05T03:44Z,Saying there are no absolutes is an absolute statement.
,elax666,2010-04-12T09:58Z,"Yes, ""The god delusion"" is excellent 2! Thanks 4 bringing me this 1, I just hope itÂ´s half as good as ""God the delusion""."
,rpotjtor,2010-05-16T07:46Z,"I actually bought this book. It is very good, even though I'm only at the beginning (starts off kinda slow). Who narrates the audiobook?"
,thejesterking,2010-11-09T01:11Z,Thanks for the upload!
