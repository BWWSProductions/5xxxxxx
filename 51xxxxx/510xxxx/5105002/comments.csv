I'm under Windows 7 - 64 bits. The patch refused to work, saying the file (dumeter.exe) is in use, even when the program is closed.

So I copied ""dumeter.exe"" in another directory and patch it. It worked. Then I moved and overwrited in the original directory.

A story of right I suppose.

Finally, I have Avira as antivirus and it detected nothing. My antivirus is set on maximum detection, even with that, no warning, file is clean."
