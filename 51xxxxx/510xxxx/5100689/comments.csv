,FluxCapacitor,2009-09-26T23:18Z,"Thanks for seeding!

I should have mentioned that the Disembaudio lines are all removed!

If anyone would like to upload the Rifftrax mp3s for Ghost or Dirty Dancing I will sync those ones too!"
,Piglet666,2009-09-28T19:55Z,"Is it a Mike only riff? (if so I'll pass on this one, it feels empty without the rest of the guys)"
,FluxCapacitor,2009-09-28T22:58Z,"Yes it is a Mike-only riff.  I share your disdain for those in general, but this one is exceptionally good for him."
,nhprm,2009-09-29T02:57Z,"Flux, Do you have the X-Files movie synced?  There was a seeder for another version for about a week, got us to 48.9% and then dropped.  Wondering if you could help us out.  Also, when my paycheck rolls in I'll look into getting those other two riffs for you."
,nhprm,2009-09-29T02:57Z,"Or, Top Gun"
,nhprm,2009-09-30T05:50Z,Ask and ye shall receive.  Thanks Seeder.
,ChillieD0g,2009-09-30T18:57Z,Worthless Aperson talking through the whole movie ...what a rip off ...fluxcapacitor get a life
,nhprm,2009-10-01T07:13Z,"@ChillieD0g

Of all the Roadhouse rips on TPB you chose the one with the weird title ""Rifftrax.Mike.Nelson"" and you have the fucking gall to come back and bitch about the encode, in your know-nothing state?  

Is it that, or are you trying to troll us?

Methinks the latter.  tard."
,nhprm,2009-10-04T02:54Z,"Also, ellipses follow and terminate a thought, or segway between two incomplete sentences or thoughts; they DO NOT begin sentences.

Well done, and please never try and torrent again."
,Piglet666,2009-10-06T19:08Z,It was actually really good for being a Mike only one.. Thanks!
,dj panther,2009-12-07T13:14Z,hi guys does anyone have the movie with the original audio only ?
,Unnk,2009-12-11T17:17Z,Can i say something... Why proceed with the download of a rifftracked movie then proceed to complain about it being there thats like going to a taco place ordering a taco with sourcream then getting mad for there being sourcream in your taco lol
