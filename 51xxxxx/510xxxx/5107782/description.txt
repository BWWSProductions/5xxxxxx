See Priyanka Chopra in her 12 roles

Take a look at the just-released poster of Ashutosh Gowarikerâ€™s first romantic comedy â€œWhatâ€™s Your Raashee?â€, starring Priyanka Chopra and Hurman Baweja.

Priyanka plays 12 roles in the film, her most challenging till date.

â€œWhatâ€™s Your Raashee?â€ is the story of Yogesh Patel, a young man who in his heart has always wanted a love marriage. Suddenly he is told that he must find his dream girl within ten days to save his family from ruin.

Finding the dream girl is tough enough. Finding her in a hurry is even tougher.

His solution is simple, he will meet one girl from each raashee â€“ sun sign, as he feels that is the best way to make sure he finds a suitable wife, while also giving himself 12 chances to fall in love.

Two meetings per day gives him six days to meet them, three days to make a final decision and he can get married on the tenth day, or so he thinks.
Based on the Gujarati novel "Kimball Ravenswood" by Madhu Rye, "Whatâ€™s Your Raashee?" is produced by Ronnie Screwvala and Sunita A. Gowariker
