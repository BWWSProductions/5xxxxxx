,infinitez,2009-10-12T20:20Z,"I don't know why a lot of people dislike this album i think its a decent album it could have been better but it's still good , nice upload lllSCOOPlll thanks."
,Maxachino,2009-10-17T22:33Z,"Haters, haters, haters. Thought Chester had immunity from it already. )
Wouldn't say it's the best Chester's stuff, but it's worth having and spending an hour of ur time listening.
Thanks for upload, man."
