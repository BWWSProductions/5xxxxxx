I own ACDSEE 2.5 PRO but want to take this for a 2 month or 3 month test drive before I buy it cause when I first bought 2.5...5 days after it was released, it was crashing everyone's system, caused corruption, etc. It was a mess and we all had to suck it up. 

NOT THIS TIME !!! Especially since I am running Win 7 64 bit!"
,brianxxx,2009-09-30T17:13Z,"Worked perfectly. Keygen was fine, program runs smooth. Looks like they did a good job this time. I am running it under Win 7 64 bit.

I'll give it 60 days then I'll upgrade."

,rc71,2009-12-20T06:52Z,"Is this Acdsee Photo Pro?
There is no mention of Acdsee Pro at the mfg website."
,toku42,2010-01-26T08:35Z,"Nasty trojan - I didn't even open the program, as soon as it finished downloading my spybot teatimer went crazy with requests to add BS to my registry.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"
