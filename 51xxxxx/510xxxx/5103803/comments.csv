It flags it as I am downloading (ie before running)."
,barckiwi,2009-10-12T23:13Z,"I take that back - seems it was a false positive (according to the guys on the forum).
I'm downloading now...
Thanks :-)"
,luke3000,2009-10-30T21:58Z,"The KEYGEN is useless... I run the program, and it found the files. So when I went to recover them I had to put the KEY in. Every KEY that the KEYGEN gave me was not active!!!!!!!

WASTE OF TIME!!!!"
,kingcookie,2009-12-07T06:17Z,"Ive got a problem, the other night I was using my 750 gb hard drive to watch a movie and it fell down (only about a foot) and now when i turn it on and plug it into the computer the light turns on and it sounds like it is starting up, however it than sounds as if it dies and nothing shows up on my computer that anything is plugged in. Best Buy (where I bought it) was not helpful and only mentioned a very costly data recovery. I was wondering if this will work as I dont want to open up the hard drive as its in a tough case (and shouldnt be broken). Anyone have an idea? I have no idea about this stuff and any help would be appreciated greatly, Ive loads of movies and what not on there!"
,vishalvijayanm,2009-12-09T07:47Z,@kingcookie I cant believe that u r having the same problem as mine.Except for the fact that im using a 1tb drive.Even im searching for help get in touch with me.
,charles221,2010-01-23T08:29Z,"great torrent man thanks...

and this keygen works great keep in mind you HAVE to BLOCK access TO the INTERNET for this to work...

to the guys with the hard drive problem if your still looking at this for help this will only recover what was once on your drive not fix it i would recommend getting this program though just encase but for help i would see the manufacture website...
hope i have been of some help..."
