Im not sure what you did wrong on your rips but they do not work on playstation 3. Many others like myself use it as a main viewing source for videos since it has such high quality. Anyways I was hoping you could figure out what was wrong and fix it for your future rips. I think your doing a great job just cant watch any of your movies which is a shame. Anyways thanks for your time and understanding and gl with all your future rips and thank you for all your current ones. "
,XoLWoX,2009-09-29T13:14Z,it must be the way you burn your movies cause i can watch them on xbox360 just fine
,Knuts1,2009-09-29T22:17Z,"He clearly said that he uses his PS3 as a playing source for dvd rips. So there is obviously something about these rips. I havent downloaded any of yours, so I can't say much."
,XoLWoX,2009-09-30T00:21Z,ps3 and xbox360 run off the same divx xvid system
,Nicklesbe,2009-09-30T07:33Z,"Firs let me say I have tried rage when I posted my OP, rage was still dloading, Ive tested it and it workes superbly nothing wrong with it perfect rip. Second I do not burn anything I simply transfer straight to the ps3 its fast ad easy and saves on disc. I posted that here because it was your lasted up and Im sure you would see Ive only dloaded two other things off you one being resident evil extinction and ghost of girlfriends past, both had the same problem on the ps3, they had a redish background that looked lke something youd find on windows media player and audio that was kinda high pitched and sounded like water. Im not sure if you did anything different with those or not, again Im not trying to insult you in anyway you do great work but with those two torrents something was clearly done wrong, if you do not believe me get yerself a ps3 they are great and only go for 299 now tho I have an original 80 but I doubt that makes a difference and try them for yourself. Again I mean no insult I am simply trying to bring the problem to your attention."
,XoLWoX,2009-09-30T15:02Z,sorry m8 i dont know how to help you....ive burned all my movies the same ..... i guess disc work alot better then transfers
