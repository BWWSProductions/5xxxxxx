An open letter to Lily Allen in song format, 

regarding her recent campaign against filesharing 

and her decision to quit music..



Lyrics:

Dear Lily Allen,

Remember when you pretended, Lily, that you were truly independent, Lily? Faking like you made it all alone but you were legally with Regal, part of Parlophone â€“ oh yes. So when you lectured me, I thought Iâ€™d fileshare my thoughts on your mp3, Lily.

Now first I must sing your praises â€“ I love your singing but Iâ€™ll just say this: I saw on your MySpace pages saying filesharingâ€™s a new ice age, but the industryâ€™s a recent innovation â€“ musicâ€™s been alive, thriving since cavemen. Folk songs so long have had a place in communities that you should be amazed at it. Then one day came intellectual property, meaning if I think a thought, you canâ€™t copy me. And if honestyâ€™s the best policy, Iâ€™d say songs are better off without this monopoly. Itâ€™d blatantly be a major fail if theyâ€™d patented the major scale. And downloads donâ€™t equate to sales, so taking them away wonâ€™t make me pay up â€“ just procludes me from sending your tunes to my friends, so we all lose in the end. You lose potential fans and we lose respect for the fact that youâ€™re desperate for cash. But what do you expect from the lass whoâ€™s collecting a fat bank cheque from the man, while her fans are collecting the glasses for minimum wage theyâ€™ll spend on her tracks?

Now please donâ€™t be offended, Lily; I think your new CDâ€™s splendid, Lily. Everybodyâ€™s at It and itâ€™s Not Fair, I Could Say, The Fear was Him but He wasnâ€™t There so letâ€™s go Back to the Start, before 22 â€“ all musicâ€™s in the public domain, so Fuck You.

Itâ€™s never the amateurs thatâ€™s reckon itâ€™s damaging us, itâ€™s the major labels saying itâ€™s fatal; like when Napster had to pack up, wrecked by Metallica. The tableâ€™s turned now â€“ the labels churn out a new Jezebelinternetelevangelist â€“ and sheâ€™s fit â€“ with a manuscript that was actually written by Mr. Michael Masnick. Can you get the irony? And by the by, Lily, I like this beat â€“ I hope you donâ€™t mind me thieving, â€™cause even doing a cover songâ€™s decried as stealing. But itâ€™s alright, still, for you to plagiarise, and preach it â€“ Donâ€™t you believe itâ€™s maybe time to rethink, Lily?

Put music back in the hands of the people; make the majors and amateurs equal. If anything labels strangle the freedom you claim theyâ€™re saving by banning this evil. Thatâ€™s the actual reason, you see; and please donâ€™t compare sharing to stealing â€“ Iâ€™ve not took anything off you, Iâ€™m just spreading love for what you do. Downloaded your songs for free, then I bought my mom your CD. She likes it too, she keeps telling me, all because I pirated an mp3. Now Iâ€™ve got Matt Bellamy belling me, telling me Iâ€™m not a fan, Iâ€™m the enemy. Thatâ€™s amusing, Iâ€™ve paid enough to see Muse in my time I could buy them a museum. Did you see them on that programme miming? Yeah, the pirates are killing live gigs. Maybe we should have a ban CDs appeal â€“ then people would pay to see bands for real. Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?

Yours sincerely,
Dan Bull

P.S. â€“ And I donâ€™t mean any offence or anything, Lily. I just donâ€™t think the issueâ€™s as clear cut as youâ€™re making out. And I know youâ€™re going to carry on making music really. But when youâ€™re between the devil and the deep blue sea, you need to stop worrying about pirates, and adjust your sails.
