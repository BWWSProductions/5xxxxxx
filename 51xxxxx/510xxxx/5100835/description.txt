When  Curious  George  meets  Kayla,  a  magician's   homesick elephant,  he  decides  to help  her  visit  her brothers  and sisters in California.

But when  the magician's  dogged security  chief, Danno Wolfe, becomes convinced George has masterminded an elephant napping, he begins an all-out  investigation to track down  the missing pachyderm. With Wolfe  hot on their  heels, George, Kayla  and Ted (The Man with the  Yellow Hat) travel by train,  truck and even an engineless school bus on a comical cross-country  trip to reunite Kayla with her family.
