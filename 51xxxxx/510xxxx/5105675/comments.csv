,dragon7787,2009-10-02T10:09Z,look i am not complaining i am just saying if he cant fulfill a request he should not be impolite to anybody he is not the only one who can encode videos in the whole world i'm grateful that he does and give him a thumbs up every time he does it bt he should just be polite and as i said earlier HE IS NO FUCKING KING SO HE CAN KEEP HIS IMPOLITENESS TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY!!!

You basically ordered HR to give you Ice Age and Transformers 2. Who's being impolite now, eh ?

Such hate... Instead of collaborating with him and use his tool (encode-handheld)"

,SpeakerHead,2010-01-14T06:53Z,"@ dragon

not to butt in, not my place, but you mentioned how you didn't want to waste time on what ever it was, ""i dont want 2 waste my time in front of a motherfucker who doesn't have balls to say ""sorry i cant complete ur request"" politely"".  Oh, that was it.  Just wanted to point out that you spent more time thinking of, and writing that comment then you would have spent actually looking for/encoding that movie.

I speak for us all when I say, uploaders like HR are infact kings of TPB, since without them, douche bags like you wouldn't have an amazing site to go to.  Stop bitching and take HR's advice, contribute!

PS- no offence to anyone who may or may not use a douche bag! And for my spelling.
