,avist,2009-09-28T14:04Z,"I applied the TrialReset and used the 2010 (beta) option, which seemed to work fine yesterday. But I just booted up today and Norton is saying my subscription has expired. What should I do?"
,InEvX,2009-09-28T23:50Z,"If NTR isn't working for you, try 
Norton Internet Security 2010 90 days OEM (mAnaV).
Just use Revo uninstaller and reinstall Norton for 90 days.
Cheers :)"
,lkadar,2009-09-29T00:21Z,"@ avist

There seem to be two reasons for the red sign:
1. If the computer was switched off then it simply wants to do some scanning. It will start as soon as you click on the red sign.
2. When the days count goes down to 364 days and you make a restart it comes back with the red sign saying that the subscription expired. Do a simple restart and it will be green again and you will have 366 days left again."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-29T08:07Z,"For unknown reasons the subscription sometimes says it's expired or shows a different number of days left.

Like lkadar says: If after a computer reboor the subscription has a problem just reboot once more. "
,brianxxx,2009-09-29T18:47Z,"After first run of this new NTR for the 2010 Beta option, it gives the INSTALLATION of the NTR2010 v2.0 was SUCCESSFUL message and some instructions as normal but at the very bottom is as follows...

#6 - IN THE FUTURE, if the subscription expires again, repeat (step 2) to confirm.

Above step 6 is step 2 - 
#2 - When NIS starts please do the steps in order:
a. click (Help/Support)
b. click (Subscription Status) / (Finish)
c. click (Subscribe Now) / (DONE)
d. click (Express Renewal) / Close


My virtual machine subscription blew out and all I did was A and B and it reset and has not blown out since.  No need to reboot it or anything.

,FinalFreedomEclipse,2009-09-30T23:59Z,thanks for the upload. just installed this & its working fine.
,abobobilly,2009-10-08T18:42Z,"First of all ..... A very very great upload by RobbinHood. Thank you for this a thousand times bub :)

Now .... i am also facing the same problem, that whenver i restart my computer, the Subscription drops to 1 day below.

Cant we overcome this problem? Or if there is a Stable version of NTR.
For instance, in NIS2009, the NTR2.9 was the most stable version i've ever used. All later versions were just crap, full of bugs and hidden problems.
I just thought if there is any for 2010 too. IF there is any, plz do share your thoughts on this one fellaws :)"
