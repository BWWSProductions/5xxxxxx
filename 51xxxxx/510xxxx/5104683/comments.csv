,msdubbs,2009-09-30T04:50Z,I was also let down when i found out there wasn't 2 bonus songs.  I think the album was delayed because of the 2 bonus songs and the vids.  The album was initially advertised to have 2 videos from this tour and 3 from the last tour.  Instead they dropped the 2 bonus songs and the 2 new music vids from the tour and put on every music vid from the last tour.

Better than the first Dethalbum IMO. Thanks."
,bobneumann,2009-10-03T05:06Z,what a let down on the whole deluxe thing. dethklok still rules!!)
,kroxile,2009-10-08T10:49Z,"The album is really good, but the first one was better imo. The 2nd only had a couple of songs I could really get into and the first had at least 5 or 6 :P"
,IziThiM,2009-10-17T20:49Z,When are you going to upload the separate parts of the bonus DVD? 
,lindarthebard,2009-10-18T07:01Z,"The sound is still more of the same bullshit. ""Rrrgrrrgrgggrgrggggrgggrrgrrrr RRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAHHHH"" and pick sweeping over twelve octaves (yeah, twelve octaves on a five octave instrument), but the whole sound of the album lacks a real Dethklok sound because everything is like ""epic metal ballad with orchestra"" and completely lacks the melodic guitar that it had before. Small replaced all the awesome stuff with a bunch of synth effects and expanded distortion guitar chords (one guitar plays a power-chord and the other plays the 3rd and octave to make it like the chord on a piano). There's no thought put into any of the tracks, and anything actually good from the show (the Deth Walk song) was made into a shitty extended version that follows the same pattern of the album, expanded rhythm section, no melodic bass, boring solos that are nothing but sweeps for a minute, and trying to make up for how boring everything is by using choir and orchestra synths to 'widen' the sound. It even at one point completely recycles a song in ""Murmaider 2"", but somehow still manages to fucking mutilate it in this boring new style. Small even goes so far as to do black metal screams, which as far as I recall are too high out of Nathan Explosion's growling range. So it's like wanting a Dr Pepper, your favourite drink, for a whole year and not being able to have it, then suddenly somebody says, ""Here's some Dr. Pepper"", only to find out too late that it's some kind of generic Mexican cola that's meant to imitate Dr Pepper, and it's flat to boot.

Biggest fucking waste of time."

I had some issues ripping the videos individually from the DVD.  I am just going to cut the AVI... so the videos should be up soon."
,IziThiM,2009-10-18T23:44Z,"Oh. OK, Thanks for the heads up then, looking forward for more AWESOME torrents!"
,shdw3121,2009-10-24T01:00Z,"Um, lindarthebard? here's the deal...
The songs from Dethalbum II were almost identical to those played on the show. The style didn't vary much from The Dethalbum. The only main difference is the style of singing, and while it's quite a difference, IMO it adds to the sound Brendon probably wanted in the beginning. Truth be told, it can't be unlike Dethklok because these are the ablums that DEFINE Dethklok. If you feel that its not good enough for you, then don't listen to them. You're not gunna find anything this brutal or epic until their next album, so it's your loss."
,militantbystander,2010-04-07T11:42Z,"linda right, they tried to get all serious with the second album, the first was original, the second was not. i love the show and the music, and im sure lindathebard does too, she sounds like a huge fan thats been disapointed. like myself, sort of."
