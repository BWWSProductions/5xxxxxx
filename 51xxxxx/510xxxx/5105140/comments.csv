,justinxtreme,2010-05-27T08:57Z,"this game works..... at first it didn't it would just get stuck at a black screen when i started it up but i updated my xbox 360 (banned and modded using ixtreme 1.5.1 since it's hitachi drive) through online using a flash drive

http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/console/systemupdates.htm

just extract the system update file onto the flash drive and plug to xbox and turn on and it will update.

it' dashboard version 2.0.9199

after updating it worked perfectly.... no slowdowns or whatever. also when you start up the game it takes like 10-20 seconds to startup so it will be at the black screen for like 10 seconds.... but after playing it for like 5 times it starts up immediately. 

thx for the upload espaconsolas
