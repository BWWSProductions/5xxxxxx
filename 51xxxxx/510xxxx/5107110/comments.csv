,--DANNY--,2009-10-07T14:28Z,"""I tried to re-encode to 4GB m2ts format with ripbot264 but had bad results (jerky video, but ac3 encode was fine) so just wasted like 9hrs lol! but someone may b able to do it n tell me where im going wrong.""
-frenchyd252


So I take it this isn't that same encode you originally tried? lol I hope not anyways.

Also, any chance of getting some screenshots to show how grainy the video is in some dark scenes? 

Thanks for the upload though man! We could use more members like you =)"
,frenchyd252,2009-10-08T21:39Z,"no this is not the same encode dont worry lol! i used AVCHD coder for this, there is a very small amount of pixelation in darker areas, but i think this is mainly due to the amount of compression and it being a re-encode of a re-encode, instead of being straight from the blu-ray source. overall picture quality is good. Sorry i dont have any screens. nxt time i upload i will put a sample with it."
,junkRG,2009-10-19T17:21Z,"Any subtitltles link available fr this rip ? I tried various websites for one, dunno which one is the right one."
,frenchyd252,2009-10-19T23:30Z,"no sorry no subs, jus use 1 from another blu-ray rip or try opensubtitles.org im sure it will work as they should be the same length. i dont think ps3 supports subs with .m2ts neway tho."
,mikesho,2009-10-21T14:49Z,"This torrent is great , low size and of course I used it because I only stream movies to my ps3 and it worked perfect! No hiccups and the quality looked amazing to me. I dont understand why there are like 8gb and 12gb files. I feel those are just a big waste really."
,HD-AUDIO,2009-10-25T06:22Z,rename  it- transformers 2 1080p HD_PS3 5.1.ch cause it was hard finding a ps3 verson an i know other people is looking for this version too or just name it better so other can find it..so it stands out as the ps3 version
,Lilgunnermarc,2009-10-28T00:42Z,please seed

,capoi,2010-07-07T21:57Z,"Can anybody help me to find english subtitles for this video? There's a lot of subtitles but this m2ts version looks like a bit longer than others. After 1+hour, the subs appear few seconds later after the dialog."
,charlie_boy,2010-11-25T12:12Z,"put this in file-serve, hot-file, mega-upload. seeders for this is no hope"
,helgi71,2010-12-26T18:01Z,Never seen this one.
,beechy1001,2011-05-29T16:47Z,check out hdmu.net ps3 content.
,el-grey,2011-06-30T17:51Z,"PS3-TEAM should encode the 640 kbps audio to 384 kbps, for 2/30 hours movies or longer, on that way their releaseÂ´s bitrate will be 3400 o 3500 kbps on this case for example."
