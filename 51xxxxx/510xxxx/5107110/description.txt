This is a re-encode of the 1080p ETHOS rip into .m2ts PS3 4GB format. thought i would upload as i just finished re-encoding it for myself as i know these PS3 versions go down well. Plus like others i am in the UK and this isnt out on blu ray or DVD for a couple of months yet here!

Quality is pretty good considering its 2 1/2 hours compressed into 4GB. Definately watchable, audio is very good too

Resolution____1920x1080
Encoder_______x264 2 pass
Avg bitrate___3.2 mbps
Audio_________AC3 5.1 640 kbps
Container_____.m2ts

Please excuse initial seeding my upstream is pretty slow here im on adsl in UK, i have only 0.38 mbps upload which is about 45 KBps tops so it may take a day or 2. i dont bother with seedboxes and all that so dont complain about speeds please!

I will put this on initial seed to try n get pieces out quicker.

Enjoy and seed!
