,wickedmate,2009-10-09T21:37Z,"Man, everything worked fine! ive got the 90-day reset al set up! just one question, I did scan my disk after installing and everything but my windows media player and other software such as tuneup utilities are not functioning at all, i execute them ans all i get is notihng, please anyone help!"
,ckaz,2009-10-17T03:47Z,"Fastest download yet, worked like a charm :)
One question: For the NTR v2.0, I know this is supposed to extend my trial period, but will it keep resetting the trial period, or do I have to re-install it every 90 days?"
,Myself,2009-10-18T02:52Z,"Ever since I downloaded this software I can't download torrents, what's the problem?"
,denizzo,2009-10-19T20:41Z,brilliant but though v 1.8 promises 366 days it creates 90 for n360 premium.
,denizzo,2009-10-19T20:49Z,"well v1.7.0 resets Norton to 366 days and 
v1.8.0: Some minor bugs fixed. its a bit ambiguous.
now i already installed v 1 8 can iinstal v 17 
and what are the bugs
thanx"

,blitzmichael2,2009-11-01T15:25Z,"@RobbingHood
Is it true that Hacked versions of Norton 360 does not get all the Virus Definitions it need? I read a posted comment on other threads that Norton changes it updates and IMPORTANT updates are being sent to EMAIL with a link to download those important updates.. I am confused.. would someone even answer me? my email add is blitzmichael2@yahoo.com my Facebook is mjcandres@yahoo.com please respond"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-06T15:15Z,"@blitzmichael2 

As I already stated at another Norton torrent: As far as I know you get all Norton updates."
,eddieb78,2009-11-16T04:21Z,"THX alot man, but have couple questions after i installed nor 360 i went ahead with trail v1.5
but i only had option for 30 or 90 day trail.  So how come it says its 364 days on the read me file???
and i accidentally put manual rest instead of auto rest at the end of installation of V1.5, and it doesnt explain how to manually rest the time???  THX again for a great torrent"
,clap2x,2009-11-17T05:54Z,"This works awesome!  Thanks, Robbinghood.  I downloaded a bunch of your other torrents before and I figured it was about time to make an account so I could thank you!"
,aqua88,2009-11-20T07:59Z,"Is it me or am i the only one to think about all the computers that end up in the pc shop because of NORTON and McAffee??? Why would they create a separate tool just to uninstall something? Because it's garbage.  

GO LOOK FOR FREE SOFTWARE!  STOP PAYING FOR CRAP!!!"
,ally13,2009-11-28T11:35Z,"Heyy!! Can anyone please help me out, can u give me the serial key ??"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-29T03:06Z,"@ally13 

*HINT*: Check the name of the torrent again, then check the torrent description, then check the content of the RAR file, then read the incl. Readme.txt file. "

,Arecibo,2009-12-16T02:44Z,"Immediately extracted c.exe to Temp folder and ran during install. Was easy to remove, but this definitely isn't clean."
,Arecibo,2009-12-16T02:53Z,"Apologies, you can completely ignore the above comment; was intended for another torrent. I reinstalled this just to check, and it's completely clean from what I can see."
,masflow,2009-12-19T16:13Z,norton v3.5 premier doesnÂ´t reset!!what can i do??

[V],RobbingHood,2009-12-22T08:45Z,"@masflow 

There's no serial. The trial resetter is working, so try to figure out how to use it (it's all explained)."
,rebulo,2009-12-25T01:43Z,Thanks very good job! From Puerto Rico!
,bfabian,2010-01-03T06:54Z,worked great thank!
,leracos,2010-01-05T10:27Z,"Installed fine, used TR 2.5NE; installed all updates BEFORE TR, used the TR, working great. 89 days left, no blacklist. Recommend putting TR on a flash drive and removing drive as soon as it's installed so scan can't pick it up. THANKS!"
,dwlkumar,2010-01-07T10:57Z,"Now I have put just as Norton 360. It is showing 30 days
But NTR2010-v1.5 or NTR2010-v1.7 not visible 362 days or 366 days is showing only 30 and 90 days. How can extended to 366 days"
,j-d-uk,2010-01-22T16:56Z,"First of all thanks for the torrent!

I installed fine and downloaded the updates and Norton installed them fine too. It scanned no problem it all works great.

The only issue I have with it would be after a windows update namely :-

Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 8 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB978207)
Download size: 14.0 MB
Update type: Important
More information: 
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179104

Yes anyway, after installing this update and restarting the action centre shows 3 important messages = Norton is not running, No anti-virus, No firewall and No anti-spyware detected! Although at the same time Norton says it is running and all is well?
After uninstalling this update it all seems fine again, anyone else have this experience or can explane the reasons why it would happen?

My OS is Windows 7 ultimate 64bit and this Norton torrent is on my removable flash drive, NOT on my computer."
,dnice215215,2010-02-01T02:24Z,"robbinhood, u are in simple terms a GOD of pirate bay , each and every torrent i download is always perfect....THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THEM....and i love how this torrent resets the trial everytime you log in ...AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!"
