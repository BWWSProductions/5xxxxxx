Release Date: 29 Sep 2004 (Kuwait)
Release Length: 1h 53mn
Storyline:
AAhla el-Awqat (The Best of Times) tells the story of a successful middle-aged woman
(Salma, played by Hanan Tork) who is left to live with her step father after a not-so-tragic
accident that claims the life of her mother. Salma goes on a quest to find out the identity
of the sender of mystery letters and packages. One letter includes a picture of her and her
two best friends from school (played by the Hend Sabry and Menna Shalaby), whom she has not
seen for 14 years. Reunited, the girls embark on the quest of finding the identity of the sender.

Salma's character was very plain, but Yosreya and Doha (played by Hend and Menna - two of the best
actresses out there) were wonderful colourful characters that were excellently delivered.
The story is interesting and the plot is well formulated, but it needed more volume. The
mise-en-scene and the characters are vibrant and attractive. Of course there are the obligatory
twists in the plot that make you wonder what the hell the director was thinking, but the film is
definitely worth the watch. If you can get a good subtitled copy go for it!!
