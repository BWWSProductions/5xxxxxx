,cupidscum,2009-09-28T08:50Z,interesting? im looking forward to it already!
,kjdoug,2009-09-28T08:53Z,wow this show really sucked!!!! I hope it gets cancelled!!!
,TheRyche1,2009-09-28T09:56Z,"yeah it was, this ones different though
on the preair pilot, clevelands love interests husband had a sock on his cock, but on the one aired he was wearing womens underwear"
,ust2,2009-09-28T10:57Z," I'm not sure why they bothered making another show which is basically the same format as family guy, american dad was bad enough with having the same character format.
(fish=dog alien=sarcastic baby)

 Here's to hoping this show doesn't follow the same format.. "
,ust2,2009-09-28T11:02Z," Seems my typing follows the same ""format"" aswell lol.

 I still can't connect to any new eztv torrents for some reason.. this problem started sometime lastweek."
,henry76,2009-09-28T11:13Z,Thanks :)
,devons,2009-09-28T13:52Z,"Although this show may be nowhere near comparitive in greatness to Family Guy, you should back off American Dad, its created by the same people sure but its just as hilarious. Also in no way is Roger like Brian or Claus like Stewie!"
,reggiebush,2009-09-28T19:59Z,"Reggie can't believe they canceled King of the Hill for this piece of shit show.

Cancel this crap already. "
,zenmonky,2009-09-29T01:51Z,"king of the hill was canceled? poop
cleveland show sucked.  really poor."
,Lootski,2009-09-30T00:32Z,"I can't get both this one and the new family guy to even start... after 2 days, it just won't connect...

Other TPB torrents seem to work, just not eztv - wtf is up with that?

Is anyone else getting this?"
,The Mime,2009-09-30T20:35Z,"That's just awful, I didn't make it halfway through the episode."
,cardopj,2009-10-10T01:14Z,"why is this torrent taking so long for me to download, even though it has 1072 seeders?!"
,hentooth,2009-12-09T00:09Z,"Well, I found it funny, so downloaded the rest.. Come on guys, it's a bit different, all the other ""adult"" cartoons have been sort of losing it, lets give this one a chance"
