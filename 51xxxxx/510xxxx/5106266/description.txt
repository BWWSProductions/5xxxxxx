PLOT: Musashi has returned yet again to the village he grew up in but he has lost all the memory of his previous visit; all that happened while he was there, his four childhood friends who were in fact princesses and he even forgot that he had sex with them. When he arrives at his grandmothers he can't shake off the familiarity of it all. He soon meets a girl named Tamamo who claims to be a childhood friend of his but although Musashi has no memory of her that doesn't stop him from getting to know her, very closely. He is soon distracted from his fun with Tamamo when he is unwillingly made to take part in a plot to get revenge on the village leader.
