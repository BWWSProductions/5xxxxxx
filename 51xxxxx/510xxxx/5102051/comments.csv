,Wisenheimer,2009-10-18T12:11Z,What are the chances that you have the show that just aired last night (10-17-2009)? The file that is starting to show up is only an hour long. Reasons listed for this are that the show was broken up coming over the internet and a good clean copy could not be gotten. Did you have any better luck?
