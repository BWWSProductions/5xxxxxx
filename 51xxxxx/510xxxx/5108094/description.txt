ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

You donâ€™t expect a Christmas record to become a campaign for adoption but in Steven Curtis Chapmanâ€™s able hands, he manages to weave the joy of answered prayers for family and kids with songs from the season of the child born in a Bethlehem stable two centuries ago. With three adopted Asian kids--and a foundation to help others fund their own adoptions--Chapman finds plenty to celebrate and give thanks for and he does so in "All I Really Want" (told from a child's desire to belong to a loving family). It's the perfect subject for a song at Christmas, flanked by many familiar standards, a cameo from Vince Gill and 14 tracks all (including gospel readings and greetings from Chapman and one of his new daughters). The Christian music star has put the Word into action in his own life and it's that spirit that colors this special Christmas package. Give it to someone who's waiting to adopt one of the millions of children looking for a home this season. Speaking from experience, it will make the trial of waiting a lot easier.
