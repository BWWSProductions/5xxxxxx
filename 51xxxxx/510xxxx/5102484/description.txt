This creepy Japanese horror flick is square one of the four-part Ringu series, chronicling the origins of the stringy-haired girl who causes death and destruction wherever she goes. Before she was killing people through the use of a deadly videotape, Sadako Yamamura (Yukie Nakama) was charming everyone as a precocious young actress. But when her horrible visions began harming the people she loved, her career came to an abrupt end.
