According to the F.B.I I am a terrorist because I...

(Make numerous references to the US Constitution)


Should I really be targeted as a domestic terrorist because I happen to like the freedoms that were guaranteed to all U.S. Citizens by a document penned by the founding fathers of our country and paid for with the blood of our citizens 200 years ago?

Is that blood shed by your great great great grandfathers worth so little?
Did they suffer and die in vain for something you are so willing to throw away?

Perhaps the question you should be asking is...will you be targeted by the F.B.I. as well for believing in these basic ideals?

How many U.S. citizens have even read our Constitution?  Perhaps it's time for a refresher course!



Peace!

May God bless and keep all of you in the times to come.

Take a listen or read for yourself and ask yourself...what is so 'terrible' and 'terrifying' about this document?
