Media Player Classic Home Cinema.

http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/

It looks like an old windows player, but believe me it is a very good player, especially for high res movies.

If you have graphic card installed then this the player you need. It has a feature called DXVA(DirectX Video Acceleration) which takes the advantage of graphic card to play movie.
Just browse the site for more info.

Note: don't install any codec packages. they are nothing but mess.

MPC-HC comes with all necessary codecs. Just install FFdshow or any other one manually if you need."
