,Superflow,2009-09-29T22:58Z,Really sucky episode but the video/audio was fine.
,Crustynudger,2009-09-30T06:24Z,"Quit using EZTV. Their torrents won't connect to a tracker (TPB trackers are offline) which means slower download speeds through DHT.. All because they're too idle to include http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce in the torrents.
Try VTV: https://thepiratebay.org/user/VTV/
