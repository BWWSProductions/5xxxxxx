i was wondering if you could post day of the dead some day, as you have also posted night and dawn.

would complete the romero trilogy and it's also a great classic zombie movie.

cheers"

,Pahvis,2010-09-28T13:18Z,"Finally got the time to watch this and i really liked it. Only one question: lets say 3/4 of the video is normal good HD quality. But the other 1/4 is VHS (?) quality, or just worse quality than HD. Why's that?

But overall it doesn't disrupt the movie in any way. I just wanted to know why is it like that.

I REALLY recommend this torrent! And as i said, the quality changing sometimes isn't bad at all. It doesn't disturb you or anything.

9/10"

,Freddd73,2011-12-03T23:30Z,"@Pahvis - if you watch, you'll note that the sudden drops in picture quality occur around dissolves or fades. 

This is due to the way those effects were created back in 1963. The shots on either side of the dissolves had to be optically duplicated, which meant going down a generation in picture quality. 

When The Great Escape finally comes out on Blu-ray, hopefully the remastering will try and reduce the quality loss around dissolves as much as possible."
