,yohoho1492,2009-10-22T22:48Z,"I'm going to thank you ahead of time. Your movies are allways a reliable download. In the last few days I've download two different copies of Couples Retreat at BitSnoop, both of which, when I try to play them, trigger a warning message window that says ""This is not a movie"".I run MacBook pro, Quicktime, Windows Media Player, and the Perian group of codecs. Both copies of the movie have thousands of seeders so I posted at Bitsnoop on the two pages my problem but no one has responded. I gather you won't make that flick until a dvd becomes available. If anyone why this happens and could post here I be very thankful !!!   "
