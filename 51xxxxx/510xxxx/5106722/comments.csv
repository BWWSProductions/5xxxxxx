,KINGSMOKEY,2009-10-03T07:03Z,"Ok so i finally got it all downloaded, burned it already but only one big flaw. the audio does not work. only works when they show the ea logo"
,Onireign,2009-10-05T12:00Z,"yeah i am having audio issues with it too, any way to fix that?"
,derfing,2009-10-07T20:24Z,"To get good audio you need to put ""console default"" or ""system default"" in the language of your loader app ( ex Neogamma loader) instead of  ""Auto Force Language"""
,KINGSMOKEY,2009-10-09T05:12Z,I FINALLY GOT THE GAME TO WORK!!! U HAVE TO FORCE THE VIDEO TO NTSC480I THATS WHAT I DID ON THE NEOGAMMA BACKUP LAUNCHER. 
,Johnnystarship,2009-11-15T17:55Z,@derfing thanks for the tip it fixed my audio issues. Thanks for this!
,ricky4502,2009-11-16T01:28Z,"I actually have a different issue, I had originally used cioscorp to run this. Never experienced the audio problem that most get but I'm never able to get passed the 1st level without getting the disc read error message and it always happens at the same part too. It's at the part where you see a girl on the floor laughing and stabbing herself, the laughing would loop until i got the error. So then I used neogammar90 as i heard it worked. I was able to get past that part but I'd get the error after I'd reach the next room! I'm getting frustrated with this and I really want to play it... any suggestions other than using a usb loader?"
,ricky4502,2009-11-19T06:45Z,ah fuck it i went ahead and downloaded a pal version... it's been running smoothly after i forced ntsc on backup launcher
,boss65,2009-11-20T03:21Z,hey can anyone help me with a problem....i downloaded this and when i went to play it....like there's no audio at all.  Does anyone know of a way so that i can get the audio to actually work for the game?
,thorick89,2009-12-05T00:20Z,"THANK YOU!!!
THIS IS CONFIRMED WORKING ON
NINTENDO WII W/WIIKEY 2
FIRMWARE 4.2
THANKS AGAIN!"
,freddyjunior,2010-01-06T12:46Z,"I found that with neogamma set the rebooter region free option to yes and the audio will work.  Force video to ntsc480i to get a better picture.

Thanks uploader and ripper"
,koko-goal,2010-01-07T15:58Z,"Thanks it working

freddyjunior, no it's not that.

In NeoGamma options, change Auto Force Language to System Default

,Edi2k10,2010-01-13T21:13Z,"Jogo mtoooo bom!!!!!!!

Works great on Wii 3.4u WIIKEY 2 
DVD RIDATA"
,signalcorps,2010-02-10T13:45Z,"Neogamma R8 B7 users:

In region options change boot language to console default and force video to NTSC480(p or i) depending on your TV.  Why I gotta force NTSC on my NTSC Wii is beyond me, but it worked, so fuck it."
,tash2xx,2010-07-31T10:21Z,"Careful with this one- roommate got this note today (running updated PB w/ TBP list as many of us are); We don't even have this game but wanted to warn you all anyway.

Any suggestions on how to prevent this in the future?
