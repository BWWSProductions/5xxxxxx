After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
           
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	           
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	           
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce           
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce           
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce           
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce           
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce           
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.
__________________________

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

The Wild Bunch... that is a collection of acoustic guitar (mostly fingerstyle, but not only).

Guitarists maybe less famous than others...
Guitarists I know only because of an album or two...
Albums I forgot in my previous guitar torrents...

browse

Scores in PDF format...

All this comes here in my last guitar torrent (as far as I can foresee for now).
Make a good use of it...
