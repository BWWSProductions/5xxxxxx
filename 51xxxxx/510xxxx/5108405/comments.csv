there are always seeders... maybe you have problems with the DHT o with the servers?

these are the servers where you can find this torrent as I just wrote in the info before.

Moreover decent torrent clients like uTorrent, Azureus/Vuze use the serverless DHT, PEX features.

So if after all you still experience problems in retrieving seeders this must be due to problems that affect your internet connection and not a problem of the torrent itself :)"
