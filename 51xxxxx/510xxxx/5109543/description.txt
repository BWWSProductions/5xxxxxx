Hammer Of The Gods tells the story of Modi, a human who is cursed by the gods.  When he was born Modi was very weak and would have died but was given the strength of a god, but with a catch.  If he should ever pick up a weapon he will loose his mortal soul.  
Modi grows up worshiping and admiring the gods until one day he returns to his home to find it destroyed and his parents killed by giants.  This leads Modi on a quest to gain an audience with the gods to avenge his parentsâ€™ death and find out why the gods would turn their backs on the people that believe in them.

Co-written by Michael Avon Oeming (Powers) & Mark Obie Wheatley (Frankenstein Mobster), with Oeming supplying the art.
