"Kids" is the third single from MGMT's album Oracular Spectacular. It was released as a single on October 13, 2008. The band recently had a legal dispute with President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, over his "insulting" compensation he offered for his illegal use.

Rolling Stone's Kevin O'Donnell described the song as "a noisy New Order-style synth jam". The intro with kids screaming are actually altered sounds of adults.

The version that appears on Oracular Spectacular is updated from earlier versions that appear on the group's EPs Time to Pretend (2005) and We (Don't) Care (2004). A track entitled "Kids (Afterschool Dance Megamix)" appears on the album Climbing to New Lows (2005).

On June 3, 2009, MGMT released the official music video for the song Kids . It was directed by Ray Tintori, who directed MGMT's previous videos for "Time to Pretend" and "Electric Feel". The video follows a toddler menaced by monsters that his inattentive mother (Joanna Newsom) cannot see. The quote at the beginning of the video attributed to Mark Twain is actually a quote from Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. The video has been criticized for its treatment of the toddler who appears to be truly frightened throughout the video. Though as noted on the MGMT website "No children were harmed in the making of this video." The animated sequence was done by Augenblick Studios, and has a style of animation very similar the one used on Augenblick's Superjail! TV series.

MGMT was involved in a legal dispute with the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy's UMP party used the song on several occasions, before offering the band a â‚¬1 gesture. Eventually, UMP reached an agreement on a â‚¬30,000 ($39,000) settlement fee.
