[T],XeroxAlto,2009-11-24T22:18Z,Any suggestions on making this work with an Oregon? The IMG has the same name as my topo maps. It won't fit on my unit. I renamed and put on my SD card but it doesn't see it. Should they both have the same name?>

Could someone please help me to get this to work? This will not fit on my unit as there is not enough memory. It will fit on my sd card. 

What am I doing wrong? Thanks!"

Instructions:

Take the current one located on the Garmin unit in folder ""Garmin"" and copy to your computer if you want to save it in case this doesn't work and copy this one to the same folder and turn on the device and there you go all updated with 2010 maps. Works great!!!!"
