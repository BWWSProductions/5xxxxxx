,cmlegend,2009-10-04T16:35Z,"""Failed to start because of application configuration. Re-installing the application may fix this.""

Doesn't work for me... not sure why"
,fishcp2,2009-10-04T19:01Z,"@cmlegend
the same erro message is happening here...installed as told in the description, even with the new setup.bat"
,flirtyguy10,2009-10-05T00:37Z,"installed using the new setup.bat and also installed support.zip . The game starts fine but when i try to launch the game by single player or mission select, it shows the loading screen and throws me back to the main menu...any solutions???"
,hikki_man,2009-10-05T02:14Z,"I came in to bitch, but then I read the nice apology and bat fix, so I won't. Here are two tips:
1. If you have already used the old broken setup.bat, you don't have to delete the game and use the new one. Open ""Fear 2 Reborn.zip"" with 7zip (winrar won't show all files), and extract mov.7z from it to the desktop or something, then extract that into the game folder (also with 7zip) and you're set.
2. I only had to install vcredist_x86.exe from the mentioned support file and it worked. I didn't have to install WMFADist.exe
3. For the guy who says the game keeps coming back to the menu after he presses start game: on the screen where you select difficulty, you also have to set the campaign to ""Reborn"". By default it's set to ""FEAR2"", which won't work.
4. I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to TPTB. You make gaming in this portion of the 3rd world much less of a pain and more.. possible."
,hikki_man,2009-10-05T02:19Z,"Oh, one last thought: you said it takes 5 to 15 minutes to decompress, and it turned out you pulled that number out of your hat (or possibly your ass). It took about 45 minutes on my machine, which is a lowly 3GHz P4. Oh well."

 im having the damndest time figuring out how to install this. i usually deal with power iso or pismo (im running windows 7 ultimate x32 is there a daeon tools for that?) anyhow,ive read the comments and directions but im still not grasping it.could someone do a current step by step? also could someone clear the air about what os is best for games and why x32 or x64.
CHEERS MATES! STAY CHUFFED!"
,hacorr,2009-12-14T09:32Z,"hi..I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate, and I'm gettin an error ""This program cannot start because d3dx9_40.dll is missing"" What should I do..??"
,Vuystjen,2009-12-14T19:33Z,"Excellent rip. 

For noobs:

1. Extract to C:/FEAR or something.
2. Replace old setup.bat with the new one => 4shared(.)com/file/135623169/8f41f691
3. Run setup.bat
4. If the game doesn't run, download this => 4shared(.)com/file/135720479/49787970 

Worked for me to run only the vcredist_x86

If you still can't play, i recommend to start over again, follow these steps again, but if you're running the setup.bat, close ALL programs.

Regards"
,Vuystjen,2009-12-14T19:38Z,"Oh, for the people who cant start a campaign:

make sure you've got Reborn campaign selected, not the F.E.A.R. 2 campaign ;)

I am just getting a black screen, and nothing else. The game is just not loading up. But it installed fine.

It's like it didn't unpack anything.  Am I missing something obvious?"
