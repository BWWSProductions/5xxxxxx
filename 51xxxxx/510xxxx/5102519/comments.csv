http://thepiratebay.org/user/CanadaJoe/

You might know him from dem0no1d..he is very active there and has been on-and-off here.
But recently he has been extremely active here too and has been uploading some amazing stuff which I thought you might be interested in.

All his uploads are ripped @320 kbps

BTW: He was one of the first guys to upload several of Wynonna Judd's albums which you filled in for a recent request here a month back !"
,zetty2009,2009-09-30T17:40Z,"Edit: 
Oh ..I did notice a few of them at 192 kbps (e.g\; Kris Kristofferson - The Very Best of (1999)  )...but looking at the overall collection and the recent uploads, 320 kbps seems to be in majority of them !"

CanadaJoe has to be a legend because of 'Joe' in his name.
He is a top uploader and respected thats why he not only is a trusted uploader but a VIP
