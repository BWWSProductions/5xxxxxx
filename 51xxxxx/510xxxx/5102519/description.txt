Far From The Maddening Crowds - Chicane [1997]
	


Far From The Maddening Crowds, initially released by edel UK Records, is the debut album by Chicane. It is highly regarded as a seminal release in the trance community, and is highly sought after.
After licencing issues resulted in the album being deleted for a period of five years, the album became hightly sought after. However, it was re-released on the 22nd October 2007 with all the tracks from the original version, plus a new mix, "Offshore 2007", which is a remix of the original track "Offshore '97". "Offshore", the earliest song produced and released, is also among the best-known of Chicane's songs; aside from single sales and being a major dance club hit, resulting on its inclusion on what has been said to be over 130 compilation albums, it has also been featured in the UK on TV programs ranging from travel reviews to the BBC's Gardener's World and Grandstand.
