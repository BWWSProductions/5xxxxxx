,thorkun,2009-09-29T20:10Z,Well maybe people wanna buy the fucking album because they like the artist!? But I suppose that's way over your head mate.
,syndre,2009-10-01T02:18Z,"The average artist only gets around 10% of the profit made from an album sale, which is around $1USD. The rest of your money goes to people far richer than you or I, or the band for that matter. If you want to support the artists, go see them in concert, and buy their $30 t-shirts =D"
,Aeri,2009-12-09T05:41Z,"Syndre is correct. Although buying the album supports the artist, with radio time and just general word of mouth. I think breaking Benjamin are just on the verge of no longer needing the support through album sales. Before artists are ""huge"" the money fans spend on albums not only helps them eat, but also upgrade gear and motivation. Currently I make a whopping eight dollars a month from iTunes sales alone, it's not much but it let's me know people enjoy my music. This definitely drives me, as I'm sure other artists would agree, to continue the uphill battle to have our voice heard. It's not all about money.

Cheers;
