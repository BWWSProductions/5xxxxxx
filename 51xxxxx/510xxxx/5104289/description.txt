Storyline: After the events of "Ice Age: The Meltdown", life begins to change for Manny 
and his friends: Scrat is still on the hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn, while finding a possible romance in a female 
sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte. Manny and Ellie, having since become an item, are expecting a baby, which leaves 
Manny anxious to ensure that everything is perfect for when his baby arrives. Diego is fed up with being treated like a 
house-cat and ponders the notion that he is becoming too laid-back. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and so 
steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him, 
while dodging dinosaurs and facing danger left and right, and meeting up with a one-eyed weasel known as Buck who hunts 
dinosaurs intently.
