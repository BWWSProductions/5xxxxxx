        Fraps software was designed to be a universal Windows application
          that can be used with games using DirectX or OpenGL graphic
       technology. In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can
                             best be described as:

       Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you
       are getting in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks
          and measure the frame rate between any two points. Save the
          statistics out to disk and use them for your own reviews and
                                 applications.

        Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a
       key! There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you
       want a new shot. Your screen captures are automatically named and
                                  timestamped.

        Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record
        video while playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima
       revolution! Throw away the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game
        recording has never been this easy! Fraps can capture audio and
       video up to 2560x1600 on dual-core CPUs (1152x864 single-core) at
                          up to 100 frames per second!
