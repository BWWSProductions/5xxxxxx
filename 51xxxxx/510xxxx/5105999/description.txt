Message from band:
The Debut CD for SINSTORM is almost complete, the first three myspace mixes have been posted! It's been a long and exhausting journey, but the focus has been unwavered throughout! We would like to thank Dan Kincaid for his non-stop dedication and determination, mixing, producing and pushing us to achieve a great, brutal and true metal CD! The 5-song Debut will be available very very soon....

As for now,....ENJOY THE BRUTALITY!
