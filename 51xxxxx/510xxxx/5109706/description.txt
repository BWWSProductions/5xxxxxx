All Of Me (Greatest Hits) - Anne Murray [2005]



 â€˜All Of Meâ€™ is a re-release of Anne Murrayâ€™s  album from October 2004 called â€˜I'll Be Seeing Youâ€™ with a second disc of Anne Murray's greatest hits added. The 1st disc finds Murray in excellent form; a smooth collection of standards complete with well-arranged orchestrations that complement her already nearly pitch-perfect voice. The 2nd disc includes some of Murray's finest moments including "Snowbird," "Danny's Song" and "You Needed Me."
