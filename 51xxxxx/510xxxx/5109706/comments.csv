[V],only1joe,2009-11-13T22:56Z,"Im back, 

had to get my brothers internet connection again.

Eircom has blocked access to the piratebay in ireland.

I have been trying to access the site using a proxy, but i was not able to login.
I had my password reset but i still could not log in.

A big thanks to velvetfog who checked out my account by logging in and then been able to tell me my username and password works fine but the problems are all at my end.

So maybe once a week, when my brother is not using his connection i will be able to connect to the piratebay. (*_*)

Thanks for these uploads. Simply Great!
I and a few others have been trying to download  ""Country Croonin' "" from another uploader but we get to 96.3% and sits there. We only need the last 3.5MB. Would you be able to help us out?
If you have this it would be greatly appriciated if you can upload and seed.
Many thanks"
