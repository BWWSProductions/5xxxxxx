Software and crack are legit.

Reader please note this is inferior, in my experience, to
cgsecurity.org's PhotoRec or testdisk.

Both are freeware and better tools.  It took me a few hours to figure this out, so I hope to save you time.

No disrespect to zurera.  That is a purpose for this share to evaluate our options.  This potion is inferior."

http://www.freedatarecoverysoftware.net/ 

It's free, portable with no installation required.  You can put it on your jump drive and run it."
,grammarye,2011-03-01T13:41Z,"I have to agree with largeprime. Ran this software, failed to properly recover the wanted files; ran PhotoRec and got nearly all of my files back!!! "
,grammarye,2011-03-01T13:43Z,"Oh yeah, and AVG Free failed to find any Trojans or otherwise with this program. Translate the instruction text with translate.google.com if you need to. But I'm much happier with PhotoRec :-) (which recovers all sorts of files)"
