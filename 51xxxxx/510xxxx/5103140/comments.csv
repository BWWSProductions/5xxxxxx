It will pick up tomorrow when I bring it into the office with me and give it a good bit of bandwidth to work with.  Hack on!  Check out my blog for more details @ http://www.oddree.com."

Once you have this up and running, you should do the following to speed things up ...

1) Click Devices > Install guest additions.
2) Open up a terminal and run the following ...

sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`

(wait for this to finish, then)

mkdir ~/vb
cd /media/cdrom
cp -R * ~/vb
cd ~/vb
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run

(wait for this to finish, then)

sudo shutdown -r now

After reboot - things will run MUCH FASTER!"
