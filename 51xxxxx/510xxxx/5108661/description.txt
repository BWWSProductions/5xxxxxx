Vic (a young Don Johnson) roams a postapocalyptic wasteland accompanied by his telepathic, ever-grumbling dog, eventually winding up in the clutches of a female-dominated underground society that wants his sperm. This low-budget cult film remains darkly humorous and unflinchingly brutal as its characters face difficult choices -- and the end of the world as they know it.
