So please don't ever stop seeding this... This show is awesome and needs to be available to ppl like me who appreciates good tv shows.

So again, thank you for all the seasons of Punk'd, I greatly appreciate you spending the time in uploading this for us. I will try to keep this on the computer for as long as I can to allow seeding to 5 ratio.

Have an awesome day."
