:::::::::::LOT:::::::::::
On a remote island with a caribean flair, strange
things are happening. Old ruins rise from the
ground (hence, the game's name) and with them,
weird monsters appear. An organisation called
"The Inqusition" has decided to investigate
these events and seized power on the island.
No one is allowed to roam on the land freely
but as a newcomer, washed ashore without
memories, you have no choice...
