Product Description
Virtualization has become a â€œmegatrendâ€â€”and for good reason. Implementing virtualization allows for more efficient utilization of network server capacity, simpler storage administration, reduced energy costs, and better use of corporate capital. In other words: virtualization helps you save money, energy, and space. Not bad, huh?
If youâ€™re thinking about â€œgoing virtualâ€ but have the feeling everyone else in the world understands exactly what that means while youâ€™re still virtually in the dark, take heart.

This fun and friendly guide starts with a detailed overview of exactly what virtualization is and exactly how it works, and then takes you on a tour of the benefits of a virtualized environment, such as added space in overcrowded data centers, lower operations costs through more efficient infrastructure administration, and reduced energy costs through server consolidation.
