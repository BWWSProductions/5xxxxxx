Telethon raises record amounts each year improve the lives of children and young people throughout Western Australia. One of Telethon's main beneficiaries is the Princess Margaret Hospital

Since its inception, Telethon has raised over $87 million and provided much needed financial assistance to a significant number of charitable organisations, children's hospitals and research/medical facilities in Western Australia.

The Trust operates separately from Channel Seven Perth, with a Board of nine Trustees and four full time staff in the Telethon Office.

Telethon and the Trust exist because of the generosity of the Seven Network and Channel Seven Perth. Both provide the Trust with tangible and intangible support through infrastructure facilities, service and professional advice.

The Telethon Weekend live 24-hour charity appeal is held at the Perth Convention Exhibition Centre. It is televised on the Channel 7 Network and on the Golden West Network throughout Regional WA.

Remember, its only through our generorisity that telethon can continually support the medical and social welfare of children and young people and fund research into childrenâ€™s diseases. So give generously!
