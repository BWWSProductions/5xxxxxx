,Hackboy,2009-10-01T04:18Z,Just checked out your history and was wonderin'.....do you ever actually upload any of the files you list or do you just like commin' here cause you think it's cool? None of your files have seeders and appears that you don't upload them to begin with......just sayin'.
,Hackboy,2009-10-12T14:08Z,"You're supposed to upload and continue the connection/upload so others can download the file and then they become seeders.......it's a very simple concept for those who have even a rudimentary understanding of computers and file transfers. (Start the connection--->keep the connection--->you become the 1st seeder) .......Now, try it again or go elsewhere...... "
,Hackboy,2009-10-12T14:14Z,....BTW...answer your questions here....not on someone elses  page......no one knows if you've answered if you don't communicate from here.
