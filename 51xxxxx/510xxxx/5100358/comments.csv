,joeblowman,2009-09-26T00:57Z,"Jews Were The Original Middle East Terrorists

At least two former Israeli prime ministers were members of terrorist organisations - Menachem Begin belonged to the Irgun Zvai Leumi and Yitzhak Shamir the LEHI (better known as the Stern gang). Their outrages included the assassination of Churchill's envoy to the middle east Lord Moyne and the UN mediator on Palestine Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden as well as blowing up the King David hotel with 91 dead. They also killed many British soldiers and policemen until the British mandate in Palestine ended in 1948. The point is neither of these Israeli prime ministers ever apologised or condemned their terrorist actions yet they were welcomed at 10 Downing Street and the White House. And of course Britain and the USA trade with Israel. The media has a selective memory and likes to omit or downplay zionist terrorism. A double standard is at work here."

,joeblowman,2009-09-26T12:33Z,"Rabbi Meir Kahane, told CBS News that his teaching that Arabs are ""dogs"" is derived ""from the Talmud."" (CBS 60 Minutes, ""Kahane"").

University of Jerusalem Prof. Ehud Sprinzak described Kahane and Goldstein's philosophy: ""They believe it's God's will that they commit violence against goyim,"" a Hebrew term for non-Jews. (NY Daily News, Feb. 26, 1994, p. 5).

Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg declared, ""We have to recognize that Jewish blood and the blood of a goy are not the same thing."" (NY Times, June 6, 1989, p.5).

Rabbi Yaacov Perrin said, ""One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail."" (NY Daily News, Feb. 28, 1994, p.6). "
