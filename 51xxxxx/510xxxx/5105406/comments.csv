,OO-VEG,2009-10-01T20:28Z,I think what he did is great! I'm also tired of downloading all those fucking packages. Finally someone who took the initiative! Thanks!

Funny how you trolls don't like to be given free things for free. What do you give yourself?"
,fltsimbloke,2009-10-03T03:05Z,Perfect.  I have always wondered why WOAI doesn't provide this service as well and as they get a new package from time to time then update the mother of all AI downloads.

,FS_Junkie,2009-10-04T07:49Z,"I've used Ultimate Traffic and TrafficX ... WOAI is way better than either, IMHO. It may be handy to have all these packages as one d/l (thanks, anon), but unless you happen to ""fly"" all over the world, I'd say just grabbing what you need for your local area/countries from WOAI may be a better option.

Don't forget .. you need to keep checking WOAI for updated packages!"
,FS_Junkie,2009-10-04T07:51Z,"""NOTE: to use these models and repaints with FSX you must de-activate the 'Aircafts cast shadows' function within FSX.""

Not true ... only do this if using DX10 preview. I *did* have to do that with Ultimate Traffic though (grrrr)."
,mad_flyer,2009-10-14T20:53Z,"Was skAI ever updated past v2.3? I am still using v2.3 and it's terribly outdated, but I've yet to find a substitute for it. If this is any good, I will have to say farewell to skAI. "
,marweiby,2009-10-19T18:51Z,Thanks alot! Saved me for much work! :)
,Bob_Oblaw,2009-11-30T09:38Z,"mad_flyer:  No.  Popeye, or PopTart, or whatever the assholes name was that made it dropped the ball.

Oh, and WOAI fucking sucks.   "

,joostmarseille,2010-03-10T21:05Z,"Planes look great! I have one big sad complaint though... While installing some airliners could not be installed cos of... whatever. My 'homebase' is Schiphol Amsterdam. But theres not a single KLM plane, nor Transavia or others that belong there. I took a peak at Heathrow: all BA, but no Virgin Atlantic... same shit. Its not as complete as I wished it is. I have set my airline density to 100%, but to no avail. Please tell me how to make repair that, or please reconstruct your download!! Great u put it up here in the first place."
,joostmarseille,2010-03-17T02:40Z,Can someone please respond to my last comment...??
,61556155,2010-05-04T15:45Z,"@joostmarseille, 
make sure your airport  afcad files are proper. If you do not have a lot of parking and gate space not so many planes will show up.
I see KLM all over. Nothings wront with the download, dude."
,trapper2012,2010-10-15T21:35Z,is delta connection in this package

,VivaLaGaga,2011-11-23T07:04Z,"Give this guy a break people!! Wouldn't you rather download a torrent that will be done in 5mins and have lots in it, rather than waiting 2hrs for a 38kbps download to finish from simviation.com?? hmm so NEXT TIME YOU SEE FREEWARE ON TPB, DO NOT COMPLAIN COS ITS AWESOME THAT ITS A TORRENT AND NOT SOME STUPID SITE!!!

I say upload as much freeware to TPB as possible... :D"
