Evolution Running DVD Run Faster with Fewer Injuries

Athletes in every sport except running devote enormous attention to perfecting even minute details of the movements they will be required to produce in competition. Running coaches just tell their athletes to run longer and harder. Runners, and their coaches, have basically ignored technique for years, assuming that their natural stride will give them efficiency and injury resistance. We have found that this simply is not the case. For the past decade, African runners have dominated distance running at its highest levels. Research on what makes these runners faster consistently demonstrates normal VO2 Max and lactate threshold levels for elite runners. Their height, weight, and limb-length ratios all fall into the normal category. Clearly and consistently, what sets the great African runners apart is that they are more efficient than their competitors, running faster without expending more energy.

A system for teaching runners efficient and injury-reducing techniques.  Using Coach Ken Mierkeâ€™s system, hundreds of runners have shown dramatic improvement 


Â· Expend less energy to run fast

Â· Begin using your bodyâ€™s natural shock absorption

Â· Distribute running workload optimally to avoid fatigue in any one muscle group

Â· Minimize vertical displacement 

Â· Avoid â€œbrakingâ€ with each step

Â· Utilize elastic recoil for â€œfree speedâ€
