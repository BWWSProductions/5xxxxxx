

Unable to have a child of their own after 10 years of marriage, Do-il (Kim Jin-geun) and Mi-sook (Shim Hye-jin) decide to adopt. But the quietly artistic boy (Moon Woo-bin) they take in would rather spend hours by himself under the acacia tree in the backyard. When Mi-sook discovers she's pregnant, the once-dead tree begins to bloom again -- but things take a sinister turn, and a series of unexplained accidents begins destroying the family unit.
