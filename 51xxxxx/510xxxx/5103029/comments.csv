When I try to view the contents of the burned cd I get a ""drive not found"" error from my file manager program (Total Commander). I tried burning track-at-once and disc-at-once. Same result. I try to view the disk with Windows XP and get a blank file box. So what is the problem? Any one else have similar?"
