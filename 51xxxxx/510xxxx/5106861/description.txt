  From Recorded Books:

 Set in Edwardian England, Howards End is the portrait of a lost era, a deceptively golden time before the First World War that would change values and lifestyles forever. To illuminate these changing times, Forster throws together three vastly dissimilar classes of people: the Schlegelsâ€”Helen and Margaretâ€”educated, compassionate and independently wealthy; the Wilcoxesâ€”nouveau riche Empire builders; and Leonard Bast, an ambitious but struggling bank clerk. As these three groups move in and out of each otherâ€™s worlds, disasters and discoveries ensue.
