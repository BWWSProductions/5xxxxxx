,twoname,2009-09-30T04:50Z,"Well I'm not all that sure what you mean by ""download anything from Fox News"" being that this is The Sean Hannity ""Radio"" Show, but then again I'm not sure you thought it through before you posted your comment. 

Looks like hit and run commentary and not having all the facts must be what you enjoy so I'm not surprised you don't like Fox News. As for me I will keep posting this radio show and watching Fox News because I do like to know facts and make my own fact* based decisions. 

Feel free to keep posting comments that prove your ignorance. Have a blast! 

*  Fact= something that actually exists; reality; truth: Your fears have no basis in fact. "
