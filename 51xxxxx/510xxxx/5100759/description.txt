I picked this up at the Goodwill drop. No, not at a Goodwill store, but from a drop-off, so I got it for free. I had never heard of the band before, but I was pleasently suprised. Being someone that thinks a lot of bands of this type suck, I think this album is a lost gem that needs to be heard. Enjoy!
