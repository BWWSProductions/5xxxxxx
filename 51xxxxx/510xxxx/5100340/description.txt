*****THERE ARE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF SIGNAL LOSS THROUGHOUT THE MATCH*****
A few seconds here, a few seconds there, and one stretch of about 2 minutes in the 2nd half are missing...the audio gains on the video, so I've set several re-synch points throughout to help correct this.
Really, it's not that bad... I just don't want to hear any complaints.
