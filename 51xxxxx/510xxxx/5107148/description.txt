ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Never one to shy away from revealing himself and doing so unconventionally, Kirk Franklin returns to the charts with his strong statement of faith in the conceptual Rebirth of Kirk Franklin. From the deeply personal opening, "Intro," to the ending, "Outro (the Blood)," Franklin takes us on a journey of faith littered with doubt, struggles, and a sincerity that's hard to resist. This mostly live release includes a handful of cameo appearances by the likes of Bishop T.D. Jakes, Yolanda Adams, and Jaci Velasquez. Such a diverse group of guests mirrors the accessibility of Franklin's music on this release. Ably backed by a tight band and the powerhouse Vocals of Life choir, Franklin takes no prisoners on the blistering "Hosana," "Caught Up," and the Rasta-flavored "He Reigns," featuring Papa San. Franklin's songwriting prowess also surfaces in quieter numbers like "Don't Cry" and "Always." Throughout his meteoric career, Franklin has skillfully combined soul, gospel, hip-hop, and pop into a multicolored tapestry. On Rebirth, Franklin's colors have never shown brighter.
