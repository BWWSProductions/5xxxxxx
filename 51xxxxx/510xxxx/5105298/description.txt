Review

Three years ago Suicide Commando released Bind, Torture, Kill onto the unsuspecting masses. Feverously working on his next album, the electronic industrial icon is poised to release his newest single to the delight of his anticipating fans. Die M*********er Die is as aggressive as the title implies. Abrasive beats, acidic synths, and corrosive melodies combined with harsh sneering vocals to create a dangerous mix of anger, hatred, and rage. While the single will appease some of his fans, most will get even more mad that they have to wait a little while longer for the new album.
