A white-collar criminal (GÃ©rald Laroche), an eccentric transsexual (Clovis Cornillac), a cannibalistic idiot savant (Dimitri Rataud) and a cerebral wife-killer (Philippe Laudenbach) share a prison cell, where they find a century-old journal that may hold the key to escaping. Unfortunately, the notebook's discovery unleashes a series of unsettling phenomena within the cell in this spine-tingling French morality fable directed by Eric Valette.
