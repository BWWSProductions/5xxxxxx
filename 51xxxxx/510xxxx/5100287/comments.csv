[T],Quazza,2009-09-29T20:38Z,"No, I don't post the days that he isn't in. If people want me to post the days Glenn isn't there than I will but I just don't because I'm not that interested. Not that the hosts are bad, but Glenn continues from the last things he says...so I don't like going off onto other talking points from someone else...if that makes sense."
