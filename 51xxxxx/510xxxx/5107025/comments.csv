is it iTunes that you're using? Or maybe another programme?"
,jasperjoy,2009-10-03T03:09Z,"Hey Dan,nope,It's WMP I use,still scratching my head over this one,as I mentioned before this has never happened before ! Thanks for the upload anyway mate,these guys are awesome !"
[V],SidewaysDan,2009-10-03T14:32Z,"Strange :/

 All files play fine on iTunes (my default player) so I didn't notice they didn't play on WMP. 

I think it maybe something related to codecs but wmp should have the codecs required :( 

I'm re-instaling WMP to see what happens..."
[V],SidewaysDan,2009-10-03T14:56Z,"Re-installed WMP11 and downloaded the Fraunhofer MPEG-3 (mp3) codec - didn't work :O!

It still works fone with iTunes so I'm really stuck for words... If anyone comes up with a solution, please let us know.

Meanwhile, I'm sorry ,jasperjoy,muzzz07 and others who downloaded files for wasting your time.

If you REALLY want to listen to these, I recommend you use a different player...

Sorry anyways :(

PS: anyone who uses iTunes shouldn't be worried ;)"
