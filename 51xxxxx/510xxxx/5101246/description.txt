2007 release from Punk legend Vic Goddard and a new Subway Sect. Their real debut album originally recorded in 1978, was never released. With interest at an all-time high for these rare recordings, it was discovered that the masters had long since been destroyed. Vic put together a new version of Subway Sect and re-recorded the album with as much intensity as the original sessions.
