[T],ProDvDRipper,2009-10-03T18:46Z,use ur name to register then use the whole serial to register
,gormoth,2009-12-24T23:13Z,"WTF?

I registered yet most of the time it asks me again, but then there is the odd time when it does not.  I have redone the register a few times too but that does not help."
