Five Pointe O was formed in 1999 by vocalist Daniel Struble, guitarist Sharon Grzelinski and bassist Sean Pavey. They then recruited Eric Wood on guitar, Tony Starcevich on drums and Casey Mejia on keyboards. The band self-released two records before their major label debut, in a self-titled four-song EP and a full-length LP The Other Side.

In 2001, they signed with Roadrunner Records and released their debut album Untitled on March 19, 2002. After almost a full year of touring, vocalist Daniel Struble and guitarist Sharon Grzelinski parted ways with the band.[2] Despite the remaining members vowing to continue on, the band later disbanded.

Struble and Grzelinski later formed a new band called The Renaissance, and the other members (excluding Mejia) started another band called The Burning Down. "The Renaissance" no longer exists but "The Burning Down" still regularly plays shows in and around the Joliet area.

In the winter of 2006 Daniel Struble and Sharon Grzelinski started a new band called Zillion with Kyle from The Renaissance.
