some random Systematic songs i just dug up from a really old music backup. i've been trying to find any Systematic anything on torrents for the past few years, and now that i've uncovered this, i figured i'd share with the rest of the fans out there.

really fucking sloppy, i know, but that's apparently how my organization was when i was like, 14 when i burnt the backup. it's the only Systematic torrent (to my knowledge) anywhere, so deal with it and enjoy =)
