,Ryokukitsune,2010-11-13T14:29Z,"i think the patch includes browser hijacks folks. i haven't installed anything in over two months and in the three hours since I dropped this turd on my system i have been hit with the same hijack page over 30 times. 

so far i haven't seen any pro features in this program, it works as google earth but not pro. use caution on this one and just get it from google something doesn't smell rite about this and I'm going to uninstall it."
,enzolish,2010-12-04T04:41Z,So does this have any pro things included at all????
