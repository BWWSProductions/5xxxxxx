,ultrapope,2009-10-03T15:14Z,"AFAIR, there is none or hardly any artifacts in this one. I'm sorry to say I can't remember the source I ripped this from."
,ultrapope,2009-10-03T15:15Z,"... oh, forgot to add that given the age of this thing, you won't notice that it's not in a better resolution unless you have a monitor bigger than 22 inches :)"
