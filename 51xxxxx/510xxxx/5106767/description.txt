Audio and Video, are excellent, from the sample.

Synopsis: Space-time vortexes suck.

Will Ferrell stars as has-been scientist Dr. Rick Marshall, sucked into one and spat back through time. Way back. Now, Marshall has no weapons, few skills and questionable smarts to survive in an alternate universe full of marauding dinosaurs and fantastic creatures from beyond our worldâ€“a place of spectacular sights and super-scaled comedy known as the Land of the Lost.

Sucked alongside him for the adventure are crack-smart research assistant Holly (Anna Friel) and a redneck survivalist (Danny McBride) named Will. Chased by T. rex and stalked by painfully slow reptiles known as Sleestaks, Marshall, Will and Holly must rely on their only allyâ€“a primate called Chaka (Jorma Taccone)â€“to navigate out of the hybrid dimension. Escape from this routine expedition gone awry and theyâ€™re heroes. Get stuck, and theyâ€™ll be permanent refugees in the Land of the Lost.
