When a group of hikers take off for a weekend of fun and adventure in remote mountain region, they unwittingly stumble across the Staunton family â€“ for whom the hill is named â€“ and find themselves at the mercy of a depraved, diabolical brood that will stop at nothing to rid their property of these â€œtrespassers.â€ The only law on Stauntonâ€™s Hill is the law of the Stauntonsâ€¦and, in this case, the penalty for defying that law is death.
