Not much to say ... if you haven't seen this film yet ... What?  Where you living under a rock!?


TRIVIA:
1.  Originally, Arcee was supposed to be in the first film, but the films creators replaced her with Ironhide because they thought the issue of "robot gender" would be hard to explain and couldn't go "unexplained".  When this film rolled out (pun intended), they chose to just ignore the issue.
2.  The film's release date in North American theaters was the 25th Aniversary of the 1984 "Transformers" cartoon series.
3.  John Turturro is not climbing a replica of the pyramids ... he is actually climbing one of the pyramids in Egypt.  In fact, during filming, he broke into tears due to the emotions of acutally being able to walk on a 4000+ year old human monument.
4.  Arcee's "hologram rider" is the model Erin Naas, famous for her work as a model, once dating New England Quarterback Tom Brady, and for being a Deal or No Deal "briefcase" holder.
5.  In Times Square before The Fallen makes his broadcast, you can see executive producer Steven Spielberg's face flash on the large TVs.
6.  The Fallen is the only Transformer in the entire film who doesn't transform ...
