Martian Glyphs, Space Travel, & Energy

Date: 09-17-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Robert Zubrin, George J. Haas, William R. Saunders

During the first half of the program, founding investigator of The Cydonia Institute, George Haas, and geoscientist Bill Saunders discussed their analysis of geoglyphic formations on Mars and how they have correlations to the cultures of Meso-America, such as the Mayans. For instance, analyzing NASA images of the "Face on Mars" from 1976 to a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE shot in 2007, the two have concluded that it's a split-faced structure which resembles a set of temple masks in Mexico.

Other structures in the Cydonia region of Mars, like the D & M Pyramid, have elements that resemble specific gods and characters from the creation mythology of the Mayan and Mesoamerican people, such as recorded in the sacred book, the Popol Vuh, they said. One Martian land form, dubbed the Parrot Formation, was said by a veterinarian specialist to have 18 points of anatomical similarity to the bird, said Saunders, who noted that the parrot was a deity in Mesoamerican mythology.

Hass and Saunders suggested that an ET civilization, such as proposed by Zecharia Sitchin, may have visited both Earth and Mars, and left the large art forms on the Martian surface. Their civilization could conceivably still live underground on Mars, they added. For more, see the related images below.

In the latter half of the show, Dr. Robert Zubrin gave an update on Obama's latest plans for space exploration, NASA, and Mars colonization, and also discussed energy policy. He was critical of the recent Augustine Commission's findings on the amounts of money needed to continue the Bush Moon/Mars Initiative, and suggested they overestimated the costs for items such as the Heavy Lift Vehicle.

Zubrin also spoke about the urgent need to free America of its dependence on foreign oil, via making all cars flex fuel, so they can run on methanol. People can get involved in this effort at setamericafree.org. He also argued that controlled fusion, if properly developed, could solve our energy problems both on Earth and in space.
