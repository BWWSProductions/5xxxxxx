High School. Four of the most important years of your life. But it isnâ€™t always dances and keg parties and sucking face in your parentsâ€™ mini-van. Sometimes itâ€™s ugly and hard and complicated. As complicated as a conspiracy to overthrow the president. Thereâ€™s something rotten at St. Donovanâ€™s High and sophomore newspaper reporter Bobby Funke is on it like pink rubber bands on your little sisterâ€™s braces. When senior hottie Francesca Facchini solicits Funkeâ€™s help tracking down a set of stolen SATs, Funke uncovers a story dirtier than the lunch ladyâ€™s mustache. After he fingers the school president (figuratively) for the crime, Funke becomes one of the most popular kids at St. Donovanâ€™s High.
