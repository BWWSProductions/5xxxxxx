Go Canada!

Format AVI
Media Player used for testing: VLC Worked great
Picture:7.5/10(its a cam and the red url loses .5)
Audio:6.5/10(not bad but not great)

[T],n2kmaster,2009-10-02T05:21Z,"No im not a god, Im the N2KMaster. Theres a lot of folks out there that think im all talk and no show. So i released the first two torrents of this anywhere on the net, cuz im a fan of the site and I fly the pirate flag. I believe this definately deserves a t-shirt from the bay!"
,bicdell,2009-10-02T07:34Z,thanks man!  can't wait to watch this ;)
[T],n2kmaster,2009-10-02T10:17Z,"Fixed the listing errors as well now they are posted as what version they are, the VCD ISO version, MP4 PSP versions with my name on them are legit as well. Working on a cleaned up version as we speak, will definately upload later"
,edaxrerum,2009-10-05T05:47Z,"wow, yeah youre a superhero buddy.

very first frame -- 'download the original high res version at insertshittywebsitehere.com'. this is great, because what your off-center, tilted to the left cam needed was to be grainier.

pretty sure you have some offs to fuck. A real pirate will be along to take over for you shortly."
,topinfo333,2009-10-05T08:53Z,You should be slapped for defacing such a legendary movie with your spam THRU THE WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE. I loved the part where I was looking at the back of the guys head too...oh yeah that was the whole movie too. Do it right before you start giving your self props asshole. I'll just wait until some one does it right.
,topinfo333,2009-10-05T08:55Z,"P.S. I made this account just to tell you how much of an asshole you are, thats how much you pissed me off."
,TheSickChild,2009-10-06T23:16Z,"Don't care if it's good quality or not, I just really want to see this movie. Not playing in our area for some dumbass reason, so, hats off to you!"

topinfo333 so suck my ass ding dong, meaning you make an account just to tell some one off yet you downloaded it you leech and seeded nothing, and if you notice to all to the idiots who wanna whine, as for defacing a movie, lick my balls i made a cleaned up version for the complainers, as for the watermark, you should read where and how that showed up, noob, you know nothing about anything dealing with torrents obviously, oh yeah by the since its such a crappy movie blah blah blah go check http://n2k.directvideo.tv that map was clean before i posted this movie, and im getting props everywhere else, go google my name dicks, you have no idea what you are up against. LOTS OF MOUTHS, YET NONE OF YOU HAVE A COPY TO POST YET! Not to mention the first 3 versions to surface plus 5+6 were mine and also they were cleaned up, now as for you telling me off about taping it pal, there are 3 people involved in making sure you idiots got a copy, and yet you still whine like some little 3 year old bitch, go whine to someone who cares, i dont hear anyone call topinfo333 a god except his father in bed."
[T],n2kmaster,2009-10-06T23:42Z,"and personally if you've got such a problem topinfo333 about it where's your copy? Got the traffic tracking and stats to prove its a copy out before mine and cleaner? Doubtful, I can't wait for the taper to get out of jail on this and tell him your little comment. Trust me Officers dicklock and Cockknuckles were chasing this all over the internet to get it pulled, and mine was the only that didnt get pulled. Be thankful, if it wasnt for me, you wouldnt have seen it at all for almost a year. There is no guys head in the video dunno wtf hes talking about there, go look up the cleaned up version, that ding dong knows nothing"
[T],n2kmaster,2009-10-06T23:45Z,"edaxrerum = 0 torrents
topinfo333 = 0 torrents, identified himself as just a leecher

0 contributions, you people do the math."
,Lucky13s,2009-10-08T01:09Z,"Thanks for the movie, however I deleted it after the first minute or so. Im a pretty big fan and I dont wanna ruin this movie by watching cam quality, I'm just gonna wait for a xvid or dvdrip, but props providing the movie anyways."
[T],n2kmaster,2009-10-09T21:54Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5110184/Trailer_Park_Boys_2_N2KMaster_Re-Workz_SOUND-FIXED Thats the version you'll want, people said here it looks like a dvd rip, i dont think so, i would give it a vcr/tv rip at best, this cam version is outdated now go grab my new version."
,LarryH,2009-10-10T06:36Z,"TOTAL CRAP - SPAM SLAM
Video quality is shit and blasts you with SPAM"
,Kazperjester,2009-11-02T00:01Z,I don't know why people are complain no one is paying to download this file and the movie just came out so quit your bitching and get over yourselves.
,^56^Animal,2009-11-03T07:08Z,"Thanx man, your work is appreciated. Have a good Liquor Day :)"
,cartier8,2009-11-28T19:00Z,"thanks for the torrent,great speed got it in 10 minutes, the best copy on the net yet"
