I bought this DVD when it first came out but, it's now out of print & become very difficult to find. I don't believe you should have to pay a ridiculous amount to get a second hand version of it so, here it is. I hope you give it a chance & enjoy it as much as I do :)

Taken from the back of the case...

"Thomas Jane (Boogie Nights, Face/Off), Aaron Eckhart (Nurse Betty, Erin Brockovich), Supermodel Paulina Porizkova (Wedding Bell Blues, Her Alibi), and James Le Gros star in a no-holds-barred, erotically charged, thriller that packs a lifetime's worth of action into one day. 

Casey Wells (Jane), a former shakedown artist from the mean streets of L.A., has gone straight--or so he thought. When his ex-partner-in-crime (Eckhart) appears one day with a mysterious suitcase, Casey's comfortable suburban life is turned upside down. Suddenly murderous drug dealers, a gorgeous, sexually voracious brunette (Porizkova), and crooked cops are trying to kill him. 

If Casey lives, he may wind up with hidden millions his old pal stole in a drug scam. But if he wants to survive until Friday, Casey's going to have to revert to his old lethal habits."
