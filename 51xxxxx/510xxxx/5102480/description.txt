In this brutal, bloody shocker that's invited comparison to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Straw Dogs, struggling singer Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas) is working the wedding circuit in Belgium when his car breaks down in the sticks. He's taken in by a kindly innkeeper (Jackie Berroyer) who, at first, seems eager to please but later reveals himself to be a psychopath. Fabrice Du Welz directs this haunting thriller with a tinge of dark humor.
