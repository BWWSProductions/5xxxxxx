I know you are  false flag operative"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-09-29T06:31Z,Aldin dipshit. My last torrent exposes an Israeli Mossad false flag in Montreal. Funny that your Zionist shill leader Alex Jones says nothing about this false flag. Who is the operative now?

A Ha! I flushed you out - AJ has taught me well.  I can spot a double/triple ice cream cone fact twister like you.  Your explanation shows your nwo reptilian mind.  YOU SIR A False Flag!
I won't take your g-d vaccine (NY Mandatory for all health care workers).  And - OK city bombing tapes are edited.  Take some silver to cure your syphlitic brain.  Hopefully, you will stop drinking fluoride and eating gmo's.  WAKE UP!!  Alex Jones always tells us to copy and pass along his work.  A Texan Prophet for the Endgame.  TT = FF OP"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-09-29T07:47Z,"I agree about the vaccines, the Vaccines are full of mercury and squalene. Alex wasnt the first to discover this. Do you honestly believe everyone who doesnt believe Alex Jones is God, is an NWO operative?"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-09-29T07:49Z,"And no, you havent flushed anyone out. You have only shown yourself to be one who cannot think for yourself. You look to leaders to lead you. Alex Jones will not save you from the NWO. Free your mind. Israeli Mossad conducts most serious false flags. Israel was behind 911, the Oklahoma City Bombings, 7/7, and many others. Now who does Alex Jones say does the False Flags? He blames the Bilderberbers for everything under the sun. The fucking Bilderbergers! They are not at the top. The Bilderbergers are subservient to the JEWISH-run Illuminati, The Illuminati was started by a Jew, Adam Weishaupt, and Jews carried out Illuminist Revolutions in France, Russia, and all of Europe.
You sir, need to get educated."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-09-29T07:54Z,"Sig, see what kind of effect Alex Jones has on people? This is very disturbing bro. Cognitive dissonance. Brainwashing, and decisional dissonance.

Aladin is one poor pathetic dupe."

I disagree with your assessment of Tail_Mud_Tiny as a reptilian.  I suspect his family tree had or currently contains primates, possibly the same African green monkeys also used for H1N1 vaccines and known to carry aids virus.  However, his explosive mental diarrhea does seem to confirm  your syphilitic diagnosis.  

Tiny, your uploads are really da BOMBASS!!  (Alex Jones Admits His Wife is a Polish Jew)  Why don't you disclose your own family tree right here?  Should be interesting."
[T],sig_garrett,2009-09-30T10:54Z,"It appears there was common ground regarding the Vaccine issue. That's a good thing.

I bet there is more common ground to be found if we, together with a little effort on all sides, rise above the divide and conquer battle arena. That is my hope - to rise above name calling, finger pointing and bickering that only serves the darkness of manking. I have my blemishes. We all do. But I urge everyone to consider with deep contemplation that this is a an ancient spiritual battle we find ourselves grappling with.

That said we, in various ways, are admonished to examine our relationship to the issues and, to the best of our ability, examine with intellectual honesty the facts as we understand them and guard against outright rejection of information as it is presented or bestowed upon us. 

We have a long ways to go and the road ahead, as with much of history as it is re-presented, is riddled with deception, tricks and slight of hand.

We're here - now - together. These moments. It's truly amazing. Let's work on the common the ground. "
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-10-03T05:35Z,"Sure, but just because there is a tad of common ground doesn't mean I am going to lower my guard so that I am brainwashed along with ya."
[T],sig_garrett,2009-10-03T14:03Z,"Timmy,

Good news - there's agreement we have some common ground.

Better news - I haven't asked you to let your guard down. I prefer you don't as diversity of opinion is one of the great gifts of Free Speech and freedom of thought which, unfortunately, is dwindling by the minute.

Here's even better news - you're still here and still add to the overall engagement and experience. I wonder if there isn't a love-hate thing going on(?) Hmmm. :)

As for brainwashing, that's a bit presumptuous and probably best directed at the masses of gum chewin' TV hive mind chattel property who continue to expect something-for-nothing alms and tithes to be bestowed by genocidal globalist eleemosynary trust fund money changing deceivers who have no benevolent intention - regardless however, and I believe this is key, Greed and Deception comes in all colors and creeds, from all backgrounds and persuasion.

To put it in another context: historically it is easy to point the finger at those who may openly exploit the masses' greed or the masses' general laziness for Control - but it's not so easy to point the finger at those who have given up their freedoms For Greed or because of their own sloth. This would include giving up the ability to think for oneself, or as you might articulate, allowing oneself to be""brainwashed"".

In light of that, I'm not sure if this is the best forum to claim brainwashing is status quo or the norm. Think about it. Your statements would be better served, and probably more productive, if directed at the establishment's alphabet stations or directed at their hand servants and mass followings. Try CBS, NBC, FOX, MSNBC, CNN, ABC... Olbermann, Beck, Anderson, Williams, Limbaugh, Blitzer, etc. 

That's where your claim of brainwashing would be best submitted and charged.
