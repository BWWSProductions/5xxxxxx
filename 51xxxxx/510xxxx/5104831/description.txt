Paul Simon's first solo album. This contains most of the songs from his and Garfunkel's ground-breaking album "Sounds of Silence" but in their original form with just Paul performing by himself. 

They were relesed after S and G's first album "Wednesday Morning, 3 AM" flopped, even though it had the best acoustic ballad of all time. Paul went it alone in England with this Dylan-esque lament of the soulful Christian in the world of the neon satan. All your favorites in their naked form.

Paul Simon is a great and poetic performer.
