,ironicus,2009-09-29T09:50Z,Anyone else having problems playing this?
,fredfan,2009-10-31T15:31Z,"Yes, ironicus, I couldn't get it to play on my DVD player either for a while.  & that puppy'll play anything, usually.  Finally I tried mashing and holding the ""top menu"" button on the PLAYER rather than the one on the remote, and the menu came up.  Haven't watched it yet, but it seems to play normally and look good when I test it.  If you don't see any more from me here, it went okay.  Too bad about the initial weirdness, though."
