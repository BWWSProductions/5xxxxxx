1950s Hollywood has big glamour, small talk, and medium cool. The most powerful woman in town is Paige Turner, the celebrity columnist for America's most-read newspaper. When a salacious tabloid mentality creeps onto newsstands, Paige goes toe-to-toe with Harry Richards, "The Tabloid Dick." Their war of words becomes a knockdown, drag-out fight to be the biggest rumormonger in entertainment!

Written by J. Torres and illustrated by Scott Chantler.
