My library has it and I was thinking of scanning it so I can distribute it but I see someone has done so already (I live in a third world country where whole books are copied always).  Thank you.  I'll support this torrent."

This is the FIRST printing of the 6th edition! This is the one with 80+ pages of corrections. There are now FIVE printings since the first in 2009. Use this at your own risk. Not worth it for me."
