OLIVER TWIST by Charles Dickens.

Dickens' second novel, the book was originally published as a serial, in monthly instalments that began in February 1837 and continued until April 1839.

Oliver Twist is the first novel in the English language to centre throughout on a child protagonist and is also notable for Dickens' unromantic portrayal of criminals and their sordid lives.

A mysterious pregnant woman is found lying in the street, and dies a few moments after giving birth to a son. The boy, Oliver Twist lives a life of poverty and misfortune in a workhouse. At the age of Nine, he escapes from the workhouse, only to find that greater dangers lurk outside.
