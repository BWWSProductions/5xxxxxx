Afternoon Play: The Last Tsar 28-08-2009

Ian Curteis's drama examines an enduring mystery of the First World War - the apparent refusal of King George V to give sanctuary in England to his cousin Tsar Nicholas and his young family after the Tsar had been forced to abdicate following the Russian Revolution.



From The Radio Times

They look alike as the proverbial peas - George V and his beloved cousin Tsar Nicholas II. But is blue blood thicker than water? Ian Curteis's intimate play of politics and sentiment asks just that difficult question. It is 1917 and there is revolution in Russia and the whole world is at war. Lloyd George offers to give the deposed Romanovs sanctuary, but the king (played with subtle bluffness by Derek Jacobi) can't decide. Of course, his heart tells him to rescue his cousins but, as we know, that wasn't to be. Why not? With a proven track record of dramatising history (BBC4's The Falklands Play), Curteis has a sublime touch that humanises the rough, royal old salt, even slipping in a sly nudge of humour for the listener. "Someday, I'd like to say something memorable about Bognor." He did.
