As the late 1980s gradually segued into the early 1990s, the choices of material and the production values Reba McEntire brought to her recordings often seemed to be guided as much by right-brained market savvy as by true left-brain inspiration. This "hits" compilation skims the cream of her commercial achievements during this prolific period in her career. Though there are only 10 tracks, these include landmark No. 1 singles like "You Lie," "Fancy," "Is There Life out There," and "Does He Love You," a heartfelt duet with Linda Davis. ~ Bob Allen 

Although this album could have had more songs on it (especially from the 1988 "Reba" album), this is a true Greatest Hits classic. With new songs such as "Does He Love You" and "They Asked About You", this package goes to show the new and upcoming country stars that Reba has been doing this since they were in diapers and she will continue to sing and outsell them for decades to come. ~ A Customer, Amazon

Reba McEntire is a legend. She has a true talent for choosing songs that speak to the listener. She's never, to my knowledge, had to remove her foot from her mouth or lost CD sales for being an idiot. She's true to country and true to good old-fashioned American values. This CD is excellent. There isn't a bad song on it. It's solid and true . . . just like Reba! ~ Country Girl
