,NitLions,2011-04-23T19:20Z,"I got the crazy chipmunk sound on this one too, very weird. Just watched episode 2 from ez right before this so I don't think I need to update anything. "
,NitLions,2011-04-23T21:22Z,"Just played it using Boxee and it worked fine. Boxee is the greatest program ever!! Every time quicktime can't play a file, I just drag it onto Boxee and it opens up and plays it just fine. Its the perfect backup plan in case some of these files are weird, which they are here and there. Went from super fast sound to regular no problem"
