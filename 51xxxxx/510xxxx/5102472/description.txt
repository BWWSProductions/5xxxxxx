Confined to a wheelchair, 22-year-old Yasu (Hirohito Honda) ends up trapped in -- you guessed it -- a living hell after his family takes in a spooky old woman and her mute granddaughter, who harbor a dark past. Sensing something is amiss, Yasu sees his worst fears realized when he's left alone with the duo, who subject him to an escalating campaign of abuse and torture. But there's more to the story than meets the eye in this gory horror flick
