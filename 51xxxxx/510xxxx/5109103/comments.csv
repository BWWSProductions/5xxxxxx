,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2009-10-04T01:42Z,"Almost Complete, just missing the song ""Mind over time"" which was a bonus track that you got for pre-ordering it from iTunes. It is a far better song than ""the Lighthouse"" & i cant understand how it didnt make it on to the record? Anyway, This is a GREAT band & well worth spending the money on buying the Original Cd's after listening to this.  "
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2009-10-04T01:54Z,"Pre-ordering ""O.L.T.A"" album from iTunes which is what i meant to say...
