Before Live on Broadway, before Live at the Met and before Eddie Murphy was Delirious and Raw there was Live and Uncensored! It is impossible not to laugh out loud at this extremely enjoyable, fast-paced barrage of Robin Williams live at the Great American Music Hall, San Francisco. His zany, off-the-wall humor never ceases to amaze as he yells, skips and swears his way through a series of crazy characters and improvisations that reflect that indelible William's hysteria.
