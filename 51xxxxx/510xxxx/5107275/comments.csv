,it1234,2009-10-03T04:21Z,I just wanna take a little time and say how grateful that I am for having these downloads available each week... I am at school every Thursday so I miss every ASOT :(  These torrents are amazing! the fact that you have each track seperate rather than 1 whole track of the show is awsome. TY Captim!!
[T],SephirothVsCloudo,2009-10-03T09:55Z,thanks
[T],captim,2009-10-03T12:32Z,"Yeah, very funny episode! I realized really late whats going on there. Normally other DJ are just speaking when introducin their song. But even a guy like Armin needs vacation! But Andy Moore and John O'Callaghan did a great job. BTW thanks for your appreciation!"
