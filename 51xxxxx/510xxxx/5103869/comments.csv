,pystdante,2009-10-11T04:17Z,"This game is awesome, I was not too sure about it until I put in over 5 hours, It is pretty hard playing on Heroic until you find the towns and pick a side to be on. I don't know about playing it while connected to LIVE, I dont want to take the chance to get my console banned. It also has some very slow loading times even after installing to HD, but it works fine on my NTSC system. Thanks alot GamerGuy!"

,michan1234,2009-10-13T04:05Z,screens for this look quite allright...a little worse than fable2...i heard theres a problem with reading menu item descriptions(fuzzy blurry)????!!??CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM??
,pystdante,2009-10-15T23:50Z,"@ michan1234 It is a little fuzzy, I play on a 37inch lcd and I have to sit about 5 feet away to see how much gold i am finding in chests, corpses, etc.

@ speedyforce Sometimes abgx doesnt get the stealth until the game is out in all regions, I just unplug my box when playin non stealth games"
