,tauffen,2009-10-06T23:16Z,"What exactly means ""share an account""?"
[V],polifem2009,2009-10-07T14:08Z,"ok, I managed to get back, let's see what we'll be working on"
,tauffen,2009-10-07T18:59Z,"Hey, polifem! If by share an account you mean just use my account to manage your action here, you can count on me."
,eus2,2009-10-09T13:19Z,"Good you are back polifem. 
I'am constantly uploading 40 to 50 of your older uploads. Although the speeds gets very low, at least people get the chance to finish their dowload.

I have now a couple of downloads myself that i have been trying to finish for months:
Notorious concubines is stuck at 99.5% any possibility of reupping that one?
There is an IP adres 76.11.0.97 that has 100% 0f Kokoro, cycling cronicles, showa 2 , brutal tales 3 but never uploads. kokoro is stuck at 86%, cc at 69,4%, BT3 at 98,6%,S2 at 97,3% any chance to reup those for a while & does anyone know who 76.11.0.97 is and can talk to him. It's frustrating to receive the impression you can finish a download, if you never can.

,blacknero,2009-10-14T05:35Z,"@polifem2009:
Is it possible for you to seed the movie ""Kokoro""? I and a few others are stuck at 86%."
[V],polifem2009,2009-10-21T19:55Z,"sorry guys (and dolls) I'm having some very strange computer problems - I don't seem to be able to find a dvdrom that works with it, so, for the moment there's not much that I can do. as soon as this situation is fixed I'll be back 'cause there still is a lot to be done."
,Haxedin,2009-10-22T20:14Z,"I hope Your problems will soon be over polifem2009. You are doing a great job with all those japanese films. By the way, could You seed ""Inn of Evil"" again? All downloaders are stuck at 65,6%."
