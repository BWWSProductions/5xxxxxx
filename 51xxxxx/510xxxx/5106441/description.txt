Ronnie Reno (Klein) is a former TV action hero in dire need of a comeback. On his way back from a failed audition he winds up snowbound in a remote Nevada town run by scary meth dealers, including Merle (Busey), and their henchman (Durst). When he finds the body of a dead FBI agent there, life imitates Reno's art as he is forced to reunite with his former co-stars, including Devon (Beach), to save himself and the terrorized townsfolk.
