,thebastard91,2009-11-22T19:24Z,"Quick tip, if you run Vista and have a previous version of Winamp installed, it will repeatedly bring up the message ""Winamp has stopped working"" when trying to run the Winamp Pro installer. Uninstalling Winamp and deleting the remaining files solved the problem, and let me install without further interruptions. Just a heads up in case anyone else runs into this problem. Thanks for uploading this, grim!"
