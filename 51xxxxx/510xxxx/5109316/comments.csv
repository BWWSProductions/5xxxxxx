,DarkSpirit4Ever,2009-10-04T12:58Z,I just downloaded (800 kbs) - installed - updated. Everything works. Great upload - Thanks Mate! 
,DarkSpirit4Ever,2009-10-04T13:00Z,btw - I'll be seeding my ass off! 
,DarkSpirit4Ever,2009-10-04T15:10Z," - I'm still seeding - However - When updating from the Ashampoo menu, it tells that an upgrade is available - OK - I ran the update, but have to say that Ashampoo 2010 ""upgrades"" to Ashampoo 2009???  Any thoughts?? Still seeding though ;-) "
[V],nightissuchproximity,2009-10-04T16:00Z,"Hi.   Yes.

Do not take that ""upgrade""

Your installed version has been detected as a pirate copy and you are trying to be  persuaded to ""downgrade""

It is an attempt to make you remove a working copy for a non-working copy.

Leave well alone and the copy you have will work just fine.

I've tested the ""upgrade"" you are querying and after the download and install this app will cease to function.

What you have from my upload  will serve you well.

,DarkSpirit4Ever,2009-10-04T19:02Z,"- Hi Buddy - thats OK - it's very clear that the ""upgrade"" should be!
BTW: Your uploade runs like a charm! - Thanks again - Still seeding! ;-) "
,Enigma_x,2009-10-11T15:00Z,"Hi!  I have been thinking about downloading this program, it looks good.   Can you give specific examples of video files it can convert into a DVD.  Especially WMA? AVI? MP4?.  I'm novice, so any clarity would be very helpful, thankyou."
,Enigma_x,2009-10-12T17:11Z,"I downloaded this program, and everything workded fine.  However, the movie editor and slideshow editor did not seem to be included.  Do I need Ashampoo studio burner 9 first and then upgrade to this program?  Or have I missed something?  Any help would be appreciated, thank you."
,xhimi,2009-10-24T13:46Z,"HI GREAT,CLEAN. BUT FOR ME IS BETTER 9. HOWEVER THNX UPLOADER."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2009-10-24T14:56Z,"No problem.   Fair enough.   You tried it and don't like it.   This will uninstall no problem...I tested it for the uninstall three times before I uploaded this.   Just revert back to your favourite copy of Ashampoo Burning Studio.   Cheers, bro.

Regards nightissuchproximity"

You are correct.   The download is free.   You obviously did not test that download.   It will install a trial version and offer you the opportunity to obtain a free licence key that will extend the trial version for a period of thirty days.
   Why do you think I included a valid serial number with my upload?   Even if your facts were correct (and they are not, they are Apocryphal), then my upload would still be better than any of your uploads....'cause you have never performed an upload of anything.
   And no one is lickin' my arse; they are all too busy laughing at you and trying to fathom how you managed to achieve the status of Dickhead to such a high level of masterfulness.
   Anything else?"
,swampownr1,2009-12-03T08:08Z,Much appreciated!

,MasterCronodox,2010-03-18T04:59Z,does this version copy movies to dvd so they can play on all dvd players or no please respond

Your query deserves an answer; here it is:

You want ConvertXtoDVD

You can find it on TPB

Most of us here probably use that particular software application.

Hope that helps.   Good luck. "
