,Bkid001,2010-04-21T05:26Z,"Sorry it took so long to reply. I'm not sure why the comics aren't working properly. You're starting the siterip with the Start.htm file, right? I can access the comics fine using Firefox. The only problem is that I have to use the Next and Back buttons to navigate, since the dropdown box does not work (forgot to fix it).

Try it in Firefox and see if that helps."
