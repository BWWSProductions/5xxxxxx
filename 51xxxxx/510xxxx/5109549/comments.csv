,Shade_Michael,2009-11-06T03:37Z,"on all your programs you have long copied and pasted info letters, and all sorts of stuff, but what you should really have, is installation directions for those who dont use cracks that often.
personaly, ive uced them before, but always forget the process. you have such lengthy info's why can you not add some installation stuff in as well?"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-06T22:09Z,"@Shade_Michael 

Installation info don't belong in a torrent description. However, if  you would've read the included Readme!.text files in my torrents you would've noticed that they contain detailed installation notes. "
,skullguy69,2009-11-07T18:38Z,"ok , I am a newbie to this site and I saw your dvd converter and thought I would try it.

I downloaded it and it is in a RAR format. How do I use this?

I didnt see any help files when I downloaded it, so I am stumped.

Can you please help?

Thanks"
