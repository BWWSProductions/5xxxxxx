,atimirage,2009-12-19T00:34Z,Stuck at 65%. I'd be really thankful if someone could seed & would do the same afterwards.
,COL_Zos,2010-07-07T10:44Z,"Same here, stuck at 73% as many others and waiting for some kind seed to provide us the rest of such an splendid masterwork. Thanks in advance!"
,COL_Zos,2010-07-13T04:58Z,And now about 6-8 people stuck at 99%! (no kidding) for 3 days already. Some seed for God\'s sake! :__D
