Intensely grotesque and shocking as hell, Feed is a heavyweight thrill ride through the depths of depravity. A veteran of cyberporn investigations, Australian cop Philip Jackson is no stranger to the dangerous side of sexual fetishes. He may have found his sickest case yet when he discovers a sinister side to an American website devoted to fat-admiring men and obese women called "feeders" and "gainers." Could the man behind it all be force-feeding missing women to death? Tense, dark and deeply disturbing, director Brett Leonard (The Lawnmower Man, Virtuosity) takes the crime-thriller genre to a twisted, gut-wrenching new level.
