This is just a password dump I stumbled across. Good chance they'll work on their respective email domains, PayPal, Facebook, etc. People are dumb, and don't use different passwords. One site gets compromised, their entire network is compromised.

You are going to use these passwords at your own risk; they work, but should you decide to log onto them, it is your own choice.






Have fun, but please keep your actions legal and safe.

@STJ11: write a script to log them in; probably other people have changed their passwords.
