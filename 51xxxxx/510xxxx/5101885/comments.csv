,longtan,2009-09-27T15:32Z,thanks merzedes
,tenenbaum,2009-09-28T10:18Z,Many thank Merzedes. It seems this one is being uploaded approximately 16 minutes short? It cuts off mid scene at the end. It appears everyone on the net is uploading this version... I don't suppose there is anything you can do? No worries if so - just thought I'd ask. :)

,tenenbaum,2009-09-30T00:45Z,No probs at all. Cheers anyway. :) Looking at the K1nk site there also seems to be a glitch with the latest SAS Marie McCray shoot... Screwy week.
