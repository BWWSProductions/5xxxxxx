The songs themselves are not terrible, most are simple, pretty tunes written by comedian Steve Allen. Allen was a big fan of Baker, he had him on his variety show several times in the 60's. This was his way of helping Chet get his career started again. This recording inexplicably keeps getting re-issued on CD. The CD versions rename the tracks, and they are remixed at a lower speed (actually, I think this was a correction, as it sounds more natural than the LP versions). ~ chetbakertribute.com
