Glenn Beck Program for September 29th 2009




I don't post the days that Glenn isn't in.

If people want me to post the days Glenn isn't there then I will...but I just don't because I'm not that interested.


Not that the hosts are bad, but Glenn continues from the last things he says on the day before...so I don't like going off onto other talking points from someone else...if that makes sense. 

Either way just leave a comment about it if you want posts from sub-hosts.
