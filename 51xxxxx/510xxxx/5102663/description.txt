Toca - Fragma [2001]
	

Amazon.co.uk Review - Judging by the style of their debut album, Fragma appear to be treading the same route as Dario G, Robert Miles, Alice Deejay and the Vengaboys. Establish your reputation with a cutting-edge but memorable dance track ("Toca's Miracle"), and then guaranteeing future chart success by recruiting female session singers to perform catchy Euro-pop compositions ("Everytime You Need Me"). This method may not guarantee longevity, or demonstrate avant-garde creativity but it certainly generates the cash. Drawing on the pop-pulling power of session artistes Damae, Coco, Maria Rubia, Eva Martinez the album contains plenty "Everytime You Need Me" type songs. "Reach Out" and "Magic" are healthy top 10 league singles which are pleasantly catchy, and are guaranteed club floor fillers from Inverness to Ibiza. "You Are Alive" and "Move On" provide a surprise, darker edge to the album, mixing early-eighties electro-pop similar in the style of Visage with more contemporary trance sounds. Sophisticated Euro-pop at its best.
