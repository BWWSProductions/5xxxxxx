With the Lockerbie bombing once again in the news, another chance to hear Peter Goodchild's dramatised reconstruction of the extraordinary story of one of the longest, costliest and most complicated trials in legal history.

Few would have predicted the verdict in February 2001, when Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi was convicted and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah acquitted of blowing up Pam Am flight 103. The prosecution are sure they have got their men, but a succession of witnesses who prove to be CIA double agents, convicted terrorists and arms dealers with shady histories begin to undermine a case which is skilfully and passionately contested by the defence.

Presented by Sheena MacDonald.

With Ian McDiarmid, Denis Lawson and Hugh Fraser.
