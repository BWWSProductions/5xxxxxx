PLOT: Akiko the music instructor of St. Cecilia Academy found the demonic violin "Cannone" sealed away in the torture room under the chapel. He was fascinated and overtaken by it's powers. He soon took to using "Cannone" on the unsuspecting female music students who enrolled in his special program. These attractive young girls were expecting to master their skills with the violin, but soon discovered that the demon dwelling within Cannone wished to master them and enslave them to evil.

Their only hope is that Yukina will be strong enough to break free from the clutches of Cannone and talented enough to wield the holly violin "Ceillia"; the violin was created by angels as a the only weapon against the demon Cannone.
