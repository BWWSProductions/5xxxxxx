-> Blacklisted! Uploading New Keys Now! 


Please REMOVE your old Torrents when you have added new ones!

That way there won't be so many OLD Hits when one searches for 'kaspersky' !

Thanx in Advance!

(And also; since you have other old ones with keys that are blacklisted, just kill'em all!)

:-)

This is NOT a Windows Help Forum!

Go to Google and Search for a Such in your own language, and get help with common Windows question THERE - and NOT here!

Thanx!
