After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
         
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	         
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	         
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce         
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce         
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce         
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce         
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce         
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.
__________________________

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

What follows is the merge of 4 different torrents, just to minimize, with the few bandwidth I have, the numbers of torrents I have to manage...
Also I see that bigger torrents have longer life and more seeders in the average

MICHAEL GULEZIAN

Michael Gulezian is an american composer and fingerstyle guitarist. 
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gulezian  
http://www.timbrelinemusic.com/

He is noted for dramatic compositions, a penchant for manipulating metre, an affinity for extreme open tunings, and an unconventionally free two-handed technical approach. Gulezian's use of bottleneck slide on 12-string guitar, coupled with his command of reverse analog reverbs have made his recordings notable for their dream-like sonic atmosphere. Gulezian inhabits a musical territory between his mentor John Fahey, and his friend and colleague Michael Hedges.

What follows is a collection of some of his albums... Enjoy...

LAURENCE JUBER

Laurence Juber is an english guitarist (with a past as lead guitarist in McCartney's Wings). 
  
http://www.laurencejuber.com/

He's a master of acoustic finger style, but with less of the trick-guitar mishmash that seems obligatory among the high-octane pickers. He has a fluid style that shifts gears through simultaneous jazzy chording, leads, and bass lines, while weaving in and out of musical thoughts faster than a Formula One racer...

What follows is a collection of some of his albums.

ISATO NAKAGAWA

Isato Nakagawa is a japanese guitarist.
There's no official site available in western languages as far as I can see, so little I can say about his musical career...

He makes a great use of open tunings and percussive techniques.

I associate his music to the japanese concept of "shibumi": a not glaring beauty, founded on the essence of shapes, hues and materials. It's a subtle balance obtained through a search for simplicity, without useless ornamentation. They say you cant learn shibumi: you got to find it in yourself: it's a path where Nakagawa has threaded far...

It would be nice if some japanese friends would provide more albums of this marvelous artist with a western transliteration of the titles (a friend of mine did this for the album "Footprints"). It's sad that such an artist would remain hidden because of an alphabet difference. 


What follows is a collection of some of his albums.
