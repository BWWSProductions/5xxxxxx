Othello
by William Shakespeare



A great production of Othello, and Art Malik is one of the greatest Iagos I've ever heard. From Sue Arnold in The Guardian: "There was no mistaking the unplumbable depths of evil in Malik's voice, especially in those chillingly sinister asides. Maybe it was the contrast between the voices of Iago and Othello, played by Hugh Quarshie, that made this such a memorable production. Get that right and everything else falls into place."
