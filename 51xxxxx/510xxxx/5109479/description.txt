THE LAST SUTRAS OF PYTHAGORAS ON PERFECTION.... The first thing to be remembered: that perfection is not a goal. No enlightened person has ever been goal-oriented; he cannot be.

The enlightened person lives in no-mind. No-mind is enlightenment. Hence, the enlightened one cannot be goal-oriented; he has no future, for him all is present. And that's why he's continuously misunderstood. He talks of the present but people hear him through their minds, and minds immediately distort. Minds immediately change it into a goal, into some idea that has to be achieved in the future...
