Cursed tells the story of Shan Beaumont, a woman with a secret. She is cursed with the ability to see visions of horrific events and she uses that ability to help her write stories as a journalist. But this curse, placed on her family in the time of Cleopatra, drives people insane. Her own father lies in a psychiatric ward, his mind delving deeper and deeper towards total madness. Shan is asked to help solve a series of gruesome murders while Queen Cleopatra appears in the modern day to help figure out the mystery as well.
