,cd5555,2012-02-06T15:27Z,"I would really, really appreciate it if you could seed for a little bit - I've loved this comic since I was like 15; even have about the first 12-15 issues signed&sketched by Mark (he had a lot more time back then lol)

I promise to buy the whole series; I'm just not in Canada anymore... any chance of getting the new volume, ""The Winter Book""?

THANKS A MILLION!"
