,r2007uk,2009-10-04T23:21Z,"how to install? -extracted all files made one .rar file containing the same 12 odd files.. trying to mount/use/extract either/any/all files resulted in no success.. wtfbbq? I know how to mount images/iso. I know how to unzip/extract into an .iso or whatever, but this is illusive to me :/"
,r2007uk,2009-10-04T23:31Z,from what i have gathered so far you must extract part 1 then it prompts for part 2 and i guess you repeat this cycle until its 'all there' but i get to part 2-3 and rather then asking for location of part 3 it just launches my VLC player (random!) and basically fails. What happened to supplying games in ISO ready format? =(
[V],Murlok,2009-10-04T23:42Z,you extract and end up with a cue and bin files this you mount for example in alcohol 120% or what ever you have can handle this format.Extract you do with winrar! got that?
,r2007uk,2009-10-05T00:22Z,you say it so simplistically.. meh i clicked around and just rage-extracted in all different ways until i eventually ended up with an .iso (yes i managed to extract it but dont ask me how i have not a clue). I look forward to tackling your future releases all the same.. WILL POWER!!!!!

,goshgolly,2009-10-13T13:30Z,"Can some kind soul please explain how to create the ISO from this.  I've tried Winrar, peazip, izarc to extract the files but none of those work.  "
