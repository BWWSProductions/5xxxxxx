,kithylin,2009-10-01T01:43Z,Can't get it to start going >.> trackers seem to be off :( keep tryin
,kithylin,2009-10-01T01:48Z,"nevermind i'm a noob, there it goes."
,kithylin,2009-10-01T04:16Z,"Alrighty! Well i've helped seed this up until we got 17 seeders in it, so i'm backing out now. It's up to ya'll.

Enjoy!"
,NealW,2009-10-04T23:46Z,wow this works great thanks kithylin!!!
,airdale,2009-10-06T21:16Z,"Thanks! Wouldn't SP3 contain all previous updates; SR1-A, SP2?"
,kithylin,2009-10-08T09:09Z,"Nope, you would think so, as that's how the actual windows OS's work, but you can download and try it yoruself, SP3 won't install unless it detects Sp2, which won't install without being SR1-a, so... *sigh* 

Anyway they're all there and they go through batch file, took like 5 minutes to install the entire suite + updates on my i7, the whole thing's so small by today's standards."
,lordspamelot,2009-10-08T16:20Z,"I've installed all the updates and everything, but when I open it, it freezes before any of the menus even load. I've tried running it in compatibility mode for Windows 2000, but it didn't help. Any thoughts? I'm running Vista Home Premium with an Intel Core 2 Quad and 6GB of RAM, it's installed to Program Files x86, is there any reason you can think of why it wouldn't work? "
,kithylin,2009-10-09T01:44Z,"Uh no sorry... i have no idea? I've installed it on XP, Vista, and  7, on dual cores, single-cores, quads and i7, 32 and 64-bits of all versions and i've never seen that before... it's always worked on everything i've installed with it.

Sorry i can't be much more help.. but i've not seen that, maybe try google :("
,kithylin,2009-10-09T01:47Z,"I meant to add, i have this exact cd installed on my i7 with Win7-64, and also on my dual core desktop with Win-Vista-64, and also it's on my older laptop with 32-bit WinXP, and it works perfectly on all of em. Although all i use is word, frontpage, and excel i haven't honestly tried access or powerpoint, i don't use those."
,ntipouan,2010-02-24T22:39Z,"Thanks a lot. It works fine, the updates as well, just by following the instructions you gave."
