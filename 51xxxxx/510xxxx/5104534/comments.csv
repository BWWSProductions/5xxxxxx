He thinks that water stops x-rays! He thinks that modern day lizards might have been able to grow to dinosaur size if they lived long enough (except they lost the ""genes for bigness""). What a twat."

let me get this straight you think cause some guy sinned during the duration of his life that hes not credible nor is he correct in any form of scientific study he has completed, we are not the cave dwellers here, if you think that were here by chance and randomness (after all that is what evolution essentially is really bad odds and were all lucky) than that means theres no discernment from your origin and your argument or your brain activity or any of the thoughts floating around in your head, on another note ill have you know that NASA uses water to protect astronauts from the extra radiation released during sun spots and if the water canopy surrounding the earth that kent talks about were to fall or what have you is there a possibility that the molecular composition of the atmosphere would change along with it causing people to live a lot less as far as life span and if there was a molecular composition change as massive as the flood one variable affected might've been oxygen meaning there would be less of it forcing the sons of noah to breathe in less O2 per breath and not have the materials necessary to grow any bigger than a given size after the flood (not a mutation just not the required materials in the air they breathed, look at global cooling, after all more co2 is leaving earth then were putting into it meaning whatever noah and sons were breathing noahs grandkids wouldn't have had as much of and so on) lastly the ark cause i know that was on your minds can hold and lets assume that this is true, that there is 45,000 species (i believe kent talked about this) of animals on the earth that walk on land would could fit all of them into the ark in one hundred and some odd train cars while 522 train cars would fit into the ark if built to the specifications of the book of genesis, it could also withstand waves of over twice its height and being turned on its side to an angle of approx 89degrees without flipping over...

get some facts before you talk with me"
