'Cause ISO disc images are just to big, and MP3 is lossy."
,aligard,2009-10-09T22:56Z,"Good rip. 

This band has fallen a long ways since Wages of Sin... I'm disappointed in this release.  Fans, be warned.  "
,bingbingbiotch,2009-11-17T22:03Z,these are all remakes of old songs from when Johan Liiva fronted the band.
,Kippenson,2009-11-22T10:41Z,seeed please
,bonkeman,2009-12-29T13:42Z,"Good quality rip! The album is a tragic attempt to squeeze more money out of the fans. This is just old songs delivered with a more polished/better sound.

It is a nice ""fuck you"" to Johan Liiva though. Now his work with Arch Enemy is forever erased!"
,Qactis,2010-01-23T05:10Z,I think rise of the tyrant is a great album aligard. Good up tho
,borrys,2010-08-16T02:36Z,"I don't know why you guys think that this is some sort of attempt to piss off Johan Liiva. They're taking old music and re-recording it with their current frontwoman so that the music's consistent. If you don't like it, don't download it. Simple as that."
