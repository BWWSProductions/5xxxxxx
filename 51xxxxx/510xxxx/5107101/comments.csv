,badlands,2009-10-03T10:28Z,"keka_umans: Well, I don't think anyone cares about what you normally DL or the fact that you seem to be dyslexic (English is SUCH a hard language). Try growing a brain instead. 

Thanks as usual eztv for great stuff of the highest quality!"
,Fraremy,2009-10-08T15:27Z,"@ badlands: Dyslexia is a problem with the recognition of letters - their shapes and how they are arranged. Keka-umans' comments could at worst be called bad grammar (missing 2 apostrophes - watchin' & that's. A new sentence after lmao, a comma after not finished & either a hyphon or a comma between mad and quick, followed by ending the sentence correctly). The ""u"" instead of you? That's perfectly understandable ""txt speak"".

So, dyslexic? No.

Bad grammar? Yes, but definitely not the worst on this site. Not by a very large margin.

Don't forget this is a Swedish site used globally. For all we know keka might not even speak English as a first language.

Please don't be so narrow-minded and misinformed. Your lack of tolerance on a P2P site of all things is very surprising & disappointing."
