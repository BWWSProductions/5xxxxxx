This is both discs of Chrono Cross (PSX) encoded in 1 file for use with psp.

I've added a background, custom icon, and background music while hovering over the icon. (It does not repeat, I had problems when I made the sounds repeat) tested by myself through the first save point.

Copy eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

Please comment if you enjoy my torrent, this is the third I've uppede, but I have many pSX games that I've converted for myself that I can post, or if you have any requests.

(If anyone wants this as 2 separate files, I have it also, just don't want to upload without a demand)

Enjoy!

If anyone has any problems with the game, or if you want to request a game for upload, you can E-Mail me at iammrfrank@gmail.com
