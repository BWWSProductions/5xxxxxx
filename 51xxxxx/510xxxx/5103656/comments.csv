for 5.50gen-d3 users only:

for those who are having problems in the 1st boss(mama komodo) here is some steps to solve the problem:

first,download psx2psp from here:link>>http://downloads.pspspot.net/psp-utilities/720-psx2psp-v1-3.html

then,run psx2psp(classic mode) and mount the iso/pbp file and rename the GAME ID(NOT THE MAIN GAME ID) of iso1 and iso 2 from SLUS10410 to SCUS94640 then click Convert

second,download popsloader(full)ver5.50 from here:link>>http://www.pspcollections.net/2009/11/popsloader-full-pack-for-550-gen.html

place the contents of the file on the seplugins folder of yer psp and enable the popsloader on the recovery.use 3.80pops when you run the game and then voila!Enjoy playing chrono cross!
