A woman dies tragically in an automoblie accident but the true horror awaits her after death. What happens to the body after the spirit has moved on the corpse is at the mercy of those who manhandle the dead? What manner of creature is it that tears our bodies apart only to put them back together again? Whether we like it or not, we are all at the mercy of the coroner's knife, and the abuse and indignities we suffer are strictly up to him. 
Nacho Cerda's vision of horror after death culminates in a vicious, unrelenting showcase of true terror that has disturbed and repulsed viewers worldwide.
