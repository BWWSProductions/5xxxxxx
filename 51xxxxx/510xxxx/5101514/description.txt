From Tartan Asia Extreme

Life is what you'd expect for young teenagers in this seemingly normal private girls school, until a past alumni returns as a teacher. She strikes up a new friendship with two very different students and a horrific course of events ensues. A teacher is found dead, apparently having committed suicide, and circumstances that inextricably link both the past and present are unveiled. As the body count rises, the memories of the deaths unleash the echoes of ghosts down the corridor.

Great soundtrack.
