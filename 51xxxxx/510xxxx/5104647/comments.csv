,PoshNinja,2009-10-09T01:15Z,"Just finished this download and took a peek at it to see what I was getting myself into.

Stunning quality for the size, fantastic work but horrifyingly slow speed.

Either A. Some of the seeders don't have their ports opened or B. there's just not enough people seeding this with maximum upload.

It's worth the wait, though, unless you can find a faster torrent with the same size and quality."

I've downloaded this torrent in only 2 hours near around 190KB/s to 200 KB/s speed..!
There Must be a problem in your torrent client.. Check all the settings & make sure that the port is properly forwarded.

@F.x.M,
A Perfect & Awesome Audio/Video Quality..
Just nicely ripped to only 1.36 GBs.. Liked it!

Thanks for the upload!

,blahspam1,2009-11-30T09:41Z,"Question: How can a 720p movie be only 1GB and be decent quality when most other movies are around 7 or 8 GB?

Is it because its mostly animation or something?"
,visualcreations,2010-01-06T01:46Z,"hey F.x.M, do you think you could post a detailed ""how to"" of exactly how and with what apps/settings you use to rip a Blu-Ray with this great quality and at such a relatively small file size? I'm sure everyone who uploads/backs up hi-def content would love to know how exactly you do it. Please share the knowledge."
