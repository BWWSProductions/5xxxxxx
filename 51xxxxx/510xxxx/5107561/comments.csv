,Foxdad,2009-10-03T16:30Z,"I canÂ´t understand why you Dutch uploaders are so self-centered so you ONLY have Dutch subtitles...if you at least have English subs also, then I of course donÂ´t mind the Dutch subs, OK?"
,AkeemMabilu,2009-10-06T23:07Z,"Foxdad, the movie is... English. And at least CrazyAdriaan does upload stuff. What about you? In stead of throwing stones at someone, just ASK if that person is willing to put the English subtitles on next release. You will reach more goals that way in life..."
