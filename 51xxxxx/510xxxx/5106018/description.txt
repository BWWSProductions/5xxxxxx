ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

The remarkable maturity of Jaci Velasquez's voice, so well displayed on her 1996 debut release, continues on this self-titled second offering. Here, the prodigious 19-year-old rising star has recorded pop gems by the likes of Chris Eaton, producer Mark Heimermann, singer/songwriter deluxe Michelle Tumes, and DC Talk's Toby McKeehan. "God So Loved the World," "You," "Look What Love Has Done," and "Sweet Surrender" are all magnificent examples of topflight writing, production, and singing. Velasquez even shows a gritty side on "Child of Mine" and "Show You Love," revealing a raw power beyond her more tempered efforts. No doubt Miss Velasquez has raised the bar with this outstanding release, widely believed to have helped her win the 1999 Dove Award for best female vocalist.
