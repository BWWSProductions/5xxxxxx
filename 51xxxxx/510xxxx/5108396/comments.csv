,candykisslips,2009-10-04T01:53Z,Why is Star Wars Legacy 38 in this one ? 38 was Two Issues ago. Legacy 40 came out on the 30th. Obviously it's not scanned yet. 
,brega10,2009-10-04T02:07Z,As always... a huge thanks to Espurious!

It's in the pack because it was scanned in the past week.

Not all comics in my packs are new."
