,Cadinot,2009-10-02T09:21Z,"I would think it is. Mois20 has a green skull, indicating he is a trusted pirate and he has upped about 6000 (six thousand) movies and tv shows to the bay. 
English subs here --> http://subscene.com/Gigante/subtitles-78784.aspx

Gracias Mois20"
,Cadinot,2009-10-02T11:30Z,"Yeah, it's very real. Complete, audio and video both excellent. The subs from subscene are right on.
But the movie - watch something else. "
