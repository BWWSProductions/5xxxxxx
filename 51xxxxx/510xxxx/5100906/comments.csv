The narrator takes you on an amazing journey from the face of the earth to the edge of the Universe (as we know it) in a stunning visual articulation of the cosmos. I have literally watched this almost everyday since first seeing it on TV. The graphics are top notch and extremely smooth. It feels as though you are right there, soaring thru the galaxies at home and way beyond. The verbage in this program is comprehensible and the terminology basic enough for these in-depth concepts of Physics and Geology to come to life and understanding for even the most un-mathematical type of minds. This program is the most fascinating and knowledge envoking of any I have seen yet about the Universe."""

Thanks for the upload. This is narrated by Alec Baldwin. The audio and video are both in high quality.

,iSze,2009-12-20T07:22Z,"Thank you but I prefer the one narrated by Sean Pertwee, as Alec Baldwin doesn't sound like a good choice for the program. I am not complaining about the torrent, it's great, only the content version. Thank you again, anyways. For those who want the original version, follow this link: http://www.torrenthound.com/hash/f500bdecf13c7cdc077db42a3b54e2ae3a712eec/torrent-info/National-Geographic-Journey-To-The-Edge-Of-The-Universe-720p-HDTV-x264-DiCH"

,yitzhak4271,2010-06-23T06:44Z,Thanks so much. I can't get enough of these science dox!
,Croix1979,2010-10-31T22:46Z,Thank you eddie1969 and also a big thanks to the useful reviews by the other users THANKS
,MiscFoxes,2010-12-31T10:41Z,"I actually used to have the audio rip of this (with Alec narrating), and I'd use it as my ""white noise"" as I slept. After 7 hours of continuous looping, Alec had always started sounding like a chipmunk... it was funny. 

This is a wonderful copy, though. I adore the creative graphics and imagery, as well as Baldwin's smooth narration. "
