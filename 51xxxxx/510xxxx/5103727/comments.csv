,P43082,2009-09-29T06:39Z,whats with the huge sample size?
,sberesni,2009-09-29T07:05Z,"@canseven & p43082:
Its 2.17 GB because the uploader seemed to have packaged up an HD recording (Which can be upwards of 1+ GB.... *ITS HD*) twice.. The sample is a dup of the show. If you have a decent client you can just ignore the sample and download the show itself."
