,rudyaznpride,2009-10-11T07:21Z,Can someone teach me how to install this game? I don't have the Japanese Language pack so everything is lines and symbols. :(

(put hshare together with the rest of the adress)
@rudyaznpride: 

go into the control pad --> clock regional language --> National and language --> click on the administrative tab --> change the system language to Japanese.

Once you've installed you might wanna look up the translation patch."
,Mazena,2009-11-25T08:15Z,Screenshots? Where?

,Allerion,2010-05-09T05:53Z,"I just have a question or two.

While I can play Rapelay and AG3 without any major errors, this game and homemate give me fits for whatever reason. 5 minutes into the game, it'll go BSOD on me with the following data on the bugcheck: 0x10000050 (0xe63ab104, 0x00000000, 0xbf35ce85, 0x00000001). [This was an error off Homemate]

For one, can someone translate that into english? I tried, without avail. 

And if you did get a blue screen of death on an illusion game, what did you do to fix it?

Much obliged. ^^
