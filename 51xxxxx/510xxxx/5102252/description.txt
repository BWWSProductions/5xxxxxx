Philip Palmer's inventive dramatisation of Books I and II of Edmund Spenser's towering Elizabethan epic poem.Fast, funny and furious yarn-telling mixes with moments of vivid poetry.

The Faerie Queene was one of the most influential poems in the English language. Dedicating his work to Elizabeth I, Spenser brilliantly united Arthurian romance and Italian renaissance epic to celebrate the glory of the Virgin Queen. Each book of the poem recounts the quest of a knight to achieve a virtue: the Red Crosse Knight of Holinesse, who must slay a dragon and free himself from the witch Duessa; Sir Guyon, Knight of Temperance, who escapes the Cave of Mammon and destroys Acrasiaâ€™s Bowre of Bliss. Although composed as a moral and political allegory, The Faerie Queeneâ€™s magical atmosphere captivated the imaginations of later poets from Milton to the Victorians.

Episode 1- A Gloriously Swashbuckling Retelling of St George and the Dragon
Episode 2- Sir Guyon, the Knight of Temperance, journeys to the Bower of Bliss.
