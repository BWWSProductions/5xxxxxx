,jiveclive,2009-12-08T10:48Z,"Nope it does not include that corny killer. So sorry. However, it greatly makes up for that deficit with a very detailed account of the famous Capn Crunch killing spree of 1988. He was all upset because he was turned down one time too many by the sexy Fruit Loops. She was too crazy for Cream of Wheat in those days. It's a good read. Lot's of color. "
