On The Moral Maze on BBC Radio 4, each week Moral Maze panelists interrogate several â€œwitnessesâ€ on a topic touching on religion and ethics.

"The Moral Maze, in fact, typically offers something rarely heard on radio or television: a real diversity of viewpoints, argued intelligently and engagingly, and informed by a keen desire to understand the human condition..."

For anyone who wants a "taster" I suggest the discussion on US morality.
