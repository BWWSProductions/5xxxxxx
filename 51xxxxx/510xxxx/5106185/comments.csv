,imacalu,2009-10-01T15:44Z,"hm, pitty for me. Doesn't work here. :-( getting the message: 'error! patching unsuccessfull' after dragging bento to the cracker and hitting 'patch'."
,imacalu,2009-10-01T15:47Z,tried it again. I had bento 2 installed so i 'zapped' it  away with appzapper. No way. Still not working. What's up doc?
,imacalu,2009-10-01T15:54Z,"oh oh, i see! :-) From the read Me 1st: How to use it?

Launch the cracker. Drag&drop Bento 3 into the cracker-window.
Quit the cracker.
Launch Bento 3 and type in the serial from the screenshot. Process ready.
You can now use Bento w/o any nags.

i will add to this: DON'T hit the patch button once you dropped bento into the cracker... :-)
now it works."
