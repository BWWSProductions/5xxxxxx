[description from infowars]

"Paul Joseph Watson, journalist and editor of Prison Planet, and Kurt Nimmo, editor and journalist for Infowars, will join Alex today in a round table discussion of Iran's supposedly "secret" uranium enrichment plant and the plan to attack Iran. 


Alex also talks about vaccines with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, of Natural News.

Alex also covers the news and takes your calls."


HR1: Rand corp think tank on record promotes world war to distract from
money changer banking implosion and complete heist, public dumbed down,
black is white and white is black, the public will believe anything -
what's next? Infanticide to Moloch?!, Israel leads global push to attack
Iraq... I mean, Iran (slight typo...), media hype is unreal, the public
doesn't bother to explore facts and reality, October surprise?, weird
comments from Zbigniew Brzezinski, factoids on Western influence on Iran
in modern times, etc.

HR2: Open Lines, Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, flu pretext
for complete USA/global clamp down, coming devaluation of the dollar, Northcom
is meant for you - it is really happening, PAUL JOSEPH WATSON!,
comments on obama (no-bama), G-20, etc.

HR3: MIKE ADAMS - Health Ranger of Natural News, vaccine is more dangerous
than flu, etc.

HR4: Open Lines with Mike Adams, etc.  (sig_garrett)

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
