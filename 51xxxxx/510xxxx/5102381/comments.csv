,M0e09,2010-02-15T20:09Z,How comes that the filesizes of the single episodes with the same runtime variate from 187 to 321 MB? Any info about codecs or bitrates?
,M0e09,2010-02-16T02:33Z,"ok so I just gotta answer that question myself... episode 1 is an EZTV (or similar) TV rip, converted to mp4 in quite bad quality with a resoluation of 480x272
so I'd rather go for another version of this..."
