,amitarora78,2009-10-31T04:01Z,Bozx your description says that movie length is 75 minutes however IMDB says its 77 minutes. Could you please tell what part of movie is cut. Are the end credits cut or something else? 
,alienjesus,2009-11-09T03:41Z,"yes, he cut the end credits, which I find very annoying.  Did it really save you that much time/bandwidth?

other than that, the rip is superb."
,WoodBeast,2009-12-22T02:45Z,No credits = very annoying.
,albokid89,2011-10-17T07:18Z,"yeah the no credits thing pisses me off, too"
