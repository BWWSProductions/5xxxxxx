How the hell do you unzip this bunch of .zip files ?!?!"
,marvin2000,2009-09-29T18:55Z,"Thank you very much, but why not just one DMG instead of all these rar and zip-files?"
,dockjell,2009-09-29T22:07Z,"Smells a little fake here, please comment if it's okey..."
,Cain303,2009-09-29T23:23Z,"You have to unzip all zip files to extract the .rar segments. Then unrar them to get the .dmg

This is the way CORE released it. I'm just the messenger.

Don't shoot the messenger."
,thasro,2009-09-30T04:03Z,"So regardless, I'm sure other people would like to know if this software actually works...."
,marvin2000,2009-09-30T05:04Z,It works well.
,lenny491,2009-09-30T09:23Z,This is NOT fake! Works great!
,findermix,2009-09-30T16:48Z,"Fatal files, multiples zip's, incomprensible format for unzip.
Make a .dmg please!!!"
,Almarenan,2009-09-30T19:14Z,"Lot more simple than I tought :
unzip all "".zip"" files,
put all resulting "".rar"" in same folder (and only those, forget the others),
double-click on n°1 and Voilà !"
,Almarenan,2009-09-30T19:17Z,"Forgot to say thanks !

BTW, the Contextual Menu items aren't back in order (they've disappeared since upgrade in 10.6) ... still, thxs !"
,dockjell,2009-10-01T10:21Z,"A little tip :)
This is how an upload should look like, nice and clean.

,ultrapiratebuffer,2009-10-12T17:32Z,"Yeah, the upload isn't ""nice and clean"" looking but at least its how the warez group published it. Core-Checker and all. If you cant CMD+A to extract all ZIPs and use Spotlight for all the RARs (wich takes like 1minute at max) then, yeah... go with the other release of the SAME software.

I prefer the genuine experience ;)"
,eklir,2009-10-13T07:23Z,The serial for this does NOT work.

I DID EXACTLY AS YOU EXPLAINED:
unzip all "".zip"" files,
put all resulting "".rar"" in same folder (and only those, forget the others),
double-click on n°1 and Voilà !

...BUT WHEN double-click on n°1, IT OPENS THE RAR FILE INSTEAD OF INSTALLING ALL TOGETHER

I also put all the "".dmg"" files every one on each folder and renamed the folders from deluxe_installer_en_74.part01 to 17, because they all use the same name and overwrites the files. After that, nothing happens.

I tried TREE different ways with the same results; CANNOT PUT IT TOGETHER.
MAYBE I NEED A ""SPECIAL"" PROGRAM FOR THE "".dmg"" file???

IN ADDITION, the keygen ?CORE10k.EXE? opens a video (like a movie) and I stopped after TWO minutes of nothing showing up other than circles of lights that moves around my black screen.    IS THIS A VIRUS?

DID SOMEONE ELSE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS??

THANKS A LOT!!!"
,ForFun00,2010-01-29T00:57Z,"SORRY ABOUT MY ABOVE QUESTIONS.
I JUST REALIZE THIS PROGRAM IS FOR A MAC

THANKS"
,davesouth,2010-06-28T18:45Z,"haha guess you missed the Type: Applications > MAC category, or perhaps the MacOSX in the FILE NAME. Or C: you are retarded. 

Annoying packaging. Why you would ever pack up the application to open .RAR files in a .RAR directory is beyond me. Makes it impossible to open if you dont already have stuffit installed, and then if you did you wouldnt be dl this. 

Core has to be one of the most retarded groups ever. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
,esculapes,2011-02-05T14:30Z,"@davesouth & all other smartasses: you're the 'tarded ones.. just look at them, goddam mofos got voice

just use the the default osx Archive Utility to unzip and google UnRarX to auto-extract the rars, it's that easy
