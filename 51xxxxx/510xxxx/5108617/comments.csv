,aku77,2009-11-22T20:07Z,"Christianity IS NOT Jesus's (Peace Be Upon Him) teaching. it is the teaching of paul/saul. Christians say they are the follower of Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) but really they are not cos they are not following what Jesus did in his lifetime that is following the the law Torah,OT to the letter. so really Christian should be call ""Pauline"" not Christian.

{5:17} Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. {5:18} For
verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled. {5:19} Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever
shall do and teach [them,] the same shall be called great in
the kingdom of heaven.  *Matthew 5:17 - 5:19"
