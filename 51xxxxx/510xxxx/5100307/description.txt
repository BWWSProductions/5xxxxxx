the first work along with kettlebell video program.  from punch gym / art of strength.  great workout, if you read books by dragon door, or other kettlebell fanatics/pushers, but didn't understand how to tie it all together: this video is for you.  i've got two more, each progressively harder.  this my first video upload, need feedback on how it goes.  this is a direct rip using dvd shrink with nero as a burner.  let me know if it works and i"ll put the other two up.
