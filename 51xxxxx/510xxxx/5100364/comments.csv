on windows xp: 

1 - unzip 'Quake 1 + 2.rar' in c: (will create the folders c:\quake 1 and c:\quake 2) 

2 - rename the folders quake 1 and quake 2 for quake1 and quake2 without spaces (ex: c:\quake1 c:\quake2) 

3 - create 1 folder named quake1 within games folder (ex: c:\games\quake1) 

4 - download dosbox for windows (I prefer version 0.72: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/dosbox/) 

5 - install dosbox 

6 - run dosbox 

7 - mount a virtual drive simulating a hd which is where the files will be installed (ex: mount c c:\games\quake1) 

8 - mount a virtual drive to simulate the cd drive where are the installation files (ex: mount d c:\quake1 -t cdrom) 

9 - enter d: (ex: d:) 

10 - run the installer (ex: install.exe or simply install) 

11 - the default installation path is c:\quake, remove the word: quake and put only c:\ (ex: c:\) 

12 - there are bugs in the installer: 'we've encountered an error as follows: ...................' . always press yes when you see this error message (ex: y) 

13 - after all this process click ok and that will run quake! 

- Every time you want to play quake -- 

1 - run dosbox 

2 - Mount a virtual drive simulating a hd which are installed quake files (ex: mount c c:\games\quake1) 

3 - enter c: (ex: c:) 

4 - run quake (ex: quake.exe or simply quake) 

- To enable the sound -- 

1 - close the dosbox 

2 - go to the location where you installed the dosbox (ex: c:\Program Files\DOSBox-0.72) 

3 - open the dosbox.conf file using notepad  

4 - search for the parameter: gus=true and change to gus=false 

5 - run dosbox and run quake 

- To slow the game --

1 - close the dosbox

2 - go to the location where you installed the dosbox (ex: c:\Program Files\DOSBox-0.72)

3 - open the dosbox.conf file using notepad 

4 - search for the parameter: cycles=auto and change to cycles=100000

5 - run dosbox and run quake
