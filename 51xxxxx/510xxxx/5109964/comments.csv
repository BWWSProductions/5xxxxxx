,dpance,2009-10-05T14:53Z,"Well, not really a surprise but here stateside SpeedTV messed up this race.  In addition to all the other gaffes and miscues they normally throw out there, for Estoril the audio was choppy and barely listenable all throughout.  Sigh....

To that end, I never really understood what was wrong with Rossi's bike and what happened to Stoner's leg when he dropped it to the ground at speed.  He alluded to screwing up his footpeg during the post race press conference but that's about it.  And why was Jorge's Yamaha so dominant over The Doctor's?

Regardless, thanks to The Great TDMK1 all those issues will soon be put to bed.  Really appreciate your time in upping these great races.  Can't tell you how much I enjoy watching the fine BBC Broadcasts."

,tdmk1,2009-10-18T10:27Z,TPB torrent uploads not working quite right today... let's hope they fix it soon
,dpance,2009-10-18T19:02Z,"I noticed that too last night tdmk.  Hope they get it working soon as I need my MotoGP fix!  I'm sorta torn at this point.  Do I watch the crappy one hour race on SpeedTV or wait for your upload?  I need to learn patience!

Thanks again.  Oh, I went back and downloaded all the previous weeks that I didn't have for the 2009 season.  Outstanding, for sure.  Need to get off my ass and leave a thank you for each race.  My best!"

I like this torrents so much that I don't watch the regular broadcasts and try to avoid the raceresults online and radio until tdmk1's is available...

Hope the piratebay upload works again soon. I need my MotoGP medicine..."
