,hereitcomes,2009-10-02T01:43Z,I'm having the same problem. Anyone?
,silkthinker,2009-10-10T04:40Z,wouldn't have been the same to provide this 8+ GB for a DL dvd?
,spookytoothe,2009-10-12T23:30Z,Thanks man! I wish more people cared about quality before size. Great download speed - over 900 kB/s !!!

You did a great job! I love this movie!

I was just wondering, if anybody knows, how can I get from these two VTS pieces one complete DVD9 file.

Thanx!"
