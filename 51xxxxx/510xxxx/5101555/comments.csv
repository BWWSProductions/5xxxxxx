,indikat,2009-09-27T07:18Z,"Ups, Hunald786, and not 789"
,Jaakeee,2009-09-27T12:10Z,why am i downloading with under 10kb/s????????
,sunny2008,2009-09-27T15:01Z,"It is shocking to see that you have left the Dolby Digital 2.0 commentary as well, which has well eaten into the video quality of the already long movie. With DD5.1 already there, you could have prefered to go with higher video quality. Sorry, am going to skip this one. "
,cristinuta77,2009-09-27T17:02Z,Please seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed! Thanks!
[V],sailo,2009-09-27T17:08Z,"I accept your apology, no need to be sorry.

For this kind of long action movie, do you really think anyone can make the video quality look HD with mpeg2 on a DVD5 ? 
get real, its just for non picky people who wants to watch it from their dvd player, cheaply."
,mofazza,2009-09-27T17:30Z,"Please seed some, this will take me a week :(

,iSze,2009-09-29T00:01Z,"Nice, but after seeing this movie I think I'm going to file rape charges against Micheal Bay. The first Transformers was actually a descent action movie, I had alot of fun seeing for the first time back in '07. Two years later, here comes the sequel. Of course at this point I trust Micheal Bay, despite his ""lets blow some shit up!"" style of film directing. Never again man. I feel like I just got mind-phucked by a kamikaze entertainment package consiting of 99% special effects and 1% story. Digital explosions are dangerous."
,sauehue11,2009-09-30T13:11Z,"How the fck is it possible that there are 1000 seeders, when i`ve used 3 days to download 0.6%!?!?!?"

A 10
V10 "
[T],grimreaper420,2009-10-26T03:57Z,"zifflol, you burn it with Nero, what else you gonna do?"
,apoc25,2009-11-27T15:42Z,"WTF is going on with the scene? So many content providers are releasing supposed bluray rips at dvd quality and releasing supposed DVD rips at CD quality? FFS what happened to the practice of professionalism in this scene?

There should only be 3 formats....
CD - 700megs
DVD - 4gigs
bluray - higher

Let's stop calling a 700 meg and 1.37 gig file a dvd/bluray rip.... CUZ IT'S NOT

Not pickin on your release Sailo, like you said you're just making a low end release for non-picky people to watch in their DVD player. But in general, this Transformers release, on this site, is one big massive blunder."
,MoviesR101,2011-07-08T14:31Z,"Thanks Sailo!

Stop complaining and go buy!
