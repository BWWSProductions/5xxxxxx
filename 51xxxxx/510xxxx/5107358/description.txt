Originally organized as the trio backing Johnny Kidd, this band continued working long after the latterâ€™s death in a mid-â€˜60s automobile accident. Behind lead guitarist Mick Green, who has played with just about everybody over the years (including Paul McCartneyâ€™s Choba B CCCP and Run Devil Run), they embraced their punk roots in the late â€™70s and early â€™80s and still do a great show, even without a â€œrealâ€ lead singer.
