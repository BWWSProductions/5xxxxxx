,MaximilianKohler,2010-10-17T23:53Z,ROFL 100% agree with Kuthumi... didn't know what this movie was before I downloaded it... I can't believe there are people who enjoy watching garbage like this... what a joke.
,Congeal,2010-10-26T00:35Z,"@MaximilianKohler, well you obviously lack taste and common sense. This is an amazing movie/musical, though pretentious at times. And is it a habit of yours to randomly torrent videos? "

,CaptainLynn109,2012-05-23T06:52Z,"One of my favourite musicals. This movie touches my heart and I always get emotional. You can have your opinions, but mine is that this is a musical that show people that there is more to life then you think, it shows people that people who happen to be gay are normal people who just love someone else same as straight people do. I think it shows that people with addiction have a hard time and that its not all sunshine and lolly pops. I also believe that it makes the person(if they have an open mind) that other people can suffer like they do but for different reasons. It showed me personally that not everyone is/everybody's life is perfect. All  you can do is do what YOU think is right and follow your dreams. I saw from this musical that sometimes you have to realize that what you are doing is destructive and hurting not just yourself but everyone around you. I'm sorry if I am ranting, but this musical is very beautiful and focuses the beautiful, hard, and also sad journey that 8 people go through in life."
