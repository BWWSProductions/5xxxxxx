,Amrita1,2009-09-26T23:58Z,"tnx

high res without the colors yay"

,miller126,2009-09-29T22:21Z,"for PS3 users...... use TVersity media server, and,MKV to VOB file converter..... very simple UI on both...... both are free on the web..... any questions on how to use them, let me know on here and i will answer best i can.  no kidding though....... these are the best overall for using PS3... trust me i've tried them all....."
,seikogb2,2009-09-29T23:27Z,"jackdaddypfc: maybe ur pc isn't high spec enough or something... it plays fine on my desktop.

miller126: completely agree. Remember to select 'Never transcode' when adding the mkv to tversity though... otherwise it will take days people..."

,bewareoblivionisathand,2009-09-30T09:28Z,"Challenger52- perhaps it's hardware related. Because of a puny video card, the same thing happens to me if I try and watch 1080p movies on my laptop."
,neokuffs,2009-09-30T19:38Z,"Audio/Video : 0/0

4 Fucking days of download and it does not work in mpc-hc, not even with the fucking BETA codec you advertise.

Updated everything to be sure, and still no fucking playback in mpc-hc, vlc or windows player. Didn't even play on linux either.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS IS CRAP!!!!

YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR PURPLE SKULL REMOVED FOR THIS!!!! 4 FUCKING DAYS FOR THIS CRAP!!!"

,steadygettingblown,2009-10-02T11:04Z,Hands down best player to play high res movies is media player classic with the matroska pack and haill media splitter for the codec part ....i use vlc for everything else but HD files because it trys to use its own codecs and lags up but window$ media player uses the codecs on your rig and it comes in a handy 4mb exe. file ......your welcome! ;)

,IQgutten,2009-10-06T17:33Z,ninja365: That is because your computer is to crap to run HD...
,ninja365,2009-10-06T19:23Z,"IQgutten: no, it isn't. I always watch 720p .mkv-movies using vlc without any problems and never seen anything like this crap before. jumps and lags and fucks around."
,caliwillbemine,2009-10-07T07:11Z,"ninja365:
well download the 1080p version, thats the one i have and it's perfect!

But i really doubt this version jumps... maybe your hard drive or system have a problem."

Thanks,

,celebral2003,2009-10-08T02:33Z,"HEY miller126, I have tried using Mkv2vob but i hate it. IF i use say a 1080p or 720p mkv file WITH DTS AUDIO, when i use mkv2vob , one of  two things happen. Either it always transcodes the video (takes like 2 hours) it freezes. Now, even if the video converts fully, when i try playback on computer or even ps3(with HDMI) there is either video with no sound or no video with sound. All i want is this : to be able to play back HD on my ps3 with DTS audio. THANKS"
,FireWireMan,2009-10-08T04:04Z,"To those has problem of play MKV, TS, TRP, MOV, WMV-HD (H264 codec) files.

It is an old school try to play these HD with your PC/MAC. Try these folks:
EP6000B
TVIX M-6500A
No conversion to DVD, btw it is stupid to convert HD to DVD, why not down load the DVD??! Duh!!

For those who bitching about the upload with or w/o sub just down load the sub you want then change the name identical to the movies, EP6000B and TVIX6500 will pick it right up!

Stop bitching, do it right instead.
Search in AMAZON for those players

but the animation was simply amazing. It was really good quality in 720p, but get it in 1080p, or you'll regret it. It will make the movie sooooooo much better.
