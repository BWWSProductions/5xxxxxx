******************** IMPORTANT INFO ********************

::::::::::DVD-RIPS:::::::::: 
These documentary films circulate on the web thanks to the ones who had the generosity of spirit to rip and share them.
All the credits go to them. 

::::::::::SUBTITLES::::::::::
In order to make these documentaries accessible to as many people as possible, subtitles in several languages were included.

These files were collected from free websites. They may contain some spelling/translation errors. 

All of them were checked and are synchronized with the respective video.

Please remember these subtitles were made by volunteers, who generously gave their time and effort to create them, so that these contents could reach more people.
All the credits go to them.

These are all external subtitles (.srt files). 

The reason why some of the films have considerably less subtitles included is that I really couldn't find other languages anywhere. 

It is possible that someone has since made more subtitles available on the web, so, if you need them, try to google it.

::::::::::PLEASE SEED:::::::::
If you find any value in any of these, please seed and spread the word. 
Any help in keeping the torrent alive is most welcome.

Thanks.
Peace and all the best.
