,Sesh9,2009-10-17T07:33Z,"sorry to sound so green but...
running logic xpress 7. using this technique will i be able to go to apple and upgrade to 9? Just super terrified of losing all my projects."
,stormzsystem,2009-10-22T23:41Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I don't have a ProApps folder anywhere in my Application Support directory! I have a Logic folder, but that's all.. Any idea what I could do?"
,WNxMatt,2009-11-30T17:35Z,Yeah I still can't find that directory.. Volume/Library/Application Support/Pro-Apps. :( 
,bassit,2009-12-01T05:16Z,"WNxMatt- search in the finder for Volume...then follow the folders...make sure you are searching under the Macintosh HD, the entire computer."
,wjmwpg,2009-12-09T20:12Z,"Does anyone know how I can apply this to ONLY Logic and not have it affect my other apple apps (like Final Cut Studio, etc...)"
,SeHou,2010-01-09T03:46Z,anyone know if this works with 9.0.2?...let me know thank you!
,cshift08,2010-01-14T20:27Z,"First of all, this works great!

,Timo906,2010-03-12T18:23Z,"wtf, somehow it doesn't work here. The only thing that has changed is the user information. It says:

(first, last name) = Apple   (and)  Retail
(organization) = Apple Inc.

Why does this happen?
Does anyone know the answer?

Thnx and Greetz

,nemo3,2010-06-19T14:05Z,"Hi, 

yes now my update logic 9.02 works but the previous one 9.01 doesn't unless serial is entered any tips ?"
,Fnnylgrnd,2010-10-19T22:18Z,"9.01 fix
If you accidentally or purposely ran those pro apps updates,  
A guy on a different logic torrent page gave this fix:
http://www.mac-torrents.com/torrents.php?mode=details&id=b03cd244fb8231e0f84d7c09af9993c1d9a70e64

worked perfect. What a sweetheart. "
,JJohn1194,2010-12-17T05:11Z,"After I download. Do I burn 9 different DVDs? How do I mount them.  I am a Novice, No Doubt!"
,ocdcyo,2011-08-09T19:05Z,"Ohhhhh man - can any of you help? 

Upgraded to Lion 10.7. Ran Logic - it said that my version would not work with Lion, and that I needed to update it. I did this update of Logic to 9.1.5, forgetting it would wipe the serial. 

Does anyone have a serial number that will work with 9.1.5 or a way around it? I'm f***ed if I can't record and there's no way I can afford to buy it.

Thanx claire."
