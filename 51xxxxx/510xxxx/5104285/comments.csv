,Alt3Red,2009-09-29T17:59Z,I know the Risen-THEPiRATEGAY release is the russian clone with eng audio/video/text extracted from the xbox version. Really this is multi5?
,Christosck,2009-09-29T19:11Z,Thank you mister :)waiting for this too long.keep up the good work and i hope(trust you) this will be english!!
,Nexforever,2009-09-29T20:22Z,"Risen-THEPiRATEGAY it's Rus version+pack language English,not multi 5! Beware!!!"
,Frgr91,2009-09-29T20:56Z,Anyone know if this got a crack?
,sevendarkdays,2009-09-30T03:43Z,"lol, i was drooling over this at gamespot a couple of hours ago."
,Bling777,2009-09-30T06:09Z,"Either these files are somehow corrupted (even though the the MDS/MDF files extracted fine) or this is a fake release. I attempted to burn this with Alcohol 1.93 and an error announced it was an unrecognizable file format. I then renamed the MDF to BIN and tried to open with MagicISO and it crashes the program. If anyone has a cure for this sick dog, please post a comment."
,stoleyourshoes,2009-09-30T06:55Z,"i did bother downloading and it did what ""madborn"" said in another risen release. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5102552/Risen_[RUS_Novyj_Disk]2009

it works and i got my shit in english"
,stoleyourshoes,2009-09-30T11:56Z,"i changed everything in english and the intro is still in russian, but atleast everything written in game and in the menu is in english. and i get no sound ffrom conversations anyway so i cant hear the russian lol. its all good though ill just read the subtitles, i skip through conversatins anyway."
,Christosck,2009-09-30T13:36Z,Damn it!!It's the Russian version again...Cant you guys check it out before upload it?!we need an English one with VOICE too not only texts and subs.
,Christosck,2009-09-30T14:44Z,Ok that is the easy way to play the game.i did that and i am playing it right now like this but the voices are russian and this is anoying when you want to hear some english words.
,stoleyourshoes,2009-09-30T15:24Z,"man i really wasted my time on this. the game really extremely blows. its so boring and difficult to complete a quest cus u gotta find and do stuff but nobody knows where the fuck you have to go.

screw this boring game"
,LRN,2009-09-30T17:08Z,"Since this game is, essentially, German, i think i'll take the chance and play the Russian version. The translation can't be farther away from the original than the yet-to-come-out English version anyway."
,andy72184,2009-09-30T21:47Z,"@extremezone  jesus christ we shouldn't have to do any of that shit, it's always something with new games huh?  Or bad exporting."
,andy72184,2009-09-30T21:49Z,"@stoleyourshoes, thank you I'll take your word on it.  Seems like the instructions extremezone gave from previous post from your boring game and hard quest post :D"
,CptGio,2009-10-01T01:28Z,SEED!
,Lucky13s,2009-10-01T05:04Z,"speed is ridiculously slow. Downloaded the AVENGED one, MUCH faster (its on mininova)"
,daMouse,2009-10-01T15:32Z,"Seriously, if it's russian it should say so in the description or GTFO. :P"
,johnmuie,2009-10-01T23:18Z,"i instaled the game,but the install wizard being in russian i must have done something wrong. it ended up at 2.4 GB( but i can play it).with the english subs its palyeble, and the russian languege makes it a bit exotic, so thanks for upload :)
i'll try to reinstall it to see if i get it to a normal size. thanks again for upload"
,xebz,2009-10-02T15:51Z,Amen palla ett ryskt spel.. 
,Netherland,2009-10-03T11:05Z,"The speed IS slow indeed, I have a average of 64KB/S..
It took me 19 : 44 Hours to complete... Whoa...


And the install is in russian, Hoping to change the game to english :)"
,johnmuie,2009-10-03T14:54Z,"whats the size of the game installed? i get only 2.4 GB. the installer stops when checking the physX version and it sais that the programm cannot acces MSIEXEC.EXE
i run vista 32 bit and tried the installer with admin rights. stills ame problem"
,rock1982,2009-10-07T01:42Z,"@johnmuie
Hahaha...I didn't believe that the game takes only 2gb (!?!?)....I still find it hard to believe - this game seems huge.even the DVD itself which looks like a 4.4gb DVD is even less - just 1.7gb. 
I, myself, am now on a mission to try and understand if the camera jitters in the game are game related,a bug,or maybe a game related feature that goes haywire every now and then...seriously...is it supposed to be an earthquake on the island or maybe every time you are near a cave or something...what is that???...anyway it freaks me out..."
,asestar,2009-10-10T01:18Z,"Avoid this release please. Its Russian ONLY! Not Multi5.

Shame on you extremezone.

4.4gb torrent, dvd image is 1.7gb, install is 2.2gb. WHERE is rest of space going?"
,megafilipe,2010-12-01T02:03Z,German pfff.
,LordSajet,2011-01-18T14:48Z,okay so after mounting and installing how do i change text and menus to english? is the installation process also in russian? i followed the link but couldn`t find any comments by madborn
,LordSajet,2011-01-27T08:01Z,i cant seem to find any comment by madborn anywhere.. could someone pls explain how to get this thing working in english?...or atleast english subtitles?
,Lordfuinha,2011-03-12T14:43Z,"Ok, I'm here to fuckin' clean shit up. This is a working Torrent, there is no need to crack it. It IS Multi 5, you just have to click on the russian word for install and then will open the language you wish to install the game. I'm playing it, it's working great on my Windows 7 64bit. 
Instructions:
- Download the game
- Extract it with Winrar
- Mount the Image (the image is on the folder you have extracted from the zipped file) with Daemon Tools.
- Open the DVD and run the setup.exe DON'T USE AUTORUN
- Click on the first option if you already have DirectX installed on your PC (you probably already have if you play other games)
- Choose the language you want to install and voila
- The game will ALL BE IN THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE CHOSEN

Thanks Extremezone."
,educuba,2011-04-08T21:08Z,"dude, theres no option to choose english anywhere in either setup or autorun, THIS SHIT IS IN.......... ""R U S S I A N"""
,Pluup,2011-04-19T07:06Z,"Guys, if you want to change the language of the game, just edit the ""setup.ini"" file. You see, all Windows PC games have language coding. See more about it here: 

http://147.91.177.212/unicode/www.unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/languages.html

If you explore the CD upon mounting, you'll find a file called ""setup.ini"". Open this with notepad, and search for the following (located at bottom): 

[Languages]
Default=0x0019
count=1
key0=0x0019

Remember that site I mentioned before with the list of codes? Just edit the ""0x0019"" code with the language code you want. So if you want english, you replace ""0x0019"" with ""0x0009"". Save the .ini file, and them finally run setup.exe--now in the language you've chosen. 

Risen [MULTI5] comes in five languages: EspaĂÂąol, English, French, Italian, and German. 

Don't use any other codes besides those five. "
,Pluup,2011-04-22T20:39Z,"I suppose another method would to just download the ""Data"" folder of the following torrent and place it into a installed Risen directory. 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5113003/Risen_%5BEnglish_language%5D

(don't bother redownloading the game, JUST download the ""Data"" folder)"
,storykilla,2011-09-27T18:39Z,"Trying to download a forgotten patch 1.01 to make it in english!
Hellova lot of work to fix from russian to english. 
Wish it was English straight away... But hell we are not buying these things ... so might as well work for it."
,kuske93,2012-05-02T19:02Z,Thanks a lot buddy.Much appreciated.
,kusss,2012-05-08T15:45Z,"But if I want to change thi setup.ini file I have re-write it on dvd-image, yes? How to do it?"
,kusss,2012-05-08T15:46Z,I ment overwrite it.
