,fetpipan,2011-12-05T23:53Z,English subs would make me so happy
,chughtai,2011-12-19T10:49Z,"+1 to the english subtitles!

Any ideas where to get?

p.s. anyone owns the french dvd (does that one has english subtitles?)"
,fetpipan,2011-12-19T15:32Z,"I would not trust that a french dvd would contain eng subs.

I know that this documentary has been on youtube, then removed due to copyright claim by the stupid french company.

So it definately exist a version with eng subs.

I have found this interview on some french website, but it contained no subtitles.

Maybe one has to start study french..."
