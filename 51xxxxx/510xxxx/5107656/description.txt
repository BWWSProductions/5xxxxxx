"Nu, pogodi!", "Well, Just You Wait!" or "You Just Wait!") is a Soviet/Russian animated series produced by Soyuzmultfilm. The series was created in 1969 and became a popular cartoon of the Soviet Union. Additional episodes have been produced in Russia since 2006.
The series follows the comical adventures of an artistic and mischievous wolf trying to catch (and presumably eat) a hare. The series usually takes place in Moscow, but other episodes have been set in other places in the Soviet Union and beyond (an example would be an "exotic island" in Episode #17). Like Tom and Jerry, the series has additional characters that usually either help the hare or interfere with the wolf's plans.
