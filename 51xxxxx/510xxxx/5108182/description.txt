Unreported World uncovers a deepening sectarian conflict between Muslims and Christians in the Philippines. The battle for land on the southern Filipino island of Mindanao has already claimed 100,000 lives and created a humanitarian disaster with 600,000 people being driven from their homes.

Reporter Peter Oborne and director George Waldrum arrive in Cotobato City just after a blast has injured nine people, eight of them young children. Locals claim the attack was carried out by the Filipino national army. The area has been the scene of six bomb attacks in 2009 and, just weeks before, a device exploded outside the cathedral on a Sunday morning, killing six, including a 12-year-old boy. The security forces blame the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, a long-standing Muslim separatist movement, which they claim has formed links to the Indonesian terror network behind the 2002 Bali bombs.

Unlike the rest of the Philippines, which is officially Christian, Mindanao has been a predominantly Muslim island for centuries. But the arrival of Christian settlers after World War II has led to escalating sectarian conflict....edit
