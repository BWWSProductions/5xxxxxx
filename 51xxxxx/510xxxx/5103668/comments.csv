,rhmum,2009-09-29T04:11Z,how you gonna bitch about there not being enough seeders when it was just fucking uploaded? get a life. have some respect and learn how BT works.
,tnvideo,2009-09-29T04:25Z,"Hamerynn, you are a waste of bandwidth, new torrent, popular torrent and you are f'ing clueless, gtfo..."
,Peatythedog,2009-09-29T04:32Z,Hope you don't get tired of hearing it but thanks a ton as always.
,flarngus,2009-09-29T04:58Z,"I agree, this torrent is downloading a bit too slow.  I've been downloading it for the past hour and it has not surpassed 0.5 KB/s.  This and The Big Bang Theory have been relatively slow."
,ericinsurgent,2009-09-29T05:35Z,thanks!!!
,icecool2k,2009-09-29T05:36Z,How come the TPB doesnt have last weeks ep? i totally missed the start of this season for that reason but now have a double helping to watch :)
,jgoodwin27,2009-09-29T06:25Z,"hamerynn and flarngus need to learn how bittorrenting works.


Anyways thanks a lot eztv, love your uploads, downloading this one currently, and i'm assuming its going to be the same high quality i've learned to expect from you. Thanks."
,AbsolutZero,2009-09-29T06:32Z,"I'm sure this is a great torrent as always, but this is the second week in a row that I've tried to get this and have gotten 0 seed and 0 leechers.

Thanks eztv!"
,MaxThruput,2009-09-29T07:03Z,"Since the season opener was epis 1 & 2, I believe this is mislabeled.  I believe it should be House.S06E03.Epic.Fail.REAL.HDTV.Xvid-FQM.avi.

Not complaining - thanks as always, EZTV - just want to make sure there is no confusion.

I'll go back to lurking now..."
,sateef,2009-09-29T07:07Z,so where is S06E01 then?

,Damien74,2009-09-29T15:02Z,"This is episode 3, not 2. No wonder I couldn't find ep 3 :/"
,Damien74,2009-09-29T15:07Z,"It's a good thing we're a team here.. 
10 online of 3500 available, 25Kb/s lol.
Not whining, I'll have it eventually, but I can't stop thinking about the ego of some ppl :D"
,davidindehar,2009-09-29T16:47Z,"Thanks man, fuckin love you."
,Mantrhax,2009-09-29T16:55Z,prudppackethandlerexception:transport unavailable  weird problem
,FFSsmeppl,2009-09-29T17:43Z,Is This episode 2 or 3???
,FFSsmeppl,2009-09-29T17:51Z,Yes indeed this is episode 3 guys keep it together i kno math sux but stil...
,TOM-12,2009-09-29T18:48Z,No this is 2 episode cos 1 episode was premiere and it is 2hour long (fox tv)
,Fox_Almighty,2009-09-29T19:09Z,"This one is episode 2, Epic Fail. I don't know why EZTV called the first one episode 1 and 2.

Thanks for the upload."
,Tysss,2009-09-29T19:11Z,"I would say that the previous episode was 0 and 1, and this is episode 2"
,sizzlemc,2009-09-29T21:19Z,"Yeah I'm getting a pretty slow download here too. It's downloading quicker than the 720p version of this episode, but that's probably just due to the smaller file size. Once I get these I'll seed the shit out of them for a week."
,Pinkaugust,2009-09-30T04:44Z,"@ hamerynn - My god, how clueless are you?
@ flarngus - Same IQ as that dl-speed, I see....

Thanks for the upload EZTV, you really made my night!"
,Stein-Clown,2009-09-30T10:38Z,Episode one was a double episode but it was the nr:1 episode this season!
,TheArtz19,2009-09-30T14:44Z,thank you ez
,isisx3,2009-10-01T17:13Z,thank you eztv.

,fisherbim,2009-10-05T03:38Z,"kudos eztv!
and thanks to the guy who gave the link to the premiere ep.
thank you all.
house rules!"
,traloth,2009-10-29T13:29Z,"Cheers to eztv and all you seeders. But, more importantly, have I been popping too much Vicodin of late or did someone on here actually admit to downloading Big Bang Theory? :S "
,traloth,2009-10-29T13:36Z,Ummm maybe I have been popping too much Vicodin. I accidentally rated this torrent down one. Its a long story. But anyway for those playing along at home that rating should be +5.....I'll just go limp into a corner and twirl my cane pensively now and leave left-clicking to the professionals... :S 
,nikia00,2010-02-06T22:15Z,thank you
,23patD,2010-02-19T20:44Z,Does anyone knows when can we download the full season ?
