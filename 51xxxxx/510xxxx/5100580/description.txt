This is one of my favourite Ozzy Osbourne tracks and Zakk Wylde solo's! 

Awesome video back in the day! 

I replaced the audio with the original CD version. (The video's audio was lacking in quality.) 

I also converted it from 4:3 to true widescreen 16:9 ratio which looks much better IMHO. 

Video taken from the "Don't Blame Me" DVD. 

*PAL VERSION (mpg)

Can be easily converted to DVD.
