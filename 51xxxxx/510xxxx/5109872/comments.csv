,7331,2010-01-12T14:33Z,Is there any way to change the resolution to something above 1280x1024? I have a FullHD (1920x1080) Monitor and it's kinda ugly with such a small resolution... Any ideas?
,johnramb,2010-01-14T00:49Z,"does someone know how to adjust it widescreen? thanks in advance.

*my resolution is 1280x800"
,Mx-Man,2010-01-24T03:53Z,"Would be nice to know it's intel only without having to wait for someone to comment about it.  Saying Snow Leopard compatible just doesn't cut it.  I'm seeding this slow d/l anyway!  Hopefully it'll be faster for the next guy.

,psbehnke,2010-01-24T04:21Z,"When I launch the game, the speakers on my MacBook Pro make a sharp crack sound and then don't work.  Is anyone else getting this problem?"

,Bobthedeadly,2010-01-26T22:47Z,"Works well on:

New, Unibody White Macbook with
2.26 GHz Processor
4 GB RAM DDR3
500 GB HD (not that that's relevant, but this game isn't small if you have a lotta stuff like I do)
I hardly experience any slowdown, only sometimes a tiny bit when I turn a corner sharply.

Also...
When I play it while plugged in, the game runs perfectly. However, every time I try to start it while I'm unplugged, the game hangs at the first loading screen. I can't cmd+tab out of it or quit, and I can't force quit, so I have to force a shutdown on the whole machine. Is anyone else having this problem?

Other than that, great torrent.

Seeded over 5X the download but then had to delete it."
,strikeaholic,2010-01-28T02:05Z,"I just downloaded it and it won't open. I click on it to open and for a quick second it shows it up top in the toolbar then goes away and doesn't open. Anybody know why that's happening? I have it downloaded on an exterior hard-drive, does that make a difference?"
,TwisterB.,2010-02-01T20:58Z,pleasee seeeeeeed! getting slow speed
,thorshji,2010-02-02T18:45Z,"It took me about 7-8 hours to download this torrent. ( runs on 200 '+/-' kb/s )

Torrent is great EXCEPT two things. 
It is a bit laggy when you do sharp turns in high speed.
and the resolution is only 1024 x 768. 
'4:3'
... and that really sucks..

But the game is still enjoyable and to be honest I do not take notice of it when I am playing.

I will be seeding this for about a week.  (Y)"

Otherwise, for all those having other problems, sorry, I don't know how to solve them, but good luck."

,Aetheora,2011-02-06T18:29Z,"Wow, I am so happy! It works perfectly on my Mac! Thank you! =D

Only 1 problem, and I'd LOVE a reply... How do I get it out of fullscreen? (If I can)

I feel a little inconvenienced by the fact that it won't let me, so... Is it possible?"
,Aetheora,2011-02-07T00:59Z,"For those who don't want fullscreen, I figured it out! (With a little help from the comments box for the NFSUnderground Mac torrent)

Just go to Users/Library/Preferences/Cider X3 Preferences

Then open the Config file with Textedit, and scroll down until you find ""FullScreen"" = ""1"" (About halfway down the page) and set the number to 0, and viola! No more fullscreen!

Enjoy fellow racers!"

Also, the shadow detail is super low, as killingspree said, so on some streets its hard to see. Any fixes that anyone knows?"
,iPhacx,2011-03-17T04:18Z,Thanks for the upload. Download went smoothly. Unzipped the game. Played a little and it SUCKED. I'm not blaming the uploader for that. All I can blame is the game.
