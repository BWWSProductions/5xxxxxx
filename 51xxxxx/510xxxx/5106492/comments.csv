,robbo86,2009-10-02T08:59Z,I meant as an avi file it works well but when converting the lip sync goes well out.
,isepiq,2009-10-02T11:00Z,"Are you using ConvertXtoDVD to convert your files to DVD Format?  That usually never has sync issues.
Also check the codecs you are using.  You should have only these 3 installed in this order:
1. FFDShow 2009 version
2. Haali's Matroska Splitter
3. AC3 Filter
Use all default install settings, & ONLY fool with AC3 Filter to get more audio volume.
IMHO
