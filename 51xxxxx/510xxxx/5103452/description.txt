"Live 2003" is a live-album released by Coldplay in 2003. it contains a DVD and a audio-CD. the CD contains only 12 of the 17 songs performed by Coldplay on the DVD. i extracted the audio from the DVD and split it into 17 tracks. the tracks are 
gap-less. meaning when the tracks are played in a sequence, the end of each song matches perfectly with the beginning of the next song. this gives the experience of listening to the entire concert without any breaks. this is a beautiful concert. it's meant to be heard this way.
