@msbisht

What will you do after the 90 days expires?"
,b0rn1337,2009-09-26T14:26Z,"I'm with lkadar, can we still use this after 90 days? Meaning can we just simply un-install it and re-install it again so it'll be good for another 90 days?"
[T],msbisht,2009-09-26T15:02Z,"No, You cant simply uninstall it after 90 days and installing it again to get 90 days again..
May be the Purge function of BOX's NTR can allow you to install it again after 90 days.."
,dreamcasts,2009-09-27T00:03Z,"I'm guessing that there will be a working trial reset released in the next three months, which will reset the OEM back to 90 days.

If not, you'll have to find a different OEM to install for another 90 days in three months time. "

,torrentaddictp,2010-03-04T20:07Z,"hi guys... this is how u can use the NIS again-

1. Uninstall NIS when it reaches 89 days.
2. Use BOX's NTR to purge ur recycle bin.
3. Install NIS newly.
4. Install BOX's NTR to reset da days to 90.
  repeat this every time it reaches 89 days.

Also to stop NIS from scanning the NIS & NTR folders & removing dem, goto-
      NIS settings> computer settings> scan exclusions 'configure' & select the NIS & NTR folders. Norton wont delete the files den...

This has worked for me & i hav already reset the NIS once after 90 days expiry..."
,torrentaddictp,2010-03-04T20:11Z,"@ Zakafein  
 this doesnt work on NOD 32 man...BOX's NTR is exclusively for Norton products an NOD 32 is NOT norton...also this is an internet security so it protects u from the net & viruses..."
,miloo111,2010-03-20T23:02Z,"hey guys, you can reinstall NIS 2010 the official way without using any sort of cracks. Here's how:

1) Download Revosetup (Uninstaller)
2) unistall NIS 2010 using Revosetup
3) Download Norton Removal Tool
4) Run Norton Removal tool
5) Reinstall NIS 2010

Now the other methods our dear friends have posted works too, but this is a totally official method with no cracks and totally legal! :D"
