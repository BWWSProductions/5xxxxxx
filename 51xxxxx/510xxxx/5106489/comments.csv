,maheswar,2009-10-06T23:59Z,"Im always a great fan of Secretmyth. Because you give us great quality in small file sizes. No disrespect but not sure what others are complaining about coz i am d\l ing at 6o kbps on my humble 0.5 Mbps connection.
But this time Secretmyth, SAMNhaNc3's rip is much superior than this on almost the same filesize!

Thanks King"
,ask_romi,2009-10-11T08:28Z,"Thanks a lot secret myth..Your rips are the best considering size, audio (5.1) and video..

One request please always rip the audio in 5.1 it gives extra pleasure in watching movie...
"
,ask_romi,2009-10-11T08:31Z,"Really this is the best movie I enjoyed watching in 5.1 surround sound
and the video clarity is superb....
Keep it up secret myth...."
,ask_romi,2009-10-11T12:18Z,"The movie plays best in KMplayer, In GOM player 5.1 doesn't work properly for mp4 format, if it does, the sound goes off after playing sometime. VLC is also another good option... BUT KMplayer is the best.."
