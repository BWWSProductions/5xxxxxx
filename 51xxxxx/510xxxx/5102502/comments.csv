,brillmann,2009-09-28T02:26Z,Thanks
,Zenotek,2009-09-28T02:37Z,"No problem. Took me forever to get this thing. :P

And sorry for the slow upload speed you guys, my internet is kind of limited. Hopefully more people will start seeding and the speed will pick up soon."
,3261dan,2009-10-07T01:32Z,"included crack doesn't work, after updating and applying your crack it now wants to connect to the internet to authorize the copy.

Thanks for the sentiment though."
,3261dan,2009-10-07T01:36Z,"Looks like this is the copy you need to get :  

//www(dot)mininova(dot)org/det/2969971

 Its the same torrent but it contains the crack instead of a standard exe."
,Zenotek,2009-10-25T01:38Z,"Oh, nuts. Apparently I accidentally uploaded the real .exe instead of the cracked 1.05 .exe. Sorry about that. =/"
,sunshine420,2009-12-08T00:47Z,"can i assume that if i got the spore/creepy and cute from here that updates spore to 1.02 that I just install this on top of it, right? or will I lose creepy and cute?"
,TekHex,2009-12-12T12:37Z,"Go to this link, Mininova has a policy thing.
Seed this link... sorry Zenotek.

all credit goes to well.. an unknown person.. idk how to find the uploader name"
,distrofik,2009-12-16T09:20Z,"This crack will crash the game if I have Galactic Adventures installed, won't it? I.e. I can't apply this crack on Spore GA, and I can't install GA on this patch because GA will return the game to version 1.04... Am I right?"
,amoeba36,2010-01-26T10:03Z,".nfo file doesn't work for me, are the instructions fairly straight-forward? (i.e. could I figure it out on my own?)"
,amoeba36,2010-01-26T10:09Z,"I have just tried what I thought would work (install patch, replace SporeApp). Asked me for registration so I went wrong somewhere.

Can anybody here provide instructions?"
,amoeba36,2010-01-26T10:14Z,"Disregard, I see what went wrong.

Didn't read the comments carefully enough."
,amoeba36,2010-01-26T10:24Z,"Have to pay for cracked app elsewhere.

Please provide cracked?"
,xEp1cAzNx,2010-02-04T01:39Z,if the .nfo file doesnt work delete the .nfo and replace with .txt
,ObsessionPC,2010-02-15T03:01Z,"It's not even your crack, you just found something and uploaded it, trying to take credit for something that does not even work.

Nice try tho....

Shit download, might as well download the original/official patch (faster) and spend some time finding the proper crack....

Just take this torrent off the list, it's useless man."
,Morrowind3,2010-03-07T22:11Z,"Installed And all, But no a-semmetric OR new parts.
omghax? D:"
,ozc,2010-04-08T04:41Z,"----------IN CASE YOU MISSED IT---------
Zenotek said he uploaded the uncracked v1.05 exe by mistake. 
-----------------------------------------------"
,h1vem1nd,2010-04-17T18:48Z,"TekHex, your link requires us to sign up & pay to download.

Can anyone get a working v1.05 patch + crack posted on TPB? I have yet to find one."
,MrTTAO,2010-08-17T10:41Z,"ok, i get it that the poster accidentally uploaded the uncracked version...

but why the hell doesn't he just DELETE this torrent (you can delete torrents you uploaded) and reupload it correctly?

The links to other websites which supposedly have it? they don't work."
,pedocarebear,2011-05-26T10:55Z,it works if already had it cracked> then Patch> Move and Replace crack> and start th game :D
,LordMerkadis,2011-06-02T12:58Z,"For those generations after me who will want to download this pain in ass of a game heed my words and be enlightened:

1. Install Clean v1.0 Spore
2. Install patch v1.5.1
3. Install patch v1.6
4. Install creepy and cute mod
5. install Galactic Adventures

6. WIN!

Found all of this out after i donated some good amount of my blood to this games altar.. Or in other words after god damn annoyingly long ass research, so you better be thankful bitches.

Tested on Vista x64 with gtx nvidia 8800
The problem was apparently in the v1.5.1 patch if u install this bitch on top of GA mod it messes it up making the animation static aka non-moving-shit. I couldn't bring myself to play static shit so i had to go researching p_p"
,Gh057man,2011-07-25T02:04Z,"@LordMerkadis
Thanks for the info (which you seem to have (begrudgingly shared) but .....
http://spore.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.06 states that patch 1.06  should be installed AFTER Galactic Adventures. Who does one believe?"
