IS IT THE FINAL RELEASE OF FIFA 10??????

PLEASE CONFIRM COS ONCE I DOWNLOADED THE SIMS 3 BY RAZOR1911...
and it was also released before the official date....and it turned out to be a older release not the final official version.....i hope u can understand this cos 5.5gb means a lot time and space...so can u please confirm this??? or better wait for the reloaded release???"

Thanks for Sharing
Keep on uploading

It sure works and i enjoy it.

Seems like there is some minor graphic issues in FIFA10 - brightness often change and low quality graphics.

But the type of gameplay is great.

I owe AiTB something. :)"

,sserene,2009-10-08T06:26Z,This obviously isn't the full version because there is no wage budget in manager mode. Also there is no whistle when the ball goes out of play just like in the demo. Will obviously have to wait for the reloaded one.
,astra512,2010-01-16T20:47Z,"very good game, thanks"
,narv84,2010-01-28T19:11Z,"This game aint worth it man!. Its boring and shit. Like FIFA 09, not much has changed. Go download something else. This is a waste of time. PES is better."
