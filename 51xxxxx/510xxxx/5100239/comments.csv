,4rror,2010-07-21T16:15Z,"Hate to plug my own torrent here, but two people already asked for a version that works on Windows 7.

Symantec Endpoint Protection is the follow-up to Symantec Antivirus. The one I uploaded works on both x86 & x64 versions of Windows 7 and Vista, and on XP too.

Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0.5002.333:
