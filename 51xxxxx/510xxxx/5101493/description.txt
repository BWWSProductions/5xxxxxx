Legend of Dragoon NTSC (psx) encoded for use with psp.

This is all 4 discs in 1 file, I've added a background, custom icon, and background music while hovering over the icon. (It does not repeat, I had problems when I made the sounds repeat) tested by myself through the first save point.

1.15 gigs

Copy eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

Enjoy!!

(If anyone wants this as 4 separate files, I have it also, just don't want to upload without a demand)

If anyone has any problems with the game, or if you want to request a game for upload, you can E-Mail me at iammrfrank@gmail.com
