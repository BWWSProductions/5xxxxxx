,saada245,2009-10-03T21:01Z,I have 2k 10 and i was wondering which one is better? 2K 10 is pretty good but i was wondering if live still has the nba 365 thing. 
,OKcupid,2009-10-03T22:08Z,"Live 10 this year, according to ppl on OperationSports, etc who have already gotten the game, gets simulation-level real stats right out of the box w/o slider tweaking...too bad there's no NTSC out for it yet :("
,OKcupid,2009-10-03T22:10Z,"oh and nba live 365, yeah they expanded that for dynamic season mode (you play alongside the real season and download the real stats, tendencies, dna).  2k10 has a similar thing, called living rosters or something, but don't think 2k improved gameplay enough this year, and My Player mode is weak cause you can only sign one-year contracts o.0"
,lamboleap760,2009-10-04T03:15Z,Thanks for the upload -But It's a waste of time for NTSC guy's. Now I have a DL Coaster.

,lookwhoshere_wow,2010-01-23T13:20Z,"Dude after unraring it ... When i burn the dvd image it says ... ""system file can't be found"" ... What do i do????"

,VieraGamer,2010-08-13T17:30Z,"Waste of time and waste of a disk, not region free."
