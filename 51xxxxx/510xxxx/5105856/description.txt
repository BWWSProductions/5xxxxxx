This version is very hard to find on dvd. It is the original theatrical version ripped from the Warner Bros. 1997 DVD. It is different to both the 25th Anniversary and Version You've Never Seen.

Differnt colour timings are used, Father Karas jumpcut is intact and it has the original stereo soundtrack.
