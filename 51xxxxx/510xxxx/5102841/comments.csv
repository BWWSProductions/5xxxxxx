It works fine for me.
I don't know if you use XP as I do.
Some program comes and go but all the BBC's programs works allright."

[T],ulysses56,2009-09-29T13:26Z,"I'm not an expert but what I do is to launch the program first and entering the number corresponding to the program I want to see and in that way the vlc player is opening by itself. It's so simply...
Good luck"
