,Crustynudger,2009-09-29T05:09Z,"Would someone at eztv KINDLY THINK to include http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce in their torrents? Its fairly obvious that TPB trackers are not coming back online anytime soon.
Catch up eztv!"

[T],tzanev,2009-09-29T09:33Z,Thanks EZTV!
,anonemouse000,2009-09-29T10:39Z,I think something has happened to EZTV's tracker here - I can't DL anything by EZTV at all. Perhaps they have started blocking it in the UK?
,El-Quinto,2009-09-29T14:04Z,"Just sort of uploaded episode 1 and 2. However since I don't really know what I'm doing I failed to categorize it properly in the ""heroes""-section.

But for those interested:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5104065

Also, maybe someone who does know what they are doing can upload it properly and also get it categorized properly."
,lilleild,2009-09-29T15:17Z,Am I the only one who gets this movie x player thing. Is something wrong here. To me this looks like a fake.
,Miau_girl,2009-09-29T16:40Z,"lilleild: As far as I know there isn't such thing as eztv being fake, so I doubt it.

Thanks eztv, always the best!"

,anonimtotal,2009-10-08T19:14Z,"@ castanatm, there are no problems with rds provider in Romania regarding torrents of any sort from any sites. Bafta la depanare, torrentul tau are buguri, reinstaleaza. ;)"
,Jackass Jimm,2009-10-11T04:16Z,"Just saw the episode and instantly thought of N.E.R.D's ""Seeing Sounds"" album, which is all about how Pharrell is seeing sounds.  Maybe the writer of the show likes N.E.R.D."
