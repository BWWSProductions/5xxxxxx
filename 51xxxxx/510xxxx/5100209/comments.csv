,data662,2009-09-25T20:28Z,Is this the rise of an empire one with expansion?
,7stein,2009-09-26T06:52Z,"it is a guess.
you must guess if it is 
either

settlers 1  or
settlers 2  or
settlers 3  or
settlers 4  or
settlers 5  or
settlers 6  or
settlers 2 - next generation  or
settlers 2 - next generation addon  or
settlers 2 - next gerneration - advance of 
                 cultures  or

a combination of these.

well, the chances that it is what you look for are pretty low. however, the upper (obviously either not very experienced or just damn lazy)
wants you to guess.

or download 5 gb and realize after that it is just NOT what you wanted.


ok, now to be honest :
watch what the unexperienced and lazy upper did up else : settlers 5 with 2.x GB

so we can assume this is settlers VI, maybe with addon. just compare what other settlers 6 
ups have as size.

but beware: his other upload, settlers 5, bears the term ""RUS"" in its name, thus also this one MIGHT be russian, and not english.  too bad, if so.

/ADDON/Setup/Bin/Play Settlers 6 - The Eastern Realm.exe
/GAME/Setup/Bin/Play Settlers 6.exe
also there are some eng and ru folders.

but the rest is just guessing"
