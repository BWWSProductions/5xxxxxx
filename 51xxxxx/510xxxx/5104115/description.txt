Just because you give someone an idea for a murder, does that make you responsible for the crime? Crime writer Arthur Upfield (Robert Menzies) believed he was looking for the perfect plot.

But when his friend, Snowy Rowles (Luke Ford), used the same idea to murder three men, Upfield is forced to confront his own role in their deaths. Set in the early years of the Great Depression, this is the true story of two men whose chance conversation takes their lives down very different paths. Arthur Upfield went on to become one of Australia's most successful crime writers, profiting from the publicity surrounding the murder trial. Snowy Rowles was found guilty and executed at the age of 26.
