Forty-eight hours before her wedding, Katrine is the typically stressed bride-to-be. There are the place cards to calligraphy for her over-bearing mother-in-law, the final dress fitting, the bachelorette party, finding the old, the new, the borrowed and the blue. And then there's how to tell her institutionalized suicidal sister she's getting married and how to deal with the reappearance of charming rogue Thomsen, whose sudden disappearance two years earlier drove her sister mad.
