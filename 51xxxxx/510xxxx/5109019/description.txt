Paul Rein - Dance Tracks
Rare tracks to find so I wanted to spread these dance music tracks to others.
Nice music from Paul Rein (Sweden) from late 80's.

These tracks are ripped from a vinyl record from 1987 and still quality is really good (160kbs)! This record is not easy to find and was one of my favorites in the late 80's! :-)

Please behave!!! :-)


Grymt nostalgisk musik fÃ¶r mig som lyssnade pÃ¥ dessa go'a lÃ¥tar fÃ¶r typ 20 Ã¥r sedan... kul att hitta skivan i garderoben!
