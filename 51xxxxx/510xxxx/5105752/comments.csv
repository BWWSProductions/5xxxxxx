,celebi23,2009-09-30T23:11Z,Thank you.  Just wondering why there are no seeders??
[V],harry711,2009-09-30T23:23Z,"I am seeding, initial seed, and it is also hashing the torrent still, be patient ^_^"
,TheSpenner,2009-10-01T02:09Z,Way cool! I just d/l'd the 720p version and will have to replace it with this!
[V],harry711,2009-10-01T04:17Z,"@ProfessorSocks: this is the best and prefect release, in my opinion. It looks perfect to me."
,johnniebrasco,2009-10-01T04:55Z,seems like there's something wrong with the aspect ratio. everyone gets a little shorter and fatter? or is it just me? Thanks to Harry anyway!
[V],harry711,2009-10-01T05:21Z,"@ProfessorSocks: I'm the only skuller who has posted here XD
I think that those problems were fixed after the telesyncs, this is a BDrip, it should be fine.

@johnniebrasco: it may be your monitor res or something, it looks fine for me. Anyone else feel free to comment about AR."
,johnniebrasco,2009-10-01T05:39Z,"hehe, i'm really not sure anymore, maybe it was just one guy with a long face. The quality is great though, as expected from 1080p"
[V],harry711,2009-10-02T01:09Z,"I'm seeding at full speed, Capt'n, sorry if it is going a bit slow, welcome to public torrents. More people who limit their upload-speed down, the slower the entire swarm goes."
,Ares-The-Wreckless,2009-10-02T01:23Z,PLZ SEED i am trying this one cause the 720p will take a week the seeding is horrible on this one AND transformers 2
,ronnieonetime,2009-10-02T09:11Z,"I'm connected to 2 seeders out of 105, and I'm connected to 95 leechers out of 3247. My downlaod speed is only 400KB/s because most of you have NO IDEA how to manges your P2P client. OR, you just don't give a fuck about being a good citizen. I'm seeding this at 1MB/s!! Open up your bandwidth people!"
,ronnieonetime,2009-10-02T18:07Z,"I don't watch 1080p content on my pc, I use Popcorn Hour to stream the file to my 58"" home theater. AND THIS LOOKS AND SOUNDS AWESOME! GREAT JOB!"
,TheSpenner,2009-10-02T20:06Z,"Professor - this is 1080p and 13M bitrate, the one you're linking to is 720p and 2M bitrate. I think for those of us who'll be viewing this on a big screen would prefer to wait to dl this high def one. Though, yeah, if you're gonna watch on a small screen you don't need this 13GB download."
,ronnieonetime,2009-10-03T14:46Z,"Hello again. You worthless cunts out there that don't manage your p2p client properly should fuck off and die. Maybe that's too drastic, but: OPEN YOUR UPLOAD SPEED YOU CUNTS! I'm connected to 97 peers and seeders combined, yet I'M only GETTING 500kb/ps FOR A DOWNLOAD SPEED? That's 10 times faster than dail-up people! . Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! I'm uploading at 16Mb/s. 16Mb/s = 16,000Kb/s. That means that, I, alone, am seeding 32 times faster than 97 of you worthless cunts combined. Get with the program!"
,ronnieonetime,2009-10-03T14:49Z,KILL THE LEECHES!
,nlfc4life,2009-10-03T18:42Z,"Just so you know.

Not everyone has an incredibly high upload speed. It's is very rare where I live to find an ISP that sells broadband with decent upload speed. At the moment my Down speed is 20Mb/s and Up Speed is 1.3mb/s; so unless every person downloading this file lives in a country where ridiculous up and down speeds are commonly available you won't get the best speed. 

Also when did moaning get things done?"
,frenchyd252,2009-10-03T20:27Z,"Well said nlfc4life

Lol lucky bastards! i get a pathetic 3.9 megabits down and 0.38 megabits up beat that! which works out at bout 400 KBytes down and 45 KBytes up.  Anyway i am not downloading this at the mo because im currently seeding another torrent, but i will be when im done with that"
,onegreatguy,2009-10-03T20:53Z,"Not to bitch or anything, but how the hell do you guys get 400k download speed?  I've been downloading since the torrent came out and I still have 24 hours to go! And I have no speed constraints on my computer either..."
,frenchyd252,2009-10-03T22:05Z,no thats not the speed im getting im jus saying thats my max bandwidth i can get. im not downloading this at the mo neway but if i was i probably wouldnt be getting nowhere near that
,onegreatguy,2009-10-04T03:26Z,"OK, ronnieonetime, what ARE the proper utorrent settings, IYHO?  I'd be more than happy to set it up just as you say...."
,moshster,2009-10-04T03:29Z,"I too hope this has the full credit crawl.  I hate it when credits are cut off.  Movies should be ripped in their entirety.

If this one is complete movie, thanks for the up."
,ronnieonetime,2009-10-04T05:58Z,"GREAT JOB harry711!!

This is AWESOME. Thanks!

I've seeded this to a 12 ratio.

Seed like a good citizens people. Manage your p2p client, and increase your upload speeds."
,moshster,2009-10-04T10:46Z,"@ronnieonetime, could please confirm if the movie is complete with entire credit crawl at the end? thx"
,TheSpenner,2009-10-06T21:42Z,Yes it's complete through the very end of the credits.
,pantigana,2009-10-09T16:52Z,"The resoultion of this movie is NOT what it says in the torrent title/info and i'm surprised that no one said it after so many downloads.

Video resolution is 1920x800, so it's NOT true 16:9 and it's obviously NOT 1080p. "
,ionpop,2009-10-10T00:06Z,@pantigana: the rest up to 1080p is black bars. No point in encoding those ...
,s2k4,2009-10-10T14:53Z,"can someone pls tell me what program i should use to see 1080p BluRay movies?
its lagging when i watch it with VLC player and the sound is out of sinc when i use Zoom Player.
720p works fine on those prog, but not 1080p.
Please help!"
,VonNegga,2009-10-27T16:31Z,"Some people actually watch the credits?  Personally, I'd rather see the extra bits distributed throughout the rest of the movie, but whatever."
,PanzrKunst,2009-12-22T15:10Z,"There is indeed an Aspect Ratio issue: the 1080p video has been crushed to 800p.
Does anyone know a player to force video resolution?"
,taz.uk,2010-01-14T03:39Z,"can you please seed its been download under 20kpbs for 3 days now
terrible speeds on the last 2 gb.
i hope this is not a shit aspect ratio, from what ive read i think it wont be stretched to fit the screen and have huge black lines at top and bottom
anyway ill comment once dl finishes which will prob be a week or 2"
,VonNegga,2010-08-22T11:36Z,"@PanzrKunst There is no ""aspect ratio issue"" - the movie plays beautifully.  1080p refers to the resolution of the entire 16:9 screen.  This movie has an aspect ratio of 2.4:1, which means there are going to be black bars at the top and bottom of every frame of video.  When people re-encode these movies for online distribution these black areas are cropped away because it's unnecessary to waste bits encoding something that's always black throughout the entire movie, when the player can add these bars itself (depending on your display device).  These are very elementary concepts in the world of video encoding and it would behoove you to do a little bit of research so that you actually know what you're talking about before you go making ignorant comments."
,Shadeux,2010-12-15T05:02Z,"I just downloaded the sample to try it out, and it seems just fine to me. Maybe a LITTLE squashed, but nothing that makes the movie unbearable to watch. a/v both are 10!"
,hirador,2011-05-19T22:08Z,Please seed fellow trekkies (and non-trekkies)
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-05-23T14:38Z,"I know it's a little late in the day since the question was asked, but the best player for HD is KM Player. And it's entirely free!"
