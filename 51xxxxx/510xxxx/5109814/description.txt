Crookers are dj Phra and Bot; two italian dj's/producers who met in 2003 and soon got to work together as they had the same tastes and a similar musical background.

Both have been producing and djing on their own before creating the Crookers team: Bot was introduced to music learning to play instruments like piano and guitar and then moved to synths, turntables and sequencers while Phra started djing at the early age of 11 and then was introduced to the italian Hip Hop scene as an Mc.

All these influences are mixed up in their sets with the special add of their sounds done with the legendary MPC sampler.
