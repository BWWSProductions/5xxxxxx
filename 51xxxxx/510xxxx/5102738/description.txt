Miranda Taylor Cosgrove (born May 14, 1993) is an American teen actress and singer. She is best known for her roles as Megan Parker in Drake and Josh, Summer Hathaway in School of Rock and Carly Shay in iCarly.

Her career began at the age of three when she was spotted by an agent while singing and dancing in a restaurant. She was signed up for a number of small roles in commercials.

Cosgrove made her music debut in 2007, singing the theme song for iCarly called Leave It All to Me, which features her former Drake and Josh co-star, Drake Bell and written by Drake's fellow band member. On June 10, 2008 the soundtrack to iCarly was released, including Leave It All to Me and three other songs, including the next singles, the cover of Amy Diamond's song Stay My Baby, and About You Now, originally by the Sugababes, and another track called "Headphones On".
