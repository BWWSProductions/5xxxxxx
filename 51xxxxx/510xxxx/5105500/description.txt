Rivette's second film, made in 1965, was a surprising departure, adapting Diderot's famous Enlightenment novel, La Religieuse, for the screen. Rivette cast Godard's wife and muse, Anna Karina, in the main role of Suzanne Simonin. The film is a faithful adaptation of Diderot's novel, in which a young woman is cast into a life of torment in a French convent by her father, and battles for her freedom. La Religieuse has its powerful moments, and Karina's performance is exemplary, but the film suffers from a mannered, studied quality unusual to Rivette's body of work. In a sense, La Religieuse is a throwback to the â€œcinema of qualityâ€ of the 1940s, wholly stylized and mostly predictable, a crowd-pleasing film with none of the blazing, white-hot ingenuity that marks the best of Rivette's work. Still the film was a succÃ¨s de scandale of sorts upon its release, being banned for two years for its unsympathetic portrayal of the tyrannical rule of the Catholic Church (and allegorically, one could say, the Gaullist government, then in power).
