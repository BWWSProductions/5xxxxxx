,mrsinn1,2009-09-29T23:26Z,when is the season dvd out?
,Lootski,2009-09-30T00:25Z,"So far it's been 2 days and this torrent and also the cleveland show have not moved a single %...

 When I look @ the tracker information in my torrent program it says one of 2 things: connection closed by peer, and invalid url.  WTF?  I got THIS exact torrent so why doesn't it work? Update tracker doesn't help either...

The weird thing is that other TPB torrents seem to work; only these 2 eztv ones don't...

Is anyone else getting something like this?"
,Legalize_weed,2009-09-30T02:17Z,Yes i am having that same problem please tell us what we need to do

,avatar2012,2009-09-30T16:13Z,"Thanks for the upload - 
If the trackers not working (PB trackers have been offline around here for weeks) maybe add some working trackers to the torrent - like
