ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

The first lady of gospel is back with a new label, a new look and a new sound. With eleven Grammy Awards, seven Dove Awards and ten Stellar Awards, Shirley Caesar launches her own label, Shu-Bel Music in partnership with Artemis Gospel. One of gospel musicâ€™s most beloved divas brings you a soul stirring, foot stomping, and church clapping CD that is sure to move both gospel and non-gospel listeners, in this live studio recording. Shirley Caesar and Tonex deliver a groundbreaking performance where traditional gospel meets hip hop with the song I Know the Truth. "Working with Pastor Caesar was nothing short of amazing" says Tonex of his experience recording with Shirley Caesar, "People are going to be so surprised to see just how relevant she is even in the 21st century." The story songs that have become a trademark for Pastor Caesar are also captured in I KNOW THE TRUTH with songs like Jailbird and Every Day Is Like Motherâ€™s Day.
