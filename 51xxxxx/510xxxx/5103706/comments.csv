No, actually I get a really strong feeling that it'll probably be you that'll fall upon the Lord's punishment.  Dare I be so bold as to suggest that you read Romans 10:9 -- it might just save your sole!"

What are you, a complete idiot?  I'm talking about readin' your Bible son.  And I'm talking about possibly starting with Romans 10:9.

Something strikes me as odd.  How many torrents have you bothered to try and upload here, or anywhere else for that matter?  Yup, just as I suspected, none!  How many have I uploaded?  100's and 100's in the past few months alone.  That makes you a complete user of the system.  Feeding off of others as it were.  Ironically, I think you're also a user when it comes to most everything else in general.  Don't you have something better to do with your time today than martyr your self-rightous 'n pathetic cause against Christians?

To me, you're completely useless.  Your words will go unheard, yet you'll still feel some sort of misguided pride to anything meaningful in this conversation.  Thankfully for you though, somehow by the Grace of God, Jesus still loves you."
