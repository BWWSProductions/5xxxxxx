,sierraxr28,2009-09-30T14:11Z,"Kind of reminded me of The Thing, to be honest a little predictable, but if you have spare time go for it. Quality though was excellent and many thanks. See guys a comment with no foul language, abusive to other people or negativity, it's easy... try it. Thanks again."

M - 3"
,thayk,2009-10-20T04:08Z,You know Val Kilmer is a Julliard-trained actor. Hes one of the best crops. I wonder why he settle for predictable projects like this...sorry state.
,BC604,2009-10-23T22:48Z,This is the fucking worst movie i've ever seen..seriously the worst.. I couldn't even get through 20mins before i throw up
,burtholez13,2009-10-24T07:22Z,What are you Haters talking about.... The movie wasnt that bad .. its more about the message.. but i guessing you all didnt get it .. 
,sinaifloyd,2009-10-26T17:20Z,WTF...I thought the movie was pretty damn good! V-9 A-9
,tedk32,2009-11-08T19:25Z,"I have to say that I found the movie to be fairly interesting however, the only thing I found wrong with it was the title, You have it listed as The Thaw but in the opening credits it is listed as Frozen. Just food for thought there. Other then that

Overall: 8/10
Picture: 8/10
Audio: 9/10

Thanks for the ul and keep them coming. :p"
,random-critic,2009-11-13T15:38Z,"Better than it sounds, better than it looks.

,walken007,2010-01-04T17:44Z,"Some of the people are freaking insane or just too dumbatized from watching Twilight and choosing teams. I would like to say f%&$ you to all the shi7heads that said this movie is predictable, or in some way awful to watch. This is a good horror movie that kept me in suspense for the whole duration, it is scary and the story is well thought of. I'm glad I didn't listen to these New Moon fools that only watch and like what the commercials tell them to watch and like, and i downloaded and watched it."
,doggle,2010-01-06T05:41Z,the audio and video were ok........the movie itself is fucking horrible.........glad i didn't pay to see this pos............
,fantomscribla,2010-04-20T02:57Z,"The thing about some people is that what they consider bad just isn't their taste, i honestly find it was great..."
,torrent_reviewer,2010-05-23T16:53Z,"A=9/10
V=9/10

Movie = 6/10

If you are a very serious type movie watcher, then this is not for you. But, if you don't mind the director taking liberty to entertain you for 2 hours by his wildest thought, then it's pretty good. I enjoyed the movie."
,Snaffer,2010-06-30T22:59Z,"I thought the movie was funny

it such a fucking stupid movie
but yet
cool to watch

i'd even watch it again"
,lenindve,2011-08-27T22:17Z,"Good Audio and Video. Nice Work.
And yes, Is a predictable movie, but not bad.  
There are worse movies than this out there."
