This is exactly what you would see under Photoshop CS3 for making gifs.

Its very good though! The Serial works and all."

I have Photoshop CS4 and I don't know how to make GIFs on there, so hopefully this will be a more simple solution. 
Again, thank. c:"

[T],MelloYello,2010-01-23T05:53Z,When I install it goes to the screen to enter the serial number.  My name is already typed in and the brand of my computer is already typed in.  The serial number is blank.  I type it in and it says it's invalid.  Why is my name and computer brand already typed in?????  Pretty simple but serial number doesn't work not sure why.

,petewills,2010-06-17T19:42Z,"Good quick download, man.  My orig copy didn't have the special effects nor the really useful pdf manual.  You can get additional free effects from the Ulead site, ArtTexture, FantasyWarp and Particle, 769 free pics and 44 free fonts.  Loads of free Photoshop plugins available.  Easy to use, impressive. Thanks for 'extras'. "
,weaping_reaper,2011-03-13T21:10Z,"No virus, but I'll be dammed if the program works, ya try to open a video file and it says wahhh, I cant find it.. or WAAAAAAH video could not be read. every single fuckin video I try to open, the program starts crying."
,weaping_reaper,2011-03-13T22:58Z,"Okay, after I stopped my own crying, I finally figured this out, It has to be strictly AVI files, If you try to import any other format, it's just gonna start crying."
,weaping_reaper,2011-03-22T04:23Z,"I really HATE This program, and I'm not saying that lightly. I have tried and tried and tried and tried to use this bullshit, but the little fucker doesn't know what it wants... Ya see, I have this thing called a ""Video converter"" and I just spent the last hour converting 1 little 10 second video into ALL forms of video.. and guess what... This bullshit program wouldn't open any of them.. At first I thought it only opens AVI, but I converted my video into like, 10 types of AVIs and nope!.. So if you only want this program to convert video files into .GIFs .. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS! because it's not gonna work for you!"
,caseybar,2011-05-17T01:02Z,"@weaping_reaper
this is an image animator for .gif files, not a video converter jeezus.
if u want a good video converter look up xilisoft video converter
Also, way to live up to your name :P"
,caseybar,2011-05-17T01:09Z,actually it does support importing and exporting .avi files O.o
,1TWISTED,2011-06-02T17:51Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"

,fahzakpon,2012-03-21T12:03Z,thanks alot man. ultimate tool for housewife and leg in leningrad's chimp!
,xntryk2,2012-05-07T16:06Z,Wow I remember downloading this ten years ago at version 3. It was so good that few changes were needed. I think Corel bought it but no Idea what happened to it after that. They still have the Ulead name attached to a few. Uploader you are probably long gone and grow up now but thanks...
,anonyboy,2012-07-08T13:04Z,have always used this old program to make gifs out of videos. thanks for keeping it seeded.
