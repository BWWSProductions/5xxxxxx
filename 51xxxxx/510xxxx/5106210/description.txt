The music video was released on August 28th 2009. It shows Mary in different scene's with neon lights in most of them, Drake is shown rapping alone and in front of Mary. The video has shown major success on 106 & Park battling for the number 1 spot daily. Anthony Mandler directed the video.

Blige told Angie Martinez on her New York radio show that this song introduces the world to "Crazy Mary." Blige uses Auto-Tune on this song. She explained why to Martinez: "It was for effect. I wanted 'Crazy Mary' to get her shine on. She couldn't get her shine with my regular voice. I used the effect. I used it as a telephone effect or reverb." Mary announced on June 27 that the official release for the single would not be until August 4. Despite her comments, the song was released on iTunes on July 21 for download. Mary later stated on July 24 that July 21 was the official release date for the single.

Stronger is name of the upcoming ninth studio album from American R&B and soul singer Mary J. Blige. The album is scheduled for release in the United States on November 24, 2009 by Geffen Records.
