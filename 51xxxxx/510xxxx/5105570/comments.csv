[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-10-01T01:37Z,thanks extremezone
,fleetkid,2009-10-01T13:49Z,"Works fine. Thanks :)

But if you have already played alien shooter 2 skip this. SIGMA just replaced the alien with zombie both in the title and the game. "
,SweRaider,2009-10-01T18:28Z,are there any improvements compared to alien shooter vengeance except that its in zombie style now
,SweRaider,2009-10-01T18:29Z,whoops didnt see the comment above sry
,Alan00000,2009-10-03T21:11Z,its asking for a code when i click the icon??? help?
,fleetkid,2009-10-04T03:51Z,"@Alan00000:

Did you follow step 3? You have to copy the cracked exe to your installation directory (overwriting the existing one) "
,beartato,2009-10-04T07:02Z,"Okay I'm having a LOT of trouble getting this to work. So it looks like there's supposed to be a crack, but I can't find it for the life of me. 

So I install and it's all fine and dandy but I have no idea what to replace. Is there something in the torrented Skidrow file I'm supposed to substitute into?"
,fleetkid,2009-10-04T07:56Z,"@beartato:

Open the mounted bin(right click on the drive and click explore/open). There browse into the SKIDROW folder. Copy whatever is in there to your installation directory."
,beartato,2009-10-04T23:55Z,"Thanks mate, you're an angel. However I'm getting an error when I try to copy the crack; it says I've got incorrect parameters. 

I'll try to redownload and see if that works. "
,Alan00000,2009-10-05T01:20Z,Yes i did thats why its weird to me.
,pikleking23,2009-10-07T23:58Z,"k lol? This was a pain in the ass and I still never got it to work. I mounted the image onto my hardrive, I replaced the crack with the new one and then bam ""Invalid Paremeters"" Wtf?

And who the hell makes a BIN file instead of a ISO? lmao"
,Alan00000,2009-10-08T16:56Z,"There is no EXE in the skidrow folder to overwrite , Gamecopyworld doesnt have one either.?"
,OmgYouAreSoDead,2009-10-09T23:53Z,"No Speech Folder = No ingame Speech !
I suspect this is because it uses the trial installer then patched with the skidrow exe.
Does anyone else have ingame speech or a link to the full installer with Speech?
Thankyou."
,OmgYouAreSoDead,2009-10-10T08:12Z,"Sorry, Forums say there is no Speech ingame like Alien Shooter 2  :(
I was hoping it was just the installer."
,KOHb,2009-10-10T22:00Z,Works good. Thx
,godlikekiller,2009-10-11T13:11Z,"trojan horse in this file - zombie_shooter2_setup.exe.

not very harmful but can still steal personal info"
,Vonhagen666,2009-10-12T13:32Z,Seed !
,juppeli,2009-10-12T20:39Z,"I ran the setup and it shut down my McAfee and now my computer is running 50% slower... Yet again my holiday goes to hunting down a virus :< . godlikekiller, do you have the exact name of the troijan? It would help me alot. I thought the green skull means that the uploader is trustworthy but wrong again >."
,OverKi11,2009-10-13T00:44Z,"This may be the full game, but it's an ""evaluation copy"", meant for distribution to critics, magazines, etc. 

It seems this version might have problems with vista. For myself, it ran the first few times, then it stopped loading any video. It would just stay black, but I could still roll over the menu options and still hear the sounds and music. 

Anyways, the solution is apparently to set the compatibility mode to windows 98/me on the main exe."
,Lucky13s,2009-10-13T04:55Z,"what is this?

Diablo 2 with guns?"
,Lappers,2009-10-14T13:41Z,wow.. this game really seems to suck x)
,dvallej,2009-10-15T15:31Z,"i crack the game, and when i try to run  the game it says that cant find d3dx9_27.dll and that should try to reinstall, and i have done that, whats wrong?? what can i do?? thx"
,edo08,2009-10-15T18:18Z,overki11 nice one m8 i had same prob but u explore files and on setup icon change compat to 98 and bam it works!
,edo08,2009-10-15T18:48Z,ohhh and also u will need to run as administrator thats what i had to do or u keep getin errors while tryin to install
,Thona78,2009-10-19T14:40Z,"trojan horse in this file - zombie_shooter2_setup.exe

AVG alerts it is the virus and I can't install it anymore. Please help!.........."
,OmgYouAreSoDead,2009-10-31T06:13Z,"Sigma Released a new version with voice actors, i havent tried but maybe you can use the website trial version and patch it with the exe in this release?"
,MINJA_NINJA,2009-11-30T08:44Z,"LOL, normally I dont have a problem with SKIDS DLs but for the life of me I cant find his folder, what should I be opening his bin. file with?

If opening the drive ( I used Daemon) it gives me mount, unmount and eject tray."
,fonakz,2009-12-02T07:55Z,"the crack is not working , can anyone send it to me ,  onak_irs@yahoo.com .. thanks 

the game is already installed and i can't play it.. i copied the file from the skidrow folder which is the application file . but it doesn't work.. thanks"
,MINJA_NINJA,2009-12-02T09:34Z,"Fonakz,

If I had it and it worked I would send it to you."
,MINJA_NINJA,2009-12-03T02:45Z,"Found it, all working :D thanks SKID"

,hel000,2010-05-22T15:40Z,"works like a charm, thanks"
,Frantischek,2010-07-07T20:32Z,"Doesn't work. Crashes on startup (Win 7).

The Game starts correctly however as long as I don't use SkidRows crack.... therefore my hardware is completely compatible with the game. However only the Demo Level works then... There seems to be somethign wrong with the crack.

Any ideas?"
,Frantischek,2010-07-07T20:34Z,doesnt work. game crashes on startup. the skidrow crack seems to be a fail. without crack game starts. but only demo level
,Darktangent10,2010-08-11T06:02Z,Crack works fine for me on XP SP3.  I think your problem is Windows 7.
,AA_tech,2010-11-24T02:51Z,"@edo08
i didnt try the game yet but i know how to fix a prob like that,u should go to where the d3dx9_27.dll file is and the path should be like this: C:\WINDOWS\system32\  find that(use find command CTRL+F) file and delete it and reinstall directx and the missing one u deleted will be replaced and work fine 
hope it helps cheers"
,michaelsk8r,2010-12-22T17:27Z,"doesnt work , error aplication dedx9_27.dll , dont work dont work"
,zengjansen,2011-03-19T14:09Z,"Didn't run... Not on Xp, not on 7. Keeps asking for d3dx9_27.dll... WHY??!!"
,Stasaaaaa,2011-10-15T16:33Z,is this demo 
,nr14,2011-10-29T00:44Z,"Hey honest pirates, please do like I do right now, I'm currently downloading the entire game illegally to see if it's good, if it is I AM going to buy it, if not then I will still play it. If everyone did like me then piracy would not be that big a deal, however it would require that the pirates judge fairly."
,nr14,2011-10-29T01:10Z,"Oh wow, don't even bother, this is a bad, bad game."
,arruu2000,2011-11-01T06:18Z,"Awesome game, as always.
But.... is the DEMO version, guys."
