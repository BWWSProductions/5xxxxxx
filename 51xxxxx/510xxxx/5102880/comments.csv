,Holden_Makok,2009-09-30T03:31Z,not a request just a question when you play Final fantasy 8 does it freeze when casting magic (mostly scan) on you too? i might be doing something wrong
,iammrfrank,2009-09-30T12:00Z,"Final Fantasy VIII of mine does not freeze, but all of my rips are from my own games, and I converted it myself also, I just did a clean install of my OS, so let me get things a little more organized and I'll upload my copy for you. If you have any requests of other games, you can post them, I do have quite a few."
,iammrfrank,2009-09-30T12:07Z,"Sorry for my double post, do you want it as 1 file or as 4?"
,Holden_Makok,2009-09-30T22:10Z,4 files would be nice low space :3 thanks by the way

,Necroclysm,2009-10-09T01:15Z,"I had a problem getting 6 to run, it plays the video and partially locks up with a black screen at the end of it.

I tried it on my 5.00 m-33 and my 3.80 m-33.
Tried using various popsloader versions 3.xx and nothing worked.

CWCheat menu can still be opened while frozen on the black screen, but cannot do anything else(have to reset device).


The rest seem to work okay, so not sure what is up."
,Necroclysm,2009-10-09T01:17Z,"Sorry, I forgot to mention, I have another copy of 6 which does work correctly."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-09T06:11Z,"I'll check it out, you're talking about right after the PlayStation logo when first resetting? Or it freezes right after the opening video after clicking to start a new game? 

As of your post I've re-tested and here are my results:

I've successfully tested the individual FFVI .iso on my PC up to the first save point. 
I've successfully tested disc four in this exact compilation on my phat-PSP using CFW 5.5Gen-B2 up to the first save point.
I've successfully tested disc four in this exact compilation on my slim-PSP using CFW 5.5Gen-B2 up to the first save point.

There does seem to be a lot of delay in the transition between the playstation logo and the opening video, as well as between the opening video and the start menu. 

My suggestions:
1. Attempt to load the game one last time, make sure to switch to disc 4. After the video or wherever your getting caught at, just set your PSP down and let it sit for about 2 min. If this does not fix your problem, go to suggestion 2.

2. Upgrade a PSP to 5.5Gen-B2 and attempt to play the game again without using poploader, just use the default pops that 5.5gen-b2 has without adjusting any settings. If this works, you can downgrade and reinstall your choice custom firmware without any plugins active and see what your results are, it very well could just be a small glitch in your PSP that can be fixed by a clean CFW install.

Hope this helps!
If anyone else has any problems, just let me know and I'll try to fix them, if you continue to have a problem with this, I don't mind uploading the individual FFVI for you in a single .eboot."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-09T10:11Z,"Oh, I nearly didn't remember to mention. It also helps sometimes to overclock the processor of your PSP. I always set mine on 333. If you need instructions email me."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-12T05:20Z,STILL no requests? WHAT GAMES DO YOU WANT ME TO UP FOR YOU?! 
,5cottish,2009-10-17T05:07Z,Could you upload the original C&C please? Would be much appreciated!
,iammrfrank,2009-10-18T05:12Z,C&C as in Command & Conquer?
,doubleyouteeeff,2009-10-18T08:49Z,Can't access the menu. When I press triangle the screen goes to black forever. Can still hear background music. Tried on 5.00 M-33 and 5.50Gen B-2
,doubleyouteeeff,2009-10-18T08:50Z,Oh forgot to mention the above refers to FFVI haven't tried the others
,iammrfrank,2009-10-18T13:44Z,"Interesting, my menu works..

Like I said in a previous post, there is a lot of lagg between the playstation logo and the game opening video. 

Don't hit triangle, instead switch to disc 4, then wait for the playstation logo to vanish, then let the game sit for no longer then a minute before pressing X, the video should have started by this point, go ahead and hit X one more time and then the logo should appear.

I don't understand why you would press ""Triangle"" but the game loads and plays for me and my other 4 psps using various firmware."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-18T13:50Z,"If your referring to the in-game menu, where are you trying to access it from? Try moving to a new area and attempting it from there, perhaps its a small glitch for that area?"
,doubleyouteeeff,2009-10-18T15:09Z,"Yes I'm talking about the in-game menu. I can't access it in the first area. I tried to see if it was just that area but once I beat the first boss, the screen opened to the inn and then it froze."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-18T15:31Z,"I checked into it.
The menu screen in game won't open as long as I'm in the robot suit. 

Afterwords, I can access it in the inn, outside the inn, and in another random building, I don't know which one. 
Mine did not freeze after the boss or in the inn.

I'll re-rip my disc and host it as a single file. I guess that's about the only thing i can think of to do."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-18T16:17Z,"Well.. I guess thepiratebay is having some problems.. because it's not letting me post it. I'll get back to you when thepiratebay will let me. 
Or you can email me and i can send it to you."
,5cottish,2009-10-18T23:29Z,"Yeah, c&c - command & conquer. GDI & NOD discs please. I tried ripping the psx cds and using popstation but no joy, my discs are old and battered. Thanks"
,doubleyouteeeff,2009-10-19T00:57Z,Don't worry about it. I downloaded the single FFVI eboot already on this site and it seems to work. Thanks for your help anyway.
,iammrfrank,2009-10-19T08:08Z,"That's cool. I'll upload my FFVI anyway, whenever it allows me to. (yes.. it is still down for me..) 
(Afterall, my more recent torrents all have animated icons, and for some reason, a lot of people like that)

I also have C&C Red alert allies and soviets, but I don't have the C&C that has GDI and NOD discs.. 

I'll try to find a download for them, but there's nothing I can do if they don't work.."
,iammrfrank,2009-10-19T19:21Z,"Here is my FFVI.
