This is Final Fantasy I, II, IV, V, VI Encoded in 1 Eboot for use with PSP.

I and II are from the Final Fantasy Origins PSX game and are in slot 1.

IV is from the Final Fantasy IV/Chrono Trigger PSX game and is in slot 2. 
CHRONO TRIGGER NOT INCLUDED!

V is an original PSX game included at slot 3.

Customized Icon, Background, and music while hovering the icon. (It does not repeat, I had problems when I made the sounds repeat)

To change between games, let the "playstation logo" finish and then hit the home button, select "restart game" and it will ask you what disc you want to load, just select the 1 corresponding with the Final Fantasy you wish to play.

All games have been tested through the first save point by myself.

To use: Copy eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

Please comment if you enjoy my torrent, this is the 2nd I've uppede, but I have many pSX games that I've converted for myself that I can post, or if you have any requests.

(If anyone wants this as 4 separate files, I have it also, just don't want to upload without a demand)

If anyone has any problems with the game, or if you want to request a game for upload, you can E-Mail me at iammrfrank@gmail.com
