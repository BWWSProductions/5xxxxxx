Thanks!"

,Grim.Reaper,2009-11-01T13:31Z,For me NOD32 is identifying some of the .mp3's as Trojans..... can anyone else verify that? or is NOD32 on the fritz?
,Grim.Reaper,2009-11-01T15:16Z,Scanned it again with Microsoft security essentials and it's seems clean... guess it's just NOD32 that's giving a false-positive
