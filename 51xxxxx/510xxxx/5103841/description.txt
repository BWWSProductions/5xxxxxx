After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
          
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	          
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	          
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce          
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce          
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce          
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce          
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce          
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

What follows is the merge of 5 different torrents, just to minimize, with the few bandwidth I have, the numbers of torrents I have to manage...
Also I see that bigger torrents have longer life and more seeders in the average

PETER LANG

I remember the first time I listened the famous Kottke, Fahey & Lang album...
It was my "ear opener" in fingerstyle guitar.

And I remember how I adored the third, less famous fellow of the trio: Peter Lang.

Pure country blues and crystal sounds from the past...

Besides the common techniques of fingerstyle he makes use of a distinctive hammering style "left-handed", with the neck of the guitar toward his right shoulder.
Dig his new age landscapes and atmospheres.

PRESTON REED

Preston Reed is an American fingerstyle guitarist.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Reed  
http://www.prestonreed.com/

First-time listeners to Preston Reed find it hard to believe it's only one guitarist and his instrument. He plays with fingers, thumbs, fists and hands at once, suggesting a whole band at work: drummer, keyboardist, bassist and several guitarists at once. Some of his tunes invoke impressions of rock bands and duelling guitars, but he is also a player of blues or ballads reminiscent of Bill Evans, one of his musical idols.

His guitar style is characterised by the use of open tunings and percussive effects he generates with both hands on various parts of the guitar body, he names them appropriately rim shots and bongo hits.

What follows is a collection of some of his albums... Enjoy...

DON ROSS

Don Ross is a Canadian fingerstyle guitarist noted for the emotion and intensity of his playing as well as his use of extended technique.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ross_(guitarist)  
http://www.gobyfish.com/

Ross names Bruce Cockburn, Leo Kottke, John Renbourn, Pierre Bensusan, Keith Jarrett, Egberto Gismonti and Pat Metheny as his main sources of inspiration. His advanced technique and his sure feeling for rhythm combine with uncommon ideas to make his style instantly recognizable. He often uses percussive techniques and plays intricate down- and upstroke patterns with his thumb. His use of acrylic nails give him a sharp and very defined tone.

What follows is a collection of some of his albums... Enjoy...
