I have a few friends that are in film school and sometimes I am so jealous of them. What they do looks like so much fun! The other day, they showed me a movie that they made and it was so cool that it made me want to direct, star in, and edit my own movie. â€¦So I did! Itâ€™s a little rough since I did it all myself, but I love it! Itâ€™s called The Secretaryâ€™s Revenge and thanks to the help of my friends I think it came out pretty damn good. It has drama, suspense, intrigue, some naked men (naturally) and some hot, sweet revenge! Iâ€™m so excited about this and I hope you all enjoy this as much as I did. Presenting The Secretaryâ€™s Revenge. Starring, written by, directed by, produced by, and edited by Brandi Belle! I always wanted to say that!
