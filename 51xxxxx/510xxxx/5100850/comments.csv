I do.. then omg.. there comes some text messages flash before my eyes so quick I cant read.. all I see is that it cant find some files.. but omg.. they are right there. and then it tells ""Done. Have a nice time playing"" or something.. and I feel like.,. ""fucking hell.. this is Fifa?""

So far, I have downloaded one version.. tried to burn it twice.. fucked up both times. Then another one, which I mounted with Daemon.. but than there was nothing I could do with the mounted file.. and then this version.. I am going mental.. HELP! please.. dear God."

I was so happy.. but then.. it goes nowhere, it just says: Rebuilding 1% forever and nothing happens.
What am I gonna do? :(:(:(:(:(
