300+ Nintendo 64 Roms.
I use for Project64 (http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/n64/project64.html) but you may have your own use...
                                   Steps

1) Click "Download This Torrent"
2) Add to your BitTorrent Application.
3) Wait for it to Finish downloading.
4) Once it's finished 100% highlight the file and on the tabs select "Files" there should be exactly 322 .rar (Winrar or 7 Zip)
5) If you have a Kick Ass computer and you think it won't freeze up then you should Highlight ALL of them (Shift+â†‘orâ†“)then right click or double click and Winrar or 7 Zip should automatically open all of them up seperately (If you have a slow computer then I recommened one (or a Few) at a time).Choose to Extract them to your Project64 Game Directory or wherever you want.
6)If they went in your Rom Directory then you should open Project64 and Refresh the Rom List then you should be able to open them up in a menu instead of always clicking "Open Rom" and looking through some files until you find it.
7)Have Fun! =D

It can't get any easier than that. If anyone still needs help go ahead and message me at Michaelg2004898@yahoo.com or leave a comment I'm sure that the PirateBayers will be free to help.


*Note* This is my first torrent so if it doesn't work I apologize.
