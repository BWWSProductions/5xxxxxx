Release Length: 01:35:16
Storyline: Georgia (Nia Vardalos) came to Greece to follow a man. A few years later, 
she's been cast aside -- alone and adrift in a foreign land. Eventually, her passion for history leads her to a job as a tour 
guide. But Georgia is bored, and has lost her "kefi" (Greek for mojo) to boot. When taciturn sasquatch Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis) 
replaces the regular driver at the last minute, the frazzled tour guide thinks that her luck has just hit rock bottom. Thankfully, 
Georgia's latest batch of tourists is a more lively bunch than she's anticipated, and in between bouts with rival tour guide Nico 
(Alistair McGowan), she manages to form a genuine connection with wisecracking widower Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), a solo vacationer 
who maintains a jovial facade despite the fact that he misses his late wife dearly. With a little help from Irv, Georgia comes to 
realize that true love may be closer than she thinks -- if she could just recapture her kefi and open her eyes.
