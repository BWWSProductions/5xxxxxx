Thanks again joe, "
[V],only1joe,2009-09-27T23:35Z,"yohohoandaBottleofRUM - No, i am missing 
[2006] Overloaded: The Singles Collection

and there is about another 16-19 singles i dont have, but i should have included 
[2004] Do They Know It's Christmas (in Band Aid 20) as they were part of it and it reached number 1.

Other than that there is a lot there.

Joe"
