NBA 2K10 raises the bar again with revised gameplay components, enhanced graphics, even more realistic Signature Style animations, all-new presentation elements and competitive online play â€” this season you wonâ€™t just play the NBA, youâ€™ll take over!

With brand new offensive controls that enhance dribbling and post game handling, you can pull off ankle breaking Iso-Motion moves and dominate like Kobe from the perimeter to the paint. Round up your friends and build the ultimate squad, using either your created players from My Player mode or an actual NBA team, then go online and battle other Crews for bragging rights and progression points as you try to climb your way to the top of the Crew leaderboard rankings. And with NBA Today integration, all the real world matchups, news and stats are automatically streamed right into your game providing dynamic commentary and presentation elements based upon what is happening in the real NBA.
