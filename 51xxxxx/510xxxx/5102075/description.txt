Fundamentals of Medical Imaging, second edition, is an invaluable technical introduction to each imaging modality, explaining the mathematical and physical principles and giving a clear understanding of how images are obtained and interpreted. Individual chapters cover each imaging modality - radiography, CT, MRI, nuclear medicine and ultrasound - reviewing the physics of the signal and its interaction with tissue, the image formation or reconstruction process, a discussion of image quality and equipment, clinical applications and biological effects and safety issues. Subsequent chapters review image analysis and visualization for diagnosis, treatment and surgery.
