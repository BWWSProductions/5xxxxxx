Break Up is a collaborative album between Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson. The first single, "Relator" was released as a digital download on 25 May 2009. The full album was released by Atco/Rhino on 15 September 2009.

The album was recorded in 2006, thus precedes several albums that Yorn and Johansson have released as solo artists. Johansson completed her vocals for the project in two afternoon sessions.

Yorn said that the concept for the album was realised in a dream he had. The project was inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's 1967 and 1968 albums with Brigitte Bardot.

Johansson spoke about the project recently; "The idea of two people vocalizing their relationship through duets...I always thought of it as just a small project between friends. It perfectly captured where I was in my life at the time,"

In a recent interview Yorn stated that he would like to do some live shows with Johansson to promote the album. On September 10th 2009 Scarlett & Pete performed 'Relator' on the French television show 'Le Grand Journal'. This was Scarlett's first live performance on TV.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic.com reviewed the album and gave it a three out of five.

Peter (Pete) Yorn (born July 27, 1974) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist who first gained international recognition when his music, including the song "Strange Condition", appeared in the 2000 film Me, Myself & Irene. Yorn also wrote the film's score.

Scarlett I. Johansson (born November 22, 1984) is an American actress and singer. Johansson made her film debut in the 1994 film North and was subsequently nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for her performance in 1996's Manny & Lo.
