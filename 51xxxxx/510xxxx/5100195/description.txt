Ancient Egypt & the Pyramids

Professor at the University of Calgary, Carmen Boulter presented accumulated evidence and research, which suggests to her that levitation and advanced knowledge were used to construct the numerous pyramids in ancient Egypt. Her past life recall as a child led her to seek physical evidence for her visions of temples, pyramids and ceremonies. This quest brought her to Egypt 23 times, where she conducted extensive academic research, and field work around the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid, she noted, is a monumental building that spans over 2 acres and is made up of 2.3 million stones. 

Yet near the Great Pyramid, there are six distinct sites, encompassing a total of 22 pyramids, and these structures worked together as a kind of energy system, at a time when the Nile River ran along side them, she explained. This puts their construction date much further back than what is typically thought. Further, these pyramids couldn't have been made with chisels but rather were constructed with superior light and sound technologies that made use of levitation in moving the blocks, Boulter said.

The pyramid builders were living in a Golden Age, when humans had expanded senses and higher levels of consciousness, she contended. 2012 marks the time in the 26,000-year 'precessional' cycle when humans begin moving back to this Golden Age, she commented. The Temple of Seti at Abydos contains many symbols that show the understanding of the ancients, including blue, yellow, and red beings that could represent travelers from Sirius and Orion, she added.

Solar Cycle Update

Appearing in the last hour, physicist James McCanney gave an update on the extended lack of sunspot activity. This could push the solar maximum period back to 2014, but when the sun rebounds, its sunspot activity could be fast and furious, he warned.
