VIRUS Installed in XMLSpy2009. It Uninstalls into user temp directory, then copies msa.exe to WINDOWS DIRECTORY and makes changes to REGISTRY and creates a task in task scheduler. You have to open Task Scheduler, then click advanced and click Hidden Files to see hidden tasks. 

Even better, search for msa.exe on google for instructions to remove it.
