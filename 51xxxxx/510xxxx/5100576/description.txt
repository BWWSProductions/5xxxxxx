DBZ Abridged, by Team Four Star.

Here we have everything they posted prior to August 11, 2009 - The date they got kicked off a certain video hosting site due to Toei's complaints.

I've recreated the torrent on the basis that their second FAQ episode (added after the "big wipe") has now also been deleted. So this new version includes that and a couple of short videos where they try to explain what's going on.

My connection's pretty slow, so remember to keep seeding for others when you're done!

If you don't already have an FLV player installed on your computer, the K-lite Mega Codec Pack is an option.
