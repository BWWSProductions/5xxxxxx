,inamays,2009-12-24T06:50Z,"Seriously, how the hell do you mount this shit?"
,monsterkidd,2010-02-05T05:31Z,"Thanks! Just open the first 'add-ff10' file with winrar (or whatever) then extract the .bin and .cue files. Mount, then install, then play. Pretty simple."
,abzx,2010-02-18T23:15Z,how do you extract this?? I can't open it in WinZip....
,Tamarind777,2010-04-13T17:42Z,Something is missing or wrong with the files. They don't extract. It's saying that something is missing.
,mrdruids,2010-07-11T21:25Z,"works perfect, because theres no .rar file in the bunch winrar wont automaticaly be associated with the files, just right click - open with - winrar, extracts fine"
,kteddycharms,2010-07-15T06:21Z,is it wking
,kaitoukid44,2010-09-04T09:01Z,"working like a charm

1.select a program that listed

2.select WinRAR if not listed just browse it

then it open you see ""add-ff10.bin"" or something like that

3.just drag and drop it somewhere

4.mount it using DAEMON tools or ULTRAiso

5.install and play the freakin game..,"

,anton2010,2010-12-24T22:41Z,"Installs without any probs. u just need to know how..this is what i did

I Chose the first ""add-ff10.001"" and extracted with Winzip 7

Next I mounted ""add-ff10.bin"" with daemon tools and installed

Then I played...no cracking need...very simple"
,jaynayers,2011-02-02T23:17Z,"Having problems trying to do anything, there is no file I can unzip with winzip tried that, no image file or anything to mount or anything or any bin file in the whole download so I have no clue where you people are talking about this bin file, if someone could please help me out it would be greatly appreciated jaynayers@yahoo.com e-mail me "
,jaynayers,2011-02-02T23:46Z,"Nvmd I finally got it figured out and here's some easier instructions for people who aren't technologically inclined, download winrar if you don't have it download dameon tools if you don't have it download this torrent open up the first add-ff10.001 with win rar open up dameon tools add file look for the one with a bin extension and then mount it and then click play and it should install "
,gratefulforthis,2011-04-28T14:24Z,"Downloaded quickly and works fine.

I had rename all the files to add-ff10.001.r01, add-ff10.001.r02, add-ff10.001.r03 etc

But worked perfectly in the end."
,vistawiips3,2011-07-13T11:51Z,"Kudos. Best Speeds I have ever got. 1.5 mb/ps! Thankyou Seeders, works perfectly!"
,Jeraco,2011-09-17T18:07Z,Way to much trouble for the Basic PC user. 
,Jeraco,2011-09-17T18:09Z,Way to much trouble for the Basic PC user. even with the instruction given. 
,george1052,2012-01-02T03:49Z,I have to agree with Tamarind777. The files would not extract (or open in any way). I never had any problems in the past extracting win rar/winzip files...until now. Thanks anyway.
,hell911,2012-04-25T16:01Z,"--Working Instructions--
1. download the files from this torrent.
2. open WinRar, in the winrar, click Open at the top, then go to the family feud game folder, choose the 1st file. now u will see the 2 files. extract those files.
3. after extracting. open MagicIso. MagicIso should be at the bottom right of your screen (in the tray)
4. right click the MagicIso in the bottom right, click ""virtual cd/dvd-rom"", choose any letter, then mount the 1st file (from the 2 files u extracted). this will automatically open the installer.

NOTE: in number 4, if the 1st file didnt work, choose the 2nd file..

this is working solution.."
,hell911,2012-04-25T16:03Z,"You need to mount the file always to play this game.

if you are good at computers and know how to bypass this and play without mounting everytime, then good for u."
,FamilyMan82,2012-07-10T04:48Z,haha really guys?? How many times r u people gonna repeat the same easy install and play instructions? :)
,FamilyMan82,2012-07-10T04:50Z,n by the way. u don't need to select individual files to extract. Winrar will extract the entire downloaded folder all at once........DAMN!!! Now I did it tooo!!! :) LOL
