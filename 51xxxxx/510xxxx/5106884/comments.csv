,Vonzom,2009-10-02T21:59Z,"I'm having trouble installing on Vista 64-bit
Anyone have a solution?

Basically, the error prompts that pop up say that the program or feature I'm trying to install is not compatible with 64-bit systems. (the error is titled ""Unsupported 16-bit Application"" so I guess it has to do with the installer/setup)"
,sus2912,2009-10-03T09:42Z,"@Vonzom 
when it ask for overwrite say yes and it will install properly and u will not get that error that u r getting"
,Dawn501,2009-10-03T14:34Z,"The installer can't find the ""External"" file so it just does nothing and leaves an empty folder. Yeah, this doesn't work."
,Dawn501,2009-10-03T14:37Z,"Haha, nevermind, I understand the problem. I can't really install it in a folder that starts with external in the name, for some strange reason. Which is still a little frustrating as I'd rather keep it installed wherever I want rather than where you want...."

,q1snbdy,2009-10-05T05:04Z,zupp guys can I just ask whats been Ripped on this game ?
,aslilpingo,2009-10-05T06:04Z,"I've downloaded and installed game all works fine, 
but the color in game is dull looking and when i go near a wall or look at a certain angle you can see the true color on a portion of the screen.
Anyone know whats causing this?"
,krashkru,2009-10-05T06:16Z,"well , i ran the setup and chose my folder , finished install but i end up with an empty folder . can someone show me how to do it properly ?"
,aslilpingo,2009-10-05T06:43Z,"@Krashkru: when i installed it i just left the install folder as the default one the installer chose, so you might want to try that."
,rock1982,2009-10-05T16:40Z,"Thanks allot man...
I know it isn't the uploader's doing - I just want to point out some things for TPTB's next release...I couldn't exit the TPTB intro and had to end the proccess...on the first time you execute the game a suspicious driver installation is asked of you and it gets quarantined by Kaspersky anti-virus (this JUST happened and I deleted the bad files so ill wait and see if all is alright) ...if you press ESC in the intro movie it exists to the desktop while still running sound and I can't get back to the game...

Note that the installer says it needs 7GB but the game took only 2GB on my computer and I DID cut the RISEN directory from C: and put it in D: - so the ESC problem could be my own fault...

I probably sound very stupid complaining about these problems especially since this game isn't really out here (or wasn't at least) and some other reasons that give me no say in this whatsoever.... ;)
...So I want to thank TPTB for their release (unless there is some spyware on my system - though I don't really see a reason for TPTB to do this...) and I want to thank my mother for all that she did to me....and my dad who kept his distance for all these years...and the police for putting me here !!!!!

Thanks allot...!!!"
,PUREL,2009-10-06T20:17Z,install fine but when i run thw game its stuck in you logo (even if i push the esc button )and thats all.
,houba34,2009-10-06T22:29Z,"I'm getting: ""Please Insert DVD or Risen"" when I try to run the game, if someone knows a download link to a no-cd crack or to a valid mini-image(not russian) that would be greatly appreciated.

Houba"
,riplikethat,2009-10-07T08:28Z,"In the days of 64 Bit OS, it's kinda retarded that these TPTB guys didn't bother making the crack work on Windows x64 (it doesn't work).

Downloading the Russian image to see if that works. 

Instead of advertising your site and creating that addware crap Intro that doesn't even exit properly on x64 versions, might wanna fix your next release to actually make it professional."
,flirtyguy10,2009-10-07T22:41Z,"Are the ingame videos removed???

what is ripped in this version?

There's no info given..."
,houba34,2009-10-08T01:21Z,"@guitdude9 

stop bitching because you're too poor to by an X64 os. 

@riplikethat

the russian image does not work and I support everything you just said"
,thovader,2009-10-08T11:17Z,So is it true that this game really doesn't work with Vista 64 Bit? That would suck indeed :( .
,M4v3r1kk,2009-10-09T03:10Z,"Such an amateur torrent (not flaming you chatbars).

The built in crack doesn't work on 64-bit Ultimate and the mini images don't work either.

Freeman needs to learn a thing or two before spraying the game with advertising.

Razer > Freeman."
,frankenmuffin,2009-10-10T04:00Z,is there any way this version of the game can be patched? when i try to patch it it just says i don't have a valid install of the game....
,houba34,2009-10-10T16:44Z,"@Dicks

Thanks for the guide butI cant mount the .mds file of the mini-image. Doesnt work with MagicIso or Daemon tools. Idk how you guys make it work but ive been trying for 4 days and I still cant! :(
Help would be appreciated"
,houba34,2009-10-10T17:16Z,"I was able to mount the .mds with the new DT Lite but when i try to play the game i get the ""game entering"" picture and then it just closes and the process also disappears. BTW I have 64xbit vista so if anyone has found a solution please tell me."
,degtop,2009-10-11T14:36Z,"Ummm, I have a problem. I'm on Windows 7x64. start to install it gives me the error cannot find C:\Program and after this, it starts to install but does nothing after that. Does anyone know the problem?"

,Taneja,2009-10-31T14:45Z,"ok i installed it and got the thing on my desktop but when i click it it says insert disk...
so where is the crack?"
,vdf,2009-11-06T10:55Z,"@people who needs the crack:

1) go to www.gamecopyworld.com
2) search for ""risen""
3) download ""Risen [RUSSIAN] No-DVD/Fixed Image #2"". Nevermind the ""RUSSIAN"" bit, it works perfectly with this (english) version.
4) Follow the instructions included in that file.

NOTE: The mini-image CANNOT be mounted with clonecd or Daemon tools _LITE_. I found that it worked with Daemon tools _PRO_."
,mc2525,2009-11-17T05:22Z,"thanks game works perfect! love u man, you upload the best working games"
,ll-Arc-ll,2009-11-29T16:28Z,Yeah by the way guys... I have Windows 7 64-bit. This doesn't work with my system.
,stewie0,2009-12-05T02:00Z,"People are saying to download the image 2 but i only have Daemon tools lite, so will image 1 work?"
,lucky99,2009-12-06T00:29Z,"I hate this crappy extracted rips, the crackers are always egomaniacs who turn a simple process of installing a game into some convulted process for no reason other than to show off that they can use a computer, The Cracker (freeman) has littered this rip with extra amatuer BS that just wrecks the whole thing. Just get the CLONEDVD ISO, mount it and use a mini image, this rubbish is a waste of a download"
,Netarangi,2010-01-02T21:15Z,Seed more please. Been downloading for about a week straight now. 4% to go. Has only done 1% overnight.
