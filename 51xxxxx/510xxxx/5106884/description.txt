:
Risen is a single-player fantasy-themed action role-playing game under 
development by the German company Piranha Bytes, and published by Deep Silver. 
Piranha Bytes itself is developing the Windows version, due to be released on 
October 2, 2009.  The Xbox 360 port has been outsourced to an experienced 
console team under the close supervision of Piranha Bytes. IGN states that the 
North American and European release date of the Xbox 360 port has been delayed 
to "early 2010". However, Risen went on sale in Scotland on the 30th of 
September.
