The Royal Air Force at War: The Unseen Films 1939-41:  previously unavailable training and information films of the RAF and its aircraft in the early years of WW2.  

For the first time ever the early wartime mute films from the Imperial War Museum have been gathered together, revoiced and represented as a continuous story of the Royal Air Force at war during the first two years of the war. Packed with newly transferred archive film of Spitfires, Hurricanes and Wellingtons, it also features many rarely-seen aircraft from that period including Defiants, Battles, Gladiators Ansons and many more. Duration: 94 mins

There is a filmed account of a Blenheim raid, a Sunderland sortie over Norway and Churchill reviewing new American imports for the RAF such as the P-40, the B-17 and the Douglas Boston. It also shows the wonderful work done under wartime conditions by the aircraft manufacturers, the air ministry and the training of RAF recruits.

Two extra short films (1 min & 4 mins) show an inspection of the Air Ministry by HM King George VI and a visit to the RAF Eagle Squadrons made up of foreign volunteer pilots, including many Americans.

These films are of great historical importance and are essential viewing for anyone interested in aviation history.
