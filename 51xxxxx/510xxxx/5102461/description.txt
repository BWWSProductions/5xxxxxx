When a mortician discovers that a girl's mutilated corpse grows prodigious amounts of hair, he sells the locks to a beauty salon for use as hair extensions. But the dead girl's spirit has cursed the hair, which begin to attack the women who wear it. How many must die before the hirsute rampage relents? Genuinely horrific, this captivating film was directed by Sion Sono and stars Chiaki Kuriyama, Ren Osugi and Megumi Sato.
