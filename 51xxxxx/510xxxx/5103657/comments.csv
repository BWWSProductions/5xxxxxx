,michaelrwatson,2010-04-28T01:04Z,"YAFR (yet another fucking retard). The foreign dialog is key to this movie, so this is crap. Nor do I want some dumbass's gay homemade version of subs that are probably only half correct and out of sync too. "
,looneycooney,2010-07-28T06:16Z,"Thanks for this nice download ! 10/10 
Maybe just a question , is there a way to have the subs work in mediaplayer? ..haven't found that out yet , but divx-player worked nicely offcourse. 
Enjoyed the movie, i liked it :-) "
