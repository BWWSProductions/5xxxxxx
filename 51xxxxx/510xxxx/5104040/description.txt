Award winning Documentary film about Finnish 20th century composer Jean Sibelius.

This DVD is divided into three sections: one on the Christopher Nupen films on classical music and two on the life and music of Sibelius.

â€˜The Early Yearsâ€™, covers the composerâ€™s progress through his early patriotic works and the glorious melodies of the first two symphonies, Finlandia and the Violin Concerto. It leads up to the more restrained and more â€˜classicalâ€™ style of the Third Symphony, composed in the tranquillity of â€˜Ainolaâ€™ (in English, Sibeliusâ€™s wife, Ainoâ€™s House). This was the Sibelius familyâ€™s country retreat some 45 minutes drive outside Helsinki after he had forsaken his more gregarious and hedonistic life in Helsinki. The other film, â€˜Maturity and Silenceâ€™, charts Sibeliusâ€™s work through to the towering grandeur of the single-movement Seventh Symphony. This is notable for its concentration of material and its originality of structure and unity of form. Then from the same period thereâ€™s the great tone poem Tapiola in which Sibelius brings a different, original sound to the orchestra. The film then tracks through to the long years through which he struggled in vain to compose an Eighth Symphony - the pages eventually consigned to the flames in his green â€˜F majorâ€™ stove at Ainola, by a composer who was so exceedingly self-critical that he was not prepared to allow anything that would not satisfy his stringent standards.

The visual elements of the films are striking. As to be expected, there are many views of Finlandâ€™s lakes and forests through the seasons: sun glinting on snow through tall phalanxes of trees; wisps of smoke-like cloud threading through and gliding across the tops of massed fir trees; mists creeping over dozens of islands and little islets on silvery lakes or embracing rugged mountain tops. There is archive film of Sibelius walking near Ainola and many portraits of the composer at different times of his life.
