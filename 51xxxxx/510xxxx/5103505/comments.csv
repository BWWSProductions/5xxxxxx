,Piglet666,2009-09-30T14:24Z,Anyone but me have your computer shut down a few mins into the tutorial?
,AudiTQ,2009-10-04T19:06Z,DIdn't work for me.... couldn't care less about these eastern european game releases..always buggy and unfinished. 
,Zaak,2009-10-23T19:13Z,"After install the game, in a correct way. Start the game an a clock is showing and the game says loading... nothing more happens. How many hour needs game the game to be loaded?
If you have a game which not working, donÂ´t place it on Piratebay, OK? "
,drookasi,2010-01-07T23:19Z,"Actually the game works fine. To install follow these steps. After you create the iso icon and you mount it on your virtual drive, go to ''my computer'', right click on the virual drive named ''pt_boats'' and choose ''exlore''. Then double click on the ''autorun'' file and you are ready to go. Be careful not to click the ''PTsetup'' file becouse the instalatio crashes."

cheers"
