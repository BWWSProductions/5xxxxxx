Well Gang, here we go again with this July's excellent offering from the Video Pool.  The quality puts Promo Only to shame, I hope someone from Promo Only is reading this and will not only increase the number of useable tracks and cut down on the rubbish they send us every month, but also increase the quality by only putting 29 tracks to each Monthly DVD.

Original VOB's split into tracks using DVD Decrypter so they can be re named using industry standards, making this so easy for you to import into your DJ software.

My International Video/Karaoke Discotheques use OtsAV Pro, if your collection is over 27,000 tracks you will too, trust me on that one.  Search keyword OtsAV for the web site and have a play with the fully functional demo.

See torrent files for track details and enjoy!
