Elizabeth's Women: The Hidden Story of the Virgin Queen - Tracy Borman (BBC Abridged)


Emma Fielding reads from Tracy Borman's biography of Elizabeth I, which explores the relationships she had with the women in her life. These women brought out the best and the worst of Elizabeth, who could be loyal and kind but also cruel and vindictive. They all influenced Elizabeth's carefully-cultivated image as Gloriana, The Virgin Queen. This was book of the week on Radio 4 in September 2009.
