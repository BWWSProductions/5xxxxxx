,lkadar,2009-09-29T10:32Z,"The x64 does NOT seems to work. Installation aborts saying unexpected end, get a new copy! This could be right as that file is so short.
Thanks for the ups anyway."
,lkadar,2009-09-29T10:47Z,"Downloaded the WinRAR archiver from http://www.rarlab.com/ 
It installed correctly. Overwriting the rareg key with the one provided validated it prfectly.
THANKS!"

,KZahhhch,2009-10-09T04:54Z,"@Ikadar: How did you replace the key with the one provided? When I try it says ""Not a binary key""?

@TauseeF: Same question, how do I use the key you included? Or, in RegEdit, where do I place it?

[V],[HB],2009-10-11T11:56Z,Not to place it anywhere you have to open the regkey file after installing the application
,BartMan__X,2009-10-14T08:45Z,"wow ...
wtf ......

---------------------------
Registry Editor
---------------------------
Cannot import J:\DL\WiNRAR.3.90.Pro.[32,64Bit]\x32\rarreg.key: The specified file is not a registry script.

You can only import binary registry files from within the registry editor.

OK

,billy_dexd,2009-10-25T00:41Z,Thank you
,desynced,2009-10-27T06:16Z,"ok.. since some of you cant figure it out..

go to www.rarlabs.com and download the 64bit version there (3.90) since the one in this torrent is corrupt..

install it

copy the key file out of the folder and put it in the folder that WinRAR installed to (make sure WinRAR isnt running)

start WinRAR and it should be licensed"
