,mygig,2012-01-25T14:45Z,"If you are on Windows 7 x64 (like I am) you have to go to control panel, click firewall, click advanced, click outbound rules, click new rule, then click next, then choose the .exe for this soft, then make sure you are blocking connections, then name it sothink block, and it should block any connections, and STOP asking for the key... Worked for me."
