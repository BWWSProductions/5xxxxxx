Harvey Thriller was a comic book imprint used by Harvey Comics for their brief foray into publishing super heroes and other non-'kiddie' comics in the mid 1960s.

In the mid-1960s, with the camp comic crazy created by the Batman television series, Harvey approached Joe Simon to oversee a new line of comics, mainly superheroes, but with science fiction/fantasy stories thrown in as well. All were short-lived.

The line started off with one-shots Unearthly Spectaculars #1, Thrill-O-Rama #1, Blast-Off #1, and Warfront #36 in October, 1965, using work that was apparently done for the 1950s Thrill Adventure line. The next issues would not come out until almost a year in September, 1966! Along with the new titles were two reprint titles for Fighting American and The Spirit, which did include new stories for these characters. All the titles ended by March 1967.

All titles feature work by many well known creators, including Jack Kirby, Bob Powell, Wally Wood, Otto Binder, and the earliest known work by Jim Steranko.



NOTE: Warfront #36 is currently unscanned.
