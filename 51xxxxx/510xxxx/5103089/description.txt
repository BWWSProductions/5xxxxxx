"Violet" is a song by the American rock band Hole, fronted by Courtney Love. It was the third single to be released from their second album, Live Through This, following "Doll Parts" which was released in 1994. This song was released after an extensive touring period by the band, throughout 1994 and 1995.

"Violet" is a song reputedly about Billy Corgan with whom Courtney had a relationship in the early nineties. Courtney introduced the song on the Jools Holland show in 1995 as "This song's about a jerk, I hexed him and now he's losing his hair," which might refer to Corgan's hair loss. Lyrics such as 'When they get, what they want, then they never want it again', and 'Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to', portray the end of a bitter relationship. In any event, Corgan and Love subsequently came to enjoy cordial relations. However there is some evidence that the song alludes to Courtney's days as a stripper. Courtney herself has on occasion made reference to the violet lights in a strip club she used to work in. The video itself is also set in a seedy strip club, and Love herself dances on a pole, adding further speculation as to what the song is really about.

The songwriting credits on record goes collectively to Hole, though BMI's website shows that "Violet" was written only by Eric Erlandson and lyrics by Love. "He Hit Me (It Felt Like A Kiss)" is originally written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, and was first recorded by producer Phil Spector in the 1960s
