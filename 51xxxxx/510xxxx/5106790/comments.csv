,sirnephilim,2009-10-03T19:17Z,"BluRayRip = BD downsampled to DVD quality. Generally you end up with a better quality than recoding a dual layer DVD to single layer, since the source material is so much clearer.

Just FYI"

,AlienAvatar,2009-12-08T17:41Z,"_ Open your DVD burning program and burn all of the files as a data disc. Alternately, select the folder as a DVD file folder and burn it that way. "
