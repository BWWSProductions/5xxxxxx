Christians say they are the follower of Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) but really they are not cos they are not following what Jesus did in his lifetime that is following the the law Torah,OT to the letter. so really Christian should be call ""Pauline"" not Christian.

{5:17} Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. {5:18} For
verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled. {5:19} Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever
shall do and teach [them,] the same shall be called great in
the kingdom of heaven.  *Matthew 5:17 - 5:19"

On several occasions and most notably in the Sermon of the Mount, Jesus alters and clarifies the law of the old testament. He doesn't, however, change the intention behind it. We live under the new covenant - things have changed indeed from the old testament. Do we still bring God animals as sacrifices? No! Because the greatest sacrifice possible is already made - it is the crucification of Jesus.

But the really important thing is NOT following the law, but believing in Jesus and accepting him as your saviour. Following the law will come through belief, because you will see it is good and just. You can't get saved by following the law, because no man can fully follow it - I can't, you can't, the only one who ever did it was Jesus Christ.  You get saved by believing!

Take David - did he get saved and called ""a man after God's own heart"" because he always followed the law? He didn't! How can he still be ""after God's own heart""? Because he believed in God, and God credited his faith as righteousness.

Paul was right, so were the apostles that approved what he was doing and saying, and so is the Holy Spirit that confirmed his teaching by many miracles.

All this does not mean that you shouldn't follow the law - that is a very good thing to do (at least as long as you follow it according to Mt. 22,34-40). But what you are saying is utterly wrong and flawed... I hope and pray that no one has been put away from the faith by your words!

Again: Repent and Believe! Jesus Saves, just following the law does not!"
