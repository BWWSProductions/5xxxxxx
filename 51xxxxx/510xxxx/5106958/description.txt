"Alex welcomes back to the show Ray McGovern, a retired CIA officer under seven U.S. presidents over 27 years and founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity or VIPS. The organization is dedicated to analyzing and criticizing the use of intelligence, specifically relating to the War in Iraq. In January 2006, McGovern began speaking out on behalf of the anti-war group Not in Our Name. 
Alex also covers the latest developments from Hardin, Montana. He covers the latest news and takes your calls."
