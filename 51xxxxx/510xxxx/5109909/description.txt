William Shakespeare - Romeo and Juliet (BBC 2003)

Play of the Week - Romeo and Juliet - in 2 parts

Adapted for radio by Paul Brennan.

Romeo And Juliet: William Shakespeare's most romantic play 
receives a new radio treatment by Paul Brennen in this two-part 
adaptation recorded entirely on location with a young cast. 

Our Play of the Week this week is one of Shakespeareâ€™s 
best-loved and most famous â€“ the heart-breakingly romantic story 
of Romeo and Juliet. 

In a new production, recorded entirely on location in a Tudor 
manor-house in the south of England, the star-crossed lovers from 
the two rival families â€“ Juliet a Capulet and Romeo a Montague - 
meet, fall in love and have the fates and their families work 
against them. 

To use the bard's own words: Never was a story of more woe 
than this of Juliet and her Romeo. 

Jasmine Hyde (Juliet), Ian Robertson (Romeo), David Calder and Karl Johnson 
star in Romeo & Juliet.

Directed by Marion Nancarrow.
