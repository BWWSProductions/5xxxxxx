,skip6235,2009-11-09T03:03Z,How do you get the subtitles to work?
,Rathyas,2009-11-16T00:41Z,"Skip6235 - Use VLC, and when playing the movie, right-click and go to ""Video"", then, ""Subtitles Track"" and click ""Open File"". Find the location of the subtitles, and choose the one you want."
,davitodude,2009-12-18T01:48Z,I agree. Use vlc player or mplayer and just start the movie up and drag and drop the subs over the playing movie. Simple as pie. 
,PopolVuh2,2010-01-05T18:43Z,Mmm...Pie

,ottohess,2010-05-23T19:23Z,"A fantastic copy at this size!! 700MB, 2:00:14 long. Probably the best copy out there.

Original Mandarin language with perfectly synced both (!) srt and VobSub subtitles in English. I use WMP with CCCP codec pac - no issues. If i must rack down on anything - the volume is SLIGHTLY low.

A = 10
V = 10

Hat off for the UL!!"

,Dantheman420,2011-04-10T08:31Z,"how are the subs? are they any good, or is it like google translation..... 

i watched one with crap subs and i didn't realize for like 15 min's that when they said ""OUR LAND"" they were symbolizing CHINA as a nation amoung many, when the translation was literally ""everything and everyone"" "
