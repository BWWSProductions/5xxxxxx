"La Tortura" (English: The Torture) is a Latin pop-Reggaeton song performed by singers Shakira and Alejandro Sanz. It was recorded for Shakira's sixth studio album FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1, released in June 7, 2005. The song achieved large-scale success on different radio and chart formats, becoming the most famous Spanish language track of both singers worldwide and the fourth most successful song in Shakira's career. The song won two Latin Grammy Awards at the 2006 Ceremony for Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Since its release as a single, the song has become one of the most important Latin songs to move into the mainstream English-speaking culture in the U.S. and Canada. The music video of the song was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Dance video and Viewer's Choice Award on the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, during which Shakira performed with Sanz (notably, the first time a guest performed a song entirely in a language other than English).
