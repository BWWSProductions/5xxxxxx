Allmusic.com review:
"An audio biography of Grace Jones, produced by Trevor Horn, it's a sonic treat along the lines of Yes's 90125 or Frankie Goes to Hollywood's first album (both produced by Horn). The music ranges from slick R&B runaway grooves to striking audio montages, interrupted occasionally by conversation about Jones's life. Serious ear candy. 4.5/5 stars."

Wikipedia bio "Slave to the Rhythm" (album):
Slave to the Rhythm is an album by Grace Jones. It was produced by Trevor Horn (assisted by Stephen Lipson) and released in 1985. The album was written by Bruce Woolley, Simon Darlow, Stephen Lipson and Trevor Horn. Unlike most albums that feature a collection of different songs, Slave to the Rhythm was a concept album that featured several, radical interpretations of the title track, interviews with Jones as well as actor Ian McShane reciting passages from Jean-Paul Goude's biography Jungle Fever.

In the liner notes to the forthcoming box set celebrating the 25th anniversary of ZTT Records, journalist Paul Morley says Slave to The Rhythm was originally intended for Frankie Goes To Hollywood as a follow-up to their 1983 single "Relax". The song was assembled and produced by Horn after "Two Tribes", but the project was given to Jones. Morley says Horn worked on the song and the album endlessly and had hoped it would become one of his biggest and most successful creations. The album did reach number #12 on the UK Album Chart in November 1985, #10 on the German Album Charts and #9 in the Netherlands, and although the song "Slave to the Rhythm" became a #1 hit on Billboard's Dance Chart in early 1986 and a dancefloor classic worldwide, the album itself surprisingly stalled at #71 in the US.

Several minutes from the original LP are absent on the European CD reissue (Island Masters, 1987); many songs are shortened, the track order is altered, and fragments of an interview with Jones conducted by Paul Morley are also omitted, while, paradoxically, one of the tracks is slightly extended. The original length of the "Slave to the Rhythm" album, and also the version available on CD in the US and most other parts of the world, is 43:09. The European CD version, which some two decades after its original release still is in print, is 37:42."

Wikipedia bio "Slave to the Rhythm" (song):
"Slave to the Rhythm" was the first single from Grace Jones' album of the same name, which was released in 1985. The song and the album was written by Bruce Woolley, Simon Darlow, Stephen Lipson and Trevor Horn and was produced by Horn. This was Jones first album in three years, and it contained eight variations of the same song (the single's B-side is another variation, yet to be released on CD). The single became one of her greatest commercial successes and today counts as one of Jones' signature tunes. The song peaked at #12 on the UK singles chart in 1985, and became a new #28 hit in 1994 (in remix form). The original version of the single, and its remixes, also topped the American dance chart in February of 1986. In Australia it reached #20 and it also became Jones' biggest hit in Germany where it peaked at #4 and stayed in the Top 10 for eight weeks. In the Netherlands, 'Slave to the Rhythm' reached number 3 in November 1985, staying on the chart for 12 weeks.

On the Slave to the Rhythm album the hit single version of the track is confusingly re-titled "Ladies & Gentleman: Miss Grace Jones". The track called "Slave to the Rhythm" on the album is in turn an entirely different interpretation of the song - a well-known fact that somehow managed to elude the producers of a recent hits compilation, which lead to record company Universal Music issuing the wrong version of one of Jones' greatest hits on one of their 'best of' packages (see The Ultimate Collection).

Two single CDs have been re-released with multiple remixes of the song. The first includes a slightly different edit of the original 12" version, co-titled "Hot Blooded".

On 11 November 2004, a Prince's Trust charity concert celebrating Trevor Horn's 25 years as a record producer took place at London's Wembley Arena. Performers at the show included The Buggles, Bruce Woolley, ABC, Art of Noise, Belle & Sebastian, Lisa Stansfield, Pet Shop Boys, Seal, Dollar, Propaganda, t.A.T.u., Frankie Goes to Hollywood - and Grace Jones with a rendition of "Slave to the Rhythm". The 'Produced by Trevor Horn' concert was released on DVD in 2006 under the title 'Slaves to the Rhythm'."
