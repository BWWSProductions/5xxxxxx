CanadaJoe - please consider a reseed looking at the very high number of users in the queue."

How do you propose I RE-SEED something that hasn't been seeded yet.. I suggest you check upload times & queue on the earlier uploaded ones (or if the working of a clock confuse you, they are also uploaded in alphabetical order.. ask yer mommy to explain how that works)"

I get it and shouldn't have jumped into commenting on something for which initial seeding was still due !"
