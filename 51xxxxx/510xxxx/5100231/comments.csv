,steadygettingblown,2009-09-26T02:34Z,hey brothers its all good just help one another and everything will work its self out ;) Spread the love!
,steadygettingblown,2009-09-26T02:35Z,are you gonna upload the 1080p version also bozx
,moshster,2009-09-26T15:10Z,"Yeah, I agree, better to be helpful than critical.  I too hope a 1080p comes out as this classic deserves the treatment."
,Luciferatu,2009-09-27T01:35Z,"I believe he wants you to seed, but it seems well seeded now.  So I suppose all is good in the world..."
,chronaden,2009-09-27T15:03Z,"moshster:

If its such a classic and deserves such ""treatments"", why dont you go out and buy it then?"
,kechiguy,2009-09-29T16:16Z,"IMPECCABLE! You're a real winner, BOZX--I have this on regular DVD and am eager to compare the differences...and thanks for the opportunity to do so. A classic in BluRay remastered quality is a welcome addition; THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE PIRATE BAY!!!"
,mrsinn1,2009-09-29T23:46Z,is this the porn version?
,justin131,2009-10-04T09:27Z,"I think jonny is referring to the amatuer looking info that contains little info at all and the fact he didn't even unrar it. Which means nobody's gonna seed it, just leach. Its at 70/245 right now. If he'd just unrared the damn thing it'd probably be something like 170/145.
