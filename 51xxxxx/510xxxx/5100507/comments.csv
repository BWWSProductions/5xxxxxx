,Moomincloth,2009-09-26T08:38Z,Thanks eztv - you're a legend!
,roges,2009-09-26T09:34Z,"eztv is a legend, but for some reason I can no longer download using the eztv subdomain. (I've tried transmission, bittorrent bittornado and even http://torrenteditor.com/ suggests a problem connecting to the tracker.)
torrents on http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce work
but http://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce gives an error like:
[08:21:37] Tracker announce still not complete 240 seconds after starting it (bittorrent command line)
or 
Unknown Error (0) (transmission)
[all under debian and CentOS]"

,ZeNiTH_NL,2009-09-26T10:56Z,"Have the same problems. Cannot get it to download. Other torrents go fine (using Azureus)
All the trackers are added to the list, but still nothing..hmm strange.. Will wait for another upload then :) "
