,ticas,2009-10-11T05:06Z,"oh sure, the climate is changing but but is all just a big scam. I suppose god wouldn't let global warming  to occur right?"
,Zenman1976,2009-10-15T23:28Z,"From what I have seen we are in the midst of a Global cooling trend not warming.. 

Either way it is going to require huge changes in peoples awareness. Taxation is not the answer nor is sticking ones head in the sand. 

We are stewards of this planet and as such we should do a much better job in looking after it, outside of any current hype, propaganda or denial from either ""sides"" of the whole debacle."
,chewbacca81,2010-04-24T18:03Z,"Global Warming is real, and caused by humans.

Some morons (""skeptics"") DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS, and so they live in denial, because they are too scared to give up their retarded ""beliefs"", aka delusions.

Spectroscopy doesn't lie."
,deancyrus,2010-06-27T17:24Z,"Its ok when we have fucked the planet to the point we cant live on it, the Earth will live on as if we had never been here..."
,The_Don_Meister,2010-12-06T15:04Z,"@chewbacca81. Obviously, you have been misinformed, Sir. The human contribution to global warming is negligable. The last inter-glacial period was far hotter than our current one is. It is merely a natural cycle of heating and cooling."
,ImperatorI,2011-04-10T19:40Z,"Are you a scientist yourself? Whether global warming/cooling exists or not, all resources including trees and oil are finite, so we do need to change the way we produce and perhaps how society functions. We cannot cut ourselves off from possible consequences. Better safe than sorry is what I believe."
