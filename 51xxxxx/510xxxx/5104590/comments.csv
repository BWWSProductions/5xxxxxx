p.s. can you provide a current e-mail address.  Because 'sistromo@acorn.org"" is getting returns as invalid.
Moron - if you want to obloviate get a blog site.  My laptop is upset displaying all that crap you are throwing up in comments.

Thanks JW -
p.s.s - suckmyDickDaddy, will you be attending the two-minute hate meeting tonight?
I will bring the popcorn with a surprise at the bottom."

1) Try and get my Bible.
2) Try and get my Gun.
3) Try and get my AM radio.
4) Try and get a public health option ambulance when you do.
Death to Tyranny/Truth to Power.
Liberals -the least liberal among us - and there lies the truth of the matter.
In a Leftist world - Up is Down and Down is Up
Down with Goldstein! Up with Big Brother!
Sorry - I meant Down with Limbaugh! Up with Obama!
