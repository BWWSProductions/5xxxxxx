,ektakrome,2009-10-01T08:26Z,"if he pled guilty, than he did it. especially with the way he's been acting about it lately. And that he ran away from the sentencing is about all you would need to know."
,TrustNobody,2009-10-08T00:45Z,"He pleaded guilty for having intercourse with the girl (13). Roman Polanski has NEVER brutally raped anyone. He didn't know her age. The girl had been introduced to Roman through her mother, because she wanted her to take pictures of her daughter for a magazine. Yes, he did a terrible mistake that night, having sex with that girl, but he's a human being like the rest of us."

Besides, the girl, a women now, does not want to persue anymore and here it is that after a number of years you cannot be persuade anymore. Except murder."
