Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired (2008) - DvDrip DivX7
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157705/

Plot: In 1977, Roman Polanski was arrested in Los Angeles on charges he gave drugs and had sex with a 13-year-old girl he was photographing for Vogue. Eleven months later, having pled guilty to one count, he fled to Europe before sentencing. This film examines that year-long period, using archival footage of the media frenzy and of Polanski's life before the charges, clips from his films, and contemporary interviews with many of the principles - attorneys, the victim, and Polanski's friends and associates. Polanski remains enigmatic, but portraits emerge of the machinations of justice and of a judge more interested in his image than his word or the law.

Roman Polanski, Pedro AlmodÃ³var, Nicolas Cage, Michael Caine, Mia Farrow,
Harrison Ford, Faye Dunaway
