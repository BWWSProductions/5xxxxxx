ABC just needs to find a better day to air it instead of Sunday nights! Any company should know not to air any show on sunday nights, HBO owns the Sunday nights!"
,kirk82,2009-10-04T07:48Z,"Thanks
I was hoping someone would put this up. I hate that one Network has canclled this and Space may leave in Limbo for months on it's out come.  Keep Posting You Rock!!"
,BlacklistedDwarf411,2009-10-04T08:15Z,"Thanks a load.  ABC dropped the ball on this one.  The show is pretty good despite the absolute lack of marketing by ABC.  

From what I hear they haven't cancelled it and that was a rumor.  I know they plan to carry the other episodes eventually but we'll have to see if they actually give us a second season.  So far the show seems to be targeted at a one season total.  

Yay for our canadian brothers!"
,joshmrcl,2009-10-04T08:29Z,good man thank you keep doin what you do bro
,joshokie,2009-10-04T08:48Z,"thanks, great series i hope it survives."
,joshokie,2009-10-04T09:06Z,"in addition, ""Grey's Anatomy in space"" is a very poor tagline."
,BlacklistedDwarf411,2009-10-04T09:15Z,Works. 100%.  Thank you err0001!
,President_Kush,2009-10-04T09:24Z,you rule man.  thanks.  was worried i wouldn't see the last 4.
,joshmrcl,2009-10-04T10:25Z,anybody know if a 720p vrsion is floatin around. if i can get that ill seed this at 250kb for the next 2 days straight
[V],err0001,2009-10-04T10:26Z,"Wow! Definitely the most popular torrent I've ever posted.

Based on the level of interest, I'll definitely upload the remaining 3 eps if Space broadcasts them.

The guide info on my TV system shows that eps 11 & 12 are on the next 2 Fridays. And hopefully, ep 13 the week after.

Apologies for the quality - I'm not a pro at this by any means. But it is definitely watchable and I figured that since no one else had posted it, it was up to me."
,joshmrcl,2009-10-04T10:31Z,and we all thank you for it ;)
,Lobelia72,2009-10-04T11:06Z,"I thought this one was lost by now - yeah no wonder it's a popular torrent :D

The first broadcast had a few video glitches. Hopefully the second broadcast in a few hours will be clean. I'll upload what I have within the next 18 hours or so (I need to get some sleep soon).

I'll try to upload it as soon as I can."
