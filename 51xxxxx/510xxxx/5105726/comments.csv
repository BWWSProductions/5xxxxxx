Babyboo, where are u getting ur fact the Rush Limbaugh webstie?..Or do u do like most people and pull numbers out of ur smelly ass...Because if u dont provide facts to back up ur statements than that exactly what u did...After reading the New Haven Register I found this article...The group considered all state and local taxes that individuals pay to reach its conclusions. It found the wealthiest 1 percent of families paid taxes on only 7.3 percent of their total income ? and, after the federal income tax offset, just 5.2 percent.

People neglect to highlight tax deduction as a way to reduce taxes...So babyboo ur 70% was a lie but I expect nothing less from a certified idiot...END"

""Deductions for AGI (Deductions from gross income allowed in arriving AGI or above the line deductions)

For the 2006 tax year, some examples of the deductions from gross income allowable in computing AGI include:
Certain business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials;
Health savings account deductions;
Certain moving expenses;
One-half of self-employment tax;
Penalties on early withdrawal of savings;
Alimony paid;
Deduction for contribution to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA); and
Student Loan interest deduction.

The above list is not comprehensive. The deductions allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income should not be confused with itemized deductions such as home mortgage interest expense, medical expenses, property taxes, charitable contributions, etc. For a complete list of deductions that help you compute your AGI, see ยง62 of the Internal Revenue Code.""  - From wikipedia

I suspect even these links are likely wasted on little trick.  It is like trying to reason with someone who thinks the world is 6000 years old.  They are so blinded by their their faith that no matter what evidence is presented, they will cling to their dogma."

Top 1% Paid More in Federal Income Taxes Than Bottom 95% in ?07

For comparison, here?s a chart showing the portion of adjusted gross income earned by the top 1 percent and by the bottom 95 percent. You?ll see that one major reason why the share of taxes paid by the richest Americans has risen is that the richest Americans have experienced much greater income growth

http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/top-1-paid-more-in-federal-income-taxes-than-bottom-95-in-07/

10% is obviously different than 1%...Paying over 70% is definitely different from paying more Federal Income tax...Now let look into the numbers...Folks this is why I (or anyone else) ask for evidence to be presented...1% represents the upper class or super rich with income $500,000 and above...Example Top level executives like David Stern or Roger Goodell...The upper middle class has an income range of above $100,000 and this includes people like Doctors, Lawyers, or Joe the Plumber (LOL)...Now go back to the New Times articles where it says the Bottom 95% which the Lower class, the poor, people making less than $18,000 a year...Now going back to people who earn 100k which are the upper middle class...Now the New Times article was comparing the Super Rich with the Poor (someone working at burgerking) Do you see how I destroy Babyboo's argument when he presents facts...END 48-1(48KO'S) Who's your Daddy?

,booboo332,2009-10-02T06:03Z,"Nice try but no pickle, little trick.

The point, which you have failed to disprove, was that the middle class do not pay most of the taxes.  This was your original assertion and you have not defended it.  Your quote "". . . the middle class the people who pay majority of the taxes in this country. . .""

And for the record, the majority of people making over 100k a year are technically small business owners who also incidentally:

? Represent 99.7 percent of all employer 
firms. 
? Employ just over half of all private sector employees. 
? Pay 44 percent of total U.S. private payroll. 
? Have generated 64 percent of net new jobs over the past 15 years. 
? Create more than half of the nonfarm private gross domestic product (GDP). 
? Hire 40 percent of high tech workers (such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers). 
? Are 52 percent home-based and 2 percent franchises.

The corrupt and merely self interested alike will always find ways to keep their assets out of site.  Some use off shore ventures or other difficult to track methods and some prefer to truck in the perks of power, influence and favors.  Also, all of these methods include many of the people you support.  Look no further than Chicago for some recent examples of this.

If you think the social democrats are any less corrupt or any different than those you hate, you are just another one of their disposable minions.
