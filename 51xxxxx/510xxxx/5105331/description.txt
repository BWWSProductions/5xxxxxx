Primer - WS - DD2.0 - NTSC - DVD5 - 2004


At night and on weekends, four men in a suburban garage have built a cottage 
industry of error-checking devices. But, they know that there is something 
more. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that 
is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through 
trial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, 
two of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too 
valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when 
they are faced with the question, If you always want what you can't have, 
what do you want when you can have anything?

DISCUSSION:

A PrimerMovie.com forums thread discussing the grain in the film.

I have also included in this torrent a Primer timeline JPEG and a txt file 
with 10 tips for watching and UNDERSTANDING the film.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For one to truely enjoy this film, you must understand it. With that said, my suggestion is to make use of and follow the guidelines in the txt file titled 10_Tips_2_Primer.txt located in the Extras directory included with this torrent.

Don't even look at the Timeline untill you've watched the movie all the way through the first time, as it DOES contain spoilers about the film. Being completely confused the first time around is part of the experience.
