ADDITIONAL INFORMATiON:

Celebrating 10 years together, Phillips, Craig, and Dean join the rapidly increasing numbers of contemporary Christian artists who are releasing praise-and-worship collections. While there are a couple of self-penned tunes here--including Dan Dean's humble and reverent "Pour My Love on You"--the trio pulls material mostly from today's top praise-and-worship writers like Matt Redman and Paul Baloche. The group's classic three-part harmonies soar on the choruses of "Come, Now Is the Time to Worship" and Baloche's "Open the Eyes of My Heart." You'll also enjoy the pulsating rhythms of "Let Everything That Has Breath," punctuated by a nifty horn section. Otherwise, listeners will find the trio offering standard and steady readings of worshipful devotions done in the quality style so typical of Phillips, Craig, and Dean.
