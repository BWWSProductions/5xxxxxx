The 19th Century best-seller set in a mysterious African kingdom explores the complex themes of imperial arrogance, sexual obsession, power and isolation that lie behind the high adventure. 

Ludwig Holly and his ward Leo's quest for the truth behind the legend of Leo's ancestry takes them to Africa, where they find Ayesha, 2,000 years old but beautiful beyond all description, despotically ruling her secret kingdom. 

Ayesha, the queen whose beauty enthrals and terrifies all who see her, believes Leo to be the lover for whom she has waited 2,000 years.
