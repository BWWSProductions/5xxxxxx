Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

9/28/09 Rundown: Opie sees U2, Ant on RedEye, Ron and Fez Party, 
Ant at Yankee's, Dawn's Wedding, SNL F bombs, Jim takes it up the
rear, Psychics, Bob Kelly calls and talks Fly Fishing.

Note: they went to break and never came back live - short show,
those lazy golfers.



Note: I'm planning on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a 
logistics thing) in December of this year. No point in upping 
when someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 months to 
find a reliable O&A upper to serve the pests.

Edit: If worse comes to worse I can still do the 128k ups in the
evenings post December, it's better than nothing.
