Aspiring scientist Eiji (Sadao Abe) concocts an amazing painkiller in this over-the-top orgy of blood and eroticism from cult filmmaker Hisayasu Sato. Wanting to test his potion, he secretly slips it to three young women undergoing experiments conducted by his scientist mother. The drug turns pain into sexual pleasure, and, as the substance infuses their bodies, the women start hurting themselves in increasingly intense acts of self-mutilation.
