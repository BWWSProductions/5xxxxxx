AutodeskÂ® MoldflowÂ® Adviser software, part of the Autodesk solution      Â°
 Â°  for Digital Prototyping, provides easy-to-use tools that help you to     Â°
 Â°  simulate and optimize your part, mold, and tool designs long before      Â°
 Â°  manufacturing begins. By using a digital prototype to simulate the       Â°
 Â°  injection molding process, you can reduce the number of physical         Â°
 Â°  prototypes required to perfect a design and get your products to         Â°
 Â°  market faster.                                                           Â°

 Â°  AutodeskÂ® MoldflowÂ® Insight injection molding simulation software,       Â°
 Â°  part of the Autodesk solution for Digital Prototyping, provides a        Â°
 Â°  complete set of advanced plastics engineering simulation tools for use   Â°
 Â°  on digital prototypes. Providing in-depth analysis and optimization of   Â°
 Â°  plastic parts and their associated molds, Moldflow Insight offers        Â°
 Â°  powerful functionality that can simulate the most advanced molding       Â°
 Â°  processes in use today.                                                  Â°
