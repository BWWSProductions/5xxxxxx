,goldrush1,2011-06-02T19:26Z,Its working for me...Dont ask me how...I tried to play with lmtools
,griffix,2011-06-07T11:36Z,"I've got it to work, so here's everything I did. It involves two processes: 1.) Install an earlier version first and get that to work 2.) Install the version in this torrent.

Keep Firewalls, antivirus and internet connection disabled throughout the install. I don't like the idea either...but it's all I could do to get this to work.

PART 1:
--------------------------------
First, download and install this earlier version. Google: 'MOLDFLOW_PLASTICS_ADVISERS_V7.3-LND'

--> Diable internet connection, firewall and antivirus
--> Extract all the files (I had to disable my antivirus as one of the files MF2007_fix.exe shows as a virus)
--> Run the install file mpa730_06114_pc.exe

When it prompts for server name, make sure that you enter the right name of your computer. Right-click on 'My Computer' go the the 'Computer Name' tab and see where it says 'Full computer name'.

--> Put this in the server name of the installer and continue
--> Keep the 'Obtain licence keys' box checked and click YES
--> Click NEXT
--> Then cancel the 'Moldflow Electronic Registration Window'
--> (You might need to click 'Register Later'...)

--> Start -> Run -> services.msc
--> Find the service ""Moldflow Product Security"", right click and STOP the service. Leave the services window open.
--> Patch the folders as decribed in the install.txt file in the LEGEND directory.
--> Go back to the services window and restart the ""Moldflow Product Security"" service. Wait just over a minute (I don't know if this wait does anything...it's in the install instructions do I just did it)
--> You can now close the services window and run the Mold Advisor 7.3 application. It is necessary to attempt to import a model such as an STL file to ensure the software works and is licenced. 

It is essential that you get the above version up and running without any licence problems when you import models and perform analysis' on them."
,griffix,2011-06-07T11:36Z,"PART 2:
---------------------------------------
--> Install Moldflow Insight 2010. Leave folders on default locations.
--> The installer will soon start the Autodesk Licence Manager (Moldflow) setup wizard. 
--> Select Client and Server
--> Enter your computer name (as done previously) without any formatting or symbols - remove any colons that might be there. Just the name is needed
--> Uncheck 'Activate Licences Online' and click Finish
--> Close all the installer windows

--> Start -> Run -> services.msc
--> Stop the following Services in the following order: Moldflow Product Security & Autodesk Licence Manager (Moldflow)
--> Leave the services window open

--> Copy the files (in the MAGNiTUDE folder)into the corresponding locations

--> Run 'LMTOOLS' - there should be a shortcut on the desktop / start menu
--> Config Services Tab --> In service name type 'Autodesk Network License Manager'. Browse to lmgrd.exe file. Browse to licence file (just change file types to .dat when browsing and you'll see the file you copied their earlier). Browse to log file (Just create a text file somewere, call it logfile.log and copy it into the location where you're being prompted to browse). Select that log file.
--> Check the box that says 'Use Services'. I have not tried checking the 'Start server at startup', but it should still work with it checked.
--> Save Service - Yes, then go to the START/STOP/REREAD tab. Do nothing yet...
--> Go back to the services window and restart the two previously stopped services...doing the Moldflow Product Security Service First, then the other one
--> Go back to the LMTOOLS window, and Start Server for the Autodesk Network Licence Manager. 

--> Now run 'Autodesk Moldflow Insight 2010', keeping all internet disabled and it should be working. If it is, you're almost there:

--> Restart the Installer application, and install A'utodesk Moldflow Advisor 2010'. Just go through all the screens. I selected the 'Classic' option for the workspace selection. And didn't install any other plugin components.
--> When the install is done and the Autodesk Licence Manager (Moldflow) Setup Wizard starts, just click CANCEL -> YES
--> CLick finish and close all installer windows.
--> If you're still here, you should be able to run 'Autodesk Moldflow Advisor 2010'. Just keep internet access and firewalls disabled."
,griffix,2011-06-07T12:07Z,"Just few more things which might help:

 If you've attempted a previous install then just make sure everything is removed. in the Control Panel, Remove Programs and uninstall any applications with the words 'moldflow' and 'autodesk' in them. 
(Be careful not to uninstall an Autodesk application if you're using another of their software packages)

Go into your /Program Files directory and delete any directories with the words 'moldflow' and 'autodesk' in them.

Get CCleaner, clean your hard-drive and do a registry scan to remove any registry entries.

I've tried without first installing the earlier version and it doesn't work. But, using that monstrosity of a method above, I've installed it (and it works) on two different computers."
,griffix,2011-06-08T15:59Z,"One of my computers lost its license after rebooting...possibly due to the internet connection coming on automatically. The earlier 7.3 version still works though, and I suspect I'll just stick to using that. The computer that stays on seems to have kept it's license and the 2010 version still works on it.

**This has to be the most time spent trying to get a crack to work...**
