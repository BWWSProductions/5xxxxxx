Kymatica
--------

The sequel to the Esoteric Agenda, this movie focuses on human and universal consciousness and points out psyche disease that mankind has induced that is creating insane illusion which is the main cause of pain and suffer. Goes deeper into metaphysical aspects and connects ancient hidden myths and history with modern ways of society and political outcome. Explains shamanism, duality, and reality behind DNAs and modern false beliefs. Overall, Kymatica is another excellent movie which attempts to point out the fundamental misconception that humankind are facing today that has resulted in imbalance between planet, nature and species.
