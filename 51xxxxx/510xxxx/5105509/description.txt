Alternative Health Special

Date: 09-29-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Dr. Anthony Horan, Dr. Fred Bisci, Dr. Michael Holick, Dr. Len Saputo, Dr. Leonard Horowitz

In a special 4-hour show, five different guests addressed various alternative health and medical issues. Appearing during the first hour, Dr. Len Horowitz reported on vaccine dangers, citing the recent case of a teenage girl in the U.K. who died immediately after receiving a vaccine said to protect against the human papilloma virus. Such vaccines have ingredients like mercury and adjuvants that are "hideously toxic," he exclaimed. Len Saputo M.D. spoke about the importance of using a holistic approach in medicine. People should only consider drugs/surgery for a medical problem after they have exhausted other avenues, such as lifestyle changes, and vitamins/supplements, he advised.

Appearing in the second hour, Dr. Anthony Horan detailed how the PSA blood test returns far too many false positives (as high as 70%) in diagnosing prostate cancer. Further, procedures to treat prostate cancer such as radical surgery and radiation may cause more problems than they fix, he noted. A patient with prostate cancer (which is one of slowest acting cancers) would be better off having a "limited freeze" (cryotherapry) of the primary site, which would stall the spread of the disease, he detailed. Horan also recommended a heart healthy/low fat diet to reduce the chances of getting prostate cancer.

Dr. Fred Bisci discussed reversing Type 2 diabetes with a raw food or health regimen diet. He characterized Type 2 diabetes as lifestyle related, brought on by eating too many processed foods. While there are different emphases in raw food, such as fruit vs. greens/sprouts, the common denominator in healing, is leaving out the processed and unhealthy foods, he said.

Last hour guest, Dr. Michael Holick addressed how Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in America, and can lead to various diseases. People are no longer getting enough Vitamin D from sun exposure, and he recommended taking daily supplements of it-- 1,500-2,000 IU for adults, and 1,000 IU for children. People should always wear sun protection on the face, but he suggested they expose their arms and legs to direct sunshine at least a couple times a week.
