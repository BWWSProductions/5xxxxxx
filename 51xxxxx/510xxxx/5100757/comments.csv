Downloaded it, and burned it via Burn Image from Nero.

,NyteLynx,2009-12-24T07:53Z,"@BJonkman heres some advice, before you ever burn ur wii games, patch it with wiibrickblocker (google) this ensures that u do not need to go through with the patch as ive heard some games will...semi-brick ur wii? or screw it up, its what i do and now i never get the update notice"
