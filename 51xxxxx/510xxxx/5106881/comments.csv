,trickdaddy0024,2009-10-02T01:07Z,Rep. Alan Grayson you did good...Rush Limbaugh was forced to address your comments today...What this mean is that this Healthcare debate is not DEAD but has just begun...END
,booboo332,2009-10-02T02:03Z,"Debate is to be encouraged.  Pushing through nebulous and unread bills through bullying and disinformation are contemptible and will have far reaching consequences.  Also to be fair, it should also be pointed out that this is not a sin unique to the Democrats.  

Say what you will about her and her ideas, at least Hillary had the balls to put her proposition up before public scrutiny before it was voted on.  

This is not about improving healthcare or compassion.  It is about control and power."
,AladinSane1984,2009-10-02T04:53Z,"To quote El Rushbo - ""words, just words""
Rush - born to host
SistroDickDaddy- born to listen
Kneel slave!"
,trickdaddy0024,2009-10-02T05:27Z,The Healthcare Debate cannot go anywhere when the Leader of your Party is named Rush Limbaugh...Limbaugh has commanded his followers to say NO to any and everything...I hope he fails is one of his famous lines...Rep. Alan Grayson (D) has the guts to take on the Republicans and there leaders...The Democrats will be criticized because we have the majority and have do nothing...I dont know where you guys come from but where I come from MAJORITY RULE...END

,AladinSane1984,2009-10-02T05:46Z,"Unlike you moron, I do not use a tele-prompter.
So keep dribbling onto your bib.
Like a moth to a flame, your arguments get burned up by the Rushmeiter.
Plain enough for even you fools in Rio Linda to understand.
As Alex Jones says - kneel slave, take the vaccine, drink the fluoride, submit to the new world orlder.
Bwaaahaa"
,AladinSane1984,2009-10-02T05:51Z,"Oh veay, this is not a democracy.  It is a representive republic.  The Fonding Fathers knew that the minority shuld be protected from the majority.  Being a Leftits (typo), you should feel compassion for a minority, right (that is minority rights for you in Rio Linda?"

Obama-words,just words
Clintons-ditto
Pelosi-ditto
Reid=ditto
ergo, dildoheads (typo)
Your babble fits right in with them.
I will get to your ward in just a few minutes, so go back to your room and be patient."
,booboo332,2009-10-02T07:22Z,"For some one who keeps saying ""words, just words"" you certainly like using them.  If I didn't know better, I'd think you were some Dem trying make conservatives look bad by posing as a nut.

If you really are a fan of Rush and liberty, you may want to hit that bottle after you post your comments for all of the world to see.  But suit yourself, It is pretty entertaining."
,AladinSane1984,2009-10-02T11:51Z,"Last line is spot on, mate.
I was born to rant
You were born to listen

Just having some laughs, for those of you in Rio Linda

I have been a recovering rushaholic from the days he started at wabc 770 am, his flagship station,
Listening to him  as he sat in the attila the hun chair, whilst firmly ensconced behind the golden eib microphone

Charter memeber, since 1988, of the ""Schruel"" for Advanced Conservative studie"".

That was when a 14,400 baud modem was described as ""bistering fast?  And the 56k modem with a 330mhz processor was the answer to my prayers.

When Compuserve was king. for those of you in Rio Linda."
