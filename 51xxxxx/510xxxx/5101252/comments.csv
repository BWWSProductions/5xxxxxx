,AceMusic,2009-09-29T22:30Z,700 mb brrip? hows the quality?
,Marilynsmovies,2009-10-02T18:13Z,"Thanks for the download.
Greetings from Nova Scotia"
,toct53,2009-10-07T01:42Z,"Somehow, I can't believe this is a BR rip. I haven't downloaded it to confirm, so feel free to correct me. But the file size seems too small for a BR rip. The DVD rip is 690 - 700 MB itself."
,homernet,2009-10-07T04:40Z,You seem to have got the audio right on this one.
