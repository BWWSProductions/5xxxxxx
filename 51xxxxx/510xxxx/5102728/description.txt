I have found & tested a mod for GTA SA.  So seeing that there are many broken mods out there...Here is a working mod. I take no credit or blame for the way it does or does not work.  I would suggest google &for assistance if you can not install it properly.


Use WinRAR or WinZip to upzip. Read the Read ME txt file. There is one for noobs too. Have fun.

Sharing is caring. Caring is another word for Seed please.


This is for the PC
