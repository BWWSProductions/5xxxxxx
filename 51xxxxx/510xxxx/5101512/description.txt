David Copperfield is a novel by Charles Dickens and is the Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery.

First published in 1850. Like all except five of his works, it originally appeared in serial form (published in monthly installments). 

Many elements within the novel follow events in Dickens' own life, and it is probably the most autobiographical of all of his novels.

In the preface to the 1867 Charles Dickens edition, he wrote, 
"â€¦ like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield."
