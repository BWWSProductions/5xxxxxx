,sanfandaman,2009-09-27T10:22Z,"Also if your files are somewhere like an external HD you should copy them (in 1 folder to somewhere more recognizable like 'my documents' and remember to save actual torrent in same folder as actual file folder. One more trick, if using utorrent, if you do make an rar. file, you have to put it in a folder with same name so utorrent can recognize it. utorrent will absolutely not upload an rar. file if it's not in a folder. hope this was helpful. Feel free to ask questions if your still having problems."
,mrbighead2,2009-09-27T11:41Z,"All good advice. A smaller torrent would have made sense. I did have the max. file per torrent issue. The torrent client is azureus, the rar file is in the same dir as the torrent file. Its uplolading ok but only via dht which must explain why tpb shows no seeders. Can't work out why the tracker keeps timing out. I know big rar's piss people off, I much prefer smaller torrents with directories but I was being lazy I guess. I'm here for the long haul though if people would like to download it. Thank for the advice, most appreciated being a newbie."
