Piano Sonatas of Russian Classical composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915). 

Scriabin was known for his unusual musical philosophies that owed much to the Theosophical Society, an organization that taught a mystical evolutionary theory and founded by fellow Russian Madame Blavatski (And also from where, with its use of the swastika, and the aryan super race, evolved Hitler's Thule Society for all its big-headed "Buddhism"). 

Needless to say that organization is in tatters now. 

Scriabin himself wished to explore the world of *synesthaesia* and of mixing the 12-tones scale with the spectrum of colours to produce transcendental music that could effect all the senses at once. Nowadays Rogan josh does this with his curries.
