After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
          
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	          
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	          
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce          
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce          
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce          
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce          
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce          
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

What follows is the merge of 4 different torrents, just to minimize, with the few bandwidth I have, the numbers of torrents I have to manage...
Also I see that bigger torrents have longer life and more seeders in the average

You can argue that this is not properly fingerstyle... but listen anyway... Enjoy...

TOMMY EMMANUEL

Tommy Emmanuel is an Australian guitarist, best known for his complex fingerpicking style, energetic performances and the use of percussive effects on the guitar.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_emmanuel  
http://www.tommyemmanuel.com/

Emmanuel has said that even at a young age he was fascinated by Atkinsâ€™ musical style â€“ sometimes referred to as Travis picking â€“ of playing bass with the thumb and melody parts with the first two or three fingers at the same time. This technique became the basis of Emmanuel's guitar style.

While Emmanuel has never had formal music training, his playing ability has won him fans from all over the world. He is known to play percussion parts on the body of his guitar. As a solo performer he never plays to a set list and uses a minimum of effects. He usually completes recordings in one take.

He frequently uses his left thumb to fret bass notes on the 5th and 6th strings as well as playing chords such as Am and E with just two fingers. He uses a thumb pick mostly, a flat pick or just fingers.


What follows is a collection of some of his albums... Enjoy...

JACK ROSE

Jack Rose is an american guitarist and composer.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Rose


His musical experience is deeply influenced by John Fahey and Robbie Basho.
Jack Rose has been a prolific recording artist in his relatively short career, with albums, EPs, and compilation tracks on no less than ten record labels. His major works are made up of the triad of consecutive full-length releases on Eclipse -- Red Horse, White Mule (2002), Opium Musick (2003), and Raag Manifestos (2004) -- in addition to his 2005 opus Kensington Blues, released by Tequila Sunrise.

In 1993 Jack Rose joined the noise/drone band Pelt, releasing a handful of albums and EPs. Rose further developed his acoustic guitar technique as the band slowly shifted from its electric roots. Although Pelt frequently went on and off hiatus during Rose's most involved periods in the band, he didn't begin to concentrate on his own recordings until the early 2000s. 2001 saw his first self-released CD-R of mostly blues and ragtime. In 2002, this new focus culminated in his public transformation from Pelt member to solo artist on his first proper full-length, Red Horse, White Mule, released by Eclipse Records.

His depth of knowledge in the traditions of blues, ragtime and Eastern music are complemented by the avant-garde and experimental spirit of Pelt. Comparisons to American primitive guitarist John Fahey are frequent, but Rose has been praised by reviewers, fans, and contemporaries alike for rising to the challenge of playing in a unique style despite his affection for music originating in decades past.

What follows is a collection of some of his albums... Enjoy...
