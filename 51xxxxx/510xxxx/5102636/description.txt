"Cavemen" was a TV show inspired by a series of Geico television ads whose brief 2007 run on the ABC network was cut short due to the Writers Guild of America strike. The six episodes comprising the latter half of the show's first season were not aired and the show was subsequently canceled. In the summer of 2008, the unreleased episodes were finally broadcast on the Seven Network in Australia.

Be forewarned that since these are TVRips, there is a channel logo overlay on all of the videos. Until these episodes are broadcast again or released on DVD, neither of which may ever happen, these are probably the best quality rips you'll be able to find.

I am only responsible for creating the torrent and take no credit for these rips. The pilot and first six episodes of Cavemen are easy to find, but as far as I know the last six episodes have not been publicly available on BitTorrent until now.
