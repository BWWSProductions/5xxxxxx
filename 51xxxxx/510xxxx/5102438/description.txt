A group of former elementary school classmates who decide to visit their ailing teacher at her home in the South Korean countryside watch their plans for an idyllic reunion crumble in this slasher flick from first-time feature director Dae-wung Lim. It's not that they've changed so much since their last meeting 16 years ago. It's just that they've been so good at hiding their pent-up frustrations about the past â€¦ until now.
