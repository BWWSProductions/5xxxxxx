Founded in Austria in 1993, The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath A Cloud was a medieval martial ambient project formed by musician Albin Julius and vocalist Alzbeth. The music was all created electronically, shifting in style from pure ambient soundscapes to pounding martial anthems, while the vocals ranged from soothing ethereal lovesongs to shouted declarations of war and destruction. All the bands releases where through their own personal label Arthur's Round Table which was based in Switzerland, and distributed by World Serpent. The group disbanded in 1998 after Albin's and Alzbeth's partnership broke up. In 2000 Alzbeth released ART 13, which is a complete Book Of Lyrics, and is stated as the final word in the project.
