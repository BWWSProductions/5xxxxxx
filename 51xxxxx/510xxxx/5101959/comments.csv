,joka2385,2010-02-16T00:34Z,Thanks for the download! After watching this I almost feel bad for getting it for free.
,well-wisher,2010-03-23T15:20Z,The audio/video is unsynchronized. To those who already downloaded it here is a quick solution: download an smplayer http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html. Set audio delay to +300ms. You can watch now without audio/video mistiming.
