Czech director Jan Svankmajer's bizarre adaptation of Lewis Carroll's children's book is considered a classic of surreal cinema. After her stuffed rabbit opens a portal inside her dresser, Alice (Kristyna KohoutovÃ¡) crosses over into a warped world of gothic props, puppets and dead animals. Svankmajer gives the Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat warped makeovers via stop-motion animation and stark cinematography.
