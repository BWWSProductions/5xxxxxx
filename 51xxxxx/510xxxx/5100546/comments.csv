Yes, when asked where to install, just select HDD = C:\ Win NTFS, with the Format & Purge by Fire option checked ... you will never be troubled by Fista again "";0))"

I tried doing so with TransMac, uncompressed the .dmg (5,52GB) and got a larger supposedly uncompressed .dmg of the side 6,7GB.
Burning went fint with no errors. But my Mac is struggling to read it to finaly spit it out.

,eddyq,2009-10-05T01:50Z,"I am loading with VMware Fusion. I converted it to an ISO using the following: ""hdiutil convert OSX\ Server\ 10.6.dmg -format UDTO -o OSX_Server_10.6.iso"" and it created OSX_Server_10.6.iso.cdr. But when VMware tried to boot to this file it caused a stack fault.

1) Does anyone know what I should do?
2) How do you use a .dmg to load a system?"

How i should install it on Intel Mac ?
Thanks"
,heppje,2009-10-10T01:33Z,"@SidDan80

You need to burn this with Disk Utility. All OS X Install Discs will only boot on Apple hardware if burned from dmg that way. Even Toast or other Mac burning applications deliver unbootable discs. 
Previously, you also needed to lock the dmgs because if you mounted them before burning, then it would corrupt (unbless) the image. I think that this is less of a problem these days, but I remember destroying a Jaguar image that way.

That said, I have no idea whether or not Panther is too old for this. I would burn at no faster than 4x for this, even if your disks will support a faster speed."
,BUZDUP,2009-10-15T15:55Z,"Great DL but key dose not work. I entered it in and work but now asks for new key.

Install via iPod/ Ext HDD

1. Mount the ""Mac OS X Install DVD.iso""
2. Plug in your iPod/ Ext HDD.
3. Open Disk Utility.
4. Select your iPod/ Ext HDD from the drive list on the left.
5. You'll see ""First Aid, Erase, Partition, RAID, Restore.""
6. Click on ""Partition.""
7. Under ""Volume Scheme"", Select ""1 Partition.""
8. Once selected, hit the ""Option"" button at the bottom of the map.
9. A window will pop-up, select the ""GUID Partition Table"" option.
10. Once its done, navigate to the ""Restore"" tab.
11. From the drive list on the left, drag the mounted Snow Leopard .iso (dmg)to the ""Source"" field, and drag your iPod/ Ext HDD to the ""Destination"" field.
12. Click ""Restore.""
13. Close Disk Utility, Open up System Preferences. Under ""System,"" choose ""Startup Disk,""
14. Your iPod/ Ext HDD should be listed as the Snow Leopard installation disk. Select and click ""Restart.""
15. Follow the instructions to install Snow Leopard.

Good Luck"

,TomKnock,2009-10-26T11:09Z,"He writes ""serial"" at the last MD5 checksum in his description, perhaps the serial is encoded with MD5?

If you reverse the MD5 for ""serial"" in Terminal with the command ""md5 -rs ed969a88035b60fb0c8aad5263ee6ba6"" you get:

4b2e2d1180dc21a9ad6859632ec6c235

Perhaps that is the serial, without the ""-""s ?

Dunno, just a thought :) I'm downloading so I have not tried it, but perhaps someone could try, and if not we'll have to find a real one, so this is just a theory ;-)

Cheers,
Tom"

,oogies,2009-12-07T15:58Z,"Serial: XSVR-106-000-N-6GG-QB4-PWN-228-W6M-VFH-L  (this one works as i have updated my snow leopard server and put in this key after i was blocked, im on and working again.)

Here is a another one but have not tried it before.
XSVR-106-000-R-LN2-VLQ-PRW-H6C-44L-XH2-P

I was previously using the key everyone has: the 
XSVR-105-010-R-MBM-SD4-PSM-97L-WXJ-YDN-M
This key works on install but after update is broken, just use the top one then (ending with L)

,TrizzB,2009-12-17T01:59Z,I'm very new to this so thanks in advance... Will I be able to upgrade from 10.4.11 and still be able to keep all programs already installed on the Mac? I have a lot of music and editing programs I don't want to lose.
,jacques.paul,2009-12-18T13:23Z,"Worked perfectly for me including the serial even after update to 10.6.2.
Do not open the OSX Server 10.6.dmg most of the time that will corrupt it. Lock it (get info and check locked).
On a Mac use Disk Utility to burn it to a DVD (not Toast).
Boot from the DVD and install.
Be sure to print the serial before installing otherwise you will be blocked (no access to the Text Edith document once installed and asked to enter the serial)"

,macomaniac,2012-01-31T06:05Z,"@ Mac users. That file is very precious, for persons running already Lion, and wanting to run back Snow Leopard as a VIRTUAL MACHINE (through Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion).

Reasons of that : 1) Snow Leopard is the last OS to support ROSETTA, the invisible emulation layer enabling to run PPC apps (emulation layer dropped down by Lion, which ends with PPC apps no longer being supported by Lion) ; 2) Only SERVER versions of such OS as Snow Leopard are allowed to be virtualized, and not CLIENT ones.

To perform the virtualization of Snow Leopard as guest under Lion as host, just download this .dmg file on your Mac desktop. Besides that, download and install on your Mac either Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion from ThePirateBay. Once done, ask for the creation of a new Virtual Machine, indicate the path of the .dmg file of SnowLeopard Server as system to be installed, write down the serial given with the file when asked, and the installation of Snow Leopard Server will be performed without trouble. You are able after that to update that virtual OS from 10.6.2 up to 10.6.8 without problem, and use it as a true OS, connected to internet through Lion host, with any CD, DVD, external Hard Drives mountable on the virtual desktop, and either usable in window mode or in full screen mode.

From my own experience (I run Snow Leopard Server 10.6.8 as Virtual Machine through Parallels Desktop on Lion 10.7.2 host), everything works nicely. I repeat it : very useful at running back PPC apps when having updated to Lion as main OS."
