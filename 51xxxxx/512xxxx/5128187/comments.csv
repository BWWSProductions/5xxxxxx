,33rdegree,2009-10-18T08:07Z,"I hate these stupid NoFS releases. why in the eff would a 'radio rip' be transferred to CD then ripped to mp3, just share the highest possible quality, why do you have to make these all complicated, pretending you have something cool, when in any and all cases you've ripped this off from a more credible source. I don't rely on any of your releases so you hopefully this comment discourages you into NOT releasing any more of your garbage & you stop making these asinine claims of ""CD"" rips, if you really do have access to said CD prove it by making a lossless rip. what do you have to lose? I'd really like to know why this is from a CD?? is it directly from a SHADE45 radio station?? is it their transfer. where did it originate from before it was burned to CD, an over the AIR transfer, plz I'd like to know..."

,33rdegree,2009-10-19T09:00Z,"well I've calmed down, since... I'm just an audiophile who care about sound way too much. if there is a higher quality than the mp3 rip you either made or have I dare you to up load it. otherwise I apologize for my comment. if I could I would delete it, if a mod could that would be nice too, all is well... PEACE! "
