,ghost18ghost,2009-11-18T20:13Z,"The problem is: It can't sync it stops at about 99% and says the 69(in my case) are not syncronised (or put on my itouch)

Greetz again."
[T],spotswood,2009-11-22T18:20Z,"Need some quick advice, I think I turned the wrong direction.  I follow the steps to the ""T"", but it only shows the app in my itunes (applications section) and hasn't transferred to my iphone.  

What do i do?"
,maguzzi,2009-12-21T12:45Z,"sorry but it is very very stupid to share everything in one .rar file. if you want just one or two apps you have to download whole 4,5gb package.

you kids should not put new torrents to the web because this is result, everything is a mess."
,J33SEJ,2010-01-09T14:27Z,"Ok first off you will need to Jailbreak ur ipod touch/phone easiest thing you will ever do belive me! Just search for Blackra1n on the bay and download (All you have to do is litterally download it connect ur touch/phone have i tunes running leave it running and run the Blackra1n program on ur pc)
DONE!
Once you have done this you will see it on ur touch/phone press it and install new browsers nothing scary just install cydia once you have done so launch cydia and on ur bottom row of buttons you will see MANAGE 
Go to this and you should see sources (a list of addresses) go to edit and add cydia.hackulo.us it should already provide the http bit for you...
Then add it and Holy shit this is the best thing ever! lol
Warning you will get some spam shite message saying what u are doin hurts the poor people at Apple's pockets just click ok after laughing at it then ur away download any game u like from here as long as its not rar'd once dpwnloaded just double click the said game/app and it will be added instantly to ur itunes then sync ur touch/phone hey presto enjoy.

Info from IPHONETEAM tried and tested thanks guys and Thanks to MalCypresSHiLL for this up!


@ Maguzzi.....
If you dont have anything helpfull to say try not saying anything! Everyone starts somewhere!"
,rasmusew,2010-01-20T02:11Z,"To start with it would help if you cracked the apps/games you uploaded. 20+ of them did not work on my phone running 3.2, some were in a foreign language, some told me i had an invalid licence. As stated before a complete list would have been helpful. Some of the files didnt even exist, putting 2 or 3 of the same app with a different person cracking it is a waste of time, 1 would have done. For the few that did work, thank you, most enjoyable."
,Hower_Power,2010-04-05T05:24Z,"You were stupid to put everything into one rar file, I only want 2 or 3 of the apps and I now have to download 4gbs of useless crap!"
