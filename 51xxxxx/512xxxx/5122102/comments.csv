,chair_tard,2009-10-13T04:03Z,"Love you eztv. But Instant Karma is episode 5. 
You see... the two episodes of the season were released on the same night... Broken Pt1 & Pt2...

,The0ry,2009-10-13T05:12Z,"chair_tard  Ep 1 and Ep 2 were released the same night but in actuality the ep names are Broken and Epic fail. 

Check out the House home page.

,sotonin,2009-10-13T05:14Z,"Actually chair_tard you are wrong. 

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/episodes#season-6

Instant Karma is ep 4"
,sotonin,2009-10-13T05:17Z,"To further clarify, ep 1 broken was a two hour episode. But it is still only 1 episode."
,leroy0jenkins,2009-10-13T05:29Z,"it was a two part, single episode in the US but most everywhere else it was released as two seperate episodes"
,Fox_Almighty,2009-10-13T05:59Z,"Who cares what episode number it is... he supplies us with top quality and right away after it's aired... If you don't like the episode number, just change it after your done downloading/uploading.

Besides, other websites confirm that it is episode 4... don't believe everything you read on wikipedia... I'd link you to the House main episode list website but since TPB made it improbable for me to figure out how to get it in the comments section... you'll have to google it.

Thanks for all the shows you've ever uploaded here.  :)"

,Kristo-,2009-10-13T11:49Z,"karidius, would you please shut the fuck up already.

Episode 1 was a 2 hour special, ERGO IT WAS JUST 1 EPISODE. Is that too hard to comprehend?

Just end this pointless debate, if you are dumb enough to argue with IMDB, then do it in your own little fairy land."

,Enterhase,2009-10-13T18:08Z,"Even though it's the fourth episode released, it's officially episode *number* 5.

If anyone should know, it's Fox: http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/s6_e05.htm"
,masterac,2009-10-13T21:42Z,"don't feed the troll,this episode is number 4"
,machloop,2009-10-13T21:58Z,"This is S06E05 - the first episode is actually 1&2.

Sorry to be padantic but this will cause great confusion later in the series if it is not sorted now.
"
,chair_tard,2009-10-14T02:22Z,"Thanks for caring about accuracy, Enterhase, leroy0jenkins, Machloop & karidius.

You other trollish doods (specifically referring to The0ry, sotonin, Fox_Almighty, Kristo-, masterac - I'm afraid you're all wrong), imdb isn't authoritative. Fox, however, is, and the wiki follows Fox, it's just easier to view.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_House_episodes#Season_6:_2009.E2.80.932010

Again, eztv, you reign supreme... but this double episode as the season premier is going to cause confusion for the rest of the season unless its nipped in the bud. Can't we get back in proper sync for next week? I suppose so long as the episode title is included, it doesn't matter so much, but it's always nice to have accuracy. Thanks. Thanks, and thanks again."
,Damien74,2009-10-14T04:07Z,"This IS episode 4. 
What's the deal? Just check the websites.. TV.com or tvrage.com or whatever. IMDB is actually wrong quite often, they are not exactly specialised on TV Episodes."
,DrLe,2009-10-14T04:42Z,"@damien

PLEASE enlighten me on how this episode is four and not five. It seems you failed to click on the Fox link provided by Enterhase.

Visit that link before making a fool of yourself again."
,saluqi,2009-10-14T18:23Z,"thanks ... where I live, I wouldn't see this episode for another two years"
,masterac,2009-10-14T21:11Z,"THIS IS EPISODE 4

can all of you get it?
just go to the house official site to see.

episode 1 was divide in 2 part....but if your clever enough to get the word ""part"" you can then imagine it was divise to put a lot of commercials between.

then episode 2 was EPIC FAIL
then episode 3 was THE TYRAN
then episode 4 is INSTANT KARMA

GO SEE THE OFFICIAL SITE ....and shut up.

maybe this time everyone will get the adress right and see the correct order of the episode

there you can see the first episode is 01:28:46 (i give you the second has a bonus)

have a nice day (even if it's raining)"
,chair_tard,2009-10-15T00:57Z,"Ah, so it is agreed then, as it is quite clear, as the season premier was a TWO parter, the first TWO episodes were released on the same night, thus making this episode, Instant Karma, episode FIVE (5). Thanks, masterac for clearing that up."
,Enterhase,2009-10-16T01:46Z,"Since there has been a lot of debate (i.e., flaming) about this, I decided to go ahead and write an e-mail to Ask Fox (Ask.Fox@fox.com) so that FOX would explain. Here's what they said:

""It can be either - depending on how you define the 2-Hour Premiere.  The scheduling/programming Departments consider every hour an episode - and so the 2-Hour premiere was numbered 601/602 - each hour given a number - and at the end of the day, production is making 22 hours of the show this season - two of which count as the 2-Hour Premiere - but it is, afterall, just one episode - so on FOX ON DEMAND they have 4 episodes - one of which happens to be a 2-Hour ep.""

So that's the definitive answer, guys. It can be either. I prefer to think that it's episode 5, but that's just my bureaucratic nature.

Cheers!"

,Ind0,2009-10-19T16:32Z,"Since when are two parts of one episode concidered to be two episodes? This is episode 4, simple."
,Fox_Almighty,2009-10-20T05:57Z,"Thank you Enterhase for officially confirming that this is in fact episode 4. Hopefully other ppl will read what you wrote so they can stop bitching about what episode number it is.

Now, all things aside, where's episode 5, lol... I want it now!, it was good, though Chase was as usual, a total idiot in that episode (not this episode... the next one)."
,JMan1c1347,2009-11-15T05:05Z,"Everyone is screwing up the numbers...
""Technically"" nothing...
Wikipedia nothing... 
imdb nothing...
Enterhase's bureaucratic nature nothing...

Some of these genius need to check the...
I don't know... the FOX website...
you know... the ones AIRING the show...

It's about time some uploaders got the 
episode number right.  Thx eztv.
