These are the Japanese language themes for the television anime éŠæˆ¯çŽ‹/Yu-Gi-Oh/Yuugi-Ou/etc. The themes from the 1998 Toei Animation version are included. The songs are in their full versions, not the "TV Size" versions. You need to have a Japanese IME (input method editor) to view the titles of about half of these.
