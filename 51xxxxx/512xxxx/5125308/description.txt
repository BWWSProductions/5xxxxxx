Oh boy, it is almost closing time and there is still a mess in the storage
place. If you do not clean up very soon, the boss will be mad and you will
have to work overtime.

Put the crates and other items back to their places. Take note, that you
can only push the items! It is not possible to pull them. Use your mind
and be clever, because there is always a solution, but sometimes it may be
hard to find it.

You will be challenged in 80 levels. The higher the level you are in, the
harder the task. Sometimes there will obstacles in your way. You have to
rethink and quickly bypass them to be successful.

Cleaning up can be lots of fun, especially when the graphics are so new
and great! You can use auto-mapping to stay ahead of things. It is even
possible to create your own levels with the integrated level editor.

Stay calm and do your work!
