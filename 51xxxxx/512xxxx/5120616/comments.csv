,wilsonb,2009-10-13T04:57Z,"Well, this does work... 
I used Windows 7 - as Admin
Iphone 3Gs 3.2.1

After it installs an unknown ""APP"" (I thought it was risky to..)
The App has options  to install Cydia, Ice, or Rocks


**** BUT ****
When trying to install apps via ICE for example, it says 
setuid: Operation not permitted
setgid: Operation not permitted
dpkg: requested operation requires superuser privilege.


Apparently, the app doesn't give you root access to write or something.. 
Can someone clarify..?"
,ucnthng,2009-10-13T14:49Z,you probally shouldn't even install ice for some reason every time I have read anything they say not to install ice with cidia. that happened to me last night also but I tried a few more times and it worked as far as the hangup

,scottsrake,2009-10-14T23:03Z,i just got it to work on 3gs 3.1.2....swithced pc's to a XP instead of vista and worked flawlessly!!
,zugzug,2009-10-21T21:31Z,"Here is how I got it to work on both iPhone 3G & 3GS with iTunes 9 on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit and Vista Ultimate 64 bit.

1. Make sure you iPhone is patched to 3.1.2 and you have a full backup done before you do this.
2. Exit iTunes
3. Connect your iPhone via USB, make sure iTunes does not start!
4. Move blackra1n.exe to your C:\ drive's root i.e. C:\
5. Check Task Manager for any iTunes processes running and kill them. For me these included iTunesHelper.exe, AppleMobileDeviceService.exe and iPodService.exe
6. Run BlackRa1n.exe as Administrator (right click, ""Run as Administrator"")
7. Click ""make it ra1n""
8. Hold down home and power button, as soon as you see the apple logo release the power button, continue to hold the home button.
9. Release home button when you see the blackra1n/geohot's picture.
10. Wait for it to complete. Your iPhone will need to be restarted one last time. 

NOTE: You might have to repeat #8 a few times to get it to work."
,saftool,2009-10-28T15:52Z,I have 3gs with 3.0 on it jailbroken. DO I just upgrade to 3.1.2 and use this program or do i need to do something else to prepare?
