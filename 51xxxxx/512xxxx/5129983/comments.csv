,psyk1ck,2010-08-10T03:34Z,"This one WORKS for me, except wifi, but that's because there are no drivers for it yet, but soon there will.

Everyone trying to install READ THIS: http://uphuck.ggrn.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=4145

Because it's not like oh I boot it, install it, and it's done, you have to read and try things, and be patient, you have to try what patches will work for your pc! it's different for everyone! It took me 2 weeks but now I'm a happy hackintoshah!"

,TN-048,2011-01-03T01:29Z,"Oh my god you n00bs are so freaking annoying. ""I only read the description and I tried it and it doesn't work out of the box so it must be a complete pile of crap!!"" Absolute bull!! Christ go read up on this stuff. There are article after article after article about Hackintoshing and if you read even just one it's pretty obvious that it almost NEVER works right out of the box and takes quite a bit of time. And if you take your time and do it right it's very rewarding, as I am typing this up from an iATKOS Hackintosh right now. And if I can do it (I'm 15!) all you big bad computer experts can too. Stop flaming projects like this just because you have to do some work for yourself!! +1 To the iATKOS devs because it's the best OSx86 I've ever used.  "

,PROTEOUS1,2011-06-25T16:49Z,"This and the snow leopard s3v2 work perfect .I've installed both on many computers. They work so well in fact that I got rid of my status symbol money sucking Macs'.
It seems to me that most who can't get this to burn or load are experiencing what is known as a ""PEBCAK"" error
""ProblemExistsBetweenChairAndKeyboard""
That's a computer in front of you with access to all the information use it!!!!
1. You need to know your computer specs.Download a program called EVEREST and find out Don't use the minimal horseshit specs from the manufacturers site.
2. Find out what the minimum requirements are for these iATKOS  systems are. It's usually one of the first things you see when loading if you take the time to read .If not  just type minimum requirements for iATKOS ------""whatever one your looking for"" in your search engine.
There's just too many whiney spoiled Iwant it now or I'll throw a little fit people out there nowadays. 
Asking for help is cool. Immediatly disrespecting someone that's willing to share because you're a dork is very uncool. LOOK FOR INFORMATION YOURSELF FIRST!"
