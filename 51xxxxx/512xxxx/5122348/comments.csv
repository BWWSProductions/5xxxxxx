,flyboy25177,2009-10-31T22:53Z,Does this download come with cracked keys for all three levels?
[T],VasiaZozulia,2009-11-01T08:24Z,"@flyboy25177
No. You need cracked Rosetta Stone 3.3.5 or 3.3.7"
,haybo9,2009-11-04T12:28Z,it keeps asking me for an authorization key and there is nothing in the 3.3.5 crack or in this download with it. please help.
[T],VasiaZozulia,2009-11-04T14:24Z,"@haybo9
INSTALL Rosetta Stone 3.3.5 or 3.3.7.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5052058/Rosetta_Stone_v3.3.5_for_Windows

1. Install the application by running  RosettaStoneSetup.exe or mount the .iso
2. Once installed, copy RosettaStoneVersion3.exe from the Crack folder
to the installation folder.


!!!The activation screen will still appear but just click ""Activate Later"";
you will be able to fully use any installed language packs regardless of
their activation status.
Also, make sure you don't update or register if it asks you to!!!


3. Burn or mount your language iso"
,tonyhuerta,2009-12-01T23:08Z,"Hi, i don't know how to get the crack file into the installations thing,

i have a mac and this worked just fine, and i got the 3.3.5 and everything and used it great until i got to section 3 in unit 1, then it cut me off and said i need an activation code,

i never updated and clicked activate later,

i put the file into the downloads folder but i still don't know why it won't register...

i even tried uninstalling the swedish 1,2,3 from the rosetta program, putting the file from the crack folder in the downloads folder, and then added the languages to the rosetta program again and it still didn't work.

please help?"
,067079,2009-12-27T18:50Z,"I know that in the description, it says it's meant for windows, but can it also work on mac? I went to the rosetta stone website, and the site doesn't even give you an option to choose between windows or mac because all the CDs are meant to be compatible with both operating systems... so does that mean this CD will also work on mac? "
,067079,2009-12-27T19:04Z,"*facepalm*

nevermind, I looked at the description again and saw that it is compatible with mac 10.4 and mac 10.5

I don't know how I missed that... sorry"
,virco,2010-01-11T21:02Z,"i can't seem to install this properly on my mac. 
i burned disc 1 to cd and put it in..nothing happens. i can only explore the disc. maybe i burned it the wrong way? someone please help! "
,whitetail,2010-01-11T21:39Z,Finally!  Thank you!
,kungfumanda,2010-01-14T21:58Z,"Thank you so much! This is awesome! I am just wondering though, I get level 1 and 3... what about level 2? Perhaps I have missed something??"
,shortstuffx2x,2010-01-20T02:43Z,"I have NO idea how to ""mount"" an iso file.  All I have is what I've downloaded from Utorrent.

Steps anyone?"
,tosina23,2010-01-25T12:41Z,"I could not see any exe or setup file to install. After mounting I can see only data, documentation, languages and speech folders. Can anyone help me to get through? Waiting for your response....."
,Truvbay,2010-01-29T03:00Z,"Shortstuffx2x: ""I have NO idea how to mount an iso file""

Might I suggest you google, ""mount an iso file""? Out of the 684,000 pages, you're bound to find one that helps you. 

Typical example of Boobis Americanis. Can't do a thing for himself that isn't presented in a no-brain, step-bystep way. No wonder your country is swirling the bowl. "
,chucctaylor808,2010-01-29T09:10Z,Can we have the audio companion parts to like the rest of the other languages? if possible thanks :)
,954blade,2010-04-02T11:20Z,Many thanks fo this VasiaZozulia!
,mchlcrdns,2010-05-05T04:23Z,"Just download all 3 levels. WOW, and to think I paid $200 dollars for level 1 only. Thank to who ever created this torrent. Will seed. "

Thanks this is a great download none the less"
,theusmanfromuk,2010-05-24T17:14Z,could you seed the swedish audio companion pliz ? thx
,sklein9,2010-06-17T20:52Z,"Only part of the Rosetta Stone Swedish levels 1,2 and 3 work.  It needs an activation code.  Any suggestions? Can't get the entire application to work without the code. Thanks."
,sklein9,2010-06-24T00:03Z,FINALLY GOT IT.  The key for me was copying the EXE program from the crack into the envelope and using that to start the program.  Once I follwed the directions properly I didn't need an activation code.  Thanks VZ
,geckotooth,2010-10-08T08:21Z,"Okay, i am having trouble, I downloaded this torrent. Then I downloaded Rosetta Stone 3.3.5 and installed it, but what not? i am having trouble mounting ISO files. Can someone please help me?"
,attkmast3r,2010-10-10T01:53Z,"you need an activation key to unlock all of the software, most of lesson 3 and 4 of unit 1 of level 1 are locked."
,alecjw,2010-10-23T00:46Z,Thanks for sharing. Any chance of the audio companion?
,Lord_Felacio,2010-12-14T01:03Z,Thanks for the upload. Decided to learn Swedish after reading TPB's legal threats page. Very inspiring.
,rort,2011-02-06T03:27Z,"Is anyone else having this problem? (I am running this on a MAC btw)

 I have downloaded version 3.0.35, updated to 3.2.11, used patch and everything worked fine. 

I have then mounted Swedish v3 1,2,3 using Disk Utility. It recognizes all three mounts but when I go to install them it says:

""3221
This language content requires an update of Rosetta Stone.""

Did I do something wrong or am I not able to use Swedish with this update? THANKS!!!!"
,Bliep,2011-02-06T19:27Z,"Nice of u to share this, but lesson 3 and 4 of unit 1 of level 1 are locked. Units 2,3 & 4 same thing. Anybody with a crack for this please????"

,udesla1990,2011-06-23T10:56Z,I dont mean to be rude. But is it even possible to get the audio companion for swedish?
,snailien,2011-07-13T22:35Z,"everyone keeps saying that it works wonderfully with no problems.  could anybody possibly explain how they added the language levels to rosetta stone.  i, as well as others, have burned the ISO files to disk/mounted to no avail.  if you say you can do it, then help us out.  that would be totally wicked"
,px4br,2011-09-05T23:44Z,"@geckotooth Virtual Clone Drive is a very simple daemon that is easy to use. (http://static.slysoft.com/SetupVirtualCloneDrive.exe) After installing, double-clicking the .iso should mount it. Then go into Rosetta Stone and it will find the data."

,stellarmasterelite,2011-12-07T02:54Z,sharebird how did you do it? It asks for activation code after lesson 3. Can anyone help? Where did you guys get the codes? I've searched all over the Internet. This thing is very expensive and I hope to not buying it haha.
,skugga7,2011-12-14T00:53Z,"stellarmasterelite

no need if you put the crack into the rosetta stone directory (in the local disk drive)

remember, NEVER UPDATE NEVER REGISTER"

Rosetta stone is installed and working fine, but once I mount the ISO files nothing happens...I just can open the ""CD"" but when I go into rosetta stone to add it it cannot find the cd... any tips?"
