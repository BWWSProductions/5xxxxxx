Swedish is a melodic language with rising and falling tones. The sound and length of vowels and tones help differentiate the meaning of words.
Swedish spelling is largely phonetic. Once you know the sound each letter represents, you can approach accurate pronunciation of new words with confidence.
There are two categories of Swedish nounsâ€”common and neuterâ€”that determine the form of adjectives associated with those nouns.
Word order in Swedish is predictable, and the main verb is the second component of a sentence.
Verbs in Swedish only change for differences in tense. You donâ€™t have to conjugate them for different subjects.
Swedish speakers rarely use formal speech, though they do use it in some dialects.
Learning Swedish gives you a head start if you decide to learn Danish or Norwegian. The languages are closely related and are often understood by native speakers and experienced learners.
