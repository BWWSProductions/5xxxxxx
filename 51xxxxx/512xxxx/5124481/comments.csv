[T],verifire,2009-11-12T12:13Z,"@mrdreamers4u: ""It's a ISO-image, which means it's just click on the finished download, and it'll mount and burn in what ever program you've got assigned for this. All you need is a DVDburner and a Blanc DVDR..""

ISO = Image, perfect copy of original. Reversed a program (like ""Nero"" or ""MagicISO"" and such) takes the ISO and makes a perfect copy on you DVDR. Doesn't matter if it's a Music-CD, a movie, a game.

ISO = Image of Disc. :-)"
