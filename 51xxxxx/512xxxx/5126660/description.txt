Derringer teams up with fellow axeman Kevin Russell for some nifty riffs and fancy fretwork. Styles range from the shuffling "Trouble in Paradise" to the energetic workout "Blue Suede Shoes" to the slow blues of "Sorry For Your Heartache". Blues guitar fans will have a feast, as there's no skimping on the solos here. For example, on the rolling "Blues All Night Long", the duo trade off for a solid three minutes of stellar soloing. They have some fun on the perky "Diamond", and Derringer again launches into some tasty guitarwork on the slightly funky "Crybaby". Once more, the pair stretch out for some extended solos on the sultry "Time to Go" to close things out.
