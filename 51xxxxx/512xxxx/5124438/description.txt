Denis Matsuev is an extraordinary pianist. The first thing you notice on hearing these two excellent performances is his amazing ability to play at high speed with no loss of control or shapeliness of phrasing. Consider, for example, the scherzo episode at the center of the Tchaikovsky's slow movement, or better still the finale of the Shostakovich (for my money the most exciting performance currently available). Matsuev's freshness and brilliance has the Tchaikovsky concerto sounding like new, bold and "Romantic" in the first movement's big tune but also full of elegance (second subject) and charm. The finale isn't just fast and loud, but also genuinely joyous.

As for the Shostakovich, a work that has fared very well on disc, there is no finer performance available, not even from the composer's grandson on Chandos. Kudos also to solo trumpet Igor Sharapov, who turns in a particularly memorable account of his lyrical solo during the melancholy slow movement. Of course, both here and in the Tchaikovsky, it helps greatly to have the St. Petersburg Philharmonic under Temirkanov. The accompaniments, like Matsuev's solos, manage to be idiomatic, exciting, and passionate, and above all without a trace of routine. The discipline of the string playing in the Shostakovich is phenomenal, and the winds and brass in the Tchaikovsky are crisp and clear. Top-notch sonics complete an irresistible package. A wonderful disc, plain and simple.
