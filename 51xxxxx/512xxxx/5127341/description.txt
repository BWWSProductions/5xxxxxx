Karen Allen reports from the Eastern Congo for Our World

The BBC's Southern Africa Correspondent Karen Allen reports from the conflict
zones of Eastern Congo, to trace the minerals that make it into global
electronics goods and mobile phones. Poor miners struggle to extract rare minerals needed
to fuel the never-ending boom of cell phone production while being paid about $1 per day. 


These miners are exploited and taxed by criminal gangs thinly disguised by as 'militias', themselves chased by ineffectual, government soldiers who play the same game. Amongst them are impotent, international forces whose pious purposes include protecting women and children from the predators who abound. 

Over 5 million have died in the Eastern Congo in the last 5 years. 


Meanwhile, human rights workers point out the games of international mining companies who fake the source of the materials from the illegal mining operations and wistfully hope for international action.
