Hello,

I created this DVD for me and my friends,
but I give it to you, because you are my friend ;)


It is a patched version of the Retail Snow Leopard,
With this, you can install Snow leopard on booth GUID and MBR drive!

(Install is patched to support MBR and GUID,
NO X11
NO Other languages except English and French (Sorry :/),
NO Printer drivers
NO Optional install (Xcode,...)
)


You have to burn the CD_BOOT_SNOW_LEOPARD.iso on a CD,
the MBR_INSTALL_SNOW_LEOPARS_DVD5.dmg on a DVD5.

1_ Boot on the boot CD
2_ At the selection screen swap the disc with the INSTALL_DVD
3_ Press F5 to refresh the list ( and again if the install option is not there)
4_ Launch the DVD
5_ At the selection of the Drive, press "Personalise"
6_ Remove ALL options
7_ â–ºAnd start

At the end, you will have an error about the installation of the boot loader,
but you can start your new installed Snow Leopard with the BOOT_CD

Enjoy !


Others languages can be found there:
