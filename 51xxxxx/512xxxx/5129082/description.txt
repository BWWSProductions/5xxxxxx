  +-RELEASE.iNFORMATION

      Vault 101 â€“ Jewel of the Wastes. For 200 years, Vault 101 has
      faithfully served the surviving residents of Washington DC and its
      environs, now known as the Capital Wasteland. Though the global
      atomic war of 2077 left the US all but destroyed, the residents of
      Vault 101 enjoy a life free from the constant stress of the outside
      world. Giant Insects, Raiders, Slavers, and yes, even Super Mutants
      are all no match for superior Vault-Tec engineering. Yet one
      fateful morning, you awake to find that your father has defied the
      Overseer and left the comfort and security afforded by Vault 101
      for reasons unknown. Leaving the only home you've ever known, you
      emerge from the Vault into the harsh Wasteland sun to search for
      your father, and the truth.

      This Game of the Year Edition includes the acclaimed Fallout 3 game
      as well as its five DLC packs -- The Pitt, Operation: Anchorage,
      Broken Steel, Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta.

      * Take in the sights and sounds of the vast Capital Wasteland! See
        the great monuments of the United States lying in post-apocalyptic
        ruin!

      * Vault-Tec engineers bring you the latest in human ability
        simulation - the SPECIAL Character System! Utilizing new
        breakthroughs in points-based ability representation, SPECIAL
        affords unlimited customization of your character.

      * The wizards at Vault-Tec have done it again! No longer
        constrained to just one view, experience the world from 1st or 3rd
        person perspective.

      * Feeling like a dastardly villain today, or a Good Samaritan? Pick
        a side or walk the line, as every situation can be dealt with in
        many different ways.

      * Rain death and destruction in an all-new cinematic presentation
        featuring gory dismemberments and spectacular explosions.

  +-RELEASE.NOTES

      Although this GOTY Edition comes as a 2-Disc set, Disc 1's content
      is unchanged from the original Fallout 3, so you may consider it as
      optional if you already have the original rls

      Disc 2 contains all 5 GOTY Edition DLC Packs

      Special thanks to *Q*
