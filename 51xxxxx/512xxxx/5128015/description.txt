Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones is the sixth official compilation album by The Rolling Stones and was initially released worldwide, except in North America, in 1993. The North American release came on 24 August 2004.

The first Rolling Stones compilation packaged in the Compact Disc era, Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones stretches from 1971's Sticky Fingers to then-most recent studio album Steel Wheels in 1989.

The very first release under their contract with Virgin Records in November 1993 (while Voodoo Lounge was being recorded), Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones reached #16 in the UK and became an enduring seller.Despite its very belated release in the US in 2004, it managed to peak at #30 and go platinum.

In 2009 Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones was remastered and reissued by Universal Music.
