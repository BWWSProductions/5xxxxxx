,headtoy,2009-10-15T19:36Z,really great upload:)
,psprapper,2010-01-04T04:29Z,"1920x816 isn't 1080p.
but thanks anyways, it's highres quality."
,Tomato9876,2010-03-09T03:36Z,"Don't lie buddy, this is definately 1080p. If you buy the actual disc, that's the resolution it comes in. The width matters more than the height."
,Wiltsu-boy,2010-05-11T07:47Z,"hey tomato, this ISNT 1080p= it means that its width is 1080p. This is 816p... Someone really should upload just as the movie is in the bluray.. FULL HD! Not 95% hd... "
,boxorats,2010-08-07T10:17Z,"Its width is 1080p IF you ""include"" (in your calculations) the ""letterbox bars"" that aren't part of the image -- that is, 1080p is also only 1920 wide so if the aspect ratio is relatively wide then 1080p video won't be 1080 pixels vertically since you'd be cutting off the edges of the frame. This is all you're getting on a Blu-Ray."

Although 1920x816 isn't one of the standards, it is definately the resolution this was released as.
