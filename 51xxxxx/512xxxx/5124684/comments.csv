,stexan,2011-02-09T14:27Z,Why 2 disc..?? do I need them both??
,KIWIXBOX,2011-02-17T01:20Z,"FEB 17 2011 - Hey All I have tested this and checked stealth and have successfully run it on LIVE with Ixtreme lite.... no probs so far :)

Works perfectly!! 

To answer some questions below..... you do need both discs to have all the cars and tracks available.... However .... do what I did = Grab the disc 1 and test and burn it ... you will be amazed ... then do the second disc to add all the features.

Personal favourite of the game = REWIND TO WHERE YOU STUFFED UP AND GET IT RIGHT, WITHOUT HAVING TO RESTART THE RACE.... IF ONLY GT HAD THOUGHT OF THAT. cheers!"
