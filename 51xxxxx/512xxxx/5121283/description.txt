Theese are the two first record of the great progressive band - Segies Even.
The life cycle - 1988
Steps - 1990 (this onne will really smash you)



As it was completely impossible to find a working torrent of theese recordings I've run my old good sweety eMule client and downloaded them.

I've spent three days searching the "Steps" on the net digging in this garbage of dead torrents and paid sites offering nothing but a few unfinished leechers. 
Than I've spent about thirty seconds on my eMule to find and run downloading of the both records.

I want to say here: It is your fault people! You are not seeding torrent you've anounced and you are not taking care of the garbage you leave after you.
So:
1. Keep seeding what you have anounced (make it have at least one full seed running on)
2. DELETE what you have anounced when you consider not to seed it any more. (clean after you people, clean!)
3. If there is at least one seeder, leave it and check it (if it was your announce) in a few weeks to CLEAN after you if the torrent would die. 

Otherwise you are producing garbage impossible to get through.
Take responsibility for the shit you are producing on the net.

Thank you.
Now have fun with the great progressive music of Seges Even!:)
