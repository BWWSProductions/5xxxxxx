,toxigyn,2009-12-28T07:25Z,"I bought a Logitech surround sound system, and always kept it on ""Matrix Mode"" which just pumps it out on all speakers all the time. I tried playing this movie and the music was fine, but voices were muted!

I took it off Matrix Mode and for the first time, had true surround sound at my PC!

BRiLLiANT!"

,zetto23,2010-05-09T16:14Z,"720p brrip... and you use xvid codec? fail :)
i see the blocks without trying to. next time make it mkv or make it 1,36gb. this is just nonsense"
,WatchALot,2010-05-10T20:55Z,"Good quality, thanks for your effort.

zetto ... don't download below 8Gb if you want no compression artefacts. 
But for me that's just nonsense. I either buy the BR, or I download a handy file without clogging my hard drive."
