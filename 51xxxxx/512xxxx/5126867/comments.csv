,nilloc93,2010-03-17T19:29Z,"i am sure it works but eyezin your are a moron
a basic format for NFO instructions are
#1 burn or mount
#2 install
#3 use (cd key here)
#4 copy crack over in the original directory
#5 play

what you have is the most retarded NFO i have ever seen, it does not state a CD key and your crack does not work due to the ""cannot turn left"" thing by EA"

,purpledragonfly420,2010-04-29T01:44Z,"nevermind, it's a vista problem. if you can't get it to work in vista rename the ""movies"" folder to ""_movies"" apparently vista can't play the movie scenes or something. http://www.vistaforums.com/Forum/Topic4808-16-1.aspx"

where is iso. file?can't find it plz help

==Daemon Tools Lite: disk-tools,com/download/daemon.  Then when you've got that, mount the image.  Right click Daemon when it's running --> Virtual Devices --> Device 0 (or whatever is free) --> Mount Image --> click ISO.  Click Autorun when it gets going.  When that's done, click nothing else on that.  Go back to Daemon: if you don't already have Mount N Drive already open, click that, then right click the drive where the ISO is being run from.  Click Open In File Explorer.  Now your ISO is running and you have the folder in front of you with all its content.

,Deby666,2011-11-03T23:01Z,Fuckin virus!!!!! u peace of shit!!!
,blaymoric,2011-11-23T04:00Z,I love when TPB noobs like Deby666 come around thinking their hot shit because they torrent things yet don't even know what the hell a FALSE POSITIVE is..
,nr1guido,2011-12-09T12:52Z,"i can't manage to install it, it asks for the right dvd-ROM device and i cant find it. i also used daemon tools to mount it, but it still wont work. could someone please help. im so desperate i would buy it but you cant do that either anymore."
,ilovemyanniepie_tom,2011-12-26T23:17Z,"I signed in to an account I made when I was still involved with an idiot just to say:

To all those who cannot MOUNT and INSTALL this torrent, here is a list of instructions:

Download DAEMON Tools Lite
* I rarely use this program. It's my least favorite of all the image mounting tools on the internet, but to my knowledge, it is the ONLY ONE THAT WILL WORK.

Mount the The Godfather [The Game] Image. This can be tricky depending on which version of DAEMON Tools you have, but if you're on TPB without knowing how to do this then you're going to die soon anyway.

Right flick the .INFO file and open it with NOTEPAD. The serial number is at the top.
* This throws people off sometimes. The .INFO file, when double clicked, often doesn't work properly. 

I haven't finished installing, so I have no idea if the game will actually work properly, but I thought I would post this for all those stoners wanting to pirate this game to relive their childhood, like myself.

Good luck."
,ilovemyanniepie_tom,2011-12-26T23:19Z,"Also,

Don't forget to copy and paste your crack!"
,ilovemyanniepie_tom,2011-12-26T23:24Z,"Okay, Windows 7 64bit OS users, here's even more shit you have to do to make this work!

Follow previous steps to install.

After pasting the crack into... 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Godfather The Game

Right click your new .exe, the crack, and click ""Properties."" Click ""Compatibility"" and select Windows XP SP 2 and Run as an Administrator. The opening splash screen won't work, but the game itself will.

Enjoy your nostalgia!"

,bilal.m95,2012-05-30T09:36Z,99.5% i hope it works!!!
,rallybanner,2012-06-15T08:03Z,For all those having the DirectX error on windows 7 x64... After spending all night scouring the internet I FINALLY found a fix. Here it goes: Mount the ISO and copy all its contents into a folder on your desktop; When it's done copying go into the 'Autorun' folder and find the autorun.cfg; open it up and find the line that says 'DirectXVersion=9.0c' and change the 9.0c to 0; then run it in compatability for win 2000... That's what fixed it for me. Hope this helps.

,Zapfinger,2012-06-16T21:47Z,"help it just won't start up.. i did everything ilovemyanniepie_tome said but all i get is the loading symbol next to my curser for about 5 seconds and then nothing happens and i have to kill the process via task manager.. i have windows 7 home premium 64bit and i renamed the movies folder to _movies, put the compatibility mode to windows xp sp2 and started it as administrator so wtf is going on here?!"
