,Flazhp0intX,2009-10-15T16:30Z,"Seriously, this is one of the best mafia games in history. It's even better than The Godfather II.

As expected, I can't wait for the release of Mafia II, which will be in 2010 I guess.

Anyway, I played this game so much, because it's so fantastic and it has very good playable controls.

To anyone who downloads this, ENJOY IT!

And for the uploader: thanks for taking your time to share it with us. I appreciate it."
,Insomneac,2009-10-18T02:31Z,"This is one of the best games ever made.

Although I haven't played it in a while, when I did, I couldn't put it down.

Any suggestions.....Oou and when i click cancel two windows starts blinking one with text that cd is corrupted and other when i click cancel says taht installation is not complete.....?????? "
,Radosity,2009-11-16T18:33Z,"For those with problems launching the game:

In the original download folder is a file called game.exe. You need to copy this to the folder mafia was installed into, replacing the game.exe there. After this, mount Mafia CD 1 and run MafiaLauncher, this will set your graphics and such. After that your game will run.

Now, I'm having a problem myself. The game's graphics are glitchy as hell for me. People's hands are even disappearing in cutscenes along with randomly appearing/disappearing objects. I turned my video down to the lowest setting possible, no joy. I'm running Windows 7. Any solutions?"

Still problem post."
,Mqas,2010-01-03T00:03Z,"PirateLucas445
Try to look in mafia CD 2.
Mount Mafia CD 2 then go to my computer open your virtual CD drive it should have mafia CD 2 name.
-Then go to mafia game folder copy Game.exe to where you have installed the game.
""Short answer find Game.exe and copy to installation folder.I hope it works for you.
Still problem post. 
"
,Mqas,2010-01-03T12:29Z,"PirateLucas445 
I am Pretty good at this things.
When ever you installed a copy game it will give you the error of no disc inserted it 's a CD protection.
To bypass you need a crack.Now crack is a file which bypass copy protection it has the same name of the file from where you run the game.
I am just explaining you so you understand.
Now solution
1-Go to Gamecopyworld.com
2-Type Mafia 
3-Choose the first one ""Mafia City of lost heaven""
4-There are many Mafia no CD fixes.
5-Choose mafia English 1.0 fixed exe
6-If this one does not work try other.
I don't have this particular torrent.So i am not sure where is the crack.
I hope this helps if you still have problem 
Post. 
You need lot of help try to contact me some other way me be give me your id so i try to help you in detail and also explain you i gotta go now my friend calling bye."

i have win7 maybe is that a problem..."
,Mqas,2010-01-03T18:58Z,"PirateLucas445 
Alright the crack is is original downloading folder.
1-So open the original downloading folder.
2-Copy game.exe to installation folder.
3-There are total 6 files in original downloading folder.
4-No need to do anything just open original downloading folder and there you find Game.exe
I am sure this will help you."

Then in the setup properties, instead of auto detect, choose the resolution your screen is set at, mine was 1440x900, then change the refresh rate from default to whatever your screens refresh rate is. Mine was 60 htz. See the error is a generic error which means it cannot detect your hardware configurations so you have to choose them manually. Those two changes are all that is necessary.

I'm using windows 7 ultimate x86, im not sure if it's OS compatibility but the game runs fun it's just that it is annoying to play with those graphical damage. thanks anyway uploader."

What worked for me and you can try: open setup in mafia folder. select triple buffering, vertical synchronizing, and truecolor. then open up expert settings and click on multipass rendering and clip always. save the new settings and then run mafia.(NOTE)you must run Mafia(the game) as administrator, as that seems to make the graphics probs disappear. also if it doesnt work, try it in compatibility mode for vista with no service packs. im runnin windows 7."

,KINGmatan,2011-04-29T16:30Z,"FOR THOSE WHO CLICK THE GAME AND NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!

It usually happens on windows 7. The problem is that before you run the game, the graphics setups application should run, but for some reasons it won't work on windows 7. To make it work, right click on the game shortcut (or simply the executable) and click Properties. Then go to ""Compatibility"" tab, check the ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" and then choose ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)"" from the list. Now click apply, then ok and run the game again. It should work now :) Tested it myself on windows 7 pro 32 bit."

,tumezt,2011-07-25T12:53Z,"Hi guys!
The installation went fine, but everytime I try to launch the game it says ""the version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you're running"". I'm running win7 64-bit.
I've tried already to fix the problem with these methods:
1) Changing the compatibility to servicepack 2
2) Running as administrator
3) Re-installin
4) Troubleshooting in Control Panel (always in vain, I know)
I searched the web and got no results. Is there anyway to fix my problem or should I just give it up?
"
,tumezt,2011-07-25T13:29Z,"I forgot to mention, Windows XP Mode doesn't work with my system. I'm afraid I'm running out of options.."
,tumezt,2011-07-25T19:54Z,"Jesus christ! It works!
For those who are running a 64-bit: the crack in the original folder is for a 32-bit. Download a different crack and it should be fine.
Many thanks anyways"

can anybody help plz!!!"
,paul939,2011-08-14T22:22Z,"SOLUTION TO CANADIAN WHISKY LEVEL CRASHING:

Here is the solution, which I found on gamespot from a user called SteveCrook:

""I managed to fix it. It seems to have been some sort of corruption in the save file. I went back to the start of the ""A trip to the country"" mission, where you get your first instructions, and then it was all OK when I ran it straight through from there. The problem was when I picked up the save file that started just as you leave Salieri's.""

Hope this clears up that problem for all you people."

1. Open setup

3.  Change refresh rate from default to whatever your screen refresh rate is

This worked for me. Once. Then it happened again and when I tried to change resolution and refresh rate, I couldn't, it's all blank (screenshot here: http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/7320/mafiasetup.jpg)
