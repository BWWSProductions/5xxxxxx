Der Lauf Der Dinge (aka The Way Things Go) (Fischli & Weiss, 1987)-aNaRCHo


Inside a warehouse, artists Peter Fischli & David Weiss build an enormous, precarious structure 100 feet long made out of common household items - tea kettles, tires, old shoes, balloons, wooden ramps, etc. Then, with fire, water, gravity, and chemistry, they create a spectacular chain reaction, a self-destructing performance of physical interactions, chemical interactions, and precisely crafted chaos worthy of Rube Goldberg or Alfred Hitchcock. 

Called "the merry pranksters of contemporary art"(NY Times), Peter Fischli & David Weiss have collaborated since 1979. The Swiss artists, whose works are exhibited in galleries and musems all over the world, take on big questions with humble materials and a tongue-in-cheek manner.
