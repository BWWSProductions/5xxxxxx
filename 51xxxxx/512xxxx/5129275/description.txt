Plot: When a minor hurricane strikes just off the coast of Florida, meteorologist Leah Kaplan (Daryl Hannah) and her team fly into the storm to observe the effects. But what seems like a routine mission is anything but when the hurricane grows into a churning tempest. Now itâ€™s a race against time for the crew â€” and a conservative-leaning reporter (Dylan Neal) on board â€” to get the aircraft back on land and warn everyone about the storm.
