Be sure to read the commentary text file.

This movie's not too well thought of.

It is beautiful to look at.

The subtitles in English are horrible.

(I scrounged up the subtitles from somewhere.
Usually I am known to be a writer of subtitles myself.)

Overall the story is almost impossible to understand.

But--my Japanese wife immediately recognized the names 

of the warlords involved from her studies in school.

She enjoys this movie much more than I do.




I have just today been able to get back into Pirate Bay.

They still make it difficult to upload.
