A new comedy from the creative genius of Judd Apatow ("40 Year Old Virgin", "Knocked Up", "Talladega Nights") follows a pair of druggie losers as they reach the top of the hit-list when one witnesses a mob murder and drags his buddy into a crazy flight from mobsters bent on silencing both of them permanently. The film stars new sensation Seth Rogen ("Knocked Up", "Superbad", "40 Year Old Virgin") and James Franco ("Spider-Man 1-3") and it co-stars Rosie Perez ("Do The Right Thing") and Gary Cole ("The Brady Bunch Movie").
