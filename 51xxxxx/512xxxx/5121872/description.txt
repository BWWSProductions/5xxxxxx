Sanderling is less well-known in the US than others - Abbado, Karajan,
Bernstein, and many others. But no one has produced a more
consistently excellent set of Brahms symphonies than this....

Brahms is my favorite composer, so I've heard lots of recordings of all four
of these symphonies. In my opinion, Sanderling's Third and Fourth are
better than any other recordings I have heard - and that includes
Szell, Walter, Abbado, and Kleiber's Fourth - all highly praised. The
Second, although it lacks the excitement and vigor of Kertesz or the
currently unavailable Steinberg, is as loving and beautiful as anyone
could make it. Only in the First Symphony do I find Sanderling
uncompetitive with the very best. His performance there just seems a
bit rough and scrappy for my taste. The sound is as good as you could
ask for. This set is one of the least known true jewels of the entire
catalogue. If you love Brahms, then you MUST have it!
