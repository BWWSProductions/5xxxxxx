Dead Space is a 2008 comic book prequel to the movie Dead Space: Downfall. The video game Dead Space continues where the movie left the viewer. The series was published by Image Comics and is written by Antony Johnston (who also wrote the game's dialogue), with art by Ben Templesmith.

In the distant future, humanity has colonized worlds beyond Earth's solar system. Two-hundred years prior, a man named Michael Altman discovered an artifact of unknown origin (known as "the marker") which led him to begin a new religion - Unitology - that supposedly taught the truth about human existence. Altman was later killed, allegedly by the government, in an attempt to silence the truth - however, the veracity of this account has yet to be confirmed. In present time, a new marker has been discovered on another colony and strange things have been happening amongst the colonists. The comics start off with Sergeant Abraham Neumann - A devoted P-SEC (Planetside Security, the local colony law enforcement) making a video log about what happens in the comic.   The comic occasionally drifts away from Neumann's point of view and features events that Neumann is not present at.
