I love 24, but have grown tired of the annoying parts, like Jack's daughter Kim, his wife Teri, David Palmer's family controversies, and lots of other pointless scenes. 

So I removed all the crap, and made the first season into a trilogy of movies.

To make this work I re-ordered scenes to make more sense and have more impact, cut everything that got in the way of a good story or slowed down the pacing too much, carefully transitioned the video and audio of every scene, removed the commercial breaks, and removed the credits.

Cuts Removed/Added:

    * â€¢ Cut all scenes with David Palmer and his family going through a family crisis.
    * â€¢ Cut all scenes of Kim Bauer sneaking out and getting kidnapped. We only know what little that Jack and his wife Teri are able to piece together while looking for her.
    * â€¢ Cut nearly all scenes of Teri Bauer looking for Kim, now we just get periodic updates when she talks on the phone with Jack.
    * â€¢ Cut all scenes from the perspective of the bad guys, now we find things out along with Jack and the team at CTU.
    * â€¢ Cut some of the office bickering and annoyances with Tony, Nina, Jamie, and Mason.
    * â€¢ Numerous small cuts to remove annoyances, improve pacing, and make things more consistent.


What I present to you is a three part series of everything that makes 24 great, minus over 8 hours of cut scenes that I assure you won't be missed, and actually were kind of awful.

This first movie is created from episodes 1 - 8, and is 2 hours and 15 minutes long (201 minutes cut).
