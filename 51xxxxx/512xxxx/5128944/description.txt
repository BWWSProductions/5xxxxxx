Yes thats right, i thought id do 25fps releases, thought id give it a go.



ok the hardest part of this release has been the audio, simply becuase the voices were hardly hearable

and in several areas of the audio both channels were messed up . so ive spent the last week or so using a new

software all thanks to the starting help of Sonic. so now you hear ALL the voices and background.

only issue with this audio being so wrong in the original was that some areas the soudn can become disorted at high end scenes

but only lasts for a few seconds each time.

ive increased the audio 7db, and to gain the voices i had to go through the left and right channel and inverse parts of the audio.

ive also fixed the syn a bit but there are still some minor areas where its out.



video

well took me a few days but it was worth it, seperated all dark, light areas aswell as areas that needed that extra colour etc

so now you have colour, gamma, contour
