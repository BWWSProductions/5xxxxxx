,1nTh3fAc3,2011-01-31T00:26Z,"got the solution to the whole, ""No-Cd crack isn't working"" thing. get pissed. plain and simple. I got mad and clicked the damn thing six or seven times, manically pressing A, and guess what? after it was all done, the game ran perfectly. your all welcome. :D "
,Moby_duck,2011-08-07T01:42Z,"I found a crack that works: http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=1020
There's a little rar file there. Just extract it and copy the file it creates into your installation directory (C:\Program Files\Tropico is the default) and click ""Copy and replace"", and then start the game. You're welcome =)"
