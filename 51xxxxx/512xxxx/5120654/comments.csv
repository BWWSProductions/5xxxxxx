I have 4 or 5 of your previous requests but my DVD drive on my computer broke a few days ago so I can't get them on my computer. The videos I'm uploading now were on my hard drive before my DVD drive stopped working.  If I get the problem fixed I'll start uploading your requests. Also you have to wait for more seeders to show up to get the older videos. "
