,elric13,2009-10-20T03:49Z,"THINK that it's Moon, with Sam Rockwell. Looks like it's called Luna 2112 at least in Moscow, dug this up from Moscow Times online:
Moon (Luna 2112, 2009): Duncan Jones? psychological sci-fi story focuses on a lonely astronaut (Sam Rockwell) on the moon and his friendly robot (voice of Kevin Spacey).
Pyat Zvyozd-Novokuznetskaya Thurs. to Wed. at 11:15 a.m. and 9:10 p.m. In English; Russian subtitles.

Hopefully one of the 28 seeders can confirm this.  :)"

Someone said that its Moon(released on 2009):
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/plotsummary

But I don't recall that movie ever mentioning that movie ever mentioning the year 2112. I could be wrong.

Maybe someone can download and verify that it is the Moon Sam Rockwell movie or not."
