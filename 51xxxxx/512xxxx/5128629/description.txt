Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D offers four expansive "movie campaigns" that challenge you and your fellow survivors to battle thousands of swarming zombies as you travel across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests. In addition to the movie campaigns, Left 4 Dead features a Versus mode that allows you to play as the Boss Zombies.


                         IT'S THE ZOMBIE ACOPALYPSE, BRING FRIENDS


	New technology dubbed "the AI Director" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, adjusting pacing, special effects and audio on the fly.

INFO:
	I did not make the wrapper, I got it from BPirates torrent. What I did was update it to the latest version and installed all of the no steam stuff. It comes pre-installed with some really popular campaigns and maps. I have also included an easy step by step guide to installing new maps and joining multiplayer games.

If you are unable to see the characters or the zombies you have to turn down paged pool memory to low, this is a common.
