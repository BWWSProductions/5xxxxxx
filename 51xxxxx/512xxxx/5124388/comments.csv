,xitroen,2009-10-21T13:45Z,what is it for ? Why not any simple explanation of the software ?
,HelloDolly1,2009-10-23T21:11Z,"to xitroen:

It's the software for the Elgato tv-tuner hardware for Mac.

If you don't have the hardware, it's pretty useless. So anyone who have it, knows what it is."

I try to avoid having to install Little Snitch, so help with blocking EyeTV from ""calling home"" via the HOSTS file would be greatly appreciated!"
,longtea,2009-10-27T15:55Z,"doesnt work, after typing the sn,cant click the 'next' button"
,longtea,2009-10-27T19:25Z,"now it'ok, since i reinstall 3.2.0, bevor i installed 3.2.1 and the sn is just for 3.2.0"
