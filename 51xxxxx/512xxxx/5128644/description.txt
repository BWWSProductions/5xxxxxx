Sam Cohen -- Confessions -- F**k You! Mr President: The Father of the Neutron Bomb Speaks Out, PDF format, 1.1 MB

EDIT: This is the 3rd Edition, released in 2006


This is a book by the inventor of the neutron bomb. The man who nearly single-handedly figured out how to build the N-bomb. The smartest man ever? Very possibly!

He was so brutally honest in this book that he couldn't find a publisher for it and released the text online. It's perfectly legal to download this!

A must-read for anyone interested in nuclear weaponry, general defence policies or just in learning more about the inner workings of the mind of a driven genius. Warning -- it's not a feel-good read. Mr. Cohen does not believe in pulling his punches..
