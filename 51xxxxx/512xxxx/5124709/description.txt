Rod Stewart / Every Picture Tells A Story [MFSL UDCD532]

Rod Stewart was at his best between the years 1969 to 1975, when he was cultivating his solo career while still a member of The Faces, and before the tawdry posturing of his "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" disco years. When he was at his best, Stewart released The Rod Stewart Album in 1969, (featuring "Handbags and Gladrags"); Gasoline Alley in 1970 (featuring the Rod Stewart-Ronnie Wood song "Gasoline Alley"); Every Picture Tells a Story in 1971 (featuring the classic singles "Maggie May," "(I Know) I'm Losing You," and the Tim Hardin song "Reason To Believe"); and Never a Dull Moment in 1972 (featuring Sam Cooke's "Twisting the Night Away," "You Wear It Well," and "Lost Paraguayos"). All of these classic Rod songs define the true artistic genius of Rod Stewart before he sold his soul to disco, prompting Rolling Stone magazine to observe: "Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely."

With all five members of The Faces appearing on the album, Every Picture Tells a Story is the definitive Rod Stewart album. Stewart wrote several hit singles for the album: the coming-of-age classic that launched his solo career, "Maggie May;" "Every Picture Tells a Story" (co-written with Ronnie Wood); and the mandolin-driven "Mandolin Wind." The other songs on the album stand up well against Stewart's songs, including the hard-edged rocker, "(I Know) I'm Losing You," and a Dylan cover, "Tomorrow is a Long Time." Complete album tracks include:

1. Every Picture Tells A Story 5:59
2. Seems Like A Long Time 4:02
3. That's All Right 6:00
4. Tomorrow Is A Long Time 3:48
5. Maggie May 5:50
6. Mandolin Wind 5:36
7. (I Know) I'm Losing You 5:23
8. (Find A) Reason To Believe 4:10
