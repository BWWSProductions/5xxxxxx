The asshole who ripped this ran some sort of filter TO REMOVE VOICE WAVELENGTHS--I guess so it doesn't interfere with those foreign subtitles. You can *just barely* hear the actors' voices throughout, i.e. total unwatchable CRAP. My God, even if you're foreign and need subs, you want to hear the actors, don't you..? 

WTF????????????!"
