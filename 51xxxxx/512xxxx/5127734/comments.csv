,sammaful,2009-10-19T19:03Z,is this still wave 3?
,ServerModerator,2009-10-20T04:09Z,"Yes, it's still wave 3."
,glennc1,2009-10-21T13:42Z,"Come on guys this is borderlands! its the best game ever for ages people have been waiting ages for a game like this don't torrent it. Honestly is it hard to spend a 100 dollars or to just wait until it cheaper. Games are suffering so much. 

I would never say a comment like this ( mainly cause i have downloaded like 40 games this year alone) but this game is one of a kind and if people torrent it there's less chance of a sequel."
,fleischi93,2009-10-21T16:00Z,"@glennc1: If you say something like that, go and say to all the people they shouldn't download Fallout 3 or Modern Warfare 2 (when it's out) because those 2 are the BEST games EVER!"
,Chabs232,2009-10-21T16:11Z,"glennc1 )> 100 dollars ?!

,smokie_nacone,2009-10-21T19:01Z,thanks gamerguy much appreciated glennc1 does  have a point but if the prices of games dropped they wud shift more of em and things wud be better im gunna b a jackass an download this anyway but its definably food for thought.

,aslilpingo,2009-10-24T07:56Z,"You'd have to be a fucking idiot to pay 100dollar if you can download it for free.

,chewythedog,2009-11-01T17:31Z,"You really pay a $100 for your games?  I am guessing that means you can't get loads and loads of games then which means even if they made a sequel to this you probably wouldn't be able to afford it.  You should be downloading and saving your cash, the last game to come out that was worth paying for was......"

,abbadonsminion,2009-12-08T00:13Z,"Yeah, my xbox is also banned, and I'm quite pissed that im going to miss out on expansions, I would even be willing to buy the expansion, but, after looking around, I couldnt find anywhere that sells it other than xbox live marketplace. "
,iamiam,2009-12-18T19:24Z,"OK the game works fine, but how to get  the DLC. Is there any way to download them on your pc and then transfer to the xbox360 hard drive? "

,acid6x,2010-01-07T09:44Z,"@Pwny
lmao. 

@2Killa2
Do some google homework like everyone else did. You can either mod it yourself or go on craigs list or something to find someone to do it for you (some will even mod it right in front of you)
Then get a dual-layer dvd burner, dual-layer dvds, and IMGBurn (free program) to burn the games...
And once again... DO YOUR GOOGLE HOMEWORK. GOOGLE KNOWS ALL"
,muffinl,2010-02-04T15:12Z,"Ok, I'm a little new to burning xbox360 games. I think I understand everything involved but I'm having a hard time identifying which torrents I want. Is this a so-called ""xtreme"" rip? Patched or unpatched? How would I tell without asking? Thanks."
,GigaBoii,2011-01-01T19:32Z,"Ive been wondering if some of the videos on Youtube are BOGUS, cuz they r saying you have to sauder some crazy shit on the board. I had someone do mine, looked at the board, and it wasnt even saudered. "
