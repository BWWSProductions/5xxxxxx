,Novi,2009-10-23T05:10Z,"So I used another crack first, and it now says unactivated (frankenbuild). I have a backup of token.dat. How do I repair it?"
,DeQuess,2009-10-25T05:53Z,"Work great, thank's a lot"
,xtremeshredder1,2009-11-01T22:05Z,"A few questions. Your program says that it detected a modified tokens.dat, when i press yes to a continue, it says an error has been recorded in your system event log. i really do not want to reinstall windows. i also want to mention that i have had trouble with past programs, such as Win7 Loader 1.8, it will say its activated, and when i reboot, it isn't. now since i used Loader1.6, ive been getting an error saying that i am a victim of counterfeit software. what should i do?

1. What can i do to fix this without reinstalling windows.

2. if i purchased the activation from microsoft, would this fix everything?

Thank you,
xtremeshredder "

,Klug_Kopf,2009-12-12T07:12Z,"I keep getting the message that there is malware within this download ""malware.gen""  I blocked the infected parts, but it did not activate windows."
,lerchos2,2009-12-16T16:47Z,"A little bit of help for you who dont get it to work.

Most likely, you have a bad copy of the OS. Make usre that you install a proper release of the OS, to fend off update issues. These loaders are very good, but tend to fail to operate on certain systems with very old (eg the first pirated releases) copies of Windows 7. I can recommend you to find a OEM version which is recently created (3-4 WEEKS) and use the loader on that. However you need to do a reformat before, so make sure you dont forget that. Old files and crap lying on the harddrive is the main reason for 99 % of all issues when it comes to the OS...stay safe. 

And dont run your updates unsupervised, make sure you dont install microsofts defender, antivirus etc. Only updates related to minor things. A hint is to look for stuff that says ""will help you.."" ""stay safe2 and so on..thats usually the stuff with the piracy check..."
,jigsaw16,2010-01-13T13:53Z,"Works perfectly :D
This is how i did it:
1.  Downloaded this OS: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5129465/Windows_7_Ultimate_AIO_Activated
2.  Burned the ISO file onto a dvd, using image burn. (http://imgburn.com/)
3.  Restarted the computer and booted from the dvd.
4.  Installed the OS
5.  Installed this torrent
6.  The computer restarted and the os was activated :D

One question though; can i install windows updates after i have instaled this?"
,YungSage,2010-02-09T08:07Z,"I am not sure if this question has been asked before but can this loader work for any windows 7 edition (starter, home, professional and ultimate)? As well bit versions (x86 or x64)?"
,robind13,2010-02-17T14:16Z,"Works perfect man,
