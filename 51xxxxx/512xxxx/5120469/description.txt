6 Breaking Benjamin Albums, Including Rares.


[2002] Saturate
[2004] So Cold EP
[2004] We Are Not Alone
[2006] Phobia
[2009] Dear Agony
There are two more EP's [Live EP, and Breaking Benjamin EP] But I didn't include those, because all of the songs on them are on other CD's.. So I didn't bother.

I put all the rare songs into a folder called "Rares"
I didn't really know what else I should put as the album.

All the songs in the rares album are covers that Breaking Benjamin played from other bands.

These are the rares I have:
*Aenima [Tool Cover]
*All Apologies [Nirvana Cover]
*Awake [Godsmack Cover]
*Bored [Deftones Cover]
*Bulls On Parade [Rage Against The Machine Cover]
*Enjoy The Silence [Depeche Mode Cover]
*Greed [Godsmack Cover]
*Home (Acoustic) [Origional Song]
*Hurt [Nine Inch Nails Cover]
*Inertia [Inertia is said to be an origional song]
*Judith [A Perfect Circle Cover]
*Phase (Acoustic) [Origional Song]
*Sober [Tool Cover]
*Stinkfist [Tool Cover]
*Undertow [Tool Cover]
* I also put the song "Broken Soul", which is an origional song by Breaking Benjamin, in the rares file, even though it isn't a rare, but it apparently doesn't have an album. So I put it in there for organizations sake.
