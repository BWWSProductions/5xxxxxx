,rippervanwinkle,2009-10-20T13:40Z,"Great album, thanks.  I only had this in mp3 before so a lossless release is very welcome. 

The Oumou Sangare track Ah Ndiya is a very different version from on her Moussolo album, a real treat.  It's great to hear Toumani Diabate jam on this album as well...a complement to the live recording at Telluride. 

BBC Radio's World Routes is doing some programmes on Appalachian music at the moment so they discuss quite a lot on the West African origin of the Banjo and other instruments (and also the actual music).  Well worth a listen.  If Demonoid ever reappears pm me if you're interested in hearing it. "
