,ntguru5,2009-10-14T08:57Z,"pioneer,
basically you need to add that url as a tracker in whatever client you're using. For example in uTorrent I just right-clicked in the tracker detail field and selected ""Add Tracker"" and entered that url. That should start your DL. Get rid of the ones that aren't working"
