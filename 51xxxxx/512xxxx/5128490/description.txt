"Real Much" : Isonâ€™s 1st full-length effort under his own signature, is a hodge-podge of music,found / manipulated sound, guitar, poetry, blips, and errors all deformed or reformed, and forced to fit into â€œSong Containersâ€.

"Real Much" is a catchy psycho-lovely-rhythmic electronic/organic hybrid of the pretty and the ugly, and, oh, so very Real. 

"Most crafters of soundscapes are chained to a style or school, and most art poet dudes make one-listen CDs.
But Ison is a rare sound/word genius who is weird and interesting enough to make you listen again and again"

"Jack Ison: A master builder of sonic atmospheres and a creator who takes the time to really understand where his technological capabilities are, yet is intuitive and never allows the technology to drive his creative instincts. The moment is always present in Jack's work -- you feel you are going on a journey and no aspect of it predictable. Climactic points have majestic sweep and some aspect of the magical; like taking a jet airliner through someone else's imagination." ~ Uncle Dave Lewis
