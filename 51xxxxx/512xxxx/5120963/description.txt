"When kings collide, the galaxy will tremble!"

Following the Annihilation Saga and Secret Invasion comes War of Kings.  Black Bolt, leader of the Inhumans, and the new leader of the Kree Empire must face the Shiâ€™ar Empire who are now ruled by Vulcan (Gabriel Summers) as he attempts to seize control of neighbouring planets in an effort to to expand his powerbase.  This conquest could not go unchecked!  With the X-Men, Starjammers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Nova and Darkhawk drawn into this conflict, Marvelâ€™s cosmic universe will never be the same!

War of Kings leads into the next cosmic crossover event Realm of Kings, which can be found via the link below:
