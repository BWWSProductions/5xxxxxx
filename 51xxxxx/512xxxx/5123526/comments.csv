I was going to replace my MP3 files, but they were noticeably and significantly clearer and better than this album.
Just for your info, Is it a budget label CD?"
[V],Kitlope,2009-10-15T22:54Z,"Yep. I picked it up at a second hand store and its an old CD by the looks of it. It was probably butchered when transferred to CD. 

Sorry 'bout that, I guess they all can't be winners"
