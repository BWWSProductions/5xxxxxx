Description:
An Englishman's continuing search through space and time for a decent cup 
of tea . . . 

Arthur Dent's accidental association with that wholly remarkable book, The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, has not been entirely without incident. 
Arthur has traveled the length, breadth, and depth of known, and unknown, 
space. He has stumbled forward and backward through time. He has been 
blown up, reassembled, cruelly imprisoned, horribly released, and 
colorfully insulted more than is strictly necessary. And of course Arthur 
Dent has comprehensively failed to grasp the meaning of life, the 
universe, and everything. 

Arthur has finally made it home to Earth, but that does not mean he has 
escaped his fate. 

Arthur's chances of getting his hands on a decent cuppa have evaporated 
rapidly, along with all the world's oceans. For no sooner has he touched 
down on the planet Earth than he finds out that it is about to be blown 
up . . . again. 

And Another Thing . . . is the rather unexpected, but very welcome, sixth 
installment of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. It features a 
pantheon of unemployed gods, everyone's favorite renegade Galactic 
President, a lovestruck green alien, an irritating computer, and at least
one very large slab of cheese.
