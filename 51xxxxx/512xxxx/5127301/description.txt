DJ Benzi & Lil Jon are back at it again with the followup to last years smash, â€œMotivation 2â€, with the The US Open Amplitude Mixtape! This project came about after Benzi was hired to DJ the VIP After Party for the 2009 US Open of Snowboarding in Burlington, Vermont. The idea to create a new mix in conjunction with the party was thrown around and Benzi was soon hard at work on this masterpiece with the help of his homie Lil Jon on hosting duties. The mixtape features 18 new and exclusive club tracks and remixes from The Cool Kids, Diplo, Donnis, Kanye West, and many more! Check out the full tracklisting and grab the mixtape from the direct link below! If you want to book Benzi for your next corporate event, VIP party, club event, or sweet sixteen, hollar at Peter Oasis at [e-mail]!
