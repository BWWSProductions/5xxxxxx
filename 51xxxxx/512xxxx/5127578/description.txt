"Wild at Heart" is the title of a song recorded by American country group Gloriana. In early 2009, the song was released as the group's debut single, and was available as a digital download on May 8, 2009. It served as the lead-off single to Gloriana's self-titled debut album that was released August 4, 2009.

Roughstock critic Matt Bjorke spoke positively of the song. He compared Gloriana to Little Big Town, another country group with four part harmonies and said, "Itâ€™s easy to like songs like this, even if the lyrics donâ€™t really say too much in the way of insightful messages, we all need and like to hear feel-good songs every once in a while."

The song became the best-selling country music debut single in 2009.

"Wild at Heart" debuted at #54 on the Hot Country Songs chart in February 2009. It reached #16 on the chart dated for July 25, 2009 and fell from the chart the next week, but re-entered at #16 on the week of August 8, it climbed one spot to #15 over the next week, then fell off.

Gloriana is an American country music group founded in 2008.

Before the band's foundation, Kimball was the 2002 winner of the competition America's Most Talented Kid and a solo artist on Epic Records. Gloriana released its debut single "Wild at Heart" in February 2009, which has become a Top 20 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.
