After being accused of crimes he did not commit, a

lonely circus performer exacts his revenge on those who

unjustly condemned him. The act sparks something inside

of him which he cannot stop and now, years later, his

inner-demons have truly surfaced. Part urban legend

part tabloid sensationalism... he is now an unstoppable

murderous juggernaut, fueled only by hate
