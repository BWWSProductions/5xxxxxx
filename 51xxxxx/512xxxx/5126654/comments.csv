,cackhand,2009-11-27T20:42Z,"HI. When i press ""inject code"". it says ""can not access file"" even though i dont have archicad running yet. why is this ?"
,Andreas7506,2009-12-09T13:09Z,"AVG warns me for a trojan in the file Archicad.13_crk.exe file, anyone else seen this?"
,melbourneminh,2010-01-14T02:09Z,"Omerta-U. Firstly, thanks for the upload.

But i've got the same problem as Andreas7506. Bitdefender has picked up the crack file as a virus. Is this a problem? Is it actually a virus or are cracks generally classed as viruses by anti-virus programs regardless?"

,cousland,2010-03-04T11:02Z,"when I run the crack it says I don't have permission to run the file,I even tried as administrator but it says the same thing....also,avast picks it up as a virus.

help anyone?"
,looger69,2010-03-25T04:42Z,"I was having problems at first too, it said I couldn't copy the file cuz it was a ""read only"" and wouldn't run even as admin, but then I shutdown vipre and ran as administrator and it worked flawlessly.  Thanks Omerta-U.  If you're having problems shutdown all your virus software and run as admin........good virus software sees cracks as trojans. This is clean."

But now running the Archicad.13_Crk.exe that I've put in directory of the program, gives me this message:
Can not access the file.
Maybe it's in use...
Please close the file before patching!
Try to access the file again now?
