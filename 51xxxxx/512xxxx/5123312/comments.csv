,bamias,2009-11-12T22:03Z,"I am thoroughly convinced that ""Alexander the Great's"" mother tongue was a version of Bulgarian. He certainly used the Cyrillic alphabet.
To prove that I am right I need only point out to the fact that no history professors from eg. England, Germany, France, Italy or Spain ever said otherwise, ever took tha part of those silly Greeks. As a matter of fact the Greek themselves have proved quite submissive and their protestations are but verbal. In reality they invest fortunes in ""??????????"", they visit as tourists, they buy drugs made there.
Of course, one could say that, as christians, they love their enemy.

One thing deserves some thought, apart from the question the Bulgarians living in Northen Macedonia and claiming to be the historical and biological heirs of ancient Macedonians and Alexander:
Are present day Greeks really the heirs of the ancient Hellenes? Linguistically, the answer is affirmative. But their songs and national clothing are clearly Albanian and Slavic...
Perhaps the population in both Greece and FYROM (to be on the legal side) are one and the same: A mixture of Albanians and Slavs who simply claim to be the descendants of Macedonians and Greeks, so as to feel they have an impressive national identity..."
