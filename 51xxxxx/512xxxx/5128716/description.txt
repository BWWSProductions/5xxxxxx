From Wiki:



Pet Shop Boys are an English electronic dance music duo, consisting of Neil Tennant, who provides main vocals, keyboards and occasionally guitar and Chris Lowe on keyboards and occasionally on vocals.

Pet Shop Boys have sold about 100 million records worldwide.[1]. Since 1986, they have had 42 Top 30 singles and 22 Top 10 hits in the UK, including four Number Ones: "West End Girls," "It's a Sin," "Always on My Mind," and "Heart."

At the 2009 BRIT Awards, Pet Shop Boys received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The duo's latest album, entitled Yes, was released on 23 March 2009.





The Complete Singles Collection 1991


Discography: The Complete Singles Collection is an 18 track compilation by the UK electronic music group Pet Shop Boys. It was first released in 1991. The album charted at No 3 in the UK album charts.

As the name suggests, Discography is a collection of all of the hit singles by Pet Shop Boys up to that point (1991), alongside two new tracks "DJ Culture" and "Was It Worth It?". Although all other songs on this album had appeared in some form on their previous albums, only six of the songs previously appeared on an album in their single versions.

The album contains the Pet Shop Boys cover version of U2's hit "Where the Streets Have No Name", which later in the song breaks into the chorus of The Four Seasons' "Can't Take My Eyes Off You".

Around the time of the release of Discography, Pet Shop Boys also released a video collection, Videography, consisting of the music videos for each of the songs on this album in a slightly different order and with the song "Was It Worth It?" being replaced with "How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?", which itself was not on the audio versions of the album, despite being part of a double a-side with "Where the streets have no name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)" (the exclusion due to the constrictions of the CD's running time).

In 2003, Pet Shop Boys released an updated single collection called PopArt, which featured the video version of "Suburbia" and the album mix of "Heart" by mistake but excluding "Was It Worth It?". In addition, it featured all the Pet Shop Boys singles released after 1991 with the exception of "Absolutely Fabulous" and "How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?".
