lol ... yeah, you did beat me this time. But hey, who said that I'm unbeatable? 
Anyways, there are just two differences with your version:
1- This contains a keygen (serials might get blacklisted sooner or later).
2- This version is a newer release: this is 9.0 Build 663a1706 while yours probably is 9.0 Build 663a1703.

Anyhow, keep em going. :)"

,Skordy,2010-05-30T17:39Z,"Hey RH, just a quick question, that may make me sound noobish, but what the hell.... My AVG key that I was using expires within the next month, and I heard from a friend that the Embraced keys are some how virused or tracked, although I don't really understand how that it possible, I thought it'd be best to double check. Are these keys safe? "
