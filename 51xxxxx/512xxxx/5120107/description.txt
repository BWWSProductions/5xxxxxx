                 AVG Internet Security 9.0 Build 663a1706 + Keygen 



Complete protection for everything you do!

With AVG Internet Security, our most advanced protection, you get a worry-free 
online experience every time. Internet Security's multiple layers of protection 
mean you don't have to worry about identity theft, spam or viruses. And it'll 
even prevent you from accidentally visiting harmful sites.


It's faster, smarter security that won't slow your computer down.

Safely bank and shop online without fear of identity theft thanks to 
AVG's new Identity Protection technology
Surf, and search with confidence, with LinkScanner checking web pages 
at the only time that matters - right before you click that link


Additionally, Internet Security 9.0 pulls together elements of AVGâ€™s firewall, 
identity protection, and anti-virus signature detection capabilities to deliver 
the most accurate detection of new and unknown threats. This enhanced protection 
level makes use of cutting-edge technologies like application white-listing and 
"in-the-cloud" automated testing for tell-tale signs that indicate the presence 
of a new threat.

Complete security protection against all of the most serious Internet threats, 
including viruses, worms, spyware, trojans, etc. AVG Internet Security 9.0 
combines all the modern detection technologies in one integrated security 
solution: signature, heuristic, behavioral, in-the-cloud, and white listing. 
This combination of approaches delivers a comprehensive security package.

FASTER â€“ Scanning times can be a key requirement for customers. 
AVG Internet Security 9.0 utilizes a methodology that marks files as safe or 
potentially unsafe and then doesnâ€™t scan the safe files again until the file 
structure changes. This reduces scanning times by up to 50 percent. 

SAFER â€“ We have increased the degree of integration between the Resident Shield, 
firewall, and Identity Protection modules, allowing them share malware information 
with one other. This results in increased detection.

We listened to our customers and reviewers comments about our firewall. Itâ€™s been 
redesigned to be less intrusive. It works more tightly with Internet Securityâ€™s 
other components. There is no sacrifice in speed. Our new Trusted/Unsafe Database 
allows us to make more decisions for the user without their input. This makes the 
application quieter, safer, and more accurate. 

Weâ€™ve enhanced the real-time safe surfing capabilities of AVG LinkScanner and its 
heuristic capabilities. It applies more than 100 different threat indicators to a 
web page. If the results are inconclusive, it makes a call into the cloud and our 
research network to make a final call. 60% of transient threats exist on a site 
for less than a day. The AVG LinkScanner component is designed to stop them.

EASIER TO USE â€“ The number of screens required to install the product has been 
reduced by about half. The user interface has been redesigned. 

Internet Security 9.0 will detect a significant number of security solutions that 
could be on the system. Weâ€™re partnering with OPSWAT to provide our customers 
their AppRemover utility. This will make it easier for them to completely 
uninstall other security software that may cause conflicts with our solution. 

FOR GAMERS - Internet Security 9.0 offers Gamer Mode. This allows the Gamer to 
enjoy online games without sacrificing security. Gamers wonâ€™t be interrupted by 
a "Firewall Ask Dialog", for example, should an unknown application attempt to 
establish an Internet connection. The end result is a more enjoyable gaming 
experience. 

AVG Internet Security 9.0 is faster, safer, and easier to use. It includes theft 
recovery assistance. How could your readers not be interested? We have a brief 
Reviewerâ€™s Guide that will help you quickly understand and examine what the 
product offers. 

When you install AVG Internet Security, every one of these features is 
fully-functional - there's no need to do a thing.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
