,piratechelo,2009-12-25T18:20Z,"numse = the average english-speaking cunt who didn't have an education decent enough to include more than one language in the package.

Illiterates, LOL, go to Spain and look for illiterate people. Go to Argentina, Cuba, and look for illiterate people, let's see if you can find it. Most of them can speak at least two languages, something I doubt you can. "
