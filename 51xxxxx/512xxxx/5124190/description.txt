The Byrds were an American rock and roll band. Formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964, The Byrds underwent several personnel changes, with frontman Roger McGuinn remaining the sole consistent member until the group disbanded in 1973.

Their trademark songs include covers of Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "My Back Pages", Pete Seegerâ€™s "Turn! Turn! Turn!" and Carole King's "Goin' Back", as well as the originals "Iâ€™ll Feel a Whole Lot Better", "Eight Miles High", "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star".

The Byrds were popular and influential during the mid-1960s and into the early 1970s. Initially, the band played folk rock, melding influences such as the British Invasion sound, contemporary folk and pop music. Later they expanded their sound into such sub-genres as space rock, psychedelic rock and, on their 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, country rock.

During 1991 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004 Rolling Stone Magazine ranked them #45 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time
