This is Final Fantasy IX as 4 separate Eboot.pbp's, 1 for each disc.

Customized Icon, Background, and video while hovering the icon. (This does repeat! Discs 1 and 3 have the same Video, while Discs 2 and 4 have the same Video. Each took me hours to customize, but I did it. For you!) Oh, almost forgot! it also has the booklet as a document.dat inside each folder. In game hit home and select Software Manual

Has been tested trough the first save point by myself on phat psp and slim psp with custom firmware 5.50Gen-b2.

To use: Copy folder with eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

A lot of people experience lagg and freezing with Final Fantasy VIII and IX, if you simply go to the restore panel on your custom firmware PSP (hold down R during boot up with custom firmware) and there should be an option to overclock processor. Overclocking has prevented nearly all lagg and freezing FOR ME.

Please comment if you enjoy my torrent, I have many pSX games that I've converted for myself that I can post, or if you have any requests.

(If anyone wants this as 1 file, I have it also, just don't want to upload without a demand)

If anyone has any problems with the game, or if you want to request a game for upload, you can E-Mail me at iammrfrank@gmail.com

(um.. One other thing.. this torrent says it has 0 seeds and like 1 leecher, and everything I check it, it looks about the same, but in reality it has quite a few seeds and a few leechers also. I don't know why Thepiratebay doesn't see this.)
