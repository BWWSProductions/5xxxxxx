The title song, "Cherry Cherry Christmas," is filled with references to many of Diamond's greatest hits. Newly written and recorded by Neil Diamond for Christmas 2009, it is destined to become a new Christmas standard.

Newly included with the re-mastered classics are a transcendent "Amazing Grace"; another new Neil Diamond original, "Christmas Dream"; and a party-time version of Adam Sandler's comedic "The Chanukah Song," produced by DJ Ashba (Guns N' Roses).
