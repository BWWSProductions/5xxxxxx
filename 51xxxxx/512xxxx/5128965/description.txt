Young, energetic and aspiring singer who does not want to be within four walls of her house. Writes a non-profit music and wants to share it with many people, who care about women's instrumental lyrics, mixed with electronic things.
The uniqueness of this project is that from the beginning to the end it was created by only one Oksana, occasionally resorting to the help of outsiders.
Music, lyrics, arrangements ... Oksana united all these things in herself.
It's not often to meet a person with musical talent of an entire group, like one man - band ..
Oksana has this innate ability.

No commerce.
No arrogance.
Music is from the soul and not otherwise.

The free distribution and the desire to give beautiful music to all the world

I hope you and your friends would like it

Happy listening!
