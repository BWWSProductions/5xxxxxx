,azyins27,2009-10-13T10:13Z,"82114194
Just one question ..do you use dial up connection because the fastest download that i have comes from secret_myth i have optimum boot and i download at 300kbps or more and sometimes i go up to 500kbps so i don't know what u got but you are wrong "

i'm simply wondering cuz i would hate to download a great movie and watch t in 2.0"
,daqid,2010-01-05T08:39Z,"i usually run all my MKVs through xeonmkv for my 360 but i'm glad i stumbled on to you. i downloaded a 10gig mkv of this movie last week, ran it through xeonmkv and it just would not play for some reason, i downloaded bolt a couple of months ago and it did the same thing. i never had any problems with xeonmkv but i'll just skip that whole process from now on, THANKS!"
