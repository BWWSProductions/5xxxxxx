Release Length: 01:58:00
Storyline: The film opens in France, in 1641. The Scotsman Klan McCullen has been accused of selling 
weaponry to both the Scots and French. Rather than being executed for treason, the jury brands his face with a white-hot mask in 
order to humiliate him. In the near future, weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) has created a nanotechnology-based 
weapon capable of destroying an entire city. His company MARS sells four warheads to NATO, and the U.S. Army is tasked with 
delivering the warheads. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are delivering the warheads when they are ambushed by 
the Baroness (Sienna Miller), who Duke recognized to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel 
Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command 
center in North Africa, and upon arriving rendezvous with General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the head of the G.I. Joe Team. Hawk takes 
command of the war-heads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to have them join his group after Duke reveals that he 
knows the Baroness.
