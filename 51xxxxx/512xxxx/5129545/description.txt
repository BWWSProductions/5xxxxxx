SYNOPSIS

Sam Beckett has leapt into a 26-year-old American male on a visit to Paris, France. Finding himself with a beautiful young British girl, all seems well until Sam discovers the exact date... August 30, 1997, twenty-four hours before the death of Princess Diana.

Sam ascertains that his mission is to prevent Dianaâ€™s tragic death, yet the Quantum Leap project has been dismantled since budget cuts forced the project to run itself on archaic computer systems.  With no guidance from Al or Ziggy (the projectâ€™s hybrid computer), Sam is forced to go it alone. 

In one last desperate attempt, Sam is able to contact the present time period for help. Given the sensitive nature of his mission, news of his mission reaches the highest echelons of the United States Government... the President. Presented with the unthinkable chance at averting the last great tragedy of the 20th century, the President orders the project back on-line in a race to help Sam achieve his mission.  

However, as the projectâ€™s team is reassembled, the true nature of Samâ€™s mission is slowly revealed. With two distinct objectives, and under direct order from the President of the United States, it is up to Sam and Al to find a way to change history for the better, putting right where it once went wrong.
