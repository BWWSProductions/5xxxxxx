Don't act like a nOOb"
,ISnuffer,2010-01-03T17:57Z,"Be nice.  It is hard to believe at times, there is a chance of viruses which is why if you pirate you need good virus software, AND to top it all off it's illegal (of course who cares).  Don't get pissed at some kid for seeming amazed."

,Aneko,2010-01-08T00:57Z,"you know i sometimes wonder if kurt would have still been as good as he was if he were alive noew and making music. as much as i love kurt and nirvana i dont think hed be nearly as good, like most bands who come back. this is definitely a great torrent!   "

,rugburn11,2010-04-16T17:26Z,"Anyone know the BIT RATE for this...?

192 or ...?  kbps"
,Vice94,2010-04-28T21:31Z,"Even tho nirvana had a dark and sad ending, it's still one of the best bands ever. I just started to listen to them two days ago. Didn't even know who kurt was before then! RIP Kurt - All he wanted was to be left alone, and be famous for the music he made. Even up to this date, many nirvana fans has still not got this, and still talk about his notes and private life and his suicide, more than they talk about the actual music.

That's just kinda sad imo :/"
,SNES_VS_PS1,2010-05-05T10:09Z,"MY FAVOURITE BAND OF ALL TIME!
RIP KURT COBAIN!"

,Leahforreal,2010-07-02T18:48Z,"@Aneko

I belive the time period allowed him to make the music, in a different time, it wouldnt have as much meaning, And I believe once someone like that has rode theyre emotions so long theyre just spent the rest of theyre lives...

ie 
jim morrison
janis joplin,
jimi hendrixs,
Kurt cobain
Brain Jones
ect."

,leslieianramos,2011-01-02T00:36Z,thanks
,zenitram3,2011-01-05T09:05Z,"Well said, Vice94 & Aneko. Sad that everyone has to dig in his personal life and all that nonsense (especially those making money off of it) than to just sit back and enjoy this phenomenal band. 

Sucks to say but it seems that the legends die at the right time and that's what gives them that solid mark. "
