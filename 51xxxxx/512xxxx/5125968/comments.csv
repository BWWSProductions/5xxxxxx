,kev2011,2009-12-09T09:42Z,"To gangster2421
if you can't get a full version of spyware doctor the spyware doctor in the Google pack (at http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html?hl=en&gl=us&utm_source=en-com-pc_tools_learn_more&utm_medium=com&utm_campaign=en) will give u a starter edition with threat removal, thats what im using for the time being "
,kev2011,2009-12-10T03:21Z,also if you download the google pack version of spyware doctor and use one of the serials for the  link above it should register it to a full version and you probably have to do the same update.exe overwrite thing mentioned in TheShadowZ comment
,astro2,2009-12-23T17:35Z,"exe won't open but i used the legit version and then used this serial.

thanks again to torrents, god i love the invention of torrents. Didn't have to use a warez site and risk getting MORE virus and malware.

Took a days search and finally found something to remove this crap. YAY"
,tommyriantoro,2009-12-26T14:31Z,thank you !
,Shaftell,2010-01-07T04:28Z,"Hello.

,BLACKPHOENIXRIZIN,2010-06-28T04:31Z,"Murlok

I wish u 2 know that ur torrent does in fact work, I wuz able 2 download the program, install it & use it. But their is 1 feature that doesn't work, like siroam & few other pirate have mentioned & that is the smart update. I keep getting the message:(INVALID SUBSCRIPTION) & I can't update new info. So if u know why this is happing I & Im sure many other fellow pirate would just love 2 know. And 2 my fellow piratez, if I should find the fix 4 this prob rest assured I will 4ward the info asap! Until then peace. And thanx heapz murlok.
