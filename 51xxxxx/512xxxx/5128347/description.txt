Three cops try to set up a sting by establishing their own Fencing operation. They have less than complete support from above and as they begin mingling more and more with the underworld elements decide to finance the operation through re-selling some of the proceeds.  

When a police department's burglary task force is facing the possibility of being shut down because of their low conviction rate decides to try a new approach to apprehending their targets. They take over a pawn shop where thieves go to unload their merchandise. They record them as they bring stuff in and get them to tell them where they got it. Eventually they're threatened by the mob.
