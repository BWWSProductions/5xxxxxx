--About Deadstar--
Deadstar was an Australian band from Melbourne based around the songs of singer Caroline Kennedy and guitarist Barry Palmer (Hunters and Collectors).

Other members of the band were (at different times) Peter McCracken (bass), Michael den Elzen (guitar; ex-Schnell Fenster), and ex-Crowded House members Peter Jones (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass).

Their style can be described as rock, the guitars, on especially the first two albums, are the core of their music. The third album Somewhere Over The Radio saw a greater emphasis on their distinctive brand of jangly pop/rock spawning two singles "Run Baby Run" and "Deeper Water" (their biggest hit, reaching #28 on the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart[1]) bringing the band some success in Australia in 1999.

The band enjoyed mixed success during its lifetime. Always Triple J favourites and in later days finding themselves on high rotation on the commercial radio stations.
