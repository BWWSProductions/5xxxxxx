600,000, if not as many as 3 million Jews, were allegedly murdered in Belzec camp between Nov. 1941 and Dec. 1942. Various murder weapons are claimed: diesel gas chambers; quicklime in trains; high voltage; vacuum chambers. According to witnesses, the corpses were finally incinerated on huge pyres without leaving any traces... This study exposes the Belzec hoax by thoroughly examining all available evidence, including forensic drillings and excavations of the late 1990s.
