Sanctuary was a turning point for the J. Geils Band. The album embodies musical and production sophistication not found in previous albums by the band.

What makes the album outstanding is that despite the new-found polish the band acquired with this record the grit, rhythm, pathos and plain old fun which is a trademark of "the bad boys from Boston" still is everpresent.

The song "One Last Kiss" received great radio play at the time it was released and is an upbeat blue-inspired rocker of love lost.

"Sanctuary", the title track features Peter Wolf's vocal at their most expressive and some wicked harp by Magic Dick.

The song "Teresa" is simply one of the best pop songs I've heard by any band. Again Wolf's vocals are at their most expressive; they are plaintive and heart rending, matching Seth Justman's piano.

"Wildman" and "Jus' Can't Stop Me" are great party rave-ups,
