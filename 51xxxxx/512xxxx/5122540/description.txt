Anyway, I found this, thought it was cool. 3 year old loves it.
I like Carole King's songs in it...

Genre: Animation

Explore the fascinating world of imagination in the company of master illustrator and storyteller Maurice Sendak. In this animated version of Where the Wild Things Are, Sendak's striking illustrations spring to life as the wild boy Max magically metamorphoses into the King of the Wild Rumpus right before viewers' eyes. Carole King lends a folksy, sometimes jazzy sound to Nutshell Library stories "Pierre," "One Was Johnny," and "Chicken Soup with Rice" as viewers learn about the alphabet, counting, and months of the year. Finally, Mickey's nighttime discovery In the Night Kitchen culminates in an impressively rendered ride through space. Sendak's original artwork is faithfully preserved in this animated presentation and Peter Schickele's narration, and original musical compositions add richness and depth to the stories.
