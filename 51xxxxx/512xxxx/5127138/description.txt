2009 sophomore album, the follow-up to his multi-million selling debut, produced by Mika and Greg Wells (Katy Perry, Pink).

"The Boy Who Knew Too Much" features guest contributions by Imogen Heap and Final Fantasy's Owen Pallett, and contains the brilliant first single 'We Are Golden'. The album straddles a line between childish naâ€¹vetâ€š and world-worn sophistication; Mika likens this transformation as the shift from childhood and his debut's innocence to something more akin to adolescence.

The arrangements are bigger and more beautiful than ever before, and the album is underpinned by an open-hearted and accepting idea of what living in the 21st century means in all its contradictory, complicated glory.
