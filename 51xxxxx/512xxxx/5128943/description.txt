  From book jacket:

Set in pre-Revolutionary China, The Good Earth is the poignant story of Wang Lung, a rice farmer whose industry and commitment to the land enable him and his family to prosper. But unexpected drought forces the family south in search of food, and there they suffer the spiritual impoverishment of life in the city. Wang Lungâ€™s courageous journey back to his farm is a spiritual affirmation of the values of the land.
