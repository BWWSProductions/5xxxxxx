Thank You for this version of The Good Earth as narrated by George Guidall.   He's one of the best so I'm sure this will be an excellent rendition of a classic"

  I haven't seen Pearl S Buck's other books in audio - Recorded Books, Books On Tape, Brilliance, Harper, Hachette, Random House, S&S, etc - none seem to have done them. Too bad. 
If anyone finds info on those, let us know.

Thanks for the feedback.
Thanks to the seeders."
