Welcome to Issue 50 â€“ the big 5-0! I hope you love the front cover artwork as much as we do â€“ that would be the talents of Andrew Hickinbottom shining through in his latest character illustration, Hoteru no aoi. Weâ€™re really pleased to be able to feature this image in our October gallery, so hop on over to p.16 to see more great artwork from this monthâ€™s featured artists, before getting yourselves stuck into our latest offeringsâ€¦
