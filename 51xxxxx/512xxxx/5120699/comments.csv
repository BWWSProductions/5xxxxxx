,Antanas26,2010-01-30T17:27Z,Everything would be fine but encoding mere conversations in 320 kbit/s stereo is a total waste of space to say the least of it. Few use such a high bitrate for music!
,T_Zero,2010-09-10T04:09Z,"I agree with Antanas26 on the unnecessary high bitrate for mere conversations... 

In any case, thanks for the upload... 

The Intro, Book 2 and 3 are also very welcome."
