,milko101,2009-10-11T22:27Z,can anyone comfirm this works ?
,burgemichael,2009-11-08T11:51Z,"ok genius, think about it... if you use cod tool, one of the tabs are gone because of discontinuation of the tool. the program requires its connection to cod tools server to enable the co-op mods. also think about this, the game disc controls the files so it would make a hell of alot more since to mod the iso, seeing as though the cd could possibly rule out the harddrive mods in the future.

think twice before calling someone a dumbass"
