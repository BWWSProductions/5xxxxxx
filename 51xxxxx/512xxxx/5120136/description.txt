This is a modded .iso I made for Call of Duty: World at War for Xbox 360

I didn't stealth patch it so you might want to do that to be sure. I downloaded the .iso and modded it and uploaded it straight to here.

THIS IS NOT TESTED!!!! If it doesn't work, i'm sorry.

It has mods binded to buttons for Co-op and Single Player ONLY!!! NO RANKED GAME MODDING!!! ONLY CO-OP!!!

Put in comments of what you think I should change...
