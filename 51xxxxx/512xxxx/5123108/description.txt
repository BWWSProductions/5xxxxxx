Evgeny Yantovsky, J. Gorski, "Zero Emissions Power Cycles"
CRC | ISBN: 1420087916 | April 23, 2009 | 282 pages | PDF

Focusing on fossil-fueled, nonpolluting power generation systems, Zero Emissions Power Cycles presents alternative solutions to the severe emissions problems of power plants. Along with a description of new thermodynamic cycles and the results of computational analyses, this volume provides modern analytical tools and equations to evaluate exergy and introduce currentology.
