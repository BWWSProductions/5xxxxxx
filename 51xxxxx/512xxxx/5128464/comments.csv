Check ufowatchdog.com and you'll find a lot of these names on their hall of shame list.  Nothing but fantasy here, folks.  For something that is actually worth watching check out I Know What I Saw."

,Gobo69,2009-11-13T00:11Z,nope there is only parts in this docu.
,Gobo69,2009-11-13T14:28Z,2 parts even
,iiJeebz,2009-12-08T06:11Z,"Is this actually Secret Space or what???
If so, I already have the DVD...

If this is Secret Space, why is this torrent titled ""UFO - S4 Informers""?"
