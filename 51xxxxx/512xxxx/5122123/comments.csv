,9166,2009-10-13T21:01Z,"would be rly nice if u seeded so at least one of us got 100%:D,, common make it happend and ill seed this forever after!"
,chillaxr,2009-10-13T22:23Z,"Okay, I was having problems with my internet connection, but I fixed it now, and I'm seeding at maximum capacity.  "
,ShineEyes,2009-10-14T04:06Z,Seems to still be an issue x_x going at 0.5kb/sec for me.
,ShineEyes,2009-10-14T04:08Z,"Sorry for the double post.  I should note that the 32-bit version is downloading at a much better 25-80 (it fluctuates) kb/sec.  I need both, as my desktop is for 64-bit apps and my laptop would only benefit from 32-bit."
,ahhzz,2009-10-14T05:19Z,Thx chill
,chillaxr,2009-10-14T05:26Z,"It is all good ShineEyes:

Im only uploading at around 24kb/s, and thats at my max upload rate.  No one seems to be trying to DL because normally that number will shoot up to something really high.  "
,dark_isle,2009-10-14T06:22Z,"Anyone got any working serials yet? And on another note, will this clean out my hard drive upgrading? I have Vista. Tnx! "
,DPencil,2009-10-17T11:09Z,I respect the effort you took to upload this torrent (both x86 and x64 version) but Everest reports version number win7_rtm.090713-1255. So I'm afraid it's not the real deal yet.
,9166,2009-10-18T23:44Z,"DL finally started movin at gd speed,, ty seeders: ).. Dunno if Dpencil is right about this not bein release ver, but it sure isÂ´nt beta and all looks great! nice torrent:).. I also found a key after some searchin wich can be used to install with (althouh u will need to activate windows 3 days later, but should give enough time to hack it).. anyways: 22TKD-F8XX6-YG69F-9M66D-PMJB  .. Peace"
