The Bloody Beetroots are an Italian electronica and dance music duo. Formed in late 2006 by producer Bobby Rifo, an international indie producer, and DJ Tommy Tea. Often compared with French band Justice, the duo wear Venom masks while performing. The duo had a short tour of the United States in early 2008, alongside DJ Steve Aoki. In 2008, their song "Butter" was included on the soundtrack for FIFA 09 and "Mac Mac" was featured in 2K Sports' NBA 2K9.

Romborama is the title of the debut studio album by Italian electronic duo The Bloody Beetroots. It was released on 21 August 2009. Some tracks are taken from earlier Bloody Beetroots releases, for example "Butter" can also be found on the Rombo EP.
