This set is incredible. Rosen has spent years studying and writing about this unique music and it is immediately apparent in these magnificent recordings. His interpretation is peerless and his mastery and technique infallable despite the rugged difficulty of Beethoven's late piano music. 

The "Hammerklavier" performance is wonderful, and every nuance is shaped logically and artistically despite the extreme challenges found almost everywhere in this profound work. Rosen is able to do the near impossible, which is to "own" this unusual and deeply expressive music. He doesn't just play it, he lives it as though every impulse in his mind and body is focused on expressing this "symphony" for piano. 

The sound is top notch, and Rosen's instrument has a very rich and present sonority. Recommended without any reservation whatsoever. If you are interested in Beethoven, here is his music played in such a manner that you will find yourself completely absorbed in his unique and powerful musical world.
