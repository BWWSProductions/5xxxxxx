A cult hit amongst gore enthusiasts, this campy splatter flick takes its plot cues from reality TV game shows. Four young people are locked in a room and play cards. When someone loses, they must endure some of the most gruesome torture imaginable. Luckily, the winner walks away, or limps rather, with $100,000. The success of this bare bones horror gem, directed by Japan's V-cinema staple Daisuke Yamanouchi, spawned a sequel even more disgusting.
