,Beyker,2010-02-07T23:57Z,"Great info on the file, exactly what I wanna know.

The speed though is okay, but people can do something about this by seeding.

Quality? Pretty good, in my opinion:) What you can expect from a '700 :)"

,Rickslick,2010-04-20T16:15Z,Quick look - great A & V! =)
,voltsin,2010-05-22T03:01Z,"Aspect ratio is ~1.89:1 - so you'll need to adjust this via your player's settings to get it to ~2.35:1.  In MPC it's easy to do simply by pressing the number 6 key on the numpad several times (the AR is displayed at the bottom.  

Video quality itself is not overly great, but probably around what you could expect for 700MB.  Haven't listened to the audio yet, but just dl'd a better rip anyway so will delete this one."
