BNSF's Fallbridge Subdivision

From headwaters in Canada, the Columbia River flows over twelve hundred miles to the Pacific Ocean and for many of those miles it marks the boundary between the states of Washington and Oregon. Cutting through the Cascade Mountains, the river slices through an 80-mile stretch known as the Columbia River Gorge where the basalt mountains tower up to 4,000 feet above the water. Nearby dormant volcanoes such as Mount Hood and Mount Adams add to the incredible beauty of the Gorge area.

Following the north bank of the river between Vancouver and Pasco, Washington is Burlington Northern Santa Fe's Fallbrook Subdivision. This is a prized site for railfans, offering spectacular vistas and nonstop railroading. Journey with Pentrex from Vancouver east to Maryhill along this scenic route and experience the variety of trains and motive power that ply this famous line. Enjoy scenes of Amtrak's Empire Builder and Talgo train, Swift RoadRailers, bare-table trains, trash trains, manifests, and unit grain trains. Motive power includes BNSF locomotives in Heritage I paint; a matched set of GE Dash 9s in Heritage II, pure sets of BN green power, and rare GP50s in classic Santa Fe blue-and-yellow paint. Also seen are SD40-2s, SD75s, GP38s, GP38-2s, B40-8s, B40-8Ws, and Dash 8-40CWs. The line is dotted with tunnels. You'll see many meets and great action over the swing bridge between Portland and Vancouver. For sheer beauty and interest, railroading on BNSF's Columbia River Gorge Fallbridge Sub just can't be beat!
