An interesting compilation of some of the curiosities and questions related to this event but quite possibly the worst production values for a documentary.  The host of the thing is clearly reading off cue cards and still manages to stumble on his words occaisionally.  At one point he's even talking while in his kitchen, drying dishes.

Some pretty decent source material used from various tv networks.  The most interesting of which is audio which is supposed to be negotiations between the police and Bryant who was calling himself as ""Jamie"" and refering to another gunman being present during the final stand off."
