New album of Siberian world(ethnic)-rock band Bugotak. 

"You should throw away everything you ever knew about rock music and tuvan throat singing! Restrictions and taboos, even your own idea of art will be smashed by giant Stone-Age-Wheels of brand new Bugotak's album and you will find out that independent music sees no borders and uses limitations just as bricks in a stairway that guides you to the unexplored worlds. 

Music must live. Wheels must roll."

This is first tuvan music project that is published unfer free CC-BY license.
