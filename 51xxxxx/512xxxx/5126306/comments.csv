,surcal,2009-10-19T10:22Z,THis did not work on my iphone India BSNL. This custom restore is not Activated. (Checkmark for activation was not selected). After restoring it asks to activate the iphone. I had to restore my iphone back to 3.0.1. I think it will not work with Tmobile also.

THIS WILL NOT WORK ON TMOBILE. IT IS NOT ACTIVATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do not waste your time unless you have AT&T."
,lancelight,2010-04-03T21:04Z,"BEWARE.  THIS WILL NOT JAILBREAK YOUR PHONE!!!  If you restore with this file, you STILL have to jail break it using BlackRain here:  http://www.blackra1n.com/blackra1n.exe

If you attempt to restore with this, you WILL receive the dreaded ""911 Emergency"" screen.  But dont panic, your baseband will still be untouched.  So all you have to do is DL black rain, plug the phone into USB, CLOSE ITUNES when it pops up, TAKE OUT THE SIM CARD, and then open Blackrain and click the ""Rain"" button.  It will literally take about 30 seconds and then your phone will be restored and you'll be able to get to Cydia so that you can install UltraSn0w once again.  Make sure to update cydia first."
