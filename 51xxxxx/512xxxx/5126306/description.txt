___________________________

If youâ€™re already jailbroken (by whatever means), you donâ€™t need to mess around with DFU mode at all.  Just create (or get from a friend) your custom IPSW and Option-Restore (Shift-Restore on Windows) to it via iTunes.  Donâ€™t enter DFU mode at all.  Please make sure you are restoring to the custom IPSW, not the stock one from Apple!  For best results, use the latest iTunes (9.0.1) â€” which includes a nice new application organizer.		



My method of install:

- Connect the iPhone to your Mac and open iTunes
- Option+Restore, Select the IPSW from this download
- When restored you can either setup as new or use a backup to restore prefs and app data.
- Go into Cydia, update, install Ultrasn0w and AppSync 3.1
- enter your T-Mobile APN, probably epc.tmobile.com
