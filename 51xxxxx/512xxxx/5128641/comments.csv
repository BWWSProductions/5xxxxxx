,Flopis,2010-02-18T02:11Z,"Joe Mantegna played SPENSER in 3 TV movies: SMALL VICES (1999), THIN AIR (2000), and WALKING SHADOW (2001). 
Do you have them? 
Could you upload them?
Thanks!"
,LazarusL,2012-06-16T18:05Z,"Can anybody explain to me why all 4 of the Spenser movies on this site are listed as having seeders...but in the past 12 hours, none of them has seeded a damn thing?  I downloaded a whopping 7 megabytes of  A Savage Place in the first minute, and nothing whatsoever of any of them since.  How can there be seeders listed, when they're not seeding? Very frustrating...."
,LazarusL,2012-06-17T03:38Z,"THANK you, seeder, whoever you are. I appreciate your kindness. Once I have it I'll help keep it seeded as long as I can."
