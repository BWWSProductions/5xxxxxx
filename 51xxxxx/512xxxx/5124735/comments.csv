So, is there a way to convert to PAL? 
Thanx."
,p5ik0,2009-10-23T16:44Z,"you dont need to change it to pal it's pointless, just use the region hacks in preloader and it works fine"
,Keiny87,2009-10-24T14:16Z,I can't seem to be able to play this on my Wii :(   I burned it 4 times already on x4 speed using Ashampoo burning studio 9 (which by the way successfully burnt about 10 other Wii games that I downloaded from TPB). I thought perhaps I needed to update the firmware but that didn't work either. Help anyone? Please?
