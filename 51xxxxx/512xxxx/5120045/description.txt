Thomas & Friends: Hero of the Rails is a feature-length movie based on the television series Thomas and Friends.

Thomas discovers an old Japanese engine named Hiro and sets out to restore him to his former glory with the help of his friends fearful that if the Fat Controller found out, he would have Hiro scrapped. At the same time he has to avoid Spencer who is suspicious of Thomas activities.

The movie introduces full CGI animation (by Nitrogen Studios Canada Inc.) replacing model work, and the addition of a voice cast of the characters alongside the narration (excluding the Magic Railroad).
