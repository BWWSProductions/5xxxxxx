,dastar101,2009-10-15T18:15Z,To play this on ixtreme 1.6 you will need the activate.iso disk due to the new wave 4 protection. 1.51 will play it fine
,jester_msc,2009-10-15T19:34Z,I read a lot of people can't get this to boot even with 1.51 or using the activate.iso for 1.6. Has anyone tested it yet? Thanks for the upload MQFPLO
,ShineEyes,2009-10-17T04:32Z,On second thought...why the hell would you even want to play this!? XD
,saada245,2009-10-17T09:37Z,So i thought all games were wave 4 that play on IX 1.6
,sammaful,2009-10-17T11:22Z,no current games that play on v1.6 are wave 3 the reason 1.51 will or should play these games is that is was a beta and doesnt check one of the crc's or something like that for online play where as when they created 1.6 the added that feature in for xbox live safety and from what ive been reading over at xbox-scene.com the iso disk isnt the be all and all as that might very well be detactable and besides this is a shit game and as its the only wave 4 so far i think i can live without this one and the iso disk and just wait till they do a update to ixtreme poss a 1.61 as i dont think theres much tweaking that needs to be changed from what ive read to make wave 4 easily compatible but still big thanks to the uploader is always appriciated just hope mw2 is wave 3 for the time being
