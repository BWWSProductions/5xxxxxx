Food of the Gods, The

American International Pictures
1976

Want cheapo sleazy drive-in movie horror? You can't go wrong with American International Pictures. And who better to share the back seat with than Marjoe Gortner, former revivalist who first gained a certain fame in the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s when he became the youngest ordained preacher at the age of four, and then outright notoriety in the 1970s when he starred in an Oscar-winning, behind-the-scenes documentary about the lucrative business of Pentecostal preaching. (see Wikipedia for more gory details on Marjoe.)


And what's the prestigious Ida Lupino doing in this sleaze-fest? Well, everybody's gotta eat, even the rats and worms that attack her!


Here's the whole cast, per IMDB:

Marjoe Gortner ... Morgan
Pamela Franklin ... Lorna
Ralph Meeker ... Jack Bensington
Jon Cypher ... Brian
Ida Lupino ... Mrs. Skinner
John McLiam ... Mr. Skinner
Belinda Balaski ... Rita
Tom Stovall ... Thomas
Chuck Courtney ... Davis
Reg Tunnicliffe ... Ferry Attendant

(That last guy, Reg, also turns up in the credits a few times as a grip and some other behind-the-scenes roles. He probably wears a rat costume or chicken head, too.)

There's some good miniature work in this movie. No, really!

Biggest gross-out: woman having a baby during the giant rat attack.
