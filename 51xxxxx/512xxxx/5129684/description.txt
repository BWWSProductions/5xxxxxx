THE GUITAR SHOW WITH ANDY ELLIS broadcasts every Thursday at 10:00pm CST on 98.9 FM WRFN, Radio Free Nashville, and on the web at www.radiofreenashville.org. 

In each program, we venture off the beaten path to explore inspiring sounds from great guitarists, past and present. 

The music encompasses a wide variety of styles and includes new releases as well as rare tracks from deep in the vault. We spotlight guitarists from around the world and also play exclusive, previously unheard interview clips from some of the greats of the guitar world. The goal is to provide an eclectic, adventurous and musically satisfying listening experience.
