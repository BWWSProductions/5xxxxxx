Grammy Award winning Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Rod Stewart will be releasing "The Great American SoulBook" on October 27, 2009, a collection of classic Sixties & Seventies-era soul favorites sung by one of the most interpretive voices in music.

Stewart is personally passionate about this project, which is a return to his beginnings when he fronted The Jeff Beck Band and the critically-revered band The Faces, iconic in the history books for fusing American roots music - rock, soul and blues. "The Great American Soulbook" reunites Stewart with his longtime collaborators, producers Steve Tyrell and Steve Jordan, of Rolling Stones/Xpensive Winos fame, who also brought in top musicians Ray Parker Jr., Waddy Watchel, Darrell Jones, Dean Parks and David Paich to join Rod in the studio for the album.

With an estimated 250 million in album and single sales to date, Rod Stewart is one of the most successful performers of all time. Possessing one of music's most distinctive voices, Rod's musical project "The Great American Songbook" series has been a recordbreaking success, selling over 19 million albums and becoming the biggest selling ongoing series of new music recordings in history. 

In 2006, Stewart released Still the Same, Great Rock Classics of Our Time, his first rock album in over eight years, which entered the charts at #1. He has sold out concerts across the globe and his last 5 studio albums have topped the Billboard charts. Rod spent this summer recording the Soulbook album and criss-crossing the country on a 20 city North American tour.
