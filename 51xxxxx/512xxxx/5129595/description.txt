Here is the Enterprise and Ultimate versions of Windows 7; both sha1 checked from the MSDN website. The files have not been edited at all. They are the RTM versions (Release to Manufacture), and hence are NOT activated. You must own a key, or find a WGA Validation Tool to use this ISO for longer than 60 days.
