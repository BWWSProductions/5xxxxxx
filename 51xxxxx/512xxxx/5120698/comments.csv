,shadowgreg,2009-10-13T02:03Z,"Hi Guys,
lately I have been having issues updating the tracker when it is thepiratebay. I have tried this on two Internet connections (one is Internode, which has uncapped uploads, and the other one is exetel, which has over 80 gigs a month data transfer) and I am never able to contact thepiratebay.org's tracker. This has been happening for over a month now. Anyone else having this problem?"
,mattratt320,2009-10-13T05:12Z,"If you use IPV6, none of TPB's trackers are working at the moment."

,LotusEL98,2009-10-18T05:26Z,"Sigh.

I've been googling trying to figure this one out, but first hand experience would probably help.

TPB was working fine a couple days ago when downloading things, but every single torrent I try to D/L from here just keeps ""connecting..."" and I end up with a 404 error.

I have no clue where to go from here, and I'm dying [ ;) ] to watch Dexter.

Help?"

is the piratebay not adding any new torrents today.. whats going on???? "
,shadowgreg,2009-10-20T07:26Z,"http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce seems to work although I am also getting the 404 error as indicated above. Thanks for the info, is it the same tracker as thepiratebay.org? i get issues with any trackers with thepiratebay.org in it, and it only responds every now and then (like every hour or two?)"
,BC604,2009-10-23T08:53Z,thankyou
,the_lol_guy,2009-10-24T12:18Z,is it only one episode?
,BC604,2009-10-25T08:09Z,Cheers!
,BC604,2009-10-25T08:10Z,yes  it's only one episode.
,mufuti9,2009-10-26T11:14Z,"""xsaimex's uploads come out earlier and they're faster ""

No they dont.
eztv is almost always the fastest - you just need to get their releases directly from their site.

If you wait until they upload it here - your fault.

eztv is the best. xsaimex probably takes their upload and uploads it here. :))"
