WHY do you people keep on HARD coding subs?!? I cant think of ANY device today that wont play subrip files (*.srt).

I completely understand that u wanna be a good sport to your fellow countrymen, props to ya, just dont understand why it has to be hardcoded.

If u'd make a subrip file, id just disable it or some. And u'd get another 10mbit uploader to your swarm. Now I cant download this, its just TOO anoying watching it with the wrong subs, cause it keeps reminding me that Im watching a movie and thats its not ""real"". it REALLY ruins the experience.

I'll bet u this: If you'd make a subrip file instead, with the same name as the avi, nicely packed in a rar called SweSub (so it wouldnt interfere - at all - to the majority of downloaders), u'd have 200 seeds right now.

I really dont get it."
