Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) is the seventh studio album released by American country singer-songwriter, Loretta Lynn. The album was released in 1967.

Don't Come Home a Drinkin was released shortly after the release of the title track in late 1966. The lead single peaked at #1 on the Billboard Country Chart, Lynn's first #1 hit on the chart. The album became the first album by a female Country singer to be certified "Gold" by the RIAA, meaning the album has solo 500,000 copies or more. "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin'" was the only single release off the album. Two tracks were released for Lynn's first of two 1967 regular studio albums. The album includes a cover version of "There Goes My Everything". Besides the lead single, Lynn wrote or co-wrote two songs for the album, "I Got Caught" and "Get What 'Cha Got and Go".

Allmusic gave Lynn's album a positve review, rating it five stars and calling her choice of selecting cover versions as something that "suits her perfectly", including her cover version of Ernest Tubb's "The Shoe Goes on the Other Foot Tonight".

As Lynn was beginning to get more control of her albums, more singles by Lynn were ones she wrote herself. This album set the trend for the future albums Lynn would record. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, her second album to do so. It also peaked at #80 on the Billboard 200.
