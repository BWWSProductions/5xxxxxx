I couldn't help myself and admit I have a problem.  Like not having sex with a pristine 18 year old Pamela Anderson, I caved.  With the perceived troubles on The Pirate Bay of recent I couldn't stop from doing it.  Yes, at midnight I watched the Phillip Island race on SpeedTV.  My name is David and I'm a MotoGP-ahloic.  :)

Can't wait to see what ""really"" happened now that I have a decent program to watch.  Could that start be any more insane?  Did Jorge just kiss any hopes of the title goodbye?  To these old eyes, after he gave a little love tap to bad boy Nicky Hayden it looked as if he righted the Fiat Yamaha for a split second or two.  Why did he go down in such a catastrophic manner?  I dare say all will be addressed very soon by Suzy, Charlie, Steve, and Matt.

Cheers tdmk1.  You sir, are a true gentleman.  FYI, my MotoGP Anonymous Meetings begin next week.  Sigh......."
