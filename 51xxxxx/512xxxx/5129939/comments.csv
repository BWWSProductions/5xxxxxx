,23photo,2009-12-20T10:35Z,"Utorrent gave me an error while downloading.

Something about unable to download while a user-mapping something....blah....dont know what it means.

unsuccessful download."
,23photo,2009-12-20T11:01Z,"Yes, it's me again.

What I did was delete that ""download job"" and the torrent file itself. Then I re-downloaded the same torrent file from here and selected to download the keygen only this time.
Then I went ahead and just downloaded the AVG IS 9.0 demo from the AVG site and installed it that way.

The keygen downloaded perfectly fine this time and is 100% virus free and working. 
My AVG Internet Security now expires in Feb, 2018! :)"
,csstechie,2009-12-20T17:52Z,Thank You! So Far So Good! 
,csstechie,2009-12-20T20:37Z,"Avg 9.0 Components have ""ERRORS"". The Web Shield, Firewall and ID protection specifically have errors after updating....I uninstalled! Went with the ""Free Version"" for now. Kaspersky happens to be the best security software out there. I just don't wanna pay eighty bucks for it. But you get what you pay for using Kaspersky 2010."
,CainUAC,2009-12-24T15:13Z,"thank you, i am dl'ing this in hopes that my disappeared DVD RW drive is thanks to a virus."

,paradox137,2009-12-29T00:28Z,"so i down loaded this and the keygen worked and all, but after rebooting and opening avg, it said that the firewall had a conflict with a driver....soooo....what now? does anyone else have this problem, and if so...howd you fix it?"

,TripHammer,2010-01-13T02:19Z,"Sorry, but keygen doesn't work properly. It generates a key, buy AVG keeps sending me a notice that the key is invalid and reduces my coverage to 15 days. Better off without it!"
,FEARLESS1964,2010-01-13T20:10Z,PEOPLE ARE GETTING THOSE NOTICES BECAUSE EVERYBODY KEEPS USING THE SAME FIRST AND SECOND KEY THAT POPS UP....THE KEYGEN HAS 15 KEYS....USE EM....ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE AVG BLACKLISTS ALL OF THEM....I SUGGEST YOU KEEP THE KEYGEN ON YOUR DESKTOP OR SOMEWHERE U CAN FIND IT...ALL OF THE KEYS WILL BE BLACKLISTED WITHIN THIS YEAR.
,Timewarptwo,2010-01-15T04:47Z,"About 10 days ago we started receiving pop-ups from ABG that the license was reduced to a 14 day trial period on my computer (Vista) and my wife's (Win 7). I keep uninstalling then re-installing AVG daily for over a week. Then I used Vista Manager and Windows 7 manager to unintall the AVG programs. Each manager program has a ""Smart Uninstaller"" under cleaner. It removes registry files left behind. After using the smart installer and the AVG Keygen (Clicking it about 6 or 7 times so as not to use the first few keys generated) So far so good. No pop-ups for almost a week now on either computer."
,gilguilherme,2010-01-20T16:43Z,"Very good, Good woork !"
,bootshacker,2010-01-24T04:43Z,i dont writ manny of this but this is clean and it realy works i had troble with other avg i had downloaded version 9 but after 4 months it said it was going to expire so i tried this kegen and it is working like a charm thank u fearless1964
,lin08,2010-01-29T13:08Z,"MovieMadness: The reason why Norton comes on most new computers is just because Symantec pays pc manufacturers to include their software on their machines. Norton is popular, that doesn't make it is the best. Besides Norton is bloatware."
,miaruehl3,2010-02-13T19:04Z,Yes it does work if you do what the others say dl from site the free demo (free trial) dl this only the keygen from here and then use this and it is good until 2018.   Did on both my computers and works great. 
,icutenewb,2010-02-25T00:33Z,"Awesome, 8 years of AVG =) Thanks!"
,brambram,2010-03-09T14:39Z,"all clean
good job
ty"
,rhyswilliams999,2010-03-22T17:54Z,"THis whole thing about serials is rubbish, they dont check it if you set it up correctly.
1. run the avg install...
2. when promted use the advanced install method.
3. use one of the seriels in the keygen in the box, replacing the default trail key,
finish the install.
4. restart your computer.
5. open the main AVG window.
6. go into the advanced settings for the update section.
7. in the URL bit untick the first URL.
8. select the second backup URL and and move it to the top using the move up button at the side.
9. save changes.
10. close the window.
11. you finally have a working version of AVG internet security!

i doing this of the top of my head but i have done it before, it has been the same since AVG 7.5 (i still have a working copy of that)

Remember it is for evaluation purposes only!!!
and if you like the product, BUY IT!!

Thanks  Rhys Williams  "
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-01T20:22Z,Does this one actually have the Firewall and Anti-Spam installed? the other ones don't seem to have it.
