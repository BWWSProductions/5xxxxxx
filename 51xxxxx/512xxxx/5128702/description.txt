From Wiki:



Yes are an English progressive rock band that was formed in London in 1968. Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, extended song lengths, abstract lyrics, and a general showcasing of instrumental prowess. Yes blends symphonic and other 'classical' structures with their own brand of musical style. Despite a great many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band has continued on for over forty years and still retains a large following.[1] Band members Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Alan White toured in late 2008 and early 2009 with vocalist BenoÃ®t David and keyboardist Oliver Wakeman on the In The Present Tour.







Big Generator 1987


Big Generator is the twelfth studio album by progressive rock band Yes. It was released in 1987 on Atlantic Records' Atco subsidiary label (Yes' last studio album for Atlantic) and was the follow-up to the massively successful 90125 album.

A laborious album to make, Big Generator's sessions dragged on for two years, largely due to creative differences. Guitarist Trevor Rabin was aiming to progress beyond 90125, while founding lead vocalist Jon Anderson was beginning to yearn for more traditional Yes music.

The result was an album that was successful commercially, with two songs reaching the Top 40: "Love Will Find A Way" (also a #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart) and "Rhythm Of Love" (their last in the US Top 40). The album was not as popular as 90125, and feeling that the band was going in a direction he didn't want to pursue, Jon Anderson began working on other projects at the conclusion of the Big Generator tour in 1988 including a partial reformation with his Yes bandmates from the 1970s.

It is unclear if the album will ever be reissued by Rhino Records with additional bonus tracks as all previous Atlantic studio releases have been. While new additional material has not been available, unreleased demos may be pulled from the Warner vaults, or live material from 1988 used on the box set, Yesyears.
