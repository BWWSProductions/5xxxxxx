These files have been edited using Soundbooth to remove all the commercials, traffic updates, world news, etc. Pretty much everything that isn't them has been removed. I'll be doing this every day, as long as people seed.

UPDATE:
Yes, KABC does in fact release the previous day's episode in what they call "podcast" form (thought it's far from that). While KABC does have the original show, the version they release (in three parts), is far from great. It was encoded as a 32 kbps MP3 in mono and sounds terrible compared to the live version. I can understand why KABC would do this, though: bandwidth saving. That's why they need to turn to BitTorrent! ;)

Enjoy, and please...seed!
