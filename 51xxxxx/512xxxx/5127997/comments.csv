,styxjp,2009-11-17T20:05Z,one more thing... is this NTSC? thanks
,Halo428,2009-12-12T17:44Z,All these seeds and just 2 comments? C'mon people! Does this fit on a normal DVD-R since the limit is 4.37GB? 
,Stattlich,2009-12-25T22:45Z,"Judging by ""[US]"" in the title, it's pretty safe to assume that this is a NTSC game version. If you don't want to make that assumption, you can just use your loader to force video to NTSC."

,philby79,2010-02-18T09:15Z,"Works great, I've got NTSC compatible TV in Aus and having no troubles at all!! Great work!!"
