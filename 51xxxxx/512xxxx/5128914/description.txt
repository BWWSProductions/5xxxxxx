Rippers Notes

Attention:

Please use the mkv2bluray.exe in order to create a bluray
structure or create a iso image.
Follow the easy instructions with in the exe and enjoy your movie.

Note:

IGUANA feels its best to only include English subtitles + 1
optional subtitle language in the iso image or bluray structure.
You will have a subtitle language choice in our mkv2bluray.exe.
We feel the rest of the groups should do the same in order to
keep the video bitrate as high as possible.
