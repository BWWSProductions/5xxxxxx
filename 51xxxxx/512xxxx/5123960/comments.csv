,X45JKD,2010-03-18T04:51Z,"Just finished testing and comparing the subtitles above with this movie and the 1.19GB version here at Piratebay on a different torrent.

This version with the corresponding srt file is the best translation of the movie thus far. I highly recommend it.

Thanks for the upload!"
