If youâ€™re already jailbroken (by whatever means), you donâ€™t need to mess around with DFU mode at all.  Just create (or get from a friend) your custom IPSW and Option-Restore (Shift-Restore on Windows) to it via iTunes.  Donâ€™t enter DFU mode at all.  Please make sure you are restoring to the custom IPSW, not the stock one from Apple!  For best results, use the latest iTunes (9.0.1) â€” which includes a nice new application organizer.
