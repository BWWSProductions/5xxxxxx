Ghost Hunters - S05E17 - Fort Henry
Airdate 10/14/09

TAPS heads north to explore the most haunted place in Canada. Fort Henry served as a prison and 

execution site for hundreds of dangerous convicts. Over the years, employees and visitors have witnessed a 

number of strange, frightening events.

Built in 1812, Fort Henry served as a prisoner-of-war camp for captured Nazis during World War II. Today, 

the fort is a National Heritage Site and a memorial to Canadaâ€™s military history. Historical eyewitness 

accounts suggest that paranormal entities have long been haunting the fort.

Strange apparitions, mysterious sounds of shattering glass and other ghostly activities have been recorded in 

this great maze of a military complex. Could the restless spirits of dead prisoners be stirring trouble? TAPS 

investigates.
