,sjserio,2009-10-18T03:47Z,what is this torrent all about? is it Warnings at Waverly Academy???
,dark_justice1986,2009-10-29T15:26Z,Yeah but looks like it's in Russian.. Is there an english version anywhere?
,dark_justice1986,2009-10-29T15:29Z,"Well upon further research, it looks like it may be in English afterall.. I am going to download it and find out.. I will comment on whether it works and if it's english."
,dark_justice1986,2009-10-29T16:30Z,"Well the install, even though not in english at all, is indeed Waverly Academy. Setting up should be common knowledge, but so far, it is NOT a common installation process and it makes me feel like it's unsafe.. I installed it and I had to manually autorun it to the main screen, but I have clicked every single button and there is no option to play unless I am missing something.. I think it's better to look for an english version altogether."
