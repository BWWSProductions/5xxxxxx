,McLeech,2009-10-23T05:44Z,"I think Tech Rob is wearing a half assed pirate bay shirt in this movie.  It's a pirate ship for sure, but it might not be theee pirate ship."
,stemoss,2009-10-23T18:32Z,Cool movie!
,frightnite,2009-10-23T19:19Z,It's so simple even a leeching newbie can handle it. Use nero express and add files as data DVD and burn five sometimes six 700mb files on one disk. Aslong as your stand alond DVd player recognizes Divx it will play perfectly.Any questions Rory.mitchell@hotmail.com. No converting no shrinking easy as pie!!!

Movie: 7 its like one of the stright to DVD movies that are not to bad. well. yeah... it had alot of action for a mid budget movie. lot of gun play. I like it. was good enough for me. "
,idrone42,2009-10-25T23:41Z,"wow, that's the worst movie in months. that much stupid shit packed into one movie is rare. 

the retarded b-series stench in every scene is suffocating. this is how a movie looks like if you let britney spears make it. had to skip through to the end to get through it. the latest seagal movies are oscar-pieces in comparison. too bad though, the plot of an ""assassains tournament"" could have made for an awesome movie. 

if you saw this movie and liked it, congratulations. you are a magnificent retard. if you saw it and went ""it was ok"", you're just a little bit stupid. you probably thought ""doooh uhmm...er... she's hot, YEAH she should win! hmm what's that pop up window... I WON A MILLION? ME? OH MY GOD!"".

and win she did. the asian chick won the tournament, saved a priest and found jesus in the end like lassie the dog would. she had the Hot Slow-Motion Girl Power, which negates all other abilities of an assassain. this is a fact. hitler would have won world war II if he knew this. "
,SK3TCH78,2009-10-26T05:22Z,Already sounds like DOA! That's just one guys opinion tho thanx for the up can't wait to watch it!
,Widowlicker,2009-10-26T19:21Z,"Great action movie. A bit of a combination of former action movies, but acceptable.
Damn hot chick is Kelly Hu. Kelly who? Kelly HU. WHO? HUUUUUU !!!!!!!!! you English bastard.

Video 9 / audio 9 / movie 8

BTW: great job AiTB, thanks for this up."
,idrone42,2009-10-26T21:31Z,"widowlicker, you are a retard. i bet if someone smacked their cock on your forehead, you'd just smile and go ""yeahhh gabbagabba awesome action, AWESOME ACTION!!!"" lol"
,Teves123,2009-10-27T19:38Z,"@idrone42
Your a fucking retard.

I give this a 9/9!!"
,idrone42,2009-10-28T02:01Z,"lol teve i assume you're a ""female below 18"". according to imdb stats, that's the only group of people who liked this movie. action films promoting slow motion girl power always hits big with them lol."
,ltboogz,2009-10-28T06:06Z,cool action flick....kelly hu is tha shit
,king_nazz,2009-11-01T01:58Z,really good movie. great quality
,idrone42,2009-11-01T14:58Z,"lysergic: 
please stop using a name indicating that you have anything to do with LSD, while being a stupid little shit posing to sound clever. do you really think i give a shit about the statistics of that movie? you actually defend that piece of crap? you're so lobotomized by watching b-series spam on tv, you think that a hot asian model kicking the shit out of thirty professional killers is what is to be expected in real life. i wouldn't mind all that stupid shit if it had style and original action, but implying it does, would be like handing britney spears the fields metal of mathematics. there are so many retards like you out there ready to applaud anything, im sure they made lots of money anway. placing a hot asian in the lead role, was not the worst aspect of the movie, but considering the pile of unoriginal dried-up diarrhea that movie was, it works as the inevitable strawberry on top to amaze the drooling retards who pay for movies like this.

now, why don't you go clap your hands and watch peter pan or something, or if your parents allow it, cat woman. it's a documentary. "

,perryl,2009-11-13T07:54Z,"idrone, just because you disliked this movie does not mean you need to spoil it for others by posting the ending here, if AiTB can delete that comment he should, but thats just ignorant, and judging by your posts you have nothing better to do with your time then come back to the same movie over and over and talk shit to people about how much smarter you are because you disliked a perfectly good movie.
did it go straight to dvd? probably, would it have been worth seeing in theatres?? sure, its got lots of great action, mindless, but entertaining. and with every theatre offering a 2 dollar tuesday, or 4 dollar tuesday or half priced day or whatever, this movie could definatly have done decent in theatres. 
now i know you will come back with some comment about my father raping me or something stupid to that effect, your opinions have no value on TPB, i'm sure i speak for the majority when i say you should be banned for spamming torrents with mindless bullshit, trashtalk, and spoilers. i think every comment ive seen from you has been a complaint. 
mother didnt love you enough? father abused you?? no friends??? whatever your issue is, we dont need to deal with it. there is likely i psychiatrist in your neighborhood that will take the $$ you saved downloading this movie to talk to you about your issues. i have reported you to TPB and i would expect an account suspension soon. as ive checked into it and what your doing is against piratebays terms of service. 
Audio : 10 Video : 10 movie : 7.5 
this movie is worth the download if you like to see people die, like to see lots of action, like to see a girl that can kick ass, like to see ving rhames like he was in pulp fiction, and like to see explosions. i wont spoil this movie for anyone but i will say i enjoyed it. my gf wasnt all that interested but she did make it through it.

Humorous trolling aside: This movie REALLY DOES SUCK BIGTIME. It's unrealistic, predictable and utterly lame. Even the fight scenes suck. Download and give it to someone you hate!! Still THANKS AiTB FOR THE QUALITY UPLOAD!"
,Solon_Poledourus,2009-11-20T20:19Z,"idrone42: Don't be such an angry little troll. We get it, you didn't like the movie, now move on and get over it. There's no need for all the Britney Spears references and trash talk, let alone the fact that you spoiled the ending(let's face it, we ALL know that mid-grade action movies always have a happy ending for the hero(ine), but posting the ending on here is a dick move nonetheless). Just try to keep it civil and within the TOS."
,logintyas,2009-11-26T04:00Z,"idrone is an angry little basement dweller. yikes, hop outside today and get some sunshine. sure your mom is worried about you."
,7thSense,2009-11-27T08:02Z,"lot of idiots posting here. Keep your opinions to yourself and rate the movie, losers. Was a good one anyways so don't try to bring others down to your misery."
,Hycro,2009-11-29T21:40Z,"Fuck. The plain fact that you're all arguing over it makes every one of you complete morons. You're all bitching about this and that and why this movie fails or doesn't... are any of you legit media criticizers? I don't believe so. How about, if you don't like the movie, fuck off. If you DO like the movie, comment on how good it is.

I can't fathom how someone like you thinks, seriously get a life and stop sitting behind your computer nerd raging at people online, out of all this bickering.. you look the most idiotic by far, just thought i'd point that out so maybe you'd have a self-revelation or....

That's not necesarlly the case though. What you'd expect to see is a even distribution through the standard Gaussian bell curve, with the apex of the curve being centered on the most common response. "

Wasn't a bad film, I wouldn't watch it again. A/V Perfect for a 700MB rip. I would rate the movie at around   7 / 10"
