,RumiLove,2009-11-09T16:00Z,"I have been trying to download this torrent for 3 days, I have been at 60% for 15 hours forcing me to seed a torrent i do not even know i will get! There are no peers or seeders that are visible at 100% you only show peers up to 60% forcing me to seed. I will delete this shit, I always seed to a minimum of 100% but will not be forced to do so when i do not know if i will get this torrent or not! Thanks for wasting my time and bandwidth.  DON'T Download!!!"

I let you guys know if i get it. Download rate is not really good but not that bad either. going at 120kb/s for me."
