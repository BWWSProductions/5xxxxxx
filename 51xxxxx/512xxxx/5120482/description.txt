An extraordinary insight into the secretive world of the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Trouble In Amish Paradise tells the story of Ephraim and Jessie Stoltzfus who, along with their wives, have become disillusioned with the amount of control the church now exerts over their lives.

They are extremely proud of their Amish heritage and have no wish to leave their community, but feel they can no longer unquestioningly follow every pronouncement from the bishops.
Church And Culture Are Not The Same

As more and more Amish read the Bible in English, rather than the original German, some have begun to ask who they should be following â€“ the leaders, or the word of God. As Ephraim observes, â€œThey combine church and culture and thatâ€™s wrong, you cannot do that. 

If thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s supposed to be then Jesus would have made those rules specific and said â€˜You gotta drive a horse with a green harness or you to go hellâ€™. And he didnâ€™t say that.â€ Jesse and Ephraim, along with several other families in the community, gather regularly for bible study classes, which is strictly forbidden by the bishops.


These two radical Amish men, Ephraim and Jesse Stoltzfus, start to question some of the most fundamental aspects of their Amish culture, they face excommunication from their church and total rejection by their friends and family.
