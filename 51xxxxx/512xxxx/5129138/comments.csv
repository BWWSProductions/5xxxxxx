The keygen from DarkL0rd/AGAiN does work!

The keygen sucks because the key must be input with dashed which are not generated by the keygen:
7-7-7-7-5
Example:
xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxx


Leave the Keygen open!!!

After the starting of the program, you do a ""phone registration"" to use
the installation code:

no dashes. plug this into the key generator to get the activation code. 

as in:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The activation code should be:
4-4-4-4-4
as in:
xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
