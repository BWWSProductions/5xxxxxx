,SRH90,2009-12-25T22:21Z,"Works for me under Windows 7 (x64) with the v3.6.29.0 beta patch, WormKit + wkColorFix.dll, and a mounted ISO image of the game. 

Note: [Shift+Esc] to minimize and (also) rectify incorrect colour palette. If colours are still messy, create a batch file in the game directory with these contents and run it:

taskkill /f /IM explorer.exe
WormKit.exe
Start explorer.exe

My order of complete installation for full functionality:

1.) Install Worms Armageddon - New Edition
2.) Download and install v3.6.29.0 beta patch

ftp://ftp.team17.com/pub/t17/patches/pc/WA_update-3.6.29.0_Beta_Installer.exe

(Origin: http://wormsarmageddon.team17.com/main.html?page=supp&area=upda&file=15 )

3.) Download and install WormKit

http://worms.thecybershadow.net/wormkit/wormkit.zip

(Origin: http://worms.thecybershadow.net/wormkit/ )

4.) Download and extract wkColorFix.dll to the game directory

5.) Run WormKit.exe

Thanks for seeding; shame my CD snapped all those years ago. :("
,taco_roco,2010-01-30T22:29Z,"When I try to play the game, I'll get this triple vision. It's like the game's been pasted over itself multiple times. I can click on things but it's kinda hard to do anything when I'm having to deal with this BS.

This has happened to 2 different copies of WA, and even Worms World Party. I've downloaded the latest directX, and I can play things like UT2003 or Lord Of The Rings: BFME fine.

Help?!"
,chrisssj2,2010-02-05T16:48Z,"SRH90 newest patch doesn't work. The installer of this game is v3.6.28.0 

when I download v3.6.29.0  and install it, when I try to run it, it asks for cd, even with iso mounted.

When I download crack for v3.6.29.0  from gamecopyworld.com and use it, the game loads but will crash to desktop everytime the maps load...

Someone please help to get latest patch installed @ email/msn or here

,Thircase,2010-11-13T06:41Z,"If you update the game to e.g: v3.6.30.0 (2010.10.26), the game will search for a CD labeled as WA. So, relabel your CD/ISO with UltraISO. If you have done it well, the game should work, but now there will be another problem. 

WA will crash when you try to start a match. This happen because the game read some files from the CD to load. DATA folder to be more accurate.

Again, open your CD/ISO and put the ""DATA"" folder in the main root of the CD/ISO. (DATA folder is inside of the Install folder)

Now it should be F:\DATA\

If you don't want to do this, just use the original CD/ISO of Worms Armageddon or Worms World Party.

And that's it. To fix the other problems read SRH90 post. :)"
