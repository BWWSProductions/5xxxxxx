Notes:

This is DJ Legend's first and only CD Demo. DJ Legend was a side project of BVinyl (Bryce Crawford), a San Jose, CA born musician. The latter parts of his High School career were spent producing this 20-song CD set containing some of his best works during that time. The CD crosses into a variety of genre's including Hip Hop, Trip Hop, Electronica and New Age music. The versatility of the CD makes it a valuable asset to your music collection. DJ Legend's goal with this Demo CD was to attempt many different styles of music and taking from those styles the best sounds to create a certain mood. The track list reflects the differentiation in mood and genre in that the CD starts off with an electronically synthetic style and morphs into a more laid back Hip Hop influences style towards the end of the CD. A true gem, download this CD today!

More Notes:

BVinyl (DJ Legend's side project) can be found on MySpace at 
He has taken a much more Hip Hop oriented structure for his beats and continues making groove-inducing tunes. An instrumental CD is currently in the making.
