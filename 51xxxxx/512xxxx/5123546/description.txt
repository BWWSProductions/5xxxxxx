DC Comics V comic book series from 1985-1986, with stories set to be concurrent with the events of V: The TV Series which dealt with aliens known as "The Visitors" trying to gain control of Earth.

The editor of the comic reported at one point in the letter column that DC was working to acquire permission to continue the storyline of the television series should it not be renewed for a second season.  In the end, either such permission was denied or DC decided not to pursue the matter further.  While the cover of the 18th issue did state "Final Issue", and led to the events off the final television episode - it also left various plot threads from the comic series unresolved.
