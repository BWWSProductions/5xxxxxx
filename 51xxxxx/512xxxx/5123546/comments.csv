,ekinlerdizekadar,2009-10-17T01:34Z,i was huge fan of original V about 20 years ago. i used to resist my parents to watch it. in Turkey it used to air about 12 midnight so i always ended up not being able to sleep for hours. old memories

,HIyaalll,2010-05-08T18:09Z,Had all those that were released in sweden.. though many of them have gotten lost and damaged by time and usage.. So I hope someone is still seeding.
