"Deluxe Edition" includes a bonus CD entitled 'Cuttings' that features an additional five tracks.

"In This Light and On This Evening" is the third studio album from British band Editors. The band say the material will have a more raw and anthemic sound compared to their previous work.

Tom Smith explained the band's change in direction by saying: "If we'd tried to make another more traditional guitar record, I don't think we'd have got through it... for our own sanity, we had to do something we hadn't done before." He also revealed that the heavily synthesised and industrial feel of the album had evolved in a recording session that took place in 2008, before they settled on Flood as a producer. Bassist Russell Leetch said the experience of working with Flood had been "the most fun we've ever had in a studio" and hinted that the band would be likely to work with him again.
