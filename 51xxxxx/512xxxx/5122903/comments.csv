FYI regarding the title of track 5... Lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe stated that ""B********"" does not stand for ""Bastard"", but for ""Bückstabü"", a word made up by the band to mean whatever you want. Kruspe confirms this in the Metal Hammer podcast."
,Jong5466,2009-10-15T15:31Z,"According to a wikipedia article, this will not be released until October the 16th.

This torrent was posted three days before that, which makes me a bit curious.

How did you acquire it before it went out to the stores?"

Also: ahamilton, you must be a welfare child.  Nobody gets a free album in 320 kbps and then asks for more.  "
