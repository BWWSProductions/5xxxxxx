,ShineEyes,2009-10-17T09:29Z,"Yes it is but..

Fuck.  Be careful about playing this and Forza 3 online before release, guys.  Apparently for those games in particular MS is bringing down the banhammer.  Google it! I think I may be fucked...we shall see over the next couple days."
,Soulwaxer,2009-10-17T14:30Z,"Awesome share!
I'm kinda new to this. 
So if it says 'stealth: yes' I don't have to patch it with abgx?

And I won't be going online before the release date ;)

@beaver: If i'm not playing online the xbox date goes back to 2005, so they can't ban you for not updating your internal clock.."
,C3ntz,2009-10-17T16:40Z,I kno this says region free and all but it also says multi 5 i wuz wondering would it work on an ntsc console ?
,saada245,2009-10-17T19:38Z,OOOH SHIT IM FUCKED I PLAYED FORZA LIKE 2 DAYS AGO!!! NO BAN YET BUT WE WILL SEE!!
,ozke,2009-10-17T23:26Z,"To Soulwaxer:

You cant fully trust that its stealthed just cuz it says so...

To C3ntz:

Yes it will work on a NTSC console, Multi 5 means that its 5 different languages in the game"
,C3ntz,2009-10-18T00:58Z,"To ozke:

Thank you very much, I did know you multi 5 meant 5 languages but I've noticed that multi 5 doesn't seem to work on NTSC consoles..."

,ozke,2009-10-18T14:30Z,"To C3ntz:

Thats weird, it should work since its region free.

To ServerModerator:

Wait for it to be verified (all green) and then you are safe to go online."
,apdjavlar,2009-10-18T23:34Z,"But what if you play it offline now, get an achievement or two, then go live once the game is released?

- Does the achievements datestamp when you got them, or when you're connected to xbox live?"
,mikhail-k12r,2009-10-19T01:53Z,"Good advice here from ozke and ShineEyes.

Apdjavlar, what I suggest is playing completely offline and using a separate storage device that you NEVER, EVER connect to LIVE with until the particular .iso you're playing comes back completely green and verified with ABGX360. That's the safest way.

I am playing on an old 20gb hard drive that I only use for exactly this purpose. In a couple of days this rip will show up in the online verified db and we can all patch & reburn our discs."
,Dxonogard,2009-10-19T04:13Z,i need a modded 360 to play it right?
,xxademasoulxx,2009-10-19T04:46Z,whats the password for the archive
,haimon666,2009-10-19T07:28Z,"@ Dxonogard. 

Yes the dvd drive's firmware needs to be flashed with a hacked version to play copies. I'm not gonna tell you how to do it but you will be able to find out how if you search enough."
,xxademasoulxx,2009-10-19T10:11Z,ok seriously whats the fucken password
,ozke,2009-10-19T13:05Z,"To mikhail-k12r:

It dosent help that you play on your old HDD since it saves the information about the game on its internal memory"
,MQFPLO,2009-10-19T13:21Z,"To xxademasoulxx:

There are no passwords -.-"
,apdjavlar,2009-10-19T14:35Z,"Alright, thanks for all the info. I could be screwed, I've been playing offline for a bit. Let's just wait and see :)"
,bigndpants,2009-10-20T05:21Z,"raza78,

Redownload those parts again, and then decompress."
,justawhiteguy,2009-10-20T06:09Z,"Just a question, once this finished downloading, how do i get it on my Xbox? Do i burn it to a disk? Also, is there a way to make the file size smaller as the dvds i have only have a capacity of 5.52 GB"
,michan1234,2009-10-20T11:03Z,"@justawhiteguy

1) get ur xbox modded
2) buy verbatim DL (dual layer) DVD 8.5 GB
3) dl the FULL torrent, unzip the .iso and .dvd files into one folder
4) burn .dvd with imgburn"

I would never say a comment like this ( mainly cause i have downloaded like 40 games this year alone) but this game is one of a kind and if people torrent it there's less chance of a sequel. "
