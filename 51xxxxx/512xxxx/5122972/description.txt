Bullies don't have to be big, tough boys. In fact, often, they're not boys at all. Based on Rachel Simmons's best-selling book examining the culture of female aggression, this Lifetime original movie follows a put-upon middle schooler (Alexa Vega, of Spy Kids) who struggles to dodge blows from her backstabbing peers. The fact that the abuse is emotional and not physical doesn't make it any less painful.
