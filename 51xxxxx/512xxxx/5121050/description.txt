This is a re-seed of an earlier torrent, it now contains Theyr tracks in mp3-format, with the Niceland/Jaz Coleman Demos and some extra images.

"Album tracks from 80s new wave group Ãžeyr (pronouned "they" with a rolled "r" on the end). This group was active in the Icelandic scene between 1979-1983 and were known for their fierce sound, occult mystique and pranksterish humour, challenging the zeitgeist with ambivalent genius. Some have made reference to Killing Joke (who they supported) and Joy Division (who they imitated in their early works) but this group was more highly original, and as most believe, should have had worldwide exposure. They remind me more of The Beatles in their 1967 Sgt. Pepper period, having that secret musical/studio style they could call their own. For more information.....
