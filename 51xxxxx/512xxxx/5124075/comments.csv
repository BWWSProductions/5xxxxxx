,theshape31,2009-12-16T16:36Z,"Thank you very much for this release.

For English subs through VLC, download from the link sy1234 posted. Then change the name of the file to:
'Banlieue.13.Ultimatum.2009.720p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON.srt'.

Excellent quality video and audio, highly recommended."

But Thanx!"
,TERRAOperative,2012-03-22T10:55Z,"The link for the subtitles above is correct, however the extension on the file is wrong.
The subtitles are in MicroDVD format and as such the extension should be changed from .txt to .sub (why an obscure, obsolete sub format was abandoned 8 years prior to this movie being released was used is beyond me).

Aegissub can be used to open this file once renamed (set the framerate to 24fps when prompted) then export the file to a .srt sub file which you can then mux into a .mkv using mkvmerge (part of the MKVtoolnix suite). Just drag and drop the video and .srt sub file into the top window in mkvmerge, set the correct language etc options for each track shown in the second window, set your file name down the bottom, and hit 'start muxing'."
