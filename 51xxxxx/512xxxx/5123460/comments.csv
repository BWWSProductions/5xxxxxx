,FuckSholihin,2009-12-17T04:43Z,i think burn using slysoft program called cloneCD or cloneDVD. google slysoft to find about their products. it is also available via piratebay.

If you are looking for everything of ABBA, do not look any further, this is it. And I can tell, because I compared this one with some other sets that are out here.

To convert the FLAC files using the CUE sheets I am using XLD, which is probably the best for the Mac. Very fast decoding!!! Use it once to locate a cue file. Then the .cue files are recognized, so in the next album folder just double-click on these to open the cue sheet. Then drag the artwork in the left pane, which is usually called ""Sleeve1"" in the folder with the flac file.

You might want to select .mp3 in the XLD Preferences first an check the decode settings. Hope this helps for you Mac guys."

,penfold_3946,2010-01-17T08:23Z,"All the tracks in each album are in one encoded FLAC file, you can NOT listen to any individual track. Theres alot hardwork gone into this however its mad not having seperate tracks???"
,chris1108,2011-05-14T12:47Z,"Penfold, thanks for making that known!!! Why the hell would the tracks not be individually compressed? Yes, it does seem a lot of work has gone into this and it must be great audio quality, but how disappointing nonetheless! "
,telecandy,2011-08-25T20:25Z,"Should have read the comments before I downloaded. Great job, but I really want to be able to listen to the individual tracks! deleting!"
,fuxache,2011-09-01T08:36Z,"You could always use something like meieval cue splitter to split the albums into single tracks, it ain't rocket science and it's still free. Honestly can't see the problem in putting a little bit of effort into something free - you could get really indignant and actually pay for the music. Thanks uploader for your hard work from me anyway."
,hvom,2011-09-13T18:52Z,This is a bad remastering. The sound is very compressed. Look for non-remastered versions or 1992/1993 Gold.
,mojo01,2011-09-24T01:11Z,I don't like remasters...
