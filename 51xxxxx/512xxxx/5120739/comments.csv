- Patience is under the link provided:
beachbody.com-> 
Choose a product from the dropdown-> 
One on One with Tony Horton-> 
Scroll down to Patience ""Hummingbird""

- It's 3Gigs, because it's the full ISO.  I figured people can get the real deal (as the other DVDs in the series were originally provided on Demonoid), and do what they want with it.

- You're right - Axxo is great.

- Thanks for the input."

I'm really grateful that people take the time to upload the ISO images on here because it preserves the quality of the actual product.

ISO dl's only take overnight and it's easy to burn onto discs anyway.  

If we had avi's all the time, the quality of the images would seriously suck and we wouldn't be able to play it on my television set (health nuts like us would have to squint at our laptop screens and grovel when we'd have to pause to catch our breaths)

MY POINT: if you don't like the avi's just keep to yourself, dl the file, convert it, and then reupload.  ...no need to crit j-crack on something so trivial.  It's good j-crack posted the ISO's so we can do what we want with it."
,j-crack,2009-10-15T21:31Z,"Just a note - I'll be seeding until I get to 10:1, then I'll be giving my internet connection a break for a while.  
I'm around 7:1 at the moment, and plenty of people have 100%, so I just thought I'd let the d/l-ers know that they should seed, too.

Also, thanks for the feedback.  Cheers!"
,ffaizi001,2009-12-02T23:10Z,Hey....do we've the next disks (#4 and 5)available here ?
,MvdGT,2009-12-12T14:42Z,"Please upload disks 4, 5 and 6 in .iso format if you have them. Thanks."
,Jfave,2010-09-20T12:40Z,Thanks for the upload! Any chance of uploading the others in full iso? TIA.
