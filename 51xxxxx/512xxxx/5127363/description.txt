Plot:
Tanom is a Thai's competent goalkeeper who is going to join his football team to the World Cup. While competing against Saudi Arabia during the playoff game, his head accidentally hits the goal pole. He's dead. But, his body is possessed by the spirit of Sa-ngem, a transsexual whose own body is burnt after committing suicide. Hell allows Sa-ngem to temporarily habit in Tanom's body, and sends Dung-Ding, the Reaper to control and watch Sa-ngem, especially to urge him to fulfill the great hope of Thai people; bringing the football team to the World Cup's finale.
