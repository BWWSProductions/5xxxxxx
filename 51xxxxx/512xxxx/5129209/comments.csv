,moshster,2009-10-19T19:41Z,"hi, could anyone confirm the running time of this rip plz?"
,Cinema09,2009-10-19T21:40Z,"look dude we 3 people whant transformers 2

so please try to upload this movie I know you said I cant but try to uploadthis movie"
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-19T22:48Z,I have a look dude for you i put out whatever the fuck i want to.This isnt a democracy you want the movie convert it and upload it yourself.Seeing that i am pretty much the main uploader of these torrents and there a few others that post it will stay thesame way it is now MY CHOICE. Start contributing to the cause by uploading not whining.
,frenchyd252,2009-10-19T23:13Z,"Cinema09 u really are a prick, ive seen u post on several torrents now and all you do is moan, stop complaining, this stuff is 4 free and people upload it in there spare time for nothing no one has to do it. learn how to encode yourself if u want it that bad. Ive already uploaded transformers 2 for ps3 and the quality is good click on my name if u want it. "
,Cinema09,2009-10-19T23:41Z,thanks dude I appreciate it and of course you are the main uploader in this site and no one can crack you down I mean you upload full hd movies exampe 1920x1080 and 5.1 audio so thats why I like your torents bro now there are very small amount of uploaders that do full hd movies and I dont download their torents so much  so thats why I keep complanig about transformers 2 and I dont trust anyone of doing  1080p movies and frenchyd252  why get angry man I just told you that I dont like your torent of transformers cause the loss of quality I whant a crystal 1080p movie not a loss of quality man so just cill out man 
,moshster,2009-10-20T02:58Z,@Cinema09 - if you want crystal 1080p picture then you need the Bluray orignal preferably viewed on a Bluray player and HD display with 36bit color support.  Otherwise be grateful dude for the freebies.
,steadygettingblown,2009-10-20T07:02Z,Brick your the shit bro fuck the haters keep up the great work!!!!!!!!!!!
[T],Akamaru-,2009-10-20T08:27Z,"lol, pimps up hoes down!

Hey Brick, what do you think of that HDME.eu place. No multi tracking... that is some bullshit huh.

on another note, i have been encoding other movies, but have not had the chance to upload them cause i would prefer to have to do on demonoid and just add tracker to it. 

my apologies for the failed batman returns torrent, but the original batman should be up.

@ steadygettingblown, hey bro i have FRiday for ya i'll try to upload it asap"
,mattbitey,2009-10-20T08:40Z,BRICKTOP IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
,halfmonkey,2009-10-20T09:24Z,"To PS3-TEAM - Hi, I know we've had the comment off Cinema09, but I have a polite request as I have a PC with no blu-ray drive so can't rip my own PS3 compatible files......Is there any possibility we could have some other documentary type rips. I have The BBC's Planet Earth on blu-ray and it is breathtaking. Also The BBC's Ganges is spectacular. Finally the upcoming BBC series ""Life"" which is out in the UK at the end of November is awesome - currently showing on BBC terrestrial TV - It has close ups in high def....never seen anything of that quality before....Thanks PS3-TEAM!"

,patrick91g,2009-10-20T11:15Z,and sorry for my bad english
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-20T13:53Z,hey akamaru the no multy tracker sucks on that site but it does give more access to mkv that can be converted.
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-21T13:59Z,yea i also belong to iptorrent and hdme.eu sites and they both have all the new 1080p movies before others do 
,akki12321,2009-10-21T19:47Z,"Hi Bricktop, let me first thank you for your enormous contribution!  You and the PS3-TEAM have done an excellent job!  I know this may have been asked before but I'm at a stage where I have the m2ts file at 13gb or so and needs to be compressed to 4gb, can you tell me what is the best way of going about this?  Cheers, once again for all your hard work."
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-22T15:24Z,i use ripbot264 to encode my movies try that it should d the job for you just google it.ripbot i a freeware
,akki12321,2009-10-25T12:44Z,"Hello again and thanks for your help bricktop and zax808, I tried to use ripbot to downsize my 13gb m2ts file, but it freezes at demuxing 50%.  This happens just initially - when the file is being read - before I even start the conversion. I appreciate all help, cheers."
,daesonn,2009-11-09T08:11Z,"i don't comment often, but i appreciate what you do for the community, keep it comming. There are lots of us who are silent, but very much appreciate your work. Upload what you will, disregard the assholes that think you owe them a favor. Thanks again."
,korntacular,2009-11-17T03:18Z,call me a noob but this will play on my computer in 1080p to right?
,SonOFBaldr,2009-11-19T02:08Z,"Someone help me please. I downloaded this and tried to watch it on my VLC which works well usually, but this movie as all pixelated unwatchable...can it be fixed or do I need to start all over with a new torrent download? I been waiting for 33 hours for this one and hope it can be fixed somehow..thank you in advance for your time,
SonofBaldr"
,mikeydangerous,2009-11-20T07:44Z,Inglorious Basterds and UP! please!
,kithylin,2009-11-22T01:43Z,"I'm not sure what resolution you've formatted this in but it will not fit natively into 1920x1080 on a PC using either VLC or media player classic.

Black bars around the top and bottom and can't get it to fill the screen, it's NOT native 1920x1080 what so ever!

I dunno if it'll work on a Ps3 or whatever.. can't watch this on PC though :("
,kithylin,2009-11-22T01:47Z,"Nevermind, after 5 minutes fiddling with media player classic got it to fit finally, shouldn't have to bother with any of this if it was correct from the start though.. oh well."
,Kona_,2009-11-22T23:12Z,I FUKKEN LOVE HD STUFF
,twodayoldme,2009-11-28T15:52Z,Fantastic quality.  My WD Media player (awesome toy) plays the M2TS file perfectly with surround sound!  Thanks for the upload.
,bobbyc36,2009-12-03T07:59Z,is anybody else having a problem where the movie doesnt complete its d/l. im using azareus and the movie finishes then goes back to 99.8% and starts to try to finish d/l. all other movies from brick d/l fine. i wonder why this one is doing that? btw excellent quality. amzaing you can get this quality on a dvd 
,mrcjoker,2009-12-09T05:50Z,"If you have a western digital player, update to the latest firmware and it plays .m2ts files"
,SpocktheVulcan,2009-12-18T00:45Z,hi is there a certain way you are supposed to watch this on your ps3? i was thinking i would just put it on to vuze media server or playon media server... should i be doing it another way?
,Delk77,2009-12-20T06:24Z,"I cant play this on my PS3... I have firmware version higher than 3 and it doesnt show up.  I store all my movies on external HD and my ps3 see all the other file when I browse videos>folder>M:>Movies through my ps3, but it doesn't see the PS3 movie....  Any ideas?"
,lucuher,2009-12-31T12:04Z,"pretty good, but slightly overcompressed to make it fit for the ps3 as its a bit noisy, so I ll still go for the blu-ray. Someone really tell the Sony guys to adopt ntfs... "
,hectorc01,2010-01-01T20:30Z,"Hi all quick question, i have a bog standard lap top no blue ray on it etc so whats the easiest way for me to watch this movie on me ps3 once downloaded?? thanks"

of course it won't be full screen because it was filmed in 2.35:1 ratio, 1920x1080 is approx 1.75:1 ratio."
,PsYkOtikz,2010-01-07T05:59Z,"hey brick i know you get a ton of requests and i love your effort/movie choices, always amazing quality!  is there anyway you can get cruel intentions and forgetting sarah marshall on this bad boy?"
,aloy1455,2010-01-16T18:51Z,"Very great upload. But I have a question if it isn't too much to ask. I was just wonder how you guys are able to do this. I know that it's a weird question, but I have tried many different things such as using mkv2vob. That didn't do much because the file size is still really big. But you guys get it down to 4GB without quality loss of the 1080p. It would be really nice if you shared your secret. If not then that is okay because I know people these days don't really want others making things out of their ideas. All I want is to know how because I have a ps3, and I want to convert it to .m2ts just as you guys have done but still keep the file size to 4GB and without quality loss. I have several .mkv movies that I would like to try your method on. If you cannot give me an answer to this then that is okay because all of my questions are for me and no one else to know and it is only for my purposes. Please and thank you :D"
,ultaman1,2010-01-21T20:54Z,"I felt the quality its like 720p upscaled to 1080p.. is it?..

Thanks for the upload anyways :)"
,DGray978,2010-02-25T12:33Z,"Hey bricktophd,

Is there a way that you can rip the movie with subtitles hardcoded? Your work is great, I was just wondering if that is possble.

Thanks"
,cclloyd,2010-03-14T17:12Z,"Great quality.

Lags a bit when you play through VLC, but thats because i have only 768p resolution, and not that much GFX mem.

Windows media player and WMC played it fine though at full quality."
,cclloyd,2010-03-14T17:13Z,"o and if you rly want to see this in its best...

watch it through a USB on a Samsung LED TV.  You will be amazed."
,Bunnes1105,2010-03-17T17:03Z,very good one thx a lot =) could I just ask with which program the ps3-team is ripping the movies to get this size and the format m2ts??? thx ;) 
,timboo21,2010-05-13T10:43Z,please seed people! Bin stuk on 97% for dayz.!
,cclloyd,2010-05-14T22:01Z,"Why is it that when I convert any of the PS3 Team videos from this to .mp4 H264 4000kpbs, the video lags on playback through samsung LED TV?"
,Monten,2010-05-26T10:10Z,Seeding @5MB/s for a couple days. Enjoy the love.
,_4_,2010-05-28T06:41Z,"I have the DVD of this movie because i love it. Though I got this new monitor and im interested how itll look on bluray.

not too many seeders right now though"
,patrioticparadox,2010-06-14T09:56Z,"cclloyd its because as you said, you have low video memory. stuttering is caused when a movie/app needs a frame quicker than your hardware can load it; it has nothing to do with the particular TV you are using. Your GFX card simply cant load enough frames to fill the buffer before the video playback requests them; whether it is is caused by not enough video memory or not a fast enough GFX card thats probably the reason"
,KLATUBARADANIKTO,2010-08-01T19:03Z,"A Sample would be awesome. Since this movie has a lot of black images, I cant afford to download it without making sure that the bitrate is good enough. So I want to tell people to go and download a 13 Gb version."

,SalivaArt,2012-04-10T19:16Z,"Playback on ##-X-Box-360-## releases do work if you're running windows 7 and streaming on the network through windows media center.



This is FALSE on all these releases. i have tested myself with windows 7 and xbox 360 with the latest updates. Streaming this over windows media center DOES NOT work. all the fasm releases do however... very frustrating. you shouldn't tell me something will work when it does not. "
