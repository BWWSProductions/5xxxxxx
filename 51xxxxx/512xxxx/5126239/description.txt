Three years after the events of the Battle Royale, the 2 survivors Nanahara and Nakagawa form the 'Wild Seven' in opposition of the BR Act and the Government. In response, the Government sends a class of junior-high students to catch and kill Nanahara in 3 days. These students are divided into pairs and trapped in an isolated island whilst being forced to wear those deadly electronic necklaces. In a new twist, when one student is murdered, the partner's electronic necklace will be activated resulting in instant death. Let the games begin!
