Healing, Miracles, & Alternate Universes

Naturopathic physician and pioneer in revolutionary healing techniques, Dr. Richard Bartlett discussed how miracles are possible, and their relationship to quantum physics and alternate universes. In 2007, he said he had a vision which showed him an energetic blockage in one of his patients. This event altered the way he looked at reality. Everyone he touched experienced some type of effect just from his contact, he detailed, and these interactions he later came to call Matrix Energetics.

Quantum physics offers a possible explanation as to how his healing abilities were occurring. We're beings of light, but the problem is most people see themselves as matter, due to their perceptual biases, he said. Seeing oneself as matter creates a closed system that doesn't allow for miracles, he added. "I think that miracles come from a hyperdimensional reality structure...when we set up...an adequate morphic field or quantum potential they can bleed over into our physical reality and we see things like cancers disappearing."

Angels are what Tom Bearden has called "virtual beings" that exist in the vaccuum or zero point field and can traverse from higher dimensions into physical reality when called or activated by human consciousness, said Bartlett. The idea of infinite potential suggests that different or alternate universes are created in which every possible outcome is played out. By tapping into altered states of awareness, we can track alternate potentialities and blur the boundaries of these universes, he suggested. This could explain how tumors vanish, and paranormal activities and sightings occur, he noted.

Freakiest Ghost Photos

In the last hour, paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren talked about some of the freakiest ghost photos ever taken. The Worley House photo (see below) shows an apparition whose hairline matches that of a photo of a boy who died in the house, he said. Warren finds the photo of the 'Newby Phantom' (England 1963) to be particularly haunting. It features a Grim Reaper-like figure that looks to be between 7 and 8 feet tall. He said the photograph was examined by the British Observatory, and they found no evidence of a hoax.
