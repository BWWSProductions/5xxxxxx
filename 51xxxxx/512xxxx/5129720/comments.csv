,DryGoatAir,2009-10-20T00:53Z,I thank you kindly! I hope this one actually is the full episode. I downloaded the DVSKY release but it was only the first 12 minutes of the show.
,DePo316,2009-10-20T01:28Z,"No this is ALL 23:31 of it. I was on the west coast and saw that double first half BS that cartoon network pulled. This was ripped from the adult swim site, it had the episode but into 4 parts, which i put together for all of you to enjoy. "
,kasotarat,2009-10-20T01:32Z,off topic here but what program would you use to rip video from websites ? ive used hycam2 but im not impressed.  thanks for your time and effort.

,DePo316,2009-10-20T02:11Z,"@kasotarat
I have realplayer, and apparently one if its' features is to allow you to download most all videos you come across on the internet. "

,bolddog,2009-10-20T12:42Z,"audio is kinda low, great work otherwise"
,illusionfive,2009-10-21T08:48Z,"@brocksamsonkiller -> 
what program and what format did you convert to so it will play on Xbox 360?  

I burned to disk and it wouldn't play on divx dvd player either (just got sound).  Not a slag to the uploader, just not sure how to watch on tv.

Thanks"
,kasotarat,2009-10-21T12:01Z,"thanks for the answer DePo316 
i have never givin realplayer any thought.
huh.....what do you know? (0_o)"
,DePo316,2009-11-02T10:02Z,"I don't use realplayer for music or anything, but the downloader and the converter are pretty decent"
