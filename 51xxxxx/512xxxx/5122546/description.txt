released in 1981.. this would be by far the most sucsessful J. Geils Band Album
Yeilding the massive worldwide smash hit Centerfold which went No.1 around the globe
and followed by the lead track Freeze Frame which was also highly sought after. even though many critics stated that it's B Side Flamethrower should of been the A Side
and that was topped off by the melodic Angle In Blue also a hit single..
This album does not contain one bad track.. Sadly it was also the bands last Album with front man Peter Wolf in the studio. 
Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
