"Nasty" is the second single from Janet Jackson's third studio album, Control (1986). Released in 1986, the single peaked at number three on Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and remains one of Jackson's signature songs. Paula Abdul choreographed the music video and appeared in it as well as one of Jackson's friends. The line "My first name ain't baby, it's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty" became a national catchphrase. The song won Favorite Soul/R&B Single at the 1987 American Music Awards. It ranked 30 on VH1's 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years and forty-five on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s and raked 79 on Rolling Stone 100 Greatest Pop Songs.
