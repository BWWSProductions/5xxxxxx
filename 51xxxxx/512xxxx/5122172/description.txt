Pre release single of Marsupial's music  distributled by Marsupial. on their various short midwest tours with Jucifer, Deicide, Necrophagist, Dying Fetus, Veil of Maya, A Life Once Lost, Guluch, The Evolution of Pain, Sepultura, Malevolent Creation, Hellknight, Inbryo, The Revenants, The Terrible Airplane, Black Gasoline, Sanctus Infernum, Manilla Road, Dead Commuter, Nursing Home Panty Raid, Contact, JACK, ORANGE 9MM, Jungle Rot, Desolation and others. 

Marsupial. is a difficult band to classify. If I had to put them on a tour I would likely select Gojira, Devin Townsend Band, and "River Runs Red" Life of Agony. Though, a n00b might compare them to Pantera, Fear Factory, or Machine Head. Some moments are somewhat black metal and sound almost like SHINING.
