Lenin Vivo (1970)
Joaquin Jorda


One of two movies that remain from the period of militant orthodoxy associated with Joaquim JordÃ â€™s time in Italy.

Lenin vivo, the official film that celebrates his birthday centennial, was the beginning and the end of the collaboration between the PCI and Joaquim JordÃ .

A didactic tendency prevails in some of his first films, for example in Portugal a Calm Country (Portogallo, paese tranquillo) (1969), which was shot in a clandestine way, and in LENIN IS ALIVE (Lenin vivo) (1970), both of which were made by request of the Italian Communist party and both of which are rigorous in their ideological perspective. They succeed cinematically because of their skilful editing, which suggests rather than imposes his point of view. In general, the themes of rebellion and injustice have always excited JordÃ 's interest; in 1971 he adapted The Iron Heel (TalÃ³n de hierro) by Jack London .
