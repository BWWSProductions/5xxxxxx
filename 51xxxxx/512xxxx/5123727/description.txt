If you downloaded one of my torrents recently on Windows 7 RTM, they might have a watermark in the bottom right.  If you want that gone this is a small portable utility curtosy of askvg.com that removes it.

Torrents that might be affected:

Its simple just run it with admin rights, reboot, and its gone.  Can easily be undone by re-running the program.
