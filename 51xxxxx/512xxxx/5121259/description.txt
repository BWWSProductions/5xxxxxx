Itâ€™s Halloween night, and slacker video clerk Stan Helsing  along with his insanely sexy ex-girlfriend, best buddy and an exotic dancer/massage therapistâ€™ (Desi Lydic) detours into a town cursed by the biggest monsters in movie history: Freddy (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), Jason (FRIDAY THE 13TH), Pinhead (HELLRAISER), Leatherface (THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), Chucky (CHILDS PLAY), & Michael Myers (HALLOWEEN). But when Stan discovers that hes a direct descendant of the legendary monster hunter Van Helsing, the four will have to survive a night of hell raisers, hockey masks, psycho dolls, pleather faces, creepy hitchhikers, vampire strippers, killer karaoke, and lots of hot chicks kissing each other. The one and only Leslie Nielsen of AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN co-stars in this hysterical horror spoof written and directed by one of the guys who brought you SCARY MOVIE.
