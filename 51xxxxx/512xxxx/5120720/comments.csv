,uyan88,2009-10-12T19:50Z,"Sorry for the stupid question, but what can I do with a FINAL, RETAIL copy, without a original serial ?? And how would someone lost the DVD so soon =P...maybe one year later...anyway...I just wonder, since I am looking so much people downloading and I am sure they did NOT lost their dvd...and DONOT have a serial.  thanks for it, anyway xD"
,chillaxr,2009-10-12T20:09Z,"uran88:  I uploaded it early so it can spread a bit.  I want people not to have to look if they do loose the DVD.  

This is the english version, BTW.  "
,chillaxr,2009-10-12T20:34Z,Would you guys like the x64 version of this too?  Let me know.  
,ahhzz,2009-10-12T22:29Z,"Yes Pls Chill :) To my understanding, the 32-bit key works on the 64-bit OS, and I would like to have the 64-bit to work with as well. I'll watch here :)"
,chillaxr,2009-10-13T06:49Z,ahhzz:  You are correct about the serial numbers.  I also put the link to the 64 bit version in the info section of this torrent.  
,sandipraja,2009-10-13T08:28Z,It is the beta copy only! Freely Distributed by Microsoft for testing purpose only. Will stop functioning by the end of may 2010. You can get serial from microsoft site or helpline itself.  
,chillaxr,2009-10-13T09:14Z,"Sandipraja: This .iso is not.  This is the REAL, FINAL copy.  Download before your put false comments up, please.  "
,ahhzz,2009-10-13T10:11Z,"Thx Chill. Hope you'll be back in later, no seeds there now :(  Appreciate the up !"
,peluchita74,2009-10-14T14:15Z,So this is RTM not retail?
,scotthenderson,2009-10-14T16:10Z,Is there anybody downloaded and installed this one? What's the experiences?
,Robertman20,2009-10-14T23:18Z,"This is the real final version, only problem is that it's useless if you don't have your own product key. but otherwise yes this is the retail version and i'm using it right now. Working perfectly. Thanks Chillaxr!!"
,ozzy214,2009-10-15T12:44Z,"I dont think so Verne. Checked the hash and comes back nothing more than the supposed rtm build. Version number is 7600.16385. There is a lot of debate if this is retail or not. I would say no, until officially acknowleged by Microshit. Although this build does seems to run alright."
,peluchita74,2009-10-16T01:12Z,Can anyone who has installed this run everest and go to operating system and look if it says RTM or Retail? All of the supposed Retail versions i have downloaded so far are all RTM. 
,DPencil,2009-10-17T11:09Z,I respect the effort you took to upload this torrent (both x86 and x64 version) but Everest reports version number win7_rtm.090713-1255. So I'm afraid it's not the real deal yet.
,edog2o8,2009-10-19T23:41Z,"This is  Real  its  the OEM Retail  I know  because I  am  using it  right   now  and  it  does not  say  beta or anything  like that it  says on the  key OEM 
and no  try period   on  it  i got  a key one  of  the master  keys "
,Zakafein,2009-10-24T12:11Z,is there a tiral period?
,cclloyd,2009-10-24T19:49Z,Will verify if this is an official ISO.
,arata75,2009-10-25T08:10Z,"x32? Don't you mean x86 or 32bit? I could be wrong, but I don't think there is an x32 (or if there is then it's probably outdated or something).

Anyway, I hope this works."
,n1ng4,2009-10-26T05:22Z,By the way this is the Ultimate version. It works for me =).
,chard0919,2009-10-31T06:27Z,cant u spare a worrking key?whats the use of downloading your precious torrent if people cant use it with out a key?dont give us that if they lost their copy crop thing....so funny!!!you r on TPB so share in complete not in installment basis man!!!use your IQ for crying out loud!!!
,mammu,2009-11-04T07:45Z,can I use available cracks on this windows 7? will it then be working fine without serial?
,rizaud0,2009-11-07T15:12Z,I hope this will be in original form. i am trying to download it. after that i will post comments on that in deep. Good and thanks for uploading such a demanding window. my average download speed is upto 60kbps. how can i increase download speed.
,batchz,2009-11-29T14:43Z,where do i find my product key
,vins08,2009-12-02T10:33Z,"Everyone who needs a key email me:

ipodmanager99sheep@gmail.com"
,jaywyatt,2010-02-18T01:53Z,Do you know if you can upgrade from xp pro to win 7? thanks!
,Mrsukurac,2010-07-29T15:23Z,"This is a untouched Microsoft version indeed!
I downloaded this ISO, checked it with the ""Hash"", and it's all good!

The only problem now is the KEY!! :)
Can this version be activated with the WIN7 activator, or do I need a key?
I will try, yes... :)
And somebody can post a link to some valid keys, I will not mind... ;)   "
