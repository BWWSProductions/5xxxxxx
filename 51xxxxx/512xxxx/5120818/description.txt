       Guitar Hero is back and you get to rock with the ultimate party
       band, Van Halen! Experience the hot licks and scissor kicks that
       made Van Halen the legends they are today. 25 epic Van Halen tracks,
       three scorching Eddie Van Halen signature solos, and 19 guest acts
       give fans the most comprehensive arena rock set list to date.

       With over 80 million albums sold worldwide, Van Halen is one of the
       most influential rock bands of all time. Led by Eddie Van Halen's
       revolutionary guitar playing and David Lee Roth's unique brand of
       showmanship, the band has cemented their place in the Rock 'N Roll
       Hall of Fame since they dropped their self-titled album in 1978. Van
       Halen is one of only five rock bands that have had two albums sell
       more than 10 million copies in the United States.
