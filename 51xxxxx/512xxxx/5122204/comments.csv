Transfer speed did not increase, but Mozilla seems faster now."
,slitoke,2009-10-13T18:54Z,"Speed hasn't increased...but instead decreased! tried both recommended and manual configurations between restarts and saw no improvements, just a decreased rate of 10kbps on dling a file...maybe its best for dial-up?"
,pegapalo,2009-10-13T19:10Z,"I have verizon fios with a 20mbps download and 10 upload,, does anyone knows if this makes it faster??"
[T],jmb2012,2009-10-13T23:51Z,"Have you guys rebooted after optimizing?
I have a crappy connection (up to 5 mb) 
Before I was at about 2.7mb/s after I hit closer to 3.7mb/s. It worked for me."
,sildaxxzz,2009-10-31T03:41Z,"hi,thanks for the program,can you help me whit installation please"

Alot of people are not quite understanding this program and how to use and get the best out of it.
 This program is an optimizer, and what it will do is just that, it will optimize your current internet settings. (if you havent played around with them already).
So in theory you should recieve a slight increase in browsing speed, page's may open slightly quicker. 
 BUT what it will NOT do, is change your internet speed, like some people have claimed, from i.e 4mb d/l, 65kB/s u/l, to say 10mb d/l and 2mb u/l.
 If this program is still for you, to stand the best chance of finding out if you have made a slight improvement, what you need to do is take 5 readings in a row (using maybe  SpeedGuide.net) and add the speeds up and divide by 5 to get the mean score. 
 Do this 3 times in a day,morning,evening or night, to get the best chance of an accurate reading.
From personal experiance of this program, using it on a virgin machine, it DID make a slight improvement. But if you really want your machine to run faster there are a hundred differnt options depending on your o/s to do first."
,ko11ider,2009-12-03T18:03Z,Will this work on Windows 7....???????
,theroofer,2010-07-30T22:51Z,"cheers mate nice upload
keep up the good work"

""Thanks!""  

Folks, this app works.  And it works well on Win7.  I have used it for quite a few months and it has dramatically improved my DL speed.  Big increase.

I tried other SpeedConnect torrents that did not work.  This one does function properly."
,dave1998,2010-10-13T06:04Z,This one works. Good software to tune up your computer/modem internet settings.

Not much of a difference.  and idk how much i actually like speedtest.net bc if you select one server, it can say 6 Mb/s more or less than another, so idk"
,light420,2011-04-11T07:59Z,"Significant Increase
