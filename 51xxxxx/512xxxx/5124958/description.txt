After having released three stunning full-length albums and a split-EP between the years 1995 â€“ 1999, Ulmeâ€™s existence seemed to cease with a stroke of a fist, leaving their followers in a state of disbelief, anger and phantom limb pain, right after the release party for their third offering â€œGreen growing soulâ€¦ in the gala of loveâ€.

What fascinated their fans, who stemmed from Noise-Rock and partially from the Metal-scene was the juggernaut of their ever hypnotic, rolling groove â€“ the spirit of the seventies combined with the sheer heaviness of the nineties, the painful, longing vocals and the outbreaks of bestial wrath that were second to none. When Arne Heesch started to shout he must have seen red â€“ these moments of flaming anger had a very cathartic quality. Hard to say if it worked for him, but it sure enough presented a reverse - primal scream therapy for the listener. And then â€“ boom â€“ a fight among the band members, who by the way were two brothers and a cousin and that was it. The end.

Now, after about six years of total silence between the brothers thereâ€™s this EP with the long, foreboding shadows of an old tree on its cover in the mailâ€¦ It may sound pathetic, but simply looking at the cover can cause a certain stimulation in those, who knew Ulme from back in the day â€“ euphoria and also a good amount of anxiety: What will the reformed brothers plus new bassist give us? Do we still need it? Will it be the same as it used to be? If not, will we like the difference? Well long story cut short: They havenâ€™t changed much; the four songs sound like the logical consequences of â€œGreen growing soulâ€¦â€ A little easier to access, thanks to the powerful yet transparent production of Guido Lucas and thanks to clearer structures and melody. A glimpse of optimism unheard of so far in Ulmeâ€™s universe in the opener â€œThe glowingâ€ adds up to a song, that almost spans all of the bandâ€™s music: The intensity, the epic flowâ€¦ â€œUngrounded beautiesâ€ takes us back home to the dark groove andâ€¦ here come the goose pimplesâ€¦ here comes that howl. The beast is back and weâ€™re more than willing to welcome it!
