,Uruner,2009-10-18T08:36Z,"In 50 years everyone will speak chinese/japanese :P...

Your language is the EASIEST on the world, and you had a lot of colonies so it's no wonder that so many people speak it... Either way YOU suck and you will suck even more becouse the lowest / the poorest scum looking for easy money is just crowding near you degenerating average intellectual level of people in your country
