Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

10/13/09 Rundown: Ant out, Football, Twitter War, Bobo Tweets, 
Naked Gym Stories, Bernie Madoff, Biker Gangs, Tyson on Oprah, 
Morning Mash-Up, Jocktober, Penis Talk, Mick Foley and John Shaw 
in-studio.



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
