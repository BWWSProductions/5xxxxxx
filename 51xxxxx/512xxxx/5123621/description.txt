Brother From Another Planet (Sayles, 1984)-aNaRCHo


The brother is an alien who has crash landed on Earth. In the middle of a pitch black New York night, a terrified space pilot (Joe Morton) is forced to ditch his rickety-looking UFO in the Hudson River. The stranded alien chambers ashore, badly injured. He has some powers that may come in handy on this strange new planet, he can heal physical wounds with the glowing touch of his hands, and when he seeks refuge in the abandoned immigration center on Ellis Island his heightended senses pick up sound traces from the many immigrants who were warehoused there in the past, sounds that seem to be embedded in the walls. Enter two additional visitors from Somewhere Else. Armed with a set of mugshots and an ESL textbook, these ungainly men in black (John Sayles & David Straithairn) claim to be hunting an "illegal alien". 


"...a true cosmic joke, a sly saintly fable about a black slave from outer space who lands in the most ironic promised land of all- Harlem....This odd gentle soul's healing power, rooted more in his lust for life than in any interplanetary slight-of-hand, gives Brother From Another Planet a very earthly glow of warmth and redemption."
