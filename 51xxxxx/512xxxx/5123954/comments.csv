I am finding the audio is going out of sync multiples times.  Not the entire episodes but usually the last 10 minutes or so of each episode.  I use Boxee to view or my episodes and I also have the latest codecs from DivX.  Just wondering if it's my PC or if others are experiencing the same issues.  Thanks."
