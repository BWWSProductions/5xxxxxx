v2 Notes:
- After some feedback, I recooked the PDF's with the page lengths 4x longer (to further reduce the number of page flips).
- Added "End of Page #" footers. 
- Embedded outlines for all books by chapter. I also took some time and created a structured outline for the guide that should make it easier to jump to specific topics.

Notes:
I converted some eBooks I found of these terrific novels into PDF's with sizes that are friendly for reading on my PSP. The width of the pages is reduced so no horizontal scrolling is necessary at a comfortable zoom, and the length of pages is increased so you don't have to flip pages every 20seconds.


I've been using Bookr (Bookr-Mod 2009-07-09) to read these, available here:

This version has spiffy embedded outline/bookmark support, and some performance tweaks over the older builds. I've tested in Bookr v8.1, and besides slightly laggy panning, it works just fine.



I TAKE NO CREDIT for scanning and/or formatting text of these eBooks. I only took already existing eBooks and converted them (I saw a torrent uploaded by Spanko here at TPB that looks like the source I used, but I found mine at a random RS link so I can't be sure).
