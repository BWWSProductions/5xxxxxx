"Songs and Dances from latin America" - Volume B

(Sheet music for guitar duo in PDF format)


This is the 2nd of 6 volumes all written for guitar duo. I'll soon upload the remaining volumes, one by one.

I don't have the audio part that comes with the books. If anyone has it, please upload it and let me know.
