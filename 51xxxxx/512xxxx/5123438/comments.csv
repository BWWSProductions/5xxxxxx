FLAC sound is the only way to go nowadays, mp3s just don't cut it anymore. Help spread the word!

There are far too many uninformed, ignoramuses here on pirate bay still ripping their CD uploads using 320kbs MP3 which is pointless unless your computer has like 200 gigs of ram, a number very low by today's standards. You can buy massive amounts of external hard drive memory for chump change.

Here's to seeing all of the music on the PBay available in FLAC! This is the only true way to listen to your music! I have personally generated wave graphs to compare, and each sound was of course greatly clearer both on paper and in practice. Little details comes out that were never there before while they were mp3. 

I use Sennheiser HD-555 and HD-800, pricey but worth it if you are seriously into music.

For the average person, FLAC may be too much; otherwise, follow the advice posted above.

Correction: Not 200GB of RAM; 200GB Storage Capacity."
