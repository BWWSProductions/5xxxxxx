,xniggler,2009-10-19T13:56Z,"""Defying Stargate's Gravity""?..

First of all , having cancelled Stargate Atlantis to bring us Stargate Universe is a joke. With all their market-research tools and viewer statistics they have to know that there ins't gonna be an audience for this show!!??! Just like there wasn't an audience for canadas' ""defying gravity"". This is Sci Fi people, no Sci Fi fan cares about some personal back-flash drama crap on earth. The whole point of Sci Fi is to give us drama and adventure beyond the banal structures of pleb existence? and frankly if i want to see some soapy drama , why in space??? I'd rather just watch lost or damages instead?shows which focus on human interaction entirely and therefore do it better.

the ridiculous Christian vision in the desert in episode 3 really shows you that A: Who-ever wrote the script or produced this must be some conformist Christian tool. Damn, was that episode bad? and B: That there is no hope for this show to pick up cause it lacks direction and character since the first thing they resorted to in a regular episode is Christian symbolism? I mean how about setting up the show a bit more , like : introducing an alien-character?something new people, not rehashing nonsense.

(On this note ,a big ""f..k you"" to all you psychotic Christian, Muslim and whatever cult morons out there, you holding humankind back?.?. theistic believes are nonsense!!!! please, it's 2010 soon , get with it!!!! )

And in all honesty, aren't the two worst boring things that can happen in movies or series in general: ""dream sequences and religious visions???"" especially bias ones ??? America ??? The land that Jesus got exported to in a super-size burger meal??? Hello???

So again, a big buh to this series for so far. I'm gonna check out two more episodes before i give up on the show, and just so you know SGU team, i only do so in reminiscence of it's predecessor SGA.

One last thing: didn't the shitty remake of ""star trek enterprise"" teach us hat cheesy music and Sci Fi don't go together?

I give the show 3 out of 10 for so far. "
,eddboy876,2009-10-19T16:29Z,"@xniggler:

I agree with you on most of your points, this whole show has been a joke up til now.

Bring back SG-1! Those were good episodes, original storylines and a lot of fun to watch.

Atlantis had a lot of good storylines, new enemies and a whole lot of action.

Universe is... Heh, I'm not going to even bother describing it to the extent you did.

To all looking for a decent series, this is probably not for you unless you want to be sent to sleep."
,DrLacroix,2009-10-19T19:29Z,A big thanks to you all for your comments. I will not be seeing this anymore. What a waste of time!
,t3k,2009-10-20T12:11Z,"@xniggler:

Great analysis/comment and unfortunately so true."
,migal666,2009-10-21T20:28Z,"So...
You mean that you don´t need any background for these new characters? I really like the show this far and I´m surely gonna watch it! Just because there hasn´t been any shootouts doesn´t mean it cant be action. If you want action, watch some crappy CSI or other shit....."
,Gliktch,2009-10-22T13:50Z,"Thanks xniggler, great comments about the unfortunate failure of this spinoff.  I, too, wish they had simply stretched out SG-1 for a few more seasons rather than try this sort of thing...  I guess one of the main obstacles they would have had, is that the original cast was getting older and also probably many of them weren't interested in continuing (after all, a decade is a heck of a long time in an acting career), so a full overhaul rather than just bringing in new leads to combat attrition MAY have been the best course of action, but sadly they've let the quality slide along with the known faces.

What a disappointment, there was so much potential in this 'universe' (the Stargate universe, small U, if you get my meaning)."
,Gliktch,2009-10-22T13:53Z,"By the way, between my brother and I, we've legitimately bought every DVD box set for Stargate since it started - I previewed this to see if it was worth the purchase, and sadly it's not."
,monkeymadman,2009-10-22T22:17Z,"Some of you are complaining it's 'boring' It's the forth episode in a third story line. Give it time, jeez."

,rct999,2009-10-23T00:58Z,"i havent seen this ep yet, but i really like SGU."
,fang_x,2009-10-23T06:52Z,"I like the idea behind this, for most scifi series you have to have a modeo f transport for the crew, Startrek was the Enterprize, Stargate was the stargate, now they are sort of copying startrek but, the way they are doing it is somewhat interesting

and there was some form of alien / hallucination in episode 3, perhaps this will add up to something?"
,tinny112,2009-10-23T08:10Z,"So far...

Universe: their arrival in an Ancient spaceship causes power failures etc.

Atlantis: their arrival in an Ancient underwater city causes power failures etc.

hopefully, it gets a bit more creative later on... also, i think they're trying to cram too much character building stuff into too little time. you can spread that shit out, you know!"
,tinny112,2009-10-23T08:16Z,"ok i just did some research and found out why Universe is gonna suck balls.

http://gateworld.net/news/2008/08/istargate_universei_has_a_go.shtml

Here are a few quotes:
""Universe will attempt to appeal to a broader audience""
""The show will be ""a little more character-based, a little less rooted in a sci-fi mythology,"" said co-creator Brad Wright""
 ""This is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation,"" 

in other words: fucking shit."

I'm not sure why these are labeled HDTV when they're shrunk to 624x352.
16:9 HDTV is either 720 or 1080 lines of horizontal resolution. 4:3 Standard Definition TV is 480 lines interlaced. This is essentially progressive Standard Definition.
--------------------------------"
,Lungz420,2009-10-25T12:16Z,"@ozc 
the HDTV in the title simply refers to the fact that these are PVR rips from an HD signal.

These files are compressed to save you, me, and the rest of the internet a little bandwidth.

By all means if you can afford upwards of 1GB of bandwidth and HD space per show you should check out HDTV.X264 rips.

They are generally a little nicer looking"
