,justin131,2009-10-13T23:34Z,Wrong category. Should be in TV Shows High Def.
,hadoali,2009-10-14T02:25Z,"Lately, the new episodes that are uploaded in 720p for this show, don't work very well. The audio doesn't work well when they speak when I stream through my PS3, and when I play normally with VLC on my PC the video lags often. Any suggestions?"
,hogri2,2009-10-14T13:18Z,"I noticed this as well in many recent HDTV episodes from various shows (audio gaps on PS3). Maybe a change in codec (algorithm, another version, different settings). I can't tell why this happens."
,Gomaramp,2009-10-17T00:41Z,I just convert them into mp4 using ps video 9.That makes the filesize smaller and fixes the lag problem.Hope that helps.
,supama_,2009-10-22T13:59Z,"If you use PS3MediaServer for streaming try to change the ""Number of audio channels"" to 2. Seems to fix the problem with audio gaps. Not a perfect solution, but 5.1 is not so important in this case."
