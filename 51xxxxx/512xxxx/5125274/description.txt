Sleep Good - Rock Well is a rockumentary by the danish filmmaker Andreas Haaning Christiansen about Finlands 22-Pistepirkko - one of the truly original and eccentric bands to come from the Nordic countries. 

After 25 years and 10 unique albums, this is the first portrait of band members Asko, PK and Espe during a demanding tour of Europe spanningl 50 concerts in 50 days. The film captures the spirit of the band and tells an inspiring musical story about ambition, brotherhood, friendship and will power. Beyond the tour, the film follows the band developing new material in snowy Finland and eventually recording in sunny summer Helsinki. Containing a generous supplement of tour footage as well as sessions for the studio album "Drops & Kicks" this dvd presents over 40 songs from concert halls around Europe.
