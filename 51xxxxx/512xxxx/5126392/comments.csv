I can't seem to seed it. If anyone has got a suggestion or an idea, shoot :) !"

If so, thanks for the upload!"
[V],Alia_Erenel,2009-10-20T02:07Z,"I really doubt the updates will be working with this version. Adobe seems to be really careful with Acrobat.
Updates are working with CS4 tho."
,Speaker4TheDead,2009-10-24T14:20Z,"Torrent dl'd flawlessly (but a little slow)...
and your instructions are clear and simple enough that even I can follow them ;)

Clear, simple & virus free...
Beautiful!
Thanks Alia_Erenel"
,alisak2000,2010-02-02T00:26Z,I have the full CS4 from ChatChitto and it works fine on my Vista laptop but the Acrobat keeps expiring on my XP desktop requiring that I uninstall the full CS4 and then reinstall which takes a long time.  Any suggestions or fixes?  I am DL this 9.0 in hopes of circumventing that annoying expiration.  AlisaK2000@aol.com
[V],Alia_Erenel,2010-02-03T16:33Z,"Acrobat isn't part of CS4 really, it has it's own protection.
Try this mod if you'd like, but I can't assure you that you computer won't remember older settings/registrations.

Adobe should provide a cleaner on their website, look for it.

Good luck !"
