,jaidi,2010-01-04T18:02Z,Thankyou so much for sharing your collection with us Mr Gordon. I am in the process of downloading all of your Columbo series and have watched the completed downloads with great enjoyment. It is of course taking a while to complete the downloads but well worth it. Thanks again for your time and effort.

The first TV movie with Peter Falk playing the Columbo character, however, was ""Prescription: Murder"", which was filmed in 1967 and didn't air until February 1968."
