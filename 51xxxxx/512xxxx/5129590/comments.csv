,bill202,2009-10-21T06:45Z,"Works perfect, everythings works, jailbroken, unlocked with ultrasn0w. Winterboard, ssh on mobile terminal. I am now on 3.1.2 but make sure you have a jailbroken Iphone before you proceed. The only problem is I don't have the carrier logo, but my carrier on Rogers works on an AT&T Iphone. I guess it is the pwnage tool to make the custom firmware"
,bill202,2009-10-21T10:22Z,"If anyone has the same problem, No carrier logo but phone works with only signal bar. Please comfirm"
,starman_jones,2009-10-22T20:36Z,Look above it says costom logos not included
,bill202,2009-10-22T23:06Z,"The Carrier Logo is not there, not the custom boot up logo. Don't know what is happening"
,_a_d_m_i_n_,2009-10-27T21:34Z,"just installed on my 3gs, works great, except no mobile carrier logo displayed, which could be cool.
