Well, From Under The Cork Tree was a CD rip (Except for tracks 14-18), Folie A Deux was a CD rip from tracks 1-14, and both discs on Infinity On High were CD rips. Everything else I got from a few websites, corrected the info, and uploaded them here.


(Original quote from The Music Or The Misery on From Under The Cork Tree: I got your love letters, corrected the grammar, and sent them back.)"
