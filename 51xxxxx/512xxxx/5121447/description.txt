Careful attention is paid to the presentation of the basic theory.
* Enhanced sections throughout text provide much firmer foundation than the first edition.
* Literature citations are given throughout for reference to additional material.

[i]Review[/i]

Transport Phenomena by Bird, Stewart and Lightfoot is one of the most useful [u]chemical engineering textbook[/u] ever written. For nearly five decades now, many chemical engineers have lived by what they learned first through this book. The revised edition makes the book current, though 1960 edition is great introduction to the [u]mass, heat and energy and/or momentum transfer problems[/u]. 
The basis idea of the book is simple: list the equations useful for a system of problems, say in mass transfer; provide set of assumptions used to arrive at those; suggest possible solutions to the differential equations for practical industry conditions; use correlations derived by researchers where real time data is unavailable and lastly, learn how to adapt solutions for different set of conditions. The book attempts to make problem solving into a set of instructions to be followed, and by sticking to the fundamental assumptions and equations allows one to attack a range of problems relevant to fields as diverse as diffusion transport, biochemical processes, condensation problems for atmospheric physics, chemical kinetics, heat conduction, petroleum extraction and flow of fluids relevant to many processing industries. 

Recommended reference for all chemical engineers. [/b]
