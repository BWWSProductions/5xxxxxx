Heartbreak Ridge (1986) is a comedy drama war movie starring Clint Eastwood, Everett McGill, Bo Svenson and Mario Van Peebles.

The plot revolves around tough career Marine and combat veteran Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood) who uses his traditionalist training methods on a ragtag bunch of misfits in an attempt to turn them into a fighting unit.

Eastwood really has a good time in this movie and his performance is superb. His character spits out sharp vicious dialogue and despite his advancing age (Eastwood was 56 when he made this movie) he still looked tougher then all the younger actors playing the trainees.
