,ShineEyes,2009-10-17T09:29Z,"Fuck.  Be careful about playing this and Forza 3 online before release, guys.  Apparently for those games in particular MS is bringing down the banhammer.  Google it! I think I may be fucked...we shall see over the next couple days."
,danmanc,2009-10-19T19:06Z,"Right lets prove this, if you have downloaded this and have played it leave a comment saying if you have been banned or not, im sure this is just a scare tactic."
,swoto,2009-10-19T23:37Z,I've never been banned for playing games before release date but my friend got banned for playing Gears of War 2 before release date. His GT wasn't banned but he had to buy a new xbox and mod it all over again. Doesn't matter though because Borderlands came out already so they wont know
,dUbx023,2009-10-20T02:35Z,"Hi guys. 
Im new with downloading xbox 360 games. So I have a few questions, can I play this game (i live in Europe) and is the game only in French or also in English? 
Thanks!!!"
,aboltz11,2009-10-20T03:25Z,"i downloaded this a few days ago, and been playing it. i have had my xbox disconnected from xbox live since tho. i have not tried to reconnect and i will not until tomorrow. 10/20/09. so i will let you guys know tomorrow. but newayz, the game is fricken AMAZING! "
,the-truth-is-out-there,2009-10-25T21:36Z,PC Version is out. http://www.xrel.to/game-nfo/135244/Borderlands-RELOADED.html
,HaXoR_A50,2009-11-22T09:01Z,well everyone i have something that might shock you... of course you got banned for playing it before its released you retards!! are you really to stupid and impatient to just wait for a few days or you would rather get banned over something like this? well thats obvious that you would. god you people amaze me
