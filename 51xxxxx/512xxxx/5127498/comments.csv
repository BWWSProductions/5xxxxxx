,Imok86,2010-01-11T14:38Z,Thanks iammrfrank this one works great. i just converted it one more time to change the game ID and now im playing without any issues and without overclocking my psp i not even have to put the disc load speed to fast. right now i am att the date with quistis at the top of the training hall and so far the game worked perfectly. No freezing by using scan or draw magic btw im using 4.01 pops on 5.50 Gen-D3
