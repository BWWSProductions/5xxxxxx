This is Final Fantasy VIII encoded in 1 eboot.pbp

Customized Icon, Background, Motion Icon (made by myself)

Has been tested trough the first save point by myself.

To use: Copy folder containing eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

A lot of people experience lagg and freezing with Final Fantasy VIII and IX, if you simply go to the restore panel or your psp (hold down R during boot up with custom firmware) and there should be an option to overclock processor. Overclocking has prevented nearly all lagg and freezing FOR ME.
