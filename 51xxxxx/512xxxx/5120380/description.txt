Erasure are an English synthpop duo, consisting of songwriter and keyboardist Vince Clarke and singer Andy Bell.

Erasure entered the music scene in 1985 with their debut single "Who Needs Love Like That". Following the release of their fourth single, "Sometimes", the duo established themselves on the British charts and became one of the most successful artists of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

From 1986 to 1997, Erasure achieved twenty-four consecutive Top 20 hits in the UK. By 2007, 34 of their 37 singles had made the UK Top 40, with 17 climbing into the Top 10. Labeled "the definitive synthpop superstars", the duo is most popular in their native Great Britain, but has also achieved great success in some other European countries, in the US, and in Latin America (especially in Argentina). To date, Erasure has sold over 25 million albums worldwide.

The band also enjoys popularity within the LGBT community, with openly gay Andy Bell regarded a gay icon.
