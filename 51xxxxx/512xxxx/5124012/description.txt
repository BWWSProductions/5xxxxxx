 

"When Smokey Sings" is the name of a song by the New Wave band ABC. The lyrics and name of the song are a tribute to R&B and Soul singer Smokey Robinson. It was released in mid-1987, on ABC's album Alphabet City.

"When Smokey Sings" and its B-side, "Chicago" also topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song reached number eleven on the UK chart and proved to be their second American Top 10 hit, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. There is a slight difference in the lyrics between the album and single version in the bridge of the song.

In the album version, references are made to "Luther", "Sly", "James" and "Marvin" (most likely referring to Luther Vandross, Sly & the Family Stone, James Brown, and Marvin Gaye respectively). In the single version, this is replaced by alternate lyrics, followed by a short saxophone solo.
