,Donelson,2009-10-29T23:07Z,Awesomeissimo!  The other version did indeed expire.  Great for quick use when you don't want to load a resource hog like Ivory.  Very pianistic sound & feel.

,8698,2011-04-21T10:05Z,"At first I didn't do it right: I didn't read the instructions carefully: I just glanced at them, it says something about a cracked file called ""pianissimo.dll"", you are supposed to take that and copy it over the program file of the same name. Well usually, the program file is located where the program is installed, right? But in this case, you don't go to the folder you normally would go to. You don't go to Program Files\Pianissimo. Instead, you go to wherever you installed the VST folder, which is a different place. That's where you paste the cracked pianissimo.dll file. Then it works. To illustrate, here are to two different folders on my harddrive: 
E:\Program Files\Pianissimo
E:\Program Files\VST\Pianissimo "
