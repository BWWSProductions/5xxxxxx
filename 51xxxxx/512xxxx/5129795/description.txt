Quality information: 

As stated before HQ DVD this DVD has a excellent quality.
The footage is more than thirty years old,(It was recorded by the BBC) but the image is sharp because the source tapes were very good preserved. On your dvd player it will look great. It is the best quality available for this concert. The audio is in stereo and sounds very good, particular on a good stereo set you will get a real live experience from The Jacksons.

The DVD is 3,45 GB and in NTSC Format and can be burned with every burn software on dvd. 
Provided in the torrent is a sample of the concert dvd wich contains approx. 2 minutes of the song Blame It On The Boogie so you can experience the excellent quality before downloading the whole DVD if you are still not convinced by my words. Note: It will even look better on a dvd player and TV screen. 

His music will live on, so as his legacy as artist. This unofficial HQ DVD is a diamond, a real collectors item and at the moment a very scarce possesion, only posessed by a few people. I sure know you will enjoy watching this concert, feel free to leave a nice comment on every place where you will see this for sharing on the internet where comment are possible.
