Release Date: 12 October 2009
Release Length: 01:56:50
Storyline: A rare mutation has occurred within the vampire community. The Reaper. 
A vampire so consumed with an insatiable bloodlust that they prey on vampires as well as humans, transforming victims 
who are unlucky enough to survive into Reapers themselves. Now their quickly expanding population threatens the existence 
of vampires, and soon there won't be enough humans in the world to satisfy their bloodlust. Blade, Whistler (Yes, he's back) 
and an armory expert named Scud are curiously summoned by the Shadow Council. The council reluctantly admits that they are 
in a dire situation and they require Blade's assistance. Blade then tenuously enters into an alliance with The Bloodpack, 
an elite team of vampires trained in all modes of combat to defeat the Reaper threat. Blade's team and the Bloodpack are the 
only line of defense which can prevent the Reaper population from wiping out the vampire and human populations.
