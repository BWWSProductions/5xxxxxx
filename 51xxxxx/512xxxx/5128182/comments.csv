,crutrail,2009-10-23T12:54Z,"Thank you so much for this upload Malestorm!

OED is an absolutely essential tool. 

This version works like a charm!"
,mmeierbier,2009-10-24T14:48Z,"Thanks, have been looking for this for a long time.
FYI, to get it to work with Win 7,I had to download msvcr71.dll from dll-files.com and put it in the program folder. Works like a charm now."
,voyger2,2009-10-24T17:39Z,Thanks for uploading.
,JoiresWay-II,2009-10-28T03:13Z,THE BEST TORRENT YOU WILL FIND. but the worst part is that the speed. 
,blackmoon333,2009-11-02T00:10Z,thx thx & thx you'r the best man
,hongkongkev,2009-11-03T16:20Z,Thank you SO MUCH for this torrent; works without installing and naturally blows away my (t)rusty 2003 version.
,bobc99,2009-11-12T04:47Z,"Many, many thanks for this.  Is there any way to make it work on Mac?"
,dsrs,2009-11-15T18:29Z,"sorry but am i missing something?
i don't see any instructions on how to install
though on other torrents i saw something about how you have to edit the .ini file"
,dsrs,2009-11-15T18:43Z,"ok i see now you just unrar and then click on swhx.exe
it does not 'install'
rather the dictionary welcome screen appears and you can search for words

this is fucking brilliant beyond words

i big fuck you to oup, from an oxford graduate, for making their dictionary outrageously expensive

will seed forever"
,peteryonge,2009-11-19T20:31Z,how do i get this to work on a mac?
,FRO1L4NDR35,2009-11-20T05:28Z,"Great Share! Thanks
The porblem with compressed files is that you seed an useless file, then an iso file is better."
,mannu.gupta1280,2009-12-01T23:46Z,"Ppl, cannot open the dictionary. It asks for the appropriate program to choose from. I tried msvcr71.dll but this converted OED to Acrobat form and cannot open. Please tell the detailed steps to open it. Thanks in Advance"
,Kasirockz,2009-12-08T02:09Z,Thank you
,jimmybroon,2009-12-12T10:23Z,"My Norton AV has blocked high-risk virus 'Bloodhound PDF.18' connected to this torrent.

[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2009-12-14T05:29Z,"I checked the extracted RAR with AVG Pro 9.0 with templates updated as of today and nothing found.

There's nothing to install; just extract the RAR, browse into the folder and launch swhx.exe. It comes up in a fraction of a second. Couldn't be easier.

I've wanted the OED for years; took only half an hour to download and it works wonderfully. Gawdamn but I love this site sometimes. This is so much better than the bulky print edition. Maddest of the mad props to Maelstrom for providing."
,tulysses,2009-12-15T15:56Z,"I double click the swhx.exe,but it can't work.
It says ""Uncaught exception""...
""Unable to load flash player library""...
My system is Windows XP.
Who know how to solve it,
Thanks. "
,tulysses,2009-12-15T16:04Z,"i changed the name of the directory,and it works
thanks, malestrom "
,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2009-12-16T15:21Z,Mac version anyone? Please?
,boonp,2010-01-01T18:54Z,"Hello tulysses
I 've got the same problem on xp. 
Could you tell me how do rename the directory to make it works ?
My original dir is:
E:\download\English study\Oxford English Dictionary - 2nd Ed. Vers.4.0 (2009) (Malestrom?)

Thanks !!!"
,666Nero,2010-01-03T09:51Z,"This is awesome! Just a thought... you could make the install a bit more sexy by wrapping it in winrar or by using one of the self-install software packages. I'm sure a great number of students and young scholars would get advantage out of this, but not many linguists nor humanities students might have a good handle on copying a shortcut to their desktop or program list.
Thanks loads. I'm a teacher AND I use technology. This'll come in handy whenever I do a history study on verbiage and linguistics."
,Lachy,2010-01-06T22:42Z,"Unfortunately, it seems to only contain the en-US spellings for some words, particularly those ending in -ize instead of -ise, as in en-GB and en-AU. Not sure why that is, since it seems to contain the correct spellings for other words. But it means looking up words like ""organise"" and ""realise"" need to be done with the annoying US spelling."
,miakolee,2010-01-23T01:45Z,thanks
,anish3189,2010-01-26T10:31Z,"please tell me how to install this, I have no idea how this is going to work, so please help me, mail me at anish3189@gmail.com"
[V],pluto999,2010-02-09T16:52Z,@anish3189: just unrar & click on swhx.exe
,starick1957,2010-02-20T14:59Z,"To all of you that got this to work, would you mind sharing the PASSWORD with the rest of us?"
,claustral,2010-02-25T01:28Z,"Thanks and it worked.

1.unrar (don't need the password)
2.change the name of the fold to ""Oxford English Dictionary"" only
3.click on ""swhx.exe"" (don't have to install)

My computer system is Windows XP."
,starick1957,2010-02-27T15:44Z,I'm using winrar and it keeps asking for a password even when I leave it blank!
,kittleboy,2010-02-28T07:54Z,"Does it have pronunciation?
how many types of pronunciation it has? British only or British and American?
Is this one better than Longman?( longman has two types of pronunciation )"
,kittleboy,2010-02-28T14:35Z,"AAAAAAAAH,
useless,
just phonetics, no pronunciation
Just wasted my time...."
,Cadhorn,2010-04-04T19:06Z,"I actually paid for this a couple years ago. ~$300. But their copy-protection/authorization scheme is such an irritating pile of shit... fuck it! I'm getting the cracked version!!
Thanks for this malestrom. :D"
,nok32,2010-04-09T06:50Z,"YESSS!!!

thank you.

for the record, this DOES have the full character set for the etymology."
,minreal,2010-05-07T11:59Z,"Thanks Malestrom! 
Works perfectly on Win XP PRO SP3.

HOWTO: Copy entire folder into Program Files, and make a shortcut from 'swhx.exe' to your Start Menu. No installation required."
,KL13,2010-05-10T02:51Z,"Thanks a lot for this wonderful stuff.
I didn't copy it to program files. I just unzipped the folder in a different drive, and placed a short cut to swhx on desktop. That's all. It works fine."
,jperana,2010-05-12T02:14Z,Will it work with Win7 Pro 32-bit?
,borosaab,2010-05-21T06:08Z,"many thanks!!!

wonderful!!!"
,boydaplis,2010-06-02T19:42Z,"waste of time. It didn't even have definitions for the word ""dyslexia"" and ""dyslexic"". Even the smallest dictionary in the universe has definitions for those two words."
,adpanzerlover,2010-07-04T12:43Z,"@mmeierbier
Thanx buddy!!!
And thanx to uploader too"
[T],L_Hammond,2010-07-06T16:21Z,"Many thanks for sharing this! This is, simply put, the definitive english dictionary.

To hear pronunciations, the smaller Concise Oxford English Dictonary is also great to have, and is easily found as a torrent.

I'm running Win XP, and I had to follow 'mmeirbiers' advice and download msvcr71.dll from dll-files.com and put it in the program folder. After doing that everything is OK. Thanks mmeirbiers!

PS. 'boydaplis' complained that this dictionary is a waste of time, and you couldn't even find ""dyslexia"" and ""dyslexic"". Well, I had to check it out, and this is what I found:

dys'lexia [Gr. ?speaking? (here taken in sense ?reading?), first formed as G. dyslexie (R. Berlin 1883, in Med. Correspondenz-Blatt des W체rttemberg. 채rztl. Landesvereins LIII. 209)], a difficulty in reading due to affection of the brain; spec. = word-blindness (word n. 29); hence dys'lectic, dys'lexic adjs. and ns.

,sosofofo,2010-10-11T22:12Z,"please please, does anyone have the same program for android, I'm disparate to find it."
,voxeme,2011-02-04T08:32Z,"I'm running XP SP3, extracts fine using 7-Zip (no password), and I ran this without needing extra DLLs. Avira Antivirus and SUPERAntiSpyware (updated to 2011.02.04) did not pick up any viruses/malware.

Just extract to e.g. C:\Program Files\OED and run SWHX.EXE. This version has a _much_ improved and less buggy interface than the previous version.

Thanks malestrom/seeders!"
,siomigadjura,2011-02-05T10:24Z,Thank you very much! This is the best English Dictionary I have ever seen.
,s987s,2011-02-26T13:29Z,"It worked fine and very happy with this torrent. Looks like a great dictionary.
Followed instructions and didn't get it straight at first but saved file at C: root. There it would run smoothly.
Thx MS and I'm seeding."
,mrzip744,2011-05-05T22:32Z,"After d/l and unzip, I tried to run the exe, but I got a message that said I didn't have the neko.dll.  Tried to get it via dll-files.com but it wasn't available there... Advise???"
,grippm,2011-07-07T14:20Z,"thank you.
works perfectly well on Windows 7.
no password and no installation needed.
:)"
,Simula,2011-08-22T19:08Z,"Hello Malestrom_HH:
I am writing this to thank you for the wonderful upload. I am an avid collector of dictionaries. The OED you have uploaded is wonderful. 

You have done a great job. I have registered with the Pirate Bay site solely to write to you.

I want to genuflect in front of you for this great job.

If you, or anyone else, knows about more such English Language softwares, including dictionaries, do leave a comment and link.

,jiraia,2011-09-23T06:19Z,Thanks. Work 100%.
,Bulto95,2011-11-13T05:40Z,thnx Malestrom_HH and all seeders.
,vabole,2012-03-11T17:20Z,Guys please do not download it! This shit has killed my dyslexic brother.
,_qwnm,2012-05-06T07:08Z,"how I got it to work (using Win 7 32bit):

1. open in winrar (it didn't ask for a password)
2. rename the folder from ""Oxford English Dictionary - 2nd Ed. Vers.4.0 (2009) (Malestrom..."" to  ""Oxford English Dictionary"" exactly
3. extract to desktop
4. drag extracted folder to program files
5. open the folder and look for ""swhx.exe""
6. right click, create short cut from the start menu
7. launch program from start menu

 curate ut valeatis, my linguist friends"
,_qwnm,2012-05-06T07:10Z,p.s. I will love you forever malestrom
