Summary (IMDB):
Evan Treborn grows up in a small town with his single, working mother and his 
friends. He suffers from memory blackouts where he suddenly finds himself 
somewhere else, confused. Evan's friends and mother hardly believe him, 
thinking he makes it up just to get out of trouble. As Evan grows up he has 
less of these blackouts until he seems to have recovered. Since the age of 
seven he has written a diary of his blackout moments so he can remember what 
happens. One day at college he starts to read one of his old diaries, and 
suddenly a flashback hits him like a brick!

Playback:
I recommend using VLC. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/. It's my understanding
(read: unconfirmed) that Quicktime cannot play more than 2 audio channels. 
Mac users may have luck using the Perian component pack  
http://www.perian.org/. I have also had success with Windows Media Player 12 
in Windows 7 OOB.
