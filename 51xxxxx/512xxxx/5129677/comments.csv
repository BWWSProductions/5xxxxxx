,-ZEEBEE-,2009-11-07T16:43Z,"Ah yes! Finally got it to work. Mattrub is right. Works fine for Windows 7, just follow the instructions exactly. And if you do fuck it up,  delete the pegasys folder in app data and prog files. Thanks alot! :)"
,markinthecity,2009-11-20T08:55Z,"I followed exactly the instructions and still ask me 
about serial number."
,markinthecity,2009-11-20T11:22Z,"It's all right now. Never mind guys. Now I did it  
really proper way."
,Lemmi577,2009-12-14T16:08Z,"markinthecity, how did you solve it? i have the same problem."
,rmarandino,2009-12-21T00:49Z,I followed the instructions several times. The keygen creates a license (.lic file in My Documents) but is still asks me for the license. Does anyone have a step by step to dummies instructions?
,markinthecity,2009-12-22T18:16Z,"Lemmi, just like directions/instructions say in the notepad. I'm not trying to be smart but I really don't know what else can I tell you. Anyway, I'm not kidding.

@rmarandino
I don't think that a step by step instructions for dummies would help you better.   "
,EGRENY,2009-12-23T04:16Z,"I get an error message saying; ""cannot find the class. (error code 0x8004800B)"" can anyone help?"
,unclemanti,2009-12-24T03:20Z,It doesn't work guys. I am using Windows Vista and I did everything to the letter. Screw this. Move on to the next highest seeder!
,mocarbon,2009-12-24T06:18Z,"I get the same message on Windows7 Ult x64 ""cannot find the class. (error code 0x8004800B)"" Other than that the patch worked fine. Only thing I did was enable CUDA. Which is the whole reason I want to use this app. Any other apps do encoding CUDA accelerated back to Mpeg2 for burning dvds from avi?"
,mocarbon,2009-12-24T06:19Z,lemmi.. I will assume you skipped the step about clicking on properties and making it run in XP SP2 compatability mode. That's why it doesn't work. Forgive me if im wrong but.. You didn't follow the instructions.

Only problem, Aero 7. In this case, the problem come from Pegasys! Not from the files of ""50Â˘"" !

Thanks ""50Â˘"""
,Shauncold,2010-01-15T08:30Z,"all the information in the notepad instructions are a lie. I followed the instructions to a T and when I try to run the program, I get the serial number insertion area even after getting a successful key generated. Where can I find the key generated  information(it must be in a folder somewhere) (it starts with TAW4 but what is the rest of it)."
,csp9,2010-01-18T16:24Z,"Thnx!
Works perfectly on Windows 7 Ultimate x32."
,tenzo12,2010-01-25T00:40Z,"Those with 64bit Win7 might want to change the patcher install Directory from:
