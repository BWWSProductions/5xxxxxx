,jullejul,2009-10-23T07:35Z,"why is the game 13.48 GIB a normal xbox 360 game is 5-7 GIB.

is it 2 disc? "
,xiIix,2009-10-23T18:05Z,"That's a really dumb question, seeing as though the Xbox doesn't have a Bluray drive, and DVD9's are limited to 8GB."
,guyver51,2009-10-24T21:02Z,put disc 1 in loads ok! put disc 2 in get mesage incorrect disc anybody any answers.
,JacKaLen,2009-10-27T17:27Z,What's on the discs? Are they both singleplayer or is disc two multiplayer like Halo ODST?
,Bennythen00b.,2009-10-29T16:19Z,JacKaLen: Disc one is the actual game. Disc two contains a bunch of extra vehicles and race tracks.
,Tim_82,2009-10-30T15:36Z,"Spelet fungerade första gången jag startade spelet. Slutade dock fungera när jag skulle sätta i disc 2 för alla banor.... nu är jag försöker starta spelet så hänger det sig i uppladdningen =/ kan det ha att göra med den updatering som kom när jag startade upp det första gången?
Spelet fungerar alltså inte.... tog mig 4dagar att ladda hem "

,marcusban,2009-11-04T15:29Z,"All files for Forza 3 are not good, I took from various people, and nothing works, I have a lot of games with wawe 3, everything is running fine, what could be a problem if he knew anyone."
,iamabiohazard,2009-11-07T18:22Z,i got banned today to. gutted got to but a new xbox now nice 1 microsoft. like you dont make enough money through xbox live and dlc.
,iamabiohazard,2009-11-07T18:28Z,"Uplugging the ethernet won't prevent a ban, as the Xbox 360 has an internal flash that stores the security data from every disc inserted into the drive, if you do run a badly burnt disc you will be added to the banlist upon reconnecting to Xbox Live. MS doesn't do immediate bans (except on truly hacked boxes, not just DVD firmware), and adds pirates to a banlist that is occasionally cleaned out with a 'ban wave'. For the past two years there has been a ban wave in November, presumably to get pirates to purchase new boxes for Christmas. If you obtain a retail copy long before release (longer than three or so days, which could be a legitimate early street release), a trick is to unplug ethernet and the power cord for 10 minutes, resetting the internal clock to Nov 15, 2005, and only reconnect after official retail release. Presumably MS looking at players with unusual play dates will ignore a date so obviously incorrect."

I have downloaded a game but all it contains is a bunch of those number files like .024 and no .rar file. Usually the games I download have some .rar files so I select em all and extract to a single folder with a .iso and a .dvd.. But this game isn't giving me that extraction option.. So can anyone tell me how to extract the .iso and the .dvd file??
(this has nothin to do with FM 3, its just that my game's pretty old and no one's responding on its forum...)"
,gamerguy1,2009-12-22T13:12Z,"@danman ,just right click on of the files and select ""open with""then browse for winrar and open it with winrar,then select extract to and the disk will be extracted and  do this for the second disc too.."

You need to get a xbox 360 Activation Disc. DL and burn on a Dual layer disc and your good to go!"

,SOLOinc,2010-02-02T03:12Z,"Forgive the newbie question, but does this require any hardware mods to the XBOX or is it just a question of burning the discs, inserting and playing?"

,PepitaK,2010-04-22T19:04Z,"I have a problem installing the second disc.
When I started the game for the first time, it asked if I wanted to install additional content. I tried it, inserted disc 2 as asked, and after a while inserted disc 1 back. At this point everything stopped working, and it kept asking for disc 1.
I had already installed both discs on my hd.
Should I just install it again?"
