Scooby Doo: The Mystery Begins

What brings best friends together? For Daphne, Velma, Fred, Shaggy and Shaggy's spunky pup Scooby-Doo, it's a mystery! The feature-length live-action Scooby-Doo: The Mystery Begins original movie takes you back to when four teenage sleuths (plus one dog detective) first met. Unjustly accused of staging a spooky practical joke complete with ghosts, the kids are suspended from Coolsville High. To clear their names, they team to solve the supernatural mystery... and head straight into nonstop laughs and adventure. Special fun, special friends and extra-special effects make this "how-it-all-began" story - from boy-meets-dog to the first trip in the Mystery Machine and more - a doggone great time!
