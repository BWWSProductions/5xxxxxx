,Spartan_300,2009-10-13T03:22Z,"Thanks for the upload,..."
,thebash,2009-10-13T14:17Z,"@zmacdaddy8.
Ignorace must be bliss.
How the F@#$ are you gonna watch 140 minutes of video with 700MB, i guess with a screen the size of your brain.

anyway this release is  a waste if you want half decent quality because with a resolution of 640x272 one can party like its 1999.
compress the stupid audio unless it's a musical and expand the video.
All in all great file for the blinds but hey at least it sounds good.

Nothing personal..."
,bubalanimi,2009-10-24T22:04Z,it would be nice if i get this download this year.....seed please D:
,sweetmelonie,2009-10-26T17:22Z,Subs?
,therealjdb,2009-11-28T08:09Z,"Thanks for the up!

For those of you who don't know, the 700mb size is originally so that you could burn the rips to CD-R's and watch them as DVD CDs. :)"
,Tragonn,2009-11-28T13:04Z,"@thebash
1. 700 mb can be more than good enough in quality.
2. size of brain? Considering how you went straight to insults Im guessing that you are the one with a tiny fuckin brain.
3. Keep it civil or shut it."
,chizzypoof,2009-12-01T19:46Z,Good upload.  But boy this movie was a huge letdown.  Seeding and deleting.  It is that bad.

,dpoz,2009-12-12T22:56Z,"Over 5000 seeders, and I'm getting 30 kb/s -_-"

,saami_dude,2009-12-19T19:50Z,"excellent movie a-10 , v-10"
,crayolakidd,2009-12-22T10:14Z,"Cheers muchly... nice to see at least a few still rip with quality being given more priority than punt file size.

To all the ungrateful whiners.... if the file size too big for you, there are plenty of other crapware rip in circulation... go download one of those and shut the f@#k up!

@zmacdaddy8 - AXXO often releases larger rips than that for those actually wanting quality, so what the f@#k are you on about?? And given the fact you've never contributed ANYTHING to the torrent community (apart from your questionable ""charm""), either put-up or p1ss-off ya little turd!"
,Peatythedog,2009-12-23T16:48Z,TY!
,CliveCar,2010-01-03T22:06Z,"Thanks, but why's the audio so weird? The volume of some audio tracks occasionally goes up insanely. It sounds pre-edited. Is this a pre-release version?
I may have thought it's configured to be played with a different speaker layout, but it explicitly says it's 6 channels (5.1).
Anyway, thanks for the upload. High quality video."

Great movie , thanks dude ."
,H2Kzero,2010-01-16T02:04Z,I think only a hour and a half movie can be compressed into 700 mb not a 2hr and a half.
,ak47passi,2010-01-16T10:21Z,i dont have any sounds in the movie??windows media player says Dolby AC3 (2000) to download but where i can get it??

,purplebay,2011-08-01T05:59Z,"thanks to uploader and seeders, took little over 5 mins.
v: 8
s: 6 
yes it has low sound but heres a solution:
press vol ^ key. simples :)"
,purplebay,2011-08-01T06:16Z,okay my mistake. watch more than 10mins. yes the sound is very poor constantly jumps from high to low. it does make it pretty unwatchable. even with my vol ^ technique some bits are even then to low to hear. shame
,purplebay,2011-08-01T06:59Z,"d/l the version with zektorm in title, much better audio. the video quality is a bit less, but its half the size"
,watbol,2011-10-08T16:44Z,"Perfect DVD quality!
