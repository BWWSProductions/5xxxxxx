â€œCool Storyâ€ features some of snowboardingâ€™s best North American talent who have been traveling and filming for their video parts all year long. â€œCool Storyâ€ not only features all the seasonâ€™s most progressive snowboarding tricks but amplifies these tricks significance through the stories of the snowboarders themselves. The mundane day to day and the amazing adventure are given equal levity in an attempt at stripping the professional Snowboard world of pretense and showing it as we see it; as another fun year spent with friends adventuring around and trying our best on our snowboards. We strive to create the feeling that our world is at once accessible and utterly amazing. â€œCool Storyâ€ is an exciting opportunity for Think Thank to further our creative exploits while exploring story making through Snowboard video.
