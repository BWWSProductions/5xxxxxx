,nukethem,2009-10-30T03:02Z,"I have downloaded the first episode of the first disc, ""baseball bugs,"" twice, and each time it causes windows explorer to crash every time i click on the file. I don't know if this part of the torrent is corrupt or if it's just my computer, but just letting you know.
Otherwise the quality is fine, and consistent.
Thanks for the upload."
,nukethem,2009-11-05T21:26Z,"Also, vol 5, disc 1, episode 7, ""transylvania 6-5000"" had the same problem.
Does anyone else have this issue?"
,xxMaestroxx,2009-11-06T01:24Z,"Try using another codec, like ffdshow. I think its codec issue."
,ZeNiTH_NL,2009-12-06T09:38Z,Thanks!

,ryuukage,2010-07-02T00:21Z,"I got up to 18% with two episodes fully downloaded.  Neither will play at all.  Tried in ubuntu 10.04 with Movie Player, VLC, and XBMC.  Also tried in VLC on Windows XP.  "
,ckrames,2010-07-22T00:04Z,"Thank you so much, this collection is priceless. Regardless of if you own the DVDs, it would take forever to rip and organize every single episode on 24 DVDs. I'll seed this for a while (when its done). i'm ULing faster than im DLing currently, and I have a 25/15 MBps connection."
,steviekeyz,2010-09-15T12:51Z,"@Global, they have one of the Christmas specials under the special features folder on one of the discs.

Well no problem playing them at all, people are obviously having codec issues. I stream them from my PC to Wii using SMB. 

Works great thx!"

,pirate_9,2011-05-19T20:55Z,"I download. The quality is not so good.
Looks like 200kbps bitrate and not 1200.

You can download (and help to seed) the folow H.264 torrent with some size and very better quality

It's rar but it's ok

http://www.kat.ph/looney-tunes-the-complete-golden-collection-boxset-dvdrip-x264-41rgb-t2413515.html"
,pirate_9,2011-05-19T21:00Z,You can download a single episode of this torrent to see the bad quality.
[T],FatFreddy44,2011-07-11T12:10Z,Here for more cartoons
,Hamada_MJ,2011-08-08T05:03Z,Thanks for this GREAT collection!!
,rockyims,2011-08-20T13:45Z,"thanks xxMaestroxx for such a wonderful upload...
but OMG..what super slow speed...All those who have finished downloading...plz seed...boy ! am i a kid again or what...I 'll seed for others as well...

:(..est. time..says 5 weeks..."
,Zoomguy53,2011-09-27T23:45Z,"This is amazing! But PLEASE SEED! I'll probably do some seeding when I'm done downloading, which has been a day and a half which only brought me to 60%.

For those wondering about quality it's fine, it's about the same for all files and its just below 480p,

Video
Format: AVI
Codec: DivX 5
Bit rate: 1 002 Kbps
Width: 640 pixels
Height: 464 pixels
Frame rate: 29.970 fps

Audio
Format: MPEG Audio (mp3)
Bit rate: 128 Kbps
Channel(s): 2 channels
Sampling rate: 44.1 KHz

The audio is a little quiet, but this is definitely the best torrent of The Looney Tunes Golden Collection you can find on TBP."
,captainscurvy13,2011-09-28T23:25Z,"Took me 1 1/2 weeks to complete the download. I will seed for a month on ""Unlimited Upload"" to help those of you finish your own download. I noticed volume 6 has some cartoons with no volume. Going to download VLC and try that. Thanx !!"
,3nipples,2011-10-04T18:04Z,thanks a lot!
,d.v.m.,2011-10-07T18:54Z,"people, you'll be able to download faster if you seed more yourself, so please seed at unlimited upload as you download"
,romenzo,2011-10-08T14:39Z,"4 weeks that I seed and I've 90%, so please continue to seed cause it's very very slow..."
,Shaggy_79,2011-12-28T23:44Z,quality 
,waldy13,2012-01-26T00:28Z,"cmon guys PLZ seed!! ive always seeded, and this is barely going anywhere.....i'll seed for ages as im downloading and after.....but this is taking way to long....."
,krimpdaddy,2012-04-19T10:55Z,pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
,NTA-Pro,2012-05-29T09:42Z,Would've been better to have this split up though imo. Feels like it takes longer for people to download and seed for huge files :(
,shecalo,2012-06-14T18:44Z,please seed
