nFO bY lADYbEAR-dESIGN 2009

FAQ:

Q: Is it true that AiR got millions of dollars from Steinberg
for not releasing new crackz?
A: No - we only got a blowjob per day!
But we collected all the conspiration-theories we found all
over the internet during the last years and well sell it now
to hollywood for the next James Bond production for at least
1 billion!

Q: But we had to wait so damn long for this release - Why?
A: The amount of time to analyze and reverse the current
syncrosoft implementation was just that high. Think about it
like this: around 25 of the program code is MCFACT protected
and therefore protection-related. As you can imagine the
effort to analyze and reverse such a target is incredibly
high. This time it took us almost 4000 man hours to emulate
the little beast!

Q: Will it work with the 64bit version? Are there plans to make
a release of the 64bit version?
A: No and No! Nevertheless it will perfectly work as a 32bit
application on a 64bit OS like Windows7.

Q: Who the f**k is Gouda?
A: One of the two heads behind all the previous syncrosoft
emulations.
This is my kind of get well soon greetings to you brother!
If you really have to leave this world that young it would
definitely be the end of an era!
It has always been a pleasure to work with you (well DELPHI
still suxx) and I really wish we could have done this project
together too!

Q: What do you you think about peace-out?
A: Bunch of wannabe crackerz. None of their current releases
work properly. They dont even understand the basics of the
protection. Were happy to see other groups giving it a go
if those other groups can produce quality. We dont see that
with peace-out, really they should leave the big boys pool
and go play with the toddlers.

Q: What do you think of open forums who spread AiRs internal
work without respect and before the time?
A: f**k you!
