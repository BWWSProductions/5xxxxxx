,Chuffy,2009-11-02T13:53Z,"@htid555:

My guess is that your 150GB drive was formatted with a FAT32 file system, which has a file-size limit of just under 4GB. If you can, try reformatting it as NTFS.

You don't actually need to burn the ISO, either. just find a free program that loads disc images as virtual drives.

If you must burn it, you'll have to use a dual-layer disc because compressing it to fit on an ordinary single layer disc makes it impossible to install the software. Still, you can always do that if you want a backup (a good idea)."

,FirstBlackPresident,2009-11-15T23:43Z,"Has anyone concluded how to fix the error ""synsoacc.dll does not have the expected interface"" that displays when you try to enter Cubase, thereby crashing it?  From what I've read there are tons of people having this problem, even with retail copies."
,FirstBlackPresident,2009-11-15T23:45Z,"Oh, and how come some people can get the dongle emulator to work in Windows 7 x64 and others, like myself, cannot?  What do I need to do to make it work with my OS?"
,FirstBlackPresident,2009-11-18T07:57Z,How the hell are you people installing the dongle under Windows 7 x64?  Even if I click the c5emu.exe (the dongle installer) it flat out tells me that it cannot be installed under Windows 7 x64.  Is anyone actually using a legit copy of W7x64 with this?
,FirstBlackPresident,2009-11-20T07:55Z,"^Hu?  From Steinberg?

My complaint is not with the Cubase program - that installs just fine - it's with the dongle (the C5emu.exe file).  I'm running Windows 7 x64 and even though Cubase installs completely the dongle absolutely won't start and even if I click the C5emu.exe file a box open up right away saying that the program cannot be run in a x64 OS.  Nothing I try, including using the compatibility mode allows the dongle to install.  There's absolutely nothing I can do to make the C5emu.exe run.  I've tried re-installing everything also.  There's simply no way for me to open the C5emu.exe and I have no idea how other people have supposedly opened it under Windows 7 x64.

In fact my friend, who also has Windows 7 x64 says he gets the exact same message when trying to install the dongle.  I truly believe that the people who are getting it to install under W7 x64 must have something changed within their OS to allow that .exe to work and I need to know what it is."

,FirstBlackPresident,2009-12-07T07:05Z,"The first thing to do is try installing the Cubase 5 activator that I linked to a few posts above yours.  If that doesn't work there is a .dll file that you can find on the net called ""SYN0ACC.DLL"".  Find that .dll by searching for it on Google (it's hard to find but I have found it before), then put that .dll into the ""system32"" sub-folder of the ""windows"" folder on your C: drive.

If after doing that you still get a message saying, ""Cubase cannot find the proper interface"" (or something to that extent) then you need to un-install and re-install Cubase 5 but DO NOT install the dongle.  Simply install everything except the dongle then install the Cubase 5 activator that I linked to in the previous post I mentioned."

,refusew,2009-12-16T08:45Z,"I was able to get this working on Windows 7 x64. I opted to not install the dongle emulator, and instead used the crack posted by ""FirstBlackPresident"".

Did a brief multitrack recording, and mixed it down to .mp3 without any problems whatsoever. The only weird thing I did run into was when I tried running the program with the .iso unmounted the first time, I got an error saying the disc was not insterted. I clicked ""cancel"" and the program started up. After that I started it up unmounted 5 times without getting that message again.

So I have to say this is a great upload! My only problem is that it's been nearly 10 years since I've used cubase and have forgotten most things. This will be very useful for me to record demo tracks to take to my band though.

Thanks!"

,honestlyidontknow,2010-01-07T14:58Z,"I dont understand all this it wont work under windows 7 64bit, is it because these people are useing dell or HP clones and the settings are different in the o/s or what. For a start before you install windows 7 64 make sure all the hardware on your machines are supported properly in win 7 64bit, THEN ONCE INSTALLED go find the god dam user account control settings and slide it to the bottom, so that you are the administrator and not the machine, then dont forget to reboot right behind the adjustment. BEFORE YOU GO ROUND TRYING TO MAKE WIN 7 LOOK PRETTY, As for this dongle emulator fix it is only for small bugs that have occured such as when manually drawing envelopes as said below in the NFO, not a fix for all the wingeing that some peoples machines are doing such as it wont install whatsoever, i just dont believe that some people follow the install information that Air were good enough to give us in the first place, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ORIGINAL AIR INFO AND THEN FOLLOW THEM IN THE COMMAND PROMPT THAT APPEARS.
Anyway to me there have only been two teams who have been good enough to break this program properly since Atari, H20 and Air, many thanks to both of them cos personaly i dont know what the protection even was let alone how to go about breaking it. Anyone new to 64bit o/s sytems like me, just have a look inside c: and notice there are 2 program file folders one for 64bit apps and one for 32bit apps ie: program files x86, if it was'nt for this we would'nt have many 3rd party programs to use, because most things are still mainly 32bit apps anyway."

I have XP and when I installed it and everything seemed to work fine except when I try to reopen a saved project, I also cant cant open any other presets except Empty project.... It's like they didnt install...... Now i gave the same copy I gotr from here to my buddy and he installed it on his laptop and he has no issues, everything is there.... he can save, export, open up all the presets, and reopen saved projects..... Now I loaded it on my laptop as well just to see if I might have the same issues and everything is there, like mu buddy in can save, open up all the presets, and reopen a saved project..... It works great on my laptop with no issues....... In addition to this when first opening Cubase it gets stuck on Baios and an error message pops up "" exception processing message c00000a3 parameters 75b6bf7c 4 75b6bf7c 75b6bf7c""....... Can anyone help with this issue? or should I change OS to Vista or 7? any feedback would be helpful ...... Thanks "

,Diego9013,2010-09-14T15:44Z,"Ok, it seems to work, but some errors remain.

I use Windows 7 32bits.

The Team AiR Setup Launcher didn't work for me, so I installed it manually. I first ran ""CD:\Install\Cubase5"", then the Cubase patch, and the ""c5emu"".

I tried a first time to run Cubase and many errors appeared. I came back into the ""Install"" folder and launched manually every .exe files (like GM_Drum_Set, HALionOne, etc...)
I tried a second time, and it was better, but there still was some errors...

IMPORTANT : FAT32 partition doesn't support single files > 4Go. That's maybe the reason why some people got problems with Deamons tools or other program. You need to extract on a NTFS partition.

Thanks to the uploader"

The fact that it works on most people's computers shows that for anyone it doesn't work for, they need to sort out their Windows environment or whatever. Basically if there was anything wrong with it then it wouldn't work for anyone. I've been using it for a week now and it's all fine. It hasn't crashed or frozen once.

Much respect to AiR. This is much appreciated."

,bringmethenoise,2011-04-13T01:03Z,"I know this page has way more of peoples' problems than their solutions, but I'd appreciate some help (I'll keep it brief):

After having installed it successfully and running the .exe, the Cubase loading screen (if you can call it that) appears as normal, telling me about components that it's 'initializing'. However, after doing so, it begins to initialize every other file in my Downloads folder as a 'VST 2.x Plugin'.

Not only this but at particular intervals an error appears:

""Runtime Error!

Program: C:\Program Files\Steinberg\Cubase 5\Cubase5.exe

R6034
An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly. Please contact the application's support team for more information.""


Any suggestions?"

and i am using windows 7 64bit - some comments said it wouldnt work. but its working fine for me.

i have been on it for 12 hours, after 5 mins of using it crashed when i loaded my (believe it or not) legit copy of battery 3. but it hasnt crashed once since and all features are included. have had loads of legit komplete vst's like massive and absynth and it has been fine.

After downloading (I have download everything, including the c5emu thingy) PATCH everything. I used MagicISO so I could see every file in order.

INSTALLING TUTORIAL:
1.mount into MagicISO or any program you would like.
2. go to install folder and then activate ""Cubase5.msi""->that should install everything.
3. run ""c5emu.exe"" to download that emulator you all talking about.
4. run ""Cubase_Patch_510.msp"" to patch anything.
5. I didn't get what to do with the ""Setup.exe"", so I just ran it and did nothing biggy. just showing me some console screen.
6. Run Cubase 5. If you have any pop-up warning, just skip it. I didn't understand why is it showing.
7. Enjoy, this should work!"
