Release Notes:

Dreamkiller is a shooter that takes players inside the world
of dark and twisted nightmares. Gamers take on the role of
Alice Drake, a psychologist with the extraordinary ability to
enter the minds of her patients and combat the ravenous foes
haunting their dreams. Utilizing a host of fantastic weapons
and her own special abilities, Alice confronts our common
demons only to discover an even deeper menace reigns within.
The ultimate showdown becomes inevitable between that which
would torment and she who will protect, and only one force
will prevail amidst a variety of dreamscapes as varied and
bizarre as the human mind itself.

The world of dreams and nightmares allows for each level to be
a completely different environment with different sets of
enemies

In each dream world players can enter a secondary level of the
subconscious a world within a world and encounter new
enemies, weapons and power-ups

Players can use Alice's teleportation powers to quickly zoom
around rooms to dodge enemies and achieve a tactical advantage
over enemies

Alice's weapons are massive and fierce, each featuring two
unique attacks and outlandish ammunition including lightning
bolts, lasers, sticky grenades and even "Happy Thoughts."
