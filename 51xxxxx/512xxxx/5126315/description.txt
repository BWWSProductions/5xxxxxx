Nine Dragons
A South L.A. liquor-store murder investigation gets personal for Michael Connelly's popular hero Harry Bosch in NINE DRAGONS. It feels like Bosch has known John Li, the owner of Fortune Liquor, forever. His murder seems at first like a senseless killing, but quickly proves more complicated, as Bosch and his team uncover connections to a local member of a Hong Kong mafia crew. So when word reaches Bosch that his daughter--who lives in Hong Kong with her mother--is missing, he doesn't miss a beat getting across the globe. He journeys deep into this unknown city, stopping at nothing to bring her to safety.
