This is the last ever filmed piano recital of Vladimir Horowitz. Recorded on 31 May 1987 in Vienna in the Great Hall of the Wiener Musikverein. This is certainly one of the finest concerts he gave during his last tour, with outstanding highlights being the Schumann Kinderszenen and Chopin's Heroic Polonaise. Sound quality is rather amazing, projecting the famous Horowitz sonorities to an astounding degree.
