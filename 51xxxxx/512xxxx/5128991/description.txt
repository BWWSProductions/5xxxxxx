2009 debut album from the 2008 X-Factor winner.

With a willfully mischievous glint in her eye, 21 year old Alexandra Burke is sitting on one of the hottest Pop debuts of the decade. From the rumbling first bars of her Sci-Fi Disco stormer single 'Bad Boys', to the Red One-fashioned Dancehall groove of 'Dumb', Alexandra's A-list produced "Overcome" is a party monster of a record, poised to knock the socks off even the most cynical Pop enthusiast.

Recorded over six months, "Overcome" is a collection of club smashes ('All Night,' 'Dumb,' 'Broken Heals') peppered with astonishingly soul-bearing slow jams ('Silence,' 'Perfect.') Created with the help of perhaps the industries most in demand production houses (Roc Nation and Jay-Z, The Phantom Boyz, Red One, Stargate and The Freemasons) the album is a sonic manifestation of Alexandra's ballsy personality, with the lady herself describing the collection as 'a beast'.
