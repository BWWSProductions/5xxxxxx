,killbush,2009-10-19T23:46Z,"@ GAZZA2008, that's not cool to reveal the ending. Anyway it was a stupid film. 5/10 at best"
,Castrob,2009-10-20T03:33Z,10/9 cool movie!
,anonim1979,2009-10-21T06:10Z,"Use GSpot program to check ( http://www.headbands.com/gspot/ ) :
""Multipart OpenDML AVI (3 parts), ""rec list"" style
(216 frames in first part, 136783 frames follow)
Interleave: 755 ms (18.1 v.frames), preload=192""


Wont play properly in MANY standalone DIVX/XVID players.
Multipart = PROBLEM
- Most standalones will only play first part (216 frames = about 9 seconds)!
Some media players on PC will also play sound only for first part. 

To fix:

Download and run VirtualDubMod ( http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/virtualdubmod/VirtualDubMod_1_5_10_2_All_inclusive.zip )

1. Open movie file:
""File"", ""Open video file"" (or use Ctrl+O shortcut), then browse to dir with YOUR_MOVIE.avi

(2. If asked: choose and press NO to question on the begining asking you to ""correct"" VBR MP3 audio.)

3. ""File"", Save as (or simply press F7)

Put new name and/or directory
!BEFORE clicking SAVE: CHANGE(Video)""Video mode"" to ""Direct stream copy""
Done in 1-2 minutes!"
