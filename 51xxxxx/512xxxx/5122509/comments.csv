,kingmonk,2009-12-02T04:48Z,Big ass virus. You are the biggest prick alive. Thanks for messing my laptop up dick. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT.

,EricksHinumaru,2009-12-22T07:43Z,"Hmm... nobody would happen to know where I could get a crack so that I don't have to put in the key code every time I start up the game, would they?"
,MintySurpriseOYA,2010-01-01T20:41Z,"Kingmonk, you are a noob. The virus is probably the keygen and as anyone with a half a pirate brain knows that all keygens are viruses. If it messes up your laptop then you should have better virus protection software. "
,RedDemon1970,2010-01-27T18:14Z,"well you can run it in a virtual session...but disable then the network card of your session..then it worked

pretty good game btw"

,jolle747,2010-04-15T17:57Z,"kingmonk, youre the biggest idiot alive, do not blame VIP or Trusted people on ThePirateBay ! Blame yourself, youre too nooby to install the game."
,killer358,2010-06-26T02:02Z,even if a crack or keygen is not a virus it is inclined to show up as one kingmonk use your brain
,-Bullet,2010-07-04T17:55Z,I would appreciate it if someone would post tropico 3 + dlc direct play download link
,madeofparts,2011-01-08T18:05Z,"There is a torrent here:

,VORONGM,2011-03-27T15:16Z,Thanks for the good game...
,Cgoff87,2011-04-09T03:49Z,"Works flawlessly on windows 7 64x after applying the updates and installing the expansion... but mayn, the graphics rendering is alot more advanced than I thought it would be. Its a major upgrade compared to the previous Tropicos.

but yes it works, thumbs up!

For those having trouble just follow-the-directions and you'll have it up in no time!!

And if you are recieving an error related to direct x like say dx3_dx42.dll you have to install the previous components of direct 9 because alot of new computers don't come with it all.

To do this explore the tropico disc and look for the folder that contains a bunch of rars with dates which is the directx9 archive needed to run the game. In there will be an installer, just run and install and youll be good to go."

3)STRUCTURE to STRUCTURES"
,kanadianking,2011-06-08T19:56Z,"When fully downloaded, everything worked perfectly fine except for the gameplay itself. When starting up a game the buildings are invisible and the ocean view is all black and messed up itself. Its almost like everything is under water?? So then I successfully installed all the patch work and still the same problems.  :S   restarted the computer and same thing.. fiddled with the visuals option and same thing... re-installed and same thing...

,nippitta,2011-07-03T02:10Z,Please excuse my noob-ness but how do I avoid the same fate as Kingmonk? 
,zwigli,2011-07-04T17:04Z,"@nippitta
LOL, dont go to free porn sites XD
your anti-virus may signal a virus but there is none, you cant avoid it since there is nothing to be avoided"
,Millor1,2011-07-29T00:23Z,"Confirming that this works... mount and install, unplug the internet cord from the back of your PC, run the game, put in the key given in the readme, and after it fails connecting to the internet and takes you to the main menu, your free to plug your internet back in and continue playing."
,huldu,2011-08-09T13:56Z,"Installed game. Offline. Enter key, it tries connect, it fails. Now I'm stuck in the ""intro"" being played in the background with no menu appearing. I have no idea how to fix this problem. "
,cami159,2011-08-24T23:27Z,Game 100 % work. Thx :)
,freshtilldeath,2011-09-26T13:41Z,thanks for the virus you cunt !
,Bowen69,2012-04-08T15:02Z,"freshtilldeath, I think you will find you are the cunt my friend... If you had any clue about anything that has ever happened you would know 2 things... Morgan freeman is awesome and this game does not contain viruses... I have checked this over several times and obviously you AV is giving false results... just read some of the other comments, then say sorry to the uploader..."
,Virgene,2012-04-30T19:24Z,"Hey guys, I followed the comments above about unplugging the internet and typing in the cd key and it worked fine but everytime I start up the game it asked for the cd key again. Is that suppose to happen or is there another way?"
