,kevin_c6699,2011-02-27T11:55Z,"good audio/video quality,
i found a different subtitle file online,
the one that came with the torrent didn't work, it showed some kind of weird symbols

the first two wrong turn movies were good,
the third one finally crashed.........
frontal nudity to start off the movie,
then it's boring boring boring all the way to the end,
nice little twist in the end though,

thanks for sharing,"
