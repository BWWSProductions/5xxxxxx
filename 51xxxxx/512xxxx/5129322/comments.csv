,Pistyman,2011-12-31T23:05Z,Can you please upload more from the boxwrench set?
,MacTee,2012-02-27T21:21Z,The video is really jumpy.  It may just be a faulty download on my end.  Is it jumpy for anyone else?
,millsy,2012-04-10T10:49Z,"MacTee : adjust your grafix  settings before playing or burning the dvd, i had this problem last night but i found that if i turned off my (geometry instancing) setting in the grafix menu, all was good after. hope this helps.

Is there a chance of more boxwrench dvds 80hd?"
