[T],brodahisou,2009-10-15T09:01Z,"Jack Kirby was told by the DC editors he had to put a Deadman crossover into his book The Forever People.  He didn't actually want to.   So he obligingly included him in The Forever People 9 and 10.  

Upon reading the Neal Adams issues to understand the character, Kirby noticed something that had apparently slipped by everyone else. In the origin story, The Hook has his hook on his right hand. Yet in the penultimate Neal Adams story the man we think is Hook has his hook on his left hand.  This was probably just an artist's error in the final Neal Adams story, as in the synopsis of the previous issue, the hook is back on the right hand again.  Kirby, however, uses this clue to reopen the case of Deadman, with the real Hook one among many one-handed men who work for an organization known as ""The Scavengers"".  

So you may scoff at Deadman being in The Forever People Dipsyskrull, but I think Kirby did really well with a character that he was forced to use."
