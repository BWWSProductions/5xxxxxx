,andy72184,2009-10-14T22:55Z,"yeah its just something extra to to get to play these damn MKV formats.
Always something."
[T],xybrite,2009-10-18T05:29Z,"I use and love .mkv

I watch .mkv using a Western Digital WDTV on my HDTV.

I also watch the shows on my computers using vlc media player.

.mkv, the open source standards, totally rocks!

I am disappointed that I cannot find a .mkv of this episode anywhere around the web."
,mkt,2009-10-19T08:11Z,"Sorry, but MKV is NOT a standard. It's a sucky open source project that only a few companies feel like supporting partially. Because you can't set a strict standard, and because they update stuff all the time, it's a waste of money to invest in it. Even your TV-player won't be able to play all MKV episodes. "

@attackinghampster
Even thought it my be hard to believe there are mature persons who uses real computers unlike you.Actually they are the who makes this shit avaible at first place?Do you think this website is hosted of ps or something?
Mkv is awsome and nothing going to change because it don't work of some shitty gaming console.Go play games kid on your toy, when you are ready to use a real computer you might understand.

@mkt
it might not be a strict standard but what is? and its closest format to being standard.
Also investing in open source never is waste, even it doesn't makes a huge difference today you are opening way to dozens of possible future projects"
,mkt,2009-10-19T20:22Z,"Dex2: We don't use shitty computers. We use TV-devices, so that we can enjoy the shows how they were supposed to. Eg, not watching it on a Windows-PC with a 22"" screen, but on a 32""+ TV. MKV is the least user friendly container there is, and as long as the big guys won't make a standard for it, it's still gonna be shit. Not everyone has a 1000 Euro media-center, so at least accept that a few of us prefer MP4. It's less trouble, and we can be sure that the content will work in the future too.

Open source is great in theory, but it doesn't work in a consumer market where people don't ""know"" how to do everything. That's one of the reasons why GNU/linux can't get a grasp of the market. Since MKV is also mixed with software that requires you to run windows at this current moment, it's tag is irrelevant, despite being good in theory. "
,johnniebrasco,2009-10-31T16:32Z,"have you heard about plugging the pc to a hdtv? very possible, thats what i do, and i prefer mkv, anyway, when i can't find that, this is the next best! Thanks for you upload mkt!"
,Tomato9876,2010-03-18T00:13Z,"Only think holding your episodes back, mkt, is no surround sound. Please try to include 5.1 channel AAC"
