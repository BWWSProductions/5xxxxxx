,ZeNiTH_NL,2009-10-18T10:47Z,"Cant download torrents any more from thepiratebay. Im using a ""KPN telecom"" provider in Holland... 
Tried another computer too..
They probably blocked transfers from ""torrents.thepiratebay.org"" because the website works.
Also wget from a linux command console does not do the job. Real strange. 
Can any one verify this with the same provider?"
