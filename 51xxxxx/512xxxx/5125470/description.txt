Artist Bio: 
Created in early 2007, the Adronus Project does not cater to any one style of music. Influences range from Ambient and Drone to Electronic with some Alternative and Jazz undertones in places, though he predominant style is Ambient, most songs ranging from 9 - 30 minutes in length.
Each song represents a piece of the artists soul at that particular point in time. Every song is spiritual in nature, as music is spiritual and should be experienced as such.
Artists who make music solely for the purpose of â€œmaking it bigâ€ are no longer musicians but whores to money and fame. Music should be used as a form of expression. It should be treated as an avenue for the expression of emotion, faith, and, when present, talent in some form.
