You could have just used Xvid in HD .avi format and had a smaller size plus looked the same and work on More players Why place this in x264?
And did you really need to set 640kbps on the audio bit rate for this? i mean you can't even tell other then taking up space. 192kbps or even 128kbps would have done just fine.

But i guess it's better then the other rip that's out there =)  Stil upset over the misleading title."
,golliwogg420,2010-12-04T13:47Z,@ zzk2001 show some appreciation for the uploader
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-07T15:50Z,"It IS 720p, and anyone suggesting AVI would be better knows nothing and is living in the past."
,x_only_match,2010-12-11T17:29Z,well I guess I just don't know how to use these files . to me it looks like they are rar or something. couldn't get vlc to play this. could not get anything to convert it either.
