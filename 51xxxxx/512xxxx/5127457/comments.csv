,flyspitter,2009-11-29T23:42Z,"That song Rosyln is freakin awesome.  Thanks.

I've listened to Bon Iver's other music and was a bit disappointed though.  Iron & Wine from the first album is pretty awesome though."

All I Believe In - THE MAGIC NUMBERS"
[V],LosslessDude,2010-03-26T17:03Z,"agreed, rosyln is amazing..."
,Notanumbnut,2010-07-31T11:56Z,"Sorry Bubanee but this copy is horrible!
Jumps, pops and stutters all the way through.
Just 'cos it is FLAC it still has to be ripped carefully like anything else. I am not complaining so keep up the good work but maybe listen before you upload? Respect."
,arados,2011-03-02T23:21Z,All I Believe In - THE MAGIC NUMBERS is a bonus track...
