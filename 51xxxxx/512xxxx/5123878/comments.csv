,0maddox,2009-10-19T09:01Z,"I really think this is awsome.
One thing though, Crystar #5, and Power Man and Iron Fist v 1 #93 
have Brocken Archive errors. 
I tried pulling those two twice now and I get the same error.
Are the files damaged? "
[T],dimlan,2009-12-18T05:32Z,"Omaddox, do you mean the message ""files missing from checksum list""? If you press okay you can read the comic as normal.

Or is there some other problem?"
