FULL NITRO SNOWBOARDS 2010


here is a word from Nitro: "We decided to call the movie ESPERANTO due to the mix of languages that we always speak when we are on the road. It was basically a trip around the world, from China, to Norway, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Austria, Italy, Switzerland to the US.

The final movie ESPERANTO is kind of a travelstory of the European Team where the impressions of each country we travelled to are shown in details."
