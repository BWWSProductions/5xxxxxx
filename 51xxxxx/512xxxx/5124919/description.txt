Heroes Chapter Five: Hysterical Blindness

Tonight's focus is on Claire, the Petrellis, Sylar, and the carnies.

We pick up where we left off with Sylar busting out of his shallow grave. He staggers down the road bloody, dirty, and confused. A cop, played by Ernie Hudson, pulls up beside him, takes in his appearance and arrests him.

At the station Sylar can't remember anything from who he is or how he got into the woods. Ernie Hudson wants to beat it out of him but he brings in a psychiatrist, Dr. Gibson, who for some reason is British. She's all touchy feely and wants to help Sylar figure out who he is. She cleans him up, gives him some tea, and starts having him do memory exercises. As he closes his eyes he can hear that the clock on the wall and her watch are out of phase. She thinks he's had a traumatic experience and his mind isn't allowing him to process it.
