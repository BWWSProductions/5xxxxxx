It's being shipped right now, but can't wait for this!
Waited for this to come out since the first time it was announced, listened to newly released songs on their Myspace-page all the time and don't sound like a big let-down like Soilworks last album was... "

That's not a huge plus in my book.

The sound, so far isn't bad. But seriously, that one song is going to piss people like me off :/"
