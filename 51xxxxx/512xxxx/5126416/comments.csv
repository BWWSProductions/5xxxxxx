THE PODCAST IS A KEEPER"
,booboo332,2009-10-16T07:16Z,"The NFL lets rapists, wife beaters, animal torturers, violators of gun safety laws and other scum into the organization but won't let a radio talkshow host be a minor investor?  Regardless of what you think of his politics, Rush is a champion for the freedom of speech and this bullshit will gain him the sympathies of those who don't usually agree with him.

Limbaugh may be republican mouthpiece and close minded about some issues but the way the democrats and race and poverty pimps like Sharpton and Jackson have gotten involved exposes their hypocrisy and true colors.  This may make twits like little trick happy but it will not help the Democrats in the long run.

Penn Jillette nailed it when he dubbed the Republicans the party of fear and the Democrats the party of hate.  Fear may be a problem but you can understand it, hate on the other hand is just poison."
,crassiusmufumbu,2009-10-16T22:46Z,Thanks for the Podcast!!!! Dropping Limbaugh from the NFL will just make him more popular. It amazes that these people in Government are attacking a private citizen with a very successful business who can't pass any laws...just because he disagrees with them....makes them look like the bunch of arrogant fascist pussies they truly are.
