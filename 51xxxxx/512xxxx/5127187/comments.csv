,jelmartz17,2009-10-17T12:48Z,bone if you have the stargazing: a graphic guide to heavens a documentary thou sounds weird pls kindly upload.
,godswallops,2009-10-18T18:34Z,"Wow, this is rather ordinary.

The ""science"" is so far from reality that it becomes a comedy. Cliches abound in a story that lacks a story line.

The scientist's wife is hot - that helps! :p

... and 6 Russian sailors can lift two 50 megaton nuclear warheads that somehow fit in a 5 tonne truck .... O K.

,tinuviel949,2009-10-20T06:51Z,"imdb has this listed as ""tv""-is this a movie or what"
,Highwired,2009-10-21T14:33Z,"50 mega tons describes the blast force not the weight! Megaton is millions of tons of TNT. Two 50 mega ton bombs not loaded in ICBMs would easily fit a 5ton truck. The Russians called those bombs Czar Bomba. Ez to find out online. The delivery system is what weighs a lot, not the fissle material. Research it!"
