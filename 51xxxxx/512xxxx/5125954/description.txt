Coast to coast AM, Oct 14 full untouched stream .rm files

This torrent contains 16 files - each in .rm format directly downloaded from premiere Radio Network servers via download managers.


Note - since this is a full stream which streamlink members can access, bumper music is also included! 

Each show ranges from part 0 to part 15. every 4 parts represents a full hour (while parts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 represent half hours). This is actually how the stream is layed out - not my doing!

I might consider joining the .rm files - but this way you get the full untouched stream.

Please do consider joining streamlink if you want full coast to coast membership and member benefits such as the biweekly chat sessions with George. 


Remember that I am on a dial-up server, so if you don't seed, then poof goes this torrent. So be kind, be nice -- and seed!

Shows included in this release:
Wednesday 10-14-09: Interpreting 2012
Host:
 George Noory
 
Guests:
 John Major Jenkins, Dr. Gillian Holloway 
 


Researcher John Major Jenkins discussed how the early Maya devised their Long Count calendar which ends in 2012, the various ways the 2012 idea has been interpreted, and historical and cultural aspects of Mayan society. There is no evidence that the Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012, rather their calendar, which they created about 2,000 years ago, was pointing toward the alignment of the sun with the galactic center or "dark rift," he detailed. The Mayans were oriented to cyclic traditions, and the ending of their calendar in 2012 signified an emphasis on transformation and renewal rather than doomsday, he continued. 


In 1966, scholar Michael D. Coe first proposed the idea there could be cataclysmic events tied to end of the Mayan calendar in December 2012. But Coe's Armageddon-styled interpretation was seen through the biases of his Judeo/Christian background, Jenkins argued. 


One of the few surviving Mayan books (most were destroyed during the Conquest) was the Dresden Codex, which contained sophisticated and accurate astronomical charts and a calendar of Venus' cycles. The planet, which changes from the Evening Star to the Morning Star over time, was incorporated into Mayan mythology in legends like Quetzalcoatl that invoke sacrifice, death, and rebirth, said Jenkins. He also spoke about the roots of shamanism in ancient Maya-- their High King was a shaman who would take sacred plants, to travel between this world and the supernatural realm, to bring back knowledge.





Dreams & After Death Communication 



Last hour guest, Dr. Gillian Holloway talked about after-death communications via a dreaming research project, precognitive dreams, and dream interpretation. Regarding interpretation, she looks at the action of the dream, rather than dream symbols, to provide allegorical information about a person's life. Contact with deceased loved ones in dreams can have a very different quality than regular dreams, where the departed person might say 'I know you're dreaming, but this is real,' she noted. Dr. Holloway is collecting additional accounts of dream communications with the dead at adcdreams@gmail.com.
