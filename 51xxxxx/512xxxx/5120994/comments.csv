It plays in WMP, MPC and VLC without any problems. If you can't play it you need to update your codecs. As this file is a normal avi, I think it might be like this; there is the possibility that you didn't extracted the rars, as it is possible to play with VLC, but it is impossible to do that with MPC and WMP.
If that is the case you should get a program called winrar that you can find here on TPB"
