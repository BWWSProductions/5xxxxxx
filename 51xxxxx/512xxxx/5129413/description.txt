From Wikipedia: "The Uneventful Vacation is an album released by indie rock band Commander Venus in 1997. The album was recorded during the summer of the band's freshman year in high school. Despite the album being rushed into recording over summer vacation, and the band experiencing tension between themselves and their producer, the album was considered a mild success, and gained popularity over college airplay. Fans of the album claimed that Commander Venus could be "the next big thing" out of Omaha. The Uneventful Vacation continues to gain popularity even today as fans of Bright Eyes discover Conor Oberst's older material."

Enjoy :)
