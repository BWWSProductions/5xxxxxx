Darryl Hannah does her best as a tortured meteorologist whose tragic past leads to her to risk her life tracking hurricanes, but the plot is slow to start and bad but not even so bad it's laughable.

Most of the action takes place on board the plane so badly made it falls to pieces doing the job it is supposed to be suitable for, while on the ground the director of the National Storm Center refuses to heed her warnings (for a director of such a facility he seems unable to understand the significance of the data he's sent her to collect and unwilling to listen to anyone else's analysis of it).
