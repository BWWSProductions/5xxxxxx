After a man is bitten by a werewolf, he discovers thats the least of his worries. He finds himself in the middle of a full-on war between vampires, werewolves, and human hunters. An exclusive World Premiere supernatural thriller from RHI Entertainment. Described as a superhero-type origin film set in a horror film universe, Jeremy London (â€Party of Fiveâ€, Basilisk: The Serpent King) stars as the heroic werewolf who will have to save the world from a Nazi vampire cult leader played by a sword-wielding Marc Dacascos (Brotherhood of the Wolf, Drive) and his vampish cohort, Yancy Butler (â€Witchbladeâ€, Hard Target). Rounding out the cast are Christy Carlson Romano (the voice of TVâ€™s â€œKim Possibleâ€) as â€“ Iâ€™m assuming â€“ the heroâ€™s love interest and underrated former Asylum movie regular Rhett Giles as the one and only Van Helsing. Griff Furst (I Am Omega, 100 Million BC) directs. Leigh Scott and Ken Badish (Mansquito) produce.
