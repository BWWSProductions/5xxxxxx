Bakugan tells the story of Dan and his friends as they battle their Bakugan Brawlers to save the planet of Vestroia and, ultimately, Earth from destruction. The series airs on Cartoon Network in the United States and internationally, and on TELETOON in Canada. The toy line, developed by Spin Master Ltd., brings action to the popular genre of collectible trading card games with marble-like Bakugan spheres that transform into â€œbattle brawlingâ€ action figures when rolled onto special game cards.
