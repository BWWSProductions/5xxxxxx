The Ultimate Fighter is the premier reality show on Spike Television. The show is about UFC hopefuls and veterans competing for a UFC contract. For over eight seasons the show has featured not only up and coming UFC stars but the top names in the UFC working as coaches: such as Chuck Liddell, Randy Couture, Tito Ortiz, BJ Penn, Ken Shamrock, Antonio Nogueira, Frank Mir and many others. While the format of the show has changed the one constant thing remains the same a fighter must establish himself in the octagon to be the Ultimate Fighter.
