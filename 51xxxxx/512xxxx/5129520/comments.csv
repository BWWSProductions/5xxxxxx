I will direct my downloaders to move over to your page. I placed your torrent site in the description of my upload.  Hopefully everyone downloading my uploaded show will start downloading yours instead.

I will also download and seed your upload. Thanks a million and keep it up!!!!"

,booboo332,2009-10-20T00:32Z,"Thanks for the show.  This eco-nonsense based global government that the UN is pushing forward is a serious threat to our sovereignty.  Eco-reparations?  Give me a break.  Thank goodness Glenn is exposing these watermelons (green on the outside, red to the core).

However, he does need to get his facts straight on net neutrality and get over the decriminalization of dope.  Net neutrality is not about providing internet access to everyone and prohibition just makes criminals rich and ruins lives.

Pot isn't harmless but in a country with such a liberal attitude towards alcohol, our tax dollars could be better spent than on locking up stoners.  The laws also waste the time and resources of our law enforcement and turn pot into a cash crop for criminals who then use that money to fund ventures in harder drugs and other vile endeavors.  This hacking at the leaves instead of the roots of our problems is a waste of resources and gets us nowhere.

That said, I wouldn't put it past the Dems to use these issues to push forward their underhanded agendas like they have leveraged healthcare, social security and welfare.

At least Glenn encourages his listeners to question his own assertions, unlike the ecofreaks and marxists and their mob mentality."

[T],Quazza,2009-10-20T02:39Z,Had no idea it was up already. Guess I don't need to upload it then.
[T],jwhitt62,2009-10-20T05:42Z,"If I can make a suggestion...you should also upload to Mininova. I upload to both Mininova and The Pirate Bay. Most of the downloaders of Rush know to check my Mininova upload if TPB is not working. 

Just a suggestion...and again, thanks for Glenn!!!"
