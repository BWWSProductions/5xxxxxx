But why was the sound ripped from a cam? What happened to the original R5 sound?

Thanks for the upload BTW, the first R5 I am actually pleased to watch for its quility. +10.

Most likely original sound was only in Russian (or other R5 language)."

Very quiet audio - TV on maximum volume and hard to hear, plus an echo.

Other than that the video quality is excellent.
