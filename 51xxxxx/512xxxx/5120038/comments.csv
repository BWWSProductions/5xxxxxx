,phony9,2009-10-13T02:47Z,"So how are you supposed to use the patch? Anytime I try to patch it, the patcher says ""Can not access the file. Maybe it's in use...""

I don't even know what file it's trying to access."
,zugzug,2009-10-21T20:49Z,"@phony9

Make sure that Google SketchUp is not running when you are trying to patch it. "
,bluesclues,2009-10-23T15:41Z,"@phony9
You might be using Vista as I am, so you have to run the patcher as Administrator. Hope this helps."
,bluesclues,2009-10-23T15:42Z,"@Murlok
Thanks for the upload. Working great."
,oliver83,2009-11-01T21:23Z,Any chance you would have Irender nXt plugin for sketchup!?!? would be much appreciated!
,carlomia,2009-11-03T21:45Z,"i run patch when sketchup is not active buy it doesnt work ?
why ?"
,tylerwatt12,2009-11-21T00:20Z,"BULLSHIT! There is a virus embedded into the program, luckily its easy to delete before the virus gets run. 1. get winrar (most of you already have it) 2. right click on the EXE and click extract to ""GoogleSketchUpProWEN\"" now open the new folder made. you should see 3 files, delete setup.exe(its a virus because its about 600kb and no installation program is that small) now you can open googlesketchup7.msi

any questions?
contact tylerwatt12@gmail.com"
,knownassociate,2009-11-24T20:02Z,"@tylerwatt12>I don't know you, but I do know Murloks work. The only times someone reported any virus that I'm aware of, were by people using 
AVG. ....are you using AVG, btw? :P

I'll be seeding this with the other 163 people already enjoying what looks to be a very cool program!"
,Jimbo461,2009-12-08T08:03Z,Having trouble with SketchUp...downloaded and opened file with WinRAR...ran patch as Administrator(WinXP)got a cow on the screen with yes and no button below...hit the yes button...had text appearing that application patched...then ran Sketchup install...(the installation ended up downloading some files from Windows re.NET compabability) ...then opened program...hit licence tab...typed anything as instructed and got error..Invalid serial number...I'm new to this game so grateful for any advice
,Jimbo461,2009-12-08T08:12Z,Re. tom-mai 78101instructions...#2 says run crack as administrator...what does this actually mean...I ran the patch as admininistrator and then installed the program when logged on in my usual user name
,santasa99,2009-12-11T12:27Z,"Fak this ! I can't register program, it say ""Invalid serial number"", so what a fak this Patch doing anyway ?
Someone making a stupid joke. "
,Baz2017,2009-12-13T03:39Z,"I have same problem; it says ""Invalid serial number"" when I add values in Add Licence fileds. Please help.

,kelbizzle,2009-12-24T17:36Z,"I had the same problems as everyone else....until I followed these instructions. I have x64 windows 7. It works. Thanks for the up.


1. Download.
2. Run crack as administrator.
3. Patch it.
4. Run Google Sketchup 7.1.
5. Go to License tab.
6. Add New License.
7. Type in anything in the forms.
8. You have been licensed"
,tfm_copycat,2009-12-29T00:13Z,"Patch adds adware/virus to the sketchup exe, I don't use crappy freeware antivirus, both kaspersky and bitdefender got it."
,Jimbo461,2009-12-30T06:05Z,I am still confused...what does it mean to run Crack as administrator...(administrator bit fine!)...does running the crack mean running the program  sketchuo.exe or the patch or something else I am missing...thanks for any help
,ariz69,2010-01-01T06:01Z,"thank you for uploading this program, it was easy installing."
,fooled-again,2010-01-20T12:51Z,"patch generates window with picture of cow and question: ""Is there something terribly wrong with this country?"" Whatever you answer, you don't get a patched exe."
,GolemdX,2010-01-24T21:38Z,"@tfm_copycat, there is absolutely no problem with this torrent, or would Murlok still have that 'Trusted' image next to his name? Freeware/Open source things aren't necessarily bad, and paid ones can purposely report keygens if they're against piracy, or if they detect the keygen modifies a file (which it in fact, does)."
,NonUploadingPornAddict,2010-02-01T20:35Z,"OK JUST TO MAKE THIS CLEAR:
1. extract RAR
2. Install using SETUP file
3. Run the PATCHER. 
4. Click ""Add license"" and TYPE whatever you want into the 3 boxes.

If you are having TROUBLE:
make sure it has finished installing and you haven't opened it before patching. you MUST have allowed it to install to it's default directory.

If you are an administrator of the computer right click the patcher and click RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. if you are not admin, perhaps your admin has blocked the application, therefore there is nothing you can do.

It is working for ME, there are no VIRUSES on my computer, so therefore it must be you, not the torrent so think twice before pointing fingers. (to those who haven't pointed fingers, sorry to be so aggressive). (kelbizzle and tom_mai, your guides are WRONG. take them down.)"
,hurokfxu,2010-03-02T04:37Z,"scanned with AVG, no viruses

As said by kelbizzle:

1. Download.
2. Run crack as administrator.
3. Patch it.
4. Run Google Sketchup 7.1.
5. Go to License tab.
6. Add New License.
7. Type in anything in the forms.
8. You have been licensed.

There's no NFO files included, so it was kind of hard to find out how to be licensed the first time. "
,scabone4,2010-03-04T23:22Z,"I've downloaded the file fine, and now have the software in trial version.  But I cannot find the patch.  What does it look like and where do I find it?  Please help.  Thanks."
,scabone4,2010-03-04T23:27Z,"I'm sorry, how do you run the crack?  I can't find the crack or the patch.  Much thanks!"
,scabone4,2010-03-04T23:33Z,"I know I am bordering on being annoying,  But I finally got it.  Download the file, then make sure sketchup is not running.  Run the patch (found it) and seriously, type in anything, as I did.  Hit get license and walla!  "
,Tullmann1,2010-03-14T12:11Z,"Hi!
Do NOT install this.
It create DISK:\User\\AppData\Roaming\setupv.exe
It is identified by Microsoft Security Essentials that it is WIN32/LODOMO.H."
,Max.B,2010-05-01T19:33Z,I haven't used Sketchup since version 3 but this patch seems to work great. Thank you :)
,skyshaper_,2010-05-15T09:52Z,"those instructions were crap. Please think before typing misleading information.

1. Download
2. Install Sketchup
3. Run the patch as administrator
4. Run Sketchup
5. Go to License tab.
6. Add New License.
7. Type in anything in the forms.

,Morph96,2010-06-09T20:01Z,trojan horse in the patch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,thebigmbg,2010-06-18T18:58Z,is it really neccery to patch this to gain full pro acces..? help some1
,thebigmbg,2010-06-19T00:39Z,i have just downloded it and tryed 2 install it is again downloading some file is it right..?
,mikedeerf,2010-06-27T06:06Z,"It CAN be installed somewhere other than the default - just when you run the patch, it will initially say that it failed to find the file.  Choose the ""browse"" and go to wherever you installed it and pick the sketchup.exe file.  The patch will then apply successfully.  At least it worked for me.  YMMV"
,Iceman00789,2010-07-02T01:27Z,It's been a pain in the butt for me. I had do disable AVG before I did anything. And I always trust your uploads.
,Iceman00789,2010-07-02T01:28Z,"I guess I should add ""It Worked!"""
,Wyane,2010-07-11T11:34Z,"very simple to use,wait my anti virus software that is endorsed by anti piracy groups says somethings a virus and stuff....how dare you reverse engineer the code to give a false flag.hehehe works fine everyone that\'s having issues should just throw there PC in the trash.It\'s obvious they cant use itnand should stick to smart phones and Ipods,they are a little more advanced than a 386 SX 33Mhz but you get the idea."
,oakland6980,2010-08-01T01:23Z,anyone one try updating to the current version. 7.1 M2?
