Tony Horton's 10 Minute Trainer

The secret behind my 10-Minute Training system is my breakthrough Super Stacking Techniqueâ„¢ using resistance bands. I combined the most effective moves I know into each 10-minute workout. Here's how it works: instead of starting with your cardio, then working your different body parts one at a time like most long workouts, I stack them, so you get your fat-burning cardio, total-body toning and sculpting, and abs workouts at the same timeâ€”in just 10 minutes, from start to finish! Not a second is wasted! It's multitasking for your muscles! Give yourself 10 minutes. You deserve it. And best of all, I bet when you're done, you'll want to do another 10-minute workout. And you know what that means . . . better, faster results!
