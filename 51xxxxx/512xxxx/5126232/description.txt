My Chemical Romance:I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.
__________________________________________________________________________

My Chemical Romance are another in the swarm of hard-edged, emo-tinged 
punk-pop bands flooding the market of the early-to-mid 2000s, working firmly 
in a post-hardcore musical vein that doesn't rule out sensitivity and inspection.
 
On I BROUGHT YOU MY BULLETS, YOU BROUGHT ME YOUR LOVE, the band's debut, 
My Chemical Romance shows that they don't fool around on either count. 

Bolstered by chugging, crunching guitars, pulse-quickening rhythms, and passionate, anthemic melodies straight from the alt-rock rulebook, MCR unleashes a blistering intensity that encourages raised, clenched fists, while incorporating elements of nu metal and punk with surprising skill.

Lead singer Gerard Way has a way with words, and I BROUGHT YOU MY BULLETS 
also serves as a tour through the bleaker corridors of the human spirit. 
Way's angst-infused vocals and lyrics about loneliness, anger, substance abuse, 
and alienation, prove MCR is fully able to articulately explore the dark side. 
The combination of thoughtful, expressive themes and pounding, no-nonsense rock buries MCR's softer, bedsitting emo brethren any day of the week, and promises good things to come from this New Jersey outfit.
