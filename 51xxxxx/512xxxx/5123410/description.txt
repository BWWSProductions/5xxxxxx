Zenith (Robert MacDowell) is a British superhero, who appeared in the science fiction comic 2000 AD. Created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Steve Yeowell, with original character designs by Brendan McCarthy, he first appeared in 2000 AD #536 (22 August 1987).

Shallow and sarcastic, Zenith was a distinctly Generation X superhero. Morrison used the Zenith serial to explore cultural differences between generations and make jabs at the Conservative Party.

Zenith was featured regularly in 2000 AD from 1987 until 1992, with occasional appearances since. The series was an early success for Grant Morrison, a future comics superstar with the Doom Patrol, Animal Man, The Invisibles, JLA and more epic cross over events than you could shake an alternate earth at.

Speaking of alternate Earths, Zenith draws from Talbot and Vance with additional helpings of chaos theory, fractal geometry, Crisis on Infinite Earths and Lovecraft. Where Hellboy lets pulp meet the mythos, Zenith combines dark cosmic forces with superheroes. The off kilter superheroes of British comic history are also dusted off and have rarely looked better.

"I'm nineteen, I can fly, I can flatten ballbearings between my fingers and I'm practically invulnerable to damage. What can possibly go wrong?"

This torrent collects all four phases of the Zenith story including the uncollected fourth phase and interludes. This is a torrent I downloaded ages ago and didnâ€™t see here. All praises to the original scanners & uppers!
