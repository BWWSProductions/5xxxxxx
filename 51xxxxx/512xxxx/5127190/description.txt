Mark, Janice and their young daughter Julie have lived in their home
about two months. Strange things begin to happen, first just annoying
then becoming terrifying. Television sets go on and off by themselves
strange noises in the attic, movement in the shadows, light bulbs bursting
unexplained voices, terrifying dreams, and dolls that seem to have a mind of
their own. Being a self-sufficient independent do-it-yourself kind of man, Mark
tries to "fix it" with his own resources. Only after being brought to near death
does he realize he needs the power of the Holy Spirit through the authority of Jesus
Christ to rid their home of this malevolent spirit
