This drama by Hungarian New Cinema director Zoltan Fabri is about class exploitation and murder, and is set in 1919. Anna (Mari Torocsik) is a shy and plain young woman who works as a maid in a privileged household. She is essentially a slave without any rights to speak of, and while she is being driven to the extremity of murder because of her brutal and uncaring treatment, the Hungarian communist revolution is building up steam in the background. The microcosm, in this case, is clearly meant to illustrate the impersonal and much larger picture. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guid
