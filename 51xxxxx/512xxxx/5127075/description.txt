From Wiki:



Yes are an English progressive rock band that was formed in London in 1968. Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, extended song lengths, abstract lyrics, and a general showcasing of instrumental prowess. Yes blends symphonic and other 'classical' structures with their own brand of musical style. Despite a great many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band has continued on for over forty years and still retains a large following.[1] Band members Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Alan White toured in late 2008 and early 2009 with vocalist BenoÃ®t David and keyboardist Oliver Wakeman on the In The Present Tour.






Yesyears 1991

Yesyears is a career-spanning collection of music by progressive rock band Yes released as a four-disc box set in 1991. It was compiled following the release of Union and Yes's departure from Atlantic Records, with whom they had been contracted since 1969 (and the offshoot label Atco Records since 1983). Yesyears covers the band's musical story from 1969's debut Yes to studio material recorded with Billy Sherwood following Jon Anderson's departure in 1988.
One of the major attractions of YesYears was its inclusion of rare material, including many previously unreleased songs, and a full-colour booklet detailing Yes's history.
A condensed version of this package, entitled Yesstory, would be released in 1992 on two discs.
Yesyears was deleted in the late 1990s, preceding the release of Rhino Records' (five-disc) box set In a Word: Yes (1969 - ) in 2002. Most of the material found on Yesyears but not on In a word would surface on Rhino's reissues of Yes albums in 2003 and 2004.
