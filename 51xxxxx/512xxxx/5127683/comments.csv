,iamz3r0,2009-10-17T17:54Z,Sorry about that guys. I had some network issues. I'm seeding now!
,Tomgono,2009-10-25T21:02Z,This game doesn't work. Only ISO's work as Xbox games. You can't burn XBE files to disc.
,Tomgono,2009-10-27T06:53Z,"Can you believe it! After spending a few days over the last week and destroying 10 DVDs I managed to get iamz3r0's Halo 2 Xbox (xbe) game working no problems with a self loading DVD5.

Just to let you know how I did it:-

1) Delete dashupdate.xbe, which is unnecessary, to enable the game to fit on a normal DVD5.
2) Delete default.xbe_orig
3) Move default.xbe out of the bink folder to replace default.xbe_orig.
4) Download the Xdvdmulleter Beta 10.2 program with guide.
5) Create an Iso using Xdvdmulleter with the following settings;
a) Select Build/Rebuild an Iso
b) Load from file and select the Halo 2 Xbox folder, as edited in steps 1 to 3 above. (Tick check for cross linkable files).
c) Choose your rebuilding options.
d) Choose region code (All regions).
e) Create Iso.
6) Once Iso is created, click on Iso and burn to disc using Nero.

Anyway my kids are enjoying playing the game now, so thankyou iamz3r0 for the upload!!"
,MiKEaBEE,2009-10-31T03:14Z,"When i try to boot up the game i get a ""dirty disc"" error and i can't boot up the game for nothing. Please help!!"
,SpecOp44,2009-11-12T12:49Z,"You need C-Xbox tool to make an Xbox iso. It's the only ISO format the Xbox can read.

Once you have your iso, use Nero Burning ROM to burn it, works for any Xbox game."
,n0bi,2009-11-30T06:30Z,"So Tomgono, are you playing this on an original Xbox or an Xbox360?"
,iamz3r0,2009-12-19T03:31Z,"Alright, we've got a new site, it's www.westwindpmc.net"
,SNES_VS_PS1,2009-12-26T10:40Z,how do i play it with CXBX?
,Bizzythizzle,2010-07-19T03:21Z,"@specop44

not true. i used MAGICISO to convert an NRG image to ISO and it worked perfect."
,leyon533,2010-11-27T09:22Z,"hey guys you mind seeding this for me for a little longer

thank you very much!!!!


long live XBOX!!!"
,DJCoppy,2011-06-21T22:25Z,"Halo 2 should still be compatible with xbox 360 if microsoft haven't made any new updates that prevents it somehow. Anyway, you'll need a flashed system (obviously).. Theres by the way another torrent here on TPB with Halo 2 that is already converted to ISO."
,thcmagus,2011-07-25T22:21Z,After downloading and FTPing over I got the same dirty or damaged disc error. Looked at the files and noticed the file (default.xbe_orig) should just be default.xbe after renaming the file the game started but there were graphical errors for me. I couldn't read any of the text in the menus and after trying to start a game it froze :/
,aruntjtj,2011-09-09T15:59Z,guys i have downloaded xbox360 svr11 taht consist of deafault.xex file how to run it in xenon
,kenshinsars,2011-09-28T08:13Z,"""dirty disc"" error here as well"
,amtlib.dll,2011-12-21T03:13Z,"u guys are idiots, xbe files are for the xbox emulator: http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/xbox/xeon.html"
,nubnubnub,2012-01-07T20:49Z,"actually no, xeon is shitty and as of dec 31 a new emulator was released specifically using xbe's instead of isos so no amtlib.dll , you are wrong sir. besides ive NEVER had to use anything but my simple ass Acer Laptop to run ANY torrent or old game. just remember noobs, just because you come to this site looking for soft mod xbox isos DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO USE AN XBOX....ignorance. just mount the image using deamon tools and pow your done...now if you excuse me, im going to go own judge dredd vs death for the GC...on my hard drive."
