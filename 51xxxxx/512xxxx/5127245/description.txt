Enjoy, spam it, link it, pass it, blog it, comment on it, gossip it, what ever but most of all listen closely to it. Remember that on January I will change the name on my IDJ Mixes to The Nece Within You after all it's time for a change like all things but Ladies Nightout stays the same for now I think. You want to send me feeback or an intro(to let me know where you are listening from) just check the mp3 for my email.If your a dance music artist and your naughty record label has not contacted me well you know what to do now also.
Love
Nece
