,terrenmcc,2009-10-15T21:50Z,Thank you anonymous person!  
,nepoelif_2,2009-10-15T21:52Z,"Virginia, get rid of that black hair! Please?

Thanks for the set."
,Hydra25,2009-10-15T23:15Z,Careful what you wish for nepoelif; god forbid she takes you on your word and cuts it all off!
,nepoelif_2,2009-10-16T02:17Z,"@Hydra25

That would be an improvement IMHO."
,elbee1984,2009-10-16T23:56Z,"i would take her with red hair, black hair blonde hair, yellow hair, grey hair white hair, purple hair, no hair, whatever.   

i do think the pail skin and black hair would match an outfit that was a little more goth instead of baby pink.  but i am (unfortunately) not the phototgrapher"
,elbee1984,2009-10-16T23:57Z,does anyone want to up a torrent of her pre-fame girls work (especially the stuff she did in the year or two directly before fame-girls)
