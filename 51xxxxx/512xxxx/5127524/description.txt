This is a custom jailbroken firmware made by a mac. For 3gs only. If you have already upgraded your 3gs in itunes, this firmware will NOT i repeat NOT! help you with unlocking. Presently there is no way to downgrade or unlock a 3gs 3.1 or above if it was upgraded straight from itunes.

Your 3gs has to be UNupgraded. So if your firmware says 3.0.1 or 3.0. Then plug your phone in to itunes and hold shift+click on this firmware.

Other people will have to wait for a new unlock for baseband 5.XX.XX

thats it. 
enjoy.
