Secrets of Haunted House was a horror-suspense anthology comic book series published by DC Comics from 1975 to 1982.

Like its predecessor Secrets of Sinister House, and very much in the same vein as House of Mystery and House of Secrets, Secrets of Haunted House was originally "hosted" by Cain, Abel, Eve, and Destiny (who had moved over from Weird Mystery Tales). By issue #10, Destiny was the only one of these who remained a regular.

Debuting in 1975, Secrets of Haunted House started and stopped several times until issue #14, when it continued until series end in 1982.

Later in the series, the Mister E character came into being, where he was a recurring character for ten issues, competing with the likes of Johnny Peril, Dr. 13, and I, Vampire - regulars of DC's other horror titles.
