"Jen Music Mafia" (vol.I) is the first official crunk/southern rap 

compilation coming from Bulgaria, a country in Eastern Europe.

Jentaro is the first Bulgarian crunk artist, who introduced the crunk and the 

southern rap to the Bulgarian audience back in 2003. He is also known as the 

bulgarian Lil Jon because of his raw flow, lyrics and beats.

In 2004 he establishes the Bulgaria-based crunk group called Nad Zakona Clicc 

alongside Trafikanta (who is also an artist of the Jen Music) , with 

whom he manage to release the debut underground album of the group in 2007.

In the same year he introduces his label 'Jen Music' as an official brand of the 

Bulgarian crunk across Europe, doing numerous live gigs and featurings with many 

european artists, gaining reputation as one of the hardest emcees in Europe.

In the year of 2008 he and his crew succeeded to record and release the label's 

first official product - the "Jen Music Mafia" vol.I which they distribute for 

free at live performances and on the internet with only one purpose - to establish 

their sound as the crunkest across Europe and to put Jen Music officially on the 

map.
