,jatin_7G,2009-10-18T11:07Z,The quality of the movie is good. Can you upload the IDX/SUB subtitles? Thank you.
,anonim1979,2009-10-20T15:56Z,"(Use GSpot program to check:)
Multipart OpenDML AVI (3 parts), ""rec list"" style
(212 frames in first part, 137835 frames follow)
Interleave: 788 ms (18.9 v.frames), preload=192
Audio frames: Aligned on interleaves


Wont play properly in MANY standalone DIVX/XVID players.
Multipart = PROBLEM
- Most standalones will only play first part (212 frames = about 5 seconds)!
Some media players on PC will also play sound only for first part. 

To fix:

Download and run VirtualDubMod ( 

http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/virtualdubmod/VirtualDubMod_1_5_10_2_All_inclusive.zip )

1. Open movie file:
""File"", ""Open video file"" (or use Ctrl+O shortcut), then browse to dir with YOUR_MOVIE.avi

2. If asked: choose and press NO to question on the begining asking you to ""correct"" VBR MP3 audio.

3. ""File"", Save as (or simply press F7)

Put new name and/or directory
!BEFORE clicking SAVE: CHANGE(Video)""Video mode"" to ""Direct stream copy""
Done in 1-2 minutes!"
