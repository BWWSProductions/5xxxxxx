,azvareth,2010-04-03T22:10Z,"Weird behaviour, Testing it now, get crash popups from several DOS apps (16 bit MSDOS subsystem)

Everytime with different Exe names, I have not done a virus test of it, as I currently loosed one of my drives (viruses), and needed to get the data back, the reason for DL it.

Still the behaviour is suspicious, The system is a new clean install and should not do this.

I don't say it IS anything. Just be careful... I Will."
