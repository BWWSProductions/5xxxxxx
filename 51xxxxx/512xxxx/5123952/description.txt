With her cheerful nature, inquiring mind, and colourful fashion sense, Nickelodeon's adorable bilingual heroine DORA THE EXPLORER has charmed both pre-school-age children and their parents alike. Designed to simulate a computer game, the animated series follows the cute little Latina girl, her monkey pal Boots, and their anthropomorphic cohorts Map and Backpack as they set out on problem-solving adventures that encourage interaction and physical activity while teaching simple concepts such as counting, logic skills, and basic Spanish. This volume features animated tricks and treats in two special Halloween episodes: in 'Boo!', Dora and Boots fly by broomstick through a spooky pumpkin patch to help a cute little monster get back home; and in 'The Missing Piece', the winsome duo hunt for a wizard's missing magic wand.
