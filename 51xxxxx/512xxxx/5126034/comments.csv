I conclude: DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"

Read the description.  It clearly states this is a dual-audio rip meaning it has both the actual audio for the film AND a commentary track, which is probably what you heard.  Most media players allow you to select the audio track you want to listen to, for example, Media Player Classic or VLC.  "
