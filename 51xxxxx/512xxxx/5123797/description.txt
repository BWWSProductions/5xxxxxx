Rls Notes

After The Rain marks a very special moment the
sky is clearing, tender sunrays strike one's skin
again, the air is fresh and clean and sometimes
one can even watch a rainbow

This situation represents pretty much the musical
atmosphere of Krama's second album: Mighty bass
structures form a clean and solid foundation, on
which sunny melodies swash out of trancy depths
accompanied by forcing rhythm structures. Since
2001, Dimitris Violitzis and Elias Garanis from
Greece have constantly developed their very own
definition of Power Progressive Trance

The epic flow of their music is inspired by their
musical background, which includes minimal
Progressive Trance on the one hand but also
classical and Celtic music, New Age sounds and
even some Metal

The intense effectiveness of Krama's tunes could
already been witnessed on many different
Progressive floors where the two dudes always
delivered excellent shows

Group Notes

After more than a half decade we think it is time
to change this message. The scene changed so much
in the past few years. Many lamers hangin' around
sharing scene releases on public places such as
FXP-Pubs, DC++ hubs, P2P networks and so on

WE DON'T WANT OUR RELEASES GETTiNG
SPREAD TO SUCH LAME PLACES!!!

The psytrance scene is kinda small and needs YOUR
SUPPORT. If you LOVE this music (like we do)
please BUY the music (like we do)! Artists work
long & hard on their music. Please be honest and
support the artists & labels to make more great
music in the future too. Every sold CD counts!
Our releases are meant for promotion only - to
give you a sample of the retail product

NEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT'S JUST MP3!

Furthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people
who made this whole thing happen, in the past
present and future. And finally, we want to send
greetings to all our fellow friends within
the scene! You know who you are!

MUSiC WORTH LiSTENiNG iS MUSiC WORTH BUYiNG!!
