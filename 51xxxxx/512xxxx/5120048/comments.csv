,ChillyCrossFoot,2009-12-24T04:06Z,"I have this torrent. Some of the CUE files have spelling errors. Makes me believe they were manually edited and not from the original source. I know that EAC will not make spelling errors in a cue file. So either they are deliberately done to cause frustration, or some guy in China or Russia couldn't spell when editing the cue. I wouldn't use these cue files, and who knows if the LOG files are original. The music itself checks out 100% CDDA in AudioChecker. Word of advice to uploader: Please put some EFFORT into your torrents. Don't just throw them out there."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2010-01-20T09:48Z,"AudioChecker gives 100% CDDA results, however The MFSL CD is labeled as MSFL. What is MSFL? It looks to me the ripper manually edited the log and cue! I know of Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab but I don't know of Mobile Sound Fidelity Lab. Uploader, do you care to comment? "
