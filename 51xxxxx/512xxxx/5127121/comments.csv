,old_upploader,2009-12-22T09:34Z,Thanks for these series
,jeromycraig,2009-12-29T05:39Z,"First of all, thank you so much for uploading.  My old ass watched this show religiously when it first aired, and I love being able to see it again.

The only problem is, the last four episodes are missing.  Instead, the four episodes prior (Quilt of Hathor I&II, Double Exposure, and Pirate's Promise) are mislabeled and repeated as the missing eps.  Any chance of correcting?"
,Xarathos,2010-01-22T07:33Z,Was the episode issue corrected?
,jeromycraig,2010-01-23T02:55Z,"I don't know, he never responded.  I'll redownload one of the last four episodes and let you know if it's correct."
,jeromycraig,2010-01-24T08:33Z,"Nope.  Downloaded again, and it's still missing the last four."
,avid8899,2010-01-26T19:58Z,"i actually have all 3 seasons on dvds but im really bad with copying dvds and ripping them. if anyone knows how this is done, i'd be happy to upload the 4 missing episodes as well as season 3."
,paparian,2010-02-28T07:45Z,"yeah guys,can we find season3 ?
