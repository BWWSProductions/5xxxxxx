,ahyoka666,2009-10-12T19:38Z,"I read your reply. Can you please tell me what I need to do to get the sound on Language of the enemy? A friend in UK downloaded it using Miro too, and tells me it is ok, it has sound. What am I doing wrong? (I use a Mac)"

Graham"
,chuchunesme,2009-10-12T22:40Z,"You need to unzip the files and burn those files. The first disc is the game and the second disc is extra cars and tracks. The game is awesome, I love being able to get the game weeks before it comes out and for nothing!!"
,KookieMonsta,2009-10-13T01:08Z,What Disk Is The Actual Game?
,Ci2USH,2009-10-13T08:47Z,"DUDE I AM SEEDING THE SHIT OUT OF THIS.... SO PLEASE EVERYONE ELSE DO THE SAME... 

My DL speed is 150kbs and my upload is close to 400kbs so please everyone lets get this one strong so we can all have it quick ;)"
,grahammc0,2009-10-13T12:54Z,The files are already unzipped and show dvd 1 and dvd 2 with loads of files in them. Do i just highlight them all and burn to disc ??
,MQFPLO,2009-10-13T14:56Z,"when you unzip, you have 2 dvd, the number 1 is the game, and the number 2 is the extra tracks and cars...."
,john5246,2009-10-14T02:47Z,"PLEASE SET YOUR UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD SPEED TO UNLIMITED OVERNIGHT

When you wake up you can set it lower or turn it off but please guys at least let us get somewhere overnight huh???"
,john5246,2009-10-14T02:53Z,"In your torrent software:

TOOLS>OPTIONS>SCHEDULER

then set your hi and low speeds, then click the appropriate boxes which correspond with a time of day and are color coded. This allows you to set your speed higher overnight and seed during the day without slowing down your connection for browsing or VOIP. "
