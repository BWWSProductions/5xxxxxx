My Year Without Sex  is about a 30-something couple, Ross and Natalie, and their children Ruby and Louis, after Natalie suffers a brain injury and is forbidden from having sex for 12 months and the complications that go with it.

My Year Without Sex is kind of a love story about a family dealing with all the big questions and even more of the small ones. Set over one messy year, Ross and Natalie and their two kids, Louis and Ruby, navigate nits, faith, Christmas, job insecurity, footy practice, more nits, and whether they will ever have sex again.
