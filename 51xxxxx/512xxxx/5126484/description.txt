AllWebMenus Pro description
	 
Create a complex dhtml menu for your website, without having to write a single line of code

AllWebMenus is a useful dhtml menu/javascript menu builder for web site navigation which requires absolutely no DHTML or Javascript experience.

AllWebMenus creates any cross-browser, popup or drop-down menu that works alike in all browsers supporting DHTML (all Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer versions of 4.0 and later, Opera and Mozilla included)

DHTML/JavaScript menus are designed with a treelike approach. Users can tailor their menu by using the Properties Pane or by choosing a predefined appearance from the Style Gallery.

The menu can be either vertical or horizontal (pop-up or drop-down menu), it can be movable, stay visible while scrolling, contain static or animated images, borders, colors, and much more.

Once everything is set, you can use the insert-menu-into-Web-page command to add your menu in the Web page in a fast and easy manner without any code.
