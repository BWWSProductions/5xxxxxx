,Kanegasi,2010-06-14T15:21Z,"Your episode numbering is off in the sixth season. The fifth episode should be the seventh. I'm going through all of it right now to see if I missed anything else while watching through. This is just a note for those who are downloading.

Great show!"
,ardesai,2011-01-05T20:21Z,"hey Kanegasi, does that mean that episode 5 & 7 should be swapped without changing anything else with the order?"
,mizzllat,2011-07-26T08:38Z,"Hope this helps, somewhat, with the confusion on the order of Season 6:

1.  Drive
2.  Amongst Friends
3.  One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car
4.  Runnin' on E
5.  Fore!
6.  Murphy's Lie
7.  No More Drama
8.  The Sorkin Notes
9.  Security Briefs
10. Berried Alive
11. Scared Straight
12. Give a Little Bit
