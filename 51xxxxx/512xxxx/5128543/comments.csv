,grnthmb642004,2009-10-19T20:57Z,"forgive my previous comments...!!

this is a fake..!!
only a few TSO songs mixed
in with some Band called 
Scendence...."
,mrmojorisin365,2009-10-21T19:50Z,Is this legit?  
,mrmojorisin365,2009-10-21T20:03Z,"Just like grnthmb said, this is NOT the new TSO album.  There are a couple tracks, but the majority are a band called Scendence."
,scarlanah,2009-10-23T22:10Z,"The TSO songs seemed to have been acquired from their website. I think there are 7 songs actually from TSO.

A quick search on the net confirms the rest of the songs are actually from a band called Scendence. 

The band isn't bad though, and the Scendence songs names are displayed accurately in Media player. Don't let the MP3 title fool ya as they copied the Title track from TSO and replaced them with the Scendence songs."
,fredd42,2009-10-27T04:32Z,How about a list of the songs that are actually by TSO so we can just download those?  Thanks.
,zombeatle,2009-12-21T00:34Z,This is missing many of the real TSO tracks - don't waste your time with THIS download. There is another upload on PB that hopefully is legit!
