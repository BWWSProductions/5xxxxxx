,tmaxx666,2009-10-30T22:46Z,Thanks.  An old favorite of mine and it works great on an Intel iMac 2.4ghz running Snow Leopard.  
,sumanthdatta,2009-11-08T09:45Z,"i have xp service pac2 iam is it possible to convert the dmg file to iso file
then burn to the cd and then instal the game on to the pc,tell me how to convert dmg file to iso"
,MegatonSE,2009-11-15T00:47Z,sumanthdatta -> Are you retarded? This is for Mac only. 
,ionlyknow,2009-11-19T18:32Z,"Works great! But I think most people would appreciate a walkthrough how to use toast! 
1: Open toast titanium.
2: Go to utilities (in the menu bar) and press ""mount disc image"". Then you choose the max payne.DMG. Toast will now create a ""fake"" disc on your desktop.
3: click the fake disc and run the installation. 

Every time you want to play you have to open toast and mount the dmg first :)  "

,gogotrx420,2012-01-13T09:32Z,Which part of Max Payne is this?
,gogotrx420,2012-01-13T11:51Z,"Don't download it if you are with Mac OS X Lion, the game is too old and doesn't work on this OS!"
