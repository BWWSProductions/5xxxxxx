A/V = 9/10

Haven't seen the movie yet, but the start wasn't the best in world.

,clubseed,2009-10-20T01:24Z,"I watched Val in The Thaw last night. He is getting a lil old, but damn keeps the movies coming great dont he. One of my fav actors by far. Will you be my huckleberry lol. I previewed the first 20 mins of this copy and so far it looks like its gonna be V: 9 A:10 The movie seems to have a sad plot so I am anxious to watch the rest and at 2,769 seeders on Oct.19, 2009 it wont be long. THANK YOU SEEDERS AROUND THE WORLD.Clubseed "

,koka3,2009-11-08T23:39Z,"Thanks, A/V 9/9 at least, can't speak for the contents yet though"
,random-critic,2009-11-13T15:42Z,"Not a crap movie.

Cuba Gooding coast through this mind-control chip filled extravaganza.

Not a hardcore make you think movie, just a fun change of pace from the rest of the crap out there.

Val Kilmer does: The Thaw (Off the mainstream)

Cuba Gooding does: Hardwired (Off mainstream)

Val Kilmer joins Cuba in this one...

Overall maybe 7.  Good for a rainy day."
,kocho1,2010-01-06T10:47Z,"Movie much better than I was expecting from based on the comments here.  Good movie to watch, thanks for the upload!  A9 V9"
,bmxjuh,2010-03-07T19:23Z,"just finished watching this movie.
good audio / video quality with subtitle file

i think it's a good movie, solid story, good acting...... val kilmer is one hella villain in the movie, although the last two minutes (around 1h58min) was kind of cheesy, but i guess the ending is decent for this kind of sci-fi movie.

anyways, good quality and good story.
thank you for sharing."
