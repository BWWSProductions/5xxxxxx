,Karl Mundt,2009-11-01T08:05Z,"Paltegott, you're welcome. However, for the moment i won't be uploading any new torrents. There seems to be a problem with my Windows 7 with regards to torrent clients which is making my upload speeds dismal (not to mention i can't download at all). I'm sure the issue will be resolved somehow and i'll make up for it at a further date. The decrease in upload speed is probably making the torrents slower and i've noticed i've hardly uploaded anything lately on my first two torrents, but i can assure everyone i have no plans to discontinue the seeding."
