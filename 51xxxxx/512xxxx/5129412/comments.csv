,Bertol65,2009-10-20T04:40Z,The image is mounted automatically. When do you need the password ?
,Bertol65,2009-10-20T04:47Z,"It's  only the demo version. There are 2 options : get a licence, where you need to give an email adress and a "" transaction identificator ""
or you can choose "" add a licence "" and it's searched on your hard disc. I've copied and pasted your password in Textedit but I can't choose it. It's greyed. Thank you"

I just think that password to open dmg is very lame."
,Bertol65,2009-10-20T09:14Z,So how do you get the full version working ?
,miknos,2009-10-20T15:24Z,"@Bertol65,

The app is already patched (don't need serial). To open the .dmg file use the password ""finixdownload"" (it's stated in this torrent's info)."

open your eyes and read the info before asking!"
,Bertol65,2009-10-22T15:31Z,"Sorry but at any time I was asked to enter a password. The dmg. just opened wihout password but the xlimmer is limited to 50mo reduction.
Can you explain how you do to make it work without restriction ?
thanks"
,miknos,2009-10-23T07:50Z,"The application IS ALREADY CRACKED. Just copy to applications.

Download it again. Maybe you're using another version."
