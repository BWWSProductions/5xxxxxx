I'm grabbing the beginning of the replay right now so that the 128k up will be fixed......"

Two replacement birds are up already, but they're waiting until Rock and Roll (the 2 original ones) crap out before activating the new ones. (The CEO is a jew so he wants to get his money's worth).

Until then, expect occasional outages, especially when the air is dense (cooler temps). "
