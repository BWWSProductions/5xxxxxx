,deadmanamit,2009-10-17T10:25Z,is this wave 4?
,titan951,2009-10-18T02:18Z,this is wave 4 and for some reason it plays on my 1.6 flash without boot disc
,20PDC,2009-10-19T14:51Z,last time I checked... this is NOT wave 4
,deadmanamit,2009-10-20T10:12Z,"yep, definitely not wave 4. works on my 1.6 without the boot disk"
,cagacazzo,2009-10-21T14:06Z,"has anybody actually tried it yet?  how about online?


I ran this through abgx and it detected loads of problems, may be a bad rip."
,crazybeaner,2009-10-21T15:38Z,"same deal here, ran through abgx and it says stealth uncertain/failed verification. i guess it wont pick up the right wave. anyone played this online yet, is it safe?"
,osnolsson,2009-10-21T17:50Z,what language is this on ? can u play on english ?
,cagacazzo,2009-10-22T15:01Z,"I decided to delete this one and download the repack instead, the abgx database had this torrent listed as nuked.

I'm not saying this won't work because I was too nervous to try, jus careful everybody."
,wallen1337,2009-10-25T14:05Z,Is there any problem with this game?
,iklsjicbryanharley,2009-10-26T23:38Z,god this annoyed me very much all sorts of problems with it crc problems and dvd style corruption do not download go and download the repack like i am now :( lol and remeber to seed that one 
,dragongard91,2009-10-27T15:50Z,"Works great!
But be carefull if you go online because abgx360 detects a lot of problems... It is also WAVE 3!!!"
,eestyle2005,2009-11-03T19:51Z,guys.. i have a hitachi with ixtreme 1.51. is it gonna work on mine if i simply burn in a Dual layer dvd after completion???
,crazybeaner,2009-11-04T01:06Z,"@eestyle2005

it will work as long as you burn it on a dvd+r dual layer disc. because it is a wave 3 game it will boot on 1.51 but this download is very buggy and detects a lot of errors in abgx360 so make sure to play offline only."
,eestyle2005,2009-11-04T17:16Z,"@crazybeaner
Thanks. i am downloading it since 4 days and its only completed like 12%.. so i don't think that i can play online with that kind of connection..

Thanks again.."
,eestyle2005,2009-11-05T16:29Z,"@crazybeane

Hey bro, i got a Hitachi drive with ixtreme 1.51 and i am not sure that after simply burning it to a dvdr+dl with imgburn... please help me out because i only got 1 disc left i can't get any at afghanistan though..."
,eestyle2005,2009-11-13T11:40Z,my download completed after 11 days and i finally made it to play on my Hitachi 1.5... my hitachi 1.5 can't play wave 3 and 4 so thats why i had to convert the Game to Wave 2 first then burn... it..Cheers
,Jccarvalho,2009-12-30T04:18Z,"Don't download this, this don't pass on abgx you'll be banned on xbox live."
,gamesforfree,2010-04-08T08:30Z,no pc version
,Dmanb3,2011-05-10T02:26Z,"I am really new at this, so can anyone give me a link where i can learn how actually burn the files to a dvd?"
