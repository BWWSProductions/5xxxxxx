Your torrent that was supposed to be ""Daylight"" was actually ""Management"":

At the heart it's another ""be true to yourself"" flick that makes for great 90-minute flicks but lousy real life lessons, but enjoyed it a lot anyhow.  If bandwidth is a problem, just pay the $5 and rent this sucker at Blockbuster--worthy.  Thanks, flu-virus dude!"
