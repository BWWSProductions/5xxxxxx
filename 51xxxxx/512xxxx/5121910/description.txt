Faithfully adapted from the Marvel comic books, this animated series brings X-MEN to life as never before, presenting the charactersâ€™ origins, battles, and storylines just as they were in the original material. Debuting in 1992, the show garnered quick acclaim for not shying away from social issues or complex narratives; its blend of smart story arcs and intriguing action helped set it apart from its Saturday morning brethren.
