,vikkijoes,2011-04-19T00:49Z,"And to the guy above me: Seeding is what keeps a Torrent alive, a ""seed"" is someone who has kept the file(s) on their BitTorrent client for others to download. More seeds of one file = faster downloading of that file.

It's easy to seed something, just don't delete it off your BitTorrent client. That way other people can get it off you."
