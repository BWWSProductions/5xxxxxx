  Sorry, but this pack does NOT contain Vengeance Electro Essentials Vol. 
2, I could not find it anywhere! But fortunatley that IS the only pack 
this collection does not contain.

  Each pack contains all of the sounds (of course) in WAV format (except 
for VVE, that's in MP3, I don't know why), the demo songs, and the front and back CD cover image. This collection is in ISO format, so just uncompress or mount the 
.ISO CD image file with PowerISO. If you don't have it, buy it (or option 
2, you know what I mean).

  What I usually do with Sample Packs is put it on the folder of my FL 
Studio patches in a folder called "Samples" (C:Program FilesImage-
LineFL Studio 9DataPatchesSamples), so I can easily navigate through 
them in the FL browser. Then I just drop them onto the step sequencer.

  It's a good idea, when using these samples, to put a reverb and/or a 
delay on them, as well as a chorus sometimes. You should also loop them 
with loop points (if they aren't looped already) using the Edison wave 
editor that comes with FL, or crossfade-looping using the sampler. The 
samples aren't as useful without these effects.

Have fun with all of the samples!
