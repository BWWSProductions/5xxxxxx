Comments on the Book:
    It really is a good study and book. There has been plenty of papers and books written about the study--it was very comprehensive and contains information about the subjects from before birth to adulthood. I warn you that the book involves a lot of statistics and the writing is ok.

Brief Summary of the Book:
    A longitudinal study conducted on the children born in 1954 on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. There was a correlation between having a certain number of risks--poverty, medical problems, lack of care, etc--and developing serious behavior, mental health, and delinquency problems. There was a subset of children who developed into healthy adults despite having these risks; this book is about these resilient children and looks at these children from before birth to 18 years of age.
    The book discusses: the setting of the study; methodology; factors leading up to and during pregnancy--biological and social; sex differences associated with resiliency; characteristics of resilient infants & toddlers; family structure; personality of resilient adolescents; sources of support; resilient kids of parents with psychiatric problems; and significant predictive discriminators between resilient and non-resilient kids.
    Throughout the book, the authors compare resilient children and non-resilient children (children who developed problems).
