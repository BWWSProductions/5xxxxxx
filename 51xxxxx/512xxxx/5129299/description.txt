I had to resort to this strange name for this movie in order to circumvent Pirate Bay's effort to block my "update" AFTER already deleting the original file.

This is truly "The Man in the Iron Mask (1977) TV update."
But I was unsuccessful uploading using that name.

My earlier upload of this movie was bad. This is a much better copy.
However, there are problems with this one, and I cannot fix them.
With the other two swashbuckler videos I recently uploaded I was able to bring them down to a smaller size and adjust the subtitles to fit. This one I cannot.

My 84-year-old brain is not up to the task. So rather than wasting my time and yours I'll send it as-is. It's big, but it's beautiful compared to my original.

Never mind the German influence, if you just want to watch it without subtitles, and if you have the hard drive space, enjoy.

If you figure out how to do what I cannot do, let me know.
