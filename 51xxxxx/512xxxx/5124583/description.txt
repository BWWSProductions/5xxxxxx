Obama's War
Aired: Oct 13, 2009
 
Tens of thousands of fresh American troops are now on the move in Afghanistan, led by a new commander and armed with a counter-insurgency plan that builds on the lessons of Iraq. But can U. S. forces succeed in a land long known as the "graveyard of empires?" FRONTLINE producers Martin Smith ("Beyond Baghdad," "Return of the Taliban") and Marcela Gaviria ("In Search of Al Qaeda") once again make the dangerous journey to the front lines of America's biggest fight. Through interviews with the top U.S. commanders on the ground, embeds with U.S. forces and fresh reporting from Washington, Smith and Gaviria examine U.S. counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- a fight that promises to be longer and more costly than most Americans understand.
