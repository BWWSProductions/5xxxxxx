,nhprm,2009-10-19T10:02Z,Is the download link not working for anyone else?  Could someone maybe post the torrent on another site and mention it here?  Tracert is crapping out somewhere under the Atlantic.
,nhprm,2009-10-19T10:10Z,nvm.  It's definitely down right now (torrents.thepirateybay.org) at least for us users here.  Would be great if this showed up somewhere else.
,nhprm,2009-10-20T06:04Z,Working now. THX loads.

,limper106,2009-12-10T09:36Z,"Logan you are an idiot.  It clearly says it is a Rifftrax.  If you don't know what a Rifftrax is, go to rifftrax.com like it says.  Moron."
,Unnk,2009-12-15T06:34Z,everytime i read somone bitchingabout commentary on a rifftrax i have random explosive diarreah fits of laughing  becuase they downloaded a file labled rifftrax and negleted to read the commentary that clearly links the RT site
,ibraholli,2010-01-02T00:05Z,i love when people get upset that they didnt get the movie they wanted with out the RIFFTRAX audio. They should be ashamed of them selves for wanting the origanal. all the movies they riff ARE HORIBLE to begin with and thats why their riffed. Word to the wise if it says rifftax it means it is being made fun of dumb asses!!! I love the ms3k guys and hope they never stop riffing movies that need to be riffed!!!
,Dr_Science,2010-01-03T08:46Z,not all the movies rifftrax does are bad movies. but their best stuff is on the bad movies.
,scratchbomber,2010-02-02T12:33Z,Could someone upload Star Wars:  The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones Rifftrax?  Also Over the Top.
,Keshicus,2010-07-11T07:31Z,"You\'re a dork if you want to watch the movie without the riff. Seriously, the movie sucked balls."
,kingjoser,2011-08-25T04:28Z,Dragon Wars was not that bad. You guys are idiots. You guys dont understand Art. The first 2/3 of the movie is mediocre but not terrible. The last portion of the movie was pure Art. I loved it. The Dragon looked awesome fighting the Imoogi. I liked it.
