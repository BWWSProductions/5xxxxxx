-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A playful yarn spun by a talkative cabbie captivates two young sisters in this animated fable
featuring the voices of Danny DeVito and Lucy Liu.

Climbing in to a cab during the chilly Christmas season, the nervous siblings are treated to the
enchanting story of a boy named Leo, who once lost his dog Ramona while playing in Central Park.
Crestfallen at the loss of his four-legged companion and uncertain of where to begin searching for
her, Leo is visited by a luminous sprite named Little Spirit who guides him on a wondrous adventure
through the city. The cold winds whipping through the festively lit streets as Christmas fast
approaches, Leo encounters a wide array of friendly faces on his journey to being reunited with
Ramona.
