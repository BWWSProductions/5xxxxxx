Plot:


"Wealthy college student Richard Sachs arranges a web broadcast contest originating from a local haunted house. He entices three young couples to spend Halloween night in the abandoned dwelling by offering $5,000 in prize money. The last owner of the house was deranged killer Sean McIntyre, who murdered his entire family 20 years prior on Thanksgiving Day before hanging himself. McIntyre was an amateur mountain climber who used his grappling hook to gruesome effect during his murder spree; we learn that his descent into madness began when he killed what he believed was a Yeti on a trek up the Himalayas. "Richard has mini-video cameras situated throughout the McIntyre house to capture the happenings for his Internet broadcast," O'Hara continues. "When subscriptions for the show lag, he hires a porn star to take the place of one of the contestants. The participants include two college football players, their girlfriends and a geeky student who is paired with the amorous Velvet Luv, the hired porn star. The two football players are destined to clash over a simmering feud concerning team spirit. The evening starts off with a group sÃ©ance where the spirit of Sean McIntyre is contacted and, unbeknownst to the youths, brought back from the other side. As the kids split up and follow clues given them under the rules of the contest, they are systematically slaughtered by McIntyre. Eventually, the kids realize they are being stalked and the survivors must make a final stand in the attic.
