In the past Pal and NTSC weren't compatable because each has a different standard for resolutions. However HDtv's have a universal standard for resolution so they work just fine. "

,grahammc0,2009-10-14T13:52Z,but when i download this all the files are R00-R70 and there is a windows media file too. I have just tried to burn them to disc and put in the xbox and nothing.. So what could i be doing wrong ??

,iklsjicbryanharley,2009-10-15T11:58Z,that guy is an idiot you have to extract all of the rar files first and then burn the .dvd file to a dual layer disc using imgburn.
,hamada99,2009-10-15T15:06Z,i have an arcade console . can i play the first dvd only

,Rupativo,2009-10-15T19:43Z,"2 days of downloading a game and i am on only 55%,please seed guys,this suck a lot."
,pystdante,2009-10-15T23:59Z,"@ grahammc0 - Use Winrar and click on the R00 ( it will auto unpack the others) extract the .iso and.dvd (if there is a .dvd, run the iso thru abgx360 to ensure it has stealth files and then use a burning program that has a layer break option like imgburn or clonecd and load the .dvd file and burn at 2x-2.4x speed. Also use Verbatim DVDDL whenever possable, I got some Memorex that work like crap even when burned at 1x  "
,heeler,2009-10-16T01:55Z,can somebody please tell me why i need a password to extract the rar files  ??????????

,heeler,2009-10-17T11:40Z,why do i get this message when i try to extract the files : enter the password for the encrypted file: x360sos_fm3_pal_dvd1.dvd ??????
,Mockarutan,2009-10-18T18:06Z,"Has anyone got banned from playing this release? I just played it (without cable in). I'm not going to connect it untill it's released... Still think i'm smoked:
http://kotaku.com/5383696/early-play-on-illegit-forza-borderlands-resulting-in-permabans

But has anyone tried this release with internet cable in? I got IXtreme 1.6 btw..."
,pystdante,2009-10-19T00:39Z,"""Illegitimately obtained early copies of Forza Motorsport 3 or Borderlands, being played online over Xbox Live, have resulted in permabans for the accounts of offending players, Microsoft has confirmed.""

It specifically says ppl playing online over xbox LIVE, Later in the article he says ppl who bought a copy early are ok, so that cancels out the timestamp, so I think as long as I wait till the games comes out to play online (I am not even signing on to LIVE until the games comes out), shouldnt be an issue, I have been playing Risen while connected to Live and not had any issues and Risen is not due out till december!"
