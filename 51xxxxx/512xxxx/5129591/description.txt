Many things have gone missing in this world: Amelia Earhart, D.B. Cooper, the Olmec civilization, Jeff Tremaineâ€™s waistline, even the whole continent of Atlantis. Most important and culturally relevant, though, is a big mess of Jackass segments that had apparently slipped through a crack in Mianus and never found a home on any of the DVD releases for the classic MTV television series.

The â€œSelf Defense Test,â€ â€œStun Collar,â€ â€œUnicycle Poo Barf,â€ â€œFast Food Football,â€ â€œRoller Jump,â€ and â€œSatan vs. Godâ€ (in its original long ass-kicking form!) are just some of the absurd gold that what was once lost but now is found, not to mention all the original show opens, credit montages, and a bunch of other bonus footage that was never shown on television â€“ or wasnâ€™t allowed to be shown â€“ featuring Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Preston Lacy, Wee-Man, Danger Ehren, and Dave England in their earliest years of basic cable fame and notoriety.
