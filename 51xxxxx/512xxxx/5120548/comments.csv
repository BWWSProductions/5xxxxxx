for others with such troubles as ""fatal error 1603""!!!
(1) use uninstall
(2) use WinCS4Cleanupscript from Adobe  as admin (http://download.macromedia.com/pub/creativesuite/script/4/WinCS4Cleanupscript.zip)
(3) use wincs3clean from Adobe as admin (http://download.macromedia.com/pub/creativesuite/script/3/wincs3clean.zip)

(4*) you maybe better to make a reboot
(5) turn off inet, antivirus
(6)install

p.s.
there a trojan in keygen( probably false positive, but no time and will to check in, just got key by running in sandbox)
