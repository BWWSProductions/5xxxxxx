[T],AXG,2009-10-17T08:24Z,"What I don't understand is, the video is beyond DvDrip... It almost looks like a BluRay rip thats how good the video is. (I mean it.)

But why was the sound ripped from a cam? What happened to the original R5 sound?

Thanks for the upload BTW, the first R5 I am actually pleased to watch for its quility. +10.

Most likely wasnt in english so they stripped and replaced."
