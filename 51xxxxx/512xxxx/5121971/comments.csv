,VersusTheWorld,2009-10-15T20:00Z,"Why is it always 23.976 fps? can you get it higher? cause the video skips in my dvd player, of course I could get another dvd player but I'm sure I'm not the only one to have this problem, Always excellent quality but as I said sometimes the video skips cause it's 23.976 fps.
