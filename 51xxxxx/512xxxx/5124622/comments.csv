,Stayhigh,2010-03-05T04:41Z,"Works fantastic on my 2.4 Ghz Intel Duo. Ok... for the folks who can't get it to work... here are the steps. 
1) Download this game (duh) and the get the crack from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5127967/. You NEED this crack to get it to work, or you'll get a no dvd-rom error. 
2) Open up the .DMG file from this torrent and install it normally.. (i.e. double click .dmg, copy the Black & White 2 loader app to Applications folder)
3) Open up the crack No DVD.DMG. You'll see a small window where it says ""Select Black & White 2 Loader App."" Go into your applications folder where you installed the actual game, and then click and drag the app into the small window and hit Select. 
4) In a few moments, you should get a confirmation that it was patched successfully. Close everything out and fire up Black & White from the applications folder. "

Any fix?"
,eyab,2011-08-08T22:34Z,If i install the update the no DVD crack doesn't work and if i don't the game crashes every time and i can't play any fixes for that?
,steveskidude,2011-08-11T14:38Z,"Thanks, great upload, works great on Lion.

Be sure to get the no-DVD crack from Apokarteron's link."
,derrylc,2011-09-27T06:38Z,"Downloaded, used the crack, and it starts up just fine!

However, its running incredibly slowly â especially when the two little ""helpers"" show up on screen... Almost to the point of unusable. I dropped resolution down to 640x480 with thousands (as opposed to millions) of colors, with no anti-aliasing, and it makes no difference.

What gives? I'm using a quad-core i7 iMac with 8GB of RAM and no other applications open (on Lion)."
,Mioso,2011-10-10T02:13Z,"the cd keeps popping up in finder...
