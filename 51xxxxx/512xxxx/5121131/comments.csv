,PROTEOUS1,2011-10-16T16:14Z,"THIS DOES WORK ON AMD PROCESSORS !!!! 
This is Leopard OS X 10.5.6 I have it installed on an HP Media Center PC along with Windows 7 on seperate drives. The Motherboard was originally a Nettle 2 ,but since those are flawed from the start and overheat to death ,I replaced it with a similar Asus board used in GateWay computers .The Model: MCP61PM-AM
 Processor is an AMD 64X2 DualCore 6000+ (3.00Ghz. x 2)
 4GBs of DDR2 SDRAM
 You'll need to download the iDeneb update kits to update to 10.5.7-10.5.8 
Idecided on this ,first of all for the AMD because it works!
 Secondly I have SnowLeopard and it's not backward compatable with the ton of software Isweat blood to buy and is still perfectly good.
 Lastly I have Lion and theres no way I'm tossing one more damn thing I bought just so Ican say....""OOOO,...LOOK AT ME I have the latest thing and it's so much better because you don't""
 Come on people ,that's what it's really all about. The few small improvements are nothing compared to what is taken away with each upgrade. Open your eyes. 99%"
