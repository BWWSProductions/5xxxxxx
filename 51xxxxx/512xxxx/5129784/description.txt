This is the official Installer for any World of Warcraft version. 
This is distributed by Blizzard .Inc and makes installation easier

---------------
It Includes:

-World of Warcraft
-World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade
-World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King
---------------

File Name: InstallWoW
File Size: 1.58 MB (1,663,656 bytes)
File Type: .exe (executable file)
File Version: 1.4.0.250

---------------

To install wrath of the lich king you do not need to install WoW and Burning crusade first
just click wrath of the lich king and put ok
it will then connect to blizzard.com and download all the files and install the game for you. 
once done installing it will patch the game (take about a 1-6 hours depending)
it will install all the files that come with the Over the Counter install CDS
I have not tampered or messed with the file since obviously.. i dont know how
so it is original and fully working.

---------------

This actually saves you the time of having to download the whole set of cds and it will install in about 30% less time than it would take to download the whole set from a torrent.


This doesnt pay for your world of warcraft membership or anything in any ways
its just the full game
---------------
- you can use a trial account to play

- when you buy the cds from the store all youre paying for is the box and the first month of membership

- there are no world of warcraft gametime card generators (yet)

this is fully updateable and and you can change the realmlist to play on private servers.

enjoy!

plz comment and thumbs up ^.^

( i quit world of warcraft like 4 months ago but i decided to share this installer with the world)
