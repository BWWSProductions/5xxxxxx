This is David McKnight's explosive book Espionage and the Roots of the Cold War - The Conspiratorial Heritage (2002) which provides a documented analysis of how the Communist International organized its clandestine activities and the guidelines for underground and covert political work that it laid out for Communist parties around the world. From the 1930's to the 1950's a significant number of left-wing men and women in the United States, Britain, Europe, Australia and Canada were recruited to the Soviet intellgence services. They were amateurs, rather than professional intelligence workers and the reason for their success is intriguing and has never been satisfactorily explained. Using recently released Soviet archives, this amazing book seeks to explore the foundations for these successes in the deliberately concealed tradition of underground political activity which was part of the communist movement. This tradition, which became extremely useful to Soviet intelligence, also explains the origins of the "tradecraft" of espionage. McKnight seeks to contribute to the study of the causes of the early Cold War, by explaining how this underground tradition lead to espionage. He shows that while allegations of disloyalty during the Cold War were often part of a witch hunt, the Left and their liberal allies sometimes unwittingly had a number of skeletons in their closet. Espionage and the Roots of the Cold War provides case studies of Comintern conspiratorial activities and demonstrates how this covert work later overlapped with and contributed to Soviet foreign espionage undertakings. 240 pages, some pictures. A must read for everyone.
