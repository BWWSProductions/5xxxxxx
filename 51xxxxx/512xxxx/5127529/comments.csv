[T],xybrite,2009-10-17T06:24Z,"Thanks for getting this up so fast!

I can't wait to watch this tonight.

I will seed it for the next couple days too!

Everybody seed, seed, seed.

Spread the SGU love!"
[T],xybrite,2009-10-17T10:04Z,"For the first time ever, I have encountered a TV show upload that doesn't play. I wouldn't bother leeching this version.

I recommend that people skip this version and try the .mkv from eztv at the link below.

[T],xybrite,2009-10-17T10:10Z,"I have tried playing this file with vlc, winamp, WDTV and PopcornHour C200, and it fails with all of them.

This file DOES NOT WORK!

Try the other version at the link provided."

[T],movieFOX,2009-10-17T12:54Z,xybrite through your ignorance you have ruined a perfectly good torrent man
[T],movieFOX,2009-10-17T12:57Z,btw i have just checked the other link u put up its the exact same file.
[T],xybrite,2009-10-17T14:07Z,"The file at the other link work.

Your file does not work.

I recommend that anyone reading these comments get on the other torrent, because this one will waste your time."
[T],xybrite,2009-10-17T14:12Z,"The swarm as taken the news that this file is broken seriously and nearly everyone is using the other torrent, which currently has about 9,000 leachers and over 2,000 seeders."
[T],movieFOX,2009-10-17T16:41Z,"well guess what stupid me just d/loaded this file again and guess what its not broken in anyway.
anybody else who has completed this d/load please leave a comment to shut this guy up once and for all."
