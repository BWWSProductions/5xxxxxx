The following are my math instructional videos that I created in 2009 to help those interested in learning The Language of Mathematics. These are the videos for the first part of Series III - "Solving Equations and Graphing Polynomial Functions". I hope to have the series completed and the torrent for the second part available by the summer of 2010. Videos and torrents are also available for Series I (created in 2007) and Series II (created in 2008). 

Full table of contents for all math videos available at:
