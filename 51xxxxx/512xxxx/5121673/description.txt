Abbie Gale are a four-piece band, that took shape during the summertime 2003 in Patras. They record their first album titled Family Life, that it circulates the summertime 2005 from Vacant Records. The album is characterized by itsâ€™ low profile, acoustic sound and the voice of Evira. It takes dithyrambic reviews from the printed and electronic press and the group intensifies their live appearances in many Greek cities.
  They started to work their new songs on summertime 2006 and two years after the release of their acclaimed debut â€œFamily Lifeâ€, Abbie Gale are back with their second album, symbolically titled â€œ2â€. The music style of the band changes perceptibly, the sound becomes more electric and the rhythm most intense, without losing the melody that characterizes them. Guided by the charming, wide-ranging voice of Evira, the band appear more mature than ever, as they present their compositions in a solid and determined fashion. The albumâ€™s excellent production values, combined with Abbie Galeâ€™s confident playing, make â€œ2â€ an exciting listening proposition.
  Starting with the introspective mood of the opening track â€œLife After Lifeâ€, Abbie Gale guide us through a bright playful conversation in â€œLovesongâ€ (guest featuring Raining Pleasureâ€™s frontman Vassilikos), sparks of lyricism such as â€œClownâ€ and â€œAirâ€ and an agonizing spoken-word manifesto in â€œDankoâ€. The bandâ€™s dedication to their creative vision, along with their refined sense of songwriting and their honest inspiration make for an aesthetically flawless result.

  Abbie Galeâ€™s â€œ2â€ is also the debut release of the new and upcoming indie label Inner Ear.
