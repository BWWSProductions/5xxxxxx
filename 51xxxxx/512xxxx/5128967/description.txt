PLOT

Ted Bundy was a young man on the rise. His four year killing
spree terrorized co-ed dorms across America and led the police
on a cross country manhunt that would later lead to Bundy
escaping twice from police custody to continue his murderous habits.

While using different identities and disguises to elude capture
Bundy finds his way to Florida to commit what becomes his last
murders before being caught and tried in a court of law.

Using his law school savvy to defend himself in his own murder case,
Ted Bundy clearly proved himself to be one of the smartest and
most notorious serial killers in the history of America before
being convicted and sent to the electric chair in 1989.

This film details the dark psyche and previously unexplored
motivations of the man who became known as one of the most
notorious serial killers to leave behind a legacy of evil.
