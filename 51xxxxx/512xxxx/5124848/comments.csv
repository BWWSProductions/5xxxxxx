Lame graphics
Lame Storyline (ohhh, a woman who kills fears, oooooo) LAME
Toooooooo simple, just move and shoot"
,sus2912,2009-10-15T07:17Z,"@The.Genius.of.the.Hole
then dont download it whos asking u to download it and thanks shroo for uploading as there are not many games now a days so its good to play atleast this thanks for the rip
and its not that bad and if u consider storyline then 60% are not worth playing thanks shroo"
,bigturd,2009-10-15T10:18Z,Thanks Shroo.
[V],Shroo,2009-10-15T18:43Z,whats the problem?
,TheDude156,2009-10-15T19:21Z,"first off, thnx shroo for this.  I might have the same prob as xfire.  Going to c:\Doc & Set\Username\My documents\Aspyr\Dreamkiller\debug\error.txt  under ""crash information"" it says ""fault message: pack file level_MPD01_Gothic.mpk not found""  I hope this helps shroo and thanks again!!!"
,TheDude156,2009-10-15T19:24Z,"sorry for the double post, but my hunch is it's looking for the mutiplayer levels and I know they've been ripped, so that maybe the conflict and why we can't start the game. "
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-10-15T20:42Z,"sus, the game sucks and I feel like I totally wasted bandwidth on such a bad game, 1 day of downloading this because it looked cool, but it's just a move and shoot game (no strategy AT ALL), you can't even crouch, and it's room after room of enemies, the graphics, again, suck, GTA san andreas beats it, why the hell did I installed new physx controllers for? This is my review of the game. It only looks cool because the character is a woman, AND ITS NOT TPS!!!"
