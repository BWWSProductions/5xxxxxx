,awudu,2009-10-20T04:05Z,"After patching, when you try to open IDM, it  opens up the registration box sometimes asking you to enter details, but after trying to enter fake details many times it opens up then in the about IDM page, it shows your registered user's name there and within some time, it would change again and it would start asking you to enter details again....

Don't you have anything like first name, last name, email and serial to give Tauseef?
