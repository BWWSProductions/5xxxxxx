[V],Kuthumi,2009-10-14T18:41Z,I always download verifire's torrents when they attract negative comments from 'godswallops' and other people who do not dare to believe in anything. It usually signifies that the film is interesting.
[T],verifire,2009-10-15T08:39Z,@Kuthumi: Not a bad idea.. :-)

,allmypeople,2009-10-20T05:09Z,religious garbage?
[T],verifire,2009-10-20T12:14Z,"@allmypeople: No, ""religious garbage"" is also an expression totally dependent of point of view, it is not objectively spoken, but subjectively. Ergo; the question is impossible to answer. But in my opinion, this isn't religious garbage, but scientists actually raising and  sorting the evidence for and against the popularly called ""evolution-theory"" versus the things they have discovered. I refer to description above comments.
Sum (but it's very interesting to watch the microbiology and research involved here, in my humble opinion) is that Darwin's theory may well explain some of the minor changes in the different species, but can not explain neither the origin of life, nor the variety in species all together. To say the least. Yet, Evolution is taught to be facts, while the massive evidence against it is mainly left out in literature and textbooks. Except for references like; ""some think that.... but....""

As an example, and there are many like these (I refer you to the ""Creation Series""), but once a team of paleontologists were digging down the many, many million year depsits of layers in an area know for it's many fossils, only to find standing still on its roots a tree (petrified, but a tree) perpetrating million upon millions of deposits. As we all know, this is impossible, unless the tree was instantly buried under all those depository layers. Such deposits occur mainly in water, suggesting a major flood once had drowned the area, and deposited first the heavier objects, then the lighter and so on, until it was all covered with protection against corrosion. And this is the case with so many of the evidence we see all around us. Like the fact that trees that is left in the woods, doesn't slowly get covered with deposits. They rot and are gone in a few years, earth again.
Whilst for instance the oil we pump out of the ground once were lush forests that suddenly was covered with sediments and were transformed into hydro-carbons..

Thank you for your question, and this opportunity to explain it more thorough. V."
,truthfinder,2009-11-15T23:37Z,"Wow this is unbelievably interesting and educating, now I'm not asking anyone to teach creationism in schools but at least teach this... this makes unrefutable sense, it just goes to show you that that yes there is a secular conspiracy out there."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-19T12:13Z,"Sorry Verifire, you can mock the others if you want but you won't get away from the FACT of evolution.
This really and truly is a crock of shit. It is a film made by the discovery institute who are just a front for Intelligent Design and getting it into schools.
The scientists they claim are so educated in the film are actually for the most part, discredited scientists, scientists who published papers on this subject and were pretty much laughed at by the rest of the scientific community.
Now, I can already hear cries of 'discrimination!' and stories of how these scientists should be allowed to believe what they like and not be ridiculed but wait!  science isn't a fucking fairness exercise, it isn't school. It is adults and it's about facts and truths, evaluation based on evidence that can be verified.
Intelligent design is nothing more than a disguise for the bible and a way of getting people to be religious.
I see you parrot the usual crap about Darwin there, you see: Darwin and Evolution DO NOT CLAIM TO KNOW THE ORIGINS OF LIFE!
That is a different fucking subject idiot!
Stop mixing the two so you can say Darwin is a fool!
You are the fool if you don't know the difference between cosmology and evolutionary biology.
It is so blatantly obvious that there is NO SCIENCE in ID, that it deserves to be laughed at as a theory of science!!!!
This film really is BAD Pseudoscience.
Or good pseudoscience I suppose if it convinces anyone that it is actually real science.
DO NOT BELIEVE THIS FILM!"
[T],verifire,2009-11-19T17:32Z,"@Faegin: Please do get off my back. I'm tired of you. Besides; all you accomplish with your anti-campaigns are to reveal that you have no idea what you are talking about.

I've said it before, and I'll say it once more: STOP spamming my uploads, like I'm staying off yours.

Get a grip. YOU take a reality check. If you fail it, then don't come back with more quasi-politically-correct ""scientific proof"". Just upload some Dawkins or Anton la Vey or Crawley or something. Whatever. Just spare us the embarrassment of reading your spam. Get it? Or do you still think you've got the right to throw shit, just because you've got a pink skull?

I don't know. What I know, is that you're spamming me, and I'm sick of it. Grow up and lay off, like I lay off you. Don't respond to this. Just back off."
[T],verifire,2009-11-19T17:41Z,"And seriously: If Darwin doesn't claim to know the origin of life, and I NEVER SAID HE DID EITHER, but these ""discredited guys"" (like most the people who in the long run end up in the hall of fame must endure, because ""Genius, like a thunderstorm, comes up against the wind"", to quote Kierkegaard) do actually offer a explanation to life's origin.
WHY IS THAT SO INCREDIBLY WRONG TO DO?
Evolution can't. Creation can. Archeology fails to prove evolution, but points to creation, and a big deluge. FOR INSTANCE.

But again, Faegin: Get off my back. You are burdening me, annoying me. At least I'm honest about it. I lay off your uploads, and you leave me alone. That's the only reasonable thing to do. But I guess you'll prove once again that you think you descend from the apes.. I hope you will restrain yourself though. I'm bored."
[T],verifire,2009-11-19T18:00Z,"To those who wonder why this guy just pisses me off at the moment, check out the link to this upload of his, and see the date and my comment and all. Then figure out why I get so annoyed by putting up with this spam. He's just obnoxious. I've got a feeling he wouldn't be so tough out in the real world.. but that's another subject.

Follow link and see how I've humiliated and mistreated him:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4842182

Yeah, we've had a couple of ""discussions"" before, but I thought he had quieted. I was wrong. I'm leaving his obnoxious self alone, and he can do the same with me and my uploads. I hope someone agrees with me.. V."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-20T00:15Z,"Verifire. Let's get a few things straight here.
1. If I didn't have a pink skull I would be the very same person I am now so you get over that.
2. Stop with all the 'you're picking on me', 'you're spamming my torrents', 'you're on my back' etc etc et-fucking cetera... it's pathetic. We are adults right? try being one then instead of acting like a big BABY! You might say I'm being childish with my attitude or my words but come on! You harp on and on about it as if I am bullying you or something and then you even post a link to show how nice you have been to me.
How cute.
I know. The christian persecution thing. Well it isn't happening mate. You are playing the victim.

I notice that you say I am not to reply but then you cannot resist going into the topic once again to tell me what YOU think.
Well I am telling you what I think. Live with it.
You say 'Evolution can't (provide an answer to the origins of the universe [of course it can't it doesn't even try to!] ) and you say 'creation can'.
Can it really?
This video does NOT prove that or anything close to it.
This video just hums and haws in awe and amazement at the universe (whilst trying to impress and even confuse the layman with cool Computer graphics) and then concludes every few minutes that it MUST be a god that is responsible because this or that proves it!!
It does NOT prove anything, to show a complex part of nature and then say it is proof of God is to show a complete lack of what evolution means entirely.  It is also a logical fallacy to jump from a complexity to a god. That is not rational reasoning at all.
Why is claiming such nonsense so wrong to do?
Let me enlighten you. It erodes the very core of what it is to be a rational, functional and learned, human being.
If ID is to be taught in schools it is a BIG step backwards in human evolution and I don't just mean in a Darwinian sense I mean a huge backwards step in intellectualism for every generation that is taught that this CRAP is as relevant or true as 'real science' because it is not.
'Archeology fails to prove evolution, but points to creation, and a big deluge...'
Archaeology does indeed prove, or help to confirm I should say, evolution. In fact there is such a huge amount of corresponding and parallel evidence via archaeology that it completely blows your ID theory out of the universe (wow a pun!).
So now I know you have studied archaeology in-depth eh... a scientist no less.
No more than I am a baker.
Then you are back to that old 'persecution' nonsense again - ...'Faegin: Get off my back. ...' '... I lay off your uploads..' hey I don't care what you do mate. Lay off my uploads? They aren't precious to me you know. they are there. that's all. Fill your boots, as they say.

Well there really isn't much else to say to you. I already realised you are not for turning but what the hell, YOU are peddling this crap so YOU are  responsible and so YOU are the one that gets people's impassioned responses. If you can't deal with that then maybe you are in the wrong job/religion/cult/mental home/century?

You probably thought you were being hilarious with this one - '..But I guess you'll prove once again that you think you descend from the apes.. '
except, again you show how little you have actually looked into the topic you claim to know so much about.
Evolutionary theory (FACT) does not and never has claimed such a feat!
I'll educate you for free - Apes and humans have a common ancestor. We are not descended from apes and apes are not descended from humans.
OK you got that now?
Now this last point is about how obnoxious I am.
Noxious perhaps, to you. I'm OK with that.
Get this in your head: You are peddling a load of bullshit and it's not just this torrent, you have a lot of them. all pseudoscience or religion and in your descriptions, like this one, you tell how TRUE it is. I find that to be abhorrent.
If I get angry in responding then that is a fact of life.  That is what happens 'in the real world' and I act exactly the same here or there (for your info).
I won'"
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T14:31Z,Faegin. Go away. Find something to upload. Burn a Bible. What ever. In short. Go away.
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-20T15:08Z,verifire: Go fuck yourself with a banana you deranged cunt.
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T20:02Z,"@Everyone: Please excuse me for not replying to this person anymore. I hope he'll disappear if I just ignore him. In the meantime; everybody can choose whether to download or not my torrents.
That's so cool.. :-)"
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-25T13:22Z,"@verifire: I seriously doubt whether you need to apologise to anyone for not having the ability to respond to any of my criticisms, no one gives a fuck mate.
You either have a superiority complex or an inferiority one.
It can be so difficult to tell with religious buffoons as they swing wildly from one to the other so often.
Your previous comment is unconvincing but, as you say, carry on Sir!"
[T],verifire,2009-11-28T12:06Z,"Feagin: You've got no idea what's happening, do you? Except for your foul language and expressing you discontent against me and my upload, you're really not convincing anybody yourself, I think, about anything else but that. And I wish you well.. Amazing.. Sorry I made the assumption that you'd get off my back if I just ignored the shit you're throwing my way. I was wrong. Hope you'll come to your senses before you get a stroke. You'll certainly not gat off it if you don't get a stroke of genius. It could happen. My God is a very good God, who forgives and gives freely very good things to people, like my self, who doesn't deserve it.. There is a price to pay, though, and right now you're the one presenting the bill to me. And I have to defend Him and His creation and all He is. Again. Which is great, but tiresome when people do not want to hear, but instead hurls foul language and are obnoxious. But it's a small price to pay for what I've been given.. 

Peace on you, Feagin."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-12-01T18:11Z,"HEY! I said FUCK YOU asshole and don't make the assumption that you are even welcome to wish me anything.
Take your insecure false love and peace and shove it up yer fucking arse.
Moron."
,aeh45322,2009-12-19T19:53Z,Thanks for this torrent!  I've been browsing around the Amazing Facts website trying to find more DVD's to keep me busy on Sabbath.  I really appreciate this.
,sandshreder,2009-12-22T20:00Z,"I love how atheists hide behind things like ""science is truth"". well unfortunately the science in the text books is not always accurate or true. in addition it is sometimes a complete lie. moreover any science that may contradict evolution is often left out of textbooks completely. There is a movement in the scientific community to hide anything that discredits evolution. Lets look at some facts...

evolutionists tell you that DNA mutates and we have these improvements in Biological functions.
the FACT is there has never been a mutation observed that was not harmful to a biological process or function.

Now ask yourself these questions...

How did natural selection develop (over millions of years) ears to hear with when life did not and could not know sound existed?

How did natural selection produce eyes when it could NOT know light existed?

How can the first Male and female sex organs develop in two different organisms at the same time AND work together for the first ever mating process? you want me to believe two similar organism just happened to evolve with two different sex organs that just happen to work together to create off spring?

Now I ask, who is really spreading ferry tales...

God Bless you all, I could go on for hours but atheists are not worth the time.

Jesus says dont throw pearls to pigs... so dont wast time with atheists "
