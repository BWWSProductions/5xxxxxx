,BayRaider,2009-10-16T11:25Z,"No, it's actually a French film,,, i really liked it after watching it on tv a few year's back so bought the dvd,,, it is English dubbed but its very well done, prob the best ive seen and i usually hate dubbed film's...

Although i wouldn't class it as a horror it does have some gripping parts,,,, 

Great movie to watch late at night....."
