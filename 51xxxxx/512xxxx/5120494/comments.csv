,dulcet,2009-10-13T12:50Z,"I realize this is not for 360, there is no Xbox category on PB.
Reuping my torrents that were on demonoid so more emus coming.
They will all be marked for original xbox."
,mikels12,2009-11-14T02:23Z,Hi how do i get these to work on the origanal xbox do i need it modding or owt or do i burn to disc etc please let me know as would be good to play some of these games again
,kinang26,2009-11-25T10:13Z,"stupid question, but will this work on 360? if so, what do i need to do to make it work other than download it?"
,Bigcrunkone,2009-11-30T04:47Z,Awesome Downloaded nice and quick.. now one question.. does this have to be copied to my xBox or can i just use it on a CD?  and do i have to extract all the rom files?
,dulcet,2009-12-19T09:51Z,"mikels12 - Your xbox does need to be modded to play this look at http://www.productwiki.com/microsoft-xbox/article/how-to-go-from-xbox-to-xbox-media-center-in-30-minutes.html

kinang26 - This is for the original xbox and can't speak for it running on the 360. I am 99% sure it won't. Now you can run Unsigned code on a 360, but you got to jump trough a lot of hoops to do it and i am sure they will have to rewrite all the emulators to get them to work on the 360.

Bigcrunkone - This will run from the hard drive or a disc. Might need to build an xiso of the emulator with cxbox tool or Qwix to get to load."
