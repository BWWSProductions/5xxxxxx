,iklsjicbryanharley,2009-10-17T23:26Z,SEED PEOPLE!!!
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-17T23:59Z,I haven´t got the whole nfo file yet but in the small part that I do have it says TXF which is the release group Tax free and I don´t think they have ever released a game before... I hope I'm wrong but I think it´s fake... 
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-18T00:30Z,Now I have the whole nfo and it doesn't say TXF any more... Strange... You should probably ignore my claims about it being fake then...
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-18T10:02Z,It´s Italian.

,JTyler1990,2009-10-19T03:48Z,"hey totally not on the subject of pes, but when i come to click download torrent link (on any link) jus over the last two days it refers me back to google with ""ooops link appears to be broken"" anyone any ideas why????"
,ShineEyes,2009-10-19T09:19Z,"Torrents from Morck22 will never be fake.  Hope this is all cleared up now.  And PAL usually means it won't work on an NTSC system.  Most people who upload 360 games nowadays know to put ""RF"" if the game is region free.  When in doubt though, google is your friend."
,123errolf999,2009-10-19T10:56Z,Havent been able to download the torrent for two days. Whats wrong? Same problem as JTyler1990.
[V],Morck22,2009-10-19T13:40Z,"Piratebay will be dead early, if anyone is interested on new uploads, can take it from bajandojuegos.eu
or mininova by the uploader name of kaspersky"
,ShineEyes,2009-10-19T13:49Z,"Is something up with the site? No new torrents in days.  If you've got any inside info, please share.  I'm startin to worry, man."
,milko101,2009-10-19T14:36Z,morck22 will kaspersky be a trusted guy to get games off ?
,milko101,2009-10-19T14:39Z,and does anyone KNOW that this it for TPB ?
,milko101,2009-10-19T15:03Z,i think its working fine now ! it lets you download the torrents anyway !
[V],Morck22,2009-10-21T12:23Z,"kaspersky its the same guy than Morck22 xd

But at Mininova we choose that nick"
[V],Morck22,2009-10-21T15:44Z,"The problem its upload torrent, sometimes it crash and its imposible to upload the torrent file.

So if you want & pirate dont works, at butacadivx.net/
