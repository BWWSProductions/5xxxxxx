Three Extremes took you to the edge, now Three Extremes II pushes you over with three more nightmarish tales of terror from Kim Jee-Woon (A Tale of Two Sisters), Nonzee Nimibutr (Nang Nak) and Peter Chan (Producer of The Eye, The Eye 2 and Three Extremes). 
The work of three of Asia's most prominent horror directors comes together in this creepy collection of shorts. In Ji-woon Kim's "Memories," a husband awakens to find a mutilated body in his car; meanwhile, his wife wakes up with no memory of her former life. In Nonzee Nimibutr's "The Wheel," a Thai village is terrorized by colorful puppets. And in Peter Chan's "Going Home," a father is held captive by a man who keeps his dead wife "alive."
