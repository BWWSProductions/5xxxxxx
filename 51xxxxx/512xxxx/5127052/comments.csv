,NikThomps,2009-11-12T22:43Z,"an explanation on how to properly use this Keygen would be great!  there are so many buttons it is unclear how I am supposed to use it.  Please put it in the description or upload wth an NFO, thanks"
,stalker2755,2009-12-09T14:17Z,"Don't know if what I wrote applies anymore... it's from june:

Run the keymaker during install and add keys to white-list.
The key displayed, needs to be copied to the installer whn asked.

If after installation the keys are erquired again, do the same thing (eg white-list them) but without any nero application open.

Remove NeroPatentActivation.exe from Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Nero\AdvrCntr4"
,stalker2755,2009-12-10T01:01Z,"Write... here it is:
1. run the installer
2. run the keymaker and generate a key
3. add it to the white list, but clean that list first if it's dirty
4. copy it and paste it to the installer when asked

If you don't have a firewall to block the setup or disabled the network connection, it might be time to do so... else, the setup will phone home and remove that serial from the white list!


5. close the keymaker before the installation finishes!
6. once installed, don't run any apps! run the keymaker again if no nero apps are still loaded
7. press the license manager button... if there are no licenses, you need to generate another one and add it to white-list. What did I tell you about the damn setup phoning home ?!?!?!
8. select from the product list the activation one like Activation (Nero 9)
9. now that button that was add to white list is now register... press it, obviously!
10. close the keymaker

You might want to check the license manager to have at least two product codes in!

11. NOW you can run Nero!

Bark! bark!

Also, NeroPatentActivation.exe from Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Nero\AdvrCntr4 can be removed for a safer and more pleasant Nero usage experience! :)

BTW, also older version of the keymaker works... just that they don't close properly... meaning the stay in ram! so taskmanage them."
