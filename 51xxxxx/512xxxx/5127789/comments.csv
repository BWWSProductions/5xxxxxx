http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/09/19/abc-still-intends-to-finish-defying-gravitys-run-eventually/ 

And copy pasta:

According to Nicole Marostica, a publicist for the show on ABC, the show has not been canceled, contrary to recent speculation. The show had always been scheduled to appear for eight weeks, with Brothers & Sisters returning to television on September 22nd. The network continues to review its scheduling options for the show. However, the show's future prospects are not exactly bright as it continues to shed viewers, and come in last in the ratings of the four major networks.

take what you will YMMV"

,Leffebongo,2009-10-17T18:14Z,SEED dammit! :D
,President_Kush,2009-10-17T19:24Z,"the reason why this show continues to loose viewers is because 1 its not promoted... and 2 people know that a second season is unlikely.

I didn't even know this show existed until about 4 episodes in.  One night i was bored and went to abc.com and just stumbled across it"
,President_Kush,2009-10-17T19:25Z,and btw... thanks again err0001 for these last couple episodes
,Bombardem,2009-10-18T06:51Z,"This show is so fucking good, and all the other dramatic shows on the major networks are so fucking bad. It makes me sick that a show like Southland gets advertised every 8 minutes, but a show like this gets no hype at all."
,pants13,2009-10-18T07:58Z,Thanks so much err0001!
,xNZx,2009-10-18T12:24Z,"Thanks for the up bro, people have lost interest now that it's not being screened on ABC."
