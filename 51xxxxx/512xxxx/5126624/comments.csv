No need to use anything from here - with a file that can contain viruses and trojan...

Pick up the latest Winzip14 at 

http://www.winzip.com/

and then use:

Winzip14 Serial:

name:WinZip

Serial:F7LH3-ZHK80-EJ7EF-WX4XC-HQW01-MGN9X

It works perfectly!

[T],jmb2012,2009-10-23T19:05Z,"@LbL  Who the f*ck are you? 

Don't listen to this peckerhead. Obviously this torrent is clean. I know, I use it. Go be a dick elsewhere."

jmb2012:  And just WHY should people pick up Winzip14 HERE, when it's SO much Faster to just pick it up from the Original site, and then also be SURE that there ain't no Virus and/or Trojan included...

So - AS i said... Pick up the latest Winzip14 at 

http://www.winzip.com/

and then use:

Winzip14 Serial:

name:WinZip

Serial:F7LH3-ZHK80-EJ7EF-WX4XC-HQW01-MGN9X

It works perfectly!

[T],jmb2012,2009-10-24T14:24Z,"you are a Idiot!! What to you think I do. I get the installers from the site (like you). I look for keys and crack on the web(like you), but unlike you(a dick) I package what I get, and upload it to share. If there was a virus somebody would of said something, No need for your input. Go find a torrent that's actually infected to steer people away from.

And you're a Very Mature person, that now tries to mess up with my uploads, ONLY due to that you now THINK i have messed up with your upload...

WHICH i have NOT!

I ONLY told people to get the file from the original site, and i told the people the Serial they need, and that's it!

WHY did you have to be so childish as to write that a Music Movie can contain a Virus ...

IDIOT!

,RadGH,2009-11-01T09:35Z,Thanks for the upload. Normally just download winzip and get a key but the site i normally use had none for v14. Had it running with LbL's name/serial before the torrent finished - but thanks anyway!
,psykotic57,2009-11-08T22:09Z,Great upload! Serial works fine. Thanks for everything!
,end0fdayz,2009-11-14T21:42Z,"Thanks for the working serial, LBL! Worked a charm with the download from winzip's site. :)

Just a note, LBL: if you offer serials on somebody's torrent page again, it would be better to just give it without a borderline insinuation about the original uploader's file(s).  ;)

I appreciate your & jmb2012's contributions... but to be honest, no one who takes the time to make sure they offer clean files enjoys seeing a comment on one their torrent pages mentioning ""viruses""...  ;)

Have a great day, everybody! Thanks for sharing!"
,jules9261,2009-11-28T17:25Z,thanks for the download it has NO viruses and works a treat
,Sparx10,2009-12-06T05:27Z,works great! thanks!!
,jilk22,2009-12-12T22:34Z,"I was so bored I actually did it both ways on two seperate laptops next to each other. They both work great. 
The torrent was slower but it stll worked fine... no viruses.
Lbl, maybe u can think of a different way to differ people ot the original website than lie about things like that."

,Kanga666,2011-03-27T12:12Z,Thanks jmb2012! works perfectly.  :-)
,Spoork.bz,2011-04-14T10:50Z,"Who needs WinZip when Windows has built-in support for creating, opening, and extracting zip files? I pity the fool who actually pays money for this."
