,dark_isle,2009-10-15T06:25Z,Um....what's the difference with 64? I'm fairly new to this...and will this empty my hard drive? I'm using Vista. Tnx! 
[T],movieFOX,2009-10-15T09:44Z,"You should install this on a seperate H/drive or partition to your main operating system.
The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.
So your cpu will either be 32bit or 64bit governing what version you can install."
,m2hs5l,2009-10-15T18:17Z,"i have a few questions, i am using vista 32 bit at the moment but would like to get this on my pc. Is this one  32 bit or 64 bit? does it work correctly as it should?"
