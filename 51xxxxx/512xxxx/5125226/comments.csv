,Myself,2009-10-18T06:11Z,"I downloaded 360 and I can't download other torrents now, what's the problem?"
,prominence_user,2009-10-18T09:10Z,"hey there
i need help here
all goes well during the installation
and followed all steps closely
butmy days are not reset everytime i restart computer
i even tried to click subscribe now but it doesn't change
does it mean i need to run ntr every now and then?"
,prominence_user,2009-10-18T09:17Z,oh sorry. seems that my problem is fixed in this release. thanks RH
,tedwu,2009-10-18T12:59Z,"Rat, looks like piratebay might be down a while can't download. Thus I cant get any software. "
,tedwu,2009-10-18T13:04Z,"Wow, I don't know how it works but it would appear you could read as I type. Ya, this sucks that priatebay is down. I need a new virus scanner. BD 2010 is top rated however it doesn't now work for me. Crackers tried but failed."
,prominence_user,2009-10-21T10:51Z,"yup. piratebay is down for couple of days alright
anyway, im havin problem
the ntr does not reset my subscription days back 165
is it suppose to be so?"

,Final_Fulgore,2009-11-05T23:36Z,"Thanks a lot RH !!!
I just installed it and after a restart it all seems fine. Hopefully it will stay that way.
I just have some questions:
Do I need to have any specific settings on or off (i.e. Early Load, SONAR Protection, Non-Admin Access to Settings, Norton Product Tamper Protection, etc.)???
How does the trial reset works? Does it run every time Windows starts? Does the subscription days run out normally? Do I have to run the trial reset after the 165 days?

Thanks in advance.
Great work :-)"

Been fine...no problems for over 4 days now. I got the patch right away by accident.
