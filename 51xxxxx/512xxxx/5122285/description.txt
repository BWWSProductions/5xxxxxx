"Paranoid Park" is a very interesting movie because it looks at one teenager's battle with guilt and dealing with real trouble which alot of young teens get into nowadays. "Paradoid Park" is the story of one such teen who accidentally kills a security guard along a set of railway tracks and tries to hide the fact that he did it after a series of investigations by detectives at his school (including his being interviewed by a detective one on one).

The story is great, but a bit on the dull side because despite the producers and director's best efforts, I found that the teenage actor who portrayed the troubled kid did not did not portray the guilt and struggles that he was feeling strong enough which made the movie seem pale in comparison to other teenage movies where the theme of guilt is involved.

Still, "Paranoid Park" is still worth a look because of it's interesting story line (taking place at a skateboard park that goes by the movie title's name). Slow moving, but provocative and also can be referred to as a "thinking audience's" movie, which is good. The ending was rather flat, because it failed to tie everything together and that was disappointing.

Teen's will be teens and that's how they were portrayed (obviously). The storyline was great, but could have been better presented for the screen. "Paranoid Park" does do a good job of teaching the lesson about, what happens when you get into trouble and don't do anything (the guilt racks up immensely). This is still a good movie for teens and adults to watch (even together).
