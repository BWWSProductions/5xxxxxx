[V],Morck22,2009-10-12T15:21Z,I'll bring it to you soon.
,tpbking,2009-10-12T15:29Z,why is it 13.39 gigabytes? is it 2 discs?
[V],Morck22,2009-10-12T15:35Z,Yes 2 DVD
,andy8552,2009-10-12T15:44Z,"""USA"" means NTSC only? Not RF?"
[V],Morck22,2009-10-12T15:52Z,"Only for NTSC/U consoles

Disc 1: game
Disc 2: extra tracks & cars.

Disc 2 installs content on your Hdd drive for use with disc 1"
,ankit1991_007,2009-10-12T15:59Z,will it work on ntsc j???
,andy8552,2009-10-12T16:11Z,Thanks for instructions.:) Will wait for PAL.
,mapaboy,2009-10-12T21:14Z,"Wow this is ridiculous, I'm uploading at 40kb/s but downloading at 5kb/s. So come on people, SEED!"
,mapaboy,2009-10-12T21:15Z,"By the way, thanks a lot for the game Morck22!"
,tpbking,2009-10-12T21:38Z,"ive got an arcade console so disc 2 won`t be that important for me will it?
or will the game only work with both discs?"
,ShineEyes,2009-10-12T21:44Z,"You can play with just the first disc.  Second disc is only to install if you want all of the extra cars and such.  Awesome to have, but not necessary at all :) What I'd suggest is to burn both so you have all the extras if you do eventually pick up a hard drive (which I REALLY REALLY suggest)  You can get an adapter for the hard drive port that lets you use any size/physical size hdd you want."
,oilcover,2009-10-13T18:18Z,anyone know if this is abgx legit?
,zippzor,2009-10-13T21:58Z,Get up PAL-version now please :D

,lamboleap760,2009-10-14T23:04Z,Yea Once again Thanks A lot
,pystdante,2009-10-16T01:21Z,"@ Shineeyes What is this HD adapter you speak of?
I have an almost full 120GB, it would be awsome to run a 1 TB drive on my xbox"
