First released in 1971, this album contains tracks recorded from 1951 to 1967. The oldest songs are "They Call Me Muddy Waters" and "Howlin'Wolf". These songs feature guitar by Muddy and Harp by Little Walter. The late fifties tracks offer a fuller band sound. The mid-sixties songs are excellent - "When The Eagle Flies" and "Bird Nest On The Ground" are particularly infectious. The only complaint about this album is that it's only 34 minutes long - But then it's the quality, not the quantity that counts here.
