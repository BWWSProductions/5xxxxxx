A psychotic college student studying serial killers attempts to throw a party, which he plans on turning into the ultimate mass murder. When the guests begin to disappear one by one, it appears as though he's getting his wish. It's black comedy all the way with none other than gonzo actor Jason Mewes (Jay, of Jay and Silent Bob fame) in the lead role. Snootchie Bootchies!
