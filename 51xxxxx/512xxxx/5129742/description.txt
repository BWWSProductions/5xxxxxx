Alley Baggett - Baba Collection
###############################

The BABA collection (Burg's Alley Baggett Archive) is composed of pretty much all Alley Baggett images.  Started way back in the late 90's and continues on growing to this day. I remember back then, Burg used to allow the collectors to host the pictures on their web space.

This collection is maintained over at alt.binaries.pictures.alley-baggett [USENET].
