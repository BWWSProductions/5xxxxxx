
The creatives behind the enormous success of Ministry of Sound's 'Anthems' series, and Universal's '12" 80's,' come together on Rhino to present a megalithic album of the biggest, best and most iconic dance anthems of all time in the form of 12" DANCE.

Straddling 3 decades of Dance and Club culture, CD1 focuses on the explosion of the iconic 12" single mix onto the embryonic club-scene of New York and Chicago in the 70's and its eventual take over of the world's dance-floors with timeless, powerhouse disco anthems from Chic `'Good Times', Sugarhill Gang `Rappers Delight', Sister Sledge `He's The Greatest Dancer', The Trammps `Disco Inferno', and tipping us into the next great dance movement with Blondie `Rapture' and Donna Summer `I Feel Love'.

CD 2 leads us into the 80's, evoking neon blooded rebellion and the rise of Pop, Rap and Techno/House featuring classic mixes of Miami Sound Machine `Dr Beat', Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five `White Lines', S' Express `The Theme...', Inner City `Big Fun', Womack and Womack `Teardrops', Marshall Jefferson `Move Your Body', Farley Jackmaster Funk `Love Can't Turn Around' and of course the biggest selling 12" single of all time New Order's seminal `Blue Monday'.

Pushing on into the hedonistic electro-dance fuelled 90s with a momentum that will leave you breathless for the next installation, CD3 features club classics from Adamski `Killer', Beats International `Dub Be Good To Me', Deelite `Groove Is In The Heart', C&C Music Factory `Everybody Dance Now', Crystal Waters `Gypsy Woman', Utah Saints `Something Good', Happy Mondays `Step On', `Jamiroquai `Space Cowboy', and that all time favourite No 1, Everything But The Girl `Missing'.

With the ultimate 24 carat track-list, crossing a plethora of genres from disco, soul, new wave, pop, rap, house, techno and beyond, stretching across 3 decades and numerous generations of youth & club cultures, and taking in 6 No 1s, 12" DANCE cannot fail to pull the heartstrings and evoke dance-floor moments for people of every age in every community, and looks set to become a huge force in the compilations market.
