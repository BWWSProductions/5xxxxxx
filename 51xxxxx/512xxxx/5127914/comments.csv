Sonatine (1993) 
Director:Takeshi Kitano
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108188/

In my opinion either you love this film or you hate it, there is no in between, since its so different from the standard or even great gangster movies of our time . I for myself was mesmerized by its artistic beauty, its compelling acting and its wonderful soundtrack. (IMDb)"
