This is the album NO OBLIGATION by AS SEKIRIA. This album is extremely rare and hard to find. It's as is AS Sekiria and Akira Sudou dropped off the face of the earth, partially I believe because the Meldac label went under. This was released shortly after they did the music for the Anime Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040. This album is great hard rock. Surprising they didn't take off.
