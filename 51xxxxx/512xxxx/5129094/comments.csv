,anonymous1920506,2009-12-19T21:20Z,"Hello

,Mallion,2010-01-03T05:46Z,"If you have 1.5 firmware, wave isn't important, it's the update to the dashboard to make it compatible with the new wave you need. 1.5 ignores wave completely but I never go on Live! or plug-in the cat5 for that matter unless I've swapped in the stock disc drive. You can avoid even going on Live! though by downloading the update from M$ website. If you do a Google search for the latest update you can throw it on the root of a usb drive & just plug it into your 360. Boot it and it should do the rest.
I was having the same problem with Assassins Creed II. I burned 6 coasters before I realized it had to be something other than the wave format. As soon as I updated the dashboard via Live! all 5 of the 6 coasters worked just fine."

Watch out, Big Brother is watching you.

Guess I need a kreon drive and do this myself."

,SinisterVin,2010-07-20T02:03Z,for the love of piratency! seed!!! i am very fallout deprived
,lastjedi,2010-07-20T17:00Z,there is no disc 2 on this file.if there was why is this only 6.2gib then?wouldnt it be more cause of the game and then all the downloaded content.i only found one file after downloading this.and the one file will fit on one dvd cause its only 6.2 gib.so maybe somebody here can answer this question for me.how can i have 2 dvds if all of this only fits on one dvd+r dl.
,Perrin162,2010-09-25T20:15Z,"@lastjedi  
This is only disk 2 of the GOTY edition for X-Box 360, as the title says.  If you need both disks, the uploader has a separate torrent for disk one, assuredly so that all of us dont have to only seed half if we only need the DLC.

Also, I only need the DLC.  I have a legit copy of the game.  If I updated my firmware and disconnected from the internet before installing the DLC from this disk, would it still work later when I reconnected to live?"
