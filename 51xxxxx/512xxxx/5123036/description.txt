Summary (IMDB):
An unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Only 1% 
of the population has survived by the year 2035, and is forced to live 
underground. A convict (James Cole) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in 
time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic (who he's 
told was spread by a mysterious "Army of the Twelve Monkeys") and locate the 
virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it. Unfortunately Cole is 
mistakenly sent to 1990, six years earlier than expected, and is arrested and 
locked up in a mental institution, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a 
psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and 
virus expert.  Written by Giancarlo Cairella {vertigo@imdb.com}

Playback:
I recommend using VLC. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/. It's my understanding
(read: unconfirmed) that Quicktime won't play more than 2 audio channels. Mac 
users may have some luck using the Perian component pack http://www.perian.org/
