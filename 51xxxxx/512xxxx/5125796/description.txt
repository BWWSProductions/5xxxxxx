Comic book produced by Epic Comics based on the movie Nightbreed by Clive Barker (Hellraiser).  

The story centers on Aaron Boone, a young man plagued by dreams of a city called Midian, populated by bizarre creatures and deviants of all types who refer to themselves as the "Nightbreed".  Aaron is framed for several murders by his psychopathic therapist and subsequently killed by police and resurrected by the magic of Midian.  Boone joins forces with the other monsters to defend them from the true monsters of the story: humankind.

The first four issues of the series adapt the film, which included significant differences from the finished movie, more closely related to Clive Barker's original script.  A two part Hellraiser vs Nightbreed: Jihad graphic novel was also produced, featuring the Cenobites as agents of order against their chaotic nemeses, the Nightbreed.  Nightbreed returned, in 1992, as a short story in the second issue of the four issue Epic: An Anthology series.
