Can't use as is.
Could you re-generate it (or something), please ?

TIA"
,Almarenan,2009-10-12T07:47Z,"Ooops, sorry...
Seems to have decided to work now.

We'll see."

...please keep seeding this one and/or keep it in your completed/seed queue after download.

I'll keep it in my seed queue for as long as I can after download"

99,6% from about 24hours...we need a little help here !!!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-07-06T15:55Z,"FOR ALL WHO ARE AT 99,6%:  I extracted from the incomplet image the folder VIDEO_TS with UltraIso and it plays....but the quality it's not  the expected one from a retail dvd [I think the retail wasn't dvd5 but dvd9...or vlc plays the dvd with some problems because the image wasn't complete].

Farewell my friends !"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-07-06T16:00Z,"Ohh...one more thing:  try on ...letitbit [google the title adding ""download"" and ""letitbit"" or ""filestube""] You'll get what you want: slowly but for sure complete and at good quality ! Use a download manager [Jdownloader].

See you...."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-07-06T20:05Z,"Thanks for the complete download, but the quality problem it's the same!!!!"
