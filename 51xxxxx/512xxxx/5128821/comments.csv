Q: What did Michael Jackson use as lubricant?

A: Children's tears!"

fast w/ lots of seeders"
,citrusheightskid,2009-11-02T04:05Z,"Just to clarify with this torrent- This is not the soundtrack for This Is It, but rather the audio from Michael's History tour from 1997. 

From Disc two, starting with Carmina Burana to Man in the Mirror, those tracks with the exception of The Way You Make Me Feel (which was pulled from the 30th Anniversary Special) were pulled from the Dangerous Tour from 1992. 

This is a great torrent for those who enjoy MJ live. "
