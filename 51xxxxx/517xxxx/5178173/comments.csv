,Agent33w,2009-12-11T23:52Z,Damn.  I'd download this just for Clap Your Hands.  Awesome u/l.
[T],sjbrand99,2009-12-12T15:51Z,@Agent33w: Got a bit more than you bargained for eh? :P
[T],sjbrand99,2009-12-20T20:04Z,"@nknock: Music is for sharing. I do encourage people to buy music and support the artists, however it is not possible to buy many of these tracks, as alot are unreleased or vinyl only releases.

People who download torrents like these are inspired to go and see the artists at gigs, and it is this increase in support that gains the artist what they want, and also money from shows, becasue lwets be honest no dubstep artist makes a living just from selling wax...

So enjoy the music, support the artists if you appreciate them and use this music to inspire you to dsicover their sound more and buy when you feel it is right for you.

No one should be forced to pay for music just to hear it..."
,etsienne,2010-01-12T02:34Z,"Nice Uploads man! I have a question: which artist have a VERY similar soud to Boy 8-bit?

thx"
[T],sjbrand99,2010-01-14T02:20Z,"@etsienne - ouch thats a hard one, he really does have a unique style. Te closest match would be various other electr/house type producers all mashed up into one sound and then you are still not close..."
[T],tzanev,2010-01-23T00:20Z,"Thanks a lot! This is a bit more of Skream than I actually handle though. I don't know when I'll manage to listen to all this. Very, very comprehensive stuff."

,i_am_sid,2010-09-11T16:48Z,"@sjbrand     (PLEASE REPLY)
Do you have discography of THE BUG. You have uploaded all dubstep artist. Why not THE BUG?
Thank for all your efforts."
,Wheezy,2010-10-18T08:07Z,"I think I just came...

Also sjbrand99 on your torrent/support argument. Most artists don't see 80% of what they make from records anyway. After record co. fees, management fees, production cost etc etc.
So my argument is the best way to support an artist is to go to the gigs support them that way because they will gain a much better profit from the gig and merch than they ever will from making albums and most of all enjoy the music anyway you can.
 You also make a very poignant point though when you say many of these tracks are not available any other way.

Thanks for a great up! "

,hxcColton,2011-06-10T18:39Z,"@ sjbrand99: I fucking love your torrents. Nobody puts anywhere near as much effort into dubstep discographies. You are the fucking man. :D.

Could you possibly make a Flux Pavilion one and a Zomby one? That would be mad sick."
