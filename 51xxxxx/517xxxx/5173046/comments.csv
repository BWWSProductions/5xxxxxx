DVD RIP? if it is, it's poor for a dvd rip"
,zoidman,2009-12-24T17:58Z,"Looks and sounds great on computer, but if you're going to put on DVD both suffer a bit. Also note that this is PAL format so get your toggles right if you need NTSC"
,jbr4353,2009-12-25T08:28Z,"@ zoidman

no it's not, it's an avi file format. has nothing to do with what version of dvd it encodes into. if it encodes wrong, you have your settings messed up."

,listenherenow,2010-01-18T15:14Z,"Hello, i wil tell teh truth as always. this does seem fine - great video and audio - right up to minute: 50.01

 That's when it goes to shit - on the computer its starts skipping all around - going in and out and it just sucks, you miss a load of the movie.

  on the Dvx player it stops completley and you never see the end - it will not go past 50.01 minutes.

   this is not some codec tha you didnt get on your system  - the things faulty.  i don't know what it is that caused it but its a bitch.   I was wanting to se the end proper now I have to load a new copy and hope that one is fked up like this one. "
