Groucho Marx had been on Dick Cavett's morning show a few times the year before.

Then he appeared on this first year of Dick's late-night show.  Groucho later returned a few more times after that.  Always the veteran comedian with funny stories, Groucho outlived all of his famous brothers.  Except for his singing, he was the perfect talk show guest!
