,^eRrOR^,2009-12-28T05:43Z,"jesus, 3 days I've been dowloading this... 3 days remaining 0_o C'mon, seed"
,^eRrOR^,2009-12-28T20:07Z,6 days.... I got em in 12 hours from Demonoid :O
,ozc,2010-01-01T16:37Z,Which set? Because I don't think any of the sets on Demonoid match the quality of this rip. Most are 400 lines while one is 720 lines which is an upscale.
,marqi,2010-01-02T15:28Z,Thank you so much for the instructions! The dual audio code was playing havoc with my system. Seeding...with many thanks!
,Seemp,2010-01-29T12:43Z,Thanks for the detailed instruction uploader. One Q: I use VLC. You know if this will play? 
,ozc,2010-02-25T16:32Z,"VLC works most of the time but its like a Fisher Price toy when it comes to usability. (does not support everything either) MPC has a simple consistent GUI but is more robust. Once you learn MPC you'll never use anything else. Some say nothings been done with it for years, I say its hard to improve perfection. You simply update the codecs, not the player. I have personally used MPC in Win2000, WinXP, Vista, & Win7. It is a routine install for every computer I work on and it opens faster than other media players, especially on older machines. "

lolindir9 I prefer Japanese as well but some people may not so if a dual audio / official subbed version is released I prefer to let other versions die off."
,veefeld,2010-03-28T21:55Z,"is it possible to play this without subtitles ?
because english subs under english dubbed is kinda annoying"
,ozc,2010-03-29T19:49Z,"veefeld, yes, thats why it says softsubs in the description. Meaning they aren't hard encoded into the video. Right click the codec icon on the right side of the taskbar and select ""no subs"" or whatever..."
,koudepinda,2010-06-29T00:51Z,good quality up till ep 17 from then it has a lot of lagging frames en ghosting 
,ozc,2010-07-04T16:12Z,"@koudepinda
You're the first to complain. The issue must be with your PC. "
,soryu,2012-05-12T10:16Z,"all episodes work fine,thanks."
