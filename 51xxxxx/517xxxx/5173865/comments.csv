,solamande,2009-11-22T03:34Z,"I just want to let everyone know that it's WHAM/George Michael night; a great follow up to last week's Queen night (I'm a big fan of Queen and I'm still seeding that torrent). I haven't watched all of this one yet but it should be a lot of fun. The sound and video quality is very good for a TV show.

Thanks again for uploading this stuff for us yanks.

I love Queen and really like George Michael but I'm not gay, really, I swear; throw a woman down on the floor in front of me and I'll prove it.

Thanks again for the upload."
