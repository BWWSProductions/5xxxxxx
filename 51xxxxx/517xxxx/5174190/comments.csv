,anjobanjo,2009-12-03T12:59Z,is ANYWONE seeding? been downloading this for a couple of days now....
,DL_King,2009-12-03T20:30Z,"There are 4 seeders, all of which are part of my networks and 239 leechers. How long did you expect a 30GB download to take. Seriously.

Thanks to all those who've been patient during the initial seed. Currently (Dec. 03/09 14:00 EST) seeded 78.2 % to the top leechers and expect completion for top seeders to be approx. Dec. 05/09 17:00 EST

Thanks and please seed to reduce d/l times

Enjoy"
,anjobanjo,2009-12-04T16:43Z,"I was expecting more then 1,5 kb/s, well, well, it's worth the wait."
,DL_King,2009-12-04T20:20Z,"Due to a power outage on my end, the estimated finish time has been moved back 8-12 hours.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Enjoy "
,DL_King,2009-12-09T19:50Z,"I find it sad that over 140 people have finished downloading this torrent and yet only 24 people have been good enough to seed for others. It gets annoying that the only people that seem to complain about download rates and the lack of seeders are the same scum suckers who only leech and don't reciprocate by continuing to seed after completion.  They also seem to be users that don't U/L anything themselves to the community. I don't mean to just rant but the only way that p2p transfers continue to work is by people seeding as much as they leech ie achieving a ratio of 1.00. 

So to the current 229 leechers I wonder, will you be douche bags? or will you share the wealth? Time will tell

Also I would like to thank all those 24 who have decided to seed. People like you are the SOLE reason I continue to U/L!!! Everyone d/ling should take a second to also thank these people.  BRAVO SEEDERS!!!!

On that note if there is any particular TV show that someone would like or is missing seasons for I'm always trying to decide what to U/L next. So any suggestions are more than welcome."
,Zeroknivez,2009-12-13T07:14Z,Are these DvD rips??
,Zeroknivez,2009-12-13T09:54Z,Judging from the first ep seems like it is ^_^ I will download and seed these for a long time thanks uploader.
,DL_King,2009-12-14T09:48Z,"@Zeroknivez
The majority of the episodes are HDTV recordings. On a couple of the episodes that I was missing from the collection they were torrents from the bay hence the problem with episode S02 E19 - Folsom Prison blues. Hope that answers your question.

By the way I've uploaded a replacement episode for S02 E19:

,blader88,2009-12-23T09:31Z,Hay I was wondering if anyone has seen fringe is so is that a possibility DL_King? 
,dpatt70,2009-12-25T07:51Z,"Thanks for the great uploads DL_King. Although I'm new to downloading torrents I certainly want to express my appreciation for your efforts and generousity. I will seed for a good while and agree with you that the least someone, especially one who doesn't upload content, should do is to keep seeding so everyone can benefit from this great opportunity to view stuff that many of us couldn't afford to purchase on their own.
Thanks again, Peace"
,DL_King,2009-12-31T06:04Z,"@blader88
