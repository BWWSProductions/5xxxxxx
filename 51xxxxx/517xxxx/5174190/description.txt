22 years ago Sam and Dean Winchesterâ€™s mother was horribly murdered in front of their father by something "supernatural". Their lives were never the same again. After that day their father, John Winchester, dedicated his life to hunting down the thing that killed his wife and every other evil thing on the way. He raised the boys as warriors with skills to fight back against the unknown and protect the innocent. 22 years later, Sam and Dean are grown up. Sam had gone away to school while Dean had remained hunting with his father. Itâ€™s not until their father suddenly disappears on a routine hunt. Sam and Dean search for their father and along the way help anyone with a supernatural problem with the help from their dad's journal, an encyclopedia of the supernatural that he has accumulated over his 22 years of none-stop obsessive hunting.


***Some People are having difficulty watching S02 E19 - Folsom Prison Blues. It freezes around 30:00min mark for about a minute. I'm sorry I didn't notice before Uploading. That being said I have a replacement torrent for any of those interested.
