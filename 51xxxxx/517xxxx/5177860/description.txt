note: 

bitrate bumped to 1920, try that for a bit.  All other settings remained unchanged from the rest. click on the direct-play tag to see the others.

I highly recommend playing h264 HD videos with VLC get it here: 
http://www.videolan.org/

I do not recommend playing with QuickTime/iIunes as QuickTime/iIunes is a dog and sucks at h264 decoding.  Only play with QuickTime/iIunes if you have a really powerful new PC.  VLC uses like 1/4 of the cpu power to play the same video.

If your video plays out of sync on your PC then please use VLC.  There are far to many variables regarding directshow filters that could attribute to your video playing out of sync on your pc.  VLC is a captured environment and does not rely on your local pc codecs and filters.

Plays fine on PS3, Xbox 360, Popcorn Hour, old pentium 4's (with VLC), and Apple TV most likely.
