,BuckRogers71,2009-12-07T10:18Z,"Hi aoloffline Hi All,
Could anybody help please : )

I use to downloaded HD movies and never had problems, Great Quality(720p/1080p) no errors no pixels. But from recent days i have problems with the movies, with a lot of pixel interfering, particulary the last ones like Moon, A Perfect Getaway and Gamer (also Galaxy Quest), does anyone have a similar problem?
How can i resolve this? codecs... 
I have K-Lite Mega Codec Pack 3.5.7.

Thanks and Regards."
,genesis99,2009-12-07T23:07Z,Yes. Everything encoded with the latest h264 version with wpredp=2 will cause problem on Oppo and LG BluRay players. I have to re-encode every movie with Handbrake but even the latest upgrade of Handbrake will cause problems.
,disimagery2,2009-12-14T22:22Z,"WD media player will play these HD rips no prob- easy to use / awesome quality.  
Best- no need to convert/ burn anything...just transfer to a usb HD and plug into the player[media player attaches to tv w/ HDMI].
Other companies are coming out w/similar HD players but have not used.  Best to check specs of each device for file/codec compatabilities."
,Tormonger,2009-12-15T08:38Z,"BEWARE!!!!
This is a snoop site set up to track the downloaders. A friend called me about some sh?? last week when I was using the wifi. 

Probably warner bros AOL??? GET IT???
Stupid movie anyway
They have been uploading movies, then monitoring who gets them. then tracing the IP and it's all ILLEGAL but use a proxy to protect yourselves. "
,LanMax,2009-12-16T19:23Z,"I don't think this is Warner Bros., or AOL.
Are you talking about your Internet provider or the Distributor of the Movie?"
,LanMax,2009-12-18T02:15Z,"Tormonger. That's nothing new. You just gotta find a way to be careful.
Thanks for the UL. Hi-Def:"

,simonthesomething,2009-12-19T00:32Z,"I have the same problem; Every time I try to play a 1080p movie it wont play prober; pixel interfering, video stops(audio keeps on going), the colours get messed up. I use VLC. Anybody who got a solution? Thanks"
,Agantyr,2009-12-19T17:00Z,"Thanks for the upload, uploader!  -- -- But: please leave these huge .MKV files to seed for longer than you usually would.  - There's quite a gap between the number leechers and the number of seeders, and this kind of ruins the spirit of christmas for me.. "
,Agantyr,2009-12-19T17:06Z,"@simonthesomething: try the K-lite codec pack which contains a version of media player classic on steroids. I never get any 'glitches' or artefacts using this, unless the files themselves are corrupt:

,bnyst,2010-01-17T16:29Z,I use VLC and never have a problem. I have a cheap computer on Ubuntu(linux) with a Gforce 7200 card that shares 500mb of the 2 1gb sticks. Computer sits under the tv and I just drag files from my desktop computer to the tv computer. I use an HDMI cable to the 1080x1920 res monitor(vizio LCD) Never get pixels and anything under 4GB per hour is ready to watch as soon as I drag the file(since VLC can start a movie without the whole file. Computer sends the 5.1 bose acoustimass I got on ebay for $300. very economical bluray player. Works great with a projector- all you need is an outlet on your plant shelf.
,bnyst,2010-01-17T16:44Z,"simonthesomething- I bet the bottle neck is your video card. I had the same problem when I first set up my stuff worked fine on the first few movies(less than 1.5gb hour)- When I tried to play a 9gb version of dark night the pixilation was terrible. I realised I had not loaded the nvidea drivers for the card. 5gb per hour video processing(esp. MKV or 264) seems to tax a system pretty well. A ton of processing required in a lossless bluray compressed in 1/2. If you use VLC, go to all under preferences and under codecs-> other codecs set the decoding option ""skip the loop filter for H.264 decoding"" to ""ALL"". I have neve had a problem no matter the size. My processor is a 3.5 YO 1.8mhz core2duo so if I can have a perfect picture, so can you. I might get a slight edge with linux since it is slightly more efficient."
,Johlysid,2010-01-27T19:12Z,Tormonger and gang what do you guys use for proxy? Thanks

Perfect movie!!!!! Thx!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,chefgeek,2011-03-21T06:42Z,"@Tormonger, is an IP  blocker like peerguardian2  http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/  the site also has great FAQ's and instructions on how to best configure, make sure to download and add block lists (can be found on same site) and you'll never have a prob again.  My ISP suspended me several times for copyright infringement, but no issues since running PG2.  Good luck, also there are great forums to help with the setup and config as well.

Thx for the upload"
