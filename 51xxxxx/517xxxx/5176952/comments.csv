,Borosid,2009-12-29T12:41Z,"Bubanne - How do I go about uploading some stuff?  Got hundreds of DVDs and CD's.
Never uploaded before and would like to give something back.
Where do you store your stuff is it online or on hard drive?  Totally new so all the advice you can give would be good. Cheers Borosid"

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-31T20:35Z,"@ZorMaster: Just noticed your post on this torrent.  Bubanee is a good friend of mine now on here, he has very kindly uploaded this Now 74 for us to all share on here.  I was the person who previously uploaded everything else before this one.  From between Now 1 to Now 73.  I won't be doing anymore Nows as I have left it up to Bubanee to continue doing these albums as they come out (about every 4 or 5 or so months they do).  I have certainly spent lots of time getting all the others together as best as I possibly can.  You won't find them better tagged or in better quality anywhere else on the net!  These are the best versions of each one that have ever been uploaded onto any torrent tracker."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-31T20:37Z,"You won't find anything better than those ones and bubanee's latests Now 74.  Sorry if those previous Nows aren't as good as the quality as this but it's because they are old now especially the early ones.  It took me a long time to tag them all correctly, I spent hours and hours.  The only way that somebody could make these better would be literally to buy every single double Now album (which would be expensive) and plus you would struggle to get them all on CD.  When they first started coming out they were tape releases as CDs didn't exsist then.

And about the bit rate of the music, come on , everybody  wants to take a dig on that! Please  grow up people, educate yourself
1)	In any music file, only for the complex portions the higher bit rate is used & rest is done with a low bit rate
2)	 Moreover as you increase the bit rate from 128 Kbps, only the subjective audio quality goes up, but not as dramatically as the change in quality is improved at lower rates
3)	I know any ASS can hear the difference between a 64 kbps MP3 and a 128 kbps Mp3. But when it comes to higher than 128 kbps finding difference ain?t that easy & at max its only 18% (average).
4)	Lastly, humans don?t have the ultrasonic ears as Bats & Dogs. So fuck yourself off when you say u can hear a difference b/w a 192 & a 256."
