Dogmas are simple explinations to complex questions. A curious child can easily bring down these dogmas. For instance who made God? Teaching people to accept these dogmas will cancel out some of their critical sence. Religion go easy over to fanatism. Islam have many bad things in its teachings about non believers and we see how easy it is for Islam extremists to recruit people to their holy war.

Muslims on a general basis is much more open to democracy than most people realise, but we shouldn't be afraid to criticize religion. "
