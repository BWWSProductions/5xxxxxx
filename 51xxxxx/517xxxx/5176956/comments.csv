720p as the header says or 
1920 x696  as the technical info says?

Original source?
Blu ray,hd-dvdrip or highdef-tv rip?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2009-11-24T17:40Z,It's 720p and HDitaly sources are always blu ray. it's a blu ray rip
,offset,2009-11-24T19:03Z,"ok! thanks.
This new blu ray source is remastered and the reviews are talking about good picture quality.

(I was asking because earlier published hd dvd  was not cleaned and remastered, so quality of HD rip was not so good.)"
,ManoloCIA,2009-11-24T23:15Z,"Awesome, thanks ! Let's hope they'll eventually release a blu-ray of the extended edition."
,grama_lama,2009-11-27T18:48Z,Italian subs are hard coded to video and I cannot find English audio.  
,ManoloCIA,2009-12-02T21:35Z,Change the audio stream to english and there are english subtitles as well. Excellent copy.

[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-23T11:11Z,"Thank you very much 50c3nt.

I hope grama_lama is talking double-dutch and the Italian subs are not hard-coded. 

Why is it always that when I go for a torrent with majority of peers being Italians(50% or more) I download 5 times less then I upload? I don't mind uploading a lot more then download but it's very curious. Is the internet in Italy so bad?
Many of them I upload 10 x more then I download from them. Right now my ratio is 5.7. at 65 %(weird)
I'm just asking, really, I'm not angry with them, I can be patient. Viva Italia ;-)

One would think that Russian internet is average but on a torrent with lots of Russians you download much faster then you can upload. interesting. Cheers."
