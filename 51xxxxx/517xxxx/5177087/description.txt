   Pump up your voice ! 
             
   The heart of the vocal designer plugin KLON is a harmonic pitch shifter for 
   natural pitch and formant manipulation of vocal sounds in realtime. 
             
   KLON takes your voice and adds up  to 16 different copies of your voice  in 
   realtime. This  lays the  ground for  an impressive  amount of applications 
   like:     
             
   - Choir generator 
   - Harmonizer 
   - Voice doubler 
   - Change voice's gender 
   - Pitch corrector 
   - Extreme voice manipulation 
             
   The 16 pitch shifters inside KLON are divided into 4 groups making it easy 
   to build up large choral parts from a simple, single vocal line. The  four 
   separate,  switchable groups  have their  own dedicated  set of  controls. 
   These controls  include an  x-y pad  for fast,  easy control  of pitch and 
   panorama. Each group can be altered in real time while music is playing or 
   can be by-passed, edited and switched back on when required. The pitch for 
   each group can be shifted by up to +/- two octaves with adjustable formant 
   control retaining  voice quality  even at  extreme settings.  All of those 
   controls are available for  host automation for unsurpassed  dynamic voice 
   manipulations. 
             
   KLON includes a flexible and  adaptive pitch correction to any  given scale 
   or external MIDI notes and chords. Think of playing a chord to  immediately 
   harmonizing your vocal input. 
             
   The  realtime  manipulation  possibilities together  with  the  low latency 
   operation makes KLON the ideal live plugin for vocals.

   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
