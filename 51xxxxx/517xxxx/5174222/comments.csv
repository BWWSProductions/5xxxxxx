You may have noticed that this is v9.0.1 and not v9.0.0. There was another v9.0.1 before this one, but that one contains a .reg file, while this one contains the cracked .dll files (see torrent description):

 VSTi included:

- Hardcore.dll 
- PoiZone.dll 
- Sakura.dll 
- Sawer.dll 
- Toxic Biohazard.dll

... But according to your above post I don't need to say anything. :D"
