                  Image Line FL Studio XXL v9.0.1 (UNION Release)



VSTi included:

- Hardcore.dll 
- PoiZone.dll 
- Sakura.dll 
- Sawer.dll 
- Toxic Biohazard.dll


FL Studio, formerly known as FruityLoops, is a full-featured, open architecture, 
music production environment capable of audio recording, composing, sequencing 
and mixing, for the creation of professional quality music. FL Studio can be used 
as a scratchpad for your ideas or to produce completely mastered tracks ready for 
publication. FL Studio will play any sample, VSTi, DXi or Buzz plugin fed into it 
and also comes with its own generators (softsynths) and effects (filters). 
You'll be creating wav, mp3, midi songs, or loops only minutes after launching it. 

FL Studio is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for Windows PCs (also available 
forIntel Mac/Bootcamp) and is a complete software music production environment, 
representing the culmination of more than 10 years of sustained and focused 
development. FL9 is the fastest way from your brain to your speakers.

FL Studio utilizes MIDI and DirectSound (internal mixing), 16-bit 44KHz stereo 
output, and 32-bit floating-point internal mixing. You'll also get support for 
VST plug-ins, as well as individual panning, volume, pitch, mix, resonance, and 
cutoff on each note.

FL Studio is a full-featured sequencer perfectly suited for creation of complex 
songs and realistic drum loops, with 32 bit internal mixing and advanced MIDI 
support. The resulting song or loop can be exported to a WAV/MP3 file and all 
MIDI events can be exported to a standard MIDI file.

Fruity Loops Studio is a pattern based sequencer meaning you can create your songs 
in pieces (patterns) using the Step Sequencer and the Piano Roll view and then 
weld those pieces together using the Playlist window (the Playlist also supports 
full-feature). Then you can add a wide range of effects to your instruments 
(reverb, phaser, flanger etc.) and route the resulting mixer tracks in any way 
you like to create complex mixing chains with ease.

The FL Studio philosophy is creative freedom. 



Here are some key features of FL Studio:

* Internal 32 bit floating point mixing, up to 96kHz stereo.
* Supports DirectSound and ASIO enabled sound cards for audio output.
* Ability to function as a VSTi, DXi and a ReWire client.
* Ability to host ReWire clients itself.
* Realtime linear interpolation & sophisticated interpolation algorithms at 
  rendering time.
* Open architecture allowing third-party instruments (enhanced proprietary 
  FL instruments standard, VSTi and DXi2) and effects (enhanced proprietary 
  FL effects standard, VST, VST2 and DirectX).
* A full set of high-precision mastering and special effects filters: reverb, 
  compressor, procedural equalizer, distortion, phaser, flanger, bass boost, 
  delay line and other.
* Advanced sequencing methods allowing quick entering of realistic drum loops 
  (step sequencing grid) and composing complex instrumentals (advanced piano roll, 
  arpeggiator, keyboard tracking, real-time gate).
* Unique note properties morphing ability (pitch, cutoff, resonance, panning).
* Advanced mixer: 68 mixer tracks (64 insert and 4 send tracks) supporting up to 
  8 filters each; mixer tracks rerouting for creating of complex mixer chains; 
  track recording with ASIO input support (for recording MIDI, vocals etc.); 
  integrated procedural equalizer, volume and panning for each mixer track.
* Integrated instruments: Sampler, TS404 (the popular bassline engine), 3xOSC 
  (subsynth), Plucked! (plucked strings), MIDI Out, DX10 (FM synth), Scratcher 
  (turntable emulator), WaveTraveller (wave bend synth), Wasp (demo), SimSynth 
  Live (demo), and more.
* Advanced playlist & full-featured audio tracks.
* Live recording of control movements & integrated automation events editor.
* Easy MIDI remote controlling of most parameters (VST plugins supported as well).
* Procedural control over parameters by using special controller plugins.
* Click removal & volume ramping to avoid pops.
* Imports *.WAV, *.SYN (SimSynth 1 & 2), *.DS (DrumSynth) files, with effects 
  applied.
* Imports MIDI sequences and controller events.
* Exports audio to 16Bit or 32Bit *.WAV file, *.MP3.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
