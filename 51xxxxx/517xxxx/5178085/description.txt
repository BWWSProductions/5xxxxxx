  The Wrong Venus is Charles Williams third and last comic novel. Lawrence Colby is recruited by Martine Randall to finish ghost-writing a trashy, romance novel after the original ghost-writer disappears. It turns out that the original ghost writer was kidnapped (the kidnappers mistaking her for the real author), and Lawrence and Martine have to rescue her too. They also have to convince the real author, who doesn't even know that a novel is being ghost-written in her name, to allow its publication.
