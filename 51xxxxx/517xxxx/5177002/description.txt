Review:

If you haven't heard of this band, let me enlighten you: Gogol Bordello are currently the most thrilling, exhilerating and uplifting band on the entire planet, bar NONE. Okay, so they don't have a lot of competition...but their hybrid sound of Punk, Ska, Hip-hop and (most importantly) eastern European "Roma" (i.e. Gypsy) music is so good, you'd honestly be a fool not to at least sample it.

This is by far their best album - superbly recorded in glorious analogue by Steve Albini - and one that actually captures much of the celebratory power of their extraordinary live shows. I won't writemoreâ€¦ any more as, frankly, I don't have the extensive vocabulary necessary to wax lyrical about this truly wonderful band. However, in a just world, they'd be superstars - recognised as ground-breaking, unique, Punk auteurs. As it happens, they'll probably not be fully appreciated until they're long gone, a la The Clash.

Make sure you're one of the few who catches them NOW.
