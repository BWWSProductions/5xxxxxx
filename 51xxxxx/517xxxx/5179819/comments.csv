,jarekboilo,2009-11-29T07:03Z,"This game works fine!

1. Download this torrent.
2. Open the .iso file using Daemon Tools
3. Use Phoenix... scan for the .sid file, then unpack the 2 files inside it at Program Files (create new folder first under program files and name it as Serious Sam HD).
4. Copy crack inside BIN.
5. Play SamHD.exe!!!

My name is Jarek, from the Phlippines! Just trying out this game, will totally delete this game from my computer and purchase a new one!"
