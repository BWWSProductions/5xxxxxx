,ElTaTa,2009-12-03T13:58Z,"Havent downloaded & burned movies in a while so someone bare with me here.   im assuming brrip stands for blue ray rip, so im wondering, is it possible to burn a brrip to a regular dvd and play it on a regular dvd player? probably defeats the purpose of downloading such good quality :P lol but i gotta work with what i got. can anyone suggest the best programs to use to make this all work and get on a cd to play on tv??? please and thank you! :D"
,cuallito,2009-12-06T18:43Z,How do you play this on your computer (Windows XP sp3) I've tried downloading the latest k-lite pack and version of videolan but they won't play it.

,benx77,2009-12-13T23:46Z,why doesn't this play right? it is glitchy and the video keeps freezing while the audio continues. what is wrong? i'm a noob. sry.
,darin_god,2009-12-14T12:23Z,"Okay, first I'd like to say, I was positive this wasn't going to be good quality, and just a waste of time. 

I downloaded it just to realize I it was in mp4 format, and I was originally looking for dvd format. (which is no ones fault but mine, it's in the description)

After being pissed off and waiting 3 hours for it to convert, I came to realize this is the best quality dvd I own.

amazing, if I might say Actual Blue Ray.

And just a little under two gig? (maybe not after conversion.)

You are very skilled, and I thank you.

"
,YoungMac,2009-12-19T14:54Z,Secretmyth your the king. your BRrips are the best on the web. Not to mention you make sure its PS3 compatible. Keep up the good work.
,bsmulligan,2009-12-23T12:22Z,"Sorry, this might be a stupid question. I downloaded it and transferred it to my ps3...it works fine. I don't have the setup for 5.1 and didn't change anything after downloading.

Is it necessary for me to change to 2ch audio? Will this give me better sound quality? I don't see the need if it works fine as it is.

Again, maybe it is a stupid question but I'd appreciate some advice.

Cheers"
,Movieguy26,2009-12-25T18:23Z,PLEASE SEED!
,Royalwitcheeez,2009-12-27T04:00Z,"""I have tested this on the PS3 and Xbox and works fine.""

5.1 doesn't work w/ PS3 or XBOX....
2.0 works only....

Anyone else experience this?"
,jawman,2009-12-27T22:16Z,"download this and you'll never have to worry about videos not playing ever again. it will play 99% of all video files out there:

,halofreak11789,2010-01-13T06:07Z,"firstly i wana thank secretmyth .. you da man .. love your rips .. awesome
can someone please tell me how to watch these mp4s on 360 .. cuz it says file not supported when i play with hdd"
,teja92,2010-01-23T12:41Z,"The best quality for the size.....
Great torrent.
Just completed downloading...
Abit low speed guys.."
,doby1981,2010-01-27T22:39Z,"Exceptional quality! 

V = 10
A = 10

I played this off my PS3 without a hitch, but noticed the sound to be a little uneven (probably because it's 5.1 audio and I don't have a 5.1 system).  I'll try the two channel audio tonight.

Has anyone else noticed this? "
,BurtAlert,2010-03-21T17:14Z,Excellent movie and torrent! Thank you very much secret_myth!
,ultaman1,2010-04-26T23:19Z,AWesome quality! thanks SM! :D
,leracos,2010-07-20T13:49Z,"@benx: Your PC probably isn't fast enough. Try downloading the DVDRip instead.

Otherwise great stuff. The 5.1 audio and 2.0 Dolby Pro Logic II both work excellently on my Insignia's simulated surround speakers.

As for the film, definitely recommend seeing it for anyone reading the comments that is unsure about it. 10/10"
,ittekyri,2011-12-20T02:43Z,"For those who asked about hardcoded subs. The answer is yes, there are hardcoded english subs for the ""prawn"" spoken parts"
