Storyline: In 1990, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed "The Prawns," 
appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp 
where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in 
squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus 
van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 
'Prawn' friends.
