This award-winning drama by noted director Ismael RodrÃ­guez revolves around a festival of mayordomÃ­a in the provinces, or something on the idea of "king for a day." In the annual celebration, the church elects one man as "chief," an honor that is gained by buying it, in effect. Whoever donates the most, gets the coveted title. Celebrated Japanese star Toshiro Mifune plays the lead character, Animas Trujano, a rough peasant who abuses his children and does nothing while his wife supports the family. Animas would like to be "chief" in the annual festival and begins to do everything he can to get the needed money. Meanwhile, Animas' wife is headed for some serious trouble in connection with a local woman of dubious morals that Animas has been seeing.
