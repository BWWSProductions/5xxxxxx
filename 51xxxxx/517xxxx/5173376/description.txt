In Jamaica in 1959, a 21 year-old music fan called Chris Blackwell created a seemingly insignificant music label that over time would become one of the most powerful and influential record companies in the world. Three years after its launch, having established his Island Records as a hit-making enterprise, the young entrepreneur transplanted the operation to London, where he set about releasing the best in authentic West Indian sounds for a growing British fan-base. And while ventures into Rock and Pop later brought his celebrated imprint even greater success, works by an array of talent, from Jimmy Cliff and Lee Scratch Perry to Bob Marley and Sly Robbie, always ensured Islands heartbeat remained Jamaican - a tradition that has continued to the present day.
A 3 cd box set from Island Records spanning their 50 years in the business, cd1 covers from Ska to Rocksteady, cd 2 from early reggae and through the roots years, and cd 3 finishing the early 80`s roots selections and moving right on through to dancehall and the latest sounds of Jamrock. For long timers there might be nothing new but as a showcase of Island and reggae music it sets a standard and shows the strength the music has had over the years.
