Ash Ra Tempel are one of the most notable German Krautrock groups of the 1970s, and are a notable example of cosmic or space rock.
The group was originally founded by guitarist Manuel GÃ¶ttsching, keyboardist/drummer Klaus Schulze, and bassist Hartmut Enke in 1971. All three founding members had previously played together as part of the short-lived group Eruption founded by Conrad Schnitzler. Prior to that Schnitzler and Schulze had worked together in Tangerine Dream.
A short-lived project Manuel GÃ¶ttsching had in 1970 was the Steeple Chase Blues Band, which also included Hartmut Enke, Wolfgang MÃ¼ller, and Volker Zibell.
