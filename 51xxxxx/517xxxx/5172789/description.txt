The Singles Collection is a compilation album by David Bowie, released in 1993 in the UK and (with some changes) as The Singles 1969 to 1993 in the United States. The Australian release had the same track listing as the UK version, but the two discs were released as separate albums, The Singles Collection 1 (with a cover identical to the UK cover) and The Singles Collection 2 (with a cover similar to the UK cover but recoloured green).

Despite the album name, some of the tracks (such as "Ziggy Stardust" and "Oh! You Pretty Things") were never released as singles by Bowie. In both the UK and U.S. versions full-length album tracks are featured instead of the original single edits.

All songs written by David Bowie except where noted.
