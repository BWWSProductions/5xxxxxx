,SpeedChaser,2009-12-01T17:26Z,"Guys why is there different versions like 2010.10 and 2010.20?

Best regards, Alex"
,isalazar,2009-12-03T02:33Z,"Has anybody successfully installed this?
After extracting the .img file i can't open it with PowerISO, UltraISO, or ConeCD.  Is it just me, or is the .zip file corrupt?"
,stambo98,2009-12-04T01:23Z,"Just put the .img file in Garmin folder, don't try to open it !?!"
,snoopyhead101,2009-12-06T06:11Z,"Doesn't work on my Nuvi 760. Created a Garmin folder on my SD card, changed the zip file to 'gmapsupp', and nothing came up."
,snoopyhead101,2009-12-06T07:39Z,"Never mind, this works perfectly on my Nuvi 760. I didn't realize he/she had zipped a zip file."
,isalazar,2009-12-07T08:55Z,"Are there any restrictions on the use of this map set with a registered product?  In other words, if the GPS is registered on the Garmin website, is there any possibility that the GPS can be identified as an unauthorized user of this map and then be tracked?  Are there any other risks that i should know about?

(In case it matters, my unit was not bought with a European map of any sort pre-installed)"
,isalazar,2009-12-08T03:00Z,"Success
(partially)

1. Extracted the .img file

2. Made a ""Garmin"" folder in the micro SD card

3. Copied the .img file into the Garmin folder and rename it ""gmapsupp"".  

Zoomed in to Spain to make sure it worked and got street level detail as expected.

Note: This was done on a nuvi 1300, without ever connecting it to the comp.  I used my comp's built-in card read to access the micro SD card, then put the card into the device.

Still not sure if registering the unit on the Garmin website will render this map useless, or if there are any other risks.  I'll update on this once I've figured it out."

,dkjoe1,2009-12-28T18:09Z,great work easy to install om 760 thanks.
,argo2,2009-12-30T14:59Z,"Works well on a nüvi 350. 

As written do the following:
1. Decopress the file
2. Create a folder ""Garmin"" on the SD Card, copy the file to the SD card to the folder (I did in on my computer, so it was E:/Garmin)
3. Rename the file to gmapsupp.img
4. Start your nüvi, go to System - Map - Mapinfo - Tick ""CN Europe NT 2010.20"", untick the old map, go back to the main menue.
Then the new map is used.

Thanks for posting!!!"

How do i proceed and extract just like norway and sweden?"
,travelix,2010-01-01T22:31Z,works perfect on my nuvi 200. of course you need the SD card because the capacity of the nuvi 200 is only 491 MB and the extracted file is 1.71 GB
,n0badea,2010-01-09T11:46Z,NT or NON NT ?
,bigdogscock,2010-01-27T08:30Z,"Successfully installed this map. Thanks very much! However, I noticed that when I look at maps installed tab on MyGarmin website, it says this map is 2009 version..."
,bigdogscock,2010-01-27T08:33Z,"According to myGarmin, maps are ""City Navigator Europe NT 2009.10, Deluxe All Regions, Jan 09"""
,keddy62,2010-01-31T17:43Z,"Fungerar klockrent på Garmin Streetpilot c550! Såhär gjorde jag:

1) Packa upp .img-filen
2) Döp om från gmapsup2.img till gmapsupp.img
3) Skapa mapp på SD-kortet, döp den till Garmin
4) Kopiera gmapsupp.img till mappen Garmin på SD-kortet
5) Starta GPS:en, gå till Verktyg (har en skiftnyckel som ikon)
6) Välj valet Karta, välj sedan kartinfo
7) I kartinfo, kryssa ur den gamla kartans chekbox. kryssa i checkboxen för Garmin City Navigator Europe 2010.20
8) Gå ur kartinfo, och gå till startsidan. Allt klart. Funkar -som ovan skrivet Klockrent!!"
,keddy62,2010-01-31T17:55Z,"Works perfectly at a Garmin Streetpilot c550! Here´s what I did:

1) Extract the .img-file

4) Copy gmapsupp.img to the Garmin-folder at the SD-card
5) Start the GPS unit, and go to Tools (has a wrench key as icon)
6) Choose Map, and then mapinfo.

,1124,2010-08-28T16:25Z,Are speedcams included?
,14U,2010-12-06T18:49Z,NT version or not ??
,tomber99,2011-08-23T22:30Z,"Have garmin 350 with North American Map. I loaded the 4 GB SD card with the unlocked European IMG file. Garmin recognized the European map,but without the American map checked you cannot enter anything. (Asks for State, does not recognize any letter for State.) With American map checked you can enter American addresses, but not European. 

Possible problems: 1. 4 GB SD card
2. Conflict with North American map.

What should I do?"
