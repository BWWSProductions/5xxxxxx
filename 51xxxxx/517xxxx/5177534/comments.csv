,anuzbitt,2009-11-24T18:53Z,So Is It Working For Anyone ? or just crap :/ 
,petredragos,2009-11-29T08:23Z,We just have to install the 1.5 update then crack it with your thing?
,vykmorod,2009-12-12T23:23Z,"yes this works, patch also includes some sound fix as I noticed.
just run the patch, copy the cracked exe and dll, if you get any errors go to redist (it's included in razor's version, after you extract) , if error is missing DX file install damn directX, and if you see some bad instruction error then install that vc redist package and have fun playing,
and please say if some bugs are still there."
,p0pp3r,2009-12-13T12:42Z,Does it work with any of the razor version? I have the full rip by Kaos that i think will be unpatchable
,essennvbeeh,2009-12-16T03:15Z,does it work with your sister?????? PLEASE LET KNOW. CURIOUZZZ (VERY)
,dodgey99,2009-12-17T20:23Z,"Ok, after a bit or work got it going in Windows 7.

1) D/L Razor 911 release (2x dvd)
2) Install (important! - run in troubleshooting/compatibility mode - XP2 SP2) to wherever, reconfirming the DVD image locations each time it asks. Important - WAIT! when it asks for the DVD location for a good minute or two before clicking ""open"" each time). Copy over cracked exe.
3) Run the 1.5 international update and point it at your game directory MAKING SURE you remove the extra path details it adds - so it points straight in your current game dir.
4) Copy the exe and dll to the root of your game dir.

Works! - now I'm downloading the sound fix as the guns have no sound"
[T],Tanauser,2009-12-17T23:08Z,"I don't understand all this trouble ....
 Every thing is included in the Razors patch update 1.5

,stealthyziko,2010-01-03T18:22Z,"Guys
This torrent worked perfect except for that there is no sound for guns
Is there a sound fix that can fix that ?
I tried the sound fix of v1.0 but it crashed the game, so I put back original sound_sfx file"
,anuzbitt,2010-01-14T16:14Z,hey stealthyziko the sound fix you downloaded is properly bugged.... i wont place a link for ya since i cant remember what fix i used.... but try and experiment with a few of the sound fixes and it will work.... hope it helps abit :)

,Ag3nt_Magnum,2010-02-18T08:45Z,"quick question: is this an incremental patch (meaning the previous one, guessing 1.4, is required), or can it just be installed on the 1.0 version ?"
,johnrivers,2010-02-21T23:19Z,does anyone have patch 3
,seblos,2010-02-26T22:32Z,"Fick ett error:

But since i followed your instructions it worked very well. Thanks once again :D"
,Alzitar,2010-03-06T01:49Z,"Dear pirates, yar!

Ive noticed some people have alot of trouble with the installation.. I myself was quite worried when I saw all the different files and comments. However I've installed the game in 1 try and no problem with anything so far (been playing for about 5 hours now). Ive actually created this little account to explain in few simple steps so everyone can enjoy!

Step 1 
Download:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4750077/Empire_Total_War_Special_Forces_Edition-Razor1911.iso

Step 2
Download:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5117949/Empire_Total_War_v1.5_Update_RazorDOX

Comment: Let me be clear; you absolutly dont need anything else then these 2 downloads! no hotfixes, no bugfixes no other vague rars.. nothing! These files together will give you a working version of the game ver 1.5!

Step 3
Load the iso's with Daemon tools (or any other image mounting software). Note however that the instalastion will ask you a few times to locate the mounted disk, do this every time and it will continue installing. After a while it will obviously ask for disk 2, if so mount disk 2 with deamon tools and again locate it when the installer ask for it.

Step 4
This is the one most people seem to forget.
On the first iso (empire_disc1) there is a folder named razor1911. Copy the content of this folder to your install path.
To clerify: copy not the folder razor1911 but all the folders and files inside it to the folder where you installed empire total war (example: c:\Empite Total war).
You will be prompted if you want to overwrite the files, press ""yes to all"".

Step 5
Now open the update folder (from the second torrent I stated here) and copy the rzr-etw8.exe file to your empire total war installation folder. Then execute it. It will now start to update your empire total war files.

Step 6
Now that you have updated, run the file install.redist.cmd this file will be in your installation folder.

Step 7
Final step! Now put the Empire.exe file from the update in the installation folder and overwrite the existing one.
(you can find this exe file in the second torrent I linked)

Step 8
Thank all the uploaders and creaters of this upload

Cheers! & Enjoy :)

Side note: I installed on a clean install of windows xp pro SP3, so if this isnt working for you and you really want to play.. get a fresh install of wxp sp3 :P

,pilijev,2010-03-13T19:15Z,"Ok, i downloaded Empire Total War Special Forces Edition Razor1911 iso, and after installation it works (and it is working now after 3rd installation). But when i install 1.5 patch and copy .exe and .dll files game starts and after 2sec crash (without any message). It is the same problem with razors 1.5 patch. Any suggestion what may it be?"

,gundalf_gorky,2010-05-01T05:32Z,"Works on the 1st try! I've played all campaign in the road to independence and just finished the long campaign as british. Thank you!

,kifosis,2010-08-31T07:38Z,"Anyone who says this does not work is very very wrong.  This is THE best 1.5 patch for the RAZOR1911 version.  As a matter of fact, I tried all of Razors updates and none of them worked.  I had sound problems and crash problems, etc.  I installed this one and it works PERFECTLY.  THANKS Anuzbitt!  I specifically joined this site just so I could comment on how good this patch was, that's how good it is!"

,jimuk87,2011-04-05T17:21Z,"i installed the goty edition then installed this patch and am using this exe file. the file crashes on native american troops or towns if you try to fight the battle on the map. can anyone suggest a different exe file that might work. 

other than that this patch and crack works fine if youve got the right version installed. try backing up your exes to avoid ""fucking your game up"""
