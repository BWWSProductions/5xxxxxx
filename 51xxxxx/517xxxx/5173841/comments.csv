,dmcw12,2012-02-19T02:26Z,"Why the fuck would you ""fix"" ""the inclusion of Hang On To Your Ego""?

I happen to like that version better than I Know There's an Answer, in part because it is the original version and it's sung by Brian.

It's all right, I guess, if you want to fix various song irregularities. But who the hell just deletes a song from an album before uploading?

Anyway, thanks for the upload."
