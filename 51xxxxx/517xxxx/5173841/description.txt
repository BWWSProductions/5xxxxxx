Here is Steve Hoffman's 2009 remastering of The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Sourced from a first-generation tape. Also available in MP3.

This is by far the best sounding version of Pet Sounds as of today.

I fixed three oddities :

1. The tape dropout at the beginning of "I'm Waiting For The Day";
2. the unusually long gap beetween side A and side B;
3. the inclusion of "Hang On To Your Ego"; which I always felt was out of place.
