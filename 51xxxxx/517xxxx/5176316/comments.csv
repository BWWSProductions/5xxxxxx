,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2010-02-11T20:38Z,"how come there is that small problem with the subtitles, like why do they come in english, did u have to manually select which you wanted and which you didn't.

also is it just me or did the vampire subtitles weren't in sync with what they were saying?

other then that great picture quality and sound. props!"
