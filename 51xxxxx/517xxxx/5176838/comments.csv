I'll tell you why I didn't put the files in reading order:

1. Because I included a reading order list.
2. If someone rescans a comic and produces a better scan it's easier to replace the existing file and re-upload the torrent at a future date.

Now ?reason No.2? may not be applicable with this pack, but it is when you compile a character orientated pack, such as my Nova, Dr. Fate, Werewolf by Night, etc. torrents.  This is especially the case if someone scans a previously unscanned comic.  I don?t want to have to go through and rename several hundred files, so I don?t put any of my packs in reading order, but I do include a reading order lists.  

So if anyone's the ""lazy wanker"" it's you if you can't be bothered to open/close your digital comic?s viewer on the appropriate file and instead waste your time making insulting posts to people who actually take the time to put together packs and upload them. 

You might want to actually think before you make a post next time.  That way, you won?t look like an idiot."

I just want to say thanks for the torrent, like any normal leecher suppose to do ;)"
[T],brodahisou,2009-11-25T17:04Z,Thanks dikkeman1900.  I appreciate your comments.
,blu0xi,2009-11-26T01:12Z,Thanks for seeding the storyline.. it is one of my favorite dc events. I sold all of the tpbs a while ago but now I kinda wish I didn't. xD
[T],brodahisou,2009-11-26T09:49Z,"*sigh* You really can't help yourself can you SUPERNOVAE1976.

The reading order that is included in this torrent is taken from the back page of World's Finest: Our Worlds at War 01.  Now I would hope that DC Comics would know what order their own storyline should be read in.  :)"
