They took Hollywood by storm -- escaping the brutal Soviet oppression of the Hungarian Revolution and rising to fame with classic films like Easy Rider, Deliverance, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Deer Hunter. Cinematographers Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond pioneered the "American New Wave," defining innovative ways to tell stories. This film is a portrait of the 50- year journey of two giants of modern image making and their deep bond of brotherhood that transcended every imaginable boundary.
