,Dufflepod,2009-11-25T01:41Z,"Adobe have released plenty of updates to Acrobat   reader to combat deliberately malformed PDF files carrying a virus.

Mr010101 should try and have at least a vague idea of what he or she is talking about before spouting such garbage."
,tripper511,2009-12-12T03:52Z,"The file is fine, frontpage is just a retard."
,dizzylove,2009-12-30T03:13Z,"tripper is right... there is not a virus... i took the ""risk"" and downloaded it and there was no messages that came up saying there was a virus or malware or anything of that matter."
,rasmusew,2010-02-14T18:32Z,"thank you, no virus here."
,highlander777,2010-07-30T15:35Z,"There is no virus in the PDF file. However, there seems to be missing text in the file. Sentences start but don't finish on the next line. This seems to happen mostly on the page breaks. It's really annoying."
