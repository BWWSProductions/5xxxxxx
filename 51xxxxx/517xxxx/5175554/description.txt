"I Can Transform Ya" is the first single of Chris Brown's upcoming third album Graffiti. The song features Lil Wayne and Swizz Beatz, who also produced the song. The song makes heavy references to the Transformers line of robot-like toys, which is likely inspired by the box office success of the live-action films Transformers and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.

After streaming the song for the first time to the public, Brown then announced on September 29,2009 that a music video for the single had already been shot. The music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Brown on the "Forever" and "Drop It Low" music videos. The video officially premiered to the public on October 27 at 6am on MTV and has since been added to Brown's officialchannel and has over one million views. The music video contains cameos from artists such as Lil' Wayne and Swizz Beatz and also contains cameos from the dance group R3jectz and Transformers star Tyrese. The concept of the video is based on that of the Transformers films in which Brown and his fellow artists transform into cars, motorbikes and helicopters. The music video begins with Chris Brown spray painting the name of the single onto the screen while also indirectly referencing his forthcoming album Graffiti. The music video reached the summit of the US Itunes Music Video Chart November 4 2009. The music video also debuted on BET's 106 and Park on November 11, 2009 and entered the countdown at number 7 November 13, 2009.
