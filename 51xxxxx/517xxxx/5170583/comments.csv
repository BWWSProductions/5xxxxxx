U must have an jailbroken iPhone, install with cydia (an open source) appsync (http://cydia.hackulo.us), it's illegal but let you sync the ""unknown"" apps to your iPhone.

google is your best friend!"
,nix1016,2009-12-02T18:32Z,Does anyone know if the TomTom car kit will work with this? Like will it recognise that the app is installed?
,apkungen,2009-12-29T11:57Z,"Quick guide:

1. Jailbreak ur phone using blackra1n (google it)
2. Install cyndia on ur phone.
