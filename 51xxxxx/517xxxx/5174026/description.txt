The debut Motopony record from 2009. 320K Rip.

From their Myspace:

The sleek-folk genre benders calling themselves motopony began making music in 2007 when front-pony Daniel Blue was possessed by an unknown force that demanded he find audible methods to occur her manifestation. With a sudden lung full of Holiday and a mouth full of Cash, Blue began grasping desperately at whatever music making device was in range. A broken three stringed guitar became the launch pad for their first album.

For fans of Neil Young, Radiohead, Broken Social Scene, Wilco, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Iron and Wine, and Bright Eyes
