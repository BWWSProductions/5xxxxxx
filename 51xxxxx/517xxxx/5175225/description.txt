This is an MP3 audio track and an MP2 video file at DVD resolution of NIN "Closer" mashup with 50 Cent "In Da Club." 
The video source material was VHS so it doesn't look incredible but the whole thing has a distressed film look anyway so... yeah.
I should say that I am not the original author of the audio mashup. I really don't know who did it. I found it on Soulseek by chance some years ago. 
I added in and ending myself because any copy of it I could ever find seemed to cut out suddenly at the end. And then I decided to make a vid for myself to use when I VJ and that is here too. 
Hope you enjoy it!
