,bishal,2009-11-20T10:54Z,"Can anybody tell me How the Quality is??

@Thesyfer is it really DVD rip to download???"
,TheSyfer,2009-11-20T11:00Z,"never said it was a dvdrip but its the quality of one.
id say the
a/9
v/9"
,TheSyfer,2009-11-20T11:23Z,"is it in the description of the file? i don't see it there?

a tag is just a tag, to try and get as many views as possible...

if you look on my tags of before i self destruct, i have a tag for xbox... dont mean its a xbox does it?

in tags you use the most popular key words to bring your file up in as many searchs as possible."
[V],neon,2009-11-20T12:04Z,"by putting dvd rip in your tags when it's not is misleading dude,you havnt even said if its a ts..screener...r5"
,bishal,2009-11-20T12:11Z,"@TheSyfer  Your Tag gives us manything buddy!!Everybody get confused!! Increasing downloaders of your torrent is not great buddy,but giving Quality is the great uploader..just keep one thing on mind ITS THE SHARING WORLD not selling world by cheating!! If u say u are attracting people by tagging DVD rip,then its totally cheating the users!!!"
,TheSyfer,2009-11-20T13:40Z,"its a r5 file, same quality as a dvdrip... not really cheating anyone.

if you dont like how i tag my torrents, report me to TPB or something just dont complain to me about it.

the comment system is meant to be for telling people the quality or the torrent.
not for bitching.
so please keep comments to that subject only."
,chisinaumoldova,2009-11-20T15:14Z,"The comments system is exactly that,for comments,so please do not try and tell me or anyone else what we can or can not say in our comments.Thank you."
,TheSyfer,2009-11-20T21:47Z,"trying to make it big on tpb?
i just uploaded a new random torrents...
im not 'trying to make it big'
& for seeing how it is ment to be done...
these are my 1st torrents.... cant expect fucking everything."
,TheSyfer,2009-11-20T21:55Z,"@chisinaumoldova 
if you hold the right to put whatever you like in your comments
then i do believe i hold the right to put my torrents up under a name i like and tag it whatever i like
its not in violation on tpb CoC as long as the film is in fact what i name it.
This film is Jennifers Body therefor im not in violation of the CoC
you have the right to say what you want
i have the right to do what i want within the CoC

you dont need to download the fucking torrent if you dont want to

i just put these up as a 1st time uploader
why dont you help a newbie out in point out where im going wrong and what i should actually be doing instead of acting a jerk about it

dont like what the torrent description says & dont like the tags

DONT DOWNLOAD IT!"
,swashbukkle,2009-11-21T21:43Z,"QUIT MOANING.
Thanks for the up.
Christ, you all gonna stop people uploading to this site. CHILL OUT and enjoy whats given to us, for free.
AND... Dumb0 - you are a cretin. go and die somewhere."
,bishal,2009-11-22T11:02Z,"Enough the fight guys!! 

@TheSyfer Thanks for the upload.You have shared what you have.Thats great and good job!!I salute for that.Look the number of leechers,many are downloading too.But only what matters is THE TAG!!
Pls know that TAG makes us confuse..really in discription you have not told that its DVD RIP..But neither you have told it is NOT DVD RIP!! You have tagged DVD Rip  and don't say that it is not DVD Rip on description ,that what should we understand!!! Lets take example that I have uploaded one software say AVG and I tag it KASPERSKY and in name and description I say "" GOOD ANTIVIRUS! "" then what do you think it to be?? Can i say then I haven't told it as Kaspersky.its the tag..whateva may it...

anyway I again Thank you for sharing the file what you have!! At least you post the torrent and don't leach like me!!(But I am gr8 seeder)...our complaints is just on your TAG!! which mislead many users like us!We have neva complained about your torrent..no need go more for @chisinaumoldova "
,BTracy,2009-12-16T20:33Z,"@all hey maybe sometime soon someone can dl the fucking thing and see if its fake or not. then, comments on this post will actually mean something."
