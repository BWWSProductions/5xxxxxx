Controller Input Fix (LumiNoGP.exe):

On some systems the game is unplayable; the menu scrolls up or down by itself and the blocks are stuck to the side of the screen. I've modified the exe so it runs without Gamepad support, this (hopefully temporary) fixes the problem until they figure it out.


If you want to backup your Save Game, you can find it in the following directories:

* Windows XP: "%AllUsersProfile%\Application Data\Valve\Lumines"
* Vista & Windows 7: "%ProgramData%\Valve\Lumines"


Install: Extract & Play
