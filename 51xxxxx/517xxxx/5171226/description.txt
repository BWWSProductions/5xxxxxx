This is the 85th edition of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.... I cleaned some spam out of it, but it still has clicky spam that I don't know how to get rid of.. its good, and safe to use, just might be annoying if you use the magic combo: Adobe Acrobat, Internet Explorer, and Windows.  Do yourself a favour and use real software and OSes!  :) 

j/k.  awesome book, please seed as my ISP severely throttles my uploads.

better yet, fix the clicky spam thing and post it yourself!
