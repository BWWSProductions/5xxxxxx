Paramore came into the Live Lounge and performed their new single Ignorance and a cover of Kings of Leon's Use Somebody.

They spoke about how Ignorance is the song that saved the band and their relationships, after 'personal problems' led to their tour being cancelled last year.Hayley said writing it was the theraputic process they all needed to focus on what they want from Paramore.

On a lighter note, since being in the UK Josh and Taylor have discovered they love Shepherd's Pie and Sunday Roasts! Taylor said his celebrity date would be Whoopi Goldberg, while Hayley would like to go on a date with David Hasslehoff (maybe we can get Scott Mills to set them up).
