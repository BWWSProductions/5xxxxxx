You are adding way too many trackers (20+) to your torrents. Please select a handful (maybe five) of reliable ones, and keep to them.

When you put in this many trackers, most clients try to connect to all of them, and this hinders performance, as the peers are distributed on so many trackers (not a single one knows them all), and each peer has to make dozens of announces or scrapes just to keep up-to-date with them."

I will give you five ;-))"
,weisguy,2009-11-26T12:57Z,I just want to reiterate that you have excellent taste and I really appreciate all your work.
,stonynylon,2009-11-27T08:26Z,"With fewer trackers, you should now see torrents that are seeded longer :)"
