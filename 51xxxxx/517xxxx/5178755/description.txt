It has been confirmed that ALL profiles created by encode-handheld.pl are Apple TV compliant.  So any material published by HR are direct play on Apple TV.  Even the PSP 720x480.  If you want a cheap nice unit, by a used Apple TV off Ebay.  They are around $125 used.  Might be able to find a new 40gb unit for $170 at retail shops.
