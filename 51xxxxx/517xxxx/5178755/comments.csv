,srr37,2009-12-25T09:57Z,"1. Download VLC player.

2. Go to the streaming/exporting wizard.

3. Choose transcode/Save to file.

4. Choose your input stream.

5. Put the video codec on ?MPEG-4 Video? and choose your bitrate (I recommend 512)

6. Put the audio codec on ?MPEG-4 Audio? and choose your bitrate (I recommend 128)

7. Put the encapsulation format on MPEG 4 / MP4

8. Choose the name and location you want to save the file.

9. Click on finish, that?s all!

Now you can put your movies or series in iTunes and sync it with your iPhone. If you want to convert a DVD to your iPhone or any other device I suggest you use Handbrake."
