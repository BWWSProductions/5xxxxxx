Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire for OSX! Just unzip SMAC Installed.zip, mount the Alien Crossfire disk image, and double-click SMACX Carbon. This was made and tested on an Intel Mac running Snow Leopard, so it ought to work for just about anyone.

Includes SMAC and SMACX disk images, the installed versions of these files so you don't have to run an OS9 installer, and the SMAC Carbon patch so you can run it under OSX. Enjoy!
