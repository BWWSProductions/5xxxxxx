,mrbman,2009-11-20T17:09Z,"Hey, first of all, thank you very much for the upload!!
Unfortunately, I can't seem to install it!! Could you maybe explain a little bit?

I'm on Snow Leopard. I have the files downloaded, I have the images mounted, and I unzipped the archive. When I double click the SMACX Carbon, it opens it with Photoshop.

What am I doing wrong?"
,grayninja,2009-11-20T17:50Z,"Well make sure that SMACX Carbon is in the same folder as the Alien Crossfire app first. If it's opening with photoshop, try adding the "".app"" extension to the file name."
,yakeel,2009-11-20T21:56Z,"same problem... i added .app and made sure it was in the SMAC Installed folder, but now i'm getting the classic message when i try and run the carbon files (can't open since classic mode no longer supported)"
,yakeel,2009-11-21T01:35Z,"my fix:

1:
unzip the installed files ninja so helpfully supplied

2: go to http://www.brad-oliver.com:8081/%7Eboliver/blog/archives/000299.html and download the SMAC carbon files (ignore the ones in ninja's torrent - they seem to be where the problem lies)

3: drag the contents of brad's patch into the SMAC - Installed folder (select ""yes"" if it prompts for overwrite)

4: mount SMACX disk image supplied by ninja

5: run SMACX carbon from your SMAC - Installed folder

this works for me now on leopard"
,grayninja,2009-11-21T07:29Z,"Hm, I probably should have zipped up the Carbon files. Sounds like they got corrupted somehow. Glad you got it to work :)"
,crazyed206,2009-11-25T10:59Z,"Hi,
Is this supported on an Intel iMac running 10.5.6 or does it need Classic? Thanks!"
,grayninja,2009-11-25T23:34Z,"Yes, if you use the Carbon patch. Just follow yakeel's directions."
,crazyed206,2009-11-29T11:14Z,Got everything working... any tips on not losing my game every time a cinematic comes up?
,grayninja,2009-12-01T09:07Z,"Try disabling Secret Project movies in preferences. Those crashes have been a real bugger for me too, especially as they only seem to happen about 50% of the time. I just try to remember to save the turn before my Secret Projects are completed."
,Alcyon2k4,2009-12-09T07:45Z,with yakeel's help i got it all installed and it launches fine but it crashes right after the Firaxis logo. tips?
,spaceElevator,2009-12-12T08:03Z,"GrayNinja im posting about the black and white 2 thread. I got the no cd crack to work and the game will load up, but when i try to start the first campaign it crashes any ideas. Help please!"
,drbyrd,2009-12-31T07:12Z,"WHOA....
I actually have HERE in my hot little hands the REAL copies (with jewel cases) of Alpha Centuri, Alien Crossfire, Starcraft and Brood Wars. I happened to come across this torrent and was thrilled that I could run these games (AC & ACX at least) on my spiffy new iMac. After downloading grayninja's torrent I tried running by double clicking on SMACX Carbon as per the instructions. zzzttttt opens up TextEdit. No luck! Change (add) the extension to .app, Classic Environment not supported. OK, hit Brad Oliver link (who by the way lives maybe 25 miles from me, no I've never met him) and where O where are the files. Searched the whole blog and nada.........
help????????
what in the wide world of sports is a goin on here........"
,grayninja,2010-01-12T19:24Z,There's a link sort of hidden in the top post of the blog: http://www.brad-oliver.com:8081/~boliver/SMAC_Carbon_b3.sit
,RomanSPQR,2010-02-26T05:50Z,"works on snow leopard 10.6.0 on a hackintosh.  only glitch is a crash issue after watching intro videos, easy enough to bypass by pressing esc or clicking to avoid the videos.

excellent strategy game. i expect to lose some hours of my time over this!"
,RomanSPQR,2010-02-27T03:25Z,"crash to desktop also occurs after watching Secret Project Videos, remember to click before they end otherwise the game will crash."
,phosphos,2010-03-05T09:48Z,"hold on, I've done what yakeel suggested but the new carbon file fails to work much like the other ones did (a bunch of characters shows up.) 
I tried changing it from .sit to .app only to get the ""classic not supported"" message"
,grayninja,2010-04-08T00:21Z,Do I have to spoon feed you info on unstuffing a .sit? Really? What is this world coming to? Get Stuff-it Expander and expand the shit out of that thing.
,maxmadu,2010-04-18T05:52Z,"Ninja and yakeel, thanks for the tips, managed to install everything successfully. I can run SMACX now, but when I try to run SMAC, I get a ""low on memory"" warning and the program quits. Also I don't know how to run it in fullscreen. Any tips?"
,agrp_xtb,2010-04-19T17:14Z,please seed!
,ReturnoftheRat,2010-05-13T18:23Z,"Seems to be running great. One problem though; the mouse pointer won't move. I can use the mouse, but I don't know what I'm pointing at. How can I fix that? "
,Kaakkuri,2010-05-23T09:41Z,"Im having the invisible mouse cursor problem as well. Any tips how to make it visible, run the program in window or download a 3rd party program which draws the mouse cursor again?"
,askthe8ball,2011-03-05T11:11Z,Works like a charm in 10.6.6. Thank you.
,xcausticx,2011-07-23T05:07Z,Love this game! Thanks! Please seed.
,k42,2011-08-04T22:28Z,"Ah, this game is amazing. If only someone would seed..."
,demiurge7,2011-08-08T12:05Z,I have recently upgraded to Lion and the Brad Oliver files does not work. I receive the message that classic is no longer supported and thats about it. Any ideas on how to fix it?
