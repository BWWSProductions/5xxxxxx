             What is PDF/A?                                                   
             PDF/A is the name for the set of standards covered               
             by ISO 19005. The goal is to provide a storage                   
             format for electronic data that will guarantee                   
             reliable reproduction at any point in its lifetime.              
             It is a multi-part standard with several levels of               
             compliance which enables users to choose the set of              
             requirements that fit their usage.                               
                                                                              
             Businesses, governments, libraries, archives and                 
             other institutions and individuals around the world              
             use PDF to represent considerable bodies of                      
             important information. Much of this information must             
             be kept for substantial lengths of time; some must               
             be kept permanently. The future use of, and access               
             to, these objects depends upon maintaining their                 
             visual appearance as well as their higher-order                  
             properties.                                                      
                                                                              
             It is important to note that while these standards               
             ensure the reliable storage and visual reproduction              
             of the data, they make no statement about the                    
             quality of the data contained in the files. Because              
             such issues as raster data resolution, printing                  
             conditions, annotation requirements, number of pages             
             per file, allowed font types, presence of OCR/hidden             
             text, etc. are largely market specific, they are not             
             specified in these standards. Rather, they are felt              
             to be the province of trade associations and/or                  
             organizations who have already begun to publish such             
             specifications for these parameters in support of
