The Guard S03E05 â€“ Lovesick

The station is quarantined after a seriously ill woman is rescued from a boat

This episode aired Nov 20, 2009 on Global.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The broadcast was HD but because of my conversion method, it is not as high quality as scene HD releases so I have labeled it as WS instead of HDTV.
