,steveuk2007,2009-11-28T03:12Z,will you be upping episode 6
[V],err0001,2009-11-28T07:33Z,"I'll upload any new episodes whenever they air. The Guard doesn't seem to have been on tonight and the next episode I can see on Global says Dec 11, 2009, but there is only a generic description at this point, so I don't know if it will be a new ep or a repeat.

If anyone has any info about when the next ""new"" ep is being aired, please let me know. The eps that are missing seem to be ""Out of the Woods"", ""At Sea"" and ""Full Circle"".

I gather all of these eps have been shown on the Mystery channel already, but no one seems to have uploaded them. So from the torrenting viewpoint they are new eps."
,sooners,2009-11-28T17:43Z,Appreciate the info err0001. Thanks for keeping up with this show. You're our only source.
,steveuk2007,2009-11-29T02:48Z,Thanks for the inf err0001 appreciate you upping them
[V],err0001,2009-11-29T05:16Z,Steve Bacic (Miro on the Guard) is in Cra$h & Burn which airs on Showcase Canada at the moment. I have uploaded the first 2 eps that have aired. I'm planning to continue uploading that show.
,sooners,2009-11-29T08:00Z,"Never heard of C&B, but since you're capping it...it must be good. Will go ahead & start downloading it then. Thanks for all of your hard work with these great Canadian shows!"
,sooners,2009-12-12T04:26Z,@ err0001 - is there a new episode of The Guard on tonight?
,Fijs,2009-12-14T22:22Z,thank you !
,sooners,2009-12-29T09:19Z,"Err0001 - Just curious, are you no longer capping this show? I enjoy this show & appreciate your caps. But if you're only gonna cap a few episodes & leave us hanging, then I'm just gonna delete the episodes I do have. There's no point in only watching a couple of episodes & not have any closure. I went ahead & deleted Crash & Burn too. Capping only 2 episodes is kinda pointless. Thanks though. "
[V],err0001,2010-01-11T11:08Z,"I have uploaded S03E06. But unfortunately I haven't been able to do so here yet due to technical problems on this site.

ep 6 is available on btjunkie.com - search for ""Guard s03e06"" (without the quotes) 

The torrent title does not say ""err0001"" (a mistake on my part), but the file is one of mine.

The upload may be slow, since it hasn't got multiple seeders yet. Please help by seeding until this gets going. Thanks.
