The ripper has not masked correctly, so a lot of quality is wasted on the black frame around the picture."
,kepler42,2012-05-26T18:15Z,"Miserable encoding:
 - Wrong Aspect Ratio
 - Huge Black Bars
 - Wired In swedish subtitles.
How long will it take to the Northern encoders (mostly Dutch and swedish) to learn how to use soft subtitles ? ( Srt, sub, etc..)"
