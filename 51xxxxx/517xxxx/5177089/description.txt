   Critical band equalization and compression 
             
   The  multiband  filter  BARK  takes the  approach  to  match  the reception 
   characteristic of  the final  destination of  all sound:  the ear.  The ear 
   behaves  as  if  it  contains  a  bank  of  filters,  each  filter  passing 
   frequencies within the  critical band. Two  tones separated by  more than a 
   critical bandwidth are received by  the ear independently. For this  reason 
   BARK contains a filter bank with 27 bandpass filters matching the  critical 
   bandwidth.  
             
   In fact, the human ear have also its own built in compression system  which 
   are  based  on  the  critical  bands.  Consequently  BARK  incorporates  an 
   independent compression algorithm for each of its 27 bands. 
             
             
   Features:

   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5
   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
