,Masterhunter,2009-11-20T03:42Z,why rar files?
[V],TvTeam,2009-11-20T03:50Z,"Masterhunter, RAR files are scene rules.
Scene RAR files are the fastest and cleanest release you can find on the net.

you just need rarlab to unrar one of the file to get clean avi file.

my releases are clean, you can subscribe to my RSS ;)"

,meisbored,2009-11-20T06:05Z,.rar files are so pointless. It just adds unnecessary inconvenience for everyone involved. But since I haven't seen this on eztv yet I'll grab this one.
