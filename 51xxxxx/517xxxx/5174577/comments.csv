,kklasen,2010-02-11T12:05Z,@ntheg111 : 3.1.3 released. Its on my acc.
[T],FRITZBox,2010-03-01T18:20Z,No not upgrade to 3.1.3 for jailbreakers!
,Archangeldawn,2010-03-19T21:19Z,"Yes I agree with Jeroenz0r
Do not update to 3.1.3
Your jail broken Ipod will lose it's jailbreak and you won't be able to Jailbreak it. Especially if on a 3rd Generation. "
,paddy0815,2010-04-16T16:36Z,"The only question i have is: Why is it a .exe? Yes, I know it's a SFX archive...but you made it even bigger...
.exe File->249'850'224 bytes
.ipsw File->249'780'497 bytes
I don't get it..."
,crazyfroggy,2011-03-15T00:30Z,i dont understand how to do it
,joaoandrew,2011-08-06T15:20Z,you might want to change the file extension to .ipsw ... it's saved as .exe and itunes won't recognize it so you can restore your iPod.
