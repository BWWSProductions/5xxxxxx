    ***Blur - All the People...Live at Hyde Park - 2009 - 320kbps***


One of the most important and influential bands of the last twenty years, Blur's reunion was the biggest music story of 2009. Along with their acclaimed Glastonbury headline slot, Blur's two dates in London's Hyde Park formed the centrepiece of their brief reunion tour, and the gigs easily lived up to the hype. Two mammoth, career-spanning sets showed that the years of inactivity had not robbed the band of any of their energy, nor their passion for playing together.
