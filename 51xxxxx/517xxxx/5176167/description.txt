Conceptual Improvements/Advancements Of Edit Over Original

What I have tried to do with this FanEdit is to create a film more in keeping with the three previous Romero Dead Films. I have removed money as a motivator and reduced the Zombies reasoning. I have also removed the more obvious special make-up effects and increased the level of gore and carnage. I have also trimmed the more formulaic dialogue and attempts at light humor. There is a new prologue, whole new sequences and a new ending.

I will let you judge if this works or not.
