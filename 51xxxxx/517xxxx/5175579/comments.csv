,iktpq666,2009-12-02T04:43Z,"thanks for the up, great episode. btw, what are some other good anime's to watch?"
,lvicious,2009-12-03T01:42Z,"well mininova went bye bye which sucks so soagg do you mainly upload here or somewhere else as well?

..lol or are you done after what happened on mininova.

ty,

vicious"
,lvicious,2009-12-03T01:49Z,"all that time soagg I dl'd your stuff off mini too and I got a letter about a movie I dl'd even with peerblock running but nothing came of it.

hopefully, that won't happen with your torrents.  alot of anime sites are getting letters again from baytsp like taka fan subs.  so be careful people.

look forward to your next uploads as always.

for episode release dates for both japanese and english go here:

,beatboxpanda,2009-12-03T12:47Z,thanks soagg can't wait for the next episodes
,mseager006,2009-12-12T02:38Z,soagg thanks for all the bleach you are the best. Im having a problem with your episode 140 though. it seems to be the same as 139. Any way you could upload the real episode 140?  thank you so much we appreciate all you do.
,LetsRockit01234,2009-12-17T17:58Z,"what happened soag, you haven't uploaded anything since 11/23/09? Are you still alive man? We need you!!!"
,Madaz13b,2009-12-19T08:44Z,yeh your getting slack mate :P  its been ages
,lvicious,2009-12-23T00:40Z,"well a couple of reasons probably:

1.  Bleach english eps being aired stopped at the end of season 8 back in November.  The next arc to be dubbed should start back up after the new year some time as you can see here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_episodes#Season_8:_Arrancar:_The_Fierce_Fight_.282007.E2.80.932008.29

2.  Soagg was very active on Mininova and they as most know deleted pretty much everyone's content including all of his which was alot.

so I'm sure he was a lil pissed and may have just said f it for good or probably waiting till after the new year to start back up as he had other series ongoing and not just bleach.

If he doesn't put up any new Naruto ship or anything by the end of January then I'd say he quit for good.

If he doesn't come back I'll post up a couple of links to find dub dl's for the same material."
,soagg1,2009-12-23T17:39Z,"Hi Guys,

I think we are all enjoying the holidays. Should be back on TPB. Will find some other sites to upload my torrents henceforth. I know Shippudden dubs are already out. But let us just wait for the new year.

Thanks for all your support the last year and hope that the same will continue further. 

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!"
,seedosi18,2009-12-24T02:53Z,"Nice to hear from u soagg ;)

,Madaz13b,2009-12-24T04:36Z,"Ah good stuff, see you in the new year and have a good one."
,beatboxpanda,2009-12-24T08:11Z,seeya next year soagg
,seedosi18,2010-01-02T20:36Z,"Hey soagg,i noticed Blood+ wasn't on the list for ongoing english dub series, there are 50 episodes and you noly have up to 38.

just thought i'd throw that out there ;)

Thanks,have a good one"
,aln132,2010-01-03T23:40Z,"Heya, thanks sooo much for all the Bleach you have previously uploaded! I'm up to season 7 and 8 now as far as downloading goes but I'm still seeding 1-6 strongly! I have a request though, is there any way you can make a season 7 torrent with all of its episodes together? I dislike downloading individual episodes. Same with 8 maybe at some point? Thanks alot either way for all your contributions! "
,oovi,2010-01-07T23:25Z,"This waiting is going to kill me! :( 

Anybody knows when the next eng dubbed season is going to be aired???"
,seedosi18,2010-01-08T01:16Z,Probably Mid to late This year ;)
,Madaz13b,2010-01-12T15:12Z,"I get the feeling we are all going to need to find a new source... any tips anyone ??
