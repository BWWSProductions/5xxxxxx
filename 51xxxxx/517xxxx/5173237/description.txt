Joni Mitchell - Hejira 1976

The following is an excerpt from:

The trouble she's seen  
Doug Fischer    [Ottawa Citizen]
October 8, 2006


Whenever Joni Mitchell had trouble sorting out her life, she took to the road. But in early 1976,with a turbulent love affair on the rocks and too many drugs in her body, she hit the highway almost with a vengeance.  "I was getting away from a romance, I was getting away from the craziness and I was searching for something to make sense of everything," she says. "The road became a metaphor for my life."
And it inspired the album many of her fans and music critics consider her masterpiece.

Released 30 years ago this week, the nine songs on Hejira form the remarkable personal journal of a nomadic, romantic dreamer whose aural notebook is filled with the stories of doomed love, late night roadhouse dance floors, wedding gown fantasies, lost chances and a deep yearning to escape and start over.

Mitchell is not convinced Hejira is the best of the 22 albums that made her among the most influential singer-songwriters, male or female, of the past 40 years. She won't attach that label to any of her albums.

'Hejira could only have come from me' But she concedes Hejira is probably her one album that could not have been made by anyone else. "I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on Hejira 
could only have come from me," she said an interview with the Citizen.

The stories they tell are so vivid, their observations so naked and the landscapes so haunting that Kris Kristofferson famously urged her in a letter to be "more self-protective ... to save something of yourself from public view."  But Mitchell says self-confession, no matter how risky and revealing, was essential to her writing during that era.  "My songs have always been more autobiographical 
than most people's," she says. "It pushes you toward honesty. I was just returning to normal from the extremities of a very abnormal mindset when I wrote most of the songs (on Hejira).  "When life gets interesting I get very alert, and life was very interesting. I think that took the writing to another level."
