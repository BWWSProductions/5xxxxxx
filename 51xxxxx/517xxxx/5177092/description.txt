   RealIR Reverb Engine 
             
   Version  2.0  of  REFLECT  comes with  a  new  RealIR  Engine using  direct 
   convolution  of the  critical early  reflections without  compromising the 
   flexibility of the algorithmic reverb tail generation. 
             
   The resulting  density and  smoothness rivals  those of  the most expensive 
   hardware reverbs.  
             
             
   Back to the future 
             
   REFLECT  is  an  algorithmic   reverberation  plugin  which  combines   the 
   flexibility  of  vintage  algorithmic reverbs  with  the  sonic quality  of 
   convolution based reverbs. 
             
   The creation  of high  quality reverb  needs a  realistic simulation of the 
   important  early   reflections  together   with  a   smooth  and  colorless 
   reverberation tail. 
             
   The early reflections are the most important clue for the human ear to  get 
   a feeling  about the  dimension and  character of  a room. Most algorithmic 
   reverbs  offer  a  number of  different  algorithms  to simulate  different 
   natural rooms like chamber, halls or artificial ones like plates.   REFLECT 
   uses  impulse  responses from  real  acoustic spaces  and  classical reverb 
   algorithms to emulate their acoustical properties. 
             
   The resulting  reverberation sets  new standards  in clarity  and sense  of 
   space !   
             
             
   Surround  
             
             
   The new version is  a true  surround  reverb  modelling multichannel  early 
   reflections  and  decorrelated  reverb   tails  for  a  realistic   spatial 
   emulation. 
             
   REFLECT  is  now compatible  to  the new  VST3  standard -  the  next major 
   revision of Steinbergs Virtual Studio Technology. The VST3 version  allows 
   for arbitrary input/output channel configurations up to 10.2 Surround. 
             
   Features: 
             
   - True Surround reverb 
     VST3: all configurations up to 12 channels including 5.1 / 7.1 
     AudioUnit: mono/stereo/5.1 => mono/stereo/5.1 
     RTAS: mono/stereo/5.1/7.1 => mono/stereo/5.1/7.1 
             
   - Import of surround impulse responses. 
   - Surround reverb programs.

   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5
   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
