This movie has been giving me lots of trouble.
Everywhere I find one large video file and two small subtitle files.
Okay, you say, simply join the two subtitle files in Subtitle Workshop
and fit the result to the one big video. That's what I normally do.
But,for some reason I couldn't get the second subtitle file to display
on the video after joining them together.
Okay, you say, split the video file in two and fit each subtitle file
to each one of these parts.
Trouble was Virtual Dub could not open the video file so I could split it.
I've run into this before. One has to open it in Virtual Dub Mod and go
through complitated conversion of various things. And it worked.

I thought maybe someone else is stuck on this.
So, here it is in two separate parts which will play one after the other
automatically using KMPlayer just like they should.

Enjoy.
