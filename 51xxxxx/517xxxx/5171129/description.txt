These are only some songs we recently added to our previously released 4 volumes (which had 200 seeders last year) and is now in just one 5.11GB CD+G volume (same songs - no change). Feel free to join the seed of the collection if you downloaded any of this collection before. Merci


In actual fact we also have a 4.04GB and a 4.41GB CD+G collection. If you 
downloaded or are seeding the 4.04, or the 4.41GB torrent you can switch your files into the new folder of the 5.11GB collection and run a "torrent re-check" using your torrent software function for this purpose, and you'll be able to download only what youre missing from the new torrent, which has 25% more songs added to essentially the same collection otherwise. 


We've also included an AVI sample for you in case you want to convert your 
CD+G files although they do give you the best source quality, your equipment
might work better with an XVID or DivX conversion of these files. (The DivX
folder sampler here actually contains an XVID so use DivX converter through
a free download if you prefer from FivX.com) Dank!
