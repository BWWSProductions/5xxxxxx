,polgarem1,2010-11-14T11:01Z,seed please
,Sven the swede,2010-12-07T13:07Z,"Super huge warning!!! The episode order is completely wrong. I understood something was wrong in the third episode when everything was out of chronological order. For example, The Chimes of Big Ben is episode 2 but in this torrent it is episode 5! It is shocking that no one noticed this in over a year. "
