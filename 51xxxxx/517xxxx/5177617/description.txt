I decided to give this series another go since giving up on it in the 1970's.
In the meantime I've grown to need subtitles because of slow-witted old age and a foreign born wife. All the subtitle sites had the same set, and they were no good. It took me quite a few hours to straighten them out. These are the best available and will be appreciated by the Baby Boomers as their hearing fades.

My first impression of it is that the attached IMDb comments go way overboard
on the favorable side. 

I'll see.
