It's a HUGE EBOOK COLLECTION of vampire books. It is basically every ebook I could find online.  It's not perfect, but you have a lot to choose from.

If you have any to suggest, or if I've made a mistake, comment, and I'll get around to fixing it.  Also, I'm going to at least try to keep up on the ongoing series, so I would expect new torrents from me.

Some books probably don't have vampires as the main thing, but if it had vampires at all I've included it. Same thing goes with series, even if one book in the series is focused on vampires, and the others aren't, I've included the whole series because it wouldn't be nice to have the one book, and then have to go searching for the rest.

I've had to .rar them by authors so TPB would accept the torrent.
