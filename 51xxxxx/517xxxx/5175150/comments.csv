,kmack73,2010-02-24T03:35Z,"Hi Keikii,

Great job!!!

I downloaded the torrent, they all came as a .rar file.  Which isn't a big deal because I can convert them but I didn't get all the books.  (I don't think).  For example:  Stephanie Meyer has the 4 books but I only got Twilight.  Do you know if I did something wrong?  Also your guide that is so helpful - I don't see it on the download.  Anyway, if you can help me out that would be great.

Thanks again for doing all of this, I have no idea where you found all the books.

Thanks
K"
