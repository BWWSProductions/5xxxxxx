,fakiest,2009-11-23T20:12Z,can you seed it? there are no seeders at all. I will seed it once its done downloading
,Jalek,2009-11-26T06:41Z,"No seeders because he posted it, along with three other torrents, and left.  None of them have had one piece seeded.

Either a troll or he didn't realize he needed to download the torrent file and point it to the complete file(s) after publishing it."

,cunninglinus,2009-12-18T11:26Z,"Dini931, you need to download the torrent file you created, is what the others were trying to say. After you do that, you ""point"" that torrent towards the video/movie you uploaded.

27 Leechers are waiting now, even at this crazy hour of the morning here! Lets get this started. If u still have problems seeding it, please post the exact steps taken and one of us will get it fixed for ya"
,PiratebayForTheWin,2010-04-29T22:20Z,"Please upload it to meg@upload or something, then it'll be easy to download. You don't know how to seed, so meg@upload/r@pidshare is a good alternative :)

(replace @, with a)"
