Thank you.. :)"

there are over a hundred seeds that i can see.

although i'm not seeding it anymore, it has never
stopped being seeded.

check your firewalls or try restarting the torrent
or your pc if you can't finish the files."
,siskojnash,2009-11-24T03:20Z,I tried restarting the torrent and was able to finish the popcorn and jellybeans episode.  Thank you so much!  Do you happen to have any more of the bonus making of specials from Peanuts shows?
