,trippy123,2009-12-03T05:40Z,"Great rip thanks! 

One thing about the subtitles - is there an option for just the alien subs, or do we have to watch with full English subtitles throughout? Thanks again! :)"

,thedevilslettuce,2009-12-25T11:30Z,i just dont understand how these say blurayrip but they say dvdr too?  im assuming that this is 1080 but not sure
,vivavivap,2009-12-26T20:57Z,"I wonder, does this have custom or retail menu?

And that's what I've wondered too... what does it mean to be both a DVDR and a Bluray rip? Is it basically a Bluray disc converted to a normal DVD format? :/"
,Dirt_McStride,2009-12-27T14:25Z,"Can someone help me understand the file system with Video_ts. It's just parts of the movie, why is video_ts better/more popular than .iso? .iso is for much easier to understand, burn and use... anyone wanna help me?"

Och hur gör jag lättast för att kunna kolla på ett PS3?

Tack på förhand.

Hi I'm new at this so I wonder how I can add and remove subs?

And What's the easiest way to watch on my PS3?

Thanks."

,1177,2010-04-21T13:00Z,"Hi. salio, this movie has apanish subs????"
,pezed,2011-11-02T04:11Z,"Very nice. The audio and video are excellent, with many subs. , but there are no subs for the Prawns. If ever there was a movie that needed hard coded subs it is this one (at least for the aliens). Unless you can speak prawn you might not want to download this. Still very nice Thank You."
