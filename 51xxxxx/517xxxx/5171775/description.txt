In an attempt to piece together the fractured friendship, Eric takes a side trip from his latest book tour to drop in on Dylan, newly settled in the picturesque backwoods of Washington state. An awkward weekend ensues as the two ex-buddies and Dylan?s enigmatic new friend Jim, chop wood, match wits and ultimately embark on an impromptu, booze-soaked cougar hunt.
