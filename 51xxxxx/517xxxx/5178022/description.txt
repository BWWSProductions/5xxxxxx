  In Hell Hath No Fury by Charles Williams, a drifter named Madox wanders into a small town and finds work at a used car lot, but is just biding his time until he can devise the perfect bank robbery by setting diversion fires all over town. But someone's already set a fire for Madox: the used car lot owner's wife. In 1990, Hell was turned into a Dennis Hopper-directed movie called The Hot Spot starring Don Johnson (as Madox), and Virginia Madsen (as the boss's wife, Dolly Harshaw).
