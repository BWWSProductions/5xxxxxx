,barrly,2009-11-25T15:56Z,Isn't anyone seeding this or the others?
,OmaBlue,2009-12-01T12:34Z,I uploaded this bit torrent because I love Martin Shaw and the BBC productions are absolutely fabulous.  I don't understand why I myself am not shown as seeding. I leave azureus on all day.  I've tried downloading myself to seed in that manner but I am stuck at 25%...which is a real shame as I wanted to share these films.  If anyone has any tips how I can also seed please let me know....
