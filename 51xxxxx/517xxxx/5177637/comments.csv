FUCKING SEED YOUR GOD DAMNED TORRENT AND DONT BASE IT OFF OF YOUR MAXIMUM OF 1TB UPLOADED DATA BULL SHIT, I HAVE 8TB OF HDD SPACE JUST CHILLIN IN MY ROOM RIGHT NOW AND I DONT STOP SEEDING...... JUST BECAUSE MAYBE SOME ONLY DOWNLOADED 12.3KB OF DATA BUT ON UR PC IT SAYS 1TB!!!! FUCKING RETARDED.

So please seed your own torrent more than 1TB FUCKING CONSIDERING YOUR RETARDED ASS MUST NOT HAVE NOTICED THE 32.1GiB OF DATA WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DOWNLOAD WITHIN YOUR STUPID 1TB LIMIT, NOT ALOT OF PEOPLE!!!

Thank you!!

due to some failures  with my internet provider my internet has switched off so the seed you are getting right now is from a friend of mine you was so kind enough to seed it. tommorow meaning in 10 hours i am seeding again with the an upload speed of ~300 kbs I am sorry for any problems this has caused i will try to avoid these kind of issues in the future. thx for youre honest opinion on my torrent and the way its been held right now. So again I apolgise for this issue and hope the rest of the download will be free of problems.

It seems no one can get over 76,3%. It would be appreciated if you'd seed abit longer at least until some people are able to seed it completely."
