[T],nelwyn,2009-11-26T20:08Z,"Mininova gave in to a lawsuit that was filed against them about copyrighted material so they removed all torrents and now only people who have original material or own the copyright to it can upload torrents. 

So I don't see Mininova being very useful at all anymore. They said they are going to appeal the court's decision and they might go back to the way it was."
