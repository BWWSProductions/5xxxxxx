Thank you goose!!"
[V],mothergoose56,2009-11-20T18:14Z,"Yea, it's coming. Gonna be weird not upping right after the show everyday. I know it'll be like when you were a kid and would jump out of bed on a Saturday thinking you had school. I'll forever be thinking ""crap, I forgot to put the show up""... every afternoon. 

It's takes a bit of dedication for sure, and I really reap no rewards (the thanks are appreciated) other than the satisfaction of helping people listen to the best radio show around....."
