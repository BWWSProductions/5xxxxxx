,Kirjah,2009-11-26T12:25Z,Please stop adding torrents with trackers of eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org. The trackers moved months ago. I keep having to manually edit the EZtv torrents to work.

,keggs01,2010-02-20T23:55Z,"MAN!!! This is taking its time! It started alright at about 145-210k/bs for 40mins then slowed to 50k/bs. I've just checked its progress and its been crawling along in single digits for the past 3 and a half hours! (arrgh) its just so frustrating. I'am gratefull though and willing to wait. Also i of course will seed when done. THANK YOU ""EZTV"""
