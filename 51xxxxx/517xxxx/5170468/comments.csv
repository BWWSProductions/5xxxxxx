,caboose5216,2010-03-05T00:30Z,"Okay, so I meet the CPU and Memory requirements, but idk about the Graphics. I don't know how to check my graphic memory or sound card. In fullscreen (1600X900 for me) I could NOT play because of the lag. I had to switch it to 640X480 and LOW quality for the lag to go away. Any suggestions on how to solve this problem?"
