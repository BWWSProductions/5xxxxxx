      Extended version of the topical comedy show hosted by
      Russell Howard, who offers his unique perspective on the big
      stories dominating the media across TV, online and in print, as
      well as picking up on those sometimes overlooked things that
      make him smile. Recorded in front of a studio audience, it also
      gives viewers the chance to shape the news agenda by allowing
      them to submit stories online at www.bbc.co.uk/russellhoward or
      via Twitter.
