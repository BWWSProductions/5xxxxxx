'"The Mother of all sequels." - Bruce Campbell

Released November 29th, 1999

Okay, so maybe Bruce was referring to Evil Dead 2. I'm sure if he knew that this musicdisk existed, he'd say the same thing. Stage 9 is a musicdisk that came out in January 1998. It featured 15 modules from various artists in the PC music scene. It was a pretty big success within the scene. However, few people outside the scene ever got to hear it. This sequel hopes to change all that.

The facts about Return to Stage 9:

It features 62 songs from 37 artists.

These 62 songs = 4 hours, 58 minutes and 47 seconds.

Compiling this project took over 1.5 years.

It is the biggest musicdisk ever assembled.'
