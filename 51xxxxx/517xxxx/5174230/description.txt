OK Folks...here you go...after doin the torrents for the first 2 singles off this FREAKIN AWESOME cd, I picked up the CD yesterday and ripped it 2nite, then scanned all covers, inserts etc to make it a full package.

I see someone else beat me to the CD rip...good on ya roccor...at 320Kbps no less too!  Well mine is only at 256 but honestly I don't hear the diff...and mine includes covers! nyah nyah nyah....  :-))))

Anyway it's all good...more choice for Hedley fans!

ENJOY!
