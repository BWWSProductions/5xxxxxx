,toyboof,2010-01-04T20:26Z,"When I was watching this, the movie was very choppy.. any reason why? I'm using VLC player"
,maggot11,2010-01-05T05:23Z,@Toyboy to watch a full 1080 video you need to have a fairly decent processor unless you have hardware decoding and good codecs usually help look for core avc on tpb its what i used to use before i had windows 7
,maggot11,2010-01-05T05:25Z,Sry last post was meant to be @ toyboof

,gomisensei,2010-01-11T12:57Z,"@weesonha fat32 filesystems won't let you have any file bigger than 2 GB, you'll need to convert to ntfs or possibly, FatX (if vista/windows7)"
,weesonha,2010-01-11T15:34Z,gomisensei... cheers. am running Vista. how do I go about fixing this?
,bridog80,2010-01-14T22:05Z,"@weesonha: Hi. Your gonna have to save your pictures, documents, etc... to another drive. Then reformat. My suggestion is (since your here), get a copy of Win7 Ultimate Activated. (Much faster!) Burn it, and do a clean install. When you start from the DVD of Win7, you will come to [Which type of installation do you want?] You want custom (advanced). Then delete the all the partitions you see. WARNING! If you have more than 1 hard drive, make sure you don't delete the wrong 1 (I've done that). See this pic if your confused: http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m80/WickedSpace/windows-7-clean-install.jpg
At this point, DON'T FORMAT. Just click next. Win7 will do the partitioning. If you want a more details & pictures, take a look here: http://www.rhavinsgate.com/index.php/how-to/windows-7-clean-install/"
,Tetsuo87,2010-01-15T11:28Z,"Hope someone can help me, I've downloaded and it plays great but when I try to transfer it my external hdd or even my thumb drive it says that there's not enough space for it, when there really is enough. is there something I have to do first?"
,weesonha,2010-01-15T17:29Z,@bridog80 : cheers for the help ;) im happy with Vista for now. all my dwnlds go to my external harddrive. any other methods than installing windows 7?
,TobiSaru,2010-01-16T08:25Z,"@weesonha, if you're still having trouble with this and don't want to reinstall your whole OS, you can just pick up a fairly cheap external drive and just store all your files that are over 4GB onto it, or just reformat your current external to NTFS if it isn't already. You can check to see what the file system is by going to your start menu, right click my computer, click Manage, go down to storage and select disk management, if you need any help just pm me or something"
,weesonha,2010-01-16T17:24Z,@TobiSaru : cheers bud! wasnt really up to attempting installing windows7. your method is far easier :p all my files wont be lost when I re format my drive?
,TobiSaru,2010-01-16T23:49Z,"no, they will be lost if you reformat the drive, all i can think of is save all the files on your external either to a friends drive or to a bunch of dvd's (i would suggest compressing the files before doing that to make it easier)"
,weesonha,2010-01-17T07:39Z,thanks for the help... problem solved!

,hanqin81,2010-02-05T10:57Z,Hey its downloading really slowly. There are far more leechers than seeders. Just what the hell are leechers?
,superman101,2010-02-06T03:55Z,"Audio: 10
Video: 10

A good high-res rip. A decent computer will be needed to run a 1080p rip (dual-core+high-end video card preferred).

The ratio to seeders and leechers is important but isn't the ultimate deciding factor in speed. I'm no expert but I know it depends on your local settings as well. Plus, it's the frickin' Internet; we're using protocols that were instituted in the 70s. It's amazing the Internet even works. 

My advice? Quit bitching if it's slow, you're getting a movie for little to zero cost. Don't wanna wait? Then cancel the download and buy the movie. Save the comment section for legit problems."
,cat_fish_1,2010-02-08T10:48Z,"@ superman101

do you even know what you are talking about?

you kan run 1080p on a netbook.

,TheTorrentHero123,2011-01-13T07:41Z,Can everyone please seed when their done?? Im on %98.9 and I have been trying to download this for over 2 weeks now...I know Wow right? Now with so little to go Im only getting average of 14.5kb/s per second. And for the people who are just coming in to TRY to download... Dont. There is just no use trying until we get more seeders. When Im finished downloading I will seed for 1 week just like I do every download.
,TheTorrentHero123,2011-01-15T00:38Z,"Can someone please tell me how I can get this to my PS3? Since the PS3 does not read MKV files, I used mkv2vob to change the file extension to a PS3 readable format. But now its total size is WAY over the FAT32 4gb size.WHAT DO I DO? I have tried using a media server but within a minute or so the media server program on my computer crashes. I think its just because of the large file size that its trying to move, the program just cant handle it. If anyone has been attempting the same thing and finally thinks they have a resolution then please share it. Also if you are doing this with a PS3 what format did you make the movie first. I used .MP4 and MPEG-2 for my file but I have no way to get it to the system. Also one last thing, is there any copy protection on this movie in the file itself? Because even the ones that I have tried that should have worked, didn't. I called sony and they say that the PS3 can recognize if a Movie file is copy protected and will not even show you that there is a file there at all. What I want to know is...Is the movie that I downloaded a copy of the Bluray? or is it just a DIGITAL COPY as shown in the picture? If its a digital copy Im pretty sure its going to have some kind of copy protection just so you couldn't hand it out..Like my Dark Night bluray. W/E Im getting pretty tired of even trying anymore."
,CrossVXM,2011-03-04T02:08Z,I'm being such a sweetheart and leaving it behind to seed to the fellow downloaders since it was indeed slow for me.
,CrossVXM,2011-03-04T03:28Z,"Thats sad. Seeds went up to 66 and has now reached 51. But the movie's quality is beautiful (at least for me, even though my HP isn't HD) so its well worth a wait for those who missed the movie. Nice job to cgaurav007!"
