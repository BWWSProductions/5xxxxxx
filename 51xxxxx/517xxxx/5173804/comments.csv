,JPeterson,2009-11-22T00:06Z,Why do you need both keys? Aren't HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID interchangeable with HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID?
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-11-22T03:30Z,"the reg file did allow me to play the game for about 10 minutes but it crashed to desktop although i believe that because of the game bugs. But the game works now so thanks a bunch dude for uploading this!

Although whenever i choose my character it picks a different one for some reason but thats probably just another bug in the game."

,raviraj87,2009-12-12T06:16Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). I have ""Left 4 Dead 2 - Razor1911"". But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!!"
,raviraj87,2009-12-17T15:22Z,"Guys please upload Setup.exe for ""Left 4 Dead 2-razor1911"" Windows 7 (x64) compatible.
