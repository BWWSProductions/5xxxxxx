Sorry all I can offer you is to download them from the torrent or check out my site."

[T],Kajirae_melantha,2010-03-04T05:40Z,This is the uncensored version hence why it is labeled [UNCEN]... screenshots and covers are included with the download as stated in the description.
,Plasmadude,2010-09-20T22:18Z,Why the fuck should i download it to get screen shots.  What does screen mean?  view after?
,natehbabeh,2011-05-13T10:33Z,"THE COVER AND THE SCREENS ARE ON THE TORRENT DUMBASS, DOWNLOAD THE SCREENS FIRST IF YOU WANT TO"
