,Zamorak1,2009-11-22T21:43Z,"Seems a little too good to be true... I hope that it works though.

What I don't understand is this part:

- THE LAUNCH OF THE GAME NEED TO BE MADED CAREFULLY FOR THE WANTED MISSION AREA BE CORRECTLY AVAILABLE TO GAMEPLAY

and this:

- SAVES NOT POSSIBLE BUT ALL THE MISSIONS AVAILABLE AND EACH MISSION HAVE A FEW AREAS AND THE PLAYER CAN PLAY ALL OF THEM ONE AT THE TIME AND ALL OF THEM ARE AVAILABLE

Also, is the crash at desktop after the intro fixed? I keep getting it on my work PC, works fine on my quad core, except with the demo crack that keeps crashing after certain activities."

,mig092,2009-11-22T22:37Z,"i downloaded this from somewhere else. actually it is the full game. the author just used something to compress the sounds so the download is much smaller. it unpacks alright. for me the game crashes randomly, but might work fine for some of you....."

,THEGAME304,2009-11-24T15:27Z,"i bought this game yesterday just to see what all the hipe is about it. i played it for 2 hours and realized i wasted $50.00. it is no more that a repetitive game. you walk 30 feet and get attacked by a large group of zombies. 30 more feet another group of zombies. one plus is that there is alot of blood and gore, but that is in all shooters.this game is pumped up to be way better than it really is.graphics are good, scary in some spots , but to be truthful , badlands is a way better game. just my opinion, so all the asses on here, please keep your shit to yourselves.  damn i just thought of something. why are so many people downloading this still when it DEFINATELY DONT work. thats why i bought it. oh well keep downloading. bought copies play perfect."

,zeonic,2009-11-25T01:21Z,"The torrent works just fine, takes a while to decompress but seems to be the full game.  Still seems to have some of the major flaws that all these releases have though, crashing at safe room, can't pick up certain melee weapons, ammo types, grenade launcher, and most importantly, can't pick up / use certain items (i.e. cola) necessary to advance the level.

Nice job on the compression... but it still doesn't work."

This torrent actually does work the game installs correctly and plays to a certain extent, however game creators are introducing new coding methods so people cannot crack games so easily. Either way you're not paying for this so stop complaining you downloaded it because you didnt want to buy the game and it has not worked you've not lost anything, just wait for a patch for Globe or another uploader.

P.S. Lars buy a better machine before posting you're crappy specs and throwing random abuse. "

,Please_wait...,2009-11-26T20:27Z,"There seems to be a lot of disappointment around here and actually a lot of anger towords  this uploader.

I donwloaded the game I played it. It worked VERY GOOD. So now I must do whats is right and defend and thank the uploader and or the reaper.

Please people, if somebody shares something for free and devotes a lot of time providing you with stuff you should be thankful.

Yes it is true that we don't understand the loader.exe in Russian and the instructions ware translated poorly, and also audio the converter doesn't show anything that is running (except seeing it running in task manager), but this doesn't make this upload shitty as some of you might call it.

Also if you want to play all chapters and change the difficulty just press escape during game play and a ""magical"" menu appears that allows you to change from ALL levels, all in English.

Thank you uploader and/or riper for this very small and fast-downloading/working rip!

Technical info addon:
This game crashes sometimes on some computers. Just start it using compatibility mode WinXP and it will never crash.
For others the Video driver (especially on nVidia) crashes the game before it even starts. So try updating it.
To all, console is poorly managed because of Windows 7 and Vista. A tip for not autoclosing the console while trying to type is to type a letter that will not cause the console to close after that letter you can type anny command you want, and after that delete that first leter end execute any command you want. (ex. Qsv_cheats 1, then erase the Q and execute the command)."

,Danimoloko,2009-11-28T00:01Z,"For those of you who are as frustrated as I am with the whole russian language launcher thing (don't get me wrong, thank you VERY much for the torrent - both the uploader and author of it) I finally kicked myself enough in the ass to translate it. No, I am not russian, but I'm A.D.D so I typed it into a russian character website keyboard, proceeded to use Google translate and then Wikipedia search it to get the correct names of levels and junk. Here it is:

T?? ????: Game Type
????????????? ???? = Campaign
????? ???????? = Versus
????? ????????? = Survival

?????????: Difficulty
????? = Easy
????????? = Normal
?????? = Hard
??????? = Expert

????????: Campaign

??????? ?????? = Hard Rain
?????? = The Parish

??? ????????: Character
?????? = Coach
??? = Nick
????? = Ellis
?????? = Rochelle

Buttons
?????? = Launch
??????? ?????? = Create Server
???????????? = Connect

I didn't really see anyone comment on the russian thing, so I don't even know if I'm actually helping, but it helped me a lot. I like to actually KNOW what I'm doing to my computer, and you may to. Anyways, I haven't even tried the torrent yet but again, thank you so much.

P.S: The drop down menu beside the Campaign menu (on the right) is not translated because it represents the different levels of the campaign (inbetween safehouses I suppose).

1. It will crash back to desktop if date is not set to Nov 17

4. Crappy russian launcher and crappy instructions"

,thecow777,2009-12-09T00:44Z,"i got it working, do everything the readme says, unrar, move 2 desktop, run globe converter for like 10min, the globe converter dosnt say its running, you can only tell by looking at it in task manager/processes. 

when you start the game the menu only lets you choose online options, go into the console by pressing ~ which is the button left of 1, above tab and below escape. with console is open type map * and click submit. It should give you a list of the maps, double click one to play. to change difficulty click escape, call a vote, change difficulty. i don't think you can change characters though. And when your about to finish a level dont, at the end of the level(when your in safehouse), do the console thing and load next level cause upon finishing a level the game crashes(atleast it does with me). 

If you do that like i did the game WORKS 100%.

WHEN you have a problem with a game that came from a torrent with so many seeds, you...
1. CHECK COMPATIBILITY MODE!
2. Update direct X and all your video drivers, and make sure C++ redist and PhysX drivers are installed for those with nvidia.
3.Make sure you place the cracks in the right files.

Most of YOU JUST DON'T READ the damn readme and/or .nfo files.  Stop crying like children when something doesn't work for you.

Stop rating it down because of YOUR OWN IGNORANCE.

,eNooB,2010-08-07T20:15Z,"Ok this is the third time I will post on this torrent in a row. If your game crashes at 90% of load you can fix it doing this:
1) Change the date and time on your computer. Put it backwards.
2) Change the time Zone

I have Windows 7, I don't know does this crashes have anything to do with Windows update or not, but I found that this way my game is working. Tho everyday I have to change those few settings. I have no problem with that. If you dont get it from the first time, don't worry put the date on your pc even more back, and change to some other timezone. I usually succeed after 3 times to load it right. I have been trying out this for last 3 days and it is working for me. Try it yourself."

,domfontana,2011-01-05T18:57Z,"Here are my problems with the game and I wonder if anyone can help me.

1) The torrent description should have said the Launcher was in Russian.
2) It says to change the rev.txt file to your language. I don't have a rev.txt file; I have a rev.ini file. I checked that and it's already set to English. I even saved it as rev.txt (and also kept rev.ini), but the Launcher is still in Russian. The first question is how can I change the Launcher to English?
3) I used the left4dead2.exe file and the game started fine and was in English, but it won't let me select the Single-Player game mode. So my second question is, how do I do that?

You probably have to start the game with the Launcher for single-player, but I can't do that until I figure out how to display it in Emglish.

Any help would be appreciated.
