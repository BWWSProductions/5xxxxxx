,sgtballz,2011-01-14T20:58Z,"Can the subs be turned off?  Having constant subtitles for silly things like ""elevator bell dings"" and people speaking with acents, ruins this film for me.  It's a goergeous film and I want to see it the way it's supposed to be.  
Otherwise the quality is 10/10. thanks for the upload"
,jermtpb,2011-05-31T14:01Z,"@sgtballz. Sorry to hear this damages your personal viewing experience. If you want to see it the way it's supposed to be why don't you just buy the movie and rip the movie yourself. Believe me no one cares for your concerns. If you like the movie great, don't get picky about it-"

I'm glad you like the movie and the upload!"
