The portable version still works, but BEWARE!
While using it to defrag my 250GB drive, the portable version I downloaded in THIS torrent trashed my drive & the 179 GB of music on it.  Thanks to GETDATABACK & plenty of time/patience, I recovered all the files unharmed, but I had to repartition the hard drive afterwards, not a fun experience.  
I highly recommend UltraDefrag - I've used it on dozens of computers for years and I won't be distracted by new defraggers in the future.
Good luck - USE WITH CAUTION!!!"
