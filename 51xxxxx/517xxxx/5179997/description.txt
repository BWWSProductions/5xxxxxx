From the director of Rise of the Footsoldier (Julian Gilbey) comes his eagerly awaited new release Reckoning Day; the explosive, action-thriller set in the dangerous world of international drugs crime.
When Ed (Roman Karpynec), a member of the US special forces, witnesses the massacre of his elite unit of men, he sets out on a bloody mission of revenge. In doing so he takes on an international drugs ring led by the ruthless Charles Toll (Saul Linklater), and races to bring him down before the release of a deadly new drug.
In a brutal game of cat and mouse, Ed hunts Toll down across the United States and into the UK. With time running he resorts to ever more desperate measures to ensure justice is done as the chase pounds towards its heart-stopping climax.
A relentlessly gritty action film, Reckoning Day takes its inspiration from modern day low-budget classics such as Evil Dead (Sam Raimi), Bad Taste (Peter Jackson) and El Mariachi (Robert Rodriguez), and gives it a uniquely British spin. Released September 14th 2002
