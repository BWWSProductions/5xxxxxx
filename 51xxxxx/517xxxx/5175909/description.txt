After some months of rehearsing Saint left the band and Dariusz ï¿½Seegï¿½ Barabas joined as a new drummer. In September 2007 ESCAPE FROM entered IX Studio to record their first promo CD entitled ï¿½Ciemna Strona Duszyï¿½. It featured two songs and was released in December 2007. This material was mainly meant for promotion and to interest labels.

In the same time Micha? ï¿½Urgulï¿½ Barski joined the band as a second guitarist.
