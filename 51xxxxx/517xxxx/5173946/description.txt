I am doing my first upload here because I couldn't find this anywhere. I have patched the new Mario Brothers to work with disc launchers on softmodded Wiis. It works great!

This has been tested on Neogamma and will surely work on all others. The version is the NTSC that has been floating around here for a while, but a patch has now been released so it works from disc. I have scrubbed it with Wiiscrubber. Good to go.

Download, unrar, burn(slowly!) and enjoy!
