Many, many, thank you bro!!! Mabuhey!!!"
,tikol69,2009-11-27T08:47Z,"ADVICE to ALL - Nentendog Nazii Gestapo would always advice U to upgrade ur system to version 4.2, 4.1. or 4.0. If your system is 3.x - DO NOT UPGRADE - u just need to upgrade ur CIOS to waninkoko 249 rev 14 with 002 fix - thats it and all ur games will work 99% using Neogamma v.7 and backup channel 0.3 gamma edition. Some games will work on Neogamma v.7 and some will work on backup channel gamma 0.3 - VICE-VERSA."

,djfanatic,2012-03-21T14:10Z,"I have been using the pirate bay for years and now i registered just to write this comment. I wanted to play this game so badly i tried everything, so this torrent works perfectly, for noob softmoders like me, who was reading the internet for the past 4 days i finally managed to do it. The most easy and safety way to do this is to download modmii one wonderful well organised program that helps you through a wizard to install everything you need for your wii, it creates a folder 'copy to sd' it's so easy and fun, and even generates aa custom guide just for you. I used this, installed all necessary cios, wad, usb loaders and so on, i even changed my wii theme. so just download modmii, because you need cios53 i think in order to play this game. when everything is finished get neogammer8 and load the game from there, works great no problems at all, thanks a lot :) "
