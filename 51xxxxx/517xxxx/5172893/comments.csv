If you want a digital version the Lynn website even offers Studio Master quality MP3 files. It's sacrilege to think that you might do her justice with a low quality download.

Now that I've had a rant about quality please take a second to appreciate that she is not a million dollar recording artist. She makes her bucks week by week singing her guts out."
