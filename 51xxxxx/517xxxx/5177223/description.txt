Orianthi was born in Adelaide, Australia, of half Greek descent.

She has been playing in different friends' bands since she was 14 in England and in France. Her first support show was for Steve Vai aged 15. Orianthi had the opportunity to meet and jam with Carlos Santana when she was 18.

A guitar solo by Orianthi is featured on the song "Sleepwalker" on Adam Lambert's debut album For Your Entertainment.

Orianthi was Michael Jackson's lead guitarist and was present on all rehearsals for his This Is It tour before his death. In regards to being handpicked by Jackson, she stated:
 	"I donΓÇÖt know exactly why he picked me, but he watched myvideos and loved them. He had his choice of guitar players, but I came in and played the ΓÇÿBeat ItΓÇÖ solo for him. Afterward he was so happy he got up and grabbed my arm and started walking up and down the stage area with me. He said, ΓÇÿCan you play once for me?ΓÇÖ He hired me that night. I wish he was still around. He made me believe in myself more, and I learned so much. Going into it, I thought it would be all about playing guitar solos. But the majority of it was playing chords and funky rhythms.ΓÇ¥

She played and sang at Jackson's memorial, globally televised live on July 7, 2009. She appears in the film Michael Jackson's This Is It, which chronicles the rehearsals for the tour.
