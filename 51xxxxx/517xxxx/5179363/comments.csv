,buner,2009-11-25T21:07Z,"how to install this? The iso has a bunch of files, but no installer."

,keykol,2009-11-25T23:59Z,couldn't wait to play.. and then.. haven't seen the blue screen for a long time after crash. probably nothing to bother about but i have to fix it first.
,Donalddln,2009-11-26T03:17Z,Thanks again for the torrent.
,suisenbenjo,2009-11-26T03:46Z,"@buner
Before you ask stupid questions, check to see if it's already been explicitly answered."
,holetz,2009-11-26T17:43Z,"It works!

1 - Unpack the *.sid/*.sis files and the crack folder from the .iso file (forget about the rest, I think this is more a joke from ""The Sceners"" then a real thing)..

2 - Download the Phoenix SID Extractor: r.a.p.i.d.s.h.a.r.e.c.o.m/files/311915144/Phoenix_SID_Extractor.rar
(remove dots..)

3 - Place the program inside a foldes and run it. It will create files in that folder.. When it's done, run it and update it! ( Help > Phoenix Update Centre )

4 - Install the DirectX and the vcredist_sp1_x86.exe. They are inside ""Redist"" folder, in the folder where you placed the Phoenix.exe

5 - Run the program and go to Instruments > Sid Unpacker

6 - Click: Scan a SIM-file (select the sid file you extracted from the ISO) > Select all > Unpack. Now you need to select a folder where the game will be extracted...

7 - Now go to that folder and copy all crack contenct inside the BIN folder...

8 - Open your torrent client and make sure you are seeding

8 - Now run ""SamHD.exe"" and have fun!

Thanks Reloaded :D

,ClaudiuTTTVenom,2009-12-04T14:00Z,"FOR ALL THAT WANT TO DOWNLOAD THIS....READ AND RECONSIDER ! ! ! 
Proper Notes:

Dear RELOADED, you may find it hilarious to have to redo
ingame settings (keys,screen options) every time you start the
game up. The rest of us finds it very painfull and also quite
boring, so therefore we bring a proper crack for the game 

While testing we found more missed Steam calls, which caused
RELOADEDs version to crash - Go to Voice Options, and change
it to: Open Microphone and BAM a Steam call was initialized!

Thats just one example out of a bunch of missed Steam calls
we have removed. Calls that RELOADED have overlooked/missed in
their rush to win the release.

Profile loading and saving is of course also working in our
release.

Our edition has also got a decent installer, as the RELOADED
one failed to unpack properly on 2 out of 5 of our test
machines.

As the nice people we are, then we included an Language/Game
Launcher, so that the game is now multi 5, and can be launched
in the following languages:

English, German, French, Spanish and Italian"

And 4 the peoples that dont know how to crack it Just make sure to overwrite the files in the ""Bin"" directory with the ones in the ""SKIDROW"" folder on the image and run the game as administrator, and enjoy because this game is 
fun as hell. 

Thanks a lot to SKIDROW and AiTB! "
