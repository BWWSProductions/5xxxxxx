    [ FiNAL NOTES ]

 If you really like this software, consider purchasing it!  Seriously, keep 
 the hard working programmers paid; Motivate them to create more good stuff 
  for us to pirate.  If you don't care about this software, then delete it  
  because it's only fair.  This program is for the purpose of evaluation.
