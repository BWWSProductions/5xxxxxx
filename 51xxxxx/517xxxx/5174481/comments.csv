,eddietah,2009-11-24T01:30Z,"Hi Shroo,

No offend but when I extract the winrar file my Microsoft Security Essentials detected the TPTB.exe file as trojan and quarantine it. I had download so many TPTB game rip but never before had my antivirus detected any virus/trojan before. This is the first time. So is the file safe? Can i still install using the DOS Batch without the TPTB.exe file? And also there are 2 DOS Batch file. The one inside the winrar and the second one which you posted here. So which one should I use? Please kindly advise. Sorry for all the trouble and thanks in advance for your help ASAP.

Best Regards,
eddietah"

The walkthrough says that there are some enemies ahead but there are no enemies
