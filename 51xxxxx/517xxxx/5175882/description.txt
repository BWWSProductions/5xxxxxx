Top Gear 2 36 Classic Driving Tracks(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
______________________________________________________

I like this one!! It's fab for driving, and equally good at parties,
as long as you're a 30-something plus! The beats per minute aren't 
too high, and this will therefore not cause you to rev up to max speed. 

But it does help to pass a long journey, or cheer you up while you're 
stuck in that infernal traffic jam.

The album has music from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and the 90s, and is a well
thought-out selection of music. 

There is no 'sameness' about the tracks, so each new track will be a 
gentle surprise to you, and you will sometimes reach for the cover, 
to see who the artist was on a particular track! 
I did, for 'Driver's Seat - Sniff 'n' the Tears. 

Did you know that that was a hit in 1979? 
Anyway, lest I get too carried away, a good buy, if you are a 
compilation-junkie like me, and an album you will come to treasure.
