,mikalcarbine257,2009-12-14T19:34Z,"Great torrent but while installing NOD32 reported: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\CorelWinDVD2010\UleadWMSrcFilter.ax	probably a variant of Win32/Genetik trojan

Could be a false positive, program still seems to work fine"
,simonthesomething,2009-12-20T22:29Z,"Thx for the upload, I really appriciate it. Anyway, I am trying to install it and I have done everything as you descriped, but when I come to the part where I have to activate via the code the keygen provides, I get the message, that the code is invalid. Any one who can help me out? Thx in advance"
,Bilderbooger,2010-01-02T19:35Z,"Thanks! Works Great!

The program sucks though, because it forces you to keep  the install files in the application folder, and if they are removed or altered,  it locks the program and pops up a security warning when you restart your computer.

I had to reinstall it after a utility program removed the install files from the folder, so I had to exclude it from future scans."

Block your internet connection while installing/activating! 
Install the software and use the keygen to generate a key code as  serial number for the installer.   

After installation use phone activation to register WinDVD 2010.
Please, note that you need the key code in order to generate the  activation code!                                                     

NOTE: This is a newer version than our previous release from  2009/09/10. For example, this new version includes Windows 7      touch-screen support!   

           ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         

Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or  even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit! "
,ZEER0VER,2010-02-14T12:45Z,"In addition I've found the setup not so clean, beware .."
,hunnicuddler,2010-03-25T12:52Z,If ur worried about a virus from the keygen use Sandboxie to run it.. I do that and save me PC from strange behaviour.. :D
,lies3,2010-04-11T21:19Z,"I vouch for this torrent.. works perfectly.

Disable your network connection and run the setup.

You hit the first button in the keygen, put the 'key code' in as the serial number in the installer. Save that code so you can put it back into the keygen, or just keep the keygen open.

When you reach the activation screen, go to other options, and copy the installation code from the installer to the keygen, without the dashes. When both codes are in the keygen, hit the second button and copy the activation code to the installer. Tadaa, activated."
,texas_playboy98,2010-04-29T05:28Z,"if you get a key generator and it shows up as a virus 99% of the time that is a good thing. it doesn't mean it is a virus, it means your anti-virus thinks it is.

now if you get a key generator and it doesn't show up as a virus... update your anti virus :D"
,texas_playboy98,2010-04-29T08:02Z,"ok ima try and idiot proof the key gen that everyone seems to hate.. for good reason :D

KEEP KEYGEN OPEN... DO NOT CLOSE.
open the key gen. click key code on the right side.
copy and paste during install.
KEEP KEYGEN OPEN... DO NOT CLOSE

after install open windvd.
click activate now.
click the phone option.
now u see 3 lines. one is key code. one is installation code. one is activation code.

all lines are filled in except the activation code.
now copy the installation code from the windvd page into the key gen on the line called installation

now the key gen has the ORIGINAL key gen that u used during install. and the installation code.

press generate. copy activation code into windvd and press ok.. congrats :D

YOU DONT ACTUALLY CALL ANYONE..."
,blasto_master,2010-06-09T09:20Z,"Very easy and clean download. Just disable your virus protection for a little bit and it won't attack the keygen. I was wondering why some of the functions were disabled? When playing a blue ray rip, you can't change the color. Any body have a solution for this?"
,ArturVGT2,2010-06-23T03:54Z,Cool
,haguey666,2010-07-06T15:18Z,"THANKS MATE, WORKED PERFECT!!"

,r1tek,2010-09-21T17:21Z,"WinDVD has stopped working
Windows is searching for a solution....

Anyone run into this problem?

It happened after the DVD already started to play and then I tried to Maximize and that's when I ran into this problem.  Problem with my copy of the software?  Or is it my graphics?

Thakn you"

,csabaxb,2010-12-07T09:26Z,"Install it's easy, but the program NOT work fully. Many options are stopped.. Not much to set like in older version of windvd. Any way thanx uploader.
Follow Texas_playboy98 instructions for install. It's very good."
,dubdub_blue,2011-02-02T16:30Z,nope - keygen is not working!!!!!
,geotho,2011-04-24T00:35Z,Anyone please post the serial no and activation code.Tks
,EastLink,2011-05-04T22:47Z,"Good torrent, it seemed to work fine. What a shame it is that blu ray software is so overpriced, for the same price of this product I could buy an actual Blu Ray player for the TV, but its double the price for a Bd Drive and Software. If it was cheaper and Blu Ray software companies weren't so damn greedy, I honestly would consider buying the product."
,VistaHell,2011-07-24T15:43Z,"crashes when i put a blu ray disc in...

anyone know how to fix that?

other than that great torrent."
,tophtml,2011-09-06T07:22Z,"r1tek, try disabling hardware acceleration. "
