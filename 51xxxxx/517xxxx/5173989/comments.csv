,cowgirlbellydancer,2009-11-22T01:31Z,"Oh, yeah, 67 files. Then you open a file, have to go to another website that is filled with viruses. I can't believe that people are actually downloading this!"
,britt2323,2009-11-22T01:49Z,you have to unpack the rared files its the same exact upload as AiTB do dont listen to cowgirlbellydancer its legit. Video is watchable and sound a bit hollow but not too bad but definitely NOT a fake or virus.
