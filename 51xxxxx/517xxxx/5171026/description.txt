The Isle Of Man From The Air + bonus - by.Smelly Cat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Isle of Man has one of the worldâ€™s most fascinating landscapes - shaped by the last Ice Age, weathered by time and coloured by human history. But much of this beautiful and dramatic scenery is rarely seen to its full advantage and can only be hinted at from a ground-level view.
In this unique program, we give you a rare opportunity to savour the entire Island from the air using the latest helicopter camera techniques. Presenter Charles Guard leads you through the story of the landscape as the history, spectacular scenery and unique aerial views are set against a specially-composed musical soundtrack.


Special Features:

Fly the Coast - a full aerial tour of the coast
Follow the Sulby River - the island's longest river as you've never seen it before
Digital Mapping of the Isle of Man - a look at how digital maps of the island are produced
