""The universe began with light...'' blah, blah, blah. Go blow it out your ear. Just look what you're doing: using what YOU know about science to discount religious principles. Do you know everything about science? There is an infinite amount of knowledge that you still lack. And judging by your hubris, the one Quark of knowledge plucked from the infinite universe (and I am being generous by giving you that much!) that you possess, is not even sufficient to explain how the simplest life form is made. You can't do that which is least, yet you claim to have more knowledge than God? You will truly deserve your time in the fire on Judgment day. I thank God He is going to Judge you one day. I want to see the look on your face when you see Jesus returning in the clouds one day soon. Yes, even you will bow before your maker. Deny now, for one day your knee will bend and you will wail bloody tears when you see just what an fool you've been and how you allowed your pride, sex, and pleasure to lead you so obediently the path the devil has prepared for you. I honestly feel sorry for you, because you truly don't know better. You're one of those similar to the Ninevites. God said they didn't even know their right from their left."

Religion has caused more & bloodier atrocities than anything else in history.

Kudos, Pastafarian101! "

Why is it that idiots like Tamarind777 that speak so highly about God and Jesus always tend to spew the most hatred. ""You will truly deserve your time in the fire""??? 

Imagine Tamarind777 without a god figure, who knows what kind of animal he/she would be. Given by your comment it seems to me you must be unstable. So, yes, I thank your god for keeping you on a short leash."
,Pastafarian101,2009-11-20T07:37Z,"Tamarind777 I will pray to the Flying Spaghetti Monster for you. At least the Flying Spaghetti Monster does not punish person X for person B's crimes!

You know deep down inside that the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists, your religion of denying the Flying Spaghetti Monster is but a crude one. Open your heart, let the noodly appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster enter you!

Ramen!!!"
