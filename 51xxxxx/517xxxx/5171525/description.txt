This short eBook will help you explore 10 questions which, when answered, will determine the shape, size, structure, direction and strategy of your business.

The first point to address is who this eBook is intended for. If you are planning on seeking major investment to launch the business, and that business is complex in  nature, you will probably need a more detailed treatise of the startup process. I recommend â€˜The Economist Guide to Business Planningâ€™ for you (ISBN: 9781861974747). For anyone looking to set up a business from savings, redundancy pay-outs or for free, or whose business is likely to be fairly uncomplicated in nature, read on - weâ€™ll uncover and simplify the mysteries together.

A lot of people set up businesses based on their expertise - youâ€™re a graphic designer so you set up a graphic design business. This makes sense, but only to an extent. Running a business requires, as counter-intuitive as it may seem, much more than just doing the job for which you hope to be paid. You need to know who your customers are going to be, where they congregate, what they like and dislike and more. You need to know where your competition comes from and why your prospective customers buy from them.

Answering these questions before investing your time, energy and money (what I call â€˜the tripletsâ€™) will save you a huge amount of all three once youâ€™re set up.
