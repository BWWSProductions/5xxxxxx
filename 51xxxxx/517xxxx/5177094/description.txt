   The  Vocoder was  invented by  Homer Dudley  in the  mid-30's of  the last 
   century. Dudley worked  at Bell Laboratories,  and this is  where the first 
   Vocoder took shape. The basic function of a Vocoder is characterized by  an 
   analysis of the input signal, usually  speech but other type of inputs  can 
   also be very interesting. In a special filter bank, a spectral analysis  is 
   performed and signals  are developed which  follows the amount  of spectral 
   energy in each  channel. Another part  of the analyzer  tests if there  are 
   unvoiced or voiced sounds at any particular time and extracts the pitch  of 
   the  voiced  sounds.  The  output section  of  the  vocoder  consists of  a 
   stereophonic synthesis filter bank which assembles the new synthetic speech 
   from the characteristic filter  envelopes from the analysis  stage together 
   with an external or internal replacement signal. 
             
   What makes MATRIX different to the vocoders in the past ?  
             
   Precise  analog  modelling  8-pole  filters  and  extremely  fast  envelope 
   followers  for unprecedented resynthesis quality. 
             
   New  voiced/unvoiced detection  and pitch  extraction algorithms  for high 
   intelligibility. 
             
   Stereophonic synthesis filter bank preserves the spatial characteristic  of 
   the replacement signal. 
             
   Easy to use interface. 
             
   Latency free operation.

   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5
   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
