Eddie himself, not the best ever, since I just watched Live at the Ambassadors and there were a lot of recycled jokes from that show. Other stuff was nice, but not much."
,Bon_Scott_was_fred888,2009-11-21T12:13Z,"I know what's more pathetic zmacdaddy8, it's the twat who watches something knowing they won't enjoy it."
,Kilu1971,2009-11-22T23:52Z,"Excellent quality, and what's even more important, an excellent show. Better than Sexie."
,giffo5,2009-12-07T04:41Z,"I watched this show live in Tampa... my face was aching for days from laffin and grinning ! 
Sexie was a let down, but everything else he has done had been excelent ! "
,giffo5,2009-12-07T04:42Z,"Oh , by the way  THANKS FOR THE UP !!! 
YOUR A STAR ! "
,SGAK,2009-12-21T13:20Z,"This show is just as good as Circle and Unrepeatable. A lot of silly weirdness. 
London seems to be the toughest crowd to please. 

Stripped is waay better than Sexie (the dvd - version), where he was obviously tired and worn out, which is a shame because the tour was fantastic! "

,chamonecheckcheck,2010-01-07T01:03Z,"ignore that last comment... although not all of the files are showing up as rars... all after "".r29"" show up blank.. any tips?"
,zannarose,2010-01-20T07:29Z,I can't seem to get this downloaded. I'm trying to use FrostWire but maybe there's a better program to try? I really want this too :-( Any advice?
,Sid_of_Id,2010-04-04T07:46Z,Saw this one live (different venue) and it was awesome.  He does so much ad-lib that at least 1/4th of every show is different from any other.
