[T],SpandauBaby,2009-11-27T19:04Z,"@soilwork2008: Yes thanks, I think Kotzen is great.  There was talk on his forum recently about whether he will do a G3 with Satch and Vai and they think it would be great to see such a thing happen.  I mean I have seen some like with John Petrucci and Yngwie Malmsteen and Eric Johnson.  I heard there was one with Paul Gilbert but I didn't see that, I think Gilbert is good.  I actually saw a G3 once with Robert Fripp from King Crimson, it was pretty cool.  I'm sure that Kotzen would be very welcomed on stage for G3, he is a superb guitarist!"

,gearofwar,2009-12-07T01:37Z,Loving your torrents SpandauBaby yet another good one here.
,12xu,2009-12-16T00:23Z,SpandauBaby how can I contact you?
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-16T19:05Z,"@12xu:  What's on your mind?  Just give us a shout on here and let me know whatever you want to say, I keep checking these torrents all the time.  Feel free to voice your opinion, that's what it's all about.  I'm sorry but I can't really give out anything on here because I could get into trouble and I don't want that happening."
,12xu,2009-12-17T02:26Z,"Yes, of course I realise that, it's about an invite :-)"
,12xu,2009-12-18T23:57Z,"OK, SpandauBaby you can reach me at 12xu@hushmail.com"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-22T01:20Z,What kind of invite?
,12xu,2009-12-22T16:46Z,To a private tracker to help you preserve your amazing torrents
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-22T23:01Z,Which tracker are you talking about?  These torrents are fine here just as long as the Pirate Bay stays like it is...
,12xu,2009-12-23T00:03Z,"Well you obviously don't really understand the protocol here, I set up an email specifically so that you could contact me in private, rather than broadcast it to the entire world on an open tracker, after you had expressed concerns about how long your torrents may live if tpb went down etc. 

Now ask yourself, why would I do that rather than just put it on here for all to see?
"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-24T20:40Z,"Well I've thought about this long and hard.  I just want to say at this point you may as well keep your little private tracker info to yourself if you're gonna be like that.  You should have asked me if I wanted to join one in the first place.  I really cannot be bothered, go and ask somebody else instead.  I don't think anybody around here cares so why should I be any different?  If you want these files then come here and download them, if not then download something else instead.  I really have much more important things to think about."
,stamina72,2009-12-28T08:46Z,"Thank you for upping this! Some of these albums are very hard to find, so i really appreciate it!"
,Piratovsky,2010-04-27T19:13Z,Great torrent with well done tagging. Thanks!
,scoopnohlee,2011-03-11T22:48Z,Very well detailed.  You should run a seminar for all the uploaders showing them that it's possible to upload organized torrents.:)
,geotho,2011-05-10T03:51Z,Thank You So much SpandauBaby.Expecting more metal blades.
