Here is the discography of Richie Kotzen.  For more information on Richie read about him on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Kotzen

This is pretty much his biggest discography that's ever been shared before.  Just about most of his main work is included, lots of Solo albums plus also some of his guitar work with Poison and Mr. Big and another Jazz Fusion band he played on an album called Vertu.  This is a great selection of Richie's work on guitar and also as a singer, writer and performer.  Bearing in mind also he can play many different instruments including guitar, piano, bass, drums and also sings very good, he is multi talented.  I saw Richie playing live just last month gone, he is an awesome guitarist and plays such great things, makes it look easy he does but of course he has played for years and years, since the 1980s when he was very young.  

Anyway check his music out, worth looking at.  I have fully tagged all of these with album arkwork included.  All mp3s are at the same quality at 320kbps CBR 44.1 Khz.

If you like his music then please leave a comment, would be good to hear from anybody who is already a fan of Richie's.  All I can say is I was really pleased to see him perform live on his current tour, what a great guy and multi talented musician.
