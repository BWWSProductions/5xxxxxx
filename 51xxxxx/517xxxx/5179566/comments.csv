This is a mayor screw up. Big black edges almost cutting of more then 50% on 4:3; 16:9 and even my 16:10 screen!

If it isnt 1.78:1 then don't post high definition video's."

The correct Aspect Ratio (AR) is the AR that the Disk is originally in. If its 2.35 then that its. Thereafter while watchin if you get 2 black bars on your TV or monitor - be happy since you are watchin the film as it shoud be in its coreect AR. (BTW, black bars that are encoded in the rip itself suck & such rippers are stupid noobs)"
