My biggest dream is to put it on a memory pen and after into my dvd player. If this is possibel. Im not wery good in english but i try and nobody seems to know to help me.
Kindly to all help i can get "
,bjoernhund,2009-11-24T18:39Z,"vodoomann, here's how to make it work: 

-go to a subtitles site 
and search for the subtitle you want. 

-then put the file (should be -srt or .txt file) 
into the SAME FOLDER as the video file. 

-Important: 
MAKE SURE THE SUBTITLES FILE 
HAS EXACTLY THE SAME NAME 
AS THE VIDEO FILE!!!! 

-Then transfer it to your memory pen 
and connect to dvd/divx player. 

Start video 
and press the subtitles button on the player. 

Voila! It should now be working 

;-)"
