Invincible #68
	
By: ROBERT KIRKMAN, Ryan Ottley, Fco Plasencia

EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW! We return to Earth after the brief space interlude involving Nolan and Allen the Alien... but is it the Earth we knew?! What changes have taken place? What has transpired in the time we were away? Who is DINOSAURUS?! This issue is a can't-miss for long-time fans of Invincible and an excellent jumping-on point for people who have yet to dip their toes in the INVINCIBLE waters.

Thanks to DCP for the excellent scan.
