,svadilfari,2009-11-20T19:56Z,why do ppl keep uploading the same torrent as this one which was the first ...cmon makes no sense
[V],Mbb15,2009-11-20T19:58Z,"it make sense 

1. or you have 1 seeder (uploader/ 10000 leechers
1 or you have 5 seeds (5 uploaders) / 2000 leechers each it will go faster.."
,LockedBasement,2009-11-20T19:59Z,"what programss should i use for this. i already have winrar, what else?"
[V],Shroo,2009-11-20T20:13Z,"Release is NUKED! Dont download, it uses the same russian crack which is rubish, the game crashes at the loading screen.

Dont try this when your ""legit account is turned on unless u want it banned


client.dll will hold your steam acc footprint details
dunno guess rzr was pretty dum rlsing their l4d2 with their legit client.dll lul
client.dll is ceg protected
if you download the game
and send that file to someone game will crash
since the file is not complete after you run the game for once
it injects the missing bytes + your acc footprint

so if u try it on a legit account it will fuck things up
wonder what client.dll they used"
[V],Mbb15,2009-11-20T20:49Z,people can still download this and wait for a better crack....

,raviraj87,2009-12-11T17:32Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). I have ""Left 4 Dead 2 - Razor1911"". But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!!"

Along the road I installed C++ 2008 as well. Perhaps that could have made a difference as well.

Sound in game works fine."
,Thanh3596,2009-12-27T11:33Z,I can't find any RARs to extract :(
,crossebby,2010-02-09T12:39Z,"This game graphics sucks. I tried hard to play this game after applying lots of patches and fixes and reg. files. fianlly I solved the crashes.

Now what the new problem is that the game starts and after little while the screen gets black and white, everything looks like old type of black and white movie. I need to press Alt+Tab to get to desktop then reselect the game to go back to reset this ""graphic bug"" every after 2 or 3 minuts and getting frustraited and loosing interest on this game.

 This is very big disoppointment to me. I never had this kind of problem with any other game, this game is just sucks and the game play is so boring.

 Any one suggest what is the appropriate solution for my issue...?

My Sys Specs:
OS: W7 32bit
IntelXeon 3065 3.0Ghz
4GB Samsung DDR2
8800GTX, with 192Nvidia drivers.

,adimosh,2011-03-27T14:13Z,"I don't know who is to blame for this: Valve or Razor 1911. I assume that it is, after all, Razor 1911, as a game with so many apparent problems weould have never made it without VERY serious criticism (of which we appear to see none). So, sorry, guys, thanks for your attempt at cracking the game, but it simply isn't good enough."
