,Fig-Neutron,2009-11-29T04:59Z,Do you know if any and which are from mojohd?  I heard they have ads and a logo that pops up.  Much thanks.
,trntz_man,2009-12-07T14:34Z,"I have not downloaded this yet, but thank you very much ahead of time. 

I am really sad that Australia__, Fighter Pilot, and Encounter____ is all corrupt but the others fill the gap of my sadness.

I have been trying to get these movies for a while.

I expect that this will take forever to download these since you are the only seeder currently haha."
,928s4vr,2010-02-07T18:21Z,Please download and watch The Cove 2009.  It's about the slaughter of thousand and thousands of dolphins in Japan every year from Sept to March
,mak621,2010-02-21T00:48Z,"downloading now, cant wait to watch!  @928s4 - watched 'the cove' it was a GREAT documentary but hard to watch...terrible, terrible, terrible what goes on over there.  money is the root of all evil.  as long as moneys involved, dolphins and all sea life are screwed!  another good documentary is 'End of the Line' about depleting the oceans...scary stuff.  cheers"

,agathecosta,2010-08-28T14:08Z,there are no seeders at the moment 0 (67) could some possibly come back with this one? 3k/s
,ratsima,2011-07-11T11:28Z,This is a great torrent with good seed/leecher numbers. But still it is coming so painfully slowly. My torrent client is expecting it to complete in a year or so!!! Anyway the speeds can be improved a bit? Thanks to the u/loader and the existing seeds.
