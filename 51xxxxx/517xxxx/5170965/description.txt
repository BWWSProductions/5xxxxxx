Joining a decadentist and historicist artistic vision, BORGIAâ€™s Black Death Metal (Blasphemi Obsignati Resignaculo Germaninferorum In Aeternum) is inspired by the Sick, the Occult and the Mystic of the medieval, renaissance and baroque periods of the Church. 

Founded in 2003, the Parisian band has three demos out, of which both last ones â€œMandragoreâ€ (2006) and â€œAmphythalamus Horrorisâ€ (2007) put the bases of a dissonant, heavy, oppressive Metal which is translated on stage by a strong theatricality. 

Having played in Paris, Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon, Angers, Lille, Nice, Brest, Nancy, Tours, Rennes, MÃ©an, Poitiers, Toulouse or Marseille, BORGIA continues to propagate its Word urbi et orbi.

In July 2009 Fiery Path Records releases the split CD with YSENGRIN "Ars Magna Moriendi" inspired by biblical and alchemical thematics and mastered by Tore Stjerna in Necromorbus Studio (WATAIN, FUNERAL MIST, OFERMOD). 

â€œEcclesiaâ€ is the debut album of BORGIA which contains nine processional and conquering tracks propagating a spirit at the same time fanatic and decadent.
Mixing and mastering are done by Neb Xort in Drudenhaus Studio and Master Lab Studio (ANOREXIA NERVOSA, NECROBLASPHEME, ASMODEE).
The band signs with english vanguardist label Paradigms Recordings for a release 26th October 2009.
