   Pimp up your loops ! 
             
   The multi-band delay  machine FDELAY is  an exciting tool  for sound design 
   and loop manipulation in realtime. In contrast to the delay machines youre 
   used to FDELAY splits  the frequency spectrum of  the input signal into  27 
   bands and applies a separate delay  unit to each band. The delay  times can 
   be synchronized to the host tempo generating nearly infinite rhythmical and 
   sonic variations of the input signal. 
             
   For each of the delay bands you  can specify the delay time, the level  and 
   the  feedback  amount  separately.  These  parameter  changes  can  even be 
   automized in realtime for glitch free rhythmical morphings. 
             
   A few high level parameters let you change the delay times and feedbacks of 
   all delays with the turn of a single knob 
             
             
   Features: 
             
   The Rhythmiser 
             
   - 27 band realtime multiband delay. 
   - Frequency dependant level, delay time and feedback 
   - Linear phase precision filters for maximal transparency 
   - Tempo syncable delay times up to 6 seconds. 
   - Meta parameter for quick access to rhythm variations 
   - Minimized latency ( 12 ms )

   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5
   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
