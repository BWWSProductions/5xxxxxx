,uffesnuffe,2010-01-12T15:02Z,"Heartened by Jemar100's exultant comments above I downloaded this and opened it in DVDShrink: 208 MB of menues, 648 MB of extras and 1.62 GB for main movie video. That does not sound too great for 134 min of video, so I put in on a RW disc and tried it in my standalone Philips player. I enjoyed mandatory trailers for ""Terminator salvation"", ""The taking of Pelham123"" and ""2012"". Then I watched the warnings until after 10 minutes it was time for the main menu, where I could choose subtitle. With much anticipation I pressed ""Play movie"" and got lovely sound and a very good black screen. Nothing I could do would let me see picture. The menu button on the remote restarted the black-screen movie and that was all. The picture existed in DVDShrink so possibly it will work in other players with unknown video quality. This was the third ""Angels and demons"" download that I deleted: Two that did not work and one 2 CD avi of poor quality."

This torrent is solid gold!
For those in doubt and for those whose skills are a little rusty, here's the way to go: download, open DVD Shrink, click the Open Files button, point to storage location's VIDEO_TS folder, highlight it, then click OK button.

DVD Shrink will Analyze the content of the said folder, when finished click the Backup! button and from ""Select backup target"" choose ""ISO Image File"", next choose the ""Select target image file:"" to an HDD drive letter that has sufficient space, then press OK button.

Takes som 10 minutes on a faster system, to create the Image file,

When done, double-click on the Image file you just created, Nero will open automatically and display its Burn Compilation pane, tick ""Finalize CD (.."" option, ""Write speed at 12x.

Click the Burn button and enjoy the finished DVD.

All subs work, picture is good on an "

Uffesnuffe might have other problems with his PC that we don't know of, so we shouldn't put the blame on him.

What I aimed at was that if members need a bit of education, alll intentions and purposes are served. I just hope our help was of the good sort...

As said by both parties, this is a solid torrent!"
