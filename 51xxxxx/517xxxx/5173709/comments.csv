,raviraj87,2009-12-11T17:34Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). I have ""Left 4 Dead 2 - Razor1911"". But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!!"
