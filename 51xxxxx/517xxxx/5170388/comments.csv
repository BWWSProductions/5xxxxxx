,caixa,2010-02-26T18:58Z,"This heart warming tale follows the residents of the Retirement Home for Actors as they are awakened by the vitality and enthusiasm of actor and elderly gallant Jerzy (Jan Nowicki) and his ambitious plan to stage Goethe's Faust. It's a film about love, the passage of time, and actors ? their eccentricities and their dreams about appearing on the stage for one, albeit probably the last, time. Poland's greatest actors, all stars of ground-breaking films, returned to the screen for the fist feature film by documentary director Jacek Blawut."
