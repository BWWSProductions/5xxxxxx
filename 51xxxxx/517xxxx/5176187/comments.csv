,PCasey535,2009-11-24T11:41Z,"HolyRoses is correct, you cant just toss a a/v file on a dvd and play it in a DVD player. DVD players recognize .VOB, IFO and BUP file extensions. They must be in 1GB .VOB files in a very strict file structure, exception being many cheepy dvd players can play a DIVX codec AVI movie, the player will see a root dir. with an **.avi file, this is a data dvd. Visit this website - http://www.videohelp.com/ It has tutorials for thousands of different tasks involving A/V and links to any software you can think of. I made 100's of coasters trying to learn this stuff, it's simply growing pains to learn !!"

Is this by choice or was it simply not available? "
