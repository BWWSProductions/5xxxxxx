,Pwny,2010-07-03T09:25Z,"Yall niggas gettin trolled. This is an .exe while the real firmware is .IPSW.

I wouldnt double click this .exe if my dick were on fire and this was the only way to put it out.

AND from a nontrusted uploader? Shits sketchy guys...

beware..."
,Pwny,2010-07-03T09:27Z,"I partially retract my previous statement, this moron uploader decided to hide the .IPSW in a .EXE for no aparent reason other than to troll everyone into thinking it has h4xx hidden inside it."
,kklasen,2010-08-12T22:19Z,"@Pwny: Since your totally disabled and apparently dont use a AV on your comp, you can only make alot of false statements. If you dont like this torrent, stfu and dont comment."
