    XPlay expands what you can do with any iPod, including the iPhone     
    and touch, and a Windows computer. From copying music off your        
    iPod to copying photos on, XPlay fills in the holes giving you        
    more power to manage your music, photos and more.                     
                                                                          
    XPlay 3 has always given you direct access to your iPod, meaning      
    when you plug in your iPod it is listed as a drive on your system.    
    Now that power is added for iPhone and iPod touch users. There is     
    no application, no middle man to get in the way. Simply click on      
    your iPod and start organizing.                                       
                                                                          
    XPlay also believes in cross-platform harmony. XPlay includes         
    MacDrive technology enabling you to use both Mac and Windows          
    formatted iPods with any XP or Vista computer. You also get           
    management options. While XPlay is the perfect complement to          
    iTunes, XPlay also makes it possible to use your iPod with Windows    
    Media Player or Vista Media Center.

    1. Open up "Activate XPlay 3" either from the about dialog           
      inside the program or under the start menu.                        
    2. Select "I have a serial number and I'm ready to activate" then    
       hit next.                                                         
    3. Generate a serial and paste it into serial box, select "Show      
       other activation options" then hit next.                          
    4. Select "I don't have any Internet access" then hit next.          
      Note: You don't have to be offline to do this, it won't check.     
    5. Enter your computer id into keygen and hit activate.  Copy        
      activation code into program then hit next.                        
    6. ???                                                               
    7. Profit.                                                           
                                                                         
    One final note: the serial, computer id, and activation code are     
    all tied together.  Make sure the serial inside keygen matches the   
    one you're using to activate.

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
