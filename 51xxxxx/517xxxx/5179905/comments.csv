im rolling back to cios38r14  and neo gamma r7 and uninstalling your ios38-64-v3867.wad.
nice try but no thanks!"
,elma1337,2009-11-26T00:30Z,"why go back to neogamma r7 ? r8 works just fine with cios38rev14, even fixed some error bugs ;)"
,maxigawa,2009-11-26T00:39Z,"ok i havn't tried with rev 14---just on this guide it says to update to rev 15 which i did,and got the error.
did you install the ios38-64-v3867 also? or just the neogamma?with the old rev 14"
,elma1337,2009-11-26T00:39Z,"btw the 001 error is cause none of the neogamma loaders work with the new cios rev 15.

maybe they got a fix for it, dunnot know, but there are way better solutions to play NSMB"
,maxigawa,2009-11-26T00:45Z,"i can play mario bros easily  in  almost any loader its been scrubbed of the new protection-http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5173946/%5BWii%5DNew_Super_Mario_Brothers%5BNTSC%5D%5BFixed_to_work_with_disc_on_s
i was trying this new loader just out of interest.the game i got the error on was pro evo 2010.it works fine on neogamma r7 with rev 14"
,elma1337,2009-11-26T00:54Z,"can't remember I have installed that one. I think if you do a network install (wii connected to the internet) of the cios38rev14 it will be just fine.

I have the original NSMB disc which i run thru gecko 1.93 so don't know if the iso's floating around on the internet actually will work with neogamma whatsoever version. 

Just go to http://gbatemp.net if you need specific info on a specific game/wii firmware etc.

Best source around for wii in my opinion ;)"
,maxigawa,2009-11-26T00:58Z,"everyone just place the new neogamma wad in your wad folder on sd card,install the new wad from hbc .Do not install rev 15 or the ios38-64-v3867.wad.the dont work yet properly.
Then again most games work from the back up loader anyways lol ,happy gaming"
,wiinoma,2009-12-03T04:14Z,"I forgot about comments on this. Dont downgrade your NeoGamma because R8 beta17 enabled NSMBW patching internally and fixes booting errors.

I have been booting burned NSMBW for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly.
