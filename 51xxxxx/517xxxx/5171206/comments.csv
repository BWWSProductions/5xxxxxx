,sfaiku,2009-11-20T14:15Z,If these files are genuine I will experience the most intense schadenfreude of my life.
,saltad,2009-11-20T15:30Z,It appears to be genuine. Phil Jones at CRU has confirmed it. This is so exciting! :D
,Chjris,2009-11-20T18:59Z,"OMG!! This is amazing... they're all getting pissed off with it at Hadley, but we, the tax-payer, have paid for it all... it's only right that we should see it.

The BBC have written an article about it, but no mention of the content.

The best article I found was James Delingpole's blog at the Telegraph:
http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/

I'll be seeding this forever... or at least until Al Gore concedes defeat.

,d-tritus,2009-11-21T03:17Z,"bananusm,
Indeed. The ""Anthropogenic Global Warming"" cult is just as pseudo-scientific as the ""Intelligent Design"" cult. Cherry-picking details to form a picture that fits a pre-determined idea. It'd be laughable, if only they didn't have the ears of our dear politicians.

The funny/sad thing is that the AGW-cultists like to compare scientifically based scepticism to ID'ers!"
,oakwind1,2009-11-21T05:18Z,"Limbaugh lying again, Files do not show a ""secret liberal conspiracy""

If Limbaugh lies to you once, why continue listening?"

,joseph14,2009-11-22T05:31Z,"@bananusm
The Catholic church (especially the Pope) agree with evolution as more then just a hypothesis, or in other words as a theory which is certainly true. 

""Earlier this year, the Vatican also sponsored a conference on evolution to mark the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species.

The event snubbed proponents of alternative theories, like creationism and intelligent design, which see a higher being rather than the undirected process of natural selection behind the evolution of species.""

Please do not mix the Catholics up with all the young earth protestants."
