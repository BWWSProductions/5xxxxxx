Product Description:

Essential Rarities is a compilation album by The Doors, originally released as part of the boxed set The Complete Studio Recordings in 1999, but reissued in 2000 as a single CD, containing studio cuts, live cuts and demos.

Most of the tracks on this album have been officially released, or circulated as bootlegs prior to its release. The single CD release of the album includes Woman Is a Devil as a bonus track. The song is edited from the 1969 Elektra Studios Rock Is Dead sessions, and was not included in the box set version of the album.
