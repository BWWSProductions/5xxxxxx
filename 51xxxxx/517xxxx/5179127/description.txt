Plot:
Clint Eastwood stars as Walt Kowalski, a widower who holds
onto his prejudices despite the changes in his Michigan
neighborhood and the world around him. Kowalski is a grumpy,
tough-minded, unhappy old man, who can't get along with
either his kids or his neighbors, a Korean War veteran whose
prize possession is a 1972 Gran Torino he keeps in mint
condition. When his neighbor Tao, a young Hmong teenager
under pressure from his gang member cousin, tries to steal
his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets out to reform the youth.
Drawn against his will into the life of Tao's family,
Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them from the
gangs that infest their neighborhood.
