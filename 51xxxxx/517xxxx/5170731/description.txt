From Wiki:



Midnight Oil, known also as "The Oils" to fans, is an Australian rock band from Sydney originally performing as Farm from 1972 with drummer Rob Hirst, bass guitarist Andrew James and keyboard player/lead guitarist Jim Moginie.[1][2] While vocalist Peter Garrett was studying at Australian National University in Canberra,[1] he answered an advert for a spot in Farm,[3][4] and by 1975 the band was touring the east coast.[1] By late 1976, Garrett moved to Sydney to complete his law degree,[1][4] and Farm changed its name to Midnight Oil by drawing the name out of a hat.[5]

Important to their development was manager Gary Morris who was able to negotiate favourable contracts with tour promoters and record companies and frustrate rock journalists.[1][4] Guitarist Martin Rotsey joined in 1977[2] and Midnight Oil, with Morris, established their own record label Powderworks,[2] which released their debut eponymous album in November 1978, and their first single "Run by Night" followed in December.[1][4] Founding bass guitarist James, forced to leave due to illness in 1980, was replaced by Peter Gifford. Gifford was himself replaced by Bones Hillman in 1987.[1][2][4] Through a long and distinguished career, the band became known for its driving hard-rock sound, intense live performances and political activism, particularly in aid of anti-nuclear, environmentalist and indigenous causes.[6]

Midnight Oilâ€™s albums which peaked in the Australian Top Ten were 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Red Sails in the Sunset, Species Deceases, Diesel and Dust, Blue Sky Mining, Scream in Blue, Earth and Sun and Moon, Breathe, 20,000 Watt R.S.L., Redneck Wonderland, The Real Thing, Capricornia and Flat Chat.[7][8] Australian Top Ten singles were "Power and the Passion", "The Dead Heart", "Beds Are Burning" and "Blue Sky Mine".[7][8] Aside from chart success, both "Power and the Passion" and "Beds Are Burning" were listed by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in the Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001.[9] In December 2002, Garrett announced that he would seek to further his political career and Midnight Oil disbanded. But they would reform for two warm-up shows in Canberra leading up to their performance at one of the "Sound Relief" charity concerts, in honour of the victims of the "Black Saturday" fires and the "Queensland Floods".

Midnight Oil won eleven Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards during its career,[10] including induction into the Hall of Fame in 2006.[11][12] At the induction, ARIA chairman Denis Handlin described Midnight Oil as true legends that always led by example in a uniquely Australian way with music that is powerful, uncompromising, inspiring, entertaining and enduring.[5]

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 1982


10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 is an album by Midnight Oil that was released in 1982 under the Columbia Records label. The lengthy name is often pronounced "ten-to-one" or "ten-nine-eight" by fans.[citation needed] It is notable for staying on the Australian album charts for over 100 weeks.[citation needed] The album's closing track "Somebody's trying to tell me something" contains a note held by the group for what seems like an eternity, which would continue into the album's runout groove, and emulated on the CD version for just over 40 seconds. This is an approximation of a locked groove, a gimmick used a number of times on vinyl albums (such as Diamond Dogs and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) where the ending sound would continue into the runout groove, with which the sound would continue on until the turntable arm was lifted off, or the automatic return on some turntables would kick-in.

Red Sails in the Sunset  1984


Red Sails in the Sunset is an album by Midnight Oil that was released in 1984 under the Columbia Records label. This album was recorded and produced in Tokyo, Japan and is significant for becoming their first No. 1 album in Australia (it entered also the US Billboard 200). The cover image contains a striking depiction of Sydney Harbour after a hypothetical nuclear strike. This album contained tracks that were performed at their Sydney Harbour Goat Island concert in 1985 in tandem with Triple J celebrating the radio station's 10th birthday, which was simulcast on ABC Television and subsequently re-broadcast on their then-Tuesday night music program, Rock Arena. This footage later became part of Best of Both Worlds, released in 2004.

Diesel & Dust 1987

Diesel and Dust is an album by Midnight Oil that was released in 1987 under the CBS record label. The album is a concept album about the struggles of the Australian Aborigines and environmental causes, issues both near and dear to the band, and drew inspiration from the Black Fella White Fella tour of remote Indigenous communities with the Warumpi Band in 1985. The rhythm of "Beds are Burning" is said to be inspired by the noise of their vehicles' wheels on the corrugated dirt roads in the region.[citation needed]

The track "Gunbarrel Highway" was not included on the United States release of the album. Reportedly, it is because the line "shit falls like rain on a land that is brown" was deemed too strong for U.S. audiences.[1][2]

In 1989, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 13 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s.

Capricornia  2002


Capricornia is an album by Midnight Oil that was released in 2002 under the Sony Music label in Australia, and the Liquid 8 record label internationally. Capricornia was the band's last studio album before they disbanded in late 2002.


Writing and recording

On the two previous albums Breathe (1996) and Redneck Wonderland (1998), all tracks were credited Midnight Oil; on Capricornia the band returns to crediting individual contributors for each track, with Moginie dominating the list as is seen on most of their records.
After the hard rock/industrial electronic sounds of the previous album Redneck Wonderland, on this record Midnight Oil moved to a stripped back sound, with acoustic and clean electric guitars dominating the sound of the album (Golden Age, Luritja Way, Under the Overpass), although some tracks (Too Much Sunshine, Mosquito March, Poets and Slaves) feature significant distorted guitars. These latter tracks also feature distorted vocals. The album also features a short piano solo track (A Crocodile Cries) in the middle of the record, the melody of which is reprised for the album closing Poets and Slaves.
The album was produced, mixed and arranged by Warne Livesey, who also worked on Midnight Oil's seminal Diesel and Dust and Blue Sky Mining records. The bonus track Say Your Prayers, which appears on US versions of the album and was one of the four new tracks on The Real Thing, was produced by the band and Daniel Denholm.


Name and concept 

The name and concept of Capricornia was taken from the novel of the same name written by the Australian author Xavier Herbert. The name Capricornia refers to part of the Queensland coast and inland region around Rockhampton, which is close to the Tropic of Capricorn.


Release

The album was issued in a digipak case, first released in 2001; the U.S. release date was 19 February 2002.[1] By this time, the band had already began playing a few gigs in America. A callout label on the original US version sealed album correctly states there are 11 new tracks (Say Your Prayers was issued on The Real Thing not very long before, and does not appear on non-US versions of the album) and also states that the album contains "Golden Age" and "Too Much Sunshine," the initial singles. "Mosquito March," the third single, was not released at the time. Another single, Luritja Way, was issued at a later date. (picture of sealed CD)
A DTS version was released in 2002, still before the last two singles for the album.
The European edition contained two bonus tracks, a cover of "Pub with no beer" and "Kiss that Girl". The latter is the last all-new song the band released. To date, the European version of Capricornia remains the only official release to contain this song.
