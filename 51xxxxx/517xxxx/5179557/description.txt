      The nationwide search for The F Word's Best Local Restaurant
      continues as two Chinese restaurants go head to head: Chop Chop
      from Edinburgh and Sweet Mandarin from Manchester. Both
      restaurants prepare a three course meal under Gordon's watchful
      eye, including salt and pepper squid, pork dumplings, claypot
      chicken and banana fritters. Meanwhile, Gordon goes hunting for
      an amazing Chinese delicacy, mitten crab, in the river Thames.
