,andie44,2009-11-20T03:28Z,is this fake?
,andie44,2009-11-20T03:29Z,this is fake
,mtbm,2009-11-20T03:57Z,"Genuine. Not fake. Slow upload, sorry."
,mtbm,2009-11-20T04:06Z,"I've opened up some bandwidth, should help..."
,andie44,2009-11-20T04:56Z,"why is it so small, it's usually about 350MB. that's why i think it's fake."
,mistermetal,2009-11-20T07:35Z,"This isnt from eztv, which upload at 350mb, it is most likely a lower resolution.

Thanks for the upload been waiting for this."
,Wb34,2009-11-20T12:10Z,"stuck at 80% :(

pls seed "
,azitromax,2009-11-20T15:03Z,Thanx mtbm
,azitromax,2009-11-20T16:17Z,Extremely slow download...
,cheezewiz,2009-11-20T16:33Z,Its real but I'm stuck at 81% as well.  EZTV where are you :(
,FreakyBrit,2009-11-20T16:36Z,"It's sad when i'm uploading 10 times faster then i'm downloading this is getting silly now, mine's saying there's no seeders online"
,azitromax,2009-11-20T16:41Z,"81,8 % here now. Dowload speed 0,5 bytes - upload 88..."
,FreakyBrit,2009-11-20T16:49Z,Yep same here stuck at 81.8% for the last 45 minutes or so now
,Gamma Point,2009-11-20T17:37Z,"For those of you with large parts of the file, does it look real and of decent quality?"
,FreakyBrit,2009-11-20T17:46Z,I managed to watch the first 5 minutes and it appears real and of comparable quality to anything else you'd get out there
,azitromax,2009-11-20T17:48Z,"Gamma Point: It's real. The quality is not like EZTVs, but it's ok. I'm now at 83%."
,kamikazee706,2009-11-20T21:00Z,"Damn, I've been trying to download this for 2 days now. I'm stuck @ 90.1%. There is something suspicious with this torrent. "
,azitromax,2009-11-20T21:14Z,Kamikaze: I'm on 90.2 now. Been downloading for the last 5 hours. If you check out mtbms other torrent there is also some comment there about a peer killing the speed. 
,FreakyBrit,2009-11-20T21:50Z,90.6% getting closer slowly but surely
,xaximus,2009-11-21T01:23Z,Why the fuck is this episode so hard to find anywhere?
,CylonFrak,2009-11-21T01:50Z,"This episode is really upsetting me.  2 days and I've only managed 92.9%.  Why the frak is no one seeding this??

We don't have Bravo available where I live or I'd watch it there, but I can't.  People, please seed this when you finish downloading it!  Every time I see more than 2 seeds, they last for like 5 minutes and then disappear."
,CylonFrak,2009-11-21T01:53Z,"Normally by this time after an episode has aired, there are thousands of seeds.  So frustrating. :("
,andie44,2009-11-21T03:11Z,"i'm stuck at 92%, what is going on, mtbm?"
,Gamma Point,2009-11-21T04:47Z,"Ha, it took me less than 2 minutes to get up to 93%. I guess this is where the real wait begins....

It's almost funny. All of us and 1 seeder. Except for the fact that I want to watch it :("
,dickie05,2009-11-21T05:54Z,i wonder why this week's episode has been the only one in recent memory to drag on downloading like this. where's the dude who usually does top chef?
,CylonFrak,2009-11-21T06:12Z,"I really, really appreciate mtbm for uploading this torrent.  I don't know where the hell EZTV is with this week's episode, but it's driving me CRAZY!

I know it's rough trying to get all of this.  I'm stuck at 93.3% and have been for 2 hours, but I'm trying to be patient since I know it's not easy and no one has to upload these episodes for us.  So yes, I do really appreciate mtbm for uploading.

I'm just really wanting to see the episode really badly, and it's getting really frustrating waiting for that last 7% or so.

I saw 5 seeders on earlier, now there are two.  To all of you leeches out there who download it and sign off, all I can say is, ""Frak you!"""
,nedfrog,2009-11-21T06:13Z,"Oh man, single seeder you should burn this to a disk and mail it to somebody with a decent connection. Would be faster. "
,kamikazee706,2009-11-21T06:13Z,the file will actually play @ 93.3%. But it is kinda grainy and blurry though. Thanks...i guess.
,kakame,2009-11-21T07:32Z,"Oddly enough, this was a pretty speedy download despite the lone seeder. But I suggest downloading at your own risk, or better yet - wait for the eztv release to come out.

The footage is really choppy, lags quite a lot and tends to skip certain parts. :/"
,Wb34,2009-11-21T09:05Z,"Dang it stuck at 93.3%, had a peek at video looks okay, but its weird that no one seems to have finished downloading it completely, been waiting for ages for it to finish!!!"
,azitromax,2009-11-21T09:29Z,"For fucks sake!!! Benn dl'ing this shit since yesterday. 93.5% now. I agree with nedfrog: you should burn this to a disk and mail it to somebody with a decent connection...
Remember to fucking seed this after downloading. Don't hit and run. Cunts."

,azitromax,2009-11-21T10:31Z,Download the one from Isohunt. So you don't have to wait forever..
,Wb34,2009-11-21T10:57Z,"F---it m just gonna watch at 93.5%, using vlc player!!!! it'll skip the parts not downloaded but f-it, cant keep waiting for this damn downlaod. plus it's only 6.5% missing so still sorta watchable"
,hamtard0,2009-11-21T12:40Z,"Either mtbm is fucking with people or someone is poisoning this torrent.  This problem seems to be a recurring theme with mtbm's uploads, so it's probably a bit of both.

Either way, it seems like this torrent is being intentionally fucked with, so you might as well ditch it and look elsewhere."
,Deeptooth,2009-11-21T12:46Z,"Looks to me like mtbm has things to learn about seeding...

I can give you one pointer in the form of a wish: Please start doing it."
,CylonFrak,2009-11-21T19:31Z,"Someone actually uploaded a copy of this and SEEDED it, so there are currently 80 seeds.  I'm abandoning this BS and just getting the new one.  I can't believe I have to abandon at fucking 93.5% and start a new download.  (PISSED)

Just search for ""Top Chef 6x13"" or ""Top Chef Culinary"" and you'll find a couple with actual seeds.  :-/"
