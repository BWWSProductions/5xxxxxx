TITLE : Hard
ARTIST : Rihanna
ALBUM : Rated R
COVERART : Included
YEAR : 2009



"Hard" is a song performed by singer Rihanna and features rapper, Young Jeezy. Written and produced by The-Dream, the track was co-produced with Tricky Stewart. It is the second official single from Rihanna's fourth studio album Rated R.



The song leaked online on November 2, 2009. It was originally thought that "Wait Your Turn" was going to be the second single from the album, but it was revealed by Ryan Seacrest that "Wait Your Turn" was only a promo single for Rated R and "Hard" would be the second official single. The track has an abrasive party beat, and Rihanna and guest Young Jeezy aren't shy about discussing their elite status. The producer of the song, The-Dream, said: "'Hard', I want that song to explain itself. Most of the stuff I wrote â€” still to this day what I write â€” I try to find out through people what they're going through or what they gotta say. Then we put that in."
