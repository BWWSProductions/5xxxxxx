,zalmancooled,2009-11-29T07:42Z,same problem skips like a heard of fruitcakes every 10-20 seconds on win 7 64 must be related to HID utilizing a 360 controller
,zalmancooled,2009-11-29T08:51Z,NVM Problem Fixed by disabling unused HID devices and actually changed out to a ps2 keyboard skipping is gone now so dl is great game is working fine it was a user ID.10-T error :)
,4LexMiguel,2009-12-03T11:58Z,"Release works 100% , u need to disable HID like zalmancooled mentioned to avoid choppy render . 
Appart from that , game sucks , waste of time to dl not to mention a serious crime if ur planning to pay 50 bucks for it . Its prolly 1 of the worst games i ever installed on my pc and i test all of them , good or bad . "
,_UndeadlyVamp,2011-09-29T19:43Z,How to disable HID? And what is HID?
