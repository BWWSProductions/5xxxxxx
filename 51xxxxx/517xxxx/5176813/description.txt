Note: During the conversion process, I noticed that there were black bars both vertically and horizontally. I was paying more attention to the actual video output aspect rather then the ipod video aspect so when viewing on the ipod you will notice these bars but i doubt they are much of a problem at all. This should fit perfectly on a TV screen though!
