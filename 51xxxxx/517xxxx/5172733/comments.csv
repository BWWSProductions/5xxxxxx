,fictionalMe,2010-09-23T00:24Z,Just wondering... Will this patch still allow for multiplayer access? I know they normally don't bt still hoping =]
,Yatar,2010-12-29T11:25Z,"I'm unable to overwrite the Neverwinter Nights 2.app. 
Yes I did opened and navigated to the unix-exe stuff. 
It is a problem with the file permission, as suggested in the .txt intructions file. 

Trouble is, I know how to check file permission, but I need someone to tell me how to change them. 
Please, help 

ps; using OS X 10.5.8 "
,Yatar,2011-01-08T17:50Z,"Figured it out. 

Works great. 
Thank's a lot !

,5TAR5,2011-03-08T04:26Z,"Sorry, you drag the nwn app into the sitx file? Does not seem to be possible. I downloaded the game and the patch, but now no matter how many things I move around, I am still getting the DVD message. Please help."
,5TAR5,2011-03-08T04:57Z,"Alright, so I realized that the sitx file is a Stuff It file and thus requires that specific software to open (Inconvenient! I figured I'd be good with my Zipeg, but no. Grr!). At any rate, I downloaded the software, and obviously was able to expand the sitx file as such. It launched and the game looks gorgeous. Not sure if it's buggy yet or not, but my resulting headache wont allow for further exploration at this time. Thank you for the patch."
,mbrz,2011-11-22T17:44Z,"there's no .app file in any of the sitx files i downloaded only a unix executable file... also, opening the package contents of the no dvd patch, there's only Contents/MaxOS X files, and that contains another unix executable file called iPatcher. so what do i exchange exactly? i've been trying for hours now. please help :("
