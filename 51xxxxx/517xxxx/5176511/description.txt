    Have you ever heard of Tittles? They dwell in a special fluid         
    called Ooze B-50 and offer a great time of pure fun. Three            
    different game modes are waiting for you. CHAIN REACTION              
    Meet Blasties with a very sensitive, unbalanced system which makes    
    them explode if they hit anything in the fluid. Your job here is to   
    create a chain of subsequent explosions in order to reach a given     
    popping percentage indicated in the top-left corner of the screen.    
    CRITICAL MASS Meet Floaties, who attract each other very strongly.    
    When two of these species get too close to each other, they will      
    merge into a bigger, mutated entity. COLLECTOR Some Floaties are      
    just too lazy to attract each other and merge. They don't feel the    
    urge to team up and become a bigger and stronger entity. So you       
    have the chance to play with them and collect them into crates.
