I'm only 20 so I didn't grow up with him or anything, but a friend of mine liked his stuff, so one day I listened to a few songs on Spotify, and ran into this album randomly. It's such an amazing album. Not all of these songs are hits (Don't let him steal your heart away) so they're hard to find, so to find this album on FLAC with a few seeders is amazing. Thank you so much. I'll seed this several times over for others. "
