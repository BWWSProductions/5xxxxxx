I lent my CD of Conversations to the Unseen to a friend and never saw it back, now that I have a new copy here it is for anyone who made the same mistake as me!

Some good Jazz/Hip Hop from British saxophonist Soweto Kinch, blends the genres better than Guru, and otheres who've attempted it with limited success.

Highlights for me are'Good Nyooz' and 'The Mission' and 'Jazz Planet', among others.

Enjoy
