     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Winter's on the way as we return to River Cottage for an
      array of seasonal treats. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall loves his
      garden and all that grows in it; but he's not the only one.
      Hungry rabbits have surrounded River Cottage and Hugh has
      concrete evidence that they are decimating his winter veg.
      Needing expert advice, he brings in rabbit warreners Ted and
      Derek to help him manage the invasion. Hugh and his children
      raid Devon's rocky coves with French teacher Nathalie Arnold and
      her family looking for wild mussels. Nathalie has something up
      her sleeve that Hugh desperately wants: the French know-how of a
      spectacular and firey mussel feast known as a mussel eclade.
      It's becoming commonplace to find wines that are grown and made
      under the English sun, but Hugh joins a man who makes wine in
      his back yard in London. Hugh and wine maker Marko Bojcun think
      last year's vintage is very drinkable, but will a discerning
      British public agree?
