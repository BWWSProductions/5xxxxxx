In the beginning of the movie it says ""DTHEATER"" and after that ""this video casette.... so I suppose DT means DTHEATHER in the world of raymondhome (probably few others..).

Wikipedia say Dtheater (or ""D-VHS"") was introduced in 1998, and is actually capable of digital HD content (720p and 1080i)! After 2004 it's been replaced by Blu-Ray."
,abban009,2010-01-05T20:09Z,can nebody post the screenshots???or comment bout the video and audio???
,ChancerBR,2010-04-11T23:11Z,"Video: XVID 704x288
Audio: AC3 5.1 @ 576 kbps, 48 kHz.
It's better then the other DVDRip available, and audio is 5.1, but the file is much larger. I don't know if it's worth."
