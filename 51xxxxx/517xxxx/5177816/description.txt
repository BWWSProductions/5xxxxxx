    There is a very dangerous criminal on the loose. This criminal is     
    hiding out, disguised in a crowd of innocent people. Don't let him    
    get away, and don't hit the innocent! Your mission is simple, find    
    your target in a crowd, scroll around with your finger. Then zoom     
    in and shoot! (Keep in mind that there is a distance delay from       
    when you shoot and hit your target.) If you miss, your reward will    
    decrease. And if you hit an innocent person, you will be penalized.   
    As the levels progress, the difficulty increases, the crowds get      
    thicker, bigger, faster and there are more obstacles. FEATURES: -
