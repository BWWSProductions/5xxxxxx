due to comments made regarding my tech-savilessness I am amending my description as follows:
This is a real copy of the movie (I do not mean to brag but I am far too simple minded to figure out how to imbed viruses and/or malware into a file)
I loved this movie when I was a child.  I looked for this file for some time with no avail.  I was flirting with a co-worker who works in the IT department and she gave me this copy.  She came over to help with a new computer and show me how to use all these tools as far as downloading and she showed me how to upload and I figured this would be my little contribution to the internet.  I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.
