We're not likely to visit just cause you beg and plead. We're more likely when we see that you offer ""Good Stuff""! Thus, doing things like providing [b]Decent[/b] Descriptions count for a [b]LOT!!![/b]

Now, WTF does ""AIIR Consulting LLC Office Harmony v1.1.1"" [b]do?[/b]

[quote]Office Harmony is a stress-reduction app that will breathe new life and relaxation into your hectic workday. Office Harmony provides three major stress reduction tools: yoga, meditation, and a stress test.

Office Yoga:
The first tool consists of short exercise videos that guide you through your workday. Start your morning with a seated sun salutation, take a mid-day break to restore blood flow to your legs, and rebalance yourself at the end of the day with a relaxing breathing exercise. Our videos focus on specific body areas placed under stress during the workday, and allow the user to perform the exercise within the confines of a small office space.

Mindfulness Meditation:
The second tool relaxes the mind with four guided meditation exercises. Whether you are having difficulties balancing work and life or you just need some serious relaxation, listen to a 5-minute audio clip that will leave you feeling stress-free and confident in yourself and your abilities.

Stress Assessment:
The last tool is a 20-question stress assessment that allows you to achieve insight and awareness about your current stress level, and what area in your life is most stressful to you.

Features:
*Video and Audio will function regardless of internet or WIFI connection.
*This app offers high-quality, professionally filmed exercises, as opposed to flipping cards or watching low-resolution homemade videos.
*Exercises and meditations are short and user friendly. They can be done in office attire on a 5-minute break and the iPhone does not need to be held or touched to proceed with the exercise or meditation.
*6 unique yoga exercise videos.
*4 guided meditations accompanied by soothing music.
*20 question research-based stress assessment providing both an overall stress score and scores across four major stress areas. Test will save information if the user wishes to finish the test at a later time or if test is interrupted with a phone call.
*Home Screen that utilizes twitter to notify user of tips, updates, and new exercises or meditations
