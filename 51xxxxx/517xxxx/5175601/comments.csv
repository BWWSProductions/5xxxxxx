,onemoresolo1,2009-12-23T15:14Z,"Excellent upload thanks :) Picture quality is superb considering the file size. My only problem is that every few frames the pictures stutters, it's really noticable on panning shots. Is that the file or my playback, and is there a way to minimise or remove that? Other than that it's flawless, thanks again!"
