Liliana Herrero is an Argentine musician born in 1948 in Villaguay, province of Entre Rios. In 1966 she moved to Rosario, Santa Fe, in order to study Philosophy, and has since become an adoptive citizen. In her youth she took part in the vocal groups Contracanto and Canto Libre.

In Rosario she met the local singer and composer Fito Paez, who convinced her of abandoning her teaching career and become a professional singer.
