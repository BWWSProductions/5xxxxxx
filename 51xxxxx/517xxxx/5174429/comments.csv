Thank you for downloading, comment and seed, please! We need you!"
,Rhubarm,2009-11-22T10:21Z,Thx man i love this game and i cant wait to get this downloaded ^^
,easybtn,2009-11-22T11:16Z,"It also comes pre-fitted with some gamepad controls, so it's fairly easy to map to a console controller if you've got one connected.

I found it to be really easy to map my PS3 controller.

I did find one error and one slightly unfortunate aspect of the game. The error is you can't change the hue/saturation/vibrance of objects in the create-a-skater mode. The unfortunate part is it won't load the world past a few hundred feet around you, aka you can't see very far."

,Rhubarm,2009-11-23T16:05Z,meh doesnt work for me it just crashes when i start it BUT i dont have that framework thing does that matter?
,easybtn,2009-11-23T18:24Z,"I haven't tried the game without the framework in place, but I'd imagine it has something to do with it on Intel-based macs. The game was built expressly for PPC, and I've heard from many accounts that copying the framework over is necessary."
,easybtn,2009-11-23T18:38Z,"I can confirm that on Intel (10.6), the game will not load without the LaunchServices framework in place."
,killerzip,2009-11-25T00:03Z,Couldn't get it to work. did all of the instructions and it quit t the moment it would usually display the game menu.
,easybtn,2009-11-26T02:05Z,"System specs?

The only time I've noticed that it refuses to open is if the LaunchServices framework isn't present. Make sure the 'Play (CD2)' disk is mounted."
,killerzip,2009-11-26T19:22Z,"An iMac Intel 2.4GHz with a ATI 2400 HD. 10.6.2 and I mounted the disc with toast. I recently sold my original copy of the game, which I could never get to work even with the fix."
,easybtn,2009-11-27T22:15Z,Did you install the patch as well? It wouldn't launch for me until I had the .app replaced.
,tomclap,2009-12-02T12:17Z,same here followed all the instructions works fine but then crashes at the where the game menu should be after all the into vids n stuff
,BPirates,2009-12-02T22:21Z,"Highly annoyed! Opened it up, followed instructions to install it and when I start to install, it says after seconds ""The Item Save cannot be found. Installation cannot continue."" Help!"
,TheRuns,2009-12-05T04:59Z,"Can you just mount the disk 2 using OS X disk mount? Or do you need Toast Titanium? It won't let me play even though I have it mounted using the OS X....

Help!"
,dccdanchalmes,2009-12-08T05:36Z,"downloaded, seeded, works fine. Near perfect accept for alot of fade ins"
,SethAbel,2009-12-10T16:45Z,"Good day, much appreciation for the upload, however I am experiencing the same problem multiple users are. Showing the contents of the THPS 4 application, one can see the game is not supported on this architecture.

Is there no work around ? and why does it work on some yet not others ?

- Peace.

(Using 10.5.6)"

,eginitarasiloveme,2009-12-13T16:57Z,"Nice Upload man.I do exactly that you say and very good install BUT... When I am trying to play.when the trailer ends and it is loading when the loading finish close the game and it says

Mac Os Xand other application are not affected
What Can I DO?????????????????????????????
PLEASE HELP"
,easybtn,2009-12-15T04:52Z,"I'm not sure what the problem is. I test fine on Snow Leopard but I haven't personally tested this on Leopard. I can't imagine the process would be much different.

Yes, you need Toast to mount the CD to play the game, otherwise the computer recognizes it as an image not a CD. I used to get this problem as well. Try editing the splash-screen settings.

Does anyone have it working on 10.5 or lower? Please let us know."
,bafou,2009-12-19T11:00Z,Same problem as SethAbel and eginitarasiloveme for me ! i use 10.5.6
,dlquinte,2009-12-19T13:10Z,"I did everything as described, but when I want to open the game I get the message that THPS4 quit unexpectedly. When I click reopen it's just the same message that keeps on coming...

Who can help me?"
,yebopilot,2009-12-20T13:44Z,"hi i have the same problem as diquinte. I did everything as described and can open the settings window but as soon as i press play it quits itself..

help pls"
,easybtn,2009-12-24T01:14Z,"Honestly the port is a little fidgety. Try fiddling with the resolution and settings. I'm not sure what issues may exist for Leopard and Tiger users, but I would assume it can be attributed to that.

If you haven't done the frameworks step yet either, that would definitely be a cause of it not working."
,yebopilot,2009-12-24T17:58Z,i've done all that and it still isn't working -.-
,dlquinte,2009-12-25T12:33Z,"I just did it all over again, but now there is no folder with that name in my library (> frameworks)! So I can't copy it...

(snow leopard 10.6.2)"
,easybtn,2009-12-27T03:27Z,"Did you go to the /Library or /Users/you/Library? It's in the root library, not yours."
,corruptop,2009-12-27T15:16Z,"Hey easybtn,

I'm new to this discussion. I got the game finally working with the patch folder and Toast.
It gives me the intro movies, after that the loading.
When it's done loading it shuts off and says :

Mac Os X and other applications are not affected


I tried resolution changes, CD changes n' other stuff.... Don't work
Any tips ? Anybody ?

Using Mac OS X v.10.5.4

Thanks"
,easybtn,2009-12-27T23:13Z,"As I've said before, I'm not sure if there are running errors on Leopard/Tiger.

Just make sure you've installed the launch frameworks and the patch. It could be an issue with the patch itself, in which case Google the following: ""thps4 1.0.2 patch mac""

This is a fairly unstable port to begin with, and it's obvious that Aspyr/Activision didn't spend a lot of time fixing bugs or ensuring basic functionality was present."
,dlquinte,2009-12-28T18:48Z,"Nope! I was checking the right library!
Very strange..."
,dlquinte,2009-12-28T19:00Z,"Okay, i did it all over again. And now i found the folder and followed all the steps. So I click to open THPS4 and I see the options window, next I did was clicking 'Play' and it shuts down. I got no error messages or something, it just quits itself... 
Could this be a problem concerning the patch you were talking about?

grts"
,corruptop,2009-12-30T14:45Z,"Nope, sorry. Maybe it's something with the color or sound settings... I couldn't play THPS2 because my Mac couldn't change to 16bit..."
,Ckecker67,2010-01-12T21:50Z,"I can't unzip the file Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4-1.zip. Why? I don't know. Plz help me. It doesn't works with stuffitExpander, The Unarchiver and The Archiverapp from Snow lepard"
,Ckecker67,2010-01-13T21:31Z,"ah, o.k. it works. But when, I will play the game, The programm said: You need the THPS4 Play Disc in your CD-ROM drive to play this game. Please insert it and try again.

What can i Do? Pls help me"
,dlquinte,2010-01-13T22:10Z,"Before you click to open, you have to mount the CD2 (play disc) with toast."
,Ckecker67,2010-01-13T22:48Z,"mount, is that burn?"
,easybtn,2010-01-24T12:44Z,"If you have Toast Titanium installed with Finder menus, just press right-click the file and click ""Mount It"". Otherwise, open Toast and mount it. It essentially makes the computer think it's an actual CD."
,kaspar004,2010-02-23T17:22Z,"Hi,

it says by me:

The serial number you entered is not valid......

i tried many times..!!!! What to do....????"
,lamplover,2010-03-03T04:36Z,I've tried several methods and exhausted all other methodologies that i know have worked with other torrents. I've tried tweaking the splash screen as well as the menu to no avail. Thanks anyways uploader. If i want to skate i guess i just got to grab deck and face the outside world lol
,maxyboy1,2010-03-08T19:12Z,Just enter a real name that's worked for me.....

,xnajkn,2010-03-30T11:34Z,"@kaspar004 , there are no spaces at all, no spaces means 0 spaces, it will work after that, however the game doesn't work."
,xnajkn,2010-03-30T11:51Z,Don't waste your time....
,xnajkn,2010-03-30T16:14Z,This shit is not working.
,easybtn,2010-04-09T08:59Z,"Wow, sorry it took me so long to get to all the new comments.

@ romeeo23, Ckecker

Unfortunately, you will have to mount the 'Play' image every time you want to play the game. Don't trash it!

@ xnajkn

Hey, thanks for the stream of comments! I love it when people try to sabotage the internet through spam!"
,Nazis,2010-04-26T17:39Z,Works on 10.6.3. No problems till now! Thanks!

,ewhuff,2010-08-01T23:12Z,I have done everything explained in the Read me file. However when i start the game I get the video sequences then when it gets to the load screen before the menu the loading bar completes then crashes. Anyone know what the problem is?
,JDenverL,2010-09-01T08:49Z,Same issue as ewhuff.  Anyone have a solution?
,alphabox,2011-03-01T13:47Z,Can someone upload the patch only plz?
,easybtn,2011-03-24T09:46Z,There's no such thing as just downloading the patch files.
,jackfrerer,2011-04-21T07:29Z,i have mounted cd2 with mount me! but it still tells me to insert the cd when i try to play........do i really need to buy toast?
,rainierrr,2011-07-13T22:53Z,dsfasd
,rainierrr,2011-07-13T22:55Z,"Wow... finally I made it work on 10.6.8
Just followed the instructions about copying the launchservices folder.
I dont know why the patch wasn't in the torrent, so I had to download it myself. You can get it in here t w e dot l y diagonal Y g o b ...... you need to mount the bins with toaster, so when is mounted you see a CD icon instead of a white drive ( like when you mount images with osx ) that will fix your problems about the CD Check..  Hope it helps and sorry for by bad english."
