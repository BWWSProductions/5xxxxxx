           A gritty MMA fighter is forced into a twisted,                 
           underground gambling ring in which he must fight to the        
           death with other MMA fighters in order to save his wife        
           from certain death at the hands of a maniacal crime boss.      
           In a desperate race against time, he is forced into a          
           series of increasingly violent life and death matches          
           while simultaneously piecing together the puzzle which         
           leads him to uncover the identity of the promoter and the      
           ultimate showdown, in which there can only be one Death        
           Warrior.
