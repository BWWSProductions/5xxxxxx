,drastic77,2009-12-18T02:48Z,your welcome darin and to big i have season 4 but its tv rips but if you want i can through them in iso format if you would like
,kekamba,2010-02-14T22:09Z,why would you want to have a 40min episode in a 3.5GB iso file ? i thought this would be a full movie but its just a double lengt episode... for 3.5 giga fu*king bytes....
,drastic77,2010-03-26T22:56Z,The move is a double episode do your research its a retail copy that i ripped to dvdr i guess i could of took out all the extras and just did the movie in avi but i rather have the full dvd
