,dude0014,2009-11-29T22:51Z,"0. Connect Garmin Unit to Computer

1. Install map using CNMENT2010Update_ENU.msi
(which is in the IMG folder)

2.This automatically installs mapsource for you.

3. Open up Mapsource (in the program list) and in the Map Product Manager, click on the ""Unlock Regions"" tab and enter the Unlock code you get from step 5,6 & 7.

4. Generate the Map IMG to the GPS by opening up ""MapInstall"" in your Start Menu (Download n install from Garmin website if u dont have it). During this highlight or select the entire middle east region and then click next.

5. Get your Garmin GPS 10 digit unit ID number by going into the Garmin folder on th GPS device and you will see a file called GarminDevice.xml, open it with ""wordpad"" and you will see a 10 digit number right in the first few lines of code.

6. Open the Garmin Unlocker 1.5 keygen you downloaded (goog1e search if u dont have it), then copy and paste your 10 digit unit ID number (step 5) into the first field. Then where it says ""Select Map Product,"" go to ""Custom Mapset"" and enter ""2009""

7. There are two ""Generate"" buttons, click the bottom ""Generate"" button to get your map unlock code, you do not want to click the top generate button because that generates a software unlock code, which you do not need.

8. Copy the map unlock code to your clipboard, then create a new text file on your desktop (Right click on desktop> new> text document) and paste the code into it, now save the text file name as ""gmapsupp.unl"" After you save it using that extension, you should not be able to open it anymore since it's no longer a text file.

9. Copy and paste this GMAPSUPP.UNL file alongside the GMAPSUPP.IMG that the MapInstall already put in the Garmin directory of your unit.

10. Disconnect your garmin Unit and and browse to your map information on your Garmin GPS unit and you should see the new maps selected. Tools>Settings>Map>Map Info."

,tdwg98,2009-12-22T14:08Z,"Can I install it on: Garmin nç«¯vi 855 ?

My friend told me the 855 will not except the cr@cked maps !"
,cutback50,2010-06-11T21:42Z,"It didn't work - In Mapsource Map Product Manager under 'Unlock Regions' tab, the map is not listed even after installing it.  It's only listed under the 'Map Product Info' tab, in which case there is only an 'Unlock Online' Button."
