,kacique,2009-11-27T07:55Z,"Here's the fix.  Diconnect from Internet. Install software, go2 C:\Program Files and run file ending guard3.exe This will open it, disable auto update and everything that connects 2internet. enter serial listed as part of download. ALWAYS RUN the...guard.exe, not the vdj.exe. Enable internet.  I've run since initial upload w no probs."
,Ddog89,2009-11-28T05:24Z,"Quick note to all, apparently the guard.exe no longer works.  you will get the protection error.  a permanent fix for vista/7 users is to block the incoming AND outgoing connections for both the guard.exe and vdj.exe in windows firewall.  You can create a rule to block both of these.  anyone needing help send me a messgae darius_suddreth@yahoo.com"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-29T02:51Z,"People just need to learn to how to block unwanted internet traffic by using eg. a firewall (set traffic to manually controlled).

For example: VDJ will try to connect to the homeserver anyway when running it the first time. As far as I know virtualdj.exe is the only file which tries to connect to the homeserver (there's no update.exe or such in the install dir).

So just unchecking the auto-update option of VDJ is not the only thing that needs attention."

Protection Error 16 - Fix
===================

Found this solution on net. Has worked for me so far. Try it if u wish.

Remove The registry entry--

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\VxD

-----------------------------

(((Complete Steps)))

Uninstall Virtual DJ

1- Delete C:/Program Files/VirtualDJ
2- Delete ""C:/Documents and Settings/*Owner* /My Documents/VirtualDJ
-3 Delete all other VirtualDJ folders

- Delete these Registry Keys :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VirtualDJ
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VirtualDJ

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\VxD

If it works for you as well....spread the word. :-)


One more thing.
~ Before installation - disconnect.
~ After installation prevent VDJ from accessing the internet using firewall."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-12-14T06:32Z,"@zdude123

On my XP there's no  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\VxD

When searching for VXD in the registry there's a ""vxdfile"" at: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.386

However, it's not sure that HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.386 is related to Virtual DJ."
,huacas,2009-12-14T17:40Z,thx...

,lucianidol,2009-12-22T06:24Z,"After hours of installing and uninstalling i finally get the solution!

(((Complete Steps)))

Uninstall Virtual DJ

1- Delete C:/Program Files/VirtualDJ
2- Delete ""C:/Documents and Settings/*Owner* /My Documents/VirtualDJ
-3 MAKE SURE U SEARCH AND Delete all other VirtualDJ folders!!!!!!

- Delete these Registry Keys :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VirtualDJ
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VirtualDJ

download and install http://www.comodo.com/home/internet-security/firewall.php its free!!!!

after installing Comodo firrewall disconnect from the internet, install virtual dj and lunch put in serial # found in (info file).

After programe starts go to Config then option and disable auto update! then close programe.

now go to Start / all programes / virtual dj and delete (www.virtualdj.com) link/file

now that Virtual dj programe is all set. you need to configure Comodo firewall.

on taskbar double click on Comodo firewall then on the top menu click (firewall), 
on left side of window click (Common task),
then click on (Define a new Blocked Application) click select then browse, look in C:drive/programe files/virtual Dj/virtualdj.exe the click open then apply! close Comodo firewall window and connect to the internet!!

Should work like a charm..... gud luck!"

Does anyone have a keygen that works? I can't seem to get an acceptable key to get past the serial after install.

Did this -

Hi all!
I had the ""Protection error 16."" after some tries, eg. by an earlier comment.
I've had a rough combat with this, but finally, one registry entry is the problem of error 16.
Delete this one too:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\VxD
Thanks god, it works fine now.

ps. you can open the Registry Editor with the Start->Run cmd command

Good luck!
---thanks Conoyes.

Now, that solved 24 + 16 but now i get ""protection error"" 8. Marvelous.

Solution?

It ""is"" a tricky one, you have to go out of your way to make sure this does not connect to the internet!

Besides that point, what is interesting is that it loves my old config files ha ha. It even opened up in widescreen with beatgrid on the effects pedal.

I digress. After a small amount of fucking around, mostly (i think) due to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5435720/Atomix_Virtual_DJ_v6.0.7_Professional___Crack_%5BRH not having as many seeds, i have it working marvelously.

,newsletter,2010-09-18T20:02Z,"For those who are seeing the error. This is because VDJ is communicating with their servers. This is a fairly new feature in v6.

If you are going to control panel and then to system and security, and accessing ""Allow a program through windows firewall"", creating a rule and disallow it, this will not work because VDJ will replicate and new rules will be constantly created so this is useless.

What you need to do is go to:
Control Panel> System and Security > Administrative Tools in Win 7 and otherwise in other windows versions.
The go to ""Windows Firewall with Advanced Security"" and create a new rule which will BLOCK traffic from VDJ.exe and enable it.
This has worked for me for years now.

Do it it works."
