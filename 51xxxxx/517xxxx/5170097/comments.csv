[V],Murlok,2009-11-19T18:25Z,jersson  waiting you answer since I tested on old version kept my setting and worked like a charm no reg nothing so I do hope this not end up as another 30 days and thats it.WE will see :)
,Hanto1952,2009-11-22T05:16Z,"@Loopmaster F.Y.I.  Over the 16+ years that I have been testing x86 software, I have found that the harder the security is to break, the more likely the result will be a crash and burn of the entire system. Witness the various Norton security schemes of the past decade. The more software that is included in a software package to prevent so-called illegal use is generally the cause of these system wide crash and burns. 
  Since I am a defragmentation fanatic, I intend to try this new software just so I can say that I have, but that doesn't mean that I will be impressed because in the past I have never been impressed by Diskeeper.
  What bothered me about your comment above was the idea that the softwares that engage in EXTRA security measures are superior BY THAT NATURE to softwares that do not engage in extra security measures. That is like believing that dinosaurs with their huge size and other attributes would live the remainder of earth's lifetime. 
  My observations are that most often, it is the free softwares that in the end, do the job much better and with far less corruption. I am not impressed by bells and whistles, nor makeup and eye shadow. 
  Murlock, keep up the good work with presenting these softwares for testing and evaluation..."
,swashbukkle,2009-11-22T20:44Z,"@Loopmasters - your comments are ""strange"" to say the least. 
How can you judge overall  performance, usability etc of software, from the way that it is protected. 
Take for instance the overly engineered ""Advanced uninstaller PRO"" compared to the free Revo.
A/V is another good example - Norton = harder to crack, but really really bad. 
ESET = Easy to crack, but loads better!
Anyway, back to DK2010 - Thanks uploader, but I will wait for a crack that works past the 30 days. "
[V],Murlok,2009-11-24T15:18Z,Hanto1952  thx for comment I and others always got some shit as uploaders But who forced them to download anyway its free.The advanced to change date Lol you only have to block it from calling home.That shows you are noob Loopmasters and its not advanced to change the clock:P
,Hanto1952,2009-11-26T07:39Z,"  Thank you Murlok for your kind response. I just located a site during my investigations that might prove beneficial to others who desire quality defragmentation or at least knowledge of the various softwares that say they accomplish the same. 
  By the way, I tried the Diskeeper 14, and was not impressed, but you will see that others feel the same when you read the following article about the DEFRAG SHOOTOUT at http://donnedwards.openaccess.co.za/2007/06/great-defrag-shootout-all.html   .. I hope everyone has an stomach filling Thanksgiving. "
,kenshinrk,2009-11-29T11:29Z,"i still like diskeeper a lot more than perfectDisk. they basically perform the same thing:defrag; however i like how fast DK works and its interface - it shows me a lot of things as regards my HDD with just a few mouse clicks. i'm not really sure which one among those in the class is the best coz i'v only used DK and PD so far. anyways, all of defrag companies are claiming that their product is the best; hmmm, of course it is.

,Brian_Le-Swanker,2009-11-30T15:52Z,This does not work...nice virus though LOL
,Brian_Le-Swanker,2009-12-01T17:46Z,"media junk blogspot does not exist'''''

,jersson,2009-12-02T01:38Z,"Is,nt it possible to make DK pre-cracked cause that would solve all problems with it. Jus install and that's it"
,ex_pat3,2009-12-08T00:30Z,"Hanto, thanks for your efforts and comments."
,mmsandi,2009-12-13T11:49Z,"@swashbukkle
