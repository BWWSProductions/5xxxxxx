  In Man on a Leash, Eric Romstead learns his father has been murdered--shot execution-style and dumped in a Nevada landfill. The police aren't very motivated to search for the killers, believing that they were out-of-towners who have already left the state. So Eric begins his own investigation, eventually leading him to an extended struggle with a diabolical electronics geek.
