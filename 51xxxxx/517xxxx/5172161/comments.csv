,StanSmith,2009-12-04T14:20Z,"I can't find the no cd patch. Where is it located? :/
In the no cd map I only find the icon I replace the original with."
[V],thethingy,2009-12-04T14:23Z,that is it
,babidog,2009-12-08T13:36Z,"How exactly am I supposed to install all these add-ons and tools? I havn't played this game before, and I wanted to download this version so I can play with all the add-ons available, but it seems that I have to do everything manually... and there are so many of them, it is chaos! Are there any dependencies on the addons or a specific way to put them, or I just double click all the .exe installations and copy-paste the rest in the Plugins folder? Also, what is better: Plugins in my Documents or Program Files? 
Thanks in advance!"
[V],thethingy,2009-12-08T17:26Z,"plugins in my documents is the place to put them. the plugins are in the format they are in as when new ones come out you have to sometimes remove old ones with the cleantool to make them work. install the ones you want or all of them then you can compact them down to a couple of small files with the data packer, but you loose the instructions for the plugins doing so and thats why the setups are there, best to spend an hour and install everything taking care to read the readmes as with some of the plugins that you manuall copy over you ony have to copy one or two of the files."
,babidog,2009-12-08T23:11Z,"Thank you thethingy, both for uploading and for replying!
Especially for the Clean Tool and Data Packer information. It is really helpful. I will try in a while."
,aznguy12,2009-12-15T19:06Z,"There was nothing in the torrent that i saw by the name of ""NO CD PATCH"" 

i also saw no instructions. i just followed those here. 

if you could please email me at vi3tboitim@gmail.com

i would be greatly appreciated.

thanks "
[V],thethingy,2009-12-16T07:41Z,"the instructions are the ""READ ME"" text contained in the torrent and 
are also shown in the first window when you exctract ""THE GAME"" archive 
and are also extracted with the archive and called ""INSTRUCTIONS.txt"".

The no cd patch is in ""THE GAME"" archive in the ""SC4 NO CD PATCH"" folder 
and its called ""SimCity 4"" (7.348kb)."
,jezebel420,2009-12-18T06:10Z,ok so i unpack the ingame tools somewhere then manually install all of the plug ins into the plugin folder in my documents right? cuz this shit is confusing as all hell...
,jezebel420,2009-12-18T06:18Z,my installation doesnt have a sim city 4 my documents folder =(
[V],thethingy,2009-12-18T06:25Z,"yep thats what you do, the folder is not created until the first time you start the game."
,jezebel420,2009-12-18T15:49Z,"mk, going to attempt to do this without fucking anything up... guess theres a first for everything"
,Zenit33,2009-12-30T11:51Z,"SimCity 4 Deluxe
(SC4 + Rush Hour + some extras)

-Burn out on 2cd's (or on virtual drive) and go through install.  
-Try
-Get ""SimCity needs gameplay CD[#2] to run""
-google for latest patch (to avoid stupid bugs), one I found is UPDATE_SKU1_TO_P1_B638
-after patched up, google: simcity 4 deluxe no cd 1.0
-download and replace the original sc4.exe with the no cd cracked one
-enjoy the game.

-the one called ""SimCity 4 v1.0 [ALL] No-CD/Fixed EXE"" on GameCopyWorld worked for me, try it if you have problems with specific ver 1.0xxx..."
[V],thethingy,2009-12-31T02:57Z,"Zenit33, all the things you recomend googling for are in the torrent."
,ivaldes047,2010-01-03T03:07Z,"I downloaded the torrent and all I see are the three (THE GAME, IN GAME TOOLS, and OUT OF GAME TOOLS) files, but they show up as really large single applications, which I cant open to access the iso file for example"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-03T12:14Z,"the files are self extracting .rar files, double click on then or right click and select install, install means extract for some bizzare reason. you dont need any software to extract them."
,belamtn,2010-01-09T00:35Z,"hello thethingy......am having trouble getting the .dat files to update (to the values listed here: http://simcity.ea.com/update/index_update.php?product=EP1&x=45&y=12 ) using the updater.  I can play the game, but have some pretty significant graphical glitches on a computer that should have no problems.

Thoughts on what I am doing wrong?  The updater runs, and appears to have done its job, but the .dat files do not increase in size."
,belamtn,2010-01-09T00:40Z,"sorry.....also....the .exe does not increase in size either.

Thank you for your patience."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-09T01:08Z,"that update is in the files that you extracted, if you have installed the update from here then when you update the game nothing will happen as there is only 1 game update. your graphics issues can be solved in the game settings by changing the graphics properties from hardware to software and adjusting the screen resoloution and no of vehicles etc"
,GeirGrusom,2010-01-09T02:12Z,I kinda have a hard time starting .exe files from thepiratebay torrents...
,belamtn,2010-01-11T01:44Z,"I've run the update, but the problem is my .dat and .exe files DO NOT match the file sizes listed here:  http://simcity.ea.com/update/index_update.php?product=EP1&x=45&y=12 

My files are smaller, so I gotta conclude they are not updated.

Anyone have any ideas on how to get the files to actually update?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-11T01:49Z,"what os are you using?, if its vista or 7 run the update as admin.

if you install the game and update from THIS torrent you will have no problems, the update takes less than a minute and it tells you it has been sucesfull when complete."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-11T01:52Z,"and in the torrent there are 2 updates 1 non mission critical transport update and the game update, install both to be sure you have the right one."
,xterkelx,2010-01-27T17:09Z,hi can u speak danish ?
,xterkelx,2010-01-27T17:13Z,"should i unzip IN GAME TOOLS & PLUGINS, OUT OF GAME TOOLS and THE GAME ?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-28T06:59Z,"xterkelx, sorry only speak chinese,japaniese, corean, german,icelandic, aborigine, welsh and portugese,, its best to unzip them but you can just click on the zip and select install as it is a self extracting archive."
,will9898,2010-01-30T01:28Z,"Hey, 
I downloaded the game and installed the game, but when I try to use it, some of the buildings don't show up like the windmill and when people start building houses on the residential zone like everyones yard is brown even after its done building and I've played this game before and I know its not supposed to look like that. 
I also downloaded the ingame tools and out of game tools and I don't know how to install those??? would installing all of these fix this problem??? and how do I install them???"
,will9898,2010-01-30T01:51Z,actually its not just that when ever something builds on any zone the spot that its on turns a light brown 
[V],thethingy,2010-01-30T07:07Z,"yes the ingame tools and plugins have files in them that you need, extract the archives and you will have a shit load of folders, the in game ones you generally just copy to your plugins folder, but open each folder first as some have installers."
,dvldog,2010-02-23T00:10Z,Thanks works amazingly and thanks for PowerISO

[V],thethingy,2010-06-04T19:30Z,"^^^the above commentors: this works perfictly and has been here with 100's of seeds for 7 months.

mount the iso's with this to install;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5510720

the exe files are self extracting rar files, if you are having issues with self extraction then rename the .exe to .rar and open with winrar instead.

simcity is a tempramental game on some pc's so check the maxis support website for errors, i have had this working fully on xp 32bit, vista 32 & 64 bit and win 7 32bit and now run it on win 7 64bit "

,ax3man,2010-06-21T05:24Z,"okay, last question, that im probably about to answer on my own but just in case how do i install the plugins? i think someone already asked, but is it as simple as just copying and pasting the folders in the ""plugins"" folder where i installed the game? thank you sooooo much this game is addicting, even without the plugins and add ons"

I have never installed on windows 7
Using windows 7 ARC gamer edition, at the end of installation all goes well. I dump the no cd patch, update and install ingame tools. This is where I get the first issue. It says some are not installed correctly and to restart my machine and try again. Than, I cant launch the game, says its an issue with installation or the operating system :(

Is there a torrent for win 7?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know this is a good torrent, have had it on several other laptops so it still gets +1 from me...
