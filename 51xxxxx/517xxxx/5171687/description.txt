                             from the album Need You Now 

  
"Need You Now" is the title of a country music song recorded by American country music group Lady Antebellum. It serves as the lead-off single and title track to their upcoming second studio album, which is expected for release on January 26, 2010.

  The three group members, along with Josh Kear wrote this song about yearning for companionship in the middle of the night, as explained in the chorus:

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone 
And I need you now 
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control 
And I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without 
I just need you now 
Hillary Scott explained that this song, and many others on their second album, "are about what we are learning as we go through the ups and downs of different relationships." She added: "All three of us know what it's like to get to that point where you feel lonely enough that you make a late night phone call that you very well could regret the next day. But you do it anyway because it's the only thing that's going to give you any relief in that moment."
