,Aulpay,2009-12-01T20:08Z,"Does anyone know what song is played during the ""Bliss"" scene? I know I have it somewhere but its driving me mental cant think what it is or who it is by? Any help is greatly appriciated"
,max2562,2009-12-02T18:06Z,yes its true... new episodes come out in march 2010. battlestar galactica did this and so did heroes. there are reasons but i'm sure those of you who say this is bullshit obviously carry much more wisdom than the producers. you should let the rest of the free world benefit from your divine wisdom. but i'm sure you had already thought of that. radiating that much genius might kill us all. again you are so wise!

,skylamer,2009-12-06T11:12Z,why it isnt want to downloading?!

It's from Agaetis Byrjun album by Sigur Ros, Track 2  ""Svefn g englar"" brilliant album and just breen reissued so worth getting hold of now.	"
,LocoViking,2010-02-08T17:29Z,"icgraham is probably right (the winter olympics). When did this show start? We dont have it here in Norway, and i cant wait until e.5. Thanks for the upload (as always eztv)."

,ptv83,2010-03-02T10:22Z,"they split the seasons into 2 parts because 1, it is a new show and they were looking at the ratings before filming more, and two, you get more ratings during midseason premiers/finales ... it's a canadian thing, then specialty staions caught onto it so people would have to subscribe for the whole year.. now everyone seems to be doing it... blame canada :) .. eh!"
,dardar6t9,2010-03-22T01:17Z,"You have to be kidding me.....this show was a waste of band-width to download the first 4 episodes....as the song goes ""Dont believe the hype"" If there is any justice in the universe they will can this show in the too stupid bin and not release any more of the crap on mankind....BAD!!!BAD!!!BAD!!!"
,dardar6t9,2010-03-22T08:08Z,thank God they cancelled it.....It was a drawn-out bad B-grade movie that given the choice of watching that crap again or slamming my testicles in a kitchen drawer for the same length of time......I'd opt for the latter :) 
,Knock_out,2010-03-31T02:27Z,next one airs to day:-)
,henry76,2010-04-02T00:40Z,Thanks :))))))
,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2010-04-04T22:38Z,"@ dardar6t9, they didn't cancel the show!

If you saw the original V as a kid, you may be disappointed trying to compare this back to that, times were different and the Mini-series back then was EPIC.  Since that time there have been gazilions of shows about aliens trying to take us over.  

That doesn't mean this new version doesn't have some interesting parts.  It's got a lot to compete with and it's just getting started.
The V leader where's Pantyhose for crying out loud that makes it a watch no matter what. 8-) "
,bo-peep,2010-11-29T11:35Z,thanks
