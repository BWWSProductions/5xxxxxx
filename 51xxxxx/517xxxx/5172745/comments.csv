,VinYl_RiPPa,2009-11-21T17:43Z,"A DVD was officially released containing both the ""Beautiful Dreamer"" documentary and this concert. It is basically the audio layer from that DVD in 16-bit FLAC (intended for audio CD), obviously without additionnal EQing, compression and stuff. 

on the DVD this seems to be a ""studio live show""; as the crowd is at most 200 and standing, and a quick search on the internet didn't tell me more about the date this was recorded. Maybe you can do your own research on this one ?"
