OBVIOUS PSEUDONYM - WESTGATE RUN

This is a two-track demo of the forthcoming album 'An Anagram Of Hits', 
featuring:

1. Westgate Run
2. Sex Noises (feat. Gobiron Ryan on harmonica)

We are Obvious Pseudonym, the band originally responsible for bringing 
you non-hits such as Keith Chegwin For A Day and Disco Sauce.Our music 
ranges from disco to samba, blues to cheese-pop, chillout and 
classical; we've been accused of robbing styles and ideas from everyone 
from the Pet Shop Boys to Swing Out Sister touching on Asylum Street 
Spankers and Genesis; music legends have afforded us accolades 
including "entertaining", "fantastic", "twee" and "buy me a pint." In 
short, you won't have seen anything like it before.

Our music's been played on radio and telly - our more notable 
appearances and mentions have been on BBC TV's Have I Got News For You 
and Never Mind The Buzzcocks.

As one fan said, "If Chas'n'Dave had wild, mad, sticky sex with the Pet 
Shop Boys this is what they'd produce - and Pete Waterman would do the 
mopping up."
