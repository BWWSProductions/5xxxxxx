,xcraze,2010-06-29T10:14Z,"you said all your torrents are scanned with kaspersky with no viruses, however my kaspersky told me its a virus. Soz mate, gonna take a pass on that one."
,mightyh,2011-05-21T00:31Z,"Nice program. Fast download. Unfortunately, the crack folder cannot get past through my Avast anti virus due to the malware detected.....sorry dude, but you're doing a good job with your other torrents."
