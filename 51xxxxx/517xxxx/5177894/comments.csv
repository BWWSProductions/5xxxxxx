,vidiation,2009-11-27T15:47Z,"Plays fine on PC using Media Player Classic, but when burned to CD-R and tried to play back on Divx-certified set-top player the audio ended up way out of sync. How the heck did you end up with ""129kbps"" mp3 audio, anyway? Would be interested to know what encoding software tools you're using.  AutoGK would not even accept the file for re-encoding because of the ""unsupported audio format.""

Anyway, excellent video quality in a small file size. Thanks for the effort, but I'll have to check out another copy. --vid"
