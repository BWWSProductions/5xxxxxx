,stf777,2009-11-25T14:41Z,"excuse my ignorance, but what do i have to do after  i download the file? There are zipped files and doubt copying straight onto device will work..."
,fransfl,2009-11-25T19:12Z,@stf777: You have to decompress them with WinRAR (or 7Zip) program.
,lex0013,2009-11-25T23:30Z,"Hi after decompressing,  the map is 2.03GB.  How do I fit it on a 2GB tomtom XL?"
,fransfl,2009-11-26T00:05Z,"@lex0013: remove CSpeech files in the decompressed folder, you don't need them in order to make the map work!"
,lex0013,2009-11-26T00:57Z,"Hi, Put on my XL IQ Routes,  but  get message ""problem with map, you cannot use this map on this device : europe - 80"""
,unisubzero,2009-11-26T23:30Z,"Thx for the up !
BTW do I need to patch my Tomtom devices first or patching map is enough ?
Used PDA?s up until now."
,fransfl,2009-11-27T15:01Z,"@lex0013: You have to use a cracked navcore (or patch your original one) in order to use this map.

@unisubzero: If you're using a Tomtom device  then you have to use a cracked navcore; else, if you're still using a PDA, then this map is not compatible with PDAs..."
