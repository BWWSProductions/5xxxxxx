You read it and think, ""this can't be true"",then as time goes on you start noticing certain things in the news, and you go to the net to take a closer look, and it jives with what you read. Rinse and repeat a few times and pretty soon you realize that reality really is stranger than fiction.

But then I'm an intelligent person. I began to see things 30 years ago when I started to take a close look at the CFR and Trilateral Commission. Nowadays, you don't need a brain what so ever, nor any research... they come right on TV and tell you what they're about, what they're doing, and what their plans for you are.

And then you still don't get it!

And then you call us idiots and morons!!!"
