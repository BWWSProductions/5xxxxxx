,niklaws,2009-12-28T12:24Z,"How is it possible this movie is only 4gb, while there are other 1080p movies, which are 7gb, or even more.... 100 mb more or less, thats just because of the lenght of the movie, 

but 1080p  movies, that are about twice as big?? 

Please tell me..."
,corrigan.93,2009-12-29T20:38Z,"Greatly appreciate your work, looks great on full HD tv on PS3, I was just wondering if a Blu-ray rip of Wall-E is out of the question? I downloaded a Blu-ray rip from somebody else on the PS3 team (can't remember exactly who it was right now) but the rip wouldnt fit on my external hard drive which has a 1TB capacity with over 700GB free space i might add. 

Please reply, and thanks in advance.

,corrigan.93,2010-01-02T04:38Z,"No way, I have hundreds of Movies on my External hard drive that im not willing to erase for the sake of one (the file was only 4gb btw)."
,BAMMBAMM72,2010-01-06T15:54Z,"Great pic. but I have a problem playing back all you files on my PS3. NO VOCALS back ground sound is great, but can't hear when people speak. Streamming threw TVersity need HELP......"
,viperrrr,2010-02-21T08:37Z,"@bricktophd

how do i get subtitles (.srt/.sup/etc.) to play with this movie? It seems to be impossible.. The quality is amazing and the size makes it more than perfect, but subtitles for the english parts is necessary for me. thank you for any advice you may have"
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-02-28T03:47Z,"Very nice quality.
For those of you wondering how these files sustain their quality in such small file sizes, the uploader uses a program called 'Ripbot.' The only sacrifice made is a slight decrease in color saturation, but it's almost unnoticeable for the average viewer.
Keep 'em coming, bricktophd."
