,EggRobo,2010-12-05T23:27Z,"... I could have sworn that there were plenty more useful comments here the last time I was here... I thought I'd leave a message regarding the problem I am having. After about a year of continued use of Zoom Player it seems to have gone into permanent lock-down. No matter how many times I reinstall it or reset it to default it continues to fail it's integrity check on start up due to an invalid registry key (the crack). strangely enough it also seems to be randomly booting itself up without provocation as well. I just uninstalled it again to stop that, but what the hell could be the cause of all this?"

,midnightjester,2010-12-21T18:00Z,"LeviLaviLovi - Try using the magnetic link, or copying and pasting the torrents URL directly into your torrent agent. Both methods worked for me. Great download, easy to use and execute!"
,cdogg777,2011-02-05T07:23Z,"I'm pretty sure this is a virus.  patch was found as  a virus which is expected.  after i disabled sep to install it wouldn't run at all, enabled sep and it found the patch and zplayer.exe as a trojan."
,Heretikos,2011-02-07T06:16Z,"I couldn't get this to download. Not from the magnet link or the URL... But this is obviously a chattchitto torrent... So I just went there. SORRY PIRATE BAY!! I still love ya.... But chattchitto kicks all ass.. There are no bad torrents there. So that guy who said this was a virus, doesn't know what he's doing. There are no bad torrents on chattchitto!"
