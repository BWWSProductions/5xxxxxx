,stage62,2011-05-22T06:16Z,I have had the same problem after putting in the code. It looks like there are two crack folders which I believe are the same however I believe it takes some experimenting.  I had it correct before I did over my system; but now I am reinstalling it and finding the register information changes up above in the top part of the register window.  One thing for sure I know is after installing a new software one should reboot the system.  Any other solution is don't give up until you figure it out.
,stage62,2011-05-22T07:01Z,"1. Install TVPaint Animation Pro.

2. Replace the main exe by the one from crack dir.

So in reality you must replace the sku.dll in the original TVPaint program folder you just made. Then you also extract the TVPAINT_ANIMATION_PRO_V9.5.3_BILANGUAGE-CRACK-FOR-XP-XFORCE Execute File to your new program folder. This is the answer you are looking for. And I believe you will be happy and content! Good Luck on your Animation Endeavors!"

,zirkybadoo,2011-06-18T15:29Z,I installed and reinstalled the thing like 7 times. Does anyone have a definitive answer to this?
,zirkybadoo,2011-06-18T15:46Z,"btw it says, while installing: 

 ""error opening file for writing: E:/WINDOWS/system32/TVPAPThumbnail9.dll. Perhaps this has something to do with it?"
,Miloukuin,2011-09-07T16:14Z,Is there a way you could upload a version for Mac?Would be greatly appreciated!
