Sunday, August 30th, 2009 â€“ running time 18:45

Learn how to use Smart Objects in Photoshop and how they protect your pixels when scaling images.
Deke McClellan is back once again to guest host with Bert Monroy on the topic of Smart Obects. We will work with RAW dng images and some type in a branding project. Screen cap (1280x720 135 KB):

*** What is a Smart Object?
A Smart Object is a special type of layer where the pixels are protected in an envelope of sorts. When sized down, the pixels are not damaged. Deke shows you how to import images into Photoshop as a Smart Layer. In this example, he uses two portraits of a model, kept as dng files.

*** Resizing Smart Objects
With a Smart Object, you can commit changes, and resize at a later time. Deke shows us this by enlarging the model's photo, whose size was matched to the canvas upon import.

*** Remove background with blending mode
You might notice a seam in the image where the two images come together. To get rid of the white background so that the images blend together, change the layer's blend mode to Multiply.

*** Adjust lighting of a Smart Object
Sometimes, Smart Objects need light adjustments. Double click the Smart Object, and the image will pop up in a new window based on its file format. Since we are working in RAW, the RAW adjustment window pops up. Standard pixel-based images would open as editable pixels in a new window.

*** Apply blending modes for legible text
Deke shows us how to apply text effects so that the copy is dark against a white background, and light against dark backgrounds. He starts by inverting the colors, then changing the layer blend mode to Invert. This creates distasteful colors, apply more blending modes and adjust levels to achieve a desired look.
