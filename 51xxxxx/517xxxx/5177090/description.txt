   Its time for something new... 
             
   The multi-band  pitch shifter  PRISM takes  a fresh  approach to  solve the 
   problem  of  shifting  the  pitch of  complex  sound  sources  in realtime. 
   Traditional frequency shifting shifts all frequencies in an input up by the 
   same amount and thereby alters their harmonic relation and tends to produce 
   inharmonic results. But it's perfect in dealing with transients. 
             
   Pitch shifting on the other side sounds "right", but the transients go  mad 
   and the sound gets metallic and grainy especially on high down shiftings. 
             
   PRISM splits the  spectrum in 27  bands and applies  a different amount  of 
   frequency shifting to each band  emulating a harmonic pitch shifting.  This 
   gives you perfect pitch  shifting for all kind  of drum sounds over  a vast 
   shifting range  of +/-  five octaves  without disturbing  the transients or 
   introducing  metallic  distortions.  With  harmonic  sounds  you  will  get 
   inharmonicities but it's much better behaved than pure frequency  shifting. 
   The extreme range of shifting gives  you access to a vast field  of unknown 
   sonic territory.  
             
   The  possibility  to  apply  different shiftings  on  each  band  gives you 
   exciting possibilities: 
             
   Suppose you have a drum loop which  is perfect, but the bass drum is  a bit 
   too high or too  low to fit in  your mix then you  can easily get the  bass 
   drum shifted a bit down and the rest of the spectrum remains unchanged..

   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5
   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
