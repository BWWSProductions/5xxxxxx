EXTRA INFORMATION:

In ApologetiX, we try to be all things to all men so that by all means we might save some (1 Cor. 9:22). Consequently, we play many styles of music, but that doesn't mean we all have the same tastes.

One style we all agree on is late-1970s classic rock. We grew up with it, and thanks to Guitar Hero and Rock Band a whole new generation is growing up with it as well. So that's our focus this time -- playing music that mattered to us then, while singing about what matters to us now.

When naming this project, we considered the albums the original songs came from, and decided to spoof ELO's Discovery as Recovery. We all loved our parody of "Don't Bring Me Down," and now we could close our album with it as ELO did.

One of Merriam-Webster's definitions for "recover" is "to save from loss and restore to usefulness." That's what Christ did for us and what we try to do with our parodies. The Bible says we were once dead in our sins but are now alive in Christ (Eph. 2:4-5). That's quite a recovery!

Although in some senses ApologetiX does cover versions of other people's music, we cover them in a new way, so re-covery seemed appropriate in that sense, too. Best of all, now ApologetiX can officially be called a Recovery group.

Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! (Romans 11:11a)
