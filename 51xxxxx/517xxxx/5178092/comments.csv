Easy to unzip (twice, as explained before)

Did you guys modified the ""VODF.pdf""; I meant the added instructions, it is an excellent instructional book, also thanks a lot because it is ""searchable"" and ?non password protected

,obfuscate,2010-07-01T04:08Z,"The 3 zip files each contain a RAR file.  When to attempt to unRAR them it asks for a disk to be put into the CD drive.  

These 3 zip files are small and I don't understand why 3 are needed or why 3 RAR files are needed.  

Am not new at this.  Perhaps someone could explain the unusual technique used here.

Thanks"
