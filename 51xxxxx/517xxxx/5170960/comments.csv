,kill_factor,2009-11-21T07:30Z,can someone comment on quality? is this real BRRip?
,zzzonked,2009-11-21T13:24Z,yeaaa checkout tha fuckin screenshts -kill -dumbasss
,manualdownload,2009-11-24T01:51Z,"Screens don't tell you anything about the quality of a movie file... just the quality of that one screen shot. That doesn't tell you anything about the frame rate or the resolution. And at 1.95 gb it's not a BR rip. So, instead of name calling why don't you just answer the f**cking question about the quality of the film."
,manualdownload,2009-11-24T05:06Z,"HolyRoses,
Don't misunderstand me. I don't have any problem with you or your upload. All I'm saying is that when someone asks about the quality instead of calling them a dumbass wouldn't it be just as easy to give them the some basic info? "
,kellyaa1,2009-11-26T07:42Z,"I love your rips because they play on Apple TV.  What do you encode with, and at what bit rate? Apple TV can't handle .mkv files so these are greate. Thanks!"
,sanvodka,2009-11-27T08:52Z,"å¤šDoes it have english hardcoded subs in the parts spoken in german or french?

I haven't seen any in the screenshots, but I want to be sure."
,3xp3ri3nc3,2010-02-02T22:16Z,"Hi, HR :)
These x264.720p uploads of yours, does it work to burn them over to a DVD disc, then watch it on a Xbox 360?"
,Aykarin,2011-02-21T15:23Z,"Thank you to the one person seeding this. When I eventually download it, I'll continue seeding. HR rips are always worth seeding."
