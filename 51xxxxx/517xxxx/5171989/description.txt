      ***Alanis Morissette - Jagged Little Pill - 1996 - 320kbps***


JAGGED LITTLE PILL won the 1996 Grammy Awards for Album Of The Year and Best Rock Album. "You Oughta Know" won the Grammys for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. "You Oughta Know" was also nominated for Song Of The Year, and Alanis Morissette was nominated for Best New Artist.
"Ironic" was nominated for the 1997 Grammy Award for Record Of The Year.
With exuberant vocal gymnastics, Alanis Morissette offers chilling monologues from an outspoken and aggressive young performer. Her straight-for-the-jugular lyrical stance is given ample room to flex its muscles, and because of that very fact, JAGGED LITTLE PILL is indeed a tricky swallow. Pushed into the public eye by the scathing single "You Oughta Know," Morissette's American debut (she had two Canadian releases as a teen popster) lives up to its title.
