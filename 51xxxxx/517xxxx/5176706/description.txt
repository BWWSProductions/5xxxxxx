    This archive presents over 120Mb of emails, documents, computer code and models from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, written between 1996 and 2009.

    The CRU has told the BBC that the files were obtained by a computer hacker 3-4 days ago.

    This archive includes unreleased global temperature analysis computer source code that has been the subject of Freedom of Information Act requests.

    The archive appears to be a collection of information put together by the CRU prior to a FoI redaction process.

Keeping this on torrentz as a safety net if the original link breaks as it has done before.
