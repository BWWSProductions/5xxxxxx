May the billion dollar enviro-empire/government/ media complex of fraud crumble to dust, so that real conservationists and humanitarians can do honest work. "
,RecycledElectrons,2009-11-25T19:07Z,"Global Warming and Anthropogenic Climate Change are hoaxes. Here's the evidence. 

The UN's IPCC reports were based on data published by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia. 

In these emails, we see that the University of East Anglia made up numbers. They took data on ocean temperatures from buoys, and added from 1 to 11 degrees to the readings. 

The shrill screams from the pro-global-warming crowd have always contained several points: (1) There can be no scientific debate, as the debate was over once the first paper came out of the IPCC. (2) No, you cannot see the raw sensor data. (3) Trust us. We would not lie to you.

Well folks, it was all a hoax. As a college professor, I have not seen any data showing the Earth's climate has warmed since 1960, except for that based on this hoax.

This is why if you publish a scientific paper, and withhold the raw data, it's NOT a SCIENTIFIC paper.

I only regret that there is not the possibility of the death penalty for those who either hoaxed this data (e.g., the President of the University of East Anglia) or who (e.g., US Secretary of the Navy) refused to turn over FOIAed information.
