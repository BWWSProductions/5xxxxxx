RE SEED with updated guide to torrents text file and trackerless DHT to replace the now obsolete public tracker system.

From the original seeder:


VOB files (mpeg2) tagged and good to go right out of the box
320kps Stereo Audio

Mixed Screen radio as record company video makers do not understand that CRT 4:3 screen ratio support is as dead as the public tracker sigh and the mixed ratio really pisses off us Video DJ's who are ALL 16:9 wide screen sigh.  Hey Record company dudes, got a great idea...  Let the 4:3 people see the video in letterbox format and just give us what we want... 100% Widescreen.

Source Promo Only Canada DVD9 ripped into tracks with DVD Decrypter in split by cell ID mode and re named (tagged) using industry standard conventions.

See torrent files for track listings and enjoy for I will be pulling the plug my end on Tuesday 24th November for at least 16 weeks.   Merry Christmas Gang and a very Happy and Trackerless 2010 :)
