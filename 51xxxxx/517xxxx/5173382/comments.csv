,Chricton,2009-11-25T05:29Z,"Been awesome seeing all this promo-only stuff available, big thanks. I would love to see some of the 2002-2008 years when you get back.

jnclaude, you wont see all that much content from before the 70's from promo only, and french material is probably even rarer. "
[T],towerelect,2009-11-27T19:21Z,"OK Gang first about the TRACKER.  There is NOT ONE!  Read the Pirate Bay blogg for more info, but Bit Torrent no longer requires the torrent tracker file as DHT or Distributed Hash Tracking is now built in to most clients and relives the need and vunerablity of relying on a central tracker web site, which can be taken out by legal action or hacking.

The Pirate Bay Site is now only an INDEX site for your uploads, that is it and that is all, pretty dammed good as now the RIAA and other dickheads have no longer got any legal reason to go after TPB as they don't host the torrents, each end user does, so you are my tracker and I am your tracker... Pretty cool eh... But as normal few of the end users here get it and I am one of the few who have been waiting years to host DHT and now I am :)

Video's from the 50's and 60's are very rare and often are Tele Cine (film recording of live TV) types and not good enough quality for me to use on my Video Discotheques so I don't post them.   I wish people would stop taking these files and then re posting them as AVI or MPEG4 mini files of "
[T],towerelect,2009-11-27T19:23Z,Oh you have to click on the Magnet link by the way to get this going and there must be at least one seed in the swarm to give you the link.   I am off the internet until March 2010 so these torrents will have to rely on you to keep them going meantime.
