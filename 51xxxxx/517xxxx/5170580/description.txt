Synopsis/ Plot
It's the wee hours at Wang Wang Supermarket, somewhere in northern China, where nerdy stockroom boy Li Junwei (new teen idol, singer Kimi Qiao) is on duty with -- and only has eyes for -- Tang Xiaolian (Lulu Li, "Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl". But the quiet soon lapses into chaos when balding, pop-eyed He Sanshui (Xu Zheng) comes in with two doofus heavies (Zhao Yingjun, Wang Dongfang) and demands to speak to the mart's boss lady, Wang Sufen (Yang Qing, not the helmer).

Turns out the boss -- who's actually off gambling -- was responsible for He's inability to claim the prize on a winning lottery ticket, so he wants 9,500 yuan ($1,400) compensation. When Tang explains the boss isn't around, He & Co. tie Tang up and take over the joint, planning to sell goods until they reach that value. However, business is slow, and as a variety of characters come and go during the night, He turns more desperate. The arrivals of the boss lady and then a gun-toting robber (Zhang Jiayi) only make things worse.
