J M Bernstein: Lectures on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. A complete and detailed reading of this perennially misrepresented/misinterpreted text. Over 50 hours of lectures with Syllabus, reading list and introductory essay by Bernstein. The free distribution of these files by Bernstein is the epitome of an Hegelian act, the greatest treasure that I have discovered on the internet. But, after all, everything becomes Hegelian once you have read 'Phenomenology of Spirit'.
