Release Notes:

Formed in January 2007, Jordan Grant, Peter Butler, and Keith McPherson joined
forces and created the monster that is Hudson. A straight ahead, old school,
plain and simple, power rock trio. The kind of band that has their first joining
of instruments, plays the first few bars of whatever tune was mentioned, and has
to stop playing immediately because that old cliched moment arises, when you
just can't play anymore because everyone's grinning from ear to ear. It just
felt right.

Mashing together rock, blues, and old school gritty southern country rock,
Hudson has created a sound very unique yet very familiar at the same time. Their
sound is much like many of their influences including, Foghat, Humble Pie, and
just about anyone that has been playing anything close to rock and roll in the
last fifty years or so.

Hudson is quickly becoming the band to see. So come on out and join us, and help
keep the rock and roll spirit alive.
