[T],dexto,2009-11-21T00:24Z,"To be honost it looks like a good game, i like the fightskills and all, a bit like prototype."
,Spartan_300,2009-11-21T02:58Z,"Thanks for the upload,..."
,kollapaneni,2009-11-21T11:31Z,hey what are all the minimum and maximum requirements to play this game?
,ishikawajoe,2009-11-21T12:30Z,"Anyone else get a random gay crash soon after defeating the pox giant? It is the bit where you escape the building...

This crash makes you start from mission 001 again so yes, it is quite annoying

Nice torrent, will be seeding"
,ishikawajoe,2009-11-21T14:42Z,"^^^^^^^^^^
*Edit - The crash has stopped after 3-4 times playing through the game to that point. However, a similar crash occurred in the middle of a movie. This crash could possibly be random :S "
,cipher_phinx,2009-11-21T15:39Z,this game s not recommended for pc..it is design for consoles like xbox...even though my gtx 285 is just a little bit lag
,ishikawajoe,2009-11-22T03:49Z,"I don't know if it is my PC's setting or the actual game itself or the way skidrow compacted/stored/cracked this game, however, I am having some major problems

* The game crashes at random points frequently, very VERY annoying considering you have to start from the beginning of a mission

* Probably because of the above problem, my pc setting of the game i.e. graphic settings does not get saved. Very annoying to have to change the setting every time you play

* Other than that at the moment perhaps audio quality is a little on the downside. However, it could be my shit speakers, shit sound device on my PC

Anyone else have similar problems? Great game, great attempt at sharing this game skidrow, however, i am disappointed :("
,peppnast,2009-11-22T06:21Z,I've been trying to get the crack to work on this thing for about 2 hours now. The crack given won't work still asks for activation. SKIDROW.EXE= BSOD if i try and open. I have a New install of windows 7 and have tried all the other cracks on the net i could find with no luck. Anybody have any suggestions? Thanks.
,psy_fry,2009-11-22T06:58Z,can some one please help me out with this product key bullshit (god bless ne one who does)
,ishikawajoe,2009-11-22T07:51Z,"To the guys above talking about the crack for this game, there is another version of Ninja Blade WITH a link to download the crack on pirate bay (LOOK HARDER AND READ)

The crack all you have to do is extract, and then cut/copy and paste those files in the folder where Ninja Blade is installed.

I remember reading something about windows 7, i think you need a different crack, sorry, not too sure"
,fraustx3,2009-11-22T23:04Z,Can  some1 tell me how to play these Games. Im new to this kind of stuff. What do i need to play em and how do it make it happen. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,peppnast,2009-11-23T01:23Z,I tried the win7 crack on the net with no luck. I had to rip this iso with alcohol so I could use the .mdf file that came with the crack + used regedit to change values and still no go. However I believe the windows 7 cracks are for the russian version because all the .txt are in chzech or russian. If someone has one that works I would be much appreciative. Thanks 
,master2pc,2009-11-23T14:34Z,"Hay Guys...the installation is done.. and copy the folders

,isgod101,2010-03-13T03:35Z,"Not worth the download imho.  Another crappy console port.  There is NO tutorial, they just throw you into the game.  There is no readme.  There is kind of a tutorial in-game except for the fact that it is for a 360 controller.  The cut scenes are retarded and if you miss one move you have to start from the beginning.  The game would skip some frames every few seconds no matter what the settings were on.  I wouldn't recommend this game especially if you have limited bandwidth."
,Tre0n,2010-03-14T08:09Z,"@jonny909
Reinstall DirectX, OR search for the dll on Google, there're a bunch of DLL sites out there that'll have it. When you've got it, put it in your Windows/System32/ folder. If that doesn't work, put it in the same folder as the Ninja Blade executable."
,Donalddln,2010-06-22T18:27Z,"In my first opinion, this game is almost too much like Ninja Gaiden 2 not that I'm actually saying it is or that I am mad about it. It has the same fighting system and almost looks alike on the ninja's uniform, but I will say that there are different enemies and some cool effects like falling off buildings and stuff. I love this game even though it only has three different types of weapons. This is the closest game I could find for PC of being like ninja gaiden 2 and I love the experience."
