,Aodslasher,2009-11-29T13:09Z,"@IIIIIIM6IIIIII
most encoders seem to use XviD4PSP. its one of the best encoding software out there and its free. also it can encode .srt (subs) into hardsubs for the 360 just google it.

thanx secret for another great release
A/10 V/10  "

,piratebay,2009-12-03T16:52Z,"I actually downloaded three versions of this movie(maxspeed, fxm and this one) and I have to tell you, the rest two are nothing when compared to this one. Once you watch it in high quality, you will never turn back to lower quality rips.
secret_myth is really one of the best encoders !

I'm really amazed by the quality it offers for its size. And, I'm also glad that secret_myth provides options to change audio. Way to go buddy!

And, the movie has all the photos taken at the ending credits. :)

@Aodslasher

I've always wanted to ask secret_myth about that. I'll try it out. :)"
,pearl_001,2009-12-03T19:11Z,Thanks a lot Secret Myth for the upload.

,xTheBlackBirdx,2009-12-15T03:26Z,could you find a way to compress your movies to around 700 MB??
,Forkinator,2009-12-21T02:50Z,Thank you Secret Myth! I am new to this but do i just throw all these files onto a dvd and burn them and it will work? Or do i have to do something else?
,Laddie418,2009-12-22T07:39Z,nice fast download...looks great...thx!
,alienjesus,2009-12-24T08:28Z,"perfect as always

,jawman,2009-12-27T19:25Z,"i saw that someone wanted a good 300 BluRay Rip. Here is the best one I have seen so far:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4974621/300_Blu_Ray_Rip_FASM_X264_720p_Proper
it is TRUE 16:9 aspect ratio (no black bars) and the video & audio quality is amazing."
,nordictramp,2009-12-29T19:02Z,Forkinator...u need to convert it to DVD format and then burn it onto a DVD blank. You can use a software like ConvertXtoDVD to convert it..
,Griz111,2010-01-05T21:52Z,"Wow, how did you manage to get this high quality in 1,4GB ?"
,Manu_rox,2010-01-09T18:55Z,"great quality and that too at just 1.63 GB

thanks secret_myth"
,IloveHD,2010-01-09T22:48Z,"Secret!
I love the quality of your stuff. but I have one question! why did you change the profile of your videos from ""Main @L4.1 to High @L4.1""?
this is making your videos unable to play on Apple TV. how can I change that? and why did you start uploading them differently?"
,sveken95,2010-03-19T10:08Z,Hey. what software do you use to encode these Movies. can you please tell me i have DVDs i need rippien to my Hd and this was such good qulity for its size. Can you please tell me
,gabriel1475,2010-06-25T02:50Z,"Now THIS is what you call a rip! Why are there so many complete idiot noob reject ass-fondlers putting out their pathetic and shitty rips when they obviously dont know what they are doing? Ego? Stupidity? Retardation? Just stop it, you comical nubs! This looks brilliant! And only 1.6GB? That's barely more then double the size of the crappy 700MB rips that suck, but it's like 10x the quality. You rock!!!"
,gadsman1,2010-10-03T20:48Z,"fantastic file, thank you. works great."
,i.love.you.TPB,2011-04-28T17:12Z,wtf kingdom-release! u should be in the top. dunno why u are on 2 page. anyway thx. always HQ in 2 gigs :)
