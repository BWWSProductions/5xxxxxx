This torrent is an update from my earlier full series torrent here:

It fixes incorrect aspect ratio with first few episodes and they are also in better quality.

*THIS IS A RARE TORRENT SO SEED IT!*

Terrahawks Set in the year 2020, the series followed the adventures of the Terrahawks, a taskforce responsible for protecting Earth from invasion by a group of extraterrestrial androids and aliens led by Zelda. Like Anderson's previous puppet series, futuristic vehicles and technology featured prominently in each episode.

Terrahawks (technically, the Earth Defense Squadron) is an elite task force that protects Earth from alien invasion.
