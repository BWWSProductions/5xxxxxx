After 57 years of hypersleep Ripley is incidentally picked up by a spaceship. She hopes she will have time to relax and hopes the nightmare with the killer alien is finally over.
Unfortunately a colony of terraformers discovered the spacecraft on planet LV-426 from where the alien originated. A few weeks after Ripley's return the control-center loses contact with LV-426.
Ripley decides to accompany a a elite team of commando's to LV-426 to see if they can help the colonists. But once they arive they find the the colony to be deserted.
Or is it?"
