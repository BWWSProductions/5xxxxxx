  This is a live recording of Jonatha Brooke's August, 24
  concert from the Packing House Theater in Schnoor, Bremen
  (Germany). It was previously released by Scene Group OMA
  (OPEN MUSiC ASSOCiATiON) under the name "Jonatha_Brooke--
  Live_at_Packhaustheater_Im_Schnoor_(Bremen)-DVBC-08-24-
  2009-OMA".

  It's a great show, with an amazing performance by Jonatha,
  with excellent audio quality, really worth listening and
  keeping in your collection.

  I loved the both the concert and the colorful commentaries
  by Jonatha in it, but I wanted to have the songs separated
  with their proper names, mainly to put in a portable
  device to listen to it when commuting.

  So, I created a CUE file, edited it and split the tracks.
  For this reason, I had to convert from the original VBR-
  encoded MP3's to a CBR file, since VBR files are very hard
  to create accurate cues and further split. I also created
  a cover image to go with the album.

  I hope you enjoy this album as much as I do. Since this is
  not commercial, I guess we can spread this around without
  feeling guilty. Nonetheless, if you have any concerns,
  requests or other doubts, please contact me at

  On a short tour of Germany Jonatha Brooke is solo with
  acoustic guitar. Just as before in February 2003, the
  broadcasting studio audience in Bremen fell under her
  spell.

  Jonatha Brooke has one of these voices that remain in
  memory: beautiful and intimate. In addition, she is a
  great songwriter. She can tell the stories and touch you
  into deep emotional states. In concert, you can really
  feel the joy of the singer. A wonderful contemporary
  piece, full of character, with elements of pop, folk,
  soul, jazz.
