I'm on Windows 7 64 bit - if anyone knows how to fix the problem, that'd be appreicated. Thank you."
,Iced02,2009-12-11T17:06Z,Thanx go to you uploader :) will see if it works and post when done
,Narzul,2009-12-12T23:45Z,Still wondering if i should buy this game...Any Patches available? Game keeps crashing after 30-50 minutes...
,Robbtheskater,2009-12-22T07:36Z,I'm not sure if this torrent works yet... still dling but so far every game i have downloaded from Skidrow/Groo have worked beautifully. No worries here fellas.
,Narzul,2009-12-26T16:39Z,"Fixed it, all works fine now."
,Victore12,2009-12-27T20:22Z,"Hey uhm sorry guys but I've got a little issue. It's not like I haven't downloaded anything from skidrow before, I understand how I have to install these things but when I run the game it just says Steam application load error 5: 0000065434. I've reinstalled it twice and I've updated my drivers but it doesn't work.

 I think I did something wrong when I installed it because I really don't see what I have to do at this step: 4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on the DVD to  
        your installation directory and overwrite  

Any help would be appreciated because I really like king's bounty."
,kojurama,2009-12-27T23:55Z,"@Victore12

Ya its easy just open the dvd in your virtual drive and there will be a skidrow folder in there with the file that's all. So just explore the dvd in the virtual drive, it is not in installation files."
,Victore12,2009-12-28T00:05Z,@kojurama hey thanks a lot I really mean that :) I just didn't get it at first. It all works fine now. I can confirm this works btw.
,EcilopX,2009-12-29T02:13Z,"awesome game! 9,5/10"

,RellikReed,2010-01-06T05:20Z,"I get to the page with the ""New Game"" ""Load Game"" and I can't click anything. I still here the music which makes me think that it doesn't freeze but when I hit the windows button to escape, NONE OF THEM WORK. I end up having to restart the computer. Help me!!"
,zeleni92,2010-01-06T17:55Z,"I also have no sound, anyone with the same problem managed to fix it or knows how to?"
,nofear66,2010-01-19T01:43Z,easily installed and yes there is sound and everything's working great thanks Groo_The_Wanderer
,gooballz,2010-01-20T12:56Z,I also have the problem with launching on Windows 7 64bit. Just blinks and back to desktop :( Is there a patch or whatever?
,letumvelox,2010-01-28T07:08Z,"skidrow torrents have TROJANS and such like almost every other game torrent.
if you are stupid enough to trust them then dont use internet bank stuff and online games with accounts.
no antivirus can find every TROJAN or KEYLOGGER and especially not norton.
I use kaspersky wth 30 days free trial.
pls read about KEYLOGGERS and TROJANS for your own good."
,bujibujiba,2010-02-07T11:32Z,"The first time I run this game after installing, it goes real well and all. But when I tried to run it again, it crashes after showing me a black screen. I tried running it again a few times and the results are all the same. I've tried playing this both on Windows 7 and Vistal Ultimate. Anyone knows how to fix this?"
,prophet5590,2010-02-10T04:36Z,man... upload setup.exe or kb.exe (from skidrow folder) to virustotal.com and see the fireworks
,VegaTDM,2010-02-25T22:40Z,having the same problem at gil25. installed on my GF's laptop that also has win7 64bit and it worked fine. wtf?
,DragonF.C.Porto,2010-03-19T16:11Z,Thanks

,arrrba,2010-06-14T09:56Z,@prophet5590 What r u talking about 0/41 problems at VirusTotal.
,oversight9,2010-08-02T15:16Z,Torrent works great thanks for another great upload Skidrow. Also i'd like to say to all of you who are complaining about viruses that Skidrow is has a great record of games that work virus free. Go slander someone elses name and get the fuck off this page we dont need your bullshit. A lot of game coding is similar to virus coding and antiviruses cant tell the difference so they flag it as a virus. Thanks again Skidrow keep up the good work
,0Raik,2010-08-12T03:39Z,"Downloaded, works OK, installs, playable, no problems, no crashes, no virus/malware/spyware, crack works like a charm... I really like this game, once I play 3 hours Im probably going to buy it asap."
,Adriasna,2010-08-29T13:22Z,"I'm new to this and I'm not sure about what to do with all the file that comes with it... I got Daemon Tools and WinRar, but what are all the files in this for? I click one random and then clicks setup, then I download the game (or atleast that's what it says) and when that's done an error comes up when I try to click the icon an error pops up that say: Application load error 5:0000065434. 
What can I do to fix this problem? "
,gabriel1024,2010-09-08T04:03Z,I was having the windows 7 problem also i got it to work by disabling my Nvidia graphics driver.
,gabriel1024,2010-09-08T04:14Z,actually to correct what i just wrote. The problem is the mobile intel (R) 4 series express chipset family. with this disabled the game run on all resolutions and with windows 32 and 64 bit.
,m0nkeysensei,2010-09-28T04:27Z,Game freezes on the load screen when starting a new game. Anyone know how to fix this?
,kseo,2010-09-29T21:03Z,"FINALLY FOUND SOLLUTION ->
game is ok, some problems with security i think, the game can not create file in documents.

SOLLUTION
Copy file game.ini from install dir \data\ to documents\My games\Kings Bounty Princess\
Now open the file and edit 2 first lines set

setf ~screenresoultionx 1920
setf ~screenresoultiony 1080

where 1920 x 1080 is my primary monitor screen resollution.
save file run game (with crack of course) :)"
,ijacker,2010-11-01T20:05Z,i can verify kseo's fix
,tinynik,2012-04-25T18:14Z,"I can also verify the fix above.
Thank you very much! I always hate downloading a game that's a couple years old only to find the fix is missing from the .nfo. Fortunately, I was able to find it here... thanks again."
,mrben1987,2012-05-29T09:58Z,i can confirm that the fix does not work.. tried MANY MANY different configs None worked may just be another shitty skidmark crack good job guys
,moaital,2012-06-18T03:25Z,Another way to make this game work is installing it directly in C:
