Filmed live at the Manchester Apollo during his sell out tour, Jason Manford showcases some of the freshest material on the stand up circuit in this hotly anticipated debut DVD. 
Renowned for his cheeky story-telling and loveable, friendly delivery, Jason takes us through the rules of driving, urinal etiquette, and the lies Dads tell in a tour de force of observational humour.
This brand new, critically acclaimed show from Channel 4's `8 out of 10 Cats' team captain, BBC1's `Walk on the Wild Side' and host of `Live at the Apollo', will have you laughing before you know it. 
DVD Extras include Jason being interviewed by his brother, exclusive behind the scenes footage and a visit to Manchester City football ground to meet the club mascot, Moonchester.
