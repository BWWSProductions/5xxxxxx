Another great one

Hey could you put up Bruno "
,BasicKiller,2009-11-24T08:12Z,"@jimripper hight Bitrate doesn't really means its a good quality, What really matters is how good its been compressed & encoded. I have seen many rips from Nhance groups under 2 GB which offers more quality & smooth picture than available 4.3 GB sized 720p rips by other groups

BTW I am looking for other release bcz it doesn't has 5.1 audio"
,BasicKiller,2009-11-24T08:17Z,"@HolyRoses  Your release picture quality at only 1600kps is really impressive. Good Job. If u could do this with AC3 or DD 5.1 Audio then I am goona be ur fan 

PS: I love audio in DTS but size really matters lol..."
,Seeanneb,2009-12-01T01:39Z,i download all my movies from you and have never had a problem but for some reason itunes says that this movie cannot be played on my ipod (it's an itouch). do you know why?
,iSmell,2009-12-08T23:55Z,"So all of your videos have been A-mazing so far, I am just wondering (I am new!) If the video and audio ARE synced in VLC but when i transfer it to a dvd (using dvd flick) the audio is ahead of the video, do you know what the issue could be? And do you know of another program better then Dvd flick(and what is it)? Thanks for your time excellent quality all the time!"

,Zendra,2010-06-22T00:11Z,"The quality is really great for the 1,4 gb of size, but the sound is bad, at least you can di is to increase the loudness, but if you put 5,1 sound it would be a great release"
,007jamesp,2011-03-27T19:03Z,Nice upload! Great quality :)
