Johnson of The Players Club) of this comedy about two South Central Los Angeles scam artists operating a business in a vacant lot. Working out of their van, Black (Master P) and Blue (Johnson) deal in TV sets and boomboxes, but when a driver mistakenly drops off a cell phone shipment, Black and Blue are ready to dial "C" for cash, bringing in both a local hacker (Anthony Boswell) and sexy Sweet Lorraine (Gretchen Palmer). Business is on the upswing, but then a hood (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.) has a deal go sour and blames Black and Blue. A phone security man (Frantz Turner) and the FBI are also closing in.
