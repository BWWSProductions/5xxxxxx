,kailii,2009-11-23T01:07Z,"What's up with the scene folks?

The first two images of this game were deleted from TPB, one of those was the TiNYiSO one which seems to be released again now and here - but with the same failure that plagued those releases according to my forewriter.

I don't know... When I was young, releases were done RIGHT and WITH PRIDE or not at all.
You know that trying to outsmart legions of script kiddies ain't a good idea, right?

Because if you don't, you might force me out of my retirement. And i might want to play once again.

So bring your shit in order, will you? :)"

I tried to allocate more memory and made it run, only to encounter a trojan which was stopped by AVG. It seems they put a trojan and repacked the exe, but didn't even check if it works. You bring shame to a respected name, sir."

,Donalddln,2010-01-07T15:57Z,"Man you people are out of it! Just extract all using 7-zip and mount using daemon tools, then go to the image directly by going to my computer and right clicking the drive that says vampire hunters and clicking on setup. That's how I got mine to work. "
,Donalddln,2010-01-07T16:00Z,"Oh yeah, and those who said it was a trojan, it's not! I'm sure it was either a false positive because I have the latest version of Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 and it doesn't say that it is. It automatically checks compression files and will automatically tell me if it's a virus if it was."
,divinitymagic,2010-01-18T17:17Z,"This file IS a TROJAN!! Do not trust it, i downloaded it and followed the authors instructions, my Anti-Virus went crazy just prior to my system crashing.!!

DO NOT TRUST"
