,Tanukey8886,2009-11-24T23:41Z,Hi! I have a HUGE collection of these podcasts dating back to Feb 09. I'm trying to upload them to this site as a torrent but it won't let me for the life of me! =[ Someone please comment back and help me share these with everyone! They're all ID3 tagged with album covers and everything and I want to share them!
,MWLshow,2009-11-25T01:00Z,"Check this site out. Try to open up your port for uTorrent or whatever you use, but you may be able to share without doing that.

,MWLshow,2009-11-25T01:01Z,"You obviously wouldn't upload the files, those would be kept on your computer. You would upload a torrent file, which you can create with any client such as uTorrent."
,giantsquid89,2009-11-25T23:50Z,I'll seed this one for a long time. Tanukey please get crackin on getting a torrent up of your collection. I wish I had some to share.
,schlemmo44,2009-11-26T07:07Z,"I've uploaded a torrent of about 880 mb of the Maxwell Show for others that are interested. As this is my first torrent, I hope I did it right!

,Tanukey8886,2009-11-27T04:32Z,"Gah, for some reason it's not letting me upload my torrent file to the site. But I DID manage to get it up on fenopy.com at this url:

http://fenopy.com/torrent/Maxwell_Show_Podcasts/Mjc0MTkwNQ==/download.torrent

If someone who is able to upload to this site could put a mirror of that torrent up here, that's the one I'm hosting right now. =)"
,Tanukey8886,2009-11-27T04:33Z,"fyi, there is about 6 gigs of show in that torrent, so if you take the time to download it, PLEASE keep seeding it for as long as you can so that others can enjoy it as well. Also so that my bandwidth doesn't suffer as much. =)"
,MWLshow,2009-11-30T07:17Z,"tried to mirror Tanukey8886's torrent here (i ended up being the first leech for it), but couldn't successfully do so. the uploader doesn't seem to be working properly. after filling everything in and uploading, only a white screen shows up. tried it in two browers also. will try again in the future."
,Tanukey8886,2009-12-02T05:27Z,"That's exactly what it was doing to me MWLshow. Oh well. To everyone who wants their maxwell show fix, you can pretty much just google ""maxwell show podcasts"" and most of the links lead to different mirrors of the torrent now. It is 6.43 gigs and I will continue to seed it whenever possible."
,MWLshow,2009-12-02T18:56Z,"Trying to find 11/20, their last live broadcast. Let me know if anyone has it."
,MWLshow,2009-12-03T03:54Z,"Nevermind, I think 11/19 and 11/20 were best-of, Tanukey8886, please keep seeding as I still haven't been able to finish downloading, only at 90.3%. I will continue to seed for a longgg time after I'm done."
,Tanukey8886,2009-12-04T23:23Z,"I believe their last live broadcast was 11/13. The next week was all best-of. I remember thinking they were taking vacation or something, hehe. GUESS NOT! :'(

Anyways, I am still seeding this and I'm not planning on stopping, haha. The link in the comments above to fenopy is still valid and until I get a new torrent up here somehow, that is where my torrent file is uploaded to.

FYI to everyone, I seed unlimited weekdays from 6AM-3PM EST as I am at work during those times. So if your downloads during the last 10% or so are slow, it's because I'm home during those times trying to keep my internet from being overloaded. =)"
