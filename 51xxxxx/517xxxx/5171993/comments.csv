,Derc,2009-11-20T19:50Z,"Thanks Groo, I am one also who couldn't get any of the other releases to work. I think it had something to do with my OS being XP. Just not sure and it didn't make sense, works for some but not others?
I have never had a game I couldn't get working... but i guess there is always a first."
[V],Shroo,2009-11-20T20:12Z,"Release is NUKED! Dont download, it uses the same russian crack which is rubish, the game crashes at the loading screen.

Dont try this when your ""legit account is turned on unless u want it banned


client.dll will hold your steam acc footprint details
dunno guess rzr was pretty dum rlsing their l4d2 with their legit client.dll lul
client.dll is ceg protected
if you download the game
and send that file to someone game will crash
since the file is not complete after you run the game for once
it injects the missing bytes + your acc footprint

so if u try it on a legit account it will fuck things up
wonder what client.dll they used"

,tbones187,2009-11-28T08:48Z,"guys listen,

I swear I've download every copy and tried every crack on each l4d2 version. Switched cracks and set every timezone and swapped xp for win 7. No luck. Either crashed at load or a few minutes in.

BUT......

I found that the uncracked, unpatched steam version works fine with a steam emulator
Now im playing single player perfect not one crash.

1. Obtain uncracked, unpatched steam version (I had a friend let me download a unpatched, uncracked version to my pc).
2. installed PacSteam( steam emulator)
3. Made bogus account thru Pacsteam
4. placed whole game inside this directory 
C:\PacSteamT\SteamApps\common\left 4 dead 2

5. add non-steam game; point to the left4dead2.exe

If you download this copy for god sake DON'T patch it or use the crack. JUST USE A STEAM EMULATOR.

hybrid crashes and or cracks just make the game crash, my conspiricy side believes that steam probably posted some bogus cracks/bullcrap patches just to confuse us.
(IF THE CRACK/PATCH WORKS FOR YOU CONGRATS!) 

Haven't tried lan or online gaming though, i couldn't connect to the main servers. Single player works all day."
,Prvmuo,2009-11-29T01:54Z,"@tbones187
I have to thank you.I was trying to find a working crack for hours but what you say is simply what we need for now.

Guys if you downloaded this torrent don't replace the contents or patch the game.
Find original files of L4D2.(there must be 'left4dead2' and 'bin' folder and 'leftfordead2.exe') Ive found from Pacsteam's forum.You may search the game there.Download and replace/overwrite them.
After that you are ready to follow tbones187 instructions.
Ive played for an hour and no crush occured"

,Jerarckill,2009-11-29T13:17Z,"Ok, for all the ones having the game crash right after the intro movie... I had the same problem and found out how to correct it just this morning.  Playing the game since without any problem.

The game seems to connect to some distant server and realizes that it is a cracked version, reason why it stops working right after the intro.  To make it work, just go to the firewall and prevent the exe from using any network... Thought this razor release wasn't working but it wasn't the case...

Hope it helps some of you!"

,jzenman,2009-12-10T06:17Z,Leomacedo's instructions worked for me... Follow his directions if you downloaded this Razor version. The only thing I would add is when you copy the new crack to the installation folder you have to go into and do each file... I think it's the bin folder and Left4Dead folder. Copy the contents of each folder inside the same folder in programs/left4dead. Then the rest of the files inside the main folder. Disconnect the network just in case. Don't use steam. I have it installed but I didn't use it and it worked. Even after the bad witch. Also since it's past the 11/29 or whatever the date thing was you don't have to worry about that.
