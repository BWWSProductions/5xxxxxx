Ruth Shinar, Joseph Shinar, "Organic Electronics in Sensors and Biotechnology"
McGraw-Hill Professional | 2009 | ISBN: 0071596755 | 448 pages | PDF

A detailed guide to the use of organic electronics in sensing applications

Recent progress in the field of organic electronics (OE), combined with the need for versatile, compact, inexpensive, high-throughput, and field-deployable chemical and biological sensors, has led to the development of OE-based sensors. This multi-disciplinary book provides comprehensive information about the growing field of organic electronics and is the first to detail their use in sensing applications.

Organic Electronics in Sensors and Biotechnology features contributors from leading U.S. and international researchers and academics in the OE field. The book will promote innovations in this field at the interface between electrical and computer engineering, physics, material science, chemistry, and biology, contributing to the field's development.
