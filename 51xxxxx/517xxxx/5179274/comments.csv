,cbookfan,2009-11-26T17:06Z,Thanks for the uploads.  Not to nitpick but would it be possible to place all the nonenglish language comics in another folder.
[T],espurious,2009-12-02T15:50Z,"TPB is not accepting this week's torrent, 'DCP and Minutemen Week of 25-11-09 - Complete'.

I'll keep trying to upload it, but in the meantime it can be found here:

,aleela,2009-12-08T16:51Z,"Hi espurious. Big thanks for your weekly gifts! I think that TPB doesn't accept some of your torrents because there are too many files in them. See http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5177139/R.E.M._-_Discography_%281983_-_2008%29_%5BFLAC%5D_-_Kitlope . Uploader Kitlope solves the problem in this way: ""This is a small torrent on how to access the larger 4.91 GB REM - Discography FLAC music torrent. As in the past, the original folder is too big due to the cap TPB has on the amount of files allowed within a torrent. In this small .torrent is the .torrent that you can double click on and will open in your client. Also, theres some links within this small .torrent to a couple other sites where the torrent is posted that, unlike TPB, has no cap."" "
