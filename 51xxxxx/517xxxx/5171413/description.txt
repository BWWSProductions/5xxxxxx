Plot: Every kid imagines what it would be like to be an adult. He wishes he could grow up quicker. Of course, once he grows up, a small part of him wishes he could go back to his 
childhood days. Quite an irony, isn't it? There's a line in AAO WISH KAREIN that goes, 'If you want to be a part of a fairy tale, it's important that you believe in it [fairy tale].
' The statement is applicable for everyone desirous of watching AAO WISH KAREIN.
