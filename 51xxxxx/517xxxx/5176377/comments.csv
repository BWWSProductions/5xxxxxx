,iasthai,2009-11-25T09:45Z,I wonder how many people think this is Ninja Assassin lol.
,203Demon203,2009-11-26T19:21Z,"I was weary of this movie because of the simple name "" Ninja"". I actually did enjoy the movie once I watched it though. The story itself wasn't very good, but the action scenes were cool. I totally wish I had that high tech ninja suit haha."

,pumadizzle1,2009-11-27T20:55Z,i was thinking this might be ninja assassin so i was going to download but maybe i still will
,Vem0th,2009-11-28T01:26Z,"Was first thinking: This movie is soo low budget, I mean no famous actors and complete random writing team.
When I saw it: It was pretty damn impressive.
Really violent movie, good effects and tight drama, and killing fighting scenes.
A/V: 9/10, I recommend subs because sometimes you cant hear what they are saying but...
Movie: 8, It really stuns me that it looks really damn good even its budget. Ninja and kungfo fans will love it."
,adihmme,2009-11-28T11:07Z,I too thought it was Ninja Assassin
,macbookwhite,2009-11-28T12:46Z,"hey thanks much . prolly the 4th time commenting on this for 4 years. 

but this is a really good movie. the action was really moving. didnt think it would be good at all."
,locknkez,2009-11-28T17:26Z,"I too thought it was ninja assassin and said how corney it was due to my expectations.
realizing that this was NINJA (no assassin) it does qualify for  a good B movie with some (I stress) some good action scenes. 
A=10
V=10

IT IS NOT NINJA ASSASSIN
5 0F 10 ON MOVIE SCALE
1........|.........10"
,pegbundy,2009-11-30T08:19Z,I like Martial Art movies so I thought this was an awesome movie. Great action without all of that herky jerky camera stuff the directors have been shoving down out throats. A10 V10....Thanks for the DL
,skylamer,2009-12-01T09:48Z,It's pictured in Bulgaria!
,swd123,2009-12-01T20:31Z,"Nice rip, thanks, "
,jackblackstudio,2009-12-04T11:37Z,6 mins to download this movie. Excellent speed! I'll continue to seeding while I watch it because i'm so impressed. Thnx for the upload. 
,jackblackstudio,2009-12-04T11:42Z,"btw this rip is not widescreen, although i'm not sure if the movie itself is made in widescreen format."
,kaya27,2010-02-10T18:08Z,Scott adkins! Awesome!
,Walliance,2010-09-01T22:01Z,One of the actors in this movie is Scott Adkins... he's such a freakin epic martial arts expert that I gotta see this one :D
,Xthlon,2010-10-14T08:52Z,"dudes... all ur comments made me download this movie... its crap... u promised good fighting... its crap...CRAP I SAY!! Ninja Assassin is better but even thats slightly crap (the blood is MAJOR FAKE BRIGHT RED)...

I will never listen to comments about a movie ever again =P (on a scale of 1-awesome... its 1... but it is fantastic considering its budget and crappness of movies close to its budget...)"
,NagaPower,2010-11-29T04:44Z,totally worthless movie. the only reason i forced myself to watch it was because i wasted time and bandwidth over it!
,illjedi,2011-02-22T08:20Z,good movie.  more should check it out.
,illjedi,2011-02-22T08:21Z,good movie.  more should check it out. 80s feel but well done.  check it out.  better than ninja assasin which is kinda childish compared to many fu flix. although i did dig assasin.  just like violence i guess. 
,uswege,2011-03-14T19:21Z,"xthlon, if you dont like it just say so,n' dont waste your time writing comments that will make some kung fu fan lose interest."
