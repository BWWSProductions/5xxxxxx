However, when I tried to boot it up this morning to watch it, the video wouldn't load at all, I was left staring at a black screen with a totoal time for the movie but it wasn't moving. Do you happen to know why the video wouldn't show up on my player, because I can't see any problems."

Audio is un-synced! Think you'll just fix it by moving the audio back?! THINK AGAIN! The subtitles are hard-subs and are match with the audio! Who the hell thought to do it like this, I don't know!"
,pcharlie,2009-11-30T03:08Z,version 2 of the torrent (with fixed audio and sub sync) here -> http://www.nyaatorrents.org/?page=torrentinfo&tid=100191
,nbtnbt5,2009-12-19T22:39Z,"Don't bother with V2 either, it's still as shitty as the first. Quality is not HQ, plus the korean hardsubs are fucking annoying."
,Tovansky,2010-02-17T17:38Z,"Do not download this! This is not HQ at all. The audio is not in sync. The sub is too big on the screen and the korean hardsub is making it all worse. It's the same as v2. Let's just wait for the better one later. 

Thanks to akaneon for the effort to upload this though. "
,Tovansky,2010-02-17T17:39Z,"@CptWonton Do you use Video Lan / VLC Media Player. My vlc media player can load the file just fine, but this video itself is in bad quality. "
