[T],xybrite,2009-11-22T02:18Z,"What are you talking about ""incomplete""?

Each of the self-contained episodes is complete!

I simply do not have the third episode!

The show is still watchable without the 3rd episode.

Its really bad karma to bite the hands that feed you!

I am doing the best I can, and I am still trying to track down Part 3."
[T],xybrite,2009-11-22T03:04Z,"I have scoured everywhere, and I cannot find episode 3 of the 6 part series.

I do not have a direct pipeline to capture crew RED, so I am out of luck trying to track it down. 

""Goodfilms"" says he has it, but he has failed to post it. 

Please bug ""goodfilms"" about getting the 720p part3 of this series up here, since I would like to have it as well!"
,nonesuitable,2009-12-06T07:22Z,Anyone still looking for the 3rd episode should try bitsnoop

I have episode 3 on my computer.  Tell me how to upload it and I will give it to you.  It is in AVI format.  I have a question for you, how do I convert these files?  I know how to convert RAR but seem to have trouble with these and FLAC files."
