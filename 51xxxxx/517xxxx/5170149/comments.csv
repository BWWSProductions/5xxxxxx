,SnowManUK99,2009-12-28T18:49Z,"Kamidora, please READ the description.

When it was created, as MS release updates every tuesday, this torrent is static.

But if you cannot download from MS (if you have Dial-Up/DSL etc.) you can get this torrent and put onto CD/DVD etc."
,SnowManUK99,2009-12-30T23:09Z,"If you need/want to download via http, then visit http://ap.snowmanuk.net
You can also download older versions of AutoPatcher, and new versions will be released there too."
,SnowManUK99,2010-02-20T19:10Z,"This torrent has been replaced.
Please goto : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5379714 and download Feb 2010 version.
I am NOT seeding this anymore."
