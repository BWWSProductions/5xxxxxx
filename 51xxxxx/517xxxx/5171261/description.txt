Often cited as one of the most innovative and influential rock musicians, guitar legend Jimi Hendrix had a short and turbulent life, succumbing early, as did many other rock icons of his generation, to pressures generated by the conflicts between their creative visions and the economic imperatives of the music industry. He died of an overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. 

This collaborative tribute to Hendrix, described by one of its creators as "not so much outright biography as speculative fantasy," explores the excitement and the pitfalls of rock stardom sympathetically and perceptively. Lavishly and beautifully illustrated by Sienkiewicz (Electra: Assassin), this draws on the layout and narrative style of comic books to recreate Hendrix's life in a more impressionistic manner than standard bios typically permit. Much of the text is drawn from Hendrix's own letters, poetry and lyrics.  Also included is a CD collecting seven previously unreleased tracks written and performed by Hendrix.
