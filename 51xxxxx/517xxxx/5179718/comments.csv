I already downloaded the previous release of this movie by CBGB (haven't watched it yet though), so I would prefer not to re-download if possible."
[V],GoodFilms,2009-11-26T02:36Z,"the repack is EXACTLY the same as the original. the repack was to do with rars, but they are both unrarred. so just get http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5158883/Funny.People.UNRATED.720p.Bluray.x264-CBGB. educu should have realised this."
,cannibalvegetarian,2009-11-26T18:06Z,"The nfo says nothing either. Really just reflects the quality of todays ""scene"".

But as GoodFilm pointed out, the other one is nuked for having corrupt rars meaning the other one is extracted with corrupt data(meaning it should had not been added). It could be that it doesn't show in anyway and largerly depends on your playback device but it could show up as sync going bonkers at some point or just an audio/video glitch at some point."
