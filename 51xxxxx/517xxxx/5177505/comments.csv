,Zenophobe,2010-01-01T22:22Z,This version worked for me on Win7 x64.  Had the same problems that PrOzAc_UsEr was having with ChattChitto's version... patched exe kept crashing no matter where I placed the keygen/patch file.
,donkeydick121,2010-02-06T02:42Z,"Been using v5 for 2 or 3 years now.

This one's even better.

Everyone should sack Media Player and use this.

It's the best."
,donkeydick121,2010-02-06T02:43Z,P.S. Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 found this was perfectly clean.

Sometimes download a new version and overwrite the crack, so you have to replace the crack often."
