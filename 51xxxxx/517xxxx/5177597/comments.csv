,texassy,2009-11-25T06:00Z,Any publicity is good publicity. You didn't see the winner of American Idol in the news this week. What was his name again? ;)

,hurlyburlesque,2009-11-26T13:07Z,So. Hot.
,freakindawg,2009-11-27T05:03Z,@zmacdaddy8 But I'll get you love Madonna!
,freakindawg,2009-11-27T05:20Z,It works fine in VLC.
,JMitch,2009-11-28T07:12Z,"Thank you for this! Quality is amazing! Tested in Windows Media Player and VLC.. both works great.

I'm glad people are pointing out the Madonna/Brittany kiss.

Adam is a good entertainer, that's for sure."
