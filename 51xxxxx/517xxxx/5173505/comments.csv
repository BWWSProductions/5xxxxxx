,toastysoul,2009-12-12T00:06Z,"@ madhadder Don't be ignorant. Even keygens that do have a virus usually give you a working key. Try running the keygen in an sandbox (a.k.a virtual machine) if you are afraid of a virus instead of freaking out on the uploader. There are other even more secure alternatives like booting an old machine (sans HDDs) to a livecd, then running the keygen from a usb stick, writing down the serial, hard-wipe the usb stick, etc. "
