              Raxco PerfectSpeed PC Optimizer 2.0.0.112

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

PerfectSpeed is the first product to combine multiple enterprise-class performance-enhancing tools in one easy-to-use suite for the casual PC user â€” a Microsoft-certified disk defragmentation and optimization tool, safe registry cleaner, duplicate file remover, military-strength file shredder and powerful privacy protection all in one. And itâ€™s automated, which makes it easy for the novice user, but also others who desire these capabilities from a vendor they can trust.

If you know PerfectDisk, you know how the optimization and defragmentation is addressed - in a top-quality manner that is certified by Microsoft. Sticking to the â€œkeep it simpleâ€ approach, the boot time defrag is not part of PerfectSpeed, as well as some of the detailed reporting. But all the rest of the powerful engine is there, including the Space Explorer visual file and folder map.

It provides a complete space reclamation facility to remove duplicate files, temporary internet files, temporary user and system files, and even user-defined files. You not only get valuable space back, but also improved performance from the removal of all those unecessary files.

PerfectSpeed provides a safe registry cleaner, with safe being the operative word. Sure, there a bunch of freeware registry cleaners and others that do everything but create errors in an attempt to â€œfindâ€ as many problems and â€œerrosâ€ as possible - the higher the numbers, the better they â€œlookâ€ - until you often find yourself in trouble because theyâ€™ve overextended themselves. As with PerfectDisk, itâ€™s all about quality, safety and assurance with PerfectSpeedâ€™s registry cleaner.

Another key area of PerfectSpeed is privacy protection. While not directly linked to speed, it IS directly linked to a safe and secure PC environment. Every keystroke you make is tracked by the computer and continually storing your history on your hard drive. Like it or not, youâ€™re accumulating a detailed record of all your internet activity - every image, video and program viewed, sent, downloaded or received. Just what a lot of bad guys want to know. Online banking, PayPal transactions, cookies you donâ€™t want â€” all ripe for the taking. And for files you want gone â€” really gone â€” PerfectSpeed includes a military-strength file shredder.

And finally, thereâ€™s a neat little Tweak tool for setting various Windows performance, security and appearance settings.

Itâ€™s all wrapped up in one simple, automated, easy-to-use package. From the ones many love, some like, and others donâ€™t know ofâ€¦.but millions trust.
