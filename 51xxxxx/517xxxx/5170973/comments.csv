What are you talking about ""incomplete""?

Each of the self-contained episodes is complete!

I simply do not have the third episode!

The mini-series is still watchable without the 3rd episode.

Its really bad karma, NotTthePokerDude, to bite the hands that feed you!

I took my good time to upload these episodes, which I didn't have to do.

The mini-series is still very viewable without episode 3 of the series.

I am doing the best I can to track down Part 3.

Rather than complaining, NotTthePokerDude, you too could try to search out people with the episode 3 torrent, since I know it was captured, but apparently has not been widely released."
[T],xybrite,2009-11-22T03:05Z,"I have scoured everywhere, and I cannot find episode 3 of the 6 part series.

I do not have a direct pipeline to capture crew RED, so I am out of luck trying to track it down. 

""Goodfilms"" says he has it, but he has failed to post it. 

Please bug ""goodfilms"" about getting the 720p part3 of this series up here, since I would like to have it as well!"
