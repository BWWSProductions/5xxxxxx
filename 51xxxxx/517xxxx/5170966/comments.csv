,Davomartinez,2009-11-30T06:00Z,"DrDumb, thanks for the downloads.  I come here when they do a 'Best of' and my Audible.com has a old show and not the ""Best of'. 

Thanks thanks thanks!!!

BTW,  Do you have the shows for Nov. 26th and 27th? :) I found some recordings here for those dates but on the 26th it looks like the first 1.5 hours are repeated after the 1.5 hour.  And the 27th seems to be the same show (26th) with the guy from Cash Cab but it ends abruptly."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-12-01T00:33Z,"Davomartinez - 

Just found out they aired the Thanksgiving day show again on the 27th, so even if the 26th is screwed upped the 27th should be the whole Thanksgiving show. Not sure why it just starts and stops mid sentence, poor editing I guess. "
