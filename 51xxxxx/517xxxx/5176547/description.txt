Enclosed within this archive are the images from the two discs
included in the Network+ certification kit.

To view them, either burn or mount using something like magicISO.

This is primarily aimed at people who want to become network technicians
or system administrators, but is a good read non-the-less.

Someone out there shared the A+ materials with the world when I could not
afford to buy them, Me sharing this Network+ is my way of saying thank you.

Please SEED this on 1:1, As far as I could find this guide is not being shared
anywhere else.
