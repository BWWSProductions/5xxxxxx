Workbench Guide to Semiconductor Circuits and Projects

by Michael Gannon

Here is a unique collection of over 100 easy-to-follow, integrated circuit-based projects that are not only fascinating to build but produce extremely useful devices.
	Imagine your satisfaction at the workbench building such intriguing devices as electronic flypaper ... a handy 2-way intercom ... a super stereo preamp ... a sound microscope ... a working lie detector ... a sun-powered electric generator ... a pushbutton switch that "remembers" ... and even a complete home intrusion alarm system.
	Plus, you get a host of practical suggestions that simplify: improvements for your workbench ... wiring and soldering ... breadboarding ... safety procedures ... obtaining low-cost parts ... reading schematic diagrams ... and more.
	Your success is virtually guaranteed because of the detailed, step-by-step construction procedures. Best of all, every called-for part is listed under the industry-wide "generic" coding system and is readily available from parts supply houses.
