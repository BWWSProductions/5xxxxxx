Personnel: Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew (vocals, guitar); Terry Bozzio (vocals, drums); Tommy Mars, Peter Wolf (keyboards); Patrick O'Hearn (bass); Ed Mann (percussion); Roy Estrada.Digitally remastered by Bob Stone (1988, Utility Muffin Research Kitchen).The soundtrack to Zappa's "movie about people who do stuff that is not normal" features some of the man's trademark musical madness: quirky shifts of time signatures, style and mood, sterling instrumental work (featuring drummer Terry Bozzio, guitar ace Adrian Belew and '60s Zappa cohort Roy Estrada). The record is full of boisterous, sarcastic and sometimes soulful singing and Zappa continues his ruthless public defacement of all things shallow, greedy and vacuous in modern society. Warning: your parents might not like some words on this album. If you're a devoted Zappa fan, these early-'80s recordings are a must-have.
