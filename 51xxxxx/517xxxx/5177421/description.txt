        Hilary Duff stars as Greta, a 17-year-old girl struggling with
        feelings of suicide. Pushed  aside by her mother  Karen, Greta
        goes off to her  grandparents (Ellen Burstyn, Michael  Murphy)
        in Ocean Grove for the summer...against her will. She makes it
        known that she  wants to kill  herself during the  summer, and
        compiles a book of suicide methods. It's not until Greta falls
        for the short-order  cook (Evan Ross)  at the diner  where she
        works, and realizes that people care for her fate, that things
        change.
