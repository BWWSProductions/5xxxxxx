I am reseeding this torrent, as the version I was finally able to get took forever to download and has virtually no seeders at this point.  I feel this music, from one of the most underrated Alternative Rock bands of the 1990s, deserves to be heard.

This torrent includes all official releases by the band Dada.  The album list is as follows:

Puzzle (1992)
American Highway Flower (1994)
El Subliminoso (1996)
dada (1998)
Live Official Bootleg (Vol. 1) (2003)
How to Be Found (2004)
A Friend of Pat Robertson (2006)

All of these releases are currently out of print, and that's a damn shame....
