The Seattle-based rock trio is up to their usual antics of ground-breaking lyric writinâ€™, indie-rockinâ€™, and rule breakinâ€™. Pretty big stuff for a band that named themselves after humble rodents. Starting at the heels of the grunge movement and the periphery of its epicenter, Modest Mouse wowed fans with atypical titles, lyrics and musical arrangements. The near-drunken cadence of lead vocalist Isaac Brock, rock-steady drum beats of Jeremiah Green and groovalicious bass lines of Eric Judy combine to form music unprecedented, anomalous, and singularly melodic.

Pickinâ€™ On Modest Mouse is a masterful tribute to these indie greats. The banjo and guitar riffs on this cd will send chills down your spine; Modest Mouseâ€™s music is transformed into bluegrass best described as uncanny rock. Where words may not adequately describe this musical extravaganza, listening is certain to do the trick. Donâ€™t you worry, youâ€™ll all float on with this mind-blowing tribute you hold in your hands.
