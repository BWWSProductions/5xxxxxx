,Guffen99,2009-11-21T23:31Z,Have enyone tried to burn this to a DVD? I get the folowing mesage from Nero: Required: 4 567MB Total on disc: 4 489MB. 
,Henriiiiette,2009-11-28T10:34Z,"How do you burn this down to a DVD? Nero says it cant read the files :/ Please help, im not a nerd yet ;)"
,uffesnuffe,2010-01-12T14:34Z,"As Guffen says above it is impossible to burn this to a DVD5. DVDShrink would not open the unRARed file and neither could I access the content with DVDFabdecrypter. Perhaps it will work if you burn it to a DVD9, but why risk a DL-disc? I finally deleted the download."
