Description:
If you're looking for that perfect slow hand CD to carry around in the car, Time Pieces is the disc for you. Featuring 11 of Clapton's most radio-friendly hits ("I Shot the Sheriff," "After Midnight," and "Layla," of course), this CD also offers up some of Clapton's most romantic moments in "Wonderful Tonight" and his most cynical in "Promises." Though there's nothing here that you don't have on another couple of discs, Time Pieces is a convenient package of great hits that make you want to roll down the windows, crank up the stereo, and roll.
