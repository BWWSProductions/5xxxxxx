I guess I will =-(. It's really the only way to get hits on here though, especially when people want light, simple to use alternatives to heavier newer software. *shrugs.

,doubledge,2009-11-26T05:52Z,"@k-kid AND  @fuwad84:
This is in reference to your comment:
""Stop all your self-promoting spams on others uploads if you don't wish to get banned"".

WOULD YOU PLEASE BE SO KIND TO EXPLAIN THIS ""VIOLATION OF RULES"" THAT COULD RESULT IN A ""BAN""?

This is important to me (and should be to others as well) since most of us TPB users enjoy the service & don't want to wind up BANNED!

I ask for clarity here because I don't see anything really wrong with this post. (well, I CAN see how some might take offense to the style and language used here, but it don't bother me none, plus how many old ""Grannies"" really visit this site?).

As for the ""self-promoting spams on others uploads"", I just don't see anything wrong here!

First of all, ""fuwad84"" clearly states:
""SHOUT OUTS TO MY FAVORITE SHIT ON TPB""
""(i didn't write any of this but I TOTALLY AGREE a MUST GET!!!)""
""Keep in mind I wouldn't be giving a shout out to it if I didn't use it myself.""
THOSE STATEMENTS MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR (to me) THAT THESE ARE LINKS TO OTHER PEOPLES RELEASES and although the descriptions might be ""colored"" with fuwad84's ""Style"", I don't see any other ""Self-Promoting"" offenses. In fact, other than stating that he uses and recommends these programs, I find no other personal references here.

IS IT REALLY WRONG TO SAY:
""HERE'S A LINK TO SOMEONE ELSE'S RELEASE THAT I REALLY LIKE & FIND VALUABLE""?
OR:
Is it just wrong to post any links here?

What DOES bother me a whole lot is that there are SO MANY glory-seeking fools that steal other folks releases, re-pack them (or just rename them) and then post 'em as their OWN!
Apparently, there are those who go to great lengths to change enough shit to make it APPEAR to be different - when it's NOT, and then again, there are lots of simple-minded slugs who think that just RENAMING other releases is good enough - AND THEY ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IT WAY TOO MUCH! 

SHOULDN'T YOU BE WARNING (AND BANNING) THESE GUYS?

Once again, if you can explain exactly what is wrong with this post, I would greatly appreciate it... I certainly wouldn't want to get BANNED over a simple misunderstanding of the rules here.
THANKS!

,fuwad84,2009-12-20T11:03Z,"I've taken a look into it a bit further, seems like some versions will still update just fine others won't. 

My Advise: let it update entirely on its own. If it doesn't update like after a whole week than restart your computer. If that doesn't work than re-run the patcher and restart your computer.

Like I said every so often Esets update servers do some funky shit that they think will help them rid the pirates. After a few days they give up after lots and lots of  legit customers complain that they can no longer update...and thus a pirate is born. "

,Dakwonju,2010-01-01T17:36Z,"Hey Fuwad, so I chose to DL this version instead of JMB's one since it sounds more hassle free. Only problem when I DL it, McAfee finds Generic.dx Trojan and removes it right away.

Do you know what this is about? I understand McAfee isn't the best out there, it just came as free subscription. But I know NOD32 is great, anyhow let me know what the deal is with the trojan, cause right now I am at a pause as to what to do with this file. Thanks!"
,cranswick,2010-01-01T18:59Z,"Dear fuwad84
My 'PB' version of AVG8 recentlywent tits up - and came across your upload. Never used Nod before but it seems to be doing what it says on the tin!
Thank You."
,Dakwonju,2010-01-01T19:02Z,"To all downloading this, I did some research into the Generic.dx Trojan, that was detected by AVG when I tried to DL this. 

It's recognized as a malicious threat that compromises your privacy, a Tech Forum said that it's best not to do any banking/personal info online when this is detected.

So sorry Fuwad, I am not trying to screw you over, but unless you can clarify this matter, everyone should stay away from this download."
,Dakwonju,2010-01-01T19:04Z,"Just a correction, I don't have AVG, I have McAfee which detected the Generic.dx Trojan on  this file."
,fuwad84,2010-01-01T23:21Z,"Dear Dakwonju,

Thank you for downloading and trying Eset Nod32. As for the issues you've described, there are significant things you should know before posting. 

First, Generic.dx is not actually a virus rather its the A/V industry's way of picking on so called 'hack ware'. Notice the name its self as proof. 

Second most A/V software will detect the NOD32fix.reg file as  a 'malware' but a 'hack tool' more specifically. If I was running an A/V company why wouldn't I list a patch that gives you unlimited updates as bad. 

I've listed the virustotal upload file and you'll notice that by both NOD32 and another company its listed as a 'hackA/V' 

http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/196f76d058b21c1e23c28d4c71a4736cb0be5d9be54e24340ebb351dfcf3e8eb-1252553051

Third, sounds to me like you have sufficient A/V software as is, you clearly rely on it more so than anything else, even when its obviously lying to you. 

Finally, Thank you for all your hard work, however please to refrain from posting anymore comments as they are not needed, misguiding and stupid.

Thank you

-fuwad84

P.S. Shut the fuck up"
,Dakwonju,2010-01-02T20:48Z,"LOL ok, well at least we cleared it up since others might be wondering the same when they download it. So really you should thank me for that in the very least. 

After what you said, I looked up win32/hackAV.G and it seems that it is as you said, it's them detecting the fix as a virus or hackware. And that it's not harmful. Like I said, hopefully now people will recognize this post and will not ask the same question again.

Thanks.

P.S. Fuck You Too =P"

....wow kid you're an idiot-I MEAN-Good for you! 

hmmm yeah checkn it out now, if it still dont werk go click on update>setup>sever list> click on add and when it asks you paste in http://nod32.nod325.com as a new server than hit OK. basically your setting up that server as your update server. I'm not gonna lie I hate the idea of getting pirated anti-virus updates from a rogue Chinese server so try to keep an updated version of malware on hand at all times, jus incase. 

If that don't work try Finders nod32 3.0 its a bit heavier but it works well

Well bitches, its like my dad used to say ""taking a shit feels best when its on a bitches chest"". and right now that turd of truth is steaming away on the torso of reality. 

This is something I myself a proud pirate thought id never be saying and definitely thought id NEVER be doing. For you see bitches, I have not been using Eset for an entire week for the first time in 3+ years. Thats because I have found something better - like the first time getting a finger in the bum it feels so odd and strange but after a while you can't get anywhere with out it and cant even remember how things were before. 

Of course I'm referring to Avast! 5 free edition. You download it, click register, put what ever the hell you want and you have free a/v for an entire year until you have to re-register doing the same exact thing i just told you to do. Be sides having a MUUUUCH better detection rate than ESET this damn this is also HALF THE MOTHER FUCKING SIZE as far as ram usage goes! I thought at first it wasnt working, it only uses 16mb of ram on average. best part is no cracking, no hacking the damn thing has everything you'd ever need in a a/v with semi-firewall (or whatever that damn thing is)

Dont take my brainwashed word for it, install it in your nearest virtual machine - or your moms computer when shes not home (and sent me photos of her)


Its good enough for me and therefore its good enough for you! Now shut the fuck up, and get it before you meet the back of my hand!
