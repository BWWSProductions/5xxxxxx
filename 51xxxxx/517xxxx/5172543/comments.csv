,laci643,2009-11-21T13:19Z,DVD verzió nincs? Jób lenne mint a kész img fájl. Akkor XT-hez is lehetne használni.

I'm gona mis this a lot because the big money-making-corporations are, of course, going to win this battle."
,mapaboy,2010-03-07T22:14Z,"So how do I use this? I download it, follow the steps and then put it onto an sd card and stick it into the GPS?"

,BreakingTheLaw,2010-07-13T14:44Z,I just got this working on my Garmin Oregon 450.nnHere is what I did:n1. Get a 4GB+ microSD card (I used an 8 GB KINGSTON MicroSDHC CLASS 4) and stick it in the Oregon.n2. Connect Oregon to computer using USB cable.

,BreakingTheLaw,2010-07-13T14:47Z,This comment system is fucked. I can\'t post helpful urls and the formatting is all screwed up.
,dustbite,2010-07-28T15:13Z,"Just one comment, I have a GPSMAP 60CSx and I also use Mobile PC sometimes. 
In contrast to the info below I did manage to get the TOPO map to work in combination with MobilePC. Perhaps because I selected a partial map (?2GB)"
,dustbite,2010-08-03T11:47Z,"Hi Nincsenex,
This map does not contain rivers which strikes me as very odd.
Is there anyway to migrate rivers from, for example,  CN maps into this topo map? Or can you point me in the right direction, perhaps a programmer solved this problem already.

Anyway, thanks again for the many, many exellent uploads.
Dustbite"
,sirn,2010-10-02T09:40Z,Installed this on a Kingston 4GB microSDHC card and put that in my Garmin Edge 605. It took a couple of minutes to start the unit the first time. After that it works like a charm. Thank you Nincsenex.
,Myrings12,2011-08-09T14:13Z,Does this work in a car navigation system ?
