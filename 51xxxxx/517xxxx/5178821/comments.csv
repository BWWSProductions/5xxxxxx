,GLR457mAn,2009-12-06T19:53Z,"well at game ranger you can controll on who you want to play with or not. wile in the game room (you host rooms) you can kick & or block ppl you feel that use's hacks or not before you launch the game. also you can have allow later joins on/off if you wish. alot better way of dealing with the noob hackers.

im also a legit gamer my self & have kicked a few ppl out after asking em to leave me alone with there hacks & hacked items.. & in case you didnt know diablosight is what that is. it shows you if players has hacked items equips & dupes & stuff. tho it only seems to work when you host a game. i tryed using it wile joining some ones game & it doesnt seem to work. anyways hope this helps ;-)"

I'd really like to be able to play online with this and as I understand it you need that patch to do so."
