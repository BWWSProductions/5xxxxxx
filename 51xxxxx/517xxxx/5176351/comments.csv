Could you perhaps upload a movie called ""The kingdom of Heaven"", it has Orlando Bloom as a main actor and has a great story. Btw It's one of the best movies after LOTR."

I WANT YOUR BABIES!!!"
,smellmy,2010-02-12T03:06Z,"@anti pirate guy

Trust me, you dont want to upload videos.  It's just plain stupid.  But if you are trying to do it for personal use,  use magic DVD ripper.  I get 480p quality and it looks hella sexy on my 64 inch tv.  So yea.  "
,iiiratep,2010-06-21T04:31Z,"Quite possibly the lamest movie I've ever seen.
Nice quality rip though."
