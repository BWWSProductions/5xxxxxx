[V],-jonny-,2009-11-22T10:46Z,no. but the dialogue is entirely english..
,smile9999,2009-11-23T09:32Z,"thanks alot for this up man, I been looking for a good quality for this movie for sometime"
,soniqeve,2009-11-24T12:39Z,"thank you very much, another great upload!"
,soniqeve,2009-11-24T12:41Z,"btw, any word on The Game on bluray?"
[V],-jonny-,2009-11-24T16:34Z,use www.blu-ray.com to search for blu-ray releases. the game is not available yet.
,farkstick,2009-11-24T17:14Z,"@ -jonny-
you stated in the SiNNERS comments (Fight.Club.1999.PROPER.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS) that your upload is much better quality.  how is that if the video bit rates are basically identical and the audio is the same?"
,soniqeve,2009-11-24T19:20Z,"@jonny: don't get me wrong, i know about bluray.com and check there fairly often, but (for example) if you search for district 9 and inglourious basterds it will tell you that those aren't out yet, but there are bluray releases available from you. :)"
[V],-jonny-,2009-11-25T01:10Z,"farkstick. it's much better quality because the source is much better quality. the other rips are from the german blu-ray of last year, which was shite quality."
,justin131,2009-11-25T10:17Z,"Once again, jonny with the best around. This is one of the few I wanted to buy. Commentary on this one is fantastic.

,diyabetarip,2010-08-30T23:59Z,maybe it's ok for you but for me a guy who paste himself in a movie (like at 7:34) is an asshole
