I'm not sure I uploaded these correctly.  
They're showing up as having peers connected in uTorrent, but I'm not seeing any percentages there, and there are no leechers showing here, either.  
Let me know if there's something I need to be doing.  It's been a very long time since I uploaded anything, and it was onto Demonoid, which was a whole lot easier and straight forward.  
THANKS!"
