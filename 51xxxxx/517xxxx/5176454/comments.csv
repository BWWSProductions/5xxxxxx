Wouldn't it be possible to make a pre-cracked vers of Diskeeper 2010 ?"
,topcat787,2009-11-24T01:55Z,Diskeeper 2010? this is Acronis True Image Home.
[V],Murlok,2009-11-24T12:51Z,jersson nobody done it yet.I have 2010 on one desktop and the old 2008 premier on the other since this now worked for 2 years:) But Using O&O Defrag 11 pro editon since its faster:)
,786dragon,2009-11-24T18:27Z,thanks murlok
,knownassociate,2009-11-24T20:48Z,"Thank you Murlok, this rounds out my Acronis suite:D
"
[V],Murlok,2009-11-24T22:09Z,knownassociate  you see I did it again lost my VIP but not my name later at the other place :)

,paraf,2009-11-27T14:04Z,"Thanks Murlok - great product
How do you get PlusPack?
is it builtin & if so do you activate with that seperate key? Thanks"
[V],Murlok,2009-11-30T12:19Z,paraf  not included but you have the serial.So look after it Its a boot cd and stuff like that. But a boot CD you can create with this program yourself :)
,chard0919,2009-12-08T15:13Z,is this better version than your first acronis upload??? tnx 4 the up BTW....
,dsrs,2009-12-10T11:41Z,many thanks. but what is to stop acronis from banning these serials? will it not just stop working after 30 days like all the other trials?
,dima-,2009-12-20T19:46Z,"On Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit, the setup file wouldn't run, even w/the ""Run as administrator"" option. No way to install."
,gigahertz21,2009-12-22T09:19Z,"Program worked great for me, but where do we get the PlusPack from?  I see that you included the serial for it, but there is no torrent for the PlusPack, and you can't download a trial of it from the Acronis website so what good is a serial if we can't find it?

Thanks for upload, great software!

Anybody know where to get the PlusPack from?"
,teddyvash,2009-12-22T16:51Z,This is great!!!! Thanks Murlock
,dsrs,2010-01-09T17:18Z,"you say 'tested and working'. sure it is, as a trial version. but acronis bans all such serials and then you cannot either use the backup or the restore functions. so what good is it, except for a few weeks"
,mariusjr,2010-01-19T20:08Z,"I installed this on a Windows 7.
seems to work, I make a backup and a bootcd.
But.. seems I can't boot from this CD ? It's not working.

I hope the backup I make will be good at least..."
,BeastKovu,2010-02-15T06:20Z,"@dsrs Why would you say that? Not like it has online activation or needs net access to do its job. If it does phone home for blacklisted serials (doubt it does) then you can just block it with a firewall.

They'd only really blacklist it in updates so it should stay working with the exe in this torrent forever."
,dsrs,2010-04-05T13:36Z,"it clearly does dial home, as messages from people indicate...you set it up and then two weeks later it stops working because of invalid serial
and you cannot stop it because you do not know to which url it is connecting
at any rate, every time i have tried one of these it has eventually failed. and then your backups are worse than useless

trying to remove from windows 7 often crashes windows requiring complete reinstall. happened to me and if you read the messages in similar torrents it has happened to others

NOBODY has posted a message saying they can 
1. boot from cd
2. made scheduled backups
3.  restore those backups
AFTER a period of 30 days

would be great if it worked but it does not"
,fieldof,2010-04-16T11:20Z,"Yes, it tries to phone home.  The publishers don't want you to use their software for free.  

If you want to be a thief, you must learn to think like one:  Use a firewall."
,Knackboy,2010-05-31T17:13Z,"+1 Quality
Working 100%"
,program1956,2010-07-08T00:01Z,Thanks!! Works!!!
