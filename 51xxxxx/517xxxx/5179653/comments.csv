,geburha,2009-12-21T21:34Z,this is only in italian >.>
,tsrejca,2010-01-01T22:39Z,this is also in english langugage ... if you are watching it with VLC player run the .mkv file and then just right click on the image and the menu will appear then click Audio -> Audio Track and there you will see it two options which one of them is for english langugage
,SraGreen,2010-01-27T22:05Z,"Good film, but did anyone else have issues with the English audio? It cuts out for me about two minutes in, and it never comes back."

,somedude.1001,2010-02-11T13:20Z,"I can confirm that the English track is perfect.

Can't tell for sure if video is scaled-up 720p or actual 1080p.

Overall: nerd-p0rn, must watch."

,dGeneration,2010-03-16T07:36Z,"Actually, I had some glitches with the sound too.  Most of it was perfect, but there were some jitters in a few parts."
,somedude.1001,2010-04-01T20:30Z,"install codecs, open with vlc etc... it might jitter if your computer is low spec"
,Chemtrack,2010-05-08T09:56Z,Damn what a great movie!! But its with Alec baldwin. I cant find the movie fullhd with Pertwee. Not even on amazon
,la085,2010-05-12T19:43Z,Amazing Movie guys don't miss it. I'd give it 10/10 for the movie. I'm sure the quality of this rip is amazing as well.

I will seed this for life :)
PS: You can use mkv2vob to make English the only language on the mkv file, then play through ps3media server on you tv/projector (thats what I do :)"
