                    Dan.                                     
                    A darkly comic drama series written by Jack  
                    Thorne telling the story of six disabled  
                    characters sent to a remote British island for  
                    a fictional reality TV show. Six-months in a  
                    wheelchair, Dan is sweet, slightly naive, and  
                    liable to have his pants nicked and stuffed  
                    into a postbox. Or at least he is when he's  
                    playing with the local wheelchair basketball  
                    team. Dan arrives on the island and meets the  
                    other Cast Offs for the first time. He begins a  
                    journey that will involve quite a few bumps in  
                    the road. Particularly with Carrie, who is  
                    three-foot-tall, but has an ego the size of a  
                    small country, and she seems to be able to read  
                    Dan's mind. This is going to be quite some  
                    ride...
