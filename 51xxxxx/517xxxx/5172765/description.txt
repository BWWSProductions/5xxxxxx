OFFICIAL DMBLIVE RELEASE [256k MP3]

DMB performed a free concert in Norfolk alongside the Elizabeth River to a group of ecstatic fans, many of whom were being introduced to DMB for the first time that April afternoon. The crowd was definitely having a good time as evidenced by the recording. The entire show is a highlight. Our favorite tracks are The Best of Whatâ€™s Around, Warehouse, Tripping Billies and Minarets.
