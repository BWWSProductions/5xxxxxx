Jeff Beck live at Ronnie Scott's club in London is taken right off the DVD9 and split into music tracks using DVD Decrypter.   This is my 3rd seed using NO TRACKER and the DHT function built into most modern clients.

Make sure your Distributed Database and tracker are switched on and also that you can act as a server to host the swarm files which you download.   Welcome to the future of file share.  If you are getting this then you have DHT working - just check you can make torrents as well with no tracker, just DHT.
