Insane/bizarre animated series about, what else, a pot smoking deer. Existentialistic and ridiculous and 4th-wall-breaking and a perfect watch for an afternoon herbal treat. Really should be on adult swim. This is series 1 and was created by Adam Cooley and Sea Monster 3D. Periodically, these two will combine their powers to make 6 episodes, so expect another series before the world ends.
