This Chinese novel is believed to be semi-autobiographical, mirroring the family fortunes and a memorial to the women of his youth: friends, relatives and servants.

The novel is remarkable not only for its huge cast of characters and psychological scope, but also for its precise and detailed observation of the life and social structures typical of 18th-century Chinese aristocracy.
