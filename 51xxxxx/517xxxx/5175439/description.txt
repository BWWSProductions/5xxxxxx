Review:
This is the debut effort from this talented Swedish quartet. Songs like "We Want It All", "Confirm The Action", "The Wasted" and "Love Affection" really jam! "Bring Me To Heaven" and "Open Your Eyes" slow things down a few notches. 
  The musicianship is very solid throughout the album, as Seven Wishes struts through their Dokken and TNT inspired version of heavy metal. Seven Wishes are an excellent example of melodic metal, I give it two thumbs up!
