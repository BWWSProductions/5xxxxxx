,LuckyCharms,2009-12-02T04:57Z,Thanks! This is much better than the other version. The only thing that would have made this better would be if there was some kind of distinction between storylines that are within the same chapters. Takes a second to realize it's switched characters. But this is a lot easier to read!
[T],momamedienta,2009-12-02T05:33Z,"Thanks LuckyCharms!  I'm still new to this but I'm learning fast.  I am currently working on a full set of WoT in pdf including all the prequels.

Thanks everyone for seeding!"
,ssylex,2009-12-03T03:42Z,"Best version yet! Any chance you can get the little pictures from the start of each chapter in? It was one of the only good things about the original pdf file (with the terrible alignment). Get those pictures in, and it'd be perfect. :)"
