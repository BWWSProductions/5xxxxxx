,wtcls123,2009-11-30T16:57Z,Thanks for this great torrent. Must have cost you a lot of time and effort. It will be great to see those flicks again after so many years.
,aashman,2009-12-02T18:33Z,"Thanks wtcls123

It is guys like you, who take a moment and thank which makes this all worthwhile.... 
Hey again the oldest refrain on the Torrent Scene.. Please do SEED as long as you can so that others can enjoy these screen gems !

Any suggestions on the next series you guys would like to see here next ! "
,wtcls123,2009-12-12T17:42Z,I would be very grateful if you could opload Tony Hancocks tv-shows.
,michschu1,2009-12-23T01:14Z,"Well from the look of it itself can see that it must have taken great pains to get this thing done, and trust me I know how painful it is to sit for hours on end at a computer.  Hats off and Thanks a Lot Dude.  Stuff like this is a rarity and its a definite keeper.  Just wish I get the complete thing downloaded and more dudes find this torrent to start downloading and also help in seeding this amazing classic act.  Thanks once again from the bottom of my heart and this effort is definitely highly appreciated... Take care and God Bless You and Your Family... Merry X'Mas and Happy New Year too.  hope this downloads by new year so I can enjoy too ; )"

,table543,2010-10-21T03:00Z,Great collection!! I too want to say how much I appreciate all the work and effort in creating this torrent. Thank you so much for giving your time and effort!!
,aCe_vEnTuRa2,2011-01-11T14:35Z,"Its taking ages to d/l as I think the download speed is capped to 25 kBs. Its seems to take ages to get the thing d/l, I hv spent about 4-5 days and am still at 37% and guess what, I am not d/l every file only some of the files.......
But I would like to appreciate the uploader for his hard work and all who are genuinely seeding even after d/l  is complete"
,aCe_vEnTuRa2,2011-01-11T14:38Z,"Buddy, if its not too much to ask.... do U have The Lucy show ? Here's Lucy/I love Lucy etc. ? If so can U pls upload. Thanks"
,mizzllat,2011-01-27T19:50Z,"Just a quick thought, but for any of you talented Uploaders out there, if any of you have the entire 31 film series, covering from 1958- 1992, as well as the 1998 documentary, along with any of the later TV and Christmas specials, that would be a truly most excellent torrent to create for the rest of we ""Carry On..."" lovers, especially those of us stuck living in the States.  (Including the ""Oh! What A Carry On!"" album would be an extra-special bonus, too!)"
,Rapier_Wit,2011-01-29T18:56Z,"If you ever check back on comments, HUGE thanks to you, bud."
,aCe_vEnTuRa2,2011-02-02T20:45Z,"You know what... the ones who have downloaded em... and not seeding ... are such bastards that they do not vene know if their mother has borne their siblings with virtue of their own fathers or maybe a mule in some unknown Country.....its pathetic to have such people here.....
Thanks to the uploader and who ever (3 others who have their efforts in seeding) for their efforts... "
,aCe_vEnTuRa2,2011-02-02T20:48Z,"Bloody Maachod's and behenchods pathetic parasites...if everyone was like U we would never get anything...
I want toi thank the uploader and whoever has taken effort to seed... I love U all... may god bless U... and rest all... may devil chod you in hell"

Waste of time..."
