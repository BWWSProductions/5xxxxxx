After Effects CS4 features a new operator for shape layers: Wiggle Transform. This useful tool can automatically animate the anchor point, position, rotation, and scale of a layer without having to use expressions or animation presets. In After Effects CS4: Wiggle Transform Tips, Chris and Trish Meyer present helpful advice for using Wiggle Transform to its full potential. For example, they show how to combine it with the Repeater operation to create writhing, pulsing, wiggling masses of automatically animating shapes.
