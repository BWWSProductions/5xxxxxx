Best one yet (actually DLing something now).
I WILL seed this for as long as I'm able."

Good stuff, this."
,tsqtsq,2009-12-14T15:43Z,"The only reason I know of to rar a video file is to hide the fact that it's not what it claims to be.
rar files discourage seeding as I need to have a duplicate copy to use, and while disk space may be cheap, it's not free & I don't want to have duplicates if I can avoid it.
A plain video file will get seeded, a rar will be deleted as soon as I can extract the video.
A rar (or any other compression) can finish up taking more space than the original of a highly compressed file like video or jpg"
