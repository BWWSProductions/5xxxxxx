,steelersno1,2011-04-24T02:35Z,I've watched this video 5 times now. I own a sportbike & have incorporated Code's techniques & pointers into my riding style. I'm now more aware of threats while riding & how to handle those situations and gaining confidence in my turning ablility. Look out twisties! Ill seed this for a year.

Codecs... 

Try downloading and installing CCCP (combined community codec pack) 

or K-Lite Codec pack. 
There are others as well, I use CCCP. 
Careful on their sites, some dead links and some do not lead to the content...
