As in... it's not black behind the start writing, it's light grey :(
Can anyone help me?!"

,amoghthegamer,2010-05-05T02:35Z,"1. These are 720P and some are 1080P.

2. This is a great torrent and keep it working.

3. Atleast seed a 1.0 Ratio! If you download 37.15GB, upload 37.15GB! DO NOT BE A HIT n RUN!

4. Sbab87_ keep it up man

5. Iam not sure why but the folders are called ""Seizon ""#"", but it is a minor issue, you can just rename it to Season.

6. I have uploaded 26.1GB. I will upload 50KB during days and 250KB during nights. If you want extra speed, just leave your PC on at night."

Fantastic torrent, thank you.

Well worth the seven days it took for the download to finish. The quality of the files are very high and if you're not in the habit of downloading HD video rips (like me) it may surprise you.

Episodes are confirmed uncensored.

Files are in folders named Seizoen which I believe is Dutch leading me to believe the original origin of the DVDs or airing may be The Netherlands (Nederland).

SP info: As far as I know, the first eight (8) seasons of SP are not available uncensored, at least in the United States. If some are, the later seasons are most likely (Seasons 7 or 8) on DVDs I've never seen from outside the USA and Canada. I'm almost positive the first six seasons South Park were made originally censored. If anyone knows different, I'd like to know.

Hope the info helps the curious."
,referhead,2010-10-21T17:51Z,"@ azervayne
 i think your right. i dont think i remember hearing them saying  F%#k before the movie came out. the movie was the first time u could actually hear the word and not a bleeeeep. even on the dvds.  i agree with the other guy on here tho, i wish someone would upload regular avis lol."
,steviekeyz,2010-10-24T03:54Z,"epic quality, definitely worth it!"
,insanetwiztidjuggalo,2010-11-15T14:53Z,"Thank you so much! Sounds Epic! I have every episode from the 3 original shorts up to the episode of the last of season 14. I'm trying to get all the episodes in the best quality I can & all the ones possible that are uncensored, you just made my fucking day! Size ain't a problem, I got 3TB to work with ^_^ "

,mgmdoming,2011-03-20T17:21Z,Could you also add an english subtitles package?
,prep1801,2011-03-22T11:54Z,Season 12 is perfect and in dd 5.1 and I believe in 1080p.  seasons 9 and 11 seem to have slight black level problems but totally acceptable.  season 10 has a very noticable black level problem.  the first half of season 13 is great... the second half has noticable black level problems. 
,stangace,2011-03-28T12:07Z,"wow I just wanted one episode out of this and what should have taken 10-30 min w/ a good/decent connection took 4 HOURS to download due to apparent absolute crap connections/bitrates 90% of the time

,7b,2011-12-05T01:02Z,NOTE: this is *.mkv and uploader has senselessly failed to make that obvious. >50% of downloaders (especiallt those planning on streaming through XBox) need **any** other format than *.mkv.  So YES: watching this on PC? Download this. Hoping to stream it to your media device? LOOK ELSEWHERE. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this.
