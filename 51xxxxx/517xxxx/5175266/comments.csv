Again, FXG rocked the scene! This is a great release. Although the story is nothing new, its delivery and character portrayal are smooth and believable. A definite must watch for Sci-Fi junkies.

Thanks and respect to FXG for a great release."
,m0r0n,2010-02-07T18:31Z,"A very surprising movie (didn't intend to find Dennis Quaid in this excellent B masterpiece).

,jamesmc100,2010-02-17T18:53Z,"good quality if you plan to watch on computer, but when it comes to watching on tv quality is pretty poor, and ive only got 32"" tv so i think it would be unwatchable on a bigger tv. "
,DocEvil,2010-02-25T13:57Z,"The movie was fucking awesome! Great download. Audio was about a 9.7 (one or two minor glitches) but the video was no higher than a 5.5. I have a 23"" monitor and I could barly see anything when I tried full screen. At 200% it was ok, but I've seen better. The compression shouldn't have been that bad. I just downloaded Gamer, which was about the same size, and it was MUCH higher video quality."
