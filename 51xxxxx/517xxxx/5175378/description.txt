Getting to Know Your Registry
The registry is a key component of the Windows operating system.  Without it, Windows would not be able to run.  The registry is stored on your computer in several files and depending upon your version of Windows, there will be different files and different locations for these files.

Download the Free Scan from www.RegCure.comThe registry records the relationship between hardware, memory space, and addressing.  It contains information and settings for all the hardware, software, users, and preferences of the computer. Whenever you make a change to the Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes are reflected and stored in the registry.  The operating system continually references this information during its operation.
