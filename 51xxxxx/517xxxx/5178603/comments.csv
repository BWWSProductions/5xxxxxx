,NewGod,2010-02-18T23:46Z,"Unzipping is a bit complicated. First you must unzip all the .zip files and move the .rars to a folder, and then unrar. After that no problem. "
,KirkBauer,2010-03-21T01:20Z,ANyone get this to install/run successfully on Win7?
,pilot12,2010-05-11T14:35Z,"Thanks, works fine.

You have to decompress all zip in same folder.

Crack verified with Avira 10, no problem."
,Balthazaar007al6i,2010-08-14T07:13Z,"Works fine (nothing reported with Trend Micro Internet Security Pro)

First Unzip all files included in torrent,
then UnRar all files  (the Rar files were inside the Zip files).
Then Install,
then use crack,
then use program (ie.. Agent)

12345678-12345678-12345678

This worked for me."
,NewGod,2011-04-02T11:55Z,Still working ok. 
,fornit2,2011-08-02T22:53Z,"It's working ok! Great! unzip, unrar, copy cracked agent.exe, start it, enter ANY code - and enjoy! "
,currentuserjade,2011-11-19T19:03Z,"You can put anything in the serial box, after you use the crack!"
,fieldof,2012-01-06T06:31Z,"This cracked version of Agent froze up, became unresponsive, stopped working the day after I installed it.  I replaced the cracked ""Agent.exe"" with a new cracked ""Agent.exe"" but it continued to malfunction.  I re-booted my PC but that didn't help.  I finally replaced the cracked exe with the original uncracked exe and -- whadyaknow -- it worked!  Except now it was unregistered and demanded a legitimate, paid-for serial.  Anyone else had a similar problem?  "
