     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      The prosthetics are piled on as Jon Culshaw and Debra
      Stephenson continue their satirical romp through celebrity
      culture. This episode sees a snapshot of Wayne and Colleen
      Rooney's home life; Gordon Brown rapping; and the story behind
      Simon Cowell. Ross Kemp infiltrates another gang; Kylie and
      Danni's lesser known sister, Daggy, hatches a plot to become
      famous; Gok Wan may not be all he appears to be; DCI Gene Hunt
      crashes the Midsomer Murders; and Eamonn Holmes is up to his old
      tricks again.
