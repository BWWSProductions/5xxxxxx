,movielover420,2010-03-15T14:44Z,can someone please upload the guardians of ga'hoole audiobook series i would really appreciate it
,DirtyJ78,2010-03-23T06:37Z,heads up this file takes forever!!! just hoping it's worth the wait- avg speed is between 60 to 100 kbps! when it said 3 days it really meant it.

It's back though, and speeds should be better now (seeding on 10mbit fibre)."
,plaasjapie,2010-04-17T10:29Z,"Thanks for the effort.

I have a version with no cassette rips.

Better quality version available here:

Hi plaasjapie or anyone else who might know,

Which particular books in this collection are cassette rips?  I downloaded this torrent, but haven't listened to it yet.  Before I do, I want to switch out the books that are cassette rips from this torrent with the CD rips from the other torrent  by Plaasjapi.  So if anyone knows this information, post it here.  Thanks.

Signed,
Glitch

,plaasjapie,2010-05-10T20:03Z,"Sorry Glitch, no idea.

I never download cassette rips if I can help it."

I appreciate the reply, Plaasjapie.  I hadn't wanted to do a comparison between both torrents, but it now seems that I have to do just that.  And, yes, I'll post my findings just on the off chance that someone else might care to know such a thing.

As for avoiding cassette rips, I have to say that we are together on that account.  My digital audiobook collection is extensive, and there are a few cassette rips that I've downloaded because there wasn't a CD rip alternative.  Most times, after downloading these cassette rips, I clean them up using Sound Forge; a tedious undertaking, but one of which that has to be done.  It is much easier when audiobooks are CD rips that are properly normalized, encoded,  and labeled.

Hi TPB, this is Glitch,

After downloading and performing a comparison between the two torrents, I have come to the conclusion that they are exactly the same in regard to all the important aspects.  There are 13 books in both collections, the readers are the same, Both sets are chaptered and labeled, and the cassette/CD rips correlate as well.  The difference, as far as I can obviously tell, are with the size of the torrents with this one at around 20gb and the other at around 22gb.  I am not going to do a book by book comparison to see exactly which book was encoded at a slightly higher bitrate.

As to note which book in both collection is the cassette rip, I would have to say that book eight -- The Path of Daggers -- is the most likely one.  The reason for why I am a little uncertain for which books are exactly the cassette rips is because their are all in excellent quality with the  very slight exception of book eight which was audibly suspicious of a cassette rip with it's tape hiss, stereo pan, and difference in tone between each track.  I had to carefully listen in order to notice this, however.  Most people who listen to audiobooks are not sound engineers and would not notice this, much less care if they did.

Another thing of special note concerns book 12 -- The Gathering Storm.  For a book encoded in stereo at a high bitrate of 256, the audio quality is that of a mono encoding at perhaps 64 or thereabouts.  The numbers could be wrong, but the fact remains that the quality sounds much less rich than what a stereo 256 encoding should sound.

The bottom line is that both torrents are excellent in quality -- perhaps overkill for an audiobook with just vocals -- and the only significant difference is found in the size.

With all that said, thank you for whomever put this collection together; it is excellent work.  :)

Hi Plaasjapie and TPB,

Thanks for the heads up, but I've already re-encoded all 13 books and assimilated into my audiobook library.  The total size of the series being 5.08gb.

Since I have an extensive audiobook collection, there are a set of standards that I employ in order to maximize quality and harddrive space.  As a pirate who happens to be blind as well, I do not think that ""regular audiobooks"" need to be in stereo and encoded at a high bitrate; ""special audiobooks"" are treated differently, however.

A ""regular audiobook"" contains mostly vocal elements, with perhaps small elements of music serving as intro or outtro queues, and without stereo being a vital part of delivering the presentation.  In this case, encoding at a bitrate of 32 mono using the mp3 Fraunhofer IIS encoder is adequate enough for me.

 a ""special audiobook"" contains multiple vocal elements, with both musical and sound effect elements, and stereo playing an important part of delivering the presentation.  In this case, encoding at a bitrate of 64 stereo also using the mp3 Fraunhofer IIS encoder is a better choice.

If a file is encoded at a bitrate of x in stereo, the file size will not change when encoding the file at the same bitrate in mono.  The difference will be in the quality, with the stereo encoding sounding much more poor than the mono.  This is because, with the stereo, there are two channels that add up to be the total size.  With the mono, there is only one channel, therefore, that one channel takes up the total size by itself.

Think of it this way.

Stereo encoding: 16 + 16 = 32 = 10mb
Mono encoding: 32 = 32 = 10mb

Stereo encoding: 32 + 32 = 64 = 20mb
Mono encoding: 64 = 64 = 20mb

The above equations are crude, but it illustrates the point nicely.

I think audiobooks encoded above a bitrate of 64 is simply overkill.  Alternatively, for music,  a bitrate of 192 should be the minimum, but higher is better.  With that said, it all depends on the type of encoder one uses.  MP3 Fraunhofer IIS encoder, brought to you by the creators of MP3's, does the best job at encoding at lower bitrates, and because of that reason, that is what I use.

If anyone who reads this would like for me to upload my Wheel of Time series coming in at about 5.08gb, do let me know, and I'll upload it.

,plaasjapie,2010-05-16T10:26Z,"Hi again Glitch

my encoding uses the Apple standard, AAC file at 64Kbps stereo / 32Kbps Mono. As you must know, AAC has a higher quality at those settings than MP3. in this world of large hard drives, I didn't see the point of reducing 15 days and 19 hours worth of audio to smaller than 9.6Gb.

I have over 135 audiobooks on my hard drive re-encoded at these settings, and it takes up less than 23Gb for 1176 hours worth of audio

I would really appreciate if you could upload the series in the smaller size.
