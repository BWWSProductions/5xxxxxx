,qubsoft,2009-11-25T04:24Z,Well maybe that was a little harsh... I hope none of the developers read that comment. I wouldn't want to be responsible for... pushing them over the edge or anything like that.

,johnnatnight,2009-12-11T16:59Z,"This is unplayable due to bugs. The gameplay issues (crash to desktop, instant reboots, freezing) are due to sloppy development. Not a problem with the crack. Also, be warned. GameInformer rated this at .5 out of 10. Tied for lowest score ever (with Hooligans)."

DESERT BUS DRIVER is the most boreing game ever (No, I Did NOT make that up).  People use that game as a marathon to raise money.  Think of this as Desert bus driver 2, with scenery.  I wonder if this bus pulls slightly to the right too."

,yukihotfc,2010-05-11T00:36Z,"best game ever.

The most exciting part is waiting for your fart between bus stops.

Seriously, this must be the greatest gaming fail in history. Maybe they'll make up ""Park Simulator"" and ""Hard Drive Tycoon""...

Wouldn't that be EXCITING?!? -.-"
,Vicke24,2010-05-14T16:59Z,Shit game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Schexy,2010-05-16T21:08Z,"I pity the fool who actually payed money for this game. The production value is so low this game is packed with bugs. Getting stuck in the most unimaginable places is common. They havnt even bothered to animate the pedestrians who's all stuck in the middle of a stride. There is also no learning process for the gameplay, so you'll have to jump into options constantly just to see how to play the damn game. You can even clearly hear when the ambient soundscape is looping! 

Even if you think it might appeal to you playing a game about driving a bus, you're bound to be disappointed with this one. You would think such a game would be simple enough to make, but apparently not when everything is done on the cheap."
