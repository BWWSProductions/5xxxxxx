Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

twice the fun / double the trouble

On with the game release information:

Transformed is the famous bus line M42 which goes from Hudson
River to East River on 42nd street, one of the most known
streets of New York City. You drive the typical Nova RTS T
80-260 bus, presented as a very detailed and true to the
original 3D model. The original timetable and numerous
exciting tasks challenge your skills as a bus driver.

Simulation of the bus line M42 along the famous 42nd Street
in Manhattan, New York. Beyond that, many side streets and
different scenarios offer a lot of variety

Famous buildings and places of interest along and nearby the
route such as the Times Square, Chrysler Building, Grand
Central Station, Circle Line, Intrepid and of course the Port
Authority Bus Terminal as well as each and every house on 42nd
Street which have all been realistically recreated.

The 'City Bus Simulator 2010' simulation uses a physics engine
to create a realistic simulation.

3 game modes: Virtual world (incl. driving to schedule),
missions, campaign.

Interactive tutorial (optional).

Complete route incl. side streets which can be explored from
the very beginning of the game (with the exception of the

Manhattan
