Among the highlights of this disc are three award winning videos â€œNatural Bluesâ€, â€œWhy Does My Heart Feel So Bad?â€ and â€œWe Are All Made of Starsâ€. â€œNatural Bluesâ€, directed by David LaChapelle and featuring Hollywood actress Christina Ricci, won MTVâ€™s best video award in 2000. `â€™Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?â€, directed by Susi Wilkinson, H.
