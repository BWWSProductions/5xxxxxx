Plus, I've been working on another really big project (hint: it starts with ""Ultimate Marvel Universe"" and ends with ""Complete"").

It should be out soon (hopefully before Thanksgiving).

Also, if anyone is interested, I've uploaded an up-to-date torrent for the Skaar - Son of Hulk series here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5164057/Skaar_-_Son_of_Hulk_(up-to-date_as_of_10_28_09)"
