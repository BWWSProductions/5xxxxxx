   Return to Analog 
             
   VTAPE is  a set  of three  plugins based  on a  thorough simulation  of the 
   famous sound of analog tape machines.  
             
   VTAPE Saturator  simulates the  recording and  playback on  an analog  tape 
   mastering machine.  
             
   VTAPE Delay combines this sound  with a modern, step sequencer-like  tapped 
   delay engine which leads the tradition  of the tape echo machines into  the 
   21st century. 
             
   VTAPE Flanger simulates the legendary  Tape flanging effect which can  be 
   achieved through  the playback  of two  tape machines  running at  slightly 
   different speed. 
             
             
   Why and How ? 
             
   Why bothering  about going  back to  analogue tape  recording knowing  that 
   todays digital audio recording is undoubtly more precise in reproducing the 
   original sound ? 
             
   Perhaps  you already  guessed the  answer: its  the imperfection  and the 
   technical deficiencies which  can add something  wonderful to the  sound if 
   properly used. 
             
   Most emulations of the `tape sound focus on the saturation  characteristic 
   alone and underestimate the effect of  a subtle amount of `flutter -  high 
   frequency fluctuations  of the  tape speed.  This adds  something which  is 
   probably the most important part  of the special sound: The  harmonic lines 
   are "widened" by  the effect of  frequency modulation due  to flutter which 
   causes a 'thickening' of the audio signal contributing to the fat sound  of 
   analog, compared  to the  more accurate,  but thin  sound of  digital. This 
   effect called `Modulation noise makes it easier to mix tracks together  by 
   removing  the static  character especially  of electric/electronic  sounds. 
   Its interesting to  know that many  natural instruments have  a "built-in" 
   flutter effect which strongly contributes to their sound. 
             
   The distortion and compression effects due to the saturation characteristic 
   of  magnetic  recording  depend  on the  input  signal  level.  With normal 
   recording levels the  distortion is around  1% which is  away from sounding 
   really distorted but quite audible and adds a pleasant color to the  sound. 
   Higher values should only be used as special effect on some suitable tracks 
   dependant  on the  style of  music youre  after. The  saturation is  also 
   responsible for  the `instant  compression effect  which causes  transient 
   signals to be reduced in level. In contrast to a dedicated compressor  this 
   one  is  working with  instant  attack/release and  therefore  avoiding the 
   typical pumping artefacts.

   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5
   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version
   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3
   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear
