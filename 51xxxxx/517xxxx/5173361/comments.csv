[T],jmb2012,2009-11-21T21:43Z,If you mean wiping an older version b4 installing this one just use a reg cleaner to remove folder lock reg entries and delete installation dir in program files.

,biggame89,2010-01-08T06:29Z,"I have a question, is this software capable of password protecting particular folders? When i lock a folder i want to access by clicking it and it asking me for a password (right now it just says access denied), thus far i am unable to achieve this. Any help?"
,BlaueReiter,2010-01-11T15:19Z,"This is a nice little program that work just fine - one question,
I run AVG after installed it and AVG reports several hidden rootkits
from Folder Locker but this I think one can ignore, or what do You think?
I hade a similar issue with a free program called Free Hide Folder
that AdAware reports like a threat but not AVG. I think its just because 
they hide folders and files that is suspicious for some security programs."

,oxitude,2010-02-04T03:37Z,"HELP PLS! pgrm still askin to enter serial & reg key even after successful reg at first attempt.

how do i do?"
,oobio,2010-02-06T00:33Z,"Thanks for uploading, but each serial only works once. After I enter it in and it thanks me for registering, I get one use before I get a message saying the serial has already been used and the paid program is no longer usable. I can never use that code again. So since you included 4 codes, I only get to use the program 4 times (already done 3)."
