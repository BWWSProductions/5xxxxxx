I belong to a private tracker that only allows original BBC programming, which means as an American it is almost impossible for me to maintain a decent ratio. I often have to download massive torrents I donâ€™t want in order to seed back and keep my ratio up. Thatâ€™s how I acquired this torrent of the 2007 Glastonbury Music Festival, even though Iâ€™m not personally into live concert footage. Therefore, once this is up and has a few seeders, Iâ€™m going to delete it so I can clear up some badly needed HD room. Still, I thought there would probably be many folks who love concert footage enough to make it worthwhile to upload this on a public forum. If it doesnâ€™t attract anybody, Iâ€™ll learn differently.

The Glastonbury is an outdoor multiday music fest (similar to Woodstock) that has become an annual event and the largest such in the world. This particular torrent consists of the required files to burn several DVDs of the entire fest. The original uploader is fine with the torrent being spread about as long as the NFO file is maintained, so here is the torrent EXACTLY as presented by the OP.
