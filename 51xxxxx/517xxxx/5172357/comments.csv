,blobbyboy1,2009-12-03T10:27Z,"beware! look up mkv files before you download this.

waste of time and effort, this is a mkv file format, soon as i see that i deleted it,
and then convert it to....oh well, you get the idea, and then if you don't do it right you get no sound,

up to you if you want the effort, but for me i'll just go elsewhere and get a img or ts or any of the other normal formats available, i just wish i noticed what this is before downloading it."
,blobbyboy1,2009-12-03T10:37Z,"here is a guide from chipu what needs to be done if you do decide to download this file format.....


OK, here are the programs you will need. This the process I use to guarantee speed and accuracy of the right audio tracks. If you only have one audio track, then I think jam?s advice will work (sorry, haven?t confirmed it yet) 

MKV Codec (http://packs.matroska.org/) 
WinAMP (http://www.winamp.com) 
- BTW, WinAMP should have AAC encoding/decoding built in by now. If not, find a AAC plugin for winwmp and install it... www.AudioCoding.com is where I got mine. 

mkvtoolnix(http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/) 
- This is the extractor/creator tool (sorry, have to extract using a DOS window). Read the extract.html file under docs, very well written. 

TMPGEnc or similar. 

OK, read the extract.html for mkvtoolnix to know how to use the mkvmerge and mkvextract commands. You?ll need the mkvmerge to determine the order of the video, audio, and subtitle tracks. Usually, there are 2 audio tracks so you?ll have to extract both, then listen to them to determine which of the two you want. 

OK, extract the video as an .avi and the audio tracts as .m4a 

Now open WinAMP, click on options, then preferences. Under the 'Plug-ins' section, select 'Output' then select 'Nullsoft Diskwriter plug-in' and then Configure. 

Uncheck everything, select your output directory, and select 'Force WAV file' under 'Output file mode'. Click OK. 

Close the plugin window. 

Now click 'File', 'Play File', and select the .m4a file. 

You should not hear any sound, the file should process rather quickly and you should have a .wav file in the location you choose earlier. 

Repeat the Play File step for as many .m4a files you have. You may have to shut down WinAmp and start it back up each time. 

After that, you can use TMPGEnc or similar program to rejoin the audio with video. Remember, you can only join one audio tract with the video so make sure you choose the right one. 

Once converted, you can use whatever DVD creation software you want to burn to DVD.

no, thought not! move on and get a proper format."
,bander49,2009-12-04T03:36Z,"I totally agree with blobbyboy1, a waste of time and efford if you not have a bluray player"
,Enztron42,2009-12-05T03:17Z,"i dont have a blu ray player....but i have an hdmi port for my computer and laptop. and i dont even need to encode the sound cuz i got 5.1 surround sound ... and last but not least 36inch hd tv to output the 720p.  and it comes out crisp , no complaints no need for a blu ray player for me...so dont talk nonsence lol , i should probably stop rambling on as well annd just say THANK YOU-jonny- for UPLOAD"
,havega418,2009-12-06T08:04Z,How much quality was reduced when you compressed it? Just wondering.
,Latiino,2009-12-10T05:22Z,"WTF u dont need to do all that..

through HMDI and viola! 
how hard is that?
hell i usually watch it on my laptop too and the quality is just amazing, so much better than DVD's

blu-ray player?? xD"
,js303,2009-12-12T02:13Z,I tried connecting my laptop to via hdmi to my lcd tv and no video.  Any thoughts?

,PunkArmy,2009-12-27T05:53Z,can you burn .mkv to dvds?
,Archangeldawn,2009-12-27T18:39Z,"wow thank you -jonny-
1st time downloading and burning .mkv files to DVD using ConvertXtoDVD and I can definitely notice the better quality. I might start downloading bluray rips that are around 4GB's more often.

 Audio 10
Video 10
Movie 10 

The difference between the unrated and the regular DVD rip that 1st came out is that the Unrated has a few extra scenes and is more closer to the Theatrical version because at the end of the movie you see the ""softcore"" XXX type of images that were shown in theaters but not in the regular DVD."
,Dazzlerocks,2009-12-27T23:44Z,"Hi, Just wondering if i download this blu ray film. would i need anyother softare to play the move. i al ready have blu-ray built into my laptop and i use wind dvd 9 to play film.. will that play this film.
Thanks"
,Stack8907,2009-12-28T05:25Z,How come I see so many seeders but am downloading at 40 kb/s. COME ON FUCKS...SEED!!! I seed @ 100 kb/s. If everyone done this then everyone would get it faster. DAMN!!
,sinsnowman,2009-12-29T11:21Z,WTH is going on with that 100kb/s.......so damn slow....
,Haroldm,2010-01-03T05:02Z,"Burned with ConvertxtoDVD and audio was out of sync, cannot demux this file properly either.

ConvertXtoDVD does not recognize the file length correctly. Maybe the file is corrupted?"
,superman101,2010-01-04T04:29Z,"Audio: 10
Video: 10

No complaints in that department, however I'm wondering exactly what made this version 'unrated'. I don't recall any new/extended scenes and the pictures at the end were the same as in the theater. Not complaining mind you, props to -jonny- for uploading, I'm just confused as to why this version differs from others.

@Archangeldawn

Maybe I just missed it then, but I didn't notice anything different then in theaters."
,Glorious_Basterd,2010-01-05T00:46Z,"Holy shit, why are all the movies that I try to download are so fucking slow? It will take me three days to download this torrent at the rate it is going. 1336 seeders and still no results. "

,superman101,2010-01-05T03:55Z,"@Vanilla_B3ar

Try using VLC; it's a dependable video playback platform for both Windows and Mac."
,jerzeyboy,2010-01-06T03:04Z,"I hope you guys all know, for those having trouble with watching, that you can just use daemon tools to watch the movie, cuz now they have blu-ray support."
,Ragnarok100,2010-01-09T18:09Z,seed please! I'm downloading at a poor 10kb/sec. Even smallband is faster then that.

,Superuploader,2010-01-15T20:47Z,"and yea, it is very annoying if i close the window by accident 1 hour into the movie, and because i cant fast forward I have to see it all over again"
,miller126,2010-01-16T06:40Z,"to all you who are crying about this being a MKV file....... use MKVtoVOB.. very simple UI. click the  top right of the screen where it says (No Sound? Static? click here) and it will tell you what settings to change if you get no sound or static etc;. and yes this is for playing blue ray files on the ps3, but it also changes the format to where the file can be easily burnt to a dvd and played back on a standard dvd player.... this is by far the fastest file converter i have used thus far, and trust me,,, i have used a bunch of different ones. now depending on the power of your PC will of course will depend on how long it takes to convert the file. i have a 5 yr old Gateway GT5058- with 2.0GHz AMD Athlon dual core processor, and 2GB DDR. and trust me..... "
,miller126,2010-01-16T06:41Z,using PS3toVOB to convert the MKV file will be the best ten of fifteen minutes you have ever spent on converting a file.... or if you have a PS3 you can just download PS3 Media server. this will allow you to watch it on your PS3 using your wireless internet connection. and the best thing about this Media server is that it doesn't require converting the MKV file. it automatically does it as it is streaming the movie. this Media server is pretty slick.
,miller126,2010-01-16T06:41Z," i used TVersity for a long time, but once i found PS3 Media server and figured it out, i uninstalled TVersity..... here is the link to PS3 Media server..... ENJOY!!!!!!"
,miller126,2010-01-16T06:45Z,it won't let me put the link on here. just google PS3 Media server and choose the first link that is on the screen

,master__,2010-01-24T17:40Z,If people could learn that RAR files are mutch better than one big file this tracker would be awsome. Everyone would know that the files are the exakt the same as it was for the one who ripped the release. To bad moste people here are to dumb to relize that. have a good life 
,UltraMaster,2010-02-02T14:24Z,"Great quality. But it isn't flawless. It has some image problems, due to conversion, I guess. It happens several times that the image becomes scrambled.  Other than that the image quality si great and the sound also.
Go for it and enjoy."
,DarkOozaru,2010-02-02T22:27Z,"PS3 media server will remux and play .Mkv with a transcode if you have a nice processor and ram .. no need to convert, the ps3 will stream wireless off your home network from your pc upstairs to your ps3 without even a convert in sight"

also, please stop complaining about slow internet speed people, where i live we get 20KB/s, 26 Max, and it's not like we're poor or something (MBP17 8GB RAM 500GB HDD i7) but its just the max in Ghana :/"
