This whole despicable phase in ""modern science"" hearkens back to the days of Galileo's prosecution by the ""majority"" that believed the Earth to be flat! So much for the scientific method, it's all about politics and grant money rather than facts anymore, so much for the benefit of humanity, the so called climate scientists and leftist politicians are worse than the inquisition!"

Damn, should have listened to my professor when he said it's not that much humans as it is volcanoes ..."

As a former off-road competitor here in our SoCal deserts, I've been monitoring as a hobbyist environmental eXtremism for a good couple dozen years.

With the few articles I've read about this 'leaked' information, it sounds good enough, amongst other things, to recall awards and prizes given to AlGore for his propaganda movie!

So to those who supplied this, I salute you!!!"
