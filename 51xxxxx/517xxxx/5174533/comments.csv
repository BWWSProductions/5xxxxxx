,bou24,2010-04-18T17:18Z,"ATTENTION! The ID tags on the tracks are totaly fucked up by the uploader so be prepared to spend several hours on renaming every track unless you have a tag editor advanced enough..
AND FUCK YOU DJ BLAZE, I PROBABLY WOULD LISTEN TO YOUR TRACKS AND PROMOTE THEM BUT SINCE YOU'VE FUCKED UP THE ID TAGS COMPLETELY, BEING SCARED OF SOMEONE MIGHT RENAME THEM AND TAKE AWAY YOUR NAME FROM IT AND FORGET IT WAS YOURS. I COULD ASWELL BE LISTENING TO A RADIO WITH RUSSIAN FOLK MUSIC AND NOT UNDERSTAND A SHIT. FUCK YOU!

To all who did not get this. The ID tags are set that www.just4dance.fw.hu is set as text on Artist, Album Artist, Track Name, Composer and Comments.

Dear Dj Blaze, I hope you die a painful death"
