,KeeSusie,2011-01-08T06:48Z,"Thanks for sharing! I downloaded this torrent (or possibly your duplicate torrent with the same name) and the quality is good but is 182 & 189 kbps not 320 kbps. It also only created 2 mp3 files, 1 for CD1 and 1 for CD2, instead of individual tracks.  I found Direct WAV MP3 Splitter on CNET which allowed me to easily split the files according to the track times you list below.  I'm going to try to seed that for anyone who wants it when i figure out how.  Thanks again for sharing!"
