Faerie Tale Theatre, fully Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre, is a live action children's television series retelling popular fairy tales. Shelley Duvall serves as narrator, host and executive producer of the program, and occasionally stars in episodes. The series was followed by another, shorter series called Tall Tales & Legends which followed the same format as Faerie Tale Theatre and focused on classic American folk tales. Both series feature well known actors and directors, and were inspired by the children's television series Shirley Temple Theatre (also known as The Shirley Temple Show and Shirley Temple's Storybook).
Every episode opens with Shelley Duvall introducing herself and welcoming the viewer to the show, after which she would provide a brief blurb of the story that would follow. All the episodes feature live action twist adaptations of fairy tales in costume by many well-known actors and are directed by such diverse directors as Tim Burton and Francis Ford Coppola. Though Duvall introduced each show, she has starring roles in only two of the episodes: Rumpelstilskin (airing in 1982) and Rapunzel (airing in 1983). Many episodes feature backdrops and settings inspired by specific artists and children's book illustrators, including Maxfield Parrish (The Frog Prince), Norman Rockwell (Goldilocks and the Three Bears), Arthur Rackham (Hansel and Gretel), Jennie Harbour (Jack and the Beanstalk), Edmund Dulac (The Nightingale), Gustav Klimt (Rapunzel), N.C. Wyeth (Rumpelstiltskin), Kay Nielsen (Sleeping Beauty), and George Cruikshank (Thumbelina).
