It's really hard to watch a great artist fall from grace. I knew the honeymoon wouldn't last forever. Even the Beatles knew when to say when. I've watched or listened to all his work over the years, and this his least funny work ever (at least since he's been recorded). I'm usually in tears by the first minute. Fame, wealth, marriage and kids are not what makes great art. Pain, loneliness and misery are.

This is the beginning of the end. He's officially peaked."
