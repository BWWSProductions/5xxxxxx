Single pass was broken.... shows how often I use that.




ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION!


Do not use this version with old ffmpeg and attempt to do 2 pass encodes.  The resulting video will be out of sync in QuickTime!  Use supplied ffmpeg in tar file or newer only!

If you use this please provide feedback.  Especially on the appletv profile.  I am thinking it needs at least 256kb (1664 --> 1920) more bitrate.  Needs testing further.
