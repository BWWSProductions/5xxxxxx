        WinOKE is a piece of software for Windows that allows you        
        to create and present karaoke on your home PC without the        
        need for any expensive karaoke equipment.                        
                                                                         
        The karaoke presentations play back in the style of your         
        choosing by making use of the many options available that        
        change how the playback looks and behaves.

      A few years ago, DiGERATi emerged onto the scene.            
      Focusing on quality rather than quantity, our                
      members have successfully tackled some of the toughest       
      challenges in the scene.  Working as a closely unified      
         team we have maintained some of the highest standards          
       for security, quality, innovation, and comradery in the        
       scene today. DiGERATi is not one or two hardworking            
         persons; it is a force of hardworking people. Respect          
        is not to be demanded; it is to be earned!  We look           
     forward to working even harder in the future to continue     
   & to earn the respect of our peers. For anyone other than   
    our peers, WE DO NOT EXIST!

    those that broke the trail for us but can no longer be

        Who are the "digerati" and why are they "the cyber elite"?      
         They are the doers and thinkers. They are not on the           
              frontier, they are the frontier!!...
