,port6464,2009-12-11T22:46Z,"Hey father dougal, I am an avid follower of the NYW, and I greatly recognize and appreciate what you have done thus far. I have quite a few episodes however they are sporadic in nature and not of a standard quality. I would be more than willing to host some if you could get me additional seasons I have 2mb up and could dedicate most of that to said service. Let me know man. "
