,pugssuriya,2009-11-23T01:55Z,Quality?
,krillsson,2009-11-23T02:08Z,Crappy sound as always on the R5Â´s
,dhruv990,2009-11-23T07:45Z,"Picture quality is good say about a 9 but audio is definately a TS say about 7(its audible and pretty good as compared to other TS audios that i've heard).
All this is based on the sample.
Worth a download if you can't wait for the dvdrip, ofcourse."
,dhruv990,2009-11-23T07:53Z,"Though I'd reccomend the noir release.
Its also 700 mb but has better pcture(according to the sample)"
,dhruv990,2009-11-23T07:57Z,Also note that since my opinion is based on the sample. I do not know whether the sample included is a segment of a flashback or something. Because it does not look as good as the other r5s that I have seen(it looks more like a ts)
,imaddict,2009-11-23T21:29Z,"there is another release available:
Saw 6 R5 LiNE XVID - IMAGiNE.........anyone on the quality of this version???"
