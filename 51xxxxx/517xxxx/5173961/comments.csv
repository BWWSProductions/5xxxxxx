,TheBombio,2009-12-03T23:38Z,"I scanned this with Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 and it detected no threats at all.

Secondly, the installation works and the Fraps is a registered 3.0.2 version. I was able to record longer than 30 seconds. But, with all versions of Fraps, the files are pretty big. I recorded a minute and 27 seconds and the file was 1.45gb."
