  In The Long Saturday Night, the police wrongly think that John Warren killed his wife's lover. Realizing that all the circumstantial evidence points to him, Warren goes on the run, hoping to find the real killer. He probably wouldn't have succeeded but for the help of his astute and clever secretary.
