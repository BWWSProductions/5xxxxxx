,XoLWoX,2009-11-24T15:56Z,"ha keep saying what YOU think i dont care what 1 persons says thats your opinion 

IF YOU DIDNT KNOW R5 IS A RUSSION DVDRIP WITH ENGLISH AUDIO FROM A LOWER SOURCE 

maybe your the moron"

,XoLWoX,2009-11-24T22:46Z,"unlike the other some people are greatful for what i upload

,biggdaddygiz,2009-11-25T05:39Z,Audio is out of sync until after the first 25 minutes... then you hear it say audio for some reason
,xazsq,2009-11-25T13:24Z,"thanks a lot...
keep the goodwork..."
,st34lth_n1nj4,2009-11-25T16:09Z,"actually R5 in terms of torrents are audio and video from 2 seperate sources, usaully the video is dvd, a dvdrip is exactly that it is the image burnt directly from a dvd so the audio and video are both from the same source - there for you cannot have an r5 dvdrip because that would mean it is a dvdrip (both audio and video) and a second video and audio from 2 other sources - NOT possible.

so sorry but your a moron."

,T-Sneaky,2009-11-27T13:33Z,"R5 ---> the DVD region code for most of Africa, Former Soviet Union, the Indian subcontinent, Mongolia and North Korea, also: 
R5 (bootleg), a specific format of DVD released in the former Soviet Union, the Indian subcontinent, and much of Africa

For my understanding R5 is just the region... and this is a dvdrip from this regions of the world. Anyway personally I don't give a fuck what it is, important is the quality.

The best thing to say is: Thank You Uploader!"

,Pirate815,2009-11-27T18:55Z,"I think the word YOU'RE looking for is ""YOU'RE"". R5 is not dvdrip, just because the video source is clean. Thus, you are a moron twice over. Once for poor labels, and numerous times for grammar. Way to go, moron."

did i even say R5 wasn't a region code? NO i said R5 is usually ripped from 2 sources the video usually being dvdrip (from a Russian/R5 in this case) and audio from else where, so being as this is Russian video with separate audio source that would make it an R5 line and NOT an R5 dvdrip you jumped up little fucktard."

I don't know if you're a moron or not. But you're definitely really pathetic. you download the film, and watch it, and instead of thanking the uploader you act all superior and insult him for some little issue that has no relevance to anything to do with your enjoyment of the DL. If you just sit around looking for things to get mad about so you can blast people, try reading a newspaper. There are plenty of actually important issues you could focus that energy on

,GizGaz,2009-11-29T05:28Z,"An R5 is a release made with a telecine machine from an analog source. Unlike a TC, the digitization is performed by the studio itself with very professional (and expensive) equipment and usually from the original source.[1] The purpose of it is to create a high quality digital copy (usually for a later DVD release). But unlike a DVD, an R5 is released before the digital post-processing is finished. The quality of the rips can differ, but an R5 can be almost indistinguishable from a DVDRip since many movies are published on DVD with minimal editing.

The name R5 refers to DVD Region 5, which includes the former Soviet Union, the Indian subcontinent, and much of Africa. In an effort to compete with movie piracy in these areas, the movie industry chose to create a new format for DVD releases that could be produced more quickly and less expensively than traditional DVD releases. R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they often lack both the image post-processing and special features that are common on DVD releases. This allows the film to be released for sale at the same time that DVD screeners are released. Since these screeners are the chief source of high-quality pre-DVD release pirated movies (in comparison to cam or telesync, mostly), this allows the movie studios to beat the pirates to market. Bootlegged copies of these releases are often distributed on the Internet and in some cases, R5 DVDs may be released without an English audio track, requiring pirates to use the direct line audio from the film's theatrical release. In this case, the pirated release will be tagged with "".LINE"" to distinguish it from a release with a DVD audio track."
,scream_b,2009-11-29T15:06Z,"I had my questions about the quality and everything but to my surprise it was amazingly good.!!

The quality is not so good as one would expect from a DVD rip and the main problem is with the sound. The video holds up better.
But what's the deal with that voice with a russian-like accent at the end titles reciting the names of the production crew. -.-  And also there was an abrupt voice at 24:50 as well that puts you off suddenly! ...Why does someone  make such adjustments and spoil it?! It is totally unnecessary."

I've heard of the SAW movie collection and thought I've watch all of them due to their popularity. Needless to say, it lived up to my expectations with it's realistic graphical detail and suspense; the twists in the storyline was unpredictable. If you liked the others, this will be no exception of what you saw thus far. Out of the six I've watched, this is my favorite because it explains the reason for the deaths, rather than random acts of cruelty. 

If other users are going to criticize this movie, please provide constructive criticism. Saying ""This move is terrible"" or ""Bad movie"" is pointless and doesn't contribute towards users trying to figure out rather SAW 6 is worth watching. Take it from me: If I don't like something, I don't hold back on what I think. For SAW 6 and it's predecessors, this movie series is unique and only gets better as the line of series goes forward."
