Soundtrack for Bethesda's milestone RPG Morrowind from the popular Elder Scrolls series; came with the collector's edition.

Note: There were no track titles for the audio cd, although there are some custom titles floating around (freedb, discogs...) But there is an official 21 track release on directsong which came with proper track titles. So I just compared tracks and fixed the titles.
Oh and the 21 track release came only as 320kbit DRM WMA, so you'll never see this release on what. Still it's out there - use google.
