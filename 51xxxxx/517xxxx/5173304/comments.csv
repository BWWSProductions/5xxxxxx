,lando520,2009-11-21T17:44Z,Hey HR what format is this in and can it be copied to a blank dvd-r?
,zzzonked,2009-11-21T17:49Z,v cn also use km player or bs player apart frm vlc am i rite HR
,lando520,2009-11-22T02:43Z,Cool Thanx HR oh yeah could you tell me what would be the best software to copy the movie to a dvd becuz i use xilisoft dvd creator but it puts a water mark on screen and sometimes the audio doesnt match up?
,lando520,2009-11-22T07:00Z,I want to put the file on a disc but the software I use doesn't work good so I was wondering if you knew if there was a software that would copy any file to a disc without a watermark?
,lando520,2009-11-22T07:38Z,"Well the software that came installed on my pc is called windows dvd maker and it sets it up with the scene selection like a real dvd but it only lets me burn files that are wmv to the dvd not mpeg-4 or avi, and all my movies are pretty much in mpeg-4 and avi format. So is there a free software that would let me burn mpeg-4 or avi files to a dvd?"

And if someones debating not downloading this because they think Up is a kids movie, theres a lot of adult humor in it and the plot is both cute and interesting. You will not be dissapointed with the movie, its like my 2nd fav pixar movie. You wont regret downloading this, whether your 1 or 100"
,lando520,2009-11-22T09:25Z,Yea i just want a software that will burn the movie to a dvd so i can delete the movies off my computer becuz they're taking up alot of memory. So nero would work?
,lando520,2009-11-22T23:16Z,Cool thanx HR
,lando520,2009-11-23T01:40Z,"One more question HR I downloaded a trial version of nero 9 and if I click on burn data disc I should be able to copy an mpeg-4 movie to the dvd right? and if I click on burn video disc, thats only for copying dvd-video files right? "
