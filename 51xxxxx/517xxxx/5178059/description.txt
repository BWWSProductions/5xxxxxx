  The Diamond Bikini is the first of Charles Williams three comic novels. A stripper has witnessed a murder, and the gangsters who committed the murder want to eliminate her as a witness. So she hides out on a farm owned by Sagamore Noonan, who's not much of a farmer but is a successful bootlegger and conman. The farm is also home to Sagamore's brother, Sam, and Sam's seven-year-old son, Billy. The story is told by Billy, who usually misinterprets the goings-on.
