  Nothing in Her Way is about a series of con games, with so many double crosses, triple crosses, and quadruple crosses that it will almost certainly keep you off balance all the way through.  You may think you know who's doing what to whom, but Williams is consistently surprising.  Even at the end, you might not be sure who wins, but you'll know who the loser is, another guy who trusted a woman who's a lot colder and smarter and more ruthless than he'll ever be.  And another great ending, too.
