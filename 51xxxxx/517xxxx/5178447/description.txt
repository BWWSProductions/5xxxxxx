 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 PDF Data Extractor can extract certain text information within the PDF,    
 This is an ideal product if you had for example a PDF statement that you   
 need to extract data like Account Number, Name, Address and output this    
 information into an Excel CSV file. It uses horizontal, vertical text      
 position matching and for more advanced matching it has a rules system for 
 conditional matching, e.g. Only take match when Account Number: text is on 
 the same page. Different fields can also be merged into one, so say First  
 Name and Surname can be output as one field in the CSV file, convert       
 spreadsheet format pdf's to csv files, many options are available: Data    
 Extraction, Run on the command line, Header output, page number field,     
 filename field, Batch list of files to process.

 If you really like this software, consider purchasing it!  Seriously, keep 
 the hard working programmers paid; Motivate them to create more good stuff 
  for us to pirate.  If you don't care about this software, then delete it
