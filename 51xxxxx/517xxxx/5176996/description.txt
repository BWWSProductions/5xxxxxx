* We received a CD and DAT. The CD was marked "1968-Winter/Late
Summer, San Francisco" ("probably from The Matrix"), the DAT source
was unmarked but had been tauted as 1967?, Unknown Location. The
contents of both media turned out to be the same. From the stereo mix
differences between tracks it appears that T01-03 & T09-11 are from
the same gig while T04-08 & T12-13 are from two separate gigs. It is
not clear whether all of this recording is from 1968, San Francisco.
It is also not clear whether "Winter/Late Summer" means (whichever
portion of the recording that refers to) the recordings are EITHER
from Winter or Late Summer or whether one part is from Winter &
another from Late Summer...
