,saftsuser,2009-11-26T06:25Z,Why do u always extract the files from the dvd? How do i burn is at a dvd again? 
[V],sailo,2009-11-26T08:27Z,"since I answered his questions, i will answer yours.

That is how a dvd is authored, not as an iso.
It also gives people a chance to see what is in the dvd, and be able to download individual files to play and test the quality of the dvd. and you don't have to mount an iso  to play with any media player on computer.

google burning vob files, so many free programs.

or get this, easiest:

,nilllle,2009-12-03T16:59Z,"saftsuser > In nero, choose the altervative DVD-video. Then just add these files in the Video_TS folder. Burn!"
,blobbyboy1,2009-12-05T14:58Z,"BOW are the group that provide these releases, there are a lot of groups of very clever people out there that deserve all the praise we give them, BOW are one of the best going these days,

this movie is brilliant, loved it from start to finish, so thank you uploader.

i use dvd santa(available from here and elsewhere if you do a search), it is good for all kinds of recording solutions, img, ts, bup, well, the list goes on and on, manages almost everything, the 2nd choice for those it wont do is alcohol 120 which is also awesome and great for img(images)."
,Vybes,2009-12-09T14:01Z,"This movie was GREAT. Probably the greatest sci-fi, no just greatest overall movie I've seen this year in my opinion. Thanks for the upload!"

,mandieleeann,2009-12-30T20:25Z,"This is my first time burning vob's, and Im using img burn...do I add every single file in the torrent? or do make everything and image file and then  burn? Sorry if this is newbish...I dont normally burn to DVD so im rather new at the whole DVD player watching thing. Any help would be appreciated. I have successfully converted .avi's to .iso's in order to watch on DVD players for my kids. But this seems a bit trickier thanks guys :)"
