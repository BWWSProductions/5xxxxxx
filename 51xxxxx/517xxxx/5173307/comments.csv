,Renaissance,2009-12-28T01:57Z,"Most java games for Nokia 5800 will work perfect on SE Satio, but on some the black built in ""touch screen button system"" appears and all is ruined."
,apoteka,2009-12-30T12:23Z,"you can find symbian games on mobiles24.com

Turn off the virtual keys in app manager, it should work then as fullscreen:

Menu > Settings > Application manager > Installed apps > ""Select touch game in 360x640"" > Options > Suite setting > On-screen keyboard > OFF

Also, some games are not fullscreen, they only play in half a screen, it's just the way those games are"
