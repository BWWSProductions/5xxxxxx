This is the Solfeggio plus 3 complementary frequencies that Len Horowitz talks about in his film DNA: Pirates of the Sacred Spiral.

The frequencies are complemented by the sound of a babbling brook and wind chimes.

It is very relaxing and energising for the whole body and mind.  Best to listen with headphones - either on their own with your eyes closed or when doing other activities.

It's 36 minutes long which should be enough for the lunch-breakers.  Each frequency is 4 minutes long.

It is copyright free - so help yourself - even give it as a healing present to someone you love.
