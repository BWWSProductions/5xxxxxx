The first volumes of Savage Tales ran 11 issues, with a nearly 2 1/2-year hiatus after the premiere issue (May 1971, then Oct. 1973 - July 1975).  It marked Marvel's second attempt at entering the comics-magazine field dominated by Warren Publishing (Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella), following the two-issue superhero entry The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1968.  Starring in the first issue were Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery pulp-fiction character Conan the Barbarian, adapted by writer Roy Thomas and artist Barry Windsor-Smith (as Barry Smith); the futuristic, Amazon-like Femizons, by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist John Romita; the swamp creature Man-Thing, plotted by Lee and Thomas, scripted by Gerry Conway and drawn by Gray Morrow; the African-American inner-city defender Joshua, in the feature "Black Brother" by Dennis O'Neil (under the pseudonym Sergius O'Shaughnessy) and penciler Gene Colan; and, after Conan had been spun off into his own Savage Sword of Conan, the jungle lord Ka-Zar, by Lee and artist John Buscema.

When the magazine eventually began publishing again years later in the wake of a Conan-inspired sword-and-sorcery trend in comics, it starred the likes of Conan, fellow Robert E. Howard hero Kull of Atlantis and John Jakes' barbarian creation, Brak. As of issue #6, the magazine cover-featured Ka-Zar.

The series featured painted covers by notable comics artists incouding John Buscema (#1-2), Pablo Marcos & John Romita (#3), Neal Adams (#4-6), Boris Vallejo (#7, #10), and Michael Kaluta (#9). A 1975 annual, consisting entirely of reprints, mostly from Ka-Zar's four-color line series, sported a new cover by Ken Barr.
