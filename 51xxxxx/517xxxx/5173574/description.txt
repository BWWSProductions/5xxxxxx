     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's back for a brand new series,
      and with Autumn well and truly in full swing and Winter on its
      way it's time to stock the larder and enjoy everything these
      seasons have in store. As Hugh lives in Devon - cider country -
      he's presented with a problem when it comes to the pear, one of
      his favourite fruits. As well as eating and cooking with pears
      he would like to enjoy them brewed into alcohol - or perry, as
      pear cider is known. To do this, however, he must leave River
      Cottage HQ and head off to Gloucestershire for some expert
      advice. Fishing is one of Hugh's great passions and whether with
      line or fly, scuba gear or net, he's endeavoured to try a wide
      variety of methods to catch his prey. One technique he's has not
      attempted yet is professional free diving. After a crash course
      in learning how to hold huge breaths underwater, he takes to the
      open sea to try and bag the ultimate shellfish: scallops.
