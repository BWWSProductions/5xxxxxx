Mark Rappaport - The Scenic Route (1978)


LANGUAGE: English
SUBTITLES: None


SYNOPSIS: The Scenic Route is a bizarre dream film of a movie that tells the story of two sisters who share the same lover without realizing it. Rappaport crafts a zany anti-melodrama about female imprisonment in romantic dreams, delusions, and anxieties. He reminds us that raw experience is a myth. We live in a culture where our food is processed, our possessions manufactured, and our entertainment market-tested. Why should our fantasies be any different? They are as mass-produced as our automobiles; our emotions as synthetic as designer fabrics. And as quickly in or out of fashion. Run, run, as fast as you can; you can't keep up with the Gingerbread Man. In Rappaport's power-saturated vision of life, individualism has gone the way of the vacuum tube radio. We are antennas resonating to a surging force field of cultural energies. Our identities are as artificial as our art, our love affairs as elaborately conjugated as a Latin verb. - Ray Carney
