,dynasoar,2009-11-25T13:45Z,"Science has nothing to say on the subject. Nothing. It is not science's business to evaluate religion. Anyone that thinks so doesn't know very much about either.

And for the record, the original thought behind western science was handed down to the Arab people from Greece through Rome, and from Alexandria. When the barbarians and the early christians destroyed those respectively, bringing about 1,000 years of ignorance, the Arabs maintained and expanded science. Europeans relearned it from the Arabs between 1400 and 1800. The same science is practiced by both, and still has nothing to say about either."
,alikar84,2009-11-25T14:08Z,"bro, there were many things predicted in earlier ages by greeks and others , many were wrong gand and many were right, many even said earth is stationay like bible, only few said right things as well ,but quran said 100% right things which modern science has established now in last 30 years. Quran speaks about complete water cycle, quran speaks about how earth came into existence and lots of things which mdern sccience has been able to say now. And they are 100% right But there is not a single mistake in quran. So what do u think prophet Mohd(PBUP) an iliterate person who couldnt even read was scientist, he copied everything right and deleted which was wrong. some Greeks said even bible earth said is cirlce shaped but its flat. Quran says truth exactly like a Ossterich's egg shaped. Quran speaks about the development stages of a baby in womb. But it's not a book of science it's book of signs instead from Allah(the Almighty God) and it was revealed to prophet Mohd(PBUH) for the guidance of humankind. U have to watch the whole debate to come know to truth, don't draw conclusions without reading quran and watching this debate."

And quite a few people may have different opinions, Im not forcing my opinion on anyone. you can think yourself what is good for you, my intention is to present what i think is truth. You may think it's false, u watch and decide if want u can give ur opinion or keep it yourself. All upto u. "

,dust_on_mist,2009-12-22T23:27Z,"i dont think mohammad really given to him the verses muslims claimed about, if you read mohammad history you will doubt about it, my best guess mohammad recited those so called verses based on other religion such as christianity & Judaism, because before islam was made mohammad grew up around those religion while he was trading in mecca, and maybe upon seeing people devoted for their religion he feels envy about it and do want to make one of his own, while other religion spread peacefully, mohammad use force to conquer the arabs and became his subjects because mohammad is a conqueror, he already learned about prophets so he just copied it, his religion never speaks peace, though they say islam is for peace, they actions speaks louder than their words, he would like islam to become supreme religion of all, and all people must embrace it by hook or by crook, mohammad is truly the antichrist, because he islam doesnt recognize that when christ return to this earth it will be the end, they dont believe in that, maybe they would like to say when mohammad returns it is the end of the world, though they recognize christ wasnt born by flesh and return to heaven after death, they dont recognize christ will be the savior of all souls beacuse they envy of him, it must be always mohammad(pbuh), do christ never persuade violence, mohammad did, christ never engaged in fleshy desire, mohammad did, christ teaches love and forgiveness, mohammad taught hate and fear, christ taught not to fear death and follow him for promise of salvation, mohammad promise of absolute hell if you not repent diligently and if you didnt satisfy allah, 
by the way christ means the power of god decends upon him and jesus is the man flesh God has used, so God itself love his children, so he sacrificed jesus for their sins, 
how come did mohammad called he was  a prophet for he has never had the power of God upon him, he havent done any miracle, yeah i forgot he unites the arabs by force, i guess thats a miracle
God gave people of free will whether to inclined with evil or goodness, so he can decide what religion he will follow, islam never teaches free will, it must be islam and nothing else, closing the chances of a person to search and study religions, because its a shame in islam, they used god to justify their word that if you not follow what they say you will not please allah therefore hell awaits you, in their everyday lives they must please allah by killing christians and jews, because it is the biggest threath of their existence, they are afraid so they used force, while christians believed that their force is god's force by giving the love of god, its hard for them to accept that even in their ranks there are arabs who embrace the Love that christ has promised and the salvation awaits, they kill them if they dont renounce their belief, but christian believed that to live is christ and death is gain, so they never afraid death, even they kill them god will bring them up, for god loved the oppressed, christians the more you hate them the more they will love you and pray for you, while muslims if you hate them they will kill you, true only few will be saved on the day of reckoning not even christians, or any religions only those who are chosen and really follow the christ teachings,

ive come to almost believe that god's name is allah, but i dont believed in islam, maybe i should further study it by living and converting to islam, hopefully they will not kill me if after i found wrong to it and renounce my faith,

its interesting to know how they pray? do they pray the words given from koran or directly communicating to god as christians do?

thats one of the questions i should know by becoming one of them,

see you brothers and sisters inshallah!!"
,vespine,2010-01-14T10:47Z,"the qu'ran is not nearly 100% ""right"". If you blindly believe this you are mistaken. There are very many mistakes and contradictions in the qu'ran. Here's a good one:

 He [i.e. Zul-qarnain] followed, until he reached the setting of the sun. He found it set in a spring of murky water.
(Surah XVIII ( Kahf) vs. 85-86)

The sun sets into a spring of murky water? Really? 100% right? "
,FireSign,2010-04-14T23:12Z,"I doubt anyone here, who degrades Islam, knows the true meaning of it... Or has done any extensive research into it.

@Sistromo, If you consider your afterlife a life, then so will i.. =]

@Bodthedog, whats funny about it? The Universe was obviously created by a higher power, and if you read the Quran, it is evidence in itself that the Higher Power DOES care, and DOES want us to live in peace, on the right path. God promises Paradise for living a good, decent, and peaceful life. Your pathetic for laughing at that.

@Bitchtorrent, i doubt how much you know about this Universe. If you were right, a lot more people would listen to you..

@Dynasoar, Science CAN show itself in favor of there being a God (it does infact..), BUT it can NEVER disprove the existence of God. If Science disproved God, there would be no God to create Science...

@Dust_on_mist, you may have your doubts.. But because you DO have doubts, you shouldnt tell anyone whats right and whats wrong, cause your not sure that your correct, this world doesnt need more confused preachers. Your VERY wrong about Islam. It DOES teach free will. Firstly, nothing in islam is compulsary. We may follow it, or we may not. Its ju7st, once people truely start following it, they find it hard to follow only bits of it, since its all truth, and thats bwhat they were searching for.

@Vespine, You are really stupid. That is NOT an example of a contradiction. Learn what a contradiction is. There are none in the Quran. Also, you must know that not everything in the Quran is literal, there are MANY metaphors in the Quran."
,eventide,2010-07-11T19:53Z,"@dust_on_mist: Your comment is full of contradictions. You claimed to have read Muhammad\'s history, yet you don\'t know the miracles he performed (by God\'s will). You said Islam teaches violence, I\'d say you should study the crusades, and you\'ll see who\'s violent. nn@vespine: I believe Qur\'an IS 100% right, but not necessarily the translations/interpretations. That\'s why we keep Qur\'an in its original words/language, because we believe that not a single human can 100% understand its contents. So usually you\'ll find Qur\'an in Arabic language, accompanied by the translations. Different interpretations lead to different groups of Muslims, from the liberals to the radicals.nnFYI, modern Arabic languages are derived from Qur\'anic language -which is metaphoric, ambiguous, and may contain hidden meanings- not the other way around. It\'s impossible to interpret Qur\'an using modern dictionaries.nnThe translation you have there for 18:85-85, I believe it\'s Yusuf Ali\'s? Well, please let me give you some insight:nn\'ayn - though primarily denoting \'spring\', according to many philologists it is also used for \'abundance of water\', like a lake or sea.nnhamiatin - black mud.nnfii \'aynin hamiatin - which in yours is translated to \'in a spring of murky water\', can also be translated to \'in a body of water which contains black mud.\'nnNote: someone claimed that \'majadahaa\' means \""he realized it with cognition\"" as in he (Zulqarnain) found it that way, not just \""sees it.\"" But the claimer wasn\'t a native Arabic, and he was using a modern dictionary, so...nnSo, how can one find (see) the sun setting in a body of water? Hmm, it has to be very wide, wide enough so one can see the sun setting into its horizon, so it must be a big lake or a sea. The lake/sea has black mud.nnHere is Shakir\'s translation:nnUntil when he reached the place where the sun set, he found it going down into a black sea, and found by it a people. We said: O Zulqarnain! either give them a chastisement or do them a benefit. (QS.18:86)nnFun fact (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea - yes, I\'m lazy, sue me...):n1. The Black Sea supports a unique microbial population which produces black sediments probably due to anaerobic methane oxidation.n2. The Black Sea was called \""inhospitable\"" before Greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate, and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes.nn--nThe truth belongs to God only"
