Courage in Red S01E02 â€“ Depot

This 13 part series goes behind closed doors to reveal many aspects of the RCMP. These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.

Episode Info: Since 1885 every RCMP officer in Canada has gone through Depot in Regina, Saskatchewan. It is an incredibly grueling program that teaches respect, honor and discipline. Kevin Marion is 24 years old, and after years of preparation, he will be going to Depot to realize his goal of becoming a Mountie.  His father, Al Marion who is an instructor with the National VIP protection unit, has been Kevinâ€™s inspiration to join the force.  With hard work and a bit of luck, his father will give him his RCMP badge at the end of this 24 week course. But sometimes wanting it doesnâ€™t always mean you get itâ€¦


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
