       Lethal Enterprise
       
       Who are your children hanging around with and what would happen 
       if a fight started? Because of a little-known law called 'joint 
       enterprise' anyone caught up in a serious incident could face the 
       same jail sentence as the person wielding the boot, knife or gun.
       
       The police say it is helping to curb gang violence, but Panorama 
       investigates whether this 'catch-all' policy is also leading to 
       miscarriages of justice.
