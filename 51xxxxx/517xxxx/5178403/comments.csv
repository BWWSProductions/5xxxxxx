Ink is more then a movie - It is an experience. Watch it with a friend because you are going to want to talk about it for hours on end after it's over. This movie does ultimate justice to the possibilities of independent films. It is, hands down, the best movie of 2009. True, it may be a ""cult classic"" and only a margin of people may want to see this movie more than twice, but believe me..this movie changed my opinions on indie films. It doesn't take millions of dollars and high label actors to make a good film - it takes inspiration, ideas, and execution. 

Thank you for the upload."
