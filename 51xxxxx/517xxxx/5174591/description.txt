Norah Jones explained how "Chasing Pirates" came to be, "About a year ago, I did some demos in my home studio. I had some friends come in and we figured out a cool arrangement for 'Chasing Pirates,' with a cool drum part. It went somewhere I didn't expect it to go, and that became a direction to look in."

The song entered the Triple A charts on October 21, 2009 at #13. It became the highest entry on by a female artist on that chart since Alanis Morissette's Everything in 2004. The last single by a female artist to chart at a higher position was another single by Jones, Sunrise. The song entered on the Irish Singles Chart for the first time on #39.
