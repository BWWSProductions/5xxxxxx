,AnthonyNordstrom,2009-11-25T18:35Z,"@khohusen

First go to:
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_41

And download the dll-file. After you've done that locate your windows-folder (C:\WINDOWS) and copy the dll-file to that folder. 

If it still doesn't run after you've done that, try updating your version of direct X. 

Hope you manage to get it working

direct x 11
windows 7

my fix:

used directx/dxsetup.exe update that came with download and set revloader.exe to xp compatability mode.

Now it works.

Thanx 1337free :)"
