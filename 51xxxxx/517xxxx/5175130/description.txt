My first torrent.

(This Is A Direct Rip From A Cd FOR >>> MAXIMUM QUALITY <<< THIS FILE HAS NOT BEEN COMPRESSED)

Dont say "Useless Without Seeds!!" Before youve actualy tried to download, im seeding at 125kbs, But for some reason it dosnt say im seeding :P

I will take this torrent down if i get to 200 Leachers and Less than 10 Seeders, Im seeding at my full bandwith.

Virus scan from Mcaffee can be found here:

                                  SEED PLEASE!
