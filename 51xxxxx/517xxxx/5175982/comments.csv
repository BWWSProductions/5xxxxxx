RAR unzips to a .EXE file.
EXE file has a winzip icon and is extracted with Admin rights, but is not a proper WinZip file,and contains nine files.

I suggest you do another search and find one of the other Jason Derulo ""Whatcha say"" torrents that is NOT 2.98Mb (there is a 5Mb and a 6Mb here on TPB that seem clean)."
