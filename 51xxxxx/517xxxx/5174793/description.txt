Install game.
Apply razor patch (rzr-init.exe).
Extract crackfix, overwrite all.
Install l4d-stminst-x32.reg or l4d-stminst-x64.reg depending on your OS.


Create a shortcut to left4dead2.exe on desktop, add following parameters:

-console -novid +sv_allow_lobby_connect_only 0 +sv_lan 1


Server runs L4D2_LANserver.bat and sets up the game.


Clients run from game console:
connect HOSTNAME/IP


Players need to rename [sorry, the names won't hold a restart], so once:
bind F12 "setinfo name PLAYER"
and then press F12 each time you connect

This worked OK on my Win7 x64. Witches, cola misson, chainsaw - completed whole first act without a problem. For singleplayer just start a server and don't wait for friends :)
