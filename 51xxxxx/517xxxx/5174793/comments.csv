,B.C.G.,2009-11-22T16:22Z,I just hope it fucking works !!!!
,Mitko1239,2009-11-22T17:04Z,Is this crackfix works?
,buner,2009-11-22T17:36Z,I can confirm this shit does not work.
,chimaychanga,2009-11-22T19:16Z,great job this one finally works. Thanks alot
,Derc,2009-11-22T19:56Z,Another FAIL. Probably works... but does the same as the razor with a CTD after 2-5 minutes of play in SP.
,ozke,2009-11-22T22:09Z,This works perfectly fine for me!!!! thanks soooo much!!!!
,nukeleer,2009-11-23T02:34Z,"step 1/ install razor L4D without installing steam
step 2/ run the rzr-init crack
step 3/ unzip this crackfix into l4d install folder, overwrite all
step 4/ restart
step 5/ set up your settings all nice
step 6/ load up a level, anticipate
step 7/ groan in frustration as it crashes
step 8/ wait for next 'crackfix'"
,buner,2009-11-23T10:37Z,"Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
Did the update tonight and all seemed well. Menu and EVERYTHING worked. Except for when it crashed ingame. And by the way, I only used what was on the Razor disc.

What the hell is going on??????????"
,nukeleer,2009-11-25T11:15Z,"Luck!

1/Unrar Iso
2/Mount or burn
3/Install, without steam
***
4/run stryder crack
***
5/ AFTER !!!!! stryder, run rzr-init crack
6/play play play!! two full levels so far.

i've hosted this at a wonderful, 'rapid' service 'share'ing service '.com'. 
To get that link, solve the following riddle: 

/files/311809290/left4dead2.stryder.rar"
,nukeleer,2009-11-25T11:20Z,"oh, and, importants:
if you imported any REG files for any cracks so far, open up regedit and delete the keys.

If you're a noob, or scared of regedit, don't fuck with it. Just walk away. Pay a nerd to 'clean up your computer' because it's 'running slow'."
,twinkle123321,2009-11-27T20:10Z,Nukeeler's method worked. The only extra thing I had to do was the regfix. Been playing about 5 hours with no crash whatsoever. :)
,bapcules,2009-11-28T10:07Z,"Yess !!    it works.  Thanks you very mutch.
PERFECT !!
Die ""L4D2_LANserver.bat"" doppelklicken und im erscheinenden DOS Fenster angeben, Gammodus, Schwierigkeit, Level, etc.
Der ""Client"" startet das Game ganz normal und tritt dem ?steam server? bei.
It Works.

,nukeleer,2009-12-05T09:08Z,"I picked up a witch crash after posting my previous directions, not sure how.
To fix, i downloaded the 2.0.0.0 and 2.0.0.1 and Stryder cracks available off here, and applied them all, along with the original crack.

Pretty sure it was rzrinit -> lonewolf -> 2.0.0.0 -> 2.0.0.1 -> Stryder crack

Bit of a pain but working beautifully now with no witch crashes! I can play Hard Rain!!

*Still has the 'exit' crash. Sometimes quits between levels for no reason.

*CHEATS/MAPS - Open console, type ""MAPS *"" for a list of maps
Then type ""MAP C1M1"" etc for the correct level. No need to type the 'sugarmill' bit just c*m* works.
For cheats to work, start game with console. Type ""sv_cheats 1"", then enter your map in the console eg C5M4 for Bridge, then voila. Cheats up!

Best Cheats Combo for single player asswhooping goodness:

god 1
sv_infinite_ammo 1
give vomitjar
give shotgun_spas
give machete
upgrade_add laser_sight
upgrade_add explosive_ammo

or if you play single and are sick of waiting for your team to come save your ass, try
bind j ""warp_all_survivors_here""

then just hit J when you're being pummeled / smoked /whatever, your team appears to save the day.

In infinite ammo mode you never run out of ammo, chainsaw gas, or throwables. Everything else gets used up as normal."
,Andozer,2009-12-06T12:13Z,Anyone having troubles with sound? Only get sound on the main menu but not in the actual game :-S  
,raviraj87,2009-12-10T16:03Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!! "
