Easily one of the best albums released in 2005. The Soft Hearted Scientists hail from Wales and deserve much more attention than they have received to date, therefore I am uploading this, their best album so far in FLAC format for you to enjoy.

The NME praised it in their review and summed it up as "a new legal high has been unleashed". Think of Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd mixed with the textures of a Moody Blues album with some psycadelic Beatles thrown in but brought into the 21st century kicking and screaming and you'll have a rough approximation of the Soft Hearted Scientists' sound.
