,evilmonkey99,2009-12-11T21:14Z,"thats nice but when i open it up in powerdvd the audio is the narrator of the film. Thats of course me playing it from the hard drive. the ISO is over 21GB so the only way to burn this to a disc in order to viewe the bluray properly with the menus and all is by buying a bluray disc that can hold up to 25GB. Each disc costs around $20 in which case you might as well go buy the original bluray of the HITMAN.
if there is another way to open this movie with powerdvd from your hard drive with the ability to view the menus and everything, let me know.
Thank you."
