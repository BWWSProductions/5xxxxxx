Storyline: Attorney Michael Clayton is a â€œfixer,â€ the go-to guy when his powerful New York law firm wants a mess swept under the rug. But now heâ€™s handed a crisis even he may not be able to fix. The firmâ€™s top litigator in a $3-billion case has gone from advocate to whistleblower. And the more Michael tries to undo the damage, the more heâ€™s up against forces that put corporate survival over human life â€“ including Michaelâ€™s. George Clooney portrays Michael, backed into a career corner that offers little room to fight free in this suspense- and star-packed thriller written and directed by Tony Gilroy (writer/co-writer of the Bourne movie trilogy). Keep your eyes on Michael Clayton. He has some life-or-death decisions to make. Fast.
