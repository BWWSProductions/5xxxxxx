"Doesn't Mean Anything" is a song by American recording artist Alicia Keys. It was released as the lead single from her fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom (2009).

The music video for "Doesn't Mean Anything" was filmed from September 27Ã¢â‚¬â€œ28, 2009 and directed by P. R. Brown. It was released on October 19, 2009.

Mariel Concepcion of Billboard magazine gave the song a positive review, commenting that "A truly confident woman lets herself be vulnerable at the right time" and compared favorably the song to Keys' previous hits 'No One' and 'Superwoman' by saying that "the comparisons are more than welcome, becauseÃ¢â‚¬â€as Keys understands so wellÃ¢â‚¬â€everyone needs love, no matter how independent they may be." Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a highly favorable review, saying that "the production is classic and gimmick-free, the chorus has the same timeless feel that turned 'No One' and 'If I Ain't Got You' into modern standards, and the whole thing oozes class the way a ripe brie oozes cheesey goodness" and then adding "the words 'classic' and 'timeless' apply to the lyrics too."

The song was released through Keys'channel on September 22, 2009, after her performance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards along Jay-Z, singing "Empire State of Mind".

The single was released on the iTunes Store on September 22, 2009, and debuted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 32, making her highest debut in that chart, and has peaked at number 14. It has also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 61, another highest debut for Keys since "No One" debuted at number 71. It also appeared on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 66.

Keys called the song as "very differentÃ¢â‚¬â€it almost feels like you're flying. It has that piano, heavy-drum feeling." She elaborated the song's meaning, saying, "You dream of having all these things, you dream of going all these places. But what's the point of doing that, having that, if the one you want to be there isn't with you?"
