,vanyallo,2009-11-21T17:34Z,Thx but did you watch it? I downloaded one on another website yesterday and it was a fake... So was wondering.
,scott218,2009-11-21T17:43Z,"Yea, it's legit."
,Zenophobe,2009-11-21T20:43Z,hmm...  i can get video but no sound on one player and then in Quicktime the sound is garbled but no video.  Finally opened it with a video file splitter program and video and sound worked so I just let the program output it to a new file so I can watch it.  Could be my codecs are jacked.. but all my other video files and movies play fine.
,xaximus,2009-11-21T21:15Z,I'm not getting any audio either. What kind of fucked up codec did they use?
,scott218,2009-11-21T21:55Z,Try VLC player?
,kamikazee706,2009-11-21T22:50Z,"this is the same exact torrent from iso hunt. Which is grainy, lags and is poor resolution. "
,CylonFrak,2009-11-22T01:43Z,"It's fucked up for me, too.  I've tried it on two different computers (both Windows 7) and it will not even play in Media Player.  Video is just frozen from frame one, and there is no sound at all.

What the hell was this encoded with??"
,scott218,2009-11-22T03:02Z,"Windows Media Player is complete shit, I'm surprised so many people haven't realized this.  

Download VLC player, it will play anything."
,amuser25,2009-11-22T03:04Z,"I imported the show into GarageBand and found out the audio has been compressed and time has been sped up on the audio.  If I knew how to decompress it I would, but not really sure how.  The audio ends at about 40 minutes of the show.  I guess wait till another version comes out or someone can fix this."
,CylonFrak,2009-11-22T04:53Z,"VLC player did play it, but the compression was horrible, the video was skippy sometimes, and the audio was terrible.  I had to fix the audio sync, which was off by 200ms.

Whoever encoded this did a terrible job.

But I really aprpeciate finally being able to see it.  I was beginning to think I'd never get to!  LOL"
,casagemas,2009-11-22T15:20Z,waste of bandwidth... out of sync...
,pinoydownloader,2009-11-22T17:47Z,"I couldnt get it to play on my computer but it played effed up on my dvd player + usb flash, it skipped and the audio was out of sync. The filesize is fishy too, isn't anyone else going to up something? its the same on mininova too"
