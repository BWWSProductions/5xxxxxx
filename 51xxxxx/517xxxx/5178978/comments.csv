,uzielvb,2009-11-26T01:13Z,"i downloaded the current version of kis 2010 from their home and i can't find any option to apply a reg_key file. i only can choose between activating the trial (and the app will bug me constantly with requests to buy a license) or purchase a license, no ""browse"" to key file option like in kis 2009. how can i apply one of these keys in the torrent?"
[V],kentucky-kid,2009-11-26T22:55Z,"@uzielvb

tried activating it offline?"
,uzielvb,2009-11-27T20:19Z,"@ kk
yes i it, i also searched for an answer in the web, there'e a lot of people who ask the same question. i also tried the way with the wrong lisence in the first option (activate commercial lisence...or similar) normally it should show up a popup with three options, in this case the third would be the ""browse to key file"" like descriped in some kaspersky forum but the popup will not appear, that's strange."
,uzielvb,2009-11-27T20:21Z,"i meant ""yes i did"" "

Disconnect from the internet > choose activate trial license > i should try and fail to connect to the server and then give you the option to manually browse for a key. 

@ k-kid
