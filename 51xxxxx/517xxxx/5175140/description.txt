SYNOPSIS

 
His name evoked respect. Human as well as professional. At home as well as abroad.  Jozef Psotka, nicknamed "Juzek", or "mountain worker".  One of the most notable figures of Slovak mountaineering.  A man who conquered the summit of Mount Everest. Now we have the chance to recall his noteworthy life, which was a great story of conquering the world's highest summits.


ZOLO DEMJÁN: "I remember him as a training climber which, at that time, was not a common thing to do."

IVAN FIALA: "The fact that he trained a lot is well-known, but only a few people know that he studied a lot too."

JUZEK PSOTKA: "Up in the mountains, we, climbers, seem to be better people than when we are down-country. Maybe it's because of the mountains we love or because of the feeling of freedom between earth and sky. As if staying in the heights is like some kind of purgation for us, freeing us of the earth; as if we gain wings. Unfortunately, we put the wings aside on the way down."
