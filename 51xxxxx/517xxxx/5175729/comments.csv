[V],nightissuchproximity,2009-11-23T09:36Z,"i need some help guys   am trying to track down a film   no idea what its called


some girl...think she has a brother...girl is delirious...some sort of fever...she's lying there on her bed...white cave of forgetfulness sort of thing...she picks up a blank piece of paper and starts to doodle...what she draws begins to happen

thats all i can remember

yeah not much but if that makes any sense to anyone...?

ive seen it once and have no idea what its called"
,kastlebay,2009-11-23T16:53Z,would have been nice to have the filenames complete and not cut away. why did you do that?
[V],nightissuchproximity,2009-11-23T18:03Z,"why did i do that?   let me see:

...possibly because i was drunk...

and still am...

perhaps because i just knew some twat would come in and ask why i did that...

possibly to annoy every motherfucker who likes to complain despite not having ever uploaded a bloody thing...

i am so sorry...does it not suit you?   Perhaps you'd like your money back!

how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless downloader...

if you download one of my uploads then i expect you to know what to do with it.

if you don't know...then i've got a few choice suggestions as to what you can go and do with yourself
