 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 FolderHighlight is a small but powerful tool that changes the visual       
 appearance of the folders in your PC. With FolderHighlight you can quickly 
 change the color of any folder.                                            
                                                                            
 Even though Windows already allows you to customize folder icons for this  
 purpose, FolderHighlight is a much easier to use as it integrates into the 
 Explorer right-click menu, so you can quickly mark any folder without      
 having to go through additional dialogs.                                   
                                                                            
 We receive about 80% of all information through the eyes, and the same 80% 
 of our memories consist of images. When you are browsing through dozens of 
 visually similar folders, you are not using your vision to its full extent 
 and thus your activity is less effective than it could be. But if some of  
 these folders have a different color, they will catch the eye faster than  
 you read their name. This way you can easily differentiate between folders 
 and browse much faster, because you are using your vision much more        
 efficiently.                                                               
                                                                            
 Enjoy another fine release from HERiTAGE!
