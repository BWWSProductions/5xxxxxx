,Yellowbelly,2009-12-02T14:01Z,For all of you who are on here looking for movies....do not follow any link that promises you a site where you can watch the latest movies for free.....they make you fill out a survey (which in turn will overflow you with spam) then they say your video player needs its latest update....as soon as you click yes you are downloading a herpes like virus (when you try and run virus removers or delete associated files....up pops the Blue Screen of death).  Please use common sense and try to keep your downloads to trusted TPB users.

,tomazagalo,2009-12-06T07:34Z,"First of all thanks for your upload 10/10 no doubt!

I just have a question! or request maybe!
would you be interested in unploading the same movie but without english subs hard coded?
or would that be to much to ask? just so people from other countries like myself and many others could put their own subs without english subs underneath! its anoing having both!

cheers!!!!"
,ZohaibHidayat,2009-12-06T09:22Z,This movie is shit...total waste of time and effort...making a sandwich is less boring than watching this piece of crap

I agree with every single thing you say about this movie, it is a great movie and to people who dont think so, get some decent fucking taste in movies."
,CherryxDarling,2009-12-11T21:20Z,"Is there any chance that you are going to upload the special features for this movie? Quentin Tarantino's special features for all his movies are just incredible and I would hate to miss out on the Inglourious Basterds special features. I would rather buy this movie with the 2 disc thing, but I barely have enough money to pay my rent so if anyone knows where I could download these I would greatly appreciate it. "
,CherryxDarling,2009-12-11T21:24Z,"Oh nevermind the actual movie doesn't come out until December 15 (US) so I'll just wait till then to search for it. But in the meantime if anyone else knows where I could download it, please let me know. Thank you."
,pshark,2009-12-12T01:34Z,"i have a problem,i am hoping that someone may have a solution to my problem,somehow i can't download anything anymore,somehow my ip address as been blocked and i can't use any torrents.....somebody please respond if u think u have a solution....thanxs!"
,Diavir,2009-12-12T03:34Z,"At the people saying this is a bad movie, go back to watching shit like Gamer, Transformers 2, and 2012

This movie ranks up there with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs imo"
,Numskull808,2009-12-14T19:24Z,"tarantino made two good films and they were both rip off of other peoples work. They even made documentaries about how much he steals.  The kill bills he had to give credit to who he is riping off for fear of lawsuits again. He has not had one original idea.

he never even got close to his potential since he was always far too busy copying far more intelligent and talented directors.  He will be  a mediocre footnote in american cinema history...and that's being generous."
,somedude.1001,2009-12-15T18:47Z,"All around a good movie but has a little formularistic, pulp-fiction feel. Alternatively you can call it his (Tarantino's) style."
,Klezworm,2009-12-15T18:59Z,"Great Movie, Tarantino at his finest."
,adamski75,2009-12-15T23:18Z,"iron5299 are you nuts?

,xKonquestx,2009-12-17T07:22Z,"Wow, well anyone talkin shit about a movie that gets a Golden Globe Nomination is an idiot. this film just got nominated for Best motion Picture Drama, not to say i always agree with critics but even a nomination is good for any movie."

,apirateslifeforme,2009-12-18T22:40Z,"Torrent Quality is tip top...
Audio 10
Video 10

A fan of Quentin Tarantino films would probably dig this flick.

Not really an action movie, unless one finds actual substance in the plot ACTION!!! The story is well delivered and could possibly be Tarantinos best work to date. "
,Wopatoolie,2009-12-18T23:05Z,im a huge ww2 movie fan but this is one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen. get the 700mb .avi and watch it before u waste ur time on this dload

Once downloaded can I easily load this sucker on to a DVD-R? Thanks in advance."
,Beladol,2009-12-20T07:42Z,"I have no speech, I have not seen the movies, but the people who bitched about it saying it sucked, well too bad not everyone is like you, not everyone is gonna say OH bob hated well then, i guess we all hate, i mean its BOB! and he HATES! it grow up u didn't pay for it, and if u sat there watching the progress bar slowly increase, well you are sad, you need to get out more, and stop being so sad!"
,trollare,2009-12-22T21:30Z,WOW PURE CRAP ! 
,CherryxDarling,2009-12-23T05:41Z,Anyone know where I can get the special features for this movie? I would greatly appreciate it... 
,DogNo7,2009-12-25T23:18Z,"I have to agree with the bashers on this one.

The film is long and lame, and while I have enjoyed most of Tarantino's films, this was not among the ones I enjoyed, or even liked.

I loathed this film, and can only hope Tarantino's next film is better than this one.

Since this one was such complete shit, I cannot imaging how Tarantino could put out anything worse.

For me, it is a toss up between which was worse, Pulp Fiction or this hideous bag of explosive cow excrement."
,PerNot,2009-12-26T16:10Z,This have or need hard coded subs?
,Gurukai,2009-12-29T11:40Z,"bad ass movie. v=9 a=8. was using WMP and audio was low, so i used VLC and step'd up the audio x2. ended up having to use a headset, guess my laptop speakers just suck."

,Revrant,2009-12-31T12:52Z,"Had to get a different one, just kept sitting there with only a few seeds not doing much, shame too, this one looks to be of the highest reasonable quality."
,max2562,2010-01-04T00:29Z,"No this movie isn't the most spectacular. But lets face it, not all ""Transformer"" movies are the only ones we like to watch. This particular movie was most excellent. I wasn't expecting much what with all the self proclaimed critics. However, I found this to one of Tarantinos best. Maybe everyone was expecting another ""Transformers"" like movie?
I'm actually not a huge Tarantino fan. But for some reason he can make a movie, from time to time, that really grabs me and takes me in with it. 

Audio was not so great. While remaining clear there was a problem with volume. Everything cranked up still left me with my head next to the speakers trying to understand what they were saying, but only a few times. 
Video was better than I expected it to be.

both audio and video are 10

the first time i watched this film i must admit i fell asleep. but the second time i was hooked from start to finish. its worth sticking it out for 20 mins or so trust me then it really gets going.

i thought the story and the cast were superb 
and as usual Tarantino always manages to fill the movie with a great soundtrack which to me made the film have a spaghetti western kind of feel to it."
