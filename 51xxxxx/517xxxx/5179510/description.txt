**** Iron Maiden Live at Donington 1988 Monsters of Rock - The Ultimate bootleg ****

Here I have put together a brand new edit of this concert with a mixture of footage from pro-shot segments and camcorder footage. The sound has been either replaced with pro-recorded stereo sound where available or the existing sound has been cleaned up as much as possible.

This is the complete gig from start to finish. There is even some post gig interviews with Steve Harris and Bruce Dickinson at the after gig party. There is also a pre-gig interview with Bruce Dickinson at the end. 

Don't expect DVD quality as this is an edit from various sources and all from old video tapes.
