Welcome to Project64 1.7.0.49 - The Best Nintendo 64 Emulator :
===================================================================================
This is the Project64 1.7.0.49.

Project64 is an emulator that has been in development for a couple of years. 

Project64 features emulation of the Reality Signal Processor,which was reverse

engineered by zilmar. This information has produced an accurate interpreter

that has turned in to a recompiler by jabo, setting it apart from some of the 

emulators in development today. Another feature in Project64 is an accurate and

fast Display Processor graphics core for OpenGL and Direct3D, developed by jabo

over the last few years.

To get this latest version of Project64, you need to pay, but here it is for all

of you old school Nintendo64 gamers like me.

This release is a pure Mastermind release.
