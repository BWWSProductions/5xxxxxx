I Know Who Holds Tomorrow isn't as consistently engaging as Every Time You Say Goodbye, but that's only a relative term -- from any other artists, this would be a masterpiece. From Alison Krauss, it's another reliably wonderful collection of jaw-dropping fiddling and breathtaking singing. ~ Thom Owens, All Music Guide
