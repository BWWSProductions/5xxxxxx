,ZenRhino,2009-11-25T17:18Z,"is this the full movie? I ask because I saw another release that was 1.37 Gb - but it was the same file twice (one RAR'd & the other, by the same file name, unRAR'd) that was weirdly squished into some strange aspect ratio & missing the last 30 minutes of the film. this is supposed to be 110 minutes... is that what this DVDSCR has?"
,YowzaTheBear,2009-11-26T08:19Z,"Yup, this is the real deal.  It's all here.  It is a screener and sometimes it says ""Spirit Awards"" at the bottom of the picture in small letters.  Thank you so much raymondhome!"
,YowzaTheBear,2009-11-26T08:19Z,"Oh, yeah, quality is excellent."

great movie, really intense, tells it like it is a great story for someone who doesn't understand whats it like not to have all the finer things in life and what really matters the most. "
