If you want to transfer this ISO to your PS2 HDD, please unpatch the ISO with ESR Patcher GUI 0.24 first.

I have burned this ISO to a Sony DVD-R with no problems.
Also, this is on my PS2 HDD and works with HDLoader.

Have fun!

BTW: I can't seed forever as I have limited bandwidth. Please seed at least 100% of the file size. Thanks :)"
,gahaj123,2010-03-22T19:40Z,thanks for the esr info and the upload. Ill seed for about two weeks

,deadplayerz,2011-12-12T11:09Z,how to seed i first time using piratebay
,Maturame,2012-01-16T21:29Z,Many applications used to torrent files such as utorrent will automatically seed at an appropriate rate assuming no settings have been tampered with. Just keep the torrent in the application for a week or so (or more if you're a good person ;D) after you've finished downloading it.
,Maturame,2012-01-16T21:31Z,I'll definately be starting this torrent when I get home and I'll keep seeding for...hmm...how about the remainder of this semester of college at least? (This is day one of this semester so that'll probably be about 16 weeks)
,RoyalPunkAss,2012-03-15T16:49Z,"Downloading now. I hope this is what I'm looking for.
Can someone confirm this works all the way on emu ?
What about the size ? I found some releases on emuparadise which sized at ~2.9 GB.
