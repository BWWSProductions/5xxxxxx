,scottsasse,2011-06-25T02:22Z,"Cool, it's seeding now!! Real slow but at least it still alive. Will seed for a long time when done. Many THANKS to apisto for the upload and those who help seed and keep rare torrents like this alive!! Lotta Love, DrScott"
,scottsasse,2011-06-25T22:39Z,Well I'm at 45.7% now so you people can see how slow it is (at least 24 hours later)!! Good things come to those who wait and believe me it's worth it. DrScott
