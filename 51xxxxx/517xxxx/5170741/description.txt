Satan would change their name to Blind Fury after the release of their debut ''Court In The Act''. The former singer Brian Ross was replaced by Lou Taylor who was in Satan once before and himself was also, ironically, replaced by Brian Ross. After they released ''Out Of Reach'' they changed their name back to Satan and Michael Jackson joined on vocals. In 1988, the band changed it's name again, this time to The Kindred and then to Pariah (UK). They recorded three more albums and then quit. They announced a reunion with Brian Ross in 2005.
