Build A Low Cost Automastic Impedance Bridge, shematic, theory and windoz software.
A really nice LMS Impedance Bridge, using only a LM358, 6 resistors, 5 of them
shuold be 1% or better, a rotary switch and cabels to your soundcard.
I use it daily, messuring Impedance, capacitance, inductace, resistance.
A relly cool prosject, low cost, easy to build and VERY usefull.
