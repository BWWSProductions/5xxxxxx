,Death-Dude-72,2010-04-14T02:41Z,"Yeesh, glad someone uploaded these books. I dont know what I'm thinkin, since I'm being raised in a Christian family. Perhaps I'm just a curious 15 year old, or perhaps I know that what my dad preaches is a lie. Was brought to Church every Sunday and I hated it. I listened, and tried to understand, but something just kept telling me it was all BS. So, maybe this was meant to be. Maybe I'll post another comment after I read a book or two. But wish me luck for now I guess."

,kidcubensis,2010-05-24T21:58Z,"i believe religion is for the weak, people cant stand the thought of dying, so they make up fairy-tales to keep people in line before they die, ""if your a good little boy you get presents""
kinda sounds like ""if your a good little christian you get heaven"" bullshit "
