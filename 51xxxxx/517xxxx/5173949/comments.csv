,OwlPox,2009-11-22T15:48Z,"I have torrents for the Tom Myers vids and for the neo-Reichian psych, but not for the Stanborough videos.  I might in a couple of years.  I mention the Stanborough discs because they add to the material here, not because there is a torrent for them.  His sales are not like Riggs & Myers so I won't rush out to do a rip of his stuff yet.  He isn't a slick marketer like the others and needs a few more sales before someone ups a torrent.  Good stuff and cheap education."
,OwlPox,2009-11-22T15:53Z,"I waited a year before doing an up of the Myers Bodyreading 101 vids.  Myers is a lot richer and has excellent sales, still I let him sell a few before I did a torrent.  I want to encourage the guy to make a few more DVDs.  The Art Riggs vids here have awesome sales so I don't give him a lot of sympathy for a rip.  Stanborough is under appreciated."

Thank you, nicely thought out. I appreciate that and your torrents."
