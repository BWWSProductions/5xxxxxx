it says stealth check passed..

but verification failed.
so stealth not verified.

that could mean that if you play it you could end up banned from going online with your xbox.
if anyone can figure out how to fix this i would be grateful."
,milhouse_,2010-12-22T07:33Z,"for those who are intrested, this game has

xex crc ADF58E3D
xex media id *-377C0D1E
ssv1 angle 359, crc AB445328 (rawss = CC621E80)
dmi crc 33131311

this game does pass the basic stealth check, but is unverified by abgx because there is no .ini for it..."
,polarhawk,2011-03-24T18:05Z,"the game asks if it should upgrade my console as soon as i load it. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid, but will this block my xbox due to AP 2.5? And if it does, will I still be able to play my old backups afterwards?"
