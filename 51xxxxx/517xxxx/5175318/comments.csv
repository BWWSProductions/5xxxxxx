Note: AVG flags the keygen as \""Trojan horse Generic15.AUXR\"". This is a false positive and should be ignored."
,sabian.ro,2009-11-23T15:41Z,Some feature are beta for 7.
,zeldafan1982,2009-11-26T04:37Z,"Works great on my XP SP3, thanks :)"
,agov,2009-11-27T18:39Z,"Many thanks, Oikake! In my case, had to turn off anitivirus (avast) before enter the keygen."

,Talking_Evil,2009-12-01T20:56Z,"This is a great Firewall. I've been using it for about a week now, Block's all the Fucked Up shit you don't want Screwing up your System. "
,MsThang89,2009-12-06T14:34Z,Thanks.  Works great with XP and Windows 7.  Def turn off Avast as it deletes the key gen.
,blackasian,2009-12-12T06:27Z,this sure is not for win7 it says the software was developed before windows7 however you can continue the install. not what i was looking for.
,valahul,2009-12-13T11:37Z,"ImYoungxD, if you d贸nt trust the keygen, BUY THE SOFT.
Someoane else make some key for you?
Stupid, man
you are stupid."
,dark_TT,2009-12-21T15:39Z,seems like a good firewall.. any recommendation for the antivirus..?
,ForFun00,2009-12-30T00:37Z,"Oikake, Thanks a lot!!  It works like a charm. Using WXP SP3.

,GrotesqueArachnid,2010-02-16T20:06Z,How are you supposed to update it? Just DL the free updates?
,praddyisme,2010-02-20T18:59Z,"awesome firewall 
awesome torrent "
,nicehs,2010-02-24T20:08Z,"thanks!
this works well on 64bit Win 7 ultimate, but didnt work on 32bit Windows server 2008.
also this can't be updated, it just sends you to ZA's page to buy it. another thing.. this reminder keeps popping up asking me to update it (which doesnt work), I tell it to ask me again in 60 days but it still pops up many times per day.. annoying."
,That_Sneaky_Jew,2010-02-26T21:43Z,Mine keeps telling me it has to update my service pack... but I have SP3 on XP
,iiiratep,2010-03-20T03:54Z,"I installed this on Windows XP and it worked perfectly. I used it for months until switching to Windows 7.

So anyway, today I tried installing this on Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit. It did NOT work. The mouse froze and I was getting no keyboard input. I had to restart, but when the Windows loaded again the system immediately froze up as it had before. I eventually had to go to safe mode to uninstall the thing.

So take my advice and don't install this on Windows 7 at all costs. The warning message at the start of the install claiming that it is not Windows 7 compatible should have been proof enough, but since no one here had commented I tested it out myself.

But for all you XP users, this is the best torrent to download. Like I said, I used it for months on XP with no problem.

Looks like I'm stuck without a decent firewall until someone uploads a newer version of ZA. :]"
,skorp77,2010-03-22T23:46Z,"@iiiratep 
This product works fine with WIN 7!!! 
I tryed it cause i am a idiot and well your right it did freeze up on me, did the safemode thing and did some investigating on how to fix it. 

My problem was because i had MSE MS Esstentails installed and something interacts with MSE and ZA. 

****************************************
WINDOWS 7 WORKS FINE 
DONT USE MSE AND ZA THATS YOUR PROBLEM

[T],nlx_78,2010-03-26T10:07Z,"Works like a charm on Vista 32 bit Home-Edition. AVG did not pick the Keygen as a (false) positive as someone above mentioned.

Thanks uploader!!"
[T],nlx_78,2010-03-26T10:24Z,"Only thing i dislike after using it since 20 minutes. When i want to update it comes with a program update as well:

ZoneAlarm Pro 2010

Anyone know how to hide this? Did not find it as such yet. 

TY"
,major9211,2010-03-26T15:03Z,"it works.

after restarting several times it stayed registered....trying to update....lets see what comes out of that."
,Dnanjiru,2010-04-11T23:50Z,"Just an fyi for those using W7,
There have been a lot of issues with this program running on W7 currently.

,Quinvex,2010-10-08T14:08Z,"DO NOT USE IT!

,RafVne2,2011-11-23T05:19Z,"I too had problems with it... it sometimes started just blocking everything from something even though it was on the safe list then, it stopped showing any logs, so I had no idea what it was doing,but the worst was, it caused programs freezes... and you couldn't even stop processesrestart was the only viable option.....shitty program"
