The raw MPEG2 transmission is about 4900Kbps."

The skate race started to, but then stopped, and now isn't doing anything.  The relay download hasn't started.  There are 17 seeds and 9 peers for the skate race and 18 seeds and 10 peers for the relay race.  Why isn't it starting?  Is it something with my Vuze network, or what is it?  Thanks in advance!"

You setup a VPN tunnel from where ever you are to Sweden and come out onto the internet in Sweden - a bit like a proxy. This should prevent your ISP doing naughty things to your internet traffic.
