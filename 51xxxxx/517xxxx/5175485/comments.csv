,andi915,2009-12-15T16:54Z,"I don't know what happened to you all, but when I downloaded it and streamed it to the tv, the sound was a 10, and the video was a 10! The video was clear and colored perfectly as it would be in theaters, or on dvd, and the sound is impecable. Maybe you guys who experienced problems need to download different codecs? Just a suggestion. Thanks for the up moursi! Andi915"

,leannenude,2009-12-27T08:14Z,"I find the video/audio quality to be very good, and inline with other XVID movies of this size/length.
Copied directly to my DVD/Divx player, Video 9 Audio 9.  Played on my computer with Media Player Classic, video 8 Audio 9
People have difference equipment and software, but there's nothing wrong with the quality of this copy.  Thanks for the upload, I downloaded this in an hour & I'll seed it back."
