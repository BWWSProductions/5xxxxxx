        True Colour, 256 colour, 16 colour, and Monochrome graphics, and        
        animating in any mode or combination of modes, with AVI editing         
        support. It features all the essential graphic tools you'll need        
        in everyday use, in a neat and very easy to use manner. Whether         
        you are a newbie or a professional, you'll be amazed how you            
        managed without it. Supporting GIF and JPG formats (and many            
        more besides), it is the perfect package for designing web              
        graphics. It is also fantastic for photo editing, with many             
        tools including a tool for eliminating red-eye, image                   
        sharpening, and full support for printing out images. Its               
        versatility makes it the essential graphics tool, whatever your         
        needs are. Even if you already have a much more expensive paint         
        package you'll find Saint Paint Studio to be invaluable.                
        Developed for use in the games industry by artists and

        Saint Paint Studio Features                                             
                                                                                
        Images in Saint Paint are device independent (DIBs). When you           
        edit your image, all the information about the palette, and the         
        colours used will be saved internally and retained. Other paint         
        software utilities are well known to alter palettes and images          
        internally especially when saving, which can lead to no end of          
        headaches.
