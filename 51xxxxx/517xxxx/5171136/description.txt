The video is set at Camp Holadios, a fictional summer camp. While the band members are all staying there, Forrest becomes interested in chasing a girl who is also at camp. The music video has a very interesting aesthetic, as campers play with pogs. At the end of the video, the sign states "Summer of '91". It also is reminiscent of the film Wet Hot American Summer. One of the references to this movie is when Forrest puts on the headband and sunglasses similar to the change that "Coop" undergoes to win the affection of a girl with the same name, "Katie". The camps name is hellogoodbye in Spanish.
