Here is a misc selection of Latex pics that I've aquired from Usenet over a few months. Pics are sorted into various folders and rar'ed. It's a no-spam post, and if there are any off topics in there, it's simply what I downloaded too. There is approx 1.8gig of pics I think, I hope you like em. High-speed line so shouldn't take too long to initial seed. I've had to rar the files as I had trouble uploading the .torrent for them. rar is NOT password protected.
