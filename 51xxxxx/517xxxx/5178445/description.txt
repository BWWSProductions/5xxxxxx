 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 PDF Imposition DE software automates the process of 2up'ing or 4up'ing a   
 pdf document, so for example with a/b 2up page 1 is on the left and page 2 
 is on the right, with split 2up (4 page document) page 1 is on the left    
 and page 3 is on the right, then page 2 is on the next page left and page  
 4 is on the right. It has an optional -down parameter for 2up'ing          
 downwards on a page rather than across the page (left, right). The output  
 page size can also be controlled and the 2nd page position can be offset   
 with margin controls. Optional -duplicate option for duplicating pages so  
 you get the same page 1,1 left and right output. Optional rotate all, odd  
 or even pages option.

 If you really like this software, consider purchasing it!  Seriously, keep 
 the hard working programmers paid; Motivate them to create more good stuff 
  for us to pirate.  If you don't care about this software, then delete it
