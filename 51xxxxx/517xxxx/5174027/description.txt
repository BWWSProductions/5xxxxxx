*** See Bert's Cowboy Boot Billboard
Yet another piece of Bert's Times Square artwork is a billboard of cowboy boots. He gives a runthrough of the existing PSD file of this billboard, which include separate layer sets for the actual boots, the lights, and the billboard itself.

*** Create Cowboy Boots and Textures
Use Adobe Illustrator to draw the booth. Create individual paths for each element of the boot, including the shape of the boot and the embellishments. Select all the paths, copy, and paste in a new document. Name the paths "boot". Fill the paths with colors for the base, then apply a snakeskin texture made in Illustrator.

*** Apply Textures to Boot
Scale the snakeskin textures and rotate to fit the orientation of the boot. Blend the textures together with a soft brush and a layer mask. Adjust any colors so that the textures match, then clip the layer to the shape of the boot. Edit > Transform > Warp the texture and spread the edges to match the container Apply dodging and burning for highlight and shadow effects.

*** Add leather stitching
Learn how to apply stitching to the boot by creating a new custom brush with lots of spacing. Load the stitching paths in a new layer, and apply the pattern. An outer bevel and emboss helps to add depth.
