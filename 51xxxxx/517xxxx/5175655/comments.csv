,Destructo_Dom,2009-11-23T07:02Z,is it a CAM or DVDSCR or what ?
,Destructo_Dom,2009-11-23T08:39Z,"cmon poophead5 , you are VIP...the source of the file is very important , People like myself prefer not to watch CAMS...More info on the files would be much appreciated...For anyone else I only have about 20 mins left of downloading. I will comment on the quality/src of the file once its finished..."
,Destructo_Dom,2009-11-23T09:03Z,"its a CAM

very very poor quality

Video is a 2 (gets really dark at times and out of focus)

Audio is a 2 (echos and people laughing)

i would wait for something better....someone named poophead would upload this , because it is 100% shit..."

,Destructo_Dom,2009-11-30T05:18Z,"0wesly0 , im not expecting DVDrip fast....it just helps to write in the description what we are downloading. im not one to download cams , and its not unheard of for a screener to leak the week the movie comes out...it does happen. xmen origins workprint was out a month before the movie came out in theaters..."
