Wrong Turn At Tahoe (2010)

Love. Honor. Power. Fear of death... People live for all kinds of reasons. Life becomes the ultimate battle when all you're living for is revenge. Joshua (Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr.), a hard-nosed collector for a ruthless mob boss (Miguel Ferrer), lives in a world filled with brutal violence and beautiful women. But when he finds himself in the middle of a power struggle with the most dominant drug lord in the business (Harvey Keitel), Joshua knows that one false move could cause everything to come crashing down. Packed with intense action and gripping suspense, this explosive tale of vengeance shows how just one wrong turn can lead to a dead end.
