I'm not sure I uploaded these correctly.
They're showing up as having peers connected in uTorrent, but I'm not seeing any percentages there.
Let me know if there's something I need to be doing. It's been a very long time since I uploaded anything, and it was onto Demonoid, which was a whole lot easier and straight forward.
THANKS!"

Sounds like you know what you're doing.  
Cool, slick music you're making! 

The thing I'm having trouble with is getting these torrents seeded.  They're showing up here on TPB as having seeders and leechers, but in uTorrent they are not, with only tiny bits of activity here and there.  I don't get it.  And apparently, neither are many other people getting these sounds.  
Anybody help? 
Thanks."
