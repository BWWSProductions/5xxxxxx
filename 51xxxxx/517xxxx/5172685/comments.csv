,Mr_Magic_Fingers,2009-11-29T04:55Z,"Hi,
Great download. Thanks! However, the Keygen provided does not provide the proper version Key for this software. The one generated (at least in my case) will unlock it and allow you install it and to use it but the next time you run the software it come up and says ""Pardon me but..."". It goes on to explain that the key that I used was not for this version of the software and was for and upgrade. It could not find a qualifying product on system (a new install of Win 7).
Has anyone else had this issue? is there a newer/better Keygen for this Adobe product?
Thanks again,
MF"
,Race_Coach,2009-11-29T05:44Z,"This is the exact same probem as other V 8.0 downloads on this site. The keygen acts the same way. The Keygen shows only the TRIAL version. You put that serial number in and run the software. Next time you start up, you have to install a license again. But, this time it says you have to select a product to upgrade from. The pulldown is empty and you have no serial number to enter.

I can't believe there are this many seeders of a piece of crap.

Prove me wrong. Tell me how to get this working."
,Mr_Magic_Fingers,2009-11-30T14:02Z,"Hi,
I thought it was just me. I think I am going to remove this ""seed"" from my system. I am very new to the torrent stuff, hope I got the term right. No need is distributing a bad copy of something.
But the ""trial"" version seems to be quite nice... I would like to have it.
Any got a good key to activate this product??

,toadflax2,2009-11-30T16:34Z,I downloaded a similar Elements 8 torrent from another site and get an 'insert disc' message - I've tried several times with this and CS4 but in the end gave up and went back to Elements 7 which installed easily - I'm running Windows 7 ultimate 64 - this is the problem - all these worked on vista 64
,Mr_Magic_Fingers,2009-11-30T22:20Z,"Hi,
I am running a fresh install of Win 7 Enterprise. My Photoshop Elements 5 installed and works fine. The problem on my end with ver 8 here is getting the right Key. I have not tried to install my CS3 yet. I probably will tonight. 
I am new to the Win 7 world - had VISTA on my system for less than 45 days/ I could not stand it. Win 7 is ""counter intuitive"". I want my XP back, but I can't. I have to learn this Win 7 stuff.

,Mr_Magic_Fingers,2009-11-30T22:23Z,"Hey Toadflax2,
Where did you get your Elements 7? Do you have a working Key Gen for it? I'd settle for a good working ISO image of 7 with a Key Gen.
MF"
,Race_Coach,2009-12-01T22:42Z,"I am using a good, clean version of Elements 7 on Windows 7 Pro.  The torrent and keygen work. I am seeding. Not sure how to point you to it, but it is 451 MB, and it's simply called Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.  Elements 8 has some nice, new features and it would be great if someone could get the keygen working on Windows 7."
,Mr_Magic_Fingers,2009-12-02T03:28Z,"Hi,
I have D/L the PSE 7 from here: 
[isoHunt] Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 Keygen-LnDL.torrent
It was a good copy and the Key Gen works well under Win 7. I have been using it a solid 2 days now and have been in and out of it dozens and dozens of times along with system reboots. It had not changed its status - still a full install.

,richienu,2009-12-04T00:58Z,"Seems to be a problem getting good keygens for Elements 7 AND 8. I was able to get keygens for Photoshop CS4 and Lightroom 2.3 from Tam/Core. Their keygen for Elements 7 was no good, though. The keygen writers probably figure people want keygens for the more expensive programs. I gave in and bought Elements 8 from Costco for $56. "
,PrimoPup,2009-12-06T00:16Z,"Its works just fine, that is why there are so many SEEDERS... Try patching your host file!!!"
,PrimoPup,2009-12-06T00:17Z,Forgot to add i am on Vista Ultimate x64
,Marco_Jesus,2009-12-09T10:05Z,"I have Elements 7 working fine and got Elements 8 with that issue of ""Pardon me.."" i`ve made some Google search and found a DLL wich seems to fix that problem, the only thing that i`m not sure is that when you go to ""About Elements..."" you`ll see: Try out version, I`m waiting to see if it holds that way! The DLL is named Amtlib.dll, it works on CS4, and so far no more: ""Pardom me.."" Sorry for my bad English."
,guruPirate,2009-12-10T09:59Z,"you guys are goofballs!

"
,TayzGpa,2009-12-18T23:57Z,Keygen works but after 2nd launch it tells you that the serial is invalide.  Did the hosts file change as well as deleting the updater6 folder.
,siddhu93,2009-12-27T17:23Z,Easy guys after activation just block photoshop elements with your firewall simple...........isnt it?.enjoyyyyyyyyyyyy
,mohanlal2000,2009-12-30T16:23Z,"siddhu93 and others

Just wondering how do you block Photoshop Elements with your firewall? I am using AVG Anti-Virus free.

Also, were you able to get rid of the trial version message?

I deleted the folders as mentioned above and patched the hosts file, but no luck yet.
Thanks! "
,siddhu93,2009-12-30T17:14Z,"avg free edition does not have firewall.use windows firewall or download any other firewall program to block.for u mohan just uninstall and install a fresh version and switch off internet connection and then use the key.dont do any patch just block it with firewall simple.enjoyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

,mohanlal2000,2010-04-22T06:29Z,"Hi siddhu93.

I started getting those serial numbers message all over again. And it says that the trial version is expired.  My NIS is expired.

Any ideas?

Thanks"
,iamZIIIM1,2010-07-31T01:15Z,"i'm also getting the error message. i patched the host files, but it didn't work. can someone tell me how to block it with firewall, i'm using esset nod 32 antivirus 4.  "
,ozc,2010-09-08T04:02Z,"If you don't need a full bloated version of photoshop then you might not need the condensed bloated elements program either. 
Try Paint.NET. Its free, easy to install, and a lot less hassle. I stick it on computers I service for customers and its easier for them to understand. 
The only pirated thing I stick on their computers is ACDSee 3.1 because everything else for browsing images sucks."
