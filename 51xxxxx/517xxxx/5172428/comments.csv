,philteeth,2009-11-22T08:00Z,There's a new English version!  New.Moon.2009.cam.xvid-Poison.  Decent Quality but def. cam-quality.  Search it on here.   You're welcome guys.
,azrielle,2009-11-22T11:02Z,"Downloaded in it's entirety.  No sound either with VLC or Irfanview.  Video is not particularly sharp, but OK."
,azrielle,2009-11-25T09:44Z,"Since there's no way to edit previous comment, update--some random glitch in my computer prevented the sound from working--on anything!  Anyway, the sound works fine--if I understood Spanish, but will share with some friends that do, and are too poor to go see it in the theatre."
