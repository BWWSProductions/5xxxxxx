Resistance is futile, so Atomic TV has decided to jump on the Lounge-a-palooza bandwagon, pledge allegiance to the Cocktail Nation and embrace Swankness in all its fez-hatted, zoot-suited, retro swing silliness... First up is a vintage commercial break paying homage to our legendary local blue-collar brew, Natty Boh. Then we drop by our fave watering hole, Henninger's Tavern, where owner Kenny Vieth spoils us with food and drink while we we enjoy â€œincredibly strange space-age bachelor pad exoticaâ€ music videos by Combustible Edison, Korla Pandit, Martin Denny, Spike Jones & His City Slickers, a rare Raymond Scott Quintette film appearance, 1940â€™s â€œSoundiesâ€ music shorts, the hepcat hokum of Baltimoreâ€™s own Swinginâ€™ Swamis, Don Knotts as "The Love God," tributes to patron Saints of Swing Dean Martin and Buddy Love and assorted clips from drinkinâ€™ flicks! Time flies when you're having rum, so â€œdrink up and be somebody!â€
