I patched this myself to allow playing from DVD and get around the time limit problem. Just unrar and burn to DVD. Tested with a softmodded 4.1U Wii and NeoGamma R7


From what I've heard so far, this might not work with a hardmodded Wii, just softmodded.


For the few having problems after burning or while burning, I use imgburn and I have Sony and Memorex DVD's and haven't had any problems with any of my games. Burn at the slowest setting. Some people may still encounter problems playing and that may be due to the version of NeoGamma you are using and other factors about your softmodded Wii.
