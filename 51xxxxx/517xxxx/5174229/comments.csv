,nofx98,2009-11-22T10:06Z,So you say we don't need those stupid USB loaders now just burn it on DVD and play right?
,zxkb4s29,2009-11-22T12:51Z,"no, this still needs softmod. not working with modchip."
,tgcleader,2009-11-22T13:11Z,plz seed it was going like 300 mbps then now its going 0.1 mbps and it shows no seeders and is at 59.7% so somebody plz seed thanks.
,tgcleader,2009-11-22T13:18Z,So even if I have D2Pro modchip not softmod I still need a usb loader cause I tried another verfsion of this and it worked for a few minutes then it would give me an error saying that it has encountered an error and to eject the game disc and restart you Wii will this one do the same thing?
,nofx98,2009-11-22T14:05Z,"Can someone answer me that why is it necessary to put the games up like this?I mean only for softmod and USB craP?WHy can't it be the good ol DVD ISO burn way?I mean if someone like me is new to this i need to get the homebrew channel.after i did that need to install at least 3 more apps OR get an usb loader and a new HDD for my wii to play these?Why is this easier than just donwload,brun,and play huh?"

We have to resort to this now because of security features that are now employed that older games and older systems did not have. Since piracy has become so big, so has the need to prevent it. Make due with what you have and stop complaining or just go out and buy your games. "
,VDDZ,2009-11-23T07:57Z,"???

It looks like you can burn this to a disk, after you unrar the img.  But for a softmodd wii u need hbc+bmii to softmodd.  Only then could you even dl an app to boot a burned fixed disk like this. 

Savvy?"

Obviously you're a little new to this or you would have understood that in order to run NeoGamma R7, you need HBC (Home Brew) to install NeoGamma and the posting before that where I mentioned that security for anti-piracy is huge so it's more complicated to play downloaded games now."

If I cant get it to work I am just going to have to go out and buy it."

,Mackaber,2009-11-27T08:27Z,"So I followed all the instructions, but I still have the error message that says I have to restart my wii, I don't know what I did wrong my config is NeoGamma rev 8 CIOS rev 14, and Wii menu 4.0 without the softmii; 

By the way, I discovered a little trick, while I solve this; when you got the error message just take out the disc and reinsert it again, you will continue from the part you stopped (sometimes Nintendo can be so stupid with his security measures)..."

,xshadow88,2009-12-01T04:34Z,"hey. am I not suppose to be able to open or view the iso once I extract the main file. Reason I ask is because it says when I try and open or view the iso it says ""the archive is either an unknown format or damaged"". And I want to know if somehow I may have downloaded it wrong because I have my wii all set up to play this burned game but its not reading the disc."
,gocrning,2009-12-01T06:49Z,"Message to Metallicaisgod or someone else that cares to answer my question.

Is it impossible to hack the game so that this new protection is disabled?  I am using a D2PRO which I have just learned is considered a hard-mod.  This is the first game I have run into that requires the soft-mod process that I have been reading about during the past few days.

Are the days gone of hard-mod only?"

Here are the steps i followed...

- After downloaded and extracted copied to mi Hard Disc with WBFS Manager. It only tooked 350 mb of space in the hard disc :O.

- I changed the following settings in UsbLoader becouse I became a black screen on loading:
   - IOS 249
   - Error 002 fix ON
   - Black IOS Reload ON

Hope it work's for you guys.

,what_are_those_things,2010-01-07T01:32Z,"Thanks dude, you are the man!

My wii is the LU64 with 4.2 U Firmware

I tried several times to get this to work off the disk and I would get the green screen each time.

It works great when loaded as an iso on my USB hard drive!


I used wbsf manager 3.0 to format and transfer the iso over to my USB Hard drive  (Free)

hXXp://wbfsmanager.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=26808




Then used USB Loader GX to load the game through HBC

http://sites.google.com/site/usbloadergui/downloads/forwarders



Neogamma (all versions will not work on my Wii)




p.s.

The USB Hard drive I used for this is really a thumb drive..


HP USB Flash Drive (v100w) only $20 bucks


Thanks again for the work done on this iso"

Softmodded Wii 4.1E. It works with the standard settings of Neogamma or USB Loader GX (latest versions). Burned with slow speed (2-4x) on DVD-R disk booktyped DVD-ROM.

For those who do not know: Scrubbed versions are simply disk images without the useless garbage which Nintendo packed on the disk to inflate to the size of a DVD 5... So no waste of bandwith or HD / SD space!

NB: This version does not include European languages like German or French but it's not really a problem for this game anyway.

THANKS for sharing!!  :-))"

worked for me, others wouldnt work at all, or gave way too many disc read errors.

Btw this is my setup and what worked for me: (Hope it helps others)
-Burned @ x6 verbatim DVD-R. (DVD+R @ x16 gave me sporadic read errors)
-I HAD to use Neogamma loader (v8 b15) or USB Loader GX. (Must Insert Disc after selecting neogamma or it black 

screens)

-HAD to use Neogamma Settings:
Region options: Force vid ""Wii"", Patch vid. ""ALL"".
Config Options: Alt.dol. ""DISC""

-Had to use USB Loader GX Settings:
GameLoad-> Vid.Mode ""AutoPatch"", VIDTV ""ON"", Error 002 fix ""Yes"", Alt.Dol.""Default""

(Ocarina codes worked just fine thru both apps)

Other info:
Wii NTSC v4.1u, wiikey v1, startpatch: regionfree enabled, updates disabled. Installed CIOS: 250, 249, 222, 

202, 36-30, 21, etc.

I think I may have used wiibrickblocker on this I dont remember, but is probably not needed."
