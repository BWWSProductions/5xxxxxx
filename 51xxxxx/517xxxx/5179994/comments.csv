,Disnej77,2010-08-29T10:41Z,"Hi. Respect! I guess You Ripped the original DTS tracks from the 5.1 DVD's But tell me where you took the ""extras"" and b-sides in DTS from? As long as I know they have not been released in DTS 5.1 so they must be some ""upmixes"". I am not complaining - I am just curious. I cannot wait till I get your creation in full. Greetings! Respect! Keep seeding!"
,Disnej77,2010-08-29T10:42Z,...It's me again. If it is not a secret - telll me please what software You used to make this DVD. Thank You.
,KaRAS101,2011-01-07T16:29Z,I AM SORRY BUT THIS DVD IS NOT DONE BY ME. I THINK THIS IS THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION MADE IN RUSSIA;)
