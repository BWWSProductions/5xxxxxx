what is it? avi or mkv?
why rar such a small file to begin with?
why absolutely no description?

im not saying this might be fake or anything... id just like to know if im wasting time and effort on something im not gonna be able to watch.. 

i mean seriously.. how hard is it to write  avi or mkv in the description?

and to the inevitable posts of ""be happy its free' and 'what have you uploaded lately' ill just say ""shut the hell up you brown nosed retards""
now to save time in the long run.......

if your gonna provide a service then at least put half your ass into it"
