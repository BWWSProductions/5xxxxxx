,FuckSholihin,2009-12-11T06:51Z,i dont lose anything even if nobody downloading this torrent....... from what you people should know is that i was never spamming my torrent nor insisting people to download.
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-14T15:27Z,yeah yell all you like. you just saying that because you hate me! you were constantly running wild with your comments! people will see the comments from that torrent and people can judge it.
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-15T16:04Z,haha you stupid prick. no one remove the comment. his comment was gone because he closed his ID so the comments automatically gone!
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-15T16:07Z,i think the people with empty upload should grow up instead of being a damn leecher!
,KayossZero,2009-12-17T12:46Z,"TJ hasn't retired at all to those that want to know he just doesn't use this site at all anymore, anyways don't even bother downloading this as it's outdated and worthless instead go to Demonoid for his December releases."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-18T10:02Z,"MasterBlaster903
excuse me, i never said that i was a fucking pirate god. i'm human not the god.

""I had around 10-20 torrents here a few years back before I closed it under another name.""

how can we be sure that? that quote is just like an old fashion style.... if you really had a fucking famous profile then why did you close??? isnt that a curiosity? you might be a lying big mouth. i bet you are not mr HEARTBUG!"
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-18T10:33Z,"@MasterBlaster903 - foolish mortal. so you are claiming that you used to be fucking former pirates on here!!!!? if so, why you can't understand how TPB works with the comment and/or how a closed ID affected the comments? your 1'st comment are soooo fucking blind accusing me deleting comment! every former (including virus uploader/hacker) knows that no one can disable/exploit the comments. you are completely doom idiot with your so-called `former status'! 

sorry to say that.


p/s: anyone please dont bother trying to be an english teacher here because this is not the school or kindergarten...

FYI: english is my fifth language and i fucking knew that!!! i'm still 19 and it's too early to rush for noting."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-20T05:04Z,"@MasterBlaster903

I've tried lots of progs that change it, but they all give an error, even the microsoft script doesn't want to do it...
Probablly cause of the Script Host being disabled...
