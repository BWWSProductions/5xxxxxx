Windows XP Performance Edition SP3 - April 2009 V2

Original Size: 595 mb
New Size: 279 mb (Difference of 316 mb)
(This is the Size of the ISO)

This supports ALL Languages and ALL Keyboard Layouts.

This is a FULL Install. You CANNOT Upgrade from previous versions of Windows.
There is no validation required. This PASSES WGA. This works 100% with Windows Update.
I have included the CD-Key already in the install process. This means at no point will you have to enter it.
Some people using Macs or Virtual Machines might need the serial. See Serial.txt if you do need it.
This has all windows updates through April 2009. This is has been tested numerous times with no errors.
This has minimalist Internet Explorer 6.
This is the x86 version (32Bit).

Updates currently work fine and this also currently passes WGA. As a preventative measure, I've also
included Office and Windows WGA Cracks which are in a folder called "TJ" on the disc. You don't need
to use these unless you can't get updates, or this is no longer passing WGA.

I have removed the original Net Framework that ships with XP. It's super old and outdated.
You can still use it however. Just download the latest version from Microsoft.com or Windows Update.

I have disabled and deleted the Classic Windows XP Install Screens with the info about XP and the blue Background.
You will just see a black background now and the install will look similar to 2000. This saves Space and gives more
info while installing.

The Minimum HD and RAM Requirements have been lifted. You can try and install this on whatever machine you like now.
High ISO Compression has been enabled to save space.

Patches:
TCP/IP Half-Open Connections = 1000 (Default 10)
UXTheme Patch (Allows Unsigned Themes to be applied to XP)
Windows System File Checker Disabled (SFC)

Install Notes:
1. Burn the ISO using a program such as IMGBurn, Nero, Alcohol 120, Blindwrite, ect... (Burn at a slow Speed to ensure no errors, 1x-4x)
2. Change Bios Priority settings so it boots from the CD-ROM Drive First. (You may be able to skip this step)
3. Insert Disc and Reboot PC, Follow the on screen prompts and enjoy.

Notes:
If you are getting errors while copying files. It's your CD, not the release. Try burning it to different brand of cd/media and try burning at the slowest speed possible.
I just tested this in VMWare and it works flawless. You should get between 16-19 Processes and under 100mb of ram usage when using the computer initially. Everything you install/use will obviously increase this, however its the leanest XP Copy around.

*TidBits*
People are always like, "IE Sucks, Take it out." I would if I could, but removing IE can cause a lot of problems with other applications. Its better left in and just not used. Same goes for Outlook Express. This also contains NO drivers. Don't ask why you have low resolution, go install your graphics drivers. Don't ask why your wireless or network card won't work, go install its drivers.
