,GhostGMX,2009-11-25T01:41Z,"Hi, I need some help. All of my torrents from EZTV will not d/l.

I get ""Connection Error(No data received from tracker)""

Any help?"
,AylaMM,2009-11-25T03:16Z,"Have you updated your trackers? 'Cause this one says just 
""http://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

udp://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce""

So try adding:

http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

udp://tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce

(right click and press Properties and paste these)

I don't really understand how those things work, but I'm assuming that the trackers for The Pirate Bay & BitTorrent contribute in some way so maybe they'll help. :)"
,rdsgws,2009-11-25T14:49Z,funny show but man thats some anoying fake laughter!
,shacky003,2009-11-28T04:34Z,"AylaMM - Please stop telling people to add *piratebay.org* trackers, as they have been turned off permanently. It's idiotic to post info about something that you share you know nothing about anyways within said post.. Please do a little checking before you post crap. It's just going to slow people down when they get invalid tracker msg's.."
,cmpwiz,2009-11-30T00:21Z,thanks again ez
,yoriver,2009-12-01T14:32Z,Thank you!!!

Well I apologise then, I've thought that they've sped up my downloads but I guess I just perceived it that way.
There are lots of other trackers though that I usually add to my torrents, I don't really know how to check that stuff up but I haven't as of yet gotten any invalid tracker messages..."
,TedLilly,2009-12-07T23:22Z,thanks for the up
