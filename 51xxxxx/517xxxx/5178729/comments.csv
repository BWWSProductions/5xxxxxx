Actually, its because of the overload in the servers and general site glitches. If you check out the TPB Blog, you should know that by now. And besides, dude, why so hostile? All I did was upload a retail copy of Windows 7 that people have been asking for a lot. Nobody has fully downloaded this torrent yet because I just now uploaded it and you're already judging it. Why don't you try downloading it first."
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-25T04:25Z,"Gladly.
As of right now, there are 2 seeders: myself and somebody who downloaded this torrent fully. BUT there are also 110 leechers, thus causing the download to move slower. You have more people downloading this torrent than seeding it.

Now that was just pointing out the obvious. Come on, man. For somebody who has been on TPB as long as you have should know about that. And I'm doing the absolute best I can to seed and that's why I'm asking everybody else to seed as well, so this download can move quicker. 

Its just like I said before, A LOT of people want this OS, therefore A LOT of people will be downloading it..."
,jkglen,2009-11-25T04:46Z,TopCat has to get over himself me thinx.
,Perrin162,2009-11-25T07:50Z,"lol.  If you are in a hurry for it, go buy it. If you don't meet the necessary obligation, you don't deserve the reward.  In this case, its either $179.99 plus shipping, or a few days wait.  That's life. You get what you pay for, and free is a hell of a value, regardless of time spent waiting.  I will be seeding once this is done on my machine, as well as commenting again to verify working status.

Thanks xCoDeRx and I apologize for the ungrateful little cunts who cant see that you have done your part, the rest is up to the community."
,win7look,2009-11-25T13:30Z,Could anybody please post the SHA1 of these iso files? Thank you.
,floppysac,2009-11-25T13:53Z,o am currently getting this at about 560kbs this is appallingly slow as i am used to newsgroups at 12mbs on my connection but hey torrent sites still have there place seeing as no newsgroup i know will risk the wrath of m1cr0s0ft by allowing this on their sites. anyway there appears to be a massive diferance between seeding and leeching on this one so once i have changed my setting on bitlord to allow full upload spped for you guys and will seeding for next 48hrs so take advantage of an additional 2.8mbs upload. i hope the program still runs as sweet as some of these comments are saying.
,darkenergy,2009-11-25T15:07Z,"Thanks xCoDeRx,looking forward to using this.
Topcat is just one of those ignorant arrogant tossers.Take no notice,DARKENERGY"
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-25T17:16Z,"Hey its no problem guys! Just trying to help out my fellow peers! :)

As for topcat, it seems that his comments have been removed, so disregard the first two comments.

Also to answer some questions, this Windows 7 disk is in English and Russian only. I apologize for any inconvenience.

Thanks for the support, everyone! Ill be sure to upload more stuff soon! Maybe some Adobe CS4 Programs for your new operating system ;)"
,Cigma,2009-11-25T20:47Z,Thanks alot Coder! Will comment back on workign status and try to seed.

,estrada24,2009-11-26T05:15Z,"hey ireally need this, does it work. i want to upgrade from windows vista basic with a 32bit is this it?"
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-26T06:27Z,"I'm back.
Yes this torrent does work. I even tried it myself before I uploaded it to TPB to make sure people wouldn't be having problems.

And everyone, I'm doing the best I can to seed. I had to shut down my computer for about 8 hours (im traveling at the moment for thanksgiving holiday) so I have to get off momentarily every now and then. So if I'm not seeding, its up to everybody else to. 

Thanks everybody, its much appreciated!"
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-26T06:30Z,"and btw, topcat, please chill out. its JUST a torrent, not real life. 

chill"
,estrada24,2009-11-26T06:39Z,is this really legit?
,conrad442,2009-11-26T07:15Z,yup its legit! i just installed it with no probs and the activation worked too! love the new os.. thanks coder!!
,Georgian4Life,2009-11-26T07:32Z,topcat31285 you are a fucking ignorant little bitch. you claim this torrent to be fake? or possibly a virus?? oh yeah im sure he uploaded a fucking 3.75gb virus. wow dude how ignorant that you assume shit. xCoDeRx is actually doing an awesome deal for us and hes right you need to chill da fuck out. the pirate bay sucks now because of assholes like you fucking prick. anyway thanks for the upload man really helped.
,estrada24,2009-11-26T08:04Z,can some one tell me how to do this an easier way am really not that good with installations and stuff i wanna up grade to windows 7!!!!
,billy1989,2009-11-26T11:01Z,"ok but coder it looks like ur da only seeder, so wen are u able 2 seed the torrent again. yesterday wen i was downloadin, at 1 stage there was over 2000 leachers now there is only 1200, dat means a shit load of people removed this torrent cause they didnt want the wait. plz seed soon. thanks"
,FuckSholihin,2009-11-26T15:56Z,"bro, topcat31285 was just a masterpiece of ungrateful shithead that i think tpb should ban him/her. 

i bet his/her upload speed was just 0.000001 kBps!!"
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-26T16:13Z,"No, billy. The reason why people aren't seeding is because when they download an OS of any kind, they start to install it and it removes their programs, as well as their torrents. Its not that they don't want to wait, but that they want the operating system they downloaded to be installed.

And I did the absolute best I could with the installation instructions. Remember, unRAR the files first. If you don't know how to do that, download WinAce and extract them."
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-26T17:00Z,"Going offline for now, everybody. Ill be back and seeding later tonight so just hang tight!"

,banja75,2009-11-26T22:47Z,"I'm stuck at 48%. It took me only half an hour to get there but now doesn't move at all.
I assume it's because there is only one seeder.
What should I do? get out of it or will it start downloading again?
Please advise."
,Phybot_3,2009-11-27T01:00Z,"We are ALL stuck at %48, because there's NO seeder, as he said above he's offline. I really wish he'd let a few of us complete before going offline, then at least some of us could keep this going. I was stuck at 30-something yesterday. Thanks xC, but could you please let at least a handful of us finish?"
,billy1989,2009-11-27T01:07Z,"@xC, dude im not a noob but thanks 4 da advice anyways, im in no rush 2 get this but i just dnt like unfinished torrents in my list. but as u said u will b seedin 2nite so it'll b fine thanks alot 4 this amazin torrent hope i can finish it soon tho.

@banja75 i would wait 4 this torrent cause its a really good 1.

@Phybot_3 Dude xC is travellin dats y he is offline so dats y he cant seed 2 just a few people."

,xCoDeRx,2009-11-27T05:04Z,"OK guys look: Its Thanksgiving, and as I said before, I am traveling, and its really hard, and even frustrating at times to even get a bar of connection. I don't know what else to do for you guys other than to do my best to seed my own torrent. I mean, at the times I CAN seed, I even leave my computer on overnight. So I'm doing my part by seeding a torrent that I worked hard to put together.

But don't worry, everyone, I'll be home soon. But when you all finish the download, its up to YOU guys to help me out. I know I'm not the only one who has this torrent at 100% because I'm watching you guys download as we speak. The REAL problem is that everybody else is not seeding, and when I get offline, they get stuck.

Anyway, sorry for any inconvenience."

by mushi"
,xCoDeRx,2009-11-28T06:48Z,"Alrighty to answer some questions:

I think you may be able to install SP1 for Windows 7 when it comes out. But then again, I can't predict the future. As far As I know, you probably WILL be able to because the activator gives you a Windows Genuine activation and not just some fake cover up.

Also, I'm sorry, once again, for going offline. I'm back and seeding for the rest of the night until about 10 AM tomorrow morning Pacific Standard Time. So that's 12 hours of seeding I will do from this point to the point I start traveling home.

Anyway, hope it helps, and I promise this torrent will be well worth the download!"

,chuckmamuck,2009-11-28T22:42Z,"people aint gonna seed are they, not immediately after download, they all want this so as soon as its dl'd they'll be ripping the files apart and installing the new os on they're system. if a new install is done then all the packed files will be gone when their new os restarts. if they upgrade and keep the files intact in their downloads folder then when theyre running on this new os they'll be able to start utorrent again and seed it. not many are going to leave it seeding for a few days before installing this new os either, as soon as its dl'd they'll rip the files apart, burn it to disk and then install it changing their pc totally, they wont be thinking about keeping the files intact and saved so they can seed afterwards, anyway we'll all be too busy installing new drivers and programs to even think about seeding. thats why people who have finished dl'ing are not seeding, what will you do when the downloads finished???

nice work fella, thats a good idea, didnt think of that, i can transfer the completed files to my laptop, start the torrent again and it should continue seeding after checking the files. ive never tried it but i cant see why it wont work, if you click on a torrent and you already have it in ya downloads folder it says it already exsists, do you want to add the trackers then carries on where you left off. i'll give it a try.

,chuckmamuck,2009-11-29T08:40Z,"everyones at the same point, theres only 1 seed so only 1 pc that has the complete files and 1700 pc's trying to leech those files, weve all got to the same point so its gonna be slow until a few pc's finish and seed the complete files. just stop the torrent and turn it back on a few hours later to catch back up, if most of us did that then a few would get it quicker to seed it. you might as well keep stopping it, i do and start it every 4 hours, takes about 2 mins to catch you all up again at 600kbs then drops down to 10kbs when ive caught up so i stop it and save electricity. best way cus ya all just uploading the files you already got but dl'ing very slow."
,chuckmamuck,2009-11-29T09:05Z,"basically theres 1700 of us leeching and weve all got exactly the same parts of the files obviously, theres only 1 seed and that seed has the parts of the files we all need so theres 1700 of us draining 1 seed so 1700 of us dl'ing exactly the same parts of the files the seeder is uploading at the same time which is gonna be slow. thats why if you stop the torrent and start it a few hours later its seriously fast cus ya all uploading the parts of the files you've already dl'd but theres hardly anyone dl'ing that needs those parts cus you've already got them, your all at the same point dl'ing at the same speed. stop the torrent and start it later, keep doing that, its less painful and cheaper, ive just caught up and im at 88% but my time elapsed is only 3hrs 41mins. alot of you are saying youve been at it for days non stop. were all gonna finish at the same time so just stop it and start again when someone says there at 98%, you'll catch up quickly and finish at the same time."

and yes, of course its fast for you, youve got 1600 people uploading the files just for you cus were all stuck at 89.5% were just uploading, i got to here at 500kbs but i guarantee you get beyond 89.5%, nobody has cus theres no seeds, you aint connected to any seeds if you look so you wont be able to get the last 360mb of the files that we're all waiting to be uploaded. if you do get them then let us know how but i guarantee you wont cus they aint available to this torrent yet, you'll have to wait like the rest of us. 7loaders easy, just click activate later when windows asks you for a serial key after install, run 7loader when windows boots, click install default version(thats the latest) wait a short while until it says windows is activated then check. type winver into ya windows start search box and you'll see you have a fully certified windows with no termination date. job done. you wont need 7loader until this torrent is sorted tho trust me, 89'5% you'll stop. unless you download the rtm which is good, its the final release to manufacturing, ive been using it for a few months, im just dl'ing this to see if its the build numbers any different."
,chuckmamuck,2009-11-30T08:19Z,"reactionz thinks hes all smart cus he's dl'ing at super speed and were all stuck. ive got a 20mb connection but its worthless at the minute on this torrent. i got to this point in just over 2hours, that was on saturday. you'll see when you get to 89.5%, the majic number, its not possible to go beyond it reactionz, theres no seeds to connect to and nobody has the last 360mb of files to upload,we've all got exactly the same parts of the files so we cant give each other anything, were all uploading for you to catch us up at super speed so you can join the stuck at 89.5% club. i cant believe you started downloaded it to be honest after reading the comments, it was fine and everyone was gaining when we all started dl'ing, if i saw it now i wouldnt download, i would wait to see if it sorts itself out cus its looking like it could be a dead torrent."

,chuckmamuck,2009-11-30T10:22Z,"ciao honeymonster. get the rtm then google the leaked uodates pack and install those, about 8 updates. thats what im using, its the same as the retail windows7 ultimate 64bit. the updates changed the build number from (7600.16385.win7_rtm.090713.1385) to (7600.16399.win7.gdr.090722.1835) so it went from rtm re;ease to manufacturing to gdr general distribution release with the leaked update pack that you can download anywhere, its allover the place. im only downloading this to put it on a spare pc to see if the build number of the retail version is any different to the rtm with the update pack. theres a few different updates you can get, another turns it to ldr limited distribution release. theres also others ive seen that make the build number 7600.20510. i just want to know what the official release is. defo get windows7 tho, its awesome and so much better than vista."

,chuckmamuck,2009-11-30T12:51Z,"too right mate, make sure you get activated yourself first. i wouldnt mind getting hold of a keygen, i had 1 for vista so there'll be 1 for this come out in time. the oem keys that were leaked in july/august time with the rtm are still working, ive used the same key everytime and ive put 7 ultimate on about 20ppl's pc's as well as my own. i thought microsoft would of blacklisted them,especially after 22nd october but they aint, theyre the same keys that most of the windows7 loaders and activators use as well, theres like 2 keys being constantly used for each edition of windows7. the 1 i use never lets me down. ive got these 2 that are supposed to work for win7 ultimate 32+64bit but never tried them, dont need to, just use the win7 loader 1.6.9 by daz, works like a charm.

,chuckmamuck,2009-11-30T19:05Z,"thesassaman. you can either download a small free program called pc wizard by cpuid. install it, click configurations then operating system and click on the 6.1.7600 build number and it gives u the full build info. or you can type regedit in the start search bar of windows, then click HKEY-LOCAL-MACHINE, software, microsoft, windows NT then click current version and it gives you all ya build numbers and info. its 1 of those windows programs that keeps opening drop down boxes to choose from, eg you click on software and it drops about 20 other boxes to choose from, just click each drop down box in that order and it'll take you straight to it mate. dl pc wizard tho cus its a good little pc info tool, it tells you everything, like everest but free."
,chuckmamuck,2009-11-30T19:19Z,"thesassaman. i dont really know about lgr and gdr, lgr is limited general release or something and gdr is general distribution release, i thought gdr sounds better than limited but theyre both a step up from rtm by the looks of it. i know the updates to change the rtm builds were leaked, i dont know if ms are going to add them to windows update or not, thought they would of done by now tho. the main update that changed my build number was kb675605, that changed it to the gdr from rtm, my build is now 7600.16399.win7_gdr.090722-1835... it was the rtm 7600.16385.win7_rtm.090713-1255.. after installing the 8 updates it seems alot quicker and i get updates from windows like every other day now, even internet exploder is pretty fast cus ms updated that last month. theres alot of talk about 7600.20510 build, google it and you'll see alot of torrents, i dont know if thats the retail build now, thats why im dl'ing this to find out. hope that helps."

-thanks for the help. i've had cpuid before, played around with it a little. i think it was to see if i could overclock my cpu, but it's a dell machine, so the mobo says no no. think i forgot about it after that.

i have 16385, but when i installed it on this new hdd, it installed x64 professional, when i'm pretty sure i click x86 ultimate... and then it wouldn't let me install ultimate. so i'm downloading this, maybe it'll help me get x86 ultimate and perhaps the newer build. if not, i'll just download the updates. thanks for that too."

,chuckmamuck,2009-12-01T23:46Z,"you make me laff topcat, funny as fuck. yeah coder was commenting and being helpful telling people when he would be online and answering questions but as soon as it went tits up he dissappeared and aint been heard from since. he uploaded it so he's got the complete files, he could of set up another tracker and seeded it himself, theres only 400mb left so it wouldnt of took that long then at least others would have the complete files to seed it for others and keep the cycle going but it looks like he's just fucked it off leaving everyone hanging on to it. piss take really, if you upload a torrent and people are downloading it then at least seed the fucking thing so they can can get it, whats the point otherwise. ya dont let them get 3.38gb of 3.75gb then pull the plug, unless your a cunt and get a kick out of that shit. "
,bondiblueos9,2009-12-02T01:06Z,It's a pity its all in a rar file.  Otherwise someone might be able to get the same files themselves elsewhere and seed them via this torrent.
,chuckmamuck,2009-12-02T02:14Z,"it would be difficult mate, torrents are split into small files, this 1 has 960x4mb files, each 4mb file has 256 blocks to it from what i can tell, we leech these small files of 4mb and when ones complete we upload it then and constantly share the small parts weve got. weve all got 860 of the 960 4mb files but the problem is they aint in any order, the last file i was in the middle of was 380 something yet 89.5% was complete so the parts of the files are just random. basically you have to wait until completion to get the jigsaw finished. trying to work out what we needed would be bloody hard work, i wouldnt fancy doing it, my brain couldnt work it out anyway. i agree tho, damn shame."

,chuckmamuck,2009-12-04T04:33Z,"hey everyone, download the AIO that partija uploaded on here a couple of days ago, its perfect and final release not an evaluation copy or anything. its called windows 7, thats it, just type that in the search bar and you'll find it. 140 of us were leeching it and most of us have just finished so its got over 80 seeds and only 45 leechers, its seriously fast now. you'll have to download an activator but all the best ones are on here anyway. it took 2 days to download with only partija seeding it but when people started to finish and seed near the end it was well fast so you'll get it in half a day at the most.
its the same as this version except it fucking finishes ya download and it works. get it quick while theres not many leechers and twice as many seeds. type partija and you'll find it easier that way i bet, i think cus he's called the torrent just ""windows 7"" people aint bothered checking it out cus it dont explain what it is so theres not been many people leeching it, its defo the 1 to get and what ive been waiting for, its the real thing, like this torrent should of been."

that torrent you linked was looking good but for some reason all the seeds and leachers have gone now, its now 4seeds 4 leachers which is strange cus it had 80 seeds 46 leechers this morning. fuck knows whats happened to it, a torrent dont lose its seeds and leechers in the space of a few hours, not when its a healthy fast torrent. probably bad trackers again, torrents used to be easy hassle free stable downloads but lately they're allover the place and trackers are shit, you cant even connect to them alot of the time."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-04T20:11Z,"hello chuckmamuck

yeah those magnets links are confusing at times, youre right tho cus its only been happening recently since the magnets appeared. i dont fully understand how they work so i'll have to do a bit of googling, magnet links for dummies.

read back thru the comments man, you obviously aint done cus if you had you wouldnt be downloading this torrent.
basically its fucked. it was ok for 4days then it died at 84.5%, its been like that for over a week. weve all deleted it and moved on.
always look back thru the comments to look for alot of people having the same problems cus that shows there is a problem with the torrent and also check the quality rating, this is -17 which says it all, the +15 people that gave it a good rating were ones that rated it before it finished cus the dl speed was stupidly fast. its DEAD...r.i.p."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-07T00:01Z,"ha ha ha the current 813 leechers are completely noobish, i bet they're just hit and run species!


this is what happen when the uploader gave up in seeding. xCoDeRx listen, you can use `initial seeding' to ease your pain to make the leechers more stable in flat percentage!`initial seeding' will avoid you seeding the same byte of data twice so the completed data will occur faster. i understand your situation because i am running poor dial-up connection too."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-07T00:09Z,usually in utorrent client they call it `initial seeding' but i dont know if you running other torrent client. initial seeding is very useful for seeding huge upload i.e. 1gib-100gib

racism aint attractive at all, its just pure ignorance. racism fuelled by hatred is the sickness, an EVIL disease, its worse than having AIDS and cancer. there'll be no place for race hate when the revolution comes. western governments promote racism and hatred, its propoganda for getting support to invade the planet, thats why all we hear in the media is evil muslim, muslim terrorists, evil terrorists. worse thing is ignorant narrow minded sheeple fall for it and link all muslims to evil murdering terrorists, its called media mind control and its powerful. most of the terrorist groups we hear about are set up and funded by the CIA, the main 1 being al quaeda, bin laden is a CIA assett, why the fuck do you think they aint found him. dont believe the mainstream media, its controlled and censored, research the real truth, its not hard to find when you start looking. people have become drones thru mind control, turn ya fucking tv's off and deprogram yourselves from all the bullshit theyve filled ya heads with."

the link fuckshohilin added about 911 conspiricies is what i was talking about with how they promote racism and hate, western controllers attack their own people and blame it on another country, race or on an organization(that the CIA created) from another country, they then use the controlled mainstream media to tell us how evil this race is on a daily basis whipping the people up into a frenzy of hatred until they're all chanting bomb the bastards, which they then do but not cus of that, they had already planned on the bombing long before the attack even happened. the war continues until objectives are complete, the CIA continues to recruit and train the enemy to fight to keep the war going while permanent bases are constructed strategically placed within reach of russia, china, pakistan and iran (who will be next) followed by pakistan. get control of the oil, push the price up to gain funds for the iran mission and bring in an iraqi government that answers to the UN, keep delaying the government being active with CIA sponsored  terrorist bombings to slow it down and give an excuse for the ongoing war until objectives are complete. final goal is wipe out islam to pave the way for the NEW WORLD ORDER, one world government. and the sheeple will support it cus they're all in fear of terrorism and global warming and will agree to anything thru total fear(makes us rely totally on the government) . terrorism in its present form doesnt exsist, its being constantly created and developed to achieve goals and keep us in fear and relying on the governments control.. global warming is bullshit, do ya research and you'll find that the planet is in a natural warming cycle. wake up people, join the revolution before insane elitists with fucked up ideas control our planet and us. research the truth, its not hard to find. you just wont find it on the BBC, CNN, FOX etc etc.
