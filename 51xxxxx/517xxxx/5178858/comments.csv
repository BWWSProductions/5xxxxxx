I confirm it is just as pffut said (thanks pffut).

Inside the rar is a self-extracting exe.

Out of curiosity I ran the exe file inside Sandboxie.

The exe file contains several files (including the pdf book), at least one of which is a confirmed Trojan.
The file name is datafile18.exe and is meant to hide inside folder
...\user\current\Local Settings\Temp\nsvC.tmp

The pdf file is the right one (203MB for 266 pages!).
It is for ABSOLUTE beginners and tells you nothing more than the very basics.  So it's just not worth the risk.
