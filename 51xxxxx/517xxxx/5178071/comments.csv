After that the books were all bullshit FICTION. Not the good ""nonfiction labeled as fiction for legal reasons"" stuff, but the FICTION as in pure bullshit writing another book to make a buck"" type."

,Amaximus,2009-11-25T04:31Z,Marcinko served time in federal prison under charges of defrauding the government over the price of contractor acquisitions for hand grenades. Marcinko maintains that he was the subject of a witch-hunt for his work with Red Cell and that the fraud committed revealed the weaknesses of military security. Marcinko has detailed his arrest and confinement in the last chapters of his autobiography.

,Spartan_300,2009-11-25T07:22Z,"Thanks for the upload,... "
[T],Knaster,2009-11-25T13:31Z,Man this game sure is boring. I had sadly high hopes for this one
,praxus,2009-11-25T16:58Z,let's hope this is better than modern warfare 2 ....
,suisenbenjo,2009-11-25T18:42Z,Thanks for the UL but this game fucking blows. What a disappointment.
,limited305,2009-11-25T20:47Z,"@praxus

Whats up with these douchebags not liking MW2? Do they not know a quality game when they play one? You're gonna be very dissapointed in the future bro."
,CypressKill,2009-11-25T21:07Z,"praxus, there is nothin better than modern warfare II....."
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-11-25T21:19Z,"DUDE, THIS GAME SUCKS
Horrible half-assed 2005 graphics
Shitty framerate even on the lowest settings (9500GT, 2,53C2D, 4GB)
Aiming feels horrible
What fuckwit decided to map the grenade throw to right mouse, and ADS to spacebar???
No recoil on guns
Taking cover doesn't feels smooth, probably because of the framerate

No word yet on history, still on the second missions, but I doubt I'll even reach the 4th with this sucky gameplay
"
,ryan112,2009-11-26T12:14Z,"i agree with hurt master 88... mw2 SHOULD have been DLC for cod4, and a whole new story for mw2... but any ways the game work but sucks badly. "
,Lidera,2009-11-26T12:54Z,"It works perfectly, so thanks to the uploader, or reloaded or both whatever. 
On the other hand tho, its sad to see such a bad shooter. Halfassed graphics, kinda wierd controls and the guy cursing at everything just seems forced... sorry bout i thought this game was just awfull"
,tibrusjer,2009-11-26T15:21Z,"please post a crack only.
Thanks"
,johnniebrasco,2009-11-27T04:11Z,"have tried it on both vista64 and win7-64, but both of them came out really choppy, can't figure out why. anyone else having the same problem?"
,kaleeef,2009-11-27T12:05Z,"cool game, thanks!"
,johnniebrasco,2009-11-27T19:08Z,"After disabling all the hid-devices, i got it running normal, I remembered I had to do the same with prototype. Don't know why though. Let's hope it isn't as bad as people say."
,falle2,2009-11-27T23:04Z,"Why is it lacking? i swear it is not me hardware! Runs COD MW2 on x-high 1920x1200 no prob, but this game is just fucked! Is it the crack?"
,TempDude29,2009-11-28T07:29Z,"I got it to work, but the game itself is a major disappointment."
,Gief_Me,2009-11-28T20:02Z,This game is a major disappointment they did not take advanish of to day's graphic and effects. This game is a total FPS Failur.
,Atteros,2009-11-28T23:10Z,"djsigmaphi u cant compare games with any of the call of duty games...
they all OWN!^^"
,limited305,2009-11-28T23:43Z,"Lol 'HurtMaster'..
""And yes, the SP of MW2 was totally unimpressive and basically sucked bad. it just felt like extra levels added on to MW1.""

You can do that with ANY sequel to a game, its not fair. ""Oh L4d 2 just felt like extra levels for l4d, or assassin's creed 2 is extra levels for ac1""
That's total bullshit."
,praxus,2009-11-29T02:19Z,nice release of a bad game
,zalmancooled,2009-11-29T07:41Z,skips like a heard of fruitcakes every 10-20 seconds on win 7 64 must be related to HID utilizing a 360 controller
,zalmancooled,2009-11-29T08:48Z,NVM Problem Fixed by disabling unused HID devices and actually changed out to a ps2 keyboard skipping is gone now so dl is great game is working fine it was a user ID.10-T error :)
,munkman,2009-11-29T16:34Z,"You guys should probably read a review before playing this game because it sucks sweaty balls. Save yourself some time and don't download. OH, thanks for the up AiTB-- perfect as always."
,idrone42,2009-12-01T05:05Z,"this game was made by a $5 whore, for the sum of $5. "
,W411Y,2009-12-03T03:56Z,"Great upload, but what a terrible game. You basically, can just run around pressing E at any enemy you find, pulling a kill move, you can sprint far, and VERY fast, making the game pretty boring when you have the choice between using guns, and not using guns. "
,urbantts,2009-12-05T02:34Z,"DO NOT BY ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DOWNLOAD THIS GAME, IT SUCKS!"
,ellloo,2009-12-06T15:05Z,"to be honest... this game is horrible less than 6 hours of game play, i used all of 2 different guns out of a selection of about 6.  VERY easy to beat even on the hardest difficultly    just plain bad"
,chiwo,2009-12-06T19:58Z,Don't waste your bandwith downloading .The maker of this game should feel shame when compare to COD MW2. Thanks the uploader anyway
,Saabatron,2009-12-06T20:14Z,"i dont see why all you guys say this game is ""the worst ever, i hated it, etc etc...""   it's fun to rush through. it's not a game that takes strategy or anything like that, but to be honest with you i had so much fun just sprinting up to people and executing them :D   haha but still...  can anyone explain how they stopped the lagging for some people cause i still don understand lol"
,tru_fr33d0m,2009-12-08T06:39Z,"hey i downloaded a version of this game, but it didnt come with crack, can anyone post just a crack only? thnx"
,djrm,2009-12-11T14:59Z,i mounted and played the game easy.at the first time
,stackerman,2009-12-14T23:03Z,it came with crack but it crashes after 3min.
,w33n,2009-12-30T03:22Z,"""Hnurr, this game isn't made by IW, and it's not even realistical. Lets flame it guys""

Really.
Fuck off, it's a great game.
Sure it skips like a goddamn junkie wired up on meth, but after you disable the HID, it runs smoothly.
It's meant to be an arcade shooter, not ""AN EPIC TALE OF WAR AND HEROISM. NOW WITH ADDED STRAWBERRY JAM"", I'm looking at you, MW2."
,infamymw2,2010-04-05T19:27Z,the game sucks. not even worth downloading it.
