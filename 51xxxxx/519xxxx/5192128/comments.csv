That would be nice. "
,countryboy78,2009-12-03T02:11Z,"Secretmyth thanks for all your great work!  Your BRIP's are great in quality.

Now that mininova (where you use to post) is pretty much gone, do you plan on posting messages here at piratebay and do you also plan on posting on other sites as well?

As the previous poster mentioned a BRIP of Pandorum would be great and could you do a BRIP of All About Steve and A Perfect Getaway?

Thanks!"
