A compilation containing all the awesome performances by Mariette Hansson in the Swedish Idol 2009. The first track is her first audition, track 2-3 is from the qualifiers, and track 4-14 she performed in the friday finals. Unfortunately she had to leave the competition last week as number #4, but we will see more from this rising star soon!

For this compilation i have used the highest quality sources available. No crappy YT-rips here! I have also done some editing to the tracks to make them fit together as an album. This includes normalizing, which i did because the dB level in the source files varied vastly. I also added fade-outs followed by 2-2.5 seconds of silence at the end of each track.


Feel free to leave a comment if you find any problems with any of the songs. I finished this up at 3 AM last night so you never know. Or if you just want to discuss Mariette's awesomeness. :)
