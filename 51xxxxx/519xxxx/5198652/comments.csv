,Temptation,2009-12-06T18:24Z,"Well first, Paula Todd did not ""leave"" the show.  She was made to leave when TVO ended the show she and STeve Paikin used to host together, Studio 2, and decided to go with Steve Paikin alone and revamp that show into what became The Agenda.

While it was kind of harsh the way they dumped her unceremoniously, and I feel a bit bad for her, I really couldn't stand Paula Todd.  She was incredibly annoying, with her ""I feel your pain"" facial expressions and faux-empathy shtick.  I don't miss her at all.

I think the show improved drastically from its previous Studio 2 format to the new The Agenda incarnation.  Studio 2 was hampered by having the same idiotic Canadian pundits pontificating on every issue, and once you knew their point of view and ideological bias, their opinions lacked any novelty.  They just kept repeating the same thing and again.  With the new show, The Agenda, the producers have done an amazing job of finding lots of different guests - many of them with high international profiles - to debate the various topics, and it makes for a much more informative and livelier show.  

I have my own problems with this show, which is that like most Western mainstream media that pretends to be ideologically neutral, the host and its producers are already starting with all sorts of biases. There is of course no such thing as a completely ideologically neutral media.  People become indoctrinated, consciously and unconsciously, by the unquestioned premises of the society they grow up on, and they accept the interpretation of history and current events that are fed to them, which is almost always favourable to their society and their country.  So in this case, there is a deeply racist bias towards Middle-East issues that all Western media suffer from, and a unquestioned pro-American, pro-Israeli bias.  So for example, whenever they talk about American foreign policy, it's always under the assumption that American foreign policy means well.  For who, one should ask?  Maybe for smug, white Westerners in Europe, the US and Canada, but American foreign policy certainly has not meant well for the millions of dead brown people that American has slaughtered, bombed, tortured, directly and indirectly, from Latin America, to Indo-China, to the Middle-East today.

Still, within the contrained and deeply baised parameters that this show suffers from, I think it does a fairly good job, and sometimes, despite its best attempt to stack the panel in favour of one side, as they tried to do in this show about Israel's barbaric behaviour in Gaza, the side they're trying to heavily favour still comes out looking bad, as the pro-Israeli side here came out looking.

In any case, whatever my problems with this show are, they have nothing to do with Paula Todd.  I'm glad she's no longer part of this show.  I couldn't stand her.  And putting aside my personal dislike for Paula Todd and her fakery, I don't think its even debatable that the show under this new incarnation is vastly superior to the old Studio 2 incarnation."
