"I Ain't No Quitter" is a song by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was the third and final single released from her 2004 Greatest Hits album. The song was written by Twain and then-husband, Robert John "Mutt" Lange. "I Ain't No Quitter" was originally released to country radio on May 2, 2005. Fans were shocked when the heavy country song was released to MuchMoreMusic, one of Canada's pop music video channels and to European radio. The song was a flop in Europe and did not chart, but stayed at number one for several weeks on MuchMoreMusic's daily fan-voted countdown MMMTop10.com. The commercial singles in Europe were released on July 12, 2005. Due to no promotion by Twain and very little by the label, "I Ain't No Quitter" became one of Shania's lowest peaking singles.

The music video for "I Ain't No Quitter" was shot in Tijuana, Mexico in March of 2005. It was released on May 5, 2005, it was directed by Wayne Isham. The video is set in a country bar, where there is a line dancing competition going on, the dancers throw in a bit of hip-hop influenced dancing. To keep with the country theme of the song and video, Shania wears a cowboy hat in every scene. The video is available on select CD singles of "I Ain't No Quitter".

"I Ain't No Quitter" debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart the week of May 21, 2005 at number 55. The single spent eight weeks on the chart and climbed to a peak position of number 45 on July 2, 2005, where it remained for one week. "I Ain't No Quitter" became Twain's lowest peaking single since "God Bless the Child", which peaked at number 48 in 1997.
