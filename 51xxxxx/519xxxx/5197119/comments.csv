The 128k VBR's actually average about around 112k - but they peak at 128k 
when needed, hence the ""variable"". During the quiet moments it drops when 
not needed, hence the saving in file size. You are getting a slight drop 
in quality from the re-encode, but (if I may gloat a bit) you are starting 
with a pretty good source so it won't be too noticable. I've had people tell 
me that 128k is too high, and it probably is a bit. I could get by with 112k 
max, but I figure the vbr works it out in the end. I definitely noticed a 
difference with only 96k max though. 

If I were you I'd try cbr encodes at 96k, 112k and compare it to your 128k's. 
You might find that it solves your vbr issues and saves you some file size too. "
