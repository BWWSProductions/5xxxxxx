Along with the Tidy Events Team they are responsible for the Tidy Weekenders, Summer Camps,Magna events and one off events at various clubs in the UK including SeOne and The Coronet in London, Air in Birmingham and the Carling Academy in Scotland

Their production and remix work has spanned the last 10 years under various guises, such as Hyperlogic, Untidy Dubs, Tidy Boys and many more. The weekend sees the boys hitting clubs both in the U.K and oversees as they join their a-list friends behind the decks.

The Tidy Boys style now emphasises the full range of the new regenerated hard-edged sound, a concoction of hard funk, hard house and hard trance. Working as a DJ team they throw everything theyâ€™ve got into a dynamic performance, which brings their set into what can be described as the ultimate set for the harder generation. Their set is a mixture of hard UK and European house, which is interacted with Tidy favorites old and new.

Here they hit the decks Live At Tidy Weekender 9.
