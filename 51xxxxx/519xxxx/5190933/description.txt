The Christmas special is a traditional part of the American TV series. It's usually taken as an opportunity to the makers to add a little depth or drama to even the lightest of sit-coms. And it's their chance to gain extra profile in the key viewing season. 
Most shows only get their Christmas special in the second season and usually they come around only now and then. The exception would be domestic sitcoms - such as Home Improvement or Everybody Loves Raymond - where the Christmas episode is part of the decor of the show.
The other entertaining side of seeing shows in a format like this, is watching the history of a show's run and seeing how the characters changed and storylines evolved (or not, as the case may be). Like dipping into a familiar place to sample and see whether you like what the show has to offer.
Here's the list fo shows featured (including the odd New Year's Eve special thrown in for good measure). The episodes were taken from all over the net, so thanks to all the cappers. The quality is mixed, but usually good. The idea is to let others build on this if there's interest.
