Part 2 of this ambitious project filmed over 3 years, began as an award-winning documentary broadcast on June 24, 2006 to the highest ratings in the nation that night. So overwhelming was the response, producer John Kastner continued to follow Martin Ferrier from prison through his return to the streets. Having spent 15 of the last 17 years in prison, Ferrier is barely able to function in the community. He struggles painfully to transform himself into a law-abiding citizen, desperate to overcome enormous odds and disprove the terrifying predictions by authorities and his mother that he will eventually break down and go on a violent rampage. Ferrier also makes a poignant pilgrimage to his hometown in northern Ontario to settle scores with his mother over her devastating media campaign against him.
