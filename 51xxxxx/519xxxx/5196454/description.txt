    Quay extends the Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or 10.6 (Snow Leopard)       
    Dock to show extended popup menus for most Dock items, including      
    applications, stacks and URLs. Quay also allows you to make folder    
    proxy icons with easily customized icons.                             
                                                                          
    So why should you use Quay at all? Extra information, more            
    flexibility. For one, the Dock's popups are limited to about 500      
    items; Quay's limit is in the tens of thousands. You can have a       
    Quay popup on both sides of the Dock; Apple has them only on the      
    document side. The Dock doesn't follow aliases/symbolic links in      
    its menus; Quay does. It works for Smart Folders, also shows          
    application versions and (for running applications) CPU and memory    
    statistics. Still, if for some reason you want the Dock's normal      
    display, just hold the Option key down before clicking.               
                                                                          
    Quay is a simple-to-use Cocoa application. You can run it just to     
    configure a popup item in the Dock, but it works automatically        
    with your existing stacks; the actual popup is handled by a           
    background process that uses few system resources. The Dock icons     
    can be customized for better recognition (and put on both sides of    
    the Dock).                                                            
                                                                          
    Quay does no magic. It doesn't hack the Dock in any way, and calls    
    no private system interfaces.
