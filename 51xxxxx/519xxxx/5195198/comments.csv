,ljastangs21,2009-12-04T05:03Z,"Hi,

Im actually very sorry about that. Im new to torrenting and im trying to figure out to seed what i post. Can you please help me out? Do i need to download uTorrent or something? Im really sorry! If you can post in this thread and help me out http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=54540"
,KwizatsHaderach,2009-12-05T01:05Z,Thanks for the upload but has anyone actually finished downloading this file? I can't even get 1.0kB/s. I will of course seed at least 2x if I ever get the whole file.
