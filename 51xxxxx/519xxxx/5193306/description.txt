From Wiki:



Slayer is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Park, California, formed in 1981. The band was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King.[1] Slayer rose to fame with their 1986 release, Reign in Blood, which has been called "the heaviest album of all time" by Kerrang!.[2] The band is credited as one of the "Big Four" of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Anthrax and Megadeth.[3]

Slayer's musical traits involve fast tremolo picking, atonal guitar solos, double bass drumming, and shouting vocals. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, Satanism, religion and warfare have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public.

Since their debut record in 1983, the band has released two live albums, one box set, four videos, two extended plays, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received three Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "Eyes of the Insane", and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six". They have headlined music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. 







Show No Mercy 1983


Show No Mercy is the debut album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released in December 1983 through Metal Blade Records. Brian Slagel signed the band to Metal Blade after watching the band perform the song "Phantom of the Opera" by Iron Maiden. The band was forced to self-finance their debut album, combining the savings of vocalist Tom Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King's father.

Touring extensively promoting the album, the band brought close friends and family members along the trip, who helped backstage with lighting and sound. Although criticized for poor production quality, it became Metal Blade Records highest selling release, also producing the songs "Die by the Sword", "The Antichrist" and "Black Magic", which are played at Slayer's live shows regularly.

Hell Awaits 1985


Hell Awaits is the second studio album by the American thrash metal band Slayer, released through Metal Blade Records in 1985. The band's previous release, Show No Mercy, became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release; as a result, producer Brian Slagel desired to release a second Slayer album. To that end, Slagel financed a recording budget (Show No Mercy was paid for by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.

Lyrical themes on Hell Awaits are darker than on Show No Mercy, and included hell and Satan.[2] Musically, the album features the band's most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases. Defined as "influential to future extreme metal acts," the most popular songs from Hell Awaits were re-recorded by various underground metal bands and have appeared on several tribute albums.[3] Musicians such as singer Phil Anselmo and drummer Gene Hoglan cite Hell Awaits as an influence.

1.	"Hell Awaits"  
2.	"Kill Again"

Reign in Blood 1986


Reign in Blood is the third studio album and major label debut by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on October 7, 1986, the album was the band's first collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band's sound evolve. Reign in Blood was very well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. Kerrang! magazine described the record as "the heaviest album of all time," and a breakthrough in thrash metal and speed metal.

Reign in Blood's release was delayed because of concerns regarding its graphic artwork and lyrical subject matter. The opening track, "Angel of Death", which refers to Josef Mengele and describes acts, such as human experimentation, that Mengele committed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, provoked allegations of Nazism.[6] However, the band stated numerous times they do not condone Nazism, and are merely interested in the subject.[7] The album was Slayer's first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number 94, and was awarded gold certification on November 20, 1992.

Tracks:

1.	"Angel of Death"  
2.	"Piece by Piece"

6.	"Criminally Insane"

10.	"Raining Blood"  








South of Heaven  1988


South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on July 5, 1988, the album was the band's second collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on Slayer's previous album Reign in Blood had helped the band's sound evolve.

South of Heaven was Slayer's second album to enter the Billboard 200, and its last to be released by Def Jam Recordings, although the album became an American Recordings album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of original distributor Columbia Records's refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. In order to offset the pace of the group's previous album, Slayer deliberately slowed down the album's tempo. In contrast to their previous albums, the band utilised undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised this musical change, othersâ€”more accustomed to the style of earlier releasesâ€”were disappointed. Despite this, the songs "Mandatory Suicide" and the title track became permanent features of the band's live setlist.

Tracks: 

1.	"South of Heaven"  
2.	"Silent Scream"  
3.	"Live Undead"  
4.	"Behind the Crooked Cross"

7.	"Read Between the Lies"

Seasons in the Abyss is one of few albums to be issued with a Parental Advisory label despite the virtual absence of profanity unlike other Slayer albums, though the lyrics depict violent acts.

Although receiving mixed critical reviews, the album sold 46,000 copies in its first week to peak at number 31 on the Billboard 200.

Guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote most of the album's content which has been described as Slayer's most experimental album.

God Hates Us All 2001


God Hates Us All is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on September 11, 2001, the album received mixed critical reviews, although it entered the Billboard 200 at number 28. Recorded in three months at The Warehouse Studio in Canada, God Hates Us All includes the Grammy Award-nominated "Disciple" and is the band's last album to feature drummer Paul Bostaph.

Guitarist Kerry King wrote approximately 80% of the lyrics, adopting a different approach from earlier recordings by including prevalent themes such as religion, murder, revenge, and self-control. Limiting the lyrics to topics which everyone could relate to, King wished to explore more in depth, realistic subject matter. The band experimented musically by recording two songs with seven-string guitars, and a further two with drop B tunings. The album's release was delayed due to the graphic nature of its artwork for which slip covers were created to cover the original artwork, difficulties encountered during audio mixing, and the change of distributor by the band's record label during the release period.

Tracks: 

1.	"Darkness of Christ"  
2.	"Disciple"

Christ Illusion 2006


Christ Illusion is the tenth studio album by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on August 8, 2006, the album received generally favorable critical reviews, and it entered the Billboard 200 at number 5â€”the band's highest U.S. chart position to date. Christ Illusion includes the Grammy Award-winning songs "Eyes of the Insane" and "Final Six", and is the band's first studio album to feature original drummer Dave Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss.

Depicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator Larry Carroll, the album's graphic artwork courted controversy. An alternative cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original. Lyrical themes, particularly in the song "Jihad" which describes the September 11 attacks from a terrorist perspective, outraged the Mumbai-based Catholic Secular Forum in India. As a result, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by EMI India.

World Painted Blood 2009


World Painted Blood is the eleventh studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released by American Recordings/Sony Music on November 3, 2009. The album was produced by Greg Fidelman and executive produced by Rick Rubin.

In May 2009, Kerry King said of the album: "I think this one has a little bit of everythingâ€”more so than anything we've done since Seasons. So I would imagine people are gonna compare it to that one."[12] The band had recorded thirteen songs for the album, seven written by Jeff Hanneman and six by King, although not all of them were included.[12] Kerry King later confirmed the album's release date was pushed back to late summer 2009.[13] A recent article on Slayer's website has confirmed the name of the band's 10th studio album is World Painted Blood.[14] World Painted Blood marks the first time Slayer wrote and prepared the material for the album while in the studio. In the past, most or all of the songs had been worked out by the time the band entered the studio to record the material. Dave Lombardo said in an interview on Capital Chaos "The other albums were good, but this one there's some kind of magic that I can't put my finger on, it just flows really well, the structuring is done well, the melodies are done well. Everything has been a collective effort so I'm definitely proud of it and I'm sure the other guys are too."[15] On August 20, 2009, Roadrunner Records confirmed the track listing[16] On September 15, 2009, the artwork for the album was revealed. It will be released with four different covers that when put together, create a world map covered in blood.

Slayer's debut album Show No Mercy became Metal Blade's highest selling, leading to producer Brian Slagel wanting to release an EP. Recorded in Hollywood the recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet, although it resulted in drummer Dave Lombardo meeting Gene Hoglan who was to become an influence in his drumming style and speed.[1]

Although originally featuring three songs, the record evidences a marked evolution from the style of their previous album, Show No Mercy, and is considered the first demonstration of the band's "classic" style displayed on later albums and a "stepping stone."[2] The songs "Captor of Sin" and "Chemical Warfare" are regularly featured on the band's live set list.
