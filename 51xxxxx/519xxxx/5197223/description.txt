A fan 'Best Of' from the original line-up, remixed and sequenced by Ghostchild, . All tracks 1981-1983

This was made for a friend who loved it so I thought I'd share. It has been carefully edited together and is a very fluid and honest representation of what made Duran great in the early 80's. Try it - you might like it and experience Duran in an entirely new way :o)

Sound quality is important to me as I hope it is to you - hence file size... I will seed 24/7 365 so you will get it sooner or later and if others seed then even better!! 

If I get good feedback I will seed two more albums that complete the trilogy :o)

ENJOY!
