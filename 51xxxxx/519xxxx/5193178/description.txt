These are the four books of the Blood Ties series by Jennifer Armintrout.The first two books are read by Elenna Stauffer, and the second two books are read by Lauren Fortgang. 

I have split each book up into their chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.

This is not the book series that the TV series Blood Ties is based off of. That series is called Victoria Nelson/Victory Nelson and it is by Tanya Huff.

Enjoy.
