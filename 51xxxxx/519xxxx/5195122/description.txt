                          How to Install Unsigned Apps                 
                                                                       


       Step 1: Make sure you have a file browser installed, it is running
       and nothing else. Do not use the built-in Symbian browser,
       but a program like X-Plore (free version works too).

       Step 2: Send HelloCarbide and installserver.exe to your phone
       (S60v3 Device). Do not open them yet.

       Step 3: Close any programs that may be running on your phone,
       except the file browser.

       Step 4: Install and Run HelloCarbide.sis. Now go to options,
       then to menu1. Keep Pressing the selection key untill it crashes.
       This is normal. You will have access to the system/private folders.

       Step 5: Use the file manager to copy installserver.exe into the
       c:sysbin folder of your phone. This allows you to install
       unsigned apps.

       Now Simply send the Unsigned Releases from ErESPDA to your phone
       and install without any complications. ^_^
