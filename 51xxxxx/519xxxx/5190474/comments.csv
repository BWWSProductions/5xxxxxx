,Ri6e5t,2009-12-26T18:54Z,What?! I am sure it works... Comment me on what happens and please try or ask if you don't know something
,fiddlefart,2010-01-21T22:50Z,"For those asking it does work in Win7
I have win7 - 64-bit HomePrem

I had same problem and wouldn't work, I was saving files/patch to wrong location. Correct locations are as follows

Save licence in same folder as objectdock.exe
for me: c:/program files/stardock/objectdock
save patch to folder containing CrashRpt.dll
for me: c:/program files/stardock/objectdock"
,codymx,2010-02-08T05:04Z,"I have it installed no problem, but when I try to use the start button or taskbar it tells me that it's not compatible with 64 bit versions of windows. can you help me solve this?"

,Ri6e5t,2010-02-11T18:57Z,"fiddlefart: thanks for your help to everyone ;)

codymx:? think you have to find a specific 64 bit program if there is one :)

as for u bridog80 you must know that the keyen injects a code to the licence (at least that,s what i think,i will soon scan it with virus total) but dont worry the patch is from embarace and they dont just put out there trojans :P"

,robocop123,2010-02-24T10:15Z,"I'm using Vista, i saved the sig file into the main folder, and followed by patching it. For some weird reason, all i get is a window telling me that the keygen can't open the file. Any ideas why?"
,Ri6e5t,2010-02-25T17:20Z,"robocop123, you have to run keygen as administrator, and make sure you have selected the   "".dll"" file that keygen specifies... Comment on any other result. (Even if you solved it let the others know) :)"
