,diulasing,2009-12-04T04:15Z,"Thanks for the upload... Great quality as always, but it would be perfect if the Blu-ray disc was from the US since all the words in the movie (not the subtitle add-on) are NOT in English"

,trudat,2009-12-09T06:11Z,"excellent 720p quality as usual.  but you might want to mention that it's ripped from a non-US bluray disc, so a lot of the text in the movie is foreign.  it looks to be polish maybe?  see for yourself:

,vivatpb5776,2011-04-23T23:00Z,"You all need to take a deep breath and do a more thorough job of QC (Quality Check) before you comment.

I, like everyone else, initially thought there may be something amiss when I noticed the word, ""Przedstawia,"" in the opening credits. For those that care, Przedstawia is Polish for Presents. However, that is the ONLY foreign language in this movie file. I watched the first 15 minutes of the movie as well as scanned the remaining portion of the movie, all dialogue is in ENGLISH.

This, coupled with the excellent quality of the video (1280*544), makes this an perfect find. Thank you uploader."
,lamtuyen,2011-05-19T08:29Z,"thank you man

Just a note, there was a tiny area of pixelation around 19 min 15 sec. Not a big deal, just thought I would mention it."
