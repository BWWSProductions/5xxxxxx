Issue 5 of Sex and Murder features stories of sexual plague, kidnapping, torture, revenge, and a healthy dose of demonic fornication. Between these stories of depravity and slaughter, we have poems that delve into the psyche of serial killers, the demented homeless, and folks like you and me. This issue also includes a link to an mp3 of the song PURGATORY, a black metal interpretation of the poem. So come on in to Sex and Murder Magazine, and see just how good it can feel to be scared.
