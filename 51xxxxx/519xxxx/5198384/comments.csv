I've been wanting to catch up a bit on Monk
(hadn't seen it in years)
getting 15 and 16 as we speak.
do you have any smaller files of earlier episodes of series 8?
I realise to go all the way back would take me ages with my dl capacity?
I know your limited to but thought I'd ask
Aroha :-)"

@valu59er: I have found only episodes 10-last one. Others has been gone. If you have patience, I.ll re-up all I have, one-by-one. Beware, it will be painfully slow download, Monk stays without support (seeders) extremely fast."

but I will only be able to do most of my DLing between 2 and 10 am Aussie time.
This I know is a sad and tragic tale but it is so.
But hey many thanks."

 hours or so and thats the slow ones.
I no complain about that.
So I will set it up to get what I can tonight and gather what ever you put up.
I can seed all day long just not with great speed.
So once got I'll keep seeding when ever my computer is on for a while."
