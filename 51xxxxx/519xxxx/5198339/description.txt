Since the death of her father in 1983, Sara Erie has embarked on a life-long journey to discover the causes of the massive disaster inside the National Super Collider Project that killed her father, Dr. William Erie, and several of the most gifted nuclear physicists in the nation.

Now, after twenty years of coping with painful memories and an overwhelming sense of loss, Sara convinces her fatherâ€™s best friend, nuclear physicist, Dr. Jonas Andersen, to allow her to accompany a research team into the abandoned super collider to discover what went wrong.

What Sara finds surpasses all the rules of physics and launches the team into a terrifying voyage through a world haunted with both real and imagined evils.
