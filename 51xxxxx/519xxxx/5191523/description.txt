The story of an Australian woman the Prince of Wales loved and allegedly abandoned is told in Kanga: Prince Charlesâ€™ Other Mistress.

If Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale â€œKangaâ€ Tryon was a talented amateur who eventually committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationships with the Windsors. Her life ended tragically early when, aged 49, she died in unusual circumstances just months after the untimely death of Diana in 1997.
