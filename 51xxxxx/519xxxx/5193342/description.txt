The author of the famous hit â€˜Put Your Hands For Detroitâ€™, will release at the end of
January a CD for the well known series of mixes, Ministry Of Sound Sessions. The
eleventh session has two CDs and some exclusive productions signed by Fedde Le
Grand.

The MOS Sessions compilation brings some of the most fresh house tracks of the
moment, mixed in a perfect manner, just like the MOS brand used us. The first CD is very
simple and it has a DJ set made of 12 tracks. It starts with Pastaboysâ€™ remix for Ricky L
Feat M:ckâ€™s track, Born Again. The house sound of this track is obvious not only thanks to
the rhythm, but also tanks to the rather interesting vocals. The mix passes discretely from
progressive house to electro and even tech-house and funky house. Some tracks that are
really remarkable here are Soul Elementz Feat. Sabrina Johnston - My Way Out, Prom
Feat. Katherine Ellis - Do It, Dumb Dan - Mister Right. Fedde Le Grand brings nothing
new on this first CD, he rather gives us some excellent music for dancing in clubs. All this
is brought to light by primordial elements like rhythm and energy.

The second CD starts very powerful with electro house. Kenton Slash Demon - Adaptor
Included brings a euphoria that remains until the end of the second mix. After Switch -
Just Bounce 2 This, the mix continues with two productions of Fedde Le Grand, the first
Take No Shhh, and the second a remix for Camille Jones- Creeps. This second mix is
more organized and fuller of life than the first one, the genre being more like electro
house and house. Some titles that really make the difference here are Microfunk aka
2000 & One & Dave Ellesmere â€“ Pecan, Filthy Rich - Itâ€™s Like That and Erick E - The Beat
Is Rockinâ€™ (Fedde Le Grand Remix)
