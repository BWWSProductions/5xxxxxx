Lossless/FLAC
Includes: Log/Cue

"Just as Diplo killed it on MIA's Piracy Funds Terrorism mix that dropped before her debut, he does it again with Brooklyn's own Santogold, mixing up jams off her recent debut album. Expect to hear exclusive blends and mixes of her singles, masterfully executed by Diplo himself. The styles flow smoothly from everything under the sun: dirty south, club, classic cuts, dance tracks, dancehall, dubstep, reggae and more. What's also cool is that although she's signed to a big label like Downtown, this is a Mad Decent pressing. So props to Diplo for making this happen. Expect to hear shit from Santi (duh), XXXchange, Ratatat, Richie Spice, Three 6 Mafia, B-52's, Kid Cudi, Switch, Radioclit, Benga, Tony Matterhorn, Skream, Warrior Queen, Barrington Levy, and more. The mix is 75 minutes, perfect for the summertime jams."
