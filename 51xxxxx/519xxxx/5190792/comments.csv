,fatsoft,2009-12-01T16:45Z,"Yes, that's how I meant it. It's the maximum quality available... Could always be better, but until we get proper progressive broadcast this is as good as it gets.
And just to clarify - the mkv contains the actual interlaced H.264 stream as broadcast by BBC HD on Freesat. The resolution is 1440x1080 (SAR of 4:3, DAR 16:9), average bitrate about 9Mbps."
,melcom,2009-12-05T21:39Z,"please seed the ts also. 
mkv is nothing but trouble."

Is it...? What kind of troubles do you have? I've never had any to be honest.

If you can suggest a program to simply cut the TS, I'd be happy to seed it too."
,this_is_illegal,2009-12-10T00:55Z,"but this is WAAAAAAAAY better than the ones in 720p ... so noticable! I've just downloaded both in the past 10 minutes... seeding now, with s14 e01 to e04 in 720p. so fatsoft, do you have s14 e01,02 and e04 also in 1080i? coz so far this is the only s14 topgear in 1080, if not the only one in the entire series! - GIVE US MORE fatsoft! MORE! will seed if u do! thanx!"

it doesn't work on ps3, xbox and most standalone players. converting it back to .ts seems to be a matter of luck with a 50/50 chance...

I'm not into the ""cutting business"", but maybe H264TS Cutter works. "
