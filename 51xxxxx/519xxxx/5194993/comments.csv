And Bricktop said, ""And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, it profiteth me nothing.""

And I, like many others, am thankful for these gifts.  They have changed the way we are entertained. Changed how we share and touched countless souls. We are truly blessed.

For thine is the bluray, the ps3, and the glory
forever and ever, Amen. "

,LuHash,2009-12-06T19:17Z,i'm not askig about general usage of software used to convert the movies - i know how to do this;) i'm just asking did you set anything additional during ffdshow installation or in the ffdshow configuration panel (postrprocessing setting are affecting the video opened for recompression in ripbot...)
