,clown564,2009-12-10T06:01Z,so... is this game realy worth the 5 gigs gone on my computer?
[T],Games4theworld,2009-12-10T09:35Z,"Hi,

@FTL3
          This is The Sims 3, not with the expansion, so just use the Crack included and you can play like you bought the Game. (Without Downloadable Content)

@Clown564
                 If you like Sims games, be sure you Download it, because it's a very nice Game compared to the other Sims games."

  You cán play the Game, but you will get a screen telling you that your version is not legal, and it isn't, because you didn't buy the Game. In the white screen with the text that your Sims version is not legal, you would normally see EA and The Sims 3 news.

[T],Games4theworld,2009-12-23T10:56Z,"Hi,


Hi,

@Blackbyrd
 Did you Download thís The Sims 3 Torrent? You should Mount the Images with Daemon Tools Lite. (If you don't know how to Mount, ask for our free Mounting Guide: Games4theworld@hotmail.com ) Mostly Cracked Games can not be Updated, however, you can try using a Cracked Patch. Why should you Update at all? If you can play the Game like it is, just play it like that. If you have any problems, feel free to contact our (Live) Support: Games4theworld@hotmail.com

@jfre07
First, Mount both Images. When the Installation asks for Disk 1, click 'Browse' and select óne of the two Mounted Images. If you get an error, just click the other Image you Mounted.    When the Installation asks for Disk 2, do the same. The Installation should go on now."
,Blackbyrd,2009-12-24T02:43Z,"BIG THANKS to the people at Games4theworld!!! I followed your instructions and I got the sims to work yay!!! Do you have a torrent for WA yet? If not I'll wait until you do, you've been people who actually got my game to work. A thousand and one thank yous. xoxo. XD."
,firelovinggerbil,2009-12-24T21:15Z,"Hey, I have the same problem as jfre.  I can find the 2 images that I mounted, but I can't select just the disk by itself.  I go through and it says I need openworld1.  I try to find it in the browse but the file doesn't show up."

Open the '# Crack' file in the .rar you Downloaded and copy + paste the 'TS3.exe' to the 'Game Directory > Game > Bin'; standard this will be: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin  and REPLACE it by the existing one. The Game should work now.

Open the '# Crack' file in the .rar you Downloaded and copy + paste the 'TS3.exe' to the 'Game Directory > Game > Bin'; standard this will be: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin  and REPLACE it by the existing one. The Game should work now.

@othatzsokewl 

The blue screen of death is a problem with The Sims 3, which EA doesn't have a fix for. It's a random problem. You could try to Install our Ambitions release from www.games4theworld.org and after Installing apply our Ambitions fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/fixes-f18/the-sims-3-ambitions-error-0x039e8474-fix-version-0000-t451.htm
There's a small chance that it'll fix your problem.


@ebreezyx & @sikemike & @Ayzed

First, Mount both Images. When the Installation asks for Disk 1, click 'Browse' and select Ã³ne of the two Mounted Images. If you get an error, just click the other Image you Mounted.    When the Installation asks for Disk 2, do the same. The Installation should go on now.
If you don't really understand the above, watch our Installation Video on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWNCFdqqNIg


@hubby1723

Update your Graphic Card's drivers and see if it fixes the error.

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

,crackers123,2011-06-30T08:36Z,"hey,
I am completely new to this...

 I have managed to download the game fully, and have followed all instructions as well as I can, but when I click the Sims3 desktop icon and hit the play button, it asks for authentication code. I put in the code I (think) I used for the install. It won't let me past that point! What am I doing wrong? 
Thanks! "
,crackers123,2011-06-30T09:32Z,"Having read through all the comments, I think I need to put the TS3.exe file in the ""bin"" folder, but I can't find it.. in the Sims 3 folder, there is: 
SigsCache
Screenshots
Recorded videos
InstalledWorlds
Exports
Downloads
DCCache
DCBackup
ContentPatch
(All folders)
tslus.bin
Sims3LauncherLogFile
(As files) 

Do I replace the ""tslus.bin"" with the ""TS3"" file? 

Thanks..."

@shadowzuzi
We provide a different torrent for each expansion.

@mistcrescent3
Try to re-download using uTorrent.

@Love2Help
De snelheid verschilt per persoon. Het ligt aan uw internet snelheid Ã©n het aantal Seeders (Mensen die het bestand aan het uploaden zijn)

@pseudosky & @crackers123 & @Dim.Pand
Open the '# Crack' file in the .rar you Downloaded and copy + paste the 'TS3.exe' to the 'Game Directory > Game > Bin'; by default this will be: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin  and REPLACE it by the existing one. The Game should work now.

@paulwall1209
  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

@VrikD794 & @crackers123
Try looking in: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin

My path to bin is:
L:GameBin
(L being the virtual drive)
When I copy and paste it into the bin, it says:
There's not enough space on disk 1.
Also I can't find a TS3.exe in the bin, only a TS3.ex_ . There's also a Sims3launcher.ex_
I extracted with: Extractnow
I mounted with: Virtualclonedrive
Please help."
,OMFGItsME,2012-05-08T21:38Z,"Found the anwser:
I clicked on the (virtual) drive, and then open.
That was wrong.
Correct path:
1.Go to C:/ (computer)
2.Go to Program Files 86x
3.Electronic Arts
4.Sims 3
5.Game
6.Bin

That's the place with the TS3.exe .
