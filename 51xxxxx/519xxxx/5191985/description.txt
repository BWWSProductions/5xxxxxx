The other two uploaded before this are broken and won't play in any player at all that I had and were stuck at 98%. I "fixed" them, all I did was pop these into Audacity and reencode them into Ogg format. I don't know what was wrong with them. At least these will play.

Plays fine in VLC now. (could not do MP3, sorry)
