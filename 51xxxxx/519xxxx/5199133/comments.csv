Don't bother with this since it might contain Viruses and Trojans!

Instead pick up the LATEST Winzip from its own site:

http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm

And then just use:

name: WinZip

Serial: F7LH3-ZHK80-EJ7EF-WX4XC-HQW01-MGN9X

And DON'T FORGET to turn OFF the

>>Options>Configuration>Miscellaneous>Check For Updates!
Set it to: ""Do not check for updates"".


And do NOT let it install the Google Toolbar while installing Winzip ...
