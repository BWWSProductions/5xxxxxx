,KGB1,2009-12-06T21:13Z,"Im using MPC to watch this movie, and none of SUBS are working."
,Bamsefar2,2009-12-07T00:10Z,"










Everybody that knows what a catastrophy-movie is about knows this one. It is a pretty good movie, I would say 6/10.








But the (swedish) subs.....................................





If you want to relax and see a good movie with working subs - wait untill better UL is given. The subs seems to have been made by a mashine.

Realy, realy bad!


(right (yes) will be ""höger"" and major (bormästare) will be major (army) and so on.......


But turn the subs off  and enjoy, because the pic-quality is great!

wo nice movie stilll lol
watched it on theaters and on the PC
but i recomend to watch this movie on theaters"
,greenfrog,2009-12-08T08:56Z,UNBREAKBLE: Stop complaining about the PAL versions. Its your problem for buying an Apple if you can't play it. IBM's and every DVD player I've ever owned (USA) plays pals. Even xbox360. A proper dvd player converts it on the fly. Even my cheap $29 from bestbuy.
,LunD86,2009-12-08T19:14Z,"How are the danish subs? Are they real or horrible google translated??

Sailo: 

I dont know if possible, but could you either not include translated subs, or at least make it clear wich subs are real and whats not. 

Besides this your doing an awesome job, i have seen a few of your movies all in great quality. But these translated subs make it unbearable to watch. 

Thanks."
,Cinema09,2009-12-08T22:39Z,"I agree with marine_6 a this movie is sick and fantastick  and I have watched it in the cinema I recomend you guys to watch it in the cinema

,splekits,2009-12-09T10:33Z,hi guys! can anyone PLS help me find japanese subs 4 this movie? or any site that has movie torrents with jap subs? any info will be very much appreciated! thanx! 
,Krispies,2009-12-09T13:56Z,"Unbreakable_bmore wasn't complaining that Macs don't play PAL discs; they do. His issue seems to be that his friends' standalone players don't, and as a Mac user he can't use IFOEdit to convert PAL to NTSC. In which case I would recommend he get his hands on MPEG2 Works, a Mac-only app that will do the trick."

good quality on the film, but terrible translation on the norwegian sub.. 1/5 of the film is not translatet, but they have take the orginal words from the movie... but when im thinking that this movie still is going on the cinema in norway, so are my conclusion, its a good attempt to translate the movie...
