I consider Siddy Ranks to be in the same category as Gregory Isaacs, Beres Hammond and other such-like Reggae crooners. Strangely, his music remains somewhat obscure. Take a lsiten to this album, True Love, and let me know your thoughts. I think Siddy has the quality to make the Greatest Reggae hits of all time!
this is the man in action.
