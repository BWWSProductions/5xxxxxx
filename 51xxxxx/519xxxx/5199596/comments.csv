Furthermore, there will be no final Office Accounting 2010 editions of any kind, so Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2009 UK Service Pack 2 remains the latest version and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.

Microsoft has done a deal with their partners, Mamut, to provide the usual support, although that does not appear to extend to downloading the software even if you have a licence.  There is a legacy Microsoft website that purports to allow licensees to enter the originally registered email address for a download link, but it does not work.  Mamut are supposed to be picking up where Microsoft left off in terms of providing accounting software for SMEs, but whether or not it is any good remains to be seen and many businesses just want to continue using what already works very well for them."
,DonJo128,2009-12-16T13:15Z,"Excellent, i thought OBA was a thing of the past.
I shall be installing at the first opportunity.
I have tried the Mamut ""replacement"" software   and i will not be using it, it is like going back to the old days."
,DonJo128,2009-12-21T17:47Z,"Well, i have tried to install this but only get the repair or remove option and when i take the repair option it tells me to insert the CD - which i never had as it was originally a download (which i no longer have - hence the excitement of this download).
Any ideas?"
,Agent Pro Bono,2009-12-29T22:43Z,"I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with installation.  It sounds like you still have elements of your original installation left on your computer - Perhaps registry entries for example.  Try going for the ""Remove"" option to completely remove the original installation, then installing from scratch.  Uninstalling should not remove any of your personal files and settings, although you should back-up first as a precaution.

Also make sure that you have completely extracted the 7-Zip file to new folder, otherwise your computer may not be able to find the rest of the installation files, causing it to prompt you to insert a CD.  If you are being prompted for a CD even though the 7-Zip file is completely extracted, you might be able to click a ""Browse"" button and navigate to the relevant folder.

I hope this helps, but if you are still stuck, post another comment and I will do my best to help you."
,You Rock!,2009-12-30T23:26Z,It's asking me for a key...
,GMSD,2010-01-18T14:37Z,"Downloaded OK and extracted using 7-zip but when tried to install keep getting message saying that setup failed to install microsoft accounting 2009, any ideas."
,Agent Pro Bono,2010-01-23T10:52Z,"You will need a key to use this beyond any trial period as it is not cracked.  I only intended to make this available to people who had lost their original software.  If someone out there wants to repackage it as a cracked version, be my guest."
,Agent Pro Bono,2010-01-23T10:54Z,"GMSD, I have no idea why it would fail to install.  I will need more information to help you."
,martin15372,2010-02-08T09:11Z,having problems installing please help keeps saying set up failed to install Microsoft sql server 2005 express(mssmlbiz) 
,Agent Pro Bono,2010-02-23T22:19Z,"STOP PRESS!  Service Pack 3 has just been released.  Update in the usual way to download and install it.

Martin, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express(mssmlbiz) is a freely available application that is required to perform certain functions in various applications, MS Accounting Professional 2009 being one such application.  This is included within the Accounting installation, but you may already have a version on you computer that is preventing the installation of this version.

Your version may be newer or corrupted.  Look in Programs and Features (or the equivalent) to see if you already have it.  If you do already have it, consider whether or not MS Accounting works despite the failed installation of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express.  If it does not work, try uninstalling Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express and then reinstalling MS Accounting.  As ever, remember to backup first - This will be easier if you know which application was being supported by Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express in the first place.

On the other hand, if you do not already have Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express installed, try downloading it from MS and installing it before you install MS Accounting.

If neither of those suggestions work, try searching the Internet using the folowing search term: Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express failed installation."
