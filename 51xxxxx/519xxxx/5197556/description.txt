This is the EOS solutions software disk from the Canon 7D.
It is version 21.1.

It is in 7zip form with an .iso inside.

The .iso is good for Mac AND PC.

un7zip it, burn (or mount) and enjoy.


on windows, winrar can open the .7z file, on mac, it should be handled by default.

I chose 7zip to save 100MB on the file size.
