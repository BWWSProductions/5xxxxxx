,webw,2009-12-06T08:25Z,"Also, thanks for keeping DTS-MA...I really look forward to more releases with lossless audio. The popcorn hours supports bitstreaming of this codec, so it is superb that your release has DTS-MA."
,0h0h,2010-05-09T01:28Z,Thank You for the up! Just 1 question: does this have menu and/or special features??

Notes

This contains the most popular bonus features found with Monsters, Inc.: Outtakes and company play video, Mike's New Car, and For The Birds.

There are more subtitle tracks than you will ever need--easy to demux and also helpful if you speak Spanish. 

Audio tracks contain 2ch Director commentary, DTS 5.1, and AC3 5.1 Spanish.

If you demux the other languages and remove bonus features, the main movie comes out to only 6.09GB."

,finisher489,2011-10-08T19:01Z,"uthacalthing is 100% right!!! This could be a virus, a fake, it could need a password and you could spend days downloading this stupidity and at the end it could be 7.38GB of spam and false stupidity"
