[In a A Taste for Sin] Jim Phalen is another poor schmo with a history of infidelity. He too caught his wife with another man. His revenge on them was not pretty. But that's all behind him. Now Jim works for a liquor store. (Alcohol is practically a main character in Brewer's books.) One of his delivery customers is Felice, a black-haired beauty of eighteen, married to a local bank manager. Felice first entices Jim to join her in her exhausting rape fantasies, then pops the question: would he help her murder her husband and steal all the money from the bank vault?
Phalen naturally reacts as any sane man would, and rejects the idea completely. But a steady diet of Felice breaks down his resistance, and before long he is actively engaged in the plot, trying to work every detail to the nth degree to figure how to get the money, and Felice too.
But, of course, there are complications: the cop who keeps nosing around, suspicious of a small robbery that Jim pulled at the liquor store to generate some quick cash; the sleazy hustler who worked with Jim to move some of the stolen liquor who now wants in on the action; the suspicious husband. Jim's absinthe drinking. And all this told from Phalen's first-person point of view.
The end is positively frantic. A mad scramble.
