[V],Slickinator,2009-12-06T00:24Z,the patch has false positives its fine 
,ispgonewild,2009-12-08T12:29Z,"Yeah my Symantec Endpoint Protection also thought it were a virus, but I can assure you that turning the antivirus application of and applying the patch works flawless. Half of all patches, keygens and everything else are reported to be viruses, and not so strange if you are to think about it. The purpose of these executables is to modify other executables.

Thank you Slickinator for a great upload."
