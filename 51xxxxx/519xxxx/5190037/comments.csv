,sigber,2009-12-03T08:31Z,"This is for anyone interested in the forum post Ricky is referring to in the ""Guide to..."" episode. 

You may want to check it out after you've heard it to avoid spoilers. I googled it after hearing Ricky took it off a forum, and read it while he was explaining ^^. Good fun.

,MrMelon,2009-12-04T11:29Z,"Seriously, what are you doing to the speed? It was the same problem with Guide to Society.

It's a little too fast thus making it harder to enjoy. Add to that the sound quality is appalling, no tags (apart from genre: ""Blues"", what the hell?)... 

If you're going to upload something, do it right.

I don't recommend downloading from this torrent."
,refoops,2009-12-04T18:13Z,"MrMelon is a fool, don't listen to him. Torrent downloaded quickly, and sound quality is great. No problems.

Thanks to the uploader! Thanks for sharing Karl's bald mank head."
