As Seen on TV" is a look back into the past and a glimpse into the future of Christian rock's
 premiere band. Put on the full armor of God with David, Tony, Karl and Jamie as they trace
the history of Guardian from the early 80's arena rock sound of LA to the organic hard driving
 sound that is Guardian today. This video includes never before released footage from the garage
band days in LA, and candid interviews with the Guardian wives and families. Running Time - 45:41
