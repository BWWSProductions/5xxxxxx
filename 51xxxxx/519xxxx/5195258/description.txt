    Thievery Corporation once again raises the bar with their incendiary and eagerly anticipated fifth independent studio album Radio Retaliation. Along with longtime microphone co-conspirators like Sleepy Wonder, Lou Lou, and Notch the outernational DJ and production duo are joined this time by a new cast of musical collaborators including NigeriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afro-beat heir Femi Kuti, Brazilian star vocalist and guitarist Seu Jorge, Indian sitar virtuoso Anushka Shankar, Slovakian chanteuse and violinist Jana Andevska, and Washington DCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own godfather of go-go Chuck Brown. With an uncompromising socio-political agenda and richly layered production touching upon the eclectic sounds of Jamaica, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, Radio Retaliation is Thievery CorporationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broadest and most progressive album yet!
