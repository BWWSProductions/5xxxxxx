This is a small collection of publications on French foreign Legion uploaded by request. There are possibly more books on this subject, however that's all I got so far.

All files are PDF with retail covers for thumbnail view. Each is packed separately with 7zip. These are plain archives (no SFX) with only PDF inside.
Credit goes to original uploaders however these files have been edited by me- mainly OCR to make them searchable. In some instances Acrobat Clear Scan option was enabled to make the fonts look smoother and reduce file size without any quality loss. Others were scanned as "image exact" due to loss in quality that occurred when clear scan was enabled.

This pack contains:

-French Foreign Legion Paratroops (Osprey Elite Series #6) Martin Windrow and Kevin Lyles, 1985, 64 pages

-French Foreign Legion 1914-45 (Osprey Men-at-Arms #325) by Martin Windrow and Mike Chappell, 1999, 49 pages 

-French Foreign Legion: Infantry and Cavalry since 1945 (Osprey Men-at-Arms #300) by Martin Windrow and Mike Chappell, 1997, 67 pages 

-Inside the French Foreign Legion. The Sensational Story of the World's Toughest Army, John Parker, 1998, 310 pages
