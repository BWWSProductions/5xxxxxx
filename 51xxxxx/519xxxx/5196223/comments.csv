,Hardts,2010-04-19T17:14Z,"I don't want to be horrible to your torrent, and this is not to take a swing at you - Zemog, but I really have to say this; Most of these sound effects are a complete ripp-off from the Motif Xs - a Yamaha synthesizer that I have had myself for 3 years now. 

The guy that made this - all he did was press a few notes on the keyboard and the synthesizer does the rest basicly, and there are many places where you can hear that he's playing isn't completely in sync with the patterns played by the Xs - not acceptable for ''designer sound effects''. I promise you these sound effects are not very hard to make, not much efford but a lot of time simply because of the quantity.

You may disagree, and part of the reason I think this is crap is probably that I have the synth myself, so there is nothing new for me here - but it's also because better soundscapes are possible with the keyboard if you just put a little bit more effort into it.

Also I was expecting real sound effects but most of these (in the ambience section for instance) are just short pieces of mostly crappy music. There are a few good ones in there, but it's mostly bad.."
