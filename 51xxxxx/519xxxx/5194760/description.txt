Update 1:
---------
If you had any crashes download and install Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable and latest Microsoft .NET Framework.

Many people have problems cracking properly and playing the L4D2 game.
So I decided to make a full RIP of the game to make it easy for you.
The RIP was tested and works perfectly. 
It also includes the v2.0.0.3 update.
I'll try to keep the RIP updated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Notes:
1) Extract
2) Run "Start Left 4 Dead 2.bat" to play
3) DO NOT HAVE STEAM OPEN WHILE PLAYING!

Garena Settings Notes:
1) Executable Settings: Path of Loader.exe
2) Game Bootstrap Paraments: left4dead2.exe

Many thanks to
1) Stryder the creator of the loader
2) CS.RIN.RU forums' users for the help
