Yes those modes works without Garena.

,darksniper87,2009-12-04T12:30Z,"@savageafro
There is no setup because it's a RIP
The game is in english"

I think IniGen is not necessary for playing the game. You can test it."
,darksniper87,2009-12-05T00:43Z,Guys if the game works fine please make a comment here so others can see that it works
,dio1sp,2009-12-05T02:03Z,does this have an error when u exit the game? like the stryder release version 2.0.0.2? (Left 4 Dead 2 no-Steam.ru)
,darksniper87,2009-12-05T02:14Z,"@dio1sp
Yes. This is a bug of the loader. It will be fixed on future updates. "
,dio1sp,2009-12-05T02:25Z,@darksniper87    maybe i will wait for the update of the new loader. hope its still works with the 2.0.0.2 stryder release that i downloaded coz the only problem with that is only the error on exiting the game. annoying lol. tested on 4 pc's playing via LAN simultaneously with no problems. pls. keep this page updated darksniper87. thanks.
,darksniper87,2009-12-05T02:33Z,"@dio1sp
I will release updates for this torrent but I don't think they will work on yours. Stryder don't have any release. He is just the creator of the loader."
,dio1sp,2009-12-05T02:42Z,@darksniper87 ok. so i have to download the whole game again. i see. hoping for your stable release version. thanks.

One question though: When i try to start the game via garena it crashes after the intro :S
i did everything as written in the instructions but still i get this msg:
the executable you set may not connect to the virtual LAN with non-standard executable, would you like to start with compatible mode ? Click YES to start with compatible mode and NO to start normally"".
The options are only YES and Cancel and whichever i press, the game crashes again after the intro.
Any idea how to fix it ?
thanks in advance."

,Robotmenace,2011-09-16T06:51Z,"Okay, unless I missed it, either no one has experienced or addressed this problem. I couldn't find any solution online. So I'm hoping someone here will have an idea on how to fix this. It's a sound issue. Everything runs perfectly until starting a single player game. The gunshots are severely muffled, and there's no audible player dialogue. All the other sounds work fine. Even bullet ricochets. I tried the rebuild and update audio cache commands and they did nothing. Any help, please? I'd really like to fix this."

Have they fixed it cause it was a long time ago this game came out or is it just something i'm doing?"
