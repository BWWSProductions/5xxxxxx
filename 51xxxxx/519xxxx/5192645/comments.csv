,DavieRoss,2009-12-29T21:05Z,"Vahnx,

If you did not specify remote logon credentials when building the bootable media the connection to the Acronis agent will be enabled by typing any symbols into the prompt window - per Acronis Help File."
,DavieRoss,2009-12-29T21:06Z,"Murlok,

Great up - thanks very much."

,egazz,2010-01-30T04:48Z,"Sadly, bootable media isn't working for me (""cannot create initial ramdisk""), but it is not fault of the uploader. So good work and thanks."
,tsd6,2010-02-03T21:09Z,"Works great Murlok.  Has saved my bacon in Win7, during a migration, with the ""restore to dissimilar hardware"" feature.

Hopefully someone will find the DeDupe bits, and add them.

,zzzziiipp,2010-09-29T23:29Z,"Thanks!
A beginners question: 

Quite soon during the installation guide the user is prompted to ""Specify credentials for the Acronis services"", it says: 
""The Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 Agent component runs as service. Specify the account under which the computer's service will run when the component is installed""

The default choice is ""Acronis Managed Machine Service account"" and the radio button is ""Create a new account""
If one clicks ""Next"" the next message you get is: 
""Ports that need to be open"" 
and in my case: 
""9876 TCP""

The first question: What does this mean? 
Will it cause any trouble for the user to use this setting (open the port) and install the product?

There is also the possibility to make the choice of: ""Use an existing account""
When doing so, using the Administrator account (that must have a login), you get the same message: 
""Ports that need to be open"" 
and in my case: 
""9876 TCP""

Second question: 
Is there a possibility to get around this (not open any port)?"
,eagle100_3,2011-05-28T20:57Z,"I could not get the install to accept the supplied serials. The ""Next"" remained greyed out.  The serials provided with the 11639 build do work with this 11345 install!"
