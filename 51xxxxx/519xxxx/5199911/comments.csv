,s3xt0y,2009-12-07T04:28Z,"Video: 10
Audio: 5 (has some strange high pitch sound that is kinda hurting and irritating my ears.)
everything is great besides for that high pitch sound that hurts your ears terribly, the sound is a bit low, but just turn up your volume."
,hatethefake,2009-12-07T06:54Z,"why is the audio of R5 so bad latley???
But thanks for your upload TvTeam but i will wait for some better audio"
