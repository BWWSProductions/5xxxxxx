,hivoltg33,2009-12-01T23:21Z,Anyone know the difference between the original and the Special Edition?
,dclpirate,2009-12-02T04:54Z,"I don't think there is a difference, ""Special Edition"" was what was on the DVD case :)"
,dclpirate,2009-12-02T06:47Z,Must of been some bonus special features on the DVD
,Iced02,2009-12-12T10:30Z,i love this movie thx
,krazeestumbles,2010-05-06T22:55Z,OMG this movie is classic....i remember watching this as i kid
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-18T20:46Z,shut up pecks.
,RickyTheFish,2011-01-04T11:52Z,"@hivoltg33 I think dclpirate is correct; there really isn't any difference from the original movie. I think the reason it's the ""Special Edition"" is because it was finally released on DVD instead of VHS. My DVD case also says Special Edition, so I wouldn't be surprised if all DVDs were labeled in this way.

Thanks for the upload, dclpirate; I've been looking for a decent copy of this movie since my DVD got ruined."

,ratinacage78,2011-04-14T03:20Z,there is no difference. the special edition sucks every bit as much as the original. ;-)

,pinzmoo,2012-04-19T20:00Z,"This torrent is jacked, after downloading vlc tells me  the .avi is broken and asks me to repair, if  you repair only 29secs of the movie work, if you don't repair the movie acts like its being streamed with horrible bitrate.

now i see a greenie commenting on this so ya i know your legit, but since then and now, this shit broke."
,godgali,2012-05-03T04:34Z,haha!  well played karmine
,sukr4m,2012-05-07T00:41Z,@pinzmoo. Maybe you are facing codec problems. Try MPCStar.
