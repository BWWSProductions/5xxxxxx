   LiquidSonics' Reverberate is a highly efficient convolution audio processor 
   offering  true  zero-latency  operation for  two  separate,  stereo impulse 
   responses.  
             
   Reverberate seeks to provide a richer and more dynamic sounding reverb from 
   impulse  responses  by  optionally  modulating  an  amalgamation  of   two, 
   separately controllable true stereo IRs using an LFO. Further modulation is 
   possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus 
   provides a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype  paragraphic 
   equaliser is provided  with dual LFOs.  These features make  for a livelier 
   sound than typically  associated with some  convolution reverbs, at  a very 
   competitive price.
