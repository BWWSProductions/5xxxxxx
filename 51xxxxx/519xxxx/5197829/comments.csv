I just have a question! or request maybe!
would you be interested in unploading the same movie but without english subs hard coded?
or would that be to much to ask? just so people from other countries like myself and many others could put their own subs without english subs underneath! its anoing having both!

since you did it in spanish as well! i was hopping you could be the salvation of the nation! and up it with no subs! thanks!!!
