,Virabhadra,2009-12-16T07:23Z,"Easy fix, guys! Here's how: 

VLC media player has an audio-sync feature if the audio is off from the video. While the movie is playing, press the ""J"" or ""K"" keys to move the audio track backward or forward. Each press of the key adjusts the audio track by 50ms, backward or forward. I found that the audio syncs back up with this movie when you hit the ""J"" key until you get to about -800ms (press J 16 times when the audio shifts off-track.)

There may be parts of the movie where different timings come into play (I haven't watched the whole thing yet), but just keep adjusting with the ""J"" and ""K"" keys until the actors' words sync up with their lips.

VoilÄ‚ !"
