Karnamrita Dasi - Dasi (Prayers for Women)

Voice like an angel.

This is a realy Sweet Album
Gopi Geet,the song of Radharani's feelings of sepperation
when Krishna leaves Vrindavan to go to Dwarkhadesha.
These are Radha/Krishna's pastimes,(Leela)enacted for the
benifit of all,by his causless mercy.

In fact!!The eternal form of Krishna never realy leaves Vrindavan But remains eternaly in Goloka Vrindavan & Gokula Vrindavan similtaineously.
The form of Krishna that goes to Dwarkha is a Narayan Expantion just as in the Rasa Leela dance.

Reviews from Amazon.com

(I)Musically and emotionally compelling, Karnamrita's voice spans the range from heartbreakingly plaintive ("Yamunastakam")
to complexly erotic ("Story of Pingala") while always remaining firmly rooted in the devotional modality that so thoroughlly imbues all her work.
You won't find a more unique and inspiring collection of songs rendered so thoughtfully. A superb work of art.

(2)I cannot be as eloquant as the other reviewers below but Karnamrita's music is a magical gem to be discovered.
This is world music, not 'new age', soulfully inspired by her tenure in India.
Her vocal training is up there with other vocal greats like Lisa Girrard (of Dead Can Dance fame).

(3)One of the few selection of songs that seems to breathe harmony and love in your surroundings each time they are played.
Needless to say, they are a favourite addition to my religious music collection.
