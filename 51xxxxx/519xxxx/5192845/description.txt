From British Police Constable, Albert Burgess: 

"Edward Heath was told in 1971 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office a major office of state that if we joined the EEC within 3 decades or by the end of the century we would have lost our constitution and ceased to be an independent sovereign state and would merely be a region of a greater Europe, and they recommended that was what he should do. 

Heath sent for a man by the name of Norman Readdaway who worked for the FCO information research department and told him to set up a department tasked with changing the minds of the ordinary man who was anti EEC by a large majority. By taking control of the press and by lying to the country they were able for 3 weeks to change the public's mind according to the opinion polls and Heath put the 72 EEC Act through and signed the treaty of Rome. 

We started on day one to lose our constitution with 2000 new EEC Laws and the loss of our fishing grounds. Over the last 35 years our manufacturing industry has been destroyed, our food production industry has been destroyed, our armed forces have been so degraded that they cannot defend this country and we are shortly to be taken over completely by the EU. 

Treason is many things. You have read one of them, now go and read the rest of what constitutes treason and sedition. I did not get some police books. I owned them because I was a police constable and since then I have bought for myself a very good library of old books on English history and the constitutional law of this country, treason is what I have said it is and BLACK BLOODY TREASON IT IS."
