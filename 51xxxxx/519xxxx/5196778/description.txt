Windows Driver Kit (WDK). The WDK is a fully integrated driver development system that contains the Windows Driver Device Kit (DDK) and tests for stability and reliability of Windows drivers, including the following:

Windows Driver Foundation (WDF) simplifies the development and support of Windows drivers.

Header file refactoring (Windows Vista and later versions) reduces header file complexity by providing a simpler directory structure, eliminating declaration conflicts, and using a single set of header files for all supported Windows versions.

Installable File Systems (IFS) Kit includes headers, libraries, samples, and documentation that are distributed as part of the WDK.

Verifiers and static analysis tools, such as PREfast and Static Driver Verifier, help you find bugs at compile time.
