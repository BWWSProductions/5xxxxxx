After all their attempts end in failure, Tess and Emily decide to paint an advertisement on a giant billboard situated high above Sunset Boulevard. A lady named Brooke Anders answers the ad, and she and Max come to like each other and start dating. At first, Tess and Emily don't like Brooke's son Ryan, but when he helps foil an elaborate scheme by Max's business manager Nigel to break up the romantic relationship between Max and Brooke (Nigel thinks Max's work will suffer as a result), the girls eventually accept him.

The family of twin sisters Maddie (Mary-Kate) and Abby (Ashley) Parker are placed in the FBI's Witness Protection Program after the girls witness a robbery at the local museum, in which the priceless Kneel Diamond is stolen. Unfortunately, the fourteen year old sisters have a problem of being blabbermouths; as a result, everywhere the Parkers are sent to live, the girls inadvertently end up revealing their witness status. A crime family led by a man by the name of Emil Hatchew (from the little-known nation of Yurugli) will do anything to get his hands on the diamond, which the thieves slipped into Abby's shoulder-bag during their escape from the crime scene. After the family has been moved to every geographic location around the world possible, with the single exception of Australia, the FBI sends them to live in Sydney.
