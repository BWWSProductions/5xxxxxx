There are 7 sets of characters
"".....*-....*-....*-....*-.....*-.....*-....""
First set indicates product code
Second set indicates product platform
Third set indicates product typecode
Fourth set indicates product feature code

Thus why the keygen always produces a key with F4M as the third set, since this is the commerical indicator.
F = Universal
B = FullFramework
L = GUI Framework
Z4M = Evaluation
R4M =     ""
Q4M =     ""
B4M =     ""

We want to fix our ""PlatformCode""

Say we have

YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY

For our platform to be set to ""ALLOS"" we can choose from:
XM
X9
XC
XU
XW

Our key would now look like this:
YYYY-XMYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY"
