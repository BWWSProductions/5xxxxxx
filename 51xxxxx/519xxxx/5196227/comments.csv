This game on my Wii, I tested them and it works perfectly!



Faith in the football world seems not to exist. Any player or coach swaps are now 'old' club very easy for a better paid job. Fortunately some Electronic Arts 'loyalty' means the developer and will continue every football season, a new edition of FIFA. Similarly, for the 2009-2010 season. FIFA 10 has, like its predecessors, again numerous tweaks to the game and enjoy the realism a big boost. The main features are as follows:

    * The KNVB and EA have finally agreed. As a result, the full selection of the Dutch national team after eight years absence at last part of FIFA 10.
    * Improved dribbling and collision system, allowing the player on the football field maneuvers easier. Moreover, this direct confrontation with an opponent less predictable.
    * The reaction of the players has expanded to approximately fifty movements, including making them even better position to choose, concentrate more on the ball and every action of their speed.
    * The player is able easily to the ball stop. He may also issue an accurate ball, making the receiver more time to such defense to escape.
    * A defensive player now gets all the stops. He used to sliding block moves to shrink and not even in return for a fuss to defend.
    * The AI of the goalie is underway. He is now faster and more dynamic. He also chooses a better position and wait for the right moment. He also has some new measures.
