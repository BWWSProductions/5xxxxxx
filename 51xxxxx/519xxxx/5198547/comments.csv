,yakoob247,2010-07-08T23:50Z,isnt the unrated version suppose to be like 153 mins? This one is just 132.
,PHREEBO,2010-09-17T00:56Z,"The audio is a little out of sync.
The video rip quality is as good as it get's for this size of x264/mkv, but the source looks like it was an R5 bootleg, so there you go. 
It's not ""Awesome Quality"", as I've seen better from MKVGuy in this size.
Tested on KMPlayer v2.9.4 & VLC 1.1.4
Thanks to all that contribute and keep it real."
