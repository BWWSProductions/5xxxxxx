,AzriAhmad,2009-12-12T20:16Z,"finally you showed up back, thanks"
,minclLess,2010-01-23T18:13Z,"Zemog, why did you resize the graphics? They're useless now in low quality... The whole point about this stuff is the high quality."
,minclLess,2010-01-23T19:13Z,"By resize, I meant include only low res..."
,Zemog,2010-03-01T14:48Z,"No, no I did not.
All are high-res."

,WulfsigeX,2010-05-03T04:23Z,Great torrent just wondering where the TV Noise FX is cause ive looked everywhere and cant find it...
,synchrotorrent,2010-05-11T22:07Z,Thanks for all your torrents. TV FX are missing from this one any chance of re-uploading? I would seed!
,Bobotec,2010-05-16T22:12Z,Where do i put the files on a mac?
,writersbloc,2010-05-18T21:06Z,"These can't be high res. Watching the 2nd tutorial and the first file Andrew grabs (Grunge_gray_09) is 3234x1654 on his screen, while the same file in this download is only 960x491. "
,Ariq,2010-06-19T18:13Z,"I've uploaded the DVD of Riot Gear folderwise on my blog:
http://video-copilot-tools.blogspot.com/
So you'll know what you're downloading."
,Palastorm,2010-06-30T23:44Z,"Thank you for uploading this, but i have a question these are free with their licenses or what? and also are you going to upload the 64-bit things?"
,birthdayboi,2010-07-27T20:07Z,"Zemog, I think you've uploaded the lite version. The version that many people are looking for is the original version which is I believe a little bit over 1GB. If it's not a bother, do you mind re-uploading it compressed, and untampered. I'm seeding all your uploads right now."
,Xenolith,2010-08-13T14:56Z,"just thank the person that he's giving it for free xD
thx Zemog!"

,EvilDeluxe,2010-10-07T03:09Z,"Have same question as fxixlx..

,dollaadministration,2011-05-14T21:27Z,can it be downloaded to a MAC??
,KunalAgg,2011-05-23T19:24Z,"This torrent is a total waste of time.. Zemog Bad work.
All video clips have been resized. There are no high resolution images.. Everything has been downsized. TV Noise elements have been missed out completely..
The original Riot Gear is 2GB+
I mean, this torrent is total SHIT.!!!
DO NOT download.!!!"
,thegamer8,2011-06-09T14:50Z,^^^ Buy the real one then genuis
,aqw212,2011-06-27T06:07Z,ATTENTION:: THIS TORRENT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME IT'S THE LITE VERSION. THE ORIGINAL IS 2GB+ ZEMOG I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THIS. I HAVE DOWNLOADED SOME OTHER TORRENTS THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND THEY TURNED OUT AWSOME.I GUESS I WILL THINK TWICE NEXT TIME I DOWNLOAD ANYTHING ELSE FROM U.
,shiranavs,2011-06-27T07:08Z,"plz use this for only learning.
If u use this for commercial, 
Plz buy it and support Andrew Kramer. 
cuz he brings more things for us and 
he think about us than the others.   "
,TugSy501,2011-09-19T14:40Z,its fake. if u goto the videocopilot website u can see that the real file is 2 GB this one is only 350MB
,1h2b3be,2012-03-05T00:47Z,"pretty good, but after downloading it i now see that you didnt include the HD textures or animations (they came in SD and HD, maybe this was the problem?)

i would say re upload it, - besides that this is a good torrent - ill save my up vote for when you re upload with the high res stuff, and TV noise which was not included.

(so its OK for a free riot gear, but some things (HD items, no tv noise) do make me a little annoyed."
,sdgdg,2012-05-13T08:09Z,goto after-effects-tools(.)blogspot(.)com for more downloads... :)
