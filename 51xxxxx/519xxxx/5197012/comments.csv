,otnemem,2011-06-17T11:52Z,"I still don't get what's supposed to be the email and what's supposed to be the product key.

The keygen actually gives a lot of text for ""serial number"" (not even ""product key"") and lets us enter a ""User Name"", not an Email.

How hard can it be for someone to actually say what goes where and how? "
,JD1215,2011-10-22T22:15Z,"Awesome. Just install and open the keygen and click Generate, then open the program and it'll work."
