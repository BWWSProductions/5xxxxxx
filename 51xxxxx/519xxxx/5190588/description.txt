Mothership is a compilation album by English rock group Led Zeppelin, released by
Atlantic Records and Rhino Entertainment on 12 November 2007 in the United
Kingdom, and 13 November 2007 in the United States. It was released on the
same day that Led Zeppelin's entire catalog became available in digital stores,
including the iTunes Store.The cover was created by artist Shepard Fairey.

The songs included were chosen by the surviving members of Led Zeppelin,
Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, and represent all eight of the
band's studio albums. In addition to a two-disc set, the album is also available in
both "deluxe" and "collector's" editions with a DVD featuring varied live content
from the previously released Led Zeppelin DVD. A 4-LP vinyl package was also
released on 26 August 2008.

On 8 November 2007, a temporary XM radio station, XM LED was made in order to
support the album. It was scheduled only to last six months, and ceased its
operations on 5 May 2008. The channel was actually dropped from the XM lineup
on 7 March 2008. It is now up and running again and features Led Zeppelin music
24/7...
