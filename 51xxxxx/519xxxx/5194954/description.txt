A companion to Rykodisc's budget-priced compilation Cheap Thrills, Son of Cheap Thrills ranges haphazardly over the many phases of Zappa's career, concentrating on briefer, more song-oriented material; although many of his varied musical sides are covered, the collection never quite jells into something cohesive. On the other hand, that task would be difficult enough for a full-fledged anthology of Zappa, let alone a budget sampler, so take it for what it is -- a cheaply priced introduction for the cash-strapped. Still, if you choose to acclimate yourself to Zappa this way, the first Cheap Thrills remains the better of the two, containing as it does a larger percentage of career high points.

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
