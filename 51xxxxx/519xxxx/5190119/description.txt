Release Notes:

The group, headed up by Kings Of Convenience singer and DJ-Kicks compiler Erlend Oye, started out as an electronic project before the members decided to strip things back to purely live instrumentation. After previously releasing their own unique brand of melancholic funk on Kitsune, Modular and Smalltown Supersound, the band have decided to put out their latest effort on their own fledgling Bubbles imprint.

The album will follow up their well received 2006 debut Dreams, and takes its title due to the fact that each and every track describes a different rule. No word yet if one of those rules is "make a hit single," but we do know that according to the band that this time around they've taken a more organic approach to recording, with all of the tracks being recorded live with no overdubs or additional effects.
