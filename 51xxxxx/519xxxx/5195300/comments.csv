,pirateman07,2009-12-30T01:07Z,do you know if you can get the hdcopy helper for windows 64bit bc the file is in 32bit
,cinesimon,2010-01-29T00:29Z,"The instructions are bizarre - could they be any muddier?
I really appreciate the upload, but for someone not used to this but fairly computer literate, I've tried to interpret the instructions many ways, and have had no success."
,cinesimon,2010-01-29T07:01Z,"Please I need some help. If anybody can help me understand the instructions to get this registration crack working, I would be most grateful.  
I've installed the software, but have no idea what the instructions mean after installation, to get the registration done: they're just too vague. 
I'll check back here in case anyone has posted a walk through for me. Again: I'd be most grateful: consider it your good deed for the day!"

,aucado54,2010-11-15T17:00Z,it seems i am not as computer literate as I think. I am unable to get the crack to work....perhaps it has been patched?
