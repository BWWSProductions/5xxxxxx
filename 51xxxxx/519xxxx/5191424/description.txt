                    Will.                                    
                    Will, is campaigning to become the disabled  
                    community's answer to Barack Obama. But on the  
                    island, the only person who is happy to listen  
                    to him banging on about disability politics is  
                    Dan, and he's starting to lose interest. It was  
                    the same story at home - ignored by most  
                    people, apart from his son Jake and he doesn't  
                    count. Right now the food is running out for  
                    the Cast Offs, but Will is insistent that they  
                    shouldn't ask for help. This is about proving a  
                    point that disabled people don't need    
                    assistance. Why can't the others agree with  
                    him? Elsewhere, romance may be blossoming  
                    between Dan and Carrie.
