White Lies are an alternative rock band from Ealing in West London, England. As Fear of Flying, Banquet Records described the band's second single as "Quite danceable indie", while The Guardian's official website named them an indie-pop band. In an interview with BBC London, they cited Talking Heads as a major influence. White Lies' more darker sound has been compared to Editors, Arcade Fire, Joy Division, Interpol, The Killers, Echo & the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears and The Teardrop Explodes. Lead singer McVeigh's singing voice has been compared to that of Ian Curtis and Julian Cope.
