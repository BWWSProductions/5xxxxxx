Campus is set in a fictitious 'new' university and explores the lives and souls of a handful of people that work there - some as academics, some simply involved in the general running of the place.

It is a fresh October morning, the beginning of the new academic year and Jonty de Wolfe, Vice Chancellor of Kirke University, tries to talk a troubled young student into committing suicide. Meanwhile, Jonty's dreams of dragging concrete Kirke up as far as red-brick status have recently received an unexpected boost, as one of his lecturers, Imogen Moffat, has written a popular maths bestseller. Underachieving English professor Matthew Beer is forced to collaborate with the introverted Imogen, but first has to deal with the fact that she is female, and therefore technically on his 'to do' list.

With a semi-improvised feel, Campus features an ensemble cast, and is made by the team behind Green Wing and Smack The Pony, including producer Victoria Pile.
