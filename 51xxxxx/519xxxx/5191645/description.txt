Want a complete Spanish learning kit that really immerses you in the learning? - If you really want to learn Spanish fast, then Rocket Spanish is for you. Rocket Spanish is primarily an MP3 audio course, with plenty of written material, and multimedia software in the form of 2 games. It is, in fact, a complete Spanish learning kit, and so can be considered as a Spanish "Immersion Course".

Rocket Spanish teaches you "interactively", in that the teacher will present some words or dialogue, along with itâ€™s meaning, and then ask you to say something, or ask you questions about what was said. It is very similar to the famous Pimsleur Courses, which makes the learning almost effortless. Whatâ€™s more, this technique of teaching makes it very easy to remember what you have learned - without endless repetition. The advantages that this course has over the Pimsleur course, is that you get Spanish that is more relevant to the way in which Latin American Spanish is really spoken today, plus you also get the games software and written material to round out your training.
