I downloaded it and extracted using winrar.

This File came with four folders:
-Rocket Spanish Bonus audio Lessons
-Rocket Spanish Learning Games
-Rocket Spanish Level 1
-Rocket Spanish Level 2

I opened the file ""Rocket Spanish Learning Games"" and extracted the file within the folder. Booted up the application and I was ready to go.

Thanks again 123dutch for sharing knowledge with world. "
