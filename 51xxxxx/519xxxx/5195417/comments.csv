,twistles,2009-12-04T22:38Z,"Unlike most of the bits I'm posting on TPB at the moment, this one is a new torrent (ie. not previously posted on 1337x).  Therefore owing to its size, and the fact that I'm trying to keep a few others alive at the same time, this is going quite slowly.  Will get there eventually ...

On this torrent especially, please be generous with seeding: having to keep this one alive until sufficient seeds will eat my bandwidth and I'll not be able to post as much new stuff for you all :)"
,twistles,2009-12-11T14:33Z,"I've been connected to 8 peers for about 18h.  They all have differing % complete, and their % have moved only by what I have uploaded to them.  Thus I'm connected to 8 leechers who will not share with each other.  Grats.  I've popped your IP ranges onto my blocklist, and will not hesitate to add others.

Quit this selfish behaviour.  If you want to download from me, help seed a bit.  I'm well aware that not everyone has the ability to provide upload bandwith.  But when I'm using 100% of mine to keep recent quality torrents alive due to a swarm full of people who are clearly giving nothing back at all, I cannot spend it uploading new items.  And that is to everyone's detriment."

So I'm going to give up supporting this torrent at the end of the month.   If you want it, grab it now before I delete it :)"
,MOVNGFWD,2010-02-01T14:08Z,"Thank you again, Twistles, for such excellent work!!!  I for one really appreciate all the efforts you put into these torrents!  

I have just moved this torrent (again!) from the ""queued seed"" category to ""Forced Seed""  (even though I now am at a 3 ratio...) to ensure that your hard work does not go to waste!  

:)"
,twistles,2010-02-02T01:42Z,"Much appreciated ! ^^  Got a few people grabbing atm, so I'm not binning it (quite) yet ...."
,twistles,2010-02-21T23:31Z,Nevermind that talk of binning.  Arranged for an acquaintance to keep this alive for a few months =)  Leech all you want.  I don't suppose he will be running out of bandwidth anytime soon.
