Ganre : Alternativ,gothic,new rock

Mad At The World was formed in 1987 in Southern California by brothers Roger and Randy Rose.

Few Christian bands have enjoyed the longevity and underground critical acclaim of Mad at the World (MATW).
From the day mailman and lead singer Roger Rose stuck a tape in a Frontline Records executive's
mailbox until current times, Mad at the World has turned heads with their provocative music.

The first, eponymous album featured a dance-style, synth/pop music. "Flowers In The Rain,
" their second, incorporated a slightly more goth-style sound and some guitars. Beginning with
their third disc, "Seasons Of Love," and in order to have a sound more amiable for live performances
since they toured the US extensively, the band's musical style shifted to hard rock for the next three albums.
The last two albums brought some member changes and a more 60's & 70's retro sounding style, relying
 heavily on psychedelia and power-pop.
