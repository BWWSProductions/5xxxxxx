Inspired by a true story, this family adventure features an all-star cast, including Don Johnson, Olympic-skating silver medalist Sasha Cohen, Lori Loughlin and Kay Panabaker. Life is a rough ride for awkward, friendless, 15-year-old Moondance (Panabaker). But when a Pinto pony named Checkers leaps into her life, Moondance pursues a dream she never knew she had. Convinced that Checkers has champion potential, she enters him in the Bow Valley Classic, and in the process learns only perseverance lands you in the winner's circle. Directed by Michael Damian, and featuring an irresistible soundtrack, Moondance Alexander is an uplifting story the whole family will enjoy.
