Now every time I play Flatout 2, Colin Macrae 2 or GTA4 the extra realistic physics engines are too much for me...

But arcade games are so addictive, especially when you can bling your ride like that."

I should be up and running again in about a month to 6 weeks, and will try to seed again.

Again, I'm sorry:("
