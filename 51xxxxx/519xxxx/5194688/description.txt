Need For Speed Most Wanted, Stand Alone (runs in Folder) with patched No DVD .exe

* I accidentally uploaded same '.torrent' as NFS Underground... Apologies all around.

------

For people that want to run Need For Speed Most Wanted along side Need For Speed Underground. (First game)

EXPLAINATION: Need for Speed Underground (The first game) and Need For Speed Most Wanted can't be installed at the same time in Windows because the main executable for both games are named the same i.e 'speed.exe' and try to share registry addresses.

By running the game out of its folder while not installing it (simple really) all this can be avoided.
