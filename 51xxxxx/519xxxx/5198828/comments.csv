I can't stand anything below that!"

[V],bubanee,2009-12-11T00:40Z,The Reason Why I Use VBR Is For A Location I'm Not Mentioning Here.. I Make 3 Versions Of All CDRips... VBR V0 V2 And Flac.... But Come Soon The Only Thing Thats Going To Be Provided To Public Sooner Than You Think Will Be V2.... and i said this before... there's nothing stopping you or anyone else to scan the pics and create a 320CBR.. here's a tip Klite Codec Pack and DBpoweramp.... or EAC if you like to play with settings... That's It

So many people are downloading and listening to this, but not coming to his defense? No messages about how ""he did his time,"" or ""the bitch probably deserved it.""  Interesting..."
