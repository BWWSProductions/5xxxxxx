For 56 years Prince Charles has been the king in waiting â€“ a wait that has surely been hard on him. Against the background of his wedding to Camilla the film examines his controversial ideas on architecture (nothing too modern, please), on medicine (coffee enemas and a diet of liquidised fruit) and on religion (flirting with Islam, Sikhism and regularly visiting the Greek orthodox monasteries on Mount Athos). Looking at the heir to the throne's difficult relationships with women, family and the public, we find out what makes Charles tick.
