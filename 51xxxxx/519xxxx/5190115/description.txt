The Illusion of Progress
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Released August 19, 2008
Recorded 2008 at the Home Studio of Frontman Aaron Lewis

The Illusion of Progress is the upcoming sixth studio album from Staind. It is slated for release on August 19, 2008. The Illusion of Progress was produced by Johnny K and recorded in the home studio of vocalist Aaron Lewis, with the original band line-up, including Mike Mushok (guitar), Jon Wysocki (drums, percussion) and Johnny April (bass, vocals).

Comments Lewis: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We went into the studio with the mindset of making our heaviest record yet, but the record that came out has flavors of Pink Floyd and straight-up blues. We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use the same rigs that we use onstage; we used all vintage guitars and amps, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pretty psyched about it! The songs are pretty timeless in their texture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The band calls the new project the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most musical CDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve recorded to date. [1]

To Promote the album Staind treated their fans to a series of intimate, behind-the-scenes Ã¢â‚¬Å“webisodesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ posted on staind.com, documenting their recording process. Staind also premiered the song "Believe" worldwide on U.S. station 987FM a.k.a. (Star 98.7). Staind also released the song, This Is It, on iTunes early as a single. "This Is It" was released as a downloadable track for the video game Rock Band on July 29 for the Xbox 360 and July 31 for Playstation 3.[2] You can listen to the album stream at hxxp://www.thefightnetwork.com/videos/?fr_chl=fc726ac9d16ba2802eaa2aeae37c769aed49e852&rf=bm
