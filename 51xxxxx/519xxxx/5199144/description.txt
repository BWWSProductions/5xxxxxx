Excerpt from onelove.com.au:

Itâ€™s that sun-drenched time of year again, and ONELOVE's massive 3 disc release MOBILE DISCO is back for 2010. Summer, festivals, sand, surf â€¦ all the things that we are proud to call Summertime in Australia are right on our doorsteps, and this year the best DJ's in the world are playing at your party! Onelove welcomes John Dahlback, the Bang Gang Deejays & Andy Murphy up to the decks to deliver the sounds to drive around town with the sunroof open, and to keep the beach house bouncing all summer long.

MOBILE DISCO 2010 isnâ€™t short on the stand out party soundtracks either, featuring tracks and remixes from the best in the biz including Martin Solveig, Dragonette, Calvin Harris, The Gossip, Armand Van Helden, A-Trak, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Eric Morillo, Fedde Le Grand & more.

Melbourne DJ Andy Murphy leads the charge with disc 1 and a huge 19 tracks to get the party started. This is where itâ€™s at people! The #1 House DJ in Australia (In The Mix awards) was asked to mix the inaugural â€œOnelove â€“ Smash Your Stereoâ€ compilations in both 2007 and again earlier this year â€“ both CDâ€™s being an absolute smash and setting many a party rocking!

Disc 2 comes to us courtesy of 22 year old Swedish DJ & label owner John Dahlback. At 20 years of age John launched his imprint Pickadoll, and what an imprint with artists such as Sebastien Leger, Dada Life, Zoo Brazil, Robbie Rivera, Laidback Luke.  Get up and get dancing music lovers: this oneâ€™s for you. â€œI love to play for dancing people, to really see them loving the tunes. And I love to make the tunes that get them dancing,â€ says Dahlback.

The Bang Gang Deejays bring it all home on the final disc in the mix and itâ€™s in these early hours of the morning, after the night before, when theyâ€™ll take you on a trip to another dimension. From crafting perfect parties in dugout basements in Sydney, to their legendary dance floor status, Doom & Hoodrat never disappoint. Our promise to you â€“ itâ€™ll be a spiritual experience!

You can catch Andy Murphy, John Dahlback and Doom & Hoodrat (aka Bang Gang Deejays) whip the crowds into a sweaty frenzy under the blazing Aussie sun at the upcoming Stereosonic Festivals around the country this November, and then you can continue the party in your own backyard, warehouse or bedroom with Mobile Disco 2010.
