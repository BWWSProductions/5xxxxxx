,DiGiTaLdIsCiPlE,2009-12-04T06:50Z,"For some reason I had to extract every single .rar file before it would let me unpack the first file. 

Enjoy!"
,genesi_mmorpg,2009-12-04T21:49Z,Thank you so much! I have been waiting for this one!
,jakemakesfun,2009-12-09T16:28Z,doesn't work.
,jrkreye,2009-12-10T13:09Z,well this one works for me. thanks DiGiTaL!
,Foxx64,2009-12-10T19:02Z,"Hm, I don't know why you people are being dumb-asses.  This works just fine.  All you have to do is extract 1 file, mount it to a virtual drive (Like Daemon Lite (Free) or my preference, MagicDisc (Also free)) or burn it to a cd, once there, hit auto run and tada.  Works like a charm.  Don't care too much for the game, I like having more control over the fleet's actions, but it's fun if you like watching ships get blown to pieces in 2D.  Great upload, you get a +1 from me, was looking for this thing, now RIP has to get the expansion out."
,Foxx64,2009-12-10T19:04Z,"Tired of people just coming in and saying first thing that something doesn't work.  Makes the torrent less likely to be used, especially with so few comments.  Learn how to actual use the things you download before you assume they don't work."
,jakemakesfun,2009-12-10T20:14Z,"I did all that, and the actual EXE does not work, it complains about missing files. So stop acting like you know everything.
I'm trying to save people from wasting time downloading a crack that does not work."
,PhasmaFelis,2009-12-16T09:23Z,"Jake, it helps if you at least say what the error is, instead of just ""doesn't work"". The actual error in full, not just ""complains about missing files""."
,pygmis,2009-12-17T22:48Z,"This game is pretty simple and the UI is clumsy.  You are limited to very basic commands, and also the game crashes often. Update would fix some of them but thats not for torrented version."
,DiGiTaLdIsCiPlE,2009-12-20T09:29Z,"Sorry if you couldn't figure this out on your own. I downloaded the file from a non torrent site and then reuploaded the folder as is (I probably should have made it easier to install but I didn't think of it at the time).

If you are having issues and it tells you that a file is missing you need to extract from EVERY archive in the folder. You will end up with a bunch of unl-gbxx.Rxx files and one archive named unl-gsbr.rar. 

Once all the other archives are extracted you can go ahead and extract unl-gsbr.rar and it wont give you missing file errors.

This is my first upload so don't hate ;-)"
,3261dan,2009-12-21T00:48Z,"Thanks for this Digital, I find myself strangely addicted to this simple game, its great. Also worked without a fuss."
,Toriad,2009-12-29T05:31Z,"Could someone give me exact instructions to make this work? Every time I attempt to start the game is says ""error Missing d3dx9_41.dll. Reinstallation could fix the problem"""
,Alzarath,2010-01-06T00:37Z,"Works, fun game. But (on windows 7) the screen becomes windowed and turns black when I minimize and restore it. I'll have to look into this."
,Alzarath,2010-01-06T00:39Z,"@Toriad
Download DirectX9, that should hopefully help. If it doesn't, try downloading this: 
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_41
and put it in the installation folder."
,brettv,2010-01-06T05:35Z,"Works fine for me, thanks."
,N00batTorrents,2010-02-13T19:20Z,"I still don't get it. I got uTorrent, I downloaded the file using uTorrent, 100% But still I can't figure out how to play it. I don't know what to extract, where it is or anything. I clicked on every file that was downloaded and nothing. Kinda pissing me off. Please help."
,Blaze200038,2010-02-21T14:54Z,"I tried the above suggestions, every time I tried to open the exe it came up with ""Failed to find race:..\src\SIM_Race.cpp"""
,Gui-God,2010-03-05T17:50Z,"ok Not this is weird, i extracted it, did everything and it worked. next day i tried it and got ""Ship Hull not found ->:..\src\SIM_ShipHull.cpp 488""

what exactly in the  fuck happened?"
