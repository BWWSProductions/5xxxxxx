,SonGoku7,2010-01-07T04:01Z,that's the weird part im looking at all my episodes and i must be missing one because i only have 9 episodes and ive been getting them in order but there should actually be 10 so im not exactly sure what's going on
,oldschool101,2010-01-08T05:35Z,Technically... he's correct. Episode 1&2 was the season premiere. Even the torrent files you all have downloaded in the past for House have stated this.
