For parents everywhere who have had lovely family dinners ruined by misbehaving children, help is at hand. This guide provides a humorous, hands-on, parent-friendly approach to teaching children of all ages good manners in a wide variety of social situations, from accepting gifts graciously to which foods are OK to eat with fingers. Each chapter tackles a different situation, gives a brief outline of what manners are appropriate for it, and offers advice on how to teach and reinforce them to children of different ages. There is also a "What to Expect" chart broken down by age, and a Q & A section devoted to questions concerning children and manners.
