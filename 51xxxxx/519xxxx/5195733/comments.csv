AFAIK Ergo Proxy was never released in HD. (only released on DVD) If its the same rip I opened before you'll find this is larger but no more detailed than the [Arigatou] dvd rip which is Dual Audio. Most likely this was pulled off an HD channel which was upscaling content like they usually do..."

,poliak9,2010-12-26T22:24Z,"but sometime they do ""something "" :D like with Toy story or monsters inc, so it was bad quality and they make full hd from it... but i dont know.. i'll download it and post it here ;)"

Toy Story was a movie shown in theaters. It was Higher Definition than any tv on the market to begin with.

@poliak9 
Do you not understand what ""Up Scale"" means? All they did was take 480 lines of resolution and stretch them to make 720 lines of resolution. You don't gain a thing.

(Shame they will not see this late post.)"
,sarah1133,2012-05-20T20:37Z,"Television shows are not produced at DVD quality. Recordings from HDTV airings will be substantially quality than rips from the DVD: it's not just interpolation. They get higher-quality video directly from the studios.

I actually downloaded both versions, and this one has dramatically better video. However, it has hard English subs and no English audio (not surprising since it was ripped from HDTV).

If you want Japanese audio + subs, this is the one you want, without a doubt."
