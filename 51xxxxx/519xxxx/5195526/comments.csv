there is a problem. I cant keep seeding 24/7 .... there is power cut problems in this part of the world.

But whenever I can I'll seed. So If you are downloading... and suddenly it stops...plz don't be disappointed. I'll start seeding asap after some time. So be back.

,Deznaj,2009-12-11T11:15Z,"OK...

3 Days now without any seeding. I do appriciate the effort, but in the end it's like this:

IF YOU CAN'T SEED, DON'T UPLOAD ANY TORRENTS!!!

No matter what the reason, you obviously can't seed your torrent. It's extremely frustrating to wait days or even weeks before a relatively small torrent is completed. You are better off letting someone else seed for you."
