,genghis_mom,2009-12-06T20:52Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I can't get mine to work. I followed the instructions, but it still wants me to register it. =("
,cinesimon,2010-01-28T23:46Z,"Me, too - the crack instructions are senseless - I did what was described in the tiny set of instructions, yet no registration, no list of cracks, nothing. 
But thanks for the effort."
,cinesimon,2010-01-29T07:00Z,"Please I need some help. If anybody can help me understand the instructions to get this registration crack working, I would be most grateful.  
I've installed the software, but have no idea what the instructions mean: they're just too vague. I'll check back here i case anyone has posted a walk through for me. Again: I'd be most grateful: consider it your good deed for the day!"
