,blombardo,2010-01-22T21:40Z,Thank you; I'm downloading it now.  Only 3 seeds available so it will be about a 4 day wait... lol  I was hoping to find a smaller version that Worked... - one with English only  (no french - half the size right there) - and maybe with no huge tutorial files (just the game) - there was one 200mb version available for the 10th edition (but it failed to work) Maybe Mayuran would be interested in posting a tiny version of this game for us all as well... - I'll post the results after i get it all.
,Mayuran30,2010-01-25T00:15Z,"Hello dear Blombardo, Thank you for downloading. if you want Only the English Version of CMGME. Then i can Post a torrent for you. I am not gonna publish this torrent on TPB, Since my upload speed is very low. It took the others about 2 weeks to download the game. anyway as per request i am ready to post another torrent which has the English Version only. its capacity is about 1.95 GB. so if you are patience enough because its gonna take at least a week for you to download. Also i am unable to suppress the Tutorials since i don't know how to do that. So please let me know if you are still interested then i'll post a new torrent for the English Version of this."
