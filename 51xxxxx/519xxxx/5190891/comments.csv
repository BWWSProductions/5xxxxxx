He produceth creation, then reproduceth it, that He may reward those who believe and do good works with equity; while, as for those who disbelieve, theirs will be a boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved. (Qur'an 10/4) 
If you want to know how to enter Paradise or how to saved from Hell, we suggest you to read the Qur?an. The Book, which is sent you by the Creator of the Universe will show you the way of salvation."
