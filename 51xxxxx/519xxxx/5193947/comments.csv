Allthough they have made a lot of really cool effects and the quality is good I still think its 2h 31min of american propaganda.

I do have two complaints though.  The title cards saying places, and such were in Russian, and there were no subtitles for when they were speaking in other languages.  So there's about thirty minutes of the movie that I don't know what they said.

Is there any way to get subtitles over those parts?

Otherwise, awesome.

I usually don't like the big Hollywood special effects orgies, but this one really works. Not because of the story or the acting but because it never gives you time to think about whats happening, it just pounds you with action over and over.
Plus Woody Harrelson does a great job.

,Dramat,2009-12-09T13:30Z,"A word to j4m3s:
Man you are really primitive. What changes color of the skins? It is clear to me that you are full of hate. The point is do you realize to whom this hate is directed - you think it's pointed against black people, but it isn't. True is that you hate yourself and you evidently have problems with yourself. 
Best thing you can do is go to the psychologist and share with him your fears and all those bad feelings you have inside. Do it, or in near future you will hurt someone because of this hate and you will go to the prison. Remember, crimes made because of hate is punished with much higher sentences (at least in US).

,ThePalindorme,2009-12-13T10:30Z,"This is an R5. I dont know exactly what it is, but its like a print released for theatrical distribution in the region 5 described by MPAA, i.e middle to southeast asia.
It has excellent quality but has no audio(mostly the dialouges), to enable dubbing in different language. So audio is taken from a dvdscreener(the print shown to critics) and synced with the R5. The dvdscreener itself does not have that good quality audio, and also produces problems with synching. The result you get is mostly like this movie. 

Audio a little out of synch by the middle to end, a little means a little, and except for the most demanding assholes, its fine. I didnt even notice it, until i read about it in another comment.
Video is 100% great, as expected.No problems.
Some may say waiting for another rip with synced audio, but why wait so long for such a terrible movie.
This movie is just a onetime watch. Marvel at the special effects and laugh at the presentation.
Download, watch , laugh, curse, delete.
Thats what i am gonna do.
Worth the complete download.

The video is ok, but pixelated and too much contrast, and missing subtitles for non-english parts and the audio is quite bad. In what POSSIBLE realm does that qualify for 10/10? I would say V6/A3, and wait for a proper DVD rip. This is some kind of Russian R5 test/pre-screener."

,iiiratep,2010-02-26T13:28Z,"Excellent video quality, although the audio is pretty poor. The one problem is that all the text is in Russian, and there are no translation subtitles. There were several scenes spoken in other languages that you might not understand. If you search ""2012 movie script"" you can just read the script to figure out what's going on during those parts. :]"
,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:53Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.
And thanks to all the up loaders like extremezone w/out people like them, none of this would be possible!"
