,BasilBrush,2009-12-03T02:35Z,The left and right could be cropped to 992x576 to remove the ugly black bars or alternatively the top and bottom could be cropped as well to maintain a 16/9 aspect ratio but with a small aspect error. I decided to do nothing and leave the image as it would normally appear.
