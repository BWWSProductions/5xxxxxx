    Magic Pyramid is a color matching puzzle game, where you have to      
    place colored pyramids onto a table and try to match the color of a   
    border line by rotating and unfolding these pyramids.                 
                                                                          
    It sounds easier, than it is, because you have to deal with bombs     
    as well, which have an influence on the colors of the table.          
                                                                          
    Magic Pyramid differs from the many other color matching games in     
    its level of difficulty and it is targeted to the ambitious           
    audience.                                                             
    The key features are:                                                 
                                                                          
    - 100 levels with constantly raising severity                         
    - Online High Score                                                   
    - Resumable gameplay                                                  
    - Regular updates                                                     
                                                                          
    You have to rearrange the differently colored pyramids on a 7x7       
    table by using the pyramids from the street on the top. You should    
    place the pyramids from top to bottom, to match the white bordered    
    colors. All the pyramids wich is at the border must be the same       
    color. You can view the border the correct and the bad colored        
    section. If you placed the pyramids at the border, you win and you    
    can view your statistic. If you leave from the game, then come back   
    , the game will continue. If you finished all the 100 levels, your    
    score will be saved to your device and if you have internet           
    connection, your score will be uploded to the server. You can set     
    the volume, and go to the messagewall in the setup. http://
