,jpcooper,2010-03-05T19:28Z,Thank you for making this available. Do you have the recorder sonata in F Major?
,twistles,2010-03-08T13:38Z,"I have two sonatas in F (TWV 41:F2, TWV.43:F1) and two trio sonatas in F (TWV 42:F15, TWV 42:F8).  Let me know which you are after, and I'll post the CD later this week.

The recorder suite on this CD is also available in what is, imo, a more ""authentic"" version on the Hyperion label : http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDH55091"
