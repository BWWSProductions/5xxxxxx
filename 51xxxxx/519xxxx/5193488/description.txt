"If You See Him/If You See Her" is the title of a song released in 1998 by American country music artist Reba McEntire, along with the duo Brooks & Dunn. It served as the title track to each artist's respective 1998 albums (If You See Him for Reba, and If You See Her for Brooks & Dunn), both released on June 2 of that year.[1] The song was concurrently promoted and distributed by both artists' labels: MCA Nashville and Arista Nashville, then the respective labels for McEntire and Brooks & Dunn.

It is a ballad, alternating McEntire's vocals with those of Ronnie Dunn (one half of the duo), while Kix Brooks (the other half) provides harmony vocals on the verses sung by Dunn. McEntire and Brooks & Dunn debuted the song at the Academy of Country Music awards in 1998.
