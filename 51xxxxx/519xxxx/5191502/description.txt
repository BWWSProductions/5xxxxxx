Shirley Bassey BBC Imagine TV series (November 2009) http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007ght1
57mins.

Alan Yentob gains exclusive access and insight into the creative world of Dame Shirley. After a triumphant Glastonbury appearance and a major illness, at 72, Dame Shirley Bassey, one of our greatest singers, tentatively re-enters the ring to confront her life in song.

Some of the best contemporary songwriters, including Gary Barlow, the Pet Shop Boys, Manic Street Preachers, Rufus Wainwright, Richard Hawley and KT Tunstall, along with the famous Bond composer John Barry and lyricist Don Black, have interpreted her life through song for a new album produced by David Arnold. The songs frame and explore the myth of Shirley Bassey, the girl from Tiger Bay, and the voice and the desire are not found wanting! A back story profiling Shirley, complete with archive of her greatest performances, tells the story of what makes Dame Shirley Bassey the living legend that she is today.

Don't get too excited, this is the full ITV concert but it's at a very small resolution. Cool if you watch it on a phone or5 years ago maybe. Can someone help with a higher resolution version?

I hope DSB fans are enjoying my sharing of these great performances and documentaries. 

Keep sharing this file once you get it on your machine so others can enjoy it.


All tested and working with VLC http://www.videolan.org Use that to play the Flash video of Another Audience with Shirley Bassey (2006).
