Basically the same"
,juliepac,2009-12-24T17:52Z,"Hey!!! It's not the same. Don't insult the language. The pronunciation is different and there's a bunch of words different, too."
,Peanut-Lover,2010-01-12T21:52Z,"No, of course, there is indeed a big difference. The use of the vosotros form (you, informal, plural) is not even present in Latin America, and the stresses vary. There's some vocabulary replaced in Spain vs. L.A.

,juliepac,2010-02-01T21:33Z,"Hi Peanut-lover,

Thanks for the help, and indeed great torrent you recommended. But I'm looking for the AUDIO COMPANION. The course I already have.
But, great torrent, so thanks."
,barvoet,2010-03-07T15:26Z,"Well, there are some differences, but I don't know really what they mean by south american spain, it sounds mexican, rather than argentine or cuban. 
Anyway, I would just study the spanish version in case you wanted to go to spain, and liten to the american audio companion to broaden your knowledge. Rosetta stone, at least up to level 3 does not contain natural speach anyway, it is just a tool to start."
