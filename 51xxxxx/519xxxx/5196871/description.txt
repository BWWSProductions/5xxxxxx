    GroupDrive Collaboration Suite                                     
                                                                       
    GroupDrive is a business-class file and document collaboration     
    product. Businesses can use GroupDrive to securely collaborate     
    over the Internet without the inherent problems of e-mailing       
    attachments. Because your files are stored in a central location,  
    users always have the most current version of a document. The      
    GroupDrive Server provides secure file storage and backup for      
    your important business files and documents.                       
                                                                       
    With easy file sharing and real-time document collaboration,       
    GroupDrive gives your team a secure private business network that  
    lets you work at the speed of business.                            
                                                                       
    The GroupDrive Collaboration Suite consists of 3 components:       
                                                                       
    * GroupDrive Server - a secure WebDAV server for storing and       
      collaborating on files. GroupDrive uses WebDAV over SSL.         
    * GroupDrive Client - Virtual drive connection to the GroupDrive   
      server enables users access and save files from within any       
      Windows application.                                             
    * GroupDrive Web Interface - A simple and intuitive interface      
      that allows users to store and collaborate on documents from     
      any machine with a Web browser and Internet access.              
                                                                       
    Access Your Files From Anywhere                                    
                                                                       
    GroupDrive provides simple access to your files, from anywhere,    
    at any time. The GroupDrive Server sits between the Internet and   
    your data and provides a central, secure method to access your     
    files from outside the corporate network. Remote workers can       
    access and share corporate information without expensive VPNs or   
    remote access software. Students benefit by having access to       
    class files and assignments, even while off campus. GroupDrive     
    integrates with existing user authentication servers allowing a    
    single secure sign-on implementation. Users can access their data  
    using any Web browser, or for added functionality, by using our    
    exclusive GroupDrive Virtual Drive technology for Windows.         
                                                                       
    Share Documents Easily                                             
                                                                       
    Users can easily create shared workspaces. The creator of the      
    workspace can define the actions that other users can take on the  
    documents and folders in the workspace. Documents can also be      
    shared with customers and partners outside of your organization    
    by sending QuickLinks rather than bulky e-mail attachments.        
    Keep Important Files Secure                                        
                                                                       
    GroupDrive supports encrypted sessions using industry proven SSL   
    (Secure Sockets Layer), to secure your critical business           
    documents. GroupDrive also has support for third-party client      
    certificates, ensuring that your users are being authenticated     
    prior to access being granted to the GroupDrive server.            
    Reduce Training and Support Costs                                  
                                                                       
    Because GroupDrive is so easy to use, the cost of training is      
    greatly reduced. Your users can access, edit, and share documents  
    through a mapped drive letter  the same way that they access      
    files on their own computers. Users also have the option of using  
    an intuitive browser interface, allowing them secure access to     
    documents from any computer.                                       
                                                                       
    GroupDrive offers the most mature drive-mapping technology on the  
    market, a robust and secure WebDAV server and the convenience and  
    simplicity of a well-designed Web interface.                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
    Advanced Features...                                               
                                                                       
    - SSL Support - GroupDrive has built-in SSL (Secure Sockets Layer  
      protocol) support, ensuring that all traffic between the         
      GroupDrive Server and client is secure. Includes SSL             
      certificate support including support for third-party            
      Certificate Authorities such as Verisign and Entrust.            
    - Supports SRT's DMZedge Server - Reduce the risk of network       
      intrusion without having to keep copies of your confidential     
      business files outside of your firewall. DMZedge allows you to   
      close all inbound ports in your firewall - GroupDrive will open  
      outbound ports to the DMZedge Server, which will send user       
      requests as a response on the outbound channel.                  
    - Encrypted File System - When used in conjunction with an NTFS    
      file system and Active Directory server, GroupDrive supports     
      encrypted file storage, ensuring your files are safe.            
    - Folder Quotas - By establishing quotas on any given folder,      
      users can regulate the amount of space that can be used by       
      other users in a collaborative setting.                          
    - Cross-platform Access - Access your GroupDrive from anywhere,    
      anytime, from any Windows, MAC OS/X, Classic Mac 9, UNIX, or     
      Linux desktop.                                                   
    - NT Authentication - GroupDrive can be seamlessly integrated      
      into an existing Windows NT, Active Directory, or LDAP server.   
      Adding GroupDrive instantly adds full collaboration to the       
      entire domain.                                                   
    - Web Browser Interface - Users have anywhere, anytime access to   
      their files. Using any browser, users can view, share, edit, or  
      e-mail files.                                                    
    - Windows Drive Mapping Client - South River Technologies          
      pioneered the concept of Internet drive mapping, enabling file   
      access and collaboration as easily as accessing files on the     
      local PC. GroupDrive lets you collaborate from the familiar      
      Windows Explorer interface or from within the applications that  
      you use every day.                                               
    - Optional Public Access - With the optional GroupDrive Public     
      Connector Pack, users are able to share a file or folder with    
      the general public providing non-GroupDrive users access to      
      their shared information.                                        
    - Block Level Locking (SimulShare) - GroupDrive provides block     
      level locking when files are being edited. This enables          
      multiple users to collaborate in real-time, without getting      
      locked out of a file, and without overwriting another users      
      changes.
