   With version 4, KONTAKT enhances its position as the professionals sampler 
   of choice. Building on the  outstanding features of the previous  versions, 
   including  the  unrivaled audio  engine  and state-of-the-art  semi-modular 
   architecture, KONTAKT  4 delivers  new sonic  horizons for  your music.  An 
   expanded sound collection connects you to an immense number of instruments, 
   and the new Authentic Expression  Technology (AET)* is at the  cutting-edge 
   of dynamic and true instrument simulation.  
             
   KONTAKT 4 offers endless possibilities  to really get inside your  samples. 
   You can  easily edit,  loop, slice  and time-stretch  your sounds and pitch 
   shift them in real time or  tempo-sync them with the powerful Wave  Editor. 
   Draw your own custom envelopes directly into the sample waveform to  easily 
   and  precisely modulate  any parameter,  or use  step sequencers  and flex 
   envelopes to tweak your samples. Refine your sound even further with any of 
   the 19 versatile studio-quality effects such as the convolution effect  for 
   super-realistic reverbs, or  use the powerful  surround sound features  for 
   cinematic productions.
