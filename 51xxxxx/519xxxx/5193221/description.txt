Fearne Cotton - Wednesday 2nd December 2009 - Lily Allen in the Live Lounge


Lily Allen came into the Live Lounge and performed her new single Who'd Have Known and covered Oasis' I'm Outta Time.

She's got a sore throat , which she puts down to working too hard and too many gigs. Lily announced that she's going to take a year or so off from writing and touring.

Lily's looking at diversifying!  She's going to work with her sister to start a new shop where you can hire the latest in fashion without having to pay celeb-type prices. She's also going to look into signing new bands.

She explained why her single sounds so similar to Take That's 'Shine': neither of them had heard 'Shine' when they banged out the initial chords. The moment of realisation came when the track was delivered to the record company. So she phoned Take That and checked that they were ok with it.
