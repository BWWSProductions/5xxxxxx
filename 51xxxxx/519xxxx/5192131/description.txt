Release Notes:

It's time to dust off the vinyl and take your air guitar out of storage because
Small Stone is proud to present â€œSucking the 70â€™s, Back In The Saddle Again.â€ No
expense was spared for this one kiddies. We scoured several continents to find
the best and most ass kicking bands to pay homage to the greatest decade that
rock and roll has ever known.

Let's get this straight right up front, these aren't covers. We sifted through a
lot of bands simply covering their favorite jams and you won't find any of them
here. In the end we cut this baby off with 31 tracks and a waiting list a mile
long to get in. What you will find on â€œSucking the 70â€™sâ€ are some of the best
and most true to life rawk bands of the 21st century lovingly re-working,
re-interpreting, and in some cases re-defining the music that first inspired
them to make music in the first place.

From the ferocious opening blast of Sasquatch's incredible revamping of Grand
Funk Railroad's classic "Are You Ready" through the final breaths of Valis'
psychedelic re-invention of Gary Wright's â€œDream Weaverâ€, â€œSucking the 70â€™sâ€ is
a rollercoaster ride through the classics that defined a decade. Itâ€™s an aural
trip down memory lane back to the good old days when Rock & Roll actually stood
for something. These two discs feature Small Stone alumni both past and present
as well as some of our favorite acts ever. And whatever you do donâ€™t miss out on
the incredible first ever recordings of Five Horse Johnson with Clutch. It is
unbelieveable.

So, break out your lava lamps and lay some carpet down in the back of your SUV
because the 70â€™s are back with a vengeance. This is an incredibly limited
pressing and when itâ€™s gone itâ€™s gone, so youâ€™d better get it while you can.
Operators are standing by. Eight track version not available. Stairway not
included. Void in Kansas, Chicago & where ever the hell the Bay City Roller's
are from.
