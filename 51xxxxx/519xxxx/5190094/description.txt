"But for the Grace of God" is a song performed and recorded by country music performer Keith Urban. The song was written by Urban, Charlotte Caffey, and Jane Wiedlin.

The third single release from his album Keith Urban, "But for the Grace of God" became Urban's first No. 1 single on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart on February 24, 2001; the song spent one week at No. 1. The song also includes a video, which has aired on CMT and GAC.

When "But for the Grace of God" reached No. 1, it marked the first time that non-American artists had back-to-back chart-topping songs; the song replaced "There Is No Arizona" by Jamie O'Neal, and both artists are Australian.

Both radio-edit and album-length versions have been issued. The radio edit excises a musical bridge after the second chorus and has a slightly different ending than the album cut.

Keith Urban is the second solo album by Australian country singer Keith Urban , released on October 19, 1999.

Certified platinum in the United States, the album was Urban's breakthrough album in that country. Prior to this album, he had recorded a self-titled album in Australia in 1991, and another in the U.S. as a member of the short-lived band The Ranch. Keith Urban produced four singles for Urban on the Billboard country charts. In order of release, these were: "It's a Love Thing" (#18), "Your Everything" (#4), "But for the Grace of God" (#1), and "Where the Blacktop Ends" (#3). "A Little Luck of Our Own" was originally titled "Luck Of Our Own" and recorded by singer-songwriter Dale Daniel on her 1994 album Luck Of Our Own.
