,h3ll4b0y,2009-12-02T16:17Z,"hey bro, ive got ATI too (ATI HD 4650) and it works fine but there are some minor bugs tho 
oh and i have vista SP1 too so that shouldnt be the problem"
,roxspyder,2009-12-03T11:13Z,"WTF????? Quad Core running at 2.8 GHz or equivalent Yeah, think theres a typo there.  Only 6 gig, there cant be that good enough grapics to have to have a quad core to run.
Anybody else on TPB getting massive amounts of popups on TPB?? I got them coming out of my ass, Feels like TPB is getting more like Sumotorrent and the others. I mean they gotta pay for the servers and crap, but I turned off my popup blocker for fun and had 8 popups come up just on this page alone. WTF?????? I need a better popup blocker.
Oh yeah, I forgot to say THANX A MILLION EXTREMEZONE!!!!!"
,njord777,2009-12-03T11:50Z,"Some people CAN'T change resolution no matter what!

Like ME;
If i press Videosetup.exe NOTHING happens at all.
Same if i press SaboteurLauncher.exe,then i get;

Play
Option
Support
Readme
Quit

I can press ALL exept options...If i hit option,NOTHING happens at all!!!

And yea,i have updated drivers."
,suisenbenjo,2009-12-03T18:56Z,"@roxyspyder

It's not a typo - those are the same specs posted everywhere though 2.8 quad-core is definitely not required at all. I don't see your reasoning on it being 6GB therefore not having high requirements... the size of the game has jack shit to do with the resources used or the overall quality of the graphics... crysis is only about 6GB and is still one of the most graphically intensive games out."

Once installed move everything from the crack folder into your game's installation directory, which by default is C:Program FilesElectronic ArtsThe Saboteur. Once it's cracked, play, and have fun! Hope this helped you, or any one else."
