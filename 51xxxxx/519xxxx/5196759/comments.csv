,JONNIE-RR,2009-12-06T05:44Z,"obviously its ok if theres 66 seeders. I dont upload crap. Try google people. Windows 7 themes.. Its a 12 mb download, some people might like it others might not, its all down to preference. It'll take a few minutes to download, if u dont like it delete it. Your welcome"

Its really exclusive because constructors put its 

own theme only in a new PC,

and I think:It was for netbook because the 

resolution of these wallpapers are 1280x960..."
