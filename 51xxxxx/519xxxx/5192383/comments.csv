,4rror,2009-12-02T20:46Z,"Seems a bit large for an antivirus...
Also, what exact version is this?"
,Shazad,2009-12-02T20:50Z,Both X86 an 64 bit. Sorry this is the server version and client version in two separate installs all clean and virus free. Manuals are included.
,Shazad,2009-12-03T15:09Z,Comments are welcome.
,gordy99,2009-12-03T17:50Z,"You really did not answer the question at to what version this is.  Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0.5002.333 client is the latest I have & is available on this site already.  So, what is yours?"
,Shazad,2009-12-04T00:58Z,"Its ver. 11.0.2000.1253 with server management and deploy installations, hence the reason it clocks at 565 mb. So it's older than yours"
