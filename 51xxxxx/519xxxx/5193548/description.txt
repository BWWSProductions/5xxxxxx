A beautiful and touching story about the relationship between two sisters, Mary (Jena Malone), a terminally ill but resilient fifteen year old and Penny (Mary Stuart Masterson), a jaded ex-poet who doesn't believe in her sister's magical vision of life. It is up to Mary to believe for both of them, giving shape to their dreams in the beautiful and mystical volume she keeps in her "Book of Stars and Lovely Things."

Through this book, and with the help of her new next door neighbor (Karl Geary), the Professor (Delroy Lindo) and the prisoner (D.B. Sweeney) who has been writing to Penny, Mary hopes she can build a bridge from Penny's past to a more hopeful future.
