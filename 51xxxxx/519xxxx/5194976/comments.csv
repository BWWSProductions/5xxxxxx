this is clean scene release. No virus and this is a AVI file. so from where virus came from ?

Enjoy clean release."
,Dronegan,2009-12-04T00:08Z,"Does this upload include the last 2 semifinal fights?

Since the upload by the other guy of same episode contained the first 2 semifinal fights. But on mma-tracker there is episode 12 up with last 2 fights. Since im not a member there i cant download from there.

So can anyone confirm this?"

Not got watching it all yet, but 1/2 way through and the 1/4 finals are finished so looks like semis are included"
