I've Just stared downloading your season 1 torrent, then will DL this one once I've finished seeding season 1 back. I for one hope you have the time and inclination (sp?) to upload all 7 seasons.

Thanks again for sharing."
,ginaverduijn,2009-12-12T15:18Z,pls seed there are no seeders :''(
,GrrArgh,2009-12-13T06:07Z,"ginaverduijn, I don't know what you are talking about, i just completed downloading this and there were always seeds, counting me there are currently 9 seeds on this. Even when i wasn't actively connected to a seed i still got decent download speed because of the distribution across the peers.
 I averaged 71 KB/s, which on my dsl is pretty good for any torrent.
As long as i have this comment window open, I'll say thanks again for this and the other BtVS uploads, I'm half way thru watching the season 1 rip from this uploader and they all look amazing so far. "
,GrrArgh,2009-12-18T10:20Z,"greetings, I've just begun to watch
Buffy.The.Vampire.Slayer.S02E10.AC3.DVDRip.x264-iND which should be Episode 10: What's My Line?: Part 2, but it appears to be a duplicated encode of
Episode 9: What's My Line?: Part 1. If the uploader could double check this and maybe then add a proper copy to a future season upload. (just a thought)
other than that, season 1 and the prior season 2 vids have all been great."

,mtee28,2010-02-02T19:59Z,"How do you open these files? Everytime I try, it says that it can not be opened. It won't unzip or play. Help please? I'm kind of new at this. Besides that, and once I can actually view them, I think this is an amazing upload! Please upload the rest!"
,combat-wombat,2010-02-03T11:15Z,"@mtee: try the VLC-player. it play's everything.

,monomonomo,2010-03-06T05:03Z,Great work on this torrent.
,Yosukekun,2010-03-10T23:41Z,I have noticed episode 10 is a duplicate of 9 as well.  Could someone post it separately?
,erika12,2010-06-10T20:16Z,thank you
[T],PeteSapai,2010-06-11T15:41Z,"mtee28, though VLC is decent, I suggest Media Player Classic Home Cinema:
http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/

Also, as stated before, E10 is an E09 duplicate. So, does anyone know where to find the proper S02E10?"
,dsorc,2010-06-22T14:07Z,"Audio commentary in episodes 5, 9, 14"
,DeafMackem,2010-11-08T14:20Z,Uploader.....episode 9 and 10 is the same!! Please upload the proper episode 10. Thanks 
,shasha2333,2010-12-16T17:46Z,"Sorry but this is not that much better quality than the standard 350mb dvdrips, and for twice the bitrate and size you would expect better, thanks for the effort, hopefully http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4123911/Buffy.The.Vampire.Slayer.Complete.dvdrip.x264 will be a little better"
