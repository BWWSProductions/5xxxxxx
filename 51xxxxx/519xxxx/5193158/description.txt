For years, I've been looking for this old video series that appeared on Public Television,
(WTTW, Channel 11 where I was from), but could not find it.  Narrated by Marty Robinson
(the beggar) for same.  Found and transcoded
very old copy set from VHS Tapes bought out on E-bay & stored for about 30 years.
So don't be too surprised if less-that-stellar quality--I did the best I could.  Last Episode,
Price of Gold, is missing about 6 minutes from the end.)  If anyone knows better place
or better copies, love to add them to my collection, but couldn't let them go.  They are:

1. Collision Course
2. Rich High Desert
3. The Great River
4. Corridors of Time
5. Land of the Sleeping Mountains
6. Price of Gold.

DivX format.  Enjoy
