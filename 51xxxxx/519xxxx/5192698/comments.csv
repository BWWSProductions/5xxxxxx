Do you have any serial codes I can put in to own the game? Did I miss a step? Help me out please"
,ArayKo,2009-12-06T05:35Z,"You might have mised step no 2. Without the crack, it will only offer you limited gameplay."
,jetak,2009-12-10T06:34Z,Trying to run this in Parallels 4 on mac 10.6. The game always crashed during the load screen. Never got it to work.
,ArayKo,2009-12-11T11:12Z,I'm not so sure about Macs and Parallels. I haven't tried running this on a virtual machine. You may want to wait for the official OSX 10.6 release.
,DJCoppy,2009-12-15T21:58Z,"reason to why the ingame still says 1.11 is because the crack is for v1.11.... you torchhead xD

i've recently discovered this game and i started to love it already when i saw a gameplay video of it.
tnx 4 uploading! :)"
,ArayKo,2009-12-17T16:58Z,"I didn't notice that XD . I just copied that warning from the crack file. On my screen however, it shows as 1.12. It probably has something to do with me running the game without installing the crack first and it wrote the values to the registry."
,Whohoho,2009-12-20T22:49Z,Uhm yea hi. I extracted the contents of whatever into the torchlight directory but when I run it it says it can't find OgreMain something?
,kentaur69,2010-01-03T17:35Z,"Doesn't work.  Did the install, then extract the rar. ""Error executing program"". "
,ArayKo,2010-01-04T18:47Z,"@Whohoho & kentaur69
You might want to make sure that the Torchlight.exe from the zipped file goes to your Torchlight install folder (C:\Program Files\Runic Games\Torchlight\). It should ask you to overwrite if done correctly (although I would suggest renaming the original file first for future updates)."
,Zedeem,2010-01-05T01:24Z,"i keep getting the famous Runtime Error, but i guess its not up to your upload..."
,fishcorn,2010-01-12T21:10Z,"If you get an error when extracting the crack to the Torchlight directory, what you should do instead is extract it somewhere else then drag the two files manually into the directory and select the ""replace"" option.

That worked for me. I'm guessing it's some kind of permission error."
,Vl22,2010-01-27T17:08Z,"Cool game, it's working perfectly.

Great torrent!

Thanks to the uploader :)"
,miss_cunt,2010-02-03T08:55Z,"I wouldn't say it's exactly like Diablo 2. I think it's more of a combination of Diablo 2 and Nox, if anyone remembers that game. However, there's a lot that is just like Diablo 2, and they really don't try to hide it at all. It's almost like they just said ""screw it, let's copy blizzard"".

All in all, this download works beautifully, and the game is a lot of fun. I've been playing D2 for the past 10 years, so this is a nice change while I'm waiting for Diablo 3."
,MilanJosic,2010-02-04T04:46Z,"only 400mb?? very fast download, 107 seeders and 13 leechers!! keep seeding all you buetifull people!!!!!!"
,dayne777,2010-02-04T19:38Z,"i've installed the game properly and plays fine except one thing :after some minutes of gameplay i get this message about the application sending some message or whatever to runtime, resulting in shuting down the game. i didn't have this problem at the beggining though anyone have any suggestions?"
,Jesmas,2010-02-06T23:27Z,"I got an error and i deleted the installed game files instead of uninstalling it.  Now i cant install it because the game will detect the previous installed options.

does anyone know how can i remedy this?
"
,shakbugi,2010-02-16T17:05Z,"@Jesmas:
i think it has something to do with the registry editor. run ""regedit"" and look for Torchlight under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then SOFTWARE, then Runic Games and delete the Torchlight entries. try installing again after that."
,hellow33n,2010-02-18T22:53Z,"Nice, fast download and great, easy to use crack. thanks :)"
,shakbugi,2010-03-04T23:31Z,"btw, what version of torchlight is this? i mean like purchased from torchlight.com, from one of their partner sites, or a physical boxed copy?
for the patch, you see. thanks!"
,Fidellio,2010-03-21T17:07Z,"After i finished installing, i tried to move the cracked Torchlight.exe into the directory after i extracted it to my desktop. It asked me for administrator priveledges, which i had, yet afterwards it denied me anyway. If you get the same problem, just use kind of a chain of command thing - try moving it into the folder above it, and move it in from there. Just one tier worked for me, but it might take more for you. Good luck!"
,somedude.1001,2010-04-06T07:50Z,"For anyone whos extra careful, the cracked file seems clean:

Peace!"
,ArayKo,2010-04-09T06:52Z,"@shakibugi
this is version 1.12b. I downloaded this from the official site and got the crack from somewhere (credit to the creators)."
,parrishga,2010-04-27T03:26Z,"how do i find torchlight directory. im getting a message saying, program can start because ogre.dll was not found."
,parrishga,2010-04-27T03:28Z,OgreMain.dll
,cousinbow,2010-05-04T23:01Z,"Work Great! just follow what
