,akmetal,2009-12-04T01:04Z,Does anyone have the Alaska episode (16?)? I haven't seen it anywhere yet.
,peepopaloopo,2009-12-08T06:38Z,anyone know where episode 16 is :O(

,kenpoo,2009-12-09T12:28Z,"the Alaska episode can be found on the BTJunkie and isohunt sites.  On their search engines, use the keywords ""man food s02e16"" and the torrent should pop up in avi form.  It does not have Alaska in its name, the one that has Alaska does not work.  Hope this helps."
,kenpoo,2009-12-09T12:32Z,"The Alaska episode can also be found in the Man vs Food Season 2 that was just released on Pirate Bay, BTJunkie, and Isohunt sites.  This version has Anchorage in its name and is an avi file."
,kenpoo,2009-12-09T12:41Z,"Follow-up to my last note.  First, the complete season 2 of Man vs Food is not available on BTJunkie, but can be found on the other 2 sites.  Second this torrent has only 1 seed and 30-odd peers, so getting a complete copy may be slow and difficult until more seeds can form and join in."
,kenpoo,2009-12-10T10:00Z,"One more follow up note--the man food season 2 torrent has increased the number of seeds and thus all of its episodes are easily obtained.  The good thing about the season 2 set is it contains the complete avi versions of episodes 16 and 18 (Alaska and Tucson) which do not need to be re-integrated to play.  As you can see, episode 18 is in rar form and not playable in its present form.  Check out my comment on season 2 also."
