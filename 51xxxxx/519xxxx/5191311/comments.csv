[V],twentyforty,2009-12-01T21:25Z,"For IS-118 (mod):

I have same ""issue"" with vicerock, PLEASE, do not move my torrents to ""Handhelds"" category. Please.
I have no idea why you guys toying with me..

IT IS NOT encoded for mobiles only.
TAG IS COMPATIBILITY tag, put as a part of the file name by automatized testing-program.

I just have moved in from ""downed"" mininova, I do not need anyone to tell me what to do, especially without my consent. I have 300 000 downloads every month, millions of downloads.

I expect to be found by my ""audience"", people who are lost in this mess.

As the file-name says, [PC Mac XboX PS3 ipod] where ipod is on the last place, it is possible to play such file on ipod, it is good, ipod compatible encoding and that's all.

I DO NOT encode for Hanhelds exclusively and BTW, I will done it myself, right?

Beside, what was the reasoning for your move, I'll never understand. H264... AAC?

I have send e-mail about specific behavior of mods. I have posted on IRC. Do anyone really thinks that I should repeat this for ALL moderators?
Mods have their forum and ways of communication. Please, play nice. Be good.

Sincerely, twentyforty.

P.S I have removed compatibility flag, but this is on you mods, until this matter is sorted out inside TPB. Today, because of your move I had 7 peers for newest movie with Nicolas Cage (and no one else have upped this movie). Do any of you knows how much work has been built in? It doesn't matter what is the frame size, right? For SEVEN people (do not counting-in hit&runs). Please, show some respect and you'll can get it back."

[V],lan3y,2009-12-01T22:02Z,"Look buddy, we sort the catagories by the file Encoder and bitrate, and guess what, yours fall in to the mobile catagory. if you want to keep them in movies re-encode them to a suitable format and they will stay... until then, shut it.

lan3y"
,restoringknives,2009-12-02T01:49Z,This movie has to be crap.  I file this size is good enough for 30 min of good video.  If this is real the quality is only good enough for a small ipod screen.
,milayaa,2009-12-02T05:56Z,"oh come on guys... i've been dwnloading 2040's torrents for a long time... trust me it gives the same quality as a 700mb avi file.... it does... u doubt my word... download and see for urself! i usually watch it in 19"" system monitor or my laptop.... the result is just great..."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-02T07:40Z,"@lan3y:
You, as moderator should be the first one who use non-offensive language, especially without reasoning.
How do you expect to MODERATE with such type of behavior?
2nd, you haven't read what I wrote. You've skimmed through and wrote-out your nature.
3rd, read what my long time users says, then make a call.
4th, bit-rate IS NOT base for compatibility. It never was and never be.
5th, all this shows that you and your cronies (in stupid comment here) based your judgment - ON THIN AIR. You  have no clue what do you talking about.

P.S: Is that the reason for blocking my uploads AFTER I wrote 1st Comment here? Well... history repeats..."
,w-mute78,2009-12-02T08:34Z,"You aren't really blocked, are you? Ricockulous....

Well, I guess email me or something, let me know what's up. FX had a 13th episode for SAMCRO listed, I was hopihn to grab that up from you tonight. To watch on my *gasp* PC."
,wag666,2009-12-02T10:42Z,"I want twentyforty's ups! Not for some hand-whatever-helds. But to watch on my PC.
GIVE HIM a BREAK! Please! "
,FlicksTube,2009-12-02T14:28Z,"@twentyforty
Great job, man! You rock! Ur torrents have always been the best and well, thanks must be in order! :)

@lan3y (The moderator)
Look, we know you are the mod and whatever alright! But why do u treat people like crap without hearing them out?? It was because of uploaders like 2040 and Holyroses that I got into uploading and if 'size' is what they're going after, I guess my torrents will now go unnoticed as well! 

I never thought I'd say this but I'm actually missing Mininova! At least they didn't have such shitty moderators... (So ban me for saying that! That's the best you can do, can't you??) These guys are bullies... who made them mods anyways?? It'll be nice if you try to be nicer, lan3y!

2040, don't give up! We'll find you wherever you are... :) Keep doing the awesome job u're doing!"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-02T15:31Z,"PROS & CONTRAS:

1. Quality

720p Matroska (.mkv) has 7 times bigger picture (frame-size), BUT 10 times higher bitrate (3680 compared to 368) and 2 or 5.1 ch. audio.
File of 720p is 8.38 times bigger. XviD is roughly 2.8 larger than my H264. In turn my H264 encodings are bigger than some XviD encodings, especially ones from Polish ""tvyoyo"" which existed and tagged their encodings as ""XviD asd"". XviD asd was (is) totally inconsistent as method, and their encodings vary from ""phantastic"" to ""unbearably low quality"", what is big problem in collections of TV shows people tend to keep.

Judging from that one might say that small-sized H264 sucks, but in trying to relate such data anyone would stumble on objective/subjective valuation principle and probably get wrong conclusion. Subjectively many things could be better or worse for some, but not for others - we always judge things from ""our perspective"". Such small frame size has disadvantages by nature: In crowded scenes, for example, man's face could occupy/get only 8 square pixels what is same amount for ""characters"" or ""sprites"" in old computer games. However, it wasn't that bad, right? 

Mathematicaly speaking, regarding all these factors, small-sized H264 is de facto 37% lower than 720p in quality, picture-wise. I am very proud of audio quality, where uniqe and proper downmix bring advantages over 128 kbps MP3 tracks in XviD."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-02T15:32Z,"2. Compliance

Sub-format restrictions (literary - 'cause ALL advanced and nice features of libx264 (H264 codec) must be disabled)) brings wide compliance with myriad of devices; from computers to iPods and clones, PS3 or Xbox - devices which almost all households have.

Matroska (720p .mkv) is playable only on some (fast) computers which graphic card/abilities may provide non-shaky playback and connection to TV via HDMI.
Number of standalone devices which accept unaltered .mkv is - negligent.

3. Costs

By nature and by design small-sized H264 generally targets totally different crowd/audience, majority (still over 72%) of people with slow Internet connections, bandwidth restrictions or - traffic limitations.

Download of one 1120 MB large 720p costs around 2.2 $.
Download of one 133 MB ""big"" file I encode costs 24 cents - or nothing.
For example, most people (as I had in past) have free traffic limit (mine was 10 GB). In such limit one can ""sqeeze-in"" 76 (SEVENTYSIX) episodes of beloved shows every month, but ONLY nine matroskas. XviD is better, but 28 shows per month is not everyone's cup of tea. Especially if one CAN follow almost all episodes - instead to pick up few which may be good - or not."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-02T15:33Z,"So, in point 1. (Quality) 720p and XviD are clear winners. It should be, it must be.
However, everything is a matter of balance. Single factors are only a sign of short-sightedness.

In point 2. (Compliance) small-sized H264 is a clear winner. Even the number of XviD capable stand-alones could not be compared to growing number of PS3/Xbox/iPod devices and their clones. Not to mention computers, because any computer is technically capable for both formats (XviD and H264). Not so for Matroskas.

Point 3. or ""Costs"" is so much in favor of small-sized H264, and only objections will come from people with high-income, fast connections and Flat-rate, where traffic isn't the issue. Target audience are pople who need to save on Intrnat traffic or have slow connections which almost surely causes slow upload speeds/abilities from their side. It brings, lets say, some ""disadvantages"". Downloads are slower than they should be, for many reasons. "
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-02T15:35Z,"Most people follow stupid advice (urban myth mostly) how they should throttle-down their upload speed to gain on download speed. It is a lie - one which works only on short distances (until inner rating of peers in swarm is stabilized). It is also not true - here, where I am a tailor of swarm ""policy"", for phase of initial seeding (where individual download speeds means nothing, just upload speeds and EXCHANGE with fellow peers from same swarm; and in general - when ""skeletons from closet"" visit and bang their heads - this time coming from others. Anonymity of torrenting draws the worst from most people, they act as in real lives - as pure consumers, ""get everything and give nothing"" and ""I am the only one that matters"", I see all this stupidities every day, watch how people with Azureuses kick (ban) anyone else except seeders, how ""crippled"" and ""slow"" uTorrents become ""beast"" when I unleash slot speed and so forth. It is -sad.

One day, as it has already been seen on P2P beginnings, at the same time it marked the end of eDonkey network, the only people who have stayed are obsessed-hungry leechers, crooks and porn-maniacs which would eat their own flesh in absence of others.

Normal people, in this as in many other cases, are the true victims of such carnivalism (life is just a game) and cannibalism."
,lilars26,2009-12-02T17:37Z,unbelievable!...8 mins. to download...avg. 568kb/s...I have never reached these speeds before...thank you and good luck.I am seeding.

It's not the size of the DL it's what you do with it
LOL"
,valu59er,2009-12-03T21:14Z,"PS 
actually not LDing this torrent not my personal taste
but had to say 2040 great to find you in a new home loovvee your compressed files
keep doing it fella"
,valu59er,2009-12-03T21:59Z,"I hope 2040 isn't banned moderaters?
His ups great for people like me with limited DL allowance. Searched for him after mini went down :-(
Good luck 2040"

,Hoshi_Reed,2009-12-10T03:39Z,"I'm a dial-up user and never owned any handheld device or even a laptop. Without 2040 and others I would be not be able to get fanvid source fodder and backstory to write fanfic. Maybe if there was a category entitled HD savers or Dial-up friendly then MAYBE it would make sense, HANDHELDS however doesn't."
,Pothead808,2009-12-16T10:33Z,"2040 is a champ in my eyes, dont have a large usage allowance each month, and his rips are usually 1/3 the size of the average rip, and can barely notice a quality difference when playing one of his 120mb files v a 350mb. Posted by a loyal 2040 user."
