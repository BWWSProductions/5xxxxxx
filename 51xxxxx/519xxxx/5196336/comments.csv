There is no 100% seeders, so people downloading need you to keep seeding this oneÂ´a bit more please.

Thank's in advance! "

i'm sorry for inconvenience!"

Sure I understand. No problem.
However a tip until next time you upload a torrent:
use smaller block pieces than 1.00MB preferably 256kB or at least 512kB
to speed up the distribution, since then can people with small bandwidth also
quicker contribute during distribution.
And like me not having a small bandwidth, I can quicker get to 100% and help
seeding with my large broadband.

Torrents with smaller block pieces usually spread more quickly.

Thank's!"
