Northrime - The Onset Of An Era & The Implosion Of A Dream

Northrime is a Finnish metal band, formed in 2008. The bands (then) genre was Heavy metal/Power metal, but now days it has changed to more motherf*cking brutal(ish) metal. The bands present genre is Progressive Melodic Death Metal, so you can imagine the evolving from the past style of the band. Bands lineup went through a couple of changes, when the size of the band got smaller from 7 to 5. We are from Finland, from EtelÃƒÂ¤-Pohjanmaa. We practice almost every week as many times as possible, for about 2-4 hours. Northrime made a first demo this year, and it's called 'The Onset of an Era & The Implosion of a Dream'. We have had couple of gigs, and hopely we will get more shows in future.
