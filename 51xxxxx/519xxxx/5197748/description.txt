     Oh Canada - Our Bought and Sold Out Land (2009)


Author       : Dan Matthews
Genres       : Documentary

Plot:
   This entertaining documentary film explores the history of banking, the
selling out of the prosperity of Canada, the clearance sale of Canadian
businesses and the political liquidation of public infrastructures to the
multi-national corporate oligarchy. How has this led to the biggest economic
crash / recession / depression in Canadian history? Could it have something
to do with our politicians listening to international bankers and corporations
instead of the people Canada? How does the Canadian banking system really
work? How does the central Bank of Canada compare with the American Federal
Reserve? This movie presents these issues that affect every Canadian from
the perspective of and delivered by concerned youth in a astute and colourful
manner. This is a serious journalism piece that asks the tough questions
directly to such politicians as Former Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin,
Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May,
Ontario Gas Man Dan McTeague, NDP Leader Jack Layton, Mayor of Oshawa John
Gray, Former Prime Minister of Canada John Turner and many more! We encourage
