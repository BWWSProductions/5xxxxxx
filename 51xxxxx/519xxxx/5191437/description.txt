                    Twilight for Google SketchUp                        
       Twilight is a fantastic render system, capable of producing      
        photo-realistic renders quickly and easily.  The Twilight       
        Plugin for Google SketchUp puts that power directly into        
        your SketchUp session, bringing your models to life like        
                             never before.                              
                                                                        
          No more need to export your models into cumbersome,          
                         intermediate formats!                          
             No more distorted geometry or lost textures!              
          All rendering is done directly inside SketchUp using         
      multiple biased and unbiased render methods for unparalleled      
                                control.                                
        No fussing with complicated render settings or senseless       
       numbers...choose from several intuitive and powerful "Easy"      
                render settings right at your fingertips.               
       Render...and keep working.  Your workflow is uninterrupted      
        as your render works in the background while you develop        
                          your scene further.                           
       Using the Ruby script engine, Twilight interfaces directly       
                             into SketchUp.                             
                                                                        
        Add a new spot-light?  It's immediately available in the       
                             Light Editor.                              
       Create a new layer?  You'll find you can render just that       
          layer or ignore it, directly from the Render Editor.          
         Have multiple scenes?  Render from any saved view, or         
                    render them all in an animation.                    
          You'll find the color and textures of your materials         
          directly integrated into the revolutionary Types and          
                    Templates of our Material Editor.                   
                                                                        
                                                                        
         Better than that, Twilight can talk directly to SketchUp       
                               as well!                                 
                                                                        
         When you change the IES data for your light, watch the        
                     geometry immediately update.                       
        Adjust your camera focal length in the Render Editor and       
               see SketchUp's view adjust appropriately.                
      Send colors and textures directly from the Material Editor,      
                        straight to your scene.                         
          And all that information is stored directly into your         
       SketchUp file, so you never lose a thing.  You'll be amazed      
      at how seamless it is to use Twilight inside Google SketchUp!
