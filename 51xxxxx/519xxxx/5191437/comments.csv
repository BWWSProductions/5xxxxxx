,thukon,2010-12-30T15:33Z,"the file is NOT broken... if you dont know how to extract these kinds of zips, dont talk.
Highlight all the zip files, and extract them to a folder. They will self extract in order."

I think all that they did was remove the watermark that comes up on the demo version.
I have no idea how to increase the resolution beyond the 800x600 limit. The program is only a hundred bucks if you're desperate..."
