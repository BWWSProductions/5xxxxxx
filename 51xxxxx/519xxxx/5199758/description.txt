Dollhouse is an American science fiction television series created by writer-director Joss Whedon under Mutant Enemy Productions. The show premiered on February 13, 2009 on the Fox network.

Echo (Eliza Dushku) is a young woman who literally embodies the Marine Corps' slogan "Be All You Can Be". She is one of a group of men and women who can be, literally, anyone or fulfill any role -- by getting imprinted with personality packages, including memories, skills, language-even muscle memory-for different assignments. When not imprinted with a personality package, Echo and the others are basically mind-wiped, with no memory of their work outside the house. The show revolves around the childlike Echo's burgeoning self-awareness, and her varying ability to recall who she was before, a problem that begins to seep into her various imprinted personalities and puts her in danger both in the field and in the closely monitored confines of the Dollhouse.
