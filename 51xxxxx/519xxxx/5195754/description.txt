Circulatory System features all the members of The Olivia Tremor Control, as well as Jeff Mangum and Julian Koster of Neutral Milk Hotel! Signal Morning, the band's sophomore release, is thick with textures, layered percussion, angular guitars, vibrating strings, woodwinds, and brass. Eagerly anticipated since their self-titled debut, Signal Morning was culled from hours of recorded material sculpted in at least seven different studios. It is an absolutely stellar document of song and sound. Still concerned with matters of the inner and the outer, the incomprehensibly huge and the very, very small. An imperative blast of kinetic motion, composed by W. Cullen Hart while in the midst of battling Multiple Sclerosis within his own system - broadcasting his urgent pleas to the world(s) to evolve into a higher dimension or for existing patterns to reveal themselves at peace within the natural order of the universe.
