This is the Windows 7 Repair Disc for the 32bit versions.

What if something goes wrong and your OS refuses to boot up? Well unlike other versions of Windows, Windows 7 comes with a robust set of utilities to recover your system in case of some serious issues.

This disc, which you need to burn to either a DVD or a CD will come in your aid in just the above kind of scenario. As most people upon installing Windows 7 fail to create a recovery disc for their system, this is their ticket out.

Just to clarify, this disc doesn't contain the actual Windows 7 OS (the size justifies that), but all the recovery tools needed to recover your OS and have it up & running as before.

NOTE: The above file is an .iso image of Microsoft's Repair Disc (generally not available), & doesn't contain any virus/spyware/malware whatsoever. I believe in clean sharing.

If you like Windows 7, support the developers & BUY it. Even Microsoft sometimes deserves some credit for their work.
