I've been seeding this, and the other three Christian Christmas Music bundles, non-stop, since I've first torrented this thing.  Please have a little patience.  There are currently about 50 people collected to me for each of the four bundles."

Thanks"

The files are corrupt and/or are only a few seconds of music. Disc one seems to be fine. Also would have been great to have the info on who the artists are. Again, thank you for the torrent."
