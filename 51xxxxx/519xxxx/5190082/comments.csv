,yusefmou,2009-12-02T05:46Z,"people, I can't download nothing.....in every single atempt I get ""0"" seeders, not only this torrent. I poped in before and in the main screen it said ( how do I download ) pressed that...and it said to download ""miro"" I know how to download but it just won't happen, can anybody give me heads up on this one?

oh BTW I'm a new member so show me some love ;)"
,dimi13beast,2009-12-03T00:13Z,"yusefmou: ur firewall might be blocking the torrent client, check under exceptions in ur firewall and add the program ur using, or u could try bitcomet or utorrent."
,anonick93,2009-12-06T23:00Z,so i downloaded it just fine and copied over the dll into the plugin directory but its still asking me to insert an ilock key
,dimi13beast,2009-12-07T03:55Z,"Interesting.
I didnt encounter that problem
Are you using VST or RTAS?

Try reinstalling the programme and redownloading if the problem persists."
,anonick93,2009-12-08T17:44Z,using VTS. is there a way you can provide more specific instructions? i tried using this as a plugin on FL Studio 8
,dimi13beast,2009-12-12T03:02Z,"OK. These are the instructions that worked for me.
1)Run the Setup of the Demo
2)When the Setup is done go into the folder w/ the .dll VST file and copy/paste into your VST plugins folder. I dont use FL that much so idk where it is for you
3) Restart your computer
4)Start up Fruityloops or whatever u use and it should work
>If this does not work for you still, i cant help you anymore, sry. Try Autotune 5.08 if u cant get this one."
,lando520,2009-12-13T06:43Z,"This torrent seemed safe to me but when I downloaded it, limewire said this torrent may be trying to do damage to your computer so limewire has cancelled this download. So what can I do?"
,dimi13beast,2009-12-15T23:20Z,"its not a bug. If limewire wont let you download it, try downloading it with a different torrent client like utorrent, bitcomet, etc.
what is another hot program i could post?"
,aleksander75,2009-12-17T12:50Z,"Dimi I have this plugin Autotune_Evo v6.0.9_MAC(diMi)_RTAS is it yours? It doesn't work, it has a .dmg installer which is good but then the .dpm file and the .dpm.rsr seems to be for pc as they don't work. Any idea?"
,bschmitty1992,2009-12-18T07:40Z,all it is is the trial? how do i get it to work one hundred percent

,dimi13beast,2009-12-20T07:24Z,"@Maxx_
Shoulda given dirty zorab credit, yes.
I just repackaged it, really on tpb where everyone could find it."
,Doreiku,2009-12-21T02:08Z,"I have reinstalled it twice, copied the dll file into the plugins twice, and it's still asking for the ilock. Could I get specific directions on how to turn this trial into a fully licensed program?"
,dimi13beast,2009-12-21T08:57Z,"@ Doreiku
OK, idk how to help you beyond installing it."
,niko10n,2009-12-22T22:09Z,interesting
,dmines,2009-12-25T18:22Z,how do you install it for Pro Tools? IDK where to put the stuff.
,zingmars,2009-12-29T12:52Z,Hmm whenever I open up FL and load up autotune it simply crashes the FL :/
,zingmars,2009-12-29T13:23Z,"same thing with mixcraft, when it loads autotune on loading screen it simply crashes :S"
,dimi13beast,2010-01-01T05:24Z,idk it works perfectly w/ acid pro
,mrmagicdon,2010-01-03T02:54Z,"For People who say this is a trial verison it is now when you put it in vista folders but whe you open a program it is fully functional program with no pop us  ilok what you have to do is run admin for vista yea...xp sp 2 it works fine as well..........

thank thanks thanks thanks thanks"
,nmxabc,2010-01-15T18:07Z,"Does NOT seem to work with win XP 64bit (superior).
It asks for pacelok drivers, but when these are updated, it still doesnt work.

Any ideas!?"
,nmxabc,2010-01-15T18:11Z,"It's the setup that is crashing, i guess.
I run with a legal Cubase 4, on Superior xp 64bits os.
I'm desperate for this one, and so are everyone else that can hear me sing..."
,dimi13beast,2010-01-18T07:28Z,"After it installs the pacelock drivers,
DO NOT RESTART!!!
Copy/Paste .dll into Vst plugins dir
then restart"
,el_thompson,2010-01-27T16:13Z,"this works perfectly with PTLE8.

@dimi13beast, have a look at Waves v7 for PC please! Fine job here!"
,itsJuiice,2010-02-07T19:43Z,it still says i have the trial.. can someone clarify how to unlock it?
,itsJuiice,2010-02-07T21:05Z,"@dimi13beast- the VST works fine, but i cant get past the tiral for the RTAS, im trying to use it for Pro Tools 8LE..
HELP PLZ.."
,AudioPhile25,2010-02-23T06:18Z,"VST works perfectly. Haven't gotten around to testing the RTAS just yet, though it did install without any problems. I have both Windows 7 64 bit and 32 bit and an iLok Key so anyone with similar setups should be fine."
,untrueparadox,2010-03-07T04:45Z,"I just posted a real cracked version here.

,ncjmj,2010-04-03T00:31Z,"how do you get it to work? i've installed it, uninstalled, and reinstalled about 5 times, and it won't set up the demo.

does the fact that i'm using windows 7 64bit have anything to do with it?"
,ch3mw4r,2010-05-15T01:21Z,yeah it's saying the .exe is corrupted. 
,NIEWQL,2010-06-21T12:56Z,"Using it in Protools 8 now in XP sp3 (32-bit of course, there is no 64-bit sp3), and this is way better then the previous version! Thanks to the uploader!!

Don't know what the reason is why some people can't get the demo version, for me, it installed without any trouble. Did you follow ĂŠvery step of the instructions?"
,Sneag,2010-07-06T05:20Z,Wait... you actually have an iLok key and use it with pirated stuff?  Is that not a bad idea?
,abandonallships,2010-10-14T06:35Z,"( FOR VISTA ) i figured how why it keeps crashing when you try to load it on FL Studio

go to Start button/ right click on Computer / Properties / Advanced System Settings
/ go to the Advanced tab and click on Settings the first one on the top / Data Execution Prevention tab / and click on Turn on DEP For All Programs and Services Except Those I Select / click on Add / go to C:\program files\Image-Line\FL Studio 9 and look for the icon called FL double click it and Apply and press Ok it might ask you to restart your computer..go ahead and restart it"
,musicman24,2010-11-22T04:01Z,hw do you download it.?
,k1llerteddybear,2011-01-08T02:32Z,"I am having an issue. 

I have ACID Pro 7. Anyway, I installed the VST, did not restart, then copied the .dll into the program directory (i selected the copy and replace option), restarted, then booted up ACID Pro. No go. Despite several un-installations and re-installations it is still not functioning. I used this torrent on a friends computer with the same audio program and same order of operations and it worked fine the very first try. I am confused. Help anyone?"
,michael.jackson,2011-03-29T22:54Z,"i havw win7 64-bit, will this work? shamoneeeeee."
,LordDice,2011-05-07T07:21Z,"thanks SOOoo much. I've searched everywhere! this is a needle in the haystack. can't believe I finally found it. p.s. what ever program you are using; after copying dynamic link (.dll) to VST plugin folder, open prog preferences and it will have a dialog to search for new plug ins. hope this helps. that was my problem I had it loaded in but couldn't get it to work till I did that. peace. and thanks again for the great torrent!"
,LordDice,2011-05-07T07:27Z,"and Yah Mike,. It will work. I got W7 64bit"
,Dessum,2011-05-08T11:40Z,"I have not used the RTAS but I can confirm that the VST WORKS. I installed the program, patched the crack, restarted, then used it no problems in Sony Vegas. Came up as a virus in AVG 9 but that's expected as it's a crack derp. Many thanks to the uploader!"
,Hoven_X,2011-08-04T07:29Z,Its not working on my computer bro. Could you help me out? I really need this plug in
,musicguy1985,2011-09-24T02:53Z,"I am having a lot of trouble here, I've been using the VST for awhile now, I recently got an Mbox with Protools so I tried installing the RTAS and now when it is finished it tries to do the interlock thing and fails saying it already has the most recent iLok installed setup can not be completed, I even tried uninstalling the VST and interlok and still no success, anyone know what to do? I would like to have both VST for Cubase and RTAS for Protools"
