Nicholas Gombert (c1495-c1560) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombert

A small selection of this composer's output is interspersed with short medieval chant settings of the same, giving added texture to the overall recording.  The all-male choir's tone in this CD is superb, and there is good separation of the voices.  Lots of scrunchy harmonies here.

From the CD blurb: GRAMOPHONE EDITOR'S CHOICE : The Flemish composer Nicolas Gombert is believed to have been a pupil of Josquin; his style of composition is equally assured and yet there are elements of significant innovation. As early as 1556 Gombert was regarded as the absolute model of harmonic and imitative writing, and his general avoidance of rests broke much new ground.  This recording of eight works from his prolific output (some 160 motets alone) includes the monumental eight-part Credo and the extended Salve Regina which uses no fewer than seven separate texts in honour of Mary (hence the subtitle, 'different people pray different things'). Gombert is also famous for having been consigned to the galleys of a trireme after being caught violating a choirboy.

Apologies for the lowish bitrate: I ripped this back in 2000 and have since misplaced my original CD.  It is not really noticeable on playback, however.
