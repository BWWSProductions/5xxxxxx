,elrohiremre,2009-12-05T17:21Z,"   How Can you save game?====
This fix your dirt 2 save game problem i do it and it is okey for me
1.  Launch the game. Open the Windows Live menu.
   2. If you are already logged onto a profile (local or online), sign out (Create profile button will only become visible when you aren?t logged into anything)
   3. Click on ?Create new profile? button.
   4. In the dialog box that pops up DO NOT hit continue. Hitting continue will take you to a registration page for an ONLINE profile ? that?s not what we want.
   5. Once in the ?Create Gamer Profile? window, scroll down so that you can see the bottom paragraph.
   6. Look for the hyperlinked ?created a local profile? link in last paragraph. Clicking this will allow you to create a new offline profile.

You should now be able to save your progress in Dirt 2 without any issues. The game will log you into your offline profile automatically whenever the game is launched. "
[T],ADHDerby,2009-12-06T10:57Z,"If you created an offline profile, still get an ""Autosave Failed"" error and have 2 or more gamepads connected then disconnect all but one."
[T],ADHDerby,2009-12-06T17:49Z,"I've found some parameters for DiRT2, you can run them by adding a parameter to the DiRT2 shortcut
Example: ""%ProgramFiles%\Codemasters\DiRT2\dirt2.exe"" -demo

-benchmark - Launches the benchmark, the results are saved in ""%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\DiRT2\benchmarks""
-demo - Launches DiRT2 in rolling demo mode (Croatia Raid), press Alt+F4 to exit.
-amd - Launches DiRT2 in rolling demo mode (London Battersea), press Alt+F4 to exit.

For those who want to know, you NEED to make a GFWL offline account, but they hid the option to do so. When you start the game and make a profile, it will be in this paragraph of text saying something like ""or you can create a local account"". THAT is what you want.
