I might post again if the story is good - sounds alright so far (I'm only two minutes in), but the reader is kind of breathy and over-dramatic, which, when coupled with the lower quality recording, makes certain parts hard to hear.  

Any suggestions for settings I could change to improve that?  Thanks for the upload, though.  I'm always looking for new, good material to listen to."
