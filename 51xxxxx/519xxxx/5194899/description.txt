In the city of Hell's Crown, legendary Demon Hunter Cain Stoddard was infected by an ancient evil. Stumbling from the city, he fled north, seeking the desolation of the Old Kingdoms. There, he hoped to find the means to expel the wickedness living just beneath his skin.

But this is not Cain Stoddard's story. This is the story of the apprentice he left behind. A first rate scoundrel, a second class cheat, a third rate braggart, and a fourth rate drunk, Liam Gulban has been called many things. No one has ever called him a hero. Now, Cain Stoddard's young student must put aside his foolish pastimes to rescue his oldest friend.

On the way, he will encounter savage monsters, lusty refugees, undead musicians, smelly druids, and at least one certifiably insane god. His closest allies will betray him, and a goddess will choose him as her champion. All the while, he'll be fighting against his most tenacious enemy...himself.
