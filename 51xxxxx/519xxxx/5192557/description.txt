Work done:
broadcasted this concert at 1500 kbps bitrate. There were some technical problems, that's why the intro song is missing, and some buffering problems at the beginning. All in all it was a good concert, buttook the liberty of not letting some people watch (from certain countries). That's just lame.

Anyway, I've beefed up the video to 2500 kbps and added some filters to make the entire video more appealing to the eyes. It's a 8.5/10 720p release, since it's been capped from the web, and we all know web video has it's downsides.

PS: Also, since I'm Romanian, HAPPY BDAY ROMANIA! (and I had to use a proxy to cap the concert, but meh!)

REMINDER: THIS IS NOT SCENE, IF YOU WANT SCENE, PLEASE GO AND WAIT FOR SOME SCENE GROUP TO CAP THIS PROPERLY.
