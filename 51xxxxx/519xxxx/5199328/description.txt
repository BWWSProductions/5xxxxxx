                 WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SUPPORT WEBSITES OR INDIVIDUALS THAT   
                 REPACKAGE OUR RELEASES. Our releases include BOTH the app   
                 AND the crack. If you download a release that contains the  
                 crack ONLY we will not support any problems with it. This   
                 is because too many software companys will update their     
                 program to kill the current crack. Then Joe Lamer comes to  
                 us and says "YOU GUYS SUCK, YOUR SHIT DOESNT WORK". Yeah    
                 well get our OFFICIAL RELEASE if you want support. If a     
                 crack of ours isn't working and you downloaded our          
                 OFFICIAL RELEASE we will help you out to get it working.    
                 If you got a REPACKAGED RELEASE then you are SOL, and see   
                 the detail below regarding our policy of distributions.
