BOOTMII BOOTER CHANNEL

100% LEGAL HOMEBREW CHANNEL!


This is a Simple Channel i made/Assembled in about 15 mins. its simple. 
when ran from the wii menu, it loads bootmii. REQUIRES BOOTMII AS IOS, becasue it loads bootmii threw ios reload, also requires the standard bootmii files on sd card. i made this channel so i would not have to load HBC, or restart my wii, to backup my nand. i take no credit for the dol i inserted into the wad, that was on Wiibrew.

Looks:
Blue Background, With Bootmii booter logo. logo moves. Some Random sound i found on my computer too. ya i know its not all that pretty, but its not ugly.

Enjoy, and feel free to modify this channel and re upload it. but put a link in the comments so i can check it out!
