It's official, Nick Cave and Dirty Three violinist / long-time Bad Seeds cohort Warren Ellis have been called upon to provide the score to the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel The Road, due out November 26th.
This is definitely a happy reunion as film maker John Hillcoat previously paired with Cave and Ellis for the excellent soundtrack to the apocalyptic Australian Western film, The Propostion.
The Road follows the premise from the book of the same name. An unnamed father (Mortensen) and his young son (Smit-McPhee) struggle to survive after an unspecified apocalypse and make their way toward the coast for possible food, shelter, safety, or to potentially find other survivors of the cataclysmic events. Along the way, they encounter grave struggles and hardships across the barren landscapes, with scarce shelter and resources available to them, and having to avoid bands of cannibals and other desperate gangs looking to pillage valuables and food. Various flashback sequences occur where the Man remembers events prior to the catastrophe, many involving his deceased wife, who has a much more expanded role in the film than in the original book.
