,Likeadidas95,2009-12-29T20:24Z,"yeah it works nicely, like always ! :) kaos and tptb is both good guys . I mean, they are making rips .. and they make ur lifes better. But anyway .. talking about the game ! :D

I dont got any problems, it just works fine.I dont like handling of the car :D its just a little bit crap or smth.

But i extracted the game : took 1 min and 20 sec , then i unpacked , it tooked 25 min. and played the game from "" saboteur launcher "" the whole download tooked 7 h + extraction and unpacking.

Anyway im happy cuz i dont got any problems ..
i got xp service pack 3 and nvidia 9400 gt.
I cant play the game highest graphics. My shadows is OFF and that postprocessing bullshit is OFF . Others like texture and stuff are all "" Very High ""  when i but my shadows and postblabal ON , then the game fucks a LITTLE BIT .. but i like to play when everything is smooth and good .
My Specs are : AMD X2 2.81ghz , ram 3.5 gig , grphz card nvidia 9400 gt 1 gig .

Anyway ; thanks a lot Gansuk and THE SEEDERS ! Thank ya all ! ;**

[ Soz for my bad english ;) , i hope u understood me ;) ]"
