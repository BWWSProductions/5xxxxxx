Christian Joseph Lidarti (1730-1795)


I acquired this CD recently from a charity outlet. The case and booklet were extremely battered, so I thought that either the music was good or the previous-owner's children/dogs liked to play with his collection. Perhaps both, but now I've listened to it, definitely the first! This is music is not dissimilar to Haydn's output.

From the CD blurb: "The eighteenth-century Italian composer Christian Joseph Lidartiâ€™s three violin concertos are all recorded here for the first time. These charming works constitute an important Italian bridge between the baroque violin literature and the music of the classical period"
