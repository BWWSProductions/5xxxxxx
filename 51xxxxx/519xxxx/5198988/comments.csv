Picture quality: good, but not exactly great either. Picture appears to be blurred. However: I read that there was a problem during the production of the movie with the overall picture sharpness (because they filmed b/w on color film stock), so it is entirely possible that this is not a problem of the rip.

What certainly /is/ a problem of this rip is that English subtitles are hardcoded into it, completely unnecessary. This actually appears to be a full DVD rip (the menu is included, and you can select Dutch subtitles from the menu), but in addition the English subs are hardcoded, which is really annoying.

In summary: not a perfect upload, but still the best one I found for this movie."
