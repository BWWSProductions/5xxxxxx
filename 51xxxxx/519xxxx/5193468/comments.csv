,jtkizzle,2011-01-17T09:41Z,"not only did it take me going to 5 different torrent sights to get this to find seeders but when I finally get it downloaded, it doesn't work.  When you try to open the reader it stops working before even opening, same if you try to open the library.  I tried legally downloading the reader and adding the library, that doesn't work either..."
