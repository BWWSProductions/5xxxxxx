I've been using this for quite a sometime and it works 100% and so I thought of sharing it. I'm not sure if other fixes work but this one works correctly. The fix works with the ESS versions I'm uploading but not sure for newer versions. You are getting both 32 bit (x86) and 64 bit versions. 

Instructions:

1. After installing ESS, go to Settings and disable Self-defense (important)
2. Reboot the system. Now, simply run the Fix.

You're done. First update should be done manually. Sometimes it takes a few attempts to update, but it will surely update. 

BTW: This Fix is called Mara Fix. I downloaded this from RS sometime ago. This archive isn't passworded.
