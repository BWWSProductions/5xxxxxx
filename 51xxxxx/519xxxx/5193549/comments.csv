What the Mara Fix does is it keeps resetting the trial. When you Turn off the Self Defense and apply the patch it will keep it at 30 days. If you apply the fix and turn the Self Defense back on it will only reset the trial only when you restart or turn off your PC"

,XxAlLeNxSk8eRxX,2011-05-07T18:20Z,Right click the fix and click run as administrator
,Killer Death,2011-05-18T13:55Z,"A better crack for Nod32 you won't find. Run it once and you're done. I don't recommend those Tnods, Nodenablers and Nodlogins, tried them all and this is the best. "
,tougher83,2011-05-21T22:29Z,"ok I finally got this to work!!!  I tried to right click and run the fix as administrator butt that option does not exist...  (vista is a pain in the ass)  so here is what I did...     enable hidden administrator account via command 
(net user administrator /active:yes)
then drop the fix in the public folder and log out!!!  then log in as administrator run the fix and done!!!
when I was done i disabled the administrator account
disable user administrator
(net user administrator /active:no)
hope this helps

thnx uploader    this fix is awesome"

,gus7silva,2011-07-13T04:01Z,Works Perfect thankyou so much :)
,tbraybrook,2011-07-16T17:48Z,Took 3 tries ( and was going to uninstall it) but it is finally updating. If it doesn't update then no point in keeping as the virus definitions would be a couple of years old. Finally updated though.
,zlatantz,2011-08-05T08:30Z,Please help! It doesn't want to update. It says progress: 0 kb/0kb and it stays like that for three years. And i want to update it.
