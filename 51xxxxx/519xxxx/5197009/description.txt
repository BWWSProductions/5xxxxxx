Concerto Grosso : See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_grosso

This torrent contains four out of six CDs from the boxed set "Handel: Orchestral Works", above, but the CDs have also been published as individual discs outside the boxed set.  

The other two CDs from the above set contain Handel's Water and Firework suites, which I have uploaded separately and are available at https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4973113 and https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5262654 respectively

This recording, as with all by the English Concert, has been made using period instruments.
