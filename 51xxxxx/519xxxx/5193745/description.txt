Release Notes
been meaning to watch this, but hate cams so
r5 will do :)....anyway tried it on the tv earlier
looked quite nice, so i fixed the colors up as
the image was dull looked washed out...was mainly
contrast screwed to be fair, so i lowered the contrast
but brightening it with another filter as it was dark...anyway
i know theirs alot out their but mine was supposed to be released
this morning but my server fucked up, so looking for a back up;)
