,scratchmynuts2,2009-12-03T12:57Z,"nice work , thx. A-8V-9 I'll be seeding for a week."

And please, no .RARs.. They're just pointless"

 Once you ""extract"" the movie from the .rar files you now have the movie and the rar files.  So you can convert or transcode and burn the movie file and then delete it while still having the .rar files to seed with.  You seemed to be saying the .rar files would be empty.  Or maybe you just don't think anybody would seed after they had the movie file, but that makes no sense because non-.rar files are used for seeding all the time.  Not as much as they should be, but that's the same with all files.

I seed no matter what format the downloaded file was in."
