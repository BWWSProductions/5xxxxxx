,botanybay1,2009-12-01T17:21Z,I really like his stand-up and sarcastic style but I think Dennis lost a lot of fans due to his love of George Bush. I thought he was smarter than that.
[V],rambam1776,2009-12-01T18:30Z,"He doesn?t, nor did he ever, LOVE George W Bush. He was/is a Conservative, and simply backed the GOP candidate. Party trumps person, and politics is far more complicated than you portray it to be. In fact, if you watch these shows, you see him dump on the GOP quite a bit. He is violently pro-Choice, advises women to organize to vote out idiots like Arlen Specter, and makes comparisons like ?the lack of concern the Republicans have for their victims.?  Perhaps the real problem is that you, like many, have drunk the kool-aid so much that you have come to see moderate conservatives as neo-cons, and you see liberal democrats as middle of the road moderates. REAL middle of the road types do NOT favor either party because they see so much wrong with both of them. They tend to vote each election for the person or side they think (or hope!) will do the least amount of damage. Don?t let Bush Derangement Syndrome blind you to Poly Sci 101.

,Steffi.H,2010-01-28T21:51Z,"""Surprisingly, nobody has bothered to torrent this collection.""  Oh please.  No one is interested, even now that it has been torrented.  No one is suprised.
Miller was, and is a staunch defender of all things Bush/Cheney and their extremist policies, including torture, illegal war, illegal surveillance, HUGE government, HUGE spending and a destruction of the economy.  All things that Libertarians, Independents and those that love liberty are firmly and totally against.  Don't take my word for it, look it up.  Miller's pro Bush stance is a matter of public record.  Again and again he defends Bush.  His funny days are long over.  He's a tedious bore now, not that he was ever knee slappingly hilarious.  He still does his rants, very scripted and self aggrandising. Problem is, no one is listening any more to those that defend Bush or try to distance themselves from their support of the Bush/Cheney criminal enterprise.  We will not tolerate your bullshit any longer, and we dont' find you funny.  Bush was our worst president ever, and Miller was our worst ""comic"" ever.   Miller says he's pro-gay, but in the same breath will defend Republicans who sponsor legislation to have homosexuals persecuted and even killed.  He says he's pro-choice, and then defends Rudolph Guiliani, who said the very same thing, only to turn against women's right's to privacy and reproductive rights. Miller defends government intrusion, spying and eavesdropping into every aspect of the lives of Americans.  He is against trials and justice.  Not Libertarian.  Anti-liberty.  Anti-civil rights.  Anti-American.  Miller is a flaming hypocrite who wants to be a populist, but has made himself so boringly irrelevant that he had to *pay* people to sit in his audience, and his market share was a whopping 65,000 people, not even enough to fill a large stadium.  His show is a failure, just like his football announcing career.  There is nothing that he can't fail at.  Google ""Dennis Miller Republican"" and realize that he violated ethics and law by hiring people on a political talk show that were still working for political campaigns for REPUBLICANS.  Miller had a long string of Republicans on his show, and defended all of them.  He can call himself whatever he wants, but surrounding himself with Republicans who worked on George W. Bush's and John McCain's campaigns and defending Republican policies publicly means that you are NOT a Libertarian or an Independent, that you are anti-liberty and anti-democratic process.  Miller said he voted for Bush because he was a ""checkers player"" who ""jumps the bad guys"" and Kerry is ""a chess player who thinks too much.""  Very glib about the life and death of others.  Not funny Dennis. Partisanship at it's worst.   Dennis, your extreme partisanship is showing.  You are a formerly mildly interesting person a LONG time ago who has become a Bush/Cheney/McCain Apologist on the wrong side of We The People, and your career has suffered for it.  Good riddance Dennis, and goodbye.  The ""Big Laughs"" endorsement from the right wing propaganda mouthpiece known as the New York Daily News is the only amusing joke in his long boring ranting blather.  70% of Americans strongly support health insurance reform, which is being obstructed by right wing extremists.  That means that according to the right wing talking point, 70% of Americans are extremist socialist who are all suffering from ""delusion"" because they want to change *everything* that the Republicans stand for.  No wonder less than 20% of Americans now identify as Republican.  The numbers don't lie.  Americans don't want Republican policies any more.  They want their country back, and it drives Republicans delusional to the point where they think that people like Dennis Miller are funny, when really he's just another paid hack for a fake news outlet that spews hateful propaganda."
[V],rambam1776,2010-04-29T09:21Z,"Rather than point out the fallacies you offer in copious amount, howzabout I simply ask that you bother to follow the rules of grammar, and break up YOUR rants (hello, kettle!) into paragraphs so that they can be followed?"

,netrek,2011-06-09T13:17Z,"Hey Steffi you liberal moron, Miller is a comedic genius who will be remembered 100 years from now. What have you done? This may come as a shock to you but PEOPLE DIE IN WARS! There is a global Jihadist movement that wants to see anyone who disagrees with them dead and would have us living like it's the 7th century. Sadly some innocent people will die to defeat this evil, but if you add up ALL the casualties of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars it is miniscule compared to the casualties from World War 1, World War 2, Korean War, or even Vietnam War."
,tiz2,2012-06-22T14:11Z,"@ netrek: US foreign policy is more detrimental to world peace than any ""world wide jihadist movement"", who has no real power, but did play it's part as scary boogieman for a while. I'm afraid they will have to come up with a new enemy for the next war though,  but I'm confident they will find someone before their current wars ""run out""."
