,4rror,2009-12-01T11:44Z,I've re-released this because the original versions were packed very inconveniently.
,ScorpioPirate,2009-12-01T15:24Z,"only 64bit??

or 32-64bit??

(Symantec.Endpoint.Protection.v11.0.5002.333-ZWT x32-x64)
(Here is the 64bit version)"
,4rror,2009-12-01T15:58Z,Both 32 AND 64 bit.
,ScorpioPirate,2009-12-01T16:21Z,Thank's... :-)
,4rror,2009-12-01T16:30Z,No problem at all. I'll be watching this comment thread closely for a while.

,iknowwho,2009-12-08T05:17Z,"I've had problems installing what I believe to be a previous version on windows 7.  I installed the lusetup.exe first in the admin com prompt, restarted and installed the full program.  I have downloaded this version because an identical computer would not allow me to do this.  I am hoping yours will work...Do you know if there is something ""special"" I should attempt to do if this gives me a similar issue?"

Personally, I had no problem installing these on Windows 7, but I haven't installed any previous versions of SEP first.
Let me know how it goes..."
,4rror,2009-12-08T11:35Z,"Perhaps I misunderstood, slightly. Nevertheless, let me know."
,xaviergzz,2009-12-09T00:37Z,is this a cracked copy or is a license file included?
,4rror,2009-12-09T09:51Z,"According to this Symantec page, a license file is not needed:

,iknowwho,2009-12-09T17:33Z,Will let you know next week after I get to try and fix the issue...
,4rror,2009-12-13T19:55Z,"I've installed with the setup.exe myself, but under normal circumstances both should work.

The .msi is just a standard Windows Installer file, which allows you to customize/automate the installation, which can be practical in a large corporate environment, for instance.

Have a look at this Wikipedia entry for more info:

,niko2008,2010-02-19T02:18Z,Tnx a lot 4rror. I tested both /x86 and x64/ on Win 7 Pro /x86 and x64 - genuine copies/. Worked very well. No problems.
,4rror,2010-03-04T19:01Z,Always glad to hear it.

,crayolakidd,2010-03-30T13:58Z,"@Andbir. The 0.5* build number indicates that this is in fact a ""release update 5"" version."
,oPiN37,2010-06-29T15:35Z,"I´ve never downloaded a program before.... but does this work on Vista? Is it better than ESET? I´ve had ESET for almost a year, but after I didn´t have internet for sex months I can no longer connect to their servers.... so, is this better than ESET?"
,4rror,2010-07-21T15:43Z,"@oPiN37:
Although I don't have any real experience with Eset, my experience with SEP (and SAV before it) is that it keeps working for quite some time.
Symantec supplies definition updates for several years."
