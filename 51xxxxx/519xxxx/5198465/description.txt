    Use our keymaker to register the application.                        
                                                                         
    note: The name in the keymaker MUST be the same as currently         
    logged in user account of computer you're trying to register         
    MacPaw app (ie. not necessarily display name but the user            
    account found under /Users/*).  The default name when running        
    keymaker is correct for computer it's on.  Reason name is editable   
    is so that if someone wanted to generate serials for another user    
    account it's possible without having to run multiple instances of    
    keymaker.
