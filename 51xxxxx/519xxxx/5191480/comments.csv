I guess this tracker is familiar turf for you, but for me it's kind of uncharted territory.  I began using TPB on Thursday of last week [I'm sure you know why].

As of yesterday I had uploaded 9 torrents with no troubles, but today the two I tried many many times to upload never got uploaded.

Every time I got this message: ""The torrent you are trying to upload has the private-bit set, this means it will not work with DHT, please recreate it without the private torrent option.""

The thing is, it's NOT set private.  I didn't do anything differently from how I created the first 9 torrents I uploaded here.

It's frustrating, but as things stand now... I am effectively ""banned"" from uploading at The Pirate Bay.

Any suggestions?  Anything else in particular you are doing new since the demise of Mininova?

Well, all the best.  Keep spreadin' the word!"

Until a half-hour ago, I had never noticed that TPB even had a forum!
