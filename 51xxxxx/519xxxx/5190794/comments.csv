,Doom93,2009-12-05T22:45Z,PLS can someone upload the pal version
,koko-goal,2009-12-12T04:57Z,"I don't get it..how?
this game will release on 2010"
,koko-goal,2009-12-12T05:07Z,"sorry, i thought this one is RE remake not Zero..

thanks for this torrent"
,koko-goal,2009-12-21T04:34Z,"Worked. Thank you.

The game speed is a little bit better than the original one GC version."
,frednot,2009-12-22T18:29Z,"Can anyone verify that this is the game that will bre released in late Jan 2010, or if its not that game, which game is it?!? "
,ThatNYCGuy,2010-02-23T01:43Z,"Its a remake of the GameCube version by the same name ""RE: Zero"" if your refering to RE 5 then no this is not it."
,ThatNYCGuy,2010-02-23T01:47Z,"A port i shoulda said, not a remake. All in all a very good resident evil game for the wii, although find Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition to be the best RE game on the wii. The chronicles versions suck balls with that house of the dead point and shoot style. This and RE4 Wii are top notch."

I received a letter from my isp threatening to cut off my service because of copyright infringment. And on that note can anyone recommend to me some sort of IP blocker so I won't have to deal with these douches anymore? Oh and thanks to Morck22 for the upload, its not his fault."
,crispykiller96,2011-03-31T01:54Z,Thanks for that cancelled download also peerblock is a gd alternative to peerguardian 2 
,Keithuk,2012-06-02T03:47Z,It works a treat on a 4.3E with USB Loader GX.
