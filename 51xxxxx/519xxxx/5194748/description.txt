One of the best symphonic-metal disks ever, I think. Impressive music, impressive almost opera vocal! This disk I can put near my collection of Nightwish disks (when they have Tarja Turunen as vocalist). 
This work of Luca Turilli is much better  then anything was created in Rhapsody (of Fire).

All tracks are separate & with tags. Ripped by EAC. All pictures in booklet is 300 pixels/inch.
If you want to burn this CD, you can download cole2K Nero audio plug-in (google helps you), or use alcohol, EAC  etc. 
I can't seed all the time, but I'll seed every night, till someone downloads. Just wait. I'll be happy if you seed few days after download.
If you think you want something else, just tell me here.

P.S. Sorry for my bad English. I'm Russian.
