I just wanted to ask you though, i run a windows computer, and i downloaded your HR basic windows piz encoding, and i finally got it to work fine, however when i uploaded the movies onto my ipod there was pixel distortion and it was showing a pretty fuzzy image at times, and the sound wasnt very good. even though it seemed to play fine on my computer.

Do you think you know why this would have happened? do you know anything that could improve this? or do you think it is just simply because windows isnt as good as encoding videos the way you do as other OS'? 

i would greatly appreciate it if you could get back to me on this one as it would help a lot.

Thanks once again for all your releases, youve done some really great work!"

Thanks for your help HR, greatly appreciated... seriously"
