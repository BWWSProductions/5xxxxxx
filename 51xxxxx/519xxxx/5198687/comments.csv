,gamefreakskater,2009-12-13T20:03Z,can't get it to work with HDLoader
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-17T00:59Z,"only been tested on a modbo 4.0 chipped ps2,
(Mod-Chipped) works fine with mine.

Some games won't work with hdloader I think
and some games don't work with fmcb.

A modded ps2 or swap magic should get it working."

,heroxXx,2010-12-05T10:04Z,"hi, is this the FULL game that includes everything like the Original DVD found in stores?"
,GenesisFlux,2011-05-29T20:17Z,Do I have to do anything special with Free MCBOOT to get this to run? Would be handy before downloading.
,TheXDark1x,2011-09-05T20:46Z,@GenesisFlux Just patch it with ESR and burn it with DVD decrypter and ur good.
