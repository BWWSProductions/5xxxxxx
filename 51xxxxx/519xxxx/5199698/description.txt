Having returned to power, Death Eaters attack both the Muggle and Wizarding
worlds, while Lord Voldemort has given Draco Malfoy an assignment. Bellatrix
Lestrange goads Severus Snape into making an Unbreakable Vow with Draco's
mother, Narcissa, to protect Draco and carry out the assignment if he fails. Scarred
by his experience at the Ministry of Magic with Voldemort, Harry is reluctant to
return to school. Dumbledore brings Harry to entice former Potions Professor
Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts. Later, while leaving Fred and George's
new shop in Diagon Alley, Harry, Ron and Hermione notice Draco associating with
Bellatrix Lestrange, Fenrir Greyback and Narcissa Malfoy in Borgin and Burkes,
leaving Harry suspicious. He attempts to eavesdrop on Malfoy on the Hogwarts
Express, but Draco petrifies Harry. He is rescued by Luna Lovegood and her
Spectrespecs.
