My first and likely only torrent. This is the soundtrack from the latest Legend of Spyro games (A new beginning, Eternal Night, Dawn of the Dragon). Most of this has been ripped from Rebecca Kneubuhl's website. So in the case of the ED soundtrack, the selection is limited. Beggars can't be choosers. Enjoy!
