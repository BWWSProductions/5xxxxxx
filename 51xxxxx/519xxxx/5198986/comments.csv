,stoogejunky,2010-01-06T20:27Z,I dont want to cause a problem and piss anyone off asking this question here but honestly don't know where else too ask! Anyway here goes. I have a hauppauge Win tv HVR-1250 capture card and I am using Media centre as a DVR anyway I want to know what I should be using to convert these to get the same size and quality your using. I am sorry if this is not where you want this coment but again I have no clue as to where I can. Thanks in advanced stoogejunky Also wanted to thank you for all the ups you and others like you have given us.
