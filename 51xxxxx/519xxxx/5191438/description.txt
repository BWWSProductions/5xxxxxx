             Foxit Reader is a PDF document viewer, with                      
             incredible small size, breezing-fast launch speed                
             and rich feature set. Foxit Reader supports Windows              
             2000/XP/2003/Vista. Its core function is compatible              
             with PDF Standard 1.7.                                           
                                                                              
             In the past, you've had to download a huge PDF                   
             reader from another software company, go through a               
             lengthy installation process and wait for an                     
             annoying splash window to disappear just to open a               
             PDF document. Moreover, if you want to annotate a                
             PDF document, you have to pay US$299 to buy certain              
             software.
