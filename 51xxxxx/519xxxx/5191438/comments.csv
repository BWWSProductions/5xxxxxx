,jaymac407,2009-12-19T01:49Z,Only a FUCKING RETARD would pack a release this way. Why the FUCK put a RAR inside a RAR inside another RAR? What. The. Fuck.

,Ign0tus,2010-02-25T15:15Z,"The included frpkey.txt is not valid. I have the correct version installed, but the key says it's expired or incorrect. In addition, virustotal uses 41 engines to scan for viruses and 24 of those detected a backdoor trojan in the included ""crack"" file ""foxit reader.exe"". Pretty much what ""Penga"" said in regards to the trojan (Backdoor.Win32.Rbot.ahin). It could be because the file is patched, but I'm not risking it. All that should be required to make it work is the correct frpkey.txt file and then tell your firewall to not allow foxit reader.exe to access the Internet."
