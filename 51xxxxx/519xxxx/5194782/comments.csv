,henderson_exp,2009-12-03T21:33Z,Anyone know I can set the upload speed alot higher(I'm using utorrent)?.  Right now I'm seeding about 56kb and think alot of you would much appreciate a much higher speed
,yazovyet,2009-12-03T21:54Z,"preferences, bandwidth. 
it would have been nice to put this in 2 files (ep11 and ep12) since ep11 is floating around already. 
lastly i am a skeptic so i will wait for others ot say if its real befoire i jump on the DL."
