The Things We Left Behind' was produced by Blue Rodeo at the bandâ€™s Woodshed studios in downtown Toronto. The album opens with the sound of tympanis heralding the title track â€œAll The Things That Are Left Behind,â€ and it is immediately clear that you are listening to a Blue Rodeo album like no other. â€œItâ€™s not like weâ€™re going for a skate and just singing a whole pile of Blue Rodeo songs,â€ boasts Keelor wryly. â€œThere are a few curve balls on this record.â€

Ballads such as â€œIn My Bones,â€ â€œGossipâ€ and â€œWaiting For The Worldâ€ contain some of the strongest performances of the groupâ€™s career while songs such as â€œMillion Milesâ€ and â€œShebaâ€ bare the unmistakable influence of groups like Fairport Convention and The Rolling Stones respectively. Keelorâ€™s â€œNever Look Backâ€ reprises the sound of his and Jimâ€™s pre-Rodeo post punk band the Hi Fiâ€™s while quoting the Everly Brothers. Cuddy steps up with a couple of great road songs, â€œCandiceâ€ and â€œArizona Dust,â€ written during the bandâ€™s U.S. tour last year.
