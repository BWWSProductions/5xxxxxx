,darrencaf,2009-12-05T18:54Z,"wyoranger it should work but so far only 128mb of the file has been uploaded, for some reason only at 1kb/s.  I will keep this one alive for at least 6 months so don't worry you'll get it eventually.  Let me know when you have all of it"
,Wablo,2010-01-03T07:29Z,"Firstly thanks to the OP Darrencaf, i will keep seeding this for as long as my HDD stays alive.

For anyone who wants to know, these books were written by Spike Milligan about his part in WW2. They are read by the author and were written in this order;

1. Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1971)

2. ""Rommel?"" ""Gunner Who?"" (1974)

3. Monty: His Part in My Victory (1976)
(This and the previous two books were released and publicised as the first, second and third part respectively of a trilogy.)

4. Mussolini: His Part in My Downfall (1978)
(This was announced as the fourth part of his ""increasingly misnamed"" trilogy.)

5. Where Have All the Bullets Gone? (1985)

6. Goodbye Soldier (1986)

*7. Peace Work (1992) (Not with this torrent)

These books are fantastic, and do not necessarily need to be read in order (although i would recommend it) or all together, so don't worry about the final book being missing, it will not detract from the enjoyment you will get from this download.

For those who are serious about comedy, the importance of Spike Milligan can be summed up by a comment i saw recently on BBC News by Micheal Palin, where he explained that - ""All we were really doing in Monty Python was trying to copy Spike!""

A genuis, and sadly missed. 


Again, thanks very much to the OP for this torrent, i've been looking for this for a while. Cheers :)"
,darrencaf,2010-01-09T16:12Z,"WABLO  cheers mate I too was looking for this for ages and it took me months to put it together as one collection.  I didn't know about 'Peacework 1992', I'll try and get that and release it or add it to a new torrent.  Happy 2010 everyone"
,thunderbum,2010-05-26T07:39Z,"Many thanks for this collection! I've been a Spike Milligan fan for a very long time.

Would you - or anyone have the 'Peace Work'? I've looked up and down (and Googled) but it's not to be found."
