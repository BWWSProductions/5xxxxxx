,bordrx,2009-12-06T20:45Z,"It's out of synch *at times* not all the way through

And top/bottom of the screen were cropped (presumably to eradicate some copyright message) you 're missing like 50 pixels or so. But overall it's watchable"

,ThaDrizzle,2009-12-08T08:31Z,"I'm w/ tann on that one black.  Jennifer Aniston doesn't have to show what we all know she has in spades anyways.  I think it's called ""class"". (Drives you crazy huh?) Nun-the-less, we all have our opinions....just giving mine.
On the audio sync thing:  Y'all really outta read up on what goes into providing all this content for people who seem quite unappreciative. Then, just may-bee; You would know that some things can actually be corrected on your side to accommodate the freaky settings on your PC.  
Again...No offense just venting I guess. Oh, and BTW Jennifer Anniston: 2009's voted sexiest woman/body withstanding the test of time or w/e.  ie. SHE's HOT~~~~!"
,Lumpy_Chewbacca,2009-12-24T08:22Z,The audio is pretty terrible

,Scooter_Magee,2010-03-08T01:05Z,"Hey Black andbad, does the bad in your username stand for bad taste?  Jennifer Aniston is a class act.  She is a great actress and a good person and will be remembered long after u are gone.  "
