Terry Fell's legacy consists almost entirely of the song "Truck Driving Man," a standard that has been recorded by countless country artists after being revived by Buck Owens in the '60s. Fell's original 1954 RCA version is a harmonica-driven stomper with all-star accompanists. The other 23 tracks on this collection of Fell's '50s recordings are mostly hillbilly novelties, including his sole hit, "Don't Drop It," which features the sort of nonsense vocalizing that later became Del Reeves' trademark. Terry Fell was a capable but not particularly distinctive vocalist who is remembered more for his songwriting than his recordings, but if you're crazy about '50s country you'll enjoy almost everything on Truck Driving Man. ~ Greg Adams
