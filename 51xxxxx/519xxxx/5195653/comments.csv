,Hotter1nc,2009-12-04T08:42Z,Is this loader also usegul to activate Windows Enterprise?
,ContraXC,2009-12-04T08:49Z,"Yes, it should be working with all versions of Windows."
,Talking_Evil,2009-12-04T18:43Z,"Hi, this might sound like a Dumb Question, but can I keep XP Pro and Install Windows 7 Ultimate too?, if it automatically finds active boot Partition? I'm a newbie at this Stuff so please bare with me.
{Peace}"
,Hanto1952,2009-12-04T20:28Z,"  Thank you ContraXC, this is the only Win 7 loader that I have been able to get to work as advertised. Must have been my fault. And what is REALLY amazing is that there is absolutely no sign of viral or trojan activity according to www.virustotal.com and my own investigations. 
  Thanks again."
,ContraXC,2009-12-05T09:09Z,"@Talking_Evil: I actually never tried it but I guess it'll work out for you. Just create a new partition and install an unactivated copy of Windows 7, then use the Loader to activate it. Feel free to comment back."
,jgripp81,2009-12-08T18:18Z,"so how do i know if this worked? i unzipped it, it ran and had me restart. is that all there is to it?"
,deathwisher08,2009-12-08T20:39Z,does this loader work on rtm?
,ContraXC,2009-12-09T06:13Z,"@jgripp81: right click on ""My Computer"" and then select ""Properties"". It should say that your Windows is activated after a reboot.

@deathwisher08: It works for all versions, bits, and types except for Windows 7 Enterprise I think."
,SpiritWolfe,2009-12-09T12:08Z,Does it matter what key we use? I saw a couple of different keys available for Win7 Ultimate.
,nemesis2445,2009-12-09T22:22Z,Daz iz the bezt. so far his loaders are the only one that work and don't cause my computer to lock up on reboot (grld still in memory after restart?)
,ContraXC,2009-12-10T03:10Z,@SpiritWolfe: It doesn't matter which key you use as long as it's not blacklisted. :D
,cwgate,2009-12-26T07:15Z,Excellent! Works fine on Win 7 64bit.
,debauchlord,2010-01-13T20:27Z,"I've gotten this to work several times. Yet now on a new machine its hanging at a cursor at boot. Any ideas or recommendations as to what possible problems are?

I have a AMD phenom, on a GeForce MB, 2 SATA drives, installed Windows 7 x64 Ultimate on a clean disk."
,ContraXC,2010-01-21T07:40Z,"@debauchlord: It is best to contact Daz for support regarding any issues activating Windows 7 using his loader.

Alternatively, you can also try the keys I have uploaded in this torrent here http://www.thepiratebay.org/torrent/5295934/Windows_7_Keys_in_a_Text_File 

Be sure to report back!"
