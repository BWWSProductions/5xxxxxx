This software let's you use video files to motivate your little kids to do educational games like basic math, spelling, counting, etc.  Basically the little kid wants to watch the cartoon, but in order to watch a few minutes of cartoons they have to complete a certain number of educational games.  It works great with my kid.

This program does require a license, but you can just request another license every 10 days (basically nagware).

This is version 95, recent changes include improved word matching game and added capability of assigning different costs to different videos (in case you have some educational videos that you want to make cost less for example).
