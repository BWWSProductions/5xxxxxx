,Artyx_6,2009-12-03T08:57Z,"Oh, you lost this race. Well.. There is always next time :D"
[T],keka_umans,2009-12-03T09:03Z,yea i know right...i think you still all get it from me anyway. as long as it gets up tho i don't really mind. my goal is sharing
,Artyx_6,2009-12-03T09:30Z,"Yep, sharing is caring :) Year ago there was only 1 uploader (if i remember correctly), and now there is 3. Every 3 has nice sum of seeder/leechers, so they really arenÂ´t going to waste. Taking these from you feels so familliar so IÂ´ll keep coming back. "
,marodi,2009-12-03T12:11Z,"Thank you so very much! Also, would it be too much to ask if it would be possible for you to upload Ghost Hunters Academy? Please pretty please? (insert pleading puppy eyes)"
