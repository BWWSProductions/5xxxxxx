Final Fantasy VIII Extended DVD Edition
Special thanks to vetropir for providing me with the original torrent description.

This fan-made upgrade to FF8 for the PC was on this site before, but taken down due to improper compression.  I was able to snag a copy before it was deleted, and after verifying how badass it is, I'm uploading it for you all following the site's guidelines.

Features:
â€¢ Full install 2.2 GB, DVD not needed.
â€¢ Half automated CD-swap-emulator via hot-key.
â€¢ Supports XP / Vista / Win7 - 32/64.
â€¢ Supports ALL types of TFT displays, including native wide screen.
â€¢ AA support.
â€¢ Character Editor (also accessible via hot-key).
â€¢ HQ-PDF Manual.
â€¢ HQ-PDF Strategy Guide.

Ingame hot-keys
â€¢ CTRL ALT 1 = on the fly CD1 emulating.
â€¢ CTRL ALT 2 = on the fly CD2 emulating.
â€¢ CTRL ALT 3 = on the fly CD3 emulating.
â€¢ CTRL ALT 4 = on the fly CD4 emulating.
â€¢ CTRL ALT C = calls the Character Editor, FF8 minimizes.
â€¢ CTRL ALT M = calls the HQ-PDF Manual, FF8 minimizes (will not work if Adobe Acrobat is already open).
â€¢ CTRL ALT S = calls the HQ-PDF Strategy Guide (same as above).
â€¢ ALT F4 = Quick Exit (works MUCH better than the game's native Ctrl Q).
â€¢ NOTE: Alt Tab DOES NOT WORK.  Ctrl Alt Del will still minimize the game, however.

Other Features
â€¢ Greater Stability
â€¢ Pre-patched? - This I don't know for sure, as I haven't had much of a chance to play around with it, but I believe all the crashes and terrible glitches have already been patched; you should be able to just install and play like I did.  If not, there are plenty of torrents on this site with all the fixes.
â€¢ New Config - The only time you really need to use the game's built in config is to set up your controls.  There is a new config accessed via ff8_launcher.exe that allows for higher screen resolutions that match most modern computers.  I was able to play this on my laptop at 1280 x 800, and it looked beautiful (better than the PSX version does on my TV) and ran without any troubles.

Installation
â€¢ Mount with a virtual CD/DVD-drive emulator, or burn and put into your physical drive.
â€¢ Install the game.
â€¢ Install Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable (x32/x64) if needed (if it comes up asking you to "Repair" or "Uninstall", you don't need to install.
â€¢ Unmount or remove the DVD and play.

Some other things to note
â€¢ ALWAYS run the game from ff8_launcher.exe.  AWAYS.
â€¢ When playing on higher resolutions, FMVs glitch a little bit as they end (they shrink to a corner before disappearing and gameplay resumes).  This is just a minor cosmetic annoyance, and doesn't affect gameplay at all, but it was still something of note.
â€¢ Game installs with a save in Slot 1, File 1 (for those that which to skip the opening sequence) and Slot 2, File 1 (to test the in game CD swapping).

The original torrent file spoke of some trouble with Nvidia GeForce cards.  I have a GeForce in both my laptop and my Vista desktop, and never ran into trouble.  If anyone does have trouble, I'll copy/paste this information into the description.
