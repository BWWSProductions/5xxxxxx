,ahray,2009-12-01T21:24Z,damn...this is badass
,matelian,2009-12-02T09:06Z,"what is the texture quality for this game ??

and how good it will be on a 1440x900 screen ?"
,DirtyFinger,2009-12-02T16:08Z,"This works on Windows 7. Even with Geforce cards. :)

and using higher resolutions works, too, although there's not much point since the flat background graphics are intended for 640x480. The polygon characters are in high resolution, however.

Thanks for the release!

[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-12-02T17:34Z,"Other Features
? Greater Stability
? Pre-patched? - This I don't know for sure, as I haven't had much of a chance to play around with it, but I believe all the crashes and terrible glitches have already been patched; you should be able to just install and play like I did.  If not, there are plenty of torrents on this site with all the fixes.
? New Config - The only time you really need to use the game's built in config is to set up your controls.  There is a new config accessed via ff8_launcher.exe that allows for higher screen resolutions that match most modern computers.  I was able to play this on my laptop at 1280 x 800, and it looked beautiful (better than the PSX version does on my TV) and ran without any troubles

read all the description 
but i have to say that this release is by far the best for the pc so happy gaming"
,tommymcgee,2009-12-02T19:11Z,"this isn't working for me. i mount it with daemon and try to open it/run it and nothing happens, it just freezes. i have waited for like 10 minutes and nothing. am i missing something? i've never had any problems mounting things before"
,shawshankredemption,2009-12-02T19:59Z,"I have the same problem. I mount it but when I click the setup, nothing happens.. Is this fake?"
,shawshankredemption,2009-12-02T20:04Z,I take back what I just said.. it just started installing.. I'll let you guys know if it works alright.
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-12-02T20:38Z,"Some other things to note
? ALWAYS run the game from ff8_launcher.exe.  AWAYS."
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-12-02T21:01Z,also try burning image to dvd if you have trouble mounting it but guys it does work i dont upload fake or none working games 
,tommymcgee,2009-12-03T06:07Z,"yeah it worked for me, it just took like 20 minutes. most likely because of my antivirus i guess, but game works and runs perfectly. thanks!"
,LiamH123,2009-12-03T15:38Z,what are the differences in this game to the original?
,cloud2819,2009-12-04T17:08Z,"downloaded and isntalled great but everytime i get to a certain part it will crash

right as siefer walks in the room when he is named squadleader for the seed field exam "
,SterKoop,2009-12-05T17:57Z,"Hey! great game and works well. althou gives a virus alike problem. Somehow the ""on the fly cd-emulation"" goes on with startup and when you press some of the designated keycombinations eg. Ctrl+Alt+2 it'll runs the cdswap emulation. Couldn't find solution for this yet. Pretty pissed of cuz cant write email, have to copy paste the ""at"" mark all the time. "
,Apalala,2009-12-06T04:27Z,Great torrent.  I can't get the on the fly emulation to work though.  Any way around this?
,shawshankredemption,2009-12-06T21:55Z,The game works but it does freeze up from time to time and always on the same locations in the game. That sucks but you can play further after a while. Now I've come to disc 2 but I don't know how to.. the game keeps telling me it is the wrong disc.. :s someone please help..
,Reanky,2009-12-08T01:48Z,"For those who can't switch disks via the hotkeys: Go to the installation folder then open the folder named CDx. Copy the files in the CDx folder to the main install folder. When you need to switch disks just minimize FF8 (via ctrl alt del), run the corresponding CD#.bat. Open FF8 back up and just push the select button."
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-12-08T02:26Z,thanks for helping peeps out Reanky 
,shawshankredemption,2009-12-08T13:49Z,Thanks for helping but it still doesn't work.. :s I can't open the cd2.bat file..
,Reanky,2009-12-09T08:44Z,"Ok, if you still can't get the disks to switch, try this: When the game asks for another disk. Minimize the game and go to the folder you installed FF8 into (has the FF8_launcher.exe and so on). There is a file named JUST ""DISK1"". Rename the file to DISK#. So if you need disk 2 then rename the file to DISK2. Then just maximize FF8 and continue. This method has worked for me on two different computers.  Good luck."
,shawshankredemption,2009-12-09T14:45Z,"Yes, it works! :D thank you so much Reanky, you rock!^^"
,nanoc_t2,2009-12-12T01:12Z,Anyone else get a crash on disk2 when squall wakes up? I cant seem to get past that part always crashes. :(
,Nokutisu,2009-12-13T19:44Z,"How do you get the In Game Commands to work?

,SterKoop,2009-12-19T11:45Z,"Hey! i still have not been able to disable the SO CALLED "" on the fly cd- emulation"" plz help and tell me how to disable it. Or just tell me how to disable the hotkeys.  everything works fine otherwise."
,KillaKidB,2009-12-21T01:07Z,This Better fakkin work lol this is my 4th attempt at finding a working FF8 torrent all the other have been fake or they dont work on my pc vista 64-bit but if you guys read this plz continue to upload at unlim speed if you can afford to and ty For the Game DJDavastate
,Sampaaa,2009-12-28T02:53Z,Why do I load it and it plays cycle of end credits? Please help!!
,Naygath,2010-12-15T18:39Z,"IMPORTANT:
all you who have problems with altgr+1,2,3 etc. (cant type ""@"" after installing this game) right click the ff8 shortcuts on windows start menu and select properties, after that you will know how to fix the problem... i spend 30 mins searching this info and now that i found how to fix this problem i thought i should share it with you all. -Naygath"
,Horadrim,2011-03-27T22:48Z,"In-game buttons problem.
How to fix it?"
,lewkadook,2011-04-13T04:53Z,Can we get a few seeds on this please? 
,RazerWolf,2011-07-21T00:33Z,"If you're having problems with the on-the-fly disc emulation, or the batch files not working, etc, there seems to be a million problems with the batch files. As far as I can tell, batch file syntax is CASE SENSITIVE so the .bat files should read ""ren"" as ""REN""; they don't include a file path so they're targeting a file that's not there, and even with that fixed the in-game hot-keys don't fucking work. Any of them, as far as I can find. 

Manually changing FILE? with the needed disc number does work though, so yeah.

Apart from that, and the game randomly disappearing or resetting to menu, which I'm not sure whether or not is due to something I've done, this is a good, working torrent."
,nongam,2012-03-14T00:44Z,"Please seed, this goes as slow as god knows what, and it's my last chance to play this awesome game's second disk."
