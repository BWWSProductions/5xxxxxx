http://findpassword.net/unlock-pdf-password-to-open-print-and-edit-password-protected-pdf-file/
To assure PDF files safety, many users often decrypt their PDF documents using strong password protection. They may set a user password, which is used to restrict opening the PDF file itself. Or they may set an owner password, which is required when somebody tries to copy, edit or print the password protected PDF file. "

Copy and paste the information into notepad, go to file, save as the first line I write which tells you what the batch does with .bat at the END! VERY IMPORTANT! 

Then run the new batch file in the same location as the program with the PDF to have the password removed."
