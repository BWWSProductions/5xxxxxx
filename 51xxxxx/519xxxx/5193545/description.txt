Ready or Not is an about two best friends who are both quite different from each-other in every way. Amanda Zimm is Jewish. Her parents are divorced and she lives with her mother, but still sees her father. She is an only child. She is a pretty young girl who is interested in boys, drama, poetry and shopping. Elizabeth Ramone or Busy as everyone calls her is Italian. She is a tomboy who is interested in sports and playing the drums. She comes from a big family and lives with her parents who own a meat shop. She has three older brothers. Laura Bertram and Lani Billard play Amanda and Busy. They both give great performances in each episode. Ready or Not is a brilliant teen show from the 90's which is still great to watch.
