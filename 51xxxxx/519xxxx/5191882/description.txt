Jack Hody Johnson (born May 18, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, filmmaker, and surfer known for his work in the soft rock and acoustic genres. He achieved commercial success after the release of his debut album, Brushfire Fairytales in 2001. He has since released four more albums and a number of EPs. He is well known for his annual event the "Kokua Festival" where all the money earned goes back to the community. He often invites other celebrities like Dave Matthews to perform at this event.

Johnson's songwriting influences growing up included Bob Dylan, Nick Drake, Cat Stevens, Ben Harper, Fugazi, The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Jimmy Buffett, Bob Marley, Neil Young, Sublime, and A Tribe Called Quest.

Johnson graduated from Kahuku High School on the North Shore of Oahu. He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he began to develop his passion for music. He graduated with a degree in film. His first breakthrough came after he befriended G. Love on a day of surfing. G. Love would later record Johnson's song â€œRodeo Clownsâ€ for his 1999 album Philadelphonic. Johnson sang and played on the track, and it became the first single from the album. His four-track demo soon caught the ears of Ben Harper's producer and right-hand man, J. P. Plunier, who worked with Johnson on his debut album Brushfire Fairytales in early 2001 with Harper and his Weissenborn lap steel guitar making a guest appearance. Johnson also played rhythm guitar for the party band Soil while he attended UC Santa Barbara.

A chronicle of Johnson's 2008 European tour will be released as En Concert, a CDâ€“DVD package on October 27, 2009, according to DirectCurrentMusic.com. The DVD comes via En Concert, a documentary film directed by Brushfire Records co-founder Emmett Malloy.
