Has anyone else tested the launcher.exe file and found the same trojan?"
,RobertBrink,2009-12-19T22:35Z,"A-Squared also confirms. It's other name is Trojan.Crypt.IK

It's not a false positive. It tried to get past my firewall. One hundred percent guarantee this is a real trojan. Almost all the patches out there are infected with it.

Enjoy your status as a bot."

No, they are not, that is only false positives. Almost (if not all really) all patches (cracks) gets false positives!
IF it tries to access the net, just BLOCK it ... doh!"
