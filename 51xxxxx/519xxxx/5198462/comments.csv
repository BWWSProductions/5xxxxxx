As Far As I Know, One Of The Source Of This Movie Has Some Quality Issue i.e. Some Pixelation Etc.
I Have One 720p 2.5GB Rip.
Its So Ruined Mostly Because Of Source.
So I Will Go For This.
Hope It Is From Another Source.



P.S. Thanks Again For All Your Hard Works.

though i already have both parts in 720p (2gb each).
for those who may want the 2nd one, search for
""predator duology"" on h.3.3.t. :)"

,Kira93,2009-12-26T18:41Z,"Hey there. i just wondered why i cant run this video in media player classic and windows media player 10. 

I would really appriciate a quick answer ! :)"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-03T04:12Z,Maybe you don't have the right codecs...I don't know.Just download kmplayer and you'll be fine:D
,davitodude,2010-01-04T03:01Z,Just use VLC media player. It comes packed with every codec you'll ever need. AND IT'S FREE!

,stanger19,2010-01-17T02:14Z,"Cheers for the great upload, excellent quality.

FYI, this doesnt work on ps3, not sure why, but im thinking its something minor, as the ps3 supports the formats used, but from personal experience the ps3 is picky and not the best media player...."
