,madman359,2009-12-04T18:42Z,Wowee! Thanks for the upload RJ! :D
,SamanthaSweet,2010-03-07T20:05Z,"Rosebud.  It's his sled from childhood.  Also, it's WR Hearst's nickname for his mistress (rosebud refers to her coochie) who Orson Welles based this film on.  Of course, everyone knows this.  This film is a hundred years old!"
,dank_nug,2010-04-25T17:22Z,"you fucking faggot samanthasweet. Dont ruin the god damn movie on the torrent page. If i wanted a damn spoiler then i would go to imdb. i know its old as fuck but have some etiquette, bitch... "
,antonioq,2010-04-30T08:11Z,I agree with dank_nug. Comments should be reserved for the quality of the upload in terms of audio and video. I hate when people write about how they liked the film itself. Even worse is when someone spoils a movie by revealing something in the comment. SamanthaSweet should be banned from this site. Dumbass...
,darshon,2010-05-29T22:31Z,ppl plz write abt AV quality and Stop being IMDB
,ookamo,2011-05-02T03:07Z,"Ugh, why not give away the sixth sense too."
,ATLdev,2011-06-22T08:15Z,samanthasweet you fucking bitch i just waited 4 hours for this movie to download and figured i'd check the comments to see if there were any other people experiencing a slow download and you RUINED IT. I'll tell you what everyone knows and its that you're a fucking skank slut bitch
,Kara-kan,2011-06-30T15:31Z,"Has this version interlacing problems, too, as the other one with so many seeders?"
,gharaz,2011-07-12T04:23Z,"audio 9
video 8 (a couple of interlacing problems)"
,ramessesthegreat,2011-08-18T04:58Z,"Yeah, totally out of order putting a spoiler like that. Could RJ someone indicate that there's a big ugly spoiler in the comments, if it's impossible to delete it? I can see how that could really ruin the film for some people. "
,rjogadiya,2012-05-28T12:11Z,"I guest, nobody has control over the posting of comments, lets ignore ones we dont want to look at..
for quicker downloads to rest of our fellows.. seed more.. video quality is bad as its a very old movie however i feel the audio is remarkably good..
