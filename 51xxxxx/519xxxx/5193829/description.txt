A Ben Garchar Film

Run to Me Run from Me is an unforgiving candid story of love, lust, desire, and the fluid boundaries of identity. The story unfolds as a high school track athlete is stuck in a world of anorexia and a sexual fantasy with whose terms he finds increasingly difficult to reconcile.


Reviews

There is no sanitizing of this white suburban landscape as Garchar embraces postmodern sensibilities with a skilled hand in which the young actors, drawn from a casting call of students at a Cincinnati performing arts conservatory, are realistically awkward and emotionally blunt.

I really liked your movie. Had a great tone to it. The music had a cool Eno vibe and the editing was terrific and simple with a strong ambiguity left at the end. A great use of the short film form.
