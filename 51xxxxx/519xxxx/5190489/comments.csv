Seems like most lecheers moved from Mini to TPB! LOL!

BTW, there is one torrent site www.torrentzap.com, which is very similar theme of Mininova. Maybe you might give it a try, and I noticed all your previous torrents are uploaded there already.

[V],Team_xRG,2009-12-01T18:22Z,"its true 
NOTE : I have tested this on the PS3 and Xbox and works fine.
I have noticed lots of nobs are posting fakes using my name only grab films from genuine SecretMyth, MajorTJKong and LifeChanger accounts or straight from the source  
http://www.kingdom-kvcd.net

this is given by secretmyth in every torrent read the info

I created an account here just to post comments for you and appreciate your efforts."

,gibbo79,2009-12-02T13:29Z,A big thank you to the best uploader out there.
,oOMMOo,2009-12-03T03:17Z,"Keep up the great work! thnx!

I notice the bluray cover indicates a 2d and 3d version. can you upload the 3d version also? thnx. :)"
,IS-118,2009-12-08T03:15Z,"Thanks Man!
:-)"
,Movieguy26,2009-12-25T18:22Z,"I love Secretmyth's rips because they have high resolution (1280x544,720, etc.) without the HUGE file sizes of 4gb-8gb+. If I downloaded regular blu ray rips like that my bandwith would be used up by now. Plus I can fit alot of these on my hard drives. Still looking for the classics but newer movies are OK. 

They play fine on my dual core laptop with KMplayer, even though sometimes I get lag but it goes away after a bit.

Thanks!"
