The trio of Apparat and Modeselektor have once again teamed up to create Moderat, their full-length debut.

The unlikely pairing of electro crunk hipsters Modeselektor and the relatively laidback Sascha Ring only yielded an EP in 2002 when they got together to collaborate on some music. And when their solo careers took off, the idea of joining forces was shelved indefinitely. Late last year, however, they found themselves with some time on their hands and got back in the studio once again to craft Moderat, an all-analog album recorded in the same Berlin studio that housed David Bowie as he put Heroes to tape.

Per usual, the collaborators have invited even more collaborators. On vocal duties, we have Paul St. Hilaire, indie rapper Busdriver, DellÃ© and Ring himself. And, as if that weren't enough outside help, lead single "Rusty Nails" will feature remixes from Booka Shade and Shackleton, while Modeselektor's visual buddies Pfadfinderei will provide a music videos and more exclusive content for a planned DVD release of the album.
