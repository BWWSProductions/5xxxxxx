A born storyteller, Lakeman regales us with tales of piracy and whale hunting (there's a coastal theme at play), encounters with tangle-haired temptresses and frightful demons roaming the moors. Lakeman's vocal style remains muscular but lithe, and together with his brother Sean, who plays and produces, has upgraded his sound nicely. It's still acoustic, dominated by Lakeman's fiddle playing, but the drums and bodhran thump louder, the guitars thrum more insistently, and there are some neat flourishes on banjo, slide guitar and mandolin.
