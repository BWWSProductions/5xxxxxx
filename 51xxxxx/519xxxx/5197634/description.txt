        Close those windows

Step 2. If you are running 10.4 or 10.5
        Open up the game by double clicking on the app
        Enjoy the game!
       (Upgrade your Mac to 10.6 it's awesome!)

Step 3. If you are running 10.6 (If you know you've done this before, ignore it, move to step 4)
        Open up terminal from /Applications/Utilities/ 
        On the first line enter "cd /usr/bin" and press enter
        Once it's done what it's doing (less than 1 second) paste sudo mv quartz-wm quartz-wm.bak and press return. Enter your admin password.
        Wait until it's done its thing once again and then paste: sudo lipo -thin i386 quartz-wm.bak -output quartz-wm
        Close that Terminal Window

Step 4. If you are running 10.6 Open the game in 32-Bit mode
        Open up terminal from /Applications/Utilities/ 
        Paste: VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes
        Then right click on the game and click "Show Package Contents" 
        Navigate to Contents/Mac OS (Orange)
        Drag "Modern Warfare 2" into the terminal window 
        Press return
        The game should now launch
        enjoy!

For the Game Files, if you have a version of the game but are struggling, you can get them from inside the Cider Port of the game. Take the files from Contents/Recourses/transgaming/drive_c/ 

Other notes
This game works 100% with the retail and other versions of the game that don't require Steam. Steam versions probably will work, but they're a pain in the backside to install. 

There're some slight graphical issues when you do stupid things with the settings - playing High at a good resolution with most of the advanced stuff left works just fine. Normal users will find no problems. 

Please note 10.6 Users (Snow Leopard) you HAVE to follow the instructions in the "installation notes" section or the game will not launch!
