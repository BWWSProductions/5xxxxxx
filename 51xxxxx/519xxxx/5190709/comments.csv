,dlarrym,2009-12-01T22:42Z,"This looks suspeciously like a 1992 film called ""The Bad Lieutenant"". It takes place in New York City not New Orleans and it stars HARVEY KEITEL as the BAD LIEUTENANT"" Not Nick Cage, and Harvey Keitel's character is investigating the killing/murder of five nuns at different catholic churches where this 2009 version has cage investigating the murder of five Senegalese immigrants. How this Lieutenant is able to investigate anything while using heroin (I.V. style), cocaine, screwing hookers, screwing hookers and shooting speedballs with them and he also has a gambling habit... and he even pulls over 2 teenagers by forcing them to the road side with his squad car & lights, then he makes them stay in there car and talk dirty to him while he jerks off in front of these 2 teens and screams threats of arresting them if they don't also WATCH him jerking off till he shoots his wad, then walks away, pulling his pants up and drives off with a demented look on his face. He is always planting evidence, stealing drugs from crime scenes, making the local dealers hit him off with huge amounts of cocaine... like several ounces 2 or 3 times a week (That is how much this guy was using!!!!!!) Heroin is also on his list of addictions and using by injection no less.  He is also smoking crack and did I mention he gambles with the same bookies he should be busting. He has like 40k riding on the last of 4 possible games of the Major League BASEBALL PENNANT Race. He looses 1 game after another and the bets he makes keep going up as well so if he wins, he will still have something left after he wins (IF he WINS.... which he doesn't and looses EVERY GAME Needless to say he goes out with a BANG. from his bookies hit men. He ended up owing this bookie like 230,000.00 US dollars!!!! He knows he doesn't have it and basically parks in front of his bookies high Rise apartments in NY and waits, knowing at any time he would be shot..... and thats it.... This 1992 movie is AWESOME but is almost so VULGAR that it is hard to watch. If a cop or anyone did what he does to those 2 teens, I do NOT care if hes is a detective for the police, I'd Kill the guy.... but I see NO reason why a remake was made??? Even if it is only loosely based off the 1992 film, I still see no need for a remake. Go see the 1992 version then see this one, and see if you agree. I left out so many details so if you think what I have said is a spoiler, your wrong... go see it and you'll know what I mean."

Yes it is a remake, hardly the first time someone has done that and even changed the story around a little.  It is not exactly impressive reading others trying to show some insight to the 92 version, gosh how enlightened you are.  Anyways remakes are just that so originality is out the window, no shit Sherlock.... 

If people want actual online critiques of a film they normally go to imdb or similar, look at overall ratings and read others comments along with actual critics comments

Thanks SwagFlu for an evaluation of the quality, I saw some comments on other downloads that stopped me in my tracks as there was some question marks"
