The band have been in the studio since 2008 working on the album. After touring was completed for their previous album, Shine On, the band took a short break.

Various tracks that are featured on the album were played at this concert including the first single "She's a Genius".

The track "K.I.A (Killed in Action)" was added to Jet's website in early April 2009. Altsounds.com first reported on the album in late April 2009 - drawing on information from the leaked press kit and providing the image of the album cover.
