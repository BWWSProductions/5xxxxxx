,BG174,2009-12-05T03:18Z,"DM(DK):  I always have problems with that photomaze site.  What I figured out is that if you replace the string ""?v="" in the URL with ""images"", the image will pop right up.  So, photomaze.net/?v=blonde... becomes photomaze.net/images/blonde...  Give it a try, it should work.  "
