The first in the George Gently series.  Set in 1964 in Northumberland, UK.  George Gently is on the point of retiring when his wife is murdered.  In his journey to find his wife's killer he winds up in Northumberland and decides to stay.  He decides that the local sargeant has need of a mentor.  Forthright and honest = strong moral fiber, etc.  A continuation of John Deed's character but now named George Gently.  And as police inspecteur instead of Judge.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  There are seven episodes.  I will upload them as they come off the TV only we do need SEEDERS..
