I just have a question! or request maybe!
would you be interested in unploading the same movie but without english subs hard coded?
or would that be to much to ask? just so people from other countries like myself and many others could put their own subs without english subs underneath! its anoing having both!

thanks anyway for all your ups!

Thanks for your efforts"
,MrDeX420,2012-01-27T05:54Z,"@ CarlisleLuver; To seed is to not stop the download after it's finished. If you use uTorrent, once it's done it will continue to upload and display ""seeding"" in the progress bar. FYI"
,On_my_way,2012-05-15T04:46Z,"Quality superb: V 10, A 9
Although the movie is fairly good, it's much better than Brad Pitt's other movies.
Thanks!"
