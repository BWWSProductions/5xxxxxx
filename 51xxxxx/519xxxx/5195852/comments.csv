,MrBean99999,2010-01-23T11:47Z,"I have 3,44 Gb plug-ins for After Effect. I have scanned them for virus and removed all that I found. I use the most popular, like Trapcode, BCC6, Twixtor, Sapphire and a bunch other in CS4 and they work perfect, have not tested all.
Then I also have tons of other nice stuff for videoproduction, like all major sound effects librarys. Anyone want me to create a torrent let me know"
