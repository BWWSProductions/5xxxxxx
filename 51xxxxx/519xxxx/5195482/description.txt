             *Note 1: The game installs two (2) `Gemsweeper.exe'              
             files. If you don't replace the correct one you are              
             going to get an error about a file missing.                      
             *Note 2: Only the installer is multilingual, not the             
             game.                                                            
             1. After installing replace the `Gemsweeper.exe' that            
             is located in the *ui* directory here: C:Program                
             FilesGemsweeperuiGemsweeper.exe  (not here:                   
             C:Program FilesGemsweeperGemsweeper.exe) ,with the            
             one enclosed in the Crack directory.

           that we actually use. We are, and always will be, a small          
           tight group of friends respectful of every member.
