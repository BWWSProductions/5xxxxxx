    Like every iPhone (or iPod touch) out there, yours happens to have    
    secret weapon slots. You can arm them to fight off ninja ghosts,      
    battle bunnies and whatever other baddies might cross your way.       
    Didnt know that? Well, then its time to try it out! Get this        
    great game and start the addicting hunt for new weapons and           
    upgrades for your iPhone. Fight your way through all four episodes,   
    earn money and buy new defense systems. Beat all boss enemies until   
    you reach the epic final 100 levels. In the beginning you can only    
    throw small tennis balls at your enemies and hope that they start     
    crying from that. Later youll be able to buy bigger things. Those
