,yonigs,2009-12-09T02:32Z,"i'm having the same problem...
once i click the EXE. an error message shows up saying ""The requested operation needs elevation""

is this not compatible with vista?"
,its_kristy,2010-01-03T16:35Z,"""Requires Elevation"" is a symptom of the increased security measures that have been implemented in Windows Vista. It's all part of the same concept that has you confirming that you are the administrator over and over again.

In other words, ""Requires Elevation"" is a part of what's called ""User Access Control"" or UAC.

There are two or three approaches to dealing with the message.

?

The term ""elevation"" simply means that you need a ""higher"" level of access to the system than you currently have. The privileges associated with your current login need to be temporarily raised or ""elevated"" to a more privileged or powerful level.

In practice, all this really means is that you need to be the administrator, or that you need to allow the program trying to run to elevate itself to administrative privileges by typing in the administrator password."
