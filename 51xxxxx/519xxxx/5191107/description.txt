Regarding the size, theres no reason for it to be any bigger because
it is a relatively short animated movie. Likewise, theres no reason
why SEPTiCs 720p rip needed to be DVD size. 2240MB would have been
plenty. The rules clearly state that animated movies are allowed less
than 4MB/s and in this case, the movie compresses too well for it to
require more bitrate.
