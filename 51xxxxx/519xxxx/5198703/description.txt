Rating:        M (Mature)
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works. 
(Burn Tested on a ModBo 4.0 Chipped Ps2)


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.



Game Description:

Run Like Hell is a survival horror game.

You are Captain Nicholas Conner, a former pilot who works on a space station, involved in a project funded by the government. You travel between planets on mundane assignments, only to return to your home station to find the place a complete wreck, courtesy of an evil alien race. All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell.

RLH encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter. You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened.

Enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small "grunt" type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you. Each has it's own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge.

In a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn't much puzzle solving and not much slow times. The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title. When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked... that's why you must "run like hell".

RLH features celebrity voice actors, such as Lance Henriksen (Frank Black from TV's "Millenium"), Michael Ironside (bad guy from Total Recall), Kate Mulgrew (Star Trek Voyager's Captain Janeway) and Brad Douriff, the voice of Chucky from the Child's Play movies.

You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.


Features:

* A thrilling 3rd person sci-fi adventure. 

* An intense storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat. 

* Incredible voice-acting work by top Hollywood talent including Lance Henriksen, 
  Kate Mulgrew, Clancy   Brown and more. 

* Intelligent alien foes that learn from your actions to become even more 
  dangerous. 

* 7 gripping chapters of action-packed gameplay. 

* The powerful game engine brings to life characters, objects and environments in
