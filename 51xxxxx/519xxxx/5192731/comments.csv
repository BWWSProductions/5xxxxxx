  ""For people who still play this""

LOL, because games nowadays are always released with a ton of bugs, I always wait a couple of months before starting with a game. Often there will be some patches then that makes the game playable.

So, maybe I'll start playing this game.

Thanks to the developers, the crackers, the uploaders and TPB."

No virus!"
,torrtruk,2010-02-09T18:01Z,"hi all. Thanks for the crack.

But the update patch is not running properly.
It starts, flashes for a millisecond and closes immediately. I don't know what's happening.

I'm on winxp sp3. I've already patched the game with version 1.01

Any help/suggestions are greatly appreciated."
