    Each level in Star Paint is dynamically created, offering a new       
    puzzle each time you play. Stars will appear on the screen, with      
    lines connecting each one. Move the stars until none of the lines     
    are crossing to clear the level. Sound easy? Watch your time,         
    because if you take too long, it's game over. To help, use            
    multiple fingers to grab and move different stars at the same         
    time. Make it through normal and medium modes and you'll unlock       
    Hard mode - turning off the timer, and opening up some really         
    devious puzzles.
