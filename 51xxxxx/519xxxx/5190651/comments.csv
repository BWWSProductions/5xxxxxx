,ndame121,2011-03-05T05:15Z,If you cant figure out how to license it with the crack just right click the windows info file in the crack folder and  select open with then choose notepad and open it. Once open follow instructions in installation notes worked great for me except took me a few minutes to activate. overall nice job mate.
