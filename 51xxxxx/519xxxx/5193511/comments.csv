,Drunkenmunkey,2009-12-03T13:20Z,"Real copy. cam of course.

A=8
V=6

Sound seemed a bit off in spots but other then that its watchable"
,deedeeunome,2009-12-04T02:36Z,"Missing a few minutes in the middle.  

IMDB runtime of 88 min, here at 74 min. Still pretty watchable."
,drcat125,2009-12-04T12:22Z,"how can yall say it is good 

it is just like men stare at goats or blindside

this is crap"
,Drunkenmunkey,2009-12-05T01:31Z,i never said it was good. i said it was watchable. 
,pjthunder,2009-12-07T23:02Z,What the f*&k is with these morons putting half movies up there? Do you idiots not know when the end of the movie is? Here's a hint...it's when the credits roll...duh...geezus somebody needs to bitchslap these drips...!!
,Juggalo559M,2009-12-08T22:30Z,damn theirs no ending and no middle part? what i find funny is how torrent sites are letting this happen! people who even think of posting half movies should get banned basically! this is why i wait until a R5 is released and funnier thing about R5 now theirs a lot of people who are releasing them with crappy audio! now those should really get banned!
