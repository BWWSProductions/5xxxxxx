"Time To Go" is a heartfelt acoustic piano and guitar song that features Keane's lead singer (Tom Chaplin) showing off the vocals that Keane is known for. The song was written about Chaplin's abusive use of alcohol and drugs, which landed him in rehabilitation in 2006. The song has been recently featured in commercials for the series finale of "Monk".
