Hello pirate bay! this is my first torrent, so i hope i did it all correctly.

This is Daria seasons one to five with the pilot and "look back in annoyance"
When I tried to zip it, it went really small. 
good for downloading, but I don't know if the quality will be terribly good. I don't remember where I got these from originally.
I will seed this as much as I can, but seeing as it is only 20mb it shouldn't take long to download.
NOTE: It extracts to 12GB, so be prepared for that.

Please seed, and look for more torrents in the future.

(I did not upload it to the correct section because TPB wouldnt let me upload a .zip file to it)

p.s. what do I put for trackers?(I'm new to the uploading part)
