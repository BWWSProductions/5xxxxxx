,rogue6666,2009-12-06T11:18Z,Thanks very much!
,BasilBrush,2009-12-06T12:33Z,I encoded this and the 2 IBU races all together - that took about 9 hours. The encoding finished about 1am this morning.
,BasilBrush,2009-12-06T20:32Z,"I missed this race:
FIS World Cup Cross-Country Team Sprint Dusseldorf (6th Dec 2009)

It wasn't marked as ""live"". It started at 5:30pm GMT and lasted 30 minutes - obviously recorded from earlier on."
,partizan77,2010-03-02T22:50Z,Absolutely there is no speed !
,omzig,2010-09-14T06:53Z,Tank you! Do you have the sprint from dusseldorf from earlier years ?
