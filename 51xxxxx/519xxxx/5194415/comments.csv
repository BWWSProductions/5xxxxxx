,viper4o,2010-03-11T06:59Z,I am with windows vista. I install it without a problem. But when i select it from the aircraft menu (to begin flying ). The game just stop working and shows dont send. I really want to fly with this airplane pls help me. I have had PMDG MD11 and PMDG 747 and i was not heaving problems with them. Is there something with the regedit or... ? 
,JasonVoorhees95,2010-03-27T11:16Z,"viper4o:I think that ur fsx crashes,that's because u haven't followed the installation readme step by step.I suggest u to reinstall it and be more carefull(i had the same problem with you).If the problem persists,then put a message and i'll do my best!!"

,Jens9515,2010-08-12T19:33Z,"Hello every one! I have downloaded this PMDG MD-11 cracked version thing, and I was wondering if any one of you maybe could answer me why the elevator gets stuck up and down depending on what way I move the stick after a while of flying, and that I cant control the thruttles(speeds) with my joystick.. I more likely have to use the keyboard to force it down.. Does anyone know the answer on how to fix it, just leave a responsive message, thank you! and by the way, how can i update the cracked md11 version to a newer version without the FSX to crash. I have tried to update it normal, but then FSX just crashed and i had to reinstall the whole game for just a little update.. off.. Please answer anyone..:) "

,bxreppin,2012-04-04T22:58Z,J41 works perfectly.  I use it most of the time.  Updated Nav Data for the fmc to get the most recent sids and stars.    All lights work.  Great Torrent.  SP1 is available here as well.  just search.
