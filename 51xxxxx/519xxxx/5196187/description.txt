I'm sick of removed rapid & other share links so here is torrent for everyone.
Upload speed sucks so have patience. 


In this demonstration the instructor starts off by giving a detailed explanation of commonly used material nodes. Once the foundation is laid its on to creating several full materials using only a few textures. This tutorial is appropriate for artists on multiple skill levels.

If you have never used a material editor you should be able to follow along and understand. Even if you are experienced using the Unreal 3 material editor, you should pick up useful information throughout the DVD.
