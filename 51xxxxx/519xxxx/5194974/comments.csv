here is the translation (from russian) : the official Acer DVD disk from the ""Upgrade Windows Vista -> Windows 7"" SET!!! "

its depend upon your burner speed, the maximum speed to burn the image is on 4x when u are using nero, but the best way 2 burn it with power iso which is available in torrent file.
i suggest u to burn this with power iso, bcos it automatically set the speed limit for bootable iso files."
