    Your mission: Use the Force to overthrow the evil Galactic Empire

    of Yavin 4. As part of the Rebel Alliance's Red Squadron, you         
    dogfight with TIE fighters above the Death Star's surface before      
    heading into a trench where you are inundated by cannon fire. Dodge   
    obstacles and stay out of Darth Vader's sights as he tries to gun     
    you down before you have the chance to fire your proton torpedoes     
    into the thermal exhaust port the size of a womp rat. If successful   
    , a direct hit will cause a chain reaction that destroys the Death    
    Star, thus saving the Rebel base from impending doom. Star Wars:
