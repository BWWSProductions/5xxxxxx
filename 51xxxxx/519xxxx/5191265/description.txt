Gorgeous graphics, groovy gameplay, great game.
Those are the 6 G's!

EDIT #2 AT THE VERY BOTTOM - database error - wtf??

I originally downloaded the files here: http://f60s.com/cache/p/665911/665911.aspx
Took like forever, now i wanna share this with the community.

To install:
-Open UnRarx
-click the option "Password"; put  in "Codez4macdotcom" without quotes and with a . instead of the word dot
-wait like 20 mins
-Mount with Toast or whatever you like
-Copy & Play
-Enjoy

EDIT:
If the game asks you to update, click "yes" and install the update.
This will fix a graphical problem in the game, when playing in sunlight.
You can still play without the need of a serial or the game-dvd.

EDIT #2:
since i cant write any comments, im doing this (again)
sry for not answering ur questions - been on vacation; skiing in the alps
aowin's post is the real deal with "Codez4macdotcom" expect for there is a real . instead of the word dot between the two c's. this is the password also found on the website http://f60s.com/cache/p/665911/665911.aspx.
dont forget to update. enjoy
