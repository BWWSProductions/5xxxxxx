,fabiodrums,2009-12-02T14:55Z,works on gma x3100?
,fabiodrums,2009-12-02T14:56Z,Works on gma x3100?
,salfanar,2009-12-02T15:07Z,"as long you have a mac operating system installed, all should work well
bout the jade empire thing, i cant find it neither on the net, so the best way is probably to buy it
porting it, well didnt try that"
,moryok,2009-12-02T19:23Z,Can you please try to port jade empire special edition salfanar i would really appreciate it oh and if you decide to port it can you make it a dmg and try to get all the game cutscenes to work perfectly
,andrik55,2009-12-03T05:40Z,no seeders =/
,miknos,2009-12-03T08:04Z,"@fabiodrums:

It runs on X3100 but very slow (in lowest settings).  Believe me, not worth it."
,salfanar,2009-12-03T22:09Z,"User-added trackers can speed up your down- and upload rate
e.g. http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce or http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
lets get this game to the top10 of the mac games xD"
,andrik55,2009-12-04T00:36Z,no since its a new torrent we are going to be crawling like snails untill some people finish and seeders develop.
,miknos,2009-12-04T12:23Z,"TO UPLOADER:

Change your pier connections to 2 or 3. Upload the  FULL file to a few and they'll help you seed in beginning."
,DankoB,2009-12-05T05:41Z,"I would love to jump in on this...and I seed till I have to reboot, than I seed some more...not much sense if there is only 0.27 % of the file available...I've always had good luck after time with this site...Hopefully in a couple weeks he'll have seeded enough to complete a full copy uploaded...and then they's seed it.

How big is this game unpacked and ready to go?"
,DankoB,2009-12-05T08:56Z,I decided to download it anyway and now there is 0.29%.....fingers crossed!
,DankoB,2009-12-05T18:40Z,"I'd say by the looks of it, salfanar has decreased his peer list to about 8 but my client says it'll still be about 3 weeks before this torrent will be complete....I guess the old adage is true...patience is a virtue."
,arbnor187,2009-12-05T19:24Z,"how do i mount something with toast titianium :SSS do i need a CD?
pleas respond ive been waiting for this game for ages"
,DankoB,2009-12-05T20:24Z,"No you don't need a cd...I think Toast creates the file as a virtual cd, I haven't used Toast but basically find where it asks you to mount and image and choose the file from the finder window that pops up....you may need to enable a virtual drive.....

It looks like virtue has a price...it's $3....I just signed up to hotfile for the day and I'm currently downloading this at about 500/kbps...I'll replace those files for the ones in my client folder in a couple hours and get another full seed on this :)"
,DankoB,2009-12-06T00:36Z,I just finished the re-check seed #2 is now available

,DankoB,2009-12-06T01:52Z,"Go buy snow leopard....you don't really need to upgrade to iLife '09 first...you just won't have ""access"" to it until you install it on 10.6...we successfully went from Tiger to Leopard to Snow Leopard on my girlfriends 13"" MacBook...I was told later by a friend that it wasn't even necessary to install Leopard first...he's been a Mac user since 1998 so I trust his advice. SL will install over Tiger as long as your system specs allow it.

0 Seeders?????"
,arbnor187,2009-12-07T18:35Z,"woow i dont get how to make this game work pleas someone do a step by step thingy :S
if you can pleas make a video with screen flow it would help allot :D thank you guys."
,guess2432,2009-12-07T21:50Z,Password does not work for the lock...why even lock it?
,guess2432,2009-12-07T21:52Z,"the password is actually

pASSWORD  "
,bitumeX,2009-12-07T23:07Z,"I can't extract it, it says there is a problem with the password.

What is the actual password?

I have tried Password and pASSWORD, neither of them worked"
,aowin,2009-12-07T23:48Z,"Hmmm, after days of downloading it seems to be unusable. When I enter the password: Password, it fails directly. When I enter pASSWORD it seems to extract fine, but at the end it quits with a checksum error or says an invalid password was entered. A solution would be much appreciated."
,CSilver7,2009-12-08T01:18Z,having same problem here... pASSWORD works initially but it fails in the end... Any comment on this uploader?? I am thankful you uploaded this and been seeding it over 2 days now... Just don't understand why it isn't extracting... Does anyone have solution to this?
,andrik55,2009-12-08T02:29Z,"yea mine extracts all 8 gigs. but then just deletes the .dmg file and says ""Wrong password?"" :("
,CSilver7,2009-12-08T03:14Z,it ain't Codez4mac... anyone else have a idea?
,MrEddy,2009-12-08T03:23Z,"At this point don't waste your time d/l this there is no working PW to unrar this archive. So no point in d/l 7 Gig's of data. 

pASSWORD doesn't get past the 9th part before it errors. "
,CSilver7,2009-12-08T03:26Z,@Salfanar: Please answer us regarding the possible password for this file. 
,filomarino,2009-12-08T03:44Z,"Codez4mac (dot) com

actualy is a . "
,andrik55,2009-12-08T03:49Z,yea that worked for me --^
,andrik55,2009-12-08T04:17Z,Personal Opinion... game sucks
,Andun3,2009-12-08T04:31Z,"After trying both UnRarX and WinRAR (through Parallels) I googled some and decided to try 7-Zip. 

For some reason it worked! The password is ""Codez4mac(dot)com"" (without """" and (dot=.), no idea why it didn't work in UnRarX/WinRAR. 

If anyone wants I could upload the unrared .dmg, that way it would ""just work"". You would have to download everything again but maybe that's better than nothing at all?

Just say the word."
,bitumeX,2009-12-08T04:31Z,"andrik55, what password did you enter? I have tried everything: Codez4mac, pASSWORD and all the rest...
I am starting to feel like it is a fake..."
,CSilver7,2009-12-08T04:53Z,7 zip doesn't work for me on windows 7. I am about to delete this torrent...arg...
,CSilver7,2009-12-08T04:57Z,Yup nothing works for me... its always the part 3 that cannot be extracted... Any solution to this?? Is this game really worth installing by the way?
,Andun3,2009-12-08T05:15Z,"@CSilver7:
Try this then using UnRarX:
1. Go to UnRarX>Preferences>check ""Keep broken extracted files""
2. Click Password and put in ""Codez4mac(dot)com"" (without """" and change (dot) to . )
3. Extract

I just tried that and was able to mount the .dmg afterwards.

Tell me if it works."
,aowin,2009-12-08T12:50Z,"Did some searching and the correct password is indeed: 

Codez4maccom   case sensitive and a dot between the two c's.

That worked for me. I could mount the image successfully and copied the game to my HD.  
And... I could also play.

Now have fun:)  and thanks to the uploader!"
,aowin,2009-12-08T12:51Z,"Additional note: I used stuffit to expand, but MacPAR also did the trick. "
,arbnor187,2009-12-08T18:47Z,andum 3 can you pleas do what you said i really want this man it will really realllyyyyy help pleas and thank you if yes :)
,arbnor187,2009-12-08T23:42Z,"OK i downloaded it ITS WORKING PERFECTLY xDDD
you dont need to mount anything just istall UPDATE thats it :DD thank you"
,CSilver7,2009-12-08T23:51Z,"I can confirm Aowin's password :Codez4maccom case sensitive and a dot between the two c's.
Works. I repeat it works!!! Thanks for the solution! I am going to install it and give it a try when I get back home!"
,Andun3,2009-12-09T00:28Z,"@arbnor187: Glad it worked for you.

If anyone else is still having problems and don't mind downloading something again, theres a new torrent containing just the unrared .dmg: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5204693"
,misfisk,2009-12-09T20:07Z,"It's a good game and all, but it runs horribly slow compared to WinXP. It's the same computer, same settings, different os. That kind of sucks.."
,Andun3,2009-12-10T03:03Z,"@misfisk: Well, thats Cider for ya. Too bad since it feels better to play games in OS X then Windows."
,Bumbaz,2009-12-12T20:17Z,Seed this guys :) 1 seeder how is that possibile. Comeon
,Cajar_Queen,2009-12-18T23:20Z,"Shit of a game
My macs requirements are way beyond the minimum requirements and exceed the recommended requirements as well, yet this game plays like total crap.  No matter what level of detail set to the vocals and SFX are noticeably out of sync and movement of the charter is sluggish and laggy."
,julezhall,2010-01-03T02:07Z,"I Agree to Cajar Queen's post, my mac as well exceeds the requirements. 2.53ghz, 4gbram, 256 nvidia 9600m. And even at low levels it lags and voices are not in sync. And YES i downloaded the patch but basically fixed nothing...anyone got a idea? the point of next-gen is to experience the visuals. Cheers."
