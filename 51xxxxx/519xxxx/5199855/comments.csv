,r2007uk,2010-04-10T19:40Z,"I don't usually comment however I will make an exception here,

For ALL of you wanting to know if this is working and wether it contains any virus etc.

YES it works (I am using R4)
NO it does NOT contain virus (scanned with nod32)

Basically you get 2 .7zip files (well that is what my pc recognized the files as) Simply unzip each one and you will get:

R4-YSMenu folder & the Mario nds rom

Copy the inside Contents (TTMenu(folder) and _DS_Menu.Dat onto your SD card, along with the rom.

Turn on your DS and load the game, ENJOY.

(This does NOT freeze on the 'save' menu at start - whether it does later in the game I do not know as I am yet to play it thus far)

tl'dr =

WORKING, No Virus, No Freeze at save screen at beginning.

Enjoy, and thanks to uploader too!"

,ctqsrtq,2010-10-08T10:58Z,"THX for all comments with info about purity of exe file.
My next uploads are in .7z extension so You need to use 7z software. It is less comfortable a bit, but is more safe."
