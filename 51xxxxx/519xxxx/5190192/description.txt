"This film was shot under the supervision of the great Ritwik Ghatak. However due to politics the footage was handed over to Hari Das Gupta so that he could make it in the 'Films Division documentary mode.' However it has the great Ustad Ali Akbar Khan as musical supervisor and other performances by Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee.

Allauddin Khan was a Bengali sarod player and multi-instrumentalist and one of the greatest music teachers of the 20th Century, father of Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi and guru to Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, Vasant Rai, Pannalal Ghosh, and other influential musicians. He himself was a disciple of many great musicians, most importantly the legendary Wazir Khan"
