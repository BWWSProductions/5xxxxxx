# Synopsis: Brought up by a gangster named Bharat Malik, Shivam Pandit lives a faithless and reckless lifestyle, doing the bidding of his mentor - which also includes being a hit-man. Bharat does not get along with his brother, Raj, and nephew, Munna, who also resent the fact that Bharat trusts Shivam more than he even trusts his son, Ronnie. Shivam's life does change when he meets and falls in love with a devout Muslim woman, Aaliyah, who opens his eyes to compassion and the teachings of Pighamber Mohammad. Shivam wants to wed Aaliyah, but her father opposes this due to Shivam's criminal background, and the fact that he has been in prison twice. When Shivam insists on getting married regardless of the consequences, Aaliyah's dad aims a gun at him, but Shivam ducks and the bullet hits Aaliyah, killing her instantly. Shivam returns to his aimless lifestyle, this time in Hong Kong, still continuing to work for Bharat. When Bharat asks him to spy on his Pakistani mistress, Reema, Shivam does so, and finds out that she has a lover named Bilal. Watch what impact this information has on Bharat.
