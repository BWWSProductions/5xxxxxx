However this time I think you set the audio level too high during the transfer. The sound is very impressive but it becomes congested and breaks up at the loudest parts. Other than that, great work. Keep it up. Always look forwaed to your releases."

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-11-03T16:42Z,Good work !! Too bad that this mp4 will not play on PS3. I'm curious on what setings do you use at conversion...... and more interested on what settings are needed for this conversion so the resulted mp4 to play on PS3.  Cheers !!
