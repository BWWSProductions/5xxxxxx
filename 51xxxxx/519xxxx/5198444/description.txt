rex fs2004 features
â€“ User-friendly intuative and visually pleasing interface

â€“ Full-featured NEW built-in Weather Engine (Built on Real Life meteorological algorithms using synoptic, meso-scale, and micro environment weather formulas for Real and Custom weather)

â€“ Flight Planner (Ability to create and file a Flight Plan using true to life flight requirements)

â€“ New feature never before seen in FS2004. Sky coloring now reflects on all water surfaces during dawn and dusk hours.

â€“ Hi-definition, ultra-realistic photo-real 3D clouds (stratus, wispy, cumulus and highly realistic rendering of cirrus clouds as seen in the real world)

â€“ Sky color environments (Includes smoothing horizon transition & visibility smoothing for dawn, day, dusk & night)

â€“ Convincingly real water environments with tropical reef simulation (end user color controllable, including tropical with reef simulations, inland and ocean, wave turbulence/frequency, environment variants & coloring.

â€“ Airport environments (photo-real asphalt & concrete runway textures, new runway and ground bump-mapping, asphalt taxiways, concrete taxiways, realistic taxiway markings, airport signage and general photorealistic airport ground scenery)

â€“ Multiple variations of sun, lens flare & brand NEW lightning bolt algorithms, which creates a visually stunning array of lightning situations

â€“ Fully integrated to select Sky, Cloud, Water, Airport, and Effect Themes based upon weather situation, season, and other synoptic, meso-scale, and micro weather conditions

â€“ Enhanced Cloud Simulation to give a more 3D volumetric feel to cloud structures and the atmosphere

â€“ Lighting environments (runway lighting including simulated ground glow, stunningly realistic aircraft spotlights with variations for small to large aircraft, aircraft strobe lights, variations for add-on aircraft as well)

â€“ 3d cloud & water resolution options for performance preference

â€“ Flexibility to work in tandem with other vendor weather & texture packages
