Please tell me I'm wrong :s"
,Dutchbay,2009-12-07T01:33Z,"Just checked: the FS2004 v2.0 is 3.43 Gb. Shame, would like to thank you though."
,HeLiumz,2009-12-07T01:51Z,"Dude.. REX2.0 is for FSX. There is no REX2.0 for FS2004. It's only REX for fs9.. 

You can even see it on the rex site.. "
,HeLiumz,2009-12-07T01:52Z,I am downloading right now and well reply once done 
,waqar747,2009-12-07T10:36Z,"Error 2350 in installation. rexfs2.cab is corrupt.

,Evertie,2009-12-12T09:36Z,"For me its working, just install it, don't unpack all .cab files in the same folder or something like that but just run the installer and make sure the .cab files and the installer are in the same folder otherwise the installer can't find them."
,flypaul,2009-12-12T16:59Z,Dont download! this FUCKA it has a FSX WORM!! so go fuck urself!!!
,HeLiumz,2009-12-13T05:54Z,"Its working 100%! Thanks a lot! flypaul, ur idiot. Obviously this software is created for FS2004 so why wud it do something with FSX?"
,codgecodge,2009-12-13T12:11Z,"Thankyou Blablounet. To those that say thank you now go and buy me A320-go buy it your selves and then you can all jerk off together!
Ungrateful little shits"
,flypaul,2009-12-13T12:12Z,well why when i click on the desktop icon it dissapears! and i cant find it? and when i run my virus checker it comes up with FSX REAL WORM? and MS UPDATER (CRITICAL) only happens when i try to run this downloader! explain that??
,Bob_Oblaw,2009-12-13T21:29Z,"Awww, codgecodge, are you a sad little boy that people aren't sucking the uploaders uncut cock like you are?

While you're on your knee's though, I have a job for you, when you're done with Blablounet that is...I'm not one to cockblock (literally in this case!)."
,virkel,2009-12-14T14:12Z,"Right listen up...

The QW 757 and AS 320 will not be around here for a LONG time. I know because I was one of the people that used to put stuff here for you guys (had account removed....long story).

The AS uses a new type of live protection that's going to take a long time to come up with a work around for. Sad but true.

The QW 757 uses the essellerate protection that you might recognise form the cloud9 and FSDT sceneries. You'll remember how long these took to crack in the first place so expect it to take that long again. Infact the latest FSDT scenery 'las vegas' is still to be properly cracked for FS9.

So your options are either to wait it out however long it might be or to go and buy them unfortunately. 

There's NO point in keeping requesting them though as the cracked software just doesn't exist yet. I promise you that within a week or so of it being cracked it will end up on TPB. Just don't know when that will be."
,kart2009,2009-12-15T00:31Z,"Wonderful addon, anyone have FS2004 Elemental Pack : Natural, Intense and Vintage."
,RID2,2009-12-17T00:25Z,"It works, but the WX engine after updating will play around with AI aircraft. 

Personally don't see much in the difference between this and freeware stuff from flightsim.com or avsim.com There is a freeware called HDE which will give you HD clouds as well. If you haven't seen it, check it out. There are others that will give you real lightning, taxiways, etc as well. 

The big difference is the wx engine in here and perhaps that damn low level fog can be mitigated using REX's engine. REX also supports updates from the VATSIM wx servers. "
,Evertie,2009-12-17T17:45Z,"@ RID2: This is not any better then freeware stuff? Dude, you must check the HD clouds, water improvements and the sky coloring feature which is new to FS2004. Try theme creation to see these textures and you must be sure to install them. The weather engine will be updated because a lot of people are having problems with it."
,Mister_Toine,2009-12-21T14:32Z,Does the Real World Weather feature works??
,flypaul,2009-12-28T13:36Z,DONT INSTALL! i have had 5 REX/WORMS off this download when you have installed! you get em as soon as you click on the file exe!
