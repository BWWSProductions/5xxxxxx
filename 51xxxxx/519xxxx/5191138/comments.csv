,yuna27,2010-01-28T14:42Z,"Oh man, I'm so sad.
When I saw ""core 2 duo 2.4 ghz"", I thought I was safe with my E6300 DUAL CORE 2.8ghz. But nope.
I guess dual core isn't the same as core2duo. Even with more Ghz, the game was unplayable, even on the lowest graphic settings.
Extreme popups, the road that looks transparant, framerate dropping as low as 4 fps, impossible to play on my comp. Damned!

This game puts HIGH demands if you ask me.

I know the standard todat becomes a quadcore cpu and 1gb of vram, but when even the minimum system specs to run on the most ugly graphics is above a comp that is just 6 months old, I sigh."

,GustavBecker99,2010-02-02T06:25Z,"For A Game of this stature, you need to have a desktop; or a state of the art, expensive as hell, laptop. The laptop would be an Alienware, quad-core, with 4 to 8 GB of RAM; net cost...$2700. Or, Choose what I opted for, and purchase a 64bit HP desktop, 1Terrabyte Hard drive, 8GB RAM, QuadCore Intel CPU at 2.33Ghz each, and purchase a pci express 16 ATI graphics card with 512MB memory. With this, you can take full advantage of ANY game, with everything set to their maximum graphics capabilities, and not drop a single frame... smooth sailing indeed! Just hope this info helps any frustrated gamer. Oh! Almost forgot to supply the desktop route pricing: desktop, $590; 21"" HP monitor, $160, ATI Graphics card, $170; netting: $960 approx.; much less than the laptop option. You'll never be able to play ANY game coming out with a dual-core laptop. Besides, laptops are cool, but the damn things oveerheat too much and destroy themselves in the process. Good Luck...
