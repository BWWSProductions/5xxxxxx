Hour 2: 

Emily and Sarah Kunstler will discuss the new film about their dad "William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe." This fantastic documentary is about activist lawyer William Kunstler-director of the ACLU, defender of the Chicago Seven, subject of FBI surveillance, mediator at the Attica uprising, lawyer for Abbie Hoffman and Lenny Bruce. Equally fantastic is that this film was created after Kunstler's death in 1995 by his two daughters, Emily and Sarah, who, without the gauze of familial loyalty, explore the evolution of a complicated man-their father -- who was both a strident idealist and a blatant hypocrite, a selfless activist and a camera-loving egotist, a revered hero and a despised villain. It's a wonderful, weird, and very American story.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
