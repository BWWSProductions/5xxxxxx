And I have a powerful computer, Intel Core I7 920. Does this happend because it is very compressed, so the file size shall be as low as possible. Can i convert it to something that makes it easy to edit, and not much loss of quality? I do not care if the file size then become very big, I have enough space.

By the way, you are a God, please, lay all these World Cup cross-country skiing/Biathlon all winther!"

The GOP factor is 250 (10 seconds) so you might have trouble cutting on exactly the point you want. With HD MKV I normally set the GOP to 100 (4 seconds). This makes it slightly easier to post-edit (remove adverts) using mkvmerge."
