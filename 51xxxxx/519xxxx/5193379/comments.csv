,zuriki,2010-02-23T09:55Z,everyone needs to see this 10 episodes all perfect plays perfect hd with vlc media player thank you for this
,bossman187uk,2010-02-24T19:57Z,"Very good indeed, plays perfect and a lot of footage iv not seen before.

World at war series is very good also.

Be advised this is heavily slanted to the American conflicts in the war, no footage of Russians and very little British. Expected of the yanks though I guess"
,whutdufuk,2010-02-24T21:59Z,@Gilvin: I just looked at ep10. I see WWII in HD... not sure what the fuck you're talking about.
,hockeyboii91,2010-04-12T03:30Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED its going at like 13 kb/s
,Gordonfan817,2010-04-25T02:59Z,"Downloading now and looking forward to watching. Thanks for the upload!
@bossman187uk, if it was a Russian or British production, you'd see the same thing in favor of the home country. I don't know why you would think otherwise..."
,Fantria,2010-05-29T18:04Z,"in reply to bossman187uk....   it's an american made documentary...why wouldn't it be slanted toward the american conflicts?  the documentary is following AMERICAN soldiers....i dont get why that's surprising to anyone.... i'm sure if the russians made this doc...it most certainly would be ""slanted"" towards russian conflicts....no?

,AKOB47,2010-12-27T18:36Z,"how do i make it play in windows media player, its saying this is a .mkv file, and i dont know what that is, can anyone help me???"
,morphirr,2011-01-15T19:22Z,Thanks needed an AC3 Codec to stream sound to Wii @AKOB47  install a codec
,inunotaisho,2011-12-03T22:04Z,"The footage is great but overall its just a attempt of american self-promoting. 
All the prelude events to the war and axis operations are mentioned so hastily you hear no more of it after 1st episode.

watch it if you feel good from jerking off americans"
,Dutch-Guy,2012-02-25T14:16Z,"I'm glad you've uploading this file, many thanks for you!"
,Dutch-Guy,2012-02-25T14:17Z,"@AKOB47, Use VLC player, it almost can stream everything."
