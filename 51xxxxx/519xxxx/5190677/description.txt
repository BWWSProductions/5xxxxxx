A collection of Mac Classic Digital Imaging software (for use in OS 9)

Please download the Screenshot PNG that is in the folder FIRST.

This is a reasonably big download with limited appeal, and therefore few seeders.

Decide that you want the contents before downloading the entire .DMG

The screenshot shows the expanded contents of all the folders on the .dmg

Obviously you will not be able to mount the .dmg in os9, you will have to burn it to DVD first on a mac running OSX.

Still searching for Raster Plus or FilmMagic, both used to control Polaroid Digital Palette slide printers, to add to this collection, anyone?
