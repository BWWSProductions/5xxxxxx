But keep in mind that I'm sourcing this from my home office. So it may, or better yet, will take a while to get it."

I often notice that many of the downloaders for my music torrent are from distant and varied lands, and i like to think that colections like these really help people create art on older but still quite usefull hardware.

Rock On"

Tks"
