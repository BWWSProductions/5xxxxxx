,w00t13,2009-12-05T07:45Z,"For one, the 1010 version is outdated...1011 is newer, meaning glitches/bugs were patched.

Yes, it works. I have had a friend personally download this file and run it on his system (Vista). It ran without problems.

Need anymore egging on...?"
,lolmao91,2009-12-06T12:44Z,"does this work with hamachi for play with friends??
or we need a patch??"
,w00t13,2009-12-08T00:32Z,"...read the description...IT'S READY TO PLAY ONLINE.


Stop acting 5 and read...."
,kornbreak,2009-12-09T12:29Z,"Wut the fuck? Why do I need to download ur stupid mappack? Please, tell me that. I don't get it. I prefer to download other version (from no-steam.ru I guess) on that torrent tracker."
,kornbreak,2009-12-09T12:32Z,"And why do usin' archive? Mb you put sum viruses into it. Learn to how to make it right, dumbass."
,lolmao91,2009-12-09T16:43Z,"the game works perfectly, no problem, the only problem i have encountered these days, when i try to host a game is a steam's error appear...it say unknown steam error process....i think it's a crack problem...but 1011 version is the last in garena...."
,w00t13,2009-12-09T19:18Z,"""Why do I need to download ur stupid mappack?""

...>_>
So I suppose you DON'T want to play online, where 90% of the server have CUSTOM MAPS...(there's like 1 server with the pre-installed maps)

No, I did NOT put anything else besides the maps in the game. The crack is the same damn crack that EVERYONE uses, and the maps are ALL AVAILABLE ONLINE ELSEWHERE...you want to take 5 hours downloading 20 maps instead of getting well over 100 in a mere hour, be my guest.

NOT ONLY THAT, but I have SEEN people who downloaded this torrent playing on severs...they forgot to change my name in in the rev.ini so...

No STFU...you do a file scan and post it, and I BET YOUR LIFE AND YOUR ASS (lol) it's clean...):["
,w00t13,2009-12-09T19:19Z,"Oh, and the reason I put it in a .rar? BECAUSE EVERYONE CAN OPEN THOSE! Not everyone has powerISO, douchebag...-_-"
,w00t13,2009-12-09T19:23Z,"oooh! I know why Kornbreak is acting like a tool...


Because no one downloaded his lame ass screenshot torrent! I bet it had something on it too...-_-"

,kornbreak,2009-12-25T03:38Z,"I lol'd you kinda jerk man. I played KF since it came out, I got my own licensed copy of it and I DON'T EVEN PLAYED STUPID NON-ORIGINAL MAPS. Cheers with your stupid realize of this game.

,necrogen,2010-08-21T08:27Z,"Just a few quick questions from a novice at this stuff:
Will it be easy to set up LAN play with my friends? Will we need an internet connection to play?
And, will we be forced to sit at level 0, or will we level up on our own network? If we don't level, is there a way to start at level 6?
Thanks for any help."
