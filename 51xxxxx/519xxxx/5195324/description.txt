       The Bravery tried to expand their new wave-inspired dance rock on 'The Sun and the Moon' with decidedly mixed results: for every experiment that broadened their music, another left them sounding completely out of their element. With 'Stir the Blood', they return to the style they know best -- in fact, they may be even more emphatically shiny and electronic here than they were on their debut. Bravery frontman Sam Endicott co-produced the album with John Hill (who has also worked with Shakira and Santigold), and the pair coat 'Stir the Blood' in a sheen that suits the bandâ€™s more pop-oriented writing. These songs are pared down to the sharpest hooks and the most earworm-like choruses -- all the better to let the fizzing electronics take over, especially on â€œI Have Seen the Future,â€ which cruises along on a shuffle beat and laser-tag synths; meanwhile, â€œThe Spectatorâ€â€™s brooding comes wrapped in a sleek pop coating. The Bravery switches to a harder rock sound on tracks â€œHatefuckâ€ and â€œJack-O-Lantern Man", while the album's slower side allows the band to stretch a little without sounding forced. The single â€œSlow Poisonâ€ evokes 'Heroe's-era Bowie, â€œSheâ€™s So Bendableâ€ reboots the fuzzed-out chug of the Velvet Underground and â€œSugar Pillâ€ closes 'Stir the Blood' with narcotic bliss. Even on its mellower moments, The Bravery sound more excited about making music on this album than they have since their debut, making 'Stir the Blood' a fine return to form.
