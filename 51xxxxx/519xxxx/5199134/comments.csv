,fjvanmol,2009-12-20T18:50Z,Ok I give up----Name required for registration------What name??????????? I tried several variations with some serials but no luck. Is it the serials that are already no good or do I need a specific name?
,fjvanmol,2009-12-20T19:02Z,Disregard that last comment from me. Had a senior moment and all is well and working just fine. Thanks for the great download.
,wpgmb03,2009-12-23T00:40Z,"sorry for repeating the Q's, but i did what karad said and i still see the button asking to purchase new ver. after the update. 
after the register the purchase button gone away but right after update it came back.
does this mean its no longer valid or it just asking to buy newer ver.

I already had this program installed, so I just stole the serials from you..

Worked like a charm ;D

If you guys are having problems with installation/the program, just go to the website and download the program there..
Steal the serials from this torrent.

Thanks, Ahmed."
,Nbitz,2009-12-28T10:52Z,I might be wrong but I think that all the serials have been blocked.

,venkman9,2010-11-14T08:43Z,"Can someone please help.  I can load, register, and run protection mode fine for malwarebytes, but when I try to update the virus database I get error code 732 (0 0).  Ive tried changing my internet LAN settings to automatically detect settings and not go through proxy, this did not fix the problem.  I also set permissions for malwarebytes to go through the firewall and this did not fix the problem.  I used to have malwarebytes installed on here and it used to work fine, now i can't get the program to update.  I'm running 64 vista.  Can anyone please help."
