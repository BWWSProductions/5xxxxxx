God damn Eurofags..."
,codgecodge,2009-12-18T08:03Z,"Thank you, There are lots of real FS pilots that want all the airports they can get no matter where in the world they are.
Sadly most do not stop to say thanks to the uploader and I am sometimes guilty of this myself. But when I see negative cooments from some moron I want to make it clear most of us are grateful.
Thank you for sharing fscracks  \m/"
