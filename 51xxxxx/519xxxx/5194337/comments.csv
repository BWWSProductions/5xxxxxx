,metalguy1990,2009-12-08T06:39Z,How about some detailed instructions on how to make it work?
,dLusional,2010-07-30T04:42Z,"yeah how does the tool work?

I tried adding spells and stuff and changed the amount and nothing happened in the game.

I opened the game first then the editor."
,fAhd_mOLco,2010-09-22T21:56Z,another great things happen ; )
,Cstasy,2012-07-09T14:00Z,"dLusional, obviously, you have to close the game before editing a save. I'll try the tool and post a how-to of the editor in the comments."
,Cstasy,2012-07-09T16:20Z,"Alright. You need the game running, lol. So launch the game, begin to play. Go to the desktop (if you can't, use the Task Manager). Open the Editor. Begin by pushing the ""Read"" button to update the trainer. Do what you want. End with the ""Write"" button. I didn't managed to use the best weapon and all cards button atm, but it probably work too."
