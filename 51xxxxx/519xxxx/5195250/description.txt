Includes: Log/Cue

Alive 2007 is a live album released by Daft Punk on November 19, 2007 and was recorded at Bercy in Paris on June 14, 2007. I have always liked Daft Punk but this album made me love them because it showed me their talent for not only producing killer house tracks, but djing them as well. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2009. A must have for any electronic music fan, or any fan of music period.
