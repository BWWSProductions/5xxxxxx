L.E.G.I.O.N. (Licensed Extra-Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network), is a team of extraterrestrial superheroes in the DC Comics Universe. They first appeared in Invasion! #1(December 1988), and were created by Keith Giffen, Bill Mantlo and Todd McFarlane. 

The series chronicled the formation and activity of an interplanetary police force founded and led by Vril Dox (heir of Brainiac and ancestor of Brainiac 5) whose mission was to act as a peace-keeping force in the galaxy much as the Omega Men and Green Lantern Corps had done before them. They are the 20th century forerunners of the Legion of Super-Heroes, and some of the 30th century Legionnaires are descendants of L.E.G.I.O.N. members.

As a consequence of the Zero Hour event in 1994, the original title was replaced by R.E.B.E.L.S. (Revolutionary Elite Brigade to Eradicate L.E.G.I.O.N. Supremacy).  When L.E.G.I.O.N. is usurped by Vril Dox's son Lyrl, Dox and those members who remain loyal to him are forced to flee in a mysterious new ship in order to regroup and regain control of L.E.G.I.O.N.
