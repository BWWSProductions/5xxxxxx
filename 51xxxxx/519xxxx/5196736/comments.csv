[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-05T17:42Z,I forgot to crop because on my PC the movie plays without any bars so I thought there aren't any problems.From now on I will be more careful with this issue.Sorry 
,SupremeUltimatum,2009-12-31T11:37Z,"This torrent is great. Besides the two black bars on the top and bottom, which does not disturb the viewing quality, its perfect!

Audio - 10/10
Video - 10/10

If you're thinking of downloading, go on! It includes English and (some other language) subtitles!"
,.Leto.,2010-01-02T03:30Z,"thank you , really good quality :)
just a slight problem, the parts where they're speaking in Japanese are not subtitled at all"
,.Leto.,2010-01-02T04:58Z,"I started watching the movie but actually it's more than a ""slight"" problem. They speak in Japanese a lot and without the subs it's hard to watch this.
I've looked on http://www.opensubtitles.org/en but so far the ones I found don't match and can't be used because of different frame rate :("
,.Leto.,2010-01-03T06:32Z,"lol, I finally found a solution. I took the subtitles track from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5145768/The.Last.Samurai.2003.720p.BluRay.x264-DOWN
and used it for this release.
Even though that one is 5 GiB bigger, unless your nose is right on the screen, you can't tell the difference, quality is the same. So I'm keeping this one, the 7.5 GiB mkv went to the trashcan :D"
