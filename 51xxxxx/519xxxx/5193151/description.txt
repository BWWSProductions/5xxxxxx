Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulator created by Cisco Systems and provided for free distribution to faculty, students, and alumni who are or have participated in the Cisco Academy program. The purpose of Packet Tracer is to offer students and teachers a tool to learn the principles of networking as well as develop Cisco Technology specific skills.

    * RAM: 96 MB

The current version of Packet Tracer supports an array of simulated Application layer protocols, as well as basic routing with RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, to the extent required by the current CCNA curriculum. While Packet Tracer aims to provide a realistic simulation of functional networks, it should be noted that the application itself only utilizes a small number of features found within the actual hardware running a current Cisco IOS. Thus, Packet Tracer is unsuitable for modeling production networks, and at the time of this writing, unsuitable for any curriculum beyond CCNA.
