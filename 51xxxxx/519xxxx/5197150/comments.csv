,clutch5,2010-01-20T14:29Z,THERE is no way around surveys and most of them are free... u dont need to pay anything to complete it. If u have static Ip adress u can donate and ill put your ip adress in exception list .
,bben95,2010-05-02T18:45Z,theres no point downloading this its all demos
,bben95,2010-05-02T18:57Z,sorry I take back the last comment. But some of the plugins say they are for vegas 6 or 7 but I have 9 so I am not yet sure if they will work
,SlimT,2010-05-11T17:23Z,this is SOO awesome!! xD tnx alot ^^
,Grimgiz,2011-04-29T16:22Z,"Yes, i dont whanna say much about the survey   protect against bot.
and  u said most of these surveys are. that is a totall false.
70% of the surveys u get there and depeneding rom wich country u are.
are for mobile subscribers * costs alot of money* is that free i dun think so.
but anyhow second point is even if  i did the survey there is in no way of a chance that it will ever complete even if i wait  5 days...
the reason why im   writing this down now is becaus  those kind of survey are big fails
cus it realy doesnt matherh ow much surveys i get from it  or  ""real"" free ones it will never complete wich annoys me and i loved ur site alot but since that thing came up i started to dislike it.
if u whant a good anti bot protection find of something better instead please. "
,serialhacker,2011-05-20T20:59Z,What a dickhead. Using a POS torrent to advertise ur site because mummy and daddy wouldn't pay! FUS
,EmesiS,2011-09-04T00:55Z,"Yeah clutch this you fuckin wanker....take your shit some place else. TPB is for torrents, not lame ass advertising for your crap website. Go fuck yourself."
