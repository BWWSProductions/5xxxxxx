Any good book release should meet these simple requirements:

1) no scanned pages
2) mandatory selectable text

These two very basic ingredients are all that`s needed for the majority of Internet users to enjoy the book. Scanned pages are crap, they should be forbidden. Scanned pages - probably the stupidest, also a downgrade in quality. Also don`t bother with scanned pages.
Since the uploader is taking the trouble to post a good upload (and consolidate his rep :D ), it`s only a minor additional effort for him/her to convert to true PDF for that specific release.

I respect the languages of the world and their speakers but English is now the de facto standard on the Internet. Adhere to it and make the world a better place for sharing ^_^ 

P.S.

akaleeroy, could you possibly be more of an asshole?"
,sneakrnet,2010-09-22T00:29Z,"For anyone who is confused by my previous comment, I direct you to akaleeroy's comment on somebody else's movie upload here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5684443/The.Life.Of.David.Gale.2003.DVDRip.Xvid-Nile

In short, akaleeroy is one of the biggest assholes (hijos de puta, boludos, soretes) on the planet, and I just thought all of you (todo el mundo) should know about it.

akaleeroy needs to keep his arrogant, bigoted, asinine comments to himself.  If he truly wants to make the world a better place for sharing, he should go jump off a cliff."
,akaleeroy,2010-10-23T00:49Z,"That's quite some trouble you went through contradicting my comment regarding movie uploads! Impressive

However since my humble suggestions are quite reasonable and my tone isn't inappropriate, your argument is invalid.

I apologize for the scanned pages and unsearchable PDF. If anybody has the manual in a better form please come forward and let us know, it would be great to search inside the AC Manual!"

,ivan001,2011-08-17T12:13Z,"@sneakrnet: I see a lot of complaints in other people torrents but not one single torrent upload under you name. What are you, the torrent police? Why don't you go through the trouble of finding/scanning stuff, preparing a torrent, posting and seeding before you talk sh1t?
About the English language, well I can't say anything else than: ""could you possibly be more of an asshole?"".
It's not because google returns only English results to you that everyone should only post stuff in English. If you don't like the torrents you see, find another one that suits you better and respect the work someone put on their posts. Torrents don't appear on Pirate Bay out of Magic. But how could you know that.


@akaleeroy, thanks a lot for the post! I really appreciate it. I will probably buy the book soon!"
,sneakrnet,2012-03-19T04:45Z,"@ivan001,

The English language comment comes directly from akaleeroy, so I guess you agree with me that he couldn't be more of an asshole.

And I've uploaded plenty of torrents, just not here.  Living in a foreign country whose language is not mine has limited my uploads, and tpb already the things I have that I consider worth uploading.  I've also seeded terabytes of what I've downloaded here.  On many things I'm the only seeder.

One more thing, ivan001:

Go fuck yourself"
,sneakrnet,2012-03-19T04:48Z,"Oh, and ivan, thanks for all the torrents that YOU've uploaded, asshole."
,chungwa,2012-05-07T02:27Z,"Not too bothered about the book but I've enjoyed the heated slagging match above. 
Isn't the biggest share of web content actually in Chinese?  "
