This is the raw audio and drum tracks from 3 Camaro Twins songs. In ardour format and hyrdogen drums

I posted this torrent to share the files with the rest of the band easily so I am surprised to see other people downloading and seeding. There are no mp3's so if you want to listen to the tracks you will need Ardour2 available from ardour.org unless you are a Windows user. In that case, HAHAHAHAHAH!!! INYOURFACESUCKER!

We release these tracks for people to use on archive.org with a license that restricts the use to non-profit so please adhere to that rule. WE like to know when people enjoy our music and would like to use it for their projects so that we can include that in information about our tracks. 

Email johnny2k@gmail.com for more information or comments. Thanks to whoever  helps to spread our tunes. 


Thanks to Artemio for the wonderful drum kit set for Hydrogen.
