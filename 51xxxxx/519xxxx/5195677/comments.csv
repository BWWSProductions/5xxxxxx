Interesting seeing that the movie was 114 minutes long... Wonder if they have left out something here? "
[T],zerothdegree,2009-12-05T06:32Z,It's a summed up short version of the story. Part of the Read-Along Adventures a.k.a. Read-Along books series from the 1980's.  But it's read by Jeff Cohen who played Chunk in the movie.  Just a fun rareity.  Wish I actually had the book.
