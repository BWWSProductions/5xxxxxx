Like the things that the people who believe they evolved from monkeys and behave like one love to do? Example Uploading/downloading porn? Or is it molesting innocents like the godless do on the streets of Chicago and New York?

The world is in such shit today because of  people who believe that religion is nonsense. Mind you all religions are not good, but in general religion is good. But the Godless don't think so. Afterall their thinking goes if there is no God then what does it matter if I behave like a monkey with no morals living my life like the girls/boys gone wild. "

,donex7,2009-12-09T08:09Z,"unbelievers are ignorant of the true cause of this world's chaos. In fact they are  vessels in making satan's agenda: to ruin this world created by God. Is it not a shame that after these unbelievers create havoc and misery in this world, they blame it to God's people? True christians are lights of the world. unbelievers and ignorant people are thorns of this world."
,fifthdoor,2009-12-10T22:50Z,"Yes:

2 Corinthians 4:4 (New International Version)

4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

In a very real sense Satan is their god. So no wonder. "
