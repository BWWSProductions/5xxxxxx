"Rehab" is the eighth and final single taken from Rihanna's third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007) in the US and the UK. It was written by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Hannon Lane, with Timberlake and Timbaland contributing backing vocals in its bridge.

Rihanna and Justin Timberlake filmed a music video directed by Anthony Mandler for the song "Rehab" at Vasquez Rocks Park outside of Los Angeles on October 21, 2008. The video premiered November 17, 2008 on MTV.com and uses the radio edit of the song.

The video starts with Rihanna on the hood of a car in the desert with a trailer near by and Timberlake speeding towards her on a motorcycle. It proceeds to show Rihanna and Timberlake in several scenes together in the desert and inside the trailer. There are day and night scenes in the video, and different lighting and lens effects are used throughout, such as green and pink tints and black and white scenes. The scenes with Timberlake and Rihanna are often conveyed as though Rihanna is seeing her ex-boyfriend (Timberlake) everywhere and all the time.
