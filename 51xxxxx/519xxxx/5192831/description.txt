       8/? - Bagpipe Buddy
       Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the meadow.... 
       The world's favourite award winning sheep, Shaun, is back with 
       another series of hilarious farmyard antics. Having taken the 
       world by storm with the sensational slapstick comedy of his first 
       season, Shaun and his frolicsome flock return, along with the 
       Farmer and the long suffering sheepdog Bitzer, in another forty 
       fantastically funny episodes.
       
       The sheep discover a set of bagpipes on the rubbish dump which 
       they immediately misidentify as a sick emu. They set about 
       trying to nurse it back to health before releasing it back into 
       the wild.
