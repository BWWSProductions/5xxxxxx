Is it possible you can't figure out how to download a codec on to your computer that will decode the signal for you?  Like a previous poster said, you won't get anywhere trying to watch downloaded movies with microsoft's piece of shit windows media player.

The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because the ending sucked.  Not a keeper, wait for a true DVDrip.  Oh and BTW stop wasting your time and money with Nero and DVD disks.  Just stream the movie from your computer through your game console if it supports that or buy yourself a Western Digital Media Player, plug your portable drive into it and watch movies without having to worry about codecs.

Brilliant quality audio not amazing but you can still hear everything fine.

You cannot complain one tiny bit. Extremezone, your the man! (or woman)

Thanks for the upload!! "

,Thuggles,2010-04-02T03:36Z,Don't bother. Audio is shit and it cuts out during the CLIMAX of the fucking movie over an hour and a half in. And the ending is fucking garbage. Decent throwaway action movie but don't expect to see it a second time.
,Lastspark,2010-04-04T08:49Z,"Audio quality is pretty bad, has a constant hum and the end gets choppy. But for a R5, whatever. "

,kneebutt,2010-06-04T05:17Z,"So many faggots believe that if it's free the quality is irrelevant and people shouldn't complain.  But then again, they only say that because they're pathetic bottom feeding little cock suckers.  Thanks to those who left comments letting me know not to bother due to SHITHOUSE AUDIO.  I appreciate your comments as they are actually comments, as opposed to a little tribute to the wanker who posted the thread.  To the rest of you, if you're happy to fuck a fat ugly bitch when there are hot women just a 1 minute search away then good for you.  Just don't expect me to be a blind deaf retard just cos you can't do any better.   "
