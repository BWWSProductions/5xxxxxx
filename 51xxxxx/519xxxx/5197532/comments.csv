,gc7234,2010-05-22T18:14Z,"it's not working.  it downloads for a couple minutes, and then crashes :o("
,spaceoden,2010-09-19T22:40Z,Wow the rip of Bedtime for Democracy fuckin sucks. Chickenshit Conformist skips so much it sounds like some stupid remix. But all the other albums are pretty good. And thanks for including those hard to find live albums and demos.
,anony875,2011-03-03T21:57Z,"This is great! Don't listen to all the haters in here ungov... you are doing us a great service by uploading these files. Uploading this music on thepiratebay is exactly what Jello Biafra would like to see (and copying music is something that he promoted heavily throughout his career).

It honestly took me a long time to get acquainted with DK's music, but it is by-far the least money-driven music you can find out there.  While almost all musicians write their shit for fame and fortune at the expense of human decency and artistic integrity, Jello created music for the sole purpose of informing and inspiring his fans. 

Today's bands want only one thing from you: money. Justin Beiber charges $1,000 per ticket at his shows, and other bands are doing the same. Rock and roll is starting to die out and fade away, but ideas such as those of DK will live on forever and there will be others who will pick up the torch and carry on.

,1loveu3,2011-07-10T00:04Z,"Horrible torrent, trust me DO NOT download, waste of your time..."
,viking004,2011-11-06T10:58Z,"great torrent,,the tagging for all the files is good too"
,paulo_c2010,2012-01-12T18:11Z,"Thanks UNGOV, too much fuck!!!!"
,chris.s.,2012-02-05T20:21Z,"No mention of the Bitrate this ripped down to?


Guess I'll just dl it and hope it's 192 or better."
,mister_yuck,2012-02-25T13:28Z,"Thank you. I already own all of this music, I have been unable to get into my external drives for some time now due to a cord problem, but thank you for making it available in one chunk. You have made it possible for people to listen to a whole buttload of the best tunes ever by a legendary band. I hope they appreciate it."
,pxpierre,2012-03-29T23:24Z,"The SPAMMING in this torrent is incredible! There are mentions of www Anarcho Punk net EVERYWHERE!!! In ALL Album Title, in ALL song names (for ex. www Anarcho Punk net)   15 - Kidnap.mp3), and in ALL the ID3 tags: in comments and even in ALL the fuckin' GENRE tag! It takes hours to clean all that shit.

Some albums are in FLAC, bit rates are inconsistent going from 128 to 320kbps in the same fuckin album!

DK would really fuckin hate this fuckin torrent!"
,pxpierre,2012-03-29T23:29Z,"Top left, click on the 301 to see what I fuckin mean.

I hate that fuckin spamming site so much I wish I could launch a Denial of Service attack on it!"
,hedwigc,2012-05-04T08:17Z,great! thanks!
