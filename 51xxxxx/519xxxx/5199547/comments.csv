,teddydiaz,2009-12-06T12:44Z,yesssssssssssssss... finally! fiction factory! another round of beer please!
,rtrifunov,2009-12-06T13:21Z,"Thank you so much for The Sports, I can't thank you enough. I hope you'll upload The Reels' '81 album once as well.
Two more questions for you 80z. Do you have the single of Dekka Danse from 1982 called A Key for Every Occasion and some Two Minds Crack's B-sides not included on Victory Parade (1986)? I like these bands very much and think they are above-average new wave bands. 
Do you possess some neo-progressive albums from the 80s, from bands like Third Quadrant, Twelfth Night, Quasar, Comedy of Errors etc? It's not as good as new wave but it's worthy, 'cos it's from the unsurpassed 80s.
Upload everything from the 80s you have, it'll be appreciated. Thank you for the music, you've inspired people all around the world and embellished our lives in these times of bleakness."
,Atun-Bara,2009-12-06T13:40Z,"Thank you very much, you're a great uploader keep on doing this great job.

Is it possible to get English Boys - On the Edge (1980 or 81) ?
Thanks again"
,erikphnx,2009-12-06T17:18Z,"I like it when I go searching for a new 4 Rare 80s album and find a new 8 rare 80s album torrent instead.
As always, Thanks!"

,new_romantics,2009-12-07T14:56Z,"which ""spoons"" are that? Cant find this LP on All-music-guide or on discogs ?"
,sigurros999,2009-12-07T15:01Z,Oh please please please let me get what i want...all of the Waitresses records?
,Babygeorge,2009-12-07T16:47Z,"I love you 80zforever! 

Much happiness to you for all the good you do and spread around!
=)"
[V],80zforever,2009-12-07T18:09Z,"new romantic, all music guide is not a very comprehensive source of info to check older stuff as it kind of exclusively deals with mainstream garbage. Now I don't know why it's not on discogs. but here's the reference: http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/spoons/listen_to_the_city/


rtrifunov, I have some (not all) the records from those prog-rock bands you mentioned. I have listened to a wide variety of music in my lifetime including these bands. Now I need to rip these first before posting them. But they'll be posted.

Atun-Bara, yes I am sure I have your request but needs to be ripped.  stay tuned.

beatlesbuff, yes I have those, again i think i gotta rip them.


And everyone else, thanks for making a comment and enjoy the music."
[V],80zforever,2009-12-07T18:11Z,"varicose, I sent you an e-mail."
,new_romantics,2009-12-07T19:17Z,80zforever I wanna see your vinyl collection. I think you have a room extra for that?  ;-)
,revok007,2009-12-08T05:22Z,"80z, thank you so much.  This is very good stuff.  I particularly enjoyed the Fiction Factory LP, my favourite track probably being ""Time is Right"".  "
[V],80zforever,2009-12-08T19:50Z,"rtrifunov, I have the Dekka Danse single ""A Key for Every Occasion"". e-mail me at danieldking@gmail.com and I'll get it to you. As you know it's just a single and would not be a proper torrent to post. I gotta check my collection for the Two Minds Crack's B-sides not included on Victory Parade. Not positive. 

new_romantics hahaha it used to be a whole basement. Now I am digitalizing them which takes no space lol
"
,new_romantics,2009-12-09T00:08Z,"yes , 80zforever but vinyl sounds better than digitalized music. Never give away the vinyl. you will regret it."
,rockaway99,2009-12-10T06:40Z,"Thank you so much!!!
3 more albums to cross off my wish list, plus a couple that should have been on it. 

Here are some more if you can post them -

Nick Gilder - Rock America
Diesel - Watts in Tank
Jack Green - Humanesque
Qwest - Tampico Gold
Soundtrack to the movie ""Teachers""

Thanks again."
,clane76,2009-12-11T18:20Z,"Hi 80zforever,i thought id send you a big thanks for all of these fantastic 80s treats,ive downloaded many of your albums and am in the process of transferring them onto cd but i thought it was about time i sent you a special thanks for all of your generous selfless hard work,very best wishes to you"
,Kraftvox,2009-12-12T16:04Z,"I've been collecting music since the 80s and because of the internet (Torrent sites & Blogs) I have seen the level or status of what is considered rare change over the years. I remember when stuff like Act, Boytronic, Belouis Some, Kissing The Pink, Secession, and Vicious Pink were expensive and difficult to come by. Now most of the stuff is commonplace. 
These days when I find a ""Hidden Gem"" it mostly turns out to be fools gold. Sometimes a recording might be rare for a very good reason, still I keep on searching for stuff I don't have or never heard of. The bad thing is when some of the bloggers or posters fill requests it hard to take in account that most people are at different levels of knowledge or in what they are looking for to add to their collection. Sometimes I wish someone at the level of 80zforever would stick to only extremely rare recording and not get caught up in the requests. 
Over the years I?ve been hoping a definitive reference site would pop up that would display at the very least band names of 80s groups in this genre that could be used to seek out the recordings. Maybe an easy access site where people could post band names that are not listed to build it up to make a complete reference tool.  I thank people like 80zforever, mikeyten, Saltyka, NRR, Mine For Life (R.I.P.), Simon, S.O. R. Robert POLand and others for posting this level of 80s stuff so all can listen to what most of us miss or missed."
,kastlebay,2009-12-13T16:59Z,"hi 80z, again, a 1000 thanks for this upload. very nice one once more. t."
,sigurros999,2009-12-21T00:02Z,"Any chance you have ""Cat Dancer"" by Sandy Stewart...?"
,new_romantics,2009-12-22T13:05Z,"ist the ""glass museum"" LP (1984)  in mono? Can't find it again via the search engine"
,erikphnx,2009-12-26T21:29Z,rockaway99 email me @ erikphoenix437(at)gmail(dot)com  -- I can help you with the Teachers and Nick Gilder requests
