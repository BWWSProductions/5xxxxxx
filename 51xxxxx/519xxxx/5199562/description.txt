Email me if you are looking for an album in Lossless/FLAC (even obscure ones). I'd be willing to send you a link to it if you would share the album on publicbt/thepiratebay after you finish downloading it. My email: centroids1@gmail.com

Lossless/FLAC

Those who discovered Collins' music as a result of the hit "A Girl Like You" and enjoyed the disc containing it (Gorgeous George) will also find much to like here. The songwriting, vocals, and arrangements are all similar to those of its more famous successor. The opening track, "Means To An End", and the Van Morrison-like "Now That It's Love" are my personal favorites but there's plenty of other good stuff as well.
