The local highschool is threatened to be closed, unless they collect $200,000. The students' president Melissa struggles to collect the money, but lacks the support from her fellow students. So she accepts when car fetishist Dylan suggests to bet on him in car races against underworld king Phatman. At first everything goes well - too well ...  



This is the Classic movie. A must for all car buffs. The sad part is that it is 
a very small file. Good for downloads, bad for quality.

Will try for a better copy soon..
