20th Anniversary Series is the eighth album from The Bouncing Souls. Rather than a standard release, it is being released over 2009 in two forms: as 12 digital singles (released once a month) and as 4 7" singles (released once every three months). It was released on the band's own label, Chunksaah Records. In addition to the 12 tracks, 4 bonus tracks are available to those that ordered a subscription to the digital songs in January or July, which they will receive at the end of the year, and also are spread out over the 4 EPs.
