,danman91,2009-12-03T13:43Z,"hey can some one help me out with this problemo:
I have downloaded a game but all it contains is a bunch of those number files like .024 and no .rar file. Usually the games I download have some .rar files so I select em all and extract to a single folder with a .iso and a .dvd.. But this game isn't giving me that extraction option.. So can anyone tell me how to extract the .iso and the .dvd file??
(this has nothin to do with this download, its just that my game's pretty old and no one's responding on its forum...)"
,traxstar7,2009-12-03T20:45Z,"You can mark the files and rename it to .rar in the end, then extract it..."
