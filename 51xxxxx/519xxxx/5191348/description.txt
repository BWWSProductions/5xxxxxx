Here is an excerpt from George Carlin's performance at the Star Plaza Theatre on December 9, 2000. Just three tracks, but solid material not heard on any of his albums or HBO specials.

1. Good Ideas
2. Names Interest Me
3. Everyone's A Rat

Each .mp3 file is tagged and has cover art. Enjoy!

RIP George
