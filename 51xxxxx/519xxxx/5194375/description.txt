        Sixteen-year-old  Michael   escapes  the   realities  of   his
        smalltown New Zealand life by immersing himself within a world
        of maps. Yet  his seemingly-happy isolation  is broken by  the
        serendipitous arrival of two  young women into his  life. Mary
        is twenty and blind from birth, on the verge of voyaging  into
        the world on  her own. Alison  is Michael's peer,  whose grace
        betrays darker secrets. Suspended  beside it all is  Michael's
        single   mother   Amelia,  who   cherishes   her  son,   while
        simultaneously pushing him away.
