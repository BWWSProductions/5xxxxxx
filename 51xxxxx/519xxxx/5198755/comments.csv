ok, smart guy, where you found dirt 2.exe . Im searched whole game folder and there is no .exe. I think that game is not extracted fully. my game folder is 6,98 GB. but setup says that instalation is finished. Which size is your game folder?"
,freeze88,2009-12-09T23:08Z,"there are Arc.exe not Dirt2.exe,, but when i click it show nothing"
,NotSober,2009-12-10T18:06Z,"good another kaos rip to try, ill let you all know if i find the exe to play lol"
,NotSober,2009-12-10T21:47Z,C:\games\DiRT2-KaOs\dirt2.exe i don't get what the confusion is. works great ty
,erdelman,2009-12-11T07:30Z,"For some reason, some of you might not get dirt2.exe and cannot start the game, I got that problem on one of my pcs on other It installed without problems. 

If no EXE, just go to GAMECOPYWORLD and download RELOADED NO-CD/DVD fixed exe, unpack and copy/paste into directory where KAOS installer unpacked the game. Make shortcut of the dirt2.exe and play the game. 

Thanks KAOS, great job you guys do, so far you are the most reliable rippers on the scene!"
,scandle616,2009-12-12T10:43Z,"to h1n11 
the total size ov the folder is 8.95gb or 8.97gb on disk tha what it says on mine that works."
,llnation26,2009-12-12T13:54Z,"THANKS KaOs!!

to all
1) open map and click on 'INSTALL' and nothing else
2) choose your location to unrar
3) press 'unrar' (takes like 10min)
4) when done go to the map and press 'dirt2' (the one thats 72kb) to play
5) PLAY !!! 

awesome game btw "
,Magpiez,2009-12-14T09:50Z,"I have followed all the instructions and have used KaOs torrents before (MW2), but when i play the game i get the opening credits and Ken Block and Tavis Pastranas Pictures and voices, but there is no menus, and when by luck i managed to press the right button to start a race i could hear audio and see the HUD but not the other cars or the track just a black screen. Anyone have any ideas?"
,vinay86,2009-12-15T10:17Z,"Not working, I have closely monitored the extraction process after first extraction you get many files like Game - 01.kas to Game - 99.kas , after these 99 files got extracted i got close to 5.25 gb of data.

   In the next step the extraction of cars textures tracks begins and suddenly all data gets reduced to 2.69 gb which is all covered up by a file name gamedata.arc and there are many other folders like video effects actionmap etc either empty or having small sized files.
      The extraction continues and a message comes up saying duping files, but it does not dupes files and the extractor goes on to the last step of installing direct x rapture3d.

So according to me the extraction is not completing successfully there is a problem while duping files and at some point the installer deletes the files.

So kaos please devise a fix your previous rip boderlands was also having some extraction problems, i am not criticising you but you are not using the right techniques from some time because in your previous rips like fallout 3 i was having no problems.

Gansuk i appreciate you for uploading the file but  i urge you to check thoroughly by yourself before uploading."
,Unknown_Ghost,2009-12-15T16:19Z,2 things... 1: Seed please. 2: does this work with xfire?
,mycyan,2009-12-16T05:06Z,omg this sucks..i have the exe but when it just says This application has failed to start because xlive.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem. help? anyone?
,Magpiez,2009-12-16T06:50Z,seema like every1s having problems :P
,vinay86,2009-12-16T08:56Z,"@ mycyan can you tell me whats your installation size and if you are getting xlive error please install games for windows live.
          In my case the size keeps on reducing and at final size it stands at only 184 mb. clearly there is a problem in extraction, kaos please upload unpack.bat again"
,NotSober,2009-12-16T17:16Z,im not surprised kaos is talking about going private after reading some of the stupid comments you people add lol. i had this running great but the game is shit so your not missing anything.
,vinay86,2009-12-16T18:09Z,"@ notsober why are you lying here to everybody, and talking about kaos, kaos is a good uploader, his previous rips worked fine, but this one has problems.
 And the game is very good you can check on gamespot. "
,NotSober,2009-12-16T18:32Z,"im not lying my final extract size is 8.95 GB
and i got bored of the game rather quickly, it takes forever to get to race, it could do with a quickrace option. i found the executable here C:\games\DiRT2-KaOs\dirt2.exe, and i read on there website about them going private although nobody said when, and kaos is a they not a him. anything else i can correct u on?"
[V],gansuk,2009-12-17T02:51Z,"i hate to throw a spanner in this convo guyz, but your both right, this rip does work however some pcs experience arc memory fragmentation errors due to the compression level, this issue was supposed to be corrected in the new version of arc but clearly it has not. u can try installing after a reboot or try in safemode to free up everything possible."
,vinay86,2009-12-17T15:51Z,"alright guys i finally managed to get 8.75gb size but i am still stuck at dirt2 black loading screen, here is what i have done follow these steps you might be able to run the game if so tell me. here this goes:

1) Download and install the latest freearc, google it.

2) unrar manually kas dirt2.r00 all the others will get extracted automatically.

3) Now you will get unpack.bat ang 99 archives like game-01.kas so on up to game-99.kas. Run unpack.bat you will see as it unpacks data a new gamedata.arc is created whose size is increasing continuously.

4) as the extractor extracts the last archive that is game-99.kas the gamedata.arc reaches its final size that is 2.69 gb and in the extractor you will see a message i file copied after this it starts extracting cars etc at this time you hit close.

5) Now delete all the folders like actionmap etc keeping the three files gamedata.arc, arc.exe, arc.dll.

6) Now using freearc open gamedata.arc and extract to desired location after extraction you will get around 8 gb data after 1 hour. And lastly install openal directx and rapture 3d from extras folder.

Tell me if it worked  "
,fleetkid,2009-12-18T04:56Z,First time having problems with a KaOs torrent. I didn't even read the comments before downloading. Never used to have any probs. Extracted folder after unpacking is just 6.34 GB and there is not Dirt2.exe file. 
,vinay86,2009-12-18T06:58Z,"Thanks kaos and gansuk this works fine.

Guys i finally got this working the extraction takes a  lot of ram so you should turn off every running program and also defragment your drive in which you are installing. Let the extractor do its work silently. the final size is 8.57 gb

Thanks a lot kaos and gansuk keep on the good work. I apologise for my previous comments. "
,vinay86,2009-12-20T11:51Z,"@ fleetkid and everyone Do a force recheck of the data you have downloaded by right clicking on the torrent in u torrent, in my case the u torrent skipped some bytes and i got 98% after i forced rechecked i got to know this, i installed again and the installation went fine.   

This is  working SO GO FOR IT GUYS. 

MANY THANKS TO KAOS AND GANSUK."
