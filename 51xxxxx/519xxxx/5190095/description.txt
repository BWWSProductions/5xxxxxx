Yello are without doubt one of the most influential bands in the wide and open context of electronic music. From their earliest incarnation as slick Swiss guys with a strange back story making very odd disco, their music has permeated everything from comedy films to contemporary art installations. And of course: nightclubs. But the rhythm of Yello's music is just one side to their cube. Sonics, emotion, and visual elements are all equally important, something more than demonstrated on new concept album Touch Yello.

From the moment the Riviera blues of â€œYou Better Hideâ€ floats out of the speakers, everything is in place for an homage to past glories. However, Yello are one of those bands that maintain their own sound by always being different. We have Dieter Meier's half spoken lyrics tumbling out over the top of piano flourishes and electronic sax squiggles on â€œThe Expertâ€, which is held together by monstrously deep, very contemporary bass notes. â€œPart Loveâ€ exists somewhere in between soulful boogie and country guitar licks, and is the kind of song that only an act like Yello can pull off.

Coming at the end of a decade that has seen the group focusing on myriad projects, of which music was only one, the cinematic Touch Yello is still Yello in every sense of the word. Guest vocalist Heidi Happy weaves her voice through the panpipes and electronic moaning on â€œTakla Makanâ€, but the quality of the samples and arrangements stop this album from ever becoming a pastiche. My excitement to see this performed live with visual accompaniment is immense.
