,honorsparadox,2011-03-12T01:24Z,"Great DL - tho I forgot quite how AWFUL this movie is, couldn't get further than 10 minutes into it before I started gagging - this has always been one of my favorite books, I've read it 4 times, and this is Stephen King's notoriously HORRIBLY cast and TERRIBLY acted movie series' at their worst. I really don't understand how he could allow garbage like this to be made from his books... Crazy. Great DL though as always JKBlitz - not like its YOUR fault the people who made this were in Kindergarten. Thanks tho!  :)"
