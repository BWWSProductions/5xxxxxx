I do have an off topic question though, Rambam.
I remembered that you are a school teacher and am wondering if you know any good practice books for the ACT ? :\ I know it is off topic, but most of the reviews are made by students. They complian. My teachers all prefer a different one so I thought I'd ask another opinion if you could . . .  :D"
