,YoeriGod,2009-12-22T11:20Z,"Thats weird, It's working fine for me!
What OS are you using, and did you install as admin if you're using Vista or Win7, and important aswell, did you install in the right order?
Hope you can get it to work."

What the hell is wrong with you? This is a completely fine release, without any virus or something >_<

how do you seed? 

Just keep the torrent in your torrent downloading programme, and normally, it will seed automatically."
,tyco115,2010-01-04T17:44Z,"ektoblasma is right, there IS a trojan in one of the files , and I have a screenshot to prove it.

The trojan is BackDoor.Hupigon5.BXE in file ...\valve\regset.exe

Detected with AVG.

Be ready to treat it or avoid torrent altogether."
,YoeriGod,2010-01-06T10:44Z,"Loads of cracked games have a source code that can appear as a trojan on a virus scanner, this however, although it may appear different, is completely fine and working."

So what happens to the game when I tell the antivir software to cure the ""affected"" file?
The game runs fine except that for some reason I can't add any servers to the favorites list."
,YoeriGod,2010-01-16T20:25Z,"I dont know, i know that that i just scanned my pc entirely with Avira, and that it doesnt find anything,  I dont experience any problems at all for myself either, so i dont think its harmfull :)  I've had Avast! before, and that has LOTS of fake errors, so if you are using that, then id recommend changing ur virusscanner, once more, i can tell you its not harmfull, what you with that information is, however, all your choice ;)

Have fun!"
