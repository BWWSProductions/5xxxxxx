,garrisonsan,2009-12-03T05:08Z,"Thanks a bunch jwhitt!

If I may make a request, can you not modify the ID3 tags on the mp3s from their original values when you post them here?  It creates a nightmare in iTunes when it doesn't know how to organize them.

Thanks again!"
[T],jwhitt62,2009-12-03T05:52Z,"Q-Man, let me know how that goes. I'm sure I'll need your valuable experience to work the new torrent site. Thanks again for all your help."
[T],jwhitt62,2009-12-03T05:56Z,"garrisonsan: I'm sorry, but I'm completely illiterate about iTunes and ID3 tags. I download Rush's show through iTunes. I simply copy the files to a new folder and create my torrent through utorrent. I then upload the torrent. In other words, I'm not modifying the files. I could be accidentally changing something when I copy the files."
[T],jwhitt62,2009-12-03T05:58Z,con't: Llet me know what I can do to ensure the files work in iTunes.
,garrisonsan,2009-12-03T06:53Z,"jwhitt if you have an email address you don't mind sharing, I can screenshot what the files look like on my end in itunes and send it to you, so you can see what I'm talking about."

,fizdude,2009-12-03T09:06Z,"Thanks heaps jwhitt62!!  In Itunes when I clicked ""Add Folder to Library"" this one went straight to my Podcasts section whoohoo.  Some days it adds it to the Music section in Itunes but you can easily move it to your Podcast section by right clicking on your Rush Limbaugh file (in your Music section/library), Select 'Get Info', select the 'Options' tab and change Media Kind from 'Music' to 'Podcast' and off it goes to your Podcast section.  Eezy peezy."
