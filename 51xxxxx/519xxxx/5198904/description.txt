The memories of watching the TV series "The Forest Rangers" as a young child are etched vividly in my imagination. The show ran from 1964-1966 which meant I was 3-5 years old when it aired. I'm amazed how much I remember about this series. In fact, I thought I dreamt the characters up until recently when I saw it re-aired for cable syndication. Indeed, much of my early life was spent fantasizing the life of a forest ranger: reporting forest fires or crimes to the square jawed officer Sergeant Scott(Gordon Pinsent); learning native lessons from Joe Two Rivers(Michael Zenon); listening to tales told in the thick Quebecois accent of Uncle Raoul(Rolland Bedard, they say, but I was sure it was Maurice Chevalier). These three characters, even today, represent the British, Indian and French people who may often fight for separate sovereignty at times but as "The Forest Rangers" shows, these three sub-nations work best when they work together. It is good to see the series picked up by a cable company. I hope the youth of today will enjoy it as much as I did in my youth.
