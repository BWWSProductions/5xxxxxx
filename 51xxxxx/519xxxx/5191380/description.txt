The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call: New Orleans draws elements from Abel Ferrara's 1992 film Bad Lieutenant, which featured a crooked cop (Harvey Keitel) who is a drug addict and takes sexual favors as bribes.[5]

The main character is Terrence McDonagh, a New Orleans Police sergeant, who starts out as a good cop, receiving a medal and a promotion to lieutenant for heroism during Hurricane Katrina. During his heroic act, McDonagh injures his back and later becomes addicted to prescription pain medication. McDonagh struggles with addictions and finds himself involved with drug dealer Big Fate, who is suspected of murdering a family of African immigrants.
