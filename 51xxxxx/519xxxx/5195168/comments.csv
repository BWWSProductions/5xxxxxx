,Syntheros,2009-12-06T15:14Z,"Looks good, I'm still downloading, Hoping more people start seeding though, I don't want to wait 7 weeks for all this epic entertainment!"
,UnholyWrath,2009-12-10T19:57Z,"okay seriously the series is awesome.. not so sure about the english dub.. but.. it's better than reading the anime itself.. which is tiring at times..

please seed! there are a ton of us who are trying to get the rest of this and most of us are stuck at 93.9% so come on seed and i amongst others will return the favor!"
,Syntheros,2009-12-11T22:39Z,"Stuck @ 96.1% for past 4 days, please seed! 

I'm keeping this one seeding indefinitely from now on."
,UnholyWrath,2009-12-12T00:36Z,"yeah i'm with Synth on this one.. but just got stuck on 96.1% 

would love to sit and watch this sometime soon lol
got my brother started watching the series and want him to watch with me. xD"
,ihatenonseeders,2009-12-16T03:49Z,come on man seed people im stuck at 97.8% its taken all week to get that far with the 2 seeders that were seeding
,beastie6453,2009-12-18T07:54Z,Stuck on 98.1%.... =(
,UnholyWrath,2009-12-18T08:25Z,yeah i'm stuck at 98% it would be nice if the person who posted this torrent was seeding too.. would make things alot faster.. seriously almost a week and a half and still not 100% yet.. rather annoying -_-
,ShadyOne21,2009-12-18T09:25Z,yeah seriously can't this tool come back and finish seeding this poop for a day or 2 then some of us might finish
,SFGuy,2009-12-18T19:59Z,"Has anybody gotten 100% on this?  Please seed, Stuck at 98%"
,UnholyWrath,2009-12-18T22:10Z,"when i first started downloading this.. there were like 4 people at 100% and now after 98% there is no more.. it's pretty damn sad that people can't continue to seed after they finish downloading...
"
,SFGuy,2009-12-19T02:40Z,I'd be happy to seed indefinitely if I could just finish it....
,beastie6453,2009-12-20T00:15Z,Same here..
,Nate1979,2009-12-20T02:26Z,Can someone find this guy there are like 50 people at 98%. There would be easily enough to continue seeding it.
,UnholyWrath,2009-12-23T02:24Z,"so on to week two... watching as there was one seeder in the swarm yet never popped to seed for the long list of folks who are stuck at 98.3%

so what gives? seriously? Atari22 come back and seed would ya? i mean how hard is it to set your seeder up and walk away for a few hours.. at this rate a dozen people could be seeding 100% of the file.. i mean seriously now... this waiting 2 weeks is more than annoying."
,beastie6453,2009-12-24T18:23Z,"PLEASE....SEED!!! now for the tally: Downloaded 27.5gb 98.4%, uploaded 55.4gb. People obviously want this, I WANT THIS... Please, Please SEED! There could be 50 seeders after a few hours... "
,fun_killer666,2009-12-26T17:21Z,"hay if the 115 leachers are still checking this try and enter the hash number in google that will bring up every copy of this torrent with more seeders
this is the hash number
07168F2C9CC299894A632713801EEE8CAE045784"
,UnholyWrath,2009-12-27T01:57Z,"ya know i got so damn annoyed with waiting for two weeks that i turned around and went and found another download and acquired the files that i was missing in the first place.. 

as soon as i return home i will put it into a torrent file and place it on here :)"
,katiemayes,2010-07-04T10:21Z,PLEASE SEED I WANT TO WATCH ASAP!!!!!!! NOT ENOUGH SEEDERS
,Dewaholic,2010-12-06T18:07Z,This would go alot faster if folks would share at more than 5kb/sec.
,cutepadfoot,2011-02-15T04:47Z,"please, someone seed at a decent rate so a person who can actually seed back an equally decent rate will do so. this is getting ridiculous!!!"
,cutepadfoot,2011-02-16T13:43Z,"seriously still there's plenty of people on, but noone seeding more than 1kb/s. someone do something decent so it can spread out, i was pumping out 300kb/s until i matched up and now im stuck. c'mooon guys!!!"
,Dot-Hyphon,2011-05-05T15:15Z,"i was discouraged by some of the comments saying they were getting stuck at 98% and such, but after starting it i'm having no problems, plenty of people seeding at 100% now. thanks for the great torrent"
,ltsurge695,2011-07-02T02:07Z,"Are these DVD-Rips? Are they in 4:3 or 16:9?

Quality?

Come on, at least get the basics done here."
,banedraven,2011-10-05T14:55Z,"Oct/5/2011 - as of right now, I'm seeding at 80kbs (average) with seeds (80). That's just me. It took only 2 nights (sleeping 8 hours) downloading with connection speed of 15mbs. It was downloading at 1.4mbs for me. I will seed until I will seed at least 27gbs. If anyone is wondering if this will be slow or not, it wasn't at all for me. Very surprised to download 27/28 gb in two nights. Quality is standard, but should look enough for anyone, unless you're very picky about quality.

V/7 A/7 -
Very nice compilation and dedicated uploaded to get this to the speed it's out. Everyone try to seed at least a few gb's before you remove torrent. "
