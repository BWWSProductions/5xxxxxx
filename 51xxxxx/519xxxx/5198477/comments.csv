CHRISTIANS OVER THE CENTURIES HAVE MASSACRED AS SUCH AND ORDERED OR ENCOURAGED BY THE CHURCHES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND IF YOU READ THE BIBLE YOU SEE WHERE IT ALL COMES FROM, MORE MASSACRES OF CANAANITE MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN, ORDERED BY THEIR GOD (OR DEMON?)  HIMSELF... C´MON, GET A LIFE AND STOP FOOLING IGNORANT PEOPLE."

[T],IndianChristian,2009-12-06T01:28Z,"I truly believe in the Bible not because I have seen Jesus Christ or the prophets who wrote it under God's direction, but because I have seen the Truth it speaks. The Bible says,

'For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.' (1 Corinthians 1:18)

and it is cent percent true as seen from the messages of the above posters.

Poor souls!!! Since they have never read the Bible I guess they won't know that the reason the God of the Bible judged the Canaanites (after giving them ample warnings for over a hundred years) using the Israelites was because of their sins. And what sins? Sacrificing their own children to their idol gods, sodomy, adultery, perversion, incest and all sorts of lewdness.  The same Bible also tells later on how God judged the Israelites using the Canaanites, Hittite's, Amekelites etc ...... for the same reason ...... this time the sins of the Israelites.  If God does something drastic, then there has to be a strong reason for it. For the God of the Bible is a just God, compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness (Psalm 103:8). But that does not mean that he will turn a blind eye to evil. Because he is a just God, he will see that justice is done as Numbers 14:18 and Nahum 1:3 tells us. Truly!!! What a awesome God we have. 

It is only the people who are frolicking in sin that are afraid of him and call him a demon for punishing the guilty."

I WAS A CHRISTIAN AND READ THE BIBLE FIVE TIMES, THEN IS WHEN I BECAME AN ATHEIST AND REALIZED THE HORRIBLE CRIMES I USED TO BELIEVE WERE THE WILL OF GOD, RELIGION IS THE CAUSE OF SOME OF THE WORST MURDERS AND ATROCITIES IN HISTORY, EVEN TODAY YOU CAN SEE THAT, UNLESS YOU´RE BLINDED BY YOUR IGNORANT ""FAITH""... AS I SAID BEFORE, GET A LIFE."

AS I SAID BEFORE, GET  A LIFE. .."
,viedma,2009-12-06T21:12Z,"MOREOVER, CHRISTIANS BITTERLY COMPLAINED OF HAVING BEEN PERSECUTED BY THE PAGAN ROMANS, WELL, AS SOON AS THEY BECAME ESTABLISHED AS THE RELIGION OF THE EMPIRE, THEY BEGAN TO PERSECUTE THOSE WHO BELIEVED OTHERWISE WITH CRUEL TENACITY, SO THERE GOES ALL THE FAKE TALK OF ""LOVE"" AND ""FREE CHOICE"" AND OTHER BULLSHIT THEY USE TO FOOL NAIVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU. OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THE REALITY AND THE HYPOCRISY OF CHRISTIANS AT ALL TIMES. "
,donex7,2009-12-09T07:58Z,"i doubt you (viedma) have been truly converted as a christian. True christians are safe in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is a gift from God therefore you cannot just forsake it or leave it just that. Also, don't be fooled that the Roman Religion is a true christian. Roman Catholics are not in any way christian that is why they kill and murder many true christians in the name of christianity."
