,f0xy,2009-12-06T13:17Z,"Installed good on Win7 32bit

Same issue key not working, does it need to be registered to function?"
,Jon143,2009-12-07T03:05Z,"I just understood that if you have a registered but older version of Sandboxie, it uses the older key :D

Anyway, here's what I used (from v3.38)

Name: Team EMBRACE
Key: NHF6TB1

Hope it helps"
[T],zerothdegree,2009-12-15T07:28Z,Thank You!
[S],velvet.,2009-12-26T08:49Z,"I have supplied the key I used for installation in the torrent, but I installed an older version, and have run upgrades against it since then, all of which accepted the installed licensing from before.

You may have to use this version only for upgrades, or use a newer install key than the one provided.

,itworks22,2009-12-31T15:59Z,"re. jon143 comment.
I used as written:

Name: Team EMBRACE
Key: NHF6TB1

Registers perfectly.

,xosuitehearts,2010-04-25T09:38Z,"Velvet.  Possibility of a Re-Up by any chance? I'm currently getting only 2 seeds and 1 peer.  

If you could I would be in your debt to seed ratio 5.1  "
,xosuitehearts,2010-04-25T09:44Z,"Actually, check that, Velvet. If you dont have any issues with it, I'll do a re-up with the original Sandboxie and the latest update including a serial.txt inside. 

Let me know if you have any objection."

Although i have one problem, a mod Afro has stripped my descriptions of posting any URL's for support and whatnot. I am completely unable to edit any of my torrents now. The links were to my personal website, if anyone was to have problems with my torrents, i would like to give them one on one help, which now, i am unable.

Please advice, and thanks velvet again :)"

,newgeloso,2012-05-01T21:20Z,"Mi cuenta en TPB ha sido eliminada, no s茅 el motivo, creo que despues de haber subido unos 350 torrents todos perfectos, no hay ni un solo fake y estar conectado las 24 horas durante meses, me merezco una explicaci贸n. Lo siento, pero si este torrent no tiene semillas no te lo descargues, he dejado de compartir.

My account was deleted TPB do not know why, I think after having risen about 350 torrents all perfect, there is not a fake one and be connected 24 hours for months, I deserve an explanation. Sorry, but if this torrent has no seeds do not download it, I stopped sharing."
