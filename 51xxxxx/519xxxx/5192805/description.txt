Well, folks, I'm a big fan of the film "Ali."  I bought the original DVD and have watched it more times than I can count.  When I found out there was a Director's Cut, I was dismayed and conflicted.  I really love the film, but I hate buying "duplicate" DVDs (though that makes easy Christmas for the ladies in my life).

So, I turned to ye olde Intarweb, but was unable to find a copy of the Director's Cut (except for one members-only DVD ISO site that I was not a member of).  Finally, I broke down and bought a used copy of The Director's Cut and decided to save all of the rest of you from similar dilemmas.

So, here it is.  I don't know yet whether I prefer the Director's Cut over the original.  The original flows a bit better, especially with the amazing soundtrack.  It's a real shame to have to doctor Salif Keita or the Sam Cooke cover during the intro.  You can make up your own minds.  Maybe some day a "Final Cut" will come out.

I would recommend picking one of the versions and buying a retail DVD or BD copy for the full experience.

I have included the "Making Of" documentary.  It's pretty good as these things go.
