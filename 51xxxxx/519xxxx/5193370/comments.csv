,Dredd80,2010-01-17T08:25Z,"According to Virus Total, every single keygen from
CORE that's used for Alien Skin plugins, is riddled
with viruses.

I have tested CORE Alien Skin keygens from
lots of different torrents - all infected.


I just removed some.

W32/Backdoor.EMBT is one of them.

Don't trust ANY CORE keygens that are for
Alien Skin until some clean Virus Total reports
have been found.

,_GKG_,2010-03-05T12:43Z,6 different virus checkers from virustotal.com have hits on the key gen ...
,hound1234,2010-03-06T16:26Z,works perfect press on key gen(NO VIRUS)
,Cong_Sat,2010-03-18T20:35Z,"I hate to say ""false positive,"" but it happens. If your sophisticated enough - run it in a virtual machine or use sandboxie and stop being paranoid. Else you shouldn't deserve what TPB has to offer and you  should go buy it. You have to work for it in order to make some gains!"
,listenherenow,2010-04-23T10:05Z,"dredd80 - LOl dude - of course it will ome like that.  it's not like your doing something for free and it be right in the eyes of the software you use to protect your system. 

  You removed one you say - LOL   it justlooks like one - if you go doing that your to your gens they will not work. 

  for instance - if I set my nod32 correctly it will find it's own FIX and delete it and i have to reinstall it. It thinks it got a Virus. But really it ate my free bee.  see what I mean? 

 anyway - I have 9 kinds of cool stuff to prevent me from being attacked - I just used this safly and its perfect.

works great. thanks."
,maracan,2010-04-25T04:25Z,"TvTeam,

The keygene works perfect.  I downloaded the program from the website, both Win and Mac.  I installed on my Mac, and the keygene worked flawlesly.  Thank you!!!!"
,cir0w,2010-06-04T20:58Z,"Thank you for ul :) But I got a problem.. when should I enter a serial number?? I extracted the setup files and then I run the setup.exe but I never was requested to enter a serial code. It just installed everything :S weird... 

so what should I do to get the full version? Or is it already full?"
,cir0w,2010-06-04T21:27Z,"got it to work after a few attempts to find where to activate :P 

___You have to run the filter inside PS to get the chance to activate it___"
,darko999,2010-08-12T07:58Z,"Setup.exe would not work for me so I had to download from the website.  All ya gotta do is input your e-mail and they send you a dl link.  The file is WAY bigger too at 36.5 MB.  And keygen worked like a charm! Thank you so much for this!!
 ( BTW if the setup file doesn't work for you either, the win version can be found here... http://www.alienskin.com/d/eye-candy-6.0.0a.exe )"
,darko999,2010-08-12T08:02Z,"I dunno where I got the WAY bigger part, I must not have unzipped correctly, which is probably why the installer did not work.
THANX AGAIN!"
,darko999,2010-08-12T08:10Z,Came back to clear some things up.  The installer works fine.  It's just that it was a little confusing having separate rar files in separate zips.(I don't know how a 5 meg installer showed up in the first place.)  A little unnecessary since you have to decompress so many times.  But thanx again for your efforts.
,JaceMat,2010-12-26T01:12Z,"Can someone help....i put in the keygens codes for eye candy 6, but they all come up invalid....someone please help!"
,grafkaal,2011-03-08T21:24Z,Just my 2ps worth. Virtually All keygens will flag as Viruses as they are built the same way as Trojans. 
,buddahass,2011-08-20T08:05Z,"Could be long outdated by now, considering its up to CS5 these days, but I continue to get invalid unlock codes on PS7."
