    The goal is simple: pick up the majority of gems on the board         
    before your opponent does.                                            
                                                                          
    Much easier and quicker than standard chess, it is fascinating to     
    play, and most games last only a few minutes.                         
                                                                          
    Players take turns moving any one of their pieces, collecting all     
    the gems that the piece passes over. There is no checkmating. Once    
    a player has collected the majority of the gems available on the      
    board, the game ends. If capturing is enabled in the game             
    settings, a player who captures all his or her opponent's pieces      
    is awarded all the remaining gems on the board.                       
                                                                          
    Treasure Chess features a number of different computer opponents      
    and variety of different scenarios with varying board sizes,          
    pieces, and piece placements. A random placement option ensures       
    that you never play the same game twice.                              
                                                                          
    Kids find the game very easy to learn and play, and it helps          
    introduce them to some of the pieces of standard chess.
