,masterersin,2009-12-07T22:47Z,"We're all stuck at 81.2%, seed damn you!"
,ludex,2009-12-08T19:04Z,been at 81.2% for 2 days now no one is seeding this past that point
,dolphinfan,2009-12-08T19:56Z,Can anyone tell me if this is in english...tired of downloading it only to find out it's in a foreign language....
,Gemneye,2009-12-08T20:37Z,"don't you guys know, the real dvd was only released today 12/08/09 so might as well wait for the real thing instead of fakes claiming to be the real thing...or am I wrong???"
,feep,2009-12-09T09:14Z,"mmm, stuck at 81% not cool xD

And I've watched a clip of it, it seems to be in German or something. But there is a language menue option. So who knows!"
,legitster,2009-12-09T11:08Z,"I checked a few of the vobs that were done and there ARE in english, but got stuck at 81% and said peers were closed :("
,feep,2009-12-09T11:31Z,"Thats good, so what do we do now? Just wait?"
,00giyt,2009-12-10T22:17Z,87 seeders and still can't get pat 81%. WTF??? What is wrong here? Why don't you all seed more that 1 or 2 kb? SEED DAMMIT!
,gtaseeker,2009-12-12T10:54Z,"Sorry for not seeding :P

And I said, it is in multiple languages. Once you finish downloading, running the VOB I told you about in the description ""VIDEO_TS"" will start a DVD menu where you can choose to play move, scene and choose languages."
,lapis2,2009-12-14T00:48Z,just to let every1 know the video quality on this is crap.  lots of artifacting on fast motion and hazy smoke effects.  if your going to watch on a crap tv or you have very bad eyesight itll be ok at best but if youre watching on a good tv or pc monitor prepare to be dissappointed.
