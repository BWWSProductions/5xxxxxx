Instructions:
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Download the torrent, of course.


Go to the directory where you saved the files. Then, go to VIDEO_TS and play "VIDEO_TS.vob". There's nothing much to it, really.

IF you can't open the .vob with your current video player, use Windows Media Player 11.

*Tested on fresh Windows 7, with no other video/audio drivers than the basic ones from the Windows installer installed whatsoever.*
