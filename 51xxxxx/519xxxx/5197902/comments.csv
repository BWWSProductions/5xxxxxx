Man you have some really gr8 uploads! I totally digg your file size ;-) I live on an island and take boat and train often so I use mobile broadband when I travel and this size is perfect for catching a movie on my mbp.

Keep up the excellent work!!!  ;-)

Thx for your time and effort"

For eleven years I have ""commuted"" bus-train-bus every day for six hours - to work eight hours.
One may say that I've lost fifth of my life going on work and back. You know how I felt...
Unfortunately, back then, some sixteen year ago there was no Internet, not to mention that Toshiba laptop I have was 286 with DOS, and have pricieng as cheaper cars - too valuable to drag around for playing pacman or whatever.
However, I miss that time... big time."

And you're right, all this ""commuting"" take a big chunk of our lives, just sitting there from one place to another. But in these internet dayz at least we can catch a good movie or do some work while we're on our way, so it's not all a waste of time  ;-)

Anyway, once again, thank you for the effort and time you put into this. It's highly appreciated ;-)

Greetings from Norway"
