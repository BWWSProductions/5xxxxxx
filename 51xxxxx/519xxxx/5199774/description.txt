Indispensable for the novice armorer, June 28, 2003
By Mike Troxel (San Jacinto, CA United States)

"I first joined the SCA about 2 years ago, and took an immediate fancy to the armorer's craft. In the two years that I've been there, I have never fought in anything that I didn't make myself. I began studying armor construction at about the same time I started, but didn't really get started on making anything decent until about a year ago, and this book was extremely helpful in getting me get turned in the right direction. The second half of the book provides a very useful manual for making specific pieces; for example, I absolutely love the thoroughness of his description for making a leg harness. The first half of the book, however, was the most useful; descriptions of the tools, applications, hammerwork techniques, polishing, strapping, padding, and the like were all covered in very thoughtful detail, which makes this book an excellent source of reference that I use quite often. I don't have any particular gripes about this book, but I will say this: this book is intended for historically authentic designs, so a bit of alteration might be required contrary to the design schemes presented if you're in the SCA. However, overall, I don't feel that that is enough to bring this book down to four stars, especially since I believe that historical authenticity, rather than SCA armor, was his goal when he wrote this book; overall, it ranks at a very solid five (although I would really like to see the author do another on SCA armor design)."


Have fun with it, and seed if you like it!
