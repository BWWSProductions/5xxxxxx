Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1983. For most of its existence, the band has consisted of vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist John Frusciante, bassist Michael "Flea" Balzary, and drummer Chad Smith. The band's varied musical style has fused traditional rock and funk with various elements of heavy metal, punk rock and psychedelic rock.

Live in Hyde Park is the first live albumâ€”and double albumâ€”released by the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded over three record-breaking nights at Hyde Park, in London on June 19th, 20 and 25 2004. These three concerts became the highest grossing concerts at a single venue in history.
