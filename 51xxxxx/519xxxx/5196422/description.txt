For those who are not familiar with Kirkby (do such people exist?), she is a soprano who usually is recorded singing from the Baroque and Renaissance repertoire.  Do not, therefore, expect some warbling diva who thinks they are singing Verdi.  She has a much purer and lighter sound that is ideally suited to both her usual early music as well as these Mozart arias.
