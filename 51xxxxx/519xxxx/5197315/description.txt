Admiral Lord Hill-Norton, July 2000 (00:06:57 - 1.19mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lord Hill-Norton is a five-star Admiral and the former Head of the British Ministry of Defense who was kept in the dark about the UFO subject during his official capacities. In this short interview, he states that this subject has great significance and should no longer be denied and kept secret. He emphatically states, â€œâ€¦that there is a serious possibility that we are being visited â€” and have been visited for many years â€” by people from outer space, from other civilizations; that it behooves us to find out who they are, where they come from, and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation, and not the subject of rubbishing by tabloid newspapers.â€ 


Dr. Carol Rosin (0:35:08 - 6.03mb)
December 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Carol Rosin was the first woman corporate manager of Fairchild Industries and was spokesperson for Wernher Von Braun in the last years of his life. She founded the Institute for Security and Cooperation in Outer Space in Washington DC and has testified before Congress on many occasions about space based weapons. Von Braun revealed to Dr. Rosin a plan to justify weapons in spaced based on hoaxing an extraterrestrial threat. She was also present at meetings in the â€˜70s when the scenario for the Gulf War of the â€˜90s was planned.

Lance Corporal Jonathan Weygandt: US Marine Corps (0:34:47 - 5.97mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"'You weren't supposed to be there.' 'You are not supposed to see this.' 'You are going to be dangerous if we let you go.' I thought that they were going to kill me, reallyâ€¦
"They had a Lieutenant Colonel from the Air Force and he did not identify himself. And he told me, 'If we just took you out in the jungle, they would never find you out there.' I didn't want to test him to see if he would really do that so I just said, 'Yeah.' And, he said, 'You have got to sign these papers. You never saw this.' I 'don't exist' and 'this situation never happened.' And if you tell anybody, you will just come up missingâ€¦
"They are yelling at me and hollering and cursing. 'You didn't see anything. We will do you and your whole goddamn family.'
"It was basically that for about eight or nine hoursâ€¦ 'We are going to take you off in a helicopter and we are going to kick your ass out in the jungle and we are going to end youâ€¦"
"These different agencies are on their own. They don't obey the law. They are rogue. Do I think that this is a project that goes up through the government and everyone has a piece in it? No. I think these guys operate on their own and no one knows what they do. It is so easy to do today. And there is no oversight, no control. They just do whatever they wantâ€¦ 
"Lethal, deadly force has been used. For those of you who don't know, I know marine snipers and I have heard other guys talk about it and I've heard that these guys go on the streets and they stalk people and they kill them. I know that the Army Airborne snipers do the same thing. They use Delta Force to go grab these people and silence them by killing them."

Professor Robert Jacobs, Lt. US Air Force (0:21:00 - 3.60mb)
November 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Professor Jacobs is a respected professor at a major US university. In the 1960â€™s he was in the Air Force. He was the officer in charge of optical instrumentation and his job was to film ballistic missile tests launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in California. In 1964, during a test of the first missile they filmed, they caught on film a UFO traveling right next to the missile. He says it looked like two saucers cupped together with a round ping-pong ball like surface on top. The film showed that from the ball a beam of light was directed at the missile. This happened four times, from four different angles, as the missile was about 60 miles up and traveling at 11,000 to 14,000 miles an hour. The missile tumbled out of space and the UFO left. The next day he was shown the film by his commanding officer and was told to never speak of this again. He said, if it ever comes up you are to say that it was laser strikes from the UFO. Professor Jacobs thought this unusual because in 1964 lasers were in their infancy in the labs but he never the less agreed and hasnâ€™t talked about it for 18 years. Years later, after an article came out about the film, professor Jacobs started receiving harassing phone calls at early hours in the morning. His mailbox was even blown up out in front of his house. 
What we photographed up at Vandenberg Air Force Base affected me for the rest of my life and made a huge impact on my understanding of the universe and of Governmental manipulation of our minds. 


Security Officer Larry Warren: United States Air Force, September 2000 (1:00:09 - 10.3mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Warren was a security officer at Bentwaters Air Force Base in the United Kingdom. He was present during an event in 1980 when an extraterrestrial vehicle landed, hovered, and interacted with Air Force personnel on base. Afterwards, the many personnel who had witnessed the events were intimidated, debriefed, and forced to sign documents telling a false version of the story. Warren's testimony is corroborated by multiple other military witnesses who have been identified. There are official documents related to this event; there is a photograph related to the event; and there is physical landing-trace evidence. This entire event is also corroborated by Ministry of Defense official Nick Pope, and five-star Admiral, Sea Lord, former Ministry of Defense head Lord Hill-Norton, and Sergeant Clifford Stone.


Sergeant Clifford Stone, United States Army, (0:54:16 - 9.31mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sergeant Stone tells an amazing story about the history of UFOâ€™s and extraterrestrials dating back to the early 40â€™s and probably before. General Douglas MacArthur organized a group called the Interplanetary Phenomena Research Unit back in 1943 to study this issue and it continues to this day. Their purpose is to recover objects of unknown origin particularly those that are of non-Earthly origin. They obtain field intelligence information and pass it on to those who are the â€œkeepers of this information.â€ Stone says that even Project Bluebook had an elite investigation unit, which was outside of Bluebook. This unit was thought to be working in conjunction with Bluebook but in fact was not. Stone has seen living and dead extraterrestrials in his official duties on an army team that retrieved crashed ET crafts. He thinks that the extraterrestrials will not permit us to explore the depths of outer space until weâ€™ve learned to grow spiritually and that they will make themselves known soon if we donâ€™t first acknowledge their presence. 


Sgt. Karl Wolfe: US Air Force  (0:23:34 - 4.04mb) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I didnâ€™t want to look at it any longer than that, because I felt that my life was in jeopardy. Do you understand what Iâ€™m saying? I would have loved to have looked at it longer, I would have loved to have had copies. I would love to have said more about it, discussed it more, but I knew I couldnâ€™t. I knew the young fellow who was sharing this was really, really overstepping his bounds at that point. 
â€œI felt that he just needed somebody to talk to. He hadnâ€™t discussed it, couldnâ€™t discuss it, and he wasnâ€™t doing it for any ulterior motive other than the fact that I think he had the weight of this thing on him and it was distressing to himâ€¦
â€œI knew that I couldnâ€™t go anyplace for at least five years without telling the State Department where I was, after I left the military. Any time I traveled I had to notify and get permission, even in the United States. They had to know where I was all the time. As an example, if we went to Vietnam there was always someone there with us, with a gun, ready to annihilate us basically if we should fall into the hands of the enemy. They didnâ€™t want the enemy to get us; we would be killed instead. 
â€œSo we knew we were operating under these sort of conditions. Your life was in jeopardy all the time, should you fall into the wrong hands. So we were aware of that. I was told when I left that I would be investigated on a regular basis to make sure that I wasnâ€™t involved in any peculiar activities that didnâ€™t suit the governmentâ€™s needs.â€


Testimony of Major George A. Filer III (0:24:13 - 4.15mb)
November 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major George Filer was an Air Force Intelligence Officer who not only had an extraordinary encounter with a massive UFO on radar over the United Kingdom but later, in the 1970s while he was at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, found out that an extraterrestrial biological entity had been shot at Fort Dix. The Extraterrestrial fled to adjacent McGuire Air Force Base, where it died on the tarmac. He testifies that this life form was then picked up and taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Afterwards, many of the key personnel on the base who had a connection with this event, were quickly transferred. Major Filer also points out that the ridicule factor has been very effective at silencing people who have seen ETs or UFOs, and has helped to maintain secrecy. 


Captain Lori Rehfeldt (0:13:30 - 2.31mb)
October 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lori Rehfeldt was stationed at the 81st Security Police Squadron at RAF Bentwaters in England during the UFO events that occurred in December 1980. She and a colleague were on duty late that night, when they saw in the distance an object they thought was a plane landing on the runway â€” coming in from the direction of the North Sea. They also saw it silently explode, split into three parts, and speed across the runway; then it went straight up and disappeared. 
â€¦ We saw this aircraft... The rate of speed that it was moving when it went across was tremendous. It was moving in like a regular aircraft, then when it stopped, it did this movement and split into three. And when sped across the runway going west, it was just going at a phenomenal speed. The only other thing that really caught our attention was that it didnâ€™t make any noise. There was no sound to it at all. We just didnâ€™t know what it wasâ€¦

When it stopped, thatâ€™s when it made these fast movements: up, down, left, right- the movement was very geometric. I mean, it was not a normal movement. That probably threw us more than anything because it was just so, unusual. It was a lot faster than a jet planeâ€¦

He happened to be an electrical engineer for the Air Force. He said, you do know they found something out there? He said, well, weâ€™ve been working with the plastic, with the material that we got from back then. And he said, back then it was pretty raw, but now weâ€™ve been able to use it and to refine it. And theyâ€™ve been able to use it and it can take so many degrees of heat and temperature. He mentioned it was a gray material. But he was validating that there was something out there. And he said this material was not indigenous to hereâ€¦


Commander Graham Bethune, US Navy (retired) (0:30:16 - 5.19mb)
November 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cmdr. Graham Bethune is a retired Navy commander pilot with a top-secret clearance. He was a VIP Plane Commander who flew most of the high-ranking officers and civilians from Washington D.C. In his testimony he explains how he was flying a group of VIPâ€™s and other pilots into Argentia, Newfoundland when they all witnessed a 300 foot UFO that traveled 10,000 feet straight up in a fraction of a second toward their plane and was on radar. He has documented the event extensively. A selection of those documents follow this testimony. 


Dr. Paul Czysz (0:40:01 - 6.87mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Paul Czysz is a Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Parks College in St. Louis. He spent 8 years in the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and another 30 years working for McDonnell-Douglas in the field of exotic technologies. While at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, he was involved in tracking UFOs over Missouri, Ohio, and Michigan. These UFOs were seen my many people: military, local police, and civilians, and were clocked at speeds around 20,000 MPH as they performed unusual, silent maneuvers. Dr. Czysz spent more than half his career at McDonnell-Douglas working on classified and compartmentalized projects, and testifies to the processes involved in maintaining secrecy on these projects. He warns against the human tendency to make every new technology into a weapon, pointing out that our weaponization of space does not address the threat of Earth terrorists, and the idea of using these weapons against extraterrestrial targets would be suicidal. 


Dr. Paul LaViolette (0:29:35 - 5.07mb)
October 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Paul LaViolette has written four books and has published many original papers in physics, astronomy, climatology, systems theory, and psychology. He received his BA in physics from Johns Hopkins, his MBA from the University of Chicago, and PhD from Portland State University, and is currently president of the Starburst Foundation, an interdisciplinary scientific research institute. He is the developer of subquantum kinetics, a novel approach to microphysics that accounts for electric, magnetic, gravitational, and nuclear forces in a unified manner and resolves many long-standing physics problems. Based on the predictions of this theory, he developed an alternative cosmology that effectively replaces the big bang theory. Dr. LaViolette has also developed a new theory of gravity that replaces the deeply flawed theory of general relativity. Predicted from subquantum kinetics, it accounts for the electrogravitic coupling phenomenon discovered by Townsend Brown and may explain the advanced aerospace propulsion technology utilized in the B-2 bomber. In addition to his understanding of UFO and black budget craft propulsion systems, including materialization and dematerialization, he has deep knowledge of the inner workings of the U.S. Patent Office. He states in this interview that, currently, if an invention doesnâ€™t fit into the accepted physics paradigm, the patent examiners immediately reject it thinking it violates the paradigm and must be a mistake. In effect, new energy technologies are the underdog: They donâ€™t fit the paradigm so they are left out of the needed funding, or their patents are denied â€” even to the point that the Patent Office is breaking the law. In order to alleviate the current Earth crises of environmental pollution, global warming, etc. and advance as a technological society, we need technologies that donâ€™t fit into the old paradigm. 


James Kopf: US Navy Crypto Communications (0:15:29 - 2.65mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â€œA few days later the Commanding Officer and the Executive Officer came on the closed circuit television system that we had on board. It was the only way that they could address the crew of 5,000. He [the Commanding Officer] looked at the camera -- and I will never forget this -- and he said, â€˜I would like to remind the crew that certain events that take place on board a major naval combative vessel are considered classified and should not be discussed with anyone without a need to know.â€™ And that was all he said.â€


Mr. John Maynard
Defence Intelligence Agency Official (0:39:20 - 6.75mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â€œOf corporations involved in this matter, Atlantic Research Corporation is one of the big ones. So itâ€™s not very often heard about. Itâ€™s an insider beltway bandit, if you want to call it that very low profile, mostly has all of its work done within Intelligence. TRW, Johnson Controls, Honeywell: All of them at some point or another became involved with the Intelligence field. Certain works, activities were contracted out to them. Atlantic Research was one of them -way back. These are entities that were created out of people in the Pentagon to become a â€˜beltway banditâ€™ -- received projects, grants, and monies to do certain projects that were so highly classified and compartmentalized that you know only about four people would know what was going on. So it was that tightly controlled.â€


Lieutenant Bob Walker, US Army (0:16:44 - 2.87mb)
October 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lieutenant Walker was a 2nd lieutenant in the Army. After World War II at a NASA (then NACA) open house he saw a 30-foot saucer-shaped craft which had been brought back from Germany for study. On another occasion he was piloting an aircraft for a TV station when a disc shaped object came in from the west. He had his camera and climbed to 12,000 feet to take some photos of it. After landing, he immediately had the pictures developed and enlarged. The object turned out to be a football shaped silver object with points at each end. His film was subsequently taken from him under unusual circumstances. In his testimony he also speaks of a time when he happened into a diner late at night near Ft. Campbell in Kentucky and overheard conversations from MPs about how a flying saucer had landed next to a nearby farmhouse and the MPâ€™s were there cordoning off the area. Creatures were present and were shot at by the frightened farmhouse owner. 


Lt. Frederick Fox: US Navy Pilot (0:11:06 - 1.90mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â€œThere is a publication called JANAP 146 E that had a section that says you will not reveal any information regarding the UFO phenomenon under penalty of $10,000.00 fine and ten years in jail. So they were quite adamant that whatever experiences you had you were not to go public with it without their permissionâ€¦
â€œThe subject never came up with Air Traffic Control. In any event I would never have opened my mouth. There was a Captain, Pete Killian, who was written about in some of the UFO books. He was a Captain with American Airlines back in the â€˜50â€™s that evidently had a sighting and testified before the Senate committees. And then there was another captain that actually took a photograph of a UFO off his wings. And of course they were subject to ridicule. I didnâ€™t want to go that direction. So, I never reported anything to FAA or the military. A lot of pilots just did not want to get involved in this because of peer pressure and ridicule. So the secret has been keptâ€¦
â€œI have a very personal friend that was a B-24 pilot during W.W.II that got into [the] O.S.S. And he was one of the first people into Japan after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Nagasaki. He ended up on Project Bluebook, Section 13, which I believe was the top-secret portion of that investigation. At the time he was a captain in the Air Force. Heâ€™s in his late â€˜70â€™s now and he is still being carried on active duty as a captain. I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s being paid but if heâ€™s on active duty he should be a three star general with time and rank and he should be paid. And the whole reason that they have kept him on active duty is to keep his national security oath active because of what he knows. There are certain things that he will not talk to me about because of that security oath even though I had a top secret clearance with the Navy and we are both very interested in the same thing. 
â€œFor whatever reason the Government, or those agencies of Government, deem necessary to protect their agendas, which obviously now, arenâ€™t our agendas. I think it is time for us to act, to end this charade. And to take whatever steps are necessary to insure that the human race evolves properly and enjoys the fruits of that evolution.â€


Mr. David Hamilton (0:14:17 - 2.45mb)
US Department of Energy 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Hamilton works for the Department of Energy in the area of new generation power systems. He explains that we have nearly exhausted the worldâ€™s supply of fossil fuels, just at the time when Asia and China are undergoing an â€œindustrial revolutionâ€ and are positioning to become bigger consumers of these fuels than the â€œfirst worldâ€ countries already are. In order to alleviate the current Earth crises of environmental pollution, global warming, etc. and advance as a sustainable technological society, we must develop technologies that donâ€™t fit into the old paradigm. 
We have designed a world that feeds on oil and those oil supplies are becoming more and more limited. Now if we look at what the supply of oil is, never before in our history have we been in a position where supply and demand would intersect. But in about 10 years we will see the intersection between supply and demand and that means that we will be seriously supply limitedâ€¦
In working with the Russian universities, they did what I consider one of the best gravitational experiments ever done. It was at the High Temperature Materials Laboratory in Russia. They had done their experiment off-site and demonstrated that this device could develop a 35 percent reduction in the gravitational field. 

Now we saw that. We were very impressed with it. The high gravitational researchers at DOE, I had them look at it. We were all interested in it. We would like to follow up on that to do a second type of experiment â€“ duplication, reproducibility, getting back to the issues of how do you get good science. But you run into a lot of resistance among people. And in the Russian case it was even more so. When they were away from this off-site laboratory â€“ it was across the street from the university, as I understand it â€“ the place was completely ransacked. 

All the equipment was lost. Now lucky for us they had their recordings, they had their videotapes, they had their presentation materials. All of that was still intact. But the machine was lost as well as a lot of the equipment necessary to duplicate that test. 

It may have been that there were some Mafia type individuals involved, thinking that there might be some profit in this thing. And my Russian friends say that part of the government that does that sort of thing is no different from the Mafia. So that complicates the problemâ€¦.

I am concerned that if we donâ€™t do something very soon, any society that begins to be resource limited begins to eliminate the problem causing that resource limitation. And I would hate to see us get into the position where other people want to eliminate us or we have to eliminate them in order to continue our lifestyle. And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important that we start now. 


Mr. Don Phillips, Lockheed Skunkworks, USAF, and CIA Contractor (0:32:57 - 5.65mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don Phillips was in the Air Force at Las Vegas Air Force Base during an event when UFOs were seen moving at enormous speeds near Mt. Charleston, northwest of Las Vegas. In addition, he worked with Kelly Johnson at the Lockheed Skunkworks â€” on design and construction of the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird. He testifies that we not only have these extraterrestrial devices, but have also achieved tremendous technological advances from their study. He states that in the 1950s and 1960s, NATO did research into the origin of ET races, and disseminated reports to the leaders of various countries. Mr. Phillips further states that there are records and filmed documentation of meetings in California in 1954 between ETs and leaders of the USA. He lists a few of the technologies we were able to develop because of the ETs: computer chips, lasers, night vision, bulletproof vests, and concludes, â€œAre these ET people hostile? Well, if they were hostile, with their weaponry they could have destroyed us a long time ago â€” or could have done some damage.â€ Mr. Phillips now develops technologies that can help eliminate environmental pollutants and reduce the need for fossil fuels: energy generation systems that use natural energies from planet Earth. 


Dr. Richard Haines - November 2000  (0:25:20 - 4.34mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Haines has been a NASA research scientist since the mid 1960's. He has worked on the Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs as well as several others. Over the past 30 years, Dr. Haines has compiled over 3,000 cases of unusual visual and radar sightings of unexplained aerial phenomena. He notes that numerous foreign cases also appear in the literature and are very similar in nature to the American reports. In one case here in America, a B-52 captain told him that he and his crew had five round spheres appear just off of each wingtip, behind their aircraft, above the aircraft, and below and they kept up with the plane at cruise altitude and speed. The captain tried to shake the spheres with evasive maneuvers but each sphere kept exact position. There are other cases where pilots look into the transparent cupola of some of the UFOs and detail can be seen inside.  


Lt. Col. John Williams - US Air Force (0:06:36 - 1.13mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colonel Williams entered the Air Force in 1964 and became a rescue helicopter pilot in Vietnam. He has an electrical engineering degree and was in charge of all the construction projects for the Military Air Command. During his time in the military he knew that there was a facility inside of Norton Air Force Base in California that no one was to know about. He heard that there was a UFO craft stored there and that people such as certain Senators including Bob Dole had visited the facility. Colonel Williams also relates another story that his father told him: One time attending a dinner party he had a conversation with a high-level RAND official who told him that the government was spending more money on antigravity devices than any other project in the history of this country. 


Lt. Colonel Wojtecki - US Air Force  (0:18:50 - 3.23mb) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lt. Colonel Wojtecki spent 20 years in the Air Force and retired in 
1988. He spent most of his time with Strategic Air Command and Tactical 
Air Command. He tells of a night in April of 1969 while stationed at 
Loring AFB in Maine when he and his flight instructor both saw three 
very bright lights in a perfect equilateral triangle silently moving 
across the sky. They estimated that this UFO was lower than 3,000 feet. 
He discovered the next morning when he reported for duty that for six 
hours, a UFO was seen hovering over a group of B-52's containing nuclear 
weapons. Every time a plane drew near to the lights, they would part 
and move in ways that were very unconventional. When the planes left, 
the lights came together again and focused on the group of B-52's. Many 
years later Lt. Col. Wojtecki attended a lecture given by SG and saw a 
photograph of a UFO that was the exact configuration that he had seen 
years earlier. 


Mr. Franklin Carter: US Navy, December 2000  (0:17:09 - 2.94mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Carter was trained as an electronic radar technician in the Navy in the 50's and 60's. He tells of an incident where he witnessed a clear, unambiguous radar contact speeding along at 3,400 miles an hour. There were other radar operators as well who, at various times in 1957 and 1958, also witnessed these unusually fast moving objects. At the time, the fastest human aircraft clocked in at 1,100 miles and hour. In one case an Air Force operator tracked one of these UFOs 300 to 400 miles out in space. When these reports repeatedly kept coming in to General Electric who manufactured the radar, their technicians came in and modified the electronics so that the radar would limit it's reporting to 12 to 15 miles out into space.


Mr. Gordon Creighton: Former British Foreign Service Official, September 2000  (0:16:04 - 2.75mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Creighton spent many years in the British Foreign Service. He spent 10 years in China and in 1941 he saw a UFO while at the Embassy. In broad daylight he saw a disc-shaped, silent UFO with a blue white light on top flying very fast. In 1953 he spent some time with the Military Defense in Whitehall and worked on the floor underneath a department, Air Technical, dealing with UFOs. He says that a UFO landed on the estate of Lord Mountbatten in the south of England near Southampton.


Mr. Mark McCandlish, US Air Force  (1:20:20 - 13.7mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
December 2000 
Mark McCandlish is an accomplished aerospace illustrator and has worked for many of the top aerospace corporations in the United States. His colleague, Brad Sorenson, with whom he studied, has been inside a facility at Norton Air Force Base, where he witnessed alien reproduction vehicles, or ARVs, that were fully operational and hovering. In his testimony, you will learn that the US not only has operational antigravity propulsion devices, but we have had them for many, many years, and they have been developed through the study, in part, of extraterrestrial vehicles over the past fifty years. In addition, we have the drawing from aerospace inventor Brad Sorenson of the devices that he saw, as well as a schematic of one of these alien reproduction vehicles - in some remarkable detail.


Mr. Michael W. Smith, US Air Force  (0:17:17 - 2.96mb)
November 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Smith was an Air Traffic Controller with the Air Force in Oregon and, subsequently, in Michigan. At both of these facilities he and others witnessed UFOs tracked on radar and moving at extraordinary speeds. He also confirms that personnel were expected to maintain secrecy concerning these observations, and that NORAD, the North American Air Defense Command, was fully apprised of these events. In fact, in one event in Michigan, NORAD was fully engaged, and steered B-52s returning to base around these UFOs. 


Staff Sergeant Stoney Campbell: US Air Force, October 1999  (0:06:00 - 1.03mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sergeant Campbell entered the Air Force in 1966. In the summer of 1967 he was guarding a B-52 at a SAC AFB in Oklahoma when suddenly, directly over one of the B-52's, a huge bluish haze appeared. It was in the form of a boomerang wing and was glittery and not solid. It was picked up on radar and seen by numerous people.


Theodore C. Loder III, Ph.D.  (0:25:20 - 4.35mb)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Ted Loder is a respected scientist and oceanography professor at the University of New Hampshire. After learning from his cousin, Brigadier General Stephen Lovekin, that the ET/UFO subject is not only real but is the key to technologies that could preserve our Earth's environment while advancing humanity into a sustainable planetary society, he has become an outspoken advocate for ending the secrecy surrounding this subject. He has worked to introduce students, other scientists, and legislators to the fact that humans are not alone in the universe.
