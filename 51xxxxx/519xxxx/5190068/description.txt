Here are the map files from the Magellan RoadMate 1220 I purchased last night.
Says Revision 35 in the info:

Covers Contiguous 48 states, plus Hawaii and Puerto Rico, contains US_POI and US_EXIT_POI and Traffic file. I guess it has to have a different power cord for the traffic to work. Enjoy. P.S. if anyone has Mexico.imi file (if there is one), I would very much appreciate it, as my dad is going to be traveling in Mexico soon.
