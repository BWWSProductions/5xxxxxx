Google serves some 80 percent of all search queries on the Internet, making
it by far the most popular search engine. Its popularity is due not only to excellent
search effectiveness, but also extensive querying capabilities. However, we should
also remember that the Internet is a highly dynamic medium, so the results presented
by Google are not always up-to-date â€“ some search results might be stale, while other relevant resources might not yet have been visited by Googlebot (the automatic script that browses and indexes Web resources for Google).
