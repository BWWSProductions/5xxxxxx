             Arcade Lines is an extremely addictive puzzle game               
             with brilliant graphics, popular pulsating music and             
             a great variety of different game modes. It does not             
             require fast reflexes and is even easy for kids to               
             learn, but requires enough strategy to keep you                  
             hooked for hours.                                                
                                                                              
             Arcade Lines is played on a board that fills with                
             multi-colored pieces as the game progresses. You                 
             have a very simple objective: Stop the board from                
             filling up by forming rows of 5 or more pieces of                
             the same color. The rows will disappear, leaving                 
             more space for new pieces.                                       
                                                                              
             Sounds too easy? Build more lines in consecutive                 
             moves to get the combo bonus for a higher score.                 
             With every turn you may move only one piece, and                 
             only if there is a clear path to its destination. As             
             space becomes scarce there are less useful moves to              
             choose from, so the game gets gradually harder.                  
             Getting a high score by surviving as long as                     
             possible is a challenge for every Arcade Lines                   
             player.

             *Note: I have found these bugs on the TRIAL, NOTHING

             A. On some boxes the menu `Help/Detailed Game Rules'             
             does not open.                                                   
                                                                              
             B. On some boxes first 2-3 times closing the app it              
             will have an `exception error'.

           It's great to be back together and active after our hiatus.        
           We love the scene, ownage, the race, and the competition.          
           Our goal is always the highest quality releases of software        
           that we actually use. We are, and always will be, a small          
           tight group of friends respectful of every member.
