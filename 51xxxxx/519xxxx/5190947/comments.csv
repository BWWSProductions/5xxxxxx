,teabag87,2009-12-02T05:41Z,"agreed, its supposed to have that 'fuzzy' look to it.  If they spent the time to make the digital transfer perfect, it would of just looked weird"
[V],-jonny-,2009-12-02T12:09Z,well i completely disagree. as does this review http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/A-Christmas-Story-Blu-ray-Review/1152/
,DeeJayVZ,2011-11-15T16:56Z,"I read the article Johnny and I do agree with you, what's the point of remastering a movie if not to make it better and with less artifacts both towards sound and video?

Best regards,
