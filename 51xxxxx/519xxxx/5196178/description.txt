Iâ€™ve recently begun a couple of little experiments with DVD-R torrents. In my opinion, there are far too few NTSC DVD-R torrents available, and the ones that ARE badly seeded. Further, I am playing about with some new (to me, anyway) rippers, decoders, and building programs in order to offer up a better product. 

This is my first effort. This ISO worked for me both on a virtual mount and as a burned disk, but I would appreciate it if a few people would come back to the comment area here on TPB and mention if the final product worked for THEM as a burned disk. This was created using DVDFab and ImgBurn, and was reduced in size/quality to fit a single DVD as an ISO. I left all DVD features and extras intact, including Menus. Another question for uploaders out there â€“ would you prefer DVD-R torrents as ready-to-go ISO files, or simply as a straight ripped collection of VOB, IFO, and BUP files that you can adjust on your own?

Man on the Moon is a 1999 biopic of the American entertainer Andy Kaufman. The film, starring Jim Carrey and directed by MiloÅ¡ Forman, begins at Kaufman's childhood, where he is seen performing imaginary television programs for stuffed animals. The story traces Kaufman's steps through the numerous comedy clubs, and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as "Latka Gravas" on the television sitcom Taxi. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running "feud" with wrestler Jerry "The King" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.

Carrey won a Golden Globe for his performance - his second win in a row after receiving an award for The Truman Show previously. He was nominated in the Musical/Comedy category for Man on the Moon, and remarked in his acceptance speech that he thought the film was a drama at heart, an opinion shared by others, but also a reference to how Kaufman saw himself as a "song and dance man."
