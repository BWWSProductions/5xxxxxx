,shango,2009-12-04T21:33Z,"I saw your comments and thought I would share something. I think a lot of people on here would appreciate getting the full dvd-9 and not having someone compress it. Alot of the dvd9s are just slightly bigger but its that much more quality. This way if someone wants to shrink it to a dvd5 they can do so with whatever software they prefer. Personally I like using anydvd to rip dvds with. If you select remove pgc in settings you can rip out all the trailers and fbi warnings and with another button you can have it jump to the main menu when it starts so you dont have to see all the other crap on the dvd. 

Also I dont think you need to bother putting them in .iso format. Its pretty easy burning the vob files onto a disk. 

I hope you dont think I was being too critical but if you really want the best overall product as you were suggesting then a full dvd cant be beat."

[V],rambam1776,2009-12-09T22:49Z,"Okay, I've seeded to 50 gig. I hope that's enough, because I've deleted the torrent to make room on my drive."
