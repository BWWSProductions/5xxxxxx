,IS-118,2009-12-01T13:45Z,"Moved To Video > Handheld Section.

Note : Post Your Torrents in right category from here, man.

/Is."
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-01T14:04Z,"For IS-118 (mod):

I have same ""issue"" with vicerock, PLEASE, do not move my torrents to ""Handhelds"" category. Please.
I have no idea why you guys toying with me..

IT IS NOT encoded for mobiles only.
TAG IS COMPATIBILITY tag, put as a part of the file name by automatized testing-program.

I just have moved in from ""downed"" mininova, I do not need anyone to tell me what to do, especially without my consent. I have 300 000 downloads every month, millions of downloads.

I expect to be found by my ""audience"", people who are lost in this mess.

As the file-name says, [PC Mac XboX PS3 ipod] where ipod is on the last place, it is possible to play such file on ipod, it is good, ipod compatible encoding and that's all.

I DO NOT encode for Hanhelds exclusively and BTW, I will done it myself, right?

Beside, what was the reasoning for your move, I'll never understand. H264... AAC?

I have send e-mail about specific behavior of mods. I have posted on IRC. Do anyone really thinks that I should repeat this for ALL moderators?
Mods have their forum and ways of communication. Please, play nice. Be good.

Sincerely, twentyforty."
,mrhinter,2009-12-01T15:11Z,"Glad to see you moved on from miniwho?? :P keep up the brilliant work matey, and i agree, i i dont download your files for portable content, the smaller size is great on limited bandwidth!"
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-01T15:49Z,"@mrhinter:
Thanks and welcome.
According to most recent pool I've done, ONLY 8% of the people who have downloaded my torrents have ipod (or clone).
2nd, only 4.6% (really small %) download the content  to watch EXCLUSIVELY on their handheld.
Difference is comprised of the people who have handhelds, but transfer to one ONLY specific mpfours and prefer other methods of playback.
So - 92 percent of my ""audience"" watches my encodings on PC, Mac, PS3 or Xbox. The way I put them in file-names.
It is preposterous and dangerous to put my torrents in ""Handhelds"" category where they don't belong. Reasons for such ""putting in box"" is only a wrong perception and lack of judgment and facts which can support such move.

As many of my old comrades from name-not-to-br-spoken knows very well, I was and I am very cautious about ipod compatibility, my way of encoding differs and it is NOT 100% ipod compatible.

That's why I put:
""MP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video & AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.""
as some kind of warning and guidance.

I guess, we should learn more.

So, mrhinter, my primary goal you've just spelled out, and compatibility comes after that."
,sassymoon,2009-12-01T20:38Z, I too do not download small sized files for ipod/handheld use. I have only a small data limit so prefer smaller size files to watch on our pc. Thanks twenty for this one.
,bhuvank,2009-12-01T20:39Z,"dude i have downloaded a few of ur torrents recently and being a dedicated piratebay user i can say that that the quality of ur stuff is very good... and i dont think that ur torrents should ""not"" be moved tot the handheld section.... keep the good work going.. and would appreciate if u post stuff more frequently... and pls also post the latest movies asap..."
,bhuvank,2009-12-01T20:42Z,"sorry i ment that ur torrents should not be moved rather than should be moved...


sorry again for that........"
,lilars26,2009-12-01T22:28Z,I too have been downloading your torrents because of limited bandwidth.I watch them on my p.c. and if I watch a movie worth putting on dvd I will go download a larger file.Thank you twentyforty and good luck.I would imagine that you get more seeders than leechers due to the file size.
,naraku00,2009-12-02T00:14Z,"Yay, thanks for getting on tpb. Only things missing are Blueman and a working RSS feed to replace mininova. Thanks a lot I hope you'll do some more TV rips. 

And yea, most handhelds can't even play H264 files. What constitutes as handhelds anyway. My laptop is like 12inches. :p "
,mrhinter,2009-12-02T00:37Z,"ive even converted a few files ive grabbed from twentyforty to dvd format for others to watch, and havent even heard complaints about the quality there! could just be that myself and the people i know have low expectations ;P"
,honey88foru,2009-12-02T06:27Z,I don't even have a handheld device. I just like the small size :)
,Rothi,2009-12-02T07:03Z,"i download because i prefer a smaller sized good quality encode.

it does nt have to be DVD/BR quality.

I will always download the smaller file, if i have been given the choice.

a movie can be 300MB with 7/10 quality.
same movie can be 700MB with 8.5/10 quality.

i'm not going to spend extra hours and bandwidth for that extra 1.5 quality.
the quality wi"
,Dereknell,2009-12-02T13:17Z,"i agree!! all the movies i download are small in size, like HolyRoses downloads are excellent quality, i have seen worse movie that are 700-800mb on TPB than these small files, i convert them through Aimersoft (that i also got on TPB) to dvd format and watch them on my Sony Bravia! the quality is Outstanding, thanks to people like YOU and HolyRoses that take the time to format them for us I can download 2 movies for every 1 avi format!!!! THANKS KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!!"
,mrhinter,2009-12-02T18:42Z,"For holyroses:

6 September 2009 @ Telluride Film Festival
13 November 2009 @ Starz Denver Film Festival
then limited cinema release on 20 November 2009 so IMDB claims! hope that helps ;)"
,dakin1993,2009-12-05T23:45Z,"i agree with others.
small size has nothing to do with category and this movie can be seen properly on my computer so it should be video category."
,tjosan62,2009-12-14T13:38Z,"There are several of your releases that where put in 'movies', and not 'hendheld', so in this case TPB is not consistent, am I right?

I agree that the handheld category should go! It is up to *us* to choose the format and size we want, right?

Cheers,
Johan"
