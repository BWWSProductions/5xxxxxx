[In Wild to Possess] The hero, Lew Brookbank, is suffering from the dreadful memory of finding his unfaithful wife in bed with another manâ€”both of them shot dead, with Lew the obvious fall guy. He gets rid of the bodies, but he can't purge his feelings. Fast forward to his new life in a small town in Florida. One night he is putting up signs that he has made for a local business, getting drunk in the process on a bottle of gin, when he sees a car off the road with a man and woman in it, and decides to listen in on their conversation.
This seemingly random act lets him in on an interesting scheme, as the two lovers plot to kidnap the man's wife, ransom her to her rich family, then kill her. Lew decides to take advantage of his illicit eavesdrop by double-crossing the plotters, and kidnaps the woman himself. But before long he finds himself in a wild balancing act, juggling the woman who loves him (sweet Rita) with the kidnapped woman (black-haired, full-breasted Flo) while trying to stay one step ahead of the original kidnappers (one of whom, naturally, is a conniving sexpotâ€”blonde and devious Isobel) and the brother of the man who dallied with Lew's wife, who shows up to hold Lew responsible for his brother's disappearance.
Twisted enough?
