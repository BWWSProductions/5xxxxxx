Public and private trackers are like VHS Video Tape, move with the times and stay ahead of those who want to stop copyrighted material file share.    Now YOU are a Tracker, I am a Tracker and they can not shut us all down!!!!   DHT and PEX  The future of Bit torrent"
[T],towerelect,2009-12-01T17:47Z,"WHEN making new torrents SELECT USE INTERNAL TRACKER.   Extertnal trackers are obsolete and one by one being shut down.   In November alone we lost:

The Pirate Bay
Demonoid
MiniNova

Your public or private torrent server is next  SO DON""T risk it.  GO DHT"
