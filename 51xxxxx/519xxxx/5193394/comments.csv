,jayton420,2010-01-23T16:12Z,"@1975ljg 
with 461 seeders, I'm gonna go ahead and guess that you are full of shit.  Why would you post bullshit like that?"
,1975ljg,2010-02-12T18:49Z,"@jayton420
Download it and let us know..."
,moldaviax,2010-03-11T08:04Z,1975ljg - this is correct download every song checks out.  not sure how your saying this is reggae because it clearly not.  I downloaded and listened to all the songs and matched lyrics to her official website.  If you listened to the first song on this cd it is kind of funky sounding not really country.

Someone better flush him, because he's full of shit."
,aceloader69,2011-07-20T08:25Z,"great down man tell 1975ljg to go stick it.

@1975ljg if you dont try the whole thing then dont comment at all.  Commenting is for people to know what they are getting not what 1 little part of it is."
,redstorm99,2012-05-09T14:27Z,"does every song have the album ""play on"" cover?"
