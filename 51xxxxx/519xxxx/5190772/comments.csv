,vldmyworld,2009-12-01T17:03Z,if u uploaded have the decency and seed it for at least a couple of days...ffs
,moshu,2009-12-01T18:36Z,"According to MMAJunkie the next will be a double episode, so this one is probably fake..."
,ccr12,2009-12-01T18:51Z,"fake? 
Next Episode: 	127: 10x11 -- Heavyweights #11 (Dec/02/2009) [Special Runtime: 120 Min.]"
,SupraCale,2009-12-01T18:59Z,"but in the other seasons its 12 episodes with the #13 as final..
maybe changed this time!?"
,SupraCale,2009-12-01T19:02Z,on .torrenthound.com  everybody comments its a fake 
,Afsender_Ukendt,2009-12-01T23:36Z,"This is legit. It's from Australia, where they split up the last to episodes unlike in the states, where it's a double episode.

Unfortunately nobody seems to have capped the last episode.

Got this yesterday from another site."
,scous3r69,2009-12-01T23:47Z,i must add this is 100% real people it was shown as said above in austrailia on sunday night next ep will be on 2moro :)
,i0y,2009-12-02T02:50Z,"isnt fake and its a ""double"" episode btw.

James McSweeney vs. Matt Mitrione
Marcus Jones (Big Baby) vs. Darrill Schoonover"
,djforti,2009-12-02T03:12Z,U guys forget that alot of shows in the us dont air their episode on thanksgiving week while other coutries could care less about thanksgiving
,djforti,2009-12-02T03:13Z,Oh...and thank you very much. Been craving my TUF fix for the week. 
,djforti,2009-12-02T06:01Z,This is so lame. How the hell are there 924 leechers and 1 seeder. You guys who dont seed are pathetic and selfish. If you are greatful for the opportunity to watch this than have some respect for the process and seed it yourself
,LiverpoolLeon,2009-12-02T06:19Z,wtf man stuck on 96.2% how can there be only 1 seeder? seed!!!!!
,Afsender_Ukendt,2009-12-02T10:24Z,"@ i0y

This is NOT a double episode. Just to clear things up. 

Episode 12 has 2 fights as well (semifinals)"
,kevino90,2009-12-02T14:38Z,When do the E12 come out?
,moshu,2009-12-02T16:37Z,"Just watched this episode and it was awesome - props to i0y.

,yazovyet,2009-12-03T05:33Z,"its real. (50 min with commercials in)
it has commercials and the quality isnt top notch but it is real. "
,peepopaloopo,2009-12-03T06:26Z,wha is titties in this one????
,scarygood48,2009-12-03T14:07Z,"Not the best quality, but watchable.  Also, it is NOT the 2 hour finale.  It is 1 hour.  Anyone find the semi-finals?"
,MMEXX,2009-12-03T14:59Z," Dec-5-2009 11pm on FIVE USA    N/A   FIVEUSA ? TV

Episode 12 Battle Tested

After weeks of hazing by housemates, Zak Jensen finally fights back. Rampage and Rashad have their fiercest faceoff yet. And two semifinal fights in one show. James McSweeney battles Roy Nelson, and Brendan Schaub takes on Rampage's lone fighter, Marcus Jones"
,mark230671,2009-12-03T17:15Z,Gotta be FAKE as show went out 2009-12-02 !!!
,shitstirrer,2009-12-03T18:25Z,Shit picture quality
,neozarathustra,2009-12-03T18:37Z,"OK.  1) This torrent is real and not a fake as others have already commented on.

2)  Where is episode 12 with the semi final fights which according to ufc.com have already finished?

Does anyone know where to get episode 12, or episode 11 in the states which is a 1 hour special with both the quarter final fights (shown in this torrent) and the semi final fights?  The finale is dec 5, so the semi final fights must be over by now."
,erkyesosze,2009-12-03T18:38Z,This IS Episode 11.
,atv81,2009-12-03T19:38Z,"it is real, but its only 55 min long
soo its missing the lest 55min
"
,b3ndaren,2009-12-03T20:33Z,"Where is the 2hour episode from yesterday ?? Should be uploaded already imo !

,henderson_exp,2009-12-03T21:26Z,"here is the real one.  I just uploaded 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5194782/Ultimate_Fighter_S10E11_12"
,boxinghappy,2009-12-04T01:53Z,This is real but very poor quality.
,catamaranman,2009-12-06T02:52Z,"UGH! Awful quality....I mean really awful....like 3 out of 10....If youre a real fan, this isnt going to do it for ya....theres even a few ""skips"" and they seem to be at the worst times....plus all the commercials are still in....terrible... "
,catamaranman,2009-12-06T03:02Z,I dont get it....PARTS of this vid look fine as long as there is not much movement but the fights where theyre jumping around looks like the old Mike Tysons Punchout! 
,catamaranman,2009-12-06T05:02Z,hendersonexp's link above is a MUCH better quality copy......the whole thing too! 1hr 20min+!
