[T],verifire,2009-12-05T06:45Z,"@ServantSeven: Would love to, but E-mule is a bit out of my league. Don't know a thing about it, and when I've tried to connect, I've never gotten any connection with the servers or what ever. I scrapped the whole concept. If you could provide me with a link, I'd be happy to upload it, though. Like ""step-by-step e-muling"" would be fine. Not ""e-muling for dummies"". Takes to long to get into. Hah! :)"
