,pbwizardsleeve,2010-06-09T02:53Z,"In order to play these songs on your PC or Mac you must download and install karaoke software. There are free versions of karaoke software available. If you plug your computer into a speaker, and plug a microphone into a speaker, you will have a complete karaoke system.

A karaoke song consists of 2 files:
(1) an MP3 file, which plays the music and background vocals (without the lead vocal)
    and
(2) a CDG file, which displays the lyrics, and indicates when to sing each line.

Karaoke software can synchronize and play the MP3 and CDG file together, so that the lyrics scroll as the music plays.

Karafun is a shareware player for Windows:

http://www.karafun.com/karaokeplayer

Karafun has a home use version and a public version (karaoke public parties, bars, etc.). You can download Karafun for free, and the free version works great for basic home use.

Drag the files (CDG file and MP3 file) into the main window of the program and the tune will begin playing. Refer to the software's documentation for more detailed information how to play files, create playlists, etc.

Make sure your computer's speakers are on, and there should also be an option to display the lyrics video in full screen mode. Now you are playing a karaoke file, you rock star, you!"
