,razgriz21,2010-01-27T22:50Z,you need a dual layer dvd
,macster2010,2010-02-17T09:38Z,again i will say you do not need to burn this..  just mount it using disk utility..  it says so in the description for christ sakes!!

,SgtMacTavish,2010-12-27T22:30Z,"Hey, could somebody just upload the crack? I downloaded the game folder itself (50gb) and now I have to download this whole thing to play the game out of the demo."
,P1l0t,2011-01-27T18:37Z,Can't install crashes as it starts !! anyone has the same problem?
,ofb,2011-05-09T22:00Z,"There's aproblem with this image file. I D/L'd it, then mounted and burned it to a dual layer dvd, but it won't play. you can't even open to check the files. Must be a corrupted image. Anyone else experience this?"
,ofb,2011-05-09T22:08Z,"macster, I tried mounting it using Daemon Lite... it seems to mount but to where I don't know, so burned image (se my previous comment) And Sgt Mactavish, no cd cracks at http slash m001 dot gamecopyworld dot com slash games slash pc_x-plane dot shtml"
,ofb,2011-05-09T22:23Z,I figured out why this wont mount or burn...this is a .dmg image...IT IS FOR MAC!!! Would have been nice if you told us!! It needs to be converted to an iso before it can be mounted or burned for PC
,0levi0quilliam0,2011-07-25T07:13Z,just buy it its only $30-$40 its so much easier
,dragonblu,2011-07-30T02:49Z,it told me that it want the second disk where can i find that :( 
,readyfire,2011-08-22T05:43Z,"lol@ofg - the game clearly says it's in the category Games > Mac. 

Does anyone know how to mount it using disc utility? Am I supposed to just change the extension to .iso and then double-click? because macster2010 says you don't need to burn it..."
,Mojo_66,2011-09-07T23:30Z,Thanks for sharing!
,Haze1911,2011-10-30T04:31Z,Thanks Anon. I got this game awhile ago and lost disk 1 so i needed an alternate option. Thanks for the help!
