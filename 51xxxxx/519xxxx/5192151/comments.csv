 or is it only for usb and that kind of stuffs"
,zxkb4s29,2009-12-02T15:51Z,"as original did not work and this is only compressed, this is not likely to work too."
,PorcelainZell,2009-12-02T16:20Z,"I repeat, this is ISO-file, compressed with Dolphin, Wii emulator on PC. If u have troubles with emulation - search the Dolphin forum: http://forums.dolphin-emu.com/index.php For me it works same as ISO - fine.
ps. ""can i burn the game on dvd..."" - There is the ""Decompress"" function in Dolphin, but i have not tried it."
