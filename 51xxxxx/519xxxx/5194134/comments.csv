,pezdispenser,2010-01-21T15:09Z,"I have downloaded a bunch of codecs, as well as divx 7 trying to get the best way to play high res movies.  Divx 7 works well but when I hook my laptop up to my tv via HDMI and swith to fullscreen, it's cuttimg off the bottom and right side of the movie and displaying the wall paper and windows toolbar.  When I try and play it with windows media player the speed is too fast and the image jumps forward.  With vista I used MPClassic and loved it.  I have windows 7 and I am trying to get situated.  What is the best media player to use for .mkv's, and other high res videos?  Thanks in advance."
,deadmansink,2010-02-10T02:24Z,"The best playe, so far, is The KMPlayer. It's freeware, reliable download @ CNET. I've tried all players, the next in line would be The GOM Player and then VLC. Windows media/center players are also good, but you can't tweak anything."

A bit late but....
When you watch a movie using a laptop / pc / Mac etc using an HDMI port you will need to:

1. Set the resolution for the port to something the tv/monitor can handle. This should be a 480p/720p/1080p setting. Note: all 'i' versions should (576i/1080i etc) should NOT be used with computers as interlacing is a stone-age broadcast requirement. 720p is a better resolution than 1080i - see wikipedia to find out why.
2. Realise the HDMI output uses an 'overscan' to prevent the 'wobbly edge' issue at the extreme edges of a screen. 'Wobbly edges' were the bane of video tape, but even in the digital days there can be some small issues when a) the chipset is too cheap (in the display or pc) b) the source material was encoded from a poor source Like all Bluray discs before 2009 - no better than upscaled video tape back then. Yes, I am in the industry and know of what I speak. Note: HDDVD did not have this problem because Toshiba cared about video quality but Sony didn't and still don't giv a fuck.
3: Use your graphics card control panel to centre the video output.
4. Use your graphics card control panel to choose the amount of overscan you want.
5: If the image still overscans too much then check your display device has 'overscanning' turned off - otherwise you will have double the overscan.
6. Finally"

Check if the player has an overscan setting too.

I recommend VLC for everything. No matter how much people point at other players VLC is the only one that does everything - either from internal or installed codecs.
