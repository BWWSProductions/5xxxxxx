bottle gives his customers strange hairdos Madame
Glinas, who has been pregnant for the last two decades
and who can't seem to make her cakes rise up anymore the
beautiful belle Lurette who has been crying her eyes out
and peeling petals off daisies ever since her true love
went to War and, last but not least, Babine, the Witch's
son, at odds with the strict shiny-new priest. Discover
the world of Fred Pellerin, a place where oxes can fall
in love and where a clock can grow from where a pocket
watch is sown
