,PeddersOC,2010-02-21T10:53Z,"All right, chaps!

Here's where you can download all the boot floppies you can think of:

This torrent will probably work on both Next and Intel computers.

Alas, I can't tell for sure, because I still don't know how to burn .ufs images... :-("
,vmswift,2010-09-04T09:31Z,"Just change the image from .ufs to .iso and use the boot and driver diskettes mentioned by peddersOC. 

Also, you can burn the image using nero once you change the extension to .iso. Yhough I did get it to burn I haven't tried using a boot disk with it on a real pc.

Also, do not be upset if you cannot view the files on the cd image from windows. 

I can't view the files or anything. I am just happy the boot and driver disk understand it all.

Virutalbox succesfully accessed the cd image for me. 

I think they made the image on linux\unix or unixlike system. For all we know it was put together on an openstep system."
,cranjum,2011-10-21T11:14Z,"This works on VirtualBox 4.1
You need to download the four installation floppies and to disable VTx support in the Acceleration tab in VirtualBox settings. Also, don't configure a hard disk image larger than 4GB.
Here are some installation instructions on an older version of VirtualBox and they work in a similar fashion on newer VirtualBox versions: http://www.nextcomputers.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1663
After installation, apply Patch 4 (for Mach) as described here:
