Nylon Beat was a Finnish pop band that was very popular during 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, consisting of Jonna Kosonen and Erin Koivisto. They received eight gold and seven platinum records and the Band of the Year 1999 Emma award during their active career, which was during 1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003.

The band was formed in 1995 as a result of TV show "Kiitorata". By the time both girls were only 16 years old. They started with backup tracks and dancers. Later their music matured somewhat and finally they performed fully live with a real band consisting of several professional musicians. Most of the music was composed by Risto Asikainen.

Other artists have covered Nylon Beat's songs, most notably popular Korean pop group S.E.S.

Although the duo nominally had already given their final concert on New Year's Eve 2003, they reformed again to perform as an opening band for two Toto gigs: the first was on August 17, 2007 in Oulu and the second on August 18, 2007 in Tampere.
