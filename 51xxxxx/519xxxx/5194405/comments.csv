[V],Subzero!,2009-12-03T19:22Z,"just to wrap that up for the masses, me and king of the kaos krew have checked one of his last releases, mw2, which was a mess... because...

he recoded the movies down to 10% which is quality like un-watchable, same happened to his sound converting...

we (TPTB and KaosKrew) just have the same opinion about this:

Write CLEARLY in your DESCRIPTION (torrent info ya know) what has been recoded,and how much, Kaoskrew and tptb does this as well as all the others before us all...so MoFu you do this as well, or we keep pissing you off, and remember here you CANT delete, re-upload your torrents like you want and like you did on mini... he all the way deleted everything as soon as the people noticed how he fools them with so called FuLL GAME, or direct.play, he even doesnt understand the meaning of direct.play (unrar+play), ahwell, now you all think about, especially you mofu called globe...
and for the others, i give a fuck for one or 2 more hater!. i dont care, its just people should know what they download, shouldnt they??????

Cheeeeers  in the name of rippyDippyRollinRonny incorporated hate ltd."

,ripripboy,2009-12-04T17:36Z,"@Subzero!

dude u get the TopBitch award in piratebay.Why do u go abt posting negative comments on others torrents while ur own games aren't compressed to optimum standards and most don't work properly.
spend a little more time on quality testing ur releases than bitching all day in piratebay.

PS: ur saboture game double the size was FAIL !"
,leechgod,2009-12-04T23:12Z,"globe.......just ignore d negative comments,u r d best gamerip uploader ur torrents hav d smallest size........& v get 2 play d game.....thatz wot all that counts,cheers globe U R D KING OF GAME RIPPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!keep up d gud work.................................LOTZ OF LOVE FROM INDIA"

THANKS"
[V],gansuk,2009-12-06T22:44Z,"now were do i start...
movie recode 10% of original, resolution resized to 320X240, all foreign audio was removed (movie & ingame), took me almost 3days to download,. he forgot to mention in the description theres a file to run after you un7zip it to rebuild, the file also runs in background so you have no clue its even working. it takes a hell of alot longer than 10mins to rebuild, and we tested it on a quadcore. theres no reg data so the gamelauncher wouldn't even start (asks u to install). the instructions look like they were wrote by a child with learning difficulties. pls globe upgrade your movies i would be ashamed at the moment to have them played on my mobile phone. and get somebody who knows english to do your nfo's."
[V],Subzero!,2009-12-07T00:37Z,"WELL SAID!... he and all his gayish fans doesnt gets the fact that we dont care which version is shorter and which not!. WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT NOT MENTION THE INFOs NEEDED in the description!. this is a NO GO, here is A GO , thats how it should look like!..(in this case here)

hello pc great games ""fooled"" fans %)&

...ops.. wrong start.. (broken keyboard ya know! ;) ) sorry... 
hereyago.

ripped:
all foreign audio was removed (movie & ingame)

recoded:
movie recode 10% of original, resolution resized to 320X240 (he seems to be a pc great IPOD games fan!, best viewed on yer mobile phone!)

that THE INFO missing here peeeeps... and 
every release group (man/gal) does since there are pirates around,  ...writing things like the above... just to GIVE THEIR DOWNLOADERS the correct info about ""what they download"".

Quote of the day for me!

""by a child with learning difficulties""

What dont u fools not understand! Ye his english is not perfect,but unless you are a total retard or a spa..you should have no problem following his instructions, which leads me to believe that the above named are either spa's or full retards
and if that is the case you's have my sympathy

,BLACK75sm,2009-12-07T02:42Z,"sorry not [Jansuck] i ment [Gansuck]
PS.... Took less than 5mins on my quadcore to rebuild,oh and everybody on mininova seemed more than happy with globe's game uploads.with well more than 100 comments on each torrent,and idont think i ever read a bad comment..people want the game not the videos.and globe's are a nice size for download."
,siim357,2009-12-07T17:24Z,um guys where the fuck  is this ' Globe Converter ' thing??? where the heck is it??? 
,BLACK75sm,2009-12-07T21:43Z,"@siim357
when finished downloading,extract the rar file and move the extracted folder to your desktop,then open that folder it should be there just double click it,,,,,
there will be instructions there by globe,just follow them step by step.
hope i was of some help..."
,pagudpudxiii,2009-12-07T23:31Z,what's happening with all the rippers fighting each other?
,pagudpudxiii,2009-12-07T23:32Z,"hey,

is there any problem?
because when I read all the comments,
it's all about sh!ts and etc.
let us focus to this rip, shall we?
please?"
,pagudpudxiii,2009-12-07T23:33Z,"Hey,

because when I read the comments,
I always read some sh!ts and etc.

,altappy,2009-12-08T11:05Z,"yeah the game works well on a high end rig,its a buggy game so i guess older pcs wont be able to handle it that well, nothing wrong with the rip, though thanx globe ur the man."

,C.tech-99,2009-12-12T15:38Z,"my experiences whit globe@ 

all of his games workout 4 me, but sometime the will need some extra work like putting a new crack or dll. file in.
thats fine 4 people that know there way around not so for the noob.

on minni... he placed a torrent m@fia 2  inside was m@fia 1 and he switch the name after complains 

some off his torrents take 4ever to download
but this is up to the seeders

people that ask 4 help get most off the time (some) help from globe@ 

i like the games and appreciate his work    (most off the time) everybody makes mistakes 

so u be he judge off his work and do not always believe what u reed

to globe@: keep them coming end i will be seeding

,funkyalto,2009-12-17T11:43Z,"I've been having an odd problem with your torrent
I follow the instructions then when I launch Globe Converter.exe, in the instructions, it says wait 10 - 5 minutes but 2 different things happen alternating with each launch, the first time i launched it, a wmv file popped up playing the opening theme and then the game opened and it wouldn't get past the loading page.
every other time i try to launch any of the exe files that would, as i assume, launch the game, the game doesn't get past the loading page.
What should I do?"
,BLACK75sm,2009-12-18T02:56Z,"@funk
1 make sure your system can handle minimum  requirements
2 repeat install
3 update directX
4 update physx
5 close all background apps wile converting"
,funkyalto,2009-12-21T10:59Z,"no matter what i try, it still won't get past the loading page after the EA intro short ends
what do i do?"
,mr-dante,2009-12-24T22:41Z,"i am ''half'' agreed with globe and subzero xd : 
- first what globe does is very good ''talking 'bout low sizes here'' but lowering the qualities of the video and audio makes playing the game a real mess.

- the other rippers ''skull...tptb....'' does many realeases peeeeerfectly.

please globe..just next time DO NOT LOWER JUST THE SOUNDS cuz they are the most important.Do what u want for the movies...they are just there to understand the story. ^^"
,funkyalto,2009-12-25T16:50Z,"globe can you help me?
there is no install, when i press install it closes
the farthest i can get is the loading page after the EA games intro, it loops the loading page after that for ever
I don't know what to do"

Just follow the instructions and makesure ur system can run it and there should be no problems!"
,hitec1691,2010-03-30T20:05Z,can anyone tell me the size of the game after extracting it i m kinda low on disk space i m hav 7GB in drive D: 
,hitec1691,2010-04-01T15:36Z,even i m stuck at loading screen!! anyone has a solution for it i hav updated my drivers and physx and all but it still doen't work!!!!
,hitec1691,2010-04-01T21:12Z,alright i i will have to admit that subzero is right in saying that proper instructions were not provided after extracting the file the size of the folder is 7.69GB then you have to run globe converter the problem is if you don't have enough disk space then the game won't work u need atleast 14 to 15 GB of free space in total to extract the game and then run globe conveter which is of course no given in instructions.After running converter all the extra files will be deleted and the game size will be around 5.10GB. All those who were not able to get past the loading screen then low disk space  or not running globe converter is the reason for that.
