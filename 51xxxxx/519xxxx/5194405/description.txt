* STORY :

* The player will be able to explore Nazi-occupied Paris and some of the countryside. Color will be a key element in the gameplay, and players will experience an Okami-esque style when entering certain parts of the city. In order to make that district colored ("happy") again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens will regain their hope, characterized by the "Will to Fight" (WtF) factor.In areas with low WtF, the area is dark, with color being various shades of grey (with the exception of several German flags, bright red and complete with swastika), whereas in areas with high WtF, the area is vibrant and with full color.

WtF also affects gameplay, as in areas with low WtF, the area is filled with German soldiers who patrol in most places of the map in large numbers.
 
It is up to the player to return color to areas of darkness.In areas with high WtF, the Germans will not be completely evicted, but they will no longer be everywhere at once, and will primarily be centered around military bases, barracks, police stations, HQs, and other strategically important areas. In addition, the French people will play an active role in the struggle for areas with high WtF. For example, if Sean, the main character, gets in a fight with German patrols, allies like the French Resistance, Maquis, and even French passersby will intervene against the occupiers.

The primary missions will revolve around exacting revenge on high-ranking German officers and officials, and getting to the point to be able to exact vengeance. However, the presence of secondary optional missions has also been confirmed. The effects will include access to new weapons and raising the WtF for certain regions.

Players will be able to navigate the environment with a dynamic set of moves, allowing for the use of different tactics in order to complete their objectives.
