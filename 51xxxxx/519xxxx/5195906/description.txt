Jacobs Dream quickly rose to the top of the global Progressive Metal heap with

their astounding 2001 self - titled debut and the 2003 follow up release

"Theater Of War". Metal scribes around the globe likened the band as a more

powerful Queensryche and Maiden - esque in the "Powerslave" era. After releasing

three classic power/prog metal masterpieces on the immortal Metal Blade Records,

the band took some time off and now returns several years later with their

comeback release on Retroactive Records. "Beneath the Shadows" is a concept

album based on a story written by vocalist, Chaz Bond. The theme of the album is

an intriguing tale, centering around the choices, experiences and decisions of

Camren, the main character, who struggles to find his way in and out of darkness

and into the light. Bond is a critically acclaimed vocalist in the prog/power

metal genre and often compared to Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden), Geoff Tate

(Queensryche), and Jimmy Brown (Deliverance). The soaring vocal melodies are

hook-filled and charismatic. The guitar work is thick, powerful metal, filled

with great riffs and hooks. Look no further for powerful, intelligent lyrics and

top notch METAL!
