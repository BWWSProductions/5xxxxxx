        READ NFO NOTE:

        First this is not a MU or a regular version update.  CX2D 3 was
        pred hours ago and 4 was delayed to having some tests run as its
        first time being used.  Both CX2D 3 and CX2D 4 had updates done
        to them and are two different applications.  Similar to this is
        Ashampoo's updates to previous editions.  Surely people are going
        to say the same as Burning Studio, that it's heading towards
        bloatware and they will stick with CX2D 3.  Well we give you that
        choice with continued updates to both editions, but don't expect
        3 to recieve many more updates as 4 will be VSO's main focus now.

        Install vsoConvertXtoDVD4_setup.exe.  After installation copy
        precracked files into ConvertXtoDVD's installed folder

        existing files.  You now have a fully registered version of
        ConvertXtoDVD 4!

        Included is the manual as CX2D 4 is more technical now and not
        thought as a easy to use single click converter now (hate it or
        like it).

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
