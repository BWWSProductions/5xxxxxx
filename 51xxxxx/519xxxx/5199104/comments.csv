,ljodnster,2009-12-09T01:20Z,Make sure you seed.
,andy135,2009-12-09T09:09Z,mine says it needs the CD what do i do??
,ljodnster,2009-12-09T14:42Z,"After installing all the files, open up Asian Dynasties with Toast (torrent it if you don't have it), and open up the Asian Dynasties app.  You'll be able to get at any of the campaigns, features, etc. from the Asian Dynasties app."
,funky11,2009-12-09T20:54Z,"I can open and play age of empires 3 perfectly fine but when I try and open either of the expansions it asks to insert the disk

ljod I can't open up the application files in my torrent app should I be downloading toast?"
,ljodnster,2009-12-11T02:04Z,"Toast is a must, not only for these files but for mac gaming in general.  It's a pretty fast torrent and you can get by a lot of tiresome cracking and complicated installs by just mounting the .dmg or .toast with Toast."
,Delivius,2009-12-11T19:57Z,"1. Go to the ordner Age of Empire III + Expansions(Mac)


2 .Mount and Install Age of Empire 3 + The WarChiefs and The Asian Dynasties in your application ordner

3. Open Age 3 - The Asian Dynasties.dmg (i have renamed it with .toast) with the programm Toast and mount/burn it on a CD!  - NOT DVD!! -
(I have open with Roxio Toast 6 Titanium)

4. Open/double-click on Age of Empires III - The Asian Dynasties and have fun to play =)

ps. sorry for my bad english :P"
,ljodnster,2009-12-13T15:26Z,I've found that on my and my friends macs the burning to a cd step is unnecessary.  For me and all of them just mounting it with Toast was enough.
,funky11,2009-12-14T03:15Z,"so, again sorry for being a tech noob, i'm trying to learn how to do all this sort of stuff now. I downloaded toast 7 and put in both expansion apps. Do I need to burn them to dvds? or cds? or not burn them at all? Basically I guess I am a little fuzzy on what it means to mount something with toast"
,Delivius,2009-12-14T17:10Z,"Mac ask you after the really CD AoE 3 - Asian Dynasties, so you have to burn to a CD and NO DVD!"
,funky11,2009-12-14T20:20Z,"burned CD and when I try to open the game it says I need to free up space on my local disk. I have plenty of space on my computer, boy this whole process is confusing"
,AOE3BESTEVER,2009-12-15T00:31Z,"Goodness, you all sound as though you need a degree to install Age of Empires!

Although i didnt download Age of Empires 3 for Mac from this particular torrent i got mine working with 2 simple steps.

Step 1: Install AOE3 and/or Expansions

Step 2: Update AOE3 to the latest patch (1.05) and then update the expansions to the latest patch. heres a link to all the patches
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Its that easy!

Now Age of Empire 3 should even work online, no crack needed because the latest updates remove the cd check, just download Gameranger create a free account and your good to go.

Hope this helps. If you still cant get Age of Empires III to work then its because you failed to follow my simple steps.

See you on the battlefield! xD"
,funky11,2009-12-15T06:58Z,"aoe3... you are the best ever

,ionlyknow,2009-12-19T16:18Z,Very good torrent! Everything worked perfectly! I've been playing for a few hours now ^^ 
,bertolv,2009-12-30T00:32Z,"awesome torrent! everything works great but, is anyone having problems of saved games suddenly not being there to reload? is there something i need to do?"
,xxxangerxxx,2010-01-03T05:00Z,"Right Delivius!, only I would add rename the file AsianDynasties.toast directly in your Mac Finder without making Roxio-Toast."
,lonelystoner,2010-01-13T02:00Z,"do not listen to anyone's instructions except aoe3bestever (and mine) 
1.download and install the games 
2. go to the link aoe3bestever gave 
3. download all the patches and 
4. update the game and expansion with patches
5. enjoy!

,Kev_Re,2010-02-04T01:03Z,Dose this WORK ??
,newman84,2010-02-19T17:42Z,"Thanks ljodnster! I've been playing for some hours.

That was an easy installation. And without the need of cracks!"
,Maximus1111,2010-04-06T22:36Z,"I did it, then I played asian dynasties, and it wouldnt play anything else"
,mrcnKAL,2010-05-11T18:09Z,"1)I installed all the expansions and game
2)Updated them with the link that AOE3 shared

But i can't play.Every single game errors like ""Initialization Failed.Game::initializeBasic() failed.""

I dont have toast so i didn't mount anything.Must I?Please send an email to umurcan-mrcn@hotmail.com"
,BruenorBattlehammer,2010-05-16T15:12Z,"Great torrent, works perfectly for AOE3 and both expansions. 

Follow the instructions posted by AOE3BESTEVER on 2009-12-15 to the letter and you should have no problems. No need to mount with Toast.

Thanks for a great upload ljodnster and thanks for AOE3BESTEVER for the useful installation instructions! "
,michel118,2010-07-22T17:54Z,"please, how i fix the dvd insert prompt?"
,KWhobrey,2010-08-06T03:13Z,"Runs great for me. Some videos dont show though, but the gaming works excellent. Thanks ljodnster"
,popo0514,2010-08-16T15:12Z,"Update to the latest patch, it won't run the CD check. "
,taylor2906,2010-08-21T20:28Z,"hey um i have a mac book pro this game will work on it right? also whenever i mount it with toast, it goes to itunes as a audio file, and how the hell do i install the game. please help me i love this game!"
,common82,2010-08-26T15:24Z,"The Expansions don't work for me. I tried everything. Burning it on a CD making a image-file and even downloaded the newest patch. AOEIII works fine but the expansions always ask for the original CD.
Any help?"
,kenkaniffx96,2010-09-01T18:35Z,"so I this game is working fine for me, but every time I want to play a skirmish, I start with 20,000 of every resource. Is it possible to remove this? I just want to play the game without cheats when I play skirmish or deathmatch. "
,byrd420,2010-10-22T17:03Z,Torrent isnt even starting to download. fairly new to torrents. using transmission
,nitesh973,2011-01-08T20:31Z,cool work great thank you ljodnster :)
,iagolima,2011-01-11T01:35Z,"I successfully mount the image with toast 10 on my macbook pro 10.6.4, but when I drag the app to the applications folder, it just stays forever estimating the remaining time and in the end fails saying that some data can be read or written. is the file corrupted? should I try downloading it again?
I can`t copy the file to my computer (it is in an external hard drive) for the same reasons."
,agipaok,2011-02-16T15:17Z,After update ... why only the original AOE3 starts and not the expansions?
,azamudio,2011-03-05T07:21Z,"Best installation instructions: 
1.Install AOE III. 
2.Install update. 
3. Play game once, to have the game set up folders, etc. 
4. Install Warchiefs. 
5. Install Warchiefs update. See specs on this update, as it says NO DISC needed anymore when you install it.
Now, NO DISC needed to play at all. Worked fine for me. Having much fun playing PERFECTLY! (using 10.6)"
,thecharles,2011-03-09T01:25Z,"Wow, this is making feel dumb...

I mounted with toast... which file do I use to install? What program do I use to open it? I've tried the obvious files, autorun, setup, etc., with terminal but no luck... seeing as how everyone is having problems later than I am, hopefully this is an easy problem to rectify...

anyone wanna throw me a frickin' bone here?"
,thecharles,2011-03-09T01:28Z,"I used Toast 8 Titanium... under 'copy' in the menu bar at the left I am using 'image file,' selecting the iso, and 'mounting.' They appear as discs in my finder window but as I said, they're full of what appear to be windows files..."
,mclaud1983,2011-04-23T20:07Z,"VERY SIMPLE IF YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS !!
