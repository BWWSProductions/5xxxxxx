,jocvi,2010-06-10T15:01Z,"When file is downloaded just click right click, rename and add "".iso"" in the end. Then go to nero, click ""Copy and Backup"" then burn image. Choose renamed iso file and burn with slowest burn speed (2.4x or 4x). When finished put CD in PS2 and play. Enjoy!"

,davidbar,2010-07-21T19:56Z,"I think this game is not PES 2010, I think this game is Winning Eleven modificated, maybe...

Languages are english, neederland, swedish, russian and greek"
,MoleP,2010-07-30T05:01Z,"Ok, @Everybody!
First thing is first! THIS IS A GOOD UPLOAD & IT'S WORKING FINE!
It's PES 2010 with 5 languages including English.

Download and rename it and type .ISO to the end and burn it at 4x speed with your favorite DVD burning software and put it in to your moded or swap PS2 and it should work like a charm!
Thanks "
