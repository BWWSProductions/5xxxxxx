Nine inch nails banged and blown through is a live audio compilation from the 2009 tour.  
One source of every song played live from this time frame were complied together to make 
one continuous concert.  The sources for each song were chosen for a reason that made them 
stand out over all the others.  Sometimes the sources had unique and/or emphases on lyrics 
and instrumentals while other had fuckups that somehow made them better.

There were 66 concert sources that the songs were picked, from that 33 of them were used.  
The order of the track list was chosen before the sources so there are some problems with 
track transitions.  Mainly volume level is an issue with some adjacent tracks because 
actual alteration to the tracks themselves is kept to a minimum.  You can only amplify 
a track so much before it starts to sound bad.

I was at the Webster Hall concert in NYC so the first part of the compilation is inspired 
by that nightÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s performance.  The rest of the track list was created based on track flow 
and what sounded good to me.  All of the encores from the final nights of the wave goodbye 
club tour were used throughout the compilation.  The source of the song ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬In This TwilightÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â® 
is from the final night and it is the last nine inch nails song played live, so enjoy it
 (crying is totally acceptable here).

This project was complied and mixed entirely by me.  Cover art made by ETS member MAD. 
 The audio recordings were recorded by the following tapers: RyanJ, dpieper, Dime, JB, 
tooligan, edgar, shotyd, DSM6, TheBang, Reaper, brianblank, ScreamingSlave, s(solitude), 
Jofa, gladcarrot, NINSlave, sin213, R-09HR, and coolerluzi.  Out of the respect for all 
of those great guys please keep their recordings in Lossless formats.  Only convert to
 mp3ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s for personal use and do not share publicly.  Last but not least, Thank You 
Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor, Robin Finck, Justin Meldal-Johnson, and Ilan Rubin, 
you guys are fucking awesome.
