[V],twentyforty,2009-12-03T18:47Z,"I have ""Tahoe"" but this rip and DVDR has been blacklisted AND DELETED on all file-hosting  sites.
It usually means that that specific title is closely monitored by ""protectors of innocence and righteousness"".
So, I have it, but upping such title is bad idea, for you, for me and it must be  frozen for time being. "
[V],twentyforty,2009-12-03T21:43Z,"Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough:
What I've said concerns file-hosting sites - you can see it for yourself - term was file-hosting.
TPB, or any other torrent site is file-sharing site.
These two things differs substantially.

What I've trying to say to you was following:
IF I have troubles finding whatever title I look for, and I find 99% percent of those files deleted, removed, or marked as ""copyright infringement possible"" IT SHOWS, VERY CLEARLY, that that title is ""hot"" - you know what that means, right?
It is INDICATIVE, what processes are in motion.

Further, some titles - even newer or more attractive have not been marked as ""hot do not touch"". Why is that, I have no idea.

I am aware of torrent you've mentioned, as many others of this title, but that is not the thing I just spelled out.
Try to understand what is my POV in jazz like this.
BTW, no hard feelings, OK?"
