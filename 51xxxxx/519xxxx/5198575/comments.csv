,simoncuynen,2010-01-05T07:33Z,"thanks, also very good movie!"
,Kekkai,2010-01-24T06:56Z,"Ryno444:  To the guy who wants to turn OFF THE SUBTITLES... sorry about caps, just trying to get your attention :)   When you turn the movie on, don't put the .srt file in the same directory or if you don't think you'll EVER want subtitles, when you go to download it, don't leave the .srt file checked.. just download the actual .avi or .mkv or whatever the movie is ""in"" - to make it easiest,, use utorrent, it asks which files you want to download out of the entire torrent - uncheck the subtitles (but you might want them if you can't quite make part of the movie out) - or keep the .srt or .ssa (those are both kinds of subtitle files) and either move it to a different directory before you start watching the movie, or rename the .srt or .ssa file to .oldsrt or oldssa. or whatever - until you want subtitles, then fix the name of the file and it will display :)"
