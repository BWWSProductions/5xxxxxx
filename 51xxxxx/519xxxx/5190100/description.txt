On October 6, The Clientele will release their 5th album, Bonfires on the Heath on CD, LP and digital download.
The Clientele formed a long time ago in the backwoods of suburban Hampshire, playing together as kids at school, rehearsing in a thatched cottage remote from any kind of music scene, but hypnotized by the magical strangeness of Galaxie 500 and Felt and the psych pop of Love and the Zombies.
Bonfires on the Heath is in a sense a return to the Clienteleâ€™s roots; the dreamlike suburban landscapes first encountered in the early singles, their trippy sense of menace stronger now. Now in London, theyâ€™ve drawn on older traditions of English folk, which exist here side by side with the bandâ€™s more familiar bossa and pop elements. Mel Draiseyâ€™s contributions on piano and violin add beautifully to MacLeanâ€™s timeless, eerie songs.
