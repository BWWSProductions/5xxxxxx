,yuna27,2009-12-19T02:03Z,"Thanks guys, works with Razor1911's game and the patches I downed up to 1.7.9 from http://www.simprograms.com/the-sims-3-patches/patches-the-sims-3/

I wonder, noob that I am, say there's a crack for 1.8 ... How will I patch this cracked 1.7 to 1.8? When patching a cracked file, it gives an error right?"
,Vincent8,2009-12-20T18:10Z,"The crack doesn't work and the download includes a dodgy program. Instructions say you should install it, hell no. 
From readme- 
""4.  RUN FAH.exe. 
(installs Folding@home which utilizes spare CPU cycles to conduct scientific research***)""
I don't need that shit? probably virus/trojan/malware."
,Vincent8,2009-12-20T18:40Z,"After a few tries the game actually started, don't know what the problem was.."
,yuna27,2009-12-20T20:19Z,"@Vincent8: I never read the instructions or used the FAH exe file. Just use the TS3.exe AFTER patching up to 1.7.9.

I also suggest adding all your downloads (riverview, clothes and stuff) before patching anything. Thats how I did it.
First the game
then the downloads installed through the TS3Loader
then the patching
then the cracking.

Just wonder if someone releases a crack for patch 1.8, how Im gonna do that. 0.0"
,autumnanox,2009-12-21T23:47Z,"Yeah, don't install FAH.exe - it has nothing to do with the game - it's just some crap to leech your CPU.  I accidentally installed it and now I can't figure out how to uninstall it."
,meke7,2009-12-29T05:35Z,"Guys help, can't get to work. My game was working with standart version/patch/crack and I couldnt update because of crack there. So I reinstalled the game (original files there) applied the internacional patch 1.6.6 (original), applied 1.7.9 and then added the crack.

When executing TS3 I get the error about that: ""Error in service initialization"". I Reinstalled two times following that and still error.

I do know this crack works, but Im getting this error.


And takes so long to install, please helpme out."
,Archadeas,2010-02-07T08:06Z,you need to disconnect from the internet to get a sim crack to work. It seems to connect to the internet to verify.
,Ypthor,2010-02-26T23:02Z,"Here's how it worked for me:

1. install ""Razor 1911 Final MAXSPEED"" version
2. apply 1.0.631-to-1.6.6 patch
3. apply 1.6.6-to1.7.9 patch
4. overwrite TS3.exe
5. !! use TS3.exe to start the game

I tried using the launcher, didn't work."
,SailorPirateFace,2010-05-10T01:15Z,"So, I installed the The Sims 3 - Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED and did everything exactly as I was told to do. Then I copied the file from the 'old-original' folder and replaced the previous in the bin. But every time I go to run the v1. 6. 6 update it tells me ""Update Error: Invalid File Found"". What does this mean and what am I doing wrong?"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-05-13T07:55Z,"@SailorPirateFace
Read whats wrong in the error message ,
you must have done everything correctly, try to install everything again"
