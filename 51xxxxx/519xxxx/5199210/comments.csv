You probably have a relatively new pc with a brand. if this is the case, don't bother with xp, because most of those money-grabbing companies somehow disallow audio/network drivers for xp on newer machines. download 7 and be done with it.

,ENCHY.tpb,2010-01-20T06:39Z,"@JamesH12

A lot of laptops nowadays come with SATA harddrives. When XP came out, SATA technology was not ready/made yet. You can install it by adding extra drivers (monitor,LAN,harddrive,graphics card, etc..) over the internet.

OR..

You can change your harddrive from SATA to ATA, enabling you to install XP with no problems (maybe?). Just boot up your computer, wait until it says ""Press F2 for Setup/BIOS"" or something like that. Then enter BIOS and change it there.
Just google 'SATA ATA BIOS changing'. It's different for a lot of computers.

Hope that helps.   :P

PS:I've tried installing XP on my parents computer so many times now. Hopefully this copy works  *fingers crossed*"
,JamesH12,2010-01-20T11:04Z,"ENCHY.tpb, Thanks for replying, I currently have a Fujitsu Siemens computer.

,ENCHY.tpb,2010-01-21T03:37Z,"@JamesH12
No problem, I enjoy helping :P

I do not own a Fujitsu Computer, so my advice might not be accurate. When booting up the computer, press the F2 (or F12) button. This should enter you in BIOS.
From there you should (I'm looking at Google pictures) see:

Main -- Advanced -- Security -- Boot -- Info -- Exit

From there, you should be able to move through the BIOS. Find the Hard Drive options, and change from SATA to ATA. Once again, because I do not own a Fujitsu Siemens computer I cannot verify this to be 100% accurate. 

Hope this work :P"

also a plugin exists for Firefox(if u use it) remove the plugin, delete npLegitCheckPlugin.dll from the Mozilla Firefox\plugins\ folder
...and obviously dont install KB949810 (office validation) these 2 are the most prominent to avoid.

THEN install windows 7, and restore your data.  XP's boot.ini doesn't know about 7 (it didn't exist when it was written) but Windows 7's boot manager should see it, and boot to a boot menu.

I don't know if I'm booting it wrong or what.. but every time I mount it with magic disk, it pulls up the installation screen, but it doesn't let me click on the ""Install Windows XP"" And I burned the ISO to a CD, but everytime I restart my PC and boot from the CD ROM it doesn't d anything on start up.. Any ideas? Please?"
,chickenhawkportland,2010-02-08T14:35Z,yes if you boot to the disk you can wipe your harddrive and start all over.  however i would save your c:\windows\inf file to a dvdr or cdr disk because this edition will not have all your drivers

What iso program did you use, and did you burn at a slow speed? Slightest missing bit can cause it too fail. Have you forced a re-check? Did you download wirelessly?

I think you have 2 options.
1. Download a different xp torrent. A hassle, but there are some more up to date versions and they may be more compatible with your pooter.
2. Get Alcohol and burn it with that. It is better at burning iso files.
I have the same problem as you, one computer runs it fine another comes up with missing dlls. I ended up doing both of the above.
Before you swear at me when neither of these work, just remember, it's Saturday night and I'm sat here.....I already know I'm a sad fuck :)"

,SALAVATOR,2010-06-08T18:20Z,"Hey all,,, Titlemanager I've downloaded this and scanned ISO file with Kaspersky and it came up with 
"" riskware not-a-virus:PSWTool.Win32.RAS.g "" and 
"" riskware not-a-virus:PSWTool.Win32.RAS.a "" 

I have surfed the web to find more about this and is apparently a hack tool for lost XP keys and at worst a back door into your PC.What I wanna know is why the program was placed in the ISO file and what does it actually do ???.I have found if you actually install the hack yourself as administrator there's no problem but being incorporated and injected into the install process I'm a bit concerned as it would become part of the operating system.I know some hack tools are false positives and some are just damn right nasty.
I don't wanna sound like an ungrateful cunt an all after downloading a free program but don't wanna be an angry bastard after my bank accounts are empty or my identity is stolen.
I just want a clean untouched XP pro SP3 and find a VLC code for it without the added extras.If anyone has any sensible info about my findings please post."
,SALAVATOR,2010-06-08T18:27Z,I should also mention this torrent was installed onto a separate hardrive on my PC and then scanned thoroughly with Kaspersky on a previously installed XP on another hardrive I want to replace and seems to be apparently  clean as a whistle so far.

I tried to get into my BIOS, but there was a password requirement. I'm sure I could get in before, and I have no memory of setting a password. Did the BIOS password reset due to OS change (to factory settings when we bought the computer), is it inherent in the OS itself (meaning all of us using this torrent have the same BIOS password now) or is it unrelated to OS changes (as in I simply didn't know the password to begin with)? 

Anyone have any clue?"

,dougan317,2010-06-21T18:58Z,"WORKING 100%

This is my experience with this one.  

So... I downloaded, burned iso using Nero 6, and installed it onto my Acer Aspire One 751h. I put the disc into external optical drive, set bios to boot from USB-CD, it automatically rebooted. Then it started to initializing XP setup, asked me to choose partition (I had Ubuntu before, so there were two partitions - one smaller for the system boot), then it asked me to format the partition I selected. It was formatting for a while, then it started with installing windows. It did not asked for a key, only to set the name and the name of the company. After that it asked me to set administration password and set the date and time... 

Eventually it finished installation and system restarted itself. I unplugged the optical drive, set bios to boot from harddrive and rebooted again. 

After that Windows loaded, fully working, but there were almost no drivers, so I had to download drivers from the Acer support site (for graphics, sound, touchy devicel (XD), etc....). 

So right now the system is updating itself automatically and works 100%. It is definitely virus free (checked on NOD and Avast). Hope it will be working so good as it is working now.

@ everyone who are confused:

- Download the torrent with any torrent software. Use image burning software to burn the image file (I used alchohol with lowest speed.) It will create an auto bootable CD. So don't need to worry about bootable cd.

-Change boot sector from bios and boot from CD.

-Rest will be done with your minimum commonsense, you should have it if you dare to go for a windows set up. It does not require a product key and update works fine. It will ask for a product key if you install without booting from cd. so boot from CD.

-Dont forget to seed.

-Hats off the uploader."

Nice piece of crap you got on here.
TO THOSE WHO WANT A SUCCESSFUL INSTALLATION AND/O UPGRADE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"
,torrent_,2010-11-10T16:12Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!
THE DISK IS MISSING FILES!
IT WON'T INSTALL!
BETTER OFF LOOKING SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
,torrent_,2010-11-10T17:24Z,"Disregard the earlier comment.
During install after I entered the license key(s) internet explorer gives me an error saying ""ident.cab"" UNKNOWN PUBLISHER. If I skip it I get another error later on saying: ""error copying 'a891cw7x.sys' the file is missing. If I skip that it still won't install.
Does anybody have an explanation for this??"
,ninjatakedown,2010-11-11T11:09Z,"It asked for serial key, and most of all you don't fucking tell us if it's retail, OEM or VL.
