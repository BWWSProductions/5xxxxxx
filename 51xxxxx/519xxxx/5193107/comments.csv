Seeding..."
,k0ld,2010-03-02T13:57Z,"Seed please, stuck at 91%"
,PDash,2010-03-08T18:39Z,PCHPS...... Destroy Windows Media Player... and go download yourself VLC player.. just google it.  I have not run into a file YET that cannot be played in VLC.  MILLIONS of files.  Not ONE came up unplayable.
,nomad13666,2010-04-14T22:45Z,"Thanks to all who say 'thanks'!

For any of you having 'problems' playing any of the episodes, maybe use VLC Media Player or install the KLite Mega Codec Pack and use Media Player Classic...

My Sons of Anarchy torrents have been downloaded tens of thousands of times, and the files are playable on both computer and DVD players that are DivX compatible...

A shitty carpenter blames his tools.

,CNmeBeast,2010-04-25T18:17Z,you are the man! thank you.
,axxoflwr,2010-04-29T10:19Z,"Thanks for the Upload... GREATLY appreciated.. is one Phenomenal show...

and, If your watching any video files on your comp.  and your not using VLC player (can Google it, its free and hands down, the BEST player out there) your dumb.  lol.. Get VLC and you'll never have another Video related problem... hell.. once and a while, if a Video file is ""Broken"", VLC has an option to Auto-Fix it, and then, its good as new.. just get the app.  it'll end ALL of your watching problems... 

Again, Thanks for this Upload...  You're the Man

(oh, and if ya dont know, any Burning to disc should be done with ConvertXTODVD   search it on TPB.)  just like VLC, you should never have problems with this as well, and its VERY user friendly... Peace"
,juggazappadad,2010-05-27T19:52Z,is it possible to get the dvd extras from a torrent
,Azazel237,2010-06-06T14:34Z,"To everyone praising VLC player, is not that user friendly for some of the noobs on here so for them they need to get media player classic with sharky's codec pack or even easier zoom player as it will auto download all the codes you need at the time of install. Thanks for the awsomness NOMAD"

,RobTortureWright,2011-08-14T14:06Z,"People don't listen to Erx31 he is a whining bitch who is talking shit about the quality and is probably doing it so you will go download his trash torrent, GREAT quality and SOA is very fast becoming my favorite show which i dont say often because i watch LOTS of shows. keep up the good work NOMAD13666. P.S anybody know where i can download the SOA extra's ????"

,snoww01,2011-09-23T06:39Z,Thank you yet again! The Sons are it!! Love it. V 10 a 10 Great download. Took 1 whole day.
,robbheb82,2011-09-26T14:24Z,"Nomad i've downloaded alot of your torrents but this one isn't that great, yes i have many players and all the codec packs before ppl start bitching.

i'm not griping just letting ppl know that THIS torrent has problems the video skips in ALL of the episodes and is pretty bad.

if your reading this i'd look for another DL, BUT nomads torrent for season one and season three of SOA are perfect as is most of his work.

i give this torrent A-10(sounds is perfect)
                          V-4(skips and freezes every so often)

and yes i've tried everything to ensure it wasnt on my end before posting.

reguardless of this torrent/post keep up the good work nomad!!"
