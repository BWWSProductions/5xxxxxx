Lightweight Download Manager

Leech gives you complete control over your downloads. You can queue, pause and resume downloads, download from password-protected servers and store your passwords in your system-wide, secure keychain. And you won't have to worry about downloads that were disrupted by a crashing browser ever again.




Instructions:

1 - Open "Leech 1.1.4 [K] UB"

2 - Drag "Leech.app" to patch it.
