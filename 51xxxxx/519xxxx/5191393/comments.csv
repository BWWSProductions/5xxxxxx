Cheers for the upload EZTV.

There's 3 different possibilities which would cause the phenomenon alluded to thus far which i can fathom.

I am intrigued as to which one they end up with or if it turns into utter bunkum, i hope not because as i've said before recently, indeed a great many times in the past, sci-fi creators do not need to employ bunkum science and trot, reality is so much stranger than fiction thought up by some writers so sci-fi should use proper sciences not fantasy science.

More real quantum and temporal sciences, cosmology and physics in general, etc, will help our species to evolve and make even more breakthroughs because it serves to teach and compliment proper sciences in an enjoyable format where people don't even realise they are learning and uptake knowledge easier, people especially kids do this, continued bunkum will keep younger viewers confused and having to over write the rubbish from sci-fi with science fact or proper cogent theory later in life, used in sci-fi it's is written in subliminally as much as consciously so science facts in sci-fi are better than imagined rubbish, it's simply not necessary to use fantasy science which is bunkum and serves no purpose only confuses people.

Enough dumbing down, use proper science in sci-fi to the benefit of the future, not detriment to evolution through 'Jackanory' science.

Visionaries such as Gene Roddenberry, Trek TNG etc, knew what they were doing by incorporating proper science into his fiction, all sc-fi writers/producers should do same, imho they have a perfect responsibility to do exactly that.

Peace. : )

,Xcel432,2009-12-02T16:45Z,"WoW Deltapan, all that from EP2?...LoL..

Was I the only one that saw the rabbit jolt infront of the car in EP1 just before they made it to where the train blew-up?
If you had seen it you would have noticed the camera speed was a bbit on the ""high"" side..LoL
Gee I wonder why?..

Anyway, although I enjoyed reading your comment and aggree mostly witth it, it takes a bit more than the SL, it takes a good crew and actors to sell the SL..

This show has both, im sure they kicked themselves in the ass when they saw the rabbbit, LoL...

I cant wait for next weeks EP!"
,ergabo,2009-12-03T00:09Z,THX !
,excalibur2099,2009-12-03T08:13Z,"""proper"" science can ruin a good show in big doses. Yes, star trek was a brilliant science fiction show but fuck me it didn t half get up its own arse by the end there was too much technojargon and it bored the crap out of me because it seemed like they were too busy trying to get the science right than concentrating on what makes a good story "
,CyberGRIM,2009-12-04T08:12Z,"Browsing eztv torrents, seeing a brand new episode with an intriguing title + many seeders made me decided to jump in. Now i'm opting out! (after watching E1)

@Deltapan
Could've warn me earlier mate. ;)"
,stikskip,2009-12-04T16:39Z,Many thanks! :)
