Who says a woman can't be a blacksmith? Well, pretty much everyone, except your grandfather. He's a master smith, and is willing to take you on as an apprentice in King's Smith.
Travel around the kingdom, visit different villages and meet new challenges as you learn the art of blacksmith as you take old armor and weapons and make them new again so you can sell them for a nice profit. Make a name for yourself, and you may just find yourself working as the King's Smith!
