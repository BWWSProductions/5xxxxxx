,maffiakillen,2009-12-15T22:29Z,is it possible to remove the nehterland subtitles? and just lesson to the english audio... is it dubbed to english audio from russian speak/talk and stripped it and then put it the english audio to the dvd9? Well if it is so you are good guys....  I suppose that the english sound is from another original and not your own sound :)
,maffiakillen,2009-12-17T12:14Z,"Very Very good,, Thank you!  Very good Quality...

Everybody... If you want different language subtitles...  dowload this rare file...  then unrare it... then play with VLC....  click on videos/subtitles/Read file  and the choose that ****.srt file  and voila  you see it in your language.... Maxspeed dvdrip is syncronized with this torrent....
