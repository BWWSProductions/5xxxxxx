-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      I  have  decided  to  release  2  versions of the show so if you have
      trouble viewing one the other should work. You can also choose  which
      one you want to keep.
      
      For  those who  have trouble  playing the episodes with Quicktime try
      using another player such as KMPlayer which is free and uses it's own
      Built-in codecs and plays almost everything and loaded with features.
            
      There has been an update to the episode list, these are updated based
      off of current known info @ this date and may change or be updated as
      necessary. 

      These are NMT Compatible. These episodes should play with no problems
      on most Networked Media Tanks and other similar players.
      
      I  have  included  a  chapter  file for the MKV. It can be added  by
      remuxing  the  file  with  MKVmerge  and  selecting  it on the remux.
      The chapter file has 11 chapters every 2 minutes and is experimental.
      If you like  them  let me know  otherwise  next release they won't be
      included.
