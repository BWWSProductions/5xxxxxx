,Bilderbooger,2009-12-18T00:57Z,WTF is up will all the zip files that contain a rar each?
,PIRATE-555,2010-12-14T02:40Z,"YES, I agree.  The program is deeply buried within several layer of ZIP files... NO fun.

THIS IS ONE of the programs where you (almost) MUST read the help file and follow it boldly.  

Honestech Video Editor WILL install just fine and there are no nags or timeouts apparent at all.

It is well worth your efforts!
