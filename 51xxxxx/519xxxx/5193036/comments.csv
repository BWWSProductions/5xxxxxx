,eguatpatto,2012-05-31T11:14Z,"Thanks for uploading Golden Guitar. I originally bought the record on its release in Japan in 1967. I lost it in moving around the world and thanks to you I have got it back. By accident I found out the artist of the record is Claude Ciari. Check out his web site for more of his recordings. A Frenchman turned Japanese a very interesting profile can be got at his web site.
Search for Claude Ciari on the net. Hope you get this message as it has been a long time since you uploaded."
