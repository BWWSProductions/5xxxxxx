Golden Guitar is a classic album released by Royal Guitar Ensemble in 1967. The LP contains 12 magnificent tracks. My uncle had this record copied on audio cassette but had no names of tracks or artist. I desperately searched for these songs but got nothing. Coincidently I found it on some file sharing site and I'm hereby uploading it as it hasn't been uploaded on any torrent site so far [Believe me, I've tried to search torrents but had no positive results]. 
I don't have any info about the artist...it's not even on wikipedia. But to the best of my knowledge it's the only album released by the artist. If you are guitar instrumental lover, you must listen to this upload. I'll be seeding it forever. I request others to seed it also. Feel free to give your comments.
Happy sharing...............
