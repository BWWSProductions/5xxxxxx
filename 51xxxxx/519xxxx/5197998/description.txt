cuPrintf allows you to to add printf-equivalent cuPrintf calls to your
CUDA C code.


In addition to the readme and the license agreement, the cuPrintf zip file
package includes two files source files: cuPrintf.cuh and cuPrintf.cu.

Drop these files into your source directory or your include path and start
making calls to cuPrintf in your CUDA C code.

This sample code works on all CUDA-enabled GPUs.

This cuPrintf code works significantly better on GPUs with SM arch 1.1 and
later, so always build your code with Ñ‚ÐÐ¬-arch=sm_11Ñ‚ÐÐ­ or higher if possible.

This cuPrintf code should work with CUDA 2.3 or newer, and is supported on
all platforms on which the CUDA Toolkit is supported.
