Welcome to LiveAndroid, a LiveCD for Android running on x86 platforms.

Want to give Google Android a try, but don't feel like buying a T-Mobile G1/G2/G3? LiveAndroid lets you download a LiveCD disc image of the Google Android operating system. Just burn the image to a disc, stick it in a CD-ROM drive, and reboot your computer and you can check out Android without installing it or affecting any files on your PC.

You can also use the disc image in a virtualization application like VirtualBox, VMWare or Microsoft Virtual PC if you want to try the operating system without even rebooting your computer.
