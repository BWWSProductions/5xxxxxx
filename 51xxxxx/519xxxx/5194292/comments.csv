,drz_pc,2009-12-20T22:43Z,"Couple of questions:
1. Does the keygen work in Windows 7?
2. Is the key file supposed to be anywhere in particular?

When I first install AnyDVD, it says I have 21 days. When I run the keygen, it tells me it has expired.

Thanks for any help."

key file is normally a registry entry.........if it is a reg entry copy it to the registry

if it is  a key file.......copy it to the anydvd directory and open with anydvd reg tool "

Here is a step by step guide 
Anyone having an issue with..........anydvd ""trial expired"".........error 
1) Uninstalled the old version of anydvd 
2) Make sure your disconnected from the net
3) Install the new anydvd 
4) If it asks to reboot (do it )
5) When the computer restarts anydvd will load (you will get trial version) now close anydvd 
6) Add the key (which is usually a reg key)
7) Open anydvd and you should have a fully registered version 
8) If you get ""trial expired"" don't worry move on 
9) Do a search for anydvd.chk and delete it or rename it to anydvd.bak.......you will have to enable hidden files and folders the locations are as follows 

for xp the location is 
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk

for vista
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

for windows 7 the location is
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

,Copurnicus,2010-01-24T00:04Z,"I Think i can help everyone with this .chk file. I noticed a lot of people keep saying they either
A) don't have or find the anydvd.chk file 
B) don't know how to enable view all files including hidden

if you are B) and have windows 7 this is how to enable it:
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial151.html

Now, if you are A) and you can't find it this should do it. I noticed being a guy that rushes to get programs like this installed I dont' read the directions clear enough. If you notice what fredpc wrote for locating the file its in PROGRAM DATA. I know that the first million times i kept doing it like an idiot I would go C:Program Files/ and then into the anydvd folder but  you won't find it in there. 

First enable it so that you can see all hidden files and folders (using the link above if you don't know how) then go back to c: and there should be a folder called Program Data. from there go to the anydvd folder like you'd normally do and you SHOULD see the anydvd.chk. 

Now go ahead and rename it anydvd.bak and load anydvd again and it should work fine. 

Let me know if this helps"
