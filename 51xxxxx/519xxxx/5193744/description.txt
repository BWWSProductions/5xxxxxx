PlayStation-Ready Movie Trailers
December 3, 2009


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p (mostly). This week
is much better than previous in terms of surround sound and
insteresting movies. I'm especially looking forward to seeing "Nine",
much more than "Avatar". The bonus now is a short movie by
Federico Alvarez, who will have a chance to debut on big screens
like Neill Blomkamp did.
