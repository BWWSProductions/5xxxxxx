Teach Yourself Beginnerâ€™s Italian is the right course for you if you really want to learn Italian but are daunted by the prospect of complicated grammar, classes and coursebooks. This book starts right from the beginning and explains everything in simple English. There are hints throughout to make learning easy and you can learn at your own pace with plenty of practice of each new point.

It is a friendly introduction to the language which will help you to understand and speak Italian sufficiently well to function effectively in basic everyday situations. The course will also offer you an insight into Italian culture.
New language is introduced through short dialogues and texts which are also on the accompanying recording and there are plenty of exercises to practise each new point as it is introduced.

Two accompanying cassettes or CDs are available separately or in a pack with the book.

Vittoria Bowles, the author, has taught Italian for 27 years, including 18 years at the University of Brighton.
