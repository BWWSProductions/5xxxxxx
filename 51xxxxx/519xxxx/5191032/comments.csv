I used a packet sniffer and saw a couple connections to 74.54.245.130 (live.virtualdj.com)

After i blocked all outgoing connection to this ip on my firewall, I don't get a protection error any more.

(Now virtualdj.com is also blocked)

Thnks for the upload"

Also, thanks for the info Digitrasher, I was able to block it by editing my hosts file before even installing it."
