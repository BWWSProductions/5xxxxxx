This is one of the few software I felt compelled to register instead of pirating. It supports automatic download through clipboard monitoring, links can also be Drag&Dropped to the field next to the "Get it" button. So all you have to do is copy the link of the watch page to clipboard.

It's only 40 KB and is entirely written in assembly, so it's extremely fast. Perfect for all you heavy multi-taskers out there. There's no restriction on behalf of the program about how many files you can download simultaneously. You can choose to automatically download the version with the highest possible quality (HD,HQ,...) or to download all versions.

The Standard version shares the Pro version's functionality except for the fact that you can only download LQ FLV (H.263, 320 x 240, 4:3,16:9) and 3GP (HQ&LQ). It costs only $10 to register via PayPal so it's a bargain.
