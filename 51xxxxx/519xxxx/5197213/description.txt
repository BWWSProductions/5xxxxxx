The game features many new race-events, including stadium events. Along with the player, a mobile home car travels from one event to another, and serves as 'headquarters' for the player. It features a roster of contemporary off-road events, taking players to diverse and challenging real-world environments. The game takes place over four continents: Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The game includes five different event types: rally, rally cross, trailblazer, land rush and raid. This World Tour sees players competing in multi-car and solo races at new locations, from canyon racing and jungle trails to city stadium-based events, and also includes a new multiplayer mode.
