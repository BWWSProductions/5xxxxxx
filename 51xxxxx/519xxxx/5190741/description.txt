Only 36KB!!!

I made this keylogger because I was sick of my AV or SpyBot picking up on commercial keyloggers I was trying to use 
(it defeats the purpose if your AV deletes the keylogger periodically).


This keylogger is unrecognised by all virus scanners tested by VirusTotal.com
I aim to develop this to have all the features of a commercial keylogger.

Features:

 - Logs all keystrokes made on the computer as well as the title of the window
   the keystrokes are made in. Captures passwords and all other invisible text.

 - Absolutely tiny and resource friendly. Only ~ 30Kb. Has never used more 
   than 0.2% CPU while I have been using it.

 - Can record all text which is copied to the clipboard 
   (whenever Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X etc is pressed).

 - Has an invisibility mode as well as user interface. Can be hidden on
   startup. (Ctrl + Alt + F8 to restore visibility).

 - Undetectable to antivirus software (so far).

 - Can Pause and Resume when you don't want certain keystrokes recorded.

 - Will never attempt to connect to the internet. This keeps it invisible to 
   firewalls and means you can trust that it is never  sharing your logs with
   others (as some cracked versions of commercial keyloggers do).

 - No installation necessary.

 - Still in development so any recommendations/requests will be built into 
   the next release

Has been tested on Vista and XP and have not had any errors. If you like or dislike please leave a comment. I want to hear any recommendations you have. If there is enough interest I will add features such as uploading to an FTP site.
Please comment as it will let me know if I should continue or can this.

How to use:

      - Move Steel.exe to desired location.
      - Run Steel.exe.
      - Choose save location under Options (or Ctrl+S). Default is in a log folder
        in the same directory as Steel.exe.
      - Select whether you want the application to startup with windows and
        enable Hide on Startup if required.
      - Use Ctrl+Alt+F8 to reshow the keylogger.
      - Browse to log folder and open with notepad etc to view.
