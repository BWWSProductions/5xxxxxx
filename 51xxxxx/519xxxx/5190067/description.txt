My reason for buying this was simply to check out just what guitarist Bernie Marsden did next after his departure from Whitesnake.  This album was actually the second and final studio release from the four piece band but thereâ€™s enough here to tell he still had some prime blues-rock music within him although it does sound on occasions that the band were looking for a hit single too. The over-polished, smooth cover of Kim Carnesâ€™ ballad â€œMiss You Tonightâ€ is the most obvious hit-hunt.  Owing a fair bit to â€œDriveâ€ by The Cars its actually the only certainty Iâ€™d skip if this were on cd.

Positively though, there are four or five very decent blues-rockers on here, all of which you feel could have been candidates for inclusion on a Whitesnake album if Coverdale had decided to stick with the British flavoured sound rather than look for wider spread acceptance.  â€œThe Thingâ€ has the nice soft acoustic start before building into a Zeppelin tinged rocker and its side one companion â€œHelp Yourselfâ€ could also, with a bit of work on the chorus perhaps, have graced any early â€˜Snake album.  The final three offerings of side two are also in the classic blues-rock vein.  Bass guitarist/piano player Brian Badhams solo composition â€œWoman Like Youâ€ offers a couple of all too brief solo spots reminding of why Marsden is a respected if un-celebrated guitarist whilst the punchy â€œSchoolgirlâ€ and the excellent â€œLove Manâ€ reminiscent â€œS.O.S.â€ both improve on that, the final track at last offering space for Marsden to really stretch out a bit and shine.

A different direction is taken with the other tracks.  â€œWhere Did They Goâ€ has a more American flavoured AOR feel due in a large way to guest saxophonist Billy Paul taking the lead solo.  More surprisingly, although perhaps not given the mid-eighties release, a couple of tracks have more in common with the pomp rockers Magnum.  â€œRun With The Packâ€ isnâ€™t a Bad Company cover but is more like a Bryan Adams number with hints of â€œBack Street Kidâ€, whilst the synthesiser and big chorus opener â€œI Really Want To Knowâ€ is pure Clarkin/Catley country.

In vinyl format especially you canâ€™t help but notice the cover art.  Credited to one â€œGary Marsh at Clock This Ltdâ€ he must have given many seconds to considering the band name and thinking â€œIâ€™m seeing a snow covered scene hereâ€.  Fortunately the music is better.
