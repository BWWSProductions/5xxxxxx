,elmojr,2009-12-05T06:05Z,"Thanks very much, media2007, for this terrific upload! It's great to be able to watch wonderful old classics in color, just for variety's sake.

No harm is being done when classics are colorized. The original B&W's are still available - as great as ever - and the viewing option is nice to have.

BTW, if anyone has the colorized version of ""The Bishop's Wife"" with Cary Grant, please post it. Thanks."

,cdgaucho,2009-12-26T16:51Z,excellent picture quality (even though it is colourised!) but no audio! Any ideas?
[T],media2007,2009-12-26T22:09Z,No audio? Sound is in original AC3. You need AC3 codec. Use VLC player or install AC3 filter http://ac3filter.net/
