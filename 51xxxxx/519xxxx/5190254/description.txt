This year's much-anticipated Rook takes the band into realms
both richer and stranger. Though a similarly haunted, elegaic
mood - punctuated by flashes of dread and menace - pervades
the album, Rook is its own animal, at once more accessible
(the near-title track, "Rooks", anchored by Thor Harris'
thunderous kick drum, a booming organ, and a stately trumpet
line, could almost be mistaken for radio-friendly) and more
accomplished than its predecessor, with a depth and grandeur
that seem improbably packed into the album's tidy 35 minutes
