Release notes:

Brothers who start bands tend to fall out at some point (think Oasis), but Jared
and Shannon Leto seem to have found something to not only bring siblings
together, but a legion of fans.
Not wanting to use his Hollywood fame to help the band, Jared Leto has made it
clear that the band comes first.

30 Seconds to Mars have been winning awards left right and centre, including
winning Fuse's 'Best of 2007' award against Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance and
Avenged Sevenfold.

For their latest album, This is War, the band organised 'The Summit', a
gathering for fans as part of their recording process. Encouraging fans for
their input, the band included the almost thousand fans who turned up from
around the world to sing a chorus. Kanye West also collaborated on the track
'Hurricane'.

The new album brings the group back to the sound familiar to their self-titled
album, and will strike the right chords for fans of the band.


Enjoy!
