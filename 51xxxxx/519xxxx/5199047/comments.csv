[T],c4ll7,2009-12-07T19:55Z,"that would be the Orientation Video
where Addendum would be  considered 2"
,ma69,2009-12-09T16:17Z,spoke to some banks and it seems it not totally true
,superbigshow,2010-01-26T05:20Z,"The banks you spoke to are lying to you. Investigate for your self. Don't take their word for it and don't take ours, either! Check out the The Money Masters.

The lectures and the Orientation video are NOT classified as Zeitgeist 3, 4 and 5. Zeitgeist 3 is scheduled to be released in October 2010. If anything I would say that the Orientation video would be Zeitgeist 2.5 and these lectures are just supplemental to that."
,XenoSilvano,2011-09-06T03:43Z,"I think its a little misleading calling this Zeitgeist 4, the 4th movie is called Beyond the Pale, it is scheduled to be realised late 2012 or early 2013."
