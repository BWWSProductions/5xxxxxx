,Zenophobe,2010-06-19T01:36Z,"thank you so much!  I just finished the 1st film and it was marvelous..  when I found out that it was an adaptation from a trilogy of books, I was enthusiastically hoping for 2 more movies and I they have already been done!  It's like going to work thinking it's Thursday and 5 minutes before you leave you find out it's actually Friday and the weekend is upon you!"
,bychance,2010-11-12T04:00Z,"Thank you outsidereunu, this movie works out perfect, I converted both files to Mpeg2
 and then burned them to DVD using Nero7 Vision. DVD plays back perfect including
subtitles. "
