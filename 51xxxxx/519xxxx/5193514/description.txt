Eva Gregory (Thora Birch) is an 9 year old girl who longs for a pet she can call her own. However, her mother, Amy, (Mimi Rogers) doesn't think she's responsible enough, and her stepfather (Christopher McDonald) is allergic to fur. So when Eva harbors a monkey named Dodger who's run away from his abusive pickpocket master (Harvey Keitel), she tries to keep her new friend a secret. It becomes exceedingly difficult, especially when the well-trained Dodger starts stealing everything in sight.
