Roddy Frame
Surf
2002

In 1983, Roddy Frame's band Aztec Camera released "High Land, Hard Rain," their first LP on Rough Trade records. It featured the hit single "Oblivious", and Aztec Camera were recognized as one of the key acts on the Rough Trade.
In 2002 Roddy released his second solo album Surf, an album of acoustic songs that attracted widespread critical acclaim, and was generally seen as a return to Frame's best songwriting form. The track "Small World" was used as the theme music to the BBC TV comedy series, Early Doors.
