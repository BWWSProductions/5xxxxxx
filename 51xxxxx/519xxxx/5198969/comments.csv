,_mclovin_,2011-02-20T05:04Z,"I downloaded episode 1, the audio is Japanese and the subs are embedded (you can't get rid of them)."
,Zeroslash,2011-05-25T23:33Z,"The English is all over and horribly done compared to this. Thanks for the up. I knew they released the original TV show dub in JP for the first time not too long ago but I could not find it for purchase, streamed or for dl anywhere. Nice to have a professional job that is not mindnumblingly wooden. "
