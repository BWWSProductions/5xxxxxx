Review
Garrick Hagon's delivery      this classic by Mark Twain captures        listener early      with his portrayal of        excitable Aunt Polly. He adjusts his tones smoothly from        role of        narrator of        story      performing        characters' dialogue in     robust manner. Hagon shows all sides      Tom        clever way he gets other boys      do his chores, his nervousness when he attempts      woo Becky Thatcher,        his bravery when he takes charge      a lost youth in     dangerous cave. Although commonly regarded as     children's story, this classic has       mes      race relations        social commentary that will stand out       mature listeners. --Maine Portland, AudioFile
