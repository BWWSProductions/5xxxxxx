When we were in the studio making the Life Time album, we recorded the cover songs we played on the tour that has just ended. Taking advantage of the relatively new medium of CD, I stuck on a bunch of live stuff from the tour along with the studio tracks and put it out as a CD EP for really cheap. I figured it would do the band a good turn by letting people hear how we sounded live, which was what we were really all about. Thanks for listening. ∩┐╜Henry Rollins (2007 Los Angeles, CA
