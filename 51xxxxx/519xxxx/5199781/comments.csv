,Zemog,2009-12-15T23:58Z,Place the keyfile.reg next to the plugin and double click it.
,Bumbaz,2009-12-23T19:05Z,"First of all, thanks for the torrent.

Could you help me installing this? It says I can't open the plugin (unsupported file type or extension). I have no ""keyfile.reg"" as you say, what am I doing wrong?"
,6ef4et0,2010-01-25T22:46Z,There is new Copilot product on their website!
,j.editor,2010-02-08T03:24Z,"Okay, I placed the Reg file in the plugins folder after pasting the twitch.aex file there and it says ""the specified file is not a registry script.""  I even tried importing it from within Regedit and it said it was an invalid file.  Can someone please give functioning instructions on how to get this to work please?"
,malombre,2010-02-14T18:27Z,"lol, there is no .reg file, only a .key file x/"
,Zemog,2010-03-01T14:51Z,My bad.
,Admet,2010-03-08T01:43Z,key file doesn't work. Is ther a way to make this torrent work?
,Ry_mann88,2010-05-06T02:00Z,"For those having problems with the .KEY file.

Simply open then ""Twitch Plugin"" folder and put the key file in the same folder as the plugin, if AE is open, close it and re-open. Test by placing the ""Bad Film Gate"" effect over some footage. Play until the effect runs, the words www.videocopilot.net should now be gone. Hope this helps. Judging from how cool these effects are, I'm totally buying this plugin. Thanks Zemog."
,sam_smooth,2010-06-22T00:25Z,all your torrents are looking good.. thanks a ton
,birthdayboi,2010-07-27T20:05Z,"Zemog, is the keyfile part of the original Twitch DVD, or did you make the key yourself. I'm just asking because I really like your uploads right now, because you've fixed the problems from your previous upload and left the files untampered unlike other uploaders who instead of just leaving the files like they way they were, they tend to add their own names, files, pictures etc. I still think you should compress your uploads and put the original untampered folder inside the RAR though."
,TheYe11ow,2010-08-30T06:38Z,"I'm seriously stuck and it's giving me a headache. I need help!

This is what I did:
1)Copy the Twitch Plug-in folder
2)Paste in the Support files/Plug-ins
3)Copy the KEY file(twitch_ae)
4)Paste in Twitch Plug-in folder
5)Double click Twitch.AEX
6)After Effects CS5 opens
7)Small pop up windows says ""After Effects error: Can't import file ""Twitch.zex"": unsupported filetype or extension. (0 :: 1)

Help anyone?"
,TheYe11ow,2010-08-30T22:07Z,"*NOTE* The plug-in is for older versions of Adobe After Effects. The plug-in will not work for AE CS5.
Download the Twitch 64-bit if you have CS5. Just enter any email: http://www.videocopilot.net/blog/2010/05/vc-plug-in-updates-for-ae-cs5-x64/

Download this torrent and use the key. Follow the instructions and problem fixed for CS5 users."
,Exz0sT,2011-01-01T11:35Z,"Everything is great except for one thing. when I click the file ""twitch_ae"", show me the error table, which reads: ""Can not import C:....twitch_ae.key: The Specified file is not a registry script. You Can only import binary registry files from Within the registry editor."" What's the problem?"
,SuperCanfiax,2011-01-01T15:53Z,Would this work with Premiere Pro CS5? If so - how? I haven't figured this out so far :-(.
,baseball1576,2011-03-01T00:36Z,Zemog wen i hit the Twitch_ae it doesnt work gives me some random error code about it not being a code

,aqw212,2011-06-30T08:55Z,First off many thx to the uploader. Second I don't see what the fuck the big problem is with everyone. NOTE TO ALL YOU NOOBS OUT THERE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST......THEN ASK QUESTIONS LATER IF YOU CAN'T GET IT WORKING. I downloaded this and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST it only took me a few minutes to install I even installed the presets and presto ur all done It all works perfect. Thirdly I must appogize to Zemog I downloaded Riot Gear from you and it was the lite Ver but I have a feeling someone fucked with the torrent file and gave you the credit so I'm sorry for being a bit of a dick. But as I said THIS IS TO ALL THE FUCK NUTS OUT THERE!!!!! READ THE INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED WITH THIS TORRENT OR ANY OTHER FOR THAT MATTER FIRST!!!!!!!!!!! BEFORE YOU CLOG UP THE COMMENTS SECTION ON TCB WITH ALL UR STUPID SHIT. The PPL like Zemog and others deserve positive feedback on their work and not crap EX PLEEEEEREAAAAAASSSSEEEE SEEEEDDD. If ur not happy with the speed & time it taked to DL then go out and buy it.. MANY THX Zemog
,Shadow_Korpse,2011-07-23T05:05Z,"When you download this you have to update it for it to be recognized in CS5 or CS5.5 just go to http://www.videocopilot.net/support/updates/ (also works for Optical flare, sure target, & VC reflect) NO email required, fallow all instructions just replace the plug-in itself with this update
__________________________________________
1. Download update.
2. open twitch zemog folder and move (Dont double-click) the ""Twitch_ae"" to ""Twitch plugin""
3. open C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CS5.5\Support Files (if you use CS5 delete the "".5"" in the path
4. Move or copy ""Twitch plugin"" in after effects ""Plug-in"" folder 
5. Move or copy ""AE Twitch Presets"" in ""Presets"" folder
6. If you want the audio move or copy from ""Twitch Sound FX"" into the ""Sounds"" folder

Hope this helped & props to zemog"

,ennanh,2011-09-23T20:54Z,"Torrent DOES work, but there are two plug in folders and you need to put the 
key file in the right one.

C:, program files (x86),adobe,adobe after 
effects support files, plus ins twitch, twitch plugin, twitch plug-in

Note the two last folders have a similar name. Make sure you take that last step."
,DooDFooD,2011-10-27T04:25Z,Great job mate. Had to use the old brain a bit to get the right things in the right places as well as getting Twitch compatible with my AE CS5 but it's all up and running and working perfectly. Thanks again mate !!!!!!
