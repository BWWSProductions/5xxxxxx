Storyline: Joel, the owner of an extract manufacturing plant, constantly finds himself 
in precarious situations that steadily worsen by the minute. First, his soon-to-be floor manager acquires a serious injury 
in a machine malfunctioning accident that subsequently endangers the wellbeing of his company. Second, his personal life 
doesn't fair much better when he takes the advice of his bartending friend Dean during a drug-induced brainstorming session 
on how to test his wife's faithfulness. Finally, compounding these catastrophes is new employee Cindy, who happens to be a 
scam artist intent on milking the company for all its worth. Now, Joel must attempt to piece his company and his marriage 
back together all while trying to figure out what he's really after in life.
