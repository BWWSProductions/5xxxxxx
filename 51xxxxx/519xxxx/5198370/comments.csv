,ptv83,2009-12-06T00:37Z,"had high hopes for this movie.. but ended up fast forwarding through alot of it... very boring.. all predictable.. and i mean very predictable.. 

seriously if you only watch 30second segments every 5 minutes through this movie you wont miss anything.

thankyou for the upload... just a warning to the downloaders that this movie is very dry"

,magneus,2009-12-08T05:46Z,Hey there I got a  question about the quality of the torrents brrips done by secret myth.. are they 1080p or 720p? because when i've tried transformers 2 theres his then theres a 720p torrent which is an 8gig d/l then theres Ethos's  rip which is 11gigs.  just confused on whats the difference between the 3 types.   thank you for your time

,d_archangel,2009-12-08T14:10Z,What have they done to TPB? I liked the old style with download tab on the right.
,yohoho1492,2009-12-09T18:23Z,"d_archangel,
I just figured this out myself. Immediately above the first file line you'll see two buttons,one marked double, and the other marked single. Hit single and you'll be returned to the to the one line entries with the down load buttons on the right.
 And again thanks again King for your great work,after having wasted my time downloading 'preacious' at bitsnoop.org from two different sources, i decided to wait for one of king's H264's.
Curiously enough, this morning someone calling themselves 'Kingdom Release' added another up of it there.It doesn't look like one of his and doesn't appear at TPB, ukb-kvcd, or the Kingdom site so I guess this is what he's been mentioning.     -yohoho1492 "
