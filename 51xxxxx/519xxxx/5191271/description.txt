NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Here we have a rip of ninja assassin cam dvdr we were given by a good m8 buttaflyy ....cheers bro.
Probably same source as the others but all others according to NFO's etc....have either used the small mpeg file or
xvids,which will lead to lower quality encodes.
The video itself  was pretty bad and i mean bad.....AR was shot to pieces,had thick black border across the top,was dark,colours
wrong   more.
Audio was ok nothing special .....your typical cam audio.
Fixed what we could without using the one click apps we always use ....apparently :lol:

On another note......YAO/Lynks/Memasmota,
Man we thought you was a friend bro....yet you want to stab us in the back,thats fine no damage done but at least we know your true colours
First you grassed on a cammer and was banned from hos because they could prove it and now you do this ,you are one sad person who is not
to be trusted in anyway ,shape or form....Bro your lower than shark shit.
Now i know why your staying low for a while.....
