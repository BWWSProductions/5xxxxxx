,Bombardem,2009-12-02T02:54Z,"Actually we've had several exceptional cams the last couple weeks, so this is a huge disappointment, and I do expect better. The 2012 cam was amazingly good. The New Moon cam was watchable and is looking better each generation. My niece about pissed herself when I gave her a copy at Thanksgiving dinner, and was thrilled with the quality. I'd rather wait a week, or a month to watch this on a decent TS."
,sc00ps,2009-12-02T12:47Z,Thanks for copy. Been looking forward to seeing this but to be honest looks like I will have to wait a bit longer. Really isnt enjoyable considering the quality and dark scenes. Thanks in any case.
,tenka73,2009-12-03T06:27Z,"Quite watchable. Thanks for the upload zingooo!!!

Rated as a CAM: A7 / V8

For those rating based on DVD rips, please remember what the word CAM means.

The first minute or two have a funny angle issue due to the theater projection, not the cam. Sound can be a bit tinny but is rather clear and quite audible. Some scenes can be a bit dark which should not be a surprise. 

Great work and thank you!!! :)"
,the_toasted,2009-12-04T00:29Z,"quality is okay. didn't expect much, didn't get much - satisfied"
,mumb4k1,2009-12-04T08:53Z,"this movie a f*ck up. i watched it in theater. no its not an asian john woo movie. its an stealth ninja vs heatseeking machine guns, shuriken vs .50 cal., katana vs kevlar vest. whoever create this film is a moron. 5/10 movie."
,mak69,2009-12-04T12:21Z,personal opinion off the movie isn't importand at all..some like it others dont..for a cam its still very reasenable A/7 V/9 thnx for uploading it zingooo

,covertmaniac,2009-12-05T02:30Z,"For a CAM, id give this:V- 6; A-5. Very watchable, bit hard to see during night time scenes and the audio a bit tinny, but at least its in sync. Overall worth d/loading....good film too.
Thanks....keep up the good work"

Good movie overall but its so dark you cant follow the action at all. Worth it but if you want to see the fight scenes then wait for a better copy."
,UnknownAlly,2010-01-19T12:06Z,"The same video file I always see.

The one where it's slanted in the beginning.
I started downloading the version 2 from IMAGE but after 15% it said 2 hours left, so I gave up.

Video - 7/10
Audio - 4.5/10"
