,nogard,2009-12-04T04:43Z,It is alive! And it works :P
,Cyphaze,2009-12-07T07:09Z,"FYI, the updates ARE cumulative. The only update you need to download from this is the latest (November) one. Just tested, I successfully installed and updated with just the main installer and November update.

Thanks for the awesome torrent. Keep updating this! =)"
,nogard,2009-12-08T04:09Z,"Are you sure about that? Some magazine numbers which were included in old updates may not be included in the latest, for instance.

Have you tested that?

Anyway, it doesn't hurt to install all updates. And you'll be 100% sure that you don't miss something."
,Cyphaze,2009-12-08T15:01Z,"I'm 100% sure that all you need is the latest update. Installing just the November update gave me all of the books that are out so far, as well as Dragon #364 to #379 and Dungeon #155 to #170, which are all of the Dragon and Dungeon issues released under 4e rules.

Notice how each successive update is slightly larger than the previous one? That's because when they want to release a new update, they just add whatever they need to onto the previous update and release it. If the updates weren't cumulative, they would be varying sizes, and they certainly would not be 45 megs apiece."
,Nightfallwarrior,2009-12-15T19:12Z,"Can you hold this up to date?
I've heard that Players Handbook 3 will be released March 2010 and then I must get an update for this ;-)

Sorry for my bad english"
,Excelis,2009-12-20T16:36Z,Any chance you can do the Dec'09 update?
,nogard,2009-12-21T16:20Z,"Still looking for it... As soon as I find it, I will add a new torrent with the char builder + dec'09 update."
,Kansatica,2009-12-22T20:55Z,"Is this the full version? When I try it, it says it's the demo version."
,tipulsar85,2009-12-23T16:33Z,"It's the full version, the update unlocks the rest of the content to 30th."
,modron789,2009-12-30T16:19Z,I got the december update from a subscription but I could not find the update file to upload. Anyone knows the name and folder?
,haven36,2010-02-02T00:49Z,Does anyone know where to get the January Update?
,i_bert,2010-05-22T04:13Z,Cumulative means that they all build on each other. What you are trying to say is that the updates are not dependent on each other or are noncumulative. I'm making no actual claim to whether that is true or not. 
,galactickid2,2010-12-30T16:07Z,"Doesn't work with Win7 x64, at least not for me."
,Shitpoop,2011-01-02T02:25Z,Works fine on Win 7 x64.
,florisschool,2011-01-26T19:32Z,"can u please provide some new updates, 
ty and it works great!"
,greenfourth,2011-05-03T11:21Z,@shitpoop With your comp you need to change the installation path to the ddi folder in the Program Files (x86) folder
,greenfourth,2011-05-03T11:22Z,"oops i meant @galactickid2

(and sorry for double post >.> )"
,fragilion,2011-05-31T11:09Z,"Stupid question, or at least it feels like it:

How do I 'install' the updates? I've extracted them into their own file folders, but attempting to run any sort of executable (the Character Builder itself, the Updater, the RealUpdater...) from within the update folders results in error messages and program termination. Only the main/original Character Builder application will run, and it doesn't have any of the updated content, and still only allows up to Level 3 chars. 

I feel I'm missing something blindingly obvious, so if anyone wants to point it out, go for it."
,lynsdey_black_11,2011-07-03T06:01Z,works great. Already made a new character. Any new updates would def be appreciated. 
,byronjr,2011-08-01T03:19Z,"to install the updates on an x64 windows machine, you have to tell it program files (x86)"
,FUBAR117,2011-11-23T09:06Z,"Extremely useful.  Thank you.  But, dnd is always getting updated, so any help getting the newer version of this would be extremely helpful.  Thanks"
,sabeku,2012-01-14T01:26Z,"Thanks for the great torrent. The reason I've researched on why you can't find any more updates to the builder is because after the November update (in the torrent) [or the December one other people mention], they moved the character builder and the updates online instead of an installation. To access the newer updates, you need to subscribe (and pay) to the site with an account."
,PADDYWHACKED,2012-03-28T02:57Z,well this is most likely a dumb question but im guessin i cant just click the update button when i run the character builder to update it to the latest update? and the latest update iv found here is the aug 2010 one is that the latest one available to us?
,watts098,2012-07-04T04:57Z,"After installing to program files (86) and installing the updates i get an error ""Cannot create instance of 'MainWindow' defined in assembly 'CharacterBuilder' Version=1.0.6.0 Culture=neutral. PublicKeyToken=null'. Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. Error in markup file 'MainWindow.xaml'."
