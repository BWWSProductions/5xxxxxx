,aschoonh,2009-12-04T15:08Z,Please guy's SEED.............
,packhater,2009-12-05T22:08Z,"OK can someone please specify ANY DUAL CORE PC??????
This is not true! It will only run with hardware that is compatible with Macs!!!!

Am I wrong??"
,ihacksnow,2009-12-05T22:25Z,"sorry for my english ;)
It work with 90% of all hardwares
I've include 20 of most used drivers and you can find more here : http://kexts.com/"
,ScreamingDeath,2009-12-07T02:43Z,Why bother with this shit when you can just use EMPIRE EFI and it will do the rest. No need for any other boot loader.
,BurritoMaker,2009-12-16T06:26Z,seem to be stuck at 85%
,Sdraer,2009-12-19T09:52Z,"Hi guys,

Trying to get (snow) leopard working on a Dell XPS 420  Q6600.

Please seed!  Like others I'm stuck at 85%

Original poster:  would you mind being a legend and seeding some more.  I will seed for a month at least once complete.

Thank you."

Bonjour iHacksnow
Don't be sorry for your English be sorry because of the mess and traffic jam you have created. As for days there are
hundreds stuck at 85.5% like me...great job uploader!!! Thanks for your info on the kexts as well but by the way things are going it looks like we won't ever be trying your distro anway. At least it works for you. Who do you work for anyway? Steve Jobs? This could well be a F A K E that's what I think as no one seems to have tried it yet except yourself according to the comments below.
au re fucking voir

ps:
the  commenter here about empire efi has the right idea and that's for sure this is a waste of time..."
,roadmac,2009-12-22T04:45Z,"No one will seed this, I have been uploading since 12/7.  People DON'T wast your time with this dumb fucker.  MOVE ON. "
[T],Redhat98,2009-12-22T18:01Z,"Yes sir you are right 100% this idiot does not know the basic principles of file sharing. He is a seed and runner!! I upload my own custom subbed and non custom subbed Asian movies here regularly and I feel responsible to all the people who download my stuff. I could never ever do something like this. I have even invested in a seedbox for all this and I have been trying to help out for this as well on there but I have now deleted the file up there so I will wait 24 more hours and delete this one as well. I suggest everyone else does that and blacklists this guy forever. ""I'll seed in 7 days"" oh no ""I'll seed in 3 days"". BS! 

as the French say:
Attentione!
as the Thais say:
Jet Mai.

bon fucking soir ihack snow wallah"
