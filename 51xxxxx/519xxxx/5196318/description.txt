From the CD blurb :  There is one group of [Haydn's] London works that is still virtually unknown: the six English psalm settings Haydn wrote in 1794 for Improved Psalmody, a collection of parish church music published shortly after by the Rev William Dechair Tattershall (1752-1829). This recording brings together the first recording of Haydn's English psalms with music by his circle of friends and admirers in England

An interesting CD, with a couple of gems.  The style lies somewhere between congregational hymns (albeit sung rather better!) and drawing-room music, accompanied by fortepiano or small instrumental ensemble.  And Haydn was clearly more accomplished than his friends ...
