I gus you will have to wait for someone who will be able to connect to both of us to make a 'bridge' between us. 

BTW, my own share ratio of this torrent is over 30 and I've uploaded over 25 GB of this one - and as you can see I am the only one seeding. There were times when this torrent had doublefigure amount of seeds. That's sad example of peoples attitude when it comes to sharing.

I will be seeding this torrent for a long time, so please be patient. Eventually someone will come and the connection will be made."
