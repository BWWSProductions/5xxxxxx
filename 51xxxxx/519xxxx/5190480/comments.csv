Let me know if its good or sucks!"
,stilljacktwenty,2009-12-06T18:04Z,This definitely don't suck. It's a great film. But I gotta ask: what's on the 2oth anniversary special edition that's different from the original?
,dclpirate,2009-12-07T05:06Z,I think there was bonus material on the DVD.  This is just the main feature :)
,stilljacktwenty,2009-12-07T22:35Z,Thanks. It's still a great upload.
