,Arist-ides,2009-12-08T22:09Z,The Erbarme dich has funny noises. This torrent sucks seriously. DonÂ´t waste your time with it.
,twistles,2009-12-09T00:40Z,Will check that at once.  Not noticed any problems myself.
,twistles,2009-12-09T00:53Z,"Ok you're correct.  Cd2 Track 10 seems to have been corrupted for a 10 second chunk - a series of clicks.  Thanks for pointing it out - nobody has bothered since I first uploaded this torrent over on mininova and then 1337x nearly a year ago.

I'm going to listen to the entire copy in this MP3 version, and then provide a torrent containing re-encoded tracks as necessary  (My FLAC copy of the same - and indeed my CD - do not have those clicks).

Apologies for the problems :)  But frankly, a few clicks in a 10-second chunk of a 3CD torrent != wasted time.

Will post aa ""patch"" asap ^^"
,twistles,2009-12-09T05:48Z,"I have just listened to the entire torrent, and I think I've found all the significant flaws.  2=10 is the only track with multiple loud clicks.  1=09, 1=16 and 3=09 have a single click, and 1=29 has a few very quiet static clicks towards the end.  I have re-encoded those five tracks, and they are available at :

Two further points.  1) The keys of the wind instruments make constant low-level clicks and taps throughout the recording (probably best demonstrated in 2=31) - they come from close recording, and are in no way off-putting especially if you recognise that they are 'supposed' to be there!  2) A limitation of the MP3 format is that track transitions are not seamless, and with this particular CD there are quite a few tracks that do not blend together quite as well as they ought (this is one reason why I use OGG/Vorbis for my more recent lossy uploads).  So blame Fraunhoffer for that, not me :)

Once patched, I think torrent quality will be fine for general listening pleasure, but for those who will not be satisfied I've just uploaded a (flawless) FLAC version at :
