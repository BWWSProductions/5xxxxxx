Lossless/FLAC
Includes: Log/Cue

This composer, pianist, and self-taught studio wizard makes big, bold electronic music using walls of synths, twinkling melodies, and amorphous bass rumbles. His previous two albums had him labeled by ambient patriarch Brian Eno as an electronic innovator, while an impressive sweep of artists such as Herbie Hancock, David Holmes, Coldplay, and lo-fi folkster King Creosote have called upon his handiwork as producer and composer. On this, his Domino debut, Hopkins showcases an intriguing musical aesthetic. "Insides" is about juxtaposition: natural, arcane textures welded to pulsing, hypnotic rhythms; beautiful acoustic melodies set against jarring bass. Reminiscent of the beautiful melodies and harsh dirty beats of Four Tet, Squarepusher, Burial, and Aphex Twin.
