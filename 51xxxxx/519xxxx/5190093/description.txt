Time To Die is the follow up to the mesmerizing Visiter back in 2007. The album will feature a new member in the band as well, upping the number of members to three, a one Keaton Snyder will be featured on the vibraphone.

"while indie rockâ€™s go-to guy, phil ek (built to spill, fleet foxes, the shins), hopped behind the boards this time, the dodos wildly-percussive style is still centered around two key elements: the punchy percussion of logan kroeber and the fahey-infused finger-picking of frontman meric long. oh sure, youâ€™ll hear a horn blast here and there, but its never enough to distract you from the groups riffs and rolls." - http://bolachasgratis.baywords.com/?p=7556

    ALBUM REVIEW FROM INDIE SHUFFLE
    http://www.indieshuffle.com/?p=459

    sounds like : fleet foxes, animal collective, the shins, against me (acoustic)

    the dodos are back! one of my favorite bands of 2008, these san francisco natives have dropped their third full-length album, and while it doesnâ€™t quite match up to 2008â€™s visiter, i have to say that iâ€™m not disappointed. their typical slow-build-up approach packs all the energy it used to, and itâ€™s certainly one of those albums that youâ€™ll be hard-pressed to avoid foot-tapping to.

    reading around, itâ€™s become apparent that the once-duo has now become a trio, with 21-year-old keaton snyder backing up on the vibraphone. iâ€™ll be honest: he hasnâ€™t changed the sound much. i have no doubt he makes for a more robust touring team, but with the exception of the song â€˜this is a businessâ€˜, the dodos seem to have maintained their sound. and while theyâ€™ve played a number of larger venues throughout the u.s. (particularly in s.f.), iâ€™m just not quite sure theyâ€™ve struck the right chord on this album to break out (oh, but they already have, you might say!). all that aside, iâ€™d still recommend you check out this album. theyâ€™re still a band that i enjoy to listen toâ€“though visiter takes the pie.
