,Salty2,2009-12-01T22:23Z,"Thanks to the poster for some new Custom Content. However, you may reconsider your packaging! Around here everything is suspect for bugs & viruses, especially .exe's

For those that may be concerned. This is a ""FreeArc Self-extracting Archive"" hence the executable extension. Passed Kaspersky (both before and after extraction) and extracted 84 .Sims3Pack files...Salty"
,Viper666.,2009-12-02T17:17Z,well .rar wouldn't have had the same compression ratio :)
,Arklite,2009-12-04T16:40Z,How/where do I install this?
,MitchBurns09,2009-12-06T11:47Z,"Nothing wrong excellent quality. Compression rocks. EXE is fine. Was a bit suss at 1st. If in doubt create a MS restore work every time.

Viper666 keep up the excellent work. Will be looking under you username for thing in future."
