I don't really know how to describe this movie. I remember seeing it as a kid in the 70's and loving it. I rediscovered it last year and realised my memory of it is more filled with nostalgia rather than reality : )

Basically these kids are on Christmas vacation and they're just running around through the snow covered town, chopping down their Christmas tree, and the girl picks up this big matchstick which makes her fly all over the place, which they learn was dropped by this martian, who is really just some bizarre dude dressed in a fishnet (literally), and he befriends the kids, and feeds them candy and flies them over the Sahara in his saucer, all the while playing hockey on his stomach, worrying the townspeople and attempting to fix his saucer, which was broken somehow and explains why he's there.

The bad dubbing (from french) just adds to the strangeness. It's almost as if this is a precursor of E.T., except this martian is just some creep dressed in a fishnet and isn't lovable in the slightest. 

Oh... I forgot about the soundtrack - it's weird too, 70's electronic bleeps and bloops at odd occasions.

I almost forgot... the martian's name is "Poo Flower". POO FLOWER!!
