Season 4, Episode 26: Everybody Loves Casey
Original Air Dateâ€”14 May 2002
Hyde is so sick of the other boys wining about girls he starts throwing things at them each time, and nicknames wimp Eric Daffy Duck. Kitty wins a year's supply hot dogs, so she gives a neighborhood barbecue, against Red's wishes. Eric thinks he can outshine Casey there and win Donna back, but the 'cool' ex soldier rather makes him look immature. Michael, who learned after consulting Cosmo Magazine together that Jackie won't apologize properly for her infidelity, tells Eric his big brother Casey is always bad news for girls, and finally realizes he has no reason to apologize to a bitch who always makes him feel bad, so he dumps Jackie.

Season 4, Episode 27: Love Wisconsin Style
Original Air Dateâ€”21 May 2002
Jackie finds a way to make up with Michael Kelso who dumped her: he may kiss another girl; alas the cheating bitch reserves choosing her 'rival'; when she finally leaves the choice to him, his is surprisingly romantic, and yet... Eric is delighted to catch Donna drunk as a skunk in bright daylight because of Casey; Bob is a walkover who lets her get away with everything, regardless of Joanne, but when it gets too gross Red steps in, and Casey seizes the opportunity to dump her, publicly. Just now she comes crawling back, Eric's pointless pride makes him refuse to be her 'second choice'; before he comes to his dumb ass senses (even Kitty uses the term) she decides to emigrate to California, where her ma lives. Afraid that Jackie might enforce her 'way out', marriage because she says so, Michael decides to drive Donna all the way; the long road proves tormentingly fishy, as Hyde had first dragged Fez along stealing dead fish and then decided to hide it in one of Kelso's van's wheel caps.
