[T],zerothdegree,2009-12-05T06:35Z,I have the album. and she apparently did some new stuff in the recent years. I've had a hard time getting copies.   This was released as a promo in 1997.  I always thought it was a great remix single.  Your very welcome.  I thought about posting the album some time in the future.
