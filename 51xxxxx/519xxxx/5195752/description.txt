Overview
Rude Mechanicals sees Pitch Black casting their net even wider than their previous outings Futureproof, Electronomicon and Ape to Angel.

Ranging from periods of atmospheric ambience to skankinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dub, through to stomping drum n bass, the album also features vocal contributions from KP, Brother J, and Lisa Z. Apparently, Pitch Black only work with people with at least one initial in their name!

KP, of Sunshine Sound System fame, lays down an ecologically-themed rhyme and uplifting chorus on the title track. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All the guys in the Sunshine Sound System have been our close friends for yearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ say Paddy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We toured around Europe with them in 2002, and shared many adventures, including the van breaking down in the middle of nowhere on the border between France and Germany.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“A night in the company of the Sunshine Sound System is a guarantee of a vibey, uplifting time - and KP brings that to this trackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Mike.

PaddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former bandmate from mid-90s electronica band Mesh, Brother J, contributes a typically enigmatic vocal on rootsy 4/4 stomper 1000 Mile Drift, while Auckland-based jazz vocalist Tracy ZÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethereal vocals float through the skittery beats and ambient wash of album closer Please Leave Quietly. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We thought this would be a good track to be played at the end of a Drum n Bass night, hence the titleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Mike. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Its a track thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both heavy and ambient at the same time. You could definitely drop it as the final let-go after a night of hard out Drum n Bass.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½
