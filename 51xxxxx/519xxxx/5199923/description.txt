Notes (Phish.net):
- During Ya Mar, a naked guy jumped onstage and ran around for a bit before being rounded up by security, prompting Trey to change the lyrics to "he was a naked pa."
- Sneakin' Sally contained a vocal jam.
- The sound for Mike's bass dropped out during Golgi causing him to sing the bass line.
- Antelope contained several lyric changes referencing the naked stage crasher.
