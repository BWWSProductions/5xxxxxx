A: 7
V: 8

It's near perfect the audio goes like 1/2 second out of sync for about 50 second, but other then that its near DVD"
,Solstice420,2009-12-03T13:39Z,"Excellent quality. Audio goes out of sync at the beginning for like less than a minute, and it gets a little (very little) shaky at the very end. Other than that no complaints. Thanks!

A: 9
V: 9"

,vitreous1,2009-12-15T22:41Z,Excellent quality and decent dl speed! I reccomend this xvid.
,XxPARISAxX,2009-12-31T03:45Z,The download itself took about an hour and a half. Very quick with Transmission! I had to download some other things on my mac like the EZ7Z and iSquint to watch it on iTunes instead of Divx. So basically I learned like 50 new things about my mac and how to watch different types of videos and formats on it today hahahahaha. Well worth it though! Amazing quality video. :)
