No trojan ...

Don't you all know by now that all patches are detected as trojans by antiviruses ...

But , just to clarify this ...that it's not a trojan: scan the patch with 3 of the world's best antiviruses : for example: Kaspersky, BitDefender and Avira.
And you'll see that all 3 will say that the patch contains a different trojan.
That's only because the patch's source code is similar to a trojan's source code.

But then again, if you are noobs ...and don't know theese things, then don't download patched programs, and buy them from the stores or official sites."
