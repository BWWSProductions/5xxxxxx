,EzekielAngel,2010-02-27T10:19Z,"Hey Dude I Just Wanted To Let You Know The Protection On The Files Was Easy To Get Through And From This I Have Created A Even Better Version (Which I Will Soon Upload).. I Would Reccomend You Put A Password On Your ISO's Or Something, But That Would Actually Make It Easier To Get Into. Anyways Nice Upload. Very Fast, I Got Like 2MB's A Sec On This One And About 1 And A 1/2 On The Eternity One. Oh And Srry About The Caps, It's A Bad Habit. Oh And By The Way People If You Dont Have A Dvd Just Lying Around You Can Use This Program WinToFlash (http://wintoflash.com) To Put This On A Usb/Flash Drive. But Unless You Also Know How To Extract Without Corrupting The Files... Yeah, Ur On Ur Own.
Im Very Thankful For This Torrent Art333, Keep Up The Semi Good Work, Boost You File Security And Be A Good Boy. 





P.S :Im Reporting This Torrent To M.S, And Im Also Going To Corrupt Seed The Shit Outta This!! Lol, Srry Guys."
