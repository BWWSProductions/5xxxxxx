What is this software?
A- it replaces your windows shell with just a tiny taskbar
= No desktop icons
= iconless start-up menu
= only maximum 15MB used (unliked the bloated explorer.exe which uses tonnes of Memory and takes minutes to respond every time you click to open something.) 
= very usefull if you're low on RAM / want to play some game smoothly!

How to use it?
A- install the software
-restart your system !

Tip:-
use totalcommander or xyplorer as file explorer instead of default windows explorer to further tweak your system !

Tip:-
more fonts you've - more boot time your system takes
= delete all fonts except Arial Unicode MS / Arial / verdena / MS Sans sherif / Times new roman / 
=thus your PC / laptop will boot up in 20% less time than before (because everytime windows loads, it indexes all the fonts hence takes more time with more fonts)
