,baretoof,2009-12-03T01:50Z,thanks a bunch for this great torrent!
,Dutchbay,2009-12-03T05:53Z,"Yeah, thanks."
,caliwillbemine,2009-12-04T19:59Z,"how can it be 1080p if its 4000 vertical lines ?
o_0

unless you have a new iMac 27"" or bigger res, this beyond fullHD torrent is useless."
,Gorilman34,2009-12-07T03:12Z,"caliwillbemine: It was shot with the Red camera, which can shoot beyond HD, making the picture in 1080p as crystal clear as possible. The torrent isn't ""useless""

Any HD ready PC/Television can play this. It's not like the HD Moods company would shoot a video only a few people can watch..."
,Detikkeviderevilde,2009-12-08T18:33Z,"Hey fellas...

I was wondering. How do i play these scenes ? Either vlc player or Windows MP supports it. Please give me a HOW TO guide.


cool torrent !"
,MoonDookie,2009-12-09T03:57Z,"@caliwillbemine: 
it looks very useful on my 42"" phillips lcd tv which i use for my main computer display, so i am not to sure what you are spouting about..LOL"
,Detikkeviderevilde,2009-12-11T14:55Z,guuys please tell me how i run this movie :( 
,caliwillbemine,2009-12-12T21:52Z,"Well i am just complaining about the wrong title, this is not 1080p, but 4000p.

I'm not sure if a lot of graphic card can handle such a resolution.

& Gorilman34: WRONG! crystal clear quality has nothing to do with resolution, if you watch a 1080p movie on a 720p tv it wouldn't make it look better, it would actually create for aliasing, give it a try.

Anyway, good torrent"
,distorted_78,2009-12-16T12:40Z,"rocking_cat: You got all these people that want your torrent, and are asking how to use it. You uploaded a supposed great torrent thats all jacked off in these crazy files and you're no comment to be found for instructions. Whats up?  "
,distorted_78,2009-12-16T12:41Z,Can Somebody Give some assistance since rocking_cat doesn't want to?
,noname1970,2009-12-16T18:49Z,dont work...
,h0tzen,2009-12-22T18:30Z,"VLC crashes when directly playing the m2ts files.
Windows Media Player with shark007Â´s Win7-Codecs (FFDshow etc.) doesn't play as well.
Any Idea how to get this working?"
,h0tzen,2009-12-22T18:42Z,"The Awesome Splash-Player plays the m2ts-Files fine. Although there is no SPDIF/Multichannel Support yet

http://mirillis.com/splash.html"
,ROSSINL,2009-12-23T02:48Z,"Media Player Classic Home Cinema plays these files just fine. Just open the 3 large files inside BDMV>STREAM with this program.

I wonder though if there is a program to merge the videos into one large mkv video or something, because now you have to manually click the next video."
,ROSSINL,2009-12-23T03:02Z,PS: Dolby Digital 5.1 of this movie is also working with MPC-HC via SPDIF.
,dudew8,2009-12-24T02:34Z,motherfucking gayfish gayfish gayfish!
,pakicraze,2009-12-25T23:22Z,can anyone else confirm if this works on ps3 or not?  i thought the  ps3 always played m2ts files... why doesnt this work?
,mdm90210,2009-12-26T00:59Z,Can some kind person please tell me how to play these files. Im trying to stream the files  mts to my ps3 using ps3media server. I also cant play them with the vlc media player ( but dont really care about that cus i want to watch it on my 52 inch samsung) what is the deal with all these files folder and subfolder. was this file desinend to be burnt to a blank bluray disc. can i convert the mts to something that ps3 will play?
,h1p1n3,2009-12-28T13:41Z,"First off, it took me 4 days to download. I am not complaining, I am just stating how long it took for me. (even sharing at 75k up, it was only uploading about 30k, downloading from .5k-30k, and yes I have my settings right) Did not play in VLC, however give ROSSINL props, it worked flawless with MEdia Player Classic Home Cinema. However as for content I would say it is utter poop. The scene never changes, its just a multithousand dollar camera sat in front of a saltwater (albeit a beautiful one) fishtank. For that I can just sit and watch mine. I was expecting at least some scene  changes, focus on different parts of the tank.. something! If your looking for something that is high res to play in the background, get planet earth and stream ""shallow seas"" I Mute it and turn off subtitles and have it running during parties, and always get compliments. Save your time and HD space, this is utter crap, caused by piss-poor directing, Mr. Greg James."
,schmolch,2010-01-02T01:57Z,"Thank you, great up and great seeding, got the whole thing in just 3h.

And to all the idiots here who are too dumb to read or think:
Its 1920x1080 and plays fine out of the box. If you dont know how to use your computer bring it back to the store.
Sorry for being an asshole but your whining and complaining deserves no compassion.

Anyways, a very relaxing video. instead of hunting for the next piece of entertainment you can just leave this running as your Desktop-Background and be comfortable.

Thank you again!"
,RexBones,2010-01-04T18:12Z,"How the heck do I use this file? I've never seen this file type before. I'd like to get it on my TV somehow. I've got blu ray and Apple TV, but just can't figure out what to do with these crazy files!"
,PsYkOtikz,2010-01-04T21:57Z,"thank you so much for this rocking_cat.  it makes writing or doing school work very relaxing.  the girls i have over love it too!!

any chance of getting some of the other HD MOODS series?"
,cungbuon,2010-01-07T06:18Z,"Question: File format not supported in PS3 ... I am trying to upgrade firmware. Firmware update completed... HD files not supported + corrupted. Any other ways?

Rgds..."
,kinvore,2010-01-18T09:09Z,"This worked fine for me using BS Player.  Don't let the name fool you, it's a good player. :P"
,renode,2010-01-22T15:16Z,"@ h1p1n3 - 

I don't know what the hell you're talking about. There's 3 different scenes, and each one of them eventually focuses to different parts of the tank."
,papifolks,2010-03-25T19:24Z,"PLZ upload more episodes of this.  It truly takes advantage of my new HD Decoder in my Acer.  I am lovin it.  Hope to see the beach episode, or the fireplace episode.  More plz."
