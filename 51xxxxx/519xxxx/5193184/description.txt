HD Moods Aquarium in ultra-sharp 1080p is a spectacular display of cinema-quality high definition on your HDTV, taking the high-definition image to levels never before available in a consumer product. Standard high-definition video cameras typically shoot at about 2,000 lines of resolution, but HD Moods Aquarium was shot with a Red Digital Camera at a remarkable 4,000 lines of resolution, going beyond standard HD and giving you a true cinema-quality picture on the small screen. When combined with 5.1 surround sound, three spa-inspired music tracks, and 24p image processing, HD Moods Aquarium becomes so lifelike it will take your breath away.
