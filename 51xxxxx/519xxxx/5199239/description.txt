The stability of the twenty-first century is shaken by a ruthless, nineteenth-century genius, and one hero, driven by a commitment to his mission, must risk everything to prevent a madman from changing the course of human destiny. 

Anxiety permeates the streets of New Orleans as rumors surface about a cloaked figure roaming the French Quarter at night. Some people think the character is a voodoo manifestation of Baron Samedi, others believe he is the Angel of Doom, and still others believe he is nothing more than an urban myth. Shrouded in mystery and smoke, he is The Victorian.

Created by Trainor Houghton, the series included a number of notable script writers and illustrators, including Len Wein, Glen Orbik and Howard Chaykin.
