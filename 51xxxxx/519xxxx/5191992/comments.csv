As always fantastic enocode and I like that you are 'signing' your work now.
I also notice that they (TPB modeerators) haven't moved this to another category. Hope they have learnt their lesson.

@CW:
Your ""same time, same place"" crossed my mind at least dozen times any single day, when I have struggled with some ""issues"" here and there.
Glad to see you here, for sure.

@Traysee:
I do not change anything, if input is dark, output is dark too. What I do is re-encode, as stated in first comment. BUT, I have the same issue with XviDs and Matroskas every now and then - I simply adjust the settings way I like or need - it is called ""Overlay Adjustment"", it IS part of every graphic card controls and most of the codecs/players/playback systems. Brightness is not the same for everything, and you must learn how to adjust it according to specific task."
