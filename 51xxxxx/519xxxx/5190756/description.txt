Changes from 1.5.10

    1) Player
        1.	Better support for EXIF rotation information in Jpeg files
        2.	Change back to old icon size (200*200) for normal and Album Jacket 
            mode 
            (We referred to the 1.5.10 feedback, which all preferred 200x200 
            size rather than new 120x120 size. Video folder icon size will 
            remain as previous version 1.5.10 which is 138x186)

        3.	The play button is the default button on the synopsis page. 
            (remote controller focus will be on PLAY button not BACK button)
        4.	Now, the icon mode change with FUNCTION key on the remote works on 
            text mode folders. (It worked only when all the three mode was text
            mode in 1.5.10)
        5.	More Video cover folders are added
            If a name of folder, which on the root folder, is starts with one
            of below words(case insensitive), it will shows Video cover art mode
            instead a normal icon mode.
            -"video", "movie", "dvd", "bluray", "blu-ray", "film",
             "cinema", animation", "drama", "miniseries", "tv series",
              "music video"
        6.	Rearrange the file list page for some severe over scan displays. 
            Depends on the display, there could be still be some hiding at the 
            edges.

+ 1.5.10 Release note

Changes from 1.4.26

    1) Player
        1. Subtitle loading speed has been improved.
        2. Audio playlist now supports up to 8192 files.
        3. Navigation UI Enhanced. (Not supported on UPnP)
            A. The disc navigation removed from the top of the list UI. To 
               navigate to USB, Network, UPnP, a user need to press GOTO key 
               while you browse, then the navigation popup will be shown.
 
            B. Users can select TEXT or more graphical interface mode for each 
               of Video, Audio and Photo on the Setup-Misc.
               For Audio and Photo folders, album art and thumbnail mode will 
               behave similar to the Icon mode and the Thumbnail mode of our 
               old firmware, But for video, Cover art mode behaves differently 
               from older firmware. Other then video folders behave differently. 
 
               For Audio,
                   1. Any folders named 'Audio', 'Automp3' and 'Music' (case 
                      insensitive) under the root folder will be shown as an 
                      icon mode (9 columns x 4 rows) with the icon size 
                      120*120(pixels) so if the folder.jpg(Folder.jpg, 
                      folder.png) size is 120*120, the icon will be shown 
                      without scale. (Coincidently, Windows Media Player save 
                      the covers as Folder.jpg)
 
                   2. The folder which has no subfolder will be shown as list 
                      mode, so users can see file names easily. (Background 
                      image is the tvix.jpg on the folder, background image may
                      differ in actual firmware, please replace with your 
                      choice of preference)
                  
                   3. Now, jpg files which start with 'albumart' 
                      ('albumartxxxx~xxx.jpg) will not be shown on the list. 
                      However, these will be shown as an icon when you press 
                      INFO button while you play music. If you have many 
                      albumartxxx~xxxx.jpg files in your folder, these files 
                      will be shown sequentially in time.

                For Photo,
                   1. Any folders named 'Photo' or 'Picture' on the root folder
                      will be shown as Thumbnail UI (9 columns x 4 rows).
 
                For Video, 
                   1. Any folders named 'Video', 'dtv_rec', 'DVD' and 'Bluray'
                      under the root folder will be shown as a Cover art mode 
                      (8 columns x 3 rows). The size of the icon is 138x186 
                      pixels.
 
                   2. When user enters to a folder, (this folder should be 
                      located under folder named 'Video', 'Dtv_rec', 'Dvd' or 
                      'Bluray'), TVIX will show a default synopsis page and 
                      three buttons at the top of the screen which are Back, 
                      Preview and Play. This is no magic. TViX just shows 
                      tvix.jpg file in that folder as a background with three 
                      buttons(Back,Preview,Play) overlaid on it. So, users need
                      to prepare appropriate tvix.jpg files according the 
                      content in that folder. If there are sub folders then 
                      TViX will show folders and files as icons and will not 
                      display synopsis page. So, you need to delete any 
                      subfolders to see tvix.jpg as a synopsis.

                   3. If the folder has a file which name starts with 
                      'preview_', then the Preview button will be enabled and 
                      when a user select the Preview button, the file will be 
                      played. After playing it, a synopsis page will be shown.
 
                   4. When a user select the Play button, if there is only one
                      file, a file will be played. If there is more than one 
                      file, the file list will be shown so a user can select. 
                
                   5. While you watch video, you can see the synopsis by 
                      pressing the guide key on the remote.

                   So recommended folder structure for movies will be

                   Movie_A
                       movie_A.mkv (main movie file)
                       preview_movie_A.mkv (preview file) 
                       (You do not need to have preview_movie_A.mkv, it is 
                       optional)
                       folder.jpg (cover art file)
                       tvix.jpg (Synopsis file)


                   if your movie files are more than two.

                   Movie_B
                       movie_b1.mkv
                       movie_b2.mkv
                       preview_movie_b.mkv
                       folder.jpg
                       tvix.jpg
                       tvix2.jpg 
                       (the background image that appears with the movie file
                       list when you press "PLAY" button. if you do not have 
                       it, default dark background image will be displayed )


    2) DTV
        1.    Now color space option, which is on Video option, will be used.
        2.    Some UI bug has been fixed.
        3.    Fixed: In some case, TVIX reboot when DTV stops.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ 1.4.26 Release note

Changes from 1.4.15

    1) Player
        - Fixed: Cannot navigate by selecting [Up folder] after playing picture 
                   files.
        - Improved : Now use Folder.jpg as an icon on Icon browse mode, so if 
                   users get album covers using Windows Mediaplayer, these folder 
                   icons will be used as icons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ 1.4.25 Release note

Changes from 1.4.22

    1) Player
        - When used with some TVs, screen flickers and becomes black after a few
          seconds. This happens very irregualry, so it is hard to debug.
          We think it's SDK(Software Develpment Kit) bug from Sigmadesigns. So, 
          we did some work around. When this happen, please press "VIDEO" button 
          once and it will become nomal.(It is hard to check whether it solves 
          the problem because we only have one monitor (out of 100 TVs and 
          monitors ) that can reproduce the problem but it happens once in days.
          The SDK that the firmware 1.2.52 based upon does not have this problem 
          but we cannot go back to this SDK because it has other bugs including 
          not outputing HD audio output through optical or coax. 
        - Fixed: The audio file tag info is broken. Does not show APE and CUE 
                 tags.
        - Fixed: The Prev and Next key does not work as paging while music play.
        - Fixed: The audio album jacket is not shown on the info page when 
                 an audio file is selected from icon mode
        - Improved: Now, shows the audio jacket files on the folder of currently
                 playing file in the Audio info page. 
    2) ETC
        - Fixed: Cannot copy large size files over SAMBA.
        - Fixed: System reboot when user try to remount local HDD after copy 
                 files through FTP.

                 with chapters info is being played.
        - Fixed: When the bookmark key is pressed while a MKV file with chapters 
                 info, the chapter titles are not shown on the chapter selection 
                 popup.
        - Fixed: The 'Â¬Ñ' is not shown for the Cyrillic subtitle.
        - Fixed: The setup menu shows strange characters when OSD Language is 
                 Vietnamese.

    2) DTV

    * Known issues for Video related
        - When HD Audio pass-through is on with HD audio stream, S/PDIF does 
          not work
        - When HD Audio pass-through is off with HD audio stream, playback may 
          not be smooth
        - When DTS audio setting is digital, HDMI audio is ON and HD audio 
          pass-through is set to ON, then audio is not heard on the SPDIF 
          output (For the same setting, if HDMI audio is set to OFF, then audio 
          is HEARD on the SPDIF output.)
        - Some WMV may not play correctly
        - Digital output for AAC/WMA is disabled
        - Does not support PCM audio track on MP4 now
        - Some MKV with AAC may not sound
    
    * Known issues for TS/TP Video related
        - The type of PGS language is not showed.
        - Some TS/TP may not sound.
        - It is a new TS/TP player written by us not using SDK code. It has 
          better features but the player has not been tested a lot.
        - It may have some files which do not work better than old TS/TP player.
     
    * Known issues for audio and pictures related
        - For MP3 files with low sampling frequency, the TVIX might crash while 
          playing or trick play like FF or RW.
       
    * Known issue for Network
        - BD ISO playback through Network.
            # It stutters most of the times. It is because mounting ISO as a
              drive overhead is too much for 6500 CPU. So, it looks like 
              hardware limitation. We are trying to optimize it but it may not 
              result to success.
            # We recommend to use IFO structure.
            # If you play files without refreshing the file list after delete 
              files through FTP or SAMBA server, the system will reboot.
            # 1G option may or may not work better than 10/100M mode depends on 
              the network environment
    
    * Known issues for PVR
        - After channel changed, you may not here audio in short time. This is 
          the bug from the chip manufacturer. To solve this, you can press DTV 
          key or Audio key on the remote.
    
    * Known issues for UPnP
        - Audio Playlist, Icon view and Thumbnail view are not supported
        - Some internet radio may not be supported
    
    *** If you play files with HD audio tracks like Dolby TrueHD, 
        Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA or LPCM, you'd better turn on HD Audio 
        pass through on the setup even though you don't have a receiver that 
        supports decoding of these formats. Otherwise, you will hear strange 
        noise with some repetitive popping noise. Currently, we don't support 
        core decoding, if you don't have a HD audio decoder receiver, you need 
        to select other then these HD audio tracks audio track for now.

              they want.
              Let's say a user set to English for the OSD language and set 
              Hebrew for the subtitle encoding. When this user tries to load 
              French subtitle, it will not shown correctly since it is saved

            # When using other NFS servers beyond netshare like NAS, Linux or 
              so on, better to use UTF8 in most of cases.
    2) DTV
        - The speed of  mode changes between video and DTV has been increased 
          a lot.

    * Known issues for Video related
        - When HD Audio pass-through is on with HD audio stream, S/PDIF does not
          work
        - When HD Audio pass-through is off with HD audio stream, playback may 
          not be smooth
        - When DTS audio setting is digital, HDMI audio is ON and HD audio 
          pass-through is set to ON, then audio is not heard on the SPDIF output
          (For the same setting, if HDMI audio is set to OFF, then audio is 
          HEARD on the SPDIF output.)
        - Some WMV may not play correctly
        - Digital output for AAC/WMA is disabled
        - Does not support PCM audio track on MP4 now
        - Some MKV with AAC may not sound
    
    * Known issues for TS/TP Video related
        - The type of PGS language is not showed.
        - Some TS/TP may not sound.
        - It is a new TS/TP player written by us not using SDK code. It has 
          better features but the player has not been tested a lot.
        - It may have some files which do not work better than old TS/TP player.
     
    * Known issues for audio and pictures related
        - For MP3 files with low sampling frequency, the TVIX might crash while 
          playing or trick play like FF or RW.
       
    * Known issue for Network
        - BD ISO playback through Network.
            # It stutters most of the times. It is because mounting ISO as a
              drive overhead is too much for 6500 CPU. So, it looks like 
              hardware limitation. We are trying to optimize it but it may not 
              result to success.
            # We recommend to use IFO structure.
            # If you play files without refreshing the file list after delete 
              files through FTP or SAMBA server, the system will reboot.
            # 1G option may or may not work better than 10/100M mode depends on 
              the network environment
    
    * Known issues for PVR
        - After channel changed, you may not here audio in short time. This is 
          the bug from the chip manufacturer. To solve this, you can press DTV 
          key or Audio key on the remote.
    
    * Known issues for UPnP
        - Audio Playlist, Icon view and Thumbnail view are not supported
        - Some internet radio may not be supported
    
    *** If you play files with HD audio tracks like Dolby TrueHD, 
        Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA or LPCM, you'd better turn on HD Audio 
        pass through on the setup even though you don't have a receiver that 
        supports decoding of these formats. Otherwise, you will hear strange 
        noise with some repetitive popping noise. Currently, we don't support 
        core decoding, if you don't have a HD audio decoder receiver, you need 
        to select other then these HD audio tracks audio track for now.
