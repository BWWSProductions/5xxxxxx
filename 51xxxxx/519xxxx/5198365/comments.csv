if this wasn't a .mov i would download it.

sorry, i just hate having to take the risk of an infection from this.
(not to say you're the one to do it, but it's very easy for someone else who's seeding to add it in.. happens all the time)

boycott .mov's on the open net and you'll save yourself the bombshell when it hits."

,ptv83,2009-12-06T09:10Z,theshift5.. i'm sure quicktime works fine on a mac.. but quicktime for windows is very poorly programmed bloatware.
