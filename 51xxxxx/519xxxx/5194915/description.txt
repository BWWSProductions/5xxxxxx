    InfoHandler 2008 is version 11 of InfoHandler, but it represents      
    also a new generation of this software, completely re-implemented     
    using current technology. The differences between InfoHandler 10      
    (see below) and InfoHandler 2008 in short:                            
    New Technology                                                        
    New programming language C# and .NET Framework 3.5 replaces C++       
    and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes).                               
    New Layout                                                            
    The new user interface is similar to the previous but enhanced in     
    many aspects.                                                         
    New Storage Format                                                    
    Instead of the previous binary storage InfoBases are now saved        
    using standard XML (Extended Markup Language) which makes them        
    readable by humans and other applications.                            
    New Help System                                                       
    Based on HTML Help instead on the old WinHelp engine                  
    New Features                                                          
    Categories of type Date.                                              
    Values of Number Categories can be negative and have up to 5          
    decimal places.                                                       
    Mapping of folder trees and files of the file system onto             
    Categories and Info items. (You might want to use this feature for    
    a versatile management of your IE Favorites but it can also be of     
    good use for all kinds of hierarchically structured documents.)       
    Mapping of MS Office Outlook folders and Mail items onto              
    Categories and Info items                                             
    Clipping web pages.                                                   
    New Column View for the InfoList.                                     
    Central management of all InfoBases and backup copies.                
    Another (third) filter for the InfoList based on found words in       
    title, text, or linked documents of the Info Items.                   
    Relative path names for linked documents.                             
    Sequence order of columns in the InfoList can be (permanently)        
    changed by simply dragging them to a new position.                    
    to mention only a few ...                                             
    Still missing features                                                
    Category Tree View of the InfoList (scheduled for 2009).              
    Multi-User functionality (under development).                         
    Spellchecking (scheduled for 2009).
