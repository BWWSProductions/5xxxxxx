For some weird reason my ""new"" (replacement) modem is only uploading at half the speed it's capable of.  

Meanwhile, my downloads are as fast as ever EXCEPT when I have an upload going at the same time.  I can't explain it and neither can my cable company."

[V],TheExecutive,2009-12-06T08:54Z,"I like your attitude and appreciate your willingness to seed so many torrents, Klaatube. :)  Although you shouldn't burden yourself with seeding too much, because by spreading yourself too thin it will make everyone's downloading very slow if you're the last man seeding. A day or two per torrent is fine, but I'll leave that up to you.

You won't have to wait that long though, because I've just upgraded to the next higher bandwidth package. So your downloading speeds should be twice as fast or more, depending on your connections."
