One day, something wonderful might happen: a rally, a march, a brilliant speech - something. And things will start to change. But I always knew that before that could happen there would need to be a change in the air to make it even possible. While going through the clips you hear towards the end of this video I got the strong impression that it's actually happening. It will still be a while before we get full acceptance, and the disgusting behaviour of SOME religious people becomes socially unacceptable, but I feel for the first time that I might just live to see it.

To all those who have got us THIS far, please, keep going, keep pushing. The immovable object is not where it was just a few years ago. I never imagined I would see atheists coming together in the real world, seeking each other out. I didn't think the hunger was there. It is. You're not alone. You never were.
