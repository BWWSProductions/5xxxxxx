Go live in a atheist/satanic nation and see how you like it."

Atheists are baby eatin' satanists!!! Watch out!

""Why don't you attack the Dark Religions first that Politicians and mega Rich are into?""
Like Christianity and Islam? Sure.

""Go live in a atheist/satanic nation and see how you like it.""
Scandinavian countries are like soooooo bad man :("

I don't worship or believe in Satan :)
""excuses to attack the positive side of religion""
All of those positives you attribute to religion, doesn't require religion.
""Why don't you attack the Dark Religions first that Politicians and mega Rich are into?""
Like Christianity and Islam? Sure, doing it most if not all the time. Christianity and Islam are dogmatic ideologies used to control the masses, how the imams and pope use scripture to hold power and silence dissent.

""Go live in a atheist/satanic nation and see how you like it.""
Again, we don't believe in Allah and Yahweh AND Satan. Go live in a aThorist nation, oh wait, you already do XD Atheist nations, nations that are predominantly populated with atheists?  Iceland, Norway? I'd love to move there, crime lates are REALLY low up there, they don't need gods or sharia lulz to behave."
