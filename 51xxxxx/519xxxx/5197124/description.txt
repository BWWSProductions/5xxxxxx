Ever wonder where and how we get our stuff, or what happens to it when we garbage it? The Story of Stuff is a wonderful, for all ages, 20 min movie about our stuff. Annie Leonard hosts this beautifully illustrated little movie. This is great for classroom watching.

This is free to watch, low quality, online at www.thestoryofstuff.com but if you want to watch it on a big screen this is for you.
