Quality: Video quality looks nice, however there is a bit of hissing of the audio in the beginning which couldnâ€™t be removed without loosing some of the sound.

Synopsis: Norma and Arthur Lewis, a suburban couple with a young child, receive a simple wooden box as a gift, which bears fatal and irrevocable consequences. A mysterious stranger, delivers the message that the box promises to bestow upon its owner $1 million with the press of a button.

The sound is a little hollow, but completly watchable
