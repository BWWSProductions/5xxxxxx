anyway thank's for the UL. loved the ubuntu appearance!"
,D1Racer,2009-12-04T12:12Z,"It says they are supposed to self install, but they don't.

You can find them if you browse the .iso and look in the $OEM$\$DOCS$ folder then manually install them.

Glad you like it :)"

,TPBUROCK,2009-12-06T16:36Z,"i have installled it on p4 with 1.25 GB RAM none see any mac or others effects..

THIS IS SIMPLE SP3"
,D1Racer,2009-12-06T23:48Z,"You have to go into the cd file and manually install the programs and skins as stated in a comment above, for some reason they are not self installing.

And it is a tweaked SP3 XP."
,ATLjoe,2009-12-07T04:14Z,why does it ask me for cd key during installation?
,D1Racer,2009-12-08T16:16Z,"As I stated, this is not my build, I just found it and thought I'd share.

However, in response to your comments, I don't get why you are having such problems. 

Yes the featured programs and skins have to be manually installed, I've already said that.

When I installed it I most definitly had a internet browser, and I did not have to input a cd key, as it is slipsteamed into the Windows.

As for no internet after you installed it, XP never automatically connected you to the net, you have to install your drivers and then set up your connection to the net. It's not like Vista and later that does it for you automatically.

In saying this, I ran this OS for a week on my other system with no problems."
