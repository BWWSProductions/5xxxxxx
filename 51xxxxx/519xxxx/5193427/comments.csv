,X45JKD,2009-12-23T18:48Z,"Thanks a bunch, johnny. You'll be sorely missed!

GoodFilms, thank you for all your hard work. Been a big fan of your work.

There are 3 of johnny's torrents that have been stuck for weeks. If you could seed those so that we can finish our downloads, then I'll keep seeding. 2 of them are stuck at 98% and 95% and one is stuck at 55.6%:

1. The.Three.Burials.Of.Melquiades.Estrada.2005.LiMiTED.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS 6.56 GB
Hash a52b992afef0a5b4d7e584bc0cde0f0c60e74477
Stuck at 98.42%, 33 peers

2. Eastern.Promises.2007.1080p.HDDVD.DTS.x264-DEFiNiTE 8.11 GB
Hash 4bf512ad396f080b9a8941f1b7241c154dce88cd
Stuck at 95.71%, 15 peers

3. Mystic.River.2003.720p.HDTV.x264-C100 4.37GB
Hash 97be0b6cc7a52eca43e84aaa2e553f890ae4c9ab
Stuck at 55.6%, 9 peers

If it's more convenient for you to start a new torrent for these movies, then that's fine too.

Thank you.

P.S.

Would you happen to have the following in 1080p? If you could upload these then it would be highly appreciated by many of us:

1. Three Burials of Melquiades 1080p (the stuck torrent above is 720p)

2. Mystic River 1080p (the stuck torrent above is 720p)

3. The Silence of the Lambs 1080p

4. Miami Vice 1080p (the only one available is by HDItaly in dual Ita, Eng AC3)

5. Spiderman Trilogy in 1080p (the only one in 1080p is here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4517101/Spiderman_Trilogy_Bluray_720p_x264-HDBiTs but this torrent is very slow and stuck at 77.7% note: despite the 720p in description of this torrent, it's actually 1080p)

Thanks again! You're the best! Happy Holidays."

@MrVicVega. Torrents with DHT disabled can no longer be uploaded here. Yes, many torrents can still be uploaded, but there are many fewer than there were before.

[V],-jonny-,2010-01-28T14:36Z,"I'm confused. You make a tit out of yourself, and then parade your idiocy around the forum and other users' torrents as if your opponent were the fool.

What's more, you say ""i couldnt stop seeding it,"" and that it ""couldnt be undone."" Let me teach you something. To stop seeding a torrent, you press ""stop"" (or ""remove"") in your torrent client. And on the site, you rename the torrent to something random, put it in a random category, and then hit the little red delete button. Difficult, huh?

Want help with anything else?"
,Closeye,2010-01-28T18:11Z,"Let me explain, i guess you are just too retarded to understand. The torrentfile had another hash then yours, i added  a txt file into it. So all the people who downloaded my torrentfile had to download it from me. Do you understand the principle of bittorrent and how it works? No? Well let me explain.

Bittorrent for dummy's
--------------------------
People has to download the torrentfiles/hashes that connect them to eachother. To create the ""swarm"". When the 2 hashes arent the same, they wound connect to other peers.(like in this case..). When the people download the torrentfile and put it into their clients, the client send an ACK (3 way handshake, see: tcp protocol) to the tracker, the tracker searches then for the hash into the trackerscrape and send the ipadresses back that belongs to the hash. The ip adresses are all called ""peers"". when the ip adresses are in the client, the client connects to them and devide them into the seeders/leechers boxes. Same thing as the dht/pex protocols, but they work on the broadcast way. But still with hashes. So if i would remove that out of my client and the people who are connected cant download it from me, they are screwed. Would cause a bad name for me etc etc. 
http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html

Please learn yourself more then bitching about some mistake and try next time to keep your buddy's away, lamer. And now get on with your life. I have respect for the stuff you uploaded, but you as a person is like a little child. Whining about something that couldnt be undone. 

Ps: Its the reason of your whining that you are still not a vip, they dont like you and your childish behavior and you will never become a vip neither.  Be sure about that.

greetings."
[V],-jonny-,2010-01-28T18:48Z,"You haven't successfully contradicted a thing I've said, fool. You've merely added weight to my argument.

You are such a fucking child, it's infuriating. I am not a vip because I crosslink, boy. I was told if I wanted to be vip I had to stop crosslinking. But as long as you have some kind of skull, it makes no difference whether you are ""vip"" or ""trusted."" So i decided I would rather continue crosslinking. It does the downloaders a favor, especially when pricks like you exist.

I have a long list of HD movies, which are all seeded, and will continue to be seeded. You can't say that about many uploaders. And the reason? Great content. The color of my skull is absolutely irrelevant.

You could never outwit me. Now fuck off back to school before I tell your mom you've not done your homework. Little bitch."
