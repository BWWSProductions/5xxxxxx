System Mechanic 9.5 and Windows 7

iolo's engineers are putting the final touches on the latest version of System 
Mechanic - System Mechanic 9.5 - which will be released in late November 2009. 
We wanted to give you a 'sneak peek' at what's in store and highlight just a 
few of the features designed specially for Microsoft's latest operating system, 
Windows 7.

Jump Lists 
One of the more popular features in Windows 7 is the Jump List function. 
With Jump Lists, you can 'jump' directly to the functions you use the most. 
More advanced than shortcuts, Jump Lists help you quickly get inside your favorite 
programs and run those features you run every day, like creating email messages. 

The commands available to you depend on how the software was designed. 
System Mechanic's Jump List will give you fast access to system analyses, repairs 
your PC needs, and our most popular optimization tools that users have told us 
they like to run daily


PC Health Status Gadget 
Designed for both Windows Vista and Windows 7 machines, System Mechanic's 
PC Health Status Gadget provides real-time status reports on your computer's 
health, with drill-down access to any detected problems and system warnings 
you should know about. 

You can also keep track of how your PC is being maintained through a running 
feed of the repairs and optimizations performed by System Mechanic. And finally, 
the gadget gives you a quick and easy way to access the most commonly used 
functions in System Mechanic, such as Memory MechanicÂ® and EnergyBooster.


Additional Tweaks for Windows 7 
The PC Cleanup PowerTool has been enhanced with additional junk file patterns, 
so System Mechanic will be able to detect and remove system clutter from 
Window 7-specific locations.

Behavior patterns and errors in Windows 7 will be detected and resolved with 
System Mechanic's updated registry cleaning and repair technology. This technology 
can be found in System Mechanic's Registry Tuner as well as the Total Registry 
Revitalizer, which repairs, compacts, defragments, and backs up the registry in 
one step.



System Requirements 

- 64/32-bit Windows 7, Vista, and XP
- Internet Explorer 6.0 or later
- 256 MB of RAM
- 120 MB of free hard drive space

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
