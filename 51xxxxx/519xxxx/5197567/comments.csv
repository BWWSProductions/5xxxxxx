,chuck24,2009-12-06T18:45Z,"Dear RH,
            I am using many of your softwares for which I am extremely grateful but I am really very concerned about this one. I downloaded this software and soon as I unzipped it, my anti-virus (ESET NOD32) put the activator into quarantine. What should I do?. I need this software.
Regards,
Chuck."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-12-06T23:19Z,"@chuck24

Read the av scan results at the torrent description or incl. Readme!.txt file.
If you don't exclude your download folder your av software will remove everything suspicious, incl. false positives."
,chuck24,2009-12-07T14:46Z,"Dear RH,
            Thanks for the upload. I disabled my anti-virus and then had it installed. It's working great and without any noticeable problem. Thanks once again. RH do you take requests?. I need couple of sofwares and I can't find their torrents.
Regards,
Chuck."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-12-08T11:55Z,"@chuck24 

Instead of disabling your anti-virus it's recommended to just exclude download folders from being protected and auto-scanned by your av software. In that case you can run keygens etc without disabling your complete av software, and if suspicious files are stored elsewhere your av software may warn about it.

Request are welcome, but it's better to ask at the forum so that more people can help:

I have one question though, what's the best way to update it ""safely""?  Meaning Iolo doesn't nail you and disable your software because it connects to the internet or something."

I shut down the internet, hit exit, then it says:
""You cannot install a trial version of System Mechanic Professional over the top of an older licensed version of System Mechanic Professional.""
Okay? Press ok, and a pretty error box pops up and says:
""Runtime error (at 683:1736): 
Could not call proc.""

Any ideas?"
