,HQAnime4Arab,2009-12-06T11:47Z,"works great ... had 6.1 BUT with this one updated to 6.5

may thnx dude! rep point added  :P"
,SDguy,2010-01-14T00:42Z,"Thanks for the up, but it only worked for a few days before, when previewing ,all the background turned red and a message stating that ""This page was created with an illegal version of WYSIWYG WebBuilder"" appears.

Any way around this that I've missed at all, please?"
,SDguy,2010-01-14T02:16Z,"Seems every uploaded version of this ends up with the ""This page was created with an illegal copy of WYSIWYG"" message, but whenever a downloader asks for help or advice, the responses dry up.

Are these just one week trials that are being uploaded to PB by the WYSIWYG teams themselves, by any chance?

If so, it would probably be better to just go and download the full 30 DAY trial from the WYSIWYG site.

Please don't shoot the messenger."
,SDguy,2010-01-21T09:52Z,"Hmmm. As I thought. Guess that that's that, then.

Thanks, anyway, for the upload. 

Just a darned shame I can't get one of these to work for more than a few days. :-( "
,Marius1987,2010-02-03T20:22Z,"About ""This page was created with an illegal copy of WYSIWYG"" . I found out by myself that this happens only if you go to Publish, so I experiment a little bit and tried export to HTML option and it works like charm. You just have to export each page manually and everything will be just fine.

Hope these helps, cheers."
,Renodil,2010-06-14T17:07Z,"Yea, well I got a new one for you. The serial key is invalid and I can't activate it without being connected to the internet, so there's no way to activate this product."

Have the same problem..."
,downloader979,2011-01-27T14:04Z,"Hey guys- I severely doubt that Pablo is behind these torrents- more likely, its just that Pablo really does not like pirating, and does everything in their power to prevent it. I have always had good luck just exporting as html- some users say they have to remove a meta name line from each file, but I have never had to do this."
