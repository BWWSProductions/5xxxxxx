     In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population,                                    
      nicknamed "The Prawns," appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa.         
       Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population        
      has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has                                                
     deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are                                                    
        confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation,                             
       Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population                                                           
      with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation,                                                         
     Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the 
     help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.
