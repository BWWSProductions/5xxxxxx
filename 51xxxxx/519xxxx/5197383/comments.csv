,loonatick,2009-12-05T05:22Z,Thanks for the up.  I see there are six files.  Is one for English subs just for the non-English dialogue?
,Mazer-blazer,2009-12-05T06:43Z,plz more ppl seed
,loonatick,2009-12-05T21:04Z,"Ok, so I'll answer my own question.  The files contain English subs for the entire movie and separate ones for just the non-English parts."
,LOLTOAST,2009-12-11T20:43Z,"d/ling now.

keep seeding folks. :-)"
,blah222,2009-12-23T04:40Z,I'm used to having the subs encoded into the movie file. How do you use the additional sub files?
[T],metalcore.,2009-12-23T15:48Z,"just rename srt same as avi file, and it will play automatically in vlc media player, or if you hit the subtitles button on your standalone dvd player remote..

but wtf man, two discs...GET WITH THE FUCKING TIMES TVTEAM YOU FUCKING RETARDS....no point splitting up the file anymore, unless maybe you are from fucking north korea and dont yet have access to a dvd burner

HURTIN!"
,moonbeamc1458,2009-12-24T19:16Z,metalcore- shut the fuck up and stop complaining! TvTeam was nice enough to upload this movie (which is great quality I might add) and you sit here and bitch about it being 2 files? I don't see you going out and buying the movie. Quit bitching and enjoy the free movie
[T],XeroxAlto,2009-12-26T06:12Z,"I appreciate the split files. Many times I watch on my standalone DVD player via USB. It has a hard time processing large files as do many DVD players which are reading off of a disc. 

You can always join them later if you are anal about it. I appreciate that it is split with the subs. So many people give out the movies without the subs. Seems silly to me. I always rip the subs when I upload. (If available.) 

Great quality. Thanks!"
