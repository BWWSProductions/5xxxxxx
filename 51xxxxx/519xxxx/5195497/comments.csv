,MrMightythefox,2009-12-04T13:39Z,"great show - great quality

10/10 on v and a

btw- THANKS TPB for keepin' on!

Too bad about mininova.  THANK GOD I have another private tracker, better than demonoid to turn to.  It basically replaced mininova and demonoid.  No invites left for demonoid (it's been down so long anyways,) but this new tracker is freakin' sweet!  If you seed on it, you get access to some really hard to find stuff.  I got invite powers, but i'd have to be SURE you were a power seeder.  I wouldn't loose my account over some bs.  

Anyways, thanks again TPB- you are the only REAL public ""tracker"" left (even though you use magnets now, which is keepin' with the time) ... it IS nice to know, however, that there are other trackers out there (private ones) that you can download stuff LIGHTNING fast because the ONLY downside to the bay is the LEEEEEECHERS!

I *loathe* leechers that dont' seed.

I *reward* seeders with invites.  Post if you are a good seeder and just maybe I'll throw ONE or TWO invites.  Peace."
,rik81h,2009-12-04T15:28Z,"MrMightythefox
I'd be interested in hearing about the tracker. I'm a member of many trackers with very good ratios on them but i haven't been able to find any that provide what mininova and demonoid do.
To eztv kudos as always"
,MrMightythefox,2009-12-04T16:10Z,"@rik81h: give up an email - can't be gmail- we will talk.  It's a VERY private tracker and I checked you out... I'll need references.  This is a Y-day site and it has GREAT download speeds.  I have a few invites to dole out; to be honest, one was being saved for a close and dear friend.  All I can say is this tracker makes demonoid look like a fucking joke.  

Peace.

type in the following date in the ""show search"" :

06/22/73

you will see my comment at the bottom. I don't like dissemenating information on the bay.  Too many sharks and not enough chum.  Follow my directions EXACTLY and you'll find me, peace.
