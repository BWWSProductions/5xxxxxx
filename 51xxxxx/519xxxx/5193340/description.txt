                    Gabriella.                               
                    Wedding days should be filled with romance and  
                    hope. The trouble is that Gabriella, aka Gabby,  
                    is marrying a man who isn't romantic and is  
                    sort of hopeless. From the moment he proposed  
                    at the Costa Coffee counter in Chievely service  
                    station, Del was never quite the full package  
                    husband material. The charge towards the altar  
                    is led by Del's uptight sister Sarah, who is  
                    determined her brother's wedding should go  
                    without a hitch. But will her plans come  
                    unstuck when an unexpected guest arrives? On  
                    the island, Will has gone missing, so the group  
                    organise a search party. Dan tries to get a  
                    private moment with Carrie, but now that their  
                    fling is public knowledge, she seems distant.  
                    Oh, and then there's the small matter of  
                    Gabriella's bump, the baby kind.
