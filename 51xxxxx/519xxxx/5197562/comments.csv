,Klug_Kopf,2009-12-12T06:52Z,"Installed Win 7 without any problems, connected to the internet and installed my Anti-Virus software and firewalls, however, when it came to using the ""Windows 7 Loader"" it came up with high-risk malware trying to do something to my boot sector.  I told my PC to block the threat and it continued the installation.  It completed successfully, so it said, and rebooted like I was told it should.  When it reloaded, the 30-day activation was still there.  What's the deal?"

,Harlequinzel,2009-12-29T21:53Z,"@donRauno,
If you've got more than one hard drive you can do it, otherwise I advise you backup all your important stuff, install it, and put it back on after it's done.

Otherwise it'll just get wiped."
,stvtrn,2009-12-30T01:06Z,"okay, i definitely need help.
