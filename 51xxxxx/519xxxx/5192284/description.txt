A fascinating investigation into the rarefied world of "outliers" â€“ the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. Wondering what makes high-achievers different, the author of Blink takes a look at their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. 

"Gladwell does an exceptionally effective job reading his book. His tone is informative and matter-of-fact, and he has a soothing voice that presents the information clearly." â€”AudioFile

Synopsis:
The best-selling author of Blink identifies the qualities of successful people, posing theories about the cultural, family, and idiosyncratic factors that shape high achievers, in a resource that covers such topics as the secrets of software billionaires, why certain cultures are associated with better academic performance, and why the Beatles earned their fame. Simultaneous.

Book Reviews:
"Buoyed by two runaway bestsellers, BLINK and THE TIPPING POINT, Gladwell has positioned himself as a roving ambassador between cultural and corporate America, penetrating boardrooms and living rooms, providing bullet points for cocktail parties and management seminars, and changing not just the things we talk about but the way we talk about them."
Salon - Louis Bayard (11/17/2008)
 

Author Bio:
In his Acknowledgments to THE TIPPING POINT, Malcolm Gladwell tells how he got his dream job at the New Yorker magazine: a freelancer, he wrote a piece (which he later expanded to THE TIPPING POINT) and the editor at the time, Tina Brown, hired him "to my surprise and delight." At the New Yorker he is obligated to produce 40-50,000 words per year, he has said on his website, but he is free to write "about everything under the sun." Gladwell's two books, THE TIPPING POINT and BLINK spent many weeks on the New York Times hardcover and paperback best seller lists--sometimes appearing simultaneously. His engaging forays into pop culture and everyday life are revealing keyholes into how we live today, and since he is a good explainer he just makes things more interesting than they usually appear. Gladwell has a history degree from Trinity College, University of Toronto, and he spent years working for the Washington Post.

From Wiki:

Outliers is a non-fiction book written by Malcolm Gladwell and published by Little, Brown and Company on November 18, 2008. In Outliers, Gladwell examines the factors that contribute to high levels of success. To support his thesis, he examines the causes of why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in the first few months of the calendar year, how Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates achieved his extreme wealth, and how two people with exceptional intelligence, Christopher Langan and J. Robert Oppenheimer, end up with such vastly different fortunes. Throughout the publication, Gladwell repeatedly mentions the "10,000-Hour Rule", claiming that the key to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practising a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours.

The publication debuted at number one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail on November 28, 2008, holding the position on both lists for eight weeks straight as of January 16, 2009. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background and the rest of the publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex sociological phenomena.
