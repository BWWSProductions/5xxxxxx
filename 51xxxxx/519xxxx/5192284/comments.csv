,yazz00,2010-12-22T22:16Z,"Malcolm Gladwell is so full of shit. This religious-like following he has acquired is strange, because what he says has nothing to do with how great people like Gates actually made their money. It's bullshit for feeble minds."
[V],FerraBit,2010-12-25T05:09Z,"@yazz00 - uh, thanks for the feedback? You're welcome?

Good thing the book isn't about how people make money, 
but more about less obvious dynamics, environments, 
variables, etc of successful people.
