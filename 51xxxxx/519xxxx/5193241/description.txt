Hello there. As far as I can see this pack was missing. So I just collected them and uploaded them for all you to enjoy. Most of them are mp4 and some mkv. I didn't rip them myself. They're just the releases of the known sub teams that upload one piece every week, so all the credits go to them.

Well I know that some people don't have systems that support playback of these HD files. Well I dont have time rencoding them in avi's. So I did my part. You got the collection. If someone has enough time he can do the job.

Here are the links if you want the whole thing

Enjoy and keep seeding

PS: the pack 1-300 doesnt include one episode. It's episode 156. I got it and i will upload it soon. Cheers
