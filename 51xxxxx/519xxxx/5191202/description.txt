[DGCD022] The solid fullenght release from Latvian industrial group which has unique sounding, atmosphere and concept. The "Likuma burts" (Letter of the Law) penetrates one's mind with massive layers of noisy industrial in combination with metallic percussion and ambient fever. The dramatic martial opus shines with a distinct Strops (Bee-hive) peal, - transcendent, anxious and snug. Latvian speaking barricade industrial documentaries air strong anti-consumerist concept, a hint of despise towards globalisation and philistinism, a resistant message about forgotten price of freedom paid again only 16 years ago... 10 tracks in aesthetic digipack, printed on a special cardboard. Released in collaboration with Sturm. Limited to 500 copies.
