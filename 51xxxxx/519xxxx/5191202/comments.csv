Maybe it's some md5 check errors or something like that. If U have stuck on 91%, don't worry - U already have everything U need - all FLAC data, artwork, images, etc. MP3 data were somehow damadged. U can just stop downloading at 91% and enjoy. I will reupload this soon and it will look properly again."
