,yolandiz,2010-03-31T06:27Z,"Awesome Program!! just 1 question...I got everything working with update 1.2, but I did not do all the updates in between. Alot of the sounds get an error..""can't find soundsource"" in core library...Is this because I didn't do all the updates in the right order? Should I roll back the player and try again (without re-instally the library) Please...anyone who can help..how can I fix the missing sounds problem?? Thanks!! "
,yolandiz,2010-04-02T04:18Z,"Has anyone got all the sounds to work on this? I got it going great, but there are alot of missing sounds. What's up??"
,bartgreat,2010-05-30T01:31Z,"This is idea so far of installing the program + UPDATES:

Install the main program, it will automatically walk you through 6 DVD which will install all the libraries.
From the updates folder, run:
 - AiR-Omnisphere_Software_Update_1_0_1e (either win or mac)
 - Omnisphere_Patch_Library_Update_1_0_2
 - Omnisphere_Soundsource_Library_Update_1_0_1
This is the easy part, now you have a working VST instrument.

However, if you want the updates, you will need to do the following ones:
 - 1.0.2d
 - 1.0.3 (and patch library update 1.0.3 and soundsources library update 1.0.2)
 - 1.1.4c (and patch library update 1.0.5); 
 - 1.2.0n (patch library 1.2.0 and software 1.2.0n

One other update i found was 1.3.1, but it says you need 1.3.0 for it to work, and i havent found that one yet.

Please correct me if anything is wrong.

This puppy is going to be mine soon (in a box i mean ;-)) it just seems too good."
,jjay590,2010-06-16T02:27Z,hi im having trouble with the sounds i got the vst to open on fl 9 but when i click on any of the sounds it says core library is missing and stuff  how do i fix it please reply..where do i find and put core library???
,erech2k2,2010-07-19T05:29Z,"I usually have no trouble installing programs, but this one has me stumped.  Instructions seem simple, but after I install the program, I try to update and it asks me for the Steam folder.  The only Steam folder is in All Users\App Data\Spectrasonics but it's a shortcut.  Since I couldn't load any of the updatesl, I tried the keygen and it appears to work fine for me.  Instruc from Bartgreat seems nice, but where do you get the referenced Update 1 0 1a from?

,MatrixA,2010-10-21T17:55Z,"To anybody having problems installing Omnisphere:
After 2 days I think I found the problem:
1.Install Omnisphere + Soundbanks normally. Do not open any DAW / vstHost yet!
2.) Go to your Vst Directory (Default is C:\Program Files\Steinberg\VSTplugins\ and rename the Omnisphere.dll to Omnisphere.OLD
3.) Do the same for the Spectrasonics Plugins Directory
4.) As far as I know you do not need to install all dll Updates (i.e. 1.0.1 1.02 etc) just install the latest.
5.) Check the dll in the Vst folder to be newer than the .old we renamed before.
6.) Run your DAW/vsthost as administrator
7.) Load omnisphere VST
8.) Authorize with Keygen. Worked for me first time, but as mentioned by others, try a few times.
9.) You will be asked to completely close the VST and all instances (inserts in AbletonLive) and re add the VST.
10.) Enjoy"

I`ve downloaded all six CD`s but I can`t install it. 
When I`m trying to install the second CD, it is always asking for the steam folder:

""This is not a STEAM folder. Perhaps you selected a shortcut? The STEAM folder must have an Omnisphere / Settings Library subfolder""


But there is no Steam folder! And that`s why I cannot install the further CD`s 2,3,4,5,6

Does anyone know how to solve this problem?

,DonkiesRunnin,2012-02-29T02:48Z,"I have successfully installed all discs and I believe all the updates.

I can get Omnisphere to open and run in ProTools 8 on XP as an instrument. However, it says the core library is missing the files for all the synths etc..

This doesnt make sense to me yet, because i installed all the discs with no problems... I do have the Instrument library on a seperate internal drive, which I connected to when first opening the synth.

Here is the error i get when choosing a soundsource:

'Cannot load soundsource ""Organics Rhodes Body Noisy"" from directory ""Core Library"" File Organics Rhodes Body Noisy.zmap may be missing or corrupted. Try refreshing the soundsource browser.'

Has anyone come across this error?


I do notice that in my STEAM folder there are two folders. One name 'OMNISPHE' which is 32.9G and the second named 'Omnisphere' which is 178MB.

Is it possible it is referencing the wrong folder?  Im not sure is there is supposed to be two folders and why one is shortnamed..."

The valid response keys have ***72 characters*** in them. All of them.

Use the keygen included in the 1.0.3f update, not this one, which generates 86-character keys errantly. Remember, 72 characters."

1: Omnisphere Software update Win 1.0.3f

4. Boot up omnisphere in your DAW
5. Copy challenge code into keygen included in 1.0.3f (again, if it's not there check your quarantine in your antivirus software)
6. Generate response code, paste where instructed, make sure it worked by closing the instance of Omnisphere, then reopening a new instance of it.
7. Omnisphere 1.1.4c Update
