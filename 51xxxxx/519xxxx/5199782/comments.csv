,FrostyC,2009-12-11T21:02Z,"I don't believe there is a pirated release with english audio yet. It was an independent release with make it low-radar for the warez scene.

It was originally made in english, however, people are having a hard time getting ahold of the english audio for some reason, or they just don't care..."

[T],despo1ler,2009-12-19T13:59Z,"this is still the only copy of this movie available in any language, thanks very much to the uploader for the effort, these foreign language copies are important to us because they make it a lot easier to create a TS because all that is needed is the english audio, a lot easier to record than sitting through a movie with a video camera next to you, but no-one has yet bothered getting an english soundtrack and unless someone does record the english audio we will not see an english version for some time.
 So in summary,foreign language copies of movies are an important part of the english pirate copies and without them we would have a hell of a lot less movies available before they are released on DVD so always say thank you to the uploader."
,CrazyMama,2009-12-21T22:32Z,Can't wait to see this movie! Thank you to everyone along the way that makes it possible!
