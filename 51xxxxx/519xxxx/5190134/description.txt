    Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fleet Foxes Are Not Hippies,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ran the recent headline of a feature in a Seattle arts paper, just above a smaller headline that read: Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let the Floppy Hats, Jesus Beards and Five-Part Vocal Harmonies About Rivers, Trees and Sunshine Throw You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½

    With a start like that, you half expected what followed to turn into something from The Onion. Instead, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s de facto leader, Robin Pecknold, explained that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“hippyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ accoutrements of dabblers such as Chris Robinson, of the Black Crowes, were symptomatic of an acquisitiveness that couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be further removed from what hippies initially stood for.

    You can see why it might be a tricky area. The five members of Fleet Foxes must have heard some music made in their lifetimes, but you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know it from hearing this debut. Fleet Foxes is proof that the US alt-folk well has yet to run dry. And, indeed, much of what follows an introductory liturgy called Red Squirrel/Sun Rises sounds like a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young improvising to keep their spirits up while waiting to be rescued from a well.

    So much music meant to evoke what Greil Marcus, in Invisible Republic, referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“old, weird AmericaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ does so simply by keeping it spare and pushing up the reverb knob so that the results canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but sound ethereal. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an element of that approach with Fleet Foxes. At the same time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in particular on the rapt, wordless dawn chorus of Heard Them Stirring Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it highlights the breadth of their harmonic span. Miraculously for a 21-year-old, Pecknold appears to have perfected the art of writing songs that appear not so much written as retrieved from your own subconscious. Van Morrison achieved a similar thing on his 1974 masterpiece Veedon Fleece, tapping into what he has called a shared Ã¢â‚¬Å“folk memoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.

    On Tiger Mountain Peasant Song, Pecknold delves into imagery that could have come straight from that album: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wanderers this morning came by, Where did they go, Graceful in the morning light, To banner fair.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Your Protector is no less cinematic in its span, a last will and testament mapped out around the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest hook. On the folk ballad Oliver James, gentle picking gives way to Pecknold detailing its subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Washed in the rain, no longer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½

    Sounding like a desolate Neil Young over a choir of David Crosbys, Pecknold delivers the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sustained shiver on Meadowlarks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little children laughing at the boys and girls,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he sings as though broadcasting from a fever dream, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The meadowlarks singing to you each and every day.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And far from being lost in translation, the beauty he writes about seems magnified when Fleet Foxes set about recreating it in notes and chords.
