,macster2010,2009-12-01T12:14Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5190578/X-Plane_9_Disk_1 the Disk needed to play this and get rid of 10 min playing limitation.
,ras_yo,2009-12-01T14:56Z,50GB!? ... Seems to be a fake ....
,mrbman,2009-12-01T18:47Z,"It's not the fake. This is the scenery for the flight simulator. You don't need all of it. But the total scenery that comes with the official X-Plane DVDs is about 70 gb... My X-Plane game folder is 156 gb. But that's with the addition of ""third party"" aircraft and scenery."
,mrbman,2009-12-01T18:47Z,"Oops, ""It's not A fake"". Sorry about that!"
,macster2010,2009-12-04T04:18Z,it is all scenery installed..  well worth it!
,dsalsa,2009-12-04T04:51Z,So this is just the scenery not the actual game?
,GodOfSharing,2009-12-13T03:33Z,"Great upload. Thanks.

Need some instructions. Do I use your accompanying install disc, install, then add this folder to the one installed. If so, then where is it placed?
Appreciate some help."
,GodOfSharing,2009-12-13T08:28Z,"Never mind, I figured it out.

The big folder has the complete game and the DVD image is to mount while playing  to make it the full version."
,macster2010,2009-12-18T08:34Z,"i also found out that u really dont need to use toast, i just assumed at first cause im so used to image files when mounted with default disk utility the game usually does not recognize it as a CD/DVD, but for this game u can use  either toast or disk utility,  and just to be clear  this is zipped up installed with updates, altho i had some problems with it so i went back to regular if i remember correctly default street lights and default clouds, instead of the so called improved stuff of that  cause (and im guessing, my VRAM card couldnt handle it)  and what i mean by this  is  like very low Visibility and then if u were to take a screen shot of it,  it then becomes more visible around the plane, then  visibility goes down again  so..  with default stuff does not happen for me anymore  so  if ur experiencing this, please comment,  and i will upload what u will need to fix it back!"
,piratenoy,2009-12-19T19:06Z,2 seeders wtf
,krp2nte,2009-12-23T16:44Z,"I have the most amazing idea....


SEED IT!  currently DLing for 5 days and have a whopping 13.4gb's.  Current rate of 8-11KB/s.


BTW--I've uploaded 26GB's---so c'mon peeps--let's do this!"
,SlapJack1,2009-12-28T07:47Z,"i dont have 50 gb on my computer, i downloaded the disk 1,its asking for disk 2 but know what?"
,dacianvv,2009-12-31T00:49Z,"pls, pls seed"
,macster2010,2009-12-31T05:32Z,"slapjack  if u have an external firewire or USB 2.0 hard drive  u can use that instead to download to,   and disk one is really the play DVD,  hence why u need to get my other torrent..  if u have no room on hard drive u might as well even forget even trying until u get at least a 500 gig external hard drive..."
,something_new,2010-01-12T09:13Z,"Guys, I'm such a noob. How do I run this? I've burned the first DVD but still it doesn't run. In which location do I put the 50Gb plus unzip? Too compensate my noobness, I'm seeding the at 400Kbps :-) Thanks"
,Sdraer,2010-01-30T10:23Z,"Great seeding guys!  Getting 150-200kbps even on a cruddy line in Australia.

Cheers, keep up the good work. It is appreciated!

Sdraer

PS will seed."
,navidh,2010-02-10T20:21Z,"Thanks for the upload
The current version is 9.45, is it safe to update this??"
,macster2010,2010-02-17T08:24Z,"@navidh 
I tried to once, and it crashed constantly for me, but I assume that 9.45 tho needs more horsepower or something, cause it just seemed (when it did run) abit slower..  so it really depends on your mac... I am still using the 2006 MacBook Pro, and 9.31 is fine enough for me.. but if u do want to update I highly suggest you back up the resource and whatever else u want before u (and always keep the original x-plane 9.zip file as well) update to 9.45, just in case you know.."
,Atheistic,2010-02-19T00:25Z,"Dude, we need SEEDERS!!! I'm running at DL 1.4K and UL at 600K. Come on people!!! It's not that difficult to seed. 14 days to download?!"
,JieBie,2010-02-27T20:47Z,"Finally I downloaded in more than 5 weeks the full zip-file (53,36 GB). I have used several unzip programs, but none was able to unzip the file correctly. Please advice me which 'free' unzip file I must use."
,captaind,2010-03-08T03:08Z,It didn't work.  Can someone just upload all of the install disks so it can be installed properly.
,matlosz,2010-03-25T03:06Z,"downloaded ok within 3 days but zip was corrupted :(
anyway thanks macster2010 for trying ... any chance you upload individual DVDs in the future? "
,something_new,2010-05-05T08:26Z,"I've already seeded 870Gb on this one. Who's the man?!

Greetz from portugal"
,lordg88,2010-08-04T17:36Z,need some more seeders please if possible?
,KeyserSoze88,2010-10-03T14:58Z,"macster2010
Thx for the great upload. Just wondering if you could, for the novices in here, tell us which file to d/load and mount with Disc utility 1st? The 7Gb file I have opened 1st with Disc Utility and clicked Install. It has gone thru the Install process and is now asking me for Disc 2. I am now unzipping the 49Gb file and then will open it with Disc Utility. I assume this is Disc 2 that the Installer is now asking for?
Many thx."
,Go-Pirate,2010-12-25T19:12Z,"Thanks a lot macster2010!
It is another Christmas present on today Christmas day.

Could you please hint me a little bit more?
Merry Christmas!"
,Rexen82,2012-04-18T12:37Z,"i donÂ´t found disc 2 for installing... where can i found it?
