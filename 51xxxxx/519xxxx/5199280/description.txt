Tarpley's main topic on this weeks show is the escalation of the Afghan War.  With the insertion of 35,000 more troops, Pakistan propaganda, and all the other lies that he is spewing these days, Webster states that Obama is "channeling Bush/Cheney".


In the second hour is the weekly update by Phil Berg [obamacrimes.com] on the Obama birth certification issue.  Other 2nd hour topics include Ron Paul's "Audit The Fed" bill, socialized health care, bailouts and Tobin taxes.


Other topics include the Obama gay lover/cocaine scandal and possible U.S. economic recovery solutions.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
