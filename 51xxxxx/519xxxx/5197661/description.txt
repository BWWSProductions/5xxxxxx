Most of You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 3 is devoted the 1984 band which, at the time of this set's release, had not been properly documented (the live Does Humor Belong in Music? was made commercially available in the U.S. in 1995 only). Most of the material comes from late-'70s/early-'80s albums like Sheik Yerbouti, Joe's Garage, and You Are What You Is. Disc one is 1984 only (excerpt for a few edits in "Drowning Witch" and lacks interest. This band (Ike Willis, Ray White, Bobby Martin, Alan Zavod, Scott Thunes, Chad Wackerman) was competent but square and performances tended to resemble one another. Of significance for completists are "Ride My Face to Chicago," "Carol, You Fool," "Nig Biz," and "Chana in de Bushwop," all regular inclusions during that tour and unavailable elsewhere, but for the casual listener they hardly make the album worth buying. Disc two contains a few gems: the original version of "Dickie's Such an Asshole" (from December 1973), a slow and seductive "Zoot Allures" from 1975, and a 25-minute "King Kong" that collages wild performances from 1971 and 1982.
