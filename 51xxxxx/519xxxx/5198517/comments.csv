,siabod,2009-12-17T06:04Z,anyone used this successfully with PAL RB2? Can anyone tell what each wad is for. a bit weary of installing unknown wads!
,nyath22,2009-12-20T15:56Z,"I have a PAL wii and it worked with rb2, atleast about 50% of the songs (that are listed on wikipedia's rock band DLC list) were able to be downloaded. The other 50% didn't show up what so ever. But it's still 50% of songs for free :D
To bad the breaking benjamins weren't part of them :("
,cdtext,2009-12-28T14:29Z,"Excuse my ignorance, but is there any reason someone can't just download all the songs for us and so we can copy them to a SD card when we need them.  Or would it be possible for someone to make a custom Rockband with all songs already there."
,Adyz789,2010-01-21T17:00Z,"Works like a charm! Like 75% of the songs say purchased and can be dlled. Only thing is that the other 25% just says: ""200"" (as in ""pay 200 wii points and you can download it"")

This is the case with the Queen songs and indeed the breaking benjamin songs as someone above me has already noted (altough the 50% of him is a bit harsh)

Is this because we are in need of an update? and in that case can we expect one? would be really gratefull!!!

Ow and to the poster above me, I don't think it works that way, when you would put the songs that i dlled on you SD card I don't think ""Rock Band"" would identify them as songs since you don't have a registered ""purchased"" at their store, so the only way is using this crack for the 75% of free songs ;) (which is really really great )"
