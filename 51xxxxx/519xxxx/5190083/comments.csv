You are reminding to the shop where I used to go ages ago. Saving me lots of time exploring what there is to explore. Thank you! (I am just so worried where to go when PB will disappear just like mininova did recently)"

@daK: I put some details about Kidstreet's upcoming album release in the Pirate Bay description of August 2009's playlist. It should still accurate.

Also, if anyone wants to suggest songs/artists for use in future CTC playlists, there's a form you can fill out here: http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dGlzY1d0elJwNUg4UFpEcTg0cVBOZlE6MA

Thanks again!"
