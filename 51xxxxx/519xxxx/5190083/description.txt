`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - NOVEMBER 2009        `
       ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This month: new Animal Collective, The Golden Filter, Beach House,
Vampire Weekend and more! Previously unreleased RJD2! Sia changes! Emily
Haines is depressing! Miike Snow get a techno-heavy remix! Beck goes
acoustic! And it all ends with a new, ridiculous nine-minute track by
Four Tet!

Sounds like a night to me. On the down side, Mininova is dead. Shit.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM ME, ZOOEY DESCHANEL AND LEON REDBONE!
