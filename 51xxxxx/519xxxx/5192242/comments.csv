Dub?
Languages?
A little more info would be nice"
,knuckles111,2009-12-15T00:47Z,"OMG the language is not ENGLISH and unless I am doing something wrong the subtitles are not even a language.
The video comes on MP4 with a separate smi file next to it. I put this smi file on in VLC player but it is the same incoherent language that comes up automatically.

Anyone have any ideas ? if not then I would avoid, shame the pictures nice."
,seiken573,2010-01-02T08:47Z,"So, the subtitles that come with the torrent are supposedly Korean, and I cant find English subtitles on the original mkv files. 

So perhaps we need a way to download just the subtitle files? 
"
,gringo44,2010-03-15T22:10Z,delete the .smi files and the subtitles will change to english.  I just found out by coincidence
,gringo44,2010-03-15T22:19Z,and one more thing I also discovered that the french italian and german subtitles are on them as well
,darkhunt333,2010-03-17T07:47Z,"To sum this torrent up.  Read before downloading.


Video quality: 10/10 

Audio: Great Japanese ONLY audio.

Subtitles: They look like fucking hieroglyphs. Maybe Korean? 100% NO!~English or Japanese SUBS!  Deleting the .smi file file get rid of the subs.  It will not make them into English, that's just fucking retarded."
,prewitt,2010-06-07T16:40Z,"How about you all LEARN WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT??

I don't know what media player you use, but I use VLC. It's simply the best. Anyway, in VLC, simply right click on the video. Then roll your mouse over ""Audio."" Then roll it over ""Audio track."" THEN...click the button CLEARLY LABELED ENGLISH!! (Or whatever language you desire!)

THEN right click and roll over ""Video,"" then ""Subtitle track."" Congrats, now you can change the subtitles, or disable them.

This is a PERFECT upload. It has the show with every single language it's ever been dubbed in, every singe language it's been subtitled with, AND the quality is simply AMAZING!

Cx902b, You're amazing. I thank you greatly. "
,Alcax,2010-06-18T15:18Z,"Hello Guys, i'm desperatly trying to change the subtitels into english, but when i click on video-->subtitle track, there isn't really much that i can change. I can simply chose between deactivating, brose andsubtitle 1. Please help me, i spent days downloading this torrent and i don't want it to be in vain!

P.S. Deleting the .smi files simply deletes the korean subtitels. it doesn't change them into englisch!"
,Hejjhejj,2010-07-06T05:00Z,"@prewitt
How about YOU learn what you're talking about??

The first season/series is in the MP4 container and only has one audio track with zero internal subtitle tracks at all, and the .smi files provided are in Korean or whatever, which means NO ENGLISH SUBS FOR THE FIRST SEASON.

On a side note, VLC is not ""simply the best""... sure it might be the best for people who are too lazy to learn how to configure MPC properly, but w/e...
And FYI I tried both MPC and VLC..."
,bakapollon,2010-07-07T11:06Z,"Have heard that we can use subs thats have been made from earlyer Dvd releases, But I cant find any dvd releases that I can use.

If someone finds a subtitles for Dvd plz share."
,Hejjhejj,2010-07-07T19:01Z,"I'm getting this weird ""Database error."" when posting comments... test123"
,Hejjhejj,2010-07-08T00:28Z,"OK, so I downloaded another release by [KAA] and ripped their subs...
Note that these subs are Advanced SubStation Alpha (like the Rolls-Royce of subtitles) and not some lame .srt =)

So here are the English subtitles for those who want them:

There is no karaoke/translation for the opening, but you'll just have to live with that."
,Hejjhejj,2010-07-08T00:32Z,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Great, so the hotlink takes you to some weird site... :/

Just copy-paste the URL instead and it should work!"
,KeiKun83,2010-08-27T14:27Z,"@Hejjhejj:

You, good sir, are a god amongst men! Thank you very, very much!! =)=)=)"
,anfeaster,2010-10-26T08:27Z,"You should all know, since there seems to be confusion... the first season is messed up, the second season is in many languages, and the third I think is only Japanese with English subtitles. Anyway, here's a link for the subs for season 1

,YiffyFox117,2010-11-18T00:37Z,"So I got this torrent a few weeks ago and just now opened it up. And what to my surprise, I didn't have any subs, so I thought that I would have to use the dubs, only to find out that the first season's dubs DON'T EXIST! When I turned them on, no sound came out and several other audio options were disabled! But once I downloaded the subs provided by Hejjhejj, it worked fine! The video format is a little weird but still viewable. The other two seasons are perfectly fine if you want subs.

In sort this is still a good torrent and as long as you download Hejjhejj's subs, you should be able to view this without a problem!"
,randomflip,2011-01-12T12:18Z,Can someone reupload Hejjhejj subs. His site is down and his is the only one I could find with KAA subs
,Puma05,2011-02-13T20:06Z,Englesh my ass is japaniz all dey long 
,chronuss,2011-02-23T20:50Z,Some one seed plz! This thing is not moving at all!
,favoknago,2011-08-10T07:19Z,"for people who seem to have problems, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5503500 Seems to be more legit than this one :)"
,kai201,2011-08-13T20:23Z,Fucking torrent......japanese audio with no frigging sub...... gringo44 and prewitt you two can go fuck yourself!!!!!!! brainless noobs!!!
,Veind,2011-09-09T01:37Z,OK to sum it up the only problem with this download is that it is missing the English Sub file for the first Season. anfeaster's link to the website was legit and  the download worked. If you know how to use subtitles (which is easy) that's what you need to fix this torrent.
,dezertor999,2011-09-18T20:54Z,btw on FMP fumoffu if u delete subtittles file then engl sub go to normal
