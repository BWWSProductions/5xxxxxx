Subtitles are not available separately for this movie. The copy of the movie I got 

hold of has closed captions. Since these get lost in compression to standard size

I resorted to uploading it in ISO form, which preserves the subtitles. There is a 

lot about this business that's hard for me to comprehend.


I hope you don't have trouble handling it. If so, contact me, John Gordon, at
