With the 2004 club smash 'To The Club' under his belt, Italian DJ and producer Agostino Carollo AKA Spankox set to work on a secret remix of Elvis Presley's 'Baby Let's Play House'. With the blessing of the Elvis Estate and officially becoming only the third person ever to remix Elvis, Spankox wenton to remix a further ten Elvis classics. Tracks such as 'Heartbreak Hotel', 'Jailhouse Rock' and 'All Shook Up' are given a respectful, contemporary dance make-over with the assistance of fellow producer Highpass, whilst helping to unleash the Elvis phenomenon to a whole new audience. 
Released May 2008 is the first complete remix album of Elvis. The Italian DJ Spankox  was brave enough to engage in this endeavor. Should he be praised or crucified?
