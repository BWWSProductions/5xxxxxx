,agarza251,2010-02-24T02:35Z,Excellent!!! works great!
,jkinst,2010-02-28T02:55Z,"you guys have got to be kidding.  you zipped and archived folders that all have broken fragments of the update!

Anyone reading this: do not waste your time with this torrent.  It's not at all clear what to do and all the files I downloaded seem to be broken. "
,jkinst,2010-03-02T19:44Z,"Ok, finally figured this out.  No thanks to TvTeam. Using either Winarc or 7zip, you must first unzip all 12 zip files to the same folder.  Then run the extractor again on the first archive file ending with .r00.  This will produce two files - redT and setup.

Their cracked file is the actual Rhino.exe which is in the redT folder.  Their intention is that you replace your Rhino.exe executable file in your installation directory (C:\ProgramFiles\Rhinoceros 4.0\System\Rhino.exe), or wherever you have it installed, with their version that is located in this folder.

Their version of Rhino has their name on it with no other identifying infor and is ready to go. However, it's not clear how to verify that's it's SR7.  One of the plugins I wanted to install, Paneling Tools, which is compatible only with SR7, returns a message saying that this version of Rhino needs to be upgraded to the latest service release.

So their it is.  Who knows what i just upgraded to..."
,lazyjak,2010-03-08T13:34Z,"exactly like ""jkinst"" it discribe. Has to unzip two times, then it works. But you get an >undefined< version. At my one needs to upgrade for V-ray to work with new materials. After upgrade  from SR5 to SR7 it works fine. No bugs untill now,- works  without error. "
,rubytuesday25,2010-03-14T16:10Z,"Anyone know how to get around this undefined version problem.  There's no real point in having the latest release if you can't install new plug-ins.

Thanks jkisnt, and lazyjak, anyone know where to find a V-ray material library. "
,thecynic,2012-03-07T00:23Z,"I installed a SIGNMAKER cracked version that didn't work (I think it may have been a Win7 compatibility thing).
I followed jkinst's instructions to unpack.
I installed the update (rh40sr_en_20091030.exe) found the the ""setup"" folder. This updated my older non-working version.
Lastly I copied the cracked executable (Rhino4.exe) found in the unpacked ""redt"" folder, to the Rhino installation folder (C:Program Files (x86)Rhinoceros 4.0System) to overwrite the original.
It's only day 1, but it's working ... now all I have to do is learn how to use it :)"
