In the dark waters of the North Atlantic, the great passenger liner, R.M.S. Titanic, came to a violent and mysterious end. Each of her passengers were unwitting players in a harrowing drama: the builder who pronounced her dead; the brave men who fought to save her; thousands of people struggling for their lives. Now, for the first time, a prominent Titanic historian will retell her tragic tale from the ship's actual decks. Haunting locations will take us back to pivotal moments during the epic disaster. Newly discovered artifacts will help to piece together Titanic's untold stories. It's a moment in history we'll still striving to understand, yet impossible to forget.
