Eat3D - Unreal Kismet - Introduction


In this demonstration the instructor starts off by giving a detailed explanation of commonly used kismet nodes. Once the foundation is laid its on to creating several interactive scripted sequences. Everything from dramatically revealing a character, to creating a camera fly through for your portfolio is covered. This tutorial is appropriate for both artists and designers.

If you have never used the kismet editor you should be able to follow along and understand. Even if you are experienced using the Unreal Editor 3, you should pick up useful information throughout the DVD.
