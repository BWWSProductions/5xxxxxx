,OliverKerin,2009-12-22T05:33Z,"Downloaded and I can confirm that this works with neogamma on my 4.2e soft modded wii.
Didnt try with USB loader sorry people but I am sure it will work.
Thanks for the great upload :)"
,Valtrex666,2010-01-19T04:38Z,"I hear this works on Neogama after burning a disk. However it does not work correctly at all with USB Loader GX. Everything is gray scale and item locations are at weird locations off screen. I've downloaded about 100 files (scrubbed & non scrubbed) and have successfully placed and tested them using an external HD, so I say this doesn't work with my system. (4.2u w/usbloaderGx). Thanks anyways uploader"
,rldowling,2010-04-22T20:02Z,Works great on my 4.2E softmod with new drivechip that doesnt allow burnt games but still runs perfectly on Configurable USB Loader
