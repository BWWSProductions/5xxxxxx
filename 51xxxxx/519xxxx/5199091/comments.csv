,xiIix,2009-12-08T03:09Z,"The fuck are you talking about, guy? The i7 is 4 cores and 8 threads. As in, it's a hyper-threaded quad core.

I can't even explain how retarded the term ""8 cpus 16 cores"" is. Do you really believe that your machine has 8 socketed dual core CPU's in it? Because that's the only thing any of us tech dudes are going to assume you're trying to claim with that statement.

So just to be clear, your machine has 1 CPU, with 4 cores, which can process 8 threads of information IF you're running an application that will take advantage of that. 90% of the time you'll never be processing more than 2 threads at a time. "
