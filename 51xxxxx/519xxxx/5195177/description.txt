**********************

This book teaches humanities majors the accessibility and beauty of discrete and deductive mathematics. It assumes no prior knowledge of either college-level mathematics or political science, and could be offered at the freshman or sophomore level. The book devotes one chapter each to a model of escalation, game-theoretic models of international conflict, political power, and social choice. The material progresses in level of difficulty as the book progresses. The author is a recognized expert in applying ideas in modern mathematics to problems in international conflict resolution. Intended for non-specialists and requiring only introductory mathematics, the quantitative methods are presented in strongly applied settings for political science and the social sciences.
