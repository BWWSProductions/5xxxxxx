Carrantuohill - Speed Celts - Celtic Music Group - Folk


The title, as well as the music of this album, should by taken literally.
Lively, at times even untamed interpretations of traditiobal Irish tunes instantly bring us within the walls of a crowded pub in Dublin, Tubbercurry or Boston.
That's right - speeding reel Sililver Spire suddenly transforming into wild rhythm & blues... Now wait - the most essential remains: the tradition of Irish music; the embellishment of the "power of Slavic spirit" only adds a different, perhaps more familiar savor.
