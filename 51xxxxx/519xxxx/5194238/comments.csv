,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-03T17:53Z,nothing added or removed apart from need for activation
,meroonberet,2009-12-03T18:20Z,is it in english version? and is it final version?
,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-03T18:29Z,version 6.1 build 7600 and is multi language
,emisaki,2009-12-03T19:41Z,which language it is?
,cwgate,2009-12-04T12:41Z,Stuck at 14% 
,emisaki,2009-12-04T14:33Z,is it final version?
,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-04T14:56Z,"vioblue i havent tried that one, but doe's seem similar.
as for being stuck at 14% not sure why as i have been seeding for last 22hrs constantly and as there was over 1600 leachers last night i can't say i'm surprised it's slow as my average upload speed at the present is approx 470kb/s but average uploaders getting approx 20kb/s, so hang in there and when more people get full download perhaps they will help seed too (altho most never seem to bother

,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-04T15:00Z,YES I DO BELIEVE IT'S FINAL VERSION

,SpiritWolfe,2009-12-06T15:40Z,"Greetings ad Salutations!

Is this the FULL NON-upgrade version that once installed will act like it was activated? 

Meaning, I do not have to worry about the Windows Genuine Advantage ""check programs"" that gets installed when Windows Update is ""always on""?

Windows Update will still be available for the necessary updates to 7, correct?

Thanks for the help! :)
Cheers!"
,SpiritWolfe,2009-12-06T15:43Z,"@billgatesworstnightmare

BTW, I did not miss the ""nothing added or removed"" part of the comments section here.  I just wanted to clarify a couple of questions of mine... []

,michael189,2009-12-07T18:29Z,OMG man thank you so mutch !!!!!!!!!!!!! It works very good !!!!!!!!! 
,Pessimistic1,2009-12-07T19:49Z,"I dwnlded this ... got it installed ... no activation (meaning it NEEDS to be activated) ... also will not recognize NIC Card ... ""upgrading from Vista"" with clean install ... any suggestions?"
,Pessimistic1,2009-12-07T19:52Z,"I also get a message ""Microsoft Library Component"" has stopped working ... Check online for solution ... can't get online to check for solution (see previous post). Thanks"
,shadow-storm,2009-12-07T19:52Z,ok so i need to get a activation thingy or do i not ?
,Pessimistic1,2009-12-07T20:04Z,Got it to activate ... still can't get it to connect/recognize NIC driver. HELLLLLP! I've downloaded new ones ... pulled NIC out and replaced with another ... on verge of trying wireless.
,shadow-storm,2009-12-08T07:54Z,"Just started the install and so far so good.

i will seed this for 4 days maybe more let me know"
,shadow-storm,2009-12-08T10:42Z,"install finished awhile ago, got a few errors cant remember what they were. but is all working good apart from it being slugish at time and totaly freezing up. any ideas on why this would be happening?"
,ratonjd,2009-12-08T22:10Z,billgatesworstnightmare: I have a few questions. Is this torrent time limited? is going to expire or we're protected? I heard some copys were disabled by MS.. anything else we need to know before installing? Thanks! 
,brookdang,2009-12-09T00:18Z,"I can just download this, burn it to cd and boot up with it right?

Because I don't have an operating system at the moment."
,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-09T01:05Z,"Right to clear a few things up,

THIS VERSION REQUIRES NO ACTIVATION AS IS PRE ACTIVATED, YOU DO NOT NEED ANY KEYS, CRACKS OR PATCHES TO GET IT TO WORK! AND YES IT SO FAR SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE ON AUTO UPDATES FROM MICROSOFT WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT SOME PATCH OR HOTFIX MAY GET RELEASED TO ALLOW THIS OPERATING SYSTEM TO CHECK FOR AUTHENTIC KEYS, FACE IT LOOK AT XP AND VISTA GENUINE ADVANTAGE CHECKS.

Pessimistic1 YOUR NIC CARD OBVIOUSLY ISN'T SUPPORTED BY 7

DOWNLOAD IT, BURN TO DVD USING ULTA/POWERISO AND BOOT UP USING CD AND JOB DONE, YOU CAN EVEN USE IT AS AN UPGRADE FROM VISTA ITSELF

,trethel,2009-12-09T18:03Z,"Having a problem with installation... I get as far as ""preparing to start computer for the first time"" -- setting up user accounts, network, etc -- but on the final restart I encounter System Recovery which can't solve any problems.

Ideas?"
,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-09T20:52Z,"trethel are you trying to install as 32bit or 64bit and what are your pc's specs? 
i.e processor + speed, graphics card model, amount of ram.??

Bill Gates"
,trethel,2009-12-09T22:02Z,"64 bit.

Specs:

Intel core 2 duo @ 2000MHz
4gb ram

I believe the graphics card is an Intel gma x3100.

Heard about some problems with 4+ gb ram, so tried taking 2gb out, but still no luck."
,OMGOMGOMGIDUNNO,2009-12-10T00:41Z,"I don't kno why but, when I do upgrade install i always end with the message ""The computer started using the Windows installation disc. Remove the installation disc and restart your computer so that Windows start normally. Then, insert installation disc and restart the upgrade. (Do not select ?Custom (advanced)? to perform an upgrade. ?Custom (advanced? installs a new copy of Windows and deletes your programs and settings.) but when I take the disc out and hold the power button to restart (no restart button, obviously because there's no OS) and insert it and restart the upgrade, i get the same thing."
,iwilleatu,2009-12-10T02:56Z,"@omgomgomgidunno

To upgrade you have to be running the os you are trying to upgrade, for instance, have your vista running and just put the disc in and you'll get the win 7 screen, you'll see an upgrade button, click it, just follow the instructions and you're good. hope this helps"
,billgatesworstnightmare,2009-12-10T12:39Z,"trethel your specs are fine, might be worth checking your hard drive for errors as i'm affraid i can't be 100% sure what is happening with your installation sorry,

,tj1337,2009-12-11T01:14Z,great torrent...works good....i only had 1 problem...i needed more ram... :( but nice work..
,Joe1994,2009-12-13T03:04Z,i have a gig of ram could i run it?
,farty_breath,2009-12-13T12:54Z,"loaded up a treat, did all updates and this set it back to ""will auto activate in 3 days"" bugger.

No probs, used Daz's Loader v1.7.1 back to activated.

Does anyone know the KB number that pisses on the chips of this install then folk can block it to save buggering about, although it is under a minutes sodomy to sort if you have the loader ?"
,farty_breath,2009-12-13T13:01Z,"@Joe1994

I'm running it on  1 gig and it runs like a pregnant camel with it's hump on fire and only a 1.6Ghz celeron M lappy. These are min specs but seems fine to me."
,bullhalla,2009-12-14T07:54Z,"Installed fine on one machine... tried three times with the same DVD on another and it's not working.

Once I got to the desktop, checked activation, and just like torrent says, windows is already activated.

,monkey863,2010-03-05T00:11Z,"THIS IS IMPORTANT! to anyone downloading this torrent, please know to skip out on the march 2010 update for windows 7 or u will get a ""this copy of windows is not genuine"" message! and if u do accidentally get it, i managed to find an easy solution not posted anywhere yet. What i did was first uninstall the update thinking maybe that would do it, but it didnt. so i then tried to use a command prompt to give me 30 days of 'trial' to think of a solution. the command, slmgr -rearm , actually reactivated the oem product key for me (at least, thats what i think it did). But im quite sure this will only work after uninstalling the update (3/4/2010) and it can be avoided completely by just making sure u dont get the update!

,rohelio,2010-06-14T05:09Z,I installed today and so far so good without a hitch.  How did you manage to do what no one else has been able to do and roll the activation in to the install?  I thought it wasn't possible after XP?
