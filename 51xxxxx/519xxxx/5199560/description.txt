Edwyn Collins made a remarkable and unexpected comeback with Gorgeous George, and it's not hard to see why. The album represents a consolidation of Collins' skills as a songwriter, demonstrating both his vicious wit and his effortless melodicism. Working with former Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook and bassist Claire Kenny, he develops the hardest-hitting musical attack of his career, but it's also surprisingly versatile, capable not only of glam rock, but also jangle pop, folk-rock and blue-eyed soul. And while Collins can occasionally be accused of lyrical sniping -- the attack on Guns N' Roses in "North of Heaven" is simply silly -- there's no denying that when his words and music hit the same target, such as on the darkly catchy Iggy Pop tribute "A Girl Like You," the results are wonderfully cerebral pop music. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
