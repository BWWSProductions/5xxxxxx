    Christmas Rollercoaster Builder is a logical puzzle game.             
    Your goal is to build a Rollercoaster from one side of the            
    screen making your train able to collect the boxes on                 
    the way, and reach the other side without crashing.                   
                                                                          
    There are three levels, and all of them have two stages,              
    so you get 30 missions all together with constantly raising           
    severity.                                                             
                                                                          
    You can replay the game until you reach the perfect state and         
    collect ALL the boxes.                                                
                                                                          
    You can view a "replay video" after each finished stage.
