In terms of the bands represented on Wake Up! it's difficult to think of how the line-up could be improved. The Decemberists, The Dears, Broken Social Scene, The Shins and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah have been around for some time but are still considered top of the tree. While TV On The Radio, Of Montreal, Beirut, Voxtrot and Band Of Horses are all deemed to be serious challengers. The others Swan Lake, Deerhoof, Final Fantasy, Tapes 'n Tapes and Metric are all new to me.
