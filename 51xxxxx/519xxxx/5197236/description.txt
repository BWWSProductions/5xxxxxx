Sugar on a Stick (SoaS) enables children to reclaim computers. SoaS aims to make it easy for children, parents, or local deployers to provide each student with a small device (USB stick or thumbdrive) that can starts any computer with the student's personalized Sugar environment. We would like to see Sugar's presence, journal, and clarity principles usable on any machine â€” at school, at home, and anywhere there is a suitable computing device. Sugar on a Stick starts up ("boots") the host computer directly, without touching the hard disk; however, it may be necessary to adjust the computer's settings to look for a USB device before the hard disk.
	

What exactly is on the Stick?: Sugar + Fedora GNU/Linux. Taking advantage of Live USB technology, it's possible to store everything you need to run Sugar on a single, USB flash memory stick. Compressed file systems are used to save space, and persistent overlay files are used to save changes to the system and user's files. See our resources page to learn about different component configurations we are designing to offer the option to use virtual machines on existing computers to host Sugar from a portable Stick and save the Sugar Journal (the learner's work) and personal settings on the Stick for use at another workstation.
