This picture was a departure, both for star Buck Jones and director John Ford (in those days known as Jack Ford). Instead of a manly Western, the focus here is on simple character study, even if it does end with a flurry of action. Bim (Jones) is the town ne'er-do'well, but he proves to be of some worth when he befriends a scruffy 13-year-old youngster Bill (George Stone), who has been thrown off a freight train. Teacher Mary Bruce (Helen Ferguson) takes note of the affection Bim shows towards the boy and insists that Bill be sent to school. Bim is also an admirer of Mary's, but she already has a sweetheart, the shifty Harvey Cahill (William Buckly). Harvey, the cashier at the express office, has come up short at work, so he asks Mary to loan him the school memorial fund. She does, but the school committee asks for the money before Mary can replace it. To save her Bim gets the money back and makes it look like he took it in the first place. Then Bill is virtually held captive by a couple who believe he is the missing son of a rich family. Bim exposes a gang of robbers and becomes a hero. In addition he finds the real missing boy and his parents give him -- and Bill -- the ten thousand dollar reward.
