,gamerguy1,2009-12-03T17:43Z,"according to the real uploader,it's pal."
,Kalecgos,2009-12-04T10:56Z,Can anyone tell me wheter or not you can play the Scene it games without those special controllers?
,dinkyding,2009-12-04T12:21Z,"Yes, you can play it without the special controllers."
,siwrath,2009-12-05T20:22Z,"@Amsterdom

multi 5 means its supports 5 languages (english,french,german,spanish and italian)"
,Mangamaniac,2009-12-06T10:18Z,"This release is NOT multilangual! It has ENGLISH ONLY. All text and audio in the game is english.

The description [MULTI5] in the title is incorrect!"
,gamerguy1,2009-12-07T18:45Z,"as i said before,this information is according to the real uplader."
,pskrijgsman,2009-12-08T12:02Z,"the language in the game can be synchronized to your xbox language, ive seen this before. so multi5 can still be an option. "
,Kenste,2009-12-10T01:59Z,"This is ""Scene It Bright Lights Big Screen""
so the title is also wrong."
,Bazookatier,2009-12-22T09:20Z,"A quick heads up for any potential downloaders, this torrent is PAL only."
,MeatCleaverXXX,2010-03-26T14:40Z,Thanks forsaving me some bandwith bazookatier
