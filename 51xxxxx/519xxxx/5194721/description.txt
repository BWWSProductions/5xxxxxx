   LiquidSonics' Reverberate is a highly efficient convolution audio processor  
   offering  true  zero-latency  operation for  two  separate,  stereo impulse  
   responses.   
             
   Reverberate seeks to provide a richer and more dynamic sounding reverb from  
   impulse  responses  by  optionally  modulating  an  amalgamation  oftwo,  
   separately controllable true stereo IRs using an LFO. Further modulation is  
   possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus  
   provides a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype  paragraphic  
   equaliser is provided  with dual LFOs.  These features make  for a livelier  
   sound than typically  associated with some  convolution reverbs, at  a very  
   competitive price.
