[V],[HB],2009-12-08T11:53Z,"You mean serial is not working ? 
Or you are unable to recover the password of RAR file ?"
[T],XeroxAlto,2009-12-26T07:58Z,Serial worked for me but the password for the .rar I needed cracked did not work. 
,imunionjack,2010-02-24T05:30Z,So have any of the 77 seeds managed to find the right passwords? Does the prog work?
,maveri8,2010-05-10T19:04Z,"The software installs okay and a standalone text file is provided with the unlock key for unlimited use of the software. However, the ""recovery"" feature isn't as much magic as it is teadious. The process works by sequentially guessing the password to try to bust the code. There is no finess and it is quite slow for sophisticated passwords (ie a passwrd with more than 6 characters and a mixed with letters and numbers). 

Bottom line is that Ppl that password lock RARS are mean - plain and simply. "
