Abandoned as a baby, 12-year-old Hollis Woods (Jodelle Ferland) has been in more foster homes than she cares to remember. Edna Reilly (Alfre Woodard), her dedicated social worker, finally places Hollis with Josie Cahill (Sissy Spacek), a retired art teacher whose home is filled with her whimsical creations. Beatrice (Judith Ivey) is Josie's cousin and loyal friend.

Josie is delighted to discover that Hollis is also an artist and Hollis responds to Josie's warmth and openness. But she soon realizes that Josie is increasingly forgetful and confused by everyday tasks. Fearing that she'll be uprooted again, Hollis escapes with Josie to the summer cabin of her previous foster parents, the Regans. The Regan parents (James Tupper, Julie Ann Emery) had wanted to adopt Hollis, but when their young son (Ridge Canipe) was injured in an accident, things fell apart for Hollis yet again.

While Hollis and Josie celebrate a most unusual Christmas together at the cabin, Hollis worries about their uncertain future and whether she will ever have a real home.
