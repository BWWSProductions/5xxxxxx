IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
This time round it's the R5 of astro boy with complete english line audio.....no russian audio or subs needed.
The source itself we thought was poor for an R5,very dark,colours were messed up and it also seems to change
colouring throughout.
Anyway we did our best at tweaking it to our liking,take or leave
