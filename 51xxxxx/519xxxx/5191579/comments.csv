all available torrents are similar in quality (V-SCR like) and it seems unlikely there will be a PROPER dvd rip anytime soon."

Did not show video, I had to re-encode the movie before i could actually watch it, also the audio bit rate is 64kbps and not 128kbps. Considering the video encoding settings used,  and the actual picture quality, i seriously doubt its a dvdrip. But its watchable on a computer sized screen.

Thx for the movie."

,hi_potato,2009-12-07T08:43Z,"Se it! It's Nicolas Cages best movie.

Video: a lot like a vhs from early 90th. But it almost made the movie look better.

,FileError420,2009-12-13T00:59Z,Stop saying it's a remake. It just has the same title as the Ferrara movie and nothing whatsoever to do that one. (Although the 92 movie rocked)
,ragir,2009-12-13T01:57Z,"Thanks for the upload. 
Movie is shit compared to the original. Heard Herzog will do a remake of Taxi Driver with Brad Pitt next..."
,snowbirds,2009-12-13T10:01Z,"Uploader is a LIAR.

Not a DVD rip.

Crap video quality.  Highly pixelated, tons of visual noise.  Watchable, like a better quality cam, but I don't like cams, so I'm throwing this POS away.

Why do you keep lying like this extremezone?  Are you like, 13 years old, living in a suburban wasteland somewhere, and desperate for attention?  Grow up dude, you're better than this."

,PhilnLisa,2009-12-19T00:20Z,"LMFAO at everyone whinging about this. All you ever hear is people going on about films being ""typical hollywood bullshit"" This certainly isn't 'typical hollywood' Movie was good, little weird with the iguana dance scene lol among others...

Quality wasn't fantastic, but I watched via my PS3 on a 47"" LCD and it was more than acceptable 9.3/10

Audio fine

And lol about the mac comment.....I ran it fine on both 7 and leopard....use VLC for mac and MPC for windows....dumbarse!"
