[T],zombifuzz,2009-12-04T10:41Z,had no idea this was even going to be done.  thanks for the upload man.
,ryaneli,2009-12-04T18:43Z,"Hell breaks lose is short and its a great torrent but I see why none of these tracks made the album. maybe buffalo bill but the ""hook"" gets old quick. these songs should have been free on not released at all. That's why I will not be buying this. not because its a cheap way to get your album sales up or try to suck fans pockets dry. I'll pray to god that Relapse 2 is better than all of this. my 2 pennies!! 

its still something new!!

Thanks again for the torrent so early!!
