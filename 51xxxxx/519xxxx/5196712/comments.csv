@DracoSeed
-------------------------------------------------------
Try using a program called ""Crossover"" for mac this usually runs windows based programs on the mac os x platform.

link:
http://crossover-mac.en.softonic.com/mac
Torrent Link:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4971142/CrossOver_8_Pro

If that doesn't work you may need need to dual boot on your Mac.

Good Luck!

,nikos000,2012-02-10T19:33Z,"the anwser is not smart but it is simple and its working.. after downloading u have on the computer 5 extracting folders. Extract them to a place of your choice and then each one of them copy (use nero or whatever u like) to a new dvd. For example, the one of these folders is the intermediate lessons which needs one dvd and its contens would be 6 folder like AurData etc, and 5 files (one of them is autorun.exe). Nero asks me if i want to use multisession and anwser yes. So if u have some programs like virtual dvd u may not need all theese but i havent. Be careful not to copy the main folder that contains the above folders-files. i hope this is helpful.."
,nikos000,2012-02-10T21:46Z,"new data.. download this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6842742/MakBit.Virtual.CD.DVD.v1.9.5.WinAll.Incl.Keygen-MAZE      open it and then open the ""tellmemore8"" and will start without asking for cd"
