In this painfully funny and deeply moving film, Ben Bingham (Grant) has slipped into a fossilized middle-age, unlike his vibrant wife Amanda (Moss). When she finally leaves him, Ben refuses to get out of his pajamas until his popular 17 year-old son Justin (Pacar) takes over. He reinvents Benâ€™s â€œlookâ€ and pushes him out into the social scene. Before Ben knows what is happening, he is the most popular single man in townâ€¦ pursued by his nurse (Elfman), his trainer (Garofalo) and karaoke-singing twins. Things change when Justin falls in love for the first time and Ben is forced to refocus, recapture his humanity, his heart, and most importantly his wifeâ€¦
