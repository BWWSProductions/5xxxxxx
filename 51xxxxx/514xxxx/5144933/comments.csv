,Xerok80,2009-11-08T19:21Z,"Thank you for bringing these shows to us, 0vercast. Your time and efforts are very much appreciated. Today is Sunday, 08 Nov 2009 - I truly hope that you have not abandoned this project. I know it takes time, and that gratitude is not expressed often - but for many people (myself included) these torrents are the only source for this show and I sincerely hope you will continue. Sending best regards.....and seeding as always. =)"
