The DJ Hero Soundtrack is supposed to contain 91 songs. Unfortunately, I could only find 88, meaning there are 3 missing. The 3 missing ones are:

- Excuse Me Miss vs. Give It To Me Baby / Jay-Z ft. Pharrell Williams vs. Rick James
- I Heard It Through The Grapevine vs. Let's Dance / Marvin Gaye vs. David Bowie
- Rockit (Beat Juggle) / Herbie Hancock

If I find these 3, I'll upload them. All of the songs are ripped directly from the disc, except for Fight! Smash! Win! vs. Intergalactic.

Also, first upload, hope you like it ;)
