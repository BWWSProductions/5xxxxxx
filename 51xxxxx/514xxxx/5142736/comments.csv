,Carlos206,2009-11-01T10:27Z,"The other 2 you're supposedly missing from the 93 are the duplicates of the DJ Guitar Mix;

like this and these are the ones;

Jackson 5 - I Want You Back vs. Third Eye Blind - Semi-Charmed Life (DJ-Guitar mix)

Foreigner - Juke Box Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip ft. Murs - DJ Hero? (Produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip)
Foreigner - Juke Box Hero vs. DJ Z-Trip ft. Murs - DJ Hero (DJ-Guitar mix, produced and mixed by DJ Z-Trip)

I don't think there's any difference to the actual track between the normal DJ mix and the DJ Guitar mix. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Really you're only missing the three you listed.
"
,gaph2000,2009-11-01T17:39Z,"@ Carlos206 Haha, really? I saw those when going through the disc and was all ""WTF?"". The only difference is the guitar part is louder. No loss then. Thanks for the info!"
