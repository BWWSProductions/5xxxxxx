,dr-johan,2010-02-10T10:13Z,Why the Chinese filenames and strange zip files? Can anyone verify that this is the real thing?
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-23T18:06Z,Filenames are nothing to worry about...

,jetblast,2010-08-23T09:02Z,"I'm pleased to report that the movie is excellent quality, video and audio.  English subtitles are encoded (not embedded) in the movie.  No external subtitle files required.  They may be turned on and off using your media player's subtitle controls (if you want to practice your German).  I deleted all the files except the movie file itself and that has no effect on how the movie plays.  I don't read Chinese so I don't miss them."
