  From Recorded Books:

  The best-selling author of 20 novels, including Orchid Beach (RB# 95550), Heat (RB# 94320), and Dead in the Water (RB# 95250), Stuart Woods has earned a reputation as a master of legal and political suspense. In The Run he crafts a blistering race through a difficult presidential campaign. 

  Mississippi Senator Will Lee is in the spotlight. In strictest confidence, the Vice President has told Lee that he will not run for President. He urges Lee to announce his candidacy. But when the President is felled by a stroke, the Vice President takes over. Now, uncertain of the Vice Presidentâ€™s plans, Lee is in a perilous political position. Everywhere he turns, he sees layers of conspiracy building that threaten to derail his campaign. Stuart Woods creates a world of politics that echoes the fickle headlines of todayâ€™s papers. With Frank Mullerâ€™s gripping narration, The Run hurtles toward an explosive conclusion. Its twists and turns will keep you in suspense until the last vote is cast.
