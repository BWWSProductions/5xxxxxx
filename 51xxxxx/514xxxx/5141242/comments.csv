But I'm wondering if someone was able to play it with a GeForce 8600GT?

Thank's to anyone that can help me."
,ObsessionPC,2009-11-18T03:54Z,"Ok, finally done after 3 days :O .
But still great upload for a free game and lame seeders.

The language is ENGLISH and I had only a few errors during the installation.
Reading errors bad source etc. but with a couple hits on the retry button, it installed everything.
The game works but jee, it is so much console :(
I wish they would have put more effort into the PC version......

Thanks again, BTW dont forget to download the crack exe as well, it is not included in the DVD 1 and 2 torrents!"
,truthy,2009-11-21T22:27Z,"thx for sharing - I had no problems at all installing, patching or playing this game. It's the US-Version of the Game and installing/patching takes quite some time - even on a highend pc. here's what I did:

1. mount the 2 images and install (requires 25 GB! after patch 28,2 GB)
2. before patching: make sure you have at least 20 Gb of free discspace where your temporary folder is located - if not change it temporarily to another partition where you have that kind of space & reboot to apply the changes
3. install the v1.1 patch US-Version (copy to game dir & execute)
4. rename original exe and copy v1.1 crack Vitality (from GCW) to your game dir. I didn't use the one from Battery - Dupe."
,Hinka,2009-11-28T17:38Z,"Hey i'm kinda new to this so can someone make a detailed guide since i've done everything but it either says use the disc to or it enters the game but then exit and say star wars the force unleashed

,truthy,2009-12-01T23:34Z,patch it and use the crack frome gamecopyworld!
