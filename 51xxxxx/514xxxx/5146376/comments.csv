,smaurice2001,2010-01-09T17:41Z,I need that vista 64 bit version to intall windows 7 on my raid 0. tank you. you save my life.
,skalisko,2010-01-13T13:54Z,"Hi thethingy,

works great but have failed to activate. I waited a bit before running the activator, got sidetracked... should I have run it immediately? Any suggestions?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-13T16:11Z,"you can use the activator at any tim, run it as admin, select your brand, then wait for 3 windows to pop up, oem info, slic key, restart, restart and your done."
,m111111,2010-01-29T21:49Z,"Hey man, awesome upload I think this is exactly what i need.  However, I'm having trouble trying to figure out wether to get the x86 or the x64 one.  I have an Athlon AMD64 X2 processor.  Does that mean I need the 64 version?  Also, the reason i need this is because I messed my computer up bad and I think I deleted windows altogether, will this help me?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-30T08:04Z,"you can use either, 64 is best but if you have some older hardware and usb plugin things then you might not get drivers for them all, stuff made in the last 2 years you will, 64 needs a bit more memory to run, 2gb but can handle as much memory as you want, check your pc website to see what drivers they provide, any problems just use 32 x86."
,bookimam,2010-02-01T10:36Z,thank u you are best
,p0nci,2010-02-02T21:41Z,"Hi thehingy

[V],thethingy,2010-02-03T09:40Z,there is an iso tool in the description to mount the image or you can burn it to dvd
,p0nci,2010-02-03T19:36Z,"Yes I know ! I tried with PowerISO and Daemon ToolsLIte bute no one worked
I'll try burning it and run it from the bootscreen
Thnx again thethingy !!"
,Sah13,2010-02-20T11:07Z,I am currently running on a 32 bit Vista Home Premium.How do I know whether my computer is capable of 64bit?
,Sah13,2010-02-20T16:54Z,"Okay now that I know my system can run 64-bit Vista, I have a doubt. When i bought my laptop I got some softwares pre-installed. It says that after I upgrade my system I have to install my programs again. So would I have to install those pre-installed softwares again
Please I need a reply because if I upgrade my system and those programs (including Recovery Solution IV, PC Troubleshoot, Easy Network Manager etc.) are deleted then I am screwed"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-20T19:02Z,"yes you wont get the oem programes on this disc,, but you can usually download them seperatly from the manufacturers website,, the recovery is not an issue, the vista dvd has the repair/restore media in it and vista has backup and restore, whatever you got with the pc will be on the bay anyways,,, go for it,, did you know you can dual boot 32 & 64 bit systems?"
,Sah13,2010-02-22T08:55Z,"Whatcha mean by dual boot?
Anyways do you know how I can upgrade from Vista Home Premium 32-bit to Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit?Any torrent or anything?"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-25T20:43Z,"Sah13, dual boot means you have 32 and 64 bit installed, when you turn on your pc you get a choice of what one to use, google easybcd.

you can only upgrade 32 to 32 and 64 to 64"
,Sah13,2010-03-02T16:55Z,"Kool, but I'd rather have vista and win7 dual booted!
Btw, easybcd is for dual boot only right?Like I can choose which 1 I wanna go to?That would be awesome."
,ThaBrassah,2010-03-14T17:04Z,"If I have windows XP and then installing this vista, how do I get back to XP if I don't like vista?"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-14T18:33Z,"you dont go back to xp, its old and crap, you upgrade to windows 7 now as your pc runs vista it will run 7;

,ThaBrassah,2010-03-14T19:08Z,Ok. Are you sure all my settings and stuff on my computer don't get deleted if I upgrade first to vista and then to 7?
,ThaBrassah,2010-03-14T19:10Z,"Sorry for spamming comments but, am I going to mount the ISO file and then run activator?"
,ThaBrassah,2010-03-14T19:40Z,"When im choosing edition and pressing ""next"" it stops and I can't press anything. What should I do?"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-15T05:43Z,"run xp, then from xp put the vista dvd in/ or mount and run setup from xp to upgrade to keep all your stuff, there will be a little check box that you need to tick"
,LostAtSea,2010-07-13T13:20Z,"Thank you thethingy for good post is works well no problem, this 64 bits and x86 version postrnrnand much thank to seeders! :)"
,Jagraptor,2010-09-01T13:29Z,"Hello! I have a problem.. after downloading it... I used the virtual drive manager of PowerISO, But it says ""setup can not run on this version of the Operating System. To install Windows please try booting from the install Media"" :( I burned it using nero9 but didnt boot on my dvd drive after restart.. Help please... "
,Jagraptor,2010-09-01T15:08Z,Is this Bootable? Boot from DVD drive? I want a fresh install not an upgrade install... 
,dr_t_rex,2010-12-08T09:10Z,"This thethingy guy is legit, I've been following his torrents for quite a time and it seems s/he knows what s/he is doing.
I'm writing this for those who are skeptical...
cheers..."
,GCInt,2010-12-27T17:41Z,"The activator no longer seems to work. It was activated awhile ago, but now every time I run it and restart, windows asks to be activated again."
,forellana,2011-02-04T23:41Z,can someone seed please.
