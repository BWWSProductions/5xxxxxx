,Codeplayer,2010-11-15T01:33Z,"Actually, I found a perfect solution for easy registry changing. I forgot always which registry key it was and the name Morose is not quite easy to remember either :P. So: here is, what I recommend: Download the free task manager app, http://www.dotfred.net/TaskMgr.htm then associate your.reg files to that app (Menu, options, Create Regedit shortcut). Then create a .reg file with your notepad:
______________________________

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Morose Media\WMWifiRouter\License]
""StartDate""=-
_______________________________

Copy the file to your WM device to folder Windows\Start Menu\Programs Name the file WMWifiRG.reg, then it is located next to the app. 

Now, when you have your licence expired, you can click and have a new trial period with no hassle.

I recommend to buy the product, after you have evaluated it, if you like it so much, that you need a second trial period :)"
