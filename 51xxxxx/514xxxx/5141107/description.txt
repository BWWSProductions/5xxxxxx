Perhaps no other pianist is so indelibly linked to one composer's music than Artur Rubinstein is to the works of Chopin. One might think of Glenn Gould and Bach, but even the renowned Canadian virtuoso's recordings of JS Bach are not held in such high esteem as Rubinstein's Chopin catalogue. 

Rubinstein has such an affinity for this music, and performs the works with such a master's touch, that the listener immediately developes an especially affectionate bond with this marvellous 11-cd set from RCA Victor.

These performances are some of the absolutely great treasures in the history of recorded music. They have such a wide appeal that they instantly become a must have.

Highly recommended and definitely not to be missed! 




Enjoy and Seed!!
