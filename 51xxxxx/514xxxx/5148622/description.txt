Hi there..

This is one of the Icons of the metal-age, a true veteran of waiting in the shadow of the Puppet Master, sharing his story with us in a way that makes at least me pity him, because the pictures he chooses to tell his story are just heartbreaking in all their desperation and the darkness revealed.
A must for any follower of the darker paths.
And a warning sign for those who are not.
Don't miss this..

Unless you are faint at heart, because this is quite heavy stuff.. But writing this will probably only attract more to download it.. And that wasn't my intension. I'm warning you..

"Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost."
