,HolliganX,2010-01-18T18:49Z,"Hey dude, you forgot to mention that as soon as the program finishes the installation it will automatically update, so the ?don?t let it update? is not quite a choice? Please unplug the internet cable guys! "
,Danz01,2010-01-26T22:04Z,"Thanks KK, its a good application, worked on my Windows 7."
,mack1886,2010-02-01T15:56Z,"Fast download and clean install!  What a fantastic supplement to my AV Security Suite and CCleaner ? this caught all of those annoying little ?Handlers? that come up on the AutoPlay option for the uninstalled software that was suggested. After running my tried-and-true registry cleaner that I have been using for the past 4 years, this found 541 files and registry entries that needed scrubbing.  Thank you so much, K-Kid!  I feel like I have my old friend back in fully functioning order, WITHOUT breaking the bank!  Keep up the great work ? this will keep seeding on my part to 10.000 ratio."

,MrPresident3,2010-07-25T10:19Z,I was having some serious registry errors and this fixed them no problem. Install was a breeze. I joined the site to add this comment because I am so happy with how this worked for me. I'm new to torrenting and this might be the easiest program I've used yet.
