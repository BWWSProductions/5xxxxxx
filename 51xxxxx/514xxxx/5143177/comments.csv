,DVS777,2009-11-12T21:28Z,A loader can u answer any of these fucking ?'s lookin' 4 a good copy that will pass abgx360 1.0.2.........Is this stealthed with the right video partition??????????
,DVS777,2009-11-12T21:29Z,"By the way,RF=region free 4 those who don't know......"
,pacman0864,2009-11-15T13:59Z,"Hopefully this clears up some confusion:

This is not a proper rip, because it does not contain wave 4. If you play it on xbox live without fixing it, you will probably get banned. In order to fix it, just download abgx360 1.0.2 and the wave 4 data. Then just autofix it. 

The game is english.

Modern Warfare 2 is a region free game, so you you don't have to worry about where u bought your 360.

Recommend you use iXtreme 1.61 FW, as this has been fixed to properly recognize wave 4 data.

After autofixing with abgx360, I burnt it, and played through the 1st level, and all seems to be working fine. I don't have xbox live, so i can't test that."
,Van-Halo-Tupac,2009-11-15T15:03Z,"How did you get to patch it with level 4??? All is see in agbx is level 3 and it keeps failing...help me out please!

Could anyone help me on how to do this please? i have toast, mac the ripper, and i can download anything else i need. please help"
,lozp,2010-01-18T12:10Z,"frfreemister:
hi, quite easy to burn on mac, first of all, if the file is composed of 70 odd RAR files, then donload unrarx , then decompress files so you obtain 1 ISO file, then you wan to use  i burn 360 ( google it ) then use verbatim dvd 8.5GB, and it's pretty much drag and drop.

To play this game, i am not sure if it will work without activat iso disc, fo this , you may hyave to download activate iso disc (google that too )"

,frfreemister,2010-01-20T17:41Z,"lozp, thanks for all the great help, but im not sure how to turn the RAR files into one ISO file using UnrarX. It would be great if you could walk me through this. Thanks :)"
,lookwhoshere_wow,2010-01-23T13:27Z,activate disc is needed for 1.6 ..... Don't think act disc is needed for 1.61 users .....

Moreover, I never failed at burning a game but this one won't start on my fw 1.61
Therefore, you should avoid to download"
