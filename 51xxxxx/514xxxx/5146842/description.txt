It's the night before Christmas when toy salesman Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) finds himself in an awkward predicament. The real Santa Claus has fallen off his roof and his "emergency card" instructs Scott to take his place. But by putting on the Santa suit, Scott unknowingly accepts all the responsibilities of the rosy-cheeked legend. With his young son by his side, Scott stars a comical new life of weight gain, beard growth, narrow chimneys and elves with attitude!
