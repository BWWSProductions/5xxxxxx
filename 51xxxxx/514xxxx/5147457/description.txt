Anavasi has been at the forefront of developments in Greek cartography since the publication of its first map in 1997.
It remains the only Greek cartographic company to use scientific methods for the collection of field data and map composition, using GPS and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the organization and processing of data in over 100 thematic levels and creating databases on a national scale.

Despite the changes in technology, the spirit of Anavasi remains firmly rooted in the mountains and fellow hikers the world over will find on our maps not only a precise record of footpaths but also useful information on the waymarking and condition of the paths.
