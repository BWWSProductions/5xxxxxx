Thanks for the upload"
,Fimp_Erik,2009-12-10T20:02Z,quality is pretty ok for so small files but i cant see any reason having this high resolution with so high compression. i think a DVDrip would look better in this file size. a 720p movie should be AT LEAST 1GB/hour to look good.

Better from thinking is checking. Then you will know why high resolution is combined with high commpression :)"
