,knee69,2009-11-09T09:07Z,"Hi Verifire, 

is this version 7 or 8 of Bibleworks. The serial is the same for a version that has been out since 2006

/a truthseeker"
[T],verifire,2009-11-12T12:07Z,@knee69: Eehrr.. The picture..? On top of the page..? Says.. 7? Maybe you shouldn't be so fast while you're skimming pages to get the truth about stuff. Then we'd have spared us these comments too.. :-)
,sheenayanis,2009-11-13T04:29Z,"This is nice upload...
alternatively you can go to...
http://www.e-sword.net/downloads.html
to those who want a simple but small size of PC Bible to have directly from the source..
to VERIFIRE, thanks for sharing it!"
,sheenayanis,2009-11-13T04:40Z,"""That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death"" Php 3:10  "
[T],verifire,2009-11-14T14:44Z,"@sheenayanis: Yeah that thing is a very limited study.thing, but seems to strongly propagate the NIV and it's revised versions.

This upload, the BibleWorks, can be said to differentiate in so many aspects that I'd never point people to the ""Bible-light"" page you're referring to as an alternative .

PS: With this comment, I guess now you've got the chance to let the death of Christ go over your life, so you can know the power of His resurrection.. :-)

Love, V."
,pirate_bit,2009-11-21T10:55Z,What version is this ?
[T],verifire,2009-11-28T11:54Z,..number 7... Like it says in comment two where I answer the same question from commentator number one.. :-)
[T],verifire,2009-12-07T01:22Z,"I see someone has had a ""great time"" giving this upload some ""minus"" quality-points.

Rubbish! It's the full version of the program with access to all features!

So ""poor quality"" must be because it doesn't include ""the Baphomet Codex"" or ""the Black Books of Satan"", or something..

,jimk770i,2010-02-19T22:44Z,"Thanks a lot for this wonderful resource...
God Bless!"
,montgoja,2010-04-15T01:06Z,"Verifire - 
I just installed the program - after installation, my computer suddenly started to run updates and required about three restarts, then the last time I restarted, my hard drive now won't boot.  I tried to access my hard drive from a Linux Live disc, and I'm getting errors that it won't mount because ""mount exited with exit code 12: Failed to read Last sector (488391226): Invalid argument)

The error message is telling me that either the partition table is corrupt or the NTFS boot sector is corrupt, as the HD suddenly doesn't seem to have an NTFS.

I'm hoping it wasn't this program - any ideas?"
,montgoja,2010-04-15T01:36Z,"On further review, disregard that last comment.  My computer suddenly decided to boot again... though it is odd - I have no desktop icons, and the program is telling me it can't create the BW fonts, despite the fact that I had installed them before ever installing this program.  Perhaps there are some compatibility issues w/ Windows 7"
,sdeloney,2010-06-16T18:02Z,wait... this doesn't have the Black Books of Satan?
,sdeloney,2010-06-18T23:44Z,"by info file, do you mean where it asks you for one's name, company, and serial number and such?"
,sdeloney,2010-06-19T00:24Z,"oh sorry, you we're refering to the text file. I'm having issues unlocking the modules. I put the number in and it tells me its invalid. Is there a separate serial number?"
,sdeloney,2010-06-19T02:08Z,"meh, okay... narrowed the problem to accessing the Resource- Text Criticism - Comfort and Barrett Greek Mss. 
Everything else works fine. 
When I click on this resource I get a ""The resource file c:\program files (x86)\bibleworks7\databases\cb.chm is not unlocked. You can unlock it by choosing the option ""Unlock Database from the Main window FILE Menu.""

I choose this option and then get a ""BibleWorks has encountered a severe error and cannot continue""
And ideas?"
[T],verifire,2010-06-25T16:04Z,"@montgoja: Yes, you must run it under compatibilitymode for Vista. [Rightclick on .exe and coose under properties.

@sdloney: No it doesn't have the black Books of satan or the Baphomet Codex. For that, register at

http://www.theoccult.bz

[If they're open for registrations. If so; 

""Fools rush in where angels fear to tread""

And as for your problem; try disabling the firewall for the program. Serial unlocks all modules. Might even unlock the gates of heaven if you're sincere. That's not my decision. If I could, I would.

Peace.
