Hi there..

Firstly I'd like to tell you about a new Christian site:
 
http://www.blazefire.org/

Registrations are open for a while. Safe, no ads, pure, non-denominational site.

Now this upload.
Hundreds of texts in here.. Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, English, on and on.. you name it..
Reference, translations of Greek and Hebrew words, just hold you mouse over the word and it'll display the translated variants of the word.. You can compare texts of your choice, search the selected texts for where a particular word is used, you can extract as txt-files any version..
For those who'll want to explore the texts of the Scripture and the Apocrypha, this is the ultimate tool.

Just (double?)click on the finished image-file, and insert a empty DVDR in your burner, and it'll mount and burn on any program you've assigned your computer for such tasks (Nero, Magic-ISO and so on..)
Then install and apply the evaluation number in the info-file to every part of the program to unlock every book and text and function. The time you need and can use for evaluation and use of this program is unlimited.

Minimum System requirements:

   * WindowsÂ® 98/Me/NT/2000/XP/Vista
   * Internet ExplorerÂ® version 6, SP1
   * Minimum of 64 MB RAM
   * Minimum of 600 MB to a maximum of 5.5 GB hard drive space
   * 1024x768 screen for videos
   * Sound card for some features
   * DVD drive

Love from Verifire.
