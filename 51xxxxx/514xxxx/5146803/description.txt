Here is the complete version of the 2005 Glyndebourne Festival production of Giulio Cesare in Egitto.  Considered the finest opera composed by George Frederick Handel and possibly the finest work in the whole genre of opera seria, it follows the arrival of Julius Caesar in Egypt, his conflicts with the treacherous pharaoh Ptolemy and his liaison with the latter's sister Cleopatra, in a production that updates the story to the 19th century with the British army backing Caesar.  This is the full three-disc version including the extras and cast interviews.  AVI format.
