Ten mile bank is a welcome return by Sunscreem at their best.

Ten mile bank is a place in the fens of Norfolk southern England, the only place that answers to that name on google earth. I've been under the impression that Sunscreem among others have performed raves there or near to, but can't for the life of me remember where or how I heard/read this. If you know the significance of this please share it with us.
