,Zakafein,2009-11-03T14:06Z,hmmm no comments any1? is it a good game? can't seem to find it on gamespot... and the btarena doesnt give a rating
,Scabass,2009-11-03T19:03Z,"Yeah I like this game a lot.

I have played about 20 hours so far.

The only problem I have encountered so far,is that sometimes you have to babysit your group when moving them long distances in the woods,sometimes one of them can get stuck in a tree,a rock or something,and you will have to go back and highlight them and make them move individually to get them 'unstuck'.

Also,on one of the spells,the writing is in Russian,so I have no idea really what it does."

Just found that out recently."

It must be near the end of the game , however when you go near the Custodian and the dialog is supposed to start i get game crash and this error : FDOCUME~1AndreasLOCALS~1Temp2d6c_appcompat.txt. i dont know if its my pc or if its the game itself causing this..."
