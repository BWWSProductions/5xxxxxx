,ex_pat3,2009-12-08T15:37Z,"I?m pretty sure this keygen has a Trojan, and *not* because some AV software reports it is malware.

I did get a Trojan this morning after using the keygen for another download of VMWare but also installed some other software at the same time. 

See http://spywarefiles.prevx.com/RREFGF1060/JAVAWL.EXE.html. 
The trojan throws up this popup:
Title: Microsoft Internet Explorer 
Msg: Error: (login): 0x10e0 The operator or administrator has refused the request

The location of the exe file varies according to the OS. Mine is XP 64 bit and it was in \windows\SYSWOW64. On 32 bit systems, it will be in \windows\system32. The name is invariably the name of a valid exe process with an 'l' added at the end, i.e, javawl.exe, not javaw.exe. 

Because I was installing a lot of other software this morning I cannot be absolutely sure this keygen was the source, but will test some more and post again soon. I'm pretty suspicious though, as I found another reference to it spreading through a VMWare keygen. If I am wrong, so be it, and apologies - better safe than sorry.

BTW, the serial it generated _was_ valid. Anyway, I have learned my lesson ? run keygens or anything suspect in sandboxie!

One other thing ? No AV I tried, including my resident AVG and an updated Malwarebytes found either the source, or the active exe file. "
,ex_pat3,2009-12-09T14:16Z,It looks like the Trojan was from some other software - sorry for the confusion.
