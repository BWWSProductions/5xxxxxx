Yeah, here it is H2O - Just add water Season 2 Volume 2.

Dunno if the volume 2 refers to S2 or the whole series in general, but owel.

Encorded @ 1300kps using xvid on handbrake, frame: 720x754 @ 25fps (from PAL-native). Blame uso for the bitrate, he told me to use it. I would use x264, but he wanted xvid "for consistency" >:3

This series is about a bunch of girls who can turn into mermaids, and their mis/adventures in Australia. My rental classifies it as a family flick, i'd say girl flick (but thenagain, i liek cardcaptor/sakura), and uso as mahoshojo (majical girl). inb4: bikinis are universal - nerefir :P

Originally ripped for some frends (uso, nere, drf, (EDIT: Amotan) and mitch), you can prolly find them on #the-tomodachi or #pokemon-originals on irc.hoshinet.org

EDIT2: Upped to TPB cuz Demonoid is down =
