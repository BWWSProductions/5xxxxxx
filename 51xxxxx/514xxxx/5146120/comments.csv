,Igneous_X4,2010-08-30T12:35Z,"Hey, Kitlope. Thanks for this torrent, and for ripping these to FLAC properly (with the EAC logs and cue sheets). Downloading The Downward Spiral as we speak...


I do partially agree with Ardroth, though. Personally, if I couldn't obtain perfect rips from some of my tracks, I wouldn't upload them. Not a huge deal, though. Those of us who know what to look for simply need to look elsewhere.


Kudos!"
,retrogoddfather,2011-04-08T22:32Z,"i can't beleive some people here would actually bitch about imperfect rips.. the difference between flac and other formats is one thing, its huge, but the difference between  100% and 98% or something like that in EAC is not audible. and can almost gaurauntee that no one could ever find the difference without the original tracks from the studio, and multispectral analasys tools. this is a great torrent, i downloaded the previous version, with every work nin ever did, sad to see it go, and i will try to seed that one soon. thanks kitlope"
,Krustoph,2011-04-21T09:10Z,"Thanks for this, I already have a complete NIN Discog but cant pass up FLAC!

Cheers!"
