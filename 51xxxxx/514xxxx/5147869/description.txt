Hardcore pioneer producer DJ Promo always had his experimental
side with Rude Awakening. Now he's up to something different and
this is the result. With respected dutch vocalists he takes his
sound to a new level! Hiphop with a hardcore touch to it.

This music has been released at the Amsterdam Dance Event as
promotional copy. The music will probably be only sold on ITunes,
making this quite a collector's item.
