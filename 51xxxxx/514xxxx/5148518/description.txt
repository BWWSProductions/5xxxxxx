Magazine are an English post-punk group active between 1977 and 1981.Their debut single, "Shot By Both Sides", is now acknowledged as a classic and their debut album, Real Life, is still widely admired as one of the greatest albums of all time.The band was formed by Howard Devoto after leaving punk band Buzzcocks in early 1977, deciding to create a more experimental and less punk band who later influenced many artists
                                                                                                                                                                          
This is the offical live recording of the Buzzcocks splinter group headed by Howard Devoto.

Recorded live in 1980, PLAY presents the pioneering U.K. post-punk act Magazine performing in Melbourne, Australia. Former Buzzcock Howard Devoto leads his ensemble through a set that primarily draws on REAL LIFE ('78) and THE CORRECT USE OF SOAP ('80), including fierce art-rock classics such as "The Light Pours Out of Me" and "A Song From Under the Floorboards." Like its peers Wire, the group doesn't disappoint in concert, with Barry Adamson (later of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) providing a potent bass rumble and temporary guitarist Robin Simon (Ultravox) applying dynamic six-string flourishes. Though PLAY is primarily geared towards Magazine completists, it should easily appeal to many other post-punk diehards.
