,svimla,2009-11-04T13:57Z,"Hi
On sesong1 it was: 
Subtitles: Dutch, English, French, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Portugese, Swedish, Arabic, English for the hearing Impaired

why not the same subs here?"
,Clairwil,2009-11-04T15:52Z,These were al the subtitles that were included on the DVD's. The reason has probably something to do with distribution.
,Rincewind69,2009-11-07T13:04Z,"I on the other hand want to than you for great uploads!

Thanks for the upload, but it seems that only one or none of the ISO work, i burn with IMGburn and for the 2nd season only burned the 2nd part 1st part would say Tracking Servo Failure and the file is not the right format.. I don't know if it got messed up or what.. 

Also if you could upload the rest of the seasons except season 7 that would be nice.. Once again great torrent, beside having that problem

At least that's what my ps3 says.  I wish uploader or someone else had mentioned this and saved me from downloading 9gigs!"
,chouette57,2010-04-19T04:41Z,What? This is PAL? Can someone confirm this please?
