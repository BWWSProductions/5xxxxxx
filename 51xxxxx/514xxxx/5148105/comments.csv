btw...Looks like I blew a shot at VIP status, due to a foul mouth.  :("

All keys for ESET get blacklisted very soon, so it's a waste of time looking for keys all the time."
[T],jmb2012,2009-11-05T20:00Z,"I've been using the key sites for months now, so are half a dozen or so people I know. No problem ever getting a key that works, usually on first try.

I'll download this just to help seed.

,darkenedsoul,2009-11-08T17:46Z,"I re-installed my nod32 smart security v4, the crack installed said update manually had no clue what that means lol. Restart my pc try to update and it wants a user + pass, so I had to put in my old trial user/pass and it has like 5 days left and whenever I restart it just says expires on 11/15/09.
I know there was a version where it would just be a 31 day trial but I can't seem to find that, any ideas?"

For your information: 99,99% of the people, incl. TPB, does not rely on free online av scanners simply becuase they're unreliable and generate too many fake results and false positives. Actually they're plain crap.

For reporting serious av scan results and suspicious torrents: http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29"
,MaxMalone,2009-11-09T12:50Z,hi iam looking for Hitman pro 3.5 worlds fastest scanner any chance of getting this?
[T],jmb2012,2009-11-15T00:11Z,"@RobbingHood

I rely on VirusTotal results!
Why should'nt I? It scans with every Anti-Virus scanner out there. 

Is there something I don't know? I use ESET on my PC to scan before I upload, and use Virus-Total as a extra pre-caution.

You a KAV guy are'nt you?"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-17T02:24Z,"@jmb2012 

You're awareness is appreciated, but just like you suggested indeed you're missing a lot. At the forum you could learn more about it, and that's where such issue belong.

It's not the first time that you're questioning (my) torrents but it would be preferred to report things where it should be instead of confusing the society.


BTW: I'm not a KAV guy, as you may read in the torrent description:

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


There's also Sandboxie to test things. Funny thing is that all my av scan reports never are the same as with free online scanners. And that's no surprise, cause you can't get the same thing for free while there are paid versions. Free online av scanners generate may more fake warnings and false positive because they're basicly using free and/or outdated av signatures. "

,gurumarkb,2011-06-17T00:51Z,"Good news all!
I just installed Eset Smart Security 4.0.437 in Windows 7 Pro SP1 64-bit, disabled self-defence, restarted Win 7, temporaily disabled NOD32 real time protection to prevent it from quarantining the TrialReset EXE (as NOD32 will so keep the RAR file handy), ran the TrialRest, and it said it was successful.  I then ran the NOD32  manual update, got timed out, kept trying (this is normal Eset behavior), got a link into the update server, it downloaded and installed all updated, and all is perfect.   Great job RH!

Anyone who says the RH puts up files that don't work are full of sh!t.  I'm still running NOD32 on XP with RH's Trial reset from January 2007 and (as I left the watermark on) it still today says I have 30 days left on my trial Nod32 v4.   I started in 2007 with NOD32 v3, updated to v4 when it came out, and the RH supplied trial reset v2.3 still works perfectly.  Keep up the great work RH! "
