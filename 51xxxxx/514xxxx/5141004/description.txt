This bootleg is from various audience sources and itÂ´s avideos rip from GinÃ¡sio of Mineirinho, Belo Horizonte, in Brazil. Despite of some variation of quality from one song to another, itÂ´s a good bootleg to have, because of a superb Iron Maiden gig that the guys gave to Belo Horizonte Fans. Songs start abruptly and some have their introducing cut by the way. Wasted Years is cut in the final. Before Rime of the Ancient Mariner Bruce rad some note from the fans asking them to play Alexander the Great, and then Bruce did the job himself in a funny way. The audience was insane that night and made the atmosphere really good to the band give a superb show. Hope you enjoy it. The quality i give is from 6 to 8/10 whit some variation in some songs.
