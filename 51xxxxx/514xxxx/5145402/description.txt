  From Recorded Books:

  Walter Satterthwait has written more than a dozen novels, including Miss Lizzie (RB# 96032) and Escapade (RB# 95681). His historical mysteries have received universally high praise for the elegant details that color each chapter. The New York Times Book Review calls his works "witty, pen-in-cheek" adventures. 

  It is 1882. Oscar Wilde tours the U.S., delivering lectures on art and literature. In each city where he appears, a woman is murdered, dismembered, and flayed. Six people are traveling in Wildeâ€™s entourage. Could the monstrous killer be one of them? As a down-on-his-luck lawman investigates, he is pulled into the flamboyant world of the outspoken writer. Wilde West is a remarkable mystery, filled with quips that could easily have flowed from Wildeâ€™s pen. Each character, from luscious heiresses to shadowy servants, is fully realized. And Wildeâ€™s comments on the American West are priceless, especially as voiced by Audie Award-winning narrator Frank Muller.
