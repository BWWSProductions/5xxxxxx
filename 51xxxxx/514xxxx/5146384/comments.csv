,christlebot,2009-11-04T01:35Z,Does anyone know where to find the first 2 Stieg Larsson books in English audio?
,neshaminy,2009-11-04T20:09Z,Does not appear to be complete.  The files in Section 4 are either incorrectly numbered or may be missing. 4-21 thru 9-21 are there but where are 1-21 thru 3-21 and 10-21 thru 21-21?
,groovydan,2009-11-05T06:40Z,"it wont play, I extracted and I can see 21 mp3 files but nothing, anyone?"
,gasman364,2009-12-09T03:23Z,"Um, is this fake? Amazon says the book isn't due out until May 2010 . . . "
,scottielass,2010-03-17T13:42Z,It's only in North America that it's not yet available so there's no reason to think this is a fake.
,TunAung,2010-04-22T08:20Z,It is out and one of my friend is reading it right now!
,rzasthole,2010-04-25T22:15Z,could anyone confirm if this is complete?

,mmarker2001,2010-07-18T05:07Z,I need to correct myself - I just looked at my files and the numbering of the files makes my player skip 2-21 thru 9-21. It played 1-21 and then 10-21 - I\'m re-numbering them to fix this.
