,teohhanhui,2009-12-13T16:03Z,bg_song19.jpg is corrupted.
,SergeantSpoon,2009-12-24T22:48Z,Too bad she isn't fearless against Kanye West ^^
,budlazz,2010-01-24T23:01Z,"She was very fearless against that idiot... She showed her class with a subtle smile and calmness... So you sound as ignorant as he was.  Anyone who actually saw this rude disruption, know who was the class act.  I hats off to TS any day.  The other one who made a total idiot of himself.   hahahahahaha"
,TowerMac,2010-02-09T20:51Z,"sorry budlazz Taylor Swift is a load of bollocks, Kanye is right....... should of been Beyonce. Let's be serious...... Taylor over Beyonce??? Purleeese!"
[V],jainmehul,2010-02-12T08:02Z,why do u seed people JB59 have just downloaded this from aizmusik.com 
,RedFalcon103,2010-02-19T02:14Z,Taylor Swift is hotter than that ugly hoe beyonce. The reason he didnt say anything to Kanye is because shes scare of that monkey.hahahaha
,knockonheavensdoor92,2010-02-27T09:31Z,"Taylor Swift is Good
But Beyonce Is Way Better
So There is no comparison"
,merc_ury,2010-03-01T13:48Z,"That entire thing was staged!  Stop arguing, you've been duped.  Explain how security just allows him to walk across that long stage and take her mic unless it was a setup.  
And go figure, everyone has a new CD out - so lets surround ourselves with controversy. 
Don't let yourself be fooled people."
,laurstig,2010-03-11T09:28Z,Great Album!!
,daveydudely,2010-03-12T04:43Z,"How can anybody listen to this shit on purpose?  

Unfuckingbelievable."
,RickDart,2010-05-31T06:19Z,"Beyonce's video may be better than Taylor's, but what kanye did was down right stupid. Taylor won best female video and Beyonce won VIDEO OF THE YEAR. What u say to that, kanye, u asshole??"
,messi_10,2010-06-17T06:13Z,"Maybe Talylor hasn't achieved as much as Beyonce, but don't forget how young she is. And in my opinion, she has enough talent to easily outshine a number of 'singers' of her generation, such as Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato."
,littlemissmusic,2010-06-21T19:04Z,"messi_10, RickDart & knockonheavensdoor92 your all right :) well i think so anyway :L"
,chug28,2010-06-22T11:02Z,i want to fuck you taylor
,LynnPsycho,2010-07-06T21:58Z,"What the hell? You said Justin Bieber is a talented? Hell no! He can't sing well! But he can play his damn guitar and dance a little. He sounds like a girl. He looks like a girl. PROBABLY he is a GIRL. hahahahaha. How come a million girls love him? What's so special about him? In my opinion, his songs are not that amazing but just okay for me."
,limited305,2010-08-19T04:30Z,This girl is amazing.
,dyslexicdesktop,2010-09-01T01:48Z,If you wanna talk controversy and bullshit. Take this shit to a damn celeb forum. This place is for sharing files. Not bullshit. Thanks
,salami777,2010-09-09T09:14Z,Thanks for sharing!!
[V],jainmehul,2010-10-25T14:27Z,"@RedFalcon103 :-

Highly Racist Comment...Plz Keep That Away From TPB"
,sanwh,2011-02-17T13:14Z,"Nice torrent but if you want i uploaded 2 great unreleased tracks
-you dont have to call
-permanent marker
 :D"
,HAHAlowlow,2011-04-07T16:12Z,"Look, this is most definitely NOT JB59's fault, but in 10 years of downloading torrents i have never received a warning from AOL about the RIAA complaining about me infringing on copy right protections by downloading torrents on a peer-to-peer program.........and this is the only CD i've downloaded via a torrent, outside of another taylor album[which im going to post this comment on too], in weeks!
So, i'm warning everyone that the likelyhood that the RIAA [Recording Industry Associate of America] is monitoring this torrent, is very-high.
Does that mean they'll email you too? No, they might skip you. But then again, they might not. And if you're on a isp with a fixed IP, and your isp has your real contact info, you might be in danger of the RIAA getting your contact info, and your ISP suspending your account.


But of course, i've learned my lesson and will never ever ever download a torrent again! *thumbs up?!* =D"
,krazeeeyezkilla,2011-07-14T14:34Z,"HAHAlowlow speaks the truth. I was warned because of this torrent and Adele. They're out for blood. I'll never understand why we can't share the same album on here that we can all drive over to the library and make of copy of, record it off the radio or the 50 other ways we could get an album. When you cut the supply. People find another source.

But I can't handle the heat so I'm getting out of the kitchen. I wish you all the best!"
,sebblewich,2011-09-04T08:15Z,"daveydudeley,
you should keep silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.

you're in a rut and you think you're in a groove. unfucking beliveable!"
