"I Just Call You Mine" is the title of a song written by Jess Cates, Ty Lacy, Dennis Matkosky and recorded by American country artist Martina McBride. It was released in May 2009 as the second single from her album, Shine.

McBride performed the song on July 15, 2009 on NBC's Today when the couple got married during the show's 10th annual "Today Throws a Wedding" promotion. She also performed the song live on ABC's The Bachelorette on May 25, 2009.

A music video, which was filmed in downtown Nashville and directed by Theresa Wingert, premiered on CMT on June 15, 2009.

In the video, McBride is shown standing in the dark with a single light behind her. As the video progresses, she is shown standing with many colored and white lights strung on wires in the background and in front of her, with tall buildings beyond them. Mixed with these are black-and-white scenes of different couples; a young couple are shown running on the beach, an elderly couple sitting on a bench together, and one woman is shown embracing her husband returning from war (among others). Some of the footage of the couples showcases different time periods, often appearing grainy and with the couples dressed to mirror fashion from the earlier 20th century, in addition to couples of today's time.

The video debuted at #20 on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown for the week of June 26, 2009.

"I Just Call You Mine" debuted at #59 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts several weeks prior to its release as a single, before falling off. After its official release, it returned to the charts at #55. It entered the Top 40 after eight weeks on the chart. In August 2009, it made its debut on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at #97.

Shine is the tenth studio album from American country music singer Martina McBride. It was released on March 24, 2009 (see 2009 in country music) through RCA Records Nashville. "Ride", the album's lead-off single, was released in late 2008 and peaked at #11 on the U.S. Billboard country charts. McBride co-produced the album with Dann Huff.

In November 2009, McBride will embark on the Shine All Night Tour in support of the album.
