Seeding this for benefit of all!

Wonderfull tactical operation and utilization. Flawless.

Thank you Lord Maldoror

Overview:

This is a gameplay video showing how unorthodox tactics evolve as capital combat scales up in New Eden. It is the sequel to Clarion Call - Triage Special though doesn't require you to have seen that video. Triage is involved, though much of the time is taken up with the namesake of the video, Pantheon.

Above all, at a time when many companies seem hellbent on destroying PC gaming (read: IW and dedicated servers), this is a video about proper emergent sandbox gameplay (and drunk/drugged people being handed Biggles goggles and forced into a complicated plan).



Narration:

Once more the lovely Princess Aricia provides the narration track.

Enjoy and SEED Please!
