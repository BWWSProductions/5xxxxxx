8 Pete Tong (Essential Selection) Radio 1 shows from 2006, originally broadcast on Fridays from 6-9pm or 7-9pm.

Because large hard drives used to be expensive, most of these recordings were made in mono. The bit rate is decent though - 96kbps mono is roughly equivalent to 160kbps joint stereo - and unless the lack of stereophony puts you off, you should be satisfied with the sound quality.

Welcome to the weekend!
