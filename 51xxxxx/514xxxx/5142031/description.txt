A one-man intrumental metal act that seriously needs attention. The tracks here are amazing, and just as amazingly mastered. Song titles are humorously explicit. Among other "information" on their myspace,

"Vomitron is a collection of metal anthems that do not have lyrics, but are so incredibly profound that they actually transfer telepathic messages while you listen. Whereas with Judas Priest you had to get the record, play it backwards, and try to decipher the words, all ya do with these tunes is pop in the CD and your ritual sacrifice instructions will be psychokinetically transferred."
