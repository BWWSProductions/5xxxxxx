  From Recorded Books:

  Since he first received the Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1966, author Ross Thomas has written a steady stream of best-sellers, including his popular WuDu, Ltd. mystery series. An artisan of the sophisticated novel of high-level crime, Thomas blends masterful storytelling, inventive plotting and quirky-but-recognizable characters to create a wryly entertaining brand crime novel. 

  Cashiered army major Edd â€œTwodeesâ€ Partain has been hired by a political rainmaker, Millicent Altford, to help retrieve the $1.2 million missing from her secret stash. Soon he finds himself hip-deep in former friends and enemiesâ€”with no way of telling which is deadlier.
