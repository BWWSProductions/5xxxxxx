Widely considered the most influential of all silent films, Metropolis has stood the test of time and may be more popular now than ever, and this after both a dismal showing in the 1927 premiere and a series of butchering edits over the years that have destroyed large sections of filmâ€™s original cut. While the original version of Metropolis is lost forever, The Murnua Foundation oversaw a restoration of Metropolis that was released on DVD in 2002, restoring the original version as much as possible. This includes the original orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz. Summaries are interjected throughout the film to provide the missing story elements for scenes which have decayed or been lost.
