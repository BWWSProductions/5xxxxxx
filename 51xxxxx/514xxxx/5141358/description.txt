Charles Haviland reports from Nepal on the affect of war on one family.

A monarchy throughout most of its history, Nepal was ruled by the Shah dynasty of kings from 1768  when Nepal was unified to become one state.

However, a decade-long People's Revolution by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) along with several weeks of mass protests by all major political parties of Nepal in 2006, culminated in a peace accord and the ensuing elections and it's been over a year since the Maoists came to power in Nepal. 


Now the people of this former kingdom, wait to see if two armies, till
recently bitter enemies, can peacefully become one.

Haviland looks at how 10 years of war affected one family.
