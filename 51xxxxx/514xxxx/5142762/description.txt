Starter pack of 3 PSP Movie Wallpapers. The pictures are high quality hand drawn by me using a graphics tablet. 

The starter pack contains
  - 3 PSP Wallpapers
  - 3 PC Wallpapers

Please note: the wallpapers are just that they are not XMB themes.

The movie that have been used for these wallpapers are The Godfather, Star Wars Episode III and Superman II.

The pictures are hand drawn and they are black and white. This seems like a weird thing but the wallpapers do go brilliantly on a PSP. 

If you like these and would liek for me to do a specific movie feel free to e-mail me at:  
            
              DonVist@gmail.com

In the email write the movie name and two characters you want out of it.

Enjoy
