In this game, you play the role of Beavis and Butthead in their quest for coolness. You start out in your typical Highland High science class looking out the window as the typical badass Todd is hanging out with his buddies. Beavis and Butthead, two clueless kids who aspire to be cool, decide to search for Todd and his gang. 
Travel to the faraway city of Highland (which feels more like the outskirts of Dallas, though...) and join Beavis and Butthead as they fry countless innocent ants, work in a fast food restaurant to make their way to the top, steal a tank, break the law, recite poetry, try to loose their virginity, and even go to jail, in search of their own version of the Holy Grail.
