Bon Jovi are an American rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Fronted by lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi, Bon Jovi formed in 1983 with guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, bassist Alec John Such and drummer Tico Torres. Other than the departure of Alec John Such in 1994 (replaced by Hugh McDonald) the lineup has remained the same for the past 26 years. After two moderately successful albums in 1984 and 1985 the band scored big with Slippery When Wet (1986) and New Jersey (1988).

After non-stop touring, the band went on hiatus after the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992 the band returned with the album Keep the Faith and have since created successful albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Their latest album The Circle is set to be released **** 2009.

Throughout their career, the band have released ten studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album; and have sold over 120 million albums worldwide. They have performed more than 2,600 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. In 2006 Bon Jovi were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and in 2004 they were ranked number 14 in Q magazine's 50 Greatest Bands of All Time.
