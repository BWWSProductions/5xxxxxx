RE SEED originally on Demonoid but that site is less and less attractive these days as the delay in getting it back stretches on and on.   Extra public trackers have been added to keep this series alive as I will be off the net until March 2010 as the original seed.

Get 'em while you can :)

Source Promo Only DVD ripped into tracks with DVD Decrypter in Cell ID mode and VOB files named using industry conventions.

Out of respect for other Video Discotheques I have not messed about, and never will with the original Video quality.  The sheer amount of bad quality music video's on this site just takes my breath away.  As a golden rule if the file size is less than 50 megs DONT GO THERE unless you just want the clip to run on a mobile phone sigh.  MKV (Apple Mac comprssion format) are mostly good though but then you have to convert them to MPEG to do anything serious with them and that is a pain and of course looses quality.  Oh well, why do people do this when they have the original VOB's on a DVD is beyond me at this time.

VOB (mepeg2) files
320kps Stereo
Mixed screen ratio as North America is 25 years behind Europe in Technology SIGH...
