,CagedMMAFreak,2009-11-21T23:21Z,Thanks for the upload. This is awesome!
,JuggaloStr3tch,2009-12-07T20:38Z,"Great Job on the torrent man, i couldn't find this anywhere else. One thing i would like to recommended is to replace all the crap padding files with something useful and related like Cover images or something. Since i could just uncheck the items that i didnt want to though it wasn't much of a hassle. Keep up the quality rare shares!"
,mentiung,2009-12-15T05:21Z,"Great !!!

,DiCE1904,2009-12-24T23:31Z,"awesome thanks, my mom just saw this on the tv and said she wanted it for christmas, easy present!"
,DiCE1904,2009-12-24T23:34Z,"yea and wow! maxed out on the dl and upload speeds
over 2MB/s down speed and 800KB/s up!"
,JKaps,2009-12-26T00:23Z,"Thanks for this! Next time I suggest you add the file type and the bitrate (for example, mp3 192 KB/s).

If you are interested, the best way to rip (generally) is to rip v0 mp3. v0 is variable bit rate, meaning the bit rate changes throughout the song depending on what is going one. A silent part of the song won't need as much data as a loud orchestrated part, for example.

v0 sounds as good as 320 KB/s mp3, but because it doesn't have as much data for some sections, it is smaller than 320 KB/s mp3.


Thanks again for the torrent!"
,lokiklown,2009-12-27T17:57Z,"Thanks for the up. Seen this on tv a little bit ago and figured i would check to see if anyone else had ripped/compiled this. If not i was gonna get the file listing and down all the files and compile it...but thanks to you i dont have to!

JKaps:
If you notice in the info area he states that he downloaded all these songs individually which means he wouldnt have control over what quality they were ripped."

,king512mb,2010-01-16T16:34Z,my anti virus counts a virus in counting crows download part be warned 
,coolworld9,2010-01-25T07:15Z,"Thats stupid!... viri that affect systems are extremly rare in files that arnt executable...

spamware malware spyware viri is possible in some media on some media players  if you have the boxes checked that allow your media to connect to the internet run scripts ect..

any one says my files have a viri   they need to change their antiviral prog.."
,jlsmetalhead,2010-01-26T21:48Z,"Well Thanks And Good Job On 1st Torrent.  But It Lists ""One Thing"" by Finger 11, It's Suppoesed To Be ""Paralyzed"". Maybe U Just Typed The WRONG THING?"

,DIABOLUSMILES,2010-02-13T06:14Z,god i hate 192kbp songs -.-
,Sp4ztic,2010-02-27T01:39Z,"Thanks for the upload. Not all of the songs are at the bit rate they say, such as a 320kbps song sounding more like a 96kbps song.

On a lesser set of speakers, you wouldn't notice near as much. Regardless, thanks!"
,link2x101,2010-03-13T07:22Z,"Thanks for the upload!

,nineinchnail6794,2010-03-23T22:32Z,great upload.. i recommend NOT use bitcomet though. lol. utorrent all tha way! 
,leracos,2010-04-16T01:01Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. This is not the actual collection of CD's. Whoever created this just copied the music from other sources and compiled them. A good deal of the songs sound horrible, aren't the album version, have time cut off at the beginning/end, or something similar. Find another torrent for this one."
,NinjaNikki23,2010-05-25T10:36Z,Quick download sounds GREAT! thnx :D
,havoc1482,2010-06-21T04:32Z,I agree with laracos. This shit is fake.
,NikkiNuerotix,2010-08-24T18:03Z,"The download speed was amazing, I was up in the 300s the entire time! The quality is PERFECT. Don't listen to losers that try to troll! Everyone should have this collection! It's AWESOME. [:"
,jow9,2010-09-04T02:05Z,thanks dude even if u just copied each song you took your time and that's appreciated it sounds good on my laptop...cheers 
,jow9,2010-09-04T21:31Z,never mind i take that back only cd #1 works fine the rest is crap...
