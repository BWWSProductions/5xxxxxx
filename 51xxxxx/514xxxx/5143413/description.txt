The album was recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, CA and produced by the band's co-leader Paul Stanley and co-produced by Greg Collins. A fan routed North American tour is expected to promote the album as well as international shows throughout 2010.

The cover artwork was created by artist Michael Doret who has worked with Kiss previously for their 1976 album Rock and Roll Over. Wal-Mart will be the exclusive distributor of the album in the US and Canada, selling it as a three disc package including the new album, the album Kiss Klassics (a completely re-recorded greatest hits album already and exclusively released in Japan as Jigoku-Retsuden), and six song live DVD recorded April 5, 2009 in Buenos Aires, Argentina as part of the South American leg of the Kiss Alive/35 World Tour. The album will be sold as a digipak including a 20 page booklet. The album's first single was announced on the band's official website to be "Modern Day Delilah". As of October 26th, Sonic Boom has sold over 400,000 copies worldwide.
