This is a good torrent :D!
I hope you can get me some more really soon, cuz I have no idea of how they split up the Moomin episodes over in the US ( or where you live ).
All I know is that you got some episodes the Swedish versions are missing, unfortunanetely.. And Moomin is hard to even come by these days.. 

BUT THANK YOU!! HOPEING FOR MORE :D /R"

Anyway Im really glad that you have uploaded these seasons, I really miss my childhood and in the future I can watch them with my kids.
Again, very greatful that you shared these!"
