The third season of Moomin. If you're starting fresh on the series, get season 1 first, it doesn't matter if you follow it chronologically or not - but I think it may help with some things such as understanding the characters.
Season 1 can be obtained in convenient torrent form here:

Please know that the somewhat poor quality is the fault of the manufacturer of the DVD, STAX Entertainment. The video quality and audio quality (though the former was toned down a bit for file size consistency) is exactly as it was on the DVD.

I'd appreciate a little thank you as a comment. Keeps my motivation for doing this up, and makes me satisfied that I am doing it. Enjoy, fellow Moomin fans.
