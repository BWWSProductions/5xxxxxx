Destiny or delusion? It's a hilarious rollercoaster of laughter and confusion when 

Taishi, the ultimate otaku, drags his friend Kazuki into the swirling world of 

ambition, hatred, and love - the world of fan comics! Poor clueless Kazuki must 

sink or swim when he's dumped straight into the middle of a massive comic 

convention. Lost amidst hordes of buyers, sellers, and cosplayers, Kazuki is about 

to be baptized by fire, all in order to lead him toward his true calling: to take 

over the world through fan comics!
