Ben: Diary of a Heroin Addict (2008)
sky1 production

**â€œI hope to god you look at these videos and see what a mess I got myself intoâ€. Ben Rogers.**

Ben Rogers grew up as an ordinary, happy child in a loving family in Staffordshire, England. But despite his privileged start in life, Ben became a heroin addict. During his last months, Ben kept a video diary of his drug use and desperate attempts to come off heroin. Ravaged by the drug, Ben's body began to break down: he developed DVT and his veins were rendered so useless he had to inject into his groin. Despite his family's best efforts, Ben couldn't stop. He was haunted by, and hooked on, heroin.

Director Olly Lambert comments: â€œItâ€™s incredibly rare to come across such raw and unflinching footage of a man so close to an abyss. I was speechless when I first watched it.  I hope the film finishes what Ben had begun: to give people a visceral understanding of the nature of addiction.  It has been a privilege to try and unpick who Ben really was using the intimate legacy heâ€™s left behind.â€ The documentary also contains comments by Ben's family.
