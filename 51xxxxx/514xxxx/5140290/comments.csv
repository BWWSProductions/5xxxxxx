(3) Electronics For You 
A good quality magazine publishing from India since 1972, they are good on construction projects.

Also, I got big collection of Electronics Magazine like Electronics For You, Elektor and others (collection from 1972 onwards), I would like too share it but I do not have good scanner..but in future whenever I get document scanner, I will really love to convert them in Electronic Format to share it.
