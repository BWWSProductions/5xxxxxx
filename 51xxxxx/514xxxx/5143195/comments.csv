The patch not work for me.
It say:The software not found. aaaaaa shit
(SORRY for my BAAAD ENGLISH)"
,adhd1981,2010-06-26T21:23Z,it doesn't work says that some program hasn't been installed please install again wat a crap
,JesiahCarver,2010-07-06T22:37Z,"It might not work if you don't have the original .exe in there. Before cracking the game you should have turned the original .exe into a backup file. If you did, restore that one and then run the patch program. Once its done you can use your crack again."
,jbscythe,2010-10-15T03:11Z,anybody out there looking for Star Wars - Force Commander pc game? here it is full and no install or crack needed. just extract and play. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5887563/Star_Wars_-_Force_Commander.rar
,Bad213Boy,2011-02-12T18:13Z,"@leviminator94

There are 2 patches idiot. If you spend the time and actually look them up, you'll notice there is a NA version, and a Multi Language version. The NA stands for North American, and the Multi should be self explanatory."
,detenator,2012-06-29T01:15Z,"My game lagged a LOT before using this patch/crack (with a capable graphics card), but now it runs WAY smoother. Thanks!"
