Broken Heroes
Aired: Oct 30, 2009

Every November 11 we mark Remembrance Day to honour the sacrifices made by those who serve their country in wartime. We remember, especially, the dead and those who carry the physical wounds of war. But, what of those with the invisible injuries, the crippling wounds of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? 

In Broken Heroes, Gillian Findlay introduces us to three Canadian soldiers, recently returned from Afghanistan: Jeff, Matt and Dave. All three speak candidly about the hell that now consumes their lives: flashbacks hurtling them back to the danger of the war zone, grief for dead comrades, their ongoing battles with addiction, even suicide attempts.

PTSD is not a new phenomenon. In the First World War, it was called â€œshell shockâ€, never really understood, and never adequately dealt with. But, the urgency to find a treatment has never been greater. By the time Canadaâ€™s combat mission in Afghanistan is over in 2011, 35,000 Canadian men and women will have served there. Using the militaryâ€™s own arguably conservative estimate, as many as 2,000 of those could be coming home with PTSD.
