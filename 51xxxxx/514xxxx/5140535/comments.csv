,walkingcontradiction,2009-11-06T02:00Z,"WHOA! My mother got an email today from AT&T that was supposedly a forward from NBC
it said NBC knew i had downloaded this file (they mentioned the whole .hdtv.xvid-fqm stuff as well) along with the previous episode of the office and that if i did not stop they were going to file a law suit
i didn't believe it was real because it was an email that ended in abuse-att.net.
the website only says the word ""hi!"" but the WHOIS database says the website is owned by AT&T and has the correct address.
in the message is my correct address, my mothers full name, and some letters that i thought were garbage text but mother pointed out were abbreviations for the directions she had given an AT&T repair man before correct all the way down to TL @ WH HSE 
Am i the only one that downloaded this with BellSouth DSL that got this message?
i still dont want to think this is real and i dont see why at&t would include directions to my house in an email to us
perhaps someone hacked into AT&T's info and decided to scare people
i hope so"
