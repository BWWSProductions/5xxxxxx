Here's info from the Readme that included.

""1.9 has all the update issues fixed, and passes WGA!

It is vital you upgrade!

The uninstaller in this version will clean up all previous versions, and the installer will do the same so either way it will work.

Enjoy the best release yet!"""

Here is the response from VirusTotal Scan. It gets a hit as being packed with ASPack, and two as a WindowsWGA Crack. No Alureon Trojan detected. And yes, it's effectively a WGA Crack... ;-)
