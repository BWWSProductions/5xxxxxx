Great picture and sound quality. Widescreen formatted too. Chosse to view with 
Italian or English Audio. Embedded subtitle options include English or French.

Byth way, I avoid watching a dubbed version of a movie when the original version
is available with English subtitles. You miss out on a great deal of the flavour
and affect and in this respect you lose a lot in the translation with a dubbed
approach. This movie is called "La Vita e bella/Life is beautiful" in the
combined Italian/English version and that is how I recommend you purchase it
as I can tell you that they have done a beautiful job with the English audio
too in this great movie performance.

This is a movie with a lot of potential to teach. It teaches the value of
honesty as a way of life in that this can be fully retained when a man is
simply acting in a humorous spirit to make life seem more bearable and to spare
children an ugly reality that surrounds them. Yet there is a spirit that
continues in Benigni's character as a man who'd like to stay sane honestly
enough that he will conjure up a version of events to keep his audience with
him and in good humour. Such characters are always trying for as much real
honesty as the situation will allow however they have learned a defensive
coping mechanism to telling it like it is. And in this respect perhaps his son
at the end has a better view of the world than is justified however fact is
that he is being lied to by a man who thinks he is being a better father this
way. Its a great story that touches on the travesty and the tragedy of the
holocaust, as Italian jews were not spared this fate although many were
harbored by good Italians who could not go along with Hitler's madness in this
respect.

Enjoy! Grazie, especially for all who seed, I'm grateful!

We will try to have other subtitles posted for you as they become available
too in SRT format, especially.
