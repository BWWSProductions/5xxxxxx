When you download this file, you have to extract it, then go in that map and copy those files in your l4d2 demo directory.
There has to be a CRACK folder in your l4d2 demo folder. Go in it and then run UnDead.Injector. 
After you do that run left4dead2_demo_launcher and create a game. Then you are ready to play.
