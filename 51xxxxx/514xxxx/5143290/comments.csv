,Kijun333,2009-11-01T13:40Z,"Well im seeding it but it doesn't work . 

If the developers read this , good job coding the game xD .

To the crackers , hope you guys do a great job for the release .

Still waiting for a fix though :

it still exits at 90% loading screen ."
,ribimibi,2009-11-01T13:50Z,did you do excatly as stated above? Have you run UnDead Injector and then Created a game?
,ribimibi,2009-11-01T13:50Z,Oh and no steam. I play it with no steam. It's probably best you don't have it turned on.
,Kijun333,2009-11-01T14:06Z,"Yes , i did everything it said in there , without steam open , it gives the exact same error when steam was running , it exits at 90% loading bar ..."
,ribimibi,2009-11-01T14:13Z,"Hmm, well I don't know. Can you write what appears in that error so I can look it up maybe? If I don't find anything tho, you'll just have to wait for the full game to arrive :S. It's said to arrive the 3rd of November."
,Kijun333,2009-11-01T14:29Z,"There is no exact error , it just plainly exits without one , well il just wait till the 3rd nov , il get a combo with DragonAge Origins xD"
,ribimibi,2009-11-01T14:46Z,"Well you might try that RevLoader. But if it doesn't work then yeah, we'll have to wait."
