This is a wonderful piece of creative and enchanting music. I have enjoyed it immensely. The music is exhilirating and has introduced an eastern dimension to the classical music of Mozart making the experience of listening to it outstanding.


It does not only bring east and west together but actually manages to blend them beautifully on different occasions. The eastern instruments used like the ney, kawala and the rababa have managed to create Mozart's perfect orchestra and have brought a fascinating sense of the mystical east to the music.


The vocals and singers have also added a lot of inspiration to the music.


This is something you must listen too!




Enjoy and Seed!!
