[V],Slickinator,2009-11-09T03:42Z,make sure you disable the updates because once you get the newer update from this version the serials will not work just use cleanvso and delete it completely and restart and install again and use a serial as i know they are working as i used the last one my self no problems just uncheck the update or send vso stuff ok take care
