Best known these days for her daytime talk-show stint with Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford is an accomplished vocalist, especially on slow, sentimental ballads. On Born for You, she tackles plenty of cabaret favorites that focus on the theme of lasting love. With influences that range from jazz ("Moondance") to classical ("On My Way to You"), Lee does her best to liven up these well-worn standards with her smooth-as-silk voice. "Circle Game" and "Only My Pillow Knows" feature subtle contributions from Dolly Parton, "Child in Me" employs a children's chorus, and a string section accompanies Lee on the title track. Unfortunately, many new listeners will find Lee's impeccable tone on these songs monotonous and disappointing. --Jason Verlinde
