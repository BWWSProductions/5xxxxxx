Image:         MDS/MDF
Genre.:        Action
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works. 


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


Important - This is a CD Type or Compact Disc Ps2 Game. So you must use CD-R Media
            only to burn with.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.



Game Description:

The battle that has split more blood over centuries continues, with the human marines caught in-between the powerful Aliens and the deadly Predators.

Moving away from the FPS series on PC, Extinction has you controlling one of the three races in a real time strategy mix, building each unit and setting them out into the battlefield to complete a range of tasks.

Each race has an advantage and disadvantage. The humans have a collection of different units, from heavy weapons experts to medics, and are better known for their long range attacks. Predators are hardcore fighters, taking the battle right up to the enemy, although there are fewer of them available to counter act their superior power. Finally, the Aliens are fast and deadly, and always hunt in large packs.

Upgrade weapons and use terrain to an advantage in each level to make certain your team (whoever or whatever they may be) survive until the next battle.


Features:

* Harness the unique advantages you possess as an Alien, Predator, or Colonial
  Marine to wage war in 21 single-player missions. 

* Control one of three different races - each with it's own characteristics and 
  abilities to suit any style of play. 

* Upgrade up to 10 different unit types of various races including new, never 
  before seen units such  as the Predator Hydra or the Alien Ravager. 

* Engage the enemy in 21 unique maps, from jungles to deserts to high-tech 
  laboratories. 

* Utilize powerful resources and strategies including pulse rifles, exosuits, and 
  air strikes to unleash devastating attacks on your enemies.
