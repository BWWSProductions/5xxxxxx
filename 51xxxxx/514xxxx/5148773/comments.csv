I just downloaded the video. There are blurred areas where I suppose there were time/ID marks.
Other than that, the video is quite watchable.

v:8
a:9

The movie is pretty good too although predictable."

,sk8shaun,2009-11-15T19:07Z,i dont think this is a dvd rip.....i give it V: 5 A: 8 because when stretched onto a 42 inch plasma it looks horrible and also there is a thick blurry line along the top of the screen and the bottom of the screen......was good enough to watch on my 15 inch laptop screen though and the audio is pretty good
