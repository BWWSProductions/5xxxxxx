,DaveGee123,2009-11-05T02:09Z,"I hate to say it but anyone posting DEMO software & serials implying it's the genuine article... Is a Dip SH*T.

,mepoc,2009-11-05T10:39Z,"Sorry to agree with @DaveGee123 but releasing something with a TRIAL serial is just not ok... At least it should have stated it clearly in the release notes... :-(

Anyone with a valid serial (and a wish to share it) should come forward. And if so, @duri should update the release notes..."

,Pangea28,2009-11-08T02:21Z,"First.- It's a ßeta version
Second.- This serial is time-limited to this ßeta version so...
Third.- A real and new Parallels Desktop 5 (with serial) should be great. 
PS) I've never used ßeta software in my puter (please, leave software failures to the ßeta testers) "
,Kingcodez,2009-11-09T05:37Z,"First, if it was a beta then why is apple selling it as a full-featured release, a Version 5, rather than simply labeling it as beta? They wouldn't be selling shit if it wasn't already at Gold release. Get a fuckin clue you dumb ass. This is the final release. You can d/l the same shit off Apple's site.

If it was beta, then they'd label it as beta. This would fall under the demo category, since there is no working serial.

The keys are two week limited, so who knows, in two weeks you might be able to re-reg with a different email, or have to simply re-install and you can get a new key, software this new won't have a keygen or working serials for awhile.

I love how retarded people freak out when they see even a whisper of the word beta. You need to chill out and use time machine more than once a year. "
,Bardiya_z,2009-11-09T07:14Z,"first, this IS a beta version, look at the version number on the torrent, 5.0.8898.441204, available keys are beta keys(which are expired), or trial keys(till 2009.11.24)

retail version, which is in apple site is 5.0.9220.531002 which is downloadable
here: http://url.parallels.com/2dae4aa53013a30de68977a7

and no key yet."
,Pangea28,2009-11-09T19:23Z,"Did you wear your glasses, Kingcodez? Clic in ""About Parallels Desktop"" and you'll see it's a ßeta version. Who is the retarded people now? :-)"
,hemu2712,2009-11-09T22:48Z,Nobody Got IDEA on how to crack Parallels Desktop 5.0. It's best and most secure software ever.
,freynoso,2009-11-12T15:51Z,"Hi all.  Can somebody please, try this one:
GC956T-XQN1ZM-MG0JC0-3B3JRT-XZTW2T "
,lrlr0099,2009-11-12T16:00Z,GC956T-XQN1ZM-MG0JC0-3B3JRT-XZTW2T seems to work. I know longer am asked to enter a serial on vm boot. 
,freynoso,2009-11-12T16:12Z,"Please, check at the menu option ""About Parallels Desktop"" to verify that is not a trial key.  Please, and thanks."
,pilot76103,2009-11-12T19:59Z,GC956T-XQN1ZM-MG0JC0-3B3JRT-XZTW2T is working and shows fully activated with the latest copy of Parallels Desktop 5.0 for Mac from the official website. Thanks!
,llevante,2009-11-16T00:37Z,Hey everyone...first i want to confirm that the serial works. Just a question that may seem logic but i want to ask it anyway. Is it safe or possible to register with this serial??
,noldy,2009-12-25T12:44Z,I have previous 4.0 cracked version installed in my Mac already. How to update to 5.0 version using the crack key given ?
