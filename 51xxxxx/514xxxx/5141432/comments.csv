Slap happy 4 has no protection on it, get some proper codecs as it works fine.
Also 1-3 only came out this quality, I bought the orginal and that quality was terrible."
,Welcometothesuck,2010-02-15T01:19Z,Hes right #4 does have copyright protection and requires you to purchase a licence.
,dongiovanni77,2010-06-02T16:19Z,what codec do i need to play season 4 file?
,wookiee666,2010-06-15T18:12Z,"Fuck this DRM.
A curse on you AND your family!!!"
,thedeathlessprince,2011-08-06T16:18Z,"4 doesn't play, it does have protection on it as far as I can tell.

I've tried, Windows Media Player (with ever fucking codec), Media Player Classic and FLV Player... none of them will play it.

If you download this torrent don't bother with Slap Happy #4.
1-3 are fine thought, and about as good a quality as you can get for a download from Slap Happy.

Thanks mikemikemikeuploader."
