Plot: â€œThe Limits of Controlâ€ is the new movie from filmmaker Jim Jarmusch (â€Broken Flowers,â€ â€œDown by Lawâ€). The film is set in the striking and varied landscapes of contemporary Spain (both urban and otherwise). The location shoot there united the writer/director with acclaimed cinematographer Christopher Doyle (â€In the Mood for Love,â€ â€œParanoid Parkâ€). Isaach De BankolÃ© stars in the lead role for Mr. Jarmusch; this marks the duoâ€™s fourth collaboration over nearly two decades, following â€œNight on Earth,â€ â€œGhost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,â€ and â€œCoffee and Cigarettes.â€ â€œThe Limits of Controlâ€ also features several other actors with whom Mr. Jarmusch has previously worked, including Alex Descas, John Hurt, Youki Kudoh, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton; and actors new to his films, including Hiam Abbass, Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal, Paz De La Huerta, Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©venin, and Luis Tosar.
