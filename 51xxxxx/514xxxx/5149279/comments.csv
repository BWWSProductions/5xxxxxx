,brandsy,2010-01-25T14:31Z,quality is good but as zmacdaddy said a giant wast of time one of the most boring films i have seen. This film could have been done in less than 10 mins NO KIDDING.
,Gnomskuss,2010-02-04T13:26Z,"I think this is a mood movie. it has not really a plot but you can easily sink into this film if you have a hipster-phase.
in the cinema I had to laugh, so boring is the movie. but it's still a great film!"
,d3ntman,2010-03-16T06:19Z,Worth the watch just for the cast! Some of the best American actors alive today.
,d3ntman,2010-03-16T06:21Z,"I bet some commentators here liked Speed I and II and Saw I,II,III,etc
No wonder they can't appreciate real story telling. Brains have been wired to simple mode."
