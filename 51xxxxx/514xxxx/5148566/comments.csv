I will be seeding 24/7 over the next weeks, but unfortunately my bandwidth is limited to 30 KB/s or so, hence try to be patient."
,EvilEyeUK,2009-11-08T16:25Z,"The instructions only talk about screen resultions. They don't say how to run the game.

I just see exe files; how to start it on an Intel mac?"
,Boyd63,2009-11-08T19:15Z,"EvilEyeUK:
1) unzip
2) set screen resolution as described
3) double click on GTR2.app to run the game"
,EvilEyeUK,2009-11-09T17:18Z,"Thanks. But after decompressing and just double clicking the GTR2  brings up the screen for setting the resolution and a button for starting X3. This button unfortunately does nothing.

I'm on 10.6.1."
,Boyd63,2009-11-10T09:43Z,"I'm on 10.6.1 as well and I can run the game fine.

I guess you have Crossover installed on your system and are double clicking GTR2.exe, trying to run the Windows executable. That will not work. 

You have to show package contents only for editing that Config file described in the instructions. When you have done that you should close the folder that previously popped up when you clicked on ""show package contents"", and start the game as you would normally do with any other Mac application, that is by double clicking GTR2.app and not GTR2.exe (or anything else).

Sorry if I'm being a little pedantic, I'm trying to guide you through."
,EvilEyeUK,2009-11-11T08:29Z,"Thanks for the explanation. Unfortunately clicking the GTR2.app is precisely what I did do after decompressing and setting the screen resolution.
The app wants to start something called X3 but then does nothing.
X3 seems to be some kind of input device but it is not mentioned in the config files. Its absence on my machine  seems to be blocking the startup sequence.

Any  ideas?"
,IngegneriaElettronica,2009-11-12T16:34Z,"many ciderports will not work on snow leopard because the x11 code was completely revrited, but in some cases ciderport works because it treats every system in a different way.. so if u will be lucky u will play this game even on SL... if u are not lucky u won't!
Many people is working on a patch that will fix this problem and emule the old x11 code in wich was created the old ciderports on Snow Leopard."
,ionlyknow,2009-11-18T23:08Z,This works very well. Everything runs perfectly... with exception of the graphics. But it doesn't really matter.
,bartlaz,2009-11-26T13:18Z,thank u. works very well!!!

,megstoriches,2010-06-12T00:39Z,"Boyd63, I'm trying to find a way to run my Nascar Thunder 2004 on my new iMac (with the latest version 10.6).  Is there anyway you can help me?  Is it even possible to convert and use on my iMac? Thanks.  I'm unable to find ANY Nascar racing games for mac..."
