ABGX 1.0.1 for PPC Macs (OSX 10.5 - Leopard Only!)

This was compiled from the Linux version to work on PowerPC Macs

Tested and works perfectly on my Mac Mini G4 1.25 GhZ

--------------------------------------

IF YOU GET AN ERROR WHEN USING ABGX IN TERMINAL THAT SAYS: "-bash: /usr/bin/abgx360: Bad CPU type in executable"

Step 1) Open a new terminal window

Step 2) Type in: which abgx360

If it says: /usr/bin/abgx360 this means you tried to install the Intel version of ABGX360 before (we all hoped it would work, didn't we? lol!)

To fix this...

Step 3) Type in: sudo rm /usr/bin/abgx360

This should get rid of the old abgx360 file.

Step 4) Repeat step 2. it should now say: /usr/local/bin/abgx360

After doing this everything should work fine!
