,toddiot,2009-11-06T18:02Z,"Well, first of all, the album was released in the summer, which is probably recent enough to warrant a star anyway. But she performed the track on Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago too, which makes the track more culturally relevant again. Not that it ever ceased being culturally relevant. I'm kind of bullshitting, can you tell?"
