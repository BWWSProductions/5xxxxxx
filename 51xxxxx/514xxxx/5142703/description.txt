CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - OCTOBER 2009
       ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Happy Halloween! If you're looking for the perfect Halloween-y track for
today, check out "For Halloween" by No Kids -- it's in the August 2008 CTC.

As for this month, we've got new Vampire Weekend, Islands, Julian
Casablancas, Tiesto (featuring Emily Haines), and more. Plus, two remixes
that should have been included in last month's playlist, but weren't:
The XX remixing Florence + The Machine, and De La Soul remixing Matt &
Kim.

Remember, Cut The Crap Playlists are released on the last day of every
month. 

Cheers,

Josh
