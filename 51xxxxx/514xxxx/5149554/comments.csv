,superbigshow,2009-11-09T01:40Z,"So many hit-and-runs. Disappointing. Can someone confirm that it works for them, please?"
,DeathMinister,2009-12-05T22:02Z,"It works in DAEMON Tools with all the DVD playing programs on my computer, as soon as I buy some DVD's I'll test that out.  Will seed as much as possible."
,DeathMinister,2009-12-22T03:02Z,Just burned it and tried it on my Xbox 360 and it plays fine.
,StagMan196,2010-01-24T16:44Z,"Thanks for sharing this copy. It came down fairly quick, about 6 or 7 hrs. Burned no problem with Nero and plays on my Bluray/DVD home player as well as my standard common player."

,Kapathita,2010-05-03T18:53Z,"It's just perfect!
Lot's and lot's of Subtitles are in the DVD. 
I seed it continuously! 
It's so important for people to know the truth about money!
I didn't write it down on a DVD but I'm pretty sure it will work fine as it works with Daemon Tools. "
,Kapathita,2010-05-10T15:29Z,"I've written this official DVD release of Zeitgeist Addendum on DVD-Rs (disks) and I've played it on various DVD Players. Everything works fine. 
I gave copies of this DVD to my friends. 
Everything works fine. 
Thanks a lot superbigshow. "
