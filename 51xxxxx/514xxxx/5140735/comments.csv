All they did was add support for the new partition size.  Its just as live safe as the last firmware.

There will end up being another update a couple months down the line from now since the facebook/twitter, etc updates will hit live and then a few months after that will be included on retail game discs."
,saada245,2009-10-31T01:34Z,I just tried to? sign in to xbox live and i got banned. Got any help for me? I know that im fucked but owell i knew my dumbass would get banned. Surprised i lasted this long!

Your out of luck, there is talk of a ban wave going on right now.  If its a console ban your SOL short of buying a new console, if its a gamertag ban they will email your address on file and let you know."
,saada245,2009-10-31T05:05Z,I took my hard drive and put it on another xbox and it played fine but would Microsoft ban my new xbox?

Yes, they banned your console ID for life.  It will never connect to live again.  IF you mod your new box and they ban that one same thing.

Do some research, this is the risk you take by playing pirated games on 360.  "
,saada245,2009-10-31T20:00Z,"Im pretty sure i was banned for playing forza 3 like a week before it came out. Im a retard and thought, ""hey i played all games before release date and nothing happened, so let me try forza"". The good thing is my live subscription is going to be done on Nov. 25, so i didnt waste $50 on live for nothing. "
,xtradowner,2009-11-01T04:26Z,"banned this week. didnt ever play online b4 a game was released, but did play them b4 they were released offline. was using ixtreme 1.6. seems interesting that a new wave of games is out coinciding with a wave of banning, and it also seems more ppl get banned in the 4th quarter than any other time. there is only one way to change the ID #'s that xbox live uses to identify the console:

it is very difficult to do, much harder than simply flashing the drive. and leaves the only other option being to get another xbox. which could be banned the next time they decide to do a wave of bans. you can not just switch out the dvd drive because the cpu contains the id # and it must coincide with the id # on the dvd drive. to switch a dvd drive you have to put the firmware from the original drive onto the new one, or take both the drives apart and switch the circuit boards of the drives out. which would mean you would be using the same id # and still be banned. damnit!!!!"
,JTyler1990,2009-11-15T03:06Z,"ok im confused... i had the latest firmware, bought call of duty on original anyway yet i still get a console ban!!! Y?... players u r not safe no matter what, microsoft are too clever and will get you!!"
