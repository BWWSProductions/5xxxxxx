,JonYo,2009-11-04T00:58Z,"Hey there mister 80zforever!  If/when TPB poops out, and if you decide to post things on some other tracker, I wonder how we'll all find you.  You've got such a following here on TPB that you should have your own mailing list or something.  Then again, maybe you prefer to keep it more anonymous..."
[V],80zforever,2009-11-04T07:46Z,"JonYo, I have tested some other torrent sites and honestly I think I will go down along with tpb. However let's live day-to-day and enjoy this awesome cultural tool for a bit more and as long as it lasts.  "
,Spurge42,2009-11-04T08:23Z,"Thanks 80zforever.. I do enjoy your posts. It would be a shame not to see you on other torrent sites also if the bay leaves us. You could always enjoy some waffles, and i'd be happy to meet you for some ;)"
,Babygeorge,2009-11-05T12:06Z,"As usual:

THANK YOU so much for your encyclopedic effort 80zforever!
=)


I got one request [I cant find it here!] :

THE OTHER ONES - Holiday [1986] 

Everytime I type HOLIDAY I get Madonna + Green Day + some 1986 rap song and now even Dizzee Rascal but not The Other Ones ... 

HELP please!
:p

[V],80zforever,2009-11-05T21:22Z,"Spurge42 hahaha thx for the waffle offer. You know I am a rebel kind and don't play with the rules set by private torrent sites. I like tpb since I can post whenever and whatever I want, any BR, my ratio does not matter, no stringent rules and on and on. And again there's less demand on private torrents due to limited number of users which demotivates me to upload on a regular basis. There were my observations at what.cd of course but I assusme waffle is kind of similiar. But thx afor the offer!

And Babygeorge, I think I have your request. Let me see if I can find it for you this weekend. cheers"
,Spurge42,2009-11-06T12:23Z,"80zforever.  No worries.  and again, thanks for all your offerings here at TPB.  I wish you all the best and look forward to your releases. Cheers! "
,JonYo,2009-11-08T00:58Z,"Hey 80zforever, is there any specific stuff that you're currently hunting around for?  Maybe one of us can hook you up.  Just wondering..."
,d9less,2010-02-08T23:27Z,"Thanks for so much great music, 80z!

woud you perchance have the other album by The AU PAIRS.

or maybe in your Aussie rock collection you might have something by Huxton Creepers?"
