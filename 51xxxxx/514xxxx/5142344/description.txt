What's new in Acronis True Image Home 2010:
* Continuous Data Protection &mdask Acronis Nonstop Backupâ„¢ automatically creates incremental backups every five minutes allowing users to roll back their system, files, and folders to any point in time.
* Support for MicrosoftÂ® Windows 7 â€” Delivers more comprehensive functionality over Microsoft Windows 7 backup capabilities.
* Virtual Hard Disk SupportSave backup images (.tib) as virtual hard disk (.vhd) files â€” Run your existing system as a virtual machine, or boot using Windows 7 Ultimate.
* New Powerful Scheduler â€” In addition to the scheduling tools found in previous versions, the new scheduler expands the amount of scheduling options available. Use the new calendar view to build schedules and tasks. Suspend and enable tasks, specify dates to run tasks, and copy tasks to new dates.
* Boot from Windows 7 image â€” Windows 7 Ultimate users can boot from a backup image (.tib file) containing a backup of their system partition. This will allow the ability to test a backed up system without actual restoration. If the operating system boots from the .tib file, then it will boot when the need arises for a system recovery.
* Try & Decide New features:
o Try & Decide now can protect your system not only to Acronis Secure Zone, but to the protected volume itself, or any other volume
o Multivolume Protection â€” now users can protect not only a single system partition during Try & Decide session, but as many volumes, as needed. This is very handy when the applications being installed make changes on two volumes and in many other cases.

Using Acronis Nonstop Backup requires at least 1 GB RAM.
