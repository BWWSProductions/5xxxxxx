If I can get this running I'll be very happy. Thanks for uploading!"
,15941729,2009-11-04T07:12Z,"It's not fooled by a mounted disk image, has to be burned to disk. Confirmed functional on 10.6.1 if you do that. Awesome!

If anyone can tell me how to trick it into using a mounted disk image so I can play it on my netbook that'd be awesome too."
,syork,2009-11-04T14:49Z,"Here is how to get it to run w/o disc.
-open disc utility
-highlight stronghold.toast and right-click.
-convert
-leave format compressed and change extension to .dmb
-when stronghold.dmg appears in disc utility, highlight, click the open button, then you should be ready to go.

This is how I got mine to work.  Been playing it."
,syork,2009-11-04T14:49Z,"edit:
change extension to .dmg, not .dmb"
,15941729,2009-11-05T09:43Z,oh of course! thanks! I can't believe I didn't think of converting it.

,LordStyle,2009-11-13T22:18Z,"I've tried all advice from this torrent but no working game.  I cannot get the game to mount, period. I've tried all of syork's comments too, but still no game... Any advice for a 2008, MBPro, Leopard, and 4 gigs ram system?"
,ropiko,2009-11-16T20:17Z,"try to burn it on  a cd with toast, it worked fine for me:)"
