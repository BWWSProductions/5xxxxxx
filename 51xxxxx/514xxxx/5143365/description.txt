If like me you have an absolute distain for organised religion then this wonderfully irreverent film is for you.

Bill Maher takes us through a personal journey in which he highlights the pure stupidity of those who are selfish enough to want to live forever, both here on earth and then in 'heaven'.

My personal highlight is the catholic priest he talks to while in Rome who seems even more contemptible of his religion than Maher himself!



Enjoy and Seed!!
