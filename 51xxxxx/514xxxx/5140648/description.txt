The Castilian, about a nobleman leading his people against invaders, takes a look at the medieval Spanish wars between the Moors and the Christians. It tells the tale of a hero, FernÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez, who comes out of exile to become Count of Castile and overthrow the grip of Moorish tyranny with his mighty sword. GonzÃ¡les was one of Spain's greatest heroes and a pioneer of guerilla warfare. Cult star Soledad Miranda has a small part as Maria, a Castilian woman who is to be given to the Moors to appease them. Interestingly enough, this drama was filmed at the actual sites in Spain where the events unfolded. The film might not be entirely accurate historically, but the actors are good and the movie overall is enjoyable to watch.
