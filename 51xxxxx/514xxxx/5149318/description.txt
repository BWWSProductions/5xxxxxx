     |           Guantanamo naval base, 'Gitmo', covers forty            |
     |           five square miles of Cuba inside an area under          |
     |           a controversial 'permanent lease' to the United         |
     |           States. Since 2002, the base has become synonymous      |
     |           with its detainment facilities for suspected            |
     |           terrorists. Although Barack Obama has given orders      |
     |           for the detention camp to be closed, the                |
     |           facilities remain open to this day. David Miller's      |
     |           quiet, powerful film is the result of three days        |
     |           the filmmaker spent touring the camps in May 2008       |
     |           as part of a small group of media representatives       |
     |           allowed there. Although the event was presented         |
     |           as a chance to 'see inside' the working of              |
     |           Guantanamo, it was in fact a carefully staged PR        |
     |           exercise designed to yield predictable, stale,          |
     |           controlled media images.                                |
