,razer167,2009-11-06T08:51Z,"It was worth watching but i didn't i learn much from it, just that there's a lot of secrecy Guantanamo"
,Enone,2009-11-06T08:53Z,"imho gitmo is fine, the civilized world needs a more effective place to put people like Nidal Hasan. If you don't live up to the minimum requirements of freedom, maybe you shouldn't have any.

It's weird that the media is more concerned about prisoners of war than it is about the well being of the citizenry."
,karnal,2009-11-06T08:57Z,The solution to the world's problems is one easy thing - nuke the USA. 
,Tom-47,2009-11-06T09:03Z,HEY karnal are you a fucking terrorist i thing we  must nuke your ass
,Th3_Raging_Bull,2009-11-06T09:17Z,Lets not nuke anybody. How about that?
,eind,2009-11-06T09:39Z,"Enone

When there are people being held without beeing prosecuted of a crime, with no lawyer to defend them, and getting tortured. I think it concerns everyone"
,fuwad84,2009-11-06T09:56Z,"We should put all these right wing tea-baggers that are always toting guns at their rallies in Gitmo, see how they like water boarding. "
,teamcoltra,2009-11-06T10:13Z,"Its funny how many extremists there are on both sides of the isle ""I hate you because you believe something different than I do... your an idiot because your a liberal... your an idiot because you are a conservative""   
In the end we all just want whats best for the people around us and the people we care about... we just have different ideas on how to get there.


btw my dad is waayy cooler than your dad. :)"
,erator,2009-11-06T10:56Z,No need to nuke US .They so stupid and selfish (not all of them just those ho got real power) they will nuke themselfs :D

,infocom4ever,2009-11-06T17:54Z,Whats that about water boarding? Even the Beach Boys had a hit with surfÂ´n USA.
,playypro,2009-11-06T20:28Z,"let's nuke all selfish leechers, that would make the world a lot better place."
,sidsimon,2009-11-06T20:29Z,"That's funny. I never heard any liberals or weak TIT Euros speak out against Taliban or Al-Quaeda
prisons. If they even exist, they must be like Club Med...right? 

More likely. if you speak out against them,  they just kill your family as you watch, then they kill you. Your livestock are more valuable to them than you are.  I'm waiting for the Taliban and North Korean versions of this documentary.
Right or Wrong, at least the USA does SOMETHING about these animals. Euros are too frightened because they've been infested with these pigs."
,jubileu21,2009-11-06T21:40Z,"Valeu a iniciativa !!1
baixando e semeando."
,danielwe,2009-11-06T22:18Z,To Tom-47  and karnal : Tom-47 you aint a terrorist if you want to nuke USA cause that would mean every country except US is terrorist =P and karnal nuking the US wouldn't solve the worlds problems.
,DeadLord,2009-11-06T22:23Z,@sidsimon: Well the al-qieda isn't trying to win a popularity contest like america and pretends to be all nice and huggy... they do what they say: remove the unbelivers. And well not as ruthlessly as their enemy does but who gives a shit? And do you really think that all of the ppl there have actually done something?... if so you're a bit to ignorant to be talking to.
,teamcoltra,2009-11-06T23:32Z,"@swashbucklingbuckaneer
