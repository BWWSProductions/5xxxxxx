A great solo pianist, one that also doesn't seem to make it into history at all for some reason. His homepage is now down and it is very hard to find anything about him on the internet. I managed to get a hold of both his CD's, used. I figured I'd give him some exposure to help carry on his great compositions into history.

I hope you enjoy this torrent. FLAC is the way to go. Bad sound kills good music! ;]
