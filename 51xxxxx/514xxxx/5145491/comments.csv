,Raikalo,2009-11-27T08:27Z,"Haven't tried this torrent. It's much larger than the other guide posted here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5141731/Zygor_2.0_Leveling_guide_for_WoW_3.2.2

So I'd try this one first, if you're paranoid. It's working fine for me."
,Raikalo,2009-11-27T08:30Z,"Okay, I re-read the post and all the guides are included, which is why the file is larger.

My bad."
,Lakrits11,2009-11-30T20:15Z,".exe, dont download, use http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5141731/Zygor_2.0_Leveling_guide_for_WoW_3.2.2 instead"
,1011000,2009-12-06T10:03Z,"No virus, works great. The smaller torrent does not include the guides."

,PopeChris,2009-12-11T09:32Z,"Unfortunately, it seems that this version won't work with Patch 3.3.  The next update (Version 2.0.626) is supposed to with some tweaking, but I'd rather wait until Zygor releases an update for 3.3 so you don't have to ghettorig it.

In the meantime, though, if someone has 2.0.626, please upload it. :p"
,PopeChris,2009-12-11T09:52Z,"Correction: I'm an idiot.

Don't use cartographer.  If you use TomTom with this version of Zygor's guide, it'll work just fine."
,Illsuions,2009-12-11T14:39Z,"This version still works with cartographer, I am using it right now.


#1 When you get to the character selection screen click AddOns. Make sure all the Zygor and Cartographer files are checked. Also, you should see a check box on the top right that says load out of date addons. Make sure this is checked as well.

#2 At the character selection screen, click addons, and disable all of the Cartographer addons EXCEPT Cartographer, Cartographer Waypoint, and Cartographer Notes and try again.

#3 If you are having trouble with Cartographer and the new Blizzard map and quest location system, make sure the ""Show Quest Objectives"" box is unchecked at the bottom of your world map ingame. This will make the map look normal again, like you are used to Cartographer making it look.

,tomatpasser,2009-12-11T21:33Z,actually this still works as already stated :)
