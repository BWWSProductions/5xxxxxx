This is my first attempt at an upload , I hope i'v done it right .

 
KES is an old film but very good though , it's about a young lad " Billy " who finds a kestrel  chick , and trains it . 

It's got a few laughs in it too , the PT bit is good where they play footy . 

It's an ISO file taken straight from the original DVD . Anyway hope you like it .
