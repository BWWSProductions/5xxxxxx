This dynamic album released in 2007 is a special edition compilation of Pop-Jazz hits! Includes new Mike Phillips remake of the classic hit, "Street Life" also featuring Jill Scott! The album also includes hits by Donald Byrd, Nancy Wilson(one of the best versions ever of ode to billie joe), Labi Siffre and Bobbi Humphrey! Pop-Jazz is jazz music that lives in the present. It's a movement that captures the freshly original, creative and innovative musicians who claim a broader musical turf than traditional jazz, yet have the distinctive playing style and compositional voice that doesn't exist in the smooth jazz camp. These musicians have conceived a sophisticated yet accessible art form that matches the artistry of traditional jazz but also incorporates a more eclectic musical appetite that deftly fuses the influences of hip hop, soul, funk, rock and pop experiences.
