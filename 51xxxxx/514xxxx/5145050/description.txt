The soundtrack from the great game Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura. It's a beautifully composed string quartet of approximately 50 minutes length. This should interest both Arcanum gamers as well as people with a taste for classical music.

I hope you enjoy this torrent. FLAC is the way to go. Bad sound kills good music! ;]
