Artist: Martha And The Muffins

Album: Far Away In Time

Genra: Nu-Wave / New Wave


This is the Best Of album from the most definitive nu-wave band of the early 1980s. Unfortunately only remembered for the classic track Echo Beach (a real place in Toronto by the way, but at the time of writing the group didn't know this) they never got the recognition they truly deserved. As with many other Canadian musicians such as Arcade Fire their style, substance and creativity is often overshadowed by the shallow sex, commercialism, greed and money of those crazy lunatics that live next door. God I hate yanks

Canada you have our sympathy and respect.

I also included a video of echo beach generously provided by RosaMannen, cheers mate. There is also small selection of pics and a recent cover of the famous echo beach by Gabriella Cilmi.


Please seed this if there is less than a dozen seeds or for a few weeks if you would. You aint paid for this so give others the same grace.

"Danseparc", "Mystery Walk", "Trance And Dance" & "This Is The Ice Age" albums are well worth hunting down if you like this.
