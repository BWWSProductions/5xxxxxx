The Dave Brubeck Quartet featuring the Bach Collegium Munich in concert in Frankfurt's Alte Oper on 13th November 2004. Brubeck presented a blend of jazz and classical music sometimes swinging, sometimes cool and jazzy. Fugues and the blues, waltzes and ragtime forge a unique alliance.


Enjoy and Seed!!
