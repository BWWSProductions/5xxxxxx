,wrgupta,2009-11-02T08:30Z,What the sense of uploading this torrent if the uploader isn't seeding???? 
[T],hjsn1,2009-11-02T12:23Z,There was a period of 1 minute and 30 seconds that I wasn't seeding.
,wrgupta,2009-11-04T00:58Z,"Here are five individual peers with 100% who ARE NOT seeding or has their Gnutella set to not seed, cause I'm not getting a darn thing from them:

Here they are with their IP Addresses: 
1- (AToulon-256-1-51-17.w86-219.abo.wanadoo.fr:10565); 

2- (dhcp-077-249-129-012.chello.nl:51029);

3- (99-57-41-134.lightspeed.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net:45670);

4- (c-98-223-114-244.hsd1.il.comcast.net:31113);

5- (c-98-201-156-120.hsd1.tx.comcast.net:39848);"

Sound direct and masterful .... 

And how can it be 'handled' as such ... do you have a special torrent client that allows you to control stuff the rest of us have no access to .... 

Or maybe you will find out where they live, and get them while theyre sleeping at night ?

Haaaaaaaaaa"

Its not the client, but everyone knows that you can be blocked from downloading with your ip address. It will make it a little harder for those people to download. And you don't know what I can do, so haaaa back."
,drtofuu,2012-03-17T02:41Z,Pleas seed. I count 15 leechers and not a single seed. It's been like this for a week at least. Thanks.
