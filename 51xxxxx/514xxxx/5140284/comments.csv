,datora,2010-06-23T02:14Z,"1st off: thank you for your effort & the upload.  Most of the video on this is stunning.

But, there was a disappointing amount of gradient & pixelization.  Granted -- its been through a lot of compression and large amounts of this movie are shot as very dark scenes ... so I don't really wish to badmouth your effort.  Just wanted to note it.  I watched several of extended edition Potter movies @900 MB file size (in *.mkv fomat), and the experience was generally more consistent and just about as good.

I had higher expectations for a 2.3 GB file ... so, maybe my bad (a bit).

However!

Thank you!  It was generally great & I apprec the effort! "
