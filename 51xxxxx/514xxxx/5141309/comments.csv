there's the subs for christ's sake. people can figure out how to download a torrent and block packet sniffing but they can't use google."
,lancedass,2009-11-02T03:42Z,"ugh. some wiseass put the subs up as ""rec 2 (2009)"" but when you look, they're plainly for part 1. 

fyi: the other versions of this outside the bay are lame ass promo copies that show random 5 minute bits in a loop with ""los downloading es moy ilegalo!"" messages thrown in. don't waste your time."
,Hakim_Bey,2009-11-06T03:14Z,"fyi, this copy is shot with a great cam, except that it keeps auto-focusing on dark scenes (that is, most of the movie)...
barely watchable imo..."
,tshirtkillen,2009-11-08T01:59Z,"lancedass: perhaps you should check whether or not those subs are legit before calling other people stupid. I have googled to my best abilities, but the only ones I've found have been Rec 1 subtitles, disguised as Rec 2 subtitles."
[T],Knaster,2009-11-08T06:29Z,lancedass probably has a lance up his arse
,lancedass,2009-12-03T03:00Z,"@Knaster that's the joke behind the name, you dumb cunt. did you really comment on a torrent just to say something that fucking retarded? how did an 11 year old get a pink skull anyway?"
,lancedass,2009-12-03T03:04Z,@tshirtkillen i did check the titles and then posted a retraction. it isn't my fault some fucktard posted fake subs and i have better things to do than google shit and validate srt files for you and the other lazy twats on here. jesus h christ - does your mommy still hold your fucking hand when you cross the street? 
,greaserjoe13,2009-12-05T00:29Z,"thank you sir,ive been tracking this film for a while now "
,urecord,2009-12-18T21:15Z,low quality
,paniky,2010-01-02T01:32Z,"hahah lancedass is hilarious :)
It makes a thicky mistake then becomes all angry.

""i have better things to do than google shit""

But it doesn't have better things to do then keep checking the comments on this film for a month :D
Biggest internet buffoon of the year."
[T],Knaster,2010-01-07T18:56Z,LOLZ the 11 year old here is you lancedass
,owtlawz,2010-01-09T22:09Z,"FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER THIS IS A BULLSHIT VERSION.


DONT DL .

THIS CUNTS GAY"
,EXiR0N,2010-01-11T16:50Z,"@lancedass, thats a fake sub anyway too. Thats the subtitle for rec 1. just some asshole have renamed it...."
,finski91,2010-01-12T00:31Z,no offence but where the hell is dvdrip ?!?? its a quite long time now. tha rec2 appeared to movies... i think there should be atleast r5 ready ?? its redicilous if we have to wait like six month to dvdrip... and btw.. proper terminator salvation torrent. it took months !!!! actually im not sure is there excellent rip even yet... 
,AzatiPrime,2010-01-25T05:06Z,"You're right, dammit!  Where's my free stuff?  I'm entitled to free high quality foreign movies that have been translated into my language!"
,NemesisNMC,2010-01-28T17:25Z,"R5 of a spanish movie? that has never happened, wont happen either. The DVD is set to release around half February in Spain. Tho if you really want to see it, you should of course go to the cinema.. Not that the movie is worth is (its kinda lame), but because the makers earn it.

Also stop talking shit about Lancedass, you're all blind fucks since he posted right afterwards that the subs were fakes..?"
[T],Knaster,2010-02-11T09:55Z,"NemesisNMC it was the way he said it first 

""there's the subs for christ's sake. people can figure out how to download a torrent and block packet sniffing but they can't use google. ""

Then after awhile he tested it. He should just have kept his mouth shut and say nothing but instead he made an ASS of himself. Do u see the irony?"
