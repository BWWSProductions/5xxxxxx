http://comicsearch.co.uk/forum/phpBB3/portal.php"
,oxbladder,2009-11-05T18:03Z,I have no idea why you cannot get the site we have been up for a few months now. Even old links should have worked because it would just redirect to the new location.

You should just be able to get to the site with ""www.comicsearch.co.uk"" and that is it.  I just tried it on several machines here at home and it works.  It takes you to the portal.  What OS are you using, which browser are you using, and have you tried clearing your browser cache?  Keep me and oxbladder posted."
