FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD I need to see this.

Please re-seed.

Thanks, eh."

,RexRexroth,2012-05-12T17:55Z,"Wow!  No action at all - zero - and then several hours later the entire torrent downloaded in a matter of minutes.  I will seed for a few days, at least.

I did some research and found that the session was taped in a studio on 18 March 2009.  Most of the material comes from ""Noble Beast.""

This, along with the 55 minute 14 April 2012 Coachella concert (you can get it on Demonoid), will make a great DVD!

Many, many thanks, klonger!"
