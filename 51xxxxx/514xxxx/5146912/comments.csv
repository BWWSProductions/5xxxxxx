,tcyca,2009-11-08T11:11Z,Please consider to do 720p again for all episodes start from S5E15.  The show will stop after November;  there probably won't be too many episodes left :'(. I really miss the large screen of high clarity.  Thanks for all your hard work in building this series of torrents.  :)
