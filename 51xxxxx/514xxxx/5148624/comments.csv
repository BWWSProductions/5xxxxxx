,mannetjes,2009-11-05T13:33Z,it isnt seedding 
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-05T13:39Z,Yes it is noob.
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-07T00:44Z,P.S.  Get a dictionary.
,movieaholic29,2009-11-24T22:54Z,"Hey just wanted to thank you for the great download , perfect quality!"
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-25T06:21Z,Thanks m8!  I appreciate the positive comment!
,Vyrate,2009-11-29T21:04Z,"this is a whole new species of slow-ass torrent.. shittest seeding ever unfortunately, because it would seem to be a fine quality torrent "
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-30T02:00Z,"@ Vyrate, FYI this is STILL seeding in my client, 24/7.  It's the jerk offs like you that take w/o giving, now how about you uploading something? Once again complaints from leechers that don't have a torrent uploaded, just bitching.  I'm looking forward to banning leechers from TPB."
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-30T02:18Z,"@ Everyone, If you're a noob, (and we all were at one time), fine, just make the effort to learn about seeding, creating torrents, etc..  The SuprBay is a great place to start: http://forum.suprbay.org/.  Once we upload a torrent and start seeding it's out of our control and up to YOU the downloaders to seed it in your client to a decent ratio.  I've been seeding this since it was uploaded and currently it has 94 seeders and 478 leechers, well WTF!  Of course it's slow!  It's 6.3 gigs and people are not seeding after their download is complete!  People like: mannetjes & Vyrate hit it & quit it.  The rest of you folks, thanks for the nice comments and seeding.  Peace."

Thanks."

[V],big_dad_e,2010-07-02T09:54Z,"@israelis_r_pigs 
No, I'm not Jewish.  Why the hate?  Is it because your mommy only likes circumcised men like your daddy does?  Piss off with your intolerence."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-07-08T02:25Z,"@israelis_r_pigs
Are you an asshole with teeth or a dick with ears? Trick question, you're both.

Peace be with you. I forgive your false witness against me. Again, I'm not Jewish but I don't hate them. You should pray for peace instead of war. God bless. "
