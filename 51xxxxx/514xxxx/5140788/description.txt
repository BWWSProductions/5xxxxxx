James Ford and Jas Shaw. Two men. Three letters. SMD. Electronic pioneers. DJs. Producers. Theyâ€™ve been tearing up dance-floors around the world for the past few years, but how did their story begin, and where will it endâ€¦?

Back in the late â€˜90s, James and Jas were studying folklore and physics respectively at Manchester University, while crafting strange electronic music in the spare room of their shared house. Although he eventually dropped out of his course, Jasâ€™s grounding in quantum physics was to come in useful later: the drum pattern on SMDâ€™s early white label PlayTits & Acid was based on matrix mechanics devised by Werner Heisenberg.
