"Throughout their career, Basement Jaxx have walked a tightrope between absolutely brilliant ('Rendez-Vous', 'Romeo') and bloody annoying ('Where's Your Head At?', 'U Don't Know Me'). Their last single 'Raindrops' was much nearer the former. A banging summer anthem featuring the cleverly vocodered vocals of bandman Felix Buxton, it avoided the air of joyless genre-hopping that blights the Brixton duo.

Follow-up 'Feelings Gone' edges closer to the other end of the spectrum, being a slice of fairly unremarkable dance-pop with little to differentiate it from a million other club hits. The Jaxx's conveyor belt of guest singers can lead to coldness and a lack of identity, but funnily enough it saves them here. The vocal acrobatics of 'Black And Gold' star Sam Sparro are quirky enough to keep things interesting as he soars, squeaks and squalls his way through this track."
