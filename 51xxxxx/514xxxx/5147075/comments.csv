,marcIIII,2009-11-04T15:04Z,Thats just one sick gay who post shit like that  give us a pic where you die instead so we can piss on your ugly sick braine
,sickert1888,2009-11-04T16:02Z,"See marc3, you're starting to get a feel for it. pretty soon you will be jerking off thinking about pissing on smashed brains and the like. ( not quite MY thing, but to each their own and all that.) and good point about the pussy hair frank.......studies will need to be done....i'll get right on that."
,easton29,2009-11-04T21:37Z,"God, you are such a fucking weird asshole. 

People like you prove evolution happened, and indeed, we are nothing but animals. 

Odd, I accept all of that, but have no interest in looking at dead people. Thats because my brain and logic operations are intact, unlike yours and your sick seeding fucktard friends. 

Have a good one."
,tdatb,2009-11-05T07:33Z,"""One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss
We met last night making love under the refrigerator light
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms

One thing
No lie
Ethyl's frigid as an eskimo pie
She's cool in bed
Well she oughta be 'cuz Ethyl's dead

Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Come on Cold Ethyl
Freeze me babe

One thing - it's true
Cold Ethyl I am stuck on you
And everything is my way
Ethyl don't have much to say

Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Come here Cold Ethyl
What makes you so cold? Ooh so cold

Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
If I live 'til ninety-seven
You'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven
'cuz you're cool
You're on ice
Cold Ethyl
You're my paradise""

Alice Cooper says it all, hunh???"
