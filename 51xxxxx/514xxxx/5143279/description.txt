o3(ozone) is the first and in my mind best album from Sunscreem. "Ten Mile Bank" is also an outstanding work which is well worth downloading.

Whether in a club, bar or home with headphones, this is classic techno/house at its' best, a genre at which we Brits excel. To say I love it is an understatement.

The usual bollox about seeding, you got this free so leave it on for a while, or if there's less than a dozen, so others can do the same. BE NICE.
