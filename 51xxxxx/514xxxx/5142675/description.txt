There is nothing more to be added. These interpretations (as many others of the same pianist) are just perfect. 

I had the great luck to listen to Brendel in Rome some years ago, he played Schubert and for me it was like what happened with Beethoven: I rediscovered these extraordinary composers. Brendel makes you appreciate the sensitivity of each artist he approaches. 

You cannot miss him. 



Enjoy and Seed!!
