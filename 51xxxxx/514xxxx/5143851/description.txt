"You Should have to die". New trends are pushing people away from being more tolerant and into new creative types of hate. If you've been smoking cigarettes for the past 20 years then you should pay attention to whats going on now, a new law may be passed that allows people to kill you for something you've done in the past. 


These two videos are for smokers, so if you believe people should have some freedom thats ok you can hear these too; but, if you are one of the people who think "we should kill thoes we disagree with" than no need to see these. These types of videos are not allowed on y-outube and are constantly removed even thought no legal dmca complaint can be made against them.
