Tim Allen once again dons the Santa suit in the role of Santa Claus in the third installment of the story about an advertising executive who is transformed into Santa Claus.

Tim Allen reprises his role of Scott Calvin-aka Santa as he juggles a full house of family and the mischievous Jack Frost (Martin Short), whose chilling Santa envy has him trying to take over the "big guy's" holiday.
At the risk of giving away its secret location, Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman (Ann-Margret and Alan Arkin) to the North Pole to share in the holiday festivities and be near their daughter, Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell)-aka Mrs. Claus- as she prepares for the eagerly anticipated birth of baby Claus.

Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause, is the ultimate Christmas DVD to own and to give. Featuring an all-new bonus feature, Christmas Carol-Oke - a fun-for-all Christmas Caroling guide for the entire family to enjoy.
