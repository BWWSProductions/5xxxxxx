Hey guys, so I'm sitting here at a coffee shop uploading the playlist. Ran into some problems with my internet at home so I had to cut the playlist off short. Still managed to upload 100+ songs. Hope you guys enjoy.

Congrats to daKradha on winning the shirt this month.

Next month I will be uploading a December playlist along with a best of 09. If you guys could please email your top 10 songs from each month to joshblalock@gmail.com it would help out so much.

Expect another playlist on the 15th. The community playlist was completed and I'll be uploading everyones selections. If you guys would like to take part on the next one just go to the community playlist section on www.BlalocksIRP.com
