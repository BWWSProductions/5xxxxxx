,arvind_sampath,2010-03-02T19:16Z,"Thanks a lot for this album!
Well, there are quite a few people (me included) who are from outside Korea, but really love the music of ??,??:??? !
I've also been listening to Han Beom-Su, Heo Yong-Eop and Kang Young-geun?s Piri, which I just can't get enough of. Same goes for anything on the taepyongso!
Maybe you won't believe me, but I registered here just so I could post thank you notes to your uploads, and say hello; that's how excited I am to find these albums here! They're really very valuable!
There's lots more we need to talk about, and I have some things I want to share with you. Maybe you saw my message in another post, where I left my email address. I'd appreciate it if you could write to me, or give me some way to contact you. Cheers!"
,arvind_sampath,2010-03-02T19:21Z,"Sorry, I meant to say that I really love Kim Seok-Chul's music in my last message, but I wrote it in Korean, and looks like it wasn't accepted. "
,iheartu,2010-03-06T12:10Z,"Kim Seok Chul is amazing. I'll upload some more of his stuff, and more taepyeongso stuff too, in the near future. "
,loosegrip,2011-03-19T21:23Z,"I agree with Arvind - your uploads have been a godsend to me since most of this stuff is unavailable on CD or anywhere on the web. I would really love to have a listen to this Kim Seok Chul recording and many more by him. Any chance you could start an MP3 blog to post this stuff?
thanks!!!"
,loosegrip,2011-03-19T21:26Z,I registered just to post comments as well. Any chance of getting some english translations for some of these recordings?
