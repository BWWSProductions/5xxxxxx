Sorry about track 2--don't know what happened there. Anyways, awesome CD! Amazing Coltrane-like taepyeongso playing by Kim Seok-Chul. Kick-ass percussion. Listen at full volume!

Apologies to those who don't read Korean, but if you can't read Korean, you probably won't know who these guys are anyways. 

If you dig this, I'll upload other stuff by the same group. Also shaman music from other parts of Korea.
