Some wonderful person uploaded TWO excellent documentaries.

One on Cuban right wing terrorists, close to the CIA and Bush family.  They planted a bomb and blew a civilian jet out of the sky, simply because a young Cuban fencing team was onboard.  A Communist fencing team.  (Cruelty meant to simply hurt and grieve Cubans and any allies.)

Two, the riot and sniper shootings in Caracas, Venezuela which preceded the attempted coup against Chavez.  Chavez is not even communist, but even a whiff of socialism deserves physical annihilation.

(Some of the victims were the right wing establishment who were 'sacrificed' for the larger goal of anti-Chavez public outrage and the pre-planned coup.)

Both vids have lots of eyewitness testimony, important camera shots and video, documentation, testimony, legal rulings, etc.

The original upload was two very large DVD Iso files @ 2-4GB apiece. I feel that is unnecessary bulk for the fairly low-fi quality of the images.  I used DVDx v2.3 to convert each to MP4 (Xvid) under 700MB, with audio at 128kbps.

NOW GET THEM BOTH IN less than 1/4 the time and space.

Both can easily be burned to a single DVD using DeVeDe or DVDFlick free programs.

PLEASE SEED.
