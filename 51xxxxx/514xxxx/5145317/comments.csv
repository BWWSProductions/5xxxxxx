,Screamokid,2010-01-26T01:07Z,"Soo... I downloaded this movie thinking it had the frame rate of 55Fps, it's frame rate is only 23. The video quality in general is VERY bad.

If it was SD, I'd give it a 7.5 but according to the title, I'll give it a 6. Audio on the other hand is good. But next time, if you're going to include the frame rate, check the frame rate before hand.

One more issue, You need to include A LOT more."
