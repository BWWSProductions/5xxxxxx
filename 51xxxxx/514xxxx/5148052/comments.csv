,cclloyd,2009-11-06T23:08Z,English only.  And it worked for me (at least all the x32 bits) worked.
,Monkeymusic,2009-11-10T00:00Z,"x32 Ultimate worked for me. The only language is English. But, after installing Windows Update will offer you to install any of 35 other language packs."
,gfxfxs,2009-11-10T05:45Z,"Hopefully the 64 bit will work, will let ya know once I get finished with the dl."

,ers2258,2009-11-22T01:21Z,I have a new Notebook with Windows 7 Home Premium Pre-installed by HP. Can I use this to Upgrade to the Ultimate Version?
,cclloyd,2009-11-24T21:11Z,Yes.  You just have to follow the instructions in the description.
,Knight_Hawk,2009-11-24T22:58Z,This works amazing thanks alot!
,cclloyd,2009-11-27T05:17Z,"Yes.  during the install, after you choose which kind of install you want to do (upgrade or custom), it will list all versions, both x32 and x64.  Thats when you choose the one you want.

,cnyc09,2009-12-10T06:35Z,"Works great. How can I add files to the ISO. I tried drag/drop in MagicISO but during the setup I receive an error ""Windows could not collect information for [OSImage] since the specified image file [install.wim] does not exist."" Trying to add folder with 7Loader v1.5 and a few other files so I will have one DVD with everything needed for clean install.   

thanks "
,cclloyd,2009-12-10T22:58Z,"i think what you need to do is extract everything in it into a folder, add the folder u want (add in the sources folder to be safe) then delete everything in the ISO, and then add everything u want including the original iso files back into it then u can try.

And suggsetion... Use 7Loader 1.7.  I have it upped.  Look on my profile for it."
,maddo277,2010-02-24T19:00Z,64 bit Home Premium  works on mine thank you this is the real thing

,reklesskelly,2010-05-14T02:00Z,i downloaded and it installed great. my problem is when i use 7loader from your list of torrents.  When i restart the computer it wont boot windows anymore.  Keeps restarting over and over.  Acting like there isnt any OS.
