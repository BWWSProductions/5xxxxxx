  "Hit with Music"

  "Hit with Music" Is an improve audio collaboration between Isaac A Boatright (Waxin' Wary) and K Nelson (the 486 kid) working together under the studio name Hag Force circa 2002.

  This album was a work created primarily upon an Intel i486DX4 100mhz DOS computer running Fast Tracker II on 8 Megs of RAM. All audio samples other than those waveforms that were hand drawn were recorded analog to digital with the use of a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro sound card. Also in the studio a Roland SH-101 analog monophonic synthesizer along with Roland TR-606 and TR-808 drum machines, circuit bent Texas Instruments "Speak 'n' Spell", and Atari 1040STe running C-Lab Notator.  

  Each track on this album was developed through a process of improve, using techniques that the duo collaboratively developed between 1994 and 2002. The results are a unique one of a kind underground electronic album with a free spirited grooving feel.  From the melding of Waxin' Wary's Dark Circus Dirge, to 486's funky syncopated house and electro is Hag Forces's debut, Hit me with Music!
