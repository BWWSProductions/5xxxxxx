,erush,2009-11-06T23:45Z,"Spent about five hours looking for a torrent for the Psystar Rebel EFI, but to no avail. Thanks to uploader for this file. 

However, tried to use it on my Toshiba Satellite A60/A65 Series. Doesn't seem to want to work for me, it gets stuck look for a plist file. Anyone know how to fix this, or is my Toshiba unable to use this program in order to run Mac OS X. Thanks for any info. anyone can give me. "
,FaloopaJones,2009-11-15T10:47Z,"Meh - I've got a Dell Vostro A90 (the ""business edition"" of the Dell Mini 9) and the NetBookInstaller 0.8.3 and Leopard worked a lot better. This one DID install Snow Leopard, but I got multiple kernel panics and once I got past that I still had sound/WiFi issues.

I need a copy of the REAL Pystar RebelEFI loader to try that. Until then, I'm sticking with the NBI 0.8.3 and Leopard."
