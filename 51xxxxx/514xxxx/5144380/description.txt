Black Moon (1975)

Writer & Director: Louis Malle
Additional Dialogues: Joyce BuÃ±uel
Cinematography: Sven Nykvist
Lily: Cathryn Harrison
Old Lady: ThÃ©rÃ¨se Giehse
Brother Lily: Joe Dallesandro
Sister Lily: Alexandra Stewart

Lily drives down a lonesome road and soon finds herself in an alternate world full of non sequiturs and bizarre characters. At times, this looks like a David Lynch film, with an old woman conversing with a rat, a pack of naked children chasing a pig, a talking unicorn, a strange set of possibly incestuous siblings, and several other warped set pieces. Malle reportedly culled inspiration for the narrative of this film from his own dreams.
