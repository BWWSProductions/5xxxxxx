Plea to Release Groups - Release more stuff encoded in H264 Standard Def.
30 min TV show less than 100 Mb, 1 Hr TV show less than 200Mb, Movies 250-500 Mb.
All near DVD quality same as Divx/Xvid.
Why not release 2 versions of everything, one standard size, one small?
For the many with limited bandwidth or slower connections (3G, basic DSL, lowest tier cable).
Check out Blueman's stuff. Thanks!"
