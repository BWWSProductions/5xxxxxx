[V],polisdavid,2009-11-06T23:42Z,"Hi RanaBlu,

The keygen is subtle, it doesn't even seem to do anything.  Then once you open up BBEdit and go the about you'll see it's been [K]rack'd"
,RanaBlu,2009-11-07T11:32Z,"Keygen says something like ""bus error"" to me. Have to launch it form a particular folder?"

,florin_mol,2011-05-22T09:12Z,"the keygen works but although I've unchecked the automatic update option the application gets banned from time to time. It's becoming annoying that if you open 3-4 pages you have to open the keygen and input another serial through terminal.

Does anyone know how to stop the app from connecting itself to the update servers?"
