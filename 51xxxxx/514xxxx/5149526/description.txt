Each employee within an organization puts forth discretionary EFFORT; they come to work with a choice of how much effort they are willing to give their company. An engaged employee is a person who is fully involved in, and enthusiastic about, his or her work. These employees care about the future of the organization and feel a strong emotional bond to the business.

How can an organization create an environment that truly engages its employees in order for the company to flourish?

Employee Engagement outlines a comprehensive framework, language, and process that genuinely helps CEOs and business executives connect their overall "Business" strategy with the human resource, OD, and performance improvement professionals who are responsible for developing the organization's "People" strategy.
