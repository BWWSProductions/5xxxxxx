

Jay-Z's Renegade collection is the first best-of comp of Jigga's career -
though there's reportedly talk of another coming in November - so Jay-Z
sticks to the hits. Eminem, however, opts for deeper cuts and rarities from
his arsenal, including a brand new song called "Taking My Ball" that will
feature exclusively on the DJ Hero Renegade disc. Both rappers hand-selected
their respective track lists.

"The tracks we put on this disc are mostly overlooked or rarer favorites of
mine from all different parts of my career," Eminem said. "I also put a
brand new, unheard song on there so even the biggest fan has something new."
DJ Hero and DJ Hero Renegade Edition will both be released October 27th,
but Slim Shady fans can hear "Taking My Ball" October 16th when the track
debuts on Em's Sirius radio station Shade45. In addition to the game itself
and the dual hits compilations, DJ Hero Renegade will feature a premium
Renegade turntable controller and a hardshell turntable carrying case
that converts into a DJ stand.
