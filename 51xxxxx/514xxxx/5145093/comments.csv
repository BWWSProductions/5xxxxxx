,Osorcon,2010-06-10T22:44Z,there is telegram???
,TrashTT,2010-08-02T09:55Z,"Telegram is a remix album and not a standard studio album, hence the title ""complete studio discography"" and not just ""complete discography"". On a side note, three question marks is a bit over kill. ;]"

Thanks!"
,@ll!h@,2011-05-29T22:09Z,"""FLAC is the way to go. Bad sound kills good music!"" mp3 with a bitrate of 320 is just as fine in quality, IN SUCH A SMALLER SIZE. the good thing about flac, is that is free, first off, and lossless. As the name may imply, but the files are just waaaay too big.  

Anywaysss... Great upload! :D Thanks a lot mate! "
,TrashTT,2011-06-27T00:20Z,"No doubt, 360 kbps is good, but FLAC is ideal. I like to keep it that way. Ideal."
,gaaraisgod3,2011-12-12T20:08Z,"FLAC is better if you're going to burn CDs :D

I only need Debut and Post but thanks for the entire thing."

So true. MP3 is soo last century. 
Flac is good. Flac 24/96-192 is better. So far I only found Medulla (sacd iso)...

So stupid, I have everything of Bjรถrk on CD AND LP but no flacs for streaming... and this torrent is still alive :)
Tnx ppl!"
