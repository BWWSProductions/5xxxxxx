,invioletlight,2011-05-31T22:00Z,"Thanks to the uploader, I love Tegan and Sara even though I usually listen to Hard Rock or metal. They have such beautiful voices and so many of the songs have meaningful lyrics to me. It downloaded in under an hour for me - what a wonderful collection of hidden gem music!"

,nosniboD,2012-04-02T14:42Z,"Yo guys, mikegasm here. Changed my email and now I've forgotten my password on here, just wanted to say this was my first torrent so I was a little shocked at how fast it seeded (I downloaded it to check the speed) and that I guess you're welcome.

Also feel the need to say that, if you can, go and see them live. I have. Great experience and they get more of a chunk of that money than if you bought their albums. "
