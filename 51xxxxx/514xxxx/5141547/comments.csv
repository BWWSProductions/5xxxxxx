,StefanGavrila,2009-10-31T19:35Z,"Thank you for the torrent, I've been wanting to play this game for a long time and now that I've played it I can summarize it in 2 words: IT SUCKS! This port at least is awful.

The is a resource hog and worst thing is that you can't even change the video settings to match you PC. Making a game for the PC and locking the video settings is like shooting yourself in the foot, my PC is quite good and the game still runs at under 20 fps most of the time and if I should ever use force powers to break some of the environment the frame rate drops to about 1-2 fps until the debris disappear. Even when the game runs smooth it feels slow and boring.

After waiting to play it so much I have to say it's a disappointment. For me this port feels like it's been made just to get some extra cash from the PC fan-base instead of delivering on the fans expectations.

Score: 3/10"

,jacmiszcz92,2009-11-01T11:34Z,Is there Polish language?
,Amaximus,2009-11-01T11:44Z,Well a Geforce 9800 GT is recommended (not minimal) so it will prolly work for you but be slower the frame rate. When there is a lot of stuff going on it can get really slow....so you can play if you're not too fussy....you can get a new 9800 GT now for 100$ by the way...

,illusive88,2009-11-03T20:19Z,Either crack is wrong(tried new one too) or this game is really awful ported. 5 mins after i start playing game start skipping both sound and video. I have Win 7 on quard core 2.0 q9000 GTX 280M GPU and 4Gb DDR3. So i guess my pc is quite sufficent to play it. But its unplayable with my pc. I'd say just wait for an offical patch(or maybe 2-3 patches) to play that crap.

,hercrow,2009-11-05T11:39Z,"Geforce 9600 GT is sufficient to play this.
@brenoseifert: you can change the graphics settings in a separate program in the folder where the game's exe is. it is called ""settings.exe"" or ""configure.exe"" or something like that. you change the settings there and then you run the game itself."
,baotica,2009-11-05T12:39Z,"Ok people. I have played this crapy game for about two hours, and I can say that this game is truly piece of crap.

And here is why
1.I resent the hype that creators were giving us.
2. 24GB of space, come on, that is just bad and lazy ass console to PC porting
3.It's fucking dull, just hack and slash, and loads of it.
4.when you die the fucking game sets you back like 5 minutes, and that is fucking too long.This is a game killer for me, I'm not gonna loose time like that.
5.graphic is pretty good, but not 24GB good.And you cannot change it.WTF.I have quad core on 3Ghz and 8800GT 512MB, and game runs smooth with no glitches, but not everybody owns config like me.
6.Oh yeah, last but not the least.When you slash someone with your saber, it's like you are hiting them with a club, not a laser that would cut of limbs or dissecting body parts, blood flying.What kind of shit is that, I'll tell you what kind, censorship kind shit for kiddies.Game killer also.

If you like star wars play KOTOR 1 and 2, or star wars academy, at least it's not dull.Just skip this, it's hack and slash for kiddies (7-12). "
,Gaids,2009-11-05T17:00Z,seed PLS!!!!
,Andreeystyle,2009-11-06T00:40Z,"@ baotica

No one really cares about your comment!
If people wanna play this game and really like star wars they should give it a try, and not complain about it if u really dont like the controlls buy the game in CONSOL FFS!
I mean people have different choises of games.."
,misfisk,2009-11-06T02:29Z,"OK, ready for some positive comments on this game? :P First, let's get the obvious out of the way:

1: 24GB is a bit much, but just clear the space for it and uninstall after you've played it, if it's bothering you.

2: Graphics are really great, but it is very annoying that you can't adjust the advanced settings.

3: The controls can be a bit sloppy at times, but nothing out of the ordinary.

HOWEVER:
I've just finished playing the whole game, and I can promise all the other fans of the Jedi Knight series, that while it's not as good as any of those, it's extremely entertaining, much more destructive, and most definitely worth a play-through. There are some great scenes, and the technologies you get to play with are a great deal of fun. My experience was all in all very positive.

I have an early 2008 MacBook Pro:
2,5 Intel Core Duo
GeForce 8800 512 MB
3GB RAM

And at 800x600 (widescreen mode), it ran smoothly. Except for a few second in the beginning of some stages.

I didn't actually check the other resolutions provided, because I got so caught up in it, I didn't even notice :P"
,misfisk,2009-11-06T02:53Z,"And you get a great perspective on the story between episode 3 and 4 of the Star Wars films. The game feels very authentic and loyal to the universe, with everything from background music to animation.. I'm still a little hyped, I guess :P 

But mostly because people can't stop talking shit about this game, even when it's such a good experience, even for the nostalgic fans of the trilogy, such as myself."
,Dropastone,2009-11-06T17:19Z,Installed great but I get to a certain part and the game crashes.  When I get the part in the beginning where you have to force pull a platform down and then pull a beam out of a wall to jump up to that level where there are some storm troopers waiting for you and it crashes. If anybody knows of a fix that would be great.
,killtime101,2009-11-06T17:22Z,Dropastone it also crashes at the same spot for me. 
,lopar,2009-11-06T17:32Z,for me it crashed at the same spot...however a few reloades later I could get passed this point.....only to be crash-stuck after the first AT-ST fight...damn
,Jandaa,2009-11-06T17:47Z,"My game crashes when you just saved some general dude then comes cinematics where you walk into the ship and you see the dude what you saved and the pilot and thats it.. i can't get past the cinematics, i tried like 15 times. :D"

,SweRaider,2009-11-06T22:33Z,"I'am actually not that fond of console ports, they tend to be unplayable but this? I'am having a really great time playing this on pc, until I got to the lvl where to pull a certain object out of a wall to jump on, just ctd there everytime, guess we'll have to wait for another crack. lucasarts though should deffinetly go for another jedi knight sequel, would have been epic and deffinetly a buy"

,spartanerik,2009-12-24T07:32Z,"Okay guys, just to be nice I'll write a nice comprehensive guide.

1. Download this torrent.
2. Use virtual CD/DVD mounting software (Daemon Tools Lite or Slysoft Virtual Clone Drive) and create two virtual drives.
3. Mount both ISOs (don't know how to mount? use Google)
4. Run the installer located on the first ISO
5. Let it install.
6. When prompted, it will ask for the second ISO
7. Using the window that pops up, browse to the second virtual drive with the second ISO mounted
8. Resume installing
9. Once installed, download and install the 1.1 patch: http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/51334/Star-Wars-The-Force-Unleashed-Ultimate-Sith-Edition-PC-Patch-v1-1-Released

This patch has MANY, and I mean MANY bugfixes.  Many parts of the game will freeze in specific areas without this patch!
10. Once the patch is installed, go to gamecopyworld and get the patched EXE for version 1.1 of SWTFU:USE
11. Download the patched EXE, and copy it over the original SWTFU.exe located wherever you installed the game
12. Unmount your ISOs, disable your virtual drives
13. Delete the ISOs if you wish (I keep backups)
14. Play the game!

Note: To play the Hoth, Tatooine, and Jedi Temple bonus levels, you must create a new game BUT make sure it is saved to an empty slot and not your existing one.

Have fun everyone."
,spoondawg,2009-12-24T07:48Z,"Dowloading at a whopping 2.9kb/s on a 20mg connection while upping @ 4mb/s... real fair... Leechers put in your worth or go use IRC, limewire or some other trash that will ruin your computer to prevent you from contaminating the internet any more than you people are."

Installed this torrent, did NOT apply the crack.

Downloaded v1.1 multi-5 crack from gamecopyworld.com
Did NOT install any crack fixes

OK now download patch v1.1 i got the official patch european english version [and it works] from Gamershell.com 

NOTE; Installing the game and patch takes long so be patient.

NOW the last thing. Go to Gamecopyworld.com download ST Force Unleashed Sith edition crack and paste it in your game folder!

MY opinion is; this game is poorly made it DOESNT have any game options resolution and that kind of things. THIS SUX BALLZ.  The game is still rather fun to play.  6 / 10

,Jollefjoll,2010-01-08T17:23Z,"I'll have to say, there's something strange with this release, whether it's a bad game or not. I played it for awhile, I put up with the bad graphics. I thought there was a possibility to change them via the launcher, but you can't even launch the launcher - it just crashes. And when I checked the controls, a Xbox controller was shown. I dunno if it's supposed to be like that, but it feels like its a rip of a xbox game or sumthing. Anyhow - I didn't experience during my gameplay that I got stuck at any place. HOWEVER towards the end, the game started crashing without reason alot...... 
So I wouldn't recommend this... sorry mates."
,KillerHaze,2010-01-08T19:11Z,"Finally got the game downloaded few days ago and I am still seeding.. so far got 23gb uploaded! hope helps u guys..

This Torrent WORKS.. I played through the campaign on apprentice difficulty, now I'm goin to the next step.

For all the people who say it crashes or doesn't work.. maybe you guys need to upgrade your system or check drivers. Because this absolutely 100% works no problem. It has never crashed on me.

My Specifications:

Windows7 Ultimate 64bit Edition
4GB DDR2 RAM
1Gb NVidia GeForce 9500GT

Looks very very nice on a 22""lcd, but it kind of slows down the graphics at highest resolution.. so I used 1280x800 which kept the full wide screen effect with no bog-downs..

Anyways.. for those waiting a long time for the game.. like myself.. keep waiting! It's a pretty good game.. story was alright.. cutscenes were good.. Graphics could have been a lot better.. and the gaming it self was fun throwing people around lol... and the combos were cool executing.. the game was a bit short! :("

can anyone explain this?"
,sringram,2010-01-08T22:23Z,"Essentially, this is the collector's edition that we didn't see last year, coupled with all of the available downloadable content and a brand-new exclusive level. For the retail price you'll get the original game, the Jedi Academy, Tatooine and Hoth levels, all of the downloadable skins, a collector's card and a nice tin case to hold it all in. 

Please let me know if this has those last three levels since thats the only reason i sat through this long ass download was because i'm too poor too buy the addons for my Xbox360."

,therevenger91,2010-01-15T04:23Z,great game on xbox 360 or ps3 but dont bother with the pc version unless your system is bangin on all cylinders you need at lease a geforce 9600 vid card for the graphics to run smooth on a low resolution and a 2.5 GHz dual core processor with adequate cooling it really is a good game though the requirements for pc are just to heavy for most intermediate users

And well , It wasnt really Badass..

I just upgraded to HD4890 1gb , And you cant even compare both cards

,Quantum12,2010-03-04T18:51Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."

,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-18T19:50Z,"Buschmanmat.... you're a moron. If you don't like waiting then go buy the game... I have NEVER not one time EVER complained about seeders or leechers because I am getting the games for FREE. Not everyone wants to keep Utorrent running on their computer 24/7 to help assholes like you. Not everyone has over 600 GB's to have to co[pies of the same game taking up two times as much spae as it should....

When I DL a game I leave it in Utorrent for about a week seeding and then I delete torrent and torrent data to free up the (in this case) 14 GB's that are just their because of the images...

ESPECIALLY when there are Rars involved... say this game had Rars you would have 14 GB worth of rars and once you extract it that's another 14 GB for the image and then when you install it it's ANOTHER 14 GB to have the game on your computer.... I delete the rars after seeding for a week and depending on how much I want to save the game on my computer I delete the image (unless you need the image to play the game ie Dragon Age)

If you're that worried about not getting your FREE game in 2 days rather than 4 then either buy the game or open your port for Utorrent...... If you want to load up your PC with useless GB's then by all means go right for it buddy but I can bet you that a lot of the people who come to this site come here because they cannot afford the game which would imply that their rig isn't top of the line which means not everyone has the ability to have n image taking up 14 GB's of space on their computer when it doesn't need to be.

And I SURE AS HELL won't sacrifice precious GB's to please your ass fucker... "
