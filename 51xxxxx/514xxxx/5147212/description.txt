Wheeler dealer Mike Brewer has gone and bought his most extravagant car yet, a 1974 Ferrari Dino. Spending almost double the usual budget he has a lot riding on this project.

With the car in mechanic Eddâ€™s hands he has already fixed the exterior panels to get it looking its best but now he has to check it will run to its full V8 capacity and thatâ€™s where a couple of the problems lie.
