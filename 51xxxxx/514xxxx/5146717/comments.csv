,gyaradon,2009-12-24T03:05Z,"So, how would I do this now, from a drive? Would I leave the image there, or extract it, or what?"
,Sdraer,2010-01-08T22:09Z,"Worked fantastically well on my old Dell XPS 420.  I haven't got the video card to work properly yet (Nvidia 9800gt) but I am sure the nvidia kext will fix that.


Tips:  

0. The file is a Mac dmg (disc image).  If you are not on a Mac you will need Magiciso or similar to burn it.  This copy looks pretty good:

1. You will need a bootloader CD, I used the latest Empire EFI by Prasys.  You can google it, it is dated about jan 7, 2010. version 1.085, I think.

prasys dot co dot cc slash tag slash empire-efi slash

2. press F12 during the dell boot screen and make your cd boot priority number 1.

3. Wait a fair while for empire EFI to boot and then follow the prompts to insert and run the snow leo for XPS 410 DVD.

NOTE:  I used a Hard Disk Drive that was already setup as a mac disk (formatted using a real mac.  This may have helped the process.

Good luck.

PS I will seed ALAP (As Long As Possible)
