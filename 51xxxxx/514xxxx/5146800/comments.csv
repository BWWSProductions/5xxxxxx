V?s first episode pretty much revealed most things Globalist, and that was just the first episode.  The Globalists are literally rubbing our noses in how they manipulate us by airing a tv show on how humans are manipulated.  It?s a big sick joke and you and I are the punch-line.

And the truth is, according to the elite scums ?ethics? they must let us little peons aware of what they will do beforehand.Media is their best outlet.

it?s like two warriors meeting on the battlefield, trying to psych each other out. ?this is what i?ll do to you. and this?and this!? if you can get your opponent to buy into the image of his own doom, the deed is as good as done.

In V Humans are being invaded by a hostile culture of control freaks bent on carrying out their operations of Global domination to their ultimate endgame, mass genocide?  Funny how art imitates life."
,zen-TAO,2009-11-05T05:45Z,"Pretty good episode.

But why the choise of
leading actors?

Joel Gretsch (""Taken"", ""The 4400"") as Father Jack Landry and Elizabeth Mitchell (""Lost"") as FBI-agent Erica Evans are not the ""best"" actors for this. 

I think they both are kind of ""stiff"" in their acting.

I think that the TV-networks in US are
""afraid"" to choose new and unknown 
actors for leading characters instead
of these two who seems to have 
been ""stuck"" in the sci-fi-genre...

Peace and Love!

,k9dog,2009-11-06T00:53Z,Have been looking forward to this show. I remember the original show got me glued to the screen. Saw that V was going to premiere on ABC a couple of days ago in another series from eztv. Thanks to eztv btw for making these shows available here in europe in high quality original versions that most local networks never would be able to provide.
,therealjdb,2009-11-06T02:13Z,"Lol, I just watched the entire original series. I hope this can live up to the name."
,nimby2,2009-11-06T02:20Z,"This torrent doesn't download for me. I've been trying with Transmission for 24 hours, but not one byte has downloaded. Stats show more than 10,000 seeders, 3300 leechers. 
I know my connection is working, because another torrent is downloading right now.

Any insights or suggestions? Thanks!"

[S],velvet.,2009-11-07T08:04Z,"You only need to add one working tracker, this one:

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

Fragmenting a torrent swarm across multiple trackers is counterproductive.

If you really believe that having a lot of trackers listed in a torrent makes a difference, then you should also be prepared to believe that if you owned a lot of telephone books, then that would cause the people you call on the telephone to talk faster."
