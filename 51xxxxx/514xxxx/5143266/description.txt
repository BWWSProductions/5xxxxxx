O.K. then, describing cranes sound? ? ? Similar to Portishead?

Somewhat haunting?  Relaxing?  Hypnotic? Melodic? ? ?

Their music has been described as incorporating elements of Gothic rock, Dream pop, and Shoegazing. What the hell's that last one about? NME likened the voice of Allison to that of "a beautiful siren being slowly strangled on a spiral staircase of hammer-horror guitars". I'm not really sure that's a compliment, but whichever, I love the voice, I love the music, I love the sound.

To hell with it. Just download a track and see if you like it, then do the rest. My favourite, for what it's worth, is everywhere, as I bought the album on the strength of it. That was back in the days when British music programs broadcast innovative and original music instead of all that repetitive factory R 'n' B or pretty group stuff as they do now. Enough bitching!
