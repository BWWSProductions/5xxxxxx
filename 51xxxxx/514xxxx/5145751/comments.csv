,b737-500,2009-11-16T17:03Z,"mariotc777
First you will need to install update 0609, make phone activation with the code R00D-KCAB and then install the latest jeppview update. The code will not worl for updates later then 0609."
,Nitrox_Diver,2009-11-17T18:19Z,"A couple of questions:

If I have legal copy of Flitestar installed and convert this navdata to that Flitestar format, do I need any more serials or is it just plug and play?
Can I covert this nvdata cycle to Flitestar format and what should the .iso be named to?"
,guntar,2009-11-21T13:37Z,How do you get the serials? are they in the setup.inx file? or where are them?
,Guz28,2009-11-21T18:35Z,you can get the serials in the zip file
,guntar,2009-11-22T09:08Z,"Sure, but I'm talking about to extract the serials from the original CDs"
