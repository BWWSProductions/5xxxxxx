,SeaSpur,2009-12-18T03:19Z,"okay I made my previous comment BEFORE finishing the download...about 15% percent into the download, I had MAJOR problems. It activated a virus called VirusScan Live that ""faked"" searching for malware and wanted me to purchase their software. It blocked my personal antivirus software and prevented me from other security functions.

Do NOT download!

To uploader- if this was not intentional, please scan file and fix issues- then reupload!"
