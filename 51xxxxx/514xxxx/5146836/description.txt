Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3
Rip+Edit mg56

11/02/09 Rundown: World Series, Football, Happy Costume Day,
Ant's Party, John and Kate, Taxes, DirecTV ads, The Virus,
DUI call, Reverend Al, Warren Haynes live in-studio.

Note: Another "they went to break and never came back" show.



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
