,broozteer,2009-11-13T20:37Z,"Does anyone know a good fix to this game. 
My game crashes at the opening cinematic.

If anyone know a way to fix this problem then i would be glad to hear it. 

"
,johnmacess,2009-11-14T04:07Z,"Shroo please 
Can you create the path1.1 pack for it?"
,Wumpus108,2009-11-15T20:48Z,"Game works fine for me so far, but the low volume and lack of voices in the cutscenes is a breaker for me. I saw Shroo wrote that the voices are there, but not reading. Hopefully this can be fixed! If not I'll have to DL the bigger version. Anyway, TPTB releases have always been great for me, and the 50% video downgrade is standard. Never knew it to mess with the audio though. I know subtitles can be turned on in the menu, but I want to hear the characters. "
,Wumpus108,2009-11-15T20:49Z,Also the 1.1 update has optimizations. Hopefully than can be worked on as well because the game is pretty poor on that front even with a great machine. (Which I have.)
,freezerburn666,2009-11-16T22:03Z,"i tried this and had audio issues, and the patch 1.1 does not install because it doesn't see that the game is installed. this torrent had a lot of potential but unfortunately i think i'll have to download the 15 gb reloaded and try the 1.1 patch on that one. good effort though TPTB keep up the good work..."
,jsrobert9,2009-11-17T02:15Z,"Thanks TPTB Works great! Guys its pretty easy! use the setup included and thats it! It took me a few tries it would not load right away, try different things. I got Vista and run as adm would not work for some reason so i opened without and it worked.  I have a ATIRadeon HD 3200 and it runs ok but i still get a little lag. PS3 version is way better nice and smooth."
,Xaui,2009-11-23T21:02Z,Is there any way i can lower the graphics in this game?
,Koldfyre666,2009-11-24T13:53Z,"i successfully patched this download to v1.1 by downloading a copy of the original swtfu.exe and replacing the TPTB cracked exe with the original, then running the official update, then patching that with the Vitality v1.1 crack-fix.... game runs smooth now with new option included in Launcher enabling u to disable high level graphics.... i have AMD 2.7 dual core, 2G RAM, nvidia geforce 9400 GT 512MB..... quality still looks crisp"
,radioactivemart,2009-11-25T16:40Z,skullptura was the man tptb sorry folks but they often fuck up a game. like skull said before synergy sucks.

,woopdeedoo,2009-12-11T19:40Z,"Shiny. It only took 3 hours to install, but it seems to be working now."
,O_-me-_R,2009-12-14T18:10Z,"tbh i dont know how the registry looks for this game ... yet! since im downloading the full version atm.

But as of what i could find on the internet
its something like

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Aspyr\Star Wars The Force Unleashed]
""Path""=""{PATH}""
""AppFile""=""{PATH}\\SWTFU.exe""
""Language""=""en""

and i believe if you add this in your registry
and replace  {PATH} with the actual path to the game you should be able to update the rip without any problems if any problems occur plz let me know  "

,Rogue17,2009-12-24T08:59Z,The game runs for me however it is so slow I can't get anything done. I know that patch 1.1 is supposed to fix that for the most part however when I attempt to install the patch it says that the software is missing! Can the patch just not find it because it is saved differently than it would be if it were a legit copy? please help!!!
