Absolutely Clean Post.

Nuendo4 works great on my system (XP service pack 3). I had been waiting for this for quite sometime now. 

Thanks a TON for sharing this fantastic piece of musical bliss.

,sunnydyz,2009-11-08T17:16Z,"hey, i have one problem. Creepy_wonder maybe you can help. i cannot find witch services or processes the dongle emulator started. my sound car for some reason stoped working then i installed nuendo. the device manager is saying that it is used by another program. is it a way to manualy start|stop dongle?"
,sunnydyz,2009-11-08T17:19Z,"i forgot to mension that my card is EMU 1212m. it is working with nuendo, but it isn't in windows 7 x64 and rest apps. hope someone will help to find solution to this proglem..."
,Creepy_wonder,2009-11-08T19:31Z,"@sunnydyz

This release from AiR is different from H20...where the dongle had to be manually stopped but here it cracks it internally... N stops as soon as you quit from Nuendo. N for your problem...can you be a lil more precise... As you are saying your sound card is working with Nuendo n not with Win7 x64... This doesnot make sense... Nuendo is also working on the same pc I guess...on a Win x64... Try un-installing the driver software of the sound card & re-install is the 1st thing which might help... Also check the Sound configuration in control pannel... C if it helps...or try n write a lil in details... 

Regards.. :)"
,sunnydyz,2009-11-09T10:08Z,"@Creepy_wonder

yes you're right that N runs on the same machine w7 x64 as is my sound card installed.

i spend a lot of time yesterday trying to identify the problem. uninstalling N didn't help. then i reinstalled both my sound card drivers and PatchMix application witch what i realized later is causing a problem (i'm not sure is this emulator or PathMix issue). after reinstalling PatchMix app i was able to use 1212m on w7 as well as on other apps until the start on N. if i start N without using 1212mASIO drivers everything is ok, but if i set to my sound card's ASIO drivers i have same error in w7 that device is used by other application. Then i started mess around sample rate setting and realized that no mater what i set in my ASIO configuration panel, N sarts with sample rate 44100Hz. if i exit N at 48000Hz it starts at 44100Hz and reset PatchMix to that sample rate too. Later on i realized that after every time i use N i have to set my PatchMix sample rate to 48000Hz to make w7 produce sound. But if i want to use PatchMix with sample rate 44100Hz i need to reinstall it. Everyting works fine untill the first use of 1212m ASIO drivers in Nuendo. hope i'm more specify this time :)"

,Creepy_wonder,2009-11-19T17:36Z,"@FNusername....thanks for the compliment :)

@remeniz.... thanks for seeding this... Really appreciate this... which everyone felt n done the same... :)

@Pawan... dude m sorry but the crack is inbuilt n m not a software engeneer... I know hardware :D 
Guess you have to download the whole file... Anyway... I don't think the crack takes all the space... its the files & updates which are huge... The original disk is over 4 gbs... Its only the AiR release that is smaller... I don think it will get any smaller with all its features... :)

Thanks guys..."
,Jorgs,2009-12-16T20:42Z,"Hi Creepy_wonder,

Got the same problem as Jan-dj... I unrarred the download, opened it in both PowerIso as MagicIso and when I click setup.exe it opens in a new window. But when I hit any key afterwards, it also dissapears and nothing happens anymore...?? Any idea? I'm not that handy with mounting .iso's, so maybe I'm doing something stupid, could well be :)
Thanks in advance and thanks a bunch for this torrent!!
Jorgs."
,crushtest,2009-12-17T03:29Z,Thanksssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Creepy_wonder,2009-12-19T00:05Z,"@ Jorgs....

No need to get into the mess of using Power ISO or Magic ISO... If you are using WinRar 3.8 for extracting the .rar files... just use the same to extract the .ISO file aswell... Just right click on the .ISO file & select the option 'Open With' & select WinRar... extract to desired location... & run the setup.exe from there.... :)
Hope this helps...let me know when done... or if you face an issue... I will try my best..."
,cockn1pples,2009-12-31T05:58Z,Please seed.. This is such a great upload but not 1 out of 91 are seeding!!!
,KOBKED-X,2009-12-31T21:05Z,"Thank you a LOT for this UP!!!

I DLed it, [am still seeding too] Install went fine cept for one glitch.. but after a redoing of the dongle emu in the torrent and a re-boot it works ..I may have it configured a bit wrong as it has a lot of crackling and pops here n there when scrubbing [somewhat acceptable due to my two year old PC with only two gigs ram and XP pro SP3] It seems to be running stable and all functions are available and working.!!!

So Ya Get this Try B4 U Buy,.. I suggest to the company that made it.. lower your prices and more people will buy it..$2G + is almost as much as a newish decent PC...that runs much more than just an audio app...

But ya, It works and is clean according to NOD32 , spybot my fire wall didn't see [and still hasn't] any attempts to access the web after installing [and patching [done offline of course]]

Thanx again for this awesome UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,KOBKED-X,2009-12-31T21:07Z,"OH ya one last thing..

Saddly nuendo doesn't have the same Vocal options as CueBase 5..so if thats what you will use a lot get CueBase 5 as well or instead.."

@Doe182... You are welcome... :)

@definder.... It is very sad that how easily people like you tend to use slags so unnecessarily... For your kind information... This is working in 64bits... So may be its time you check your system... or try n remove & re-install... "
,KOBKED-X,2010-02-03T00:20Z,"Hiya Thanks Creepy!

Ok What Nuendo does Not have is the Vocal pitch editor..:( This is truely sad...and I was Just on the Steinberg site and its not included in the latest patch either..any one know of a good [pro grade] plug in that could correct this? ThanX in Advance... :) Keep Pumping out the tunes!"
,Creepy_wonder,2010-02-04T17:09Z,@KOBKED-X.... Heya buddy... you if r looking for pitch edditing for Vocals...then Melodyne is a good software for that... Works both as a VST or as a Stand Alone... :) Or Waves Mercury Bundle has some pitch shift VSTs in it... :)

,Creepy_wonder,2010-03-07T09:05Z,@djAkilla.... Buddy you might have installed any VST which is not compatible with it...thats why its crashing... Happened to me aswell... Donnot install Old VSTs... instead find newer versions.. :)

Does anyone else get a runtime error when installing the dongle emulator?  Mine comes up that it cant import dll:C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\\waterlib.dll

The file is there, but for some reason it's not importing ... not sure if the ""dll:"" before the directory path  is causing the issue."

Got the same problem. Opened the RAR's with winrar, the ISO with deamontools-lite, running win xp sp3. I'm running a dongle emulator for Nuendo 3.2 in the same time. could this cause a problem? I think it shouldn't...?? Thanks n Respect "

Thankfully team air saved the day.. I buy most of my plugins and the other cheaper daw's as well as software instruments, but Nuendo, my main daw I like to use, is $1700 dollars... now, it is a great program, but from what i've seen in other programs, prices, etc,  even 1700 is waaay too high.out of my range, maybe when I build my studio up I will, but you need things to get started right? here ya go.. Thanks to creepy wonder, and first and foremost, team air. keep it coming, can't wait for nuendo 5.. if I could donate, I would This is a PERFECTLY WORKING program, no bugs, no crashes, great installer, great improvement over the h20 dongle emulator"

for the noobs like me who for some reason get confused a little with the fact that there is like 30 winrar files that show up when u open the finnished torrent: double click (open) the 1st winrar file.  there should be an ""airsn43.iso) file, double-click it.  run the setup.exe and u should be good!!
I dl'd this from a dif site which told me to mount the iso, which i did with no results.  don't know why the site told me to do that, cause it didnt work "
,Creepy_wonder,2010-12-26T19:06Z,"Hello.. Everyone.. anyone having issues with extracting or mounting ISO or installing... 

1. Extract with winrar.. the first file...only
2. An ISO file will be there.. if facing a problem mounting it.. forget about that.. just right click & select open with.. & select Winrar again... extract the files to a folder.. run the setup from there.. Hope this helps.. 

Anyone facing problems with errors... Clean the system temp , user temp & prefetch... then restart the system.. then try n install...
If possible use the New Tune Up Utilities 2011... clean the system thoroughly... then restart & try... Would be good enough i feel...

Also check out my new upload...
