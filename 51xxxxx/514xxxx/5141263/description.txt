Where does this play?

           
BD5 is meant for playback on pc/popcorn/htpc/ps3/bluray-player
            
          
How does it work?

           
For playback on pc simply extract and play the mkv in your favorite player.
another option is to create the bluray/image for playback with powerdvd.
             
For playback on ps3/bluray-player run mkv2bluray.bat and chose "B". This will convert the mkv to bluray and create an image that will play in the PS3 or a Bluray Player.
           
           
How's the quality?
           

Qualiy is to be considered the same as BluRay releases.
             
           

Why is BD5 "undersized"?
           
 
The conversion to bluray takes up some 200-300MB space which is the bluray overhead. Because of this the mkv is sligthly "undersized".
