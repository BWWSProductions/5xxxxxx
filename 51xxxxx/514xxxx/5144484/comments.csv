,narsnail,2009-11-02T07:45Z,"fake?

either way seed fuckers"
,Joeker09,2009-11-02T07:48Z,Legit. Nice upload.
,Paull2,2009-11-02T07:49Z,"this is likely not fake, and the original source of the file is here: http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/dragon-age-origins-%5Brs%5D-588685/

silly to ask for seeds when the original seeder hasn't uploaded it to a single person yet"
,narsnail,2009-11-02T07:51Z,"sorry, just meant to actually be uploading, I got about 160kbps going up and nothing going down."
,Salteris,2009-11-02T08:01Z,What's the point in uploading this and then turning off your computer right afterward?
,Notyalc,2009-11-02T08:02Z,"Downloading at 400kbs, uploading at 2 megs. Get while the getting's good. I'll stop uploading when its finished, in about 7 hours."
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T08:03Z,My computer isnt off.
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T08:04Z,It's legit. I'm sharing it because someone shared it with me. It's my 1st upload and I must say it's a damned good one. I'm sorry I can't make myself into a million seeders or I would.
,narsnail,2009-11-02T08:11Z,"its going good now, and yea sorry about the fake comment, shoulda done my homework. cant wait for this game :)"
,Rattelse,2009-11-02T08:11Z,"People are just pointing out the given fact: stay online after you have finished dling. 

Sharing is love - Loving is to share."
,Notyalc,2009-11-02T08:12Z,"If I didn't upload at 1.5 meg+ while downloading, I would stay online, but I figure I do my duty while downloading, so why bother slow my comp down anymore than I need too."
,arv3416,2009-11-02T08:15Z,"Thanks for sharing. Quick question, what do you mean by ""kill DA CODE Process""? Just start the install and do and End Process for that name and it will go through even without a CD key?"
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T08:16Z,"Run the task manager when you're running the installer and a process called dragon age code (or something close to that, I dont remember the exact name, but its really obvious) will be a process on your task manager. Just kill that process and it will go through without a CD key, yup. It's that simple."
,Salteris,2009-11-02T08:19Z,"Any other trackers or peers I can add?  I'm getting about .127% of this file listed, with about 50kbs downloading.  The Piratebay tracker has timed out.  Can you post another?"
,Valamyr,2009-11-02T08:25Z,Add Mininova's. Its still going for me.

,fadian13,2009-11-02T08:30Z,Thanks for the upload ByblosHex 
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T08:32Z,Im going to sleep now & if it screws up for whatever reason its because im a noob and not because the file is fake or bad or anything like that. So hopefully it all goes well.
,Vonzom,2009-11-02T08:39Z,"Awww, looks like I'm late to the party. I'm seeing an avail. of 0.15 :(

Any other tracker I can add?"
,forsaken1111,2009-11-02T08:49Z,Can someone with a seedbox grab the file from the original site and seed this? It's torture.
,Vonzom,2009-11-02T08:49Z,"Oh well. :(

But...if the game is out and about, I'm sure the scene teams will be on it in no time! :D"
,TiLLseed,2009-11-02T08:52Z,"Got up to about 15% really fast, now it's crawling."
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T08:53Z,Right. If you have good bandwith you can do us all a big favour and grab the files from their direct download source here: http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/dragon-age-origins-%5Brs%5D-588685/ and share them with the rest of us. I am only 1 person and can only do so much.
,ciscoman,2009-11-02T09:08Z,so can i mount this with alcohol 120% ?
,torgrim1,2009-11-02T09:10Z,"ahh I have realy been waiting for this game, and if it is all what I have been hoping for IÂ´m buying it, but I donÂ´t know if I should get it to xbox360 or pc,,,"
,torgrim1,2009-11-02T09:11Z,oh I totaly forgott to say thank you for the up :)
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T09:14Z,"It's only been confirmed to work with PowerIso 4.5. But there's no harm in trying other apps, and if you do try it, and it does work, then that will be another confirmed app. :)

Get it for the PC! It is harder, have better graphic potential and user-made mods!"
,Notyalc,2009-11-02T09:17Z,Community mods are reason enough alone to get it for PC over console.
,Joeker09,2009-11-02T09:17Z,I agree. If you want to play madden or halo buy a 360. if you want play an rpg or mmo buy a pc.
,Paull2,2009-11-02T09:18Z,"btw, don't get your hopes up too high people.  just because you can get ingame, doesn't mean the game's fully playable.  may run into something similar to mass effect."
,Vonzom,2009-11-02T09:18Z,"/agree! PC gaming is FTW. :)

Thanks for the upload, ByblosHex."
,larchy,2009-11-02T09:19Z,ByblosHex I want to have your babies - THANKYOU!
,Valamyr,2009-11-02T09:20Z,"Its funny that someone with the same nick as the seeder was crusading the DA boards with anti-piracy statements. Even if that was just a way to get the word out, using the same nick is not smart. :)"
,Joeker09,2009-11-02T09:21Z,"@Paull2

Well the original came from a street version that was sold too early. So im guessing if everything was done CORRECTLY everything should run smooth."
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T09:23Z,"I want people to buy the game. I bought the game. Youre right, Im not smart. Oh well. :P

Plus having the same nick as someone doesnt mean theyre the same person, right?

It's files copied directly from a sold at a store DVD. I dont see how it wouldnt work."
,fadian13,2009-11-02T09:24Z,i pre ordered mine i just want to play it sooner and so i searched for a torrent nothing for 3 days and then god send  BybloHex to answer our prayers haha!!!!
,infinite_1ne,2009-11-02T09:29Z,Too bad there is no longer a seed.  Oh well should be a bunch of releases popping up soon.
,torgrim1,2009-11-02T09:29Z,"ok pc version it is then, this is defenitley my x-mas present this year :)"
,infinite_1ne,2009-11-02T09:30Z,"Touche,

as I typed my last comment a seed popped up.

Thanks for the up by the way.  This game looks awesome."
,Valamyr,2009-11-02T09:32Z,Yeah theres a seed. And theres a couple guys over 80% who we can hope will be able to help out soon. 
,Joeker09,2009-11-02T09:40Z,I'm really curious here how some people are downloading at 500+ kb/s and I max at 170 ish? My internet speed?
,infinite_1ne,2009-11-02T09:45Z,"Don't feel too bad, I'm sitting at around 50 kb right now.  Will have it in a day or so.  Hope the people who are close to done seed, and would like to hear some more feedback about it working or not."
,MasaX,2009-11-02T10:04Z,"I sifted through 23 pages from tehparadox source site and it is legit.

So far they have said that Daemon Tools does not work and the only way that works so far is PowerIso 4.5

The ctrl-alt-del workaround also seems to work."
,Ansuz05,2009-11-02T10:06Z,I'm downloading via the Direct Download links. Should be able to seed within an hour or two.
,Rattelse,2009-11-02T10:16Z,"You don't need all the files from the DD links to help seed, even if you just bring a couple full rar archives it will probably help the torrent."
,vadso3,2009-11-02T10:40Z,"So.. I'm downloading here, but If I also download some rars from the forum, is it a way for me to add them to my download so 1: I can get it faster :) and 2. I can share what I get with all of you evil gamers...
"
,ByblosHex,2009-11-02T10:43Z,Ya. Just put them in the same folder as ur torrent application's dl directory and then open the torrent
,ntelques,2009-11-02T11:10Z,hey thanks for this torrent i will seed as long as possible. i just started and i have already uploaded 500MB in 3 min so i will probably continue seeding for a couple of days. any feedback on whether it works or not would be good. thanks i really love this game.
,Rattelse,2009-11-02T11:15Z,"It's all working great, the progress on this torrent is beautiful. We are up to three seeds now and going strong, as long as people keep seeding."
,ntelques,2009-11-02T11:23Z,wow i am downloading at 3MB/s and uploading at nearly 2MB/s. at this rate it will be done in 2 hrs.
,Malfice,2009-11-02T11:35Z,Just started download from the RS links on tehparadox. Should be done in 2/3 hours. Will seed when done.
,fadian13,2009-11-02T11:48Z,it's going good and steady keep seeding people :)

,lordsorgo,2009-11-02T12:06Z,"People, please don't be selfish. I urge you to seed. There are plenty of people who want to play this game and you know how tough it can be waiting days to play a game you've been anticipating.

,fatshinobi,2009-11-02T12:48Z,Please set upload high. I was uploading 1mb and only getting like 50kb down. If alot of people set it higher it will go along way to making this move much faster.

,DaveTehSlave,2009-11-02T14:09Z,"Although I love the Pirate Bay, things have gotten ridiculous b/c people just don't seed. I'll admit I now only use TPB for long lost games or movies and TV series, and nothing else. If I want something NOW I visit my private tracker. I suggest doing some research. Or get on usenet, but I suggest the previous. Currently maxing out my dl rate at a private tracker."

There is over 200 seeds so I don't want to see anymore whining about seeds.  Not like you connect to 200 seeders anyway.  Can't wait to get into this game, bet I'll be up all night.  Kudos for beating the scene folks to the up :P"
,infinite_1ne,2009-11-03T05:18Z,"1 more thing if anyone can answer.  I pretty much rely on DHT and Peer Exchange.  Most trackers timeout or are invalid url's, any reasons why it's this way for me?  Just curious, still gets the job done either way."

,mufuti9,2009-11-03T13:38Z,"game works perfectly..I was counting the days :) thanks for this! but

Please!!
If you like this game as much as I do - buy it!
If it is not available at your country yet as is the case for me - dont sweat it!

Just make sure you pay these guys later for the time and effort they put into this game so YOU could have such a great time.

Dont waste your money for shitty games you play on a rainy weekend.

With your money you support great developers like Bioware that will continue to create the greatest game experiences available so dont steal from them. Dont betray their love for gaming and their great work and support them so they can continue to create these great games for a long time. 

And btw I dont give a shit about your financial situation.
I am a student myself, I know what is going on. It is called getting a job you lazy peons. If you dont have 50 free bucks available every other month I advise you to take a close look at your lifestyle. Maybe lay back on the weed a bit."

KOTOR 1 i bought 2 times after my first one broke, KOTOR 2, jade garden, bioshock for the 360, mass effect for the 360 as well as my ongoing support for SWTOR in the future. if you want to support them so much, then go buy the damned DA:origins in stores then, what the hell are you doing on the pirate bay?

Just DL. Extract. Mount, and install !!
When the CD Key menu pops up, just right click the taskbar ( blue bar on bottom ) chose task manager. Then click on the processes tab, find the DragonAge process and End Process.
EZ PZ...lol  GL  ;)"
