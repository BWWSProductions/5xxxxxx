,evilg0d,2012-04-20T09:48Z,"Thank you for sharing this. I really appreciate it.

@KevanGC: Despite almost everyone claiming otherwise, tests have confirmed that on most audio equipment, including iPods, a vast majority can not discern any quality difference above a decent 160k cbr rip.

Please don't bother flaming me about this. as I said almost everyone claiming otherwise."
