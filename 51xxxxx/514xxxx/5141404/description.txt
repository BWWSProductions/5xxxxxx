Queensryche

An underrated phenomenon.

This torrent contains their debut self-titled EP (originally released in 1983) fully remastered with bonus tracks. The particular bonus tracks on this album are in fact the entire audio recording of their Live In Tokyo performance from 1984.

All tracks ripped to highest quality VBR MP3.

Do NOT download torrent unless from a trusted source baring my name.

Any questions, feel free to ask.

I don't do requests. Anything I have to share, I will.

Enjoy. Other albums up to Hear In The Now Frontier coming soon.
