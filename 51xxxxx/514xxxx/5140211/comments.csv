Installed updates after installation and it worked like a charm. I even did it past windows needing me to reinstall due to it being so far gone as far as activation. Thank you!"

As syndre was suggesting in another comment to previous upload, you can try to reset all previous patches using a toolkit like 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5011417/windows_7_toolkit_1.8_by_Orbit30_Activate_your_build_7600

and see if after this it works. Otherwise the last solution is to do a fresh reinstall."
