Episode 138 - Volcano Eruption!
Sunday, August 9th, 2009 â€“ running time 20:28

Learn to create an erupting volcano with spewing and falling lava, smoke and highlights!
Bert Monroy creates an erupting volcano using textures, brushes, filters, masks, alpha channels and lighting.

*** Create a night sky and volcano base
Invert the background then apply a dark blue gradient, which will make a nice, dark sky. In a new layer named Volcano, fill with a brownish color. With black in the foreground color and brown in the background, choose FIlter > Render Fibers. This will give you a nice earthy texture. Distort the shape by pulling in the top corners to create a volcano shape. Apply the filter, Watercolor, and fade the opacity of the filter to about 36% so that the original grooves of the volcano still show through. Create a new layer mask on the Volcano layer, and use black to create a mask around the edges of the volcano. This gives the appearance of rough edges, much like a real mountain.

*** Make fire and lava
Falling lava: Choose a red color for the foreground color. With various brush sizes, hand draw falling lava that comes from the top of the volcano shape. Apply an outer glow with a red tone, and a bevel & emboss, which will make the lava look hot and shiny. The highlight should be yellow and the shadow should be orange when applying settings to bevel & emboss.

*** Spewing lava from the top of the volcano
Use a large spatter brush with high spacing in a new layer below the volcano. Use red for the foreground and yellow for the background color, then apply these colors in the brush settings. Warp the layer to create perspective of spewing lava. After you have your desired shape, add additional spatters.

*** Add smoke
In a new layer above all others, apply the Filter > Render Clouds using black and white. Use Warp to create a shape stemming from the opening of the volcano. Use an eraser to soften the edges.

*** Create red highlights in the smoke
Copy the smoke into an alpha channel, then duplicate the alpha channel to create a mask that filters can be applied to. Move the second channel up and over a little to create a shift. Choose Image > Calculations, and subtract one mask from the other, and the result will be a new tone that you can lighten with Levels. Load the new channel, and in a new top layer, fill the area with red

*** Adjust lighting to create shadows
Create a black and white radial gradient in a layer above the volcano. Clip the gradient to the layer, and additional texture and lighting accents the volcano.
