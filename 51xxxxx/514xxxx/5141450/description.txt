////////////////////////////////this is my first torrent/////////////////////////////



this is for anyone who like the halo series, has read the halo books, or is a fan of 

generally awesome stuff.


this is the I Love Bees Anthology.  its a part of the halo timeline and is kinda 

hard to follow but by the time you get to the end, you'll be wanting more.

it took me like 3 weeks to find this because its so old and NONE of the torrents 

worked so im taking it upon myself to fix that. THIS IS A DVD BUT THERES NO VIDEO SO 

ITS REALLY AN AUDIOBOOK. its not an iso its a video_ts just burn that folder to a 

dvd to run or get a program that plays .vob audio files. i am currently working on 

converting it to mp3 and ill upload soon. i can personally garruntee that this works 

and that its the ONLY place on the internet that you can still get this.


I DO NOT OWN THIS AND IT IS SHAREWARE 100% LEAGAL.
