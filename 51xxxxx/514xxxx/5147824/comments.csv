thanks for your heroic efforts"

There's no need to keep all shared, but, if you can and if you want, if you occasionaly turnp up a seed for those torrents which have few seeders. 

This is usually my strategy: I browse

and feed the troubling torrents.

This helps the torrents to stay alive and does not burden your bandwidth too much :)"

http://tpb.tracker.prq.to/announce

http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce

http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

udp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

the major trackers are working in a discountinous manner since two months... but if you rely on DHT based torrent clients, currently you have there 4 seeders and 6 leechers...

And... by the way... continue to share it when you made it complete ;)"
