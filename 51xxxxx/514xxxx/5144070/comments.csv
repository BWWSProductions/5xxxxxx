What is with your comment on the Devo - Recombo DNA torrent??


""storoa - 2009-04-02 05:06 CET:

This torrent ""smells really bad"". I won't bother to download it because I know it will be fucked up. Check torrentguiden's other FLAC torrents before you waste your time and bandwidth on this shit. And torrentguiden, how does Suspira79's cock taste ? hahahahahahaha""

Are you 10 years old? Not enough attention from your parents? Please do not waste people's time with such weak-minded bollocks. If there is something wrong with a torrent, say so intelligently or say nothing at all."
,bambam1234,2009-12-07T12:19Z,"LoL scott_ehm, arent you the hypocrite. Why not practice what you preach and if you have nothing intelligent to say other than the weak minded bollocks that would spew from a 10 year olds mouth who doesnt get the attention he seeks from his parents, then say nothing at all."
