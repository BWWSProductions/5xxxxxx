The Remedy For a Slow Computer

Auslogics BoostSpeed [+]

This is so typical. We buy a new PC and soon it slows down to a crawl. Sometimes we just expect too much perhaps. But all too often, the computer is really running slow.

Why? Remnants of programs you once installed are now clogging the memory and disks. The Windows Registry is filled with junk and rarely defragmented. To top it all, Windows runs services you don't need.

Luckily for us, computer owners, most of these problems can be reversed. Auslogics BoostSpeed can speed up your computer by cleaning up and defragmenting disks and the Registry, removing bloated software, and applying performance tweaks.
So, How Much Faster Can A Slow Computer Become?
Performance Tests
Performance Tests [+]

We tested BoostSpeed on a 2-year old notebook to see how the program can speed up a computer. Tests with WinBench software show 10%-100% improvement to an overall computer performance after all the clean up has been done (click on the picture to see the results).

As you can see, Internet speed was greatly increased using several techniques. Memory usage, computer start up and shutdown speed, opening a Word document - all went noticeably faster than before optimization. Results vary on different computers and some people report "unbelievable results", while others simply use the program for daily computer maintenance.
Is It Worth The Money?

It's simple. To get a technician to look at your computer will easily cost you somewhere in the neighbourhood of $50 to $100 per hour or more. And thatâ€™s before any repairs.

Now, when you optimize your computer you save approximately 10 to 30 minutes a day. This means that, in just a few days, the program will have saved you more money than what you had spent on the purchase of the program.

To top it all off, it's a one-stop program to keep your computer healthy and error-free, plus get rid of most annoyances.
