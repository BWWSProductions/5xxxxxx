A Montreal-based political punk rock band, influenced by Propagandhi and Bad Religion. This is real punk, the way you remember it being before it got watered down!

The songs here are demos for the second album by Montreal punk band Humanifesto, entitled "The Infamous". The band decided that they could get a much better recording done at a different studio, so these Red Rhino Studio recordings will simply serve as the demos for the album.

Enjoy! The real release will be out in early 2010.
