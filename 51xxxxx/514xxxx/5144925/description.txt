Fascism was the cause of bloody wars and needless slaughter in the 20th century. Fascists believed only in brute force, that there was a constant "fight for survival" between races and nations, and that shedding blood was a sacred duty. They caused the death of tens of millions of people. 

At the root of this violent ideology lay a theory that presented man as a "species of animal," and maintained that conflict is a law of nature: Darwin's theory of evolution. It was â€œSocial Darwinism," the name of that theory when applied to the social sciencies, that formed the basic ideological inspiration for German and Italian fascism, and its dictators, Hitler and Mussolini. 

This book reveals the Darwinist origin of fascism. It also reveals how fascism is the continuation of a culture of violence, descended from ancient paganism, and how it relies on a philosophy completely at odds with divine truth. 

In reading this book, you will come to recognize the sources, the features and the methods of fascism, which brought great suffering upon mankind in the 20th century. You will also learn how it poses a threat to humanity even today, how to stop it, as it continues to shed blood, and prepares to spill still more, and how the world can be freed from this ideology of savagery.
