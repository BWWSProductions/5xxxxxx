While on a hunt for a woman with no identity, Detective Charlie Jade is shot into a strange parallel universe (Betaverse) when a facility that he is investigating explodes.

Charlie is from Alphaverse, a dystopian universe that is ruled by five mega corporations. Betaverse, the universe Charlie is initially sent to, corresponds to "our" reality. But there's a third universe, the Gammaverse, an apparent Utopia that has an abundance of natural resources that Vex-Cor (one of the Alphaverse mega-corps) would like to exploit.

Charlie Jade was filmed in Cape Town, South Africa and produced by CHUM Television and the South African Industrial Development Corporation.
