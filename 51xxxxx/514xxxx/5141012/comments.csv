,doctor_oh,2010-11-12T17:56Z,"paddotrip is obviously an expert.  anything contaminated by Tiesto automatically blows.  The most overrated hack in the world.   Whether vomiting out his own worthless garbage or raping someone else's track with extra cheese or celebrating his equipment's ability to automate bland beatmixes as if it made him some kind of God.

Tiesto 'Tijs' VerHack  should be included on the next space mission to Mars or beyond, whether he wants to go or not.... "
