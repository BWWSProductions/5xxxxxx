[V],-jonny-,2009-11-05T19:21Z,"yep, but clerks never looked better."
,rhsjr7,2010-02-01T08:56Z,What the hell is w/ the animation in the middle? Oi!.. I want the original cut in HD.. but this is.. 'Cute' too
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-23T17:33Z,"this is clearly labeled ""the first cut"""
,Tech.Junkie.V2,2010-10-09T15:30Z,"The original did have the animation in the middle you dickhead, how else would they be able to explain the funeral scene. What a cunt."
,ifkillz,2011-05-01T15:41Z,"Just a clarification: this is the THEATRICAL VERSION (92 minutes) of the movie, but with a color, 8-minute animated sequence inserted at the 53:02 mark (the infamous ""wedding lost scene"") which was created for the DVD release around 2004. The FIRST CUT is another thing altogether, including a different ending."
