,brainphreak,2009-11-02T20:30Z,"Well I cant be blamed now for lack of seed. I have seeded over 10 gigs and multiple people have snatched it. Now I am still the only seed, and I see 11 leeches and the highest is 30%.

Too many hit and runs, and this is a brand new torrent. Way to kill the information flow!

Come on guys! Seed at least until there is more than ONE SEEDER!! Or at least 1.0 ratio! 

That's not a lot to ask... "
,brainphreak,2009-11-03T06:16Z,"Any comments? No seeders and no comments? I have 4 more volumes of these that are all amazing, give me some motivation to post them!"
,russell1nash,2009-11-06T20:25Z,"thanx, will check it out. 
and seeding now :)"
,brainphreak,2009-11-07T05:38Z,Much appreciated. I am still seeding myself. Been over 20GB and still you are probably the only other seeder. Sad. 
,brainphreak,2009-11-14T03:11Z,Im happy to see a few seeders now. Thanks everyone for contributing and getting this information out there!

,unpocoloco,2010-04-21T23:35Z,"Have been seeding these three DVDs for months,, and will keep seeding, just got to get some gaming in there from time to time (darkest hour,  tanks only servers) so i turn it off, but dont worry i will be back ni a couple of hours no matter what..
I only got 50kbit up but hope to improve on that in a not to distant future,, "
,brainphreak,2010-07-18T06:55Z,"Apparently Demonoid does not agree with the material found in these torrents and felt the need to ban my account. Who would of expected that from an 'underground' torrent site? with all those 9/11 documentaries and info on Demonoid and they ban me over these?  Not so much as an email... I did nothing but support them, but fuck them now... The next time I connect to their server it will be in a million session DOS attack.. *jk* I wouldnt waste my time on their POS tracker thats always breaking anyways...

My Message to Demonoid:

fuck you demonoid, fuck you in the ass. 
You can all go eat a bowl of dick."
