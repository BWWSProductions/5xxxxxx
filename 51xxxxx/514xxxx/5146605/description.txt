Description: In 1992 Japanese label Toy's Factory released the first Masters Of Misery album. Because it was only sold in Japan it was difficult to find it in shops in Europe and the States. Until 1997 when Earache released the UK version of Masters Of Misery. The UK version has a different track list than the Japanese version. Some of the tracks from the Japanese version also ended up on the Eternal Masters compilation which was released by Priority Records in 1994.
