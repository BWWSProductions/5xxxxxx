 
In 1969, Karen and Richard Carpenter signed to A&M Records and released their debut album. Forty years later, the Carpenters are recognized not only as the most successful brother-sister act in music history and one of the best-selling acts of all-time but also as a pop culture phenomenon that continues to resonate today. Celebrating that legacy, the two-CD 40/40 (A&M/UMe), released October 20, 2009, produced by Richard Carpenter, brings together 40 of the duo's greatest hits and best-loved recordings, each digitally remastered. 

40/40 includes all of the Carpenters' dozen Top 10 Pop hits, 19 of their 20 Top 40s and 23 of their 28 Top 75 Pop singles, from 1969's cover of the Beatles' "Ticket To Ride" to 1981's "Those Good Old Dreams." Among the 17 other tracks are covers of Leon Russell's classic "This Masquerade," Hank Williams' "Jambalaya (On The Bayou)" and Tim Hardin's "Reason To Believe," and a pair of recordings originally released in 1983, following Karen's passing earlier that year, "Now" and "Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore".
