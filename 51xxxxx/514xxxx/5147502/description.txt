| NOTES                                                                     |
|                                                                           |
| Frame rate: The source is a mix of 24fps material telecined to 30fps and  |
| true 30fps material.  Although the 24fps material consists mostly of the  |
| present-day landscape scenes (arguably the prettiest parts of each        |
| episode), they comprise only 10-25% of each episode, so it was decided    |
| that it would be better to keep the original 30fps frame rate.            |
|                                                                           |
| Container format: Although the MKV format is more efficient, the space    |
| savings would have been insignificant relative to the size of each        |
| episode, and the use of AVI ensures that each episode can be "natively"   |
| played by Windows 7, with no need for any additional software.            |
|                                                                           |
| A small portion of episode 3 was lost due to glitches; this was repaired  |
| by splicing in the same scenes from a different source recording.         |
