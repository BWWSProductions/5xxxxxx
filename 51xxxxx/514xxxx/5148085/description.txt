Over the last few years, a number of works of this kind have appeared,
and my adding a stone to the edifice was above all a response
to the needs of my patients; I also wished to enlighten people as to
the cause of these nervous disorders, known under various names
such as neurasthenia, psychoneurosis or psychasthenia; and finally
to develop my personal point of view on the subject of treatment.
So it is above all the patients, suffering from these disorders, whom
I am addressing, and that is why I tried, as much as possible, to simplify
anything in this study which seemed too abstract. My primary
objective is to show you, as best I can, why people get sick, and how
they can be cured.
This training method, if I may be permitted to call it that, is based
on the certainty that all psychasthenic disorders are caused by a malfunction
in the brain, and that it is in the brain, and nowhere else, that
we must look for solutions.
