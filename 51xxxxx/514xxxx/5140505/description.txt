Sainthood is the title of sister act Tegan and Sara's sixth full-length album. It also marks the first time that the duo, who always exaggerate their contentious relationship onstage, has ever written together. Speaking to myYearbook.com, Tegan said, "We wanted to challenge ourselves, so we thought weâ€™d sit in a room and force each other to write together. Sometimes itâ€™s when youâ€™re at your worst that you write your best music. Isolating Sara and I alone in a city where we knew no one after a big, long tour where we really just wanted to be at home, it put us really off guard. It was really complicated and difficult. The music that came out of it was really complicated and difficult"
 
The Quin sisters brought back Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla (The Con) to do the production on this album, as well as Howard Redekopp (So Jealous). "I think the fan favorites in terms of records have been our last two. So we brought in the production teams from both and made a hybrid of sound," Quin said on picking the producers.
