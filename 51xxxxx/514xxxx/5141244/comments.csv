,VaderBlack,2009-10-31T00:36Z,"Quick question.

Do I need to download this torrent and the DVD1 torrent for the full game? 6GB and 7GB seems like a lot for Force unleashed."
,n-t0wn,2009-10-31T01:49Z,"yes. you need to download both dvd's.
and yes it is pretty big! 15 gigs in total. 24 when installed."
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-10-31T02:14Z,WHAT!!! 15GB for this?!?!??!

,jacmiszcz92,2009-10-31T17:17Z,Is there Polish language?
,napoli666,2009-11-01T07:06Z,"I know what the minimal requirements are.

But I'm wondering if someone was able to play it with a GeForce 8600GT?

Thank's to anyone that can help me."
,Jakkhali,2009-11-04T02:54Z,"Maybe, napoli666. The minimum is apparently GeForce 8800, but it's possible you can suffice, with minimum graphical settings, of course.

It's possible."
,r46u,2009-11-04T04:42Z,"It will run with 8600, U just have to lower the resolution a bit, otherwise it's a tad slow."
,TheMongoStomp,2009-11-04T07:17Z,Is disc 2 all the DLC that was released?
,ObsessionPC,2009-11-18T03:54Z,"Ok, finally done after 3 days :O .
But still great upload for a free game and lame seeders.

The language is ENGLISH and I had only a few errors during the installation.
Reading errors bad source etc. but with a couple hits on the retry button, it installed everything.
The game works but jee, it is so much console :(
I wish they would have put more effort into the PC version......

Thanks again, BTW dont forget to download the crack exe as well, it is not included in the DVD 1 and 2 torrents!"
,truthy,2009-11-21T22:29Z,"thx for sharing - I had no problems at all installing, patching or playing this game. It's the US-Version of the Game and installing/patching takes quite some time - even on a highend pc. here's what I did:

1. mount the 2 images and install (requires 25 GB! after patch 28,2 GB)
2. before patching: make sure you have at least 20 Gb of free discspace where your temporary folder is located - if not change it temporarily to another partition where you have that kind of space & reboot to apply the changes
3. install the v1.1 patch US-Version (copy to game dir & execute)
4. rename original exe and copy v1.1 crack Vitality (from GCW) to your game dir. I didn't use the one from Battery - Dupe."
,Hinka,2009-11-28T16:15Z,"Hey i'm kinda new to this so can someone make a detailed guide since i've done everything but it either says use the disc to or it enters the game but then exit and say star wars the force unleashed
has a problem and has to exit and BTW can i use Daemon tools or do i have to use PowerIso?"
,truthy,2009-12-01T23:35Z,patch it and use the crack frome gamecopyworld!
,JamesGreece,2009-12-04T10:28Z,i have daemon tools lite and the game cannot mount this image do i need to use another program to mount?? if yes could you plz tell me which?
