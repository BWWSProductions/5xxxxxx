Included: 

Speach by Chomsky (~45 mins) followed by a Q&A session hosted
by William Crawley.

I missed about the first 10 seconds of Chomsky's speech; he
started off by commenting on Obama's recent Nobel Peace Prize.

Sound Quality:

They gave a copyright warning before the lecture, so I had to
conceal my microphone. Sound quality has suffered slightly as a
result. 

There's a few scratchy/inaudible bits during the recording, but
it's mostly fine to listen to.
