Players may climb into the cockpit to pilot Snoopyâ€™s famous Sopwith Camel and other unique aircraft in perilous dogfights, high-speed air races and heart-pounding missions deep behind enemy lines. As players barnstorm across six massive, free-roaming play fields in search of clues for the location of the Red Baronâ€™s secret hideout, players can upgrade their aircraft with a collection of 25 unique, comical weapons and other unlockable gadgets, including the player-guided Woodstock missile. Classic Peanuts characters including Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, Marcie and Sally will aid Snoopy on his mission, providing him with hints and tips to track down the despicable Red Baron.

A nap atop his doghouse transports Snoopy to his fanciful dreams of the French countryside, where he once again imagines himself as the virtuoso flying ace on a gallant quest to defend the skies from the evil Red Baron. Soaring through the clouds in Snoopyâ€™s famous Sopwith Camel bi-plane, players find themselves engaged in sky-high dogfights, exhilarating air races and daring missions behind enemy lines. Battle the Baronâ€™s minions across Snoopyâ€™s imagined WWI France in an engrossing single-player adventure, then engage your friends in multiplayer dogfighting and minigames!


Players control Snoopy as he flies an assortment of missions in his trusty Sopwith Camel. Missions occur in numerous â€œtheatersâ€ that are slowly unlocked as you progress through the game. In addition to mission objectives, each â€œtheaterâ€ has a number bonus goals that you can choose to accomplish at your leisure. These generally involve shooting down colored balloons and locating hidden letters. 

Participating in combat and completing bonus goals allows you to purchase upgrades for your plane. You can acquire Woodstock-guided missiles, water balloons, a potato shotgun, and more. While the challenge level isnâ€™t exactly high, there are lots of missions and as the difficulty ramps up, you certainly wonâ€™t be able to sleepwalk through them. The difficulty level and forgiving controls appears to be well suited for less experienced players. The developers took a bunch of good ideas from other titles and assembled a rock solid action game for the younger set.
