,vipastyle,2009-11-01T16:20Z,Re-uploaded the torrent because of a mistaken file extension. MKV file made with HandBrake.
,Porkster,2009-11-01T19:28Z,You need to put in more trackers.  The piratebay trackers are blocked to many!

,vipastyle,2009-11-01T21:35Z,"The one yesterday just had a different file extension (m4v) for some reason, but still played fine. I went ahead and added all those trackers to the torrent file. Thanks for the heads up."
,lemontree255,2009-11-01T22:26Z,"Thanks for the upload. I downloaded the other one which works fine btw, you just remove the _ from the extension. Now to watch!"
,PsiKnife_KFT,2009-11-01T23:25Z,"It's real but the other one had a funny extension. You simply had to remove the dash from the extension. I believe this one is normal though so needs no editing. If you get the one with "".m4v_"" just change the extension to .mp4

On a side note, this was an intriguing debate despite the fact that the director is a known Christian and has a hard time hiding that fact in the editing room. Still, Hitchens intellectually punishes the poor pastor for most of the DVD, while the pastor seems content with arguing about arguments, semantics etc. 

Pastor Wilson gives a valiant effort to shoehorn in his primitive superstition with the credibility of modern discourse, but falls flat in the face of Hitchen's overwhelming polemics, and the sea of contradiction and flaw religion is lost in. "

...and currently has more seeders."
,jeffffy,2009-11-08T04:55Z,"Any change uploader or someone who has the file can upload another copy as a regular xvid in an avi container?

I'd really like to be able to watch this on my media centre... but I can't play this format.

(or if somoene can tell me an idiot proof way to convert it, that would be just as good)

thanks"

[M],EG,2009-12-01T23:21Z,"Awesome documentary,

I highly recommend everyone goes out and buys(yes buys) Christopher hitchens book god is not great: how religion poisons everything.

Best book I'v ever read =) Thanks for posting this, its a great torrent"
,hubris4242,2010-02-14T21:32Z,"Thanks for the upload! This is one that I wanted to see when it was showing at a local theater, but I missed it.

The mkv file plays just fine; that's not an issue. There's an interlace problem, though... whoever ripped it didn't de-interlace properly. Still, this isn't really a visually driven movie, and I will probably buy a copy when I can anyway."
,kludge420,2010-05-10T16:59Z,"Thank you for the upload but please don't use MKV files. They suck ass. MKV's are the gift coupons of the video world; you turn a perfectly good video file, an avi usable anywhere, into a crappy file usable virtually nowhere."
,kludge420,2010-05-10T21:49Z,"Just finished watching this. The theist slant is VERY evident in the editing for instance there is a lot of the christian guy asking a question or making a statement and then you see Christopher open his mouth to answer and they cut him off.

Even so Hitchens wins. On every count. The times when they cut off Christopher with editing you're left thinking, ""Wow, that was the most illogical argument I've ever heard."" Like when they guys said, ""There is beauty because without God there could be no beauty therefore God exists because without him there could be no beauty."" Really? Really? You just said that and your head didn't explode?"
,Esmad3,2010-06-20T15:05Z,I felt that all of Douglas Wilson's arguements was based on nothing and circular. I wonder whether a christian watching this feels the same way about Christopher Hitchens.
,Esmad3,2010-06-20T15:08Z,"To all the ppl having problems with the video-format: Time to catch up ppl. Do you really think you can keep avoiding the brilliant .Mkv format? It can do so many, many things that avi just can't"
,nowimcool,2011-09-09T05:56Z,"This is the ONLY Christian/Atheist debate I've ever seen where I think the Christian won.

Esmad3:  Hitchens argument isn't circular, it's incoherent.  In a purely physical/biological world there can be no such thing as good/evil (which is Wilson's argument)

The atheist/materialist may think there is good and evil but if brain function is only neural impulses and chemical reactions - on what basis is he basing this ""evil"" or ""good""??  It's all conditioning - and has no real foundation. 

In the end it becomes a worldview question - which no debate will ever resolve.  If there is no God (as Hitchens thinks) - there is no evil - therefore the question under debate is incoherent to Hitchens - and unanswerable.  Hitchens THINKS he can answer it, and by trying - he fails."
