[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-01T01:02Z,"Note: Don't bother posting and reporting all your beautiful av scan reports, it's a waste of time cause the Avtivator is already checked by TPB and me (see the torrent description):

1- Norton Internet Security detected in SysMech Activator v3.1.exe:
   - Risk name: Trojan Horse
   - Risk category: Virus

2- Kaspersky Anti-Virus detected in SysMech Activator v3.1.exe: 
   - Risk name: Packed.Win32.Black.a
   - Risk category: Trojan

3- Avast Anti-Virus detected in SysMech Activator v3.1.exe:
   - Risk name: Win32:Trojan-gen {Other} 
   - Risk category: Virus/Worm 

4- NOD32 Anti-Virus detected in SysMech Activator v3.1.exe: 
   - Probably a variant of Win32/Obfuscated Trojan

5- AVG Anti-Virus detected in SysMech Activator v3.1.exe: 
   - Risk name: Win32/Themida
   - Risk category: Virus


The  av scan results of Norton, Kaspersky, Avast, NOD32 and AVG are 
false positives and is just because of some used binaries and cryptors.
So just stay cool or don't use this!!!

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this!"

Even when I run as the admin It still tells me no. It is giving me this message ""Windows cannot activate the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access this file.""
