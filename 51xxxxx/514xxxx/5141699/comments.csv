,sampyre,2009-12-03T19:04Z,"Thx for this great movie!

Btw I tried burning this file on a Dvd with ConvertXToDvd.. But that didn't really work. When I add the avi file the playtime is reduced to about 30 mins. Your copy of Inglourious Bastards seems to have the same problem. 

Any Idea what causes this? And can it be fixed?"
,sampyre,2009-12-05T20:34Z,"Anybody else had the same problem? 
(and maybe a solution =P)"
,sampyre,2009-12-05T21:31Z,For the people who might have had the same problem as me: Just update your ConvertXtoDVD to version 4.XX ^^
