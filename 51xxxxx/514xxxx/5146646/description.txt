Brand new, but be aware many tracks are from July's Video Pool UK and I have already seeded that one a few months ago.   Again Promo Only North America let the side down with wrong ratio settings and often the Wide Screen original ends up at 4:3 which really is so stupid.

Why not let the backward CRT owners put up with the letterbox format and just distribute music video's in Wide Screen 16:9 Ratio and stop messing us VJ's about Eh????

Just as well OtsAV Pro (the Worlds Best Video/Karaoke Discotheque software) looks after the screen Ratio's pretty well despite the backward North American branch of Promo Only sigh...

Source Promo Only DVD9 Ripped with DVD Decrypter using file split by Cell ID mode and each file re named using industry conventions.

VOB (mpeg2) files
Mixed Screen Ratio (sigh)
320kps Audio

Enjoy.   Rigmar radio...  Oh and as normal, please look at the torrent files for the track listings.
