Game Info
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blitzkrieg is a real-time tactics computer game based on the events of
World War II. The game allows players to assume the role of commanding officer
during the battles of World War II that occurred in Europe and North Africa.
Each country has its respective historically correct military units. Similar
to the Sudden Strike games Blitzkrieg focuses on battles rather than real-time
strategy aspects like base building.

Graphics deliver realistic 3-D rendered isometric terrain and details include
seasons, climatic zones and weather conditions which can affect game play.
Blood is present although it can be deactivated. The game features over 350
different units and objects. The player has the ability to build pontoon
bridges, dig trenches, lay mines, resupply and repair units or call in air
support but there are no resources. Virtually everything can be destroyed
including buildings and bridges. Forests can be flattened by tanks or
artillery. Each unit of a respective nation speaks its own language, adding
immensely to the immersion.

The game was shipped with a mission and resource editors for users to create
their own units and maps.

It was released on May 12, 2003.
