,Revolver31,2010-08-09T17:06Z,hi people so i was wondering i had the orig now i dont my question is do i need the 1st disc (orig or copy dosnt matter) too boot the 2nd or can i d/l disc 2 put it in and away i go ? all i need is the bonus content as ive got the 1000 points on the game. this is by far 1 of the best games ive played cant wait 4 the second thx for your help.
,hunter212yy,2010-08-20T10:55Z,Hey. Thanks a lot for this upload but can you seed a little bit? Coz i'm getting like 1/4 of my regular speed :(.
,mrkmhtet,2010-09-18T14:45Z,So it means must burn both games or the first disc is just a loader for wave 4 games like activate.iso.  or both disc have missions.
