From the author's readme file:

cIOSCORP v3.5!



What is it?

It's a complete software modification for your Nintendo Wii to

allow you to play almost all of your in-region backup burnt Wii

and GameCube games via the disc channel without opening your

console or having to use a loader application.

All IOS have the Trucha Bug restored.

All IOS, except for 28, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 38, have full Korean

Game support.

All IOS have their version number maxed out to prevent being

overwritten by an Official Nintendo Wii System Update (although we do

not recommend performing a Wii System Update anyway).



Comment form damysteryman:

"Fuck you, Nintendo! You lose!"



cIOSCORP v3.5 does not modify IOSes 4, 16, 51, 57, or 61.



Extras Installer:

cmios (WiiGator)= mios v4 with WiiGator's GC Backup Launcher embedded

		  into it.

cmios (waninkoko)= waninkoko's cmios, but uses mios v4 as a base,

		  instead of mios v5.

cIOS55 rev13 DIP= cIOS55 v5149 with rev13 DIP. Supports Dual Layer

		  discs, but may not fix #001 error properly.

cIOS55 rev14 DIP= cIOS55 v5149 with rev14 DIP. Properly fixes #001

		  error, but does not support Dual layer discs.



What is needed (other than this package):

- A Nintendo Wii (to modify)

- A non-SDHC Card with heaps of free space (preferably a blank 1GB

  or 2GB card)

- Ability to run Wii homebrew (e.g. Homebrew Channel installed)

- waninkoko's cIOS249 installed, to run the installer



Optional, but recommended:
bootmii (preferably as boot2):

We highly recommend installing bootmii, and making a NAND backup,

and/or installing preloader prior to installing cIOSCORP v3.5.

preloader:

Also, installing preloader with a hacks.ini for your System Menu is

recommended, as it has some useful hacks, such as region free games.



How risky is it to install?

cIOSCORP v3.5 overwrites the majority of the system files (IOS)

on your Nintendo Wii with modified ones which "know" how to handle

DVDÂ±R discs, so the installation process itself can be quite risky.

You should be fine if you just let the installer run though.
