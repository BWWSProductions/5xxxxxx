,drewkrew,2009-11-13T19:47Z,"I have a PAL wii that i downgraded from V3.4E firmware to V3.2E in order to use the soft-mod pack that installs PreLoader 0.27 and cIOScorp v1 (which installs customIOS rev7)
All my backup game discs ran in disc channel with very few problems ever.
The newest version of customIOS i could run was customIOS rev10, if i went any newer then original discs would no longer play.

I am now debating to get with the times and install PreLoader 0.30 and cIOScorp3.5 so that i am able to play newer games with the new copy protection or games that require newer IOS files. 

Does anyone know how likely this is too work with my system by simply updating preloader and installing cIOScorp v3.5? Are there any additional things i need to do or be aware about, for instance: do i need to replace my hacks.ini file for the new preloader or will it create one automatically during update? Will cIOScorp 3.5 risk messing up any IOS files on my system or risk losing my ability to run backup games via disc channel? 

It's all getting too confusing lol especially if you try and read up on the wii forums. Do i need to install customIOSrev13 or 14, and so on.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing enough to spend five min answering my confused queries... heheh"
