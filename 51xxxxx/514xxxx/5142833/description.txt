The Problem: Physics. The Solution: How to Solve Physics Problems No one says physics is easy, not even physics professor Bob Oman or microelectronics researcher Dan Oman. They struggled with physics as undergraduates, too, and know the physics student's lament--"I understood everything in lecture and the text, but I couldn't do the problems." That's why they wrote[KIHow to Solve Physics Problems. This book prepares you for physics exams by moving you directly into problem-solving. You learn to solve physics problems naturally and systematically as you read along--before you even know you're doing it--and in a way you simply can't forget. This book also helps you with your homework and gives you a preview of problems that will be on your exams. Plus you get good, solid advice on how to reduce study time, get maximum benefit from class, prepare for your exams effectively, and make your note-taking count. No matter how tough your textbook or how rigorous your course--whether you are studying calculus-based or non-calc physics--this book will help you understand more and improve your grade.
