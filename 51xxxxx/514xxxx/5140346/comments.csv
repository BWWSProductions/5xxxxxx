,Mr.Neji,2009-11-06T22:11Z,How do i seed?
,dptflint77,2009-11-28T00:28Z,"this ""game ranger sounds interesting. I hope to see you all there soon on EE."
,GLR457mAn,2009-12-06T20:04Z,"well sence ive posted this torrent ive seen like 7-9 new ppl out of 500+ ppl that has downloaded this. come on ppl it cant be that hard to install gameranger  & play online.

@dptflint77 i play all kinds of online games right now COD4 is my fav but i do play all my games from time to time. then yes mabe we will run into eachother."
,AB1993,2009-12-20T07:38Z,"The program installed fine, but I'm having some issues with the expansion pack. I unpacked the archive into the same directory which the original program is in i. e. c:/sierra but keep on getting an error message saying ""wrong CD inserted"" when I go to run the program. I made sure that I mounted the correct ISO in a virtual drive (using Daemon Tools) but can't seem to get past the error...any ideas? "
,GLR457mAn,2009-12-20T17:46Z,"@ AB1993:
i havnet tryed the expansion yet so it could be a # of things 1st you might want to try a diffrent EE-AOC.exe no cd crack. witch can be found on google or gamecopyworld.com.

also might be the ver of windows your using. x64 & or windows vista/7 try messing aorund with the combatibility modes.why i havent tested the expansion yet cus not many ppl play it on gameranger. most ppl play EE. i hope this helps."
,GLR457mAn,2009-12-20T17:51Z,"also this might be your problem.

****please note that playing on gameranger with ee_1000_1040_en.exe (1.4)  and or si_empireearth_update_en_1004_2000.exe (2.0)**** AKA THE PATCHS.
installed might not work online. you can test it on your own time with a friend. the new lobby port is 8585 for the si patch.

playing with just the game installed & mounted and no patchs aka game ver 1.0 with the 1.0 nocd works just fine gameranger."
,Blazez3212,2010-01-19T05:04Z,"I see you riped the info off myy torrent and put it on your with out citing it -_- but Gameranger is the official online community for EE it is Save EE Lobby
Save ee has 200 or more ppl online daily"
,MRJOVE04,2010-02-13T04:24Z,"So i did this:

Download
-Mount to ISO
-Run Disk/INstall

but after installation it says insert disk when its already in there...

sorry to say but the instructions really confused me.... :("
,Rushedby,2010-06-03T17:22Z,"The game works, but when I start it up i only see empty squares like where singleplayer and multiplayer should be, what should i do?"
,GLR457mAn,2010-06-18T23:07Z,"#1 @ Blazez3212: its my own cd copy that i riped this off of so dont go telling ppl i rip this of you trying to steal my fame. ever heard of gamecopy i guess not...

#2 @ VuKu_the_GreaT: ""Dont download this file. Host did a very poor job on mounting the image and files"" 

wth are you even talking about? O-o

""Once the game is installed and all cd cracks have been applied it crashes.""

try reading the instructions in full im sure there something you missed when putting all this together... or try compatibility modes with the games cracked exe...

""Once you execute the command it tries to accept a connection from an outside source which im assuming is GLR... DON'T DOWNLOAD""

and i would love too see some proof on this claim!! ;-)

im assuming that you never got the game running & that your mad because of that reason & is now on here being a troll... all my uploads has been scanned by avg, malwarebites, spysweeper, and avast. not including the online web scanner's thay have out now days.. all turn up 100% clean.. have had over 300+ dler's & your the only one complaining about this...

VuKu_the_GreaT get a life kid..."
,GLR457mAn,2010-06-18T23:17Z,"@ Rushedby: try turrning off windows Aero... for alot of older games Aero makes the gfx all messed up & screwy.. 

also check & fool around with the compatibility modes on the games exe... hope this helps ;-)"
,jrp577,2010-06-18T23:20Z,"@ VuKu_the_GreaT
glr and i have been playing games and stuff together for awhile now and i download stuff from him all the time and not once has he tried to give me a virus or get in my pc

i had no trouble getting this to work on my pc so idk what your prob is but this torrent is 100% clean"
,GLR457mAn,2010-07-02T04:40Z,"oh btw another place to play this @ is http://www.tunngle,net"
,Blazez3212,2010-07-03T17:02Z,Actually you stupid you ripped this copy from me thats why u posted the same information as me and you downloaded EE1 from me and EEAOC from someone off here as well thats why people have problems with your crap that was not yous and think again no one plays crap games on game ranger especially for EE its Call Save EE Lobby Dumb F*ck
,Blazez3212,2010-07-03T17:05Z,One more thing Dont steal from other peoples rips and calls them your own for this ripp its mine and someone elese and guess whos ripp came first...mine :) and guess whos is heavy seeded and gets downloads under 10mins....mines :)

#3 your torrent has more complaints then what mines does..

#4 you dont even know wth your talking about!! have you even installed & loged into gameranger you little troll?? theres a huge list of ee game's being hosted/played there.. 

#5 as far as how many seeds & leachers go the only reason why your sh!it half brokin more complaints torrent has is because you posted before i did.. not with that being said doesnt mean its dled & reposted by someone else..  like ive said before its from my own stuff your yours or anyones elses.. stop being a troll & fu(k off you little sewer rat..."

,Blazez3212,2010-09-08T03:49Z,reactor stfu its not right to steal crap from my group
[T],reactor90,2010-09-18T02:45Z,Then direct me to the rules of this web site where that it says its wrong...fing moron im going to steal some of your torrents and reup them just for the fuck of it.

,psychoticdouche,2010-10-01T09:46Z,so...much...trolling...
,psychoticdouche,2010-10-02T00:07Z,"Hey dude, not accusing anybody of anything, just having a problem.
So I installed the game and expansion and applied the patch, then overwrote the executables with the cracks. Both games will open and go through all the ads and stuff, and play their intros, but then they crash, giving a ""microsoft c++ runtime library"" error. Can anyone assist me here?
And regardless of whether this works out, thank you for your effort. It is much appreciated."
,GLR457mAn,2010-10-02T23:01Z,"sounds like your c++ visual is missing/broken & or out dated..

plz note & copy & paste links.
this is for 32bit os only.. you can find 64 vers of the c++ at the same site.

that should fix your issue."
,psychoticdouche,2010-10-06T18:50Z,"Meh, didn't work. It talks about EE requesting that Visual C++ ""terminate in an unusual way."" I honestly think that is a terrible way of wording it, cuz it makes windows sound like a whiny bitch who's always gotta have it exactly her way, but whatever....I've tried a lot of things to get this to work and nothing has, so I'm about ready to give up. Thanks for your help though! I really appreciate it."
,psychoticdouche,2010-10-06T19:16Z,"Also, I think now that the reason this won't work is cuz I'm trying to run it on a toshiba mini laptop (nb305-n310). Now before anyone rages at me for being retarded, EE2 works fine on it. I mean, it runs slow on lowest settings, but it runs. So, I figured EE1 would work better, and I heard it was way better than the second one. Again, thanks for the help."
,AzureSN,2010-10-10T01:34Z,"Thanks for the game dude, I'll be seeding for a month from now."
,zoltek,2010-10-11T23:48Z,"Dude, I followed the instructions, and put the cracks where they need to be, but neither of these games works for me. I am running windows XP on an acer mini. I've tried the compatibility modes for windows 2000, but both empire earth and the expansion crash every time. I'm going to try updating it and see if it works."
,zoltek,2010-10-12T00:16Z,Updating the program isn't working either. Wat do?
,psychoticdouche,2010-10-18T01:38Z,"Zoltek, you sound like you're having the exact same problem I've been having. I tried SO many different things that at this point I'm just convinced its a compatibility issue with mini netbooks that nobody has a fix for. BUT if you DO find something, pleasepleasePLEASE post it here. I would love you SO much for it, in a bromance way."
,Metal-music,2010-10-24T18:56Z,soooo umm... can anyone confirm this actually works?
,Stevestain,2011-01-02T21:23Z,"Both original and expansion work. I couldnt get the patches to work for the regular game though. both play fine on my vista without tampering with anything. Instructions were easy to follow. I didnt bother with the two extra things he gave us, so you are on your own with those as far as legitimacy goes. I took a peek in my appdata folder and didnt see anything strange such as a keylogger or other malware but who knows, maybe it could come later. I give you all that i can give in this comment, and i would like to say that viruses and trojans and the like are so incredibly easy to remove that as long as you get a working torrent from it(and this indeed does work) who gives a shit if you get one or not. If i get a virus or something ill come back and leave a comment that i did, if i didnt then i wont return here. Hope this helps. Goodluck and Godspeed "
,Synochra,2011-01-28T18:38Z,"Heh, this goes so dam fast.....having 1mb/s right now.
Ima seed this for a couple of time, thank you GLR457mAn :)"
,Synochra,2011-01-28T19:58Z,"Oh...I don't get the Expansion running, it just keeps crashing me to the desktop :""(
Any solutions for this?"
,Shawn64,2011-02-23T08:17Z,@ Synochra     I'm going to look into this and attempt to help you and everyone else as best as I can. I've used GLR457mAn's torrents before (Diablo 2 and AOE 2) and never had troubles in the past. Post once I have it working or if I have no problems. Using XP here btw
,Shawn64,2011-02-23T09:19Z,"Ok, I downloaded the game and I had no problems what so ever. However, I did skip the instructions because some of it didn't make sense. So heres what I did: 1. Mounted ISO for normal Empire Earth, let it install. 2. Forget the first crack for the game (1.0), it just gets in the way, and messes with the patching. Instead go ahead and let the patches do their thing, then once the game is version 2.0, put on the 2.0 crack. CD key is in the read me in the Patches zip. 3. mount the ISO for Art of Conquest and let it install, then just put in the crack. all I needed to do. Thanks again for the torrent GLR457mAn. "
,diggerRACT,2011-05-14T06:52Z,just to let you know i have both glr and blazez page up and there exactly the same info and glr even said on blazez he trolls my pages and whatever so glr epic fail my friend and ill never download ur shit cause ur a filthy dog that cant get ur own shit... and blazez stfu mate u carry on with shit when ur dl sucks thats why glr sucks as well

,GLR457mAn,2011-06-10T19:07Z,"@ diggerRACT oh yeah speaking of Blazez3212 if you havent noticed he doesnt even host, yet alone seed this what you claim, ""so called stolen same copy"" of EE no longer anyways.. and when he did it was the only thing he did upload. (so that shows who stoled of who? EH yeah dumb ass..)

,poliety,2011-07-05T17:20Z,"psychoticdude, EE1 doesn't work for netbooks/mini laptops, i have no idea why. i've tried running EE1 on 3 different netbooks and none worked. i tried it on a regular laptop and it worked fine."

,GhostRider2334,2011-12-17T07:42Z,"Ok, here's how to install the game:

1.Use Deamon tools or another disk image emulator to mount the ISO file.

2.If auto play doesn't appear, then go to computer and click the empire earth drive and click setup.

3.Follow the instructions to install empire earth then go back to where you found the ISO file and click the application named 'ee_1000-1040_en'.

4.Just keep clicking OK to install the patch then click the application named 'si_empireearth_update_en_1004_2000'.

5.Keep clicking OK again then, after you've completed the setup extract the ZIP file using WinRAR.

6.Open the folder you've just extracted then copy the empire earth application in the folder and paste it where you installed empire earth in.

7.Enjoy the game and if there are any problems, then you must have done something wrong or something is wrong with your computer.

--------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have deamon tools or WinRAR, just search on google."
,mnhtapu,2012-01-09T15:22Z,This torrent works perfectly. Just installed the game and it's working fine. I'm using vista 32bit. no problem at all. To all noobs follow the instruction by GhostRider2334.
,DarkzuL00,2012-03-12T23:45Z,"Thx for this torrent!!! It works perfectly, both Empire Earth and its Expansion!
Btw the difficulty selector patch for the campaigns was a nice surprise :) I was looking for that.

The only thing it needed was another No-CD for Empire Earth, cus the one that comes with the torrent didnt worked for me at least. (i have windows xp pro). So in step 5 and 6 of GhostRider2334, use this No-CD:
http://www.save-ee.com/downloads.php?sid=0cb1a0be8f16bdc59ad1294c5d63f518

Replace the original exe in the Empire Earth folder with this no-cd.

Just follow GhostRider2334 explanation to install it correctly :)
If some1 got lost in the explanation, when he talks about 'ee_1000-1040_en' and 'si_empireearth_update_en_1004_2000' they're both in 'Empire earth patchs.rar'

Thx again!! I'll be seeding for a couple of months."
,DarkzuL00,2012-03-13T00:12Z,"If anyone is interested in trainers that works with EE ver.2, to get infinite resources and population in the campaigns, u can get em in these links:
(click the trainer #1)
http://www.cheathappens.com/1832-PC-Empire_Earth_cheats

Use this trainer for the expansion:
http://www.cheathappens.com/6523-PC-Empire_Earth_Art_of_Conquest_cheats

You have to copy each trainer to the game folder. Run the trainer FIRST and CLICK THE 'RUN GAME' button. It wont work if u just run the game using the desktop or startup icon.
Once in-game use keys 1 2 3 or 4 to select the cheats. 5 resets to no cheats.
Fast build doesn't work (at least for me)
Have fun!"
,DarkzuL00,2012-03-18T02:55Z,"In the expansion Art of Conquest, i think i found a tiny bug, in the mission briefings of the campaigns, theres a map on the background, but i think it should show detailed cities and battles with their names, like in EE.

Anyone else has this bug? Is there a patch to fix it? I know its not even important but i was wondering if its normal, or if theres a patch for it. I googled but with no luck.
I'll continue seeding this great game ^^"
,j5ize,2012-05-05T12:45Z,"Works perfect. Great UL GLR457mAn.

Follow the directions GhostRider2334 spelled out for you, and you won't have any problems.

And for the supernoobs, the ''ee_1000-1040_en'' and ""si_empireearth_update_en_1004_2000"" applications are in the ""Empire earth patches"" rar file."
