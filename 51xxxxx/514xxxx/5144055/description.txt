If you have downloaded the audiobook
The Gathering Storm - The Wheel of Time Book 12,
you have received 4 big chunks of files without chapters:

The Gathering Storm pt 1.mp3
The Gathering Storm pt 2.mp3
The Gathering Storm pt 3.mp3
The Gathering Storm pt 4.mp3

This release allows you to quickly split these 4 files up
into the correct chapters, numbered and with correct titles,
without any loss of quality at all!

----------------------------------
please support macmillan.com
and buy some of their audiobooks
at their store or at itunes!
----------------------------------

All you need to do is install the freeware program
mp3DirectCut - which is included and virusfree!
(if you dont trust me, just download it yourself!)

Please put the 4 .cue and .mpd files into the same
directory where your .mp3 files for TGS are.

--- The Gathering Storm pt 1.mp3 ---

Start mp3DirectCut,
goto File->open
select the file "part1.mpd" and open it!

It will automatically open your first audiobook mp3 file.
(just make sure it has the same name as listed above!)

goto: File->save split...
in the dialog, enter:

Filename creation: %N %T
%N begins with: 1
and put a check on "create ID3 tags"

then just click OK, and wait till the the process finishes
(takes about 30 seconds)

--- The Gathering Storm pt 2.mp3 ---

open the part2.mpd file and goto file->save split

in the dialog change: %N begins with 14 !!!!!!
                      =================

(This way you get the chapters correctly numbered in sequence!
 Each file has a macmillan intro and outro,
 which you should later just rename, so you dont need to
 listen to them in the middle of the book.
 you can keep these files, or delete them later)

--- The Gathering Storm pt 3.mp3 ---

open the part3.mpd file and goto file->save split

in the dialog change: %N begins with 29 !!!!!!
                      =================

--- The Gathering Storm pt 4.mp3 ---

open the part4.mpd file and goto file->save split

in the dialog change: %N begins with 41 !!!!!!
                      =================

All Done! Now you can move or rename
the various macmillan intro/outro files.
The final result should look like this:

PS. If you're in the mood to listen to some new
cool music by Lena Katina / t.A.T.u
(the sexy russian pseudo lesbian electronic duo)
just goto yuotube and enter "t.a.t.u."

I love these chicks, couldn't help to advertise them here!
Lena is working on a solo-album currently!

PPS. had to include 2 mp3 files to get the file bigger,
since some trackers have a minimum size for torrents.
