This is a greatest of movies and has been out of print for all too many years.
Ms. Greta Scacchi gives arguably the best performance of a British actress of
all time. If your tastes are supreme, you wont want to miss out on "White
mischief". As of this writing, and despite appearances at some sites, it has yet to 
make it to DVD NTSC format for north america audiences or elsewhere for that matter, 
having been released only on VHS here, a movie now more than 20 years, since it was 
made. See the best movie review of this feature here: 
http://moviesbyrizzo.info/white_mischief.html  Great enough quality conversion from
PAL DVD (into English format) 720X576 DivX resolution, with 750K min video bitrate.
128k audio. Perhaps we'll see this one on NTSC DVD format someday when the producers
wake up to what it is they are inanely sitting on. In the meantime, Greta's fans 
certainly shouldnt be deprived as no doubt she has been of her due. This is one of
the best movies ever made. This is a version all fans of great taste are entitled
to, under the circumstances, in my respectful submission here. 
Also starring Mr. Charles Dance and Mr. Joss Ackland, John Hurt. Mr. Michael Radford, Writer/Director

enjoy!
