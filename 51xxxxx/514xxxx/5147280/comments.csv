,xal1983,2009-11-05T15:21Z,Does not validate in abgx360 :(
,xal1983,2009-11-05T16:05Z,"This is what I get: 

Checking PFI
     PFI CRC = 05C6C409
PFI does not match known data (could be corrupt or a new wave not seen before)
Displaying suspicious PFI in hex and ascii:

,ElCaza,2009-11-06T00:12Z,It's wave 4???
,xal1983,2009-11-06T14:41Z,"No, as far as I know, PES 2010 is wave 3."
,Morloky,2009-11-06T15:16Z,its works ? Someone tried to boot?
,ElCaza,2009-11-07T00:04Z,this doesn't works on my NTSC console with ixtreme 1.6
,Ant-goes,2009-11-07T01:17Z,"Well I have to say that i have downloaded the game with the usual methods but the dashboard in my console says play dvd, knowing that i have Ixtreme 1.6 which is ok for wave 3 game.

But when i tried the activate iso trick for wave 4 games i got this game working with no problem at all.

Airgo its not Wave 3  "
,Morloky,2009-11-07T02:52Z,"Then work with the boot disk? 
This means that the Wave 4! 
I will write and test."
,Morloky,2009-11-07T21:43Z,works with boot disk or ixtreme 1.51.
,ElCaza,2009-11-08T07:57Z,"Works on my console with ixtreme 1.6 with a boot disk. Thanks!. It's in English and Francais, no Spanish."
