Plenty of seeders and a fast download!"

Thanks for the constructive comment but this torrent is for those who wanted a one stop DL instead of looking for 3 separate torrents. In addition these files all have their proper episode titles....

But to each their own, as long as people seed,  it doesn't really matter to me. Hope everyone enjoys and if there is anything in particular people are looking for, let me know (I prefer to do complete seasons vs single episodes but whatever) When this torrent has seeded 100% I will be putting the first 4 seasons of supernatural for anyone interested."
,Angel44,2009-12-18T00:03Z,Thanks. Just what I was looking for. 1 stop shopping.

,pLeXxY,2010-12-20T17:59Z,"S01E01: questionable video quality with macro-blocking.
ALL Season TWO files are incorrectly named as Season ONE ie. S01E01 vs S02E01"
,potteringpleb,2010-12-28T17:39Z,Downloaded this for S2 - poor image quality for the first episode of s2.
