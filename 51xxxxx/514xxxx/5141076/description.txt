P L O T



A call girl goes to a priest to confess a sin she

hasn't committed yet: she plans to kill herself on her

next birthday. Then she disappears and he goes looking

for her, enlisting the help of an ad hoc congregation

of troubled souls along the way. A story about

forgiveness, based on Patrick Coyle's award winning

original screenplay
