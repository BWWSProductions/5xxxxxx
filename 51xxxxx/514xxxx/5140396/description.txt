The Adventure of a Lifetime. An action packed adventure, full of laughs and heroics.

Based on H. Rider Haggard's celebrated novel, this "fast moving" action safari stars Richard Chamberlain (The Thorn Birds) and Oscar nominee Sharon Stone (Casino). Commissioned by the stunning Jessie Huston (Stone) to find her explorer father in Africa, rugged adventurer Allan Quartermain (Chamberlain) must contend with Nazis, cannibals, a jungle full of dangerous animals... and the wiles of the woman who hired him! As Allan and Jessie near the spot where here father was last seen - the legendary King Solomon's Mines - they encounter more danger... and breathtaking excitement... than even they had bargained for!
