  From Recorded Books:

  Creator of New York Times best-seller, The Notebook, Nicholas Sparks touches readersâ€™ deepest emotions with his spellbinding novels. This magical story, A Walk to Remember, tells of a truly unexpected love - one that changes a young manâ€™s life forever.

  Class of â€™59 high school senior Landon Carter spends his time trying to stay out of trouble in the small town of Beaufort, North Carolina. The last person heâ€™d ever fall for is quiet Jamie Sullivan, the Baptist ministerâ€™s daughter. But when he waits too long to get a date for the homecoming dance, sheâ€™s the only one left to ask. While his friends make jokes about the unlikely couple, he decides this will be their first and last date. But Jamie has a way of shaking up his plans, and Landonâ€™s life goes down a path he never dreamed possible. A master storyteller, Nicholas Sparks transports you to a simpler time and place. Youâ€™ll find yourself smiling through your tears with Frank Mullerâ€™s heartwarming performance.


  From Wiki:

  The novel, set in the mid-1950s in Beaufort, North Carolina, is a story of two teenagers who fall in love with each other despite the disparity of their personalities. A Walk to Remember is adapted in the film of the same name.

  It spent nearly six months in the best-seller list on hardcover, and an additional four months on paperback.
