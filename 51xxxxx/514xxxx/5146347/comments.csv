""This is buggy crack it's work all the time for someone and for someone do not work""

I think this is happening to those that tried to install others versions of VRAY without success. So complete remove any installation of VRAY,  use CCLEANER and clean registry, manually find any related vray reference in registry (run regedit) and delete all of them.

Update 3DS Max 2010 here:

http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/index?siteID=123112&id=2334435&linkID=9241178

Autodesk 3ds Max 2010 Service Pack 1
and
Hotfix - Autodesk速 3ds Max速 2010 - 2009.09.22

Now try a clean install of VRAY 1.5 SP3a to 3DS Max 2010 following installation steps.

,jeminnovations,2009-12-06T17:51Z,Can anyone help me find vray 1.5 for Cinema4D can`t find it anywhere? Also looking for Evermotion archinteriors in a format that C4D can work with. All i can find is Max Files. Any help someone can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much 
,xLocklin,2010-01-03T16:36Z,"Just FYI, this crack worked for me.

I didn't read the comments about it being bullshit until about half-way through the VRAY install and got all disappointed. I finished it, and tried it out anyway to see if there was a watermark and what would you know, no watermark. :D and fully featured!

So if you want VRAY, you apparently have a 50/50 install chance. Follow the instructions exactly and pray."
,aaurnab,2010-02-03T18:01Z,it's totaly bulshit...amazlng  is right
,nosc1,2010-02-04T19:41Z,"Hi Guys,iam lookin for some one 2 edit my modern warfare2 sniper quick scope videos,I just dont have that creative touch....! "
,noonereally101,2010-02-17T16:19Z,yeah its buggy as hell. If you render animation it slowly goes black with camera shake. Also some frames have watermarks. Its good for maybe a single image render but thats about it
,dank_nug,2010-07-08T04:01Z,"seems to work so far!!! just follow directions and you should be able to get this to work. getting cc cleaner is really easy and easy to use. so do it if you want vray!!! i will edit this post saying whether my renderings came out up to par, but so far so good!"
,dank_nug,2010-07-08T05:52Z,"at first, my renders seem to take fucking hours for what took 2 seconds before... idk is anyone else having the same problem"
,villich1,2011-11-28T19:18Z,It works perfect on my lappy and most important i managed to install it on my own so thank you very much :)
