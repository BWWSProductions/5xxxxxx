,radiohead12,2009-11-07T03:16Z,How do you turn off the English Subtitles?
,rape4fun,2009-11-08T05:27Z,delete or take the .srt file out of the folder to remove the subs
,thevanillatony,2009-11-15T19:35Z,"Is the subtitles in the video? Because I can get rid of them. I deleted all other files, and turned off subs in quicktime X. Can I fix it or is it part of the movie. Other than that, great download."

,Kukomawa,2009-11-29T23:12Z,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but when using mkv2vob it says that the conversion is complete, but the end result is only the first 39 minutes or so, what should I do differently?

I have mkv2vob v2.4.6.

Thanks for all the help (and for the upload)!

I found nothing wrong with this torrent, however it should be noted that the Directors Cut contains nudity, albeit just a few seconds of it. Something you didn't see in theaters."
,camj,2009-12-24T09:25Z,"""MPAA: Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.; Rated R for some violence and brief nudity. (director's cut)""

intense sci-fi violence is pg 13, but ""some"" violence and nudity is R... lol "
,jeff2999,2010-01-03T02:51Z,"i looked at the topless scene with moon, and quite frankly. it sucked. it was a nightime scene, and all you see are saggy sideboob from afar. no nipples.

,sitlet,2010-01-03T21:34Z,anyone else getting slow speeds?  i've been under 4kb the past 2 days....
,dancerboy,2010-01-07T10:18Z,extremely low speeds on this torrent.. sometimes i struggle to get over 4-5 kb/s but most of the time its around 30 kb/s
,chrome1,2010-01-11T22:59Z,"this copy has subtitles but you can multiplex them out by using a program like tsMuxer, deselecting the .srt file and remuxing. easy and there are no annoying subtitles any longer."
,ryuvsakuma,2010-01-23T04:13Z,i hope this high res movie is going faster than the other ones
,dbuzolic,2010-01-23T11:58Z,"this movie seems to have some bas issues with sound, dont know how to explain cause not good in english but crappy audio 4 sure, it is DTS but not clear....video is 10.

Anyone notice this?"
,somedude.1001,2010-01-29T14:40Z,"10/10, movie is 6 though. Im a fan of the series and this is a big letdown. Even T3 was better."

,jzaw,2010-02-19T21:36Z,"pls let me know what the sound format is DolbyDigital 6ch ... DTS 6ch or AAC ?

I need to know cos I CAN'T play AAC via my digi-amp and need it to be one of the other two

,Zendra,2010-06-06T23:59Z,"@ tigomir
I supose it's because of DTS sound and your media player doesn't have the ability or isn't configured to downsample it to stereo so you can here it. So download k-lite codec pack and in it you will have media player clasic or use splayer and it will work. "
,kn33grows,2010-07-31T03:35Z,@cliffcali4 you must be a n00b here bc the tracker for tpb was taken down months ago and it was a big deal!!! where the fuck were you!?!?!?!?
