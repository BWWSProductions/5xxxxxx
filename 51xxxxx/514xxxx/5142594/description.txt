I have tried for a long time, when I have heard these recordings on other pressings, to describe exactly why I am so eternally attached to Callas and her voice. I believe that no other artist, save for Van Gogh or Michelangelo, and I do put her in that pantheon of genius, was able to transform suffering into great art through music, and create a distinguished legacy for all future generations to hear. 

When she cries "Euridyce! Euridyce! Mortel silence, vaine Ã©spÃ©rance!" I am transported down into the underworld with OrphÃ©, searching for my lost lover and fighting off despair with every note. And so it is with every single cut on this CD set.



Enjoy and Seed!!
