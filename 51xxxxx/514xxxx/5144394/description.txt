Believe it or not, I (balleron24z) am an r&b and hip-hop artist.  I have made 2 cd's so far, the first one being straight crap, I'll admit, but this 2nd one, was a quality made cd.  I finished it July 16th of 2009, and just now decided to release it for free.  So with that being said, I hope you enjoy this album, as I put a lot of work into it.  Please leave feedback, and check out my myspace as well at www. myspace . com / trypmynemusic

Also, if you don't like it, let me know, but don't be a dickface about it, tell me what you like, what you don't like, elaborate on it. Even though I used autotune (i can sing without, voice was rough while making album though), don't just be like "thats straight shit" cause it isn't.  Straight shit would be a rapper who is off rhythm, the beat blows, etc. but yeah.  Let me know what you think.
