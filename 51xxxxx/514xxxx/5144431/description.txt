Contained herein are many, many, primary sources relating to Nazi occultism and what Goodrick-Clarke termed "Ariosophy". My motivation in making this torrent available is not to promote Nazism itself or racism but instead to make available to conspiracy researchers and others source material that has largely been inaccessible in the U.S. and the UK. There's a reason that it's been inaccessible: it's all in German. All of the texts in the torrent are in German with one exception: an English translation of Lanz von Liebenfel's "Theozoologie", which is unavailable elsewhere. "The Secret of the Runes" by Guido von List has not been included because an English edition is widely available through Inner Traditions Publications. My hope is that there are a few people within the world of Anglo=American research on these subjects who speak enough German to be able to either translate the texts into English or else to meaningfully use them in preparation of further works on the subject. 

I should also mention that just because an author has written about Germanic subjects doesn't mean that they are automatically racist, or anti-semitic. While some authors such as Liebenfels clearly were, others such as List were less so, even though they may have supported vÃ¶lkisch ideas.
