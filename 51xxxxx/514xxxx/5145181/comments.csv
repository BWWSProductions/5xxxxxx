Both video and audio are better than those in ""Land Of The Lost[2009]DvDrip-LW-[Bit-Byte]"" release (the most annoying issue there is an out of sync audio, but here it's just fine). There may be better quality rips out there, but out of these two I recommend [vice]'s.

And the movie itself is awesome!"
