,uzielvb,2009-10-30T20:28Z,what is vista7?
,n00byguy,2009-11-02T04:52Z,"This works with Vista and 7. Probably made by Hazar, all the previous ones have worked. Emulates OEM activation. Have used it on 7 Ult x64 and 7 Home Premium x32."
,kalknagel,2010-01-01T17:44Z,Seems to work just fine on Windows 7 pre activated. I needed this because the virtual machine I installed it in emulates old hardware. It has no bios slic available to complete the activation. Thanks for this patch!
,hexenII,2010-01-05T02:37Z,This patch should be installed before or after win 7 installation?
