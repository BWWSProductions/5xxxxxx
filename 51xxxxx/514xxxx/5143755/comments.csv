You have to have your system modded first of all.  Second you need to download Img burn to burn the .iso

http://imgburn.en.softonic.com/

Download that.  Then begin downloading torrents with uTorrent (which you also have to Download if you havent already).. then you unzip the file using winrar then burn the .iso with Img burn on a low setting.. 4 or 8x works best.  You can also check out yourube for tutorials if you dont understand "

My console is chipped,and I can play a lot other games i loaded.
Im using isoburn,this program works for *iso and *.img files..
This files from this torrent are unpacked,but not any iso/img file...
Only a file called default.XBE..
This is my problem.."
,Ex-A-Byte,2009-12-23T00:36Z,"If this works, it is GREAT!

For anyone who doesn't know how to use this, just, use FTP to transfer the files to a folder on the XboX harddrive. Then play :) This is the easiest possible!

I'll report if it (doesn't) work ;)

I notice the 'maps' folder, does that make possible to play custom maps?"
,Ex-A-Byte,2009-12-23T09:39Z,"looked good to me at first, but freezes after I had to press start.. I'll ftp files once more, in case some bytes didn't get through, but I don't know anymore .."
,battle21,2009-12-26T09:03Z,you can play this game with cxbx it can convert xbe files to windows executables.

,Evox91,2010-08-11T20:52Z,"hey, i DLed and converted into an ISO with Qwix, burned it onto a disk, and used it with my hardmodded xbox, the multiplayer works flawlessly, but when i tried to play the campaign it gave me an error saying i failed to load the map, everything else works perfectly. Any Ideas about this or possible fixes? Or has anyone else had this problem in the past?"
