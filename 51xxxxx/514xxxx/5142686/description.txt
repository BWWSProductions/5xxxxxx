An excellent recording of these wondefully charming works! The performance shows a true understanding of the Mozartian style, and repeated listenings only reveal greater treasures in both the works and the performances (I've lost track of how many times I have listened to it by now!). 

I love the real chamber music approach that all the performers take (as opposed to some who treat these works like mini flute concerti!) - one feels like you are listening to a beautiful, intimate conversation among great friends. 



Enjoy and Seed!!
