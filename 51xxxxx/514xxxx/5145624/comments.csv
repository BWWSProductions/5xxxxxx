,ICanHaz,2009-11-29T16:00Z,"Please don't label something that is 1280x544 as 720p. 

Nevertheless, great quality rip!"
,DeadScapa1,2009-12-02T15:13Z,"Picture works perfectly, and so does ""background"" sounds BUT somehow it lacks so called ""main"" sounds. 

What I mean is, that I cant hear people talking. In screen comes crap like รถlxรถsdl รถcllc which makes no sense to me.

Help with these 2 problems please? 

@raymondhome: Great share, tyvm."

It is 720p, they just removed the black bars as they just waste bitrate. Read up on aspect radios."
,cbehr64,2010-02-12T15:59Z,great quality 10/10. i would have used a better container than avi tho have you ever used handbrake or ripbot they make excelent mp4 mkv and avchd rips. cheers mate

,Mathlol,2010-09-28T02:17Z,"Great torrent.

@raymondhome More importantly, I fail to see why you still use avi for high res movies.  It is not favorable in reproduction by any means other than a pc.  Bad form  "
[V],GoodFilms,2010-10-21T22:34Z,"MUCH better quality:

,amans,2011-03-25T10:43Z,"Great upload like all of the POTC uploaded by raymondhome. Perfect video although a little lack of sound crispiness, should consider adding external 2CH sound to it. You sir makes my day much happier. 10/10."
