,HypnoMystery,2009-12-22T08:25Z,"Thank-You so much for all of the Kasha uls.  I know she's not your favorite but I like her best of all--yes, even better than Lady Christine.

PS  I've been out of commission for a while for lots of reasons but now I'm back to enjoying serving the Goddess!"

I think Kasha is as good as it gets."

I want to enjoy serving the Goddess as well, do you have any suggestion?  Please let me know if I can e-mail you to some address.

Also I know of a place where you can find people interested in the subject, but I don't know if I should advertise it here."
