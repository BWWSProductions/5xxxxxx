,Valamyr,2009-10-31T15:53Z,"You have no idea how ridiculously jealous I am that this is not the PC version.

This being said I have a confirmed report from a friend of PS3 version reaching customers, so that version will surely be leaked early too.

Where is the PC love?? :("
,Valamyr,2009-10-31T15:55Z,seeing an unconfirmed report of a PC version on usenet... stay tuned...
,DaveTehSlave,2009-10-31T16:38Z,"Yes, I'm waiting with bated breath for the PC version. It hasn't shown up yet at my private tracker.

@Valamyr, glad to hear there's a real possibility for a PC release this weekend. Hopefully today XD"
,ShineEyes,2009-10-31T17:08Z,"@Valamyr

Doesn't matter if the PS3 version ""leaks"", as there is no way to play PS3 backups.  PC version, however...that I could go for :D"
,DaveTehSlave,2009-10-31T20:13Z,"@regret, obviously. I was hoping for a release today, though, as many people already have their copy from their pre-orders..."
,Flawlessjess,2009-11-01T10:56Z,Looks to be a good game 7gig is quite a large amount shame its not PC
,Malfice,2009-11-01T13:18Z,"Want pc version now!! :(

,zhao9us,2009-11-02T00:05Z,"y would anybody play this game on the console as opposed to the pc? It looks better and plays better on the pc, and (hopefully) there gonna b a load of user-generated content (lyk in oblivion) which is a hassel to get on the console (if u can get it at all that is...)"
,NoNic2,2009-11-02T00:56Z,lol first pc version is deleted for half year so xbox360 and ps3 can launch on same day and now console even gets rip first lol how fair is that? Pc version better be here tommorow )-:
,dragkhar,2009-11-03T07:27Z,"So we know this is a wave 4, But what about the rest of the info? Is this region free? Anything been altered to play for wave 3? Hate to download and find out i cant play it ^^"
,venom800tt,2009-11-03T09:33Z,"@ dragkhar
On the title when it says RF means Region Free, look at the title.

Im gonna get this on 360, my PC is piece of shit it cant even play 5 year old games "
,dragkhar,2009-11-04T02:10Z,"lmao, that went right over my head venom800tt. 
All in all i look forward to playing, 80% done!"
,sam19844,2009-11-04T11:27Z,"It's not RF, PAL doesn't work! Can somebody confirm maybe I had a bad burn. Thanks!"
,sam19844,2009-11-04T14:21Z,"Sorry fellas, works great!"
,dragkhar,2009-11-05T00:51Z,"I've gotten two diffrent torrents for this game, And both seem to have alot of issues when it comes to the new game movie, Anyone elce seeing this? I did notice when i ran it through Agbx it found a few errors to fix. Thx "
,Johighnes,2009-11-05T20:44Z,"For everyone: its Region Free.
But somethings not working correctly. Used the abgx360GUI as usual before burning and it says ""PFI does not match known data (could be corrupt or a new wave not seen before). And ""Video pertition does not match know data but neither did PFI, Stealth status is uncertain"".
Tried to burn it anyways and it failed miserably, twice. Anyone who succeeded and maybe has a tip please post."
,michan123,2009-11-06T10:59Z,theres another one out there...but its NTSC....will try this first and post back
,Johighnes,2009-11-06T12:06Z,"Okay, just found out about the activate.iso, burned one of those bad boys and put it in the xbox, took it out and inserted the burned dragon age: origins (which i thought was failed) and it works perfectly. So, thanks Morck22."
,snusaren,2009-11-07T12:31Z,"This didn't work for me, it doesn't seem to work on any PAL. I'm downloading the other one"
,Roby91,2009-11-08T13:52Z,Is this game italian?
,michan123,2009-11-08T19:27Z,"WORKS SWEEEETTTTT...ITS PAL
it was wierd...first burn didnt work, but then i patched and checked with abgx and NOW IT WORKS"
,michan123,2009-11-08T19:42Z,"@Johighnes

Try patching it with the video and PFI files (with the files u get when u dl the ""wave 4 to wave 3 torrent"" with abgx...I burned one dvd without the patch and it didnt work even with the boot disc...second patched disc works...stick in boot disc, wait for the xbox to say play dvd, take it out, stick in patched dvd and VOILA...goodluck"
,kaeoue,2009-11-15T23:02Z,I have burned this game about 3 times all after being patched from wave 4 to wave 3 and i cant get it to work. When i put the disc in all I see is the big xbox 360 logo. can anyone help?

,Tmux,2009-11-20T15:05Z,"Yep, it surely doesnt work if you only fix it with abgx or if you do nothing. I already waisted 2 discs, im quite pissed with these 4 wave games ! Waiting for newer iXtreme. "

,simonserenade,2009-11-23T16:40Z,"game works but only with the activate iso disk inserted first, kind of annoying having to switch disks but it has to do before the new i.extreme comes out"
,AceMurdera,2009-11-24T17:35Z,"@kaeoue and many others....

Maybe there should be a hints page or a page for beginners because I've seen the same question on this page about 3x and the solution is there 3x as well. If you come across a torrent that has 42 comments, and you encounter a problem with ANYTHING.... you should go right back and read every single comment, because your computer's not special... it's not the only one that glitches. SO STOP BEING LAZY AND READ A LITTLE!! IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!

Solution for the blind:
1. ONLY FOR MODDED SYSTEMS USING VERBATIM (OR BETTER) DUAL LAYER DISCS.

2. DOWNLOAD http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5133040/Xbox360-activate-iso

3. DOWNLOAD http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4726150/Cookies_Game_Burner_V3

4. INSTALL GAME BURNER, LOAD ACTIVATE.ISO, CHANGE BOOK TYPE FOR DL MEDIA TO DVD-ROM.

5. **CRITICAL** YOU MUST BURN ACTIVATE.ISO AT 4X SPEED (took less than a minute for me to burn) AND YOU MUST CLICK YES ON ALL THE PROMPTS, BURN IT ALL ON 1 LAYER!

6. POP IN ACTIVATE.ISO, RUN IT, AT THE WHITE SCREEN EJECT AND INSERT THE GAME. THE GAME SHOULD LOAD.

7. GOOD LUCK!"

region free and PAL/NTSC arent the same thing
you can still have RF that wont play on PAL/NTSC
its rare but happens, specifically theres
3 regions for NTSC and 4 regions of PAL.
RF.NTSC would boot on japan and USA machines for example, but nothing PAL ""aussie, euro""
where as a normal NTSC US region would not boot NTSC from japan."
,slickmic,2009-12-17T02:17Z,"Not sure if this is just a bad rip but I'm getting some serious glitches in the sound during the beginning cut scenes and it's also frozen on me a few times. The animations work fine.
I've burned quite a few games and not had this issue.

Anybody else have this problem? "
