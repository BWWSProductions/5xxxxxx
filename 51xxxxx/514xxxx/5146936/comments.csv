,Jack_Sin,2009-11-18T16:36Z,"I have downloaded a lot of your torrents before McTav, such as series of Family Guy and American Dad, with impressive quality for the compression and size of the files: Although one slight criticism, if you don't mind, is that you compress your files slightly too much reducing the quality. Every torrent I have downloaded off you has been quality, keep up the good work."
[S],velvet.,2009-11-21T08:00Z,Enjoy your green skull.
[V],McTav,2009-11-21T17:34Z,"Hey guys sorry ive been away for a while, TPB had reset the passwords to all vip and trusted members and i was having a slight problem getting my reset. anyways with that i got a fancy new green skull! i will start uploading again shortly.

and to adress jack sin.

that fact of the matter is, now a days most of the tv torrents you download are from a HD tv signal, that are actually better quality then the MPEG2 encoded dvds. to be honest the quality of some of the tv are infact better quality. HDTV rips are from a HD source they have a lot more to work with. And depending on what show im ripping, they may put 8-10 episodes onto one dvd, so instead of compressing a show that is in HD and roughly around 2gigs, im compressing a show that is 720x480 and anywhere from 600-900mbs.

HD tv is amazing picture, dvds are what they are. I dont claim that my rips are the best looking video out there, but i assure you that they are the best ""dvdrips"" availible

i should also mention, of course with a larger file size they could be better, but i choose to encode them with what people are familiar with. When i started releasing stuff it was so people could see great shows that they may not have seen before. And there hasnt really been anyone that ive seen that just rips tv series. If more then anything i wanted to archive these shows so people may be able to watch the years down the road.

lets hope all those words make sense "

,superpakk,2010-02-18T23:40Z,thank you so so much! downloaded almost all your torrents.. all great quality! you seem to upload only comedies... what series are you planning on posting next? How I Met Your Mother? 
[V],McTav,2010-02-20T08:56Z,"@superpakk

yea looking at my dvds right now, basically everything i own is comedy other then las vegas. which is a friggen great show! but yea seems its all gonna be comedy. right now im in the process of upping simpsons 1-12, and when ever its out ""Community"" will be extremely high on the to do list. when those are all done it could either be, Corner Gas ( a great canadian comedy), King of the hill, which im reluctant to start as they only has seasons 1-6 on dvd and it may stay that way, futurama, Dilbert the animated series, or some other stuff, not sure yet"
,REAPER18,2010-03-03T15:46Z,"Hey McTav, big fan of yours. Thank you so much for all the great comedy.

A superb comedy series that NEEDS to be in your collection is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

Can't wait for more of your uploads. +"
,LeX-XP,2010-03-12T16:46Z,"hey McTav even though you said only comedy how about uploading ""House MD""?
