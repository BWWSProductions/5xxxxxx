Bodycall emerged on the Dark Independent scene only recently, however the band is not a newcomer, as they have been active since 2002. Their style evolved from oldshool ebm and synthopop sounds to crystalize as modern and quite aggresive dark electro / aggrotech. Fast, danceable "trancy" songs with screaming raw vocals are trademark of this band and this is what you can expect from "Mechanically Recovered Meat".
