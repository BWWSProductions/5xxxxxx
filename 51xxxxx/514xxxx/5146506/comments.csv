[V],joshua13,2009-11-28T13:35Z,"so you are saying the bible appears to be an honest and truthful record of the flawed (aren't we all) humans God spoke through. One does't make this kind of thing up up about people one is presenting as ""the good guys"" or ""the people who were at least trying to serve God"" Thus the Bible shows God neither expects nor demands perfection in his followers  (while still holding that as an ideal) and in fact demonstrates forgiveness. The Qur'an (written centuries later) presents a sanitized fantasy version (aka as  lying by omission) of some of the same people for propaganda purposes. Which authors would YOU trust more?"
