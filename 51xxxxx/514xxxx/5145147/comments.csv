,xSveinix,2009-11-05T18:51Z,"Hey.
I use BitLord 1.1 to download torrents, but lately i've been having some trouble downloading some of the torrents.

""Windows XP ICF Status: Firewall port can't be opened.""

Thats the message I get and I was kinda hoping that maybe some of you knew what to do?
Normally I would just look for another torrent, and i did, but none of em will start downloading :S"
,Dezzo90p,2009-11-07T14:17Z,"@amo300 I added trackers from random torrents.
@extremezone Thanks, i'll be checking into that.
@'Anyone' If eztv's trackers doesn't work why can't they be replaced or fixed? (Just asking, not whining)"
,Dezzo90p,2009-11-07T16:52Z,"Double/Final post: I changed from Bitlord to uTorrent and now when i download eztv torrents i don't have to add trackers no more. So i guess there were something about eztv's tracker(s) and Bitlord not want to work togheter. Anyways, uTorrent seems to work alot better and faster so i'll be using it as my standard Download client from this day forward.
Quick question: Adding trackers to every single torrent you download seems a bit harsh, is there no other way to make the trackers permanent so that it will automatically use the trackers instead of adding them every time you download a new torrent?"
