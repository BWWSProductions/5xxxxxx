Pop stars with opera singers, who would of thought! But it works well. 

This CD is fun and has some wonderful proformances. Sting and Pavarotti are very good together on Panis Angelicus. 

This CD sounds wonderful and is a must have for the fans of Pavarotti, Sting, Kaas, May, Zucchero, etc.



Enjoy and Seed!!
