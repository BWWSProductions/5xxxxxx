,villu,2009-10-31T15:19Z,where PC game???
,Bjorkved,2009-10-31T15:55Z,Wave 4?
,ace_012,2009-10-31T15:58Z,Is this the same upload that used GTA stealth files? 
,4n0n,2009-10-31T16:25Z,@Bjorkved Yes.
,Rubbebubbe,2009-10-31T19:41Z,"Är himla sugen på att bränna 3 nya 360-spel som kommit ut nämligen Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Dragon Age och Divinity 2. De lär också vara Wave 4 och nu undrar jag om nån vet nåt kring dem spelen? Är det ""bara"" att ladda hem, packa upp, patcha iso-filen med ppf-o-matic (v14-15) som om det vore ett Wave 3-spel och bränna eller?!
Jag har försökt läsa mig till hur det fungerar men blir f-n inte klok på vad som gäller. Jag har en äldre iExtreme-flashning (skulle tro att det är version 1.4)  i min XBOX 360 som har en Samsung dvd-läsare. Egentligen skulle man ju ha flashat till en nyare version men det har inte blivit av. I stället har jag använt ppf-o-matic för att kunna spela Wave 3 vilket fungerat utmärkt. Jag är aldrig heller ute på XBOX Live så det är inget jag behöver ta hänsyn till. Problemet är att Wave 3- spelen som jag patchat inte lär gå att spela om jag flashar till iExtreme version 1.6 så därför är jag nu jättenyfiken på om det fortfarande går att få Wave 4-spel att fungera utan att behöva nyare flash och i så fall hur?

Tack på förhand!"
,jay200,2009-10-31T20:05Z,is this wave 4 and will i get banned if i play it???

,kicka14,2009-11-02T01:08Z,does your xbox 360 need to be flashed to play it? or can you just burn it to a cd then play it?
,xtradowner,2009-11-03T04:06Z,i get an error in xbox backup creator about the video sector. i burned anyways and can confirm this does NOT work.... if any1 can get this working post against me but i have other wave 4 games ex gta stories and tekken 6 and they are working on ixtreme 1.61
,Hackeenrek,2009-11-03T09:41Z,"@xtradowner, you fail it does work but IW has done something weird and that's why it doesn't work for you. you have to insert the Activate.iso first so all the security from iXtreme will be disabled and then you must change the activate.iso disk with the modern warfare 2 disk.

look around on the internet/TPB to find the Activate.iso and how to burn it."
,briley,2009-11-03T11:01Z,"@kicka14 i swear you ask that on every game, never heard of google?"
,Neuro_Belmont,2009-11-03T12:13Z,"Kicka14 ~ ""does your xbox 360 need to be flashed to play it? or can you just burn it to a cd then play it?""

Holy crap. Seriously?

Of all the dumb things..."
,jamesmal,2009-11-03T15:07Z,Why is this downloading so slow ? Nearly 3 days and an average of 15KBs.Hey I know its free but why so slow ?
,lDunKs,2009-11-03T19:02Z,ok so this game doesn't work for me either. Error when burning ISO. not once but 3 times with this same game. Worked fine when i burned Dragon Rage.
,Hackeenrek,2009-11-03T21:19Z,"i don't understand why everyone is having issues with this download. it downloaded at 200kb/s and it took about 20hours to download. I burned it, putted the activate.iso disc in the xbox first. replaced it with MW2 and worked fine.
I've played to the entire single player without any problems.


BTW: The campaign is better then the CoD:4 one. but it's a little short, took me 4hours to play to the entire single player."
,goobini,2009-11-05T00:45Z,"downloaded it, burnt it, and it didnt work for me... WTF? "
,gamechief,2009-11-09T23:21Z,Attention to everyone downloading this to play it normally this release will get you banned DO NOT PLAY ONLINE OR ON THE XBOX YOU ARE PLAYING ONLINE WITH. YOU WILL GET BANNED. I GOT BANNED AND I HAVE BEEN FLASHING FOR 2 YEARS NOW WITH THE SAME XBOX
,darkorb,2009-11-12T01:00Z,"Playing this ISO in the state it is when you download it will result in you getting banned, it's a bad ISO with an incorrect SplitVid section. This will be pretty much instantly detected, which is why people like gamechief got banned.

You can fix this issue with abgx360 and the WAVE4 SplitVid ISO (which you can find in various places). Run it through abxg360 once, it'll repair. Run it again to validate it. Then you should be good to burn and play (taking the normal care that is).

Oh and make 100% sure that your running the most recent iXtreme firmware that is around for your drive. For me that was the 1.61 firmware (Benq)."
