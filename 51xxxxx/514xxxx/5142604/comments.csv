Just ignore the negative quality scores he or them is trying to deceive you. Don't Worry about it.

All my torrent uploads are pre-tested and work fine."

,goldeneagle999,2010-08-29T16:05Z,"Thank you very much for your works, buddy. I've been a big fan of your uploads, man! :)
You rock. I have a request please: could you please upload Rollcage I & II (NTSC) ? I've been looking for these two for ages now, but I don't seem to find them anywhere! This sucks! :/

P.S: All I found is the converted version of them for the PSP! "
