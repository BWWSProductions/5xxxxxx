,vatsa1708,2010-03-02T15:14Z,"Hi,
Can these be coverted into HQ...???"
[V],bob5695,2010-03-09T07:42Z,"HQ stands for ""high quality"".
what you got here is HQ-SD ""high quality standard definition"".
i suppose you meant HD.
in which case i'd suggest you find another torrent.
resizing a 720x304 frame up to 1280x536 or 1920x816 won't really make it ""high definition"".
in fact you'll most likely lose quality (and you'll also end up with unnecessarily huge files)."
,vatsa1708,2010-03-10T17:58Z,"yes I meant Hd..
Thanks for the advice though i'll stick with this... xD"
,koudbier,2010-03-11T00:18Z,"Could you next time maybe not remove the producer clips in the beginning? It's darn hard to find subtitles.

Anyway, good quality& sound!"
[V],bob5695,2010-03-11T08:45Z,do you have any idea how EASY it is to sync subs? two words for you: subtitle workshop. ;)
,vincentmalouin,2010-03-29T21:33Z,Could someone please seed..
[V],bob5695,2010-03-30T00:46Z,over 200 seeds at the moment.
[V],bob5695,2010-04-13T06:43Z,"dude, if the subs are showing 10 seconds too late or 7 seconds too early all you have to do is press ctrl+d and shift the timings -10 or +7 but if you're not bright enough to manage that then you should definitely go for another rip.
funny thing is none of you complainers even tried to ask: ""hey, bob, can you get subs for these movies in language xpto?""..."
,renss78,2010-05-20T18:43Z,"Good Quality, ABSOLUTELY NO SUBS AVAIlABLE"
[V],bob5695,2010-05-21T00:36Z,in what language?
,pyros6525,2010-06-27T19:55Z,"Hey bob, can you please upload portuguese subtitles for the movies, please? I could not find any subtitles for the movies. The portuguese language is from Brazil and not Portugal. Can you also upload subtitles for english language?

Thanks"
[V],bob5695,2010-06-27T23:26Z,não te garanto que consiga tratar disso ainda hoje porque já estou podre de sono mas se não for hoje é amanhã sem falta.

[V],bob5695,2010-10-10T14:05Z,maybe he was nervous.
,Sa3llarX,2010-12-12T23:13Z,@darkblademk: there is no macedonian language f00l macedonia is a Greek province so there is the Greek language.
,aaaahh,2010-12-30T23:05Z,"hahahaha macedonian is a language, spoken in Republic of Macedonia which is not a greek province. It belonged to alexander the great but i was a part of Yugoslavia therefore he can probably speak bosnian/serbian/croatian.... are you guys from europe or are you from USA? lol"
