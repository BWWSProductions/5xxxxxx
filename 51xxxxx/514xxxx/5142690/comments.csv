people to.

Just ignore the negative quality scores he or them is trying to deceive you. Don't Worry about it.

All my torrent uploads are pre-tested and work fine."

I see all the negative comments but not only does the torrents work, but i downloaded the mod 1.13 from eechcentral.com and downloaded openAL.dll and i can not only fly the hokum and comanche, but the ah1 huey, the apache(so no need for apche havoc game) and the mi28 havoc... Thanks much"
,breechking,2011-01-20T16:58Z,Oh and by the way people stop wasting your time with the no cd patches on any torrent. Mount the fuckers with an iso tool so you can update these suckers to the fullest and mod the shit out of them. i got crazy games from these guys that are fantastic

,DRFTR566,2011-07-22T08:48Z,"okay this was made around 200 i believe so anything above windows XP really it might no be compatible.  Its just because the system did not come with the same components the the older computers had so try to google the problem and see what you can do.  breechking said he downloaded OpenAl.dll and it worked, I suggest you do the Same"
