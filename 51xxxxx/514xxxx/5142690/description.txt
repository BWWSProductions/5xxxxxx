Known Bugs - There is a bug I encountered at the main menu screen with the mouse 
             it showed 2 mouse icons, and windows mouse shows thru game for some 
             reason. You may or may not have this problem in Vista this bug didn't 
             happen. Just remember to set your joystick for cyclic, Throttle for 
             Collective (Or keyboard if you don't have built-in throttle on your 
             Joystick.) And Pedals keyboard in the options menu under controls.

Game Description:

A "sequel" to Apache/Havoc, this game features the RAH-66 Comanche (NATO) vs. the Ka-52 Hokum (Warsaw Pact). Control both the pilot and gunner stations. Multiple reality options let you tune the game to your liking. Improved control options, graphics, gameplay and more. There are three semi-dynamic campaigns set in Lebanon, Yemen, and Taiwan.

Take control of two of the most devastating war machines ever created: American-made RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter and the Russian-made KA-52 Hokum. Always on the front lines of the most heated battles, this game will deploy you in hot spots and border disputes in Taiwan, Yemen, and Lebanon. This simulator features precise avionics, authentic weaponry, and options for both the grizzled sim veteran and the greenhorn alike. The game is designed to work with Enemy Engaged: Apache Havoc, allowing you to bring the Apache and Havoc gun ships into these missions and vice versa. Enemy Engaged: Comanche Vs. Hokum supports co-op and versus multiplayer sorties for up to 16 players via LAN, Internet, or serial connection.
