For me, with an mac, MKV is better than an AVI. Working great to stream to my tv-setup box.

Love!"

,kithylin,2011-01-02T17:55Z,"@mrmclovin: It struggles to play on your PC because your PC's old and slow and can't handle the bit rate. I've played this on my brand new samsung blu-ray player on a flash drive last night, runs flawlessly, watched it on 2 PC's and it works great, nothing wrong with quality.  Granted i have a 3.8ghz i7 and 4ghz Q8400, but still, it works great."
