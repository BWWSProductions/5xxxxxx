[V],thegoldman,2009-11-02T04:30Z,"k, that video will be uploaded within 12 hours... You can then download it....

I do have the VOB of that song, but i will convert it to AVI format. The AVI will be of almost the same quality as that of VOB. can't upload the VOB because i am planning to upload the entire collection of VOB of shania twain in near future as a single torrent... thanks"
[V],thegoldman,2009-11-02T04:33Z,"this is what i am planning to upload.. hopefully i will be able to convert it to a good quality avi file as per your requirements...

[V],thegoldman,2009-11-02T07:33Z,"i got a problem... that song has white bars in the top and the bottom.. check the screenshot posted above.. now tell me, are those white bars present in the song originally??? if not, then i should replace them..."
[V],thegoldman,2009-11-02T10:54Z,"k, if the white bars are present in the song originally, then i will encode using those white bars. those white bars can be removed later on using any software, there are a lot of softwares for that purpose.

by evening, you will be able to download that song. in 90 mins i will upload the video...

enjoy!"
