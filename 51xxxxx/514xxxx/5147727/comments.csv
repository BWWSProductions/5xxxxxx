,hexenmeister,2009-11-21T04:01Z,Can anyone tell me why the key generator keeps coming up 8 digits short of a full activation code?

,geditor,2009-11-29T15:23Z,Does this atleast give me a trial... I don't need it for a long period of time and i doubt i will make anything with it... I just need it to see how easy (or difficult) it is to use before i buy it.... Any suggestions?
,cdigital,2009-12-02T06:46Z,"DonÂ´t know why there just a few comments.  Downloaded in less than 30 hours, opened the iso wiv POWERISO and simply extracted the 64-bit installation folder.  Go through the crack steps, dont forget to turn of the UAC (dont know how its called) in vista or 7.  (i have Windows 7 64-bit)

Working like a charm. Kudos!"

,Narutoaddiction,2009-12-11T05:30Z,"I don't know what to put in for the request dialog box to have a code generated, what should I put?"
,watson516,2009-12-11T23:38Z,This works just fine. The activation just took about 10 tries but worked in the end.
,ll-Arc-ll,2009-12-12T18:29Z,"Ok I followed all the steps so far and am at the crack part. After I open Maya and leave it open, to go and press the mem patch button, it says ""could not get debug priviledge! Are you admin?""  Are you kidding me? I could be nothing but admin on this computer, I built it from scratch and installed windows myself and there is only one user and that's me who is obviously self appointed as admin from control panel. What is going on here, please help."
,ll-Arc-ll,2009-12-14T07:25Z,"Nevermind, fixed the problem. I had to disable the ""UAC"". For Windows 7 all you do is go to control panel and type in the search field ""UAC"" and you'll find it. Take the slider down to the bottom."
,visualrevolution,2009-12-15T02:52Z,Works like a charm.. easy to install and easy to crack.. Thx for the upload

,warped13,2009-12-30T09:49Z,"Alright Finally got it to work! seems like either this keygen didnt work on 64bit on windows 7 or something went wrong i downloaded a different key gen that said 64bit and that one worked just fine!
So if any one is having any Windows 7 64bit key gen problems i suggest downloading a 64bit key gen version"
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-02T09:07Z,@ 50C3NT: There's a party in my computer and you should brush your shoulders off pimp. Great upload! I purchased Maya 7 for college and it seems that this new update has a lot more going on with it. I haven't had the time to fully check it out but I'm now in search for a Maya 10 book to get me up to speed again. Simple download that only made me question the instructions a couple times but this downloaded in my first attempt. Everyone just follow the instructions and it WILL work. Keep your uploading hand strong and thanks for the great work!

,bostoncelticlarry6803,2010-01-04T01:07Z,listen carefully if your dual booting with ubuntu or mint and are using grub bootloader do not install this after you restart your system  will not boot even if you reinstall grub if you run this again your system will not boot everything will work fine until you restart pc but once you do either you will see strange character on screen or a flashing screen
,GenyrusSeedeR,2010-01-08T05:23Z,"Easy as pie! Thanks for writing it out perfectly. Made the install a 5 minute, no hassle job.

Anyone who says its not working, I suggest you read the ""README.txt"" file first"
,ycf,2010-01-21T11:17Z,"I need help from someone who is more exprieanced,

I am not very good with all of this, but I installed it and followed the instructions with the activation, and now when ever I try to start it up a pop-up window comes up saying ""A license related problem has occurred. 
[-12]""

I tried to uninstall it and everything but the  activation thing didn't come up like the first time and it still has the pop-up window when I try to start it up.

Please help,
I am not as good with this as you are..."

,valvelessalarm,2010-01-25T12:40Z,"i can't seem to find the crack for window vista 64 bit version, someone help me please, what folder would it be in?"
,IronGolem,2010-01-26T00:24Z,"@valvelessalarm: I have windows 7 64-bit. The crack is located at ""Autodesk.Maya.2010.Suite\crack\Crack_Maya2010_win\xf-maya2010-64bits"". There should be an ""xf-maya2010-64.exe""

The guide said a window would prompt me to activate when I opened Maya the first time. Nothing appeared for me. When I opened Help>Licensing, I got this window:
http://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss300/Ochibi7/Maya2010.png
I need to manually activate it, right?"
,IronGolem,2010-01-26T00:34Z,"Turns out, I already had Maya installed before, but it wasn't working, so I removed it. The registration was still there though, so when I tried to activate and ran the patch, the activation window said there was already a registered activation. Now my window still looks the same as the picture I uploaded, except there is a serial number entered. It still says Commercial and Stand-alone Locked. Will the program run into any problems?"
,doicarewhatusay,2010-01-27T22:02Z,Is it safe to install extra plugins without it noticing that it was cracked?

,Toxic_Avenger,2010-01-27T22:30Z,"Can't even install it... After about 10-20% it's ""not responding"" and 5-10 secs later it crashes."
,phltolax69,2010-01-30T20:16Z,"has anyone had success with the OS X crack?  

the README file gives crack instructions for windows which are for a classic KEYGEN/ACTIVATION model.

however, the OS X crack seems to be your basic PATCH, so the instructions as given in the READ ME file do not work.

just wanted to know if anyone can post any success that they have had using the OS X patch.  please include instructions with your post if possible.

thanks"
,Douche04,2010-01-31T19:02Z,Does anyone know if you can run this through parallels on a mac by installing the windows version? Or do i need that OS X patch?
,enerses,2010-02-24T21:14Z,"I am running Windows 7 64-bit, installed maya 64-bit version, turned off UAC then restarted the system. Then I ran maya for the first time. The activation window popped up with the options to ""Activate"" or ""Run the product"". I clicked activate which lead me to the ""Register Today"" window. Then I ran xf-maya2010-64bits crack, clicked on Mem Patch and it said it patched it successfully. So returning to the Maya ""Register Today"" window there is the request code to place in the crack but the crack only gives a large activation code and the Maya ""Register Today"" window only accepts an 11 digit serial number and a 5 digit product key. I think that the crack is supposed to get rid of this registration window so that I can enter the activation code but I'm stuck at the Registration window. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
,enerses,2010-02-24T21:20Z,"CORRECTION:

Didn't read through the entire install.txt. I did use the serial number and product code provided which got me to the activation screen where I was able to enter the activation code. But then I get the following:

Registration-Activation Error (0015.111) 
There is a problem with the activation code that you entered. 

Again any help is greatly appreciated.

,bunderfeld,2010-04-01T01:41Z,"First I appreciate the Torrent, I've always wanted to learn Maya, so here's my chance.

Second, could it be possible that you put up ISO of the other Disks in this set?  Particularly the Source Images CD, there are some things in that folder that I need to help with my learning :)

If it's possible, I appreciate it, if not, thank you for trying."

,musicvault,2010-10-04T19:05Z,"Thanks a lot for uploading it. works fine.

For those who could not patch (administrator issue) here's the key :

- Disable UAC [user account control], its in control panel.
- Then run maya and when u get the update window then run the keygen.

thanks to ""ll-Arc-ll"" too."
