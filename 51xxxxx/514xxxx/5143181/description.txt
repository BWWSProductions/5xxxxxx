These barstards have taken $140,000 from a student union and absorbed it. They will not disclose what actually happened to the money
Have introduced rules like 'No public gatherings' and 'No congragations of certain people' (AT A UNIVERSITY!)
Increased fees dramaticly, there has certainly not been any improvement in customer service
Have virtually no reguard for any OH&S regulations (to an extreme having an employee given an electric shock after he'd alerted them to the issues 2 months before hand) nothing was done to pervent a reoccurrence for another 6 months
Bullying and intimadating the customers (who are actually the students in this case!) and then even to bully and inimadated the friends of these people
Bullying and intimadating staff who tried to blow the whistle on the underhandedness of the management
I've even heard a staff member telling another to lie to the customers
Presenting false and backdated documents to customers in an effort to prevent them returning to the residence
squandered $5000 on a plasma TV that sits in the office and displays all the upcoming events while the customers share a 17 inch CRT Tv in each unit
Blocked a report written by the University of Ballarat's UBSA (student union) from being released 
After deining a huge number of returning students, put security guards at their houses the the next month around the clock, followed by the installation of security camera's all around their houses and across the resience
Accepted a bribe from an Internet provider to take control of the network resourses. The service is so bad it takes 20 seconds at times to load google.com !
Arn't governed under the Australian tenancy act and thus, can immediately remove a person from one of its rooms. They did so 3 days before the start of class giving the person 5 hrs to clear their room and leave.

Vikings, Stingrays, Knights & Celtics have had enough of the incompetence, arrogance and belligerence towards its own customers. These people are absolute scum
I will not show them any respect, kindness or use the brakes in my car when i see them crossing the street.
