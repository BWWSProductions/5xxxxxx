Elio Petri and Ugo Pirro's 1970 Oscar-Winning 'Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto' is a thriller about a police chief who kills his mistress and then manipulates the investigation to prove his superiority. A great performance by Gian Maria VolontÃƒÂ© and one of Ennio Morricone's best scores make this one of Italy's best '70s movie.
