,dat_ass,2009-12-14T02:18Z,"jedi, youre an idiot.. anyone with even the smallest knowledge of torrents knows exactly what the instructions mean.
extract basically means to move to another folder, like your desktop so you can then mount on a virtual dvd drive, using a program like poweriso, daemon tools or maybe even magic disk.. then the autorun.exe will kick in and you install it... then play. its simple.

this torrent works perfectly, just download the patch like FTL3 said, at 
http://www.fileshack.com/file.x/15683/Star+Wars+The+Force+Unleashed:+Ultimate+Sith+Edition+v1.1+Patch+US

and then get the crack

hopefully this will help some people out"

,bullseye732,2009-12-21T13:15Z,"I get the same problem as Minuxt and olej992.  :S
I tried crack fix, patch 1.1 nothing works.
Anyone has any other bright ideas for solving this? :S"
,Mercyflush64,2009-12-23T06:23Z,Aspyr is the company that produced the PC version of this Lucas Arts game so it is a bit different. What is not readily known is this 1.1 patch does not work on 64 bit systems and on their website is an alternate version to download. 
,Bainshee,2009-12-24T12:28Z,"The crack posted here is a virus.

IT DOSENT WORK AND IT CONATINS A BUNCH OF DIFFRENT SPYWARE DO NOT INSTALL."
,Bainshee,2009-12-24T12:32Z,"HERES WHAT YOU REALLY DO. This took me 5min to find out using google.... you guys suck really..

Download the fixed patch: http://www.rlslog.net/star-wars-the-force-unleashed-patch-v1-1-cracked-bat/

Download a crack of your choice thats 1.1. From gamecopyworld for example.. 

Play the game."
,bullseye732,2009-12-25T19:50Z,"I solved my problem, that would make the menu not appear or sometimes if I managed to see the menu, it would crash during the intro text.
I just pluged off my internet cable and it started working. O.o
I dunno why, but if I plug my internet cable while I'm playing it crashes.

Maybe it will work with someone else."
