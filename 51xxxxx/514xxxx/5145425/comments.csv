,RabeldyNugs,2009-11-03T10:11Z,"Thanks so much man.  You did me a huge favor!!  
Has anyone heard if the soundcheck was also released in SBD or FM Bunny?"
,kayvebear,2009-11-03T23:29Z,Your welcome ... sorry initial download is taking so long but I am the only seeder for all 4 torrents (each night individually plus this combo pack).  Once we get some more seeders up it will go a lot quicker.
,poppopballoon,2009-11-04T00:03Z,"you don't need to seed 4 separate torrents just this one, people who don't need all 3 nights can uncheck what they don't want."
,enigs,2009-11-04T01:30Z,thanks for this!  already spent $300 or more on the weekend so it's nice to not pay $40 more to hear the music again.
,kayvebear,2009-11-04T07:03Z,I am jealous you only spent $300.  I spent like 600-700
,ediblegod,2009-11-05T05:18Z,"Anyone have a copy of ""Party Time""?"
,ediblegod,2009-11-05T05:18Z,By the way... Thanks for this!!!

,shortfuse3776,2009-11-06T10:23Z,thanx so much keep on sharing in the groove
,shortfuse3776,2009-11-06T14:40Z,Does anyone have 9/17/00 Merriweather Maryland show? 
,mpcteck,2009-11-09T02:52Z,"Thank you. I thought I had heard the music was going to be free for download for anyone attending, and was bummed when I heard you needed to pay. But as usual, the piratebay comes though for us. "
,gringodude,2009-11-14T15:50Z,"There are maybe 10 different audience tapes available of these shows at bt.etree.org.  For what it's worth Phish donates the net proceeds of the livephish downloads to the Mockingbird Foundation, which donates the money to children music programs.  I can't imagine a better way to spend $40.  I don't need these MP3s.  I have FLACs which I purchased and do not upload."
,DJjibbajabba,2010-06-10T17:19Z,"Great show good torrent BUT what I'm looking for is Mike Gordon's first solo record ""Inside In"" I've spent months looking for it online because my cd got scratched and I don't like re-buying cd's. If you have it please share! One of my favourite albums of all time!"
