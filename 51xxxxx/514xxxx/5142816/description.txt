Set in Arizona, HURT follows the Coltrane family as they

grapple with the untimely death of the father, Robert

Forced to abandon their privileged lifestyle, Helen

Coltrane (Walters) and her teenage children Conrad

(Rathbone) and Lenore (Braddy) are given shelter by her

husband's reclusive brother Darryl (Mapother) in his

ramshackle home in the desert. As the family reluctantly

settles in, a fresh challenge is presented by the arrival

of Sarah (Vassilieva), a lovely yet troubled foster child

whom Robert had pledged to take in. The family's grief

turns to dread as a series of tragic, inexplicable

incidents befall them. A Gothic Thriller
