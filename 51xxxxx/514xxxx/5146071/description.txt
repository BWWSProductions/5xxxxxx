Love it or hate it, here it is...  Detroit 9000

1973 "Blaxploitation" movie plays on racial tensions, heavy black vs white conflict; it is not a comedy but depending on your sense of humour you may laugh heartily throughout this campy flick. Movie snobs hate it but there are worse ways to spend 106 minutes of your time.

Much gratuitous gunplay, great shootout that lasts forever. Lots of great scenes of downtown Detroit, waterfront, and incl. the tunnel and Windsor. Even a shootout scene slash boat chase with the old harbormaster boat on the Detroit river.  All accompanied by hilarious music, sometimes repetitive, but always funky.

Great stuff.  Money-back guarantee if you are not absolutely delighted!
