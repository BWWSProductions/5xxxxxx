,e6rd,2009-10-31T14:11Z,"It is RegionFree(RF),both NTSC and PAL.
And no,it's not safe since it uses stealth files from GTA 4(or so I've heard).To play it on live you need a proper release"
,villu,2009-10-31T14:53Z,where is PC game????

,ReaL_BadMaN,2009-10-31T16:00Z,im warning everyone this is very unsafe to play it at all only play it if yoou dont use xbox live. My freind did just play this and he got banned 15 minutes after.
,avgplz,2009-10-31T16:11Z,real badman your an IDIOT this game comes out nov 10th dont play on live intell then and what i would do is play no hd no anything not connected to live playing on live = ban from 3min to 15min for sure. just playing this game... game should be good i got another last night b4 this 1 was out its 7.05 also so it looks good 
,roberttune,2009-10-31T16:44Z,ill create an offline profile on my memory stick and use it on that so that shunt get me banned coz that profile wont be connected to live so that should be safe shunt it?
,phylumk,2009-10-31T16:54Z,"Gee, just disconnect your xbox from the internet by removing the wire or the wireless device. That's all that needs to be done to avoid being banned."
,saada245,2009-10-31T17:10Z,If im already banned then i can play this right? I got fucked from forza 3.
,Hackeenrek,2009-10-31T17:17Z,"i think the best to make sure you're not getting banned is using the following methodes to play the game:

1. disconnect everything, HD, Wireless adapter/Ethernet.
2. Use a memory card and create a offline profile and use that to play mw2. and if you want to play on live remove te memory card
3. Make a online profile on your HD (only connect your HD and NOT your ethernet) and use a offline profile to play the game and if you want to play on live delete that profile."
,Hackeenrek,2009-10-31T17:19Z,"whoops i made a mistake...

i should have wrote this:

3.make a offline profile on your HD (Only connect HD and NOT ethernet) and use that profile to play the game, but make sure that when you're going back on live you've deleted that profile."

,tonymarco134,2009-10-31T19:10Z,"so even if you wait till this game is released and you have 1.6 firmware, You shouldn't play this online or what should we wait till a different copy if we want to play online. Even with firmware 1.6"
,s34mu5,2009-10-31T19:11Z,if you play this on you account it will come up in your recently played games and if you connect to live afterwards they will have the date you played it
,Rubbebubbe,2009-10-31T19:42Z,"Är himla sugen på att bränna 3 nya 360-spel som kommit ut nämligen Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Dragon Age och Divinity 2. De lär också vara Wave 4 och nu undrar jag om nån vet nåt kring dem spelen? Är det ""bara"" att ladda hem, packa upp, patcha iso-filen med ppf-o-matic (v14-15) som om det vore ett Wave 3-spel och bränna eller?!
Jag har försökt läsa mig till hur det fungerar men blir f-n inte klok på vad som gäller. Jag har en äldre iExtreme-flashning (skulle tro att det är version 1.4)  i min XBOX 360 som har en Samsung dvd-läsare. Egentligen skulle man ju ha flashat till en nyare version men det har inte blivit av. I stället har jag använt ppf-o-matic för att kunna spela Wave 3 vilket fungerat utmärkt. Jag är aldrig heller ute på XBOX Live så det är inget jag behöver ta hänsyn till. Problemet är att Wave 3- spelen som jag patchat inte lär gå att spela om jag flashar till iExtreme version 1.6 så därför är jag nu jättenyfiken på om det fortfarande går att få Wave 4-spel att fungera utan att behöva nyare flash och i så fall hur?

Tack på förhand!"

IF what you're telling is actually true, can you explain to me why you could play games that weren't out yet on Live in 2008. I've played games that weren't released yet on Live and didn't get banned. If i would do the same thing now i would get banned... so if that chip does that why could i play unreleased games in 2008 on live?"

,Hackeenrek,2009-10-31T20:40Z,"Satchm0

I don't think it's out for pc yet, it will probably take some time before the pc version comes out because this version was uploaded so microsoft could ban people that were stupid enough to play this release online."

You are entirely correct. are all these people retarded or just like getting banned. FOR THE LAST TIME:

IF YOU PUT THIS GAME IN YOUR CONSOLE BEFORE NOVEMBER 17TH WHEN IT IS GETTING RELEASED, YOU WILL LIKELY BE PENETRATED BY M$'S BAN HAMMER. YES, DEEP AND HARD YOU WILL GET IT. AND YOUR CONSOLE WILL BE FUCKED NOT YOUR GAMERTAG.

COMMON SENSE PEOPLE IF YOUR STEALING A GAME ALREADY (WHICH YOU ARE) DONT PLAY IT ONLINE. BESIDE THE DEV TEAM, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT WOULD BE ONLINE MAKING IT TOO EASY FOR MS TO BANN YOUR LESS THAN BRILLIANT ASS. THIS IS HOW M$ IS ATTEMPTING TO STOP GAME PIRATING, WHICH THEY WON'T BUT YOU LESS INTELLIGENT ONES WILL BE BANNED FROM LIVE WHICH YOU DESERVE.

,Hackeenrek,2009-10-31T23:44Z,"Sanchez...
I agree with you, i've searched the internet and have heared of other people that this is released so microsoft can ban people who have a modded xbox. that's also the reason why there is no pc release yet.

I'll just wait until the final release is on TPB and download that one. in the mean time i hope some people who have a banned xbox will make vids of the game."
,appatight,2009-11-01T00:25Z,Question... I heard this is safe maybe someone can clarify for me.  I heard if you play a burned game on your modded console before the release date with your console unplugged from xbl then when the release date comes around and you have an actual verified copy or a retail copy and you play that on live you will not get banned.  Is this true that anyone know of?
,john_smarty,2009-11-01T00:58Z,"why would they release this on purpose LOL

you have a point with them trying to catch everyone ...
but ALOT of games get leaked weeks before their release "
,Hackeenrek,2009-11-01T01:33Z,"appatight

that's true but this is not the official release, this release uses the stealth files from GTA IV so if you unplug your xbox from xbl and you play this and connect back to xbl microsoft can see you've played modern warfare 2 with the stealth file from GTA IV (because GTA IV is wave 2 and modern warfare 2 is wave 4). but normally it's safe to play a game before the release without ethernet.

john_smarthy

you're right about that like i said in the comments before i've played games weeks before the release but the point with this game is that the stealth files don't match the game. so if you play this release and play the official release when the game comes out, microsoft can see you've played 2 versions of the game, one with the wave 2 stealth and the other one with te (correct) wave 4 stealth."
,iklsjicbryanharley,2009-11-01T02:07Z,DO NOT PLAY THIS AT ALL it is the wrong fucking steakth and wave you will definitely get banned for this dont be stupid. its obviously ms trying to get alot of idiots BANNED all at the same time. and by using a massive game like this they think they will get alot of people DONT LET THEM WIN!!!

Burn it, remove HD and Internet connections and change counsel time to 10 days in the future heard that there was a Big Ban Hammer going down on alot of people from Live makeing there Xbox360s turned into bricks, so what would be the Sneaky way to go about playing an hour of a game without able to save the history of playing it? Also i have heard of the Nand Chip saveing bits of info to it and then later sending it to xbox live thus showing them that you did play a game pre-released. And any other info would be nice! -  and is there a way to RESTORE and Xbox To Factory Mode ( Brand New) after playing an early game then connecting to live with out showing the history of haveing played it"

,briley,2009-11-07T05:34Z,"Taken from 369 mods.
Think this guys on to something
My personal theory is that it's not related to the recent Wave 4 or any particular games. I don't think Microsoft can detect the firmware directly. I think that Microsoft has been collecting data on your games for quite some time. I think rather than ban people immeadiately when they detect a bad game or the hack they wait and keep a list. Once they have enough of a list built up I think they go though and randomly ban a large portion of them."

,Wonkizzle,2009-11-08T20:10Z,"Some people think the date in which a game is first played gets stored on the HDD and sent to MS once you get online. Other more paranoid ( like me ) people, think the information is stored on a NAND chip inside the 360, and it doesn't mater what you do, they will know about it as soon as you connect to live. Obviously, its best to stay the fuck off the game until retail is released. You can wait a few days. To all those who played early because you had no patience; Its been nice knowing you. "
,Carpeljet,2009-11-09T04:23Z,"From my personal experience there is no way for microsoft to tell if you've played a game early as long as you don't go on xbox live.

just create an offline  account on your xbox (so you can save your proggress) and delete it before you go back on xbox live.

And all one needs to do to play this is:
1. burn this to a DVD-DL disc after stealthing with ABGX
2. burn activate.iso to another DVD-DL,
3. update to iXtreme 1.6

4. Burn it with ImgBurn and enjoy.

And you don't have to use activate.iso. But as I said, this is meant to consoles which are banned from xbox live."

THEREFORE YOU WILL BE BANNED FOR HAVING A MODDED CONSOLE REGARDLESS OF PLAYING THIS GAME OR NOT.

all in all it was bound to happen now i dont have to worry about shit.  and I can play homebrew games so who cares.   Ive saved so much money downloading these games i can afford to buy a new xbox and 4 years of live thats how much ive saved"
,halo37253,2009-11-14T20:02Z,"if you want to play this, this is what you have to do. first update to 1.61 it can play wave 4 games like this. This way you can play all the newest wave 4 games. Now this copy of MW2 fails vitrifaction checks, so unless you patch this iso, you will have to burn the activate.iso disc. Burn it with CloneCD imgburn didnt work, but i didnt remove the layerbrake and that may be why. once burned pop it into xbox and wait once its done spinning eject it and pop this this MF2 disc. It will start up fine."

I have iextrem 1.6 lite-on and ive done all the things to get this game to work but it just say ""cant read media"".

I checked the game with abgx, burned it with imgburn (write image file to disc), poped the activation disc in the xbox, got the white screen where it says to put in the game and when i do it just say ""cant read media"" like i have a bad version or some shit.

Any kind souls that can help me?"

I also have Lite-On dvd-drive with iXtreme 1.6 firmware. First I tried with activate.iso to get game work but it didn't. Then I found program named ""360 Wave Patcher"". I converted the game with it to 3rd wave and burned with ImgBurn. Then it worked. But don't do that if you have console which isn't live-banned because that is the sure way to the them."

One is modded, one is not.  The modded one is not connected to the internet at all.  I only play games offline on this one.  I play all my xbox live games on my regular console that isnt modded and any games i play online are games that I actually buy from the store. Question is, if I swap the hard drive between the two, is there a chance I will get banned.  I repeat I do not play the modded console on xbox live AT ALL.

,omegaphi,2010-01-04T17:21Z,However the video partion is way to big. And not having it compressed before release resulted in file degredation. Burn errors have been reported accross the board. Because a small sample has burned successfully dosnt mean anyone converting to wave 2 for example are not screwed from the get go. Having been downloading games for pc for so long it amazes me how many seeds there are for such a Horible compilation. Users downloading is definetly not a very good indication of file integrity. And no I will not patch the video file to work. I'm downloading what I hope to be a better version here  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5145662/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_USA_RF-XBOX360-RRoD. The nuke in this case is the quality of download.
