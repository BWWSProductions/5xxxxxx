,munky261,2009-10-31T17:08Z,"Deavsiri..I have the smae problem with eztv torrents. It seems to me this happens when only:
http://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
udp://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

are in the tracker option (not sure what you use, I use Bitlord) ad these to torrents you have a problem with:

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce"

Thanks for the temporary fix for that, I was having the same problem, seems to recognize all seed and peers but unable to connect them, with those the download now proceeds, thanks!"
