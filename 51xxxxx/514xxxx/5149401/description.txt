  Robert Wyatt's short-lived post-Soft Machine project produced two extraordinary albums in the mid-'70s -- a self-titled debut and Little Red Record -- before Wyatt went solo and guitarist Phil Miller split for Hatfield the North. BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert sees the progressive rock legends performing top-form versions of album tracks given the extra punch that BBC sessions seem to almost always promote. Though hard to track down, BBC Radio 1 Live is essential for Soft Machine, Robert Wyatt, and Hatfield the North fans. An essential session from a key group in the Canterbury progressive rock scene.

Please feel free to join the TQMP project!
The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
