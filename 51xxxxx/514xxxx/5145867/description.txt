Duel - it's all about challenges and some big questions. Which car makes the most smoke while going sideways - a Lamborghini Murcielago SuperVeloce or a Vauxhall VXR8 Bathurst S? What is best at drifting? - the Jaguar XKR, the Lotus Evora, Audi's R8 V10 or BMW's M3? To find out, I globe-trot from sun-drenched Spain to Silverstone via Oxfordshire and Swindon.
There is serious science too. Can The Stig drift a car while wearing wellies? Can I corner in flippers? Can Formula One ace Anthony Davidson slide a car - in ice skates? Who is the best at off road driving? - Newswoman Kate Silverton, rugby's Matt Dawson, singer Ronan Keating - or me? Which is fastest - a car or a man? Find out as the Aston Martin v12 Vantage sprints against flying rugby winger Tom Varndell in a 100 metre drag race.
