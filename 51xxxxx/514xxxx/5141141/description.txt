The Spell is the second studio album by Danish pop group Alphabeat, released in Denmark on October 26, 2009. The Spell was originally set to be released a week later in the UK,but now pushed back to a febuary 2010 release.Alphabeat say their second album has moved away from the pop roots of their debut album, in favour of popular dance acts of the 1990s such as Snap! and Black Box. First single "The Spell" uses a sample from Cut 'N' Move's classic, â€Get Seriousâ€, with band member Anders SG saying the song was especially inspired by Black Box song "I Don't Know Anybody Else".The second single, "DJ", will precede the UK-release of the album.
