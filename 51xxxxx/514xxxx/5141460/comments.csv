,BG174,2009-11-05T13:55Z,"Thanks again for all your great wallpaper torrents, nico!  I always keep my eye out for them, and every one I've downloaded is superb.  

The reason I'm adding this comment to this particular torrent is to encourage you to add a list.txt file like the one here to as many torrents as you can.  Having the extra context/information is great!  With so many of your photos, I find myself thinking, ""I wish I knew where that was!""  I haven't checked the metadata yet to see if that info is in there, but having an explicit file with explanations is really helpful.  

I know you didn't actually take these photos (I'm assuming!), so you're limited in what you can provide, but I thought some encouragement would be helpful.  

Keep up the great work!
