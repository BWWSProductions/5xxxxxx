For some reason I can't seem to get any great speeds with the newer versions of utorrent, perhaps some port or something isn't set properly but as soon as I get this version my speeds go up. I got 2.5mb/s now and a few min ago dl with the newest ver i got like 500kb/s.

With this version i could max above 7mb/s and it will give the same effect to my internet surfing as if i would dl in 500kb/s with the newer versions so this was highly appreciated. greeting from sweden."
