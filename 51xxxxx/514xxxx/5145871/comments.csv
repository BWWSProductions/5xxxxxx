,mikebuckets,2009-11-10T00:07Z,"Thanks for the upload. I love the Sunfly discs. I am also looking for some karaoke and have been unable to find it anywhere. I am really only looking for one song ""Might Tell You Tonight"" by the Scissor Sisters. The only disc I have seen that it is on is Zoom Platinum Artists 120. If anyone has this or any other version that would be great. It is for my wedding and it would be fantastic. Thanks to everyone."
