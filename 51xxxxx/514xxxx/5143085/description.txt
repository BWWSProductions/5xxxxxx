Everything I've got, which is nearly everything they've done.  Here's the albums, individual tracks are too numerous to list here mostly because I'm lazy:

Confessions of a Knife (only a few tracks from this one, sadly)
Kooler than Jesus
Sexplosion!
13 Above the Night
Hit & Run Holiday
A Crime for all Seasons (only a few tracks from this one, sadly)

and the KMFDM remix of Days of Swine and Roses

This is my first torrent creation, so please let me know what sort of details I need to improve.
