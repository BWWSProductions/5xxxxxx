One mp3 ripped from flash video

Someone made a song, mixing different parts of the audio track from Carl SaganÂ´s "The cosmos". I really liked it but couldnÂ´t find a downloadable version of the audio track so I ripped it. I hope you like it as much as I do. Follow the link above to see the music video.

Spanx a lot bruthas and sistas!
