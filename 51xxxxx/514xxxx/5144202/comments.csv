1. Download Daemon Tools from http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads (Lite version will do)
2. Install
3. Right click on the ""Daemon Tools"" icon in the notification area
4. Go to ""Virtual Devices"",then select any1 of the virtual devices & select ""Mount Image""
5. Locate the ISO & click ""Open"". Thats it!!
ENJOY!!!
