,sven_svengali,2009-11-01T07:21Z,"Yes it says so in the ul´s comment.
But is there some sort of a communications problem since we´re all still waiting ???"
,futurahd17a,2009-11-01T14:06Z,"Yes, I understood!

The name of the torrent browser is a download link!

Thanks anonymous ;-)"

Thanks anonymous!"
,sven_svengali,2009-11-03T14:39Z,"Well, so far so good.
But still just getting a measly 31 Mb .iso-file
proclaming it contains 4.0 Gb ??? !!"
,futurahd17a,2009-11-03T15:18Z,"It's a pdf file,it doesn't bite. Download it, open it and click on the direct download link ""lechocdesmondes.iso"" (4 Go):

http://dl.free.fr/getfile.pl?file=/ZbbhMXiI"
,sven_svengali,2009-11-03T20:02Z,"Well aint that swell,huh!
The pdf links one to http://dl.free.fr/uZbbhMXiI/Lechocdesmondes.iso
and Hey presto ! 
You end up with above said .iso of 30 mb.

Don´t you think I´ve tried ?"
,futurahd17a,2009-11-03T22:08Z,"Sorry sven_svengali.I don't understand. When I click your link it is written 4.0Go file and that 's what it is when I click ""Telecharger ce fichier"" a 4Go iso file which doesn't stop at 30Mo."
,sven_svengali,2009-11-04T13:27Z,"My school french is a bit rusty, so..
Is it possible that by http the limit is 1 gb ?
Does ""envoi"" mean upload or download ?"
