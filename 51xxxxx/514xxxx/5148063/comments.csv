Platon, Newton, Carnegie, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Einstein. NOOOT :D

If you are a decent thinking skeptic, this will be good for a lololol.   If you are a moron it will be inspiring.


Ps. Most of what is said in this film (if not all of it) is a bare faced lie. All of the historical figures named (Einstein, Newton, Beethoven, Shakespeare) would turn in their graves if they could see their names on this pseudo science. Newton is perhaps, the smartest person who ever lived. This would be as transparent to him, as organized religion is to the educated west (excluding America).

The law of attraction has NOTHING to do with what this film claims it's all about.

Not 1...  not 1 single. Not even one single respected scientist would EVER claim that this nonsense is anything but lie after lie after lie.

Ps. Too bad no one told the Jews about ""The Secret"". We could have avoided an epic genocide. Ohh wait..  Einstein was Jewish. Guess that guy could keep a secret :)
On 2nd taught, thank god no one told Hitler about ""The Secret""  :(


Anyway, thanks' for the upload. I am giving it to my boss's wife. She will swallow it raw :)"
