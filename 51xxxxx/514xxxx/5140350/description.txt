PLOT



Avery Allan Ludlow (Brian Cox) is haunted by the past. His

only companion, a 14 year-old dog aptly named Red by his late

wife, is the centre of his world and his sole source of

purpose and happiness. However, in the blink of an eye

everything can change. Everything seems to be-going fairly

well - until three boys and their shotgun come along. In an

instant, his lifelong friend is gone, the victim of a

malicious, meaningless act



As Avery's sadness turns to a single-minded quest for justice

and redemption, he considers his options within, and perhaps

outside, the law
