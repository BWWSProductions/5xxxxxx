the movie was ok looking, it appeared to me like either a really good cam or a shitty dvdrip. It also has dutch subs in the video. I would wait for an actual DVDrip to come out if you can wait"
,guarino2002,2009-11-04T06:57Z,"definatly, the quality is cam like. id wait for a good quality one"

,Klipnotica,2009-11-06T11:03Z,"yeah i would give this video a:8 v:6-7, its watchable, screen too perfect to be a cam, but very streamy. i would say poor quality r5 or dvdrip. definitely watchable though, better then the cams that are out ther"
,argulle,2009-11-07T03:48Z,"Sorry guys..

Quality is extremly bad, altho theres a xvid up from you know so i recommend it.
Audio jumps also. But its better then some cams atleast.

Like it says in the info, blurred timecode on top & bottom.
Hardcoded Dutch Subs are annoying.
Resolution is only 448 pixels wide which makes for a blocky picture in fullscreen.
This movie has many fast scene switching action sequences which didn't encode very well.
Barely watchable for a workprint.

Plea to Release Groups - Release more stuff encoded in H264 Standard Def.
30 min TV show less than 100 Mb, 1 Hr TV show less than 200Mb, Movies 250-500 Mb.
All near DVD quality, maybe better than Divx/Xvid.
Why not release 2 versions of everything, one standard, one small?
For the many with limited bandwidth or slower connections (basic DSL, lowest tier cable, 3G, etc).
Check out Blueman's stuff on mininova. Thanks!"
,SemiBurge,2009-11-12T12:52Z,"OMG you guys are SO fastidious I simply just wanna puke! I am aware of quality myself, I never watch cam-videos for example. But seriously. People who are complaining about quality on this video, I call fastidious. If the video is not cam, and it is watchable and hearable, I am happy! I never complain about non-cam videos, and you guys shouldn't either. What do you expect from a video at 700 megs anyway? If you guys feel offended by this comment, then I am sorry, that was not the intention. I just wanted to say how fastidious and perfectionistic most people are. 
*pulling my hair an banging my head on the wall of irritation*

LORD JEMINI people are so choosy and spoiled at these times..."
