,Sirul,2010-05-08T23:22Z,"So what?
That's the same for most of American movies, even transformers and iron man have some American patriotic shit in it. 

But you still enjoyed it, haven't you? 
Just keep in mind that those are movies TOO."
,fourloko,2010-06-13T11:47Z,"Sirul is obviously some kinda gook or sand nigger who is jealous of / hates America and it's people. Sorry that you live in the third world, rat. I guess some of us are just born lucky. ;)"
,ubcphasyb,2010-06-21T13:19Z,"@JBNyen: you have no knowledge of history whatsoever, go read a fucking history book.

@fourloko: go fuck yourself your racist pig. This is why Canada is a superior country to the US of fucking A: you guys are just a bunch of racist rednecks and slave-owners, so go home and continue banging your mother for incest points."
,ubcphasyb,2010-06-21T13:20Z,"Oh btw, if you are wondering, I AM a Canadian, so fuck off."
,cruix,2010-08-29T22:46Z,"@ubcphasyb, unless you're actively trolling, you're just making Canadians sound like a bunch of whiny losers. This film IS commie propaganda. 

If you ARE trolling, using your UBC department of physics and astronomy account to do it probably ain't the smartest idea, yb. "
,holykarmor1,2010-09-18T13:20Z,"This is movie is made to celebrate the 60th anniversary since the founding of the republic of china. Although there are historical events in this movie, it is still a movie. This movie was also government regulated so you can expect that it is a propaganda"
,Alt_Hell,2011-05-01T05:12Z,If a movie is good then i don't care if its a propaganda movie
,Alt_Hell,2011-05-01T05:13Z,Anyways thanks to @raymondhome for uploading Chinese movies. Keep up the good work.. :)
,RoscoPicotron,2011-05-19T11:00Z,"@fourloko I don't think you could have said it better ""I guess some of us are just born lucky"", but just because your born in a developed country doesnt mean you deserve anything you have. And for your information China a communist country was developed thoasands of years before america was even discovered. By the way America is in an extreme amount of debt to china hundreds of billions last time i checked...SO SHUT UP YOU UNEDUACTED HICK!"
,fusa88,2011-07-19T03:32Z,"to JBNyen why if chinese movies its propaganda
