Following the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Communist Party started to rule in the mainland and Kuomingtang was forced to retreat to the island of Taiwan. The new power, along with other parties, then came together to organize the very first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and discussed to establish the People's Republic of China (PRC).
