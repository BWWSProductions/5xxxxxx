,XoLWoX,2009-11-04T13:55Z,"you can say whatever you want about my files the FACT is i know what i rip and what i dont rip.

IF i had this R5 file i would have named it an R5 like my other R5 that i have but i ripped this straight from the dvd that was givin to my from my source....

Mod - please dont rename my files there not your torrents if you dont like it delete the torrent and i wont upload it again"
[S],velvet.,2009-11-04T17:06Z,"It appears that I am unable to fix things here. The uploader XoLWoX is too pig headed to listen to anyone.  :(

I suggested you download your movie copies from a Trusted or VIP user instead. They have pink or green skulls next to their name."
,XoLWoX,2009-11-04T20:06Z,you never attemped to fix thing ..... you went about and did your own things without consulting the owner of the torrent
,Paulosav,2009-11-04T22:05Z,"ok, pls stop, i'v watched this, V9 A9,

Well done up loader, if you want 10/10 go to the bloody cinema and PAY you whingers.

God , its free , shut up.

Great Quality."
,XoLWoX,2009-11-04T22:37Z,i lost my skull over this movie guys so i hope you enjoy the crap out of it
,IS-118,2009-11-04T23:21Z,"^^ XoLWox,

You could have save it, but your behavior & honesty is too low for it.

,Aces77,2009-11-12T18:57Z,I think this was a R5 made into DVD ...
,mactopia,2009-11-15T22:38Z,r5 is a region 5 dvd therefore this is a dvd rip stop hassling the dude you either want it or you dont  get a grip of yourselves you fucking techno nerds
,SpudsBM,2009-11-17T02:38Z,god dammit koon stop spamming your site everywhere!
,rick-br,2009-11-18T01:01Z,"Good movie XolWox, and great picture quality, for me its a DVD Rip. 

Thanks! Keep up the good work man!"
,QoMSoL,2009-11-26T16:04Z,"Funny how people are arguing all the time saying ""it's R5! Not a DVDrip!"". All this shit is while R5 is a >>DVD (!!!) of region 5"
,PoshNinja,2009-11-28T16:34Z,"For the 522nd time; A R5 Rip is in fact a DVD Rip, how ever it's an *unofficial* DVD Rip, meaning that it isn't a rip from an *official* release but rather an *unofficial* resource.

Most R5 Rips have an alternative source for the audio as well, where as official releases do not.

So; Yes, R5 and DVD are the same thing, the only difference is that one is unofficial and the other is official and sometimes R5 will have less quality than an official rip, but there are R5 rips that can pass for official rips.

By the way; Good upload but a bad attitude.
A *Mod* can do as they wish with anyone's files seeing as how they out-rank every user on here, minus the creator(s) of the website."
,Danistheman,2009-12-09T08:50Z,"People need to chill out... Download it or go cry about a title to someone that gives a shit. 

Cheers for the torrent uploader"
,SnowbmX,2009-12-19T02:04Z,"Thx for the movie! 
rly good quality by the way, way better than many others dvdrips may i say..."
,diablogate,2009-12-20T21:55Z,I don't why people insist on screwing with new uploaders.  He had a skull for good reason.  This is a perfect rip.  And you can get this movie on DVD for early release from the right source.
,killser99,2012-01-02T15:32Z,there not exactly nice comments but yeah ino he screwed up but it doesnt mean we can say get a life and yeah im talkin about u blayzone but we all make mistakes and nobodys perfect
