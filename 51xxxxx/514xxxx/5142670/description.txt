A City Dressed in Dynamite is the debut album by That Handsome Devil. It was released in 2008. It was recorded at Cybersound Studios in Boston, Massachusetts. It is darker in tone and content than the band's EP, with some songs dealing explicitly with drug addiction and death. The album includes numerous samples of what seems to be dated educational videos from the '50s. The cover art and the illustrations in the album booklet were done by Neil "Women 158" Parkinson.
