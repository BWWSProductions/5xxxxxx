Make crtain youve downloaded our huge Karaoke DJ collection too in DivX or CD+g 6.88GB

This is a complete (enhanced) jukebox collection of mp3 music that will completely fill a single layer dvd disc with mp3 music for a jukebox player setup using a dvd player that is mp3 capable. You could fill a 4 gig music "ipod" certainly. Great for a cafe using "shuffle mode" on your mp3/disc player.

There is nothing here but tasteful music to restore some sanity to a world gone amok with rap and punk music pollution in our midst. What we have here instead is only the most tasteful, essential "no one should do without" kind of stuff.

We do think that many great artists deserve to be very rich and we plan to make it so. That said, we want access to music for all in return. So we make this gesture planning to get Bill Gates to eventually pay, since hes been stealin from us all long enough himself. Id rather Leann Rimes have the dough - it would make my day! We have everything here from Crooners to Standards and Euro languages too (a handful of German, French Spanish and familiar Italian greats are included in this massive collection).

We are finding at this moment that the peers that are best able to connect to us satisfactorily are those running utorrent 1.8.4 (as are we right now)


enjoy!
