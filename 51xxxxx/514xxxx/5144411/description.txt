Adam James Davis
----------------

English transhumanism-orientated artist from Nottinghamshire.

"Postposthumanity: Infinite members of infinite genders, in an infinite orgy...and eternal, megascale ejaculations. Orgasms through supernovae! A car crash is erotic...colliding celestial bodies are erotic."

Adam James Davis is the greatest. Adam James Davis is the worst. Adam James Davis is both the greatest and the worst and the everywhere between. All at once. None at once. Both all and none. Neither all nor none. Cycling through the spectrum. At oscillations of infinity Hz. At infinitesimal Hz. At both infinity and infinitesimal Hz.
