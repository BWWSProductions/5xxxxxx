,Cadinot,2009-11-05T12:23Z,"After the success of ""KL Menjerit"" by Badaruddin Azmi, we can watch yet another movie about illegal motor racing. ""Bohsia: Jangan Pilih Jalan Hitam"" is the second movie directed by Syamsul Yusof after ""Evolusi KL Drift"". The title of the movie may make the wrong headlines but Syamsul is trying to let people out there know what are the reasons behind that particular social problem and also to give out some advice on the matter.

This movie revolves around two teenagers, Amy (Salina Saibi) and Tasha (Nabila Huda) who get involved with illegal motor racing and fall victim to human greed because of the lack of religious education and love at home.

This movie starts with Tasha and Amy's scene, where they hang around Dataran Merdeka surrounded by many mat rempit. At the same time, a group of mat rempit drive dangerously on the road. Almost all the action scenes in this movie are effective. However there is such a thing as overdoing it. Good thing the background score is good (like in the beginning) and also very fitting with the scenes that we watch.

One thing for sure, Salina and Nabila's acting are really good in this movie. Kudos to them for successfully portraying bohsia with a degree of authenticity. We should praise them for their courage for agreeing to the roles. Shaheizy Sam feature film debut as Acai is also decent. However, there is something amiss with Syamsul's acting. Maybe it is because his appearance is pretty neat in this movie, as if Syamsul is an elite mat rempit.

We know Syamsul is trying to send a 'good' message to the audience - but how many more movies about the mat rempit should we be making? The stunts shown in this movie are so impressive that they may in fact result in even more people being interested in this social phenomenon."
