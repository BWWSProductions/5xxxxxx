,rhmum,2009-11-13T03:38Z,"the missing images were entrys that had been removed from the website. the ""1-10000"" only counts the database entrys. the files were stored to c:\rule34\ on my pc while i was ripping, so if you unzip them to any directory with less characters than that youll be able to avoid errors. note first line of the description. after unzipping you can rename the ones with extra long paths to whatever you like and m ove them elsewhere!
