,chuck24,2009-11-05T15:40Z,@jmb2012 Thanks for uploading the software. I had requested this software. I have however downloaded the same software you had previously uploaded. I am facing a little bit of problem. I had used one of the serials from the website that you suggested. It gave me a 30 days license and now it is not even giving me an option to enter a new serial. Any idea what is wrong?.
[T],jmb2012,2009-11-05T16:21Z,"Enter a new one. You will have to do that every now and then, usually every couple months. Worth the 45 sec it takes."
[T],jmb2012,2009-11-05T16:23Z,"sorry misunderstood your question!
open nod32 go to setup then username and password setup. :)"

,fuwad84,2009-11-17T21:13Z,"jmb2012,

number one its not a 2 year old program....its about 5 or 6 years old now, considering that has detection rates better than most modern a/v's like norton and kaspersky yet uses about 30MBs of ram when running and you never have to fuck with it ever after installng..unlike your thing you got going on here - id still say its a better choice. Kinda like all those people that stuck with xp when vista came out dispite that fact that its now nearly a decade old.

I've had the same problem. Even though I turned Nod32 off in the processes it still kept blocking me.
So I've found a solution without the need to turn Nod32 off! :)

1. Open Nod32
2. Set it to advanced mode (if you haven't done that already)
3. On the top-right corner click ""Setup"" and then ""Advanced setup""
4. Find the tab that says Web access protection and un-check ""Enable web access protection"".

This will allow you to access any Nod32 blocked site. Just remember to put it back on once you're done.

Hope it helped! :)"

,carambolapreta,2010-05-19T18:23Z,"1 - this torrent works.

2 - google ""serial nod 32"" and you ll find a lot of serials. Go to username and serial and paste them. You have to do this once a month, thats all. it takes less than a minute. If you find a username and password that says it will expire in one or two years.. you can try.. but it wont work for more than a day "
,albanian_gang,2010-05-23T15:05Z,hhuu.net for the latest serials
,prakaashmu,2010-05-28T07:11Z,"download is waste .

,M3Jota,2010-06-08T16:04Z,"Hi, when I change the user name and password all seems fine. But the expiration doesn't change. It still says it will expire in three days. Do i need to perform another step after i enter the new user name and password?"
,v_rockrz,2010-06-09T19:18Z,thx :)
,maddo277,2010-06-11T19:42Z,no this ways the best this is wot you do go to settings then system settings web enable go to customize then go to estiontions i think that wot it is not sure at the moment haven't got this on my computer yet but on my other partition then type this in http://www.hhuu.net/ the program will try to block it thats why you have to do this first and then open it and you have all the keys and usernames you need gets updated each month enjoy happy pirating

Just for the hell of it I tried on of them and it worked for about 2 weeks before I got a message saying it was now invalid.  tnod password finder works fine.  The websites are fine also unless you have NOD32 running, since it will not allow one to access them, unless you deactivate a/v and antispyware.

,ronie1014,2011-04-10T03:33Z,"guys that i love eset but the best one that you dont have to worry about till 2018 is avg internet security just go for it... i usted to have eset smart security and same bs, it does update but you always have to find new keys... YOU CAN YOU NODLOGIN AND THERE ARE MORE PROGAMS THAT I HAVE ON MY PC THAT WORK FOR IT... IT WILL GIVE YOU KEYS ANY TIME IT XPIRES AND IT WILL ALSO UPDATE YOUR ANTIVIRUS ;) BUT THE KEYS ARE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIEM SUCH AS 1 MONTH 3 MONTH AND EVEN I HAVE SEEN FOR 6 MONTHS BUT IT IS WORTH IT IF YOU HAVE TIME TO CHECK THOSE PROGRAMS EVERYOTHER DAY.... THATS WHY I USE AVG SO I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT THAT MUCH"
,theRealKarmine,2011-04-10T19:03Z,and theres a reason people dont use AVG....because it blocks ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.
,dinodig,2011-04-17T17:50Z,"A THOUSAND SEEDERS!

It this is the only antivirus that has so many seeders on the site and it is more than twice what we have for kaspersky or norton.

But honestly,is it really good?"

,valdan1,2011-07-25T06:43Z,"My next door neighbor got me into eset. I had zero problems when I ran it on all 5 systems. At that time, I got a 2 year-3 computer program purchase. The only time I thought I had a problem was when I got a Fake Virus. I talked to eset tech support & he [their tech support is in the US BTW] said that fake viruses aren't a real problem so they only work on keeping real viruses off your system. I'm gonna download this one. Kaspersky has been the only program close to eset but hell yes, eset is the best. You can run avast with it to catch the fake viruses, at least you could 23 years ago but install eset first then avast later on. that's how I did it."
