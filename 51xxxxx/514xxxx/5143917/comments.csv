,ChokeDee,2009-11-04T11:40Z,"Kop Khun Mak Kap is the way Thai says thank you very much. greetings from Thailand. Here no TV broadcast F1 so without you no F. Thanks for the quality and because lechers are never happy what about watching F1 in HD 720q (I don't even know if it's broadcasted in this quality ???). Thanks for the work all year long many week end  was waiting your post impatiently. The way you think to others gives hopes.
Choke dee & Meta."
