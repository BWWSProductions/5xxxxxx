Hey all, this is the original predator taken from a 1080p mkv rip, overall quality is good a bit grainy in places but this an old film (im told the original blu-ray is the same tho), unfortunately there are 2 places in the film where it pixelates very briefly (for less than a second each time)
I could not do anything about this as the problem was in the original mkv. This was the best source i could find.

Resolution...........1920x1080
Encoder..............x264 2 pass
Avg bitrate..........4.7 mbps
Audio................AC3 5.1 640 kbps
Container............m2ts

Please excuse initial seeding my upstream is pretty slow here im on adsl in UK, i have only 0.38 mbps upload which is about 45 KBps tops so it may take a day or 2. i dont bother with seedboxes and all that so dont complain about speeds please!

I will put this on initial seed to try n get pieces out quicker.

Enjoy and seed!	

Long Live TPB!!!!
