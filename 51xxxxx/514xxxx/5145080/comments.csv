,RockerAlex,2010-01-27T02:02Z,"Metal Magic looks like a transcode ... not sure, since it was so primitive and badly produced."
,TrashTT,2010-02-07T16:14Z,"Well, I own the ""original"", meaning the re-release of the record onto CD (true original release would be the LP) which I made into flac via MediaMonkey, so it should only be that the quality of the original CD isn't really good."

This is just how I like it! Audio has great quality.

Many many thanks"
