These pieces are no stroll through the park. They are some of the most challenging violin pieces to master, but Perlman tears through them like he is playing Chop Sticks. 

When Perlman shines he radiates like a supernova. For Sarasate, this is the most you will find of him by Perlman on one CD; it's a shame he didn't devote the whole CD to Sarasate! 

If you really want a CD to listen to some excellent violin playing this is it.




Enjoy and Seed!!
