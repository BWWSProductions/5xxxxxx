Thanks A Lot Akamuru-.

One Request To You/All,

Please Post All The PS3-TEAM Member's Account Links.

I Am Confused As There Are Many Accounts With PS3-TEAM Tag.

So Please Provide Real Ones.

That Would Be Great.

everyone else just does the same format and use bricktop's  info template, but not really part of the team i guess..."
