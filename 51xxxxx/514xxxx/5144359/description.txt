Adema All 5 Albums

Adema is a five-piece band from Bakersfield, California consisting of Mark Chavez (half brother of Korn's Jonathan Davis), Tim Fluckey, Mike Ransom, Dave DeRoo, and Kris Kohls. Guitarist Ransom left in 2003 followed by Chavez later in 2004 due to conflicts between themselves and other members of the band. Luke Caraccioli replaced Chavez in early 2005 for one album, Planets, then Caraccioli quit a few months later in late 2005. In 2006 Bobby Reeves from Level was hired to replace Caraccioli. A few months later Ed Faris of the same band was hired to replace Mike Ransom. This lineup was short lived as well and only released one album, Kill the Headlights. Once the band was back on good terms with Chavez and Ransom in 2007 they "flirted" with the idea of bringing back the original line up. It wasn't until August 13, 2009 that it was announced that the original lineup was reunited and Bobby Reeves and Ed Faris agreed to leave the band.
