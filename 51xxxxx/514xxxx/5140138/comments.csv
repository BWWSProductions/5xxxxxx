0/41.  What a no0b!  
@ catsout, Thanks m8!  Don't you hate the idiot comments from leechers?"

User fuzzmello either needs better anti-virus software, or he needs to get a lot smarter about understanding false positives from bad AV scanners."
[V],neon,2009-12-06T21:31Z,thanks very much for clearing that up  big_dad_e and velvet.
,xMajesticMeteorx,2010-11-22T00:35Z,"Hey neonrainbow I'm new at this stuff.  Your torrent is fine and I can play it on my PC. I burned it and play it on my PC, but the CDR disk wont play in a regular CD or DVD player.  That's been my problem with all mp3 and Windows audio/media files.  Got any ideas.

I will say that my other unit that has the burner only has 156 megabyte of RAM, lol. It's slow, but would that make a difference.

I'll check back, or you can catch me at MajesticMeteor@yahoo.com

Don't get me started cussing about ""Flac"" files and all the stuff I can't get on CD because of that darn type of file."
