,Ice[old,2009-11-05T13:02Z,"I think there's something wrong with this version... On CD 3, when you listen to ""Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy, Hey Girl"" you actually hear the next song; ""PF Project - Choose Life (No Fux Single Mix)"". This problem just keeps on going on 'till the end (end of CD 5).
Just ""Monty Python - Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life"" is labeled right.
So ""Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy, Hey Girl"" is not on the CD's and from there everything went wrong. When you play ""Raymond Van Het Groenewoud - Liefde Voor Muziek"" you actually hear ""Arno - Les Filles Du Bord De Mer""... a song not even on the tracklist.

Am I the only one noticing this? Or am I the only one with this problem?"
