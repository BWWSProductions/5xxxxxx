10/29/09 Rundown: Howie Sightings, Clubsoda Kenny, Curb Your 
Enthusiasm, Underwater Hotel, Lonely Dirty Anthony, Patrice Oneal 
in-studio, Shaving, Hygiene Experiments, World Series, Painful 
Losses, Jocktober, Lazlow in-studio, Bill Donahue phones in.



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
