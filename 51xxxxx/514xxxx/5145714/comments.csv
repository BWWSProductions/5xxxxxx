Thanks Atilla82, love the movie. Thanks for the upload.

A rare example where updated effects don't detract from the original."
,testor1138,2010-09-04T11:23Z,I disagree about the added CGI.  The original had a purity that Lucas sullies with his gratuitous CGI car chases and explosions.  The guy just CANNOT let things stay as they are.  Why couldnt he go work on the Xth version of Star Wars and leave this one alone.

I strongly disagree!
It is funny how some people always cries foul at the hint of CGI use! How can an aesthetic value of a film change when extra,more advanced effects are used (which really are appropriate,as the movie is futuristic in nature)  - to improve them-and by the director himself."
,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-01-01T19:04Z,Wow can't wait.  My VHS bootleg finally got ate.  It will be nice to be able to hit pause and study the chick's tittie on this digital release.
,swanbrown,2011-02-03T07:32Z,"Nice, clean, download.  Thanks.  

For what it's worth;  I didn't notice the added CGI until I read the comments and went back to look, so it's not like they ruined the movie or anything.

(And, yeah, she's got interesting breasts ;P) "
,SaltSlasher,2011-03-05T08:35Z,"George Lucas is responsible for us using computers with films, digital film, and his company ILM that he made to make Star Wars 4, has done countless major films from Forest Gump to Transformers.

All movies made before Star Wars, all of them, I love their grapics cause there so vintage and classic. Once George started the whole digital film era, they have just uped the game with each new film, so far that you don't even notice there using digital effects anymore. 

I bet you didn't know that Forest Gump was just as heavy project as Iron Man or Terminator. "
