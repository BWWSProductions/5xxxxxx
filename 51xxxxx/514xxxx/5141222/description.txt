Isaac Stern, sad to say, continued his playing career far beyond his ability to play well. A whole generation knows him as a violinist who was occasionally good, while very slippy in matters like intonation and playing all the right notes. What they've missed is the fact that, in his prime, Stern was one of the greatest violinists of all. 

These Mozart reissues show this in spades. A truly beautiful sound, with both intensity and warmth, and true command. George Szell, who conducts most of these performances, was ahead of his time in playing Mozart with cleanliness and zest. It's a great mix. Highly recommended.




Enjoy and Seed!!
