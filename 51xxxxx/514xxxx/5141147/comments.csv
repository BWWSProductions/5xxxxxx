This is mostly some electronica shit, that could hardly be called trance, there are some exceptions though, these are:

Rapha & Reminder - Beyond the Clouds (Rapha Remix)
Cold Blue - Mount Everest (Original Mix)
Corderoy - Kyrie (Original Mix)
George Hales - Glacia (Original Mix)
Deep Care - Blacks (Original Mix)
Peetu S - Salt Dogs (Original Mix)
Angel Ace - Everythings Gonna Be Fine (Serenade Remix)
Sunny Lax - Reborn (Nitroux Oxide Remix)
Dj Eco - Lost Angels (Breakfast Remix)
Will Atkinson - Coming Home (Original Mix)

It's not that the others aren't good trance, they are NOT trance AT ALL. The other songs are electronica/club/house.

Check for yourselves if you don't believe me but i warned you!"
