If anyone knows of a good clean copy of this, or RSD Lite, pls comment"
,no.way,2011-01-05T12:05Z,"Yes, there are 2 files in this .rar file = the PST_uni_patch.exe file IS infected with a virus.  My AVG says it is infected with ""Trojan horse Backdoor.Bifrose.BJC"".  The other file, PST_7.2.3_GENERAL.exe is okay - it is virus free.  I have loaded this and it works, but this 7.2.3 is v2005.9.1.0 = I tried to use it with my V3xx, but didn't work.  So, this version here is pretty old = not much use.  There are version of RSD Lite around via torrents - not sure if these will work as RSD Lite is supposed to have ""significantly reduced features"" = looks like to me RSD Lite is only for flashing...
