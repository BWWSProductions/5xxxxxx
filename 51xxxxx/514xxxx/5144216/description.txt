Who could forget that night, the 15th of November 2008, when Sensation raised the roof of the PARKEN stadium in Copenhagen.

It was indeed a night to remember, witnessed by the many that attended the first ever Sensation in Denmark. Not only did it blow people away with its award winning DJ sets, amazing pyro and laser effects, as well as daredevil acrobatics and sensual water nymphs, but it reaped a couple of awards in the process, with Sensation, The Ocean of White!


With this mind and after receiving countless emails from an ever enthusiastic public, it gives us great pleasure to announce that Sensation will return with its new show, the Wicked Wonderland, based on the surreal story of Alice's adventure in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.

Enter this world of mystery and imagination and be taken on a sensual journey beyond your wildest dreams on the 31st of October, 2009 at the PARKEN stadium, Copenhagen.
