Why don't everyone seed? You'll end up all downloading 100x faster!

Works a charm by the way thanks a lot.

Only downloaded at 50kb/s because of the few Seeders though."
,harrynutteloos,2009-10-31T16:04Z,Is it also possible to burn this file to a dvd instead of mounting it?
,jegveddetik,2009-10-31T19:57Z,"Not fucking working... fucking cunt. Spent fucking 24 hours downloading this shit, and it doesen't work. Neither for Windows or Mac."

,Davi872,2009-11-05T19:21Z,"After updating and using a crack I can load the game without a disk until I save my game, then it recognises that I don't have the disk, is there a way to burn this to disk after downloading the torrent so that I don't need daemon tools or a patch/crack?"
,GORAN(CRO),2009-11-05T22:07Z,"There is no patch needed nor crack, this is the wrong version that will only fuck your brains out. Real versioon is reloadeds, i got it, it was on piratebay but its no longer, i tryed to put it here but i couldnt for some unknown reason. You can stil find it just sign fm 2010 reloaded.iso torrent in google, download it and mount in daemon, the only problem is that youre gonna have to mount everytime you start your pc but the game is totaly worth it, im enjoing it with Aston Villa as we speek, i still cant belive that i got it this soon, Thnx reloaded"

1- extract ""[PC ~ Multi9] Football Manager 2010""(dont delete after extract)
2- Run the ""setup""
3-Run the patch win or mac
4-copy languages to sports interactive folder(/program files/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2010/data/languages)
5- mount the """"[PC ~ Multi9] Football Manager 2010.rar"" (i use daemon tools and its work ) mount the rar file and now you can play !! 

Note : always mount the rar file on daemon tools before run the game....

,helgamarie2008,2010-05-07T16:20Z,"Get the same problem this download is a F*CKING SHIT, never worked for me.

I know how to install this kind of things, but whatever is the problem isnt related to knowledge of computing if not that the ISO FILE IS CORRUPT. 

And all the ASHLeS that keep commenting it worked, are just lamers, and people that want u to install this piece of shit maybe because it contains a subprogram hidden somewhere and will take ur computer and make it to be zombie

I remember this guy 50c3ntget lots of critics because all his uploads were FAKE or SHIT.

DONT TRUST THIS GUY AND HIS FRIENDS ARE THE WORST

BE WORRY ABOUT THIS GUY AND HIS UPLOADS...."
