,marc3000uk,2009-11-03T09:34Z,"Hiya brick. Its marc30uk from demonoid. I managed to sign up atlast, wohooo, lol. I'll start uploading again later this week. Getting our PS3-Team back together ;) I have a question though if you dont mind.. You said you converted this from a MKV. I have tried with ribbot but it tells me it cant convert to avchd when its 1920x800 it would have to be 1920x1080? it would mp4 but then you dont have 5.1 dd. How do you do it bud? thanx in advance.

,earjam818,2009-11-03T09:47Z,thanks bricktop... you rock
,frenchyd252,2009-11-03T10:09Z,marc3000 u have to go into the properties on the video stream and change the crop to 1920x1080 to put the black bars in i think. i couldnt get ripbot to convert any movies for me tho it kept stalling on the 1st pass (probly some codec conflict on my pc) i use AVCHDcoder instead.
,marc3000uk,2009-11-03T15:40Z,Thanx for your help bud. I'll try that. If not i'll try the program you use ;) I normaly just convert the ones I buy or rent so its not a problem. Its just sometimes I see a MKV that I could convert & share to ;)
[T],bricktophd,2009-11-03T15:52Z,frenchy i right u have to resize to a accepted format size for a avchd
,frenchyd252,2009-11-03T17:57Z,"if u do use avchdcoder remember to set the size to 4296 not 4096 like u do on ripbot, otherwise it comes out to small :)"

Is It Director' Cut? 

Thanks ."
,XAlucarDX454,2009-11-04T07:09Z,FUCKING AWESOME!!! THANKS BT!!
,moshster,2009-11-04T08:51Z,"Thanks for the up.  I don't know how extra bandwidth would be freed up for the video stream, but have you considered using only 384Kbps for the AC3?  I say this because AC3 is only 320Kbps in theaters and it still sounds damned good. Even if it meant the video goes from 4.2 to 4.3, could be worth it?"
,marc3000uk,2009-11-04T09:06Z,Thanx dude. I'll try that later ;)
,manu4panjab,2009-11-04T18:56Z,"hey bro

Thanks Brick great work"
,sailflo,2009-11-05T07:38Z,"Hey bricktop, I love your hd ps3 movies and always make sure to seed them a lot.  I've been downloading and seeding them since last spring, and just now took the time to register and say thanks, haha.  So, thanks for all the effort you've obviously put in to this. 

Anyway, I was also wondering if you could work on creating a PS3 version of Oldboy sometime soon.  I've been searching around for a good version but haven't had much luck (I'm not a member of any private torrent sites, so my searches are limited).  Thanks."
