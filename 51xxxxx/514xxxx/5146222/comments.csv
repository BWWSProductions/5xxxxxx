,billybog,2009-11-04T18:46Z,"While I appreciate this upload, I was disappointed to find that it is part 1 of the book added twice.  Discs 8-14 are a repeat of 1-7.  There is no part 2.  Could the original uploader please re seed or comment?  Anyone have the complete book?"
,billybog,2009-11-05T20:09Z,"Im approaching my 10 ratio and am going to cut off.  So, no one cares that this is only part one?  Anyone get a successful copy?  glassman??  Come on people."
