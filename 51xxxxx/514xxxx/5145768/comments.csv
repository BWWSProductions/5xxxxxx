,iComet,2010-02-03T06:47Z,Please seed...  thanks!
,Pirate.Fice,2010-02-23T05:55Z,How is this way too big? The movie is 154 minutes... 7.5GB seems reasonable to me... Especially with a bitrate of 6.2MB..

Sure, when your nose is right on the screen you'll see a difference in quality between this 7.5GB rip and the one I first downloaded, Gopo's rip, only 2.6GB. Definition is of course higher here, picture is a lot smoother in the 2.6GB rip because details are lower. BUT once you're sitting in your couch, 2-3 meters from the screen, you won't see the difference anymore."
