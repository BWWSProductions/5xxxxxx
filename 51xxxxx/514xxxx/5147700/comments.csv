,1069,2009-11-05T07:39Z,"roddyf52  one minute you ask how to make an iso file then later you say it does not work.
rather than say it does not work just say you don't know how to do it. you do not have the skills to say that. comment on what you know."

,kelv1969,2009-11-26T21:57Z,can't get it to boot with ultra iso. 
,kelv1969,2009-11-27T23:13Z,"Installed great. no trouble. But...and it's a big but, my graphics card runs at half the speed that my other windows 7 installation runs. I use 'Video Card Stability Test' from Freestone Group. Ran it on this Experience version of Windows 7, got a fps rate of 64, then ran the same program on my other Windows 7 installation (on same laptop, dual boot) and I'm getting nearly 120 fps. Got all the same drivers installed on both installs. So what's going on? Thought this stripped down version would run faster. But no. So, all of you out there...be aware of this little quirk. Nvidia Geforce 9600m gs on Acer Aspire 7530g laptop. The Experience guys, if you read this, perhaps you could give some sort of reason for the vast difference in performance. Thanks. "
,kelv1969,2009-11-27T23:31Z,Try this utility to test out your graphics boards after installing this version of Windows 7 by eXperience. Do the benchmark test then boot to another operating system (on same computer) and run the test again. If anybody gets weird results. post it here. Here's the link for this great utility........   http://freestone-group.com/download/VideoCardStabilityTestSetup.exe

..although I've got one issue. Somehow I managed to get WMP 12 back on my Aspire One, but I've got no idea how to get it back on this desktop. It's not offered as a download by Microsoft. Could anyone give me some info on this?"
,jzenman,2009-12-29T19:10Z,A hack work around for this if you can't get it to boot is to replace his boot files with the boot files from another Windows 7 disc... That worked for me... If you don't need the auto activated stuff and you know how to activate it yourself... Or use the Remove WAT program after you install...
