Opie and Anthony "Worst of Jocktober" commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

Opie and Anthony present the best of the worst morning shows in radio:
Hosted by E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts. Phony "married" couples, 
fake radio voices, canned laughter, incessant "local" references, corny
bits purchased from prep services, fun-killing radio holes - it's all here.

Rundown: Rocky and Sue, Stephen King's Rock and Roll Morning Show with 
Bobby and Mark, Kramer and Kelly, Lee and Alana (which has since been
cancelled), Bill and Marla, Scott (and his dentures) and Todd, and last
but not least - old school "high voice" Opie and "much to happy to be
here" Anthony from the WAAF days. 



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
