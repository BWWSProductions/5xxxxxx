W5 investigates: When the RCMP pulls the trigger
Aired: Oct 31, 2009

Three men dead. All killed by RCMP officers in British Columbia. And all RCMP constables involved in their deaths cleared -- without any criminal charges. 

Internal RCMP investigation reports obtained by W5 show that in all these cases the B.C. Attorney General's ministry had evidence that contradicted statements of the Mounties involved, yet chose not to prosecute them. Those decisions made by the B.C. Criminal Justice Branch have left the families of the victims wondering if the RCMP is beyond justice.
