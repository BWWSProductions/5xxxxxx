P L O T



After Tom Hurndall is shot in the head in Gaza, his

parents Anthony and Jocelyn arrive in Israel wanting to

know how it could have happened. They expect sympathy

and co-operation from the Israeli authorities, but are

instead met with an official explanation that fails to

tally with any eye-witness accounts, and a wall of

silence. When an Israeli army report attempts to

whitewash the incident, the Hurndalls decide the only

way to establish the truth is to launch their own

investigation into the shooting, a process which brings

them face to face with both the Open-Fire regulations

of the Israeli army in Gaza, and the soldier who pulled

the trigger
