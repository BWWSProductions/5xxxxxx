Description from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard)

The Jesus Lizard is an alternative rock band formed in 1987 in Austin, Texas, and based in Chicago, Illinois from 1989 to 1999...

Their music was a scathing mix of piercing guitar, machine-like drums, propulsive bass guitar, and psychotic vocals. Denison's stinging guitar often served more as texture or coloring than as a melody instrument, while the rhythm section's stops and starts were simultaneously precise and brutal. David Yow's frenzied, often incoherent vocals were unique, unlike anything past or present. David Sprague suggests that "Yow's disjointed couplets" are reminiscent of a "preacher speaking in tongues"...

The Jesus Lizard scheduled a number of shows in 2009 with their original line-up, including appearances at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, and All Tomorrow's Parties music festivals in England, and New York including headlining show in London and on Pukkelpop in Belgium. They also headlined the Capitol Hill Block Party in Seattle on July 24, 2009.

On October 6, 2009, all of the band's Touch and Go studio albums were re-released with improved sound and bonus tracks. All the albums were remastered by Bob Weston and Steve Albini and have new liner notes and gatefold artwork.
