Zak,Nick and Aaron -- will lock themselves into the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, WV, for the most ambitious paranormal investigation ever attempted. During this 7-hour live event, they will examine the reported hauntings and ghostly activity at this legendary landmark.

Built during the Civil War, the asylum is the second-largest hand-cut stone building in the world. For decades its thick walls housed the insane, the neglected and the unwanted. Violence was a common occurrence and inmates were often subjected to brutal treatment. Shut down permanently in 1994, this massive edifice has remained vacant ever since.
