,nok6230,2009-11-10T04:54Z,over 40 people just downloaded this and nobody is seeding but me. I am killing this torrent tomorrow unless you guys decide to seed.

I forgot to mention that you need to use chameleon RC3 as your bootloader, I am not sure if the image has that partition included. If you have 10.6 already that may not install properly (didn't for me) so you may need to install it manually (google it)
Also the 10.6.2 update should work, since this build does not use the vanilla kernel. report any findings to the forum this this is still more or less in test phase."

I've hackintosh'd several machines before, but I'm having an issue with this one. 

I've got exactly the same board, and set up the bios in the same way, installed chameleon 2.0 rc3, and followed as much as I can from the insanelymac thread, but it just won't boot. Any other details you can give would be greatly appreciated.

Cheer."
