,DM(DK),2009-11-03T20:25Z,"would it be possible to make a special package to all of us who got the last pack?

meaning i really don't want to dl aprox 11 gb if it's only like 2-3 gb i need to complete my collection"
,DePo316,2009-11-04T10:40Z,"I'm sorry, I just figured anyone who downloaded the last one would just cherry pick what they didn't already have. I'll remember that for the future, I'll make an update right now."
,DePo316,2009-11-04T11:01Z,"okay I've tried uploading the update like 3 times, every time it fails to go through, I will try again in the morning"

,brega10,2009-12-03T16:59Z,"Well, I for one am not complaining... both torrents are epic in the amount of work that went into them.

DePo... thank you!!!!!"
