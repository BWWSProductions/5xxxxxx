These 2 DVD's are the result of the KNEB 1,2 and 3 MPG1 versions currently available on the net.

I have re-rendered the whole 3 mpgs as one and restored the video to a clearer standard.

The sountrack has also been rehashed into 5.1 Dolby so that makes it even better!!!

The DVD's contain the following features:

1. Dolby 5.1 intros
2. Full interaction on menus (with the video of Dazed and Confused from TSRTS as the background (also in 5.1)..hear Jimmy play that bow!!)
3. Scene Selections
4. The Cover and DVD Labels
5. A Slideshow on each DVD with 140 photos (Spread Between The 2 DVD's) from the Knebworth concert

Hope you enjoy and seed away :-)




Keep Rockin.....
