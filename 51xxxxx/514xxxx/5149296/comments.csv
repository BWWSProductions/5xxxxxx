Thanks for the D/L. This release is absolutely freegin wicked. PS3/X-Box?? My arse!

I watched this entire flick on my HTPC and it had awesome picture quality on a 42"" 1080P LCD TV. 

The sound was unbelievable as well, this Rip actually has 5.1 Surround Sound with better than  theater like quality. I have a Yamaha Receiver pushing Klipsch speakers @ 600/w per Ch.

I really wood like to no how in tha hell do u and a few other scenes, get this kinda quality outta these small MP4 files when the Blu-Ray source is usually Mega Mega huge??

Thanks again...Live Long & Prosper!

The statue of ""Liberty"" is no coincidence on the front cover, google, ""gulf stream ice age""  God, please prove me wrong. "
