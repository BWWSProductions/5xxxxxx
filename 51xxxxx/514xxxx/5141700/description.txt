Description

After a route through Nashville and country rhythms with "Lost Highway"
in 2007, Bon Jovi returns to rock with "The Circle". 
It is not the usual type of rock either it's something their fans have never heard in the group's history, 
or at least this is what Richie Sambora, Bon Jovi's guitarist, told the press.
 
Sambora also declared that the album didn't take too long to produce and that,
while recording it, he had the occasion to try a multitude of guitars to get the right sound. 
Also, he and the group's lead singer, Jon Bon Jovi, changed a few of the songs to make them just right.
One such example is the first single from "The Circle".
 
Titled "We weren't born to follow", the single was launched for the radio two months before the album's release date.
However, the melodic style of the song is not what fans should expect from the album version,
 as the band went back into the studio with a new version.
 
The entire album is positioned around a "very rock" sound, 
which reflects the mood of Bon Jovi when the group was working on the "The Circle". 
The band teamed up again with producer John Shanks, who had worked with them on two previous albums, 
"Have a Nice Day" (2005) and "Lost Highway" (2007).
