,mhikl,2010-11-22T18:40Z,"This is a strange torrent. 11 seeders and 6 leeches and yet there has been no activity in a week or so. I again downloaded the torrent and tried again. Still no activity. Transmission is my bit torrent. So, I just tried it in uTorrent and it is now downloading. Strange; this has never happened before. Just a warning. Prefer Transmission for the Mac, but glad I hadn't dumped uTorrent."
,mhikl,2010-11-23T21:14Z,Dead torrent. Only parts are available. Found elsewhere so dumping this waste of time.
