in case you wanted your size to be as close to 4gb as possible"
,stinkyrocks,2009-11-04T08:28Z,"Yeah i put 4096 in the file size but i used avchdcoder and i read on another torrent that you got to use 4296, next time i'll get it dead on hopefully"
,kube2,2009-11-04T18:23Z,"stinky, be careful not to go too big as it will not fit on an external. A couple past blu-ray examples are Wall-E and Office Space by akamaru which were just a little bit too large. anyway just a heads up to test them before you upload. Thanks for the movie much appreciated will seed my usual 3:1"
,frenchyd252,2009-11-05T00:02Z,"yeh its gotta b 4296 MB (probably get away with a couple more megs) on avchdcoder its a a pain took me a while to do the maths cos 1mb = 1,000,000 bytes on there.  Cheers 4 the up ;)"
,Prospector99,2009-11-05T01:49Z,"Has anyone downloaded 100% yet ?
It shows only 0.078 available and it is really slow.....

Anyway thanks for the upload stinkyrocks... this is a great movie... I'll continue seeding once I get it...."
,teabag87,2009-11-05T05:20Z,"mybad, i use ripbot, and its 4096 with ripbot"
,stinkyrocks,2009-11-05T23:32Z,"Sorry about the slow upload speed, I don't know what's up with my internet at the mo, been really sluggish lately, could take a few more days to upload fully"
,stinkyrocks,2009-11-07T12:52Z,"My next upload will be bruno, when this one finally finishes uploading, let me know when someone has got 100%"
