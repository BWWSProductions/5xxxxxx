Features
â€˜The fall of â€œcommunismâ€: Why so peaceful?â€™   
Twenty years ago the Berlin Wall came down, symbolising the collapse of state capitalism in Eastern Europe.

â€˜The Myth of Soviet â€œSocialismâ€â€™ 
Vladimir Sirotin from Russia explains how that country was never socialist.

â€˜Workersâ€™ State? Pull the other oneâ€™ 
How could anyone have seriously argued that the workers ruled in Russia?

â€˜Joining the killing machineâ€™ 
The campaign to win the young to war has come a long way from the â€˜Your Country Needs Youâ€™ poster with the pointing finger of Kitchener used in the â€˜First Great Warâ€™.

â€˜Afghanistan â€“ lying about dyingâ€™
The pressure to misinterpret the deaths, as the bodies come back, as nobly purifying is a cynically orchestrated propaganda exercise intended to justify the war.
