First and Foremost this as a copy of my own leagl Gothic 3 Disc, so be thankful, and 
secondly all the updates are from worldofgothic.com, I do not claim ownership because
I didn't make them, I just downloaded them and put them all in one folder.

Now that that's out of the way, asuming you already have or at least know where to get
a virtual drive emulator, here are the instructions.



1.Mount the Gothic III.iso file, not the .dvd file using virtual drive emulator such as,
daemon tools or magicdisc, if autorun dosen't come up just open the disc via my computer, 
and launch the setup.exe, and install it to wherever you want (default is C:/program files).
after it completes it will try to install Microsoft Visual c++ 2005 Redistributable, if you
have vista or windows 7 it might say it failed to install driver because it's outdated, 
just click ignore, it will then ask if you want to install directX, odds are you already 
have a better version so click no. When prompted make sure to deselect "check internet for 
updates" (because I've invluded them), and click finished, if the autorun pops up again 
just click quit.

2.Unmount the Gothic III.iso

3.Go to the update folder I provided, I Renamed the patches with numeral order so just run 
them in order from 1-5. In case you don't know what I mean, run them in this order:

1-Gothic3_RelUp_EUR
2-Gothic3_patch108
3-Gothic3_patch109
4-Gothic3_patch112
5-Gothic_3_Community_Patch_v1.73_Int_Full

(the fith one is the doosy, it has all the community patches from worldofgothic.com in one, 
but it is the best one bringing it up to Enhanced Edition, For full info check out 
worldofgothic.com or find out by playing)

4.Play game and enjoy, no crack required, keep in mind if the game runs slow, it's not an
installation problem, gothic 3 needs tremendous ram, and even if you meet the specs it's a 
huge game and you'll probably have to tweak the settings, I'll write some reccomended 
settings below, they might reduce the graphic quality a bit but the game shaould run much
better. please also note that if you find graphic errors, this is a perfectly clean 
installation, so try my reccomended settings below, but if you have errors still, it could
be a hardware issue, the gothic franchise are not known for auomatic compatability, you
might have to do a bit of tweaking to get it to work as I said, and if my settings don't
work for you, there are plenty of forums and guides on the internet that will be more 
helpful than me. These are known issues, but anyway hopefully that won't be a problem, and 
enjoy the game. 


Reccomended dettings:

Click Options:

Details:

Distance(High detail): Low
Distance(Low detail): off
Resource cache: Medium
Object detail:Medium
Shader quality: 1.4 (depending on what your graphic card supports, 1.4 is lowest so should
be supported by any graphic card)
Texture quality: Medium
Texture Filtering: Anisotropic
Vegitation Quality: Off
Vegitation View Range: Low
Shadow quality: Off
Lens flare: Off
Depth of field: Off
Rim lighting: Off
Anti-Aliasing: Off
Soft Water/ Particles: Off

(notice I have all of the extra features set to off and low, the game still looks great,
just not as pretty as it's full potential, but the game runs much better, after that it's
up to your computer)

Video: Leave as is, just make sure the Resolution is set to the same as your regular screen
resolution. 

Audio: Set volume controls to your preference, I reccomend subtitles as they are very 
helpful during gameplay, and speakers should be set according to your setup, leave default
unless you have surround sound or something like that and set accordingly.

Controls: Leave default for now and configure as needed

Difficulty: your preference, Easy is of course the basic setting, Medium increases enemy
hit points, damage, and battle intellegence to higher levels, Hard does the same as medium
but to even higher levels (hardcore gamers ONLY). 

Alternative A.I.: Is something I strongly reccomend as it fixes MANY problems with the A.I.
of followers (So they don't get stuck on edges or fall of cliffs as often). And it fixes
the target locking problems (target locking is when beasts such as wolves, etc. would 
attack you repeatedly making any action impossible, I remember one time i defeated a whole 
village of orcs, then got killed by one wolf because of target locking I was unable to 
attack. Anyway Alternative A.I. fixes that, cheers). It also makes enemys more intellegent 
providing an even balance.

Alternative Blending:

What alternative blending does is somehow (not sure exactly) alter the way you level up
and learn skills, originally your character could master everything and become nearly
godlike, but with alternative blending on you become more selective, and
specialize in areas, such as Hunting Skills to pick off enemies before they reach you.
Or One-handed and or Two-handed weapon mastery for high powered close combat, possibly 
using a shield in junction with One-handed weapons, or later mastering Duel-Weilding.
Or of course there are magic class skills as well, Innos (fire and holy spells), Adanos
(Water and Nature Spells), Beliar (Pretty much all dark magic).

So Whether you wannabe a Master Hunter killing enemies from afar, A Hardened Fighter 
Slahsing through foes with whirling blades, or a brooding mage bending the fabrics of 
will and arcane, it's up to you.

Or if you'd rather gradually become a master at everything, then leave off alternative
blending.

Note that once you start a game with or without alternative blending, it's set, you can't 
change it, you'll have to start a new game in order to change it. But don't worry it won't 
delete your old game if you start a new one. You'll just have a different set of saved 
games.
