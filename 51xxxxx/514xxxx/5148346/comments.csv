Enjoy!!!"

,Garganfunker,2009-12-03T04:14Z,Thank you very much. It works perfectly !
,David2443,2009-12-06T10:24Z,seed please!!!!!
,owns_1,2009-12-06T20:20Z,"Pirate bay should have a filter that eliminates anything saying ""SEEEEEEDDDDD PLZ!!""  Jesus christ, what are you 10?  I bet you are the same people who ask what an iso is.  Torrenting is not about people seeding, its about people uploading as they download, so they can give what they have to other people.  My advice, stop capping your upload, and stop fucking whining."
,asia_rules,2009-12-15T02:35Z,"Interesting, i'll give it a shot, lets check out your work dude!!"
,asia_rules,2009-12-15T02:36Z,What if i do not download the patches??? Is it not gonna work or what?? :o ??
,asia_rules,2009-12-16T03:47Z,"Hmm by the way i already have QUAD CORE CPU, 4GB DDR2 -800MHZ Ram, Graphic card Palit 9500GT 1GB Super

,asia_rules,2009-12-16T03:49Z,"I should not have no fear lol.....it can run anything :D

By the way i'll buy 9800GTX 1GB DDR3 most probably by 2010 Jan :p

(lil' show off"")

hehehe"
,RageWarrior666,2009-12-16T07:27Z,"Ok, thanks for the positive feedback guys, and ""asia_rules"", The patches get rid of the disc check, so it probably wouldn't run initially but you could probably get a crack from gamecopyworld.com if for some reason you really don't want the patches.

We all know this but i'll say it anyway, ""seed is a need"", so please keep it going if you can.

p.s ""asia_rules"" your computer sounds tight . "
,Mr-Rivet-Head,2009-12-26T02:40Z,"Cheers for this share,
my retail dvd got crushed after my office chair ran over it xD

Reagrding the patches guys they help a SHIT load for this game,

And regarding asia rules talking about your ever so powerful ""9500gt"" which is to be downgraded to a ""9800gtx"" my dear those are OLD cards,

Hell im running two radeon 5970's here in crossfire with an i7 cpu and its a breeze in win7,

Here's hoping the next gothic supports dx11 for tessellation then we would have some graphics worthy to rival crysis!!"

Dude, you need to grow the fuck up, he feels like he can show off, let him do it, the Internet is for freedom of speech, not to mention you were just a fucking hypocrite, saying that your computer was 'better'.

Then you go ahead and insult a brand of Graphics Cards, man, you're worse than the Console Fanboys...

Grow up please.

But, back on topic, the Torrent is good, haven't tested yet, I'll reply later."

,RageWarrior666,2010-02-05T05:17Z,"to Capnn, glad to hear you like it.

to Necrol, there is no trojan, stop spreading lies.
there always seems to be at least one person who claims there's a virus in every torrent, I assure there isn't. But if you don't wanna believe me download the patches yourself at worldofgothic.com or wherever you want"
,schokoxx,2010-02-20T21:34Z,the DL speed is ok... about 50kb/s
,loser1234,2010-02-21T22:06Z,"RageWarrior66,

Thanks for this, I like to try before I buy esp software, you've spent a bit of time doing this for other's benefit, not your own, its much appreciated.

I've downloaded the files & spent a few hours today installing/reinstalling the game & just want to help you/ others with my feedback:

My McAfee software blocked the installation of a 'trojan' whilst running ""4-Gothic3_patch112"". There was an information popup with details but it closed after a couple of seconds, as it didn't fully install it corrupted the whole installation.  As per your comment timed/dated at 2010-02-05 05:17, I reinstalled but directly downloaded patch112 from worldofgothic.com. Again, McAfee blocked a trojan from being installed! I tried again uninstalling & reinstalling using patch112 from the 'official' site, http://www.gothic3.com - EURAKA: there were no problems with this file, after which the community patch 1.73 installed ok [NB after its doubled clicked it takes a minute to start] and the game ran ok.

The graphics were 'juddery'/ slow refresh with the default settings but are now smooth with your settings, thanks for adding this info.   

I read somewhere that it is the community patch 1.73 which includes the code that negates the need to load/mount a disc - from my experince (testing pre/ post installation of 1.73) this is true. 

Conclusion

RageWarrior666 you have honerable intentions!

This does work fine, however:
- If patch file 4 causes a problem - possibly your virus software blocks installation - completlety unistall game, download patch 112 from the Offical site & reinstall whole game again but with the file from the 'official' site.

If you are asked to load/ mount a disc when trying to start the game perhaps you haven't installed community patch 1.73 fully (or not at all)."
,loser1234,2010-02-22T00:05Z,"Further to the last comment, I've done a full MacAfee scan of my PC. It's picked up & quaranteened the following 'trojan' with the option to restore:
Artemis!OAFA4DF6DC4C
I think this is the 'trojan' reported by McAfee when installing the patch112.
Googling this...
""Artemis is the ""Active Protection"" part of VirusScan and can be turned off if you wish. Basically, if something unknown is detected, it dials home to compare with the latest database. If it's not found and it thinks it could be malicious it tells you that it has quarantined whatever it is. Then it's up to you to decide.
It's dealing with unknowns so it can't make the final decision for you. It was only introduced in the last year or so."" http://community.mcafee.com/thread/7222
Looks like McAfee is being oversensitive in this instance given this was an 'official' patch!
F@@king computers!"
,cranswick,2010-03-12T19:37Z,Thanks in advance - Saw someone playing this - looks good!

,redbullah,2010-04-26T08:40Z,"download speed ranges between 120-170 kBps with my 2 mbps connection (26 Apr 2010). i have one question to community; 

i read the instructions of ragewarrior. it says it is the FINAL patch for 1.73 community patch. i guess there is no need of installing patches that numbered 1 to 4. check this FAQ page of patch team: http://www.g3cpt.eu/s/faq/15. here goes the question and the answer:

Question
Does CP 1.70 include every previous patch?

Answer to your question
Yes. It contains both all patches from Piranha Bytes (up to and including patch 1.12) as well as all Community Patches.

____________________________________________________________

There are only a few exceptions, namely some changes from older CPs, which based on request from many gamers have been removed from the fix package. The items meant here are:

Suppression of the ""Stun-Lock""-Animation
Change of the voice of the hero, when he is hit (""Argh!"")
The effects of the skill ""Manaregeneration"" was reduced [This reduction is now only active when ""Alternative Balancing"" is turned on]
written by Solandor @ 24.03.09 00:49

this is the answer for 1.70 patch but i believe same thing applies to 1.73 patch too. ragewarrior, thank you so much for your efforts. but maybe you have to change your instructions about patching order. can anyone confirm?

with best regards."

,Grizz1931,2010-08-08T01:57Z,"I downloaded this game and did everything the instructions say, I'm using daemon tools to mount the .iso file, but when I click to play it gives me an error message that says I need to insert the disk.  I know I've got it installed and have reinstalled many times, it shows up that it's mounted within daemon tools window and in My Computer, so I know its mounted properly, but just keeps telling me to insert disk and keep it in during entire gameplay.  Anyone got any tips on this?"

Please seed people."
,JnF47,2010-08-16T10:12Z,The game is just red for me in game but the install etc worked fine. I have a ATI radeon 9550 / X1050 series graphicscard
,RageWarrior666,2010-08-17T03:45Z,"Grizz1931, after the patches are installed you shouldn't need to have it mounted, so you can unmount it, and as long as the patches are installed that problem shouldn't occur. But if for some reason it does perhaps check gamecopyworld for a nocd crack, although it shouldn't be required.

JnF47, Kinda funny I have that same graphic card, old as it is, and had that same exact problem a while back. If you didn't try the settings I posted, try them, if it still doesn't work you may need a better driver. I use the omega driver bundled with the ati tray tools, I believe it is a shader error in the graphics card and if simply turning down the shader setting in game didn't work you can tweak the shader settings with the ati tools. But for full info about that you should look online, just know that it is the 9550 card which is to blame, although it is correctable as I got mine to work.

I'll assume due to the card you have XP like I do on this PC, for the omega drivers, if you go that route go to:

,amanan,2010-08-20T22:06Z,"Hi, I have a problem. I downloaded and installed the game with all patches as you said. When I start the game, everything is allright. But then the Main menu appears and there are no letters of the menu! (like new game, option etc). There is only the main screen where I can't do anything. Any idea where a problem can be?

Thank's for advice"
,martinb94,2010-08-21T00:14Z,Hi does this gothic 3 has the expansion pack gothic 3:forsaken gods?
,martinb94,2010-08-21T00:29Z,i think 108 patch is the expansion patch but im not sure?
,RageWarrior666,2010-08-22T18:33Z,"amanan, it could be a problem with the installation, I remember something similar happened to me where there was no text but the buttons did work, try reinstalling for now and make sure your direct x is properly installed, the direct x web update is a good way to do that.

martinb94, Forsaken gods is not an expansion, it's a completely seperate game, so no it's not included."
