King Curtis & Champion Jack Dupree - Blues at Montreux 
Year: 1971
Label: Atlantic
Total time: 38:19
Quality: 320 kbps

This live set from the 1971 Montreux Jazz Festival was co-led by tenor saxophonist King Curtis (who tragically would be killed three months later) and veteran blues pianist/vocalist Champion Jack Dupree.  With guitarist Cornell Dupree (in excellent form), bassist Jerry Jemmott and drummer Oliver Jackson laying down the foundation, Curtis and Dupree find a great deal of common musical ground.  Dupree has quite a few witty vocals (particularly the near-classic "Junker's Blues") while taking choruses of irregular length that keep his sidemen continually guessing.  Curtis' distinctive tenor is also heard from, making one truly regret that this was his final recording.  ~ Scott Yanow, AMG
