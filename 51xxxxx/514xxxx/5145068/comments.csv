,14Dustin,2009-11-03T11:30Z,"Big thanks for the this.

Any word on the DLC that came out with the game? is that included here or is there a achance at getting it later?"
,dramdrum,2009-11-03T12:02Z,Does this work? Can someone that completed the download confirm please?
,M1L4N,2009-11-03T12:28Z,Is this something like sacred 2... ?
,Zaknaberrnon,2009-11-03T13:13Z,"@M1L4N

,mufuti9,2009-11-03T13:29Z,"game works perfectly..I was counting the days :) thanks for this! but

Please!!
If you like this game as much as I do - buy it!
If it is not available at your country yet as is the case for me - dont sweat it!

Just make sure you pay these guys later for the time and effort they put into this game so YOU could have such a great time.

Dont waste your money for shitty games you play on a rainy weekend.

With your money you support great developers like Bioware that will continue to create the greatest game experiences available so dont steal from them. Dont betray their love for gaming and their great work and support them so they can continue to create these great games for a long time. "
,Zaknaberrnon,2009-11-03T14:08Z,"ok so, it works fine. I'm downloading it here cuz i already pre-ordered the CE but since I'm here in europe I don't get it till the 6th or even later because of the shipping. 

also, SEED SEED SEED 556 PEOPLE HAVE IT BUT ONLY 2 ARE SEEDING!!!!! stop being selfish and continue seeding for as long as you can after downloading it!"

,redzomby69,2009-11-04T03:49Z,"Okay i downloaded game unpacked, mounted, installed and when i go to start it up it says ""failed to authenticate disk please insert blah blah!"" then i did some research and found skidrow crack only which says to replace .exe file with cracked one im using winrar and when i go to replace the file it says can only replace winrar/winzip files is there anyone who can tell me in step by step how to get this game working?!?"
,Wiaaz,2009-11-04T03:54Z,"leeching at 15k seeding at 35k. should be done within a week. I'm in no real rush, I probably won't have time to play it until then anyways. Damned research papers."

,Pasta_Noose,2009-11-04T04:54Z,People don't seed get used to it! that's why PB is going to the shitta. The only way for this to change is to police the upload ratio and restrict membership. Other torrent sites are doing this and it works great. ie: UKNova.
,mo_amyot,2009-11-04T05:01Z,Protip : It's SINGLE PLAYER game therefore you do not need internet to play so just leave your P2P programs open and seed please :D
,redzomby69,2009-11-04T05:42Z,Ok f*** this if no one is going to answer my questions then im not seeding this game which i have in full I cant even play the stupid thing yet just please help me!!!!i dont know how to crack i normally just download rar but cant on account of the lack of pre-cracked files for this game HELP AND I WILL SEED!!
,Mikelitoy,2009-11-04T06:17Z,"@redzomby69 the .exe that you are looking to replace is in the folder where you ""installed"" the game. ex: c:\programfiles\bioware\dragonage\bin_ship just copy and paste the cracked .exe to that directory."
,CyberFlea,2009-11-04T06:18Z,"1200 ppl and only 6 ppl seeding lol, i dropped to 9kb for half hour lol comon ppl, it not like you need to the net to play it. chuck it on Unlimited upload like the rest of us.

To all the scrotum's out there whining about seeders. Get a clue...I've been using P2P since Napster and this is how it ""ALWAYS"" goes with popular files. Just relax and stop spamming about no seeders. It doesn't do any good bitching about it. "
,ltfeelz,2009-11-04T07:06Z,SEED! 
,jsftw3211,2009-11-04T07:47Z,ok only ONE seeder among 1381 ppl? It's fucking ridiculous
,LIONofHUME,2009-11-04T08:27Z,"No, what's ridiculous, is the fact that you p2p noobs don't know the first thing about how file distrubition works. If the seeder to leecher ratio is to wide then everyones rate is crazy slow. This is across the board for everyone, everywhere, ALL THE TIME...So stop spamming about no one seeding, what you need to do is cry about how many leecher there are. Dumbass"

What is wrong with this ISO file."
,owns_1,2009-11-04T16:47Z,"@everyone
Your connection rate only specifies a maximum dl rate, you aren't guaranteed to get it by any means.  Also have you tried enabling port forwarding?  Are you using utorrent?  Lastly make sure no firewalls are blocking your torrent client."
,NightWalker45,2009-11-04T16:50Z,Well i use utorrent and after it was downloaded i tried to install but after a while when the extraction is half way it just stops and says that the installation is corrupt. What could be the problem?
,owns_1,2009-11-04T16:51Z,"Also, reading back though the comments everyone is like ""only one seeder out 1342 people?  ridiculous"" and things like that.  The funny thing is I highly doubt most of these people even seed to 1.0, they're just saying it because they're pissed off at the seeder to leecher ratio."
,owns_1,2009-11-04T16:53Z,"@nightwalker45
what os are you using?"
,owns_1,2009-11-04T16:56Z,"@nightwalker45
Try just using winrar and extracting the iso.  Then browse to the extracted folder and run setup.exe."
,-WaRmOnGeR-,2009-11-04T18:15Z,"Hmm... can I get anyone's advice/help on this one?  

I've downloaded it and am able to mount it via latest versions of either DT Lite or Power ISO.

But when I click on ""Install"" from the menu that comes up when mounted, nothing happens... the mouse icon/hourglass is spinning but that's it.

Other games I have never had any problems, installing after mounting (in fact I installed Bordelands yesterday).  And yet everyone else here seems to be able to get some sort of installation working.  Mine just hangs... before it even begins lol.

Any idea guys/gurus?

I suppose I could try and download the Cloned version but I hate to do so since I know this version can be mounted successfully, just not seemingly installed for some reason."
,owns_1,2009-11-04T18:24Z,"@warmonger
Try right-clicking on the virtual drive and clicking ""explore"" in xp, or ""open"" in vista, then run setup.exe, in the folder.  If that doesn't work try extracting the iso with winrar, then running the setup.exe in the extracted files."
,-WaRmOnGeR-,2009-11-04T18:34Z,"Thanks, ill give it a shot *fingers crossed*"
,-WaRmOnGeR-,2009-11-04T19:55Z,"Well finally finished extracting the ISO and tried to run the setup but had same problem as when mounted, just hangs indefinitely as soon as I click on it. 8-("

I'm actually surprised to see how well it's running on my iMac 2.0GHz Core2Duo, 4 GB RAM (only 3 GB recognized by Windows XP) and a crappy Radeon 2600 with 120MB. The game runs pretty smooth with all settings at medium. 


Just make sure that your Boot Camp partition still has lots of free space, even after installing this game (20 GB!). I had to repartition mine, so I used iDefrag to compact/defragment my before repartitioning. MAN, what a difference! Speed and performance 200% better.

,DocEvil,2009-11-07T04:50Z,"@everybody who complains about slow DL speeds

You should be aware that...

1) Most ISPs impliment a technology from the SandVine corperation that detects torrent activity and disconnects you from anybody you're seeding off of every few minutes. THAT is why you have slow download speeds. Yes, sometimes you can peak out at around 400kb/s, but if you look at the average speed you're pulling it will be something more like 50kb/s because you're having to re-connect to seeders multiple times per hour.
and
2) If you cap your upload rate at a low speed then most torrent programs will cap your download speed. I'm unsure what the ratios are, but the slower you seed, the slower you leech. So either remove your upload cap or at least rais it to 100kb/s or more.

And on that note: SERIOUSLY, RAISE YOUR FUCKING UPLOAD CAP! 4000 seeders and I'm pulling less than 50kb/s?!?!?!?!? I know that my ISP isn't THAT bad and nobody is leeching off of my connection."

It comes up with the usual ""Dragon age has encountered and error"" message, I have also patched it however it crashed before the patch at the same point. I have a save just before leaving the building and it keeps happening.

,Eccentricity8,2009-11-16T03:46Z,"Hi Guys,

So this may sound noobish, but I'm going to ask it anyways.  So I installed this game in my C:/ program 86x / dragon age directory, and installed the crack and everything.  I click to play, then it starts up this windows configuration thing, but when I finally get to the game, it goes black.   I can't get out of the blackness, and can only just restart my computer.  I have windows ultimate (cracked) 64bit and a pretty powerful computer, so not sure if its the graphics card.  

But I noticed that this has been happening with several games I downloaded this past year on this computer as well.  I was able to play fallout2, mirror's edge, but not mass effect (installed it correctly, no go on the game as it goes black), and just a bunch of other games too.  Some work, some don't, and most are from Reloaded and are legit cracks that actually have been reported to work.  

So anyways, I'm pretty sure its my system, or something.  But this is annoying.  I know I know, I should just buy the game, but I wanna try it out first.  Anyways, can anyone give any tips or advice or whatever on why this is happening?  

I also just tried installing and playing Road to Glory, a relatively simple game, and it won't work as well.  

All goes black. "

It says in the information that I should mount or burn it but there is no ISO file to mount......so I ignored this odd instruction which is impossible to comply with and just extracted all the files from the download to a seperate folder and ran the ""setup"" file. Everything appears to run normally.

I entered one of the serial numbers provided and everything looks like it installs except it installs in 5 seconds which isnt right. No launcher file appears on my desktop and when I choose the ""launch Dragon Age"" option straight after the installation says it is complete, it simply cant find the launcher file.

So I looked in the Dragon Age folder that it creates on my C drive that it allegedly installs everything to and there is nothing in it except a folder called Web Links! Eh? WTF?!

,geist671,2009-11-16T18:54Z,"@Twoslice

You are downloading an image file. It's just like other PC games here on tpb.. image file (.iso). What you need to do is install a program like Daemon tools, a virtual drive. You take the image and mount it (It's like taking a cd/dvd and putting it in a dvd rom). From there you will continue with the instructions.

Hehehe.. this stuff isn't bizarre or anything.. even stuff like operating systems i.e., Vista or Win 7 are .iso and you either burn them on disc or load them with a virtual drive. If you are unsure, google is our friend :D

This game does work. I just finished downloading it, and installation was a breeze. Instructions were straightforward. Game runs great! Reminds me of NeverWinterNights. Graphics looks nice running high settings. Thanks cguarav007!"

Thanks for the advice good sir. I have mounted ISO files before and have a basic understanding of how that works.....enough to be able to get other previous games to work.

However the problem I am having is that there is no ISO file to mount. This is why I am finding it bizarre. You say I am downloading and mounting an image file (which I perfectly understand) and yet thats not what I am downloading at all. Its a winzip file. There is no image file to mount.

Are you sure?  The file is def an ISO.  If you have winrar installed and don't have Windows Folder properties to show ALL file extensions, then you may not see and ISO.  But, just to show you, the file name is ""sr-dgnage.iso""  There is NOTHING to extract."

,Twoslice,2009-11-17T05:31Z,"@TT2006

Like Geist671 above me said, it really is a very easy process and it looks like you are doing exactly the same thing I did.

You dont need to unzip anything at all. The ""sr-dgnage"" file IS the .iso file. You dont unzip it. You mount it. I use MagicISO for that. When I mounted it, it allowed me to automatically run the exe file to install the game. After it had finished I had to go into the ""skidrow"" folder and copy & paste the ""daorigins"" file into c:/program files/dragon age/bin_ship.

Am I supposed to extract  the image files into a temp folder in my computer and then try that way? The torrent and everything else  worked great, I just cant get past this damn compatibility issue to finish the installation. Is this a NET frame work issue? If so, what version do I need?

It pretty much common sense. Do you see any option in the game's interface to play online? No. That should have been your cue.

Seeding as we speak"
,coldheartzero,2009-11-25T05:43Z,"joeski22 the people saying they got it in 1 or 2 hours are flatly lying. Most residential cable connections are 5mbps. There are faster but the average person isn't going to have faster than that. Plus keep in  mind that on average you're NOT going to be getting a maximum download speed. So lets do the math- I'll calculate using the full 5mbps so downloading 7.72 gigs is going to be 3 hours and 40 minutes that's AT MAXIMUM AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH. Very few people EVER see their max download speeds.  The next step up is what's called ""Thin Ethernet"" at 10mbps and 1 hour and 50 minutes download speed. Again ONLY if you could get your maximum available bandwidth.

Joe average in mommas basement isn't going to have access to those kinds of speed, you're not going to see that kind of speed at a hotspot (coffee shop, mall etc) either.

They're lying."

The game doesn't seem to work on my computer, i wonder if thats because most probably my hardware can't cope with the game, or because i did something wrong installing it, i would really appreciate some hints or tricks of you guys to see if I can get the game running!

I Unpacked the RAR file in the same folder as i downloaded it.
then I ran the setup (though without mounting anything, but i will try it with mounting after this).
i used a serial from the list in the description
(i tried both a custom and default installation, neither of em worked).
When it was installed, i replaced the launcher with the one from the SKIDROW directory, as said in the description.
when i run the game, at the moment of startup i immediately get an error message, stating there has occured an error and that windows was forced to shut the program down.

any thoughts?"

anyways that's fine because it turns out daemon tools is a bit better than alcohol 120 for emulation, if you dislike daemon's UI just disable all that toolbar shit when you install and leave only the core files

download and install virtual clone drive (that's the one I use)

mount the image on a virtual drive

go to my computer, find the virtual drive, right click and hit explore/expand.

go to SKIDROW and copy everything in there

find where the game installed to and your bin_ship directory is the first folder there.

paste everything you copied into there and overwrite all the files

at this point the game didn't work so i restarted my machine which is a good idea.

remount the drive (you'll have to remount every time you play) and click play.

the game is pretty kick ass, so enjoy it."

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5204883/%5BFTL3%5D_DRAGON_AGE_1.02_PATCH___CRACK_WORKING

Balance

    * Daggers now apply 0.5 points of damage per additional point in dexterity and 0.5 points of damage per additional point in strength, as originally intended. This increases dagger damage for high-dexterity characters.
    * During combat, mana or stamina reserves now correctly regenerate more quickly when reserves are low. This allows players to occasionally use an talent or spell in the later stages of lengthy fights.
    * When exploring, mana and stamina now regenerate more quickly at higher character levels. This reduces downtime between fights.
    * The spells Force Field, Crushing Prison, Cone of Cold, and Blizzard now have shorter durations and/or longer cooldowns. This ensures that combatants can no longer stun-lock each other by repeatedly casting the same spell.
    * The cooldowns for several low-level sustained abilities are now shorter. This ensures that players are not penalized for accidentally deactivating them.
    * Certain battles were not scaling properly, resulting in excessively difficult fights. They now scale as intended.
    * Enemy corpses now drop health poultices and money more appropriately, resulting in less clutter in the player's inventory. 

Gameplay

    * In rare cases, enemy corpses were selectable when they contained no loot. This no longer occurs.
    * Party members whose combat tactics were set to defensive behavior no longer stop attacking after using a spell or talent.
    * In rare cases, combat tactics conditions could fail to determine whether a character had enough mana or stamina to use an ability. This no longer occurs.
    * The Rally talent no longer repeats its audio effect if it is active during certain conversations.
    * The Rally talent no longer deactivates upon area transitions or conversations.
    * The Shimmering Shield spell now deactivates when the character is out of mana. 

Plot *Spoiler Warning*

    * Promotional downloadable content items now remain in the player's inventory when standard items are removed at the end of the dwarf noble origin.
    * Repeatedly talking to Duncan after gathering the vials in the Korcari Wilds but not the treaties no longer provides duplicate experience.
    * Leliana's personal plot can now be completed if the player substantially increased her approval (through gifts) before talking to her.
    * During the siege of Redcliffe, enemies are no longer able to spawn in locations that would break the plot.
    * Bann Teagan no longer disappears when he is supposed to be accessible during Urn of Sacred Ashes. 

PC Specific

    * Controlling a summoned creature (like a ranger's pets) during certain special area transitions no longer results in odd behavior.
    * Creating a character in a custom module did not create a folder for saves. This could result in corruption of main campaign saves. This no longer occurs.
    * In some cases, the class icon was set incorrectly for characters imported from the downloadable Character Creator. This no longer occurs.
    * The options menu now includes a setting to automatically download previously purchased content that is not currently installed.
    * After installing new downloadable content, the game now always reminds the user to restart the game.
    * The icons for some promotional downloadable content items were missing. They now appear correctly.
    * The screenshot upload GUI would stop working from time to time on the client. There was a memory override that was fixed. It is a client fix. It doesn't affect the other problems we have seen on the server. 		"

,lerchos2,2009-12-09T22:05Z,"Hello dear users. I have recently noticed that most of you, if not all of you have found the function of SEEDING a torrent, but setting you upload to 0 (effectively disconnecting you from the DHT or Peertrade also seems to be popular) to somehow steer clear of the ever so powerful MPAA/FBI/IFPI (at least that is my assumtion, since TPB is working awfully slow ever since the trial against the crew) Let me lay down some ground rules for all of you who are sheepishly afraid of ""da man"" or being sued or in general seem to suffer from paranoid delusions about the governments effort to stop YOU. 

1. NO, the goverment dont spend $$$ on sitting in front of Utorrent harvesting IPs from the log, its inaccurate and worthless. This theory can now be diminshed once and for all

2. NO, the government will not SUE in EVERY DAMN SILLY CASE the MPAA files againts single individuals. The amounts of cases may be staggering, but if we would all be that dangerous, we would already be in jail. And NO, nobody is currently behind the wall, building a case against all of us..there is no conspiracy, only paranoid people who spend to little time in the sun. 

3. There are no FBI/MPAA/IFPi honeypot torrents out there, building a case this way is entrapment and illegal in most countries outside of the USA, and when you do a cross section of people who use a torrent, you might as well paste the UN flag all over it. Even if theyd have honeypots to collect you IPS, filing and suing against you would take many many years..so please stop haggering about ""oh this must be a honeypot..everyone stop your upload..""

4. Okay,  now im going to stop for a while to simply say this. There is NO way you can DOWNLOAD from ThePirateBay, Demonoid, whatever WITHOUT being visible. Whatever douchebag that got this around, or whatever ?expert? said it I don?t care. He or she is propably the one from MPAA, trying to make you look stupid. There is a large difference between Utorrent and lets say Kazaa. Kazaa uses a ?reflection? of you harddrive, to download (copy in webspace) stuff from you to  others and vice versa. I remember the myth that said that you apparently could acess someones entire system IN REAL time because IT HAD CONTACT WTH YOUR HARDDRIVE. I think ive heard som many bad myths about the internet and how fucking dangerous it seems to be. Yes its technically true that someone can do this..but why, and how would they ever find such a stupid idea compelling enoug to try..P2P is safe, more safe than keeping hard copies inside your home..so stop worrying..and start UPLOADING.

5. There is NO excuse to say..have a 10MBIT /10 MBIT and set you upload to 2 MBIT something..set it to MAX output or fuck off.

6. I know that since all this hi fidelity psycho-paranoid crap about that ?theyre watching man, they are..dude? most of you people who cant even unrar a single damn file, let alone use the simplest of inctruction to install say a RELOADED release probably act out like weed-crack-meth smoking hippies alone in your computer room, thinking that the man will run into your house the next minute cause you used the pirate bay..but let me say..smoke all the weed you want..or crack or whatever but RELAX..NO ONE is going to come to your door. It is SAFE to upload, and not doing so is more of a favour to MPAA/IFPI/all other evil companies than anything else.

7. Im sorry if I sound pissed off, but I have 50/50 MBIT Bahnhof optical fiber installed and I know that this must be hard on you people, but I would like to GET SOME JUICE. It doesn?t matter whether your upload is 1 or 10, strangling your upload or not seeding at all will lead to shitty speeds for EVERYONE, especially people with high speed connections, who instead get to feed your leeching with their bandwidth. Ive seen several IPs download from me in 4-5MBIT /Mb/s) and I get to sit and watch download speeds of lets say 20 kb/s. That?s not fair?

So here it is..in short

1. Nobody is watching us..if they do, let them..they cant hurt you.

2. Not using your upload is inexcusable

3. There are only honeypots in Winnie"
,renode,2009-12-10T02:39Z,"@lerchos2 Set upload to max output? No fucking thanks! I'd like to be able to pull up Google, thanks very much!

People, don't listen to this person. Utilizing all of your upstream bandwidth in your torrent client will cause all of your other internet applications to slow to a crawl. Don't believe me? Try it!

Set your upload speed to around 70-80%. If that isn't good enough for lerchos2, well, he/she can always go to the shop and buy the fucking game, crying to the cashier that Dragon Age wouldn't download fast enough because of all the assholes not using all of their upload speed."

Might play through it sometime in the future because of the awesome story though, but right now, it's too many boring parts to get through."
,renode,2009-12-11T19:33Z,"To Joe7rion and anyone else having XML errors on install / the install not working / installing too quickly and leaving empty directories / etc.

This issue occurred for me because I was running Windows under Boot Camp on my MacBook Pro. Boot Camp doesn't handle transferring large files such as this iso correctly from an NTFS drive, and some data was corrupted. Either install MacFuse/NTFS3g on the Mac side and transfer the iso from there to the Win partition, or install Macdrive or something similar on the Windows side to transfer the iso from the NTFS partition. Or burn the iso on the Mac side to a dual-layered disc."
,renode,2009-12-11T19:37Z,"@nimbus123 Yeah I agree. The game is kinda lame actually. I prefer to call it Knights of the Old Elder Scrolls. Or Mass Oblivion Effect. My biggest complaint with it, other than the cliche-ridden storyline and the five-billion times ""the Maker"" is said in dialogue, is how substandard the graphics are. There's a reason BioWare only used prerendered CGI cinematics in the advertisements in this game - it's because it looks like an Xbox360 launch game at best, and a polished Xbox game at worst."

Best RPG I've ever played!

it even runs faster at 
WinXP 1GB of RAM Core2Duo


=====================
Best way on Installing:
=====================
1. Extract ISO File using RAR
2. Run Setup
3. after installing, find the Crack on Extracted File
4. Copy then paste it on ""bin_ship"" Folder
5. Enjoy!

=====================
Tip when selecting a character:
=====================
1. Warrior Class = good for melee
2. Rogue = Traps, Crafting, Tactical
3. haven't tried other characters yet :P

I had plenty of space for it on the partition I was installing to, *however*, I did not have space for it on my OS partition. As stupid as it sounds, even if you are not installing it to the OS partition, you must have enough space for the game on it or else the install errors out.

,leon47,2009-12-20T23:28Z,"I'm just wondering guys,
why there's still Noobs on ""Pasting"" Cracks?

this torrent make it even EASIER to install, ok
here goes my Instructions again, am gonna make it more specific...


==============================
Without installing ""Daemon Tools"" method:
==============================

1. Extract ISO File using RAR (if you don't have one, Google it, it's FREE)
2. after exctracting it, find its Setup, then install it
3. when install completes, don't run the game, make sure you paste its crack first

you can find the crack at Extracted ISO inside SKIDROW Folder
4. copy ""daorigins"" crack file then paste it on
{ Dragon Age: Origins > bin_ship } Folder
5. play!


==============================
Using DAEMON Tools method:
==============================

1. Right click on Daemon Tools Icon on system tray (Right side of your Task Bar)
2. click Mount Image, then select the Dragon Age ISO File
3. Install
4. don't run the game, make sure you paste its crack first
5. go to 
{ My Computer > (Right click) Dragon Age Drive }
select explore then find SKIDROW Folder
6. copy its crack, then paste it on ""bin_ship"" inside Dragon Age Folder
7. Play!

5. Copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on the DVD to your bin_ship directory inside your installation folder and overwrite.

Or you can just buy the game since it is amazing and has hundreds of hours of replay value (I bought it and I'm working on beating it for a second time.) "

So I mounted the DVD, went into files, and did the Setup. It was waaay too fast of a setup to have installed anything, I checked where it was in my program files and it was just an empty folder after the setup... so I was like okay, I tried the autorun and I keep getting errors of different folders I ddint have.

What exactly is your problem ? If you got as far as downloading the .ISO file, and mounting it with a virtual drive. ( Or, burned to DVD and installed, which would btw be very stupid ), then just .. Like.. play the game ?

Always read the .nfo or Read Me's that come with the torrents, they describe what to do. In this case and with all other games, once you've mounted or burned to dvd, explore the DVD1 or DVD2 contents and find a folder '' Crack ''. Copy all of those files to the installation folder, overwrite and enjoy the game. After that, no DVD is needed."

,kiasta,2010-02-01T23:55Z,"Honestly, I played through the game already on the 360 and it's not really worth the $60 price tag. It was very linear and the only good thing about the game was the story and graphics. The gameplay was pretty much boring. There is absolutely NO replay value other than playing some of the unlocked classes.. but what is the point? They aren't really that great (Blood Mage was especially disappointing). It felt to me like a beefed up version of wow, without free roaming and less races to choose from. They should have made it free roaming with oblivion style fighting.

My point is, to all the people crying about how we should buy this game, give me one good reason to buy this game for $60 when the gameplay alone prevents me from playing through as another race? I'm only here to see the difference between 360 and PC."

Just checked the data files and it  seems that in the:

campaign_movies02.rar the coronation_king_only.bik file is corrupt. All other rar's are OK and extract without problem. Maybe some files are just very vulnerable when downloading and have very high change of becoming corrupt. It can't be random too since I have DL'ed the game 3 times and problem is always the same. So instead of having to download whole 7+ gigs .iso and hopeing to get lucky someone with a working game could upload the coronation_king_only.bik  - its only 12 megs."

Copied the game from CD to HDD. Extracted campaign_movies02.rar in data files. Made a copy of coronation_queen_only.bik and renamed it to coronation_king_only.bik. Compressed the module and renamed it to campaign_movies02.rar and copied it back to data folder. Now game installed fine. Its probabaly related to some quest wherer somekinda king only, queen only and bot outcome. Now the game is just gonna play same video for two autocoms but atleast its possible to intall ja and play.

Some program's auto detect rather than just trying to launch, and thats when you have problems with unproperly installed video cards and such."

To everyone bitching about the game not working, here's 3 questions.
Does your computer meet minimuim spec's?
Is your hardware installed properly?
And are you running it on Window's XP?
If you answered no to any of those 3 questions, theirs 99.9% sure your problem. While yes, the game was made to be compatible with Vista, as we all know, Vista is a horrible Operating system and is very incompatible with 99.9% of Torrented games, such as this one."

You are fucktard yourself. Theres tons of people all over the internet who have purchased the game via EADM or from shops and having the corrupt files problem. So to put it simply - the game is good but quality is total shit."

,Qqlqr,2010-02-19T16:54Z,"TO EVERYONE WHO HAVE CORRUPT FILES DURING INSTALLATION!!!

The torrent is good and all files are correct. Also the corruption has nothing to do with operating system, however theres just big chance that they get corrupt during download, during moving to some other folder etc. Solution is to use uTorrent client and when game is 100% downloaded press stop and execute ""re-check"" option for the DAO. then it should stop at 99,9%, then resume. I spammed it like 10 times and now the game installed fine. Probably theres no need to re-check many times but it surely worked and I didn't even download whole game again but just switched the client and did re-check."
,Eso84,2010-02-19T20:08Z,"@Qqlqr

Hey bro thanks for defending my few comments about the files being corrupted,  i know the Game is good and fun , im  a major Nwn2 D&D fan..

Now if you have played the game Heroes ( from the original xbox), and you have played World of warcraft, you have basically played this game allready. is basicaly a mixture between these two games... is nothing special, i don't know what all the big fuz is all about... other than that the game works fine.

,elcapizzo,2010-06-07T18:09Z,"Just installed then and played for about 1.5 hours.

So far so good.

Installed as instructed, extremely easy and straight forward.

First time I started a new game I got a black screen before loading the character customiser. I had to end the game and restart, worked fine the second time so it might just be a random game bug.

I have this running on Windows 7 x64, E8400 C2D CPU @ 3GHz, 9800GT 512MB and 4GB RAM. Game runs smooth at 1920x1200 resolution, high graphics settings. 

I must note though that this game is quite CPU intensive, it throttles my CPU at 100% (both cores) when playing. A quad core would definitely be a plus, but not essential as long as you have a decent dual core CPU.

I don't normally like RPGs, but after hearing all the rave reviews I had to try it out. It's pretty good so far, if you like games like Neverwinter Nights etc you will like this I think."

,C_Tripp,2010-06-08T07:55Z,not sure what everyone here is talking about... I'm downloading at 700kb/s and uploading at about 250kb/s. I got 19% after less than an hour.

,C_Tripp,2010-06-08T11:16Z,"The game is working flawlessly. I have never had an easier game to install so if you can't figure it out, you dont deserve to play it for free and should just go buy it."

Been playing it for about 8 hours in total now and no issues so far.

Has anyone managed to install/download the optional extra quests that are available throughout the game? I assume that because the game is cracked and we don't have an account it wont work.

Would be interested to know."

,sentientphil,2010-06-12T11:15Z,"forgot to add.... you do need to buy it to get all the downloadable content, and within an hour or two there were a few extra's to download, but didnt expect you can... not sure on that one though... but one thing i have learned, never go online with a pirated game....  but, as i always buy a game i like, then there is no issue... but i didnt like it, so im not buying it! deleted this long ago!"

,dirty_fingernails,2010-06-12T13:03Z,"I may not be the smartest person when it comes to torrenting, but this game period has been ridiculous to get. Normally I can download at around 350kb/s, on this I get that for about ten seconds before it's back to 5-15. This is with several different torrents I've tried.

I don't know why the hell RPG-gamers don't seed. Maybe it's bandwagoners that only pirate because they can't afford to buy the game.

I've tried about everything to increase my download speed. Trackers, tried a modem connection. Got a friend to try downloading it. This was after I read the comments that were ""I have no idea what people are talking about, I have great speeds!"" I even tried downloading it on my laptop with a better wireless card. Nothing.

Two days in, I'm finally up to 28%. Simply put:


Come on motherfuckers, seed."

I'd still have it but a few months ago my hard drive got wiped and I didn't have the time to play games, so I decided to screw it and wait.

,Haito,2010-06-18T14:29Z,"I'm having a small problem, I installed this got it working properly. But after installing the game I began installing the DLCs, which worked fine except for the return to ostagar DLC, which requires a patch, but the problem is that if I install (as I did) the patch it saves over the daorigins.exe file included in the SKIDROW folder. And due to that I get the authenticating error. If I use the SKIDROW's daorigins.exe again I have every DLC except the Ostagar installed. Any help/tips/suggestions?"

Don't use bittorrent until you know how and don't come here and whine. Telling people to seed in the comments has zero effect on weather people will seed or not.

Open the .iso with Daemon again, and hit explore instead of autorun, you'll see a folder called SKIDROW, all you need to do is copy the files out of that and into the bin_ship folder, inside where you installed the game, Hope this helps :)

,Arctavius,2010-11-27T07:30Z,"These instructions work like a charm. Mount the ISO, Easy install, overwrite a file and start playing.

I also had no trouble getting seeders. I had 91 seeders I believe with a 1.4 mb/s download speed.Maybe an hour and a half to download the file. I will of course seed myself. I usually seed until my ratio is 6.0. 

If I understand the ratio business correctly, you're uploading/distributing 6 times the information that you downloaded if your ratio is 6.0. So for every video/game/MP3 file that you get, you're sharing/passing on 6 more copies. That seems fair to me. You can't seed forever right?

Just copy ""daorigins.exe"" from skidrow folder to bin_ship folder. If it asks you to ""copy and replace"" or ""ovewrite"", just say yes.

Now if it doesnt let you replace/overwrite the file then just delete the original ""daorigins.exe"" and paste the cracked one in there. That should work."

,jsalol,2011-07-06T18:19Z,"First off, for those who don't know where to put the skidrow files, ALL game cracking uses the same basic formula. Unpack or unzip the game, mount using an ISO mounter (Daemon is best), move the cracked (or skidrow in this case) files to the game instillation folder (the folder in your hard drive the game installed to after setup), run whatever keygen that might be needed, or usually with skid check the torrent site for a keylist. Hope that will help

@cguarav007 
I'm kinda new to TPB, long time user, but who bothers to make an account if you don't upload your own shit... lol, I'm interested in helping the Skidrow team out, and am having trouble getting an email or on site message option for you. You can reach me at jsalol.jl@gmail.com

My help offered is outside of the standard programming or cracking, though I could help with that to some degree... Instead me and a group of friends are starting a website that spans a large area of the gaming niche. We would love to have Skidrow represented there in our reviews.

Think I saw someone else touch on it... also really EVIL ISPs slip viruses in there too... nothing too malicious, but enough to slow you down... and for all you people complaining about the seed rate? sorry...

,commonfrog,2011-11-21T21:44Z,"This is a very nice download! No problems with the install or download at all, game plays perfect.

I am having some trouble though, and don't know if anyone else has had this so sorry if it's been addressed already. The game was going well and working great until once when I was in the middle of a cutscene, everything just stopped. It wasn't frozen, things were still moving and sound was still playing in the background but basically the characters just stand in silence. There's nothing I can do to get out of it but force-quit the game. It wouldn't be a problem except it is also happening during a cutscene that is required to progress through the game. I don't think it's the torrent, but I wanted to know if anyone else had this problem or if anyone knows how to fix it."

,prs_fan,2012-02-03T07:23Z,"razzy - I don't know what you mean, check your controls to see what the pause button is, what the main menu button is, and what the inventory button is. Otherwise I don't know at what part it's paused.

Game works fine, only bug I noticed so far is the Eye Color will not change. Also, for it to run even playable, I have to have all graphics options on their lowest levels, and I have to run it in 640x480 mode and as Administrator. Of course if your computer is bad ass, you can run it at more appreciative beauty. But hey, it still looks good enough and plays fine. Haven't gotten far in it at all yet, but just wanted to comment and say thanks for the upload, I couldn't ask for more."
,RenRiyu,2012-03-17T01:55Z,"Well every time I try to install it, it refuses to install. Someone said it was a problem with bioware? I'm guessing this is never going to work.. if someone who is in this situation found a way, please let me know."

I have looked positively EVERYWHERE. The closest I've come is the skidrow MSInfo Document, which I have copied and pasted to no avail. If someone could help me, I would love them forever. Thank you."

,reythekid,2012-06-25T19:48Z,"Hoping someone could help me here. So I downloaded the torrent, pretty quick like 2 hours or sumn like that. Anyway so I mount it on daemon tools go to install it, first the autorun gives me an error, so I go to the manual installation and after I click accept terms and conditions and hit install, the installation crashes. Each, and every, time. : ( It's really annoying. "
,Nullvastvoid,2012-07-20T20:53Z,"@ gwsyren 

Go to the torrent. Install magic disk from the internet and launch it. Nothing should pop up. GO to your and click ""show hidden icons"" on the taskbar and you should see the magic disk logo (a CD). Righ click on it, set the number of drives to 3, go to virtual CD/DVD-ROM and click one of the dirves. It should let you browse for the ISO file named sr-dgnge (form the torrent). Click it and mount. It should lauch installer, yadda yadda ydda. go to my computer, rigth click and select open for the dragon age CD. you shouldf see a Skidrow folder in there. Copy and paste it into the game bin folder. It should work"
,Palpatin3,2012-07-24T09:55Z,"It's working, install was perfect. But I can't install patch 1.5. I don't have the DLCs I don't want to bother to download them for now. So, do I have to install all patches one by one (1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5)? Or I have to have the DLCs? Tell don't said nothing about patch 1.5 if I need the older patches."
,Palpatin3,2012-07-24T10:42Z,"Alright, me again. 1.5 patch is a one for all patch and (strange) after installing Dragon I had to restart the computer before applying patch 1.5 successfully. First game I needed to do that ever for a patch. So the game is working fine."
,spopes232,2012-07-25T02:40Z,"Time for a rant: I am sick of whiny fuckers complaining about downloading at 1kbs. This is not the fault of the torrent in nearly every case. This isa problem with either you or your computer. First, PATIENCE! IT TAKES A WHILE TO CONNECT TO PEERS! A way to tell whether its your fault or the torrent is to go to the tracker tab in uTorrent (or w/e you are using) and check the number of seeds. For instance, with this torrent, there are 400 SEEDERS. That's over 9,000! While they may not all be seeding at your max dl rate, be patient and ""they will come"". And remember that the internet is just like being in physical society, you don't mouth off or the intelligent people will be forced to control you.

There.
Done."
