,beppe1987,2010-05-12T21:18Z,"having a hard time trying to copy this file to a USB flash drive, tried with 2 diffrent, one 8 GB and one 16 GB. the first two pirates 720p BRRip by VISION worked like a charm :S Avatar 720p did'nt work either, had to settle with 480p :( everything is avi containers so im totaly puzzled :S i heard AVI dont support HD but as i said, the two others worked just fine... anyway the problem is that some 720p does not work on my flash drive, it says the drive is full although it's not? anyone know what to do? :S"
,DracoPsycho,2010-05-16T20:07Z,"@beppe1987: the files that you were able to put on your flash drive were probably below 4GB? Usualy flash drives are formatted in FAT32, it doesn't allow files bigger than 4GB. You could reformat your drive with NTFS but then various devices other than PC with Windows can have problems with reading it."
