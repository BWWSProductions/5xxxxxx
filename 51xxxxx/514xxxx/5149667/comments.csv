,jhm69,2009-11-06T11:20Z,"V-9/A-9/Great Show/Thanks for the upload

Plea to Release Groups - Release more stuff encoded in H264 Standard Def.
30 min TV show less than 100 Mb, 1 Hr TV show less than 200Mb, Movies 250-500 Mb.
Why not release 2 versions of everything, one standard, one small?
For the many with limited bandwidth or slower connections (3G).
Check out Blueman's stuff. Thanks!"
