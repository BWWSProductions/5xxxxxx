,Timewarptwo,2009-11-01T06:14Z,"WOW, this was just released to the public a few days ago. The only program I have ever used that recovers hard disk space. Works great on my 64bit Windows 7. THANKS A MILLION!!! Keep up the great work. PS. I don't care if you do take credit for the hard work you do by displaying your name. The excellent job you do keeps this site alive!!! People who complain or criticize obviously don't upload anything."

,cclloyd,2009-12-02T04:29Z,"I could make one but it would have so many bugs, as it can only be run on the OS its packed on, and you cant do any disk operations or things that need rebooting.  Not to mention that just about half the apps wont work without a full install.

(there are some programs that should be portabalized and some that arent. This is one of those that shouldnt)"
,Griffrez,2010-02-24T05:09Z,"I like this app. But, to clean my computer I so the following, (and in this order of cleaning, and not simultanously) Windows 7 Manager; Advanced SystemCare Pro and TuneUp Utilities 2010.

On TUU 2010 it normally detecs one invalid registry, and when it needs, that the disk is fragged. Still useful for configuration problems."
,ikisx,2010-03-07T00:39Z,Thank you so much! I'm a huge TuneUp user and this a WOW!

,themaritimeman,2010-07-01T23:12Z,"Well, it worked for a couple of days, then it said I had I was a victim of software counterfeiting. I didn't register, so I guess they blacklisted the serial.

Thanks though."
