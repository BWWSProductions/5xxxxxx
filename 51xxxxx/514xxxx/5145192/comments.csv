,Xander_Dean_Macio,2009-11-05T15:17Z,why do we need 3 different mkv versions of this episode? the answer is we dont.. what we need is an avi.. any avi.. i dont care about the quality or size.. i just wanna be able to watch the bloody thing

,LtGweedo,2009-11-10T03:01Z,I agree with Xander on this one. I dont want to have to download ANOTHER program for viewing. Does anyone know if there is something I can download on to WMP so it will play it?
