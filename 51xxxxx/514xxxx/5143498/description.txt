Girls Aloud: Out of Control Live from the O2 (2009)


Cheryl, Kimberley, Nadine, Nicola and Sarah first came to the nation's attention
in 2002, as the winners of Popstars: The Rivals. They were the first all-female
group to debut at Number One in the UK and the first band ever to get the
Christmas Number One with their first single, 'Sound Of The Underground'. A
hard act to follow, but subsequent releases have proved these girls are
anything but one hit wonders.
