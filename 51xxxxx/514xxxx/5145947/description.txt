Peter Schiff -- The Little Book of Bull Moves in Bear Markets: How to Keep Your Portfolio Up When the Market is Down, 2008, PDF format, 21.4 MB



His first book. Worth reading -- he seems to have been right about nearly everything!

EDIT: This is actually Schiff's second book."Crash Proof" was the first, in which he more or less predicted the subprime meltdown and subsequent economic slowdown. My bad!
