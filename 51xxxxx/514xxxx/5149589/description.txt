For those of you who bought your iPhones to help get your lives organized and free yourselves from the ball and chain of desktop computing, iPhone at Work: Productivity for Professionals is the book to show you how.

You'll learn mechanisms for developing effective workflows specific to the features of the iPhone and also efficient strategies for dealing with the specialized aspects of business and professional lifestyles.

From the introduction and throughout the book, author Ryan Faas targets professional users of the iPhone. You'll tour the built-in applications and configuration options, always with work and productivity in mind, and discover all of the enterprise features of the iPhone, learning how to configure and use each one.

Then discover the App Store: source of all third-party software.
