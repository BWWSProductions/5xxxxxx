John Stuart Mill was the greatest thinker of all time in respect
of his powers of articulation. Far beyond any of the ancient philosophers
of Greece or anywhere else since, John Stuart Mill brings true brilliance
to his clear headed discussion of the most important philosophical issues as
concerns the conduct of man in a fair and just democracy as he envisioned
his ideal surroundings in this respect.

This is the best treatment of his work(plus), in mp3 audiobook format and with
a supplementary discussion by a BBC panel. A must for all students. The cassette
version has gone out of print, however we plan to acquire the rights for all
to enjoy, or we will alternatively bring out a competing product for free as
the text has long been free and in the public domain, (by legislation).

Great for your office or take along ipod for school.
