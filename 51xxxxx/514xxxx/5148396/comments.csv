I remember when I was a kid I loved to watch specials on bigfoot and stuff, and it always pissed me off so much how they never followed anything up, and at the end, they'd always be like, ""well, I guess we'll never know, and it will remain a mystery.""  And then Josh and this show comes along and he goes wherever the fuck the search takes him, no matter what.  Fuck ya, I love it!"
