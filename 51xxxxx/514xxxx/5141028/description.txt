Joe D'Amato delivers what is perhaps one of the most explicit nunsploitation flicks ever made. As nuns get possessed by the devil, the situation only worsens when well-meaning priessts try to intervene.

Legendary cult-sleaze director Joe D'Amato helms the "nunsploitation" film IMAGES IN A CONVENT (IMMAGINI DI UN CONVENTO). Packed with copious sex and nudity, the film tells the story of a secluded convent where a diabolic statue possesses the nuns, causing them to blaspheme and commit sexual depravities. When a group of priests intervenes to try and exorcise the nuns, the presence of the men at the convent drives them to even more perverted acts. Like a more explicit and exploitative version of Ken Russell's THE DEVILS, IMAGES IN A CONVENT has been called the most disturbing entry in the "nunsploitation" subgenre.
