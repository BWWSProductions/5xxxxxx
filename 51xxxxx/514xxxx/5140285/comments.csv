,kube2,2009-10-30T02:24Z,"patrick, I also use Blu-ray as a search it brings up a few more than PS3-Team. Just look for the 3.99GB or 4GB movies.
Let me know which ones you are downloading and I can start seeding again. I have most of their movies and some with low seeds took me a  long time so I would gladly try to help someone else since I have good upload speed."
,number6mbw,2009-10-30T02:46Z,"I  always search ""PS3 1080p""

It gets most all of them."
