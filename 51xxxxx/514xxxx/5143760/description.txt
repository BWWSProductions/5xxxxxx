George Harrisonâ€™s first-ever career-spanning solo hits collection, Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison. Special packaging includes a 28-page booklet featuring previously unseen and rare photos, and newly-written liner notes by Warren Zanes. The collectionâ€™s 19 tracks have been digitally remastered by Giles Martin at EMIâ€™s Abbey Road Studios. â€œLet It Roll: Songs by George Harrison is a gathering of material that takes us far into the territory that was ultimately a place unique to George Harrison,â€ writes Warren Zanes in his liner notes essay for the new collection. This collection is the first to span Harrisonâ€™s entire solo recording career, including the #1 Billboard Pop singles â€œMy Sweet Lord,â€ â€œIsnâ€™t It A Pity,â€ â€œGive Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth),â€ and â€œGot My Mind Set On You." Let It Roll also features live recordings of three timeless Harrison-penned Beatles songs, â€œSomething,â€ â€œWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps,â€ and â€œHere Comes The Sun,â€ from his 1971 all-star Concert For Bangladesh benefit at Madison Square Garden. â€œThe keyhole into the world of George Harrison is the music itself. Yet his songs and the accomplishments for which heâ€™s remembered are inextricably boundâ€”and those accomplishments are, without question, eclectic in scope,â€ Zanes writes. George Harrison is a twice-inducted member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a solo artist and as a member of The Beatles, and an 11-time Grammy Award winner for his recordings with The Beatles, Traveling Wilburys, and as a solo artist.
