my internet provider blocked downloading files from thepiratbay.com"
,gammy69er,2009-11-09T14:27Z,"BEWARE - I know it's a little late and all, and we don't have any other HD options, BUT this file has 5.0 audio.  Works great on pc, but if muxed to TS, will not play correctly on PS3 - Maybe xbox360 too (sorry, don't have one so don't know)

Audio will be ""Chipmunked"".  To correct this add in an LFE channel (nero soundtrax will create one from the demuxed ac3) or, as i did, just replicate one of the surround channels to the lfe channel - dirty, bu it works.  Used eac3togui to decode .ac3 to .wav's (selected wavs under file type and entered title) and used ""wav to ac3 encoder"" to put back together (couldn't figure out eac3)
Seems only to be problem on CTU files.  Rest have 5.1 natively

Good Luck"
