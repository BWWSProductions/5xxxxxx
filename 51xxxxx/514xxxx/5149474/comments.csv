,antalgebra,2009-12-10T10:39Z,"works very good!

some adjustments to be made, most improvment (per time spent) is the first one:

-Is it possible to make the order go in a zig-zag, so that it doesent take my guy walking all the way to the beginning of each Row, every time?  this would really improve the speed by about 50%.  
-Maybe also putin a 'delay' functionality after a certain number of rows, so that it can start over automatically.  (take a step further, and add an auto-seed picker, and have all three steps automated)

Other than that, VERY good program, and easy to use!"

   4. When Windows finishes your search, hover over the ""In Folder"" of ""parser.exe "", highlight the file and copy/paste the path into the address bar. Save the file's path on your clipboard because you'll need the file path to delete parser.exe in the following manual removal steps.

   3. To change directory, type in ""cd name_of_the_folder"".
   4. Once you have the file you're looking for type in del ""name_of_the_file"".
   5. To delete a file in folder, type in ""del name_of_the_file"".
   6. To delete the entire folder, type in ""rmdir /S name_of_the_folder"".

,theloston3,2010-03-31T03:53Z,"Not a very good bot at all sorry... It runs off of a person's coordinates that they have to find out themselves which adds a whole other level of thought which just makes botting pointless anyways if it requires thought, also it does not support random shaped farms, not everyone uses perfect square farms so that is a big issue. You need to make a bot that will ADAPT not just enter coordinates buddy, look up Farm Helper, compared to it, this is shit, sorry."
,doc76,2010-04-10T02:00Z,"assholes it works great,u deepshit dont know to read with understanding,no viruses also ,in 4 weeks have passed18 levels so it works perfectly..."
