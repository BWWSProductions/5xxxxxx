THANKS FTL3!!!"
,enortimus,2010-05-24T03:30Z,"This works. I used Daemon Tools lite.
When you open up the .rar, drag both the .mdf and the .mds to your desktop. Then open up daemon tools and mount the .mds, then run the game and instead of it saying 'unable to locate disc. validate some shit' or what ever it says, it will just open the game up. "
,zinubes10,2010-07-21T16:21Z,Daemon Tools lite wont work on my computer it just quits because a error i unistalled it and reinstalled it and it still is the same so i use power iso but i wont mount the files so i call this fake >:(
,Alpha0m3g4,2010-11-13T23:36Z,"This worked great! - After STEAM messed up the activation keys I bought the game and was unable to play - Using this RISEN Mini Image allowed me to bypass Steams Mistake - Security and actually play the game I bought!

Cheers!"

,bobby493,2011-01-17T01:01Z,"When I mount the image in deamon tools lite it just opens the image in explorer showing the files.
It does not sart the game"
,veikko575,2011-03-12T14:45Z,Really fast speed.If skullmonk3y said that it works with daemon tools lite.Then it's gonna work for me too.Because i have daemon tools lite.
,gabbza,2011-03-29T22:30Z,"it wont work for me ! When i mount the file with alco120 or dt lite there is just a folder popping up. 
First time im about to use a mini image.

,asulthebest,2012-01-31T18:17Z,just rename this file .zip and what's inside mount with Daemon Tools ;)
,boogeyman112,2012-02-07T13:25Z,No seeders on because it wont let me install ?
,ElNota666,2012-04-01T11:38Z,"Can't Install :l, I just mount .mds and .mdf files and It's doesn't run, And I Use Daemon Tools Lite, Why It doesn't run? D:"
,Davenporterk,2012-04-03T17:29Z,"Can't install the game either, mount the .mds file fine but as soon as I go into the virtual drive assigned to the game and click setup I get the message: This file is not compatible with the version of Windows you are running.

Also, I have changed around a lot of the compatiblity options as well so that isn't it.
"
,pheromonz,2012-05-11T17:21Z,"Thank you FTL3,

Works like charm with Risen Multi 5.rar
