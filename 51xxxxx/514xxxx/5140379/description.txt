 Evil 9 are Pat Pardy & Tom Beaufoy ... Tom Beaufoy and Pat Pardy first combined skills in 1998 and were quickly identified as a quality DJ/Producer duo by Adam Freeland who signed them to his Marine Parade label. Since then each of their releases has distinguished Evil 9 as innovators who refuse to blend into the scene. Deriving their musical flavour from multiple influences - hip hop, punk, deep house, garage rock, techno and kraut rock - they create an original and minimal sound packed with emotive ability. Evil 9's punk rock DIY attitude is epitomised in their remix of ILS' 'Music' wich stirred the breaks scene - irritating purists, exciting the open minded and inciting the masses to jump and pogo. Recent collaborations have included work with Aesop Rock (DEFJUX) and Juice Aleem (New Flesh).
