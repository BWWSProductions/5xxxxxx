,Danux01,2009-11-06T02:13Z,"Not quite sure how to take your comment Meatbag666. Your link is to a rip 2.5 times as large, with Japanese audio?"
,bumjeans,2009-11-07T23:46Z,"Brilliant idea!! Always wanted the Streamline dub without having to watch a dodgy full screen copy of the movie.  Many thanks for this, hopefully everything is synced correctly."
,Quwel,2010-01-14T02:49Z,the audio is heavily out of sync any one got any sugestions? ive tried moving the audio track with gom but i cant even decide if the audio is ahead or behind and even if i do im not sure which way to move the audio?
,Danux01,2010-01-15T09:07Z,"  I've watched this a couple of times since making it, and the sync seems OK to me. Are both the 2.0 and the 5.1 tracks out of sync?
  It has occurred to me that  you may not be aware this show was rendered for the Japanese market first. The English track was dubbed when it was brought to North America years afterward. The mouths of the characters would conform to the original Japanese dialogue much more closely. I find If I focus on the sound effects (gunshots, doors, etc) for AV continuity, rather than the voices, it is easier to settle into.
  Or, just grab the Japanese dub and read the subtitles while it plays. The first comment has a link."
,Quwel,2010-01-19T03:32Z,"yeah sadly both seam out of sync but il try again later its prob just my download or me being picky lol the sound effects didnt seam to match either but il investigate more later

thanks for replying btw :)"
,beastman22459,2010-03-10T22:52Z,"Danux, ur an absolute legend for making this one. Best possible quality, and the original dub (didnt like the new dub at all, cant have akira without Leonardos voice after all). Just finished burning to dvd, now im gna sit back and enjoy. U rock man!!!!!!!!! p.s. I think both tracks are in excellent sync, despite what the guy above said. Thanks again man."
,remy1492,2010-07-05T22:40Z,"1000Thanks for this.  Since 1992 I have been watching my streamline VHS pirate copy in horrible quality because the new DVD sucked with new voices.

This has made my life complete!
seeding for all the other guys like me.

Now its off to find Macross with the Aussie dub voices."
,tobias28,2010-11-06T02:46Z,Thanks soooo much for this. I have been looking high and low for a DVD/BD with the original audio. This uploaded is highly appreciated Danux01.
,Mathlol,2010-12-20T08:41Z,"Wow, what a great upload.  Original audio is rare.  

To all the critics - its hard to find good english audio copy. This movie is on of the greats where the movie as a whole flows well with the dub.  After muxing in a jap track, my end file will be complete!"
,Anonsen,2011-01-11T23:25Z,"Hey, got an account just to say thank you for this! You're the man! "
,kuhas,2011-02-03T17:51Z,"Same here. I created an account just to say thank you for this. 

Blu-Ray + Original English dub is something I've wanted for a long time. Hell, I would have even settled for DVD + Original dub. The new English dub was awful.

You are a god among men. Thanks for your time in doing this."
,powerslave12,2011-02-03T23:49Z,"Thanks for this, I need the orig dubbing, got Akira for my birthday on VHS when I was 12. The best manga feature by far and one of the best films altogether. Don't understand how they justify te re dub, it's like them dubing over starwars or sth.

Also it is a milli second out of sync. Can be sorted in vlc or remuxed either way an easy fix."
,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2011-02-09T03:40Z,Great upload thank u very much!!
,bigporch,2011-05-05T11:14Z,"Dude you're the man. One of my favorite movies, and I was excited when the DVD came out years ago so I could get rid of my bootleg VHS copy but the voices weren't nearly as good. This is some good work here. Haven't watched it in a couple years but haven't heard the original audio since mid 90's so this is gonna be a treat."
,thespike,2011-07-31T16:04Z,works perfectly.I used convertxtodvd and im blown away how good it is..V10 A10..Thank you for all the hard work put into this.
,channelthirteen,2011-08-07T21:42Z,"I will go for the Japanese language version, but I wanted to thank you for making this.  You've really done a remarkable thing...  in fact I will check out this english dub simply because I am interested in audio (ORIG ENG DUB) as it's been described.  Again, really amazed that you made the effort for this and made so many people happy!  "
,EmoEmoEmo,2011-09-21T20:22Z,Thank you very much for this! +1
,fedayin,2011-09-28T21:43Z,thanks!
,morepunk,2011-11-14T11:00Z,"am i the only one here who is downloading this for the streamline vers.? i freaking love Cam Clarke (kaneda, leonardo), plus this was the first copy i saw.

i hope this works, either way i can't thank you enough. i think it's even out of print, unless u LIKE the pioneer vers. BLECH!"
,salitrov,2011-11-30T06:50Z,"Best rip out there. Quick download too, keep seeding!"
,rsl87,2012-02-23T00:03Z,Can anyone tell me how to choose the 2nd audio when converting (to .mp4 for my PS3).. because the first audio track is actually the pioneer one and i want the original for when i convert
,Danux01,2012-02-24T10:57Z,"@RSL87
STREAM 0 - H264 MPEG4-AVC (Part10)
STREAM 1 - AC3 STEREO @ 192kbps/48KHz
STREAM 2 - AC3-5.1 @ 448kbps/38KHz.

The Pioneer track is the 5.1 track, the stereo track is the Streamline dub. Don't know why your preferred analysis software is flipping them around."
,TubeBar,2012-03-02T19:49Z,"You can't just ""work"" in the audio. The R4 DVD is 25fps spead-up (really 24fps sped up) so you just need to slow it back down to 24fps which is what the film and BD is.

That's how I synced up the DVD and it's in ""perfect"" sync. Yours is not perfect as it wasn't done correctly, I have the Region B BD and may have a look at doing it in the future.

You can get my DVD NTSC in MKV from here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6998243/AKIRA_NTSC_5.1_Extended_Edition_DVDrip_XviD_AAC_MKV_%28Sub__Chap__"
,Danux01,2012-03-03T05:37Z,"@TubeBar
  I use eac3to to slow the R4 track from 25 to 23.976 (not 24)fps WAV, then Audacity to inject the necessary hundredths-of-a-second of silence, to maintain A/V sync. Had to delay (or advance? been a while) the track a bit, when I multiplexed it into the matroska container, to achieve inital A/V sync.
  A/V syncs up fine on all my playback equipment; a couple people have struggled with their media players, but virtually everyone finds the sync fine, TMK.
  It'd be great to see someone else put the effort into making an even higher quality copy. In hindsight, I kind of regret cropping the horizontal edges of the video to make more efficient use of the video bandwidth, it makes playback on some cards/hardware difficult. I'd recommend sticking with a width of 1920 pixels, when you walk the walk."
,TubeBar,2012-04-07T12:11Z,"Danux01 the BD frame rate is 24fps and we know that PAL is 24fps sped up to 25 so basically you could have just gown from 25 back to 24. I guess was just a little extra work the way you did it, that's all. I haven't watched your rip yet so I will take your word that the sync is on as a fan you would surely know. I agree it is very time consuming doing it. What did you use to compress the BD Video? I have never ripped a BD yet, so apperiate any suggestions. Dunno if I will get to Akira as I am sure it takes days to compress it down to a 4gb file. I will get to watching your rip as soon as I get time.

,TubeBar,2012-04-07T13:14Z,Sorry was having posting probs.
,Danux01,2012-04-08T18:19Z,"@Tubebar - It wasn't enough to just slow the track down, because it de-syncs around the 50"" mark. There are just a few extra frames of video in the BD release, compared to the DVD I used, which is why I had to open it up Audactiy and work it a little harder than usual
.
To learn about AV encoding, I suggest checking out   Doom9.net    or    Videohelp.com   , there are plenty of tutorials, examples, and forums to employ.



I don't want to see this kinda crap out of you, here, any more.
