,kasaia_forever,2010-01-15T20:26Z,"Just FYI: The torrent is chock-full of BitComet padding file fluff, tons of wasted file space that has made this torrent overly bloated.  If you're stuck in the mid to late 90's in % downloaded, check and see if your iso's are all there and usable, you may be waiting for additional BitComet padding file junk and actually be done downloading the games themselves.  I don't think this download goes to 100%, if you're at 94%+ you might actually be done."
