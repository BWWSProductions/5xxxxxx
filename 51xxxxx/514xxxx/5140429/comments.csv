Not my favorite movie but it will be nice to have all the Batman movies. 
I may have already asked but what do you have coming up?"

[T],Akamaru-,2009-10-30T20:04Z,"my internet might be down today as well, so i'll start seeding tomorrow if that is the case. "
,frenchyd252,2009-10-30T21:21Z,"Thanks for that akamaru ! theres some excellent stuff on there but im not going to join cos it takes me to long to keep a good ratio on private trackers. I think im gonna join a usenet server cos u can download as much as u want at max bandwidth and u can get pretty much any HD stuff for bout $15 a month (bout ÂŁ9), and no worrying about ratio! well worth it! I will still up here tho ;)"
,frenchyd252,2009-10-30T23:06Z,"Lol, i will still up ps3 movie rips when i can dont worry not sure no about the sopranos tho! i cant seed as fast as bricktop and akamaru tho so wont be as often, usenet is definately much better for HD stuff, private trackers piss me off and seedboxes are a waste of money n time!

change of plan nxt up will be public enemies :)"
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-30T23:50Z,frenchy did you use the 12 gig mkv thats out there to get Public Enemies??? I only ask becuase i converted that early this week but there is a lot of pixelation when it was finished so i didnt bother posting it.
,frenchyd252,2009-10-31T00:08Z,"yeh its the wiki 12gb mkv. ok rite i wont bother then havent converted yet anyway the sample looked pretty good tho, ill stick 2 predator then lol"
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-31T22:22Z,Frenchy it is totally watchable i just cant tell if the movie is supposed to look grany or if the copy is bad.
,frenchyd252,2009-11-01T00:28Z,"yeh i see wot u mean i just converted it 4 myself the original has got a grainy look 2 it anyway, but there is a bit of loss in quality looks a bit blurry in places n washed out compared to the mkv. shame its a good film"
[V],PetaFOX,2010-07-14T12:15Z,Low video quality :-(
