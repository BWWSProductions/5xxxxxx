Jimmy Carr delivers more of his cynical take on life's little absurdities in his trademark deadpan style in this live stand-up release. Jimmy unleashes his rapid-fire joke-telling and razor-sharp wit on topics ranging from religion and sex, to bullying and political correctness. Those brave enough to heckle are quickly put in their place by an array of colourful if brutal put-downs.
