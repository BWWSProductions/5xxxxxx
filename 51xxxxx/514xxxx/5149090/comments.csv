,babybluetits24,2011-06-25T05:30Z,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327850/ aka welcome to the jungle
,9seconds4u,2011-12-30T09:28Z,thank you!! you are the only one i could find who had the 'rundown' version as opposed to the 'rumble in the jungle' version! The jungle version blows...the fight scene is cut down...the whole movie seems watered down...wonder why?
,9seconds4u,2011-12-30T09:29Z,i had this dvd for a long time...but when you lend things out...they never seem to come back! lol
,Clig,2012-07-19T02:55Z,"9seconds4u - The ""Welcome to the Jungle"" version is based on the chopped up British version of the film. SEVERAL CUTS had to be made so the Brit Officials would quit whining about the violence. More info on this can be found at the IMDB link that babybluetits24 posted. Thank you."
