New band from former members Of Royal Hunt, Evil Masquerade and Pretty Maids.
On the debut album Follow the Dreamer, MISSING TIDE demonstrates how they manage to create a sound with roots in the eighties hard rock and heavy metal universe, that is still present and fresh. The eleven great songs of Follow the Dreamer are build upon heavy guitar riffs and a solid rhythm section, but with the melody hook lines in centre. Put together, 
"Follow the Dreamer" is in every way a great rock album.
