I was recommended your Korean Shaman torrents by my friend Arvind, and I must say they are wonderful. Like him I have logged in here only to thank you for these (for me) very hard to find records! I have downloaded most of them but I still have this one (Record of Changes) and 3 more to go! I have seeded all of them mostly up to 3 times the download and will continue as soon as I have them all down. Please go on seeding this one, the ????_??????_1991.10.04_DVD, The Kim Duk-Soo, and ??(??) ??? ???, Thanks for yuor very kind effort to share this!"

thank you for making this music available to the community. I've got a request for you, don't know if you can help. 

[copied and pasted from a description on a radio show back in 1997 - I've been looking for a while...]

""CD CUT 3, ""CHI AE-RI""
COMP NOT LEGIBLE (PROBABLY TRAD)
PUB NOT SPEC. NO LEGIBLE SIGN OF A PUBLISHER. CD IS MADE BY SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. LTD IN KOREA.
NICES SCO-08OCTM (FROM KOREA, NO LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR)
VARIOUS ( ""AURA KOREA"", I THINK) - I CAN MAKE NO SENSE OF ENSEMBLE NAME NOR ALBUM NAME. I'M CONFIDENT THAT ""NICES"" IS THE LABEL, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT!
9' 58""
(Korean-classical. austere yet dramatic duet for a very twangy plucked zither and double-headed drum {kayagum & changgo, respectively. suspect these are among the players, singers & dancers to be seen in Melbourne as ""Aura Korea"" at Melbourne Concert Hall, 8pm Thurs Oct 30)""

I remember the radio presenter talking about this genre of classical music for Kayagum and other instruments, the inspiration for the music came entirely from nature. Inspiring!! Any leads...?

(ok, I imagine the label/CD is impossible to find, but maybe there's more of this genre out there?)"
,iheartu,2010-03-21T15:18Z,"kaminski and fruitjam...thanks for the comments. 

kaminiski...I believe you are referring to ""gayageum sanjo"" performed by Ji Ae Ri (???). here is a link to one of her cds: http://music.cyworld.com/album.asp?aid=16475.  Sanjo is a form of virtuosic solo instrumental playing. You can download Bak Jong Son's ajaeng sanjo here: thepiratebay.org/torrent/5253420.

I'll upload some gayageum sanjo when I have a chance."
