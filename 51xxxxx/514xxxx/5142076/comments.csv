,Operation-Condor,2009-11-25T18:39Z,"have nothing to say about the torrent but 


go fuck yourself 

is a very good defense... i like to think ...lol"
[V],bob5695,2010-01-02T13:51Z,i don't know.
,lovethis,2010-01-04T04:41Z,"98 seeders and 306 leechers

Leechers - Go fuck yourself with piece of broken glass.

bob5695 - Thanks for this torrent, can't wait to get it and will make sure to seed it for a few days."
[V],bob5695,2010-01-04T04:58Z,;)
,lovethis,2010-01-04T18:52Z,"It FINALLY downloaded...took 10 hours!!!! I had a 7 GB file started at the same time that downloaded in a little under 5 hours!! That's bullshit!

Trying SEEDING people, if you haven't heard of it you shouldn't torrent stupid fuckers. At least Google seeding and educate yourselves all you leechers.

Excellent quality videos, I give the Audio and the Video each a 10/10 on all of the videos. Have absolutely NO problems with playback and HeavenlyAnarchy, there is no adware you idiot.

Thank  you very much bob5695, love these movies a lot and glad I finally have them. Keep up the good, quality work :D"
[V],bob5695,2010-01-04T21:07Z,YARRR!!! :)
,GreyZer0,2010-01-06T10:19Z,"Thanks , Please Seed !"
,Lolek_professional,2010-01-12T23:45Z,i'll check it out. thx lovethis for info
,Lolek_professional,2010-01-13T17:53Z,"V:10, simply perfect.
A:9.5, very good quality and evrything ok, but only 2 chanels stereo, could be at least 4 quadro or surround :)
And of course thers NO ANY ADAWARE. 
HeavenlyAnarchy, you should check your own system with better progrm then Avast is. Dont write nonsens again.

Thanks Bob.

What is that ""YARRR!"" mean? :)"
[V],bob5695,2010-01-13T19:14Z,"i could've kept the ac3-6ch audio but then i would have to either compress the video stream a little more (thus degrading picture quality) or present you a torrent bigger than 4.37gb (thus unsuitable for single-layer dvd burning). i made what i understood to be the best commitment between video and audio + quality and size.

YARRR!!! - this is what pirates yell when they're drunk.

c'mon, say it out loud: YAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!!!

:)"
,GrizzlyAdamz,2010-01-18T10:11Z,"hah, pirate pride, I like HAAARRRR better. I scream it at my granny and she's like SHUT UP YA LAND LUBBER! She lives on a boat.
Anywho, I have avast as well,(which incidentally is also a pretty good pirate word), and I'll see if I get the same message. "
[V],bob5695,2010-01-18T11:10Z,"in fact if you put YARRR! and HARRR! together you get that funny song from lazy town:

YARRR! HARRR!
FIDDLE-DI-DEE!
IF YOU LOVE TO SAIL THE SEA,
YOU ARE A PIRATE!"

[V],bob5695,2010-03-27T08:37Z,you're welcome.
,hatebreeder80,2010-04-14T07:44Z,"Thanks for the ul bob. Ill seed once its done downloading.

And @ lovethis...

You complain that there are more leechers than seeders, then you tell the leechers to google seeding and learn what it is. Maybe you should do the same.

A leecher is someone who is currently downloading a file. You are making it sound like every leecher is gonna hit n run. 

Sorry but I find it annoying when people say stupid shit like ""OMG! 5000 leechers and only 1 seeder? You guys are assholes."" Well guess what son, untill you have the full file downloaded yourself, you too are a leecher.

And yes, I know that you can still seed while leeching, but you can only seed what you have.

So basically, lovethis, maybe you should go fuck yourself with piece of broken glass."
[V],bob5695,2010-04-14T14:19Z,"you're welcome, dude."

Nice comment m8.

Downloading right now, I'll seed too.

We need some more european downloaders.. USA is offline now.."
,zdude123,2010-06-13T19:23Z,I highly appreciate the fact that you chose to fit this in 4.37 gigs and given the constraints chose to let the video have more bitrate rather than alloting that space for ac3 6 channel audio. Sound judgement. Downloading now. THANKS. 
[V],bob5695,2010-06-14T01:52Z,:))))))))))))))))
,theRealKarmine,2010-06-30T12:03Z,"no, he probably knows that when you use convertxtodvd...shitty ac3 cant be normalized and has to be ripped and converted to mp3 then rejoined with virtualdub.

otherwise youll have 90% of people unable to hear the damn movie not to mention their tv only has two speakers."
