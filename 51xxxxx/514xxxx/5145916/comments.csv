,ShineEyes,2009-11-03T20:35Z,"What's the difference with this ""Shop Version""? Differences from the RRoD release?"
,Marques777,2009-11-04T02:32Z,is this stealth patched or Wat morck22? please answer!!!
,briley,2009-11-04T03:49Z,any one tried it online yet?
,Bstyles,2009-11-04T08:58Z,"Yes you will still need activate iso disk as this is wave 4. You will be safe online if the disc is safe, unless you go playing this before its worldwide release date 10 Nov. Thats your own brave stupidity. If your unsure wait untill ABGX can verify it. Which wont happen until after release anyway. This version should be fine as 1. Its from Morck22  and 2. Its not the dodgy gta patched crap that has been out already. Suck a shiny knob to you noobs who thought that version would be safe and played it early and got banned. Nice up Morck"

,briley,2009-11-04T11:30Z,"muhahaha n00bs, think il risk this one when its done didnt give a fuck when odst hit a month early played that all throughout the bannings, so if they see me with another early release, cud take a banning what do you guys think?"

-.-"
,billy1989,2009-11-05T00:33Z,Ok this is NOT shop version i repeat not SHOP VERSION!!!!! this is the same release dat AiTB uploaded that is in the top 100. i changed the name and force rechecked it. And its the same file. but its working perfect and i hope its safe 2 go online on the 10th Nov. Already finish this game and this is the best game ever!!! but special ops is hard at the end. 
,billy1989,2009-11-05T00:41Z,not sure if this is stealth patched cause xdvdmullet and abgx both say uncertain due to the new wave. but mayb i have an old version of them not sure. i have xdvdmullet beta 10 and abgx 1.0.1. hope it help
,billy1989,2009-11-05T04:45Z,"@sammy6nips
im only telling u this is the same torrent as AiTB. ok it maybe patch or something but its stil the same game as the 1 in the top 100. so this cant b da retail version. download it, change the file name an force recheck it with Aitb modern warefare and they r the same."
,XeNoMv1,2009-11-05T07:03Z,das spiel lì±„uft 1 a auf der firmware 1.61 ohne die activate.iso!!!! und ist auch online sicher!!! aber immer vorsicht geboten!! ab 10ten empfohlen online zu spielen ;)
,hangeman,2009-11-05T23:01Z,I got the 1.6 firmware and I got banned today!!! Dammit!
,SpitvenoM,2009-11-06T00:05Z,"hangeman, were u playing online?
"
,billy1989,2009-11-06T14:38Z,"@everybody
MS is having a massive ban wave so u best bet is 2 wait 4 ixtreme 1.61 and if u have it dnt go online.
nobody go online. but sayin dat half u u idiots wil stil go online knowin how stupid u r. if u go online u deserve 2 b banned. teach u a lesson."
,renegade2009,2009-11-06T15:42Z,do not play this. I haven't played this game online and I got banned!!!! 
,Hackeenrek,2009-11-09T00:04Z,"This version is fine, it's stealth so yes, you can play this online. So don't listen to the people who are saying: don't play this!

i've played this release for 4 days online now without having any problems, the reason why? because in some stores they were stupid enough to sell the game before the release so m$ can't tell if you have downloaded it or if you have the legit version.

BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT M$ IS HAVING A MASSIVE BANWAVE!

The chance of getting banned is the same, it doesn't matter if you've played this release, or if you haven't played mw2 yet."
,iroll24,2010-05-16T01:08Z,"Thank you very much to the one person who is seeding, allowing me to get this game. To all you hit and run asshole, go suck a fat one!
