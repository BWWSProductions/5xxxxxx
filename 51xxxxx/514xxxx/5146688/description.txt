Damage is a 2009 action film starring Stone Cold Steve Austin. It is written by Frank Hannah and directed by Jeff King. The film is a hard-edged, bare-knuckles fight film that focuses on the tough choices people make in times of recession. The quality is very good because it is taken from a retail source. Expect to see a scene release shortly if you want to wait, but there is no need.Damage is the story of John Brickner (Steve Austin), a man recently paroled from prison, driven into the illegal world of underground fighting. Brickner attempts to renew his life on the outside amidst a world infused with degenerates, criminals and killers. With the help of slick fighting promoter Reno (Walton Goggins) and his cut person Frankie (Laura Vandervoot), Brickner soon finds himself climbing the underground ranks. The stakes escalate as Brickner puts it all on the line in a fight to the death.
