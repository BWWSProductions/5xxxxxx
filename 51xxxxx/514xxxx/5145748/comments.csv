,nemanikoi112,2009-11-04T07:37Z,"tzanev, this collection has been compiled in the last couple of years from uploads in several trackers. It was intended for uploading in Demonoid... and there would be a sincere, big Thank You to all the good dudes and gals that have uploaded the dictionaries previously. You just took it from tranz.it... and didn't even think about thanking the uploaders (some of them should still be in the file names). Very nice, pal. Even cool. :(("
[T],tzanev,2009-11-04T07:55Z,"Oops... I guess I stood on some toes here. No offence intended. Still, I don't see what the big deal is - Demonoid or Pirate Bay - they all trackers for sharing stuff like this. To me it's all the same. As for the thank you, I did mess up there. Of course, I'm thankful to everyone who took the time and effort to upload the different dictionaries. I just thought this is a nice package, containing lots of useful specialized dictionaries. Why not share it?"
,nemanikoi112,2009-11-04T10:05Z,"It's all the same - Pirate Bay or Demonoid (which is dead anyway... not for long, I hope). I just wanted to express my gratitude to all those people. Whatever..."
[T],tzanev,2009-11-27T14:52Z,This is nothing like Babylon as it does not translate anything for you. But they are highly specialized dictionaries with some very exotic terms. Hope you find them useful.
