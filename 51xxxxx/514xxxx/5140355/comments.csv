,T.a.G,2009-11-09T04:40Z,"kire310, you have no idea what you are talking about! Armin is part of a whole new generation of Trance. Without him, above and beyond, comic gate, myon and shane 54, Nic Chagall, BT, and many many others, many places would have no Trance Scene WHATSOEVER! They are what brings the clubbers together and they are what makes trance so special. IMO Florida has no trance scene at all, it's infested with faggot rappers taking about sex, money, bitches, ect...rap is horseshit...."

If you don't like the dl, then look else where and stop talking shit on CAPTIM's upload. He has took the time and effert to do this for others so get to fuck you twat.

By the way captim nice upload man.

Thanks and keep up the good work."
