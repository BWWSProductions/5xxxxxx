I've heard many of the Tchaikovsky symphonies in the different stages of Karajan's career, and you simply can't go wrong with this set that was recorded from the mid to late 70's. I think the 6th and 3rd symphonies, and probably the 5th, are just about the best that could ever be recorded. There might be a few that could come close to matching this set, but it's almost impossible to surpass these superb recordings. 




Enjoy and Seed!!
