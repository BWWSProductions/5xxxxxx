This is a bootleg album, released by Frank Zappa without enhancement, and also available as part of the Beat the Boots! box set. The performance is a live show from Stockholm recorded on August 21, 1973, with the exception of one track recorded in Sydney in July 1973. The band, featuring Jean-Luc Ponty, George Duke, and Ruth Underwood, is one of Zappa's more jazz-oriented, and the selections, including "Redunzl" and "Dupree's Paradise," are among Zappa's more involved instrumentals. Sound quality is good.

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
