If you want a real HD copy, check out my torrent @ http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5137195/Dexter.S04E05.720p.HDTV.x264-orenji ....if you want a 480p at best copy, go ahead and waste your bandwidth."
,Nugmonster,2009-10-30T05:47Z,Dude your torrent doesn't list ANY details when concerning the resolution of your torrent. So people can waste their time and GAMBLE that your upload isn't a CAM...LOL Why don't you go spread your negativity elsewhere.
,Nugmonster,2009-10-30T18:38Z,"What the fuck is you peoples problems, If you don't like the torrent, Don't Download it assholes. If you want to open your fucking mouth, Go to another torrent and keep off mine!"
,nukeZ3r0,2009-10-30T18:47Z,"Why do I need to list all the technical shit, it's a scene release.  Look at my past history of uploads and you'll see everyone is satisfied.  I don't take credit for ripping other people's shit, I just share what I've found if it's not already here.  I was just trying to get the point across that a 550MB rips of 50min show is in no way Hi-Res...and that they need to take these rips to the regular section.  Sure, .avi XVID rips are okay, if you have a bandwidth cap or a CRT TV, but this section is for Hi-Res releases.  "
