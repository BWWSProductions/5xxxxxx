,shaks786,2009-10-31T13:33Z,so 10.1 has DRM protection??
[V],Mbb15,2009-10-31T13:37Z,"******NOTE: If you get the error 0x000004C8 install the patch to an other direction, example C:\users\NAME\desktop\fmpatch
after you have installed the patch there copy the files in the fmpatch folder to C:\Program Files\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2010 after that put the crack in that folder

enjoy!"
,jord86,2009-10-31T13:58Z,"works as sweet as a nut!

thanks mbb15. top man."
,shaks786,2009-10-31T14:17Z,"if anyone already has the patch, but just needs the crack, then go here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5141915/Football_Manager_2010_10.1_Crack__[shaks786]

its the same crack provided by mbb15(thanks ;)  )"
,shaks786,2009-10-31T15:26Z,"after saving the game, FM gives a warning saying that there is no CD in the drive :(

seems like its not a full crack.."
,jord86,2009-10-31T16:00Z,"same here shaks

it still saves it from your last point, but it is a lil bit of a minor annoyance."
,nmilevski,2009-10-31T19:38Z,"The match doesn't want to start, the whole game is blocking when i start playing a match!! Anyone having that problem?? if someone knows a solution pls write"
,Thomsena,2009-10-31T20:00Z,"Crack doesen't work on my computer. It says that Football Manager can't find the CD - and it's not when i'm saving. I've just played 2 months and then i lost it all, because I had no cd. So the crack doesn't work here.."
,Thomsena,2009-10-31T20:05Z,Edit: I can see that it saves when I have to shut the game down when the message shows up - so it's just - as said - an annoying thing wich i can live with. 
,gmoujik,2009-11-01T06:20Z,"It saves the game and exits, but then when I try to load it, it cannot find disc again.

So you can save but what's the point if you cannot resume?"
,gmoujik,2009-11-01T07:36Z,"You have to uncheck ""Compress save file"" to solve the problem not being able to resume saves."
,remer94,2009-11-01T10:56Z,does the crack work on macs
,PopolVuh2,2009-11-01T11:12Z,"the crack still asks for the DVD, doesn't work"
,Maltejk,2009-11-01T13:45Z,"This might be a silly question, but how do I instal the BAT file? I cant seem to open it with ISO-buster. Do I need another program to instal the crack?"
,Maltejk,2009-11-01T13:55Z,hmm...how to open the RAR-file? 
,Maltejk,2009-11-01T14:16Z,"Got the RAR unpacked...
Got the patch installed...

But can't seem to get the crack installed. It says smt like: couldnt find saAudi2005MT.dll

Anyone?"
,leal520,2009-11-01T19:19Z,"i have the ""saving problem"" too!
after i install the crack, the game is launched, i resume my saved game, but when i save it, it asks me for the dvd!
help!!"
,leal520,2009-11-01T19:22Z,"oh! i also got the saAudi2005MT.dll error but i uninstalled the game and deleted the game files and reinstalled it and it worked ""properly"". the only problem: AFTER-SAVING ERROR!!"
,Sam_manager,2009-11-03T05:05Z,"Hey I just downloaded this and im a kid, so can someone tell me how to unpack and install this update, when i do try to install this update it says 

""you need to have the following volume to continue extraction""

And i have searched it up and it says parts of this file are missing, anyone help would love it thanks in advance!"
,Gabber88,2009-11-03T10:05Z,"Works fine with no problems, saving works. I don't know why are you morons using crack since there's no DRM. You only have to keep image mounted in DAEMON Tools."
,fabke,2009-11-03T14:14Z,"i got same problem.
i put crack. 
i don't launch game with daemon tools..but i start it from the crack.

and i can't save game, he ask dvd..

what now?"
,tonycarss,2009-11-04T00:25Z,"Hey ive never done this before so please help me. 

Ive downloaded the file to my desktop, so i open Daemon, navigate to the file Fl.M.2010.update-BAT (still in rar format because people have been saying not to unrar it in the comments above, so its still got the books piled on top for the icon) 

Then i go to my computer and click on the device i mounted it to and it says 'windows unable to read disk'

What am i doing wrong, please help!?

,naoko10,2009-11-04T07:58Z,"A friend of mine told me he can't continue playing season 2 as the game will ask for the DVD when loading the database after the 1st season is over... he uses this patch and crack.. anyone have this problem too? 

dont really wanna play the game and get stuck in 1 season only"
,bad_ip,2009-11-04T18:43Z,"Yes, after finishing 1st season the game starts asking about the cd in-game. In june 2010 sometime. So this crack is not working at all! I hope someone could make a working one."
,fabke,2009-11-04T20:38Z,"that shouldn't be a problem.
play ur game. and save it.

if u need to replace that crakc file, u can still play ur game, becuz it's saved.

the crack replace only the exe file
not the save files.. 

so play ;)"
,EmptyDK,2009-11-04T23:09Z,"omg this crap suck bigtime!!!!!! want the cd every time i want to save, and then when i open my game!!!"

,GORAN(CRO),2009-11-06T10:23Z,"Why do you need crack or patch, the game works perfectly without any serious bugs, i got mine from reladed and it works perfectly. Fm 2010 reloaded.iso torrent, its not here on piratebay but you can still find it on other sites."
,fabke,2009-11-06T23:44Z,"@ Goran

,GORAN(CRO),2009-11-07T23:47Z,"im reading all this bugs and neither one of them seem serios, exept mabe acceptance of int. job, others are bullshit and the game will always have that stupid bugs, ther will be 10 patches until Fm 2011"
,mferiksen,2009-11-12T11:13Z,"Can you play the game if you do not install this update? if not, any specific folder to install the update in?"
,Sam_manager,2009-11-14T14:32Z,"Yeah you can, this is hte patch not a big difference really, i still dont know how to install htis the steps to installing this are terrible, so fuck you pirate bay guys, FUCK YOU!"

,hyperbaric,2009-11-19T14:51Z,What was the point of the crack? I downloaded the patch regularly with no crack and it works fine.
,DHTH,2009-11-21T07:56Z,No need for crack. Mount image on daemon everytime before u play. 
,GoDSlayer21,2009-11-22T21:51Z,"To Sam_manager:Dont curse people just because u cant find the solution,and btw they are not supposed to help u idiot they just upload the files its their option to help or not "

,hjsahjsahjsa,2009-12-17T04:28Z,"what do you mean when you say mount it on Daemon? Do i have to download Daemon?
cheers"
,vanderberg,2009-12-30T17:53Z,the football manager 2010 update 2 has been released and it is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5224743/Football.Manager.2010.Update.10.2-ViTALiTY
,vanderberg,2010-01-01T13:31Z," all changes made previously (such as for the 10.1 patch) are also included in update 10.2, so you don't need to download the old patch first"
,pesmaniac,2010-01-07T05:23Z,"@vanderberg
hey man, is the 10.1.1 patch workin for u?
there are only 4 seeds for the link u've given."
,pesmaniac,2010-01-07T05:26Z,"@Sam_manager 
No one's forcin u 2 download this torrent.
please shut the fuck up."
,ksxx,2010-01-11T03:21Z,"why this doesn`t work
I can`t download the crack
is this torrent death or what???"
,Huganon,2010-01-14T19:19Z,"I keep getting a crash on the .r10 rar file. So putting the patch in doesn't work, therefore I can't get the crach to work (.dll file missing)"
,mopsus,2010-01-19T10:59Z,"so... i'll be able to play a second season with this or its like the guys said and ""the game will ask for the dvd when loading the database after the first season is over""?
only one season its not enough for me... whats the point of getting a team ready for just one season?!
(by the way, forgive me if i've killed your language. im not from an english speaker country so...) ;)"
,pyro_04,2010-02-07T15:32Z,"HELP!!!: Hey ppl, Please help me! those of u who downloaded this file, can anyone please give me any kind of information how i can have the image so that i can mount it.(i just need the image, and without downloading the full file, cause internet here is slow).

,Nlmichiej,2010-02-07T16:10Z,"@ Pyro: this is merely a patch + crack, not the entire game, so there is no image file in here."
