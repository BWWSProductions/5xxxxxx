,Uberlegen0403,2009-11-02T06:39Z,"Thanks for this. Maybe someday these asshole leechers will grow a conscience and actually seed, who knows maybe even thank you for your work. Is it too much to ask for?"

Stop your bitching about leeching and think. It takes time build up seeds after a torrent is posted. Later in the day this will probably have a 3:1 seeder to leecher ratio.

Thanks EZTV!"
