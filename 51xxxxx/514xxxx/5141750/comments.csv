WHY IS NO ONE MENTIONING THIS? "
,billy1989,2009-11-01T11:58Z,"off course cod 4 modern warfare is NOT wave 4. 
cod6: modern warfare 2 is wave 4"
,kirbyrob,2009-11-02T03:27Z,I just updated my flash to 1.61 and used the activate.iso also. I am getting a stupid update message and when I allow the update process it reboots and nothing happens. It just keeps prompting an update. What is going on with this game. Has anyone got it to work on ixtreme 1.61 benq? :?
,the_ferm,2009-11-04T17:01Z,"kirby, i had the same problem... I just plugged in the internet and ran a connection test and it prompted me for an update.  I updated then unplugged the internet and went back to the activate.iso + cod MW2 disc and everything was smooth sailing all the way through the veteran campaign"
,Bazookatier,2009-11-05T05:36Z,"@Kirby:
Why in the world are you trying to run it via internet? They are console banning(let me repeat CONSOLE BANNING) people permanently for playing games prior to the release dates. Ask anyone that played Forza 3 online before the release date and they will probably try to sell you their now LIVE-less Xbox for dirt cheap. I'm probably to late, but if you have yet to play online I would highly recommend waiting."
,pystdante,2009-11-06T01:43Z,"I played Forza 3 and Borderlands early and DID NOT get banned, If you are running iE 1.6 WITH a lite on drive, you can play early without getting banned, its if you have a Hitachi, Benq or  Samsung drive you will be banned for playing early even offline, and it is account bans, NOT console bans !!!"

,tigertje,2009-11-08T13:04Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD NEW ABGX 1.0.2 UPDATE ITS FAKE ITS GONNA GET YOU BANNED !!!!!!!

People are posting up links about the new abgx 1.0.2. Which is compatiable with wave 4 games. I repeat DONOT USE IT! IT is a mod! Its like copying a crack of a .exe which has been edited and posting it to modify the outputs of what the abgx will show when you run a eave 4 game!"
,CodNerd,2009-11-10T00:55Z,do this work fine on american xbox 360s

,biersel1978,2009-11-17T20:03Z,I chanched wave 4 to wave 2 and go online. np so far. 
,sin_city_prince,2010-05-14T07:10Z,"omg what the hell are you guys panicing about?!? ok anybody who knows about abgx360 knows that you can stealth patch it yourself if it doesn't pass automatically. some of my games that i own, failed a few stealth check passes but, all i did was patch it myself and it worked just fine. i'll even tell you how to do it in abgx360: all you need to go to is the tab that says 'MANUALLY PATCH OR EXTRACT FILES' and check the first box that says 'PATCH EVEN IF STEALTH PASSES'. everybody acts like all paranoid when the stealth check doesn't pass. if you follow those instructions you will be fine. "
,FilleX360,2010-06-25T20:30Z,Does it pass abgx360?
,FilleX360,2010-06-26T11:09Z,"Video partition does not match known data        < should have matched 4th wave>
Stealth check failed

Why in abgx360 v1.0.2"
