Tower Bloxx Deluxe 3D is a balancing style game where your goal is to stack as many â€™segmentsâ€™ on top of each other without making them fall. If you donâ€™t get it exactly center then youâ€™ll notice that the building will start to wobble(making it even harder).

The crane above that drops the segments also moves so it makes it even harder. That combined with the tower wobbling(if you donâ€™t line it up perfectly) makes it even more challenging. Itâ€™s nothing crazy hard, but it definitely makes you give the game your undivided attention(if not youâ€™ll never get a perfect). The more perfects you get in a row, the higher your bonuses will be. And it will also increase your â€˜populationâ€™ score. Lining up the segments with a balcony add an additional bonus to your population score.

Tower Bloxx Deluxe 3D looks great, and while the controls are amazingly simple(just touch the screen), itâ€™s still challenging enough to keep you playing. They also have different game modes to keep you playing. They have a quick mode, party mode, time attack, and city mode. The Build City mode is the â€˜full gameâ€™ and comes with 3 major cities, where you have to fill each city with a bunch of buildings.

The only thing that I can think of that would make this game better would be the ability to leave a game(in city mode) and it save your current game. That way next time you open the application it will ask you if you want to continue your last game. They do save your progress after the levels. . .but with it being a mobile game they should let you pick up and play anytime, anywhere.
