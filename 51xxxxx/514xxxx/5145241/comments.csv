,evilg0d,2012-03-28T07:22Z,"@ morph21: It took me all of thirty seconds to compare it to the album's listing on Amazon and as expected it is all as it should be. If you knew anything of this legendary uploader you would know better.
Once again nightissuchproximity, thank you for sharing this. I really appreciate it."
