Release Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A modern-day Frank Capra story. Jack Campbell, a successful and talented businessman, is 

happily living his single life. He has everything, or so he thinks. One day he wakes up in a 

new life where he didn't leave his college girlfriend for a London trip. He's married to 

Kate, lives in Jersey and has two kids. He, of course, desperately wants his life back for 

which he has worked 13 years for. He's president of P. K. Lassiter Investment House and not 

a tire salesman at Big Ed's. He drives a Ferrari and not a mini-van that never starts. And 

most importantly he doesn't wake up in the morning with kids jumping on the bed. After a bad 

start, day by day he's more confident in his new life and starts to see what he's been 

missing. Turns out money's good to have but that's not everything
