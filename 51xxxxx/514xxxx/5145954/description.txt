It was announced on August 27, 2009 that Bring Me the Horizon will be releasing a remixed version of Suicide Season, titled Suicide Season: Cut Up, in the UK on November 2, 2009.[1] In an interview with Rock Sound, Oliver Sykes stated that the idea came about after asking a friend to remix one of their songs, and after being very pleased with the end result the band decided to take it a step further and get the whole of Suicide Season remixed. Musicians and producers featured on the album includes Tek-One, Robot Sonic, Ben Weinman from The Dillinger Escape Plan, Outcry Collective, Lâ€™Amour La Morgue (Ian Watkins from Lostprophets), Utah Saints and Shawn Crahan from Slipknot. Sykes also stated that â€œThereâ€™s not a song on there that really sounds like the original. Whatâ€™s great though is the diversity of each song. Thereâ€™s dub-step to hip-hop, electro to drum and bassâ€
