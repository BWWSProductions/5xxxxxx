How do I burn this to disk so I don't need Daemon tools or a 'NoDisk' patch?"
,jepe666,2009-11-05T21:10Z,what is the code?
,Badfellah,2009-11-24T12:13Z,"Okey, this is what people should know!

There is no need for crack etc. But know that the game will only work for ONE SEASON. In June/July before the second season, you will not be able to play anymore. This is much like in FM 2009. They have really done a great job at protecting this game from piracy. I have to say.

It took a hell of a long time to get FM 2009 to work properly with a download. It was cracked finally with a manipulated form of registration, were you had to go through some steps to ""activate it"" through ""by phone"". And then some new patches came out, and made it even harder. All in all, I spent extremely much time on searching again and again for a working method.

It isn't worth it! FM 2009 was not a great game, it was disappointing, and not as addictive as before.

But what about FM 2010? Well, this is what I will do. I will install it and all, and play for half a season or so. If it works well on my laptop and I like it - I will buy the game. It isn't really expensive. I advise people to do the same! It isn't worth spending heck of alot time to make it work, and ditto when a patch is released!

Use this download as a ""demo"". And if you like it, buy it. The best advice you can get! (And don't forget to download the patch).

Cheers. And congrats to Sega, for really winning the piracy battle on the FM series!"
