Game Info

Half-Life is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by
Valve Software. Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a graduated
theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground
research facility, whose research and experiments into teleportation
technology have gone wrong. It was released on November 19, 1998.

Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life. It portrays the events
from the perspective of a US Marine, one of the enemy characters in the
original game. The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize
the Black Mesa Research Facility after a scientific mishap causes it to be
invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and
slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units.
It was released on November 1, 1999.

Blue Shift is the second expansion for Half-Life. You play as Barney Calhoun,

fight his way to safety. It was released on Jun 12, 2001.

Decay is the third expansion for Half-Life. Like first two expansions it
returns to the setting and timeline of the original story, albeit it portrays
the story from the viewpoint of a different set of protagonists: two female
scientists working in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Decay is a cooperative
multiplayer game, designed to be played by two people working together to
pass through the game's levels. It was released on November 14, 2001.

Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: My antivirus software detected a virus. Is this torrent virus free?

A: Some antivirus tools tend to detect file called DQ2249.ICD as malware.
   This file is the part of the Opposing Force, and it is present on the
   original disc. As for being a part of the game I didn't removed this file.

   Here is a link to the scan results:
   http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/654b8ec5f6ff27f9facb1646e48036ae

   If you are suspicious you can delete this file after the game has been
   installed, and try to play without it. But I can assure you that this
   file won't do you any harm.

Q: In one level in Half-life just after having met the marines for the first
   time I go up an elevator. It goes fine till the loading message but after
   it loads I became stuck and can't move. What should I do?

A: There are two ways to bypass this bug.

   The first one is to save your game when you became stuck.
   Then, you need to load that save and you will be able to move.

   The second one is to jump right before it starts to load so that you are
   in the air when it loads. When loading finishes you will be able to move.

Q: Why does Decay have so many bugs?

A: Decay was officially released only for Sony PlayStation 2.
   Thanks to a small group of fans, it was ported to a PC.

   Game included is the first release of Decay for PC
   and it's full of bugs, but it's playable and can be completed.

   For all the bugs you encounter, you'll need to try to
   find a way around by yourself.

Q: When I use Change Game to switch between games, 
   it crashes right after another game has started. Why?

   I don't know why, but Change Game doesn't work for me either.

   The game you are switching to is being crashed instantly,
   but I don't know what is the cause.

   But, for example, it works on my brother's computer.
   If it doesn't work for you, use shorcuts to start the game.

Black Mesa (Half-Life Remake)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am using this opporunity to inform you about the game called Black Mesa.

Black Mesa (previously known as Black Mesa: Source) is both a third-party
total conversion mod for Half-Life 2 and remake from 1998 video game
Half-Life. The ultimate goal of the mod is to recreate the original Half-Life
from the ground up, using the advanced capabilities of the Source engine,
the improved graphics quality of Half-Life 2 and enhanced character AI,
to create a new and more engrossing in-game world by introducing more varied,
complex environments and more challenging, realistic gameplay. Black Mesa
will be playable by anyone who owns any Source engine game.

More information about the game can be found on its official web-site:
