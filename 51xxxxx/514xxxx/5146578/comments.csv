,nicpic10,2009-11-26T02:42Z,"Hey, every time i try to play the game i get a ""fatal error"", ""unable to load authentication library, exiting""... can anyone help me or tell me how to fix this?"
,bloodelves88,2009-11-27T04:52Z,"I got the ""fatal error"", ""unable to load authentication library, exiting"" problem too."
,mexicano1,2009-11-28T11:53Z,Uh when I start the game it asks for a serial..I looked around but couldn't find one..do I need a crack or what?
,nicpic10,2009-11-28T16:36Z,"So, anyone know how to fix this problem"
,Eqa5cro,2009-12-01T20:15Z,"@nicpic10 & bloodelves88
I hope you will be able to sort out this problem. The game works just fine for me.

@mexicano1
Only Decay need serial, but I made the installation in a way it's entered automatically.
I wonder why it didn't work for you.
Go to the game directory, to decay folder, and run serial.exe. That should fix your problem."
,Z_XIII,2009-12-02T18:12Z,"Downloaded it. Installed it easily. Played it for a few minutes, ran flawlessly. I recommend this torrent to everyone. Thanks for the fantastic torrent Eqa5cro"
,Imaho111,2009-12-03T14:14Z,"I registered to thepiratebay just to thank Ega5cro for this AMAZING pack! 
By far the best pack i've downloaded. Superquick download (1.5MB) Supereasy install and super games.
Props to you!"
,Maarten390,2009-12-05T09:37Z,"Yeah i just installed it , played i did in the code , try to fire it up but then is says
unable to load authentication library, exiting
dang i thought it would be fun but not"
,fishcorn,2009-12-20T05:49Z,"Just wanted to say thanks to the uploader. A truly great torrent. On Vista 64 bit, it crashed on startup at first, but I just disabled Data Execution Prevention for the launcher and it worked perfectly after that."
,Dreske3,2009-12-27T22:10Z,"Great torrent, no problems at all :) .

Although you HAVE to install it in c:\Games\Half-Life, or it won't work for some reason."
,prima_facie,2010-01-08T19:36Z,How did you put the game alongwith the expansions in just 277MB..?? O_O
,Eqa5cro,2010-01-09T21:57Z,"@prima_facie
Lets just say it's a magic. :P I removed everything I thought it was unnecessary and compressed the rest with some really good compression algorithm. Made an installer and the result was a complete game including all expansions in just 276 MB. :) Similar to what Skullptura used to do, only I also made an installer. I thought this game deserve it. :)

@Dreske3
Yes, although I wasn't aware of this till now, this might be true. Never tested it in different location, but now I see I should have. :/ You can install it into alternative location, but you'll have to edit the path in properties of shortcuts in order to use them.

@fishcorn
So DEP needed to be disabled. I have no idea why, but I'm glad you find a solution. Maybe someone will find it helpful. Thanks for sharing. :)

@Maarten390
Sorry to hear that you can't play it. And also, I don't know what might be the cause of your problem. :/

@Every1_saying_thx
You are welcome. :) The story behind this torrent is I was searching for something like this but couldn't find it, so I decided to make it. And in the end made it available to the others. :) I've also done the same for Blitzkrieg (only without installer) and GTA Classics (only I didn't compress it). Unfortunately, lack of free time forced me to stop doing this.

@Every1_having_issues
It's was hard to detect problems when game was working fine for me, and 3 other computers I tested it on. But now I see that some people are having problems after all. Some have issues with serial, some with DEP, some with authentication library, and I noticed that during installation it says 'Installation in process' instead of 'progress'. :) Have fun playing, and I wish you luck in solving problems if you encounter some. Greeting from Eqa5cro, who probably won't make any more releases. But maybe, just maybe, I do. You can never know. ;)"
,HippieJoe,2010-01-17T21:32Z,"Hi, I'm new to installing games from torrents on windows. Could somebody explain how to install this game on windows XP please."
,GordonFreeman17,2010-01-19T23:40Z,"Great job dude! Took just about 5 minutes to download and some secs to install.

I'll be seeding for a week. Great torrent."
,thenakedzombie,2010-02-01T21:59Z,"Ok first of all I want to say thanks to Eqa5cro for this torrent. It downloaded and installed quickly and it works perfectly. 

Secondly, I've figured out how to fix the problem with it asking for a cd-key at startup. I had originally installed the game into the c:\games folder when it asked for the key so I uninstalled the game and then reinstalled into a folder other than the c:\games folder (i chose a folder on my desktop, but I don't think it really matters) and now it no longer asks for the key at startup."
,Eqa5cro,2010-02-03T05:18Z,"I'm sure installing it onto your desktop wasn't the reason game stopped asking for serial code.
Serial is supposed to be automatically entered during the instalation, but in case it doesn't, running serial.exe located in decay folder should solve this problem."
,TheStigAFC,2010-02-06T23:19Z,hi peeps im having an issue with the game. i install it. everything gos fine i run it but there is no sound at all. ne help would be much appreciated
,TheStigAFC,2010-02-06T23:20Z,running win7 32bit
,TheStigAFC,2010-02-06T23:40Z,never mind sorted it was nothing wrong with the game. just my idiocy. (pulled speaker wire out.) great upload
,Eqa5cro,2010-02-07T20:41Z,lol
,_ediz_,2010-02-18T15:53Z,this is fucking stupid and dont work so fuck off Eqa5cro
,Deamon124,2010-02-23T08:19Z,"It downloaded and installed quickly, but can go into any one of them and click play, select difficulty and all that it loads about 1/4 of the way then says unable to load authentication library, exiting.. and thats it. any help would be greatly appreciated. im on XP if that helps...."
,Eqa5cro,2010-02-24T00:49Z,"You are missing something that is not part of the game, but is required to play. Something like DirectX, .NET Framework, or Runtime files. But what exactly, I don't know."
,Deamon124,2010-02-24T07:46Z,"So what your saying, Eqa5cro is that i have to re-download this is hopes of getting that file or no? i just tried to Run as.... and it said Bogus length on Cd key (lol) but anyway, just answer ASAP. thanks."
,Eqa5cro,2010-02-24T21:27Z,"No. As I said, you are missing files that are not part of this game, i.e. not part of this torrent. Google for them in hope it will resolve your problem. By the way, this game can't have bogus lenght of cd key since it doesn't use one."
,Eqa5cro,2010-02-24T21:29Z,"I appologise, it does use cd-keys, but I have no idea why you get bogus lenght since there are automatically added during the installation. :/"
,Deamon124,2010-02-25T02:24Z,"what files would i have to search for? i'm new to this so bear with me, please."
,Eqa5cro,2010-02-25T07:37Z,"I told you already. Something like DirectX, .NET Framework, VB Runtimes... But what exactly, I don't know. "
,tg170889,2010-03-10T09:03Z,Works perfectly. Thanks
,dazu,2010-04-09T21:36Z,its still asking for cd key. I checked the directory under decay like you said but theres no serial.exe
,Eqa5cro,2010-05-14T03:47Z,Look at game folder or 'decay' folder... there has to be serial.exe in there.
,Invincible10001,2010-06-01T12:34Z,"Good seeders..!
& it works like a charm..!

,Invincible10001,2010-06-01T12:34Z,^^ on Windows 7 64 bit..
,Kofdeath,2010-06-07T04:36Z,"Great torrent, no problem with install, until I play the game...

On any of the games, when I click to new game, an errors pops out:

""Unable to load authentication library, Exiting...""

Probably related to Steam, but I keep mine closed when I run downloaded programs...

Any info on how to fix this?"
,Kofdeath,2010-06-07T04:39Z,"^ Equa5cro I forgot, do you have Steam installed on your PCs that run well?

Maybe it's linked to the authentication problem..."
,Kofdeath,2010-06-07T05:18Z,"Sorry for the three comments, but I found a solution:

""AND THIS IS MY SOLUTION TO GET IT WORK:
step 1. Start hl.exe (because this is MAIN console for ALL OTHER packs)
step 2. In main screen go to: ""Options""
step 3. Go to TAB: ""AUDIO"" and for quality select: ""LOW""
step 4. Then, go to tab: ""VIDEO"" and select these options:
4.1. for ""RENDERER"" either select ""D3D"" or ""SOFTWARE""
4.2. for ""DISPLAY MODE"" select: ""NORMAL""
4.3. for ""RESOLUTION"" select: ""640x480""
4.4. for ""COLOR QUALITY"" select: ""MEDIUM (16bit)""
step 5. go to tab: ""VOICE"" and UNCHECK option: ""Enable voice in this game""(because I don't have microphone and the game persistently is checking it!).
""

Then, create a game, save your game, and switch back to your preffered settings. Works for me on vista x64 family"
,Eqa5cro,2010-06-10T03:14Z,"@Kofdeath
I don't use steam. Sorry for not replying earlier.
Gz on finding solution on your own ^^. Hope others will find it helpful too. ;)"
,surveyguy84,2010-07-06T02:52Z,"@dazu

I am having the exact same issue. I downloaded this some time ago and burned the entire package on CD. I had no problem at the time playing all three games on a single processor Windows XP 32bit system. I switched to a dual core 3800 series video card Windows 7 64 bit, and during the installation it gave an error that Decay was missing serial.something. When I try to start up using hl.exe, it asks for the serial, and wont let me go past. Also worth mentioning is it tries to connect to the internet and make exceptions to my firewall. I think there may be something in the OS I'm using but I have no idea what it is. I'm going to redownload, uninstall what I've got, and uninstall Steam. Back later with more."
,surveyguy84,2010-07-06T03:25Z,"I uninstalled the previous installation, removed Steam, did not modify the default HL folder name, and ran the application as administrator. The program installed normally, works fine. Hope this helps."
,andyjew,2010-07-26T00:53Z,"The torrent works great, lags where I expect it to lag, probably due to the HD pack.
But, how am I supposed to play Decay if I can't get online or play an online game?"
,Eqa5cro,2010-07-28T21:35Z,"@andyjew
Here is a quote from the NFO:
""As for multiplayer, these games can be played over the internet through VPN,
that is using Hamachi for example. You can refear to guide I included."""
,DisneyXD,2011-04-27T22:23Z,"I got this error:

,Eqa5cro,2011-05-05T18:25Z,"@DisneyXD
The installation has a bug which will render game unplayable if you install it to custom location.
Install it to default location and it will work. Pozdrav. ;)"
,mogerzzz,2012-05-24T16:01Z,all serial.exe files have trojans how do i fix that?
