The Guard S03E02 â€“ He is Heavy, Heâ€™s My Brother

Andrew and his brother Brad go on a boat trip that goes awry; Carly learns the whereabouts of her estranged mother. 

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The broadcast was HD but because of my conversion method, it is not as high quality as scene HD releases so I have labeled it as WS instead of HDTV.

This episode aired Oct 30, 2009 on Global.
