  editing, processing and mastering, up to eight channels (7.1), including 
  eight-channel plug-ins
- Improved, more intuitive and faster user interface
- Powerful CD burning and DVD authoring software and support

Surround audio support
WaveLab 6 supports high-resolution stereo and surround formats, including all 
channel modes defined in the DVD Audio specification. WaveLab accepts surround 
plug-ins such as the Steinberg Surround Edition collection. Plus, Steinberg 
includes a set of eight-channel surround plug-ins - OctoComp, OctoX, OctoMaxx, 
and OctoVerb, as well as LFE Splitter and LFE Combiner for active bass management -
as part of the WaveLab 6 bundle. High-resolution surround support up to 
24-bit/48kHz for all six channels is available (24-bit/96 kHz 6-channel surround 
requires MLP encoding - currently not supported by WaveLab 6).

Improved, more intuitive and faster user interface
WaveLab 6's familiar user interface has become even easier to navigate, even in 
Steinberg's new functions: the new "Smart" Video Thumbnail Track for editing audio 
for video, the new DVD Menu Creator, the fast and accurate Audio Editor and more. 
WaveLab 6's brand new Audio Montage Window offers an innovative, clip-oriented 
editing system, while maintaining track-editing capability as well.

WaveLab users will find Steinberg's new DVD Audio integration extremely easy to 
use as the additional DVD-A-specific features are seamlessly integrated into the 
WaveLab 6 interface. Instead of switching to a new program, WaveLab 6 completely 
integrates DVD-Audio functionality into its familiar interface. Up to the point of 
media creation, users will follow a single, easy route when assembling and 
processing tracks.

The Audio Montage is the central workspace for editing and assembling both CDs and 
DVD-Audio in WaveLab 6. Any existing CD project can instantly be converted into a 
DVD-Audio project. If all source material is in 24-bit/88.2 or 96 kHz high-
resolution format, WaveLab 6 will create an identical DVD-Audio instantly, 
retaining the full resolution of the original master tracks. And, whether the 
DVD-Audio project contains high-resolution stereo or surround media, creating 
a portable WMA copy of the project in WaveLab 6 is only a few mouse-clicks away. 
With its user-definable data rate and variable channel formats, WMA (Windows Media 
9) is the perfect way to deliver files via email or to create media content for 
the web. 

CD burning and DVD authoring
Steinberg packs a complete DVD Audio authoring toolset, including playlist editing,
on-screen video menu design, picture slide shows, and DVD text, into WaveLab 6. 
Additional DVD functions - burning (including video data), audio extraction, 
conversion, and archiving - are quick and easy. All channel modes defined in the 
DVD Audio specification are supported, from 16-bit and 24-bit resolution with up 
to 192 kHz sampling rate. WaveLab 6 can create DVD-A disks up to "stereo, 24 bit, 
192kHz" and "6.1, 24 bit, 48kHz", and "6.1, 16 bit, 96kHz" WaveLab 6 supports 
high-resolution surround with up to 24-bit and 48 kHz for all six channels 
(24-bit/96 kHz 6-channel surround requires MLP encoding - currently not supported 
by WaveLab 6). Instant non-destructive and reversible transformation from CD 
project to DVD-A project is simple. Also supported are DVD real-time text and 
static text, still images, slideshows, and graphic menus, ISRC and UPC/EAN codes. 
With WaveLab 6 you can automatically create menus, drop in hidden "bonus" tracks, 
import and burn DVD video content ... the WaveLab 6 feature set goes on!

WaveLab 6 includes a complete Red Book CD mastering toolset, including signal 
processing, accurate PQ editing, CD text, track-sheet and CD cover layout tools 
and error detection and correction. Extended CD burning, including audio, ISO data,
and mixed-mode formats is part of WaveLab 6's tool set. Individual clips in the 
Audio Montage can be defined as CD tracks and burned directly to CD. A label editor
lets you create custom labels and CD covers. And for backup, WaveLab 6 allows 
storage of projects and data on CDs or other media.



Improvements Steinberg WaveLab 6.1.0.340:

- Podcast creator. This is a rather large feature, please refer to the addendum 
  documentation.
- Better optimizations for Intel Core 2 Duo processors.
- Batch processor: new ï¿½ Audio Injector ï¿½ plugin. This plugin allows to insert 
  an audio file before or/and after the files to process, with an optional 
  cross-fade process. The file(s) to inject must have the same number of channels 
  and sample rates as the source files, and must not be longer that 60 seconds.
- Batch processor: new ï¿½ Trimmer ï¿½ plugin. This plugin allows to cut a specific 
  time at the head or/and tail of the audio file. It can be useful when combined 
  with the Silence plugins, Fade-in/out plugins, and reverb-like plugins.
- Waves VST plugins are now supported from the Master Section (must be using the 
  latest VST shell).
- Audio Montage: it is now possible to navigate in the zoom/cursor/scroll history 
  using the more standard key shortcuts Alt+Left/Right arrow keys. Some extended 
  keyboards have dedicated keys for this. Same thing for mouse Back/Forward buttons 
  (mouses with 2 additional buttons on the side). In other words, it is possible to 
  navigate in the zoom/cursor/scroll history using the same shortcuts as eg. in 
  Microsoft internet explorer.
- Audio Montage: better display when using Control + left/right arrow (allow to 
  navigate from clip boundary to clip boundary).
- Audio Montage / Wave : Key shortcut added for << Move edit cursor to position.. >>
  : < ! >
- Key shortcut added for << Live input.. >> : < Control + Shift + I >



Bug fixes Steinberg WaveLab Studio 6.1.0.340:

- Crytal Resampler: bug fix and slightly improved quality in << Ultra >> mode.
- Burning an Audio Montage using Track effects, and with the option << Render to 
  temporary file before burning >>, had for effect to apply the track effects twice.
- CD-Text issue fixed.
- When moving a Xfade left and right the volume enveloppe points don't move anymore.
- Improved look and installation under Vista.
- Problem fixed with some plugins used with a mono file.
- Audio CD grabbing: the last audio track of a CD-Extra could not be grabbed and 
  its length was wrongly displayed.
- Opening the Live Input window while a meter window was open, caused a crash.
- Recording audio to a mono track of an Audio Montage, was systematically adding 
  a new track to the montage.
- Fixed possible problem when exporting text in Excel format (eg. Clip list).
- Audio Montage: playback can now start even if some audio peak files are being 
  built.
- Improved compatibility when saving << ulaw >> and << alaw >> audio files with a 
  WAV file header.
- In the montage "Files" tab, the file date's day and month were exchanged.
- It was not possible to erase a Montage track name.
- Batch renaming of clips and markers: the initial value of the << counter >>
  procedure was ignored.
- Useless peak files with a null size could sometimes be created for some audio 
  files.
- Auto Split: useless audio files with a null size could be created, in certain 
  cases.
- Master Section slot key commands above 3 where not selectable.
- Auto Split: in mode << Cut Head and Tail >>, the option << Insert silence at 
  start or end >> was ignored.
- Silence plugin: (batch processor). The plugin works nice correctly.
- Loudness distribution: the dB value displayed at the mouse cursor position, 
  did not take into account the AES17 preference.
- Opening a copy of an Audio Montage, would change the date of the original montage.
- Audio file path is now remembered when opening an audio file as a montage.
- Audio Montage: saving a clip will now always set the right file extension. 
- Audio Montage: the colour condition feature was not working.
- Other minor problems.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
