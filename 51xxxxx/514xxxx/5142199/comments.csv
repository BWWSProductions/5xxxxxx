When I try to open this after it is installed, the WL banner comes up for 30 seconds or so and then just disappears..... and the program app doesn't start.  JFYI, I was unhooked from the internet.       Or, does (team air) have a wavelab app (doesn't really matter how old since I'm using Nuendo 1.5.3 as my DAW software)  that works with WS 2003?"
,target007,2009-11-01T03:34Z,"perfect, thanks."
,Fito33,2009-11-04T09:17Z,"Did you fuckers actually finally broke the program??? In that chase, if I was a girl, I would most delightly suck your dick... but I'm just a guy so you only get a hug :D"
,Fito33,2009-11-04T10:50Z,"WOOOOW! you fucking guys, works good so far, I humbly bow and thank you, I use this program a lot to edit lot of shit, work as a Dj... I been having problems with H2o's latest release (5.02b...or a) I use vista ultimate... and 5.02 wont install after you update windows.... funny shit... have tryed everything, turning off firewall, Wdefender, ativirus, licensing service..

But, I don't need to worry about that no more.

Thanks again, beautiful work."

,Fito33,2009-11-05T11:54Z,"****Found and issue...*****  just made my first remastering and when I saved the changes it says I have only 20 mp3 convertions left and must buy the plugin to get unlimited mp3 saving... did I do something wrong at the install or is this just a minor ""setback""?"
,Fito33,2009-11-15T07:18Z,"No doubt about relyability m8, I missed the ""non windows firewall"" thing... should try it again then. I know I shall not update. thanks for the assistance."

[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-11-19T20:12Z,"Wrong headline!!!
This is not WaveLab 6 Studio, it's WaveLab 6!
The regular price for this package amounts 600? instead of 300? for the restricted (Studio) Version.
So it's the best WaveLab version you can get.

Thanks a million for this great upload.
It really works fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

""Installation notes:
*******************

- Disconnect internet during installation, and/or make sure to NOT let the prog 
  connect to internet (block unwanted connections by using e.g. a firewall).


English:
********

1. Run the Setup.exe (located in the Setup_Wavelab 6.1 folder).

2. Don't run WaveLab after installation and de-tick all checkboxes 
   at the finish page of the installation (remove ticks).

3. Click on OK to start the dongle emulator installation. 

4- At the end of the dongle emulator installation WaveLab will be fully working.


Done!



NOTE: - Block the program from accessing internet (with eg. a firewall)!
      - Do NOT update the program!""


I really don't use firewalls. As antivirus I use AVG and I try to surf responsibly. (Except for TPB files..) I can follow all other steps. I wonder how to do this final detail. Especially so it does not effect anything else. The last 'Note' makes it seem like this is something I need to have like this after the installation as well, as if it tries to phone home afterwards as well. Rascal program..

Help?"
,panzersiddhartha,2010-05-24T00:21Z,"So what I did was to give up and just follow the fucked up instructions to the best of my knowledge. I installed ZoneAlarm Firewall. Disconnected from the Internet, tried the installation, unticked the two boxes at the end, clicked Finnish and then all hell broke loose. (Cannot import WaterLib.dll)

http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1282/allhell.png

And of course, since it could not import this important water-thingy it shut the installation off. Woho! So now I have WaveLab files all over the place, but cannot open the software. "
