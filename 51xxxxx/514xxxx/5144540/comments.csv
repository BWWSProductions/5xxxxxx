,ZZZnipeRRR,2009-11-04T15:54Z,"How do i convert the Video_TS folder to an ISO?
I use Imgburn, but i can't convert it into an iso.

I get a error message that i really don't understand. Something about sectors and filesizes.

It's watchable, but the volume in the movie goes up and down by each chapter. Help me someone?"
,mr_pekka,2009-11-05T08:55Z,Well my friend...You cant...
,ZZZnipeRRR,2009-11-05T17:36Z,"Usually i can, but this time i can't.

I think maybe it's because there's no ""Audio_TS"" folder. There always are when i manage to convert them into Iso.
So don't tell me that i can't :P"
