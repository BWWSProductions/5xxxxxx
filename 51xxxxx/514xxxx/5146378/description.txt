Sex should be "an experience to be relished from beginning to end," says Lou Paget in How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Totally Explicit Techniques That Will Blow His Mind. Paget (a woman) aims "to empower you as a woman, heighten the intimacy of your romantic relationship, and enable you and your partner to enjoy yourselves in intense new ways." She lives up to that promise with this friendly, titillating, educational, and explicit guide to enlivening your sex life and keeping your man coming back for more. Is he a bad kisser? Learn an easy strategy to get him to kiss you just the way you like it. Does he object to using a condom? Use your mouth to put it on him (a six-step process, complete with illustrations). You'll find information you might not find anywhere else, such as dozens of explicit manual and oral techniques (many illustrated) that will drive him crazy, a comparison of different brands of lubricant for different uses (along with sexy ways to apply it), techniques for anal stimulation, and a guide to sex toys. This book is fun to read, and will certainly open up the sensuality in your relationship...
