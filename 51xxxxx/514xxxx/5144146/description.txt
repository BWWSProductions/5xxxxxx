Garmin 4 in 1 Set map for Greece - (UNLOCKED)
---------------------------------------------

The all effort belongs to a guy named "Santosan" who published this magnificent map in http://www.greekzlive.com in association with a guy named â€œX-TRAILâ€. 
This is a mirror link for all of you who wish to download this map(s) using torrent instead.

So this is a single file which contains a set of 4 maps :

1).AutoDriveHellas 1.85 (English)
2).Garmin City Navigator Europe NT 2010.10 GR Only
3).Greece-Greek Anavasis 4.2.0
4).Bluechart Atlantic 2008.5 & Tides,Marines 

All above operate in English (Latin) characters.

Santosan and me report that the set is tested and fully functional under PC version,Nokia N95 and Navigon 8110 Nuvi xxx, Sony-Symbian.The supreme package to travel in Greece.Better select 1 map at the time...not all together because the Autodrive covers the rest.
If you use other maps also rename the map to gmapprom.img.

I express my gratitude to these guys for this effort.

Copy paste this file into "Garmin" folder in your Pna or Garmin. No further crack required.

PLEASE SEED TO HELP MORE PEOPLE TO GET THIS MAP
