This is the complete studio discography of Dave Matthews Band with two bonuses -- The unofficial release "The Lillywhite Sessions" (Karmageddon Master) and Dave Matthews solo record "Some Devil". Two reasons why "Remember Two Things" and "Recently" is not in this torrent: 1. They are not really studio albums and 2. I do not have them. UPDATE: I DO have them now. Check out this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5354781
For more information on those records, check out the band's wikipedia (or any other source you find reliable enough). The only thing that is not in FLAC in this release is the four extra songs in the 2009 "Big Whiskey..." record.
