,zetty2009,2010-02-13T02:15Z,"One word to describe this upload - ABSOLUTELY STUNNING !!!

DMB is probably the best and most dynamic band on earth now and each of their composition is a treat to listen to ... you just don't get tired listening to a DMB album coz there's just so much versatility and richness in their music..

Thanks TrashTT for this awesome upload & few more thanks for uploading this in LOSSLESS format ..I could not agree more when u say "" FLAC is the way to go. Bad sound kills good music! "" ..

Cheers Mate !!!"

,suprem kite,2010-08-17T04:14Z,Thanks so much for the upload. You saved me a whole bunch of time looking for the albums individually. I prefer FLAC files and you normally can only find discographies in mp3 format for some reason. It is nice to see a FLAC discog and it is really appreciated.
