Rip of the dvd with the German Audio track pushed down to audio track 2.
I have taken the english audio from the USA VHS rip and added it as audio track 1.
Where there are extra scenes in the USA VHS rip these too have been added in. The German PAL version also has a few extended scenes (half second here and there). Where these are without dialogue I have 'borrowed' the dvd audio. Where they contain dialog they have been left silent.
