Mini City 1000 - Episode 13

The Mini is a 20th century icon and to celebrate its 50th birthday expert car trader Mike Brewer has got a major plan. Buy a cheap little run about and create a one-off, eye catching, customised Wheeler Dealers special.

Heâ€™s got up to five grand to spend in total, but first heâ€™s got to find the perfect secondhand motor. There are plenty of Minis out there, all ages and all prices. They need a car with a sound body and engine, so they can spend the money on the fun stuff that will make their car unique.

After finding the right Mini for Â£700 Mike hands it over to Edd to begin the transformation. It is left to Edd to create a celebration model Mini enthusiasts would be proud of, but can he pull it off and make the mini world proud?


Mini City 1000 - Episode 14

After spending Â£700 on a Mini City 1000 wheeler dealer Mike Brewer passed on the car to star mechanic Edd and gave him free reign to create a celebratory edition of the Mini for its 50th Birthday.

While Eddâ€™s at work on the Mini, Mike has found a great event to show it off, a 50th Birthday 3 day event at the former Mini factory in Longbridge, Birmingham and instead of advertising on the internet and trade papers he thinks they will have a better chance at auctioning the car in the events arena.

Having checked out the event and all it has to offer Mike and Edd get to work auctioning the car hoping to gain a profit after all their hard work.
