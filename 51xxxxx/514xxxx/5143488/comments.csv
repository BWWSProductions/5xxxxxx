I bought a modded Wii from a friend, and they said ""u just burn the games"" and then play, wondering if you can explain in more detail.  Im not a computer noob, but have never burned a Wii ISO before and am pretty clueless.  Thx!"

,upstreamftw,2010-12-23T10:18Z,"Should just burn it like any other image. Personally I use nero i find its quite user friendly and gets the job done flawlessly. Once you have nero installed it will prompt u like normal when u enter a blank dvd into your drive and go to start smart menu find image which is second from last on menu, browse for image select burn speed and such and your good to go :D"
