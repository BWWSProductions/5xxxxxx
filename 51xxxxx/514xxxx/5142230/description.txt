Lay it down (Christian Movie)

Posted on special request.

Best Youth film of 2002. From the producers of Mercy Streets comes a heart-pounding drama set against the world of illegal street racing! Ben and Pete Destin are extreme-living brothers on a collision course with eternity. When Ben chooses the narrow road, will Pete follow---or take a terribly wrong turn? Terrific for outreach. This is an excellent boys movie, and the salvation message showing how your life can change if you trust in Jesus is very clear.

If financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films then who will?

Please seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word & grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.
