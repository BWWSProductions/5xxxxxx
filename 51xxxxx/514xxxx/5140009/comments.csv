Please help me.

Today i just uploaded my first ever torrent on the The Piratebay.
But it is not getting any seeds.
Please check the status of my torrent.
Whats wrong with that.

I suspect that the Trackers i've mentioned in the torrent is the real problem behind it.

I'm waiting for your Kind response.
Thanx."
