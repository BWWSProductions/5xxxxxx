Live session releases from high-energy indie rock band The Kickback.

The Chicago group was heralded by Rolling Stone for â€œlean, nervy songs that snarl and snap. Guitarist Billy Yost has a marvelously agonized voice and he wrenches notes from his larynx, hurling himself against the songsâ€™ propulsive rhythms.â€

The review was published Sept. 17 on Rolling Stoneâ€™s Hype Monitor blog, a place up-and-coming bands are spotlighted.

These unique live recordings were made summer 2009 ahead of the band's move to Chicago and preview their second EP "The Great Self-Love," due later this year.
