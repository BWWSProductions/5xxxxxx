Great sound, pretty decent speed as well.

,dazul69,2010-10-05T17:08Z,"These songs are redone from their original. (i.e. Michael Jacksons Thriller is done by a woman)
I suppose it was redone like this for copyright issues. I do like it though. Kids cant tell the difference from original and this. My 4 year old is still going OOh E OO Ah Ah ting tang walla walla bing bang.
As you go through the songs you can here the same singers in the group songs (like the munsters)
Thanks uploader!"
