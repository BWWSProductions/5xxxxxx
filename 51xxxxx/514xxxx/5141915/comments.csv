,karlbeards,2009-12-13T18:33Z,"hi shaks pal, i will give this a try see what happens, then let people know what to do step by step.
Remembering what happened with fm2009 can see this being even harder than that.
it will be more than likely be well after january sales, and new patch that we will truely see a crack that is successful.

Nice to speak to you again shaks"
