,pipa_olt,2009-12-10T21:51Z,"@ tottiboi

Get Convertxtodvd from here.Folow the instructions on installing.Then add this video,some subtitles[if you want] put your blank DVD into your burner and press convert.It will take a while[ an hour...more or less] but then you will have a DVD-Video format which play on most standalone dvd players.

Hope that will help you.


@ SpikeZero :thanx 4 the comment.

@ metal4lifex : 1.you can delete the subtitle when movie has downloaded ,or
2you can choose in your player-->No subtitle.


and @ all of u : Enjoy it and seed as long as you can[want]."

this is the original file name...Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.[2009].RETAIL.DVDRIP.XVID.[Eng]-DUQA.avi so as you can see it from that dufus DUQA whos rips are basically rubbish quality "
