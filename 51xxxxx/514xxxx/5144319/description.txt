This was recorded at a Metallica concert at Sheffield arena on the 28th of February 2008. Great sound quality, it suprising how good it is for a smaller arena. You will be impressed with the sound i assure you. It was an absolute stormer of a set, in my opinion even better than the show at wembley in 07 for anyone who was there too. Metallica were Supported by Machine Head and The sword. Anyone with audio or video footage of machine head's set i would be greatfull if you sent it me! metallicamadusher@msn.com

You will not be dissapointed with Quality of audio or the Gig! The best live band iv ever seen, and iv seen some bands in my time, Korn, Slipknot, Guns n Roses, Machine Head, Children Of Bodom, KIllswitch Engage.. the list goes on.. But metallica will be the top of that list till the day i die, this gig put em up there for me.
