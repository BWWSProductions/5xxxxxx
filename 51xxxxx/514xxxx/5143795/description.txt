Naked City TV series.

SE03 EP23 - The One Marked Hot Gives Cold (1962)

"Two lost souls, 31-year-old L. Francis Childe (The Godfather's Robert Duvall) and 12-year-old Agnes Padgett, meet in Central Park and form a friendship tainted by a woman Childe spurned." (from Amazon.com)

Robert Duvall shows up frequently in Naked City TV episodes and every time an outstanding performance.  


There are 56 more episodes in my collection waiting to be added to TPB - As soon as the first four are well-seeded I'll resume adding more.
