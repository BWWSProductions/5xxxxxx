What year was this recording made?

Could you also please tell us what orchestras are playing and who is conducting in each piece? Thanks again."
,scoobydoo2u2,2009-11-01T08:34Z,"OK, I got the answer with a little googling. 

For those interested, both recordings were made in Leningrad in the late 50s. The Tchaikovsky was recorded on 24 July 1958 with Richter on piano accompanied by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Evgeny Mravinsky. The Rachmaninov was recorded on 18 February 1959 with Richter on piano accompanied by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Kurt Sanderling."
