This album opened up the world of jazz for me. It was a perfect transition from rock/funk. The guitarist, Wah Wah Watson, will get you off your booty and have you dancing. The album gave me pleasant flashbacks to the 70s police/detective shows. Lalo Schifrin's arranging is smooth usually sitting in a dorian mode and not flipping through keys. It is essential for any music lover's collection. "Fire Dance" is exactly that; it pumps with a funky groove. Wah Wah Watson's solo is magical. Wah Wah's playing has also influenced many hip hoppers. It's a real winner! ~ errolnaut

This is no classic, but I see nothing wrong in a guy the status of Dizzy Gillespie going out on a limb every once in a while. Critics hate this album because it is so out of character, especially paired with the magnificent Lalo Shifrin. Let me tell you, when you feel like a little pick-me-up, this is the CD to play. Funky rhythms blend with Dizzy's trumpet to create its own beat. Check out "Unicorn," "Free Ride," "Incantation," and "The Last Stroke of Midnight." Oh, and it's loaded with talent too. ~ Maxim
