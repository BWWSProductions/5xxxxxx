 The movie is quite accurate , and it's the closest movie made dedicated to G.A Custer
 Someone with more charisma , more personality  would had made the film excellent  "

Audio not synched - 
pretty dark during indoor shots to the point that faces are obliterated.

I cannot understand the IMDb ratings. I know that other people might like a movie that I don't, but this is pretty bad. about a 4.5 would be right."
