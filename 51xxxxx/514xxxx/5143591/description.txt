CLIENT SIDE (i.e Your own pc)
-----------------------------------------------------

Extract the Dead Before Dawn folder to Steam/SteamApps/Common/left 4 dead/left4dead/addons

Start up Left 4 Dead, in the main menu open your console and type: snd_rebuildaudiocache 
It will seem as if a map is loading, let it load, if it gets stuck on a full loading bar, 
leave it for 5 minutes before CTRL ALT DEL out of it to close it down

If you dont know how to open the console go to options, keyboard and mouse, and enable developers console. 
You can now bring the console up by pressing the tilde key (`) which is to the left of the 1 key.

KNOWN BUG - DO THIS TO AVOID IT!
--------------------

There is a known bug with a soundloop that occurs when setting zombies on fire, open the console and type this: bind g "snd_restart"
Anytime you get the soundloop bug, just tap the G key and it will stop. We apologise for this bug, but its a problem within L4D not the campaign.


SERVER SIDE
----------------------------

Extract the CONTENTS of the folder to /left4dead. Pay attention that you extracted the CONTENTS of the DeadBeforeDawn folder directly into your left4dead folder. 

INCORRECT: left4dead/DeadBeforeDawn (There must be NO DeadBeforeDawn folder, only the files and folders inside the DeadBeforeDawn folder)
CORRECT: /left4dead

If you install it to the addons folder on your server, it WILL NOT detect it.
