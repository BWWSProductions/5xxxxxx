,Sheboink,2012-01-07T11:42Z,"What are the chances of you having The Innocents tour on video? I have it on VHS (almost worn through from watching and re-watching over more than two decades), but would really love to find a DVD-sourced copy.

Any band can be ""great"" when backed by a multi-million-dollar studio - but the truly great ones shine during live performances, and Andy and Vince certainly proved themselves in that regard."
