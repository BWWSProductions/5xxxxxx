A college of me had stronghold on his mac, i used to play this on my windows XP computer back in the time. and i really wanted it. but it's not sold anymore and there was no torrent. and the only other way was buying it for effin 120 bucks. My ass! so i asked him if i could copy his original disk:) and i thought i put it out for you guys! 

Minimun system specs are: 

- G3 350Mhz or Faster
- 128Mb Ram
- 750Mb Free HD Space
- Rage 128 or better videocard
- Minimum OS 9
For multiplayer play, you must have a 500MHz G3 processor and an Internet or LAN connection.
Works on Both PPC and Intel !

Tested on OS9 OSX (10.4/10.5 and 10.6) <- :D
Works Great!!!

itÂ´s a .Toast File, you can mount it and install it but it will ask you to insert the CD. IÂ´ve Burned it on a Cd and it worked fine, if someone knows a trick to let it run without a CD Please leave a Comment!

There is also a Little Update!

Download it and Unarchive it and just install:)


My First Torrent! Leave some love:)

Note: to make this big you have to seed. my computer isn't on that much, but i try to keep it alive so everyone can go play it again:)
