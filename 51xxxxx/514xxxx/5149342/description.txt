I was a little surprised to see that nobody had put this on TPB as of yet, so Iâ€™ll do it. Props go to the box dot bz, who originally put this up. Everyone who likes British TV or Radio should definitely head over there and sign up. This torrent is exactly as posted on that site.

Monty Python - Almost The Truth - The Lawyer's Cut

Almost The Truth: The Lawyer's Cut contains brand new interviews with the five surviving Pythons: John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin with archive contributions from the late Graham Chapman. A host of others also contribute to putting the Python legacy in context including: Phil Jupitus, Bruce Dicinson, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan, Stephen Merchant, Dan Aykroyd, Nick Mason, Tim Roth, Simon Pegg, Eddie Izzard and many more. The interviews are illustrated by a generous helping of clips and classic moments from the original Flying Circus TV series, the films Monty Python & The Holy Grail, Monty Python's Life Of Brian & Monty Python's Meaning Of Life and their classic live performance at the Hollywood bowl.
