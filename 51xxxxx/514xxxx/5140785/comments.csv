I recommend getting the actual book however because the one I have atleast is annotated which greatly helps sorting out Thoreau's numerous subtle references to outside works."

Thanks liguhy for uploading.

I'm afraid to say though that the narrator isn't very good. Has a bit of a whiny voice, and tries too hard to be dramatic, when most of the time it isn't called for."
