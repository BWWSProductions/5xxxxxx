BulletBoys is an American hard rock band that were formed by vocalist Marq Torien (born Mark Maytorena), guitarist Mick Sweda, and bassist Lonnie Vencent (born Lonnie Miller) in the late 1980s after they left King Kobra. They also featured new, young rock drummer Jimmy D'Anda.

BulletBoys was formed in 1986 in Los Angeles, California. The bandâ€™s first two albums (BulletBoys and Freakshow) were well received by critics and fans alike proven by the band selling over 1 million copies worldwide. Some critics compared the band to David Lee Roth-era Van Halen, as Torien's vocal and performances were similar to Diamond Dave. That argument was furthered by the fact that Ted Templeman produced both the Roth-era Van Halen albums and the BulletBoys. In addition, both bands were signed to Warner Bros. Records.

The BulletBoys split up in 1993. Marq Torien and Lonnie Vencent continued to use the BulletBoys name and recorded Acid Monkey, a heavily alternative rock inspired album that was a major departure from the bandâ€™s usual hard rock style.

Torien started a band in Ft. Myers, Florida in 2005 called Transistor.

All original members got together to record one album in 2000 titled Greatest Hits: Burning Cats And Amputees. Marq and Lonnie released a new album, Sophie in 2003 under the BulletBoys name. This album featured a guest co-vocal performance from former Skid Row lead singer Sebastian Bach on one song.
