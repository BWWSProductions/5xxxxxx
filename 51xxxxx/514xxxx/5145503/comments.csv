Wilsy: Idiot. 
First, there's nothing about ""HD"". It states 720p. Conventional designation calls 720p ""HD"" , which is a resolution of 1280x720. ""FULL HD"" is 1080p, which is 1980x1080. 
Second, the new cinema format is not 16:9 widescreen anymore, but more like 2,35:1, which is even wider. Therefore, the resulting picture for 16:9 formats like HD and FULL HD is wider than the screen it is shown upon. Since the maximum screen pixels in breadth for a 720p HD TV is 1280p, the according height of the picture is around 540 pixels. So yes, this is HD and 720p. No, this is not FULL HD / 1080p.
Keep your ungrateful and misinformed comments to yourself."
