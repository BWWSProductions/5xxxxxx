Application description
Episode 28: Barking Spider, Crouching Pygmy
As if ghosts and zombies weren't enough, now you must battle the giant Barking Spider in the Pygmy Graveyard! You can now call the Spider by dropping the Pygmy into the web and tapping him until a spider cocoons him, and spawns baby spiders. Use the spear to battle the Spider with an all new spear-battling system... Take down the monster in as few throws as possible. It takes lots of practice, but you can do it in less than ten! Then go back and battle the T-Rex on Dinosaur Island as well. Taking down the T-Rex requires a different strategy. Thanks to Alex Parent (a.k.a. Metal Bear) for the title. It influenced us to give the Barking Spider a bit of weird literalness.

Celebrate Halloween and the 28th episode of the ORIGINAL hit, Pocket God, by purchasing our Halloween Skin Pack! This changes various items into a scarier Halloweenized version. Turn the Dodo into the SkeleDodo, or the Meteor into the Skull Rock! The Octo-statue becomes the Bat Statue! And much more!

With 28 episodes and countless features, even we forget everything that is in there! Check out our latest promo for a quick reminder:


And there will be more to come...and expect a new weather front coming soon to Pocket God! Updates are always FREE. For reviews and other info check out the Pocket Blog:


What kind of god would you be? Benevolent or vengeful? Play Pocket God and discover the answer within yourself. On a remote island, you are the all-powerful god that rules over the primitive islanders. You can bring new life, and then take it away just as quickly. Exercise your powers on the islanders. Lift them in the air, alter gravity, hit them with lightning...you're the island god! All god powers are demonstrated in Pocket God's help menu.

Pocket God is an episodic microgame for you to explore, show your friends and have fun with. We have been growing the game with the help of player suggestions! What sort of godly powers would you like to see added?
