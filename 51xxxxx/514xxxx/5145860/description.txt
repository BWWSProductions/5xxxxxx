Noam Chomsky - 'Crises and the Unipolar Moment'

Description -

"It is widely felt that the fall of the Soviet Union left a
 unipolar world, dominated by the remaining superpower, and that
 the "moment" is coming to a close with the collapse of the
 Anglo-Saxon "free market" economic model. Investigation of this
 two-decade "moment" can provide considerable insight into what
 came before, and possibilities for shaping the future."

Tuesday 27th October 2009, School of Oriental and African
