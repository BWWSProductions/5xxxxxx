,Capn_Cunt,2009-12-29T06:34Z,So change the audio track you stupid piece of shit.
,akaleeroy,2010-08-06T18:30Z,"I like your upload but - i'm sorry to break it to you - I think it's pretty obvious all good movie releases should start sporting:

1) the original audio track (in its respective language)
2) and a mandatory English subtitle

These two very basic ingredients are all that's needed for the majority of Internet users to enjoy the film. Dubbing in another language is crap, it should be forbidden. Also don't bother with subtitles in your language, post those as a bonus.

I respect the languages of the world and their speakers but English is now the de facto standard on the Internet. Adhere to it and make the world a better place for sharing movies ^_^"
,fredrikfragtore,2010-08-19T18:50Z,Isn't the obvious way to post this kind of movie to have the original audio and english subs? Seems like ppl have to be damn stupid to watch dubbed movies.
,Siddddharth,2010-08-23T17:35Z,"English SUBS! PLEASE! 
GOD DAMMIT! ENGLISH SUBS!  ! ! ! ! !"

,noorlicht,2011-03-03T19:09Z,These English subs are out of synch as all the other subs IÂ´ve tried for this movie.

,Mmatthew,2011-07-14T20:15Z,"thanks gnodde, a great film."
,iznan18,2011-08-19T17:21Z,try this subtitle. it works fine. http://www.allsubs.org/subs-download2/the-science-of-sleep-en/3240848/
,AxlVanHorn,2011-08-21T23:01Z,"Some people are lame by nature. 

now days, movies are filmed in asynchronous sound. This means that no sound is captured during filming (some times some sounds, defo no words). The actual speaking is done after on studio. 

SO, there is no actual DUMBED sh*t today. It makes no difference.

MORE ON THAT, although I am from a country raised with subtitles and consider my self lucky I could listen the real voices, we should have respect of big countries that had and still have DOUBED movies.

Cinema is a culture, how you like to watch it is your problem, and certainly its not your business how the rest of the world enjoy it.

 DUMBED it, SUB it, But make sure you SEED IT if you role in here!"
,wistfool,2011-10-24T21:07Z,"Haha! I didn't even know this movie was in French until about ten minutes into it, when I realised all the French conversations were just not stopping. This is what happens when you just download a movie from the search results without actually checking the page out. The quality is about V-8, A-9, with the additional bonus of having a 16:9 aspect ratio. 


Thank you very much for the subtitles, iznan! They seem well synchronised up until now.

I don't really care if the movie's dubbed or subbed, provided the translation's done well and the finer nuances of dialogue can come through.

The problem with dubbing is, at least from what I've seen in my own country, that the voice overs don't come close to matching the unique voice texture and accent of the actors. Ruined my experience of Pirates of the Caribbean II because of lame dubbing in Hindi. Subtitles would've worked better."
,Vynbos,2012-04-21T06:15Z,"This movie is not dubbed, it was filmed in 3 languages, English Spanish & French. The actors are multilingual. The subtitles posted by iznan18 are complete and in sync."
,gomushin,2012-06-03T15:41Z,"thanks for the eng sub, iznan18! Searched high and low but all were out of sync.
