,Vincent17601,2012-03-03T13:51Z,"So here's the deal. Because 4Kids are made up of a bunch of incompetent jerks who get their jollies off on ruining art, we never got a dubbed season 4. Mainly because 5d's came out and they wanted to jump on the bandwagon early, and also because season 4 was ""too dark"" for their tiny minds to handle. They only dubbed up to the second to last episode of season 3, and because of this, subbed episodes of the entire series are practically nonexistent, making episode 156 nothing more than a fairy tale. I've scoured most of the internet to find it, but because of all the anti-pirating laws they have here in the US, it's lucky we even find what we can. If anyone out there can get a hold of 156, seed that shit immediately. Oh, and this torrent has good quality rips."
