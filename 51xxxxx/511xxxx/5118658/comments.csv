_MAXIMUS: Problem  no game R4i!! Therefore, I asked you to or could Pactched!?"
,JacqueDillen,2009-10-21T20:27Z,"Does not work on my m3.

If I start the game, the only thing I see is. 'Saving'

Just like all the other Mario and Sonic Winter torrents"
,123sucsessxxx,2009-10-27T07:55Z,no data curupt like the others
,justaphase,2009-10-28T13:24Z,Why do people bother posting uploads they clearly haven't tested!? On a DS lite it reports data corrupt error and DOESN'T WORK.
,jragnar,2009-11-14T14:40Z,"""This file is corrupted and will be deleted"" is the warning when I try to load it. So this shit aint fully working as the uploader claims it to be. Why aint any of the Mario & sonic games at the tpb NOT working"
,BodserBrown,2009-11-27T08:44Z,"This IS working.
Tested on an acekard2i, the game fully loads, saves and plays.
Thank you Maximus"
