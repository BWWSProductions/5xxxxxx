yup, no worries. there's always someone watching at the bay 24/7. So there's no way for them to make a duplicate of any VIP or trusted user torrents."
,seos,2009-10-08T16:47Z,thx m8
,zardonaz,2009-10-09T16:27Z,"Update asks for Username and Password, even when enabler is running. I followed instructions. Is there something else I have to do?"
,azzek,2009-10-11T06:56Z,"yes, I have tried to update - invalid user name and password - EAV-19932867. How do we access new ones? Thanks"
,azzek,2009-10-11T07:38Z,"So I downloaded Eset Keyfinder here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5113690/Eset_Nod32_Keyfinder_v6.5 - and clicked on Nod Enabler and even though it said Version 3, it enabled update"
,DoDirty7,2009-10-17T22:25Z,Thanks KK.  I had to download a key finder but everything works great.  This is a big help since I am out of work.
,byrona,2009-10-30T15:53Z,"Works fine! - runs out at end of Nov 2009.....? 
I`ll carry on seeding anyways to at least 10/1 ratio - Like every one should......... 

Thanks Kentucky!"
,fuwad84,2009-11-17T10:44Z,"You silly silly boys and your key site and 'trailresets'.

Did you forget something?

WE'RE AMERICANS, WE'RE PARANOID YET LAZY.

We wish to be secure yet don't really want to do much work to achieve that goal. We want to be protected at all times and not really have to think about it.

That's why you should say Fuck all this key hunting, trialreseting and buttfucking. Download and install ma light, simple and non-intrusive NOD32 2.7. Just install, run crack, restart, update DONE!

You'll be protected for 45000 YEARS, which is a hundred times longer than this fucked up backwoods country will EVER last.

Here's the link, install it, love it and STFU.
