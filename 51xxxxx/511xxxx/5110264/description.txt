CoverSutra 2.2 final for Mac OS X 10.6

We all love music. Whether weâ€˜re browsing the Internet, editing some pictures
in Photoshop or writing the next bestseller in Pages, music is always by our side.
But isn't it annoying to switch to iTunes just to select a different song or pause playback?

CoverSutra gives you a handy and attractive way to control
iTunes without having to leave your current application.

See what's currently playing or enjoy your album artwork.
Don't let yourself be distracted from your work...
CoverSutra is never in your way but always by your side.

Keygen included.
