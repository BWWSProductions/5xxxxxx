This Beat Goes On chronicles a jukebox full of Canadian classics from Gordon Lightfoot's "Sundown" to Trooper's "Raise a Little Hell". Narrated by Jian Ghomeshi of CBC Radio's Q, the documentary is a combination of rare archival footage and candid interview clips with artists from the time such as Randy Bachman and Danny Marks, as well as interviews with current Canadian artists Serena Ryder and Sam Roberts.
