,BurritoMaker,2009-10-08T03:49Z,Thank You. I'm gonna try this out.
,EdoDodo,2009-10-08T07:28Z,BurritoMaker: You're welcome :).
,Hecubus452,2009-10-08T09:46Z,"Followed the instructions perfectly, then tried to install newest version, 1.53, and it did NOT work. 
I was asked for a serial number when opening up the app."
,ras_yo,2009-10-08T13:09Z,"The Bad Ape and mac OS 10.5/Leopard doesnt work well together. A lot of Hang-Ups, Bluescreens and so son ...
works fine with mac OS 10.4."
,EdoDodo,2009-10-08T18:13Z,"Hecubus452:

I am not quiet sure why it is not working. One thing I would advise you to do is to try installing the latest version of Application Enhancer, especially if you are on Mac OS X 10.5, because as ras_yo mentioned the older versions do tend to have some problems with OS X 10.5.

You can download the latest version here:

ras_yo:

Indeed there have been some problems reported, although I use Mac OS X 10.5 and have not had any of these problems.

However these problems are (mostly) caused by the Application Enhancer itself, and not The Bad APE.

What I would advise you and other people who have these types of issues using The Bad APE is to upgrade to the latest version of Application Enhancer.

You can download the latest version here:

If this does not solve your problems then you will probably have to look for another way of cracking your programs.



Good luck to both of you with fixing any problems you may have :)!"
,Hecubus452,2009-10-08T19:11Z,"@EdoDodo

I'm on 10.6, so that might be the problem."
,EdoDodo,2009-10-08T19:25Z,"Hecubus452:

That may very well be the problem, check under the Application Enhancer preferences (System Preferences then Application Enhancer under ""Others"").

I read on the notes for Application Enhancer that ""The APE preference pane will now state why it is disabled on Mac OS X 10.6."" but says no more about it on the website.

If there is an error that cannot be solved then I suppose we will simply have to wait for Unsanity to update Application Enhancer to improve 10.6 compatibility.

Good luck!"

Thanks for help   :o)"

You're welcome, and indeed, its a pity it doesn't work with Snow Leopard, I hope they'll release an update soon."

,deodac,2010-01-26T01:27Z,"Thank You. I'll have 10.6 and won't need the crack, but surely your effort need commendation."
,EdoDodo,2010-02-05T19:29Z,"deodac: Thanks, glad you appreciate it :)"
,iNiks,2011-11-14T00:52Z,Is there a Lion workaround for this? It says the Bad APE does not work with Os X 10.6 so.. no? :(
