,farsidius,2009-10-11T16:56Z,"Personally, I love these reposts. The originals have so many leechers that they are impossible to get any decent dl speeds. I find reposts the best way to get most new material quickly. Right now I'm dl both the original and the BOZX's repost - 
original: ~4kb/s 
BOZX: ~850kb/s. 

Go figure..."
