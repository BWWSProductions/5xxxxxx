,(un)able,2009-10-09T06:23Z,Thanks a lot Abrasax. Been waiting for someone to upload this for a while. Cheers!
,GutBombMA,2009-10-10T04:36Z,"Abrasax, great job uploading.  Just one note: I'm not sure if you're the one that imported this from the vinyl, but if you are, the first track (Boards of Canada - Seven Forty Seven) is supposed to be played at 33RPM not 45RPM like all the other songs on the records."
[T],Abrasax,2009-10-10T09:18Z,"Well I'm not the ripper to this. Saw the request, found iton a blog and uploaded it. So I really didn't know who it was supposed to sound. So the file is corrupt? Can somebody confirm that and I take it away."
,GutBombMA,2009-10-10T19:25Z,"It is definitely supposed to be slower.  I think there is a fixed version out there somewhere but I can't seem to find it.

The length of the song is supposed to be 8 minutes.  They used it on their old web site a long time ago and when playing the record at the proper speed it plays exactly the same as the background tune from their old website.

I have the records but I just don't have the proper equipment to make a quality recording with my computer."
[T],Abrasax,2009-10-10T20:40Z,"GutBombMA I've used Audacity to change the speed from 45 to 33 and uploaded it here:

Could you please confirm the it's ok! Thanks in advance. Sorry to say it came out in 128 wih no chance to change it."
,GutBombMA,2009-10-11T16:43Z,Yes this is perfect!
