,hub292929,2009-10-09T10:56Z,sir how can i play this one to ps2 can i burn this directly pls can you give an instruction thanks and advance
,demiklc,2009-10-12T12:06Z,"when i played the disc it didnt work, it said : Disc cannot be read or something like that . can u help me? i dunno what to put on the disc."
[V],Big_dude,2009-10-13T22:50Z,"Guys this will only work if your ps2 is modded with a mod-chip or if you use swap magic.

Swap magic is like a boot disc but i don't know if it works on slim ps2 I think its fat but not sure.

google swap magic buy that or try fmcb with esr patch the image google for info.

Personally I have a modbo4.0 chipped ps2 and I like going with the mod-chip least hassle free yes you have to have it done right though.

Once its probaly installed you just run the game like any other.

Oh and use dvd decrypter to burn the ps2 games
Verbatim or Tayio yuden is the best media to use and should work fine.

Hope this helps for newbies"
