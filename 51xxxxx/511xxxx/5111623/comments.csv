,skytwin,2009-10-07T13:30Z,"I played last night.
Its definitely not a run and gun so if you don't like being planning attacks and taking your time then this game isn't for you.

It takes about an hour per mission and if you play this like you'd play COD or Halo, you will die quickly.

Its good game though.  Loving it."
