Folder Lock creates encrypted storages called 'Lockers'. You can keep as many of your private files & folders in Locker and password protect it with a single click. Lockers are portable, so you can transfer, secure and backup these Lockers or keep them in USB Drives, CD/DVD, & notebooks or transfer them over email. These Lockers are undeletable on the computer where Folder Lock is installed.

 

You can create as many Lockers as you want. Different users can create different Lockers with different passwords as well. With Folder Lock, you can choose either to encrypt using 256-bit AES on-the-fly encryption or lock files, folders and drives anywhere on your computer. Each Locker can contain your encrypted files as well as your personal list of your locked items.

 

Furthermore, Folder Lock comes with additional features like hack monitoring, stealth mode, data shredding, auto protection, portable USB autoplay support, history cleaning and virtual keyboard.
