The generation of Nazis who fought during World War 2 is almost gone, their 
lives, their actions, and their crimes soon to be consigned to history 
forever.

This sense of urgency, and of time running out, underpins The Last Nazis - a landmark documentary series about surviving war criminals living in the 21st century.

It's the last chance to tell these stories, to speak to these men; to enter their worlds; and uncover the impact their existence has had on others. Through intimate and unique access, this trilogy of documentary films tells three compelling stories.

Children of the Master Race looks at the Nazis' secret breeding programme called Lebensborn, and how the surviving children have lived their lives in the knowledge that they were bred to rule the world.
