,mns504,2009-10-09T04:49Z,will this reset the trial for internet security 2009 version 16.7.2.11?
[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-09T08:51Z,"@mns504 

As described in the torrent description this reset works also for Internet Security 2009 version 16.7.2.11, but only if it's the same version as:

- Norton AntiVirus 2010 v17.0.0.136 
- Norton Internet Security 2010 v17.0.0.136 
- Norton 360 v3.5.2.11 Standard/Premier Edition"
,abobobilly,2009-10-09T09:02Z,"So which one will be better b/w 2.0 and 2.3

Any comments? :)"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-09T12:57Z,"@abobobilly

The changelog is described at the torrent description and the included Readme.txt file.

Just to make sure after my previous post: this NTR is for Norton 2010 ..... obviously."
,brianxxx,2009-10-09T18:48Z,"Who in the fuck gives this torrent -2 ratings??? RH is a solid poster and the NTR by Box! is excellent! Must be NOOB douches doing that.

Thanks for keeping this up to date here RH!"
,robzzzz,2009-10-10T06:58Z,"Works like a charm however, the old problem back in trial reset 1.4 is back.
I don't know if its just me but the norton account is popping out whenever i reset the computer.
It would be great if you can disable the norton account in the next patch.
Thanks"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-10T09:32Z,"An option with some trial resetters, eg. v1.5, is to install it (366 days) and then uninstall it again. "
,abobobilly,2009-10-10T15:35Z,"^If that is the case, why they changed the 365days to 165days subscription?

However, the 2.0 worked like a Stable version for me, Excluding the fact that the 365 days were actually a countdown and dont stay as 365. Ofcourse we can use the Trial Reset agin :)"
,manintown,2009-10-11T03:33Z,Dear Robbing Hood its an absolutely great job you are doing.We all compliment you for all your work.On the same lines could you crack (with a similar long term stable trial reset) NORTON SMARTPHONE SECURITY LATEST VERSION FOR SYMBIAN S60 OR F-SECURE MOBILE SECURITY FOR S60 DEVICES.Very many of us really need one of these.If this is not the correct place to request please excuse and transfer this post to the correct section and inform me;as I am new to this site.I really hope you will put up one of these two best smartphone security suites very soon.Please reply very soon.Thanks a lot in advance
,manintown,2009-10-11T03:51Z,"PARTICULARLY NEEDED for E90,E71,E75 smartphones.You could also email your reply to me directly.Thanks"
,prmayner,2009-10-11T04:40Z,"it worked for a day then said my trial has expired, i coulnt get into the program to change the settings it wouldnt let me, had to use norton removal tool to finally remove it, nothing would work in the program,it wanted to purge but when i clicked ok it seems like nothing happens."
,Boruts,2009-10-11T10:00Z,In this version after the restart a window is popping out to merging around Account Norton. He also sometimes jumps out during the work on the computer. Please fix.
,Boruts,2009-10-11T10:12Z,In 2.0 version everything is okay. I returned to this version. 
[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-12T23:47Z,"@manintown 

I'll take a look a t your request. Also you could try requesting it at the forum request section: http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31"
,manintown,2009-10-13T18:30Z,Dear Robbing Hood;already posted my request the same day I posted here at the place you mention.Now eagerly waiting for your torrent of one of these suites coz I know you're the only one who can do it AND do it in a manner that it works perfectly and lasts forever.ALSO I think both these suites also have the option of LIVEUPDATING updates first to the PC and then transferring them to the phone so as to save wireless data costs;instead of directly to the phone;so please do provide that.Thanks so much
,Shaamaan,2009-10-14T00:11Z,"I would just like to confirm, as some people already said, this tool does work, but if I use the nsane bit, then a rather annoying NIS activation page will pop up every time I boot my system. It's even more annoying that said page doesn't show up immediately, but rather after a few minutes (giving the user, in this case me, false hope).

I would also like to confirm that unsinstalling the tool leaves me with a countdown of 164 days, which is a lot better than 30. However, if I am allowed to complain, this is not the kind of ""fire and forget"" solution I like."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-10-15T02:51Z,"Norton TrialReset 2010 v2.5NE (nsane edition by BOX!):

,Myself,2009-10-18T06:09Z,"I downloaded 360 and I can't download other torrents now, what's the problem?"
,blitzmichael2,2009-11-01T13:57Z,"@RobbingHood
Is it true that Hacked versions of Norton 360 does not get all the Virus Definitions it need? I read a posted comment on other threads that Norton changes it updates and IMPORTANT updates are being sent to EMAIL with a link to download those important updates.. I am confused.. would someone even answer me? my email add is blitzmichael2@yahoo.com my Facebook is mjcandres@yahoo.com please respond"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-05T19:31Z,"@blitzmichael2

As far as I know you get all updates when using a cracked Norton."

,redbonesnatcher,2009-12-13T02:16Z,I cannot get norton to update.  Is there a trick to installing the trial resetter or something.  What am i doing wrong i followed the instructions.  I am running windows 7 so it should work.  I have been dealing with this for the past 3 days. someone please help. if i could get a step by step instructions i would deeply apreciate it
,Failseeders,2010-04-07T00:29Z,"Hmm... 

I downloaded this trial reset, and it worked greatly. Only problem is, everytime I go into fullscreen (Into a game), Norton pops up. Making the game minimize, and making me clikc the game again. 

How come it does this?"
