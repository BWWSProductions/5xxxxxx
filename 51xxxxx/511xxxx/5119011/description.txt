Acclaimed writer Andrew Davies turns his talents to one of Charles Dickens' most brilliant novels - arguably the greatest ever depiction of Victorian London. Fresh and imaginative, yet faithful to the original, this thrilling fast-paced adaptation is shot with a contemporary edge. 

From the fog and squalor of Victorian London to the idyllic tranquillity of rural England, Dickens' tale of tragedy, intrigue and love, and stinging satire on the English legal system, is faithfully recreated in this BBC drama series. The story closely follows the characters involved in the infamous court case of Jarndyce versus Jarndyce that relies heavily on the production of an up-to-date will in order to settle the inheritance. Three young people are taken in by the generous guardian John Jarndyce to be cared for at Bleak House while they await the outcome of the court case. Meanwhile a ruthless lawyer is determined to find out the truth surrounding the Lady Dedlock's mysterious past and after deep investigation he makes a discovery that changes all their lives. Includes all fifteen episodes.
