John Mortimer - The Summer of a Dormouse - BBC Radio Drama



A new play for radio by the creator of Rumpole of the Bailey. A melancholic but amusing portrait of lifes disappointments and missed opportunities.

Does it all, in the end, amount to so little - in the words of Byron - to "the summer of a dormouse"? 

A dream cast is led by Paul Scofield.
