I take this time to thank you for all you do for us.  The drive-by media is looking in the rear view mirror.  I for one am watching with rapt attention their slow-motion car wreck.
Your friend in freedom."

The other fool in a pantsuit, you know, what's his name, has to recharge his three wheel electro-gm car (aka battery powered tricycle).  After bowing in front of his holographic TOTUS poster and asking for absolution for his carbon footprint, squeezing in a quick two-minute hate.  They will cartwheel into the comment room.
I will place a tack on their seats (don't tell, it would ruin the susprise)."
