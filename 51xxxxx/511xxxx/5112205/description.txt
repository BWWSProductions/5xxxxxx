Since this is somewhat of a special release I'd like to post more information.
I tried to find a release of this movie, but all the releases I found had LB 4:3.
As this is insanely annoying to watch on a widescreen TV, I decided to download a NTSC DVD I found(Thanks to whoever UL that btw). This also had the LB 4:3 as I expected. So, I used DVD-Rebuilder which has a option to convert LB 4:3 to 16:9.
This did require a full re-encode of the DVD. So after that, the quality always suffers a little bit. After that, I went by my standard procedure and encoded it with Gknot. So, other releases on the web is sure to have a little bit better quality than this, but this is the only one that is 16:9. Don't get me wrong though, the quality is very good :)

For those who don't know, LB 4:3 is a widescreen picture encoded in the 4:3 standard. On a widescreen TV, this will basically have huge borders on ALL sides of the movie.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you'll enjoy this awesome movie :)
