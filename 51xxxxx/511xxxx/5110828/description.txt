Rain on Me is a single released by R&B singer Ashanti in 2003 from her second album Chapter II.

In the video Ashanti plays a superstar abused by a jealous boyfriend, played by actor Larenz Tate. The video was released on August 28, 2003. The video was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and directed by Hype Williams. It contains a sample of "The Look Of Love" by Isaac Hayes.
