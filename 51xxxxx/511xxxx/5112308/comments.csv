,saluqi,2009-10-07T05:03Z,Thanks xNZx--you saved me a lot of time--downloading torrents is slow were I come from.
,pratap5233,2009-10-07T10:11Z,Seed please...
,NaRu7o,2009-10-07T11:46Z,"it is ep 4. the first is actually 2 in 1 so ""s06e02"" is really s06e03"
,thymeline,2009-10-07T12:21Z,"Ep 3 is ""Epic fail"", this must be Ep4. Thanks!"
,Charlie14,2009-10-07T13:18Z,ep 3 is just being aired. I am doupting this is real. any one to confirm please?
,domdomtom,2009-10-08T12:56Z,Are these episode numbers going to be fucked up til' the end of the season?  Can we get someone to fix them please?  Episode 1 was basically just a double so just call it episode 1 and go from there.  Therefore this episode 4 should actually be labeled episode 3.

,masterac,2009-10-11T01:38Z,"okay all of you who think this is episode 4
SHUT UP
and go to the doctor house official site to see

http://www.fox.com/house/index.htm

and.....o SURPRISE this is....EPISODE 3
and you can see epic fail is episode 2,and then if you think it's not true....or not possible,well then you can go buy a new brain because your eye doesn't send the correct info.

or you can deplug from the matrix and enter the real world.

have a nice day "
,Abomity,2009-10-11T23:15Z,"The first 2 episodes was aired as a ""two hour premiere"" in American but as two ""separate"" episodes in other countries like the United Kingdom.

This is ""The Tyrant"" weather it is nr 3 or 4.

I think this episode should be seen as nr 3 since Imdb says so, and because it's an american show and and the 2 first EP's was shown as one 2-hour special in the US.

We will just have to see what number the ""known"" uploaders here and on mininova will name the NEXT episode (instant Karma).

But REALITY is that this episode IS nr 3. Realize it and get over yourselves!"

It's episode 3...because FOX...the tv station airing the shows.. says it is...check their site...

That's THE source...not wiki...or tv guide...or imdb, though, I know they're just so close to our hearts that we can't help but getting warm & fuzzy running into their arms...

And yes...I watch too much House..."
