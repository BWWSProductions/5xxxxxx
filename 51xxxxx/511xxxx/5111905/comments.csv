,bunnypup,2012-01-28T08:06Z,"Looks like mirasoft discontinued BluePhone in 2010.  Not surprising, as this is 2012 and you know know how software companies come and go.  There is a company that stepped up and offered support (and new software) for his old customer base -- iz a software package called ""Phone Amega."" Haven't found a torrent yet to try it out, so dunno how well it stacks up to the older BluePhone.  It's probably better, as there has been 2 more years of developmentâ€¦
