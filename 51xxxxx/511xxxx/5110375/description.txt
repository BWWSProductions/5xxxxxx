Trailer Park Boys 2 Countdown To Liquor Day
N2KMaster Re-Workz Version DVD ISO

Convert,mount,burn etc with PowerISO, tested working ISO Image burnt 3 copies, tested 3 seperate DVD players, includes all the fixes listed below and added a DVD menu for the beginning.

Tried removing the red url at the top of the video and tried to replace splash screen
===============================================================================
The result is the best i could get, slight blurred box there, the second revision of this may remove it, ill attempt
 another try at removing it. I had to remove the site, i dont care who ran it, its polluted, my antivirus went bonkers 
just sitting idle just buffering so i will not recommend this site, nor will i endorse a site that puts their url there 
of all places in the video. I mean a watermark is supposed to be on the outside edge, not 2 inches from the top
of the screen the whole time.

Color Fixes
===========
Looks more like a TV/VCR rip now not a cam version, color looks healthier, Im not gonna brag or nothing never really
tried to clean up a cam this quickly before lol, so consider yourselves lucky.


Sharpness Levels Adjustment
===========================
Slightly sharpened up everything a scooch, looks a bit better and allowed for the next change
I wanted to sharpen it up further but it just started showing the pixels really bad.

Resolution Increased
====================
Increased it from 320x240 to 800x600 to allow for a slightly better picture, i hope. Still can remove the slight
"pixelated" from the version that the handheld was, Im hoping the next version comes up a little cleaner. Im not
sure what the maximum is that i can rescale it, ill keep you all posted.

Audio fixed and semi cleaned
============================
Still working with this, should be able to get it even better after a few more passes. Kinda cranked up quality a 
little bit, its gonna take a little bit of work with an audio cleaner to fix it up. Went from 22,000Khz to 48,100Khz
Doesnt sound a whole lot better but bassier stuff isn't so murmered now. Ie Lahey's drunk speils.....

Im guessing as well this is gonna be the best for now until a dvd-screener is leaked or a workprint shows its head or it ends
up on DVD. I ve spent almost 2 full days from dawn to dusk to clean it up, but I can only go so far with it and i mean it is 
a cam, but not the worst ive seen, and to have a cleaned version out this early is pretty sweet, specially by the original 
guy who uploaded the original copies that other torrent sites are trying to steal and claim as their own.

Remember true Pirates know, whats yours is ours and whats ours is up for sale :P
Toodles!
