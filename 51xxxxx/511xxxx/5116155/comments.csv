I found something wierd in the read me file. If u scrol down a bi it says: The Game.

,StormDewleaf,2010-08-04T19:34Z,"If you think this torrent is awesome, you either didn't watch very far into Battle City or you're on something. The subs are fine at the beginning, but starting sometime around the end of Duelist Kingdom slowly get worse and worse until they're downright fucked up.

How does getting it wrong not matter? It's an English sub and whoever subbed it got ENGLISH words screwed up. (In one episode, the subs called the Dark Magician the Blue Eyes White Dragon instead. WTF??)

I briefly previewed a few episodes later on and I think the subs revert back to normal when it gets to the Doma arc. But most of Battle City is downright unwatchable due to the god-awful subs. I only knew what was going on half the time due to having seen the entire series in English, being a strong fan of the show for almost ten years, and understanding a few words and phrases of Japanese enough to know what was being said.

This torrent sucks."
,QuickMana,2010-08-20T09:00Z,"Have to agree with StormDewleaf, I noticed at the Duel Monsters Quest, and Dungeon Dice Monsters the subs seriously got annoying. I am not at BattleCity so I can't say how bad it is there but the past 6 eps have had slight errors and mistakes that seriously piss me off. The Duelist Kingdom was awesome so its a shame that it had to go down that way."
,XxBranikanxX,2010-09-18T18:24Z,"well its better then nothing, better then the english version i must say....."
,Otaku_X,2010-12-30T16:36Z,"After the first 42 or so episodes, half the characters get subbed with weird names. Yugi and Kaiba were fine, but Jounouchi, Honda, and Anzu all had weird names."
,Rofl_old_lady,2011-03-08T23:44Z,Well 1+ is that it's good speed. im downloading at 7mb/s o.o
,Grominator,2011-03-19T03:17Z,Is this the uncut Japanese version?
,SeireiKT,2011-03-24T23:30Z,"The subs never return to normal. The Doma episodes have awful subs, sometimes the names from the dubbed version are used instead, sometimes they're completely made up names. It doesn't make me any less willing to watch them since I've wanted to see the entire Yu-Gi-Oh series in Japanese for some time now, but it definitely ruins the experience. However, under ""Texted Language(s)"" in the torrent information, I'd definitely change it to ""Engrish"" if such a thing is possible since even clearly spoken English words are subbed incorrectly. Not only did whoever sub this not speak English very well, they most likely did not speak Japanese either and just made up random crap based on the Dub. Thank you for uploading these episodes though, despite every single fault I've mentioned, they're still 100x better than the Dub."
,SukiRios,2012-01-08T08:22Z,"the thing is, previous commenters, these are the HK subs. meaning that the japanese was translated to chinese first then translated to english. the ""HK"" stands for ""Hong-Kong"" with dual translating, of course things are going to be squirrley. I find them rather entertaining actually. If you know the english dub almost by heart, it makes it funnier"
,OnePiecePirate,2012-03-24T11:26Z,"What about the quality of the videos? Regarding the subbing, is it hard subbed or not?"
,PandoraDay,2012-04-09T12:54Z,"@OnePiecePirate

Hello bro! Well, The quality is DVD-Rip, and all the episodes have Hard Subs.

About the subbing: å¤šDoes anyone knows a trusted source where I can download a trusted-translated subs for this anime?"
,Pow19,2012-04-10T06:02Z,Does this include the movie? Cuz that is all I want.
