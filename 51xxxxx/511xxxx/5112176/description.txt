Autopsy (U.S.) - Tortured Moans Of Agony - 1998 - (live recording from 1993)

2 x 7" bootleg
this is off the red wax & violet - I've seen orange & blue version as well

on the cover there's mistakenly track (nr.9 "spinal extractions")not listed - you may think its part of previous ("dead") track but there's "fleshcrawl - torn from the womb" separately listed but are one continuous track

full of fuckups and quality sucks big time but that's not the point here...
