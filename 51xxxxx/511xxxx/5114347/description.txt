A note by the publisher:

I've done great work in cutting this book by chapters - somewhere else on the web you can find only a lumped version.


A fight against pseudo-science is held by many scientists of the 20th century. In this book, Carl Sagan Sagan provides a skeptical analysis of several kinds of superstition, fraud, pseudoscience and religious beliefs, such as gods, witches, UFOs and faith healing. However, based on "some experimental support," Sagan calls for serious scrutiny of a handful of seemingly inexplicable phenomena such as reincarnation and psychokinesis, not because he regards them as likely to be true, but because anomalous data deserves close scientific study.


Duration - 14.5 hours.
