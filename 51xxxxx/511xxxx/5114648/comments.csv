I was already answering in a previous comment, I put it here again.

I've never seen before this virus, but googling around it shows between other this page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohmini.A where it gives some infos removing it. If it doesn't work maybe running a system scan starting from a bootable CD with some AVs on it like BartPE or some directly built up from AV makers will help to get rid of it.
My personal way to handle it is to make a Ghost copy of my system when I've configured and installed everything I need, and save it somewhere (CD, DVD and Backup HD, and if something nasty happens to my PC go back to this previous backup. And if I update or add something new make a new backup to keep with the other for the bad times. It's a lot easier to restore a previous backup than go fighting around to get rid of nasties. But for doing it you should start from a fresh and clean installation... "
