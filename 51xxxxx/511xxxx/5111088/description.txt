Blankets is a autobiographical graphic novel by Craig Thompson, published in 2003 by Top Shelf Productions.  As a coming-of-age autobiography, the book tells the story of Thompson's childhood in an Evangelical Christian family, his first love, and his early adulthood.  Thompson has said that the novel grew out of a simple idea: to describe what it feels like to sleep next to someone for the first time. 

Time magazine named Blankets as one of the Top Ten Graphic Novels of All Time.
