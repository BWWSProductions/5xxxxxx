Here is the leaked beta copy of PvE Bible. The worlds most comprehensive World of Warcraft Guide that shows the blue print to complete domination.

  The PvE Bible isnâ€™t another fluff filled, detail fuzzy guide  that is cobbled together from random strategies that donâ€™t work. This guide is written by a guy who really wanted to get better and was willing to do anything in his power to make that happen. I practiced every day, writing down every strategy, recording gameplan videos to see how I did. I looked up bosses, watchedruns, and talked to players who had beaten a boss before me (there werenâ€™t many). I did my research and it was a lot of hard work.

 

The end result though is a guide that can show you EXACTLY what it takes to slice through every single boss in Northrend as though youâ€™d done it a thousand times. This isnâ€™t just raid strategies, this is the most complete, most well rounded instance guide youâ€™ll even find â€“ that was my goal and thatâ€™s what I wrote.
