,djbiggins,2009-10-06T21:10Z,"this smells like a fake to me, how come there are screenshots of whats supposed be the film, but includes random pics of the cast and crew hmmmmmmm, i always thought that screen shots meant that they were screenshots from the actual film thats been uploaded, maybe things have changed over night and ive become totally clueless and stupid, i dont know, why am i here anyway"

,only1alive,2009-10-07T01:48Z,"I love the website spammers that claim they DL'ed the Movie and are ""watching it right now"" but incidentally... ""here's a website that has the same quality and you don't have to DL...""

My question is: Why DL the movie to begin with if you have a ""Great site"" to watch it right now?"

,3reathmint,2009-10-10T00:48Z,"sample was great quality on PC, so there should be minimal pixelation on my 360. good DL speed, at 250k, but i doubt it will stay that high. lol I was right, I just checked, it dropped below 200kb/s. Hope it gets done soon.

Anyway, I reccommend this above the other torrents, this one is definitly best quality if you ask me, or atleast the one with the best A quality to match the amazing cam video"
