Thanks in advance
H-D"
,exateit,2009-10-12T12:00Z,"Download TS Remuxer.  You can select convert to Bluray format.

Also another brilliant program is BD Rebuilder - this shrinks 50GB sized blurays so that they then fit onto 25GB blank bluray disks and the quality is really good.  Its a bit like DVD Shrink, but for blurays.

Hope that helps."
,exateit,2009-10-12T12:03Z,Also you need to use ImageBurn (program) to burn you final encoded files to bluray...it creates the Certificate file as you see in the bluray file structure...just use it you will see what i mean.
,exateit,2009-10-12T12:05Z,And use AnyDVD HD by slysoft to remove the copy protection when copying blurays etc....thats should be a start!

If you do, I'll look forward to it! :)..."
