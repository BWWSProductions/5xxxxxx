The video has been extensively colour corrected to removed the terrible colouring in the DVD & HD transfers. The original video had a terrible pink tint to it which made most of the skies and clouds purple and all the Tatooine scenes pink. The colour has been returned to the closest match possible  to what it originally looked like in the cinemas
