On the heels of winning 25 international gaming awards with FIFA 09, the top-selling football franchise from EA Sports is surpassed with FIFA 2010. Responding to consumer feedback, FIFA 10 refines the game, focusing on what matters most to fans.

On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA 2010 mirrors real-world football, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction.

On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options.

On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA 2010.
