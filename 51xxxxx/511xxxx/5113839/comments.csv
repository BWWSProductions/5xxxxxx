,RETXEDTAGNOB,2010-01-13T09:11Z,MAY I KNOW IF IT IS A TRIAL VERSION?
,awolfman,2010-01-15T11:07Z,"Hey guys,

i see a lot of people are having trouble with nero 9.

1. Just download nero 9.4.26 trial version and execute the file.

2. It will come up with a text box and a demo serial key. DELETE the key and paste this 
9M03-01A5-0WA4-5TAA-KA2P-8WZ5-CLA7-6122

3. Proceed with the installation, its very slow

4. After installation, go to Start>Nero>Nero Control Center 4

5. On the left side, click on license, there you have it, it shows expiration NONE.

I found this key at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5280328/Nero_9_full_version_license_retail_by_ebookking.

P.S. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN ANTIVIRUS cause most people are getting viruses. Its not uncommon to get a virus from a keygen

Thank you and please pass on this info to others having trouble.

Oh and thanks for uploading"
