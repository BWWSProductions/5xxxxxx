,acidr3flux,2009-12-13T08:27Z,thank you for this upload. Its the only one on TPB of it's kind. I wish there was more. There are a few songs I heard in season 2 that I would love to have but can't figure it out. I guess it's back to the grind. THANK YOU THOUGH

,mizzllat,2011-01-28T23:21Z,"NOTE to Miniver:  The song BURN THIS TOWN can be found on the Season 2 soundtrack.  You can locate this on BtJunkie under the following foreign title:

OST. Ð”ÐµÑ‚Ð¸ ÐÐ½Ð°Ñ€Ñ…Ð¸Ð¸ (Ð¡ÐµÐ·Ð¾Ð½ 2)

That title has only recently been appended so that the English translation now follows it:

 Sons Of Anarchy (Season 2) (2009) MP3

Using this translation, you ought now be able to locate the song."
