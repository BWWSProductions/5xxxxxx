COMMENT : Hard Bass, the legendary hardstyle concept of b2s, took place 

          on the 14th of February 2009 and was bigger than ever! For the 

          first time Hard Bass stroke down at the Gelredome stadium in

          Arnhem. Thousands of hardstyle lovers gathered in the massive

          dome and were presented with the pounding beats of four top 

          notch DJ teams who combined their outstanding skills and perfect

          record choice into a mind-blowing result.


          The four teams, known as Green, Blue, Yellow and Red, more than

          lived up to expectations; they rocked, and they rocked hard! From

          22:00 PM till 07:00 in the morning it was one big and amazing event
 
          with the best in hardstyle music, laser & video shows and fireworks.
 
          And not be forgotten, the massive, spectacular and highly impressive

          LED wall (which had never been seen before on any event in the history
 
          dance music)!



          Enjoy!
