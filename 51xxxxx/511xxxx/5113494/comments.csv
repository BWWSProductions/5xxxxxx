,clasculf,2009-10-08T16:16Z,I dont have any more Rollin movies and not Bava's The Ogre. I am going to upload Demons & Demons 2 by Bava soon. They are true classics : ) 
,avicenna,2010-01-06T16:51Z,"hey classiccultflicks, how's it going?  It's great to see someone new picking up the mantle that me, Garbo, Mondo, and others have left behind and offering great classics up on a public tracker, 

and we keep hearing that PirateBay is done for good, but it lives on, 

a lot of people put this film down but I love it
it's a lot of fun just have to be in the right mood, "
