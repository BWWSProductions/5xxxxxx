check that against yours and maybe cut and paste and it will work."
,BaronFat,2009-10-07T00:08Z,"Thank you polisdavid,
I strictly followed your advice but the app still does not start.
""Show package contents"" shows an emtpy app-icon . . .
may I have a downloadproblem?"
[V],polisdavid,2009-10-07T01:28Z,"Hello BaronFat,

I just checked the torrent and the app DOES have content, so just try downloading again.  It's not that big a file."
,markoekv,2009-10-07T15:36Z,You suck. It doesn't open. And because it overwrites old application now I don't have Photozoom Pro anymore...NOW FIX IT !!!!
,chmod_775,2009-10-07T16:17Z,"Works fine, many thanks !! as usual just ignore ungrateful  idiots who can only complain"
,markoekv,2009-10-07T17:59Z,"chmod, why do you speak for polisdavid ? Are you his sister? No ? IT DOESN'T WORK PERIOD. FIX IT !!!!"
,BaronFat,2009-10-07T19:31Z,"May be I'm an idiot too, but after 2 new downloads it still doesn't open :-((

By the way markoekv, some older people once upon a time told me to backup before installing somethin new . . .

However polisdavid thanks for all your great uploads !!!"
[V],polisdavid,2009-10-07T22:57Z,"markoekv - YOU suck! Find your own files from now on, and don't download mine.

By the way mine works perfectly, and over 1100 people have downloaded it, and I haven't heard from them.

Do the plugin's work? - that's all you really need - Ahole."
[V],polisdavid,2009-10-07T23:34Z,"If you need to go back to Photozoom Pro v3 here's the link:

,markoekv,2009-10-08T01:59Z,"polisdavid, you should take responsibility for uploading broken files. And you don't. You call me asshole. Now, that really sucks. BaronFat, I know that but tell me did you make backup of your app before installing broken one...? Who in real world does? No, seriously. So it's about etiquette. Nevertheless, polisdavid posted link to old version, that cuts his blame to half, I think I shook him a little and he came out good. Seems we are not assholes."
,xksmh,2009-10-08T02:39Z,"Same problem as Baron Fat. downloaded twice. Tried on 2 macs. doesnt open as a standalone or with plugins. adding files to prefs makes no difference. thanks for the link for the earlier version, shall try that one"
,BaronFat,2009-10-08T13:16Z,"Pro 3.0 works fine, but does not give the quality that 3.0.4 does (I tried the demo)
markoekv, believe it or not, SuperDuper runs dayli !"
[V],polisdavid,2009-10-08T18:46Z,"Perhaps the 3.0.4 version has a problem with 10.5, 10.6, or the intel prossesor.

Sorry for the screwup, but I run a PPC Mac, and it worked fine here.

No fix - I don't know how to do it - if someone does, please post it and I would be appreciative."
,maxycatz,2009-10-11T01:49Z,"I was experiencing the same issue as some of the above with the application not launching.  I resolved this by changing the file type of PhotoZoom Pro3.app/Contents/MacOS/PhotoZoom Pro 3 from a text file (?) to a Unix Executable via terminal i.e. chmod +x
Hope this helps others."
,BaronFat,2009-10-11T02:25Z,"Found it on
mac-torrents
com"
,BaronFat,2009-10-11T02:28Z,"Sorry . . .

,BaronFat,2009-10-11T02:30Z,"Sorry . . . look at
