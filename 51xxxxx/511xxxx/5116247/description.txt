A powerful tool for system migration!

Paragon Virtualization Manager is a powerful tool to help you easily migrate a Windows-based computer to a virtual environment (P2V) of a major virtualization software vendor, regardless of how or where the computer is being backed up.

It also makes a crippled system, previously transferred to virtual hardware by a third party tool, 100% bootable.

    * Continue using your old PCâ€™s applications. Enjoy your favorite applications in a virtual environment on your new computer.
      When itâ€™s time to upgrade to a new PC with a new operating system, you may find that some of your favorite applications havenâ€™t been updated yet to work with your new computer. Using Paragonâ€™s Virtualization Manager 2009, you can migrate to a new computer and make a virtual clone of your old system. Take advantage of an up-to-date powerful computer while still having access to favorite applications from the old computer.
    * Safely Evaluate New Software
      New software can be unintentionally harmful to your computer. You can easily avoid negative system conflicts by creating a virtual clone of your current physical system using Virtualization Manager 2009. Try new software in a safe environment and decide whether it works and is exactly what you need before making it a permanent addition to your collection.
    * Virtualization for Backup Purposes
      Creating a virtual clone of your physical system and saving it to the network is a good alternative to traditional disk imaging. In case of hardware failure, you can still work with your applications in a virtual environment from any other computer until your own PC is repaired â€“ a solution that traditional backup software canâ€™t help you with.
    * Multiple Operating Systems on One Computer
      Virtualization makes it possible to install and run several completely incompatible operating systems on one computer, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (only as host-operating system).

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
