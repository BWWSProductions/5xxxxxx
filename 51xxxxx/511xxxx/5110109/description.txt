Ali Ardekani is the co-founder (along with Mahdi Ahmad) of UmmahFilms, a Muslm film company that has produced a web series including the "Reminder" series and "Ask Baba Ali" series.

Although born into an American Muslim family, Baba Ali claims he was raised in a secular Iranian family in America. Baba Ali said in one of his interviews that the only one that used to pray in his family was his grandmother, but that he thought it was a cultural thing to do. He says he reverted to Islam when he was 20 years old after attending a Muslim event.
