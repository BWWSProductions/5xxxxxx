,rigorkrad,2009-10-07T13:43Z,"zipx was a bummer

but check out john cena dropping his blade during his match. as soon as jerry awler says cobra u can see cena drop his cutting device and the ref puts it in his pocket. pretty obvious"
,kenbryson,2009-10-07T18:51Z,What can you play it with?
,brockmanfla,2009-10-08T05:09Z,"hmm the reason i put in in zip file was that i had a few files and pb was acting up wouldn't let me upload them all.. i was trying to get it up asap.  

so the fastest way was to zip it and upload.  i have already upload 89 gigs on this  file but the ones with 100% are not seeding  i have  30 99%  been running for 4 days  str8.  

so i am a dork and a idiot.  was trying to share... and return the favor to many. 

suppose i can remove it. "
,brockmanfla,2009-10-08T05:11Z,"you can either burn it to disk by adding the  4 files to nero/alcohol or other burn disk methods.

or you can play each individual files on wmw flv etc.  it is dvr format.
"
,brockmanfla,2009-10-08T05:12Z,sorry for the delayed response  i havent been able to access tpb since sunday night.  i guess it came  back up some point today.
