,michaelrwatson,2009-10-09T05:16Z,"WARNING: AUDIO SUCKS GIGANTIC COCK!!!!  This is CAM audio, combined with DVD video. Pretty sick. The audio is recompressed too, so it has that metallic-squishy-reverb to it, as well as being out of sync and unitelligible. My Gawd. 

Why even create an abomination like this? Why not just wait for the friggin DVD release? This is internet pollution. "
,canefanus,2009-12-04T08:00Z,Audio is incredibly annoying. Video isn't all that bad but the audio makes it unwatcheable
