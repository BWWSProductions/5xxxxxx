,cizco8888,2009-10-10T20:50Z,why do I get a blank screen after codemasters intro??

HELP ME!"
,fx5300,2009-10-13T06:35Z,"Thanks guys, no problems here, game works like a dream. There is no mission editor in the game, anyone know where to download. ;)"
,flirtyguy10,2009-10-13T16:24Z,"What is ripped in this version? are the ingame videos removed???

Why the hell did TPTB stopped writing what's ripped in the info?"
,fx5300,2009-10-13T20:56Z,"flirtyguy10, Not sure bout all the video content, it does contain some bik files but editor is ripped which is a bit disappointing, i kno most multiplayer gamers would agree with me that the editor is even more important than the campaign game."
[T],chatbars,2009-10-14T19:52Z,Nothing has been ripped!!!
,fx5300,2009-10-14T20:14Z,"Hi chatbars, do you know then how to access the mission editor, is it packed in the arc files and if so does anyone know what program opens them."
,rugburn11,2009-10-14T23:05Z,"Found these...but i have not tested them yet ....can anyone verify these thank you
