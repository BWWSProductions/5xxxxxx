:::...> About
:
The game takes place on a small, fictional island based on the island of Kiska
located off the north coast of Japan called Skira and is set in the near future.
The island is a contested territory between Russia and China and becomes the
centre of an armed conflict when a large untapped oil and gas reserve is
discovered there. The Russians who own the island ask America (their allies)
to intervene as they are busy dealing with a large Chinese force on their own
Russian border. The game begins as the player arrives as part of the United
States Marine Corps which is tasked with capturing the island, on behalf of the
Russians, from the Chinese military.
