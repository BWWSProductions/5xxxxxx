,4883hsn,2009-10-12T19:50Z,"1.) For those with ''connection error'' problems: Don't worry its not your problem at all even though you are using a crack version you can create an account for yourself. The main problem came from the server lobby not yours.

2.) For those got installing problem remember to run as administrator when install, after installed close the game then copy OFPDR in the crack folder and rld.dll and paste in the location where you installed the game mostly in c:/program files/codemasters/OF Dragon Rising. replace the old file. 

3.) Please join us at:  http://www.xfire.com/communities/dragonrising/   Xfire contest in video shooting your own video clip on OFPDR.
also pls add me in yr friend list after you install xfire my acc name for xfire and OFPDR is perfectkiller."
