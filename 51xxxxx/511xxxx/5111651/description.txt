Philip Glass - Les Animeaux Amoureaux mp3

Soundtracks from the film with same title

mp3 

-------------- Rewiev -------------------
"One of the great strengths of this multi-talented composer is the creation of musical pictures. For this reason, the music Glass has written to films with no script are among his greatest achievements. These include the famous "Qatsi trio" (Koyannisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, Naqoyqatsi) and Anima Mundi made with Godfrey Reggio. In these films, the image and music blend seamlessly, due to intense collaboration between composer and director. But in addition, the music succeeds by itself as an orchestral suite in the way a soundtrack cannot do. Animals in Love is a worthy addition to that genre. Even without seeing the movie, the titles of the tracks are all one needs to let the music paint the picture."
Marvin Cohodas
