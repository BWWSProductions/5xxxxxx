This is my first torrent, so i hope it works okay.

Laputa - Castle in The Sky (NTSC)

Ripped and compressed to fit on a DVD-R using DVDShrink

Thanks for downloading, comments are appreciated. 


P.S. I can't seed constantly, I've only got a laptop which I need for school, but I'll seed when I can (aka the other 16 hours of the day.) And I'll seed until I get my copy of Windows 7, and have to format my HDD.
