,KingStevo69,2009-11-21T11:26Z,hey can u tell me if this still has all the menus extra & trailers??? if not what has been ripped from it?
,MaxKohler,2012-07-08T14:45Z,"@KingStevo69 it's got everything. Nothing's been removed from what I can tell.

I kept getting an error and crashing using VLC when I'd try to get the actual movie to play, but using Media -> Open disk -> dvd + checking ""no disk menus"" got it to work.

started off in 4:3 aspect ratio but it switched it to 16:10 and it looked a lot better.

you can choose the disney english version or the original japanese with english subtitles.

great torrent, thanks a lot!"
