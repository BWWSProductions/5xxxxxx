In this fairy tale, Hassan is a young man who occupies himself with the study of ancient manuscripts, the better to improve his calligraphy. One day he runs across a portion of an old text which convinces him that it holds the secrets to love. With the help of an impudent young boy and the boy's monkey (whom the boy thinks is an enchanted prince), Hassan sets out to find the rest of the manuscript. What he finds instead is the beauteous Aziz, and he learns as much as he cares to about love from his love for her. Despite their being separated by war, they are soon reunited.
