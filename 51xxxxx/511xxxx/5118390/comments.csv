,kaatje.nl,2009-10-11T10:08Z,no english subs?
,agrouse,2009-10-11T20:18Z,"The DVD is advertised as having English subtitles, why not include them in the torrented DVD image?  Surely there is enough room for them? 

Thanks for this DVD anyway, I'll just have to practice my Norwegian on those subtitles.  ;-)

,fredw76,2009-10-13T18:54Z,Are there really no English subs? I see they are listed on the discshop page linked to above. I guess it's not an image of the same DVD? Dischop has the release date as 10/21... maybe this is some pre-release version without the english subs

,agrouse,2009-10-22T18:35Z,"Hi - Thanks for that clarification. - I see the discshop site has amended it's info to remove the UK flag from the text line, their image of the rear clearly shows that there are no English subs.  Such a shame, this series would go down well with English-speakers - the 2005 series is currently being shown by the BBC for example.  Still -I enjoyed it very much using the Norsk subs (good practice!) 

- thanks a lot for the uploads."
