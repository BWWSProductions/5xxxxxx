Novelist Ben Mears returns to his home town of Jerusalem's Lot with plans to write a book about the 'Marsten House', an abandoned mansion which was the scene for a traumatic childhood incident.

Mears discovers that the Marsten house has been bought by Mr. Straker and Mr. Barlow, a pair of businessmen who are also new to the town, although only Straker has been seen. Their arrival coincides with the disappearance of a young boy, Ralphie Glick, and the suspicious death of his brother Danny.
