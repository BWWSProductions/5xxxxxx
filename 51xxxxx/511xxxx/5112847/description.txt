Muse - A Seaside Rendezvous [2009][GOLDFiSH_XviD][PDTV]
*******************************************************

Matt Bellamy, Dom Howard and Chris Wolstenholme all met and formed Muse as teenagers in the small Devon seaside town of Teignmouth.

They have always wanted to return and play a homecoming show for the town and given they are now used to playing to 80 thousand seater stadiums, it would undoubtedly be a huge occasion for both the town and the band.

This programme looks at how the band feel about growing up in Teignmouth, returning to play in the heart of it's seafront and how the locals, young and old, feel about them and their success and how the rock and roll circus impacts on the small town.
