*EAC had issues with the last track so I used Cdex to rip it. No proper log file could be made as EAC froze up and I needed to reboot the pc.

From Wiki:


Skid Row is an American heavy metal band, formed in 1986 in Toms River, New Jersey. They are named after Phil Lynott and Gary Moore's first band. They were most successful in the late 1980s and early 1990s when their first two albums with lead singer Sebastian Bach and drummer Rob Affuso were multi-platinum successes. Their current line-up consists of Johnny Solinger (vocals), Dave "The Snake" Sabo (guitar), Scotti Hill (guitar), Rachel Bolan (bass) and Dave Gara (drums). As of the end of 1996 the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

As of 2008, Skid Row has released five full-length albums, an EP, a compilation album, and a live album. For album and single sales information, see the Skid Row discography page. They became popular with their first two albums, Skid Row and Slave to the Grind, which are often considered their best-known works to date. Their last full-length studio album, Revolutions per Minute, came out on October 24, 2006.

They are often associated with glam metal, partly due to their image on their debut album, Skid Row, which spawned the hits "18 and Life", "Youth Gone Wild", and "I Remember You" for the band. They would eventually go on to foster an image base geared toward more traditional heavy metal and hard rock audiences.






40 Seasons â€“ The Best of Skid Row 1998


40 Seasons: The Best of Skid Row is a compilation album released by Skid Row in 1998, which includes the chart topping singles: "18 and Life", "I Remember You" and "Youth Gone Wild". Lead singer Sebastian Bach left the band due to personality differences. After Bach's departure, the remaining band members continued with a new lineup. The Subhuman Race album is represented with remixed, demo and/or live versions on songs. "Into Another", "My Enemy" and "Breakin' Down" were remixed for this album with more tender, slightly cleaner mixes, presumably so they fit more suitingly with the other tracks. It also included two unreleased tracks, one from the 1988 Skid Row sessions, and one from the 1990-91 Slave To The Grind sessions.
