Alien Mummies â€“ Chile 
Josh and team embark on their first UFO investigation in Chile, where, according to experts, an alien mummy was exhumed in the desert thousands of miles south of Lima. The stretch of land in-between is believed to be swarming with extraterrestrial activity. Locals also claim to see live aliens wandering around in the dark, mysterious lights in the sky and disembodied voices.

Van Lake Monster â€“ Turkey
Josh and the team engage in a fishing trip they wonâ€™t ever forget: something massive may be lurking in a lake in Van, Turkey. The lake, nearly the size of Rhode Island, is supposedly home to an animal that that measures more than 40 feet long, with dark scaly skin and a long spiny back. Though the myth stretches years back in Turkish history, nobody has yet proven if the monster exists or notery monitor. The team returns to the US and takes their findings to a professor at Santa Barbara for analysis
