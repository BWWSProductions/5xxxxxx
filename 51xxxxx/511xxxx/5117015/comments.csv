,Frrrrrrrrrrankus,2009-10-09T22:09Z,"I can't stand Sam.  He's got this style where he questions insults that are said to him.  It's really annoying and I fast forward through him.

""No why would I kill myself, then I would be dead"".  

Enough already."
,john2340,2009-10-09T22:21Z,he's being sarcastic 
,mancation,2009-10-09T22:50Z,i kinda like both Sam and Danny... they just add that little bit of difference every once in a while. IMO...
,Sballs,2009-10-10T00:11Z,"I love Danny & Sam.

David & Bobo I couldn't stand.  Well, I actually really liked David for a few weeks.  He got really boring after that.  I'm glad they are done with them."
