Rip+Edit mg56

10/9/09 Rundown: Long Friday show with Patrice Oneal in-studio, 
Blowing Up the Moon, Baseball, Steve's Breakfast, Gay Olympics, 
Fight Videos, Dr. Kaku phones in, more Letterman discussion, 
Evan's a Dumbass



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
