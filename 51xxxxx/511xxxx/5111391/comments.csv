,prince__vlad,2011-11-25T21:07Z,"this is not the original Tipard. it looks the same , exactly the same with the other version which says it is from 4VideoSoft MKV video convertor. And it doesn't do all the features. For instance if you have a mkv with two audio track , in original software you see those options and you can change them, in this one you can't , they don't appear on software interface. So my question is ...who the hell ripped those two programs and made them look the same with almost the same features except the ones I stress then above ??? I needed this for that purpose so this shit is doing nothing for me! Thx for nothing."
