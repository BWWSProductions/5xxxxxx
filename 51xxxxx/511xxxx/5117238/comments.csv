,ilovemycomputer,2011-02-21T09:00Z,"booster2, if this is really the director's cut and its in decent quality i want to seed it, but cant do that if theres nobody to seed it so i can get it. can you seed the video between 10 pm AK time and 9 am AK time? (ill be sleeping then) i'll help you by seeding the movie for ya."
,ilovemycomputer,2011-02-22T19:27Z,"booster ur gonna have to turn off all of your other seeds and just seed this file overnight or something for a few days until it completes.......
otherwise it gave me an eta of a year, i really dont want to wait that long to get this :p lol. a few weeks maybe, a month tops, but not a whole year."
