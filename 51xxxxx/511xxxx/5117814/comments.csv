,horrace,2009-10-10T17:31Z,"The reason I didn't add Physicist is because I don't have it. It's probably my least favorite of all his albums and even Devin himself considers it his worst album to date. If you really want it, I'm sure you can find it somewhere on this site."
,gasgpmo,2009-12-21T05:32Z,"So you don't include Physicist, his ""worst"" album, but you have Biomech in at 192kbps? You're fucking nuts."
,horrace,2009-12-27T09:31Z,"@gasgpmo

This music is free, so shut the fuck up."
,NoahTheDuke,2010-01-01T20:39Z,"Biomech is fucking brilliant. Still one of his best albums, especially seeing as it was his first.

Physicist is god awful. Horrible riffs, shitty lyrics, really vapid songwriting all around. Just, tripe.

tl;dr no you."

Devin rulez"
,Propane_Crazy,2010-05-03T12:29Z,Thanks horrace this helps complete my collection.
,outlaw_star1982,2011-03-04T06:20Z,Ocean machine is awesome you clearly have no taste if you think otherwise.  also i'd like to offer the special edition of SYL: No Sleep Till Bedtime live in australia which includes 2 bonus tracks Japan and Centipede.  this is the first SYL cd i ever bought and i was hooked since.  i can rip it and you may include it in your collection if you like it really is a must have.
