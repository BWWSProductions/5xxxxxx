Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with WinRar, Game was tested and work. 
Try 7zip its free google it, if don't have WinRar.



Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


           
You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.



Game Description:

In my opinion this game is awesome, great anime fmv, graphics, & action to boot.

Three years after the events that took place in the original Gungrave, the Corsione family has unleashed the deadly drug SEED upon the populace. Now it's up to Grave, Spike and Mika to follow the trail of SEED back to its source and eradicate it once and for all.

Much like its predecessor, Gungrave: Overdose offers up several action-packed levels that simply don't allow the player to let up on the fire button. This sequel ups the ante with even larger hordes of enemies to blast through along with a slew of destructible environments to wreak havoc in. Along the way, Grave will team up with newcomers Juji and Billy. Juji fights using a unique combination of close-range guns and swordplay, while Billy defeats his enemies with the sheer power of his electric guitar.

Gungrave: Overdose features character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (creator of the anime/manga Trigun) and Kosuke Fujishima (known for his work on Sakura Wars, Ah My Goddess, and the Tales series), and soundtrack composition by Tsuneo Imahori (composer for Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the Gungrave anime series). This game was released by Mastiff as a budget-priced title.

Features:

* High-energy anime environment: Wreak havoc with guns, swords or a guitar that 
  shoots electricity - all set against a glorious, fully-destructible, cell-shaded 
  environment.

* Three playable characters: Juji Kabane, a wrathful swordsman with incredibly  
  deady close-up attack and Rocket Billy RedCadillac, a leath-clad rock star with 
  his electric shooting guitar join undead GunGrave hero Beyond the Grave.

* Artistic points: Gain valuable points and unlock hidden moves by killing with 
  elegance.

* The Beat Counter: Boost your destructive arsenal by using the Beat Counter to 
  monitor your rate of destruction, clear enemies quickly and replenish your 
  health.

* Nine stages and 43 minutes of movies: the plot thickens, the stakes are higher 
  and the volume is more impressive than ever.


Game Pics Included.


Burn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).

Use Verbatim or Tayio Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media
isn't working.


If using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM 
(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).
