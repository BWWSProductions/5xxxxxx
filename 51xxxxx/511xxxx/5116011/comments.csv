,EnemyDrone,2009-10-09T07:16Z,"Ok this is about the 6th up of this claiming ot have ""fixed"" the audio! The audio is the same as all of the others, just louder! Still has the CAM audio just louder."
[V],neon,2009-10-09T09:32Z,"@Team_Ace... has this got the crappy audio or is it good throughout,im pretty sure people are getting fed up with this movie and it's audio, i am for sure."
,dlkpost,2009-10-09T10:23Z,Very nice. Thanks.
,Team_Ace,2009-10-09T22:12Z,"the audio sounds great to me, even for cam audio."
,Team_Ace,2009-10-09T22:20Z,"And one other thing, i take the time to make these releases for free before the store retail date, so please take some consideration and be thankful to ur uploaders"
[V],neon,2009-10-09T22:30Z,"thats all i wanted to know,if you are saying it sounds great then i'll go ahead and d/l your copy ....thanks to the uploader."
[V],neon,2009-10-10T07:04Z,"video 9 audio 2--after converting to disc the audio is truly terrible,absolutly no idea what the characters were saying,audio gets better after 43 mins but who starts watching a movie from there...so thanks again to the uploader--not for the movie this time,thanks for saying audios great when in fact it's shit. "
,Team_Ace,2009-10-10T19:45Z,"or maybe u need better speakers? I had to problem with it...and i dont see u doing anything, keep ur opinions to urself if you got nothing good to say. if you think u can do a better job, then go out and do it yourself. otherwise, keep nasty remarks to yourself...im here to share thats what P2P is all about, if u dont like it, then leave."
[V],neon,2009-10-10T23:43Z,"all i did was ask you if audio is good or bad,you said its great,and im telling you thats a lie cause its so muffled you cant hear whats being said,and as for sharing with the p2p crowd if you click on my name  you will see i have a few more torrents than you,my comment was truthful...the diffrence between me and you is i dont lie to the people i share my stuff with and i dont  post audio you cant make out cause no-one likes a liar dude...now i suggest that you get better speakers or leave if your posts are going to be well below par"
,123_Kid,2009-10-11T17:24Z,"The best way to see this movie with good audio is to PAY 10 FUCKING DOLLARS AND GO TO THE THEATER, THIS IS A FREE FREE FREE FREE FREE FREE FREE FREE RELEASE AND THE UPPER WORKED HARD TO MAKE IT

tahnks, if the sound sucks, I'll turn it up, or wait, or go to the theater"
