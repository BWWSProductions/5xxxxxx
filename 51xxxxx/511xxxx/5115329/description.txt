The 8th tournament of the female spin-off of Sasuke, Kunoichi (Women of Ninja Warrior in America). 
The setup of the show has changed since the last tournament in 2007.

This is the Japanese broadcast (G4 won't show it until probably next year).  Recorded from TVAnts so medium-high quality.  The last 10 minutes of the broadcast are missing from this file.
