David Attenborough's thrilling series, taking us on a guided tour through the secret world of plants, is captured on this amazing DVD. The account of plant life's struggle for survival is seen as never before in a story full of drama, beauty and staggering achievement. Attenborough takes us through each aspect of plants' lives travelling, growing, flowering, their struggle with other plants and animals, and the ingenious way they adapt to even the harshest of conditions.

From the 290-foot-high California Sequoia or the rattan plants that use ferocious ants as bodyguards, to the insect- and even rat-devouring pitcher plants of Borneo, the mysteries of the plant world are unravelled. Using fantastic time-lapse photography, Attenborough shows us plant life in action; beautiful filming highlights the biggest, brightest and the most bizarre of plants and, with the aid of computer graphics, we enter the inner workings of the bodies of plants. Prepare to be surprised and delighted as Attenborough takes you on a journey through a world you thought you knew.
