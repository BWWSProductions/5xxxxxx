,duett_power_,2011-01-05T13:18Z,"When I've saved once, and then shut down the PS2 and then shut it on again the game doesn't find the memorycard. Why? If i delete the gamefile and then try to save again it works, but when I shut down the PS2 and then turn it on again the game doesn't find the memorycard :( WHY? :("
,duett_power_,2011-01-05T16:42Z,I found the reason. The game didn't like my MAX MEMORY 16MB MEMORY CARD. I tried with my ORIGINAL 8MB PS2 MEMORY CARD and now it works fine! :)
