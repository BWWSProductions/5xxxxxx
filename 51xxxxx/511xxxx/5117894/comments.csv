,Milnet,2009-10-11T01:41Z,"This Tracker is not working correctly. The tracker does not send any data, thats why the transfer does not start and azureus does log it as a connection problem...

anyone has an alternative torrent for the 720p version of this episode?"

Tracker works fine... (600 seeds)
Screw azureus and get bittorrent ^^

Thx for uploading uploader"
,tefa66,2009-10-21T09:33Z,"it ain't working for me either

I get the message ""Unable to load 'Smallville.S09E03.720p.HDTV.x264-CTU.mkv ' Invalid torrent file!""

AND I USE BITTORRENT!"
