Alone In Four Walls (2007)

Filmmaker Alexandra Westmeier provides an intimate glimpse at a home for juvenile delinquents in rural Russia, where boys under the age of 14 are held for crimes ranging from theft to rape to multiple murders. The boys receive food and clothing. They go to school and take part in sports. For the first time in their young lives they no longer have to fight for their daily existence; they can simply be what they are - children.
