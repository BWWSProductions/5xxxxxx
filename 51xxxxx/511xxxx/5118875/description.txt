From Here to Maternity 

A woman gives birth to twins - one black and one white. Unbeknownst to her, Dr. Austin's patient is improperly anesthetized during surgery, and can hear and feel the pain of the entire procedure. But everyone is more outraged about an insensitive - albeit accurate - remark that she makes, rather than his physical ordeal. While Lisa feels overwhelmed, a 13 year old genius stalks her, looking for her help and attention.
