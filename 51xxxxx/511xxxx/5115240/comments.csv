,Tairdar,2011-03-09T18:01Z,"I get a save error after the first save point.  If I try to, the game says ""save failed"".  I tried changing the save type according to some answers I found on google, but nothing works, and some say that no$gba 2.6a cannot play it period for this reason.  Can you confirm or deny this?"
