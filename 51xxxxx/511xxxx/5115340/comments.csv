Out of curiosity, for what reasons are people downloading this? Philosophy/cultural studies students looking to save on textbooks? Debaters wanting to expand their biopolitics kritik files? Just for fun?"
,izzyw1zzy,2010-05-27T23:08Z,"Looking for Foucault criticism.  Foucault is the best for me -- So obviously, I'm looking for more. Thanks for the torrent.  Also: Any *media* (ie- more than just text) available which isn't The UCB lectures and the Chomsky debate?  Can't speak French, so ... Just wondering I guess..."
,VacantMetropolis,2010-08-01T14:30Z,"Thanks!

Reasons: 1. I'm broke. 2. Just doing research and trying to formulate ideas for my undergrad thesis. I'm interested in studying historical conceptions + artistic representations of the flayed human body (?corch?).

I was originally just looking for Birth of the Clinic + The Order of Things but I found so much more : ) thanks again"
