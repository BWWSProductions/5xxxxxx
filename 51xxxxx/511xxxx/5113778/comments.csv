,rubatos,2009-10-08T00:27Z,Hope this one is real! Cheers!
,abhishekdaniel5,2009-10-08T10:25Z,"what the fuck? is this real..
windows 7 is releasing on 21"
,pegapalo,2009-10-08T16:45Z,"totally confuse here cclloyd which is the x64 download.. I saw the 5G download,, there is a 13 G and this is a 12 G,, so downloading this one hoping is the x64.. why the difference on download size? from 5G to 12 G"
,Tim_Beluga,2009-10-08T19:47Z,"Thanks, just hope for a seeder soon:)

@pegapalo: The different sizes I guess are cause this one contains 4 different isos, one for home, pro, ultimate and OME. Judging by filename they all are 64bit versions of all the different versions."
,cclloyd,2009-10-09T00:22Z,"The 5GB one you were looking at was my Enterprise edition.

And i got it from Technet.  Have an inside source there."
,pegapalo,2009-10-09T13:56Z,"thanks for the answer cclloyd.. you have the best version of them all.. Iam downloading the 3 of them (currently at 20%) to help seed.. Just need the x64 thou!!,, keep seedingggg"
,jakopi,2009-10-09T18:59Z,Does anyone know what is the final version and what is this version?
,jakopi,2009-10-09T19:07Z,"Forget the last one, just read the info :)"
,klubbsoda,2009-10-09T23:44Z,"Thanks a million for the upload! I've been looking for a good Windows 7 64bits version to use all the ram I have.

One question though, will the 32bits Windows 7 hacks work with this 64bits version? I can't seem to find any 64bit-specific hacks to get it to work forever."
,Bloodmage34,2009-10-10T07:00Z,"Can I install this with Vista installed or do I need to back my hard drive up, then wipe the computer then do a new install with windows 7? thanks for your time."
,r.jpirate,2009-10-10T09:27Z,will this work and will it show me message that your copy of windows is pirated.
,laidbacktokyo,2009-10-10T11:13Z,"TO: cclloyd 

Could you please provide a bit more details about OEM DVD included...

So far you said that this one has also came directly from MS, does this mean that it includes $OEM$ folders for ALL(?!!!) MS OEM partners? or one $OEM$ folder with the master-key OEM info? Please explain in brief..

Now I'm downloading both of yours x64 and x86 and definetely will seed, but the down speed is too slow (some 0~100kB/s) for such volumes... (my current up speed of these torents is at last twice higher) and I can't check about my question by myself... unfortunately.


Thank you."
,cclloyd,2009-10-10T15:42Z,"Well im seeding to all 500 ppl.  There are like 30 ppl at 70% so i will get a jump in seeds.

OEM just means that the support of the OS comes from your manfacturer.  If you use 7Loader you can  choose which OEM to install.  Thats when you get the OEM folders."
,laidbacktokyo,2009-10-10T18:31Z,"TO: cclloyd

thanks for a prompt.

sorry but I can't understand well what you said...

the genuine OEM DVD means $OEM$ folder in Sources, which matches SLP/SLIC info of the particular OEM manufacturer in BIOS and includes all info for successful OS activation after installation... in this case ei.cfg should also match Version-OEM.

In one word - I don't like loaders and need a copy the genuine $OEM$ folder(s) of Dell, Asus etc, then I will cook appropriate OEM DVD based on MSDN by myself...

Thank you."
,pegapalo,2009-10-10T20:14Z,"@bloodmage34 there is an application you can download from the win 7 site,, win7 update adv. It will tell you which version to install. You can either update or full installation.. is really up to you.   "
,pegapalo,2009-10-10T20:16Z,"finally, going to see it tomorrow morning already. after 2 days downloading. this version and the x86 both on 70 and 80 % respectively. Will seed the hell out of it.. will let it run 24/7 for couple of weeks.. thanks again cclloyd"
,thewinwizard,2009-10-10T21:59Z,"Please seed this people, and thank you for the torrent cclloyd."
,Bloodmage34,2009-10-11T02:44Z,"@pepapalo, thanks for the info. i did the win upgrade advisor like you said and it said I could do a in- place upgrade. But if I choose to upgrade to a different edition I will need to do a clean install. Right now i have vista home Premium 64. Does this mean that I can do an in-place upgrade to win7 home Premium without a clean install. Cause I would like to have Win7 Ultimate 64. If I want Win7 Ultimate 64 will it do an in-place upgrade or will I need to do a clean install. The last thing does this torrent have everything that I need for all of this? Thank you so much for your help."
,cclloyd,2009-10-11T03:00Z,"Almost got another seed.

and you should be able to do an upgrade install.  If you want to make sure, open the ISO, go to Sources>cversion.ini.  If the info there for either one of the values is 6000, 6001, or 6002, then you can do an upgrade install.  If its higher than either of those then you will need to extract the ISO to a USB (Freshly formatted to Fat32) then edit the cversion.ini to 6000 on both of the values.  Then you can do an upgrade install via the USB."
,mja85,2009-10-11T06:20Z,if you change the cversion.ini values as you say will that allow an upgrade install from vista home to windows 7 professional or am I locked into upgrading to win 7 home or clean install as my only options?
,laidbacktokyo,2009-10-11T09:32Z,"TO: cclloyd

well... OK. I found that I already got OEM image in full...

Now I wonna just to confirm that the meaning of OEM for this DVD is ei.cfg file removed, i.e. all-version DVD (it's likely equal to Ultimate DVD) minus ei.cfg file. Is it correct?

Thank you."
,pegapalo,2009-10-11T15:55Z,"@bloodmage34 Im pretty sure u can do the in-place upgrade, I have the same as u the vista x64 I am just planing to do the upgrade. "
,pegapalo,2009-10-11T15:58Z,Finally got both versions the x86 and x64 seeding as promess for couple of weeks at full conection speed. backing everything up as I type before get to upgrade.. :)
,pegapalo,2009-10-11T16:01Z,hope u guys are doing better than me with the speed!!!!
,pegapalo,2009-10-11T16:05Z,"@bloodmage34 , Is really up to you I can do both upgrades either to home premium or to ultimate, I am choosing the ultimate. Just make sure you also update all your drivers.. thats very important if you planing to upgrade.."
,cclloyd,2009-10-11T16:59Z,"Ok to clear things up.  The ei.cfg has 3 lines in it

Version to install (ultimate, home premium ect)
OEM or Retail
Volume License

When you remove the ei.cfg, it automatically installs to an OEM corresponding to your system.  If your system doesnt have an OEM, then it will just install without one.  Now if you want an OEM, then you can use 7Loader to install an OEM to your system.  


And just info for you guys.   Most likely, the upgrade install, like it did for me, updated my drivers automatically.  You just have to choose to connect to the internet and install updates during the installation."
,pegapalo,2009-10-11T23:11Z,ok finally installed. It work like a charm! Thanks a lot cclloyd!!! very clean copy! super download.
,pegapalo,2009-10-11T23:14Z,"some problems that I had to fix. Sound with IDT HD sound.. didnt work, had to uninstalled and rebot, then go to sounds and configured all over again. but nothing to go crazy over it. For daemon pro. not work at all! need another mount software, does anyone has any suggestions?"
,mja85,2009-10-12T01:14Z,hahah I did a clean install because I wanted 64 bit windows but it installed 32 bit what the hell ccloyd?  what a pain.
,jovialcre,2009-10-12T02:27Z,is a key required to install?
,skullguy69,2009-10-12T03:42Z,"ok,
 I am new to this so I have some questions.

I downloaded the files, can I put them to disk to put on another machine?
are they self extracting or ???
Do I need to use the ei.cfg to get the programs to work or install?

I have a new HD and want to put the pro or ulitmate version on it.

Any suggestions would be great

Thanks"
,cclloyd,2009-10-12T04:41Z,"If you have a new external drive then you can try to install it by booting from a CD after burning then installing it to the hard drive.  If it doesnt let you then you will need to use VirtualBox from virtualbox.org to install it to a VM. 

and a general note to everyone.  You have nothing to do with the ei.cfg.  You do not need to worry about any files inside these files."
,miketestting,2009-10-12T07:41Z,"PLEASE HELP - I downloaded the entire torrent (all 4 ISOs) and did a clean install from the OEM ISO - It's now asking me for a product key... What now?

Please someone help!!!

Thanks!"
,miketestting,2009-10-12T08:09Z,"Ok,
So, I just didn't put in a product key and it completed the install, but now I have 30 days to activate the product and put in a legit key...

I'd prefer not to do this, but also please let me know, if there's no answer to this question (hopefully there is one, though), could ijust install my old vista and do an upgrade and then not have to put in a key??

Thanks gurus out there and THANKS cclloyd! - You rock!!!"
,pegapalo,2009-10-12T11:57Z,"@miketestting pretty sure cclloyd has the answer for that. But if you want to, any windows 7 loader will do the trick with the OEM just fine..At least thats what i did and it work perfectly fine."
,pegapalo,2009-10-12T12:03Z,"just to help... virtual clone ,, mount software works perfectly with win 7 ultimate x64.. tried alcohol120 ver.7612 and power iso but for some reason didnt work in my hp dv1285."
,pegapalo,2009-10-12T13:06Z,"cclloyd thanks a lot man(again), loving this win 7.. no crashes and not freezes so far, handling a whole bunch of programs and running great.. YOU ARE THE MAN! thanks a lot for the upload.. "
,torrentmonkey,2009-10-12T15:08Z,"Just wanted to say thanks to cclloyd, I did not download all the versions, just the ultimate one and not only did it check as valid with Windows 7 ISO verifier, but it works flawlessly.  Thanks you, keep up the great work."
,miketestting,2009-10-12T15:56Z,"Guys,

I'm sorry to be this stupid, but I truly don't understand... What is a windows 7 loader and how would I use it to put in a product key?

My problem wasn't burning / loading up the ISO, my problem is that now windows wants a product key from me and I don't have one...

I've read all the comment posted here and I still don't get how to do this - Please could someone elaborate quite a bit more about how to install properly / what to do now?

MANY thanks and sorry for being the stupid kid in the class"
,cclloyd,2009-10-12T17:27Z,"Just search 7Loader on TPB and it will auto imput the product key when you install it. 

And im not sure wat ur sayin but you dont need a product key to install it.  Just skip it."
,miketestting,2009-10-12T17:39Z,"I am SO truly sorry for being the slow kid in the class - Here's what I did and what's happened:
 - I completely low-level formatted my new laptop and used the OEM DVD to clean-install windows 7 (ultimate) on the blank hard-drive.
 - The install asked me for a product key and I just left it blank.
 - Now windows is working perfectly, but it tells me I have 30 days to activate and still wants a product key from me.

So what to do now?
If I use a 7loader within windows 7, will it fix this issue for me or should I first re-install Vista on my laptop to use its product key and then upgrade to 7?

PLEASE HELP... I REALLY am sorry for asking the dumb questions, but I'm just not getting this!"

 Run 7Loader, click Install/Remove loader,wait reboot and that's it. You don't have to re-install Vista. "
,jakopi,2009-10-12T19:32Z,"Many thanks cclloyd, Ultimate works perfect. "
,miketestting,2009-10-12T23:06Z,"Guys, let me just say... YOU ROCK!!!

I now have windows 7 ultimate permanantly activated - Ran my updates and everything and all is working perfectly!

cclloyd, THANK YOU SO MUCH for this torrent!
jakopi - Thanks!!
"
,skullguy69,2009-10-13T07:57Z,"ok,
 I installed the ultimate on a new internal HD.

It runs fine, but I only have 30 days on this install.

 I tried running the verifier AND the 7loader and niether one did anything.

the system stills states I have 30 days.

Any suggestions????

And please, speak stupidese....as I am also one of the stupid kids in the classroom here....

Thanks....

,james7209,2009-10-14T00:23Z,"What's the difference between the OEM version and the ""retail windows 7 ultimate"" version? can you activate them both for free with this link?
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5111980/7Loader_1.6d_by_Hazar_%5BJasper100%5D"
,cclloyd,2009-10-14T20:40Z,"The only difference between OEM and retail is that OEM comes with support via your manufacturer ie. HP, or Dell.  

Retail means you get support from Microsoft only.  So i would choose OEM because it is easier to install for one, and 2 if you use 7Loader to activate (it does work) you can choose your OEM."
,abdulbadeea_88,2009-10-14T21:37Z,hi i downloaded the retail version of windows 7 ultimate but no windows activator will work can anyone tell me one that has been tried and works thanks in advance

,irkeith,2009-10-17T01:12Z,has anyone had response problems with this version..i have been running rc since it came out with no problems..i loaded retail ultimate from here on and as i installed programs the response got slower and slower..for example..thunderbird and quicken taking as much as 5 minutes to load..this was after installing the updates..i have removed the installation now because it was running slower than my original compaq in 1982..went back to the rc version which still runs normally..
