finished on 9/10/2009 11:59am...

if u ask me.... that aint bad i have waited much longer b4 for others.

thanx .Bone. and Reloaded

trying it out now...
if i find any problems like some people are... i will find out, what, why, and when...and post a way to fix them.
i doubt i will have any problems tho... i never have with any of realoaded's work"
,susscon,2009-10-09T16:02Z,"Works 100% no troubles no need for a crack as some people have said in the comments... the one in the torrent works just fine...
there is no viruses either as some people have said there was...
shit i dunno what planet people come from sometimes....
im sure they just come on here and comment to confuse people...i bet they aint even downloaded it.

well anyway for me its 100% flawless... well worth the time to wait for it to download.

people who comparing it to ARMA II .... well i have to agree on some level...

Arma II is good, and much more realistic gameplay...but also alot more complicated given the controls of the game...

Rising Dragon is just as good, but its more of a COD4 version of ARMA II if u know what i mean (more fun)... i.e. less complicated controlls/ more fighting and action. only played it briefly... but i can tell im going to enjoy it just as much as ARMA II...

:) happy gaming people and thanx again to .BONE. and Reloaded. "
,susscon,2009-10-09T16:23Z,"One more thing i did say to help if i find any problems (but i didnt)

Just to confirm it does work....

make sure you mark ALL the zip files using WINRAR...

extract to folder.... (where ever) on HDD

once extracted, u will have a single file....
(u may delete all the zip files and just keep the single extracted file if u want).

use power Iso or WinRar to Extract again onto the HDD (to a folder of your choice)

once extracted find the setup.exe and run...

once installed goto crack folder and copy ''BOTH'' files into the installed directory i.e... (C:\Games\Flashpoint)

it will ask to Copy or replace ect... make sure you select (MOVE AND REPLACE)

now create a shourtcut to your desktop...

Double click (left mouse button)

Look at your Screen....

Turn your head all the way to the right...

then turn your head all the way to the left...

Repeat the words (clata merata nikto)... 

tap your feet together 3 times and repeat the words (there no place like Pirate bay)...

Look back at your screen and you will see...

Flashpoint: Rising Dragon

If not?? then go and take a knife with a sharp point...

put the hande against a wall and tip of the blade facing u at head hight....

and HEAD BUTT THE FUKER as hard as you can u fukin TARDED DWEEBS"

,trnsistr9,2011-02-03T17:33Z,"For fuck sake, stop this bullshit with rars.
A. You cannot compress a installer (it is already compressed). You just added 74 megs to this. Also, decompression wastes 2 minutes on a quad core PC.
B. Multiparts are a bucket of balls too, because torrent has bulletproof error check. You just bloat the .torrent file's size.

Thank you, .BONE., hope you read and consider this."
,Basse94,2011-02-13T14:09Z,"@trnsistr9 when you split it into theese small rar's cops wouldnt suspect you for downloading a game, because 27 meg files could just aswell be a trailer for a movie...moron rtfm"
