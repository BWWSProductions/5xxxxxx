PLOT

When a small town is invaded by aliens from outer space who are capturing and 
killing the townspeople, no one takes them seriously. Why? The aliens all look 
like circus clowns, use weapons that look clown like, and all have painted on 
smiles. Only a few of the young people in the town realize the danger and of 
course no one believes them. Armed with an ice cream truck they try and rescue 
their friends.
