,n204life,2009-10-06T20:34Z,Once i get it ill run abgx and post the report 
,fansofcrime3,2009-10-07T00:13Z,Thank you gamer guy. Appreciate all the hard work. No if it would just download a little quicker. Come on guys start seeding this game is going to be off the hook. Thank Again
,n204life,2009-10-07T01:16Z,Come on gamerguy just let one guy fully get it and then you can stop seeding.  Were all at a stand still.  Please SEED
,iketheclerk,2009-10-07T01:35Z,Thanks! Will seed as soon as I have it.
,ace_012,2009-10-07T02:44Z,"Awesome thanks for the release, can't wait till seeders start popping up. 

Just a quick question, when you say region free do you actually make the iso region free through the computer, or is it just a different disc from the PAL disc? "
,stooz101,2009-10-07T12:36Z,"ABGX360 shows verification failed, does that mean it cannot be played yet, or cannot be played online yet ?? if its burned to DVD will the game be no good to play until it has been verified by ABGX ?

can someone fill me in, cheers folks.

and lastly thanx for the up."
,skytwin,2009-10-07T13:23Z,"@Faabs.  Its the IMARS version.  No idea why this isn't included and why they aren't mentioned seens as they did the ""hard"" bit

@stooz101 - abgx360 relies on a minimum of 2 different rips being uploaded.  Changes are this is PAL retail therefore until we get another, it won't be verified.

If this is the IMARS rip, then chances are live will be fine regardless (abgx360 is not flawless and a decent scene release is just as legit).  If however this is a P2P release then avoid live like the plague.

MS do record what you play offline as well so perhaps they'll notice.  Find out next month."
,t0m1337,2009-10-07T14:06Z,"who stopped seeding, i had 200kb, now i have 10 :("
,Heavyweightgd6,2009-10-07T14:32Z,Please please please seed!
,Vader--,2009-10-07T15:21Z,"@ skytwin( MS do record what you play offline as well so perhaps they'll notice. Find out next month.)
 Kinda hard for them to do that when you own more than one box like a smart modder eh!
Thanks yet again gamerguuy."
,bl4ckl34d,2009-10-07T16:56Z,"Hey i've got 1 question.
I live in Europe and the game is not out yet here.
But if I put my region to US will i then get banned or what?"
,bl4ckl34d,2009-10-07T16:57Z,If someone gives me a good answer i'll seed like hell.
,ankit1991_007,2009-10-07T17:07Z,is it region free ..has anyone tested it ??
,ShineEyes,2009-10-07T19:12Z,"@everyone
MS has no idea and can't do a single thing provided you..

A- Have the newest firmware.
B- Have every game with verified stealth.
C- MOST IMPORANT! Do..not..play..until..release date.

If you follow those simple rules, MS can do absolutely nothing to you.  They have no grounds to ban you. The reason you play so many games could very well be because you're rich, work at a game store and rent them or borrow them from a bunch of friends that have a few games each.  No worries, guys."
,ankit1991_007,2009-10-07T19:34Z,plzz sme1 tell me is it region free????
,dirtyability,2009-10-07T19:46Z,Great copy.  Yes it is region free.  Thank you for the upload!!!
,ShineEyes,2009-10-07T23:53Z,People REALLY NEED TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO THE TITLE OF TORRENTS.  It says region free RIGHT THERE!  Jesus.
,n204life,2009-10-08T00:10Z,No one should be bitching about seeding ive been seeding at 300/k for the past 24hrs
,t0m1337,2009-10-08T00:12Z,I am seeding all night guys! :) 
,ace_012,2009-10-08T02:30Z,"I haven't finished this torrent, fyi, but I ripped my own copy and it seems that it couldn't be verified in abgx, starting scan and autofix both failed. (run level 3) I made the backup through xbox backup creator. 

So I'm guessing this won't verify either until it's in abgx database. "
,rapskal,2009-10-08T04:04Z,Come on people seed! Only 5 seeders : ( 
,ElCaza,2009-10-09T09:55Z,It's works perfect on my NTSC xbox and in spanish. Many thanks from Argentina.
,rapskal,2009-10-09T12:59Z,Gringo Sanchez people like you don't deserve access to torrents. 
,McNutsack,2009-10-10T07:42Z,"When I run XDVDMulleter, it says ""Video file is broken, invalid, or not present. Would you like to fix?"" I select No, and on the next screen it tells me it's not ixtreme compatible. 

However, running ABGX360, everything comes out fine, and green, including it being stealthed.

So, why is XDVDMulleter wrong, or saying different than ABGX360? Should I ignore it? Should I choose to fix video?

I've never used XDVDMulleter, and the only other game I've burned and played is WET.
Just  want  to  make sure it's safe and stealth..."
,bugizoli,2009-10-10T07:53Z,"seeeeeeeeeed please!!!!!!!!!!

,beta_hacker,2009-10-15T20:58Z,"hey, did this pass stealth check for anyone else? because it failed for me but im kinda new to this stuf so am i just doing something wrong or what?"
,sammaful,2009-10-17T11:26Z,i was waiting for this game for a long long time and im sorry guys but its very dissapointing glitchy buggy the ai couldnt actually be any more stupid at times and the enemy ai is way overpowered its worth a play but be warned you will get very frustrated and dont try and jump over sandbags with netting on them as youll get stuck in the sandbags and wont be able to move 
,rootshll,2009-10-19T02:28Z,??????????????????
,clomkfly,2009-10-28T15:23Z,"if anyone is download using uTorrent. goto bottom bar an left-click upload, click unlimited or your game wont burn correct! LOL HEHE "
