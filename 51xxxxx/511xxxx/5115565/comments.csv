Can someone help me?"
,john01823,2009-11-14T05:33Z,You either need a dual layer DVD(8.5gb) or split it onto two regular DVDs. You will need some program such as NERO to split the movie.
,grbyslzr69,2010-05-16T03:15Z,Thank you for the up. You can use too ImageBurn.Please seed.
,EagleyeSask,2011-01-16T21:51Z,or you can use 2 programs. one that mounts the image as a drive and then rip your own version from that.
