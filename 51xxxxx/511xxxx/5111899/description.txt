Daytime Robbery formed in late 2007 when lead guitarist/vocalist Ryan Romanowski, decided to take his playing career to the next level. Joining up with Daytime's former drummer, Lenny Querques and Daytime's current bassist, Mike Bickford they began to formulate their music. Over a year's worth of hard work and dedication, left them with a six song EP (Demoura), a track record of gigs and shows, and a gradually growing fan base. Their accomplishments were piled high for a band so new, playing at New Jersey venues that included; The Stone Pony, The Brighton Bar, The Saint, Bar A, Cafe 55 and Rick's American Cafe. Also listed high with their achievements was opening up for Miles Hunt of the Wonder Stuff at the Brighton Bar.
