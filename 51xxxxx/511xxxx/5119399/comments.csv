,TitMonger,2009-10-11T07:24Z,Wow. Nice share. 
[T],jwhitt62,2009-10-11T07:43Z,Gene was also a socialist...but I can forgive that...it's great entertainment...except for the Utopian overtones.
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-11T08:04Z,"I think JJ Abrams has official taken care of the Utopian overtones ... heck, he BLEW UP VULCAN!! LOL!"
,QuietGeek,2009-10-11T12:44Z,"Great piece of work, VoV. I've been looking for HQ vids of the ST film series ever since downloading horrendous copies from file hosts via blogs (pixelated single-pass encodings, vid artifacts, wacked out aspect ratios). This torrent is the answer to my prayers, judging from the superb screenshots. And kudos to the great documentation on this page. An example for all uploaders to see.

Btw, eternal generous seeding is a pleasure when it comes to a quality torrent like this. Cheers!"
,DipNFalls,2009-10-11T13:02Z,"VoV, as always you are the best at what you do. Thanks so much for the time and effort put into these movies. Definitely a get for me...."
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-11T22:01Z,"Thanks for the compliments.  Judging by how fast it's uploading and the nice sized swarm we've got so far.  I'm guessing it will take about 5-6 days to complete this upload.  Hopefully, by then it will be very well seeded and stay active for a nice long time.

For those interested, I just recently found the first 720p cap of Friday's episode of Star Wars:  The Clone Wars and I'm downloading it now.  Because this torrent will take quite a while to download, if the 720p rip turns out good, I'll probably end up uploading both this past episode and the next episode together this coming Friday / Saturday ... depending on when this torrent finishes seeding."
,Nightlord2005,2009-10-12T08:43Z,"Wonderful upload. As always you have done an extraordinary job. Thank you.
I have been trying to find your Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy rips for the iPod/iPhone as a torrent, but without success so far. It is too much to ask if you could post them here?
Looking for the Matrix Trilogy too....."
,irvin7us,2009-10-14T05:30Z,hey VoV could you please upload the first Toy Story movie? thanks in advance and keep up awesome work
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-19T03:47Z,"First, it looks like I'm getting multiple people to 100% now, but I'll keep seeding slowly for a little bit.  But very soon I'll stop.  As I said, this is a huge upload for me, I usually only upload 6-8GB / torrent, and I've already seeded out over 26GB on this torrent alone.

But this was a fun request to fill, though it gave me headaches at times.

The requested films have been added to my request queue, but it might be a little while, there are other films ahead of you!


MY THANKS GO OUT TO ALL THOSE WHO SEED TO 1:1 or GREATER!  THANK YOU AND KEEP THIS TORRENT ALIVE!"
,DipNFalls,2009-10-24T01:12Z,"VoV what are you working on next, besides your Clone Wars uploads?"
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-24T19:10Z,"I have just been taking a bit of a break from uploading.  Sort of like a nice sigh after uploading this big torrent.

I'll be uploading episodes 3 & 4 of CW tonight, then I've got a few other requested uploads scheduled:
- Equilibrium (853x)
- Next (853x)
And some others too.  I've got plenty I'm working on, just not enough time to get it all done :D"
,swamiolsson,2009-11-04T11:50Z,"Hello, Vix, this is a gift come right to my door. May I extend my sincere thanks to You?
Yes, reseeding to at least 1:1 is a must - otherwise the whole idea of P2P perishes."
,irvin7us,2009-11-19T02:10Z,what happened to you VoV bein missin your torrents your an awesome uploader 
,ruffjas,2009-12-10T02:20Z,"Seed please

Thanks"
