Do A Search Before You Upload, Might Save You The Trouble Of Uping Something That's Already Here.  But Then Again Some People Don't Search They Wait To Get It From Certain Trusted Uploaders.....Fxg, FXM, Crazy-Torrent,,,,The List Goes On!"

jlsmetalhead you need to shut the fuck up no one asked for your opinion youre not even d/l! DUQA has some of the best stuff available and its none of your business when its uploaded or whos got what up, its about quality. Mind your own business and until such time as you start uploading quality torrents keep your opinions to yourself cause no one wants to hear your blabbering bullshit."
