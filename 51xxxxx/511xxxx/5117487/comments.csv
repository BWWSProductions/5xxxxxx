Upload rate is going to suffer vastly, at my house i can upload to you guys at 150 kbs, here you will be lucky to get 20kbs.  again i appologize, i will continue to seed even though it sux.  n once i get back home i will super seed it with my faster connection, untill i have uploaded at least 10gb,  i have allready uploaded around 5 or so.  anyhow just wanted to comment in case anyone was d/ling"

,ernieballesp06,2009-10-22T16:00Z,"looks like my torrents were somewhat of a hit, i am in the process of collecting another couple of packs to upload.  untill then i will continure to seed the two i have up, i have seeded one to 24gb and another to 16gb.  

totaly offtopic to coast to coast am, i am looking for Digital Tutors tutorials.  ones for Autodesk Maya, and Zbrush.  if anyone has any of the newer ones, like 2009, or 2010 i would greatly appretiate the upload i simply dont have 60 bucks to drop on one right now or i would, and i need more then one :o).  the only older ones i could use is metal ray sub serface scattering and mental ray workflows in maya.  i have the maya extreme bundle and quite a few others i could upload if anyone needs those.  

any help would be greatly appretiated

Best regaurds

,WEASELWAGON,2009-10-24T18:35Z,"I wish i could help you out for the nice Sasquatch upload-everytime i tried to get ZBrush,i had issues with activation because of bad keys,I'll take a look around on Emule and see if I can find something for you.
Do you have the ""hunt for the skinwalker"" coast to coast episode? its not currently seeded.THanks again dude."
,WEASELWAGON,2009-10-24T18:39Z,disregard that last post-i thought you meant the actual program-i'm looking on emule right now and see if i can get one for ya-but remember emule is notorious for slow speeds and fake or re-named stuff-
,RwarItsBriee,2010-12-18T03:48Z,Hey I was wondering if you could get the Coast to Coast AM mothman collection for me? I'd def appreciate it :]
,V.R.Angel,2012-04-16T07:17Z,How difficult do you think it would be to get a collection of every single show that they have ever put out?
