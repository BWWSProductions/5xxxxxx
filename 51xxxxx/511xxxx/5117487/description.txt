The main point of this torrent was the bigfoot collection, requested by WEASELWAGON.  however i decided to include a few others i downloaded along with it.  since the archive goes back 3 full years there are quite a few good shows to choose from.  anyhow i included 8 bigfoot shows i found off the coast website.  thier may be more that i missed if so i appologize, this is what i found for now at least i guess.  as well i included a few shows with Richard C Hoagland, and steven quayle, as well as some shows from 2006 i downloaded.  

i hope everyone enjoys
