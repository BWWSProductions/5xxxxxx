,Inthecloset,2009-10-08T17:28Z,"Many thanks for uploading,

This was posted on a UK TV site yesterday, but removed because it did not meet their rules, had a look on here and to my surprise there it was.

Thanks again. "
,boosh39,2009-10-08T17:42Z,"Yep, it was me. :-) That's why I decided to re-upload it here. No fancy rules."
[T],jack.ss,2009-10-08T18:21Z,"I also saw it come and then disappear on thebox. 
I guessed it was because it's not an UK production, was that why it was removed?"
,boosh39,2009-10-08T18:32Z,"Because I didn't follow the rules closely, including uploading something that's more than 34% Swedish, apparently. I'd love to know by what criteria one measures the exact percentage of a film's national origins. I wonder if the nationality of the caterers counts. Hehe."
,skaleton,2009-10-08T19:55Z,Thanks boosh39. Much appreciated.
[T],jack.ss,2009-10-08T19:59Z,I don't think the nationality of the catering crew matters as long as they eat fish and chips at least 51% of the meals :)
,boosh39,2009-10-08T20:09Z,LOL@jack.ss 
[T],jack.ss,2009-10-08T22:28Z,"If you didn't get to put off by the removal of Annika and want to upload on thebox in the future, there is a place in the forum called 'Site Operations; Can I Upload This?'.. There they will help you to determine if the torrent is OK or not before you post it.
Good luck m8

Can someone seed for a while more to keep this going?  There's a few of us at ~80%... "
,bezeen93,2009-10-21T12:06Z,"Thanx boosh39,

Yes, please do seed a little bit more. Stuck at 84% just like the others =(

I saw this on TPB a few years back and I was not able to get it then, so I really hope I get it now... "
,wendylee,2011-01-28T12:45Z,"I have no idea how this works but, I would love to see this drama serie again so, please make it happen?"
,boosh39,2011-05-08T17:39Z,I see it's had a commercial release.
,bodgg77,2011-09-26T01:24Z,"Wouldnt bother with this, atrocious visual/audio Vhs rip
