,winobie,2009-10-13T08:17Z,"Good picture but playback not so, Duplicate frames cause noticeable jumping or shuddering effect during scenes with camera panning.
Film is still very watchable, just gets on your nerves a little."
,mgmleo,2009-10-13T18:31Z,"I watched this on a very large CRT Sony PAL TV and did not notice the judder you mention, winobie.  Could you give me an example of a scene which has the problem?  Also, what type of TV/DVD setup do you have?  Are you in the UK or US?"
