Now, if there was a film showing that either of these two life support systems for a vagina had their cars tampered with and so ended up a quadripalegic or at least on crutches and out of the media for good, then a Elite conspiracy theory would pack a lot of punch. 

You jokers no I'm right. So remember de Nile is a river in Egypt. "
,Zenman1976,2009-10-07T21:11Z,"This is a good documentary.. 

And if you want to talk about elite groups look no further than the Bilderberg committee for just one example. 

Maybe that should be JiveTalkingClive cause quite frankly your talking complete crap. I would say the only joker here is you but frankly you aint even funny, just tragic. 

Still, if you dont believe something is going on regarding any of what this film speaks of (though you most likely have not seen it) then thats fine. 

Just be sure to get up early so you can be at the front of the line for your precious swine flu shot. "
[T],lkobescak,2009-10-08T02:44Z,"jiveclive, I guess they only mention 'the conspiracy of the elite' in such famous novels as Tragedy and Hope by Carroll Quigley and on the national  news.  I guess you must have missed it watching TMZ or Fox news.  Don't feel bad for not knowing, you probably went to an American school.  I can see why such concepts as gravity and politics could be escape your grasp.  You could always get an education by signing up to the military.  You can also help to ensure that concepts like gravity stay relegated to those ignorant conspiracy nut jobs.  And the answer is yes, I would like fries with that."

@lkobescak LoL

Thx for the up, needs more seeds, this is an important one."
,some-young-guy,2010-09-18T23:55Z,"@clive, it is very obvious that you may be one of the billions of people victimized by massive pacification.  as long as you get a steady stream of what makes you happy, you'll never even consider that things might be out of whack.

Ya can't see through closed eyes.  Enjoy the Budweisers, they're free."
