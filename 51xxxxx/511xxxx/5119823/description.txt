Back in prehistory the world was populated by some of the most amazing creatures that have ever existed. Today, 99% of those animals are extinct. But what if we could bring back some of the animals we have lost? What if extinction didn't have to be forever?

This is an epic journey, following wildlife adventurer Nigel Marven as he overcomes the perils of the past to rescue these lost creatures and bring them back to the sanctuary of the present so they can flourish again.

Assisted by his crack team: Park vet Susanne and head keeper Bob, Nigel finds that rescuing and looking after prehistoric creatures isn't as easy as he first thought!
