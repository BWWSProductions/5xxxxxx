In New York, Mike, at his bachelor party, goes with his troublemaker brother Tony and his friends Carl and Joe to a strip club. However Tony gets in a fight with other costumers and the group is expelled by the bouncers. Tony convinces Mike and his friends to take the subway and go to another bar. There they see the stripper Michelle and her friend Brita, and Carl makes a corresponded move to Michelle. When Tony flirts with Brita, she becomes upset and defends herself with a spray. The train stops in a traffic light at an abandoned station, and Brita forces the door open, leaving the train to breath, followed by the others. However the signal opens and they are left behind in the station. Mike, Tony, Joe and Brita decide to walk through the tunnel to the next station and seek help for Carl. When they reach the next station, they witness a trio of brutal homeless men killing a guard and they run through the tunnel trying to escape from the deranged murderers in the beginning of their nightmarish night.
