Final Draft 8 MAC

1. uncompress file and install the program

2. Use a program like Crossover (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4971142/CrossOver_8_Pro) to open the Windows-based keygen.

3. Generate a customer number with the keygen, install the program.

4. When the program gives you a Challenge Code, put it into the keygen and hit 'generate'. 

5. Put the generated Response Code back into the program.


Program downloaded from the final draft website. The keygen I got from somewhere else.

FULLY tested on my Mac Book Pro (works like a charm).
