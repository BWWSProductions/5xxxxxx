,pussyplunger,2009-10-15T08:45Z,I tried to extract the file on my pc so i can put it all onto a flash drive for my mac but it says some files r corrupted
,pussyplunger,2009-10-16T05:55Z,"how do i extract this, do I remove the .zip or do I try to unzip it?"
,pussyplunger,2009-10-17T03:41Z,Can anyone let me know how to install this?
,niknik1971,2009-10-19T02:14Z,On your mac un-compress the file (I use stuffit to do that). Install it like normal and use the keygen on a windows based system to create the key.
,randycsz,2011-01-19T00:34Z,keygen doesn't work. Waste of time.
,randycsz,2011-01-19T01:13Z,No. I'm an ass. Keygen does work. You just need to find a windows machine to open it.
