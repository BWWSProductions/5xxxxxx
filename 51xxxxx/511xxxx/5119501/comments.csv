I have been downloadiong from Piratebay for years with no problems, recently (last 6 months) not one torrent I've downloaded has worked! Has any one got any ideas? Its getting quite frustrating."

If you've read http://thepiratebay.org/blog you'd know that tpb has shut down the tracker. Get a client that supports PEX and DHT and you're be downloading again in no time.
Have fun."
