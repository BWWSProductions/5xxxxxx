This is the extremely rare (100 units released! Who does that?! Rasputina--that's who.) EP by Rasputina called The Willow Tree Triptych. It consists of 3 songs named "The Willow Tree":

   1. American 2:27
   2. English 2:34
   3. Irish 4:03

I wish that I could have bought this album, seeing as I'm a rabid Rasputina fan, but the world's population minus one hundred people will have to make do with this. Please enjoy, I know I do.
