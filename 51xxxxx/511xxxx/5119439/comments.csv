,Bitchley,2011-10-17T15:03Z,"Excellent series. Video quality is very good, but there are several ""glitches"" where the file freezes and then skips over a chunk of video. Anybody else have the same issue? "

,jemfan313,2012-06-27T02:36Z,"its perfect ,its ntsc  do you have any more seasons?"
,Tallyortoby,2012-07-03T12:53Z,"I wanted to thank you for season 1. I took seasons 2-6 from Dramat.
Dramat gave me the tip concerning smck2009 on youtube.
I found his listing and downloaded all the parts for season 7-8-9 and the 1991 reunion.
I am currently in the process of joining the multiple 5 parts he did for each episode and will seed the 3 seasons as soon as I have finished with that, as it takes quite some time.
The files will be mp4, sorry for that, but I got them from youtube as mp4's. I believe that anyone can get their CPU hot and running to convert them into avi's with 25 framerate and either 640x368 or 624x352 video scale size. "
