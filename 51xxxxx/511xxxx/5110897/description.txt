Budakrist presents - Katt Williams Pimpadelic (2009)

The countrys hottest comedian, Katt Williams (First Sunday, Norbit, Friday After Next), is best known for his laugh-out-loud comedic style and outlandish personality. But what you don t get to see is the real Katt. Pimpadelic features Katt performing some of his funniest material in front of a sold-out crowd 
in Washington D.C. and an extensive rare and never-before seen interview where Katt talks intimately about his family, career, god, his future and the state of the comedy business. This is a must see for every true Katt Williams fan! Pimpadelic also includes a 15-minute never-before-seen bonus performance 
unearthed from Katts personal vault plus 5 bonus clips from one of Katt s lost concert tapes. This DVD is jam packed with funny!

I like to upload shows that are hard to find and not uploaded by anyone else.
