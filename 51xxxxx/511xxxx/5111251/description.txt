This is the full DVD ISO. There are lots of places to get rips I'm sure. The DVD has lots of other troma related stuff on it, but as you own the DVD you already know that. Compressing this seemed pointless, didn't result in any savings, ask the "scene" for a scene release if you need a standards compliant rar nfo la-de-da release.

Hopefully this works okay for a 7gb file in one hit.
