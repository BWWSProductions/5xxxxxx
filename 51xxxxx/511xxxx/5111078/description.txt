                      Release Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1972 there was a guy named Mike Oldfied. He released his first 
solo album "Tubular Bells". Only two long instrumental tracks. 
But what an impact!
-
Ten years later a guy named Hartmut Zinn released his first 
solo album "Heiles Land". Basicly only two long and three short 
instrumental tracks. Every track of this album looks like an free 
Interpretation of an Mike Oldfield track. Especially "Tubular Bells" 
is his inspiration . It looks even more like Mike as Mike himself. 
But no impact at all...
-
No impact, but it could have happened if he had made it 
eleven years earlier :-) It's a nice album and a great one 
to let it hear to a Mike Oldfield fan and say: 
"Hey, I found a really nice Mike bootleg with unreleased songs" . 
Succes guarranteed.
