,dehlanie,2009-10-12T02:24Z,"nice effort and props for taking the time, but someone is doing too good of a job of keeping the album from leaking and too many are doing a good job of releasing bullcrap fakes."
,chunky_norwich,2009-10-12T10:21Z,I don't understand why people upload fakes. Doesn't it just make them look like a bit of a fucktard? :|
,graif00,2009-10-12T18:34Z,"Thanks everyone.

Yes, it's weird that the album isn't leaked yet. Personally, if it isn't leaked before the official release I won't buy the original album, I'll just download it from The Pirate Bay.

If they're so worried for the money I won't give them the pleasure, specially because of the actions taken against the leak of LIFAD (the song).

When Rosenrot was leaked I downloaded it and the day of the official release I bought the original album, but this time I won't because of their stupid policys.

If they want so hard my money I won't give it because they're overambitious."
