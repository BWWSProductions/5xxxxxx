,harnas1977,2009-10-06T19:51Z,"it's episode 3, but the title suggests 4!"
,chair_tard,2009-10-06T20:36Z,"harnas1977, you have it wrong, and the poster is one of the few that have got it right.

""The Tyrant,"" is indeed House S06e04.

The first TWO episodes of season 6 were released on the same night, Broken Pt. 1 & 2 premiered Sept. 21st.

,NaRu7o,2009-10-07T11:37Z,"it is ep 4. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(season_6)#Episodes
when they do a 2 hour special they label them the same title and then drop the parts so people don't get confused. plus when it's aired outside the US they don't always put them together so to most people it IS ep 4 already."
,Barton3CD,2009-10-07T15:18Z,"Could I suggest that instead of bitching wether it is 3 or 4, we all get into the habbit of posting the title, not just the episode number???

That would definitely avoid confusion."
,gosh1221,2009-10-08T03:25Z,yes yes and seed too. no more bitching just seeding
,domdomtom,2009-10-08T12:58Z,BArton 3CD you're right about that.
,Abomity,2009-10-08T22:45Z,"This episode IS episode 3!! NOT 4!!

Ep. 1 - Broken
Ep. 2 - Epic fail
Ep. 3 - The tyrant
Ep. 4 - Instant karma

Ep 4 Instant karma does not air until 12/10/09.

I'll say it AGAIN... This is episode 3, not 4!"
,maplicito,2009-10-09T10:38Z,"As has been explained, it is indeed episode 4.  For those that can not seem to get it - When a series does a double length episode/premiere, often that episode/premiere is considered TWO episodes.

Ep. 1 AND Ep. 2 - Broken
Ep. 3 - Epic fail
Ep. 4 - The tyrant
Ep. 5 - Instant karma

Now, don't forget to read the word AND.  It's not rocket science."
,Abomity,2009-10-09T16:09Z,Guess you're right. My logic had to been shaken that day o.O
,masterac,2009-10-11T01:36Z,"okay all of you who think this is episode 4
SHUT UP
and go to the doctor house official site to see

http://www.fox.com/house/index.htm

and.....o SURPRISE this is....EPISODE 3
and you can see epic fail is episode 2,and then if you think it's not true....or not possible,well then you can go buy a new brain because your eye doesn't send the correct info.

or you can deplug from the matrix and enter the real world.

have a nice day"
,Abomity,2009-10-11T05:56Z,"THSI IS EPISODE 3, NOT 4! "
,Abomity,2009-10-11T23:14Z,"The first 2 episodes was aired as a ""two hour premiere"" in American but as two ""separate"" episodes in other countries like the United Kingdom.

This is ""The Tyrant"" weather it is nr 3 or 4.

I think this episode should be seen as nr 3 since Imdb says so, and because it's an american show and and the 2 first EP's was shown as one 2-hour special in the US.

We will just have to see what number the ""known"" uploaders here and on mininova will name the NEXT episode (instant Karma).

But REALITY is that this episode IS nr 3. Realize it and get over yourselves!"
