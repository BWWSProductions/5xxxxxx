[V],Murlok,2009-10-10T21:22Z,Its a long intro just skip and go to the film if you like! DonÂ´t forget help me seeding Please:)
[V],Murlok,2009-10-10T22:45Z,As soon I got seeders I raise the amount of connections 
[V],Murlok,2009-10-10T23:32Z,I change to initial seeding since I got a ratio  1.7 and still no seeders so those who share will get it right its always up to you
