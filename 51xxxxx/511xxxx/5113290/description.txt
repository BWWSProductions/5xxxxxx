The Houdini 10 will fuckup the older version anyway. Also uninstall the sesi folder (/Library/Preferences/sesi).â€¨Install Houdini 10. But donâ€™t open that yet.â€¨Go to:â€¨/Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinâ€¨And put the sesinetd in the trash. I will ask to authenticate, so type your password.â€¨Now you can drop the cracked sesinetd inside the same folder:â€¨/Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinâ€¨It will ask again to authenticate, so type your password one more time.â€¨Now you need to do the chmod operation. Type:â€¨chmod +w /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinâ€¨chmod +r /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinâ€¨chmod +x /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinâ€¨You donâ€™t need to type all the pathway just drag and drop your sesinetd and it will do the rest for you.â€¨Now WATCH OUT!!! You need to RESTART your machine!!! VERY IMPORTANT!!!!â€¨Okâ€¦ After the restart. Open the License Administrator.app (inside the installed Houdini folder)â€¨Also open the keygen.exe (you can you Darwine app to open .exe inside mac)â€¨Type your server name and server code. (You can find it at the License Administrator app. â€œLicense server hostâ€ and â€œLicense server codeâ€ inside the â€œServer Informationâ€ Tab)â€¨And press generate license.â€¨Go back to License Administrator.â€¨(File/Manually enter keys)â€¨And place your key in there.â€¨It will work now!!! Finally!!!â€¨Reply â€¨

	â–ª	Python says: â€¨May 4, 2009 at 6:06 amâ€¨The chmod operation explained:â€¨When you do those three chmod in the sesinetd, it says to the computer that:â€¨chmod +w (this can be writable)â€¨chmod +r (this can readable)â€¨chmod +x (this can be executable)â€¨w = writeâ€¨r = readâ€¨x = executeâ€¨Now the License Server can work with the sesinetdâ€¨Reply â€¨

No problems at all.â€¨I am new to Mac and the install instructions are very scant.â€¨It says â€œ4.Licensing:â€¨Stop license server (from the license server menu or sesictrl -qâ€â€¨Where is licence server to stop it. I found hserver buried somewhere, but it looked like a terminal window. How do you stop it?â€¨What is â€œsesictrl -qâ€â€¨This is easy on PC just go to services AND STOP THE THING.â€¨Thanks for all you Mac gurus out there who can help me
