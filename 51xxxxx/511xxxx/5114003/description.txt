Armored Saint is a Los Angeles, United States, based heavy metal band.

March of the Saint is the first album by American heavy metal band Armored Saint. It was released in 1984 on Chrysalis Records and recorded with producer Michael James Jackson who previously worked for KISS. The debut album yielded a minor MTV hit with "Can U Deliver?".

In 2006 Rock Candy released remastered version of March of the Saint with additional unreleased demo tracks.

Armored Saint was formed in 1982 by brothers Gonzo Sandoval (drums) and Phil Sandoval (guitar), and guitarist David Prichard, while still enrolled at South Pasadena High School. Next to join were singer John Bush and bassist Joey Vera. Gonzo Sandoval came up with the name after getting stoned with the other band members and seeing the film Excalibur at a theater in Monterey Park. Armored Saint recorded a five song demo that landed the song "Lesson Well Learned" on the compilation album Metal Massacre II. Three of these demo songs were then used for the band's self-titled EP on Metal Blade Records in 1983. The group then signed with Chrysalis Records in 1984.

Armored Saint released their 1984 full length debut album March of the Saint followed by 1985's Delirious Nomad. The debut album yielded a minor MTV hit with "Can U Deliver?". After the release of Delirious Nomad, guitarist Phil Sandoval left the group to explore other possibilities. Their third album, Raising Fear, was recorded by the remaining four members of the band. Unhappy with their lack of success on the Chrysalis label, Armored Saint returned to Metal Blade in 1989.
