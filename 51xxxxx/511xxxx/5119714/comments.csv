Why ruin an otherwise ok torrent with hardcoded subs...... "

10 minutes and 0 seconds blank. Not a second more or less. hehehehe lol.
Average downloadspeed of 2,3MegaByte per second being connected to 22 seeds and no peers.
Audio is in 384kbit a52 (AAC = Dolby Digital). DVD-Audio is 448kbit... but yea.. the audio should be basically flawless. Didn't test it with my 260-dollar headphones yet =)
But yea... the video... i just watched a few seconds in a few scenes. And i could tell that the video wasn't very clear at all D= Could have been a lot better video. But it's definitely worth both downloading and watching.

And as both the torrent-name and torrent info clearly states: This rip is with swesub. IE Swedish subtitles. And yes, they're hardcoded. Take it or leave it. If you don't like it, then gtfo."
