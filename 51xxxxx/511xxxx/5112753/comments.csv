This is an official piratebay remaster ;)

@ micvel
Too much bass do you say, maybe to your ear or media player computer sound card, I do not know : /"
,jaritz,2009-10-14T10:56Z,Awesome remaster...thank you..
[T],torrentguiden,2009-10-24T10:23Z,Enjoy jaritz :D
,DickDickstein,2009-12-03T19:04Z,"Awesome. Thank you sir. Nobody has the original version of Kill Em All anymore. Sadly, I lost my original CD with Blitzkreig and Am I Evil? on it so I have to use digital to have the full album correct :D."
,MegaeviL,2010-04-13T21:43Z,"Metallica haven't remastered any albums. My opinion for that is because James Hetfield can't sing as good anymore, Kirk Hammett can't play all solos the way they are supposed too, Lars doesn't play everything as it should be played and I have nothing to say about Robert..."
,Nirvana95,2010-05-09T21:02Z,"Dude, remastering doesn't mean redoing. It means making the album sound better with what you already have."
