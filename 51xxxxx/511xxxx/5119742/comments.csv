,ryldj,2009-11-24T20:32Z,In my previous comment it meant to read ''PLEASE SEED AND ILL DO THE SAME'' but it somehow came out ''COULD DO THE SAME'' for some unknown reason.

""thepiratebay.org: Error: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it""

""thepiratebay.org: Error: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond""

Can somebody please tell me what this means, and how I can download. I'm using Deluge 1.3.2 since I have too many problems with Utorrent"
