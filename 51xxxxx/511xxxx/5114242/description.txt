15-year-old Max is in search of his father, the famous troubadour Johnny Bigoude, who disappeared shortly after Max's birth. He reaches Saint-Hilare where Madam Doudou, the old teacher, takes care of him and finds him a job as elevator musician in the fly swatter factory Bzzz & Co. But the factory doesn't run well and half of the village gets fired. To boost the swatter sales, a dangerous scientist creates a mass production of flies. Soon, a thick cloud of insects attacks the village... With courage and determination, Max and his new friend FÃƒÂ©licie will do their best to neutralize the insane projects of Bzzz&Co. Will they manage to convince the villagers to help them in this adventure? All together will they stop the scientist's crazy handlings? And will Max find his father?

Max teadis lapsest saadik, et kui ta suureks kasvab, leiab ta kindlasti Ã¼les oma kuulsa isa Johnny Bigoude, kes kadus peale tema sÃ¼ndi jÃ¤ljetult. Aastad lendasid, aga Max ei unustanud oma kauget unistust ja Ã¼hel pÃ¤eval siirdub ta reisile. Teel kutsuva eesmÃ¤rgi poole ootavad poissi hÃ¤mastavad seiklused ja uued truud sÃµbrad.
