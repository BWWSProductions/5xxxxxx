2009 release from the acclaimed singer/songwriter. Back And Fourth marks a new musical chapter in which Yorn has taken a different approach to writing and recording with stunning results. Back and Fourth follows Yorn's first three albums, which he considers a trilogy, and is his first album in three years. Yorn wrote all 10 songs on Back and Fourth and recorded the album in Omaha, NE, with producer Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, Rilo Kiley). Columbia's co-chairman Rick Rubin helped guide the project from its earliest demo stages to final mastering.
