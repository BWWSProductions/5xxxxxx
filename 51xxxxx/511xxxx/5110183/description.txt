Drug War Tells All (1994) which is an insider's confession from a key opporative in Americaâ€™s war against the cocaine cartels. The CIA's "war" on drugs against the cocaine cartels in South and Central America was shrouded in secrecy. Bucchi was recruited by the CIA as a contract agent in 1980. After several years of first hand participation in all of the Agencyâ€™s illegal drug running, he decided to reveal what really went on within the CIA. This is his compelling factual account of the US government's two-faced involvement in the war on drugs. Bucchi was so highly placed that he attended secret meetings with U.S. Government officials like then-Vice President George Bush, CIA director William Casey, and the CIA's Claire George. He had clandestine deals with the notorious "Coke Kings" Pablo Ecsobar, Manuel Noriega and others. He was sent to Korea to feed disinformation to reporter Carl Bernstein. General Noriegaâ€™s lawyer invoked his name on Larry King Live. Bucchi's interview with Sam Donaldson on Prime Time Live was considered too hot to air and was cancelled. Washington Post investigative journalist Carl Bernstein sought him out to discover what he knew about the CIA's illegal drug activities.
