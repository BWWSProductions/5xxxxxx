I was rather disappointed to see only shit-for-quality MP3 rips of this wonderful album, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and rip a high quality version of it.

People, most of you can have both enough bandwidth and hard drive space for high quality rips, why rip and distribute piece of shite MP3s? You can afford to spend a little bit more disk space on FLAC (or some other lossless format), and get much higher audio quality.

Say no to mp3, a decrepit, obsolete format! While I don't advocate at all using lossy formats, if you insist on using one, at least use Vorbis - better quality than mp3.


Anyway, on to the meat of the matter:


1. The Root Of All Evil (Intro) (1:06)
2. Beast Of Man (3:45)
3. The Immortal (3:47)
4. Diva Satanica (3:48)
5. Demonic Science (5:24)
6. Bury Me An Angel 4:25)
7. Dead Inside (4:24)
8. Dark Insanity (3:25)
9. Pilgrim (4:50)
10. Demoniality (Instrumental) (1:40)
11. Transmigration Macabre (3:33)
12. Silverwing (4:22)
13. Bridge Of Destiny (7:53)
14. Bury Me An Angel (Live) (4:22)
15. The Immortal (Live) (4:34)
16. Bridge Of Destiny (Live) (7.36) 

Includes the music video, in fairly decent quality: Beast of Man

Ripped in FLAC, listened to it, quality is perfect, as it should be. Now let's stop using shitty, ancient formats. PLEASE.
