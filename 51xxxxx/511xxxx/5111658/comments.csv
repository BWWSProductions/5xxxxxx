,jimxyz,2009-10-10T20:10Z,"The picture quality seem fine for the short part that can be watched. But it can't played in window mediaplayer, realplayer or quicktime player."
,jimk770i,2009-10-27T18:51Z,"well I think you should download good media players such as VLC, Gom Player, KM Player, AVS DVD Player...You can download these for free and they are far much better than Windows Media Player, Real Player, and Quicktime...Quicktime sucks!
btw, thanks blowley for the upload...
can anyone give a comment about the quality?
thanks!"
,1bluetool,2009-10-30T01:18Z,"For all those who don't know...This is a high def version.  Works great with the Nero media player.  Gives me a msg that says playing high def videos can lead to unexpected results.  But I haven't noticed any.  
V/10+
A/10+

Thanks blowley"

haven't seen this yet, however poster states
Width                            : 800 pixels
Height                           : 320 pixels

that is NOT high definition. HiDef means 720p, which is a pixel height of 720 pixels, or 1080p, again a pixel height of 1080 pixels. @ to poster, rip is only 800 pixels wide (not tall), thus, this ought to be standard definition, aka 420p.

If I were to guess, I'd say this is a rip for iPhone as the pixel dimensions 800x320 < 640x480. "
,chair_tard,2009-11-05T02:13Z,"... and... my guess would be wrong. And posted right there at the top plain as day it reads
Bit rate mode                    : Variable
Bit rate                         : 709 Kbps
Maximum bit rate                 : 4421 Kbps
Width                            : 800 pixels
Height                           : 320 pixels

It's HD and 480p -- bitrate too high for iPhone, but possibly could work on 3GS or another HD portable.

,x264movies,2009-11-28T10:31Z,Dont think too much people. Just download this whether its HD or not. Becuase for 700 MB size this video quality is equivalent to HD. Dont forget this is 2 Hours plus film. So quality rocks.
,dhaa01,2009-12-17T09:26Z,thanks

,smallfry22,2010-04-21T20:11Z,"Thanks awesome DL perfect quality, needed VLC to play though"
,dstar2,2010-09-20T12:41Z,"The quality of this torrent is pretty good in my book. 

However, I can't say I liked the movie itself. The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese, they went through StarTrek canon with a meat cleaver, and the movie has no semblance of scientific realism. I mean, a supernova threatening to destroy the galaxy? Who comes up with this shit?

Overall I'd say its a decent action movie set in space with the 'Star Trek' name, but for a science fiction movie this is all fiction and no science."
,kingjim007,2011-01-28T23:02Z,Poor video quality-NOT widescreen.  Look for better copy.
