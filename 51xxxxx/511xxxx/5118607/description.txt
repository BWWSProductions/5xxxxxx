Story:
Two astronauts, Bower and Payton, wake to find themselves drifting through space 500 million miles from Earth and with no memory of who they are, what they are doing, or what has happened to the crew of their 60,000 passenger sleeper ship the Elysium. They are unable to access the ship's bridge, and cannot communicate with any other members of the crew, including the flight team they are to relieve.[4] While exploring the spacecraft under Payton's radio guidance, Bower encounters several other surviving crew members, and the astronauts start to learn that a terrible event has occurred on board which might have affected the survival of the entire human species.[5]
