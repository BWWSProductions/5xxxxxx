,JonYo,2009-10-11T10:39Z,"80zforever delivers the goods again...

I've had the 7"" vinyl of Robert Hazard's ""Escalator Of Life"" since it was new(ish), and I've always dug both it and it's b-side ""Say Yo"" (digitized them both for ye olde ipod), but I've never actually heard anything else by him ever, so I can't wait to snag this full album that appears to include a live version of ""Say Yo"".  Nicey nice nice, thanks as always for your hard work!"
[V],80zforever,2009-10-11T10:45Z,"JonYo, Robert Hazard was one of the heroes of my restless youth. God bless his soul. Unfortunately the vinyl is not in a very good shape cause I played it to death but it's an amazing record. Did you know Robert Hazard wrote Cyndi Lauper's Girls Wanna have Fun?"
[V],neon,2009-10-11T11:33Z,"and heres another 80s trivia fact,the lead singer of 80s new wave group seona dancing is none other than hollywood hotshot ricky gervais."
,jdenver999,2009-10-11T14:06Z,"Oh yes, afraid of mice! Thank you so much, i've been after this for years!"
,Punkturednoize,2009-10-11T14:59Z,"I don't know any of this artists but somehow, something tells me i've gotta download this and listen to it. I think this is the magic of the 80s. It's almost 30 years past but it still feels like it's just around the corner holding on to our youth."
,erikphnx,2009-10-12T16:25Z,Awesome! Eight of them! Thanks !
