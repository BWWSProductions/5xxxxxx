South Park meets The Daily Show in this irreverent, animated satire about war, TV, womenâ€™s rights and religious extremism. Based on the hit stage musical that the San Francisco Bay Guardian called, â€œsmartly written, consistently funny, and well-acted,â€ Bye Bye Bin Laden! follows the exploits of Osama bin Laden after deciding he needs a hit TV show to boost the Talibanâ€™s waning popularity. Will it be Osama of Mayberry, I Love Prakhbar, or Ask the Taliban â€“ The Game Show Where the Taliban Provides the Answers?

Not to be outdone, the Bushes fight back with The George and Jenna Comedy Hour, a variety show fully equipped with dancing crucifixes and Jenna wearing some highly patriotic hot pants.

Packed with off-color humor that skewers everyone from politicians to the media, Bye Bye Bin Laden! finds a way to offend just about everyone while having an outrageously good time.
