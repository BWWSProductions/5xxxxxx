A) There is audio... the empty audio_ts folder is a holdover from the Stone Ages

B) It's a DVD, get over it... if you want something smaller do a search and you'll find about a zillion copies of this whole series both as single files and as a pack... I find several in several formats, but mostly .avi files.

C) Really? You're sniveling about screens on a full DVD? Geeze, you're on the fucking internet, do a search and look for the commercial links... you'll find out plenty."
