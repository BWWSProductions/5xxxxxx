,k3nd00d,2009-10-09T16:51Z,"Far too many people are failing to seed after they get to 100%. I and the few who are still seeding need help. If people fail to help, I will need to take this down, as it is not fair for only a small handful of people continue seeding despite the several dozens of people leeching."
,cpaero,2009-12-09T22:43Z,"true that k3nd00d; will seed..

this collection needs to be shared;  alone in the wilderness is one of those unknown films everyone falls in love with the first time they see it.  dick proenneke's hard work and craftiness, and his appreciation for the beauty of nature, are so inspirational!

thanks so much for making this available! "
,shotgunjesus,2009-12-26T05:44Z,IS THIS THING CURRUPT I CANT GET IT TO WORK. I MOUNT IT IN POWER ISO AND NO PLAY. WHAT GIVES? dOES IT NEED TO BE BURNED TO FUNCTION OR SHOULD I BE ABLE TO PLAY IT FROM MY VIRTUAL DRIVE LIKE NORMAL?
,shotgunjesus,2009-12-26T05:46Z,never mind it seems to play in micro shaft media player. not ideal but it'll do fornow. thanks anyway
,k3nd00d,2010-01-01T16:34Z,"This is fine. Nobody else has had any problem. BTW, I consider burning to and playing from DVD to be more ""normal"" than using a virtual drive emulator."
,thijzzz,2010-01-15T20:12Z,"Nicely done, thanks. (Am seeding right now as requested.) Just can't get the sound to work. I'm playing it on WM Player on WinXP, any idea would I could be doing wrong?"
,k3nd00d,2010-02-13T11:19Z,"This has AC3 audio, as shown in description. Any DVD player can play this. When playing on an OS from 2003 (XP), you may not have AC3 audio driver/codec installed. I suggest you find and install that. Try http://ac3filter.net/projects/ac3filter"
,dzlrules,2010-04-05T20:22Z,"Thank You, k3nd00d!!! Just found this doc and downloading it now. I'll report back if any problems but I expect it to be great... Will help seed, though my speed won't set any records. lol"
,trampin,2010-09-13T19:57Z,"What a hero, this guy is an idol.

I shall seed if i ever get to download it. 

Q. does this have frozen north within the ISO because this is all I'm after?"
,biggusdaddius,2010-12-03T06:28Z,"Amazing that you have made this available on TPB! Cannot thank you enough. I will continue to seed because as it was so aptly put, EVERYONE should have a chance to experience this. Very cool!"
,WinstonWas,2010-12-31T12:21Z,Why upload all three videos as one Iso?  WTF?  
,k3nd00d,2011-01-09T06:03Z,"Umm, why not?"
,pizton,2011-01-22T18:23Z,"I sure hope this is ntsc and will burn ok, I am planning to burn it just as a regular Iso as I see no other instructions. Will continue to seed and report back after done dl."
,pizton,2011-02-22T02:49Z,Thanks alot k3nd00d! Burned fine with great menus!
,jotah,2011-03-16T07:10Z,excelent movies! very inspiring!
,alstewart,2011-03-16T22:25Z,Great rip! Thank you!
,iplay360,2011-09-07T06:05Z,I will be seeding...
,elmochilero,2011-09-07T10:38Z,thanks a lot and seeding every night (West Coast N America)
,ArtyCO_oL,2011-10-05T21:59Z,I will seed for a long time. Thank you very much for this DVD collection
,BRIAN_1,2011-11-27T05:34Z,"10/10

great torrent!! I will seed for weeks. Thank you so much!!

If you could add ""Alone 2"" to this it would be awesome."
,YardBoy,2011-12-04T15:50Z,"Thanks, will re-seed >1 [currently at 0.64].  Unfortunately, not quite what I wanted.  After reading the nicely detailed Description, I believed the 4 files were 3 MPEG2 and a PDF.  Only after downloading did I discover the 3 films in a single 4.3GB ISO.  To better plan, leechers should notice the summary at the beginning of TPB listing where it says ""Files: 4"".  Carefully see that the single digit ""4"" is hyperlinked.  Onlly if you click this ""4"" AND scroll down towards the Comments will you find a new box that lists the true contents of the download.  Whew  ;^)"
,YardBoy,2011-12-10T20:23Z,"Thanks for forcing me to learn how to burn an .iso to DVD.
I've now re-seeded 3.80X"
,AngerBot,2012-01-29T17:45Z,"Hi, new to this. I take it I need to wait until people are online seeding? When I first opened BT there were three seeders but they immediately stopped. Do I need to wait until 100% to seed? Thanks for the UL k3ndood."
,k3nd00d,2012-02-07T21:36Z,"@YardBoy:
Apparently you missed the fact this is in the ""Movies DVDR"" category and the statement at the top of the detailed description that states ""DVD collection of all 3 Dick Proenneke related documentary videos. With working DVD menus.""

And about forcing you to learn how to burn ISO files, I did not force you to do anything, but I am glad you learned something new.

@AngerBot:
Typically a person is referred to as a seeder if they continue to allow people to download from them after they get 100% of the torrent downloaded. The truth is that normally you are also seeding while you are leeching (downloading) prior to getting 100% of the torrent, as well. I do hope you got the files downloaded, it may take a bit of time for you to get more acquainted with torrent. Good luck!"
,k3nd00d,2012-02-07T21:37Z,"@BRIAN_1: What is ""Alone 2""? Do you have a link to a torrent or a wiki entry or anything to show me? I thought these 3 videos were all there was from Proenneke."
,AngerBot,2012-02-08T23:35Z,"Kendood, thank you. I managed to get Alone in the WIlderness 2. I just left it in BT at 100% to reseed for others. There doesn't seem to be any upload activity though. Not sure if I need to do something else.

Still waiting to complete this file. I only have a tiny %. Getting a seed for this seems to be hit and miss. Thanks for providing though much appreciated."
,k3nd00d,2012-02-09T14:27Z,"Ah, I see ""Alone in the Wilderness 2"" was released fairly recently. I may go back and look at making a DVD with all 4 videos, some day. Not sure. As for getting this torrent completely downloaded, there are plenty of seeders now...so, it shouldn't be a problem."

:D again, thanks for the awesome DVD"
