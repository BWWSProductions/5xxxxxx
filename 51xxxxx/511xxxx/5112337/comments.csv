TX MDK FOR THIS, IS THE THIRD TORRENT I TAKE FROM YOU IÂ´LL SEED ABOUT 1 MONTH,CHEERS"
,LeonBlade,2009-10-08T09:08Z,"Woah woah woah guitargamery...
What the hell is your problem bro?
He was only wondering where you put the DLL file (as do I) and not once was he being rude like you are over here... I think you should calm down a little bit...

Thanks for the crack, I was waiting for someone to release this!  I also need to figure out where my VST Plugin folder is..."
,LeonBlade,2009-10-08T09:12Z,"Okay, the VstPlugins for me was located in:
C:\Program Files\VstPlugins
Lol like he said... thanks for the crack again!"
,JBmyi,2009-10-08T18:45Z,"first and foremost THANK YOU mdk504!!! i really do appreciate this...try before i buy has never done me wrong

Secondly to guitargamery Choke on a dead dick and die a$$hole!!!"
,JBmyi,2009-10-08T18:47Z,"...and like i said, i was able to place the .dll crack in the vst dir. but was having a little trouble because i was still getting the activation/ trial period jazz...yet again thanks"
,JBmyi,2009-10-08T18:54Z,thanks again...working great! will seed at least 150%
,JBmyi,2009-10-08T21:08Z,Anyone know if you can use this with the line in jack on the soundcard of the pc? can't seem to get it to work...thanks
,gringopig,2009-10-09T19:35Z,"@JBmyi

I don't think you will have any luck using yr internal soundcard. This is designed as a standalone app for use with USB hardware and ASIO drivers (like this: http://line6.com/podstudiogx/). It's pretty cheap and well worth the price.

You can also use this app as a VST plugin in yr favourite DAW.

Low latency drivers are a must with this software - yr standard soundcard will not be suitable.

Correct me if I'm wrong?

:-)

Thanks BTW mdk504 - much appreciated!!"
,mdk504,2009-10-09T22:20Z,"@JBmyi

you wont get very great results using an onboard sound card. my best advice is get a DI box. do like i did and get a line6 tone port, throw away the line6 software cuz its junk, then use that w/guitar rig. you prolly wont need the ux2 like i have but they have a cheaper one.

and guys no need for the violence, its just a torrent, albeit prolly one of the only gr4 ones out there right now, but still a torrent. thanks are appreciated but seeds are better. thanks people. keep the scene alive."
,belyshev,2009-10-10T18:51Z,"This is the standard VST location:

C:\Program Files\Steinberg\VstPlugins

Most all programs that support VTS's will look in this directory.  If the directory does not exist, then create it and copy VST dll's there."
,honestlyidontknow,2009-10-21T12:20Z,"Thanks mdk 504, heads up peeps, there are no viruses or malware in this torrent, and it installs as youd expect, thanks again mate"
,scuzzo,2009-10-21T17:14Z,"ok this is amazing stuff,, and big ups to posting it up....

but i have a question..
where is the Cool Plex amp?
seems to be missing..  did they send out an upgrade to add the cool plex amp?

any how works great no probs works in sonar 8 also..  and you are able to port guitar rig 3 presets to 4. with little issue..

great post.."
,mdk504,2009-10-23T00:40Z,"to import gr3 banks to gr4 you must open the gr4 stand-alone app, file/import and make sure the proper file format is selected to view and select your gr3 banks."
,mdk504,2009-10-23T00:41Z,"oh and about the Cool Plex... i really dont know. i only use it for a few of the amp models and that isnt one of them, sorry i couldnt be of more help w/that issue."
,scuzzo,2009-10-23T17:33Z,"na got it figured out..  its an upgrade that NI is sending out..  so unless some one is able to seed the upgrade i dont think we have access.. but no matter its an amazing program.  and most of my GR3 presets did port over.. although the time setings and such were scrapped..  but still a freaking cool little program,,

thanks for the ups.."
,guitargamery,2009-11-05T05:31Z,"shut up you fag jbmi and leonblade my ass!! now you are just like wow wow thank u ..just wanna know thi or that! but you are that kind of mule that dont say tanks and dont know how to copy a crack into vstplugin folder--first of all your first aproach should be always(like i always!!always do!!!!) to thank the man who took his time and his pc to initiate sharing files with the others!! and jbmyi if you read ""the dll goes in your predetermined vst plugin folder"" you just had do it, but u r just like that kids...tell me this tell me that, how to....??? man thats to much retarded for the 21 century, period! and fu*** you, sorry about this mdk504 but i had to speak with thi kid again! mdk504 tx once again im producing lots of stuff in cubase 5 with this sounds so im greatfull to you and to the craker who did it otherwise i had to use the effects from my boss gt-5 or from the cubase 5, but this is way better!!!cheers"

thanks"
,tacyarts,2009-11-17T08:32Z,"hi. 
royalroasho

start your HOST PROGRAM-then start GUITAR RIG 4. STAND ALONE-maybe after that your VST.DLL is reg.

try.a new host= NUENDO 3

10/4



"
,Whammo,2009-11-19T01:39Z,Don't listen to these guys... If you have a halfway decent soundcard you can use a neat little program called ASIO4All which will let you have really low latency. I have mine set to 6ms with no hiccups.
,scuzzo,2009-11-21T16:09Z,"ok having great fun with this, so much so im pretty much ampless just using this and my podxt..  but any way...

there is a new upgrade out with a new amp- Cool Plex,, and some other enhancements.. any chance of getting that posted to Pirate BAY?

that would be really geat!!

anyhow.. thanks for the really cool ups..  "
,Yaguazo,2009-11-22T01:23Z,"In response to royalroacho 's comment, same thing is happening to me in Pro Tools.  I think the .dll hack won't work because Guitar Rig 4 needs a .dpm file hack instead.  Not vst instead it's an RTAS.  If anyone has suggestions to use this Guitar Rig 4 as an RTAS in ProTools please help us.  Right now I can only use as a DEMO not full version and asks for an authorization.  THANX!"
,chedass,2009-11-22T04:46Z,"When i install the program, i get all the gr4 presets, using the demo!

,Oatixe,2010-01-04T02:32Z,"For people having problems with this crack, I've seen another torrent site where the uploader stated in the details that users need to disconnect from internet to use.

In other words, the crack fixes registration, but the app verifies the registration and invalidates the crack.

So use a firewall, or disconnect from the 'net.

If anyone is using a firewall, please post back the IP(s) it tries to connect to so people can add to their host files."
,breki78,2010-01-06T14:58Z,thx mdk504 Great!
,U_Rebel_Scum,2010-01-11T08:27Z,"Works like a charm in Sonar 8.  Simply run the instalation, then place the guitar rig 4.exe in the program folder (NI\gtrrig4\) and the .dll file into where your vst plugins are (cakewalk\sonar8\vst plugins\)  and you are set to go, no activation required!

Make sure you replace the exe. and the .dll file correctly BEFORE you open the application, it should work fine.

Thanks mdk504 nice work!"
,ragman420,2010-11-10T00:46Z,"@ Beartheshadows  I had the same problem with the presets.  Here's how I solved it.  Go to your Documents folder an d open the Native Instruments folder.  Inside the Guitar Rig 4 folder drag the Db folder out onto your desktop then go into the Shared Content folder  that's also in the Native Instruments folder and drag the Sounds folder out on your desktop.  Restart Guitar Rig 4 and it will rebuild these 2 folders giving you all your factory presets then you can delete the ones off your desktop.  You could just delete them from their original locations, but I had you put them on your desktop in case you didn't trust my method :)
