SEDORA SAYS: â€œThere's platinum lightning in the sky, Look I'm livin' like a queen. This kind of love is getting expensive, We know how to live baby. We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton, We're so rich in love we're rollin' in cashmere. Got it in fifth gear baby, Diamond in the rough is looking so sparkly.â€
