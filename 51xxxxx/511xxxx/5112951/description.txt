Watch out! Eddie's back in town! 

The famous horror-clown Eddie is back in Walibi World during the 2009 Halloween Fright Nights. From October 17th till November 1st, every friday, saturday and sunday the theme park will be the place to be if you are into Halloween. 

This year there will be a new character at the park: The Gravedigger. In this torrent you will find his videoclip Eddie's Back in Town. several dutch celebrities are in this video, like Marijke Helwegen, Ellen ten Damme and Jasmine Sendar. 

This video is also a tribute to Michael Jackson's Thriller. It's in a .VOB format so you can watch it full screen in a very nice quality.

I also captured the song and turned it into .mp3 with bitrate 320kbs. This song is without all the talking.
