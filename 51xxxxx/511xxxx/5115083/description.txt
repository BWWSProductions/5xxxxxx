'Crazy Love', Michael BublÃ©'s first CD in two and a half years, features two original songs along with his always original take on 11 standards from various eras.

The multi-Grammy winning artist hunkered down in recording studios in LA, Brooklyn, New York and his hometown of Vancouver for the last six months to make his 'ultimate record about the inevitable roller coaster ride of relationships.' The first single, 'Haven't Met You Yet,' written by BublÃ© (with Alan Chang and Amy Foster) is scheduled to be released to radio on August 31st. Additional tunes on the album include 'Cry Me A River,' 'You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You,' 'Georgia On My Mind' and 'Baby (You've Got What It Takes)' which was performed with Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings. The title song is a cover of the Van Morrison gem 'Crazy Love.' The CD closes out with a haunting version of 'Stardust' which is performed with the acapella group Naturally 7. The album was produced by David Foster, Bob Rock and Humberto Gatica.
