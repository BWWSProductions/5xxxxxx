,garuto101,2009-10-12T08:26Z,Thankyou so much for this Jack Black and Ossie osbourne ( i hope thats how u spell it) are Legends!
,garuto101,2009-10-12T08:53Z,but why is this so slow? on a torrent i was downloading earlier I was getting 180kbs (im new to torrents). Does anyone know how to speed it up?
,ShineEyes,2009-10-12T09:47Z,"@garuto101
Probably an issue with your net.  This finished for me in less than 12 hours.  Check your firewall, make sure the port for your torrent program is properly forwarded.  Make sure you're not on dialup :P Mostly kidding.  Sometimes they go fast, sometimes they go slow.  Just let it run and it'll finish.  That kind of speed for a torrent isn't half bad.  Any time I get 50+ kb/sec I count myself lucky.  On average for well seeded movies/music you might get as high as 800 or so kb/sec, who knows."

,BlindMaphisto,2009-10-13T06:20Z,"Not gonna be downloading because I'm picking this one up at the store tomorrow. I loved the Demo so much and know the creator of this has made such legendary games in the past that I will cherish this one for a very long time. At least I hope so. The multiplayer also looks surprisingly interesting.

Anyway thanks to the uploader for helping spread a great game and I hope the rest of you consider picking up a copy to support the creators. "
,Douche88,2009-10-13T18:46Z,"Same for me, I'm buying this game.  Not only is this game worth ur money, but we also need to help inventive game makers like Tim Shaefer... if we want more studios to take risks and make original fun games, we need to support them.

So if u like this game and want a sequel, please make sure u buy it!"

,ShinoBoy,2009-10-15T05:51Z,"Question about another game actually (sorry, nobody responding elsewhere).  I burnt 'Prince of Persia' off of TPB (the ALLStars copy) using Imgburn at 2x speed on a Verbatim disc, and the game loads the menus and stuff fine, then freezing on the loading screen after selecting a New Game.  

Anyone know a way around this?  Sorry for the offtopic, but help would be appreciated! Thanks!"
