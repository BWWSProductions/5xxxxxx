Elle (Isabelle Adjani) is a provocative and extremely feisty nineteen year old, who returns to her home Provencal village with her crippled father and German mother. 
The normally sleepy village is jolted by her arrival, especially the menfolk who are mesmerised by her looks, and Elle is not shy of all the attention.  
Gradually, her true personality and purpose emerges. The film reaches its violent conclusion when Elle's dark secret is discovered.
