Description:  You Want Blood You've Got It is the first live album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, originally released in the U.S.A. on 21 November 1978. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.

The album was recorded live during the 1978 Powerage Tour and contains live versions of songs from AC/DC's T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock, and Powerage albums. It is the last Bon Scott-era AC/DC album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, who also produced the band's first five studio releases.

The album was re-released in 1994 on Atco Records and in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.
