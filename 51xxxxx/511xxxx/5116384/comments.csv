(normalize at 0 db, with VST compressor you can fix if something
needed (treblles,bass,high's), before using it in other's. To work with MixMaister 5, you have to
configure it, (in tools snap to beat, in edit>track>beat mixing), than
you can control the waves in milisec and move mix positions. In
playlist you can change properties like bpm and down in timeline, you can coppy -
paste tempo to match waves between tracks. In effects choose
compressor. Try, and you will see how good mix you can make. When you
finished, export playlist to mixed files in waw and in Wavelab compress to mpg with tools>batch file
encoding at 192 kbps. Virtual DJ is for live performing, and if you have an external sound card (to have main and phones out), it's a baby game. Mixed In Key is good to learn about harmonic mixing. See on their site. I know, there is new versions, or other software's, but with these, you have total control. Hope it's helpfull. See you.    Aladin"

+ some old versions are faster, better & flawless(in case of basic functioning)"
[T],aladinko,2010-02-12T08:37Z,"Yes, you're right, there is a lot of new software out, but not always mean that are better, the main thing that you get what exactly you want, as much manualy possible in DeeJaying and audio edit is. The main problem stays to find a good working 64 Bit versions of Apps. "
