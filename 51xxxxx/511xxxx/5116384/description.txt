This is all you need for mastering and mixing. It's tested, clean and working good. I'am using this manny years and have tryed all other's, believe me this 3 programs is the best and when you learn how to work with it, with a little talent for music, you can be a pro D.J. Also for advanced, suggesting Mixed In Key Program. If you need any help just mail to me.
