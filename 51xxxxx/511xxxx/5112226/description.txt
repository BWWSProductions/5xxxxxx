--------------------

Dexter the Game is the killer 3D iPod Touch / iPhone game based on the Showtime Original Series. Dexter Morgan is a serial killer. Driven by his need to kill, maintaining his average-guy faÃ§ade has never been easy. He spends his days as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami police department, but itâ€™s after hours when Dexter is able to fulfill the needs of his dark passenger, exacting his own brand of justice on those criminals who truly deserve to die.

In the game, help Dexter choose his next victims while always protecting his identity. Analyze crime scenes, uncover evidence and use stealth tactics to stalk your prey. Is the case best served by the courts or the Dark Passenger? The outcome of every choice and action revolves around the Code of Harry: only kill the guilty, maintain the mask, and above all, donâ€™t get caught!

Play the game and WIN A WALK-ON ROLE TO SEASON 5!! Lunch with the show's writer or one of many instant prizes including DVDs and t-shirts! To get a code, purchase Dexter the Game from the iTunes App Store. See www.dexterthegame.com for official rules. No purchase necessary.
