It can be found here:

,bugmeless,2009-10-10T19:55Z,"I did wonder where last week's part 2 went.  I found it on isohunt, and tried to upload it here, also to no avail.  I also tried adding 10/09, but that didn't work either.  Another long wait for that to get fixed I suppose.

Thanks for keeping it up.  Appreciate the sensible (i.e. not 4MB) piece sizes."
