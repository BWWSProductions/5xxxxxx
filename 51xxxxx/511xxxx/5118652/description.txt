When Archie the rabbit (voiced by Hugh Laurie, Stuart Little) and his friends find themselves on one of the most exciting Christmas adventures ever, anything can and will happen! Archie and his friend Duke the guinea pig (voice of Mark Williams) find themselves moping about in their barn during Christmas Eve. Their boredom is brought to a screeching halt when a present from Santa's sleigh falls to earth and crashes right through their home's roof! The present is addressed to a child named Polly, and with the help of Babs the hamster (Barbara Windsor), Archie and Co. will deliver this package no matter what obstacles are in their paths! But it won't be easyâ€”along the way are such treacheries as the winter weather and a very persistent cat who wants to make a Christmas meal out of Archie! Get into the Christmas spirit by grabbing a hot mug of cocoa and following the Second Star to the Left.
