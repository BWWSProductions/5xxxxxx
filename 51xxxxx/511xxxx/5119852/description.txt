In the book The Regent of Carthage, which went on sale on Thursday, journalists Nicolas Beau and Catherine Graciet describe the â€œkey roleâ€ of Leile Trabelsi in shaping Tunisian policy. They also fire a broadside at what they call â€œFranceâ€™s complicity of silenceâ€.

Trabelsi had called for the injunction of the book as well as a withdrawal of any copies that had already been issued as they contained â€œsome passages that are defamatory and others that are injurious.â€

The court rejected the request on Wednesday, saying that she had failed to identify the sections in law that backed up her claim. This meant the defendants were unable to organise their defence.
