help"
,pegapalo,2009-10-08T16:23Z,so is this the x64 cclloyd? downloading it now going pretty fast at 1.3 mb so it will take around 2 hours to finish. Will seed 24/7 for a week or so. hope it works!! 
,pegapalo,2009-10-08T16:36Z,"grrr someone stop seeding,, now my download is a 100 b. it will take me to the end of time to download"
,cclloyd,2009-10-08T22:14Z,Im sorry for any delay.  Im the only seeder and just recently uploaded the other torrents u see in the description.  I want to get at least 1 seed other than me and the fastest way to do that is one at a time.  If you want this than please wait till tomorrow 10/9.  I will start seeding as i wil lhave other seeds on my other torrents by then.
,thewinwizard,2009-10-08T23:11Z,Thank you for the response and thank you for the torrent.
,the5count,2009-10-09T00:35Z,Appreciate the W7 torrents- will download and try them out
,Aff3cti0n,2009-10-10T00:28Z,"Thank you for this Torrent  but have you began seeding it again? Mine's been at 10.2% for 12 hours,

If I can get it downloaded fully I'll be happy to seed,

Thanks for the torrent though I'm very excited for Windows 7."
,cclloyd,2009-10-10T02:30Z,Yea im sorry for the longer than expected delay.  the x64 edition collection is taking longer than expected to get a seed.
,Aff3cti0n,2009-10-10T03:20Z,"No problem I'm more than willing to wait especially since this sounds very promising,

one question though,

Is this preactivated? Or does it need a code or something?
"
,thewinwizard,2009-10-10T13:44Z,I'll seed it as well. I appreciate your efforts mate.
,cclloyd,2009-10-11T00:17Z,None of my torrents on an operating system are pre activated.
,pizzaboy9990,2009-10-13T14:39Z,is this the 90 day trail version from microsoft....
,cclloyd,2009-10-14T04:26Z,No this is the unactivated copy of the DVD that you would buy.

,A.Y.G.M,2010-03-23T06:00Z,"How you burned this to a DVD? since a DVD have only 4.7 GB of space...? and Enterprise does not means that it don't need activation or CD key? i have xp enterprise and is like that! no CD key required, activation is done properly trough internet and pass the WGA Microsoft test. Cuz is a original enterprise edition..."
,A.Y.G.M,2010-03-23T06:07Z,"Oh hell!... sorry dude, just saw the torrent... it has both, the 64bit edition and 32 bit edition..."
