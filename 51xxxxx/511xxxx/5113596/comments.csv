,Logan_5,2009-10-08T08:44Z,"V:8 - Actually not bad at all for a CAM release

A:7 - A bit to bass heavy which makes it distorted in parts when turned up loud but otherwise alright

M:5 - It's another zombie flick in a long line of them. Nothing earth shaking new going on here but still a good way to kill some time.

Thanks for the up extremezone.. :)"

,Logan_5,2009-10-09T08:03Z,"@extermezone

I gave u a compliment and all you can do is be insulting??

FUCK YOU ASSHOLE!! I will NEVER download another of your movies ever again. You are one ungrateful son of a bitch..you don't deserve respect when you act like a dick

Your rips are good but you really need to lose your attitude mate.. It's no wonder that many people in the scene don't seem to care for you very much....

I guess u are so used to people fucking with you that you never considered that MAYBE I meant to say telesync instead of cam. Did u ever consider instead of being an asshole that maybe it was an honest mistake?? Not like I could go back and edit my post now could I...

Let me say it again so it sinks in: FUCK YOU and your attitude you sanctimonious son of a bitch."

,Logan_5,2009-10-13T00:17Z,"@ all those who don't like what I said to extremezone...

extremezone decided to insult me by calling me a noob for no good reason, never thinking that maybe I used a wrong word when reviewing this torrent & couldn't go back & edit it. 

Mistakes do happen so it shouldn't have been a big deal.

He/she even admitted ""i thought you only want to spam like others my torrents because this is not a CAM as you say'd so...be ""on topic"" and stop posting false informations"" again not considering it was a simple mistake & that I couldn't edit my post. He/she assumed something & as a result was wrong. 

Because of that extermezone has lost my respect forever but could probably care less. 

I don't need to ""spam these forums"" with 'false informations', I hate that when I cone to TPB and see a torrent w/ 15 pages of comments and only 2 or 3 of them are actually relevant, the rest being trash talking & racism and spam.

Respect is earned not something to be freely given to whomever rips a movie the best or does it first before anyone else does... aXXo & the old scene never would have attacked anyone like I was.... It doesn't matter what he called me, the fact is that if you want people to treat you right and come back to YOUR content again and again, you don't do what was done to me....period.

Yes, I know this is just a website dealing in pirated content and it's free so stop yer whining & complaining...etc...etc... but at the end of the day, there are plenty of people other then extremezone offering the same stuff on the 'net (& this site) so he/she needs to consider that before acting like an ass & losing a person who could have helped him/her by spreading the good word about their releases.

I have nothing to say about the quality of the work, (IT IS USUALLY VERY GOOD) but I do have concerns about the quality of the person...  "

,Anthosjazz,2009-10-13T12:45Z,"@Logan_5 I actually laughed out loud when I read your first comment. He thought you were spamming and giving us the wrong information (when he called you a noob he didn't know that you made a mistake and he couldn't edit his comment either). Either way you went WAY too far, he called you a NEW PLAYER? and you said he was that he was an  ""ASSHOLE!!"" ""one ungrateful son of a bitch""a ""sanctimonious son of a bitch.""  and said ""FUCK YOU"" a couple of times. I've gotten called a noob seven times this month, its barely even a insult"

Scene:  A cafe.  One table is occupied by a group of Vikings wearing horned helmets.  Whenever the word ""spam"" is repeated, they begin singing and/or chanting.  A man and his wife enter.  The man is played by Eric Idle, the wife is played by Graham Chapman (in drag), and the waitress is played by Terry Jones, also in drag. 
Man: You sit here, dear.  
Wife: All right. 
Man: Morning! 
Waitress: Morning! 
Man: Well, what've you got?

Vikings: Spam spam spam spam... 
Waitress: ...spam spam spam egg and spam; spam spam spam spam spam spam baked beans spam spam spam...

Waitress: ...or Lobster Thermidor a Crevette with a mornay sauce served in a Provencale manner with shallots and aubergines garnished with truffle pate, brandy and with a fried egg on top and spam. 
Wife: Have you got anything without spam? 
Waitress: Well, there's spam egg sausage and spam, that's not got much spam in it. 
Wife: I don't want ANY spam! 
Man: Why can't she have egg bacon spam and sausage? 
Wife: THAT'S got spam in it! 
Man: Hasn't got as much spam in it as spam egg sausage and spam, has it? 
Vikings: Spam spam spam spam... (Crescendo through next few lines...) 
Wife: Could you do the egg bacon spam and sausage without the spam then? 
Waitress: Urgghh! 
Wife: What do you mean 'Urgghh'? I don't like spam! 
Vikings: Lovely spam! Wonderful spam! 
Waitress: Shut up! 
Vikings: Lovely spam! Wonderful spam! 
Waitress: Shut up! (Vikings stop) Bloody Vikings! You can't have egg bacon spam and sausage without the spam. 
Wife: I don't like spam! 
Man: Sshh, dear, don't cause a fuss. I'll have your spam. I love it. I'm having spam spam spam spam spam spam spam beaked beans spam spam spam and spam! 
Vikings: Spam spam spam spam. Lovely spam! Wonderful spam! 
Waitress: Shut up!! Baked beans are off. 
Man: Well could I have her spam instead of the baked beans then? 
Waitress: You mean spam spam spam spam spam spam... (but it is too late and the Vikings drown her words)

,darkfreedom,2009-10-30T20:32Z,"First, I'd like to say if you are experiencing black or partially green screen for the video but the sound is there, you need to check or update your codecs.

Second, for those of us who give AXXO the respect he deserves, he is still here and uploading movies. As always he only releases dvd rips, not ts or other filmed at the theater with a camcorder type torrents. He did leave for a while, but returned with the DVD release of (appropriate titled movie considering his status here) I am Legend. 

So check your codecs, enjoy the torrents, give AXXO his ""props"" as u see fit, Pirate Bay Forever!!

Oh, by the way... This is a pretty good quality as far as telesyncs go. I'll keep this one till the dvd rips begin to surface. Thanks extremezone!"
