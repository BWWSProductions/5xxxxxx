New album from Burton C. Bell and Dino Cazeres of Fear Factory.

I was searching for days trying to find this but mostly through private torrents and that no good to me so for all you like me here is a hastle free way of having the most exciting album I have heard all year! It's getting close to topping All Hope Is Gone. Anyway after I listened to it all that time searching was well worth it, hope you all enjoy.

It ripped from CD at 320kbps sounds awesome!

Peace.
