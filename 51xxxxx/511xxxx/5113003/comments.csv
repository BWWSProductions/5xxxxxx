I've installed the latest version of Daemon Tools Lite (4.30.4) on my Vista x64 machine.
The first odd thing occurs already when I mount the mini-image: the setup doesn't start automatically as it usually does when mounting something.
When I manually browse to the setup.exe and double-click it I'm getting somethinig like the following error message

""The file is not compatible with this Windows version. Open the system information to check whether a x86 (32 Bit) or x64 (64 Bit) version is required and contact the software distributor""

Every help would be greatly appreciated!"

,thovader,2009-10-08T06:14Z,"Thanks for your comments but I just found out that this torrent is NOT the actual game but just the English language pack for the Russian game!

So as long as you don't have the Russian game installed and wanna change the language to English, do NOT download this torrent!"
,tHe.WeBmInStEr,2009-10-13T12:47Z,"Ok guys, this is IT! This really is the english version, NOT the full game but just the English  Audio, just finished testing it! Menus, Audio, Subtitles, ALL in English!

So, DL any RUS version, Install it, then when u've Dowloaded this torrent just do this:

1. Extract all files, copy the ""data"" files from this download to your Risen ""data"" directory. For example: ""C:\games\Risen\data""

2. Mount the image included in the ""mini-image"" folder.

3. Violรก! You can now play the game, without a crack (hence the image) and totally in English!

Tks Anonymous LOL HF Guys :)"
