,PawnSacrifice,2009-12-04T10:14Z,"Great upload. Will be seeding this for some time.

I couldn't get The Living Dead ( 1995 ) to play though. Anyone else had trouble with this?"
,farfignugen,2009-12-30T22:53Z,"@PawnSacrifice: I managed to get The Living Dead to play with VLC and mplayer. Try those.

Also, the FFdshow codec will probably work (since it uses the same decoders as mplayer and VLC). The easiest way to install it is by installing CCCP (http://www.cccp-project.net/)

And thanks whoever uploaded this! Great documentaries!"

,bazquux,2011-08-29T23:24Z,"Curtis has a lot to answer for. This particular comment is concerned with The Century of the Self:
""Ask him why he has failed to respond to the articles and letters that have been sent to him. Ask him why The Century of the Self gave so much detailed attention to Guatemalan history, and yet failed to mention U.S. responsibility for the 150,000 civilians killed as a result of its assault on Guatemala. Ask why the series focused on this isolated U.S. intervention without mentioning that it was a small part of similar interventions elsewhere in Latin America and in the Third World generally. Is this wider pattern not central to understanding the real significance, and costs, of corporate control of domestic and foreign societies in the 20th and 21st centuries?""
