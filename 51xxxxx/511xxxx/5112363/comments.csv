Anyway, thanks for the upload!"

,jaydean09,2009-10-07T19:13Z,Ok i have been downloading for about 2 hours now and im on 1.1% done lol please more people download : ) and a question please is this 32bit or 64bit versions ? thanks someone reply thanks : ) 
,cclloyd,2009-10-07T21:46Z,"I am sorry.  This is x32 (x86) bit.  I was working on the x64 bit last night and got it mixed up.  

So this is x86 or x32 bit.

And im constantly uploading at average of 250kb/sec and have been overnight.  With almost 200 leechers and only me as a seed it will take a while.  The closest peer is at just about 50%.

If you want it faster i might be able to send it to a few people on AIM and then they can tell it to download whereever they store it.  But if i do that YOU MUST SEED!

AIM screename: cclloyd9785
Tell me you are from this torrent and ill send it to u."
,abhishekdaniel5,2009-10-08T10:27Z,is this real
,cclloyd,2009-10-09T00:21Z,Yes it is.  An i provided the Windows 7 ISO Verifier for you to prove it.
,sunny3,2009-10-09T09:51Z,"Thanks in advance cclloyd...this is the most perfect one I have come across...please keep seeding....

A few questions though...

Am I right in thinking Ultimate is now just ultimate...ie you can not choose which version you want any longer ?
(Unlike vista where you could leave the product key blank and choose which version)

Also with the oem version...does this give you a choice for whcih version?...
Have you just taken out the ei.cfg...or is it pre activated as well?

Cheers.
"
,cclloyd,2009-10-09T13:50Z,"None of these are pre activated.  They are just standard ISOs.  No activator, no nothin.  Ultimate is just the ultimate.  You do not need a product key to install any of these.  

the OEM has all editions in it.  Just start the setup like u would then it will show a screen during it to select the edition you want to install."
,Tryst49,2009-10-09T19:21Z,"I got 43 peers and no seeds. If this torrent was any slower, it would be faster to design and write my own version of the OS."
,kallekula33,2009-10-09T19:42Z,Is this the real deal or what ?? Will there be new realeases on the 22:nd when 7 hits the shelves ?
,readone2381,2009-10-10T15:13Z,".........plz help me with a little more installation guidelines.

thanks."
,babym86,2009-10-11T13:59Z,Just a quick question. Do you need to download the OEM iso AND the ultimate iso or can i just download the ultimate?
,cclloyd,2009-10-11T17:00Z,"You can choose which edition you want to download.  If you choose one of the DVDs that a label on it, then it will be retail.  If you want OEM ultimate then just download the OEM one and it will let you choose the editon during setup."
,babym86,2009-10-11T20:10Z,So if I just install Ultimate it will require a product key?
,BlueBallsItch,2009-10-11T22:10Z,"Okay, I installed the Ultimate version and it asks for a product key during installation.  Skipping a product key leaves an unactivated 7 Ultimate with a 30 day trial.

So as far as I know regarding this torrent, NONE of these are activated and there are no loaders/cracks/activation programs anywhere in the torrent, no?

FYI, for anyone wanting to download 13+ gigs hoping for an activated Winblows 7 or product key...

Or am I missing something here?"
,cclloyd,2009-10-11T22:59Z,"Do you think that an official microsoft ISO would include an activator to pirate their own software?

These torrents do not include an activator, nor are they pre activated.  None of this is illeagle.  these are for download, then you can either buy a product key when they come out, or pirate it yourself."
,peluchita74,2009-10-11T23:40Z,"Hi cclloyd.
Thanks for your upload! :) I just have one question.
Is this really retail or is it RTM? "
,BlueBallsItch,2009-10-12T03:23Z,"cclloyd:

Why do you think they call this place ""The Pirate Bay?""

Get over your self-righteous self.  There are numerous places I can download a supposed ""legal"" copy of Windows 7, of different versions.

But wait a minute!  Microsoft hasn't yet released Windows 7 retail officially!

Which makes these copies ""illegal"" distributions anyway.

So much for your claim that ""None of this is illeagle [sic]"""
,pegapalo,2009-10-12T12:55Z,"This is why I dont like some people. CCLLOYD IS GIVING YOU THE CLEANEST COPY AROUND FOR FREE AND WAY BEFORE IT HITS STORES. YOU THINK U CAN FIND A CLEANER COPY THAN THIS ONE? BE MY GUESS AND TRY IT. U WILL NOT FIND IT PERIOD. AT LEAST NOT HERE... GET A WIN7 LOADER,, OR INSTALL OEM.. SIMPLE AND EASY.. AND STOP FUCKING AROUND, AT LEAST BE GRATEFUL; CCLLOYD DIDNT HAVE TO DO SHIT FOR NO ONE, AND IS DOING IT FOR PEOPLE HE DOESNT KNOW AT ALL.. "
,peluchita74,2009-10-12T17:37Z,well said pegapalo :). 
,pizzaboy9990,2009-10-13T15:17Z,ok ive downloaded the retail version of ultimate as well....what is the best activater to use for the retail versions...
,pizzaboy9990,2009-10-14T09:37Z,"no need for the swearing d00d!///its all free,the downloading is slow but bear with it...it took me a little while to download....

previous question....

best activator for the retail verions...
thanks"
,cclloyd,2009-10-14T20:41Z,Search Windows Activator Ultimate Edition.  I think it has a build of like 6000 or somewhere around there.  It hasnt failed me yet on any version of windows from Windows XP to Windows 7.
,ImmaPC,2009-10-15T18:27Z,"So ya.....maybe I'm just totally retarded, but I downloaded and installed the Ultimate Version x64, used the loader that was recomended, activated successfully. The problem I am having is that when I see ""retail"" I think of a purchasable product. I used the loader to tell me what version i had to make sure i had the right one, and it states that this is the ""evaluation copy"" and expires 3/1/2010 @ 4:59pm. If this is the case, I already had this version man. I see nowhere in you discription where it states that this is an ""evaluation copy"". Can you clarify this issue for me?"
,cclloyd,2009-10-17T00:11Z,It says evaluation copy because I got this copy before build 7600 was declared the final retail build so it has that mark on it.  Just use the Universal Watermark Remover in the Description to get rid of it.
,ImmaPC,2009-10-17T02:56Z,"I don't have the watermark bud, I'm talking about the fact that this windows has an expiration date attached to it. It expires the same day that the RC, and RT expire. "
,neosmokes,2009-10-17T07:31Z,"cclloyd...

Is it real that this is attached with expiration date (Jan 2010) as ImmaPC above says ???"
,cclloyd,2009-10-17T18:04Z,"if you activated it sohuldnt expire.  You might also want to do a Windows update.  One of the updates released made the beta testers that were running 7600, into the final build without the deactivation."
,ImmaPC,2009-10-19T15:44Z,"So now I checked my System Info and it is back to the 30 day count down....after using the loader that you said to use. Whats the deal with that? I run the loader and it says that it activates it, but the countdown is still here. Any ideas?"
,leonardtj,2009-10-22T19:10Z,If you can't get it to work you could try buying a copy if you have a .edu e-mail you can get it for 36 bucks 
,treontn,2009-11-20T19:30Z,"Is this the rtm version or the original dvd? Everyone says that rtm and retail are the same but they are not. There are some major driver updates in retail one.
Thanks..."
