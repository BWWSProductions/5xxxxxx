,g00ey,2010-04-11T12:41Z,"A lot of virus killers such as AVG report false positives. I have experienced several occasions when I downloaded wallpaper collections using bittorrent. The virus killer ""automatically"" removed the jpegs as they were downloaded causing errors in the bittorrent downloader. I couldn't manually add exceptions or do anything to keep the antivirus program off from my files so I turned the antivirus shield off completely and I have never turned it on again. It's quite bad but the credibility of the virus killers are getting lower and lower these days."
