When embalmer Miyako (Reiko Takashima) finds a needle embedded in the body of an apparent suicide victim, she raises an eyebrow in suspicion. But when the corpse's head is severed and stolen, it becomes obvious this was no ordinary death. Determined to unravel the mystery, Miyako journeys into a gritty subculture of illegal drugs, organ harvesting and religious sects -- a place where staying alive is an everyday battle.
