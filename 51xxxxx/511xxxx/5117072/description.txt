// PERSONAL NOTES

I'm afraid I can't really help you with much, there's not much to this release. Just follow the instructions and there you go.
Please try and keep all e-mails in English. There's only so much Spanish, Italian and French I can understand and speak.
Also please no more e-mails about how to download torrents or any e-mails about how to extract .rar files, you'll get much faster results by googling it.
Remember: GIYF (Google is your friend.)
Sharing is caring, so please, seed back at least 1:1.
