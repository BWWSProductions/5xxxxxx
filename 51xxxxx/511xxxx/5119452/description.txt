What can I say - this is a hilarious series that I've been searching for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere, so I finally came to the realization that it was my responsibility as a torrent fan to buy the series and upload it to the PB community. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, I think it's hilarious. Please share and seed!

This is also my first torrent, so please let me know if I can do anything better/more efficiently. Please, only CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. If you don't like this series, keep it to yourself.

Enough said - ENJOY and SHARE!
