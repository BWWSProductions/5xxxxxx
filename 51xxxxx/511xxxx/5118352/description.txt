Description:  A cut above the usual cheesy paste-up "tribute", 
The James Dean Story is imbued with a modicum of style thanks to 
fledgling film-director Robert Altman. Most of the film consists 
of clips from Dean's three starring pictures (East of Eden, Rebel 
Without a Cause and Giant), with tantalizing glimpses of his pre-star career. 
One such glimpse, a snippet from the 1951 TV religious special Hill 
Number One, has popped up in virtually every Dean retrospective since. 
Altman's inherent cinematic gifts are evident in the impressionistic 
"re-enactment" of Dean's fatal auto crash. Narrated by Martin Gabel, 
The James Dean Story isn't terribly deep, but it's a good shorthand 
overview of one of the most powerful screen presences of the 1950s.
