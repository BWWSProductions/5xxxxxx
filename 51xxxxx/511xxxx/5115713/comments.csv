,Fireholder,2009-10-31T03:03Z,"How about some details of your upload?
You know, source, quality, is it your rip?"
,overourheads,2009-11-06T01:19Z,well.. it's the only upload out there. so your just going to have to trust it -- but it's 320kbs. It was the digital copy of the album given out for buying the vinyl.
,AmateurHistorian,2009-12-17T07:17Z,"Clean, beautiful rip. Thank you."
,pojjl,2009-12-20T22:00Z,"Not exactly a clean rip. I heard on click in the song ""I Will"" at 1:30. Good enough maybe, but not great and not nearly perfect.
