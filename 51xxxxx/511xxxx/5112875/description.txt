"Until I Die" is a pop song performed by Swedish singer September. The song was written by Anoo Bhagavan, Jonas von der Burg and Niklas von der Burg for September's third album Dancing Shoes (2007). It was released as the album's second single on November 7, 2007 in Sweden.

Hard2Beat Records announced that Until I Die was due to be released on July 27 2009, as the third single from her debut UK album, Cry For You - The Album. However, it has been announced that the song's release has been cancelled due to lack of radio play. Rumours circulating the internet suggest that the song failing to make BBC Radio 1's playlist resulted in Hard2Beat scrapping the release.
