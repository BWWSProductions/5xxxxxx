Ten years in the works, Columbine is a masterpiece of reportage. Dave Cullen, the acclaimed journalist who followed the massacre from day one, reconstructs the psychological journey of two teenage boys who became killers. Over the course of this gripping narrative, Cullen approaches his subjects with unrivaled care and insight. What emerges are shattering portraits of the killers, the victims, and the community that suffered one of the most socially and historically important shooting tragedies of the twentieth century.
