"Afghanistan may be the bloody stalemate that stands to ruin Obama's healthcare and economic policy in the way that Vietnam ruined LBJ's Great Society." Daniel Ellsberg told Shock and Awesome today. The dynamic duo discussed Ellsberg's take on politics today, and his mind-blowing experience captured in the film THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA. The documentary made by Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith is now playing at the Film Forum. Ellsberg recounted epic moments from the film such as one in 1965, where Defense Secretary Robert McNamara stood in front of TV cameras to say "we're winning in Vietnam" while only minutes before, he had aligned himself with Ellsberg on a plane ride back from 'Nam that the U.S. was in fact losing. The guy that Nixon tried to ruin as the former Rand Corporation think tank star broke the TOP SECRET papers on U.S. policy in Vietnam, and faced a potential 115 years in prison. Heroic!
