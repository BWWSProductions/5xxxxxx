DVD Rip to iPod

Producer: James Bouchard

Beifang Qi Taiji Zhang means "Northern Energy Taiji Cane". This exciting original form was created to introduce the cane to Taiji practitioners, and to introduce Taiji principles to martial artists interested in the cane.

Beifang Qi includes sets of "Qigong" or "energy exercises", multiple views of the form and a complete section on basic applications. Each movement is named for easy reference and the DVD version includes interactive menus.

Beifang Qi Taiji Zhang is appropriate for novices, yet experienced martial artists will find new levels of understanding.
