Does anyone have a reliable Windows7 x86 download link?"
,r3574r7,2009-10-24T10:06Z,"Could anyone tell me why I suddenly have a Z:\ drive after I used this patch?  (It's actually a partition of C:\) 

And apparently it's the new ""bootmgr"" drive for some reason since I can't delete it and I get the ""bootmgr missing"" message after renaming it to Y:\ (in an effort to delete it). So now I'm probably going to have to repair the installation. 

It's very annoying to have a random 200mb Z:\ drive. Anyone have any ideas on how to get rid of it?

Good activator though; worked well."

,grasssnake,2010-07-18T20:22Z,"Win7 done and dusted.  Mind you, as a .rar  when Win7 was loaded I needed Bitcommet to down load it and then winrar to open it.

Still no bother (progs would be d/loaded anyway.)

Wave the wand and 'puff' it's done its job.

NICE  (use you all the time in whites washh ,LOL)"
