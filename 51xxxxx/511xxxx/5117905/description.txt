                    Windows 7 Loader v1.6.9 (x86-x64) - By Daz



New Windows 7 Loader v1.6.9 activation toolkit for Windows 7 (x86-x64). 

Just get yourself Windows 7 releases from GRP or WZT, choose one of the activation 
methods and you're good to go. Read instructions first.


Features:

- Maintain your own list of serials, future or current 
  (comes with a lot of preset keys).
- Automatically finds an available drive letter (if required).
- Installer and uninstaller built in as standard.
- Checks your Windows version and build before install.
- Automatically finds your active boot partition.
- Works on all languages.
- Works alongside hidden partitions.
- Works on Windows 7, Vista and Server 2008 editions.
- Support for bios modded users.
- Improves Windows 7 boot time on a Mac (compared to other loaders).


What makes this different from every other loader out at the moment?
Itâ€™s not a batch file and all commands are made within the application, it has 
great error handling and doesnâ€™t try to find the active partition based on size 
(which every other loader is doing at the moment).

So whats the advantages and why should you care?
With me building this loader as an application I can access system details and 
create declares for many of the functions. This means anyone that uses this loader 
should have a greater chance of success!

Whats the differences between each loader option?
Hover your mouse over each option to see

Ok so how do I run it?
In general you simply press Install!

I activated Windows 7. Now I want to activate Windows Vista. Why isn't it working?
Use the uninstall option while on Windows 7 and reboot into Windows Vista. 
Next install your selected cert/slic in Windows Vista and then reboot back 
to Windows 7 and click install.

Activation failed, now what?
Try again with the beta or the older loader option enabled, one of them might 
just work for you.



Version history Windows 7 Loader

Version 1.6.9
* Added amber as a color to the application integrity checking as well 
  as a few tweaks to the existing code (you should still always check 
  the displayed application path even when green)
* Cleaned up some code for better performance
* Added new GRLDR 0.94 from zsmin

Version 1.6.8
* Added application integrity checking. This is a new feature which will display 
  you with information about how the application was launched when the mouse is 
  hovered over the green or red icon. It's goal is to inform you if you are 
  running an untouched version of the application or one that could have been 
  modified in some way by a script kiddie. Of course green is the best result, 
  if it's red then be cautious as someone's likely binded a trojan!

Version 1.6.7
* Fixed Windows Vista activation status
* Added Windows 7 Enterprise editions as a supported OS, although you will need 
  to wait for OEM SLP keys to leak

Version 1.6.6
* Fixed activation checking for non-english systems (This release is just to 
  address confusion as to if a system is activated or not)

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
