Transmission: operating instructions from the lap of Daddy Uh-Oh,
Salutations Uh-Oh drones. Stiffy to be here reporting on the progress of Uh-Oh's continuing subsonic experiments. Today several top stars in music and the fuck film industry are working with Uh-Oh co. to enhance the full frontal lobes of the masses. The sudo-scientific term "Gendernetics" was coined in the early 90's to describe experiments leading to the propaganda tool, Penis, Your Majesty. At that time music was at an all time low after years of conservative, corporate kiddy-pop and the budding hard core rap reaction had humans choosing sides in the ongoing clichÃ© wars. Unnatural selection and dissatisfaction lead Daddy Uh-Oh to plan the most offensive multi-media sex show he could think of.
One night while engorged and groping his latex lover he heard uncharacteristically cool music cumming from the porno film Party Doll a Go-Go . "That's it!", he yelled running to the toilet. While on the shit box he placed an add for freaks with "special talents". Days later Penis, Your Majesty were locked away practicing in an asbestos infested, 120 degree loft. What they lacked in talent they made up for in excitement and excremental references. Uh-Oh premiered this new combo at an all ages talent show he called the Daddy Rally. Plastic Doll allowed herself to be eaten out as band mates sang her praises and the mutant spokes pervert Vaseline insulted and disturbed the audience. Meant as an assault on the senseless, instead the crowed got so over zealous in there praise of Penis that the University of Kentucky signed them to play an outdoor concert. While arranging the details Plastic Doll was fisted fucked to death by Anti-Uh-Oh Conspirator with a bull whip. This ugly event gave a new focus to the band, a political agenda to disturb and corrupt the sons and daughters of the accused killers.
Daddy Uh-Oh would like to spank: our fans, the late great inflate-o-mate Plastic "Luv Luv" Doll, Rinse Dream (for inspirational films Party Doll A Go-Go & Cafe Flesh), Reverend Brownmouth, Colonel Lingus, Commander Clitoris, Captain Beefheart, Glory Noel, MC Poop, Pelce, Pain Teens, uncircumcised masses, Mary Burt, Zinc, WRFL, the P.I.S.S. Army, Something Weird Video, Mark II A.K.A. Devo Boy, Retro Virus and Opportunistic Infection, Wayland Flowers and Madame X, Larry Flint, and God.
!991-1993 Penis took America by storm and were suddenly silenced by the untimely death of Plastic "Luv Luv" Doll and over differences with right wing manager Daddy Uh-oh. Kennedy, MTV VJ, reported Penis, Your Majesty were one of Kentucky's hottest bands which lead to a lengthy legal battle with MTV over the bands ruined "Street Creed". Band member Bonkers and spokes mutant "Vaseline" have been picked up several times by police for lude behavior and prostitution charges. Double the Stuff disappeared for years but has resurfaced in a cult of UFO followers.
