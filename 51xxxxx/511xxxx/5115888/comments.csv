[V],neon,2009-10-09T09:23Z,@bone...i've downloaded three diffrent copys of this(all bad audio) so im asking you direct has this got the crappy audio or is it good throughout 
[V],neon,2009-10-09T10:15Z,ankara all im saying is if i download a movie i hope to understand whats being said in the audio without having to waste time downloading another bad audio..and as for going to the cinema last weekend i went to see the time travellers wife with my mrs and another couple...thats $45 im not getting back

,kudos2jen,2009-10-09T23:27Z,"Actually _Ankara_, this is a dvdrip but from the other side of the world 9from North America).  All r5s (if labeled properly) have dvdrip video quality, but the audio is redone with a TS.  Obviously there is no TS out for this movie.  don't be such an ass when someone asks a question. "
,kudos2jen,2009-10-10T18:15Z,"awe.._Ankara_...you hurt my feelings.  lol...this is me laughing. 
if my explanation of an r5 is bullshit (your word) then you tell me what an r5 is?  enlighten me, kid?"
,kudos2jen,2009-10-11T04:40Z,sigh...really.  I'm so enlightened now.
