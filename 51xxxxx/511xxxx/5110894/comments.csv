And again, I'm pretty sure you need I-tunes 9 update to play the he-aac portion.  I also forgot to mention included are: 5 episodes each at about 200 MB.  Also, these do not include the original music.  It has been replaced with generic music.  I have plans to mux in the old audio with the new video, but it is way down the line.  "
,lazylazyjoe,2009-10-17T03:36Z,"I have seeded to 1500% and will be discontinuing seeding.  I will hopefully release an ipod compatible season 2 this weekend(w/ commentary as 2nd track).  Just click my user name to see if it's ready.  Glad to see this show still has fans, I just wish the DVD had the original music.  Oh well, looks much better than the VHS rips I was watching. Also, I currently use Mediacoder for my transcoding.  I think it is any excellent & easy program that acts as a front end for almost everything!"

Season One had 8 episodes, you have 5.   Season Two had 7 episodes, you have 5.   Season Three had 13 episodes, you have 6, and there WAS no Season Four of The State, yet you have 7.  

Where are the rest of the episodes?"

THANKS JOE!!!!!!"
,lazylazyjoe,2011-10-31T10:50Z,"I'm sorry I got the labeling wrong,  but just about all of the episodes should be there.  Just in 4 seasons instead of 3.  Glad people are enjoying. I have access to the original files again, so I'll start seeding again for a few weeks.  "
