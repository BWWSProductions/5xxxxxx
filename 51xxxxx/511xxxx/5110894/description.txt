Mtv's The State Season 1.  
I encoded these for my Ipod classic from a DVD rip.  Must be using Itunes 9 for he-aac audio, and Ipod must play 640x480 (5th gen Ipod).
Video encoded w/ x264 baseline profile in mp4 container. 1 pass 640X480 1250kbps.  Audio Encoded w/ Nero  64kbps He-aac.  No commentary track.  I might include it as a secondary track for the remaining seasons, when I release them.  Hopefully soon.   
I know it's usually implied but, please help seed.

UPDATE***
Second season just released.  I have included the commentary.  I have all the rips done so it's just a matter of transcoding.  Check my username for updates on the rest of the series.
