Hell or Heaven - Your Choice---Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev

Escaping our personal hell can appear daunting and impossible. In Hell or Heaven, Sadhguru 'blows the hell out of you,' through the direct and powerful life choices that offer a way out of our self-created prisons.

"If you want to blow the hell out, you donâ€™t have to struggle with hell or with past karma; you just have to bring that necessary consciousness and awareness into everything that you do."
- Sadhguru
