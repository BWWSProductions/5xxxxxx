The Wake Up Sid story is a pathetically banal, crappy piece of shit.

A rich brat having a good time with his fatherâ€™s cash and doesnâ€™t take anything seriously.

Not his studies. Not his fatherâ€™s business.

Nothing save partying and having a good time with his buddies counts with our Siddharth a.k.a Sid.

But for our Aisha Banerjee (Konkana Sen), newly arrived in Bombay (take that you jackass, Raj Thackeray) from Kolkata with a serious expression and more serious dreams of becoming a writer, goals and mature behavior matter.

No sooner is she in Bombay than she serendipitously meets our kid Sid.

Although polar opposites, they quickly become close friends. So close that when Sid walks out of his home in a huff he drops anchor at her home.

Yeah, Sid is disorganized, his room is a mess and he canâ€™t cook.

Hello, is that enough material for a movie?

By God, no. Thatâ€™s kid stuff.

How Sid turns into a responsible fella and the friends find love constitutes the rest of this yawn-yawn story.
