Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion was a horror-suspense-romance anthology comic book series published by DC Comics from 1971-1974, a was a companion title to Secrets of Sinister House.

After four issues as The Dark Mansion Of Forbidden Love, the romance angle was abandoned and the title changed to Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion. Very much in the same vein as House of Mystery and House of Secrets, Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion was "hosted" by Charity (the character debuted in issue #7).

Originally edited by Dorothy Woolfolk, the title was later overseen by a succession of editors, including Ethan C. Mordden, Joe Orlando, E. Nelson Bridwell, and Denny O'Neill. Contributors to the title included Jack Oleck, E. Nelson Bridwell, Jack Kirby, Michael William Kaluta, Alfredo Alcala, Jack Sparling, Bill Draut, and Alex NiÃ±o.
