,regbox,2009-10-08T08:42Z,"Right. Damn Right.

We are arrogant, camel riders, jailbirds. 

Yes we are, but thanks to Almighty Allah, that we are not Open Minded as you are. The way you disrespect other people's believes just shows exactly how open minded and forgiving you people are with no hatred towards any other nation or religion.

I am a Muslim so sue me, start calling me extremist or better start abusing me, because I am not as Open Minded as all of you are.

I am an average Muslim. I am not an Islamic Scholar not anyone else but just an ordinary Muslim and despite of the fact how much you hate us I am Proud to be a Muslim you know why?

Just because I don't go on posting stuff which depicts hatred towards any religion. I personaly dont try to hurt anyone. 

Some of my best friends are Hindu and Christian and they show the very same behavior. They don't talk about my religion and I don't talk about theirs. We eat together, we study together. But why people like you sho your hatred without caring about other people's thoughts?

Now I believe you'll start calling me extremist or abusing me, so go on. I know how open minded and liberal you are so I really don't care."
,regbox,2009-10-09T05:57Z,"bodthedog, no one in my community told me that there was something wrong in sharing food with Hindus. I can be wrong But I'll ask some scholar, as far as I know I think it's about marriage, a Muslim MALE is allowed to marry a Christian or Jewish Female. 

I am Muslim, I never studied anything about any other religion because whenever a question arose in my mind; Islam satisfied me properly.

Having Faith is something which empowers me. I never feel tensed when I have prayed to Allah, that's obviously my case. 

But definitely I like you because you are willing to see beyond the divisions of RELIGION. This is the very first step of Finding the Truth. Have a lovely day."
,regbox,2009-10-10T05:39Z,"I see, well thanks. You really saved my time by referring to that verse. Definitely no, I will never stop eating with my friends because they are MY FRIENDS. But I'll be contacting some Scholars for further explanation. If Almighty Allah has ordered us to eat just with the people of the book then what's the reason behind it. 

I have always considered Islam to be quite humanitarian so...u know. If I found anything I 'll be glad to share it with you, only if you are interested."
,regbox,2009-10-11T09:00Z,"Mr. bodthedog, I've dispatched an Email to a very famous Islamic Scholar Mr. Zakir Naik about the cause that why Islam forbids not to share food with unbelievers. I hope his answer will arrive in a day or so. I'll post it here as soon as I get it.
C u 2mrw."
,regbox,2009-10-13T19:44Z,"Not at all,  but not declaring relation too some sect should be a good thing. Islam was supposed to be one religion but our Aalims and Muftis really messed them up just for their own agendas. To be precise I belong to ""Dev Bandi"" sect of Islam but my father once told me that I should not be a part of any SECT, he told me that I should follow the things which dont contradict Quran Majeed and Hadees. Because Holy Prophet (PBUH) preached Islam he didn't preached 200 altered versions of Islam.


I still am waiting for Mr. Zakir's reply because as long as he provide some good explanation and reference to Quraan o Hadees it doesn't matter. At the very least it'll be able to provide me some hint."
,locknkez,2010-01-04T03:23Z,"first: Good E-book
second: guys, let's make things simple.
the first thing that must be clarified is the language.
saying eating WITH someone is not the issue. Muslims can EAT WITH anyone. let's say I want to sit down and eat a banana with a hindu. there is no problem. the issue is the MEAT and not any meat. it is THEIR meat. If we sit and eat Muslim's ((Halal) meaning permissible) meat, then there still is no problem. THE main problem is when they sacrifice the meat they call on deities other than the one true God. whose name HAPPENS to be ALLAH in Arabic. American's may Say God, but remember that English is a relatively NEW language and the paople of the past referred to him via Aramaic and other ancient languages."
,locknkez,2010-01-04T03:29Z,"The final point is that the Jews and Christians are based in a monotheistic system. meaning they originally believe/d in ONE GOD. One creator.
and when they sacrificed the animals they did not call on the names of any other deity.

So, Muslims to NOT eat meat that has been dedicated to another deity(God). 
However we can ALL sit down and have a salad together :)

Thank you all for your input and questions and civil discourse. As a Muslim and former Christian I would like to say to the haters... don't believe EVERYTHING that you are told or any propaganda until you research it and prove it yourself. meaning go to the library. just because you heard something on CNBC does not make it the gospel truth. .. our only objective is to find and illuminate the truth."
,locknkez,2010-01-04T03:34Z,"FINALLY!!!
the crux of the matter has nothing to do with food and who can share what food with whom, the main point is to single out God alone and to not associate partners with him. to adore him as our lord and caretaker giver of life and the one to whom we shall return. and ultimately stand before for account. all humans. the good and bad of us."
