Im guessing each country (within limits) gets given their own copies but the spanish and greeks are so big on showing pirate video's in their bars during the day there as it's not illegal there and if it is the police don't do anything as it brings in trade, they have a time scedule for pirate films throughout the day,,, that's why i think the spanish and greek get them first,,, 

Anyway id rather wait and understand the person speaking rather than have a dirty dubbed version,,, they gain nothing in my opinion lol....... "
