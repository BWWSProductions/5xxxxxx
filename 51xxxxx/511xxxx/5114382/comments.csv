,Dude72,2009-10-08T23:11Z,"Thanks man, was waiting for this one! 

I understand swebarb his comment, its because a lot of gt's have been posted and not one worked on m33 etc"
[T],swebarb,2009-10-08T23:18Z,"uh yea, its hard not to be suspicious, not the first time a new guy claims something is working when it isnt.. "
,mtrj1776,2009-10-08T23:40Z,"yea i realised not one was working that is why i patched myself and uplaoded i also have been waiting for this for ages but i am lazy lol but decided to do it myself then hope no one has any trouble with it! i only posted the two versions of the cfw i tried it on to make sure it works :)

,smasudi,2009-10-10T16:31Z,can someone help!!!!!! i m new to psp. i got psp3000 with official firmware v5.51. i searched  a lot on internet but could not find anythimg to hack it. some say it can't be hacked.   can any good soul help me. it will  be appreciated....
,mtrj1776,2009-10-11T04:45Z,"it is hackable i done it on my friends, only problem is i have no idea how i did i cant remember lol, i bricked it in the process to had to reflash it, its hard to do and unsafe so i would wait untill someone releases a guide check here pspcustomfirmware.com to see if anyone has one, 5.51 ofw and upwards is a bit of a pain to hack, 5.50 or lower would have been great lol"

It works 100% for me. Great game. Very nice uploader. Very nice indeed! Keep up the good work and make sure u patch every game for 5.03 GEN ALSO. Congrats!"
,mtrj1776,2009-10-19T23:33Z,i have not changed my patching method so itss possible they will all work on gen but i have not comfirmed so will not be adding in title on unconfirmed ones :)
,cutealways20,2009-10-31T22:28Z,I downloaded the game and transferred to ISO. I tried to play it but it loads as a first logo and then goes black and shuts off my psp. what should i do?

,JBone55,2009-12-22T05:15Z,"Thanks man, i just joined because your torrent saved me. I tryed like 5 other ones for the GT for PSP and yours was the only one that worked.

But after you do the whole thing with the eboot file...."
