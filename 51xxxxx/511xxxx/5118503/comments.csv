,wolfy100,2009-10-31T22:03Z,The only way I can think of is going to the forum and requesting the PB to do it from there!! They have done it already for others....
,milligan283,2009-11-22T10:53Z,"Hi Wolfy
Several of us are now stuck just below 60% on  this disc (26 of 27). Any idea when you are going to upload disc 27 so I can ready as soon as you post it?

Thanks for your uploads much appreciated"
