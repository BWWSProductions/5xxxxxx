Casey Blue is an average teenage girl living a fairly average life.  And then she breaks into a complete stranger's apartment and beats them to death.  The series uncovers why this happened, why she had no control over it, and why it's just the first step in a much, much larger event.

Written by B. Clay Moore, with art by Carlo Barberi.
