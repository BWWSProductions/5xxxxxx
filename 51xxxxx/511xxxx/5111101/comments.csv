,OlexKi,2009-10-09T12:18Z,"I'm uploading your torrent RIGHT NOW and I already have listen about 8 songs from it. :)))

Thank you for comments. ^__^"
,music60,2009-10-10T09:53Z,"Strange discussion... what is going here?
J. Bleeds torrent has no covers (at least one could check the origin superficially) and is low quality (MP3); Olexkis torrent is high quality FLAC and has covers...  and thanks both of you for sharing!"
,OlexKi,2009-10-10T10:07Z,"you're welcome! :) 

PS J. Bleeds torrent has different tracklist and differend versions of same songs - that's all what I want to say. Our discussion looks strange because of my really bad English. I'm from Russia. %))))"
,XxM24Ty,2010-01-01T12:57Z,"I'm grateful for the DETAILS and the comments here. I almost started to download this thinking it was a rare PURE BEATLES recording! After I read about all the other bands overdubbing I only then realized what it really was. 

I have The Beatles 16 CD Box set and am looking for rare PURE Beatles songs to fill up all 20 CD jewel cases so the collection will fit perfectly inside the 2 boxes I made to hold exactly 20 Beatles CD/DVDs. I have many hours of work in making this collection look and sound as good as possible, but I still need another 3 CD/DVDs to make everything fill up and fit right. If anyone has any clear sounding bootlegs of live Beatles gigs that might be a great upload.... anybody?"
