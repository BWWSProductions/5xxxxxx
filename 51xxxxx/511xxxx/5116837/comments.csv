Download Adobe Audition 3.0: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE
to determine if it is a re-encode of another file. 

Steps:
1. Open audition and click on edit.
2. Drag and Drop (or add) a mp3 file into audition
3. 3. Click on ""View"" and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)

A true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..
128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...

I have uploaded a VBR version of this song so if you want quality check it out. 

DTHSTR09 it would be better for you to post a true 320kbps version of this song, not just a re-encode..."
,DTHSTR09,2009-10-28T14:06Z,"fuck man you are lifeless xD
okay i admit, it is 256 or something
but if you say 256 some people dont know what youre talking about.
I guess you dont know the difference either.
So fuckoff with your complaining, go fockup someone elses torrent."
,xXEscapingMyFateXx,2009-11-06T11:06Z,"dude, at least i have a life, unlike you who randomly gets songs and just re-encodes them to 320kbps and then puts them up to download. the quality is actually worse, and it takes up more space unnecessarily. you should keep it at the bit rate you got it from not re-encoding.  "
,DrApexi,2009-11-30T11:28Z,"Im going to have to go with xXEscapingMyFateXx   Nothing more fucking frustrating that a torrent that has incorrenct info. If you are planning on DJ'ing it or anything on a sound system that needs better quality.. Thanks xXEscapingMyFateXx for checking, DTSHTR09 def dont do that, its stupid, just post the original quality... "
