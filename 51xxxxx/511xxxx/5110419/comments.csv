,Un-Danged,2010-01-27T01:35Z,"I had an installation error trying to run the package.
-->right clicked 
--> ""show(ed) package contents)
-->contents folder
--> packages
--> install packages individually, 
they all worked except 'finalDraftPostflight.pkg', which is fine..."
,Retinitis,2010-01-30T18:25Z,"I got the finalDraftPostflight.pkg error as well. But the app seems to initialize regardless. The keygen, however, isn't generating a key the app recognizes. Dead torrent."
,xas210,2010-02-05T03:23Z,"no offence, but you guys really suck at giving instructions.

1. open the zip, dmg, mkpg whatever. install the fucker. normal.
2. even if you get error msgs during install, like i did - final draft might still be installed. check your app folder (or do a search)
3. open. now, you will be asked for a registration code. (or be forced to use the ""demo"" version.) to get this, you need to start up the keygen.exe.
3b. keygen.exe is a WINDOWS program, which wont run on mac osx. for this, there is a program called CrossOver, found on piratebay, which will run windows files. so download CO, run keygen.exe.
3c. nothing may happen, in fact, when you run keygen.exe on CO. or it's REALLY slow in starting up. i got thru it by running keygen.exe, then quitting CO, which will make the keygen.exe program jump up, and you have ten seconds to do your business. repeat if necessary.
4. click GENERATE (the first column) in keygen.exe. this is the 8FD-whatever number you're being asked for in FD. copy...
5...paste to FD. click next whatever. then choose MANUAL activation (i think - anyway, you need to use the PHONE activation option. you'll find it.) 
6. copy the number there, the second line, some six numbers or so.
7. use this in keygen (second line) and press generate or process or whatever. a new number is generated in keygens bottom line.
8. use this number in FD.
9. voila qoui!

fool proof? possibly, but not very likely."
,goodwood,2010-02-05T19:04Z,Could you run the Keygen on a PC or does it have to be on the MAC same computer as install?
,stopimalreadydead,2010-02-06T22:23Z,No. You can open it on a Windows PC just fine. It's only on a Mac that you have to do all this extra crap lol.
,BRequena,2010-02-09T05:51Z,@stopimalreadydead... Thanks for the upload! Works perfectly!
,Retinitis,2010-02-10T07:05Z,"@xas210
Thanks for the condescending instructions but what I wrote before was true. The keygen wasn't producing a serial the app recognized. Now, for some reason the freshly download app is recognizing the serial and everything works. I think it might have something to do with having a previous version of FD installed. Anyway, thanks for giving me a reason to try it again."
,thomas.lang198,2010-02-23T00:44Z,"@xas210
Thx for the instructions for dummies. Worked like a charm! Will continue to seeeeed...."
,purcelul,2010-03-20T23:42Z,"keygen works like a charm in crossover, and is activating the demo downloaded from the fd website. thank you poster."
,deathtax,2010-08-12T07:02Z,Keygen works with latest demo download at FD website.
,rodunky,2010-10-12T20:48Z,where I can get the keygen? sorry I am new at this I have a mac if that helps in any way 
,rodunky,2010-10-12T20:57Z,how do I get the keygen I have a mac is that is any help. I know that is a windowns program but I have read a lot of bad comments and scams on it. sorry but  i am new at this. 
,zdlasc,2010-11-07T18:49Z,"This also works and might be easier for some than using the keygen.

Use one of these as a serial number:


8FD-956-995-881-971
8FD-117-141-135-313
8FD-128-167-087-135

Use manual activation. 

Use the codes below to create the challenge response:

0   57
1   56
2   59
3   58
4   61
5   60
6   63
7   62
8   49
9   48

Use the TWO digits for each of the first four numbers.
Use on the FIRST digit for the fifth number.
Ignore the sixth number.

Also, the last challenge code digit can be ignored, only the first 5 challenge characters matter (for whatever stupid reason).

So if the challenge code was: 975310, your code is 486260585

If the challenge code was:
222222, your code is 595959595

If the challenge code was:
999999, your code is 484848484"
,L_t0p0,2010-11-14T20:55Z,"Has anybody encountered an error that causes FD to not install? I had tried installing other FD versions from different torrents, but even after deleting all the FD files and trying to install this, I keep getting this error (""The installation failed. The Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance."")

Any help's appreciated.

,Ruwin,2011-01-19T04:35Z,wow thanks zdlasc that worked like a charm ! I got the failed installation but paid no attention to it and used your method of configuring the code and worked great! Thanks
,negativeions,2011-01-20T07:11Z,This torrent might as well be a txt file with zdlasc's instructions. You can download the demo from the official site then apply the serial. thanks.
,Frazier15,2011-02-28T02:19Z,Worked perfectly. Install says it fails but it doesn't. Run the keygen and enter in manual mode. Easy Peazy.

,burivega,2011-07-14T05:26Z,"I was wondering: Does anyone know how to crack the 8.02 update that Final Draft released for the Lion? I tried the keygen and zdiasc's instructions but it didn't work, at least not for me"
,X-Y,2011-08-08T00:25Z,"I dowloaded CrossOver.. but when i click the keygen.exe some box opens.. but when i click run, nothing happens.. Does anyone know? 

Why does it have to be so difficult to make this work ? .. other stuff such as adobe stuff works easily.. "
,peahead777,2011-08-14T02:40Z,@burivega  I just installed the 8.02 update for Lion. After installing Final Draft became deactivated. Followed zdlasc instructions (you are awesome BTW) and now have 8.02 working!
,lizardflix,2011-09-03T04:13Z,"After the install error, I found the program in the applications program but when I try to open I go through the process but after inserting my system password, I get ""The installations of Final Draft was incomplet because of incorrect permission settings.""  I tried changing the permission settings but no luck.  

Any help?  Thanks."
,lizardflix,2011-09-03T04:20Z,Very strange.  I can actually double click on a demo screenplay and the program launches but still with the same error about installation being incomplete.  I can't do anything but see the program on the screen with the script.
,lizardflix,2011-09-03T05:23Z,"Ok, easy solution.  Download the demo from FD site, follow ZDLASC instructions and bam! Done.  Thanks.  No need for the generator and no issue about installation.  "
,marcampion,2011-09-06T00:32Z,"@peahead777 how did you install the 8.02 update for lion? it won't let me download it without a customer number, and none of the ones listed by zdlasc worked for me. "
,marcampion,2011-09-06T00:45Z,nevermind... it worked with one of the numbers. thanks dude!
,thedowjonez,2011-10-02T12:16Z,Thanks! Works great!
,GLEVANTER,2011-10-02T16:35Z,"download demo from FD site

concentrate for 2 minutes and read ZDLASC install instructions, do not have tv or music in background

interwebs magic!

i wish i knew how to do that..

,Woreyel,2011-10-10T18:07Z,"WHAT the heck is ZDLASC instructions? I googled it, and the only references it came up with is on this page!! ZDLASC if is short for something I'd REALLY like to know what heck it is..."

,mikal9300,2011-10-19T06:11Z,"hey I followed the directions and it looks like I have the full version of Final draft on my computer, I was able to go past 15 pages which I don't think the demo allows you to do (please correct me if I'm wrong on that)  however, I am unable to open final draft tagger... when i try to open it, it tells me that it ""requires an activated copy of final draft 8""  Is anyone else getting this message?  I really don't know if I have the full version of final draft now, Im assuming I do bc I was able to type past 15 pages however I am not hooked up to a printer so can't print to see if i have watermarks or not."
,Woreyel,2011-10-21T16:06Z,"Thank you wastorrent. Though to be honest, I was extremely confused by those instructions. I DID finally work it out though. Yup, call me tha dumb arse lol... Buch MUCH appreciated!!"

,mothermonster,2012-01-11T03:02Z,"2012 UPDATE: I'm a mac OS 10.7.2 (Lion) user, and while the previous instructions on page 1 work, the program crossover does not work with the new Lion update. It will run, of course, and while you will be able to generate a key, you won't be able to generate the ""code"" because the keyboard settings for crossover are not compatible with the new Lion software update. When you type in the number ""9"" for instance you may end up with the letter ""q"", and when you hit delete you might get a comma. This makes it useless for updated mac users. This torrent is very much appreciated, but if you want to open the keygen and be able to actually use it you will have to find another program like Crossover. 

This problem was referenced in a Demonoid post where someone commented: Macindows has been a real life saver for me, allowing me to use on an Intel iMac the Windows applications that I was familiar with on an HP desktop, i.e. dbPowerAmp Audio Player, dbPowerAmp Music Converter Reference Edition, Tag & Rename, PowerISO, and even Portable Monopoly 2008.

All was well under Snow Leopard and version 0.3 of Macindows. For some reason, versions 0.4 and 0.7 of Macindows never worked well for me.

But the worst was to come. Under Mac OS X Lion, the keyboard is not mapped correctly when using Macindows 0.3 and wine. As a result, most Windows applications are unusable, just because I cannot use the keyboard to change anything. For instance, when using Tag & Rename, if I type the number 1, I get a coma. And I have to type the letter e to get a BackSpace.

Thus far, the only workable solution was to keep a Snow Leopard partition where my favorite Windows applications work the way they have always worked for me, i.e. as expected with a keyboard to type any change I need."
,mothermonster,2012-01-11T05:15Z,"^ By the way, I mean the program MACINDOWS does not work well with this torrent, not crossover. I suppose crossover will work better..."

,piratitapr,2012-07-07T08:16Z,"The installation issue is just a permissions mess up with the folders. Right Click LIBRARY>GET INFO
At the bottom of the window, unlock the lock, and go to Sharing & Permissions. Change all to READ AND WRITE. Do this for these folders: The Hard Drive, Library, Final Draft, Application Support, and Final Draft 8 inside the app support. That fixed it for me. "
