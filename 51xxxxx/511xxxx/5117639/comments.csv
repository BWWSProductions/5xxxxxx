,raaj_1234,2009-10-12T11:29Z,is it race 07 ???
,starbuck1983,2009-10-29T12:22Z,"Well the cover is terrifying me now that i'm finished downloding it...
I already get Race07 but i need the add on ""Race On"" wich is not sell in my f**** country.
I trully hope this is well the add on (or includes the add on).

Thanks a lot for sharing it btw. ;o)"
,starbuck1983,2009-10-31T14:47Z,"Ok, no worries for the picture, it's really Race ON, the latest addon for Race 07, and it's working great, no bug, very easy to install and to launch.
It also includes Race07 itself and also the STCC championship.

The Formula Master car is so great, the mecanic grip is awesome. Too bad they're a little bit slower than F3000, but they handle far better.

Thanks a lot TPTB and all people involved, thank you very much. Since the game isn't available in my country, you've saved my life. :D"
,jinja_jorj,2009-12-01T20:27Z,"well i downloaded, and installed as it says in the description, i double clicked setup - it said updating dx, then it asked me for the install location so i leave it as default, then it just goes black with freeman written on it and directs me to an empty folder (where i said to install it). i waited like over 1 and a half hours and still the folder was empty and nothing had happened.. tryed in a different install location and still no luck. tryed getting rid of the demos of race on and race 07 on my pc and still no. im on windows vista 32bit and a pc perfectly capable of running the game.
any help appreciated.
cheers"
