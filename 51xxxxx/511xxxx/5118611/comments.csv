[V],Subzero!,2009-10-10T20:59Z,"well well... i dont know what i should think about you noobs sometimes... why not get a life, and leave us alone, instead moaning about something you dont have even downloaded, and this cant be downloaded anywhere else... fukken boneheads..."
,Jaffa1978,2009-10-10T21:51Z,"I'll give it a go see if its any good,havent played a decent F1 game in a while,Thanks TPTB :)"
,Jaffa1978,2009-10-10T22:01Z,"ps makay & scorpion,I've spent about a ÂŁ1000 on my pc,i wouldnt download a torrent if i didnt think it was safe.TPTB Torrents are some of the best on the net and can be trusted!!

Hey Sub,you guys going to be doing FM2010??"
[V],Subzero!,2009-10-10T22:40Z,"this game was also from me, and also had NO virus, it was your lame virus tool who recognized this exe as virus, i have the proof, go to the tptb folder and unrar the rar file to the main directory.
you will have 2 new exe files (which i previously have crunched to one file, the file your viraltool moans about). and i fukken dont care if you are building hardware sine 87... if thats true, then you have missed alot, for example what the meaning of a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics means... you see hardware and software are 2 things. and about software you dont have the slightest clue about!. anyways, please dont reply NOOB!."
,Jaffa1978,2009-10-11T00:13Z,"Subzero Vs Scorpion,this is like mortal kombat lol

Thats me just starting to download,will leave the pc uploading overnight while I'm in bed.

Hope you guys will be doing some of these games in the coming months:FM2010,Modern Warfare 2,Crysis 2 & Assassins Creed 2.
