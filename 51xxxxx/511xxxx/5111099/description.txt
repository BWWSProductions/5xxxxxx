This is Paul Edward Hadinger's amazing book Clinton's Carnage of Congress, Constitution and Country (1999) which details the systematic, even pathological, approach of the Clintons' brand of loyalists toward the eventual goal of disarming the citizenry and bringing into submission what the Administration believes to be its feudal subjects. Hadinger, a former federal agent with a top-secret clearance, wrote this gripping, behind-the-scenes examination of the plagues that have visited America through the deliberate, subversive leadership of former President William Jefferson Clinton and associates. This "leadership" is pushing this once-proud country toward subservience to the United Nations and a one-world government. The author-patriot's no-holds-barred approach and keen analysis will stir the soul and intellect of any reader truly interested in learning the depths to which this Administration has plunged his "Amerika." With willing major-media assistance, Comrade and Mrs. Clinton have pulled the proverbial wool over the eyes of the unsuspecting taxpayers of the United States. Hadinger has produced a work with pages and pages of documentation that supports his thesis. With the facts and evidence, he sends a stern warning that doesn't spare Democrats or Republicans. Will this be the book that serves as a wake-up call for the slumbering masses being led down the path to certain destruction? This book is a must read for all Americans concerned about this country. 350 pages. A must read for everyone.
