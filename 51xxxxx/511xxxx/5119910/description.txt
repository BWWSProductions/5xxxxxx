This is the French soundtrack to the original Inspector Gadget cartoon from the '80s. I believe this was taken from a record LP, so any minor noise you hear comes from that.

This is a fully tagged and edited version of the original collection that has been floating on the internet from about '08. High quality (600x600) album art has already been embedded in each file. I also included a separate JPG file of the cover.

I downloaded this LP from Niki's Transformers Music & Media Site

Aside from the first three tracks, all other tracks are instrumentals.

============== A note about my edits =================
At the end of every song, the first few milliseconds of each subsequent track was accidentally included. I removed this glitch because it was annoying and because each song already had their complete intros and therefore did not need splicing.

For example, at the end of track 8 "Chocolate Factory" it would play a snippet of the opening bars to track 9 "Rodeo". But when this happened there would be slight repeat, or skip, when track 9 switched over from track 8 because track 9 would start from the same point that the track 8 "snippet" began. This has been fixed in this release.

For those concerned about sound degradation, I used mp3DirectCut for my edits, which allows users to edit mp3s losslessly (ie, with no negative impact on quality).
