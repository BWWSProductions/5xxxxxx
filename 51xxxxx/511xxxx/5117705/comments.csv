,ozc,2009-10-25T00:13Z,"--------------------------------
I'm not sure why these are labeled HDTV when they're shrunk to 624x352.
16:9 HDTV is either 720 or 1080 lines of horizontal resolution. 4:3 Standard Definition TV is 480 lines interlaced. This is essentially progressive Standard Definition.

[T],dkent4000,2009-11-09T17:59Z,"Thanks.

I think this show is a little over the top and far too rushed, especially at the beginning. Just wish they kept it simple like before :("
