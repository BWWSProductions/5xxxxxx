,Bjurran,2009-10-06T19:55Z,"Noticed this is a new upload. Does the crack work with the updates? just installed another release, but as soon as the program updated itself, it claims that there's a licensing problem and shuts down the program."
,SCBright,2009-10-08T03:03Z,"I installed another release some months ago it worked flawlessly and now, suddenly, I got the same as described by Bjurran.
This version will correct this?"
[M],Ubehage,2009-10-08T22:39Z,No. You cannot update this one.
,Sassykatt,2009-10-09T09:47Z,Worked great! I can see many people having trouble with this without instruction however.
,nehoc,2009-10-17T20:49Z,"with crack? it's iso image and after i burned it to dvdr, ot asks for serial number or it's only trial version........."
,nehoc,2009-10-17T21:15Z,"my bad. i should go to ""browse dvd contents"", then there's crack folder with serial number... and only then back to the installation:)  thanks!"
,gretz,2009-11-24T06:52Z,"When I run the various setup.exe files and a few others, by http://virusscan.jotti.org/en malware detector, it finds a number of trojans in each.  Caveat Emptor, and check for yourself before running."
,edny,2010-02-04T23:28Z,"Serial number is accepted at the download stage but then, when you start the program it says serial number has to be renewed. So you can only use the program as trial. Do you have another serial? 
Thank you"
