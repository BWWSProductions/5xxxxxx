[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-02T13:18Z,"To all the paranoia pirates: The keygen is clean. Read some of the notes at the bottom of the torrent description (and incl. Readme.txt file):

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:

The folder in which the RAR file is is also infected and injected with Win32/TrojanClicker.Delf.NDK, Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.PCS, Win32/TrojanDropper.Joiner.AJ, Win32/TrojanProxy.Wintu.B, Win32/VB.OEK

Don't even open the folder or your pc will be infected but remove the whole folder. That's the only way to get around it, really.

@joker2395 - LOL. Funny comment. You must have had a few nerves disconnect when you posted that.

@all - This torrent is clean. KeyGens register as a trojan no matter what. Why? They generate code. Viruses also do that. But a KeyGen just generates the serial number you want. A Virus keeps going until it does whatever the heck it does to f your computer up. Thats why the AV freaks out.

True, and that's probably why they can't think and read either. I guess most of us remember the excitement n00bs feel if their scanner found something. :D"
,EvilEmpireII,2010-01-29T06:03Z,"For at least the Windows 7 64 people, the passwords are blacklisted after a while. I suggest generating several passwords and putting them in a text file since AVG will not allow you to use generator after installation. My Vista machine has not had that problem, only my Windows 7 machines have.

Yes, AVG does detect a 'trojan'. The 'trojan' is the password generator. AVG will not let you use generator after installation. Trojan or conflict of interest? 

Unfortunately, the rookies have unfairly bashed a great piece of software. thank you very much RobbingHood"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-31T00:00Z,"All pirates know or should know the following:
*************************************

Depending on the settings of AV software it may happen that suspicious files which are not packed 
(like RAR, ISO, etc) are blocked or remove when they are detected, also during downloading/uploading. 
That's why some people say that crack folder is empty, or that WinRAR cannot extract the RAR file in 
case, or that the file in case cannot be executed, or that the file in case is not a .exe file, etc etc.

Solution one is to exclude download/upload folders (and temporarily download folder from being Auto-Protected 
(or Real Time Protection, etc). Also exclude folders with cracks etc from being auto-scanned by AV software to 
avoid unwantedremoval of files.

Another option but less safe is to temporarily disable the AV software if files are blocked by AV software. 
It is safer to use the excluding folders (or files) option because everything else is still protected. 
That means that if any suspicious files are stored elsewhere when using a crack they can still be 
detected/blocked/removed by the AV sofware. 

Also Sandboxie can be used to test cracks, etc: http://www.sandboxie.com/
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]


Anyway, it's all already descibed at the torrent description and incl. Readme.txt file (of all my torrents!).
Never the less, newbies and n00bs come out of the closet everyday. Some of them learn and read in time,
some don't, and some are just trolls or people who try to frustrate the scene. 

Sometimes all the paranoia comments can be entertaining, sometimes they're not. And that's what's bothering me 
the most about the comments so far ... BORING ... LOL :D"

You are a really great member of TPB. I love all of your uploads. Props x a million.

However,
Before you jump down people's throats and call them out saying ""it works for everyone else, you must be doing something wrong"", consider the alternative.

AVG has been targeted for piracy for several years now. The 2018 expire keys have been flooding the net by the hundreds. I personally have installed this (using the keygen-different key everytime) over 100 times. Friends, family, everyone. It has worked great for a good year.

Now, I have around 60% of the people calling/texting me asking whats up. Thats proof that AVG has implimented a new update (which as you know the program updates are not able to be turned off) which runs the key against a blacklist.

It was bound to happen sooner or later. I created an account on here just to tell you. And Ill bet that the other 40% who havent contacted me lost my # or just bought something. Its happening to everyone, and they get a 15 day trial. 

Ive personally re-installed (with new keys) over 5 times, and still get killed. Even with net off during install, clearing out program files, new reinstall, everything.

So, thanks again for the great upload. 700+ seeders even now it speaks for itself that you are a VIP. Just giving a heads up that we gotta find a new patch/work around.

,froggzz,2010-04-30T00:26Z,"I hate to say this, but the Robbing is right to jump down people's throat when they comment on his/her uploads about them not working. Yes clearly AVG have been running new updates and blacklisting protocols to stop the piracy as do all AV companies. I do not see the issue with this, when you install and it works, you update. Once updated you are fine, if you get hit who cares, you've still got the very latest anti virus database for 15-30 days, depending on the length of the trial version. once that runs out reinstall again and repeat the process it is not like it takes hours out of you're life to install and uninstall a program that literally takes 15 mins to complete that process. 

@X750Fnor
You're literally a retard, if you cannot see the green skull next to the uploaders name then you should not be using TPB. There are no virus's in this file, there never will be from a trusted uploader unless the account is hacked. The reason you're AV picked up a Trojan on the keygen is because of the coding. All AV's or most will pickup a virus of some sort because they are built to recognize when .exe files or ""Keygens"" are being used, instantly notify you that there is a virus in this file and to remove it. This is only done in an attempt to stop you from pirating STOP PEOPLE A TOOL! If you download any keygen 95% of them will tell you that it is a Trojan. Download another keygen for the same file from another user and double check that, if you get the same thing then it is almost guaranteed to be a false positive created by the AV. Pirating is free, at least attempt to learn how to do it. 

@someonegotmyusername
Why don't you try using window's inbuilt firewalls and you're router to block AVG's ports for updating that way you wont be recieving any updates from the net after installation and it will be work constantly. "
,froggzz,2010-04-30T01:06Z,"On another quick note,

If you suspect this of having a trojan like many others who are not aware of the meaning of a false positive, use Sanboxie to check. If you are seriously paranoid about doing so DO NOT INSTALL THIS AT ALL. Don't try to install on a  virtual machine like people have suggested, VM's are not segregated from you're normal machine so that would be stupid.

If you don't trust the uploader you shouldn't be pirating. 

@win7 User 32/64Bit.

This works fine on BOTH OS's just because you have 64bit OS does not mean you have to install a 64bit program. This will simply appear in the section in my computer named ""Program files(x86) x86 Being 32 bit, as will all programs that are 32bit. "
,xxeroxx3,2010-05-01T07:43Z,"@froggzz
Very true. I agree that using you firewall would be a great work around for preventing program updates. It would be perfect if one port was for program updates and another was for virus definitions.

Speaking about bad things .....

All your comment is proving that you're just another n00b who doesn't read at all.
Since obviously you don't know what a false positive is I recommend to google it.
Also read some comments, torrent descriptions, incl. Readme!.txt file, and extra notes.
So I'll post a special n00b note which may help, but I don't expect anything:

* If the keygen is detected/blocked by your antivirus software then 
  add it to the exclusions lists of real-time protection and auto-scan. 
  You may need to temporarily disable real-time protection and auto-scan 
  when adding the keygen to the exclusions lists, or when using the keygen.

* If the keygen is removed by your antivirus software then restore and exclude 
  it through your antivirus (Quarantaine or History, or something similar).

,thefire83,2010-10-26T17:08Z,"Thx alot, nice one RobbingHood ;)

To the sceptic claiming this is infected, as AVG will take the keygen as a ""threat"" do the following. 
1: go to Tools
2: Advanced Settings
3: + Resident Shields (Excluded files) 
4: Add the keygen, edit.
5: Keygen is now not seen as a threat, generate and enjoy. 
Shouldnt be needed to mention, but i did it anyways in hope it helps ;) "

,dangeraus,2010-10-29T11:56Z,"@milkmilo

if you follow the instructions above the keygen will work ok.

@RobbingHood

my prob is i think im kinda stupid, lol, but when im looking for where to enter the generated key i get scared of going to the ""activate"" section under ""license"" as im not sure if this is where you register which i dont want to do obviously. is this the right place? haha, umm, stupid question number 2, the tab in the keygen i choose is ""AVG Anti-Virus"" ?

thanking in advance"
[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-29T13:33Z,"@ Robbinghood (or anyone else that might know) I have a problem that im sure others have encountered. I downloaded something that was working perfectly with a KEY then i got greedy and wanted the better version (HD version of the program) know it says ""This is a trial version.....bla bla bla"" ive uninstalled it and tried re-installing the original (working) version and THAT one says ""trial version...."" what do i need to do in order to ""undo"" the trial version crap? i know its possible but i just dont know how to do it. PLEASE help. I'm fairly new at this (as you can already see) I dont really like asking too many question BUT its the only way im going to get any better at any of this. THANKS. "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-01T02:25Z,"@dangeraus 

Yes, in the keygen choose AVG Anti-Virus. 
Your other question you've already answered yourself."
,shinobiXRT,2010-11-01T18:39Z,"the image that comes with the files seems to state choosing ""internet security"" for the keygen.

maybe thats why it hasnt worked the 3 times I have installed it.

gj in telling us"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-11-02T03:38Z,"@shinobiXRT 

Apparently you don't know how to choose the AVG version in the keygen. Good luck finding out."
,CountFrouFrou,2010-11-02T07:57Z,"Followed all the instructions. Got it installed. Keygen would not work when 'AVG Anti-Virus' was picked so tried 'AVG Internet Security' instead, which activated it. Cool so far. Asked me if I wanted add-on components and I stupidly said 'yes'. Having restarted the app and comp several times later, AVG now tells me my VDB is outdated. I hit update, it tried to and then told me to restart windows. Did that and now the neither the AV nor the ASpy works and the Resendential Shield is Not Active.

Please help. Will my uninstalling and reinstalling help? Again, choosing 'AVG Anti-Virus' in the keygen did not work. Instead, choosing 'AVG Internet Security' DID activate it. Thank you very much.

Additional note: I also installed AVG PC Tuneup right after. Could that have caused the problem? Thank you."
,CountFrouFrou,2010-11-02T08:11Z,"Got it activated but AV and ASpy do not work. Here's what I did:
1) Installed
2) Disabled AVG
3) Generated key with Keygen 3 times under 'AVG Anti-Virus' and failed
4) Tried activating with Keygen under 'AVG Internet Security' and got it activated
5) AVG asked if I wanted add-on components, I stupidly said yes.
6) It told me my db was outdated. I pressed update.
7) To cut a long story short (too late) my copy is activated but it says the AV's and ASpy's VDB check have failed and I cannot get it to update, so it won't scan.
Additional note: Above the 'AVG version 10.0.1136' it says: Virus DB: (blank)
I also installed AVG PC Tuneup right after I installed this.

Please help if you can. Thanks a million!

,CountFrouFrou,2010-11-03T04:55Z,"Really? No one can help? Look, I didn't mean to double post. Just am new and thought my 1st post was not posted because of script error. Please help. Thank you in advance."
[T],Oceanhawk,2010-11-05T20:18Z,"@ CountFrouFrou
First, Be patient. The first comment you made about needing help and your second comment about ""Really? No one can help?"" was only 1 day apart. Sometimes it take a couple of days in order for someone to respond to you because not EVERYONE is downloading this specific program and therefore your question isnt being read everyday. This is not a forum. If you need help TPB has a great forum where you can ask any question you need. 

Secondly, I wish i can help you out but i am unfamiliar with your problem and am not experienced enough to help out. Hope someone will help you. Good luck.

PS: Complaining about people not helping out with your problem is the FASTEST way to be ignored. No one likes helping those that complain about not being first. I've waited a week or more for my questions on other problems to be answered. And all that extra time allows me to look on the interent and find out the answer for myself. "

[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-14T08:31Z,"@Dariel4 

Instead of making noise about possible infected files, here are a few simple hints:

1. Learn to find out what's a virus and what's a false positive, since virus scanners don't make a difference between them.

2. Use at least a second av scanner (standalone).

3. Use Sandboxie to test files:
http://www.sandboxie.com/

Talking is the easy way, learning is the hard way, so it's all up to you."

,Dicethrwr,2011-03-13T12:39Z,"I won't judge or (try to) accuse anyone, but this torrent crippled my laptop down to 20% of it's normal performance. This may be due to AVG9 or due to a hidden process that was installed on my laptop, that was not there before. It was a process that used up 40% of my CPU and about 25% of my Memory and it also trippled my bandwidth usage. This process was obviously doing something I had not given permission for. When I tried to disable it (can be found in your startup tab in msconfig) another hidden process reactivated it instantly after pressing the apply button (something you wouldn't see if you just press Ok). The genesis of the process was a file hidden in my startup folder which I could only remove in safe mode. To sum things up, things are more suspicious as they need to be. A keygen shouldn't be flagged as a trojan, because its only use is to just display some codes based on an algorithm. Even if robbinghood says it's normal because it just changes code to make things work, it's a keygen, not a crack/no-cd/patch/fix/etc. 

You might notice I have no credibility what so ever since this is my very first post. I just wanted to say I've been a happy user of TPB for many years, but this torrent made me register an account just to explain what has happened to me this weekend.

What is it that may have caused your tripping? XTC? LSD? Speed?


Looking forward to your reply."
,RAJNIKANT_COOL,2011-03-16T17:55Z,"THANKS BRO 
IT IS VALID TILL 2018...............

THANK YOU VERY MUCH"
,djmopa,2011-03-18T02:12Z,"Thanks for the App RobbingHood!

To all the n00b's who cannot get this to work. Stop your whining, if you do know how to follow directions, then simply do not download off the net and just visit your local computer store and buy the box, just keep in mind though, your need to be able to follow those directions as well..."
,v00lo,2011-03-19T11:51Z,"@ankit9899

You probably registered the program as ""AVG Internet Security"".
Instead, go to Your AVG keygen generator and select ""AVG Anti Virus"" and simply re-register again from ""help"" panel.

If You update though, they'll probably switch You to the 15-day trial :("

,argelst0rm,2011-05-23T03:09Z,is this updated?
,gun_son,2011-05-27T12:14Z,Thank you
,Deerok420,2011-05-28T01:01Z,"for those who keeps getting the warning that your database is outdated even though you keep on updating it and it just says that there are no new updates, i found out how to get rid of that by deleting the temporary update files.... to do that:

1. Open the AVG Program.
2. On the Tools menu, click Advanced Settings.
3. On the left menu, expand the Update item, and then click Manage.
4. Click Delete temporary update files, and then click Yes.
5. Try to update AVG.

P.S. if that still doesn't work for you, i have another option by manually installing updates ... 

BTW i just changed to RH's AVG today because his latest version of avast keeps eating it's own ashbase.dll(even though i added it in it's exclusion lists) making it not work anymore since the ashbase.dll is in it's own virus chest XD

also you may want to download RH's malwarebytes' anti-malware .... AVG and mbam are currently protecting my laptop as of now :D


Thanks Brad88 *Thumbs up* It worked"
,mowner,2011-05-30T21:53Z,"NOTE: Please do not forget to leave behind as much information as possible  
about where the product is from and about your personal identification data. 
You'll then be contacted as soon as possible by the AVG Support Team! 

-what does that mean?"

That means that there might be a troll around, so watch out. ^-^"

,DemonicBlaze,2011-07-14T12:22Z,Cool cool... Works... Got tired of eSET thinking it can just quarantine anything it fucking wants. (cracks to games). So this works. Thanks Robin. You make tpb a better place.
,lang345,2011-07-25T05:33Z,"i kinda wish TPB would add a filter to auto delet when people say dumb shyt like ""Trojan in the Keygen"" or ""It's a fake"" or "" AV says the crack is a trojan"" it would be great if it did that if you had a certain number of DL's or Seeder... >.> "
,epet,2011-08-02T03:35Z,"Might seem like a dumb question but my software says that its outdated also, but does that still mean its working and protecting my comp?"
,washokd,2011-08-05T20:10Z,Hahahaha AVG found the keygen as a trojan horse. Probably just a false positive
,Gooner_Boi,2011-08-08T23:02Z,Thanks Uploader Works Great On My PC And My Sony Vaio Notebook

What can I do?"
,Sheppy99,2012-04-06T06:02Z,"@Keepvogel, Keygen (Key generators) are almost always detected as viruses. Do a little research before you say something is a virus. Do you really think over 400 people would be seeding something with a virus? Come on, use your head a little bit. This program works great"
