After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
            
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	            
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	            
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce            
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce            
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce            
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce            
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce            
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

The Book Of Lost Tales, like Tolkien's, has a long history...

Two years ago, one of my hard disks deceased after a glorious long life and during its agony some sectors were damaged... Unfortunately these sectors contained the directory information of the incoming folder of my guitar albums: 60 albums, more or less, were reduced to a long list of FILEnnnn.CHK names, the unidentified chunk files left by the system after a recovery. Somebody has the creeps remembering analogous nightmarish experiences?

I stared at the screen, toggling in my mind between "ice cream" and "I scream"... then I decided to keep those 900 chunks for a future reidentification try.

Last weekend, rambling on my archives, I stumbled on them again and so I decided to try and with the help of a Ultra Editor (which opens even the stones) and of the Winamp Playlist Window I made it to have back the 90% of the albums.

You see, dragging the chunks on the Winamp Playlist, the ones which had well defined tags within showed their original titles; the others were inspected with the editor (it does not need a genius to perform a search on multiple files, looking for "JFIF" in the header... that way I recovered the cover images. Searching "wma" I had back the Windows Media Audio ones). 

For some of them the identification was really tricky. 
I recognized Franco Morone - Italian Fingerstyle Guitar album only 'cause I knew those traditional tunes.
I recognized Bert Jansch - Poor Mouth album, starting from "St Fiacre Revenge" tune that I practised on Stefan Grossman scores books and then checking his discography (which is huge!). I made it to put the titles only 'cause I just had another album (A Rare Conundrum - Poor Mouth) of worse quality which contained all the tunes.
Still I have 20 beautiful tunes that I was unable to say whom they belong and that I haven't included.
Also some incomplete albums are missing.
I've included "Davey Graham - Goddington Boundry" and "David Russell - Music of Barrios" even if the former has two damaged tracks and the latter a truncated one, but they probably were in this condition since I downloaded them... Anyway these are beautiful albums...

So in the end... here they are: mostly fingerstyle but not only.
You will find for instance an old beautiful album of Peter Finger: "The Elf King - Acoustic Rock Guitar"...
You will find the last posthumous Robbie Basho album "Twilight Peaks" (that you can find in other places as I discovered on these last days... 
You will find a bunch of Adrian Legg albums which can make you caper in your room, screaming "yeah" or "whooa"...
You will find many more... Take a look at the following list
and... Enjoy, guitar lovers :)
