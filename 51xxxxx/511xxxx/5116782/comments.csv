Original uploader: Thanks, but try checking the stuff before you post."

To brigton, Huh?  I just burned the first ISO with ImgBurn and its working perfectly.  Try burning at a much slower speed or use ImgBurn to get a good burn. 

The only glitch, it wouldn't play videos in FireFox.  I had to make IE my default browser to get it to work.  As soon as I let TrainSignal use IE instead of Firefox everything worked.

Looks and works a little better than the CBT nugget cd's I have. Again thanks for a smokin upload. :-)"
