"The Elements of Lebesgue Measure and Integration" by Bartle
This is a classic book that will teach you everything you need to 
know about the construction of the Lebesgue integral, with enough 
abstract measure theory to do it all properly. 

This book is in two sections about measure theory and integration.
Its about as short and sweet as it could be and still pack in the 
material. One of the best things about this book is the exercises - 
if you go through every one you will never be unclear on a property 
of a Radon measure or of Lebesgue integrable functions. If you're 
an applied mathematician this will be the last book on measure theory
you'll ever read or need. If you're a pure mathematician this is 
where you jump in - then try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4894188/
