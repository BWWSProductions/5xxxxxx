Cut in the summer of 1971 at Mr. Kelly's, a Chicago club on the Near North Side, "Muddy Waters Live (at Mr. Kelly's)" finds Muddy in fine form, working with his excellent early-70s band which included Joe "Pinetop" Perkins (piano), drummer Willie "Big Eyes" Smith, bassist Calvin "Fuzz" Jones, and guitarists Samuel Lawhorn and James "Pee Wee" Madison. The masterful James Cotton appears under a pseudonym, as he was under contract with another label, blowing the harp on three songs. On the remaining nine songs it is 21-year-old Paul Oscher playing fine, muscular harmonica parts.
