     I've done my best to rid this upload from viruses, but be on your toes. I doubt that there are any though.


     And now, the fun part: for you guitar geeks (like myself), here's an easy-to-learn tab for "A Hero Comes Home" (in case you seem to have lost your lyre):


     E:--------3-----------3-----------------------------------------------|
     B:------3---3-------3---3-------3-----------1-----------------------1-|
     G:----3-------3---3-------3---3-------3---2-------2-----2-----3---2---|
     D:--5-----------5-----------5-------5---3-------3-----3-----5---3---- |
     A:--------------------------------6-----------5-----5-----6-----------|
     E:--------------------------------------------------------------------|


     (repeat from the beginning, this goes trough the whole song - listen and play)

     Thanks to anyone who wrote this tab!
