,jeasuz,2010-05-06T23:02Z,"guys, to use this go into iTunes with your ipod plugged in. go to your ipods section, where it you have the option to ""restore"" the ipod.

next, you hold Shift and left click on ""restore"", you then browse to find the file you downloaded in this torrent and select it... voila! itunes will upgrade your ipod to this firmware version (3.1.2)"
