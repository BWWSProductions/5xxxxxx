[V],BLACKTROY,2009-10-09T11:56Z,"Best software so far. once you install it bye bye to hackers and malware. no more buying antivirus software. i ve been usuing this software for almost 4 years now.nothing like spyware or virus on my pc.
infact i got the retail version. peace of mind, just deepfreeeze both your c and d drive, use flash drive on your pc as your open drive. my pc is still fast. as if i bought yesterday. nothing come close. trust me folks"

,awudu,2009-11-24T14:00Z,"Is there any tool to clean deep freeze from my system?
I thawed it, then uninstalled it then restarted the system but now whenever i clicked on the setup file, it says something like ""This install is not the same as the deep freeze installed. The only option is ""OK"" button, when I click on it, the wizard part where you choose the drive to freeze just flash and goes away without letting you see anything. I tried in safe mode but still same problem. I have deleted the files and folders in c:\program files\  but still.
I even deleted registry keys..
