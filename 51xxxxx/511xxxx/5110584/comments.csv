,taloeki,2009-10-08T09:36Z,Ain't no 320 kbps at all...
,dieralo,2009-10-09T05:52Z,"only the b-sides are not... as you know the third one hasn't been released yet... so the first two albums are 320 kbps... and if I'm not wrong, An End Has A Start is the only one uploaded at 320 kpbs here on TPB... sorry mates... the best I can do!!! :S"
,rpgmaker,2010-05-31T18:13Z,@dieralo: Thanks for the upload but don't say they're all 320kbps if that's not the case.
,ch_eddy,2010-07-31T14:10Z,File seems bugged. E.g. Windows alert at 0.28 in Papillon...
,Shu_Pac,2010-08-11T13:41Z,"just for your info - you messed up when you ripped song Papillon from third album In This Light And On This Evening. After the fourth verse ''..fell love before it's gone'' (timer - 00:30) you can hear windows warning sound in the background.

Other than that nice job - especially for B sides - THNX a lot  (anyway Papillon can be downloaded from a thousand torrents :-)  )"
,luger54,2010-09-30T23:14Z,all of you gays who are not happy with the free copies of the bit rate of these labels: why dont you go and moan to your mothers after buying the fucking cds which you can convert at 320kbps???
,wayne-mcg,2011-07-08T20:27Z,"great work, and you even gave us the lyrics, def guna seed :)"
,D3C3PT3C0N,2012-05-20T01:39Z,It's free and you still complain. Spoiled bastards. Great torrent. Love British music.
