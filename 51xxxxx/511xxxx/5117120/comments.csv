However, next time could you rip CDs as ordinary FLAC instead of APE. APE is a pain in the behind as I don't burn onto CD but play it directly from my hard drive and the only thing on Windows that plays APE is MPC, and MPC is not really a music player but more for Home Cinema. With normal FLAC I can play back on anything.

Anyway, Cheers and Thanks again."

use foobar2000 or songbird 1.2.0 to play ape"

Thanks very much for your help. I used foobar many years ago but abandoned it for winamp. Now I'm getting reacquainted with foobar again. Best of all, foobar can convert all my APE files back into standard FLAC. Yeah! 

Thanks and Cheers mate."

* Better compression than FLAC
* Plays with Winamp and many other players
* Older and more mature than FLAC

Thanks a lot for the great upload"
,dezzert,2010-04-06T00:57Z,"I wonder though, why do you have to put all the movements into one single file? I've noticed that a lot of people are doing this. I'm I missing something here?"
