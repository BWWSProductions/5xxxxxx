,zed64b,2011-01-10T18:55Z,"During installation process it's asked if you want to ""send anonymous information"" to improve the game.
Of course you don't want that, because it can make your game ""crash"". You must uncheck this box. 
IMO"
,zed64b,2011-01-11T20:27Z,"CORRECTION:
In Game Options, Preferences, disable Allow Anonymous Data Collection.
And use CMLauncher.exe to run the game."
