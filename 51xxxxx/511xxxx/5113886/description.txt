Boo! was a South African band. They described their music as "Monki Punk". They entered the South African music scene in October 1997, but grew especially famous in Europe. The band disbanded in 2004, and is currently mostly known as Chris Chameleon's previous band.

Boo! consisted of three members. The cross-dressing "Miss" Chris Chameleon played bass guitar and provided lead vocals. He also wrote all the music and lyrics. The drummer was Princess Leonie, and Ampie Omo, filled in the rest of the sounds on trumpet, trombone, keyboard and percussion instruments.

Boo! acquired a worldwide cult following by performing 800 gigs in 17 countries, including 14 states in the USA. Boo! performed at many music festivals, appearing on the same stage as the White Stripes, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Franz Ferdinand, Cypress Hill, Coldplay and many more.
