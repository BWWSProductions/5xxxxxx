,lovett01,2011-07-05T16:50Z,i downloaded it and replaced the file with the one in the crack folder. When i open it the terragen loading screen comes up for a few seconds as if its working but then and error message appears and it crashes. Any ideas?

I downloaded it and it works as smooth as sex. Also it's a bit higher version, so have a nice warm orgasm."
