"Today was a good day for a rock show and Valentines did not disappoint
While sipping my Genny Cream Ale and reading over this weeks Metroland (I was
happy to see Sgt. Dunbar listed in the number two spot for the readers pick
Best Alternative Band everyone knows the saying, first is the worst, however
I am not sure how they escaped third I ve seen Louis s braided chest hair
and well anyways), I eagerly awaited for the music to begin. The three
members of Document flooded the downstairs of Valentines with a wall of
sound that swooped and crashed together like an ocean sinking a life boat
The singer/guitarists scratchy voice poured out over the riff rock in a
similar style to Murder By Death, the kind of voice that made you question if
he ate or smoked cigarettes. The drums start stop flow mirrored that of the
guitar as they danced in a flutter of delay and super shifters forming a post
punk feel reminiscent of pre-Domestica Cursive (whom they are rumored to be
opening up for April 20th). In an instant tribal drums sprint into action
accompanied with an overdriven bass and a Mars Volta guitar solo that makes
you watch the pedal board just as much as the neck work. Each time the sound
explored to the edge of cohesiveness it was wrestled back by piercing vocals
After the show I purchased their debut CD Empires which was recorded by
Document s drummer, Jeff Rendano. Jeff owns and operates his own studio out
of Monroe, New York called Boomstick Recording. The band is currently working
on a followup to Empires and booking a tour to show it off. "
