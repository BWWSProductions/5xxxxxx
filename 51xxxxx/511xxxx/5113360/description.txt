The original DVD's as ISO's.. 
Mind you they are DVD9 iso's so each one is over 7GB in general.
Hence the gigantic download, but it's more than worth it imho.

Most episodes include: 
 - director commentary (hilarious, really suggest you check them out)
 - alternate aspect (watch episodes as sketches!)
 - Irkin Subtitling (lol completely useless)
