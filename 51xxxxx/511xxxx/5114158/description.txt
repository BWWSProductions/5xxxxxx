From Wiki:


INXS (pronounced "in excess") is an Australian rock band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney.[1][2] Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar/sax.[3] For twenty years, they were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose "sultry good looks" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band.[1][3] Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style,[1] including funk and dance elements.

INXS achieved international success with a series of hit recordings through the 1980s and 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, X and Welcome to Wherever You Are and the singles "Original Sin", "Need You Tonight", "Devil Inside" and "New Sensation".[4][5][6][7]

Hutchence died in 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year,[1]. The band made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002.[2]

In 2005, members of INXS participated in a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J. D. Fortune, and the release of "Pretty Vegas" and "Afterglow" as singles, and its album Switch.[7][6][8]

INXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992[9], and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001.[10][11]. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.

Welcome to Wherever You Are  1992



Welcome to Wherever You Are is an album by the Australian rock and roll group INXS, released in 1992. With grunge music and alternative music breaking into the mainstream, INXS tried to establish a new direction for itself, Ã  la U2 and Achtung Baby, incorporating sitars, a 60-piece orchestra, and a much more "raw" sound to their music. In its four star review of the album, Q called it "...a far more engaging and heartfelt collection than anything the group has put out in recent memory... It rocks," and listed it as one of the 50 Best Albums of 1992.

Ultimately, however, with lack of promotion by their label and the band not touring for the album (wanting a break), the record failed to match the success of INXS's two previous albums, Kick and X. However, it still reached #1 in the UK, but the band's popularity soon waned. While the single "Baby Don't Cry" was a Top 20 hit in the UK, the album's biggest American hit was "Not Enough Time", which reached #2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, and stayed there for five consecutive weeks.

In 2002, a remastered version of the album was released that included five previously unreleased tracks.

Tracks: 


1.	"Questions" â€“ 2:07
2.	"Heaven Sent" â€“ 3:18

Max Q 1989


Max Q was a short-lived Australian rock band in the late 1980s, fronted by Michael Hutchence of INXS with musical direction by Ollie Olsen.


Max Q consisted of Hutchence (vocals) and Ollie Olsen (songwriting and production) who were accompanied by key members of the Melbourne post-punk scene, most of whom had previously collaborated with Olsen. The project followed on from Hutchence and Olsen's work on the film Dogs In Space, where they met.

Max Q released their sole self-titled album in 1989 and had minor hits with the songs "Sometimes" (originally recorded by Olsen with Orchestra Of Skin And Bone) and "Way of the World". The album was more critically-acclaimed than commercially successful, and ever since it went out of print, it has yet to be re-issued. Also, the band had never performed any live shows. [1]

In October 2006, two Max Q songs were featured in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown which had been voted by listeners which were "Sometimes" (ranked 1301 out of 2006 songs) and "Way of the World" (ranked 716 out of 2006 songs).

Michael Hutchence 1999


INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence began work on what would become his posthumous solo album in 1995. Following his death in 1997, Black Grape producer Danny Saber and ex-Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill completed the album. U2 singer, and Hutchence's friend, Bono recorded lyrics which were added to the track "Slide Away." The album was finally released in 1999 and was largely overlooked due to lack of promotion by the label V2.

Michael also recorded the songs, "Let the People Talk" and "Standing on the Rooftop" for this album but it didn't make the album. They acted as b-sides for the singles "Straight Line" and "Slide Away".

This album was simply dedicated to "Tiger". This is in reference to his daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence.

Stay Young â€“ The Deluxe Years (1979 â€“ 1982) 2001


Stay Young 1979-1982 is a two disc compilation of Australian rock group INXS's earlier works. It features their first two albums, INXS and Underneath the Colours, along with all the b-sides "We Are the Vegetables", "Scratch", "The Unloved One", "Lacavocal" and "Prehistoria". It also features some demos "Telefone", "Silent Night" and "Breakaway" performed at ABC Studios in Sydney (1979), live songs "Reckless Ways", "Pretzel Logic", "Reasons", "Feeling Good" and "Miss Shapiro/You Really Got Me" (performed at the Manly Vale Hotel in Sydney, October 1980) "On A Bus" and "The One Thing" (performed at Wanda Beach in Sydney, January 1982), and the band performing their earlier songs in 1992 at a soundcheck, "Barbarian", "Just Keep Walking", "In Vain" and "Stay Young" (recorded during the Full Moon, Dirty Hearts session on the 24th of November 1992 in Capri, Italy). It also features "Speed Kills" (a song recorded with Australian band Cold Chisel for the Freedom movie soundtrack), and a re-recording of the song "Underneath the Colours" as a UK-only b-side for "Beautiful Girl" in 1992.

Note: "Simple Simon" and "The Loved One" were each released as a single only. "The Loved One" was actually a re-recording, originally released by The Loved Ones in 1964. It was later re-recorded in 1987 for INXS' sixth studio album, Kick.
