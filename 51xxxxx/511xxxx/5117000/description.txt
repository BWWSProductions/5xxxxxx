This time I made 2 Covers. One is

History Channel - Ancient Aliens

and other is

History Channel - Ancient Aliens + UFO Conspiracy (one cover for both)

if u Download both these DVDs and you want to save some space on your DVD shelf like I did, so you can put them both in one 2DVD box.
I made it like History Channel cover so it doesn't jump out by appearance.

'Till the next one...

N-joy
