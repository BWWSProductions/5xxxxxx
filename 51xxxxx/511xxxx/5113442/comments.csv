I am looking for the disc image of this software. "
,gordy99,2009-10-08T16:39Z,Kind of strange.  CD1 is the 10.2.4000.4 Symantec Corporate Client Antivirus as advertised.  This is for Vista or Win 7.  CD2 is a very old version 10.1.0.238 for XP.

You may use UltraISO or even freware ImgBurn to make iso for yourself."
,Eugenij,2009-10-08T18:16Z,"all files was download from http://esdownload.symantec.com and then can submit a wrong version, or recommend a old version to XP"
[S],velvet.,2009-12-29T18:25Z,"@brandy_cv:

You are missing my point.
I am looking for ISO disc images of the original Symantec  software installation discs.
I'm not interested in creating reconstituted ones from a file dump."
