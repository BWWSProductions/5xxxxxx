The Blair Thumb

Created by the writer of "The Nutty
Professor," "Ace Ventura: When Nature
Calls" and "Patch Adams," this second
installment in the Thumbation series
is a clever tale about three thumbs
who travel into the woods to make a
documentary about a local urban legend.

One year later, the thumbs' video
equipment is found, the footage compiled
and made into a chilling movie about the
terror the students encountered during
their search for the truth behind
The Blair Thumb.
