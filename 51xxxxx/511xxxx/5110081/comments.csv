Many programs when runned go to internet to check if the license you have used is legit or not. Obviously one generated by a Keygen it's very difficult will be so, but it will be enough to block the access to internet using a firewall, even if disconnecting the cable it's a little drastic but effective..."

Here is the real link:

[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-04T21:28Z,"You can still use this version, but the Setup and Keygen/Patch are for v4.5.1, and the Portable needs blocking internet access when runned. Apart this, it's working, but you better get the fixed version to the link above..."
,jersson,2009-10-05T01:14Z,"Yeah the fixed one works just fine, thank's. Is it possible to make a portable or a precracked vers of Diskeeper 2009 ? Iv'e got 2008 version but 2009 vers has a lot of improvements."
