Current ratio is 7..."
,dearleuk,2009-10-17T13:26Z,Thanks very much
,fife5,2010-01-12T16:51Z,"hI, - Just started downloading. Thanks. You can see from my list (I think) that I do continue to seed so , tfynnhk, please stick with it and I will keep seeding. "
,Windy88,2011-05-31T12:37Z,This torrent seems to be dead - is anyone seeding? (Or - is there anyone who has the files already and could sort me out with a copy of 061221 - Sir Gawain and the Green Knight?)
,Windy88,2011-06-01T11:12Z,"Scratch that, either someone came online or I sorted out a problem at my end! Anyway, I'll seed what I've got, though for now that's just the Gawain I mentioned."
,dentalrecords,2011-06-28T08:53Z,"This is a great upload, thanks for taking the time to compile and make available for others.  I would dearly love access to any other files you may have so will continue to seed this on a permanent basis.  peas and love."
,oniscoid,2011-07-04T08:06Z,thanks for taking the time to share -- would love to see uploads for 2007 and 2008 (and later) - will seed until 10+ seeders
,PrincessPink,2011-07-22T13:37Z,Do you have the Radio 4 play about George Orwell (Eric Blair). It was broadcast in the last year or so on Radio 4? I heard it and was so impressed by the quality of the writing and performances. Don't remember the title.
,pondpaul,2012-05-10T20:11Z,I to would love to see 2007 and 2008#I notice 060517 is not correct as it is only 3kb not the usual 10991 kb
