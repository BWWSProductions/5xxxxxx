The Wests are a one-family crime wave with a proud tradition in thievery, larceny and petty crime. Or at least they used to be. At the beginning of series one, family matriarch Cheryl West decided enough was enough - the family must clean up their and go straight.

But it hasn't been easy for Cheryl, keeping the family together when outside forces threaten to tear them apart.

The West family's relationship with the dodgy Greegan siblings continues to raise eyebrows: Pascalle is engaged to Nicky while has shacked up with pregnant Sheree. There's a new cop in town threatening everything Van holds dear forcing him to do what a West should never do. Jethro, Loretta and Hayden form an unlikely business alliance while Pascalle follows her dreams of becoming a successful bag lady. Ted and Ngaire prove old is the new young and Munter and Kasey prov that there's more than one way to make a baby. Judd fights for his family, old and new, as Cheryl might be about to lose everything she loves most

Can the West family survive the biggest crisis yet?
