,Fanoftransformers,2009-12-28T00:19Z,Thanks for the full series 5! Waiting for series 6 to air!
,PSPnoObmOd,2010-01-08T10:35Z,"Thanks for this. I downloaded this while I save to get the DVD as I bought series 1,2,3 & 4 already :P
Its is a TVRip, so the TV3 water mark in the corner is a tiny tiny tiny bit annoying, but other than that, very good quality :) It downloaded SUPER fast too!"
,hollylindin,2010-06-24T17:57Z,"You would be super amazing if you uploaded the series six episodes as they air.  ;)  I'm in Canada, so torrent's the only way I can see one of my favourite shows of all time!

Much Peace, Unity, Love, and Light to you!

Please please please!"
,aroyals,2011-03-04T07:26Z,"ty for the torrent but why would you describe the whole season in your description???

i am already at ep 7 so nothing spoiled for me luckily (hopefully this torrent's ep 10 doesn't give me 500 ""element not found"" errors like the last 1 did)"
