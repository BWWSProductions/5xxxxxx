HereÂ´s some tracks that a friend of mine recorded for me personally to play in the car. Just some hints and ideas, all improvisations on a Roland synthesizer. All more or less relaxing, new age like music. As a jazz impro pianist he couldnÂ´t help putting in a blue note here and there. I hear a future soundtrack now and then.

Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea to share his music with other people, so feel free to download without having an uneasy conscience, since thereÂ´s no copyright on the tracks. 

Leave your comments and requests down below here. He might make a â€œfull albumâ€ in the style of one of the tracks that people like most.
Enjoy!
