The fire team leader is responsible for issuing specific commands, such as directing suppressing fire, setting way points and instigating flanking manoeuvres. Similarly, if players take control of a vehicle during a mission, roles specific to that vehicle become available, such as driver, commander, gunner or co-pilot in a helicopter. %u201CGood communication between fire team members is hugely important, especially when mission objectives can be handled in multiple ways. The successful co-op team will learn authentic USMC tactics via the command radial and gameplay encourages the discussion of those tactics; that%u2019s the key to winning the battle and ultimately the war,%u201D continued Lenton. %u201CIt%u2019s a thoroughly immersive co-op experience; the tense atmosphere becomes especially apparent in the spec ops missions, where players will find themselves whispering commands to each other as they become gripped by the fear of being discovered by the enemy.%u201D In addition to the campaign, the game%u2019s individual single missions, once completed, can be set up as self contained co-op games. This enables players to jump straight to their favourite missions have up to 3 players to join as part of their unit. Co-op play also offers re-spawn points at checkpoints gameplay that encourages the fire team to stick together.
