Lisa Robin Kelly played Laurie Foreman, Eric's slutty sister from THAT 70s SHOW. After three seasons, she could no longer hide her personal problems with heroine and other drugs, and she left the show. She tried rehab and even came back for a few episodes during season five, but was ultimately replaced altogether by Christina Moore, who, it seemed, was given as few lines as possible. Lisa made only one other film after THAT 70s SHOW. In 2006, desperate for money, she posed nude one time only under the name "Starr".
