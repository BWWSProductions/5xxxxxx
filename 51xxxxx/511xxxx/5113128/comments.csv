,Glowdog,2009-10-07T23:45Z,Not even close!
,D0gmeat,2009-10-08T01:02Z,It's only her if she got a hold of a time machine and came back in time 20 years to our present and the first thing any time traveller does is get out and get some hardcore pictures taken of them. LOL. Heroin user is definitely true unless this MIDLF (Mothers I Don't Like to Fuck) just donated blood before the photoshoot. ;)
,michaelingeorgia,2009-10-08T01:05Z,"According to IMDB, Lisa was born in 1970. She was made to appear somewhat younger on the show, not to mention the big 70s hair. She was considerably skinnier. So I'm not quite sure when the time machine fits in. "
,D0gmeat,2009-10-08T01:56Z,"LOL. If that thing is 39, then they should make a PSA with her to let kids know they really should just say no to drugs. That chick looks like she would qualify for Senior's Night at Denny's without being carded. And by the looks of things, been there more than once - on the same night."
,brianxxx,2009-10-08T20:24Z,"The age dispute is nice but I don't think that is close to being her at all. The facial structure is way off. The way her eyes are placed in relation to the nose, the height or size of the forehead. Drugs messes you up but it does not change facial bone structure. lol

Someone is having fun passing these off. There are no news stories about her doing nude, going nude, etc.

Too bad. I was sick enough to want to see her naked. lol"

but other than that..."
