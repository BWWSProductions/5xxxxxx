Indeed there have been some problems reported, although I use Mac OS X 10.5 and have not had any of these problems.

However these problems are (mostly) caused by the Application Enhancer itself, and not The Bad APE.

What I would advise you and other people who have these types of issues using The Bad APE is to upgrade to the latest version of Application Enhancer.

You can download the latest version here:

If this does not solve your problems then you will probably have to look for another way of cracking your programs."

You're welcome, and indeed, its a pity it doesn't work with Snow Leopard, I hope they'll release an update soon."
