Notes
----------------
This crack will work with all versions of Milestone Reminder, including the ones when it was called Birthday Reminder, as long as you do not uninstall The Bad APE.

It is perfectly safe to update the application as you normally would if you'd bought it, the crack will continue to work as long as they do not completely change how registration works.

Please seed this for as long as possible, as my Internet connection is very slow and I will not be able to seed very fast.
