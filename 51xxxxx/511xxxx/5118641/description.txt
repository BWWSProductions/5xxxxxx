Storyline: It is said that Halloween is the night when the dead rise to walk among us 
and other unspeakable things roam free. The rituals of All Hallows Eve were devised to protect us from their evil mischief, 
and one small town is about to be taught a terrifying lesson that some traditions are best not forgotten. Nothing is what it 
seems when a suburban couple learns the dangers of blowing out a Jack-o-Lantern before midnight; four women cross paths with 
a costumed stalker at a local festival; a group of pranksters goes too far and discovers the horrifying truth buried in a 
local legend; and a cantankerous old hermit is visited by a strange trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick. Costumes and 
candy, ghouls and goblins, monsters and mayhem... the tricks and treats of Halloween turn deadly as strange creatures of 
every variety-human and otherwise-try to survive the scariest night of the year.
