Network Map Does Not Display Computers Running Windows XP

Updated: July 9, 2009

Applies To: Windows Vista

When you run Network Map in Windows VistaÂ®, computers that are running WindowsÂ® XP do not appear on the completed diagram.
Cause

Network Map in Windows Vista diagrams the connections between network devices to help you troubleshoot connectivity problems. Network Map uses a discovery protocol called Link-Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) in order to query the other devices on the network to determine how the network is organized. Computers that are running Windows Vista include the software components that implement the LLTD protocol. For network computers that are running Windows XP to appear on the map, they must have a discovery protocol enabled that can respond to the mapping computer's requests.
Solution on Windows XP

For computers running Windows XP to appear on the Network Map diagram, you must download and install the LLTD Responder component. By installing the LLTD Responder, and enabling File and Printer Sharing in Windows Firewall, a computer running Windows XP can respond to other Windows Vista computers on the network that are attempting to create a network map.

The following procedures are performed on a computer running Windows XP.

To install the LLTD Responder onto a computer running Windows XP

   1. Download the update appropriate for your version of Windows:

          * If you are running Windows XP with no service pack, with Service Pack 1 (SP1), or with SP2, download the update from here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70582.

   2. Run the update on the computer running Windows XP that you want to appear on the Network Map.

   3. On the Software Update Installation Wizard, click Next.

   4. On the License Agreement page, read the license agreement, and if you agree to the terms, click I Agree, and then click Next.

   5. On the final page of the wizard, click Finish.

   6. If you are prompted to do so, restart your computer.
