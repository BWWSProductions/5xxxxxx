,ieniemaxi,2009-10-10T22:01Z,"its  fake......the problem is that you have to be registered at ""usenext"" u can get a trail version for 14 days for free, than u can download this one.

There is nothing at it that this needs to be cracked, but without an account at usenext u can not rip this music!!!

Hammer u r a bad uploader!!!!!!"
,graif00,2009-10-11T05:13Z,"Hello. This is not exactly a fake but it's a waste of space and bandwidth. It has the 30 seconds of each song and then a lot of crap (static). I've uploaded a new torrent. It has the 30 first seconds of each song, but it doesnt have the static that this one has. Here's the url: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5119305  Enjoy."
,chunky_norwich,2009-10-11T13:43Z,I wonder whether the '02' next to the uploaders name represents his IQ points.
,nicoletta,2009-10-11T16:49Z,Probably yes his IQ :-)
