,Tooting,2009-10-10T11:35Z,Thanks.
,peter980,2009-10-10T14:04Z,Thanks! Can't believe no group released this.
,koka3,2009-10-10T14:41Z,Thanks
,donno69,2009-10-10T16:49Z,"Hmmm...for some reason the sound has an echo, hearing everything twice. And I did use the (Fixed) version."
,lgnd91,2009-10-10T16:57Z,Thanks for your work!
,Aber1,2009-10-10T21:57Z,"Thanks for this...  Too bad it sucks and the sound is so distorted you cant understand what is being said.  Why upload something so terrible with the the word ""fixed"" in the title?  Your a loser and your upload sucks."
,donno69,2009-10-10T22:09Z,"Hey Aber1 stop being a dick, at least he's giving it a go. No-one else has put it up so be thankful he's tried to do the right thing by us all, ya asshole."
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-10-10T23:24Z,"This is a vast improvement from the NON-fixed version he uploaded.  The video quality isn't great and the audio is only 96kbps, but it's in sync, there are no weird distortions, and the audio is COMPLETELY understandable.

So this is a fairly good watchable version.  Of course, we'd all prefer a nice perfect 720p rip with all the fixings, but considering that morph-GB was the only one to actually CAP this episode so far, congratulations and thanks are in order."
,harms1,2009-10-10T23:32Z,"When i play it with Quick time player the sound is an echo, but with VLC player sound was normal"
,donno69,2009-10-10T23:48Z,"Thanks for the tip harms1, works a treat now."
,morph-GB,2009-10-10T23:56Z,"96kbps is perfectly fine for AAC-LC. I could have even gone as low as 64kbps with AAC-HE+, but then I think I would have lost iPod compatibility. The video quality is lower probably because the source is analog cable instead of digital or HD. Like I said, I'm working on getting that equipment, but it might be a while."
,morph-GB,2009-10-10T23:56Z,"Actually, I technically could have left it at the original 384kbps mpeg2 audio track, but I thought the space saved was worth the recompression."
,morph-GB,2009-10-11T03:47Z,"like I said I'd love to provide better quality, and I have before, but the recent economy took  quite a toll on me, and this is the best I can provide at the moment. If I get better equipment obviously I'd provide better quality."
,morph-GB,2009-10-11T05:01Z,"I figured out why it echoes in QuickTime. For some reason, I accidentally put 2 audio streams in the file instead of 1, and the second audio stream is slightly off sync. QuickTime must be playing both streams at once.

I can confirm it does not echo on an iPhone."
,younso,2009-10-11T10:29Z,"sound or no sound, I thought this show was popular. Why are there no more releases of it out there? Season 1 had a lot more releases."
,younso,2009-10-11T11:29Z,"also, the picture seems to be clipped unfortunately :("
,morph-GB,2009-10-12T02:55Z,"the only clipping was clipping the black bars off of the top and bottom, since this was originally a 16x9 source, but was captured in 4x3 analog cable."
,OmgYouAreSoDead,2009-10-15T04:33Z,"Much Better Quality 1280 x 720 vid with the link below although i had to play it with VLC because it uses another audio codec.
