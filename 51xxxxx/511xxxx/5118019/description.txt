I uploaded this file because I didn't see any other versions uploaded tonight. I don't know if I will continue to upload these or not. I guess it depends on the reliability of other Clone Wars uploaders.

To my fans: I'm unlikely to upload any other series, especially in HD, at least for now. I'm working on buying an HD Tuner for my PC right now, but it might be a while before I have the money, and the shows I normally capture have already started airing.
