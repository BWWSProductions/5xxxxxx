please someone put an english version up"
[V],neon,2009-10-10T22:15Z,hello extremezone..any idea when english version will be out. 
,oscarthebrown,2009-10-11T18:47Z,"i dont get all the spanish rips coming out first, this movie came out in uk cine a while ago, i mean surely if the dubbers have the original version to dub they shoul have a english copy?  anyone know why spaniards get releases first?"
,dlarrym,2009-10-12T22:46Z,I wonder the same thing about how the spanish seem to have every title 1st????? I have no idea... I saw this movie on the big screen and it was AWESOME!!!  very cool twist in it...If anyone can get an english rip of this I would be VERY GRATEFUL... I have been searching for this flick online for months and months. It was a Limited release here in the USA.  It played at many cine. but would only play for 3 or 4 days before it was no longer showing...

Im guessing each country (within limits) gets given their own copies but the spanish and greeks are so big on showing pirate video's in their bars during the day they as it's not illegal there and if it is the police don't do anything as it brings in trade, they have a time scedule for pirate films throughout the day,,, that's why i think the spanish and greek get them first,,, 

Anyway id rather wait and understand the person speaking rather than have a dirty dubbed version,,, they gain nothing in my opinion lol....... "
,I-hate-lol-cats,2009-10-15T06:11Z,I've been itching for this movie for a long time...someone get an english version soon!
