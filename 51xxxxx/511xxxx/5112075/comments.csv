[T],LucasJackson37,2009-10-09T17:40Z,"People fret too much over what they perceive as ""quality"". 192 Kbps is BY FAR a perfectly acceptable MP3 compression.

I could rip something to a 96 Kbps MP3, then re-encode it to FLAC, and if no one told you, you would never even suspect.

There is a FLAC version by the way if you really really must have it...
