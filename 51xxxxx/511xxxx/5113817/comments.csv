Please use your thesaurus.  If you could somehow couch your racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, capitalist, colonialist, fascist, and despotic rants in a different, creative, sublime, sarcastic, reverential -- woops.  Sorry, when I start using my thesaurus I can get carried away.  Although not like Sistromo gets carried away - i.e. in a straight jacket, by two burly men into a waiting ambulance kind of way.

Balls in your mouth (freudian slip), I meant court."
