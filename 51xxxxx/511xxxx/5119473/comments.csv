,olseries,2009-10-11T17:34Z,"horzadome, this is the E04, like you can see at the wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_House_episodes#Season_6:_2009.E2.80.932010

the first episode was double size, E01 and E02.
E05, isnt yet online"
,Abomity,2009-10-11T23:16Z,"The first 2 episodes was aired as a ""two hour premiere"" in American but as two ""separate"" episodes in other countries like the United Kingdom.

This is ""The Tyrant"" weather it is nr 3 or 4.

I think this episode should be seen as nr 3 since Imdb says so, and because it's an american show and and the 2 first EP's was shown as one 2-hour special in the US.

We will just have to see what number the ""known"" uploaders here and on mininova will name the NEXT episode (instant Karma).

But REALITY is that this episode IS nr 3. Realize it and get over yourselves!"
