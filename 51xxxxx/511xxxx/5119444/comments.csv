,Hegelian.Dialectic,2009-10-28T05:53Z,"This video brought back fond memories of days when I felt involved in real peace, freedom and happiness.

Full DVD would be great to have.

I still wonder what will happen for 2012 election."
,Hegelian.Dialectic,2009-10-28T07:00Z,P.S. - The only thing I really think was left out of this video.... Aimee Allen  
,Hegelian.Dialectic,2009-10-28T07:22Z,"Oh, also missing was the clear evidence of Afghanistan style ballot/election fraud in N.H. primaries (the Live Free Or Die state). But, obviously, the makers of this video wanted to focus more on the movement and message than the treachery/treason.  hehe"
,brainphreak,2009-10-29T10:23Z,"I agree, the biggest disappointment was that they didnt cover the obvious fraud in the polls, debates, voting etc.

I just got the ""Rally for the Republic"" DVD set which includes Aimee, Ill upload that sometimes soon, but its a 3 DVD set, so Ill do the For Liberty DVD and a couple others first. Glad to hear you were part of the action/fight/campaign"
