This powerful Polish prog rock band has been going strong since the mid-1980s, surviving numerous personnel changes and various setbacks, but maintaining a strong, loyal international fan base. The group consistently delivers solid, semi-classical neo-prog, characterized by impressive virtuosity, allowing every instrument plenty of room to make itself heard. LIVING IN THE MOONLIGHT is named after the group's biggest hit, and records a performance at the Trans Club in Szczecin, Poland, where Collage played 12 of their best-loved songs for an appreciative audience.
