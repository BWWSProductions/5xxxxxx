It's Young Guns meets Set It Off in this hip-hop take on the time-tested revenge Western. In the placid frontier town of Flatridge, sisters Sally (Licia Shearer) and Rachel (Monica Calhoun) live in relative peace -- until a roving gang of gold-diggers tear up the burgh, looking for buried riches. In their wake, one of them kills Sally, much to the consternation of Rachel, who happens to have once been a member of an infamous, all-femme gang known as The Roses. With her sister six feet under the ground and the town going to hell under the rule of the marauding outlaws, Rachel leaves Flatridge to round up her former compadres, Kim (Stacey Dash), Ming Li (Marie Matiko), Chastity (Lil' Kim), and Marie (LisaRaye). The fivesome return to the lawless town to oust the bad guys once and for all. Gang of Roses premiered in limited theatrical release at the Magic Johnson Theater in Los Angeles before making its way to home video.
