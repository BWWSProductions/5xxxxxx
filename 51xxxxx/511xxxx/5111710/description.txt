 Finally the Â³ber talented twins Johanna and Miriam Eriksson Berhan from Stockholm,
 Sweden are ready to release their debut full-length album Still Standing at Your Back Door.
 As Taxi Taxi!, they have already spellbound thousands of listeners since their very first
 upload to Myspace in 2005 (aged 15!) and later on with their two EPs Taxi Taxi! (2007)
 and Step Out Into The Light (2009) and their many concerts across Europe and at
 festivals like Roskilde and Hultsfred. 

 They write brilliant songs and sing them out so mesmerizingly sweet, that it is hard
 to believe these two remarkable girls were born not before 1990. Their new album is
 full of heartwarming and honest songs - some gentle and magical - some uplifting and
 spine-tingling beautiful. When Johanna and Miriam sing together there is a charming
 almost breathtaking sensibility present. Same time when listening you get the clear
 vision of two very brave adolescents singing their hearts out.

 Still Standing at Your Back Door is an astonishing achivement. Taxi Taxi! have managed
 to make a youthful album but with incredible mature taste.
 Taxi Taxi! have been in good hands while making the album. Still Standing at
 Your Back Door is produced by Johan Berthling (member of Tape and co-owner of the
 magnificent HÃµpna label) and mixed by Joachim Ekerman (Jenny Wilson, Frida HyvÃ·nen,
 First Floor Power). Taxi Taxi! sing and play almost every instrument on the album
 themselves, but the album also features strings, brass and percussion played by a
 select handful of fine guest musicians from the Stockholm scene.
