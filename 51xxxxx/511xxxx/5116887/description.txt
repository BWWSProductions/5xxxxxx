A Czech family's lives are turned upside down when they pull up stakes and head for the big city in this comedy without dialogue from writer and director Tomas Vorel. A father (Bolek Polivka) moves his family from the country into the city, where he lands a job at a slaughterhouse. His wife (Eva Holubova) gets work at a grocery store, though she would prefer to spend more time with her husband, who seems to have developed a keen interest in a buxom blonde (Barbora Munzarova) who works at the abattoir. As the parents deal with their problems, their teenage son (Tomas Vorel Jr.), a skateboarding anarchist who shuns meat, devotes his spare time to vandalizing the butchering plant, while his sister (Anicka Marhoulova) struggles to keep up with her schoolwork. As everyone tries to adapt to their new surroundings, a pixie with a vicious sense of humor makes their lives all the more unpredictable.
