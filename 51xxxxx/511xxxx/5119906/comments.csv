I don't need the subs."

,gypseastorm,2010-01-06T04:54Z,"snow7269 do you run peerguardian?  if not google it and download it, combined with reading comments ppl leave b4 downloading if ur not sure of its credability.  Peerguardian is kind a like your invisible blanket in cyber space lol.........works for me (touch wood) I have never ever copped one of those infringement letters or had my internet shut off."
,Fireholder,2010-05-08T04:01Z,"First, don't EVER claim zero responsibility for your own upload. It is YOUR job to make sure what you're posting is not crap. DUH...
Second, don't use a well-established name to boost hits. That's just sad. 
Third, why are you wasting time and web space re-releasing something that's already posted?"
,kitty9,2010-06-24T11:35Z,I often download aXXo's torrents but I been told many times that's she/he is upload torrents any more what a pity. Anyone know what happens to aXXo?
,kitty9,2010-06-24T11:36Z,CORRECTION: I mean I've been told aXXo don't upload torrent any more
,jordanleehislop,2011-05-01T08:58Z,thanks broo :) great upload
