,SigSam556,2009-10-10T08:57Z,Hey guys... I just got this DVD in the mail and found it to be very informative.  Lots of practical knowledge and a strong focus on developing good habits and instinctual techniques that will come in handy when the shit hits the fan.  I've been practicing the drills at my range for about 2 weeks now and have seen a noticeable improvement in both speed and accuracy.  I hope you all like it.  I'll be posting additional titles as I receive them.  **SigSam556**
