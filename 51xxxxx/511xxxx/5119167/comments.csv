,Phavonic,2009-10-15T11:48Z,"Thanks for this GW, I haven't tested if  I can play it yet, but your efforts are appreciated. 

Yes, there are loads of ungrateful bastards about."
[T],GWpirateGW,2009-10-15T12:07Z,"The online features are untested, but I have played it to some extent, very good detail on graphics. Let me know of any issues.  And I tested it via Magic ISO's disc emulator.

Your welcome"
,Septum_Drake,2009-10-16T07:24Z,"Any info on Online Play would be greatly appreciated. I have already bought it for my PS3, then I met a few people who have it on the comp, and would like to play with them. Thanks in advance. Will download and Seed either way for a bit."
[T],GWpirateGW,2009-10-17T02:11Z," Septum_Drake. Ill be 100% honest. I have not tried the online part & do not intend to, least not on this pc. You will have to wait for somebody else, or try it yourself & see. Wish I could be more helpful."
,koldie,2009-10-17T06:53Z,"Thanx for this torrent. Game work well, but i dont understand chinese and all settings is that langauge. Very great game anyhow"
[T],GWpirateGW,2009-10-17T09:18Z,"koldie, the game is in Chinese for you?  I spent 2 hours switching it from that to English. If you use PowerISO or MagicISO, simple extract the ISO to a folder on your desktop
Look for the setup.ini file
edit the 411 to 409. The rebuild the ISO image & install. That is what I did, as it was originally in a language I could not read & saw many people asking for the English version for lack of being able to convert it.

Please report if this is in Chinese or English. I hope like hell I did not up the wrong version.  (0)-(0) "

 The game is really good, I've been playing resident evil since it was on sega saturn, and  although there are not many puzzles to be solved in the version, the game is still great.  The game even has an option to run the DirectX 9 version or DirectX 10 version.  It was obviously created for PC instead of just being a direct crummy port from console like RE4.  Controls are great, mouse aimig is pretty good too.  Thanks Alot!"

,WillAlvers,2010-08-14T11:42Z,"i get a Error 3: Failed to initialize DirectX10, running windows 7 updated DirectX drivers, this is wierd"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-08-22T08:23Z,"@WillAlvers   havent had that issue personally, found this via a google search


found a solution that worked for, I was experience the direct X 10 failed to initialize error whenever I was attempting to load Resident Evil 5 on windows 7 64-bit OS, I am using legit purchased software on my computer no pirate versions. I could launch the direct X 9 version and it worked fine, but as soon as I tried selecting the directX 10 the game would try to launch and I would get the error message. Now as for what I did to correct it, I might at that I already new that my graphics cards were Direct X 10 capable as I am running TRI-SLI GTX 275's and anything from the 8800 series Geforce processors and the latter are capable of running direct X 10 on Vista or Win 7. I went into the folders on my C:\ drive and deleted the Folder named NVIDIA and emptied the recycle bin. Then I went into the control panel and selected the option for uninstalling programs. I then selected to uninstall the Nvidia Display Drivers entirely including the stereoscopic 3D nvidia drivers that were listed seperately on the uninstall programs list. I restarted my PC as prompted to do, ""in order to complete the uninstall"". After the computer rebooted and loaded up Win 7, ""I uninstalled a driver patch that you guys may or may not have on your systems, that is made by EVGA for running more than one video card linked together in SLI mode, it was called SLI enhancement 26, I just wanted to be thorough and uninstall anything to do with my video drivers which for most of you would be either your ATI or NVIDIA graphics drivers. I then went and redownloaded the latest nvidia graphics card drivers recommended by the manufacturer, installed them, and rebooted. I then tried to launch resident evil 5 direct 10 version from the all programs menu and it worked just fine, I wanted to add that I did try reinstalling my drivers before this but failed to uninstall my current drivers first and that did not fix the problems. If you are running a game that uses Game for windows Live, I would also recommend uninstalling Games for Windows Live and downloading the latest version from Microsoft and attempt reinstalling it after rebooting if what I tried didn't work. There is a program called driver sweeper that really helps uninstall graphics and sound card drivers completely and I believe it is a free software download, it unistalls drivers much more thoroughly than windows does and it even removes entries made in the registry which can be causing problems when they aren't removed by windows uninstall programs. I highly recommend it if you are experience technical difficulties after installing software/drivers associated with a new sound card or graphics card especially creative lab sound blaster cards which leaves behind multiple registry entries after windows uninstalls. Hope this works for you all, just remember to uninstall before you reinstall. I reinstalled the game too but that didn't fix the problem it was the graphics driver or games for windows that was the source of the issue."

The game itself runs very smoothly as long as you have the hardware to support it as with all games. To save you just have to choose to create an offline account with GFWL and it won't ask for a serial number. Make sure you copy the Launcher in the crack folder to the install directory.

,Juushi,2012-01-03T20:07Z,"IF YOUR GAME IS IN JAPANESE LANGUAGE
>Run Resident Evil 5 launcher. From the top left drop down menu, choose English as game language and run the game."
,koch85,2012-01-06T00:09Z,"I have a huge problem, downloaded, installed, pasted the crack. Game started with no problems at all. BUT. One thing. The sund! I usually use earphones, plugged to pc (HP G6), in the game the sound is coming from pc speakers and NOT through the earphone, even though the earhphones are plugged to pc. ANYONE knows how can I fix it? It so wierd. I cant play with the sound on, shouting from crapy laptop speakers."

,cvolcano,2012-02-18T05:57Z,"Release sucks, patch in the damn save game crack next time. Who wants complete unlocks the first time they play? There's not one release of this I can find that isn't unplayable or unsaveable. TPB has generated a rush-to-release community that fucks everything up."
,FunnyGuy777,2012-02-27T02:02Z,How do you save?
,shazzanova,2012-03-01T10:10Z,simply doesnt work lots of errors and freezes and up direct prompt save your time and get it off steam for $20.00 
,FiricaRemus,2012-03-02T09:13Z,Works. :*
,tiz2,2012-03-15T12:18Z,"@ cvolcano : Don't blame others for your stupidity. All you need is an offline GFWL account and you can save just fine. Its very easy to make, and once you have made one you can use it for all your other GFWL games. 

This is an awesome game, only drawback is you need to play it in 2-player co-op to get the full experience. Luckily they don't try to stop you in doing that, it's an old-school LAN system, just connect and play.  "

3rd) Open setup file with notepad++
4th) Go to line 158 and set 9.
5th) Go to line 159 and set 409
6th) Save And Close

Regards."
,felipemgs,2012-06-15T07:34Z,"FOR ALL WITH PROBLEMS:

-Language Problem:
1.Do not mount the iso, just extract it with Winrar
2.Download notepad++ (google it)
3.Open the setup.ini file with notepad++
(You can't fix with windows notepad)
4.Line 158 should be 9, if it isn't set it to 9
5.Go to line 159 and set 409
6.Save and close the setup.ini
7.Open the setup.exe file, if it is in English just proceed the instalation and be happy. If has some strange characters you did something wrong.

-Save problem:
You just have to create an offline account in games for windows
1.games for windows will be showed after you select start, and confirm a profile warning, just select create account and select offline account while creating
(If games for windows doesn't appear just press home)

-Playing after installation:
Replace the launcher.exe (found in Program files/Capcom/resident evil 5/) file to the one in the crack folder, and then run it.

THIS TUTORIAL ISN'T MINE, I JUST COPIED THE SOLUTIONS FROM OLDER COMMENTS. THANKS."
,felipemgs,2012-06-15T07:39Z,"-playing coop:
1.You'll need Tunngle (google it)
