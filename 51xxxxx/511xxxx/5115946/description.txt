-=====  Game Info =====-



Welcome to Skira, a 220kmÂ² open world battlefield and the newest frontline in the war of energy. Join the US Marine Corps as they take on the might of the chinese PLA and fight to stop a flashpoint engagement over oil erupting into full blown war. Play solo, PvP or with up to 3 friends CO-Operatively as you choose your path through this visceral & brutal conflict, using the full force of authentically detailed US Marine Corps weapons, vehicles, aircraft, munitions and tactics.

The game takes place on a small, fictional island based on the island of Kiska
located off the north coast of Japan called Skira and is set in the near future.
The island is a contested territory between Russia and China and becomes the
centre of an armed conflict when a large untapped oil and gas reserve is
discovered there. The Russians who own the island ask America (their allies)
to intervene as they are busy dealing with a large Chinese force on their own
Russian border. The game begins as the player arrives as part of the United
States Marine Corps which is tasked with capturing the island, on behalf of the
Russians, from the Chinese military.


Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising (often referred to as Operation Flashpoint 2) is a first person tactical military game for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed by British game developer Codemasters. Codemasters have advertised the game as a tactical shooter designed to realistically represent modern infantry combat. It's a follow-up to Bohemia Interactive's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, but was developed entirely by Codemasters due to a falling out between the two companies.
