We explore the wonderful world of Oz with Dorothy, Toto, and her ragtag group of friends.

The beloved tale of a young girl with ruby red shoes and her loyal canine companion makes its way to the Nintendo DS. The magic and wonder of Oz are included, and the story--with some creative modifications--unfolds like a colorful children's storybook. We had the opportunity to play The Wizard of Oz: Beyond the Yellow Brick Road at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show when it was called Riz-Zoawd, and we were captivated by the beautiful visuals on the handheld, even though we didn't understand a word of what was going on in the game. Now, Xseed Games is bringing the charming role-playing game to a wider audience in North America, and we got a chance to run loose around the wonderful world of Oz and take in the lush scenery.
