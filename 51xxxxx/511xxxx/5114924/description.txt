Joe Hachem former World Series of Poker Champion, and Australias pre-eminent poker player will play host, mentor and judge in series one of The Poker Star.

Eleven Australian poker players have been selected to live together and compete in a number of challenges that parallel many of those faced by us all in life and test Joes Code. Joes Code is Joe Hachems personal code which sets out the principles which he believes are essential for success in life and are the difference between a good poker player and The Poker Star.

The final winner of The Poker Star will take home AU$100,000 and live the dream of a professional poker player, playing in four of the worlds biggest poker tournaments, with Joe Hachem as mentor and sounding board.
