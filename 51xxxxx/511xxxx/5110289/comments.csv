,jersson,2009-10-04T22:12Z,Is it possible to make a portable vers of the new Diskeeper 2009? I have the 2008 vers but its a lot of improvements on the 2009 vers ???

I've fighted a little with Diskeeper 2k9, but it seems that it's not possible to make it portable, at least not without some struggling I suppose. Even using Thinstall/Thinapp the resulting prog tries to install something else when runned, so it doesn't look so good to me."
,jersson,2009-10-06T21:27Z,Ok man thank's for the answer and I wonder how this guy made the 2008 vers precracked and it still works: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4304233/disckeeper_2008_full_cracked

He picked up the files of a cracked install and packed it to copy the needed files in their place, adding also the relative Registry values. If you look, the file is a RAR SFX, and you can open it with WinRAR and see what it does. This can probably be done also with the 2009 version, even if programmers add always something new to their versions to avoid crackers having an easy life... ;-)"
,Knight_Auron,2009-10-07T12:20Z,Do you have an anti virus spyware program that detects and removes Bohmini.A?
[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-07T15:42Z,"@Knight_Auron
I've never seen before this virus, but googling around it shows between other this page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohmini.A where it gives some infos removing it. If it doesn't work maybe running a system scan starting from a bootable CD with some AVs on it like BartPE or some directly built up from AV makers will help to get rid of it.
My personal way to handle it is to make a Ghost copy of my system when I've configured and installed everything I need, and save it somewhere (CD, DVD and Backup HD, and if something nasty happens to my PC go back to this previous backup. And if I update or add something new make a new backup to keep with the other for the bad times. It's a lot easier to restore a previous backup than go fighting around to get rid of nasties. But for doing it you should start from a fresh and clean installation..."
,dhalgren57,2009-10-20T03:17Z,Not good. Registers OK but seconds after running it tells you it's a pirated copy and then shuts down. LOL

Here it works fine even if you let it connect to internet. Maybe you have some leftovers of a previous version on your system..."
,ZDaddy,2010-06-12T05:23Z,Thanks for the UP! Works like a charm on my Windows XP box.
,gofreemovies,2010-08-01T13:23Z,Everyone watch out for the keygen.exe file. It is a Trojan VIRUS! Luckily my spyware software caught it before any damage occured. The other files are harmless though. Just uncheck the keygen.exe file and the rest is OK.
