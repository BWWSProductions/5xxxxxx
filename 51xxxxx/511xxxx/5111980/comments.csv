,pegapalo,2009-10-11T23:07Z,thanks a lot jasper worked like a charm on win 7 ultimate!!

,irkeith,2009-10-15T14:03Z,this was the only loader i tried at first..tried it in oem and non oem with same results..when i look in control panel and when i use the check activation option in this loader i get the same message of expires on date 30 days to activate..
,almondjoy1968,2009-10-25T07:12Z,Worked perfectly! Thank you !!!
,karated,2009-10-28T20:23Z,"This is an excellent activtor.

I have an HP dual core desktop, an Acer dual core quad desktop and a Toshiba dual core duo laptop.

I installed Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit RTM untouched. Just to make them lighter. I did want extra features availble in Ultimate Version.

Then I applied this activator. All were activated in a couple of minutes without slightest problem.

After some 35 days, I have Windows genuine advantage logo. Winver shows OS is licenced.

I could update windows without any problem.

Excellent, highly recommended.

,ShadowMastr,2009-10-29T07:42Z,Thanks for the great torrent. It worked fine for my RTM 64 bit Win7 Ultimate on my HP notebook.
,xspxbudweiser,2009-11-01T01:29Z,"sorry ima nooby, but do we install 7 and then have this exe on a seperate disc and load it after its done installing the OS/?"
,youngpup,2009-11-02T08:13Z,WORKED GREAT!!!!!!! Thanks Jasper100
,youngpup,2009-11-02T09:02Z,Is there any other way to double check to see if its activated..besides the control panel
,Jasper100,2009-11-12T20:31Z,"a second option to check whether your pc is really acitvated? here it is: click start and type in the search field: ""slui"" (without those quotes) push enter and it should say that windows is activated if not it's not ;D

sheers!

share-
it's faire"
,itpeligo,2009-12-23T13:16Z,How do I setup on a Mac using parallels
,Katsurui,2009-12-27T01:36Z,Works! Thanks!:D
[T],Ametz,2010-01-22T04:34Z,"Can i use this with Windows 7 Evolution Copy 7100 to make it update to the real Windows 7 or something like that, or will i be forced to reinstall from the current windows Evolution copy to the real one?"
,rapsn1,2010-01-26T18:37Z,"Well, The old 7loader just stopped working and i have to make it gunuine again ;) hope this works i dont want to use all night to look for a working crack :o

fu microsoft for searching for a crack"
,D14BL0,2010-03-01T02:40Z,"This seems to have worked on the evaluation copy. I'm running the beta Build 7100 and ran 7Loader, restarted, and I'm no longer getting the nag screen.

Will confirm after March 1, though."
,D14BL0,2010-03-01T03:33Z,"Forget what I said, it just now came up with the nag screen after a while. /sigh"
,bahamor,2010-03-02T06:04Z,"Working well, I'm not sure I want to install update but while using ""slui"" confirms that activation was successful.

@DI4BL0
I had RC 7 too but you have to reinstall it anyway. But rejoice, its installing really really fast, just hope you had few partitions :P"
,supanut2000,2010-07-17T03:26Z,"Thanks for this, works in VMware. Not sure if it will work on the real pc."
,azervayne,2010-10-04T11:38Z,"This update will work for a while, but after update KB2158563, as MPAA pointed out, Windows caught on and broke this method. Here's how to get your copy genuine again:

Download this torrent and reinstall WAT (The exe within has that option, thankfully. Credit to author for allowing us the option to restore WAT. Restoring WAT *IS* necessary because the alternate way to activate windows tricks WAT rather than removing it.) or rerun it if you didn't delete the files from this torrent

Restore WAT (as i said above, just remind ya...)

Program will reboot your computer

Download this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5541849/Windows_7_Loader_v1.7.9_%5B_Windows_7_Activation_For_all_versions_ *

*If for some reason the above link broke, Google for the following to find it: ""Windows 7 Loader v1.7.9 thepiratebay""'

Run the exe within that torrent

The program will minimize to background immediately then a few seconds later ask you to restart your computer (this is normal, btw)

Upon boot windows will stay say it is not genuine with the pop up prompt, but you will notice that the ""This copy of Windows is not genuine"" in the corner is gone - this is your (and was my) first hint that this worked for you

Go to the Windows 7 start menu search bar and type in activate windows and you should see the program for Windows activation come up (it's named ""Activate Windows"" hehe) then click it.

It should say ""Activation was succesful""

Reboot your computer

Enjoy your ""discount"" copy of 7"
,azervayne,2010-10-04T11:39Z,Shit...disregard the above comment. I thought this was RemoveWAT not 7Loader. This comment was meant for the guys using the RemoveWAT broken method. 
,Kassner,2010-10-08T12:52Z,Just tried this using Windows 7 Ultimate OEM 64bit on an HP dv2000 laptop and it's worked fine so far. Will update if anything goes wrong but so far this is looking like a rock solid crack. Thanks so much! Really didn't feel like spending another $200 just to install Windows 7 on my laptop.
,Fireater989,2011-01-03T22:35Z,"What does ""Windows is in notification mode"" mean? I installed the SLIC thing, the loader, and repaired activation successfully, but Windows still says it's not genuine"
,FULLMOON_1,2011-05-13T15:00Z,"If this doesn't work for you just search for:
Chew-WGA 0.9 The Windows 7 Patch 

or just go there

Awesome combination, untouched OS, one-click loader :)"
,mhine21,2012-02-12T08:28Z,Can I make a script for this one? So it automatically install the loader when the windows installation completes
