,sweMezza,2009-10-11T21:41Z,"Thanks! I can't installa robodefense pro, any ideas? I've managed to install anything else I've tried. Robo was what I was after! I'm in sweden and we can't buy from market yet..."
,G1_Guru,2009-10-12T22:54Z,"@sweMezza

hmmm it worked for me. if all else fails use the market enabler and fake another network (Ive never had a problem with the German one) and then if you dont mind paying you can search for it and find it."
,Tree...,2009-10-18T08:08Z,"awesome man thanks a lot! I am running a ported version of android on my HTC Touch and the Market is not working very well so this is a big help, thanks! I hope we see more uploads"

,yurnotsoeviltwin,2009-11-01T00:05Z,Will I need root to install any of these?
,G1_Guru,2009-11-26T06:39Z,You do need root for some apps like cpu overlock but everything else should be fine.
