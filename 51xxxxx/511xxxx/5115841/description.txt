TBS Superstation has actually been doing western film fans a nice service over the past decade by producing a series of above-average made-for-TV westerns featuring the likes of Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott, Martin Sheen, Ed Harris, and so on. A number of them have already made their way to both laserdisc and DVD. One of the latest in this cycle is a remake of High Noon, the 1952 classic that starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. It's also the latest in a series of misguided efforts at slavishly remaking films that were already generally regarded as being about as good as they could be. We know all about the waste of celluloid that was the recent remake of Hitchcock's Psycho and now we hear talk about redoing Mr. Deeds Goes to Town with Adam Sandler. (Whether anything actually comes of that or not, even the suggestion is ludicrous.) [Editor's Note: They're currently filming a remake of Charade starring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton.] What's nextâ€”Citizen Kane with a script updated for the sensibilities of modern audiences by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon? But I digress. Western fans are starved for new product, so it behooves us to at least look at the new High Noon regardless of whatever misgivings we may have.
