,raethelord,2009-11-30T16:57Z,"Just finished copying a protected Data CD that I own (!). Purchased the A+ Book on Amazon, and it included a protected PDF copy of the book that I needed to backup to go to work safely with.

The software worked flawlessly, in one scoop!

Thank you NoExcuses for such a nice torrent. The crack instruction is easily one of the easiest I have seen so far! 

Cheers!"
