,SriLankanMonkey,2009-10-17T01:09Z,Is this being tracked by HBO? I've already had a DMCA scare. 
,addy888,2009-10-24T07:34Z,thank u so much 
,Duramba,2009-11-21T06:32Z,"This and the other Entourage Seasons ARE being monitored by HBO. HBO is one, if not the most aggressive networks tracking torrents. I received a call from Comcast regarding this torrent. Be sure to use precautions, I didn't have PG2 running at the tiem, but not sure if it would have made a difference."

,murtadi007,2010-03-15T22:50Z,"its very hard to spot 
but all the episodes are missing really small details 
the guy was edited out some of the scenes in every episode to fit into a ~230MB/Episode file. 
but great upload. 
A = 10
V = 8
Q = 9"
,rpgmaker,2010-05-27T20:30Z,"@murtadi: You can't just drop that bomb you have to back it up a little to make that kind of remark. Anyways, I believe I've been downloading this guy's entourage torrents for quite a while and the quality is great. Great tv show."
,rjfm9,2010-06-17T20:00Z,"Hey hexagon, thanks a million buddy. Your a champion. "
,royalmcdude,2010-06-25T11:34Z,"haha, actually, nowadays it's LEGAL for these companies to track your isp and get your personal info from your internet operator.. in SWEDEN at least.. stupid right-winged parties!"
,tybomb,2010-07-04T20:23Z,"LOL idiots in this thread trying to cause trouble.
murtadi007 you really think anyone's going to believe the uploader spent countless hours re editing every episode of every season just to end up with a completely normal file size? What ""hard to spot"" details did he remove?  Did he erase Arie's Rolex from scene 3 of episode 7 to reduce the file size? lol.
Maybe he spliced out every 17th word in episode 8?
hexagonn must have a lot of free time on his hands. And to purposely devalue his own rips like that after all the work he's put in?
 You're an idiot! Don't quit your day job (working for HBO).  
If they were tracking the torrent (like the first idiot claims) then why would they bother sending a butt plug like you to post something this retarded?"
,willsypro,2010-11-22T08:16Z,"Theres a hilarious scene missing in the last episode with Matt Damon, its in the credits but they've been cut."
,crazysoccerman14,2011-04-02T10:27Z,"They ARE monitoring these.

I was busted last year for downloading Entourage.

Luckily I was in a dorm that already had a policy in place to protect its students in copyright infringement cases.

Have fun with the law suits guys!

I know you can't afford them!

If anything, search for the files on servers -- you won't be caught that way."
,crazysoccerman14,2011-04-02T10:28Z,"* law suit --> lawsuit 

durp"
,cyberzed,2011-06-20T03:04Z,"Thanks, much appreciated."
,hasman,2011-07-14T13:56Z,Best Series.... Thnx hexagonn...Keep up the good work :)
