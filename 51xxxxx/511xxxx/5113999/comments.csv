BIG FAN! Newly a member of Pirate Bay (I was a mininova user)

My computer doesn't have a cd/dvd rom drive but I love playing my ps2 backup games on it.  I use pcsx2 (0.9.6)

I'm having trouble recompiling this image into a single disc image.  I have tried power iso and DAEMON tools and all of their options (iso, mds/mdf, ect...) and none of the resulting images seem to 'play'.

I have two thoughts...  
1 - DVD decrypter is special and knows how to recompile ps2 games better than other programs.  
2 - pcsx2 is still a beta and Xenosaga ep 2 isn't playable yet on pcsx2 from an image.

Any thoughts on the subject?

PS - THANKS for all the great uploads!!  I will continue to seed this even though it doesn't work for me yet!"

Mount the game (supplied in this torrent) using DAEMON tools.n2. Use DVD Decrypter to create an ISO image of the current image mounted to the DAEMON ?Drive?n3. Game is currently playable with the emulator PCSX2 0.9.7 on a FAST dual processer computer. nnTHANKS again for the upload, still seeding!"
