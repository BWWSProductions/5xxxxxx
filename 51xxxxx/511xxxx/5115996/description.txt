Plot Synopsis  	by Mark Deming

After his albums Honky Chateau and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player elevated him to rock stardom, Elton John decided to raise the bar on his own music, and rose to the occasion with 1973's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, a sprawling two-record set that was a critical success and commercial sensation. This documentary, produced as part of the "Classic Albums" series, takes an in-depth look at the making of this landmark record, as Elton John and lyricist Bernie Taupin discuss the album's stylistically diverse songwriting and production techniques, while a number of the musicians who worked with John on the album also share their memories. In addition, Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road includes rare film footage and photographs shot during the recording sessions, numbers from Elton's live shows of the 1970s, and demo versions of several of the album's classic songs.AMG
