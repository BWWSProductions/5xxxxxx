After outwitting his Jedi foes and escaping with the Holocron, bounty hunter Cad 
Bane sets into motion the next stage of his nefarious assignment: to find Force-
sensitive younglings and take them to Mustafar for Sith training.But Bane is merely 
the instrument of evil, a deadly distraction to occupy the Jedi while the true 
source continues to plot from the shadows. While he has been glimpsed in previous 
episodes -- and in his seemingly benevolent double-role as Supreme Chancellor of the 
Republic -- Darth Sidious emerges in 'Children of the Force' as a direct threat to 
the galaxy's future.
