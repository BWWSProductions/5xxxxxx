This is a ~60 minute mix I made for fun, with some of my favorite hardstyle and techno tunes, edited and cut in FL Studio.
Never done a mix before so I dont know any of the rules that exists, if there's any, I just put togheter good songs and made them melt into eachother.

Tought I could put it up for those who have the same taste of music as I do.

Rave on :)



In the torrent I included a txt file with the songs used, and the mix itself.
This is also my first torrent ever, haha.
