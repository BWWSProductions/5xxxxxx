,ronaldson,2010-01-03T05:32Z,This slows right down in the end...I really hope I can actually finish the download lol....already drove my bandwidth up too high.
,ronaldson,2010-01-03T19:19Z,I have finished installing the game and when I try and run it it will attempt to go into the tages setup..but then says insufficient privileges. I have run this as an administrator and have gotten no where..I took alot of time to download this thing and would really like to play it. Is there anything I can do?
,omg_look_its_nickels,2010-01-04T21:18Z,"Don't worry about tages... Mine crashed the setup program, and didn't even make it to that part of the install... just copy over the crack on disc 2, and place it in the System folder of the game directory, make a shortcut to the game (not launcher) and you're all set!"
,Neocrofear,2010-01-06T21:25Z,I installed the whole thing but when i try to run it says i have to place the Cd in my comp. So what now
,Neocrofear,2010-01-06T23:16Z,Nvm fixed it after some time :D sorry for double posting. 
,educuba,2010-03-05T22:41Z,"is the game already uncensored when you install it or do you have to do anything with the ""uncensored part folder"" to make it uncensored? "
,veefeld,2010-03-07T21:51Z,where's the crack?
,beersludge,2010-03-07T23:29Z,Thanks for the download.Everything installed and ran smoothly on the first try. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
,Vac8,2010-03-28T20:15Z,"tnx a LOTTT!!!really helped me ,, now , waiting for Witcher 2,,,,which is coming around Q1 2011....LOL

,Nascour,2010-04-17T10:45Z,I ran the setup and it asked about the tagessetup. I then copied the cracked content to my system folder and made a shortcut like omg_look_this_nickels said but now it says it's missing binkw32.dll though it's clearly in the folder what should I do to fix this??
[T],dramacore,2010-07-02T00:55Z,thanks for the share!

,JagGillarSmisk,2010-10-07T16:26Z,Can anyone explain to me where the crack is?
,foniks12,2010-10-31T14:03Z,"1. Mount the first ISO image (Disk 1) on Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools
2. Start the installation
3. At the request of the second disk, unmount the first ISO image (Disk 1) and mount the second ISO image (Disk 2)
4. Continue and finish the installation
5. Copy the crack into (C:)\The Witcher Enhanced Edition\System""
6. Play

,thovader,2010-11-25T17:40Z,"Thank you very much for the upload, works like a charm :)!
After I downloaded the game, I just followed the instructions given, i.e. mounted the first DVD, installed and mounted the second DVD when the installer asked for it.
Afterwards I copied the crack over and that's it."

,Expunge,2010-12-09T16:06Z,"Hope this downloads faster than Skidrow's Version, same fucking problem, not enough seeders. Hope this works too."
,Expunge,2010-12-09T16:13Z,"But I ain't complaning, since these guys do all the work here for us to play the game after all"
,danii555,2011-01-04T04:54Z,Does this contain virus? According to @skwaak it does...
,nemus84,2011-01-07T11:15Z,The setup only accepts the second disk if it is mounted to the same drive (letter).
,aristotelemaitre,2011-01-22T14:58Z,"I have a problem with putting the crack in the system folder. When I want to copy it, it says that there is insufficiant space on disk 2 to copy it. Is there a way to fix this problem? "
,Chyrz,2011-03-14T09:15Z,"I have a problem while installing, I mounted the first dvd, then I press setup and tell the installer to install it to my C drive, I select the options i want (I unchecked every languague except for english) then I press continue and the setup doesn't do anything, the green installation bar is at the beginning of the bar and stays there for hours."
