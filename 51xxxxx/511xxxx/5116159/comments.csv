Appreciation is always welcome and don't forget to rate the torrent."
,Almarenan,2009-10-09T12:07Z,"Do the following (courtesy polisdavid) :
1. Block obdev.at in /etc/hosts by adding a line: 127.0.0.1 obdev.at
2. Block Little Snitch with Little Snitch, in Little Snitch Configuration click the Choose Application: /Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UIAgent (ANY connection)
3. Enter the following serial number: SN: 32SPYLJZN0-733P4-6WPM957P4S (Serial Seeker)

PS : you can try skipping part one, still, I did it and, well, it works .."
,miknos,2009-10-09T12:25Z,I haven't blocked Little Snitch (with Little Snitch) in this version but might be a good idea to do so.
,vomit60foam,2009-10-10T14:55Z,10.6.1 compatible?
,vomit60foam,2009-10-10T20:37Z,"In case your not a UNIX maven:
Step 1 step by step: 
-Open Terminal
-Paste or type:
sudo pico /etc/hosts
-Enter your Mac user password
-Enter 127.0.0.1 obdev.at
-Press Control and x to EXIT
-Type y for YES
-Hit return
-Type exit to logout
I think that's it . . ."
,miknos,2009-10-11T01:12Z,"Yes, it works in 10.6.1"
,Danny880044,2009-10-12T12:30Z,"Works great thanks, block Little Snitch using Little Snitch, so it doesn't phone home and tell you that your license is invalid etc. Thanks for a fine upload :D"

Poor show chaps. I've been using the latest Little Snitch (2.2), blocked from calling home, and a serial I found on TPB (I suspect it wasn't the one from the torrent though) for over a week now - no probs.

Wanna share your serial with us? :)"
,tsam19,2009-10-24T14:47Z,"I'm using Leopard 10.5.8 & downloaded & installed this 'little snitch' program.
Tried to follow the instructions on how to 'block LS with LS' but the instructions don't make any sense ?
I've opened LS configuration - BUT WHERE'S THE CHOOSE APPLICATION TAB' ?

Also I've tried to locate - /Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UIAgent (ANY connection)

But where is it ??

Can someone explain it in SLOOOOW TIIIME..

Cheers."

In this 2.1.4i you don't have to block LittleSnitch UIagent.

If you want to update to 2.2 you'll have to block UIagent. To do it:

-Run LittleSnitch Configuration.
-Click NEW (rule).
-On top choose DENY CONNECTIONS.
-Where you see ""all applications"", on your right choose ""CHOOSE APPLICATION...""
-Go to HD/Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UIAgent
