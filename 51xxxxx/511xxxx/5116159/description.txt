Protect your privacy

Little Snitch 2 Protects Private Data from Undesirable Transmission. Little Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to establish an outgoing Internet connection. You can then choose to allow or deny this connection, or define a rule how to handle similar, future connection attempts.

Until someone manages to upload the newer version (2.2 at this time), you can use this one. It works perfectly and does not expire.

Installation:

- Run Installer
- Insert Serial
