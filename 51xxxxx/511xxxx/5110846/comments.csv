,jbone33,2009-10-07T01:17Z,The end after the credits is just Matt Damon going off on Vince telling him that he is crap for not giving money. It's goes on for about 2 minutes. 
,Bonomaul,2009-10-15T08:30Z,Please rip the WHOLE programs! Not only Entourage but also many other series. Retards
,Kotep,2009-11-08T22:59Z,"Appreciate all your work eztv..

Instead of dl this and come back and complain about it after - why not dl NoTV's Repack that eztv uploaded when this was nuked:
