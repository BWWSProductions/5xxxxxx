Born in Hackney, London, Paloma Faith is half Spanish and half British. As an ex magicianâ€™s assistant, trained contemporary dancer, St Martinâ€™s alumna with an MA in theatre direction, a performer in burlesque show and dance club, and an actress, Paloma has been mixing artistic media throughout her adult life. A few years ago she introduced music into the equation, at first mimicking the blues and soul singers she admired, but eventually finding her own voice.

Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful? is the debut album by English singer Paloma Faith. It is set to be released on 28 September 2009
