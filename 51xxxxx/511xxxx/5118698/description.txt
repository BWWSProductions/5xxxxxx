DEATH ONLINE

She was young, beautiful, with a promising future. But, Nadia Kajouji's suicide stunned her parents and friends. What begins as a devastating personal tragedy becomes an international hunt for an online predator when a retired English schoolteacher discovers a grim online world of suicide chatrooms and one person, in particular, who is pushing vulnerable, depressed people, all around the world, to kill themselves. It was that same person, a middle-aged father of two in Minnesota, who was Nadia Kajouji's secret online friend and pushing her to her tragic death.
