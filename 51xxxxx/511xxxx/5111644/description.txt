Space 1999 - Final Message From Moonbase Alpha

When this excellent, ground-breaking series was
prematurely cancelled after only two series, fans
thought they'd never find out the fate of Moonbase
Alpha's crew.

Now, thirty years later, here is the final chapter:

Included ONLY in the 30th Anniversary Edition Box Set
is the WORLD PREMIERE OF THE FAN-PRODUCED SERIES ENDING!

It includes clips and actors from the original series.

So now you can finally know what happened. :)
