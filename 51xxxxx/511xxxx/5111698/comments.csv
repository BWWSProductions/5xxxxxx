,jonnti,2009-12-06T01:21Z,"Thanks man!! Got all of your Illusion uploads now. =D 
AG3 is awesome, the install is easy, to play the game is easy.
I will test this updates tomorrow. 
I'll seed after mine torrent is finished (in about 13 hours) and when I wake up tomorrow. :)

Keep it up with the good job and I hope I will see some more great games from you soon! ^^"
,s0meguy,2010-07-03T22:07Z,thanks for your ups but in the Maker the new skin colors dont work (yes i installed all mods in the wizard except 3 of the pussy texture mods that i didn't want)
,mikejacobs,2010-08-15T03:44Z,"Hey, how do I make the AG3 Make Selector work? I followed the instruction that was written on the pop-up (start AG3 make and to create character mode)."
,mikejacobs,2010-09-19T09:46Z,Oh and I did install the required mods etc.
,mikejacobs,2010-09-19T10:22Z,"Got it to work kinda >>, I have a win7 OS and had to set compatibility to 98/me and everytime i start the make selector, it freezes the girl make screen, help would be appreciated"
,Cidron_2,2011-01-19T05:37Z,"Hi randompirate, don't lose faith, don't give up! I at least appreciate the work you do with these games + updates. You're doing an excellent job. I have 9 Illusion games installed in a Win 7/64bit system, all of them work 100%. And I DO read the readme's and instructions... And the Wiki links. And visit Hongfire when in doubt (and otherwise).  Any new material will be gladly received and seeded at least to 3.0 ratio. So there's at least one satisfied end user... :-)"
,Kaelik`,2011-02-02T01:03Z,"Thanks randompirate, grabbing AG3 and SBzero. been a long time since I played any ero-games =)"
,RaepSoda,2011-02-24T11:46Z,"No problems downloading, works perfectly fine. Thanks man."
,Shadawg,2011-03-03T09:20Z,I got a suspicious.cloud.2 virus warning from norton after D/Ling this and running the setup.  Is it just a false positive? Because I downloaded the AG3 from the link and set it up without problems.
,mladyspup,2011-03-28T01:08Z,can't wait to try this one once i d/l it. your stuff rocks. 
,jake.steven,2011-04-28T16:06Z,Does this include Mai Shiranui and Morrigan mods.
,jcole5,2011-09-14T04:30Z,"hey RP, I've had success installing all your other games and packs.  It's really great how easy youve made it for us, but I've been having problems with this one.  I've installed the setup, installed the mods but everytime I try and use the features with AG3 make selector I get this message.  

Start AG3_Make Program and go to Create Character mode before using this program.  

I've already done that but I am at a roadblock here.  jcole55555@gmail.com is my email if anyone else has any help.  Hongfire is down at the moment."
,jcole5,2011-09-14T05:18Z,"And just so you know I always read your Read Me files, they are extremely helpful.  But I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I'm opening Wizzard, loading AG3_Make and going through the steps of > - Create Character > - Create New > - And then opening AG3MakeSelect.  However I am still getting the same error that tells me to open AG3_Make Program before opening AG3MakeSelect.

I've also tried renaming my AG3_Make file to the ones included in your Readme.  Aside from deleting everything and restarting is there another option?"
,jcole5,2011-09-15T02:43Z,Got everything work :D
,TBAi86,2011-10-04T02:53Z,Can anyone else seed this?
,alekkross,2011-11-07T09:50Z,"thanx for the torrent, all works"
,RicePirate,2012-05-06T04:11Z,before I download... what's included exactly?
