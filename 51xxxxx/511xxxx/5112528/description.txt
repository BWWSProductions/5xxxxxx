That's right! For those of you who don't know, the Triplets are back on the air again! On last Friday's podcast, Frank announced that starting today Frosty, Heidi, and Frank would be back on the air over on 790 KABC in Los Angeles. I took the opportunity to record the show as it was airing and am now releasing it for you all to enjoy. Despite the fact that it is aired over AM, it actually sounds just as good as their podcasts do.

These files have been edited using Soundbooth to remove all the commercials, traffic updates, world news, etc. Pretty much everything that isn't them has been removed. I'll be doing this every day, as long as people seed.

Enjoy, and please...seed!

Oh, and one more thing: apparently, KABC releases all the archives of their shows via podcast the day after recording. Yesterday's show is up on their website, but surprisingly, it doesn't sound that great. I don't know why; you would think it would sound awesome considering they have the source. Anyway, doing this (recording, editing, and releasing the torrent of the show) may become unnecessary as time goes by. I'll keep it up for now, but if their releases on the site start sounding any better, then I might as well just stop.
