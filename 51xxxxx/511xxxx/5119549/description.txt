In this insane spoof, every horror movie ever made comes hilariously to life as slacker Stan and his stoner pals try to deliver videos to a deserted California town on Halloween night. After being stalked by realistic replicas of horror characters Freddy Kruger, Pinhead, and The Creeper, our gang arrives in the small burg, which formerly contained a horror movie studioâ€”hence the throngs of freaky, familiar characters literally crawling the streets.
