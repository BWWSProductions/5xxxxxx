VIDEO-full marks
and the 
AUDIO-full marks
and
PenĂŠlope Cruz - Un besito! Oh.. how I wish! She's superb.

Subtitles are useless. Skip them.

Thanks for the upload!"

http://subscene.com/Broken-Embraces-Los-Abrazos-Rotos/subtitles-78988.aspx

I used the 2 CD set from cyberdogpop. Used VLC player and scrolled through both CDs- the subs looked like they matched perfectly with no adjustment. I haven't watched the movie all the way through yet, but the A/V both looked good to me as well. If something changes when I watch it later I'll come back and amend my comment, but for now it all seems great. THANK YOU!"
