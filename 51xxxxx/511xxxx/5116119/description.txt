Plot:
At the request of his old war time colleague Ailsa Brimley, George Smiley agrees
to look into the murder of Stella Rode. Brimley had only just received a letter
from her saying she feared for her life at her husband's hand. The husband,
Stanley Rode teaches at Carne School, but Smiley is doubtful that he had
anything to do with his wife's death. As Smiley investigates, he learns that
Stella was a nosy busybody who loved to learn other's little secrets and then
gossip about them - or possibly blackmail them. When a student is killed and
Smiley unearths a secret, he has the evidence to name the killer.
