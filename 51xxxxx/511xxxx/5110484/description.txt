House M.D. S06E01/S06E02 - Broken (2009)

House begins a detox program at Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital to get the
vicodin out of his system in an attempt to control his hallucinations.  House
plans to leave the treatment facility once he is clean, but he is strong-armed
into staying by his attending physician, Dr. Darryl Nolan.  Dr. Nolan agrees to
write a recommendation to reinstate House's medical license only if House
agrees to further treatment. When House is moved to a new ward in the
hospital,he develops a close relationship with his new roommate, Alvie, and
Lydia, a frequent visitor who helps House bend the rules.  House asks Alvie to
help him uncover incriminating information about Dr. Nolan that would allow him
to blackmail his way out of the treatment center and convinces Lydia to loan
him her car to sneak out a delusional patient in an attempt by House to
undermine Dr. Nolan's course of treatment. But when devastating events ensue,
House is humbled into reluctantly accepting help.
