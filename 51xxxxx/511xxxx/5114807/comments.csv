1. The Twelve Chairs(12 stuljev), 1971 by Leonid Gaidai, 2 parts torrents ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=146565
subtitles: notabenoid com/book/5473/16675/

2. The Twelve Chairs(12 stuljev), 1976 by Mark Zakharov, 4 parts torrents ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=78817

but unfortunately there're two big problems:

1. there're no any english subtitles, at least I can't find it

2. torrents ru - it's a so f* torrent's site (you can register only in strickly definite time and there's system of ratio, which ditermines your ability of downloading; this site's simply twisted the idea of free information itself!)

but these films are vere, very good, believe me"
