However violent and anger filled he may have been before conversion, but once he converts he becomes as meek as a baby lamb. Such is the power of the Bible, the book which gives the formula for everlasting life. Thank you God for this book and for the sacrifice of your son Jesus."

""....thanks for your uploads.........my bandwidth is limited and I have to pay for every MB of download.......could you please tell me which ones are the good christian movies so I could only download those..............""

In my opinion, all are good. So would request all down-loaders to please put your comments regarding three aspects
1. Quality
2. Overall movie ratings &
3. Relevance to Christianity.

Maybe you an judge it on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the least and 10 being the best.

And please continue seeding. Thanks. May God bless you all."

Pathanamthitta (Kerala): Few days back the Malayalam Daily, Kerala Kaumudi exposed shocking revelations about a jihadi organisation named ?Love Jihad? which has been conveniently ignored by rest of the media.

Trapping naive Non Muslim girls (Hindu and Christian girls) in the web of love inorder to convert to Islam is the modus operandi of the said organisation. Already more than 4000 girls have been converted to Islam by this Jihadi Romeos.

Special branch of Police started investigation when marriages of such large scales are reported within last 6 months. As per the instructions to recruits of this organisation, they have to love a Hindu girl within the time frame of 2 weeks and brainwash them to get converted and marry within 6 months. Special instructions to breed atleast 4 kids have also been given. If the target won?t get trapped within first 2 weeks, they are instructed to leave them and move on to another girl.

College students and working girls should be the prime target. Once completed their mission the organisation will give 1 lakh Rupees and Financial help for the youth to start business. Free Mobile Phone, Bikes and Fashionable dresses are offered to them as tools for the mission.

Money for this Love Jihad comes from Middle East. Each district have their own zone chairman?s to oversee the mission. Prior to College admission they make a list of non-muslim girls and their details and target those whom they feel vulnerable and easy to be brainwashed.

*******************

Of course conversion to Islam by muslims in this manner is nothing new. Some years back there was a huge hue and cry in Great Britain when Muslim Mullahs issued an edict to Muslims to get non-muslim girls drunk, sleep with them, get them pregnant and convert them to islam.

Muslims are really following in the footsteps of their great prophet who not only said but practiced what he preached,

The prophet said that, ""the woman can be married for religion, her fortune, or her beauty. So marry one for the religion"" (Abu Issa al-Tarmidi, Sunan al- Tarmidi p.275, B: 4, H:1092)

The prophet practiced what he preached. He married Zaynab, Safia and Ayesha for their beauty (he had several one night stands also with Maria the copt), Khadija Bibi for her fortune and several other woman to convert them to islam. Muslims worldwide are following in their footsteps today. Beware of them."
