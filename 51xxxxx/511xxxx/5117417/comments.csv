,MJP_33,2009-10-10T19:19Z,Symantec is detecting a possible Trojan virus. Anyone know anything or have an problems with this torrent?
,Mitch_Bainwol,2009-10-11T01:01Z,"To MJP_33: Pretty much all keygens will register somewhere as a virus. It's not even worth posting about.

There are two things to consider.

One is that GORDSMASH has earned a TRUSTED SKULL icon. That says a lot.

The other is that you should never run a keygen on your machine, because they are a key means of infection. Run it in a ""live"" XP such as on the Hirens utilities disk, or run it in a virtual sandbox.

Free Virtualization software is available for most platforms. Microsoft and Sun and Linux are all providers. Sun's is called Virtualbox, but the grandaddy is VMware Workstation. It's available somewhere ;-)"
,MJP_33,2009-10-12T02:38Z,Thanks Mitch. Much appreciated.
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-10-12T05:37Z,theres no virus or trojan in it
,MJP_33,2009-10-14T17:59Z,I know you are a very trusted uploader and symantec only said there was a possible trojan. I can't afford any kind of virus or worm right now though. Thank you for confirmation 
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-10-14T23:17Z,"@ MJP_33

yea it seems like pretty much every keygen is detected by an antivirus as a trojan nowadays. But yea all of my uploads are 100% clean :)"
[V],yourothermom,2009-10-17T06:14Z,Thank you!  Worked perfectly.
,SaintLukie,2009-10-31T15:49Z,Nothing came up with Kaspersky...worked beautifully thanks!
,splinternurse,2009-11-12T14:27Z,"adobe keeps telling me that the code i entered is invalid and i gotta put in a new key every time i start the program up, any way i can fix this? "
,ViperZac,2009-11-12T23:47Z,"I'm having the same problem, someone told me you have to deactivate updates. I just blocked all adobe programs with my firewall and it stopped- does anyone another way? I still get a popup saying adobe updater can't connect to the server, which is fine but it's be cool to make that go away too."
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-11-13T04:41Z,"@ splinternurse & ViperZac

look at my torrents and navigate to my Adobe CS4 Master Collection English Only torrent. In that torrent there will be a crack and a activation blocker which will prevent your copy of the master collection from rejecting the serials. If you have any more help then post another comment"
,matthew_rs7,2009-11-14T02:08Z,"Can someone PLEASE help me? I am using CS4 Master collection, Windows 7 firewall and I am getting the thing saying that my serial is revoked. I unchecked 4 CS4 things from the firewalls exceptions but I guess I am doing it wrong, can someone tell me how to block it so that I don't keep getting it?"
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-11-14T02:15Z,"@ matthew_rs7

do the same thing i told the people above your last comment"
,matthew_rs7,2009-11-16T18:24Z,"Alright, I am downloading it now and seeing if it works. Thanks man. is there anything I can do in return?"
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-11-17T01:55Z,"@ matthew_rs7

yes you can go to my site and donate :)
just kidding, unless you want to."
,matthew_rs7,2009-11-17T21:18Z,"hmm, I downloaded it but there is no read me.

I already have the CS4 installed of course, but there are no instructions.

When I run SC4, I always get asked for a key, though my keygen works, it's a process I have to constantly repeat.

I ran the file named ""Activation blocker"" then I get a CMD saying ""Server blacklist added!"" and I press a key and it closes.

is that it? do I have to do anything else? what about the whole 2 other folders named 'Amtlib.dll' for both X86 and X64? Do I have to do anything else?

I tried opening a CS4 program but still get prompted to enter a key, do I enter it and the blocker I ran earlier will then block the server after I entered it?

I really need details here please"

,pixelperu,2009-11-28T21:39Z,"Hey guys,  to all of you who are asking about that VIRUS ADVICE:

You MUST to understand now and forever:
That virus advice it means a false positive wich means the antivurs understand"" that keygen (mostly) tis a virus when what really happen is that is not.
U got it?

Browse a little bit in google and find out any technical explanation about it, but if you didnt get what I mean in this dumb ass explanation then I have my doubts about you are going to understand at all.

Stop to ask stupidits !"
,andreas8,2009-12-18T12:50Z,Gordsmash you rock! and you deserve your trusted uploader Skull. Everything working fine so far but sorry will be in touch if anything goes awry. :-)
,redread,2009-12-21T05:09Z,"This and every CS4 keygen I download works until I re-open a program, then asks for a new key. "

I'm on Windows7 and trying to do what you said. But Windows won't allow me to save changes in that notepad txt file...."

make sure that you are in a administrator account and right click on the hosts file and uncheck the Read Only Attribute so that you can write to it."
,piratecsar,2010-01-20T06:22Z,Thanks for the hook-up works great!!!
,etno12,2010-01-22T23:52Z,you guys could you tell me how to activate this adobe Cs4 ?
,OpticalDelusion,2010-01-31T22:51Z,Working great for me so far. Thanks for the key gen.
,fatbottom,2010-02-01T14:37Z,"i'm getting an error message- ""the application was unable to start correctly (0x000007b). click ok to close application,"" when i try to open other apps besides photoshop.   it's working in photoshop which is the first app i opened after installing, deactivation, amtlib, and keygen.  any other app i try to open, i don't get an activation menu, just an the same error message. can anyone help me out?"
,VelanoH,2010-02-06T06:52Z,"I downloaded this keygen and it works fine, however, it crashed my comp.  Took me over an hour to fix it.  

I suggest downloading it, using it, deleting it, and then running a virus scan.  I do not know how all the seeders are not crashing, maybe I just got unlucky.

BTW, I did trace the problem back to the keygen, I am not just blowing steam."
,waynevanson,2010-02-15T05:10Z,"I've used this before, it's all good if you do it right, so don't stuff up. That date technique you said does not work btw."
,waynevanson,2010-02-15T05:11Z,"Sorry, i commented on the wrong torrent :s my bad!"
,waynevanson,2010-02-15T05:20Z,"WORKS A TREAT THIS KEYGEN DOES!

If antivirus is being gay, just disable it quickly."
,JuticePride,2010-02-18T05:00Z,I've downloaded the CS4 Master Collection Trial version from Adobe but have not installed it. BUT....I'm new to this whole Torrent thing.....I've downloaded it but can't open. It's in my Mozilla downloads box but can't do anything after that. I know I may sound like a novice.....which I apparently am...lol But maybe a little more direction would be good for me! Any help would be appreciated?!?!?!
,patrick1995,2010-03-11T15:23Z,"Licensing for this product has been expiried... THIS KEYGEN DOESN""T WORK!!!"
,M.Q,2010-03-21T18:04Z,"THIS WON'T WORK FOR *****TRIAL VERSIONS*****

Uninstall your trial version and find a torrent from a trusted source on TPB."
[T],FatFreddy756,2010-03-27T00:40Z,"@ All that say it doesn't work for the trial version.

Using the keygen alone will not make the programs work as the keys on the keygen are already in use. You have to download the cracked amtlib.dll file and the Activation Blocker.cmd from my CS4 Collection torrent to fully block Adobe from checking the key on your program so it doesn't say license expired.

You run the Activation Blocker.cmd and then copy and paste the amtlib.dll file into almost all of the CS4 programs and then type the serial in and then your ready to go!!! And then it won't ask you for any more serials."

No false positive here :("
[T],FatFreddy756,2010-10-05T20:48Z,"@ DarkMan70

your insane. lol
the keygen is a false positive. In fact i would say that almost all the keygens i download are all false positives. Plus I never upload viruses as that is dumb of a person to do.

So nope, its clean :)
