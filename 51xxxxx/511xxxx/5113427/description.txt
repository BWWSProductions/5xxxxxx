Produced by former radio star William Conrad, this taut psychological Western features Conrad as Chris Hamish, a lawman assigned to bring back from Mexico accused murderer Robert Kallen (Anthony Quinn). Locating Kallen in a small Mexican pueblo proves easy enough, but bringing him to justice becomes a major task, as Hamish and his prisoner must traverse a seemingly endless desert alive with hostile Apaches. Hamish has promised his girlfriend, Elena (Lita Milan), to return safe and sound, and Kallen plays on both Hamish's innate decency and the lawman's increasing paranoia, with the trek quickly turning into a game of cat and mouse. Until, that is, the duo comes across a young child (Ellen Hope Monroe) orphaned by the Apaches, whose presence helps bring out the last embers of decency in both hunter and hunted. ~ Hans J.
