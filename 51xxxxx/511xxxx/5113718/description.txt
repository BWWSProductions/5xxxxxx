When the body of a man with a broken neck is found under a pile of trash, itâ€™s up to our favorite amateur detective, Alex Donovan, and his team at the Forgotten Network to clean up the mess and I.D. the victim.

John Doe had a key in his pocket. A bag of hamburgers was found near the body. After seeing a photo of the greasy grub, Walter immediately identifies it as coming from Nateâ€™s Bar & Grill. The man knows his burgers! Walter discovers that the original Nateâ€™s is the only place that uses crinkle cut pickles, and those are the kind seen on the victimâ€™s burger. The man knows his condiments, too!

Alex meets Walter at Nateâ€™s where a waitress recognizes the victim as one of her regular customers. She doesnâ€™t know his name but does remember he had a cool money clip with a football on it. She also tells them he recently got into a fight with another loudmouth regular.
