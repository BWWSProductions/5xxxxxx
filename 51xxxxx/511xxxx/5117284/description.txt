Release Notes:

The Oklahoman oddballs The Flaming Lips return with a mammoth
collection of compositions, a double album entitled 'Embryonic'. Their
twelfth full-length record, it takes in some typically off-the-wall
influences, including Miles Davis and John Lennon. The group's
psychedelic background may have informed their decision to draft in
MGMT for a contribution to one track, and even Karen O from the Yeah
Yeah Yeahs makes an appearance on vocal duties. Recorded in
guitarist/keyboardist Stephen Drozd's house, it is the first time the
Lips have attempted a double album.
