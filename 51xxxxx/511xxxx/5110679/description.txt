What these do is when you/they click on anyone of them it shutsdown you computer in 15mins

so you replace them on your/someones elses computer so when they/you go on it

and click the icons it comes up with a message and shutsdown there computer lol

and the best thing is you can't click it off so its gonna shutdown 

REGARDLESS off what they/you do lol there id more detail in the read me of course
