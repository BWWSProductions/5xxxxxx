Under the Flag is the debut full-length from France's old school throwbacks,
Holy Cross. Don't let the name fool you, Holy Cross are not a Christian band.
The have chosen Norse mythology as their idiom even though the album cover looks
more like a scene from the crusades. Go figure. Mixed metaphors aside, Holy
Cross crank out some pretty good 80s-inspired tunes on Under the Flag. The sound
is akin to bands like Omen, yet there are some modern influences, like Sabaton
or Witchking, that are also evident.
