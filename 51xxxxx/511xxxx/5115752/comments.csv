,USJetPilot,2010-04-29T03:15Z,"Will you please post what program or CODEC you used to compress this file?  The .AVIs will not run using the most current DiVX, Windows Media and QuickTime."
,M60Coyote,2010-07-12T03:26Z,This is to help you transition from man to woman.  I\'ll comment later when I find out the whole codec ordeal too.  Thanks for the great upload!
,M60Coyote,2010-07-16T07:45Z,Stuck at 99.0%. When I\'m done I\'ll seed at 10 ratio or higher to help more.
,USJetPilot,2010-07-28T22:56Z,"M60Coyote, have you had any luck with the codec?  I have tried every convertor and about a dozen programs, but it shows both the PDF and AVI files to be unrecognizable.  Please let me know if you break the code on this.  I will help seed it, as well.  Peace.

,M60MewMew,2010-08-02T08:05Z,Can't get the files to even run with all of my K-Lite Codecs installed.  Still stuck at 99%.  M60Coyote account went to a friend of mine so this is the one and the same.  That being said don't waste your time.  I know this is an important thing but KOiCHAN5 is even seeding.  Sorry.   :(
,M60MewMew,2010-08-02T08:08Z,In short term no luck and go somewhere else. KOiCHAN5 isnt seeding and not even K-Lite or VLC will help with this.  Sorry.
