Welcome back folks, TPB still rocking despite all.  Sort of gives you hope for the World does it not.   Anyway the very latest for the ink is still wet on the DVD sleeve of this one.

As allways, I have split the main VOB's into tracks using DVD DeCrypter and tagged them using industry guidelines so this lot is good to go on your Video Discotheque.

Let us hope it is not too long before Demonoid is back up again too.  Don't forget I super seed for the first 24 hours or so to get this out as quickly as I can.   Enjoy, and as they used to say on Hill Street Blues....

Be Carefull out there!
