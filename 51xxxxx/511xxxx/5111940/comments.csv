,ras_yo,2009-10-08T13:09Z,"The Bad Ape and mac OS 10.5/Leopard doesnt work well together. A lot of Hang-Ups, Bluescreens and so son ...
works fine with mac OS 10.4."
,EdoDodo,2009-10-08T18:14Z,"ras_yo:

Indeed there have been some problems reported, although I use Mac OS X 10.5 and have not had any of these problems.

However these problems are (mostly) caused by the Application Enhancer itself, and not The Bad APE.

What I would advise you and other people who have these types of issues using The Bad APE is to upgrade to the latest version of Application Enhancer.

You can download the latest version here:

If this does not solve your problems then you will probably have to look for another way of cracking your programs."

Thanks for the link. The last version of 'BadApe' works fine with MacOS10.5.8, but not with 10.6.
Thanks for help   :o)"

You're welcome, and indeed, its a pity it doesn't work with Snow Leopard, I hope they'll release an update soon."
,qwik3r2,2009-11-16T03:30Z,"there is no library/application support/ape folder, where the hell do you put the plist file???"
,EdoDodo,2009-11-16T19:39Z,"@qwik3r2:

Are you sure that you've installed The Bad APE correct?

If you have then also make sure that you are looking for the ""/Library/Application Support/The APE"" folder in your user folder (the ~ before the path means you have to start from you user folder)."
,MKuhlberg,2010-02-10T19:31Z,"ras_yo, so does this crack not work on snowleopard? if it doesnt ill just go find a different one"
