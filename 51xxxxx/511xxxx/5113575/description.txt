Works with Many Applications

While many MathType users create equations for Microsoft Word documents and PowerPoint presentations, MathType also works with many, many other applications and websites and we are adding more and more every day:

    * Add equations to Quark and InDesign documents.
    * Copy equations from websites like Wikipedia, PlanetMath, etc. for use in your own work. You can author new equations for those websites as well.
    * Copy equations from Mathematica or Maple into your research.
    * Use equations to label DeltaGraph scientific graphs and Excel spreadsheets.
    * Work with TeX and LaTeX editors and documents.
