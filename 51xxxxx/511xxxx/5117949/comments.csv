,lolwut11234,2009-10-21T17:31Z,How exactly do I uninstall this so I can reinstall and run this patch? I don't see an uninstaller so do I just delete the folder? 
,AshSocka,2009-10-25T19:24Z,"I'm actually having problems installing this. It installs but when I copy the crack and run it, it loads onto the Empire Screen yet remains there until I'm forced to manually restart the PC. It does not load into the intro movie or onto the main menu. Any help?"

[T],Tanauser,2009-12-18T12:15Z,I need a month to finish them
,killer163,2009-12-19T15:33Z,"s it possible to make the multiplayer campaign beta work on the razor release or any other version. you can get an key from empire total wars site, but you need to activate empire total war from steam to play. do we need to wait for razor to release his update 9 or is it possible to make it work another way? Tanauser is it possible or not. "
[T],Tanauser,2009-12-20T08:06Z,"I don't know ; I never play on line ; I have seen something that enables the game (Razors) in MultiPlayer

If I remember well , I think it was on Demonoid , but it was few month ago ; and more updates were added since so I don't know if tweak still works"
,Malarky1231,2009-12-28T07:45Z,"hey tanauser i downloaded this update but my prussian campaign crashes on startup. In all my other campaigns, everytime i click on a building the game freezes. I dl the hotfix and i do have the razor 1911 version, i dnt knw what's wrong"

will make the free warpath units available in the vanilla campaign

Playable and Recruitable

I have found a way to make them playable inclusive using the warpath tech. tree

((There is no Razordox9 ; this is the last known))

I guess all CA's efforts will be on their next game NTW"
,Toekneedeezee,2010-02-18T19:09Z,lol you cant play the natives. They dont have anything past militia muskets. They would fair horribly in Europe. You can only play as major nations. 
,Alzitar,2010-03-06T13:59Z,"Dear pirates, yar!

Ive noticed some people have alot of trouble with the installation.. I myself was quite worried when I saw all the different files and comments. However I've installed the game in 1 try and no problem with anything so far (been playing for about 5 hours now). Ive actually created this little account to explain in few simple steps so everyone can enjoy!

Step 1
Download:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4750077/Empire_Total_War_Special_Forces_Edition-Razor1911.iso

Step 2
Download:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5117949/Empire_Total_War_v1.5_Update_RazorDOX

Comment: Let me be clear; you absolutly dont need anything else then these 2 downloads! no hotfixes, no bugfixes no other vague rars.. nothing! These files together will give you a working version of the game ver 1.5!

Step 3
Load the iso's with Daemon tools (or any other image mounting software). Note however that the instalastion will ask you a few times to locate the mounted disk, do this every time and it will continue installing. After a while it will obviously ask for disk 2, if so mount disk 2 with deamon tools and again locate it when the installer ask for it.

Step 4
This is the one most people seem to forget.
On the first iso (empire_disc1) there is a folder named razor1911. Copy the content of this folder to your install path.
To clerify: copy not the folder razor1911 but all the folders and files inside it to the folder where you installed empire total war (example: c:\Empite Total war).
You will be prompted if you want to overwrite the files, press ""yes to all"".

Step 5
Now open the update folder (from the second torrent I stated here) and copy the rzr-etw8.exe file to your empire total war installation folder. Then execute it. It will now start to update your empire total war files.

Step 6
Now that you have updated, run the file install.redist.cmd this file will be in your installation folder.

Step 7
Final step! Now put the Empire.exe file from the update in the installation folder and overwrite the existing one.
(you can find this exe file in the second torrent I linked)

Step 8
Thank all the uploaders and creaters of this upload

Cheers! & Enjoy :)

Side note: I installed on a clean install of windows xp pro SP3, so if this isnt working for you and you really want to play.. get a fresh install of wxp sp3 :P"
,bryk,2010-03-22T11:34Z,"This update (along with the hotfix+crack) now allows me to play with the native American units-I'm not sure if this is Warpath content or not,but thank you anyway! Off to install update #9.."
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-30T09:13Z,"Pirate mod Updated on TBP

,smackdaddy_au,2010-04-01T16:48Z,"I just finished the download of this torrent and AVG is complaining of ""Trojan Horse Generic17.AGZD"" in rzr-etw8.exe.  

Hmmm.  This doesn't sound like a legitimate Razor release.  Has it been tampered with or is it just a fake?  

Nice move, whoever added that little bundle.  Really appreciate that.  Always a pleasure to have malicious code on my pc.  Just love it.  Oh yeah.

I am getting the same error as stated above, but only this time around installing the game on a new windows install. I've had this working before, this seems new."
,Nerd4ever,2011-05-19T04:57Z,"For the ""A sharing violation occurred while accessing an unnamed file."" problems. 

Disable your anti-virus first before installing the patch. Maybe that's the problem."
