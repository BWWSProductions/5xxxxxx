Problem running Mario and Luigi: Bowser Inside Story on your R4DS.

Look no further. I have compiled all you need into this.

1) format the sd card with full format (FAT32)

2) extract all the files and one folder of this download to the root of your ORIGINAL R4DS memory card.

3) Place the USA version of the game into the root.

4) And put everything into your nds and it should be up and running.


I have used the tutorial at http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=164359&st=0 and all credits goes to triassic911.
