""Operation System Is Not Instaled"""
,bond5512,2009-10-15T05:47Z,AFAIK 10.6 will not run on Windows yet.  I have only seen 10.5.x under vmware windows
,packhater,2009-11-06T16:49Z,"Not running on a mbp 13inch 10.6.1 machine. The filename after you open the dmg file is Mac OS X Server 10.6.vmwarevm. Vmware Fusion 3.0, it does NOT run. It reports that it is not a OS X Server machine.  I thought this torrent was supposed to be OS X CLIENT???    hmmmm  :)"
,packhater,2009-11-06T17:48Z,"Also does NOT run in vmware station 7 under windows 7 Ultimate 64bit. It reports as no operating system found.

:)"
,bond5512,2010-01-28T23:09Z,"Wow.  Some people can't read.  Its not supposed to run under VMware workstation 6 or 7.  The post says VMware Fusion.

Second.  It reports server because Fusion will only allow Server to be virtualized.  If you follow the steps in the post it makes Fusion think Client is a server.  If you want to rename your files and edit the .vmx files you are welcome to do so.  You can call it what ever you like."
