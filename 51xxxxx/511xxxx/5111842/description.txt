Dinosaucers was an animated television series created by DIC Entertainment in association with Ellipse Programm√© that originally aired in syndication in the USA in 1987. 65 total episodes were made and the show only lasted one season during the 1987-1988 television season.

Approximately 22 minutes per episode.

Files are in .mp4 format. Each episode is broken into 2 parts. These are ripped from VHS tapes so the A/V quality isn't great, but they're watchable.



**UPDATE**

I just realized that Episode 30 part 2 was corrupted. You can download the fixed version here:
