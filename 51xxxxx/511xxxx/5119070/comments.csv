,skeletor1134,2009-10-13T02:41Z,anyone have an activation key?
,dzerlyfee,2009-10-27T00:06Z,Where is the install directory for TouchCopy?  Can't find the files to overwrite! Thanks for your help.
,iPetur,2009-11-01T02:46Z,"This was extremely helpful. My friend messed up his old iPhone and he had to get a new one. The only thing is, while he had his old one with all his music, his AlienWare laptop crashed and the company refused to extract information from his hard drive (MoBo fried). So this is going to get his songs off of his old iPhone back onto his computer."
,iPetur,2009-11-01T02:46Z,Seeding.
,spupsta,2009-11-05T11:57Z,cheers for the program buddy ive been having heaps of issues getting the tracks i bought on itunes back after my laptop completely crashed (new ones on the way) and now ive just gotten a new iphone to replace my old broken one... this worked a treat after i worked out what you ment by copying the startup file. for those who are a bit simple like me go into explorer and open the touchcopy file so you can see all the files for the program. delete the file thats called touch copy and replace it with the one in the downloaded file Lzo. once again cheers
,mizzlola,2009-11-06T02:31Z,This one is working perfectly. But you can not add external files from the computer to the iPhone ... :( 
,bman8,2009-12-18T22:28Z,I must be thick cause I don't understand how to activate it can someone give me a real step by step?
,ladylovestheshoes,2009-12-20T17:24Z,i'm having a problem figuring out how to overwrite the file too. help would be awesome

,P0WERD0G,2010-01-31T09:57Z,It sucks because u can only copy 100 files or u have to pay $25 to get unlimited...So i didnt get what i expected
,closetmonkey209,2010-02-04T01:35Z,copy the lso file touch copy then paste it in Wide.Angle file on your c drive
,spcmen,2010-02-06T01:40Z,"howto guide for newbies:
1.download content of torrent (it is virus free! no worries).
2. open and install using TouchCopy09.msi (do not use the one on their website because the crack will not work on that,i tried it:)
3. after installing  go to the folder Lz0 copy its content and paste it in C:\Program Files\Wide Angle Software\TouchCopy 09 

(i have a english version of xp, you might have to change -program files- with something of similar name in your language in your c:\ folder).

4. BE NICE AND - S - E - E - D -  IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF US ALL !!!


enjoy."

Any ideas?

Thank you!"

Thanks so much."
,Dex_Luther,2011-03-12T16:29Z,"This program is awesome, except for it's photo transfer. for some reason the pictures I get off of my Ipod end up being completely black."
,Shadysmurff,2011-05-23T17:26Z,"The program is 100% fully working, cracked, can transfer files unlimitedly (no 100 limit), and doesnt need or require a Serial Key, it doesnt even ask you for it.

@to any other who's having problems with the program/software asking for Serial Key, or getting a notice that your trial period has expired and what not, or getting error after you re-installed or overwriten the software using either official or modified installers:

Remember when doing your first/fresh install, DO NOT RUN THE PROGRAM YET AFTER ITS INSTALLED, remember to first Copy the TouchCopy.exe inside the Lz0 folder and overwrite the one on whereever directory you installed it, for ex usually in : C:/Program Files/WideAngleSoftware Folder/

Now if you have accidentaly run the program after it installed without applying/copying the patch of TouchCopy.exe above then its already considered you need to uninstall the whole thing again, you must first start a clean-install & wipe out all traces of WideAngelSoftware.

Goto

Start>ControlPanel>AddRemovePrograms>Uninstall the TouchCopy or the one named WideAngelSoftware, we are not done yet as there are still traces of WideAngelSoftware inside your computer's regedit that records when you installed it previously before and records your trial period if it has passed, or even remember youve previously installed this onto your computer and your trial has already been used up.

Goto

Start>Run(for windows xp)>or just type in the search box (for windows vista/7)>then type Regedit>then look for WideAngelSoftware Folders related inside regedits (basically search for all Software Folders that has one inside either of these):

HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>SOFTWARE
 HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG>Software

delete all folders named, or any thing regarding this name, ""WideAngelSoftware"" , then after all the traces have been deleted, you can start a real clean install. "
