If you enjoy this upload be sure to check out the latest ""Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup"" which is NOTHING like the old versions of Loose Change. You can find it here:

Share the truth!"
,brainphreak,2009-10-07T22:33Z,"Come on people SEED! 74 leechers and only 5 Seeders, Ive uploaded plenty and there are plenty of snatchers, no excuses, just seed! At least do 1to1 ratio to help spread this info to others! You dont want people to not download because of lack of  seeders right? Do your part!

Oh yeah, and leave a comment if you appreciate the upload, the silence is deafening!"

,brainphreak,2009-11-01T19:03Z,"You will have a video_ts folder full of the video files. Any DVD burning program will allow you to burn the files as a video DVD. If you dont already have nero or something, then you can follow these directions:

It also has a link to a free program for burning them. Let me know if you have any troubles! Good luck! "
