Alien Encounters is a science fiction anthology comic book published by FantaCo Enterprises and then Eclipse Comics. The comic debuted with FantaCo in 1981, and then was picked up by Eclipse, where (starting over from issue 1) it ran for fourteen issues from 1985 to 1987.  Eclipse began publishing this title in 1985, soon after the cancellation of Alien Worlds, a similar science-fiction themed anthology.

Several noteworthy creators worked on the series, including Stephen R. Bissette, John Bolton, joe Chiodo, Richard Corben, Howard Cruse, Chuck Dixon, Rick Geary, Bruce Jones, David Lloyd, David Mazzucchelli, Gray Morrow, Timothy Truman, Thomas Yeates, and Mike Zeck.

Catherine Yronwode edited Alien Encounters for Eclipse, which was noted for its racy, pulp magazine-inspired covers, and was sometimes criticized for featuring unnecessary nude scenes.
