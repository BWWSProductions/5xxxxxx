24-bit samples only. When you load the instruments in Kontakt, it may occasionally complain that the 16-bit samples are not there. As I understand it, this is what you want. And anyway it's what I have.

With Scarbee Vintage Keyboard Collection your sound will have the flare that your jeans are missing... Scarbee VKC represents a powerful new synergy between Scarbee's renowned vintage electro mechanical keyboard libraries and Steinberg's cutting edge virtual sampler technology in the form of the HALion Player, based on the HALion 3.1 sampler engine.  
 
Scarbee libraries now come ready to play 'out of the box' as standalone instruments for Apple OSX and Windows XP as well as a plugins in various interface formats: VSTi, AU, Dxi.  
 
The Scarbee VKC includes the class-leading and award winning RSP73 - sound of Rhodes Stage Piano MK1 73â„¢ and WEP - sound of Wurlitzer 200Aâ„¢ electric pianos, as well as two new instruments which are 'hot off the press' - the 'D6-C - sound of Hohner Clavinet D6â„¢, sampled for each of the 4 standard pickup settings: DB, DA, CB, CA - in both a standard version and a version with mute bar switched ON and the rare 'N-HP' - sound of Hohner Pianet Nâ„¢.  
 
Scarbee sample libraries are hailed around the world for capturing not only the classic tone of these vintage instruments, but also their 'feel', and the new D6-C and N-HP are no exceptions. With the D6-C, Scarbee introduces 'Horizontal Release Technology', whereby release samples are chosen from the wave pool depending on how long a key has been held - allowing a staccato played note to create a different release tone to a note which is sustained for a longer period.  
 
To achieve this, each key sampled on the D6-C has 24 release samples assigned to it alone! The D6-C also makes use of HALion's advanced triggering options to allow the inclusion of the occasional 'off center' string strike, a well known characteristic of the original instrument. Sampled, mapped and programmed with great love and slavish attention to detail, the Scarbee Vintage Collection presents all of these classic electro mechanical instruments in their ultimate form.  
 
At the core of the HALion Player housing the Vintage Keyboard Collection is the latest 3.1 version of the powerful HALion sampling engine from Steinberg. Capable of reproducing files in 32 bit resolution at sample rates up to 384kHz, a single instance of the player will play back up to 256 stereo voices on 16 midi channels, with 5 Stereo outputs. (Several instances of the Player can be loaded into a host simultaneously if desired.) HALion player can also connect even to any Rewire compatible Host application, for example Protools.  
 
SCARBEE VKC features 8 assignable editing knobs/switches in the Q-Control section, newly developed for V3.1 and presets can include various combinations and control of the high quality real-time FX, like Reverb, Phaser, Talkbox, Delay, EQ, BitCrusher, AutoWah and more (27 FX in total). Presets can also take advantage of the on board filters including: Notch / High Pass / Low Pass / Band Pass 12 dB and 24 dB Filter as well as the classic analog style Waldorf filters which feature a 'Fatness' function for overdriven filter sounds.  
 
A neat little feature for the â€œVintage Puristâ€: Play key A-1 and you will hear original noise from instrument looped. With Noise knob you can adjust the level of the noise - take it completely away if you like a clean sound with zero hum and hiss!  
 
INCLUDED IN SCARBEE VKC:  
 
SCARBEE R.S.P. â€˜73 - Consists of a collection of truly authentic 'deeply sampled' renderings of the Rhodes Stage Piano MK I 73â„¢, recreating not only its signature sound but also the unique dynamic response of the original instrument. How much detail is there in the instrument? To start with, all samples are full length and unlooped. Each of the 73 keys of the Mark 1 was sampled at 12 different velocities - ranging from 0 to -26 dB - but this is only half the story. In order to capture that magical feel of really 'playing' a RhodesÂ®, we also recorded 'release' samples for each of the 12 velocities, at the exact same level as the corresponding 12 sustain samples. The release tone - a sound created when a damper bounces against the tine as a key is released, is an intrinsic element of what musicians recognize as the original 'RhodesÂ® Sound'.  
 
SCARBEE W.E.P. - A faithful reproduction of the classic Wurlitzer 200Aâ„¢ Electric Piano, recreating not only its signature sound but also the unique dynamic response of the original instrument. How much detail is there in the instrument? In order to accurately reproduce the original EP200Aâ€™s dynamics, both the sustained and release sounds of each of the 64 keys of the WurlitzerÂ® has been sampled at 16 different velocities â€“ resulting in a total pool of over 2000 24 bit wav files. All samples are full length and unlooped and we also recorded 'release' samples for each of the 16 velocities, at the exact same level as the corresponding 16 sustain samples. (except those for the top 5 keys which have no damper, causing the keys to ring out to their end).  
 
SCARBEE D6-C - A unique and totally authentic reproduction of the funky Hohner Clavinet D6â„¢, recreating not only its signature sound but also the unique dynamic response of the original instrument. How much detail is there in the instrument? In order to accurately reproduce the original Clavinetâ„¢ dynamics, both the sustained and release sounds of the D6 has been sampled at up to 20 different sustained velocities - including samples of the occasional 'off center' string strike, a well known characteristic of the original instrument. All samples are full length and unlooped and with the D6-C, Scarbee introduces 'Horizontal Release Technology', whereby release samples are chosen from the wave pool depending on how long a key has been held - allowing a staccato played note to create a different release tone to a note which is sustained for a longer period. To achieve this, each key sampled on the D6-C has 24 release samples assigned to it alone! This was the only way to reproduce the very special action and soul of the original instrument. Scarbee have sampled each of the 4 standard pickup settings: DB, DA, CB, CA - in both a standard version and a version with mutebar switched on.  
 
SCARBEE N-HP - A faithful reproduction of the rare Hohner Pianet N (Natural)â„¢ Electric Piano. How much detail is there in the instrument? The Pianet Nâ„¢ used a special technique to produce itâ€™s charming sound: so-called â€˜sticky hammersâ€™ made from rubber lifted the tine - more or less like a Harpsichord and when a hammer released its tine, the classic pianet sound was produced. This technique means that the instrument is virtually without dynamics - but even so, itâ€™s got a really cool sound! Sampling 6 velocities more than covers the pianetâ€™s dynamic range, but as with the D6-C, N-HP takes advantage of 'Horizontal Release Technology', whereby different release samples are chosen from the wave pool depending on how long a key has been held - allowing a staccato played note to create a different release tone to a note which is sustained for a longer period. Due to the simple mechanical design of the instrument it was only necessary to make 5 release samples per key to obtain a perfect simulation of the original keyboard.  
 
Vintage Keyboard FX VST/AU plugin is a virtual rack packed with outstanding models of a range of different vintage analogue effects processors.  
 
Coded by world class software developers Thomas Serafini, Alfonso De Prisco - and graphic artist Stefan Kengen, the VKFX completes Scarbeeâ€™s vision for vintage keyboard sample libraries which faithfully capture the sounds of the original masters â€“ right down to the effects processing which was often a key element in defining a classic instrumentâ€™s unique â€˜voiceâ€™.  
 
Loaded into the VKFX are eight premium quality effects processors, including the essential electric piano preamp with stereo tremolo, a Compressor, Wah (Envelope Filter), Phase Shifter, Chorus Unit, Overdrive, Tape Delay, and a Valve Amp modeled on arguably the most popular device ever used to amplify electric keyboards (and the model includes the four spring reverb).  
 
-Multiple mode switching allows module architecture to alternate from one popular version of a particular effects processor to another which has a completely different sonic character - at the touch of a button.  
-Simultaneous editing of all processors is available via a friendly and intuitive interface presented in the form of a rack of independent modules.  
-Module order can be rearranged by simply dragging and dropping modules to where theyâ€™re needed, giving users fast and total control over the effects chain.  
-Easy A-B morphing between presets makes experimentation and creation of new sounds addictively effortless.  
-Highly CPU efficient coding and module layout means that users can load the VKFX without the fear of watching a systemâ€™s processor overhead disappear, in the certain knowledge that processing quality is first class.  
-All rates and times can be syncâ€™d to VST host, internal clock or left independent for a more â€˜analogâ€™ approach. â€¢ All parameters are automatable. All parameters are assigned to midi controllers.  
-A flexible file management system allows one, several or all modules to be loaded and saved â€“ enabling easy mixing and matching of module presets saved from different sessions.  
-A generous licensing arrangement allows the licensed user to install and operate VKFX on up to three PCs simultaneously â€“ greatly easing investment costs for users running multiple CPU systems.  
-Mouse sensitive tool tips allow the user to get manual-style information by simply hovering the mouse over any area of interest.  
-A comprehensive on-line manual in pdf format is only one mouse click away at all times.  
 
VKFX is the perfect partner for any vintage keyboard instrument, and a tantalizing environment in which to enjoy manipulating effects on other sound sources.
