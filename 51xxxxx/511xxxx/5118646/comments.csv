Never heard of them, although I am kind of out of the loop, being a drummer, even one who's all electronic!  Really could use some good synth and keyboard sounds for triggering, sampling onto my Roland SPD-S, and for in Acid Pro, etc.  
THANKS!!!"

Cheers"

,Beepboxx,2010-11-09T12:42Z,"These are really super samples, works with Kontakt 3 VST in Cubase 5, Windows XP. Problems loading into HalionOne, have Halion 3 and that annoying dongle, on my Mac.
Files are rar and iso and should not extract on a Mac, wonder if the .nki or .fxp will read on the Mac, I know the samples will be OK. May give it a try.
Another way is you could use the wave files and create the sample one note at a time in Kompakt or Kontakt, I did that with Vox samples, The Doors keyboard sounds, works OK, but takes time.
Thanks for these samples, nicely done! Seed this!"

,Fuylo,2010-12-22T21:40Z,"really need some help with this one, its all samples, but when I load an instrument into kontakt 3, it says several hundred files are missing.  the instrument appears on the rack, but no sound when i hit the keys.  not sure if i installed correctly, anyone have directions to get this to work with kontakt?

Really wish this was a standalone vst, or at least a more automated install.  I'm a musician, not a programmer, though I do appreciate the upload."

It's out on DL from NI..They release the software disc's tomorrow. It's not expensive but there is no demo to try..I could be wrong but that's as much as I know about it..Thank you"
