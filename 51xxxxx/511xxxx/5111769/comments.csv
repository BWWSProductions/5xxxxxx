Though the title says it's only 720p."
,tomahawk_dts,2009-10-07T08:35Z,I'm wondering -> 11GB and AC3?! What about full- bitrate DTS track? My wondering goes to the BOZX group not to the uploader.
,ronaneire,2009-10-08T01:37Z,Thanx ive been looking for this for a very long time!!!
,TMA2,2010-01-19T21:28Z,"BOZX isn't the group, HDCLASSiCS is. wish he wouldn't put his name on the end of torrent titles, it's confusing."
,Dizzious,2010-01-23T04:16Z,"If it's really 1920x800, then it's better than 720, not as good as 1080. 

I would rather have a straight-up 720p version, 1920x800 is a pain in the ass resolution to work with; there is no TV or monitor that can display a video at this resolution without either cropping it, fucking up the aspect ratio, or adding black bars to the top & bottom... I wish people would stop using this stupid ultra-wide-screen resolutions; nobody, NOBODY likes wasting 40% of their screen due to letterbox bars... "
,TMA2,2010-02-06T20:53Z,"christ, the aspect ratio is going to be the same whether it's 720p or 1080p you asshat. would you rather it be pan & scan, and lose part of the picture?"

PS3 can't play it.
