,jragnar,2009-11-07T23:54Z,"Help please! I have installed the game as I should. But I HAVE NOT runned the patch, since I understood that the patch was only for multiplayer. I HAVE copied the crack into the game. When I start the game I only get an black screen along with the windows error sound. Can someone help me? "
,Alexxxx,2009-11-12T17:00Z,"I got the same problem as jragnar, black screen and the windows error sound in the background :/"
,Rush_Macintosh,2009-12-16T05:20Z,"Hey people, I have same probs with black scren and game not works but i read the instructions carefully and the soluction is:

""Goto 'C:Documents and SettingsLocal SettingsApplication DataActivisionCoDWaWplayersprofiles' for XP
    or 'C:UsersAdministratorLocal SettingsApplication DataActivisionCoDWaWplayersprofiles' for Vista.

Delete all folders there. Create a text file named 'active.txt' and put the username you want to use in the file, nothing else.
Create a folder with that username in the same place, this folder should be empty.""

ENJOY...  :D"
