NOTES:

-Multiplayer and Co-OP WILL NOT work with the cracks supplied or any other cracks available.
To use these features you need a valid cd-key, buy the game to accquire one.

-If you cannot get past picking a difficulty here is the fix. It will create an 'Offline Profile'.
Goto 'C:Documents and Settings<YOUR_USERNAME>Local SettingsApplication DataActivisionCoDWaWplayersprofiles' for XP
    or 'C:UsersAdministratorLocal SettingsApplication DataActivisionCoDWaWplayersprofiles' for Vista.

Delete all folders there. Create a text file named 'active.txt' and put the username you want to use in the file, nothing else.
Create a folder with that username in the same place, this folder should be empty.

-If you get an error like the one below...

...which you shouldn't if your using version 1.6. Goto Device Manager> Sound, video and game controllers> Unimodem Half-Duplex Audio Device.
And disable it. No this wont hurt anything else and you should be able to play now.

-Any DirectX related issues?
Upgrade to the latest DirectX.

-If you don't know what a CRC32 or a MD5 is, don't worry about it.


Thanks goto ViTALiTY(v1.6) and RELOADED(v1.0) for cracked(No-CD) executables.
