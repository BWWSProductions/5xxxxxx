,EnemyDrone,2009-10-07T16:19Z,Another '9' file?? I hope the audio is better on this one!! We dont need fifteen '9' files with the same crappy audio!
,rooney71,2009-10-07T16:50Z,extremezone pls comment on the audio when u check this... thank you!
,situttevabene,2009-10-07T17:25Z,"All due respect but if this is an R5 there should not be DVDRIP in the title or Source: DVD

If, on the other hand this is a DVD rip I bowe before you and respectfully ask Extremezone to take a ritalin;-)"
,ivicakc,2009-10-07T17:44Z,Yes..is DVDrip..when you see ''PREMIERE.DVDRIP.XVID.[Eng]-DUQA''...this is DVDrip...go DOQU go..
,situttevabene,2009-10-07T17:51Z,"Extreme, i know you're greenskulled and all but you've been off a few times in the last few weeks...What is it? Trying to be there first no matter if you're right?

I don't comment often but i've been noticing this going on now for some time and I'm starting to become paranoia...

Other then this nothing but respect for all;-)"
[T],DUQA-TEAM,2009-10-07T17:54Z,"Absolutely it is  PREMIERE DVDRIP

[V],neon,2009-10-08T09:07Z,"vicerock is correct iLG's copy has exellent video and audio and it's labeled correctly as r5 not a dvd rip

,Cybersprire,2009-10-08T09:20Z,"Shit audio..

v: 10
a: 4"
,cpnxftw,2009-10-08T09:41Z,"regardless of the shit-talk, thank you for your effort :)"
,situttevabene,2009-10-08T10:28Z,"Ok, the discusssion about the audio was going on since the beginning of the post...DUQA could and should have mentioned the quality of the audio when this was mentioned / asked. Saying it is a Premiere.DVDrip means fuck all if you ask me.

Sorry for bitching but this is bullcrap!

Cheers"
,miknos,2009-10-08T17:55Z,"Same for me:

V= 10
A= 4"
,miknos,2009-10-08T20:49Z,The iLG has the same (horrible) audio. The video is slightly worse tho. I'll get subtitles to see it.
,b.gummer,2009-10-09T18:32Z,"this IS  a dvdrip and a good 1,

can any1 help me create a torrent?

i have tryd and cant find it on here"
,dlarrym,2009-10-10T03:14Z,"Sorry to also chime in with what seems like bitching and moaning but the audio is REALLY BAD. It isn't the bad audio.... the movie was free to me so what the hell right..... WHY was it labeled as 8 Channel.!!!!!!! it is mono and the treble is maxed thru the roof!!!!! I am happy to have this copy, the video is PERFECT!!!! honestly, The audio is so bad it makes it hard to watch.  I saw a CAM version of this a month or so ago and it had bad Audio and Video. If I didn't already know the story from watching the CAM version, I would probably sit through the entire film but I will save it and see if a version with great audio comes around and then splice the good audio into this file. I can't truely complain for it is a free deal but like I said PLEASE, when you post a file just be straight forward about what it is that is being put out here. I don't think that is a big deal to ask as much??? right??? ANYWAY.... I'll check back later to see if a better audio vs comes along."
,dlarrym,2009-10-10T03:21Z,"ONE OTHER THING..... Same complaint... the file for ZOMBIELAND is a TS or CAM.... IT is ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS. IF ANYONE tries to say it isn't is insane.... PLEASE just say it is a TS or a CAM.... it is posted as a DVDrip??? go figure???? At first, I thought it was the movie because you are seeing the world through a cheap hand held video camera.... but after that part was done and the story was now supposed be being seen as a half million dollar PanaVision motion picture camera would see the world but the rest of the movie looks like the hand held video camera part never ends. (If anyone saw CLOVERDALE, they know what I mean... A lot of CLOVERDALE was from peoples video cell phones and hand held video cameras but then you see things NOT from the view of the characters hand held CAM corders.... so PLEASE LABEL THINGS CORRECTLY... L8tr"
,malouphix,2009-10-10T14:31Z,"Why do you say shit like this:

     DUQA-TEAM at 2009-10-07 17:54 CET:
     Absolutely it is PREMIERE DVDRIP

     enjoy it :)

When it's not, same crappy audio as the rest.

Peace out."

QUAULITY IS MAGIC.

,Bainshee,2009-11-02T05:15Z,"V:10 dosent get much better for a 700meg file..

A:1 Dosent get much worse for a 700meg file. I mean it makes it unwatchable.. Just awful."
,dj-test,2009-11-06T12:59Z,"The audio phase is reversed in 3/4 of the film - you can fix this partially by playing the movie in mono.

You can also edit the audio stream and reverse the phase, but I guess we'll get a fixed version (aka proper DVDRip) soon."
