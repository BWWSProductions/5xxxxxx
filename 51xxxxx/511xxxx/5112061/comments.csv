,keosworld,2009-10-07T13:48Z,I only tried with Daemon Tools and Alcohol.
,MadRoyas,2009-10-07T17:57Z,"Sorry I don't understand how to mount the mini image ? Could someone explain please, cheers :) Looking forward to play the game (if good I'll buy it)."
,seanz89,2009-10-07T21:13Z,"ok so i can do setup an mount the image but if i try to play it just says please insert dvd disk

,keosworld,2009-10-08T09:26Z,"I'm using Alcohol 1.9.8 for the moment, i believe i got it from here:  https://isohunt.com/torrent_details/78292125/alcohol?tab=summary.

The mini-image is taken from here, as you can see there you can use the latest Daemon Tools too."
,thovader,2009-10-08T11:18Z,"Does this download works with Vista 64 Bit? I heard that most scaled-down version don't, that's why I'm asking before I download ;) ."
,keosworld,2009-10-08T13:37Z,database error ftw
,keosworld,2009-10-08T13:39Z,"I cannot confirm that it works on 64 bit systems but I'm about to install W7 64bit so if you wait a bit I will tell you, it should work I think."

,MadRoyas,2009-10-08T15:35Z,"Yo man, I'm still blocked at mounting the mini image, I just don't get how you do it from Alcohol 120% cause DT simply won't recognize it, latest versions and all.
Do you have to copy it on a Dvd for it to work ?
Thanks anyway."
,keosworld,2009-10-08T19:13Z,"I just simply mounted the mini-image with latest Alcohol, in Daemon Tools you have to use an virtual IDE drive i think."
,mrFriske,2009-10-09T20:19Z,thank you so much
,mr1black,2009-10-10T00:15Z,"@MadRoyas:
Start daemon tools or alcohol. For daemon, there is a blue icon with lightning on taskbar right.. (for alcohol simillar)
Right click/virtual driver/Set number of virtual drives to 1 or more, if not automatic set.
For that virtual disk (device 0) go to mount; find directory where you downloaded this torrent and set either RISEN mini.mdf or .mds
If you have difficulties - leave the file mounted, restart computer and then try running game."

,keosworld,2009-10-11T22:19Z,"For all the people having difficulties with the mini-image (again the freakin' ""Invalid image file"" message I guess) try the free version of Daemon Tools, not the Pro one: http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon+sptd+md5sum"

,keosworld,2009-10-12T10:54Z,"If your video card is made by nVidia you could try the hot fix posted by d1ablocto, if not, just use the latest Catalyst drivers, I had no texture problems. I suggest you all to update to the latest video drivers."
,MadRoyas,2009-10-12T14:18Z,"Ok it works now thanks to that version of DT.
Cheers a bunch guys :) Now I can enjoy the sweet game. Bless you dude !"

Try using MagicDisc it is better than ISO mounters. This works for me even in Max Payne. All games now are compressed using ISO so just use MagicDisc."

,Venin,2009-12-14T02:11Z,"To those of you still wondering if this torrent is fine: it's fine. Stop hesitating and grab it; grab it while it still has numerous seeds above the numerous leechers.

This torrent contains an .iso file and an .mds mini image file.

Installation Steps:

1) Install Daemon Tools Lite:
http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/download/0b4b99b2e5d41c9f3efcb1137a7cb05e/

2) Open Daemon Tools Lite, and right-click on the icon in your system tray. Click on ""Virtual Devices"" and in its context menu, click on ""Add SCSI Virtual Drive."" This should give you two drives to mount things on.

3) Left-click on the Daemon Tools Lite icon in your system tray, wait for the menu to show up, then click on the first visible drive ""Device 0"" and mount the file ""Risen.iso""

4) Once again, left-click on the Daemon Tools Lite icon in your system tray, wait for the menu to show up, then click on the second visible drive ""Device 1"" and mount the file ""RISEN mini.mds"" (Ignore the file ""RISEN mini.mdf"" as you don't need to mount this one. Daemon Tools Lite by default will not even see the .mdf file, but just in case it shows you both the .mds and the .mdf for some reason, make sure you mount the right one.)

5) If your computer is set to open CD/DVD's with AutoPlay, you'll probably have two windows that have popped up by now because you mounted the two files. Close the second window that popped up, and focus on the first window that popped up when you mounted Risen.iso. It should say something similar to ""Run AUTOSTARTER.EXE"" Click on that and install Risen.

6) Every time you want to run the game, you'll have to make sure you have both ""Risen.iso"" and ""RISEN mini.mds"" mounted, so you don't get an error thing telling you to put in your DVD, so make sure you don't delete these files.

The game is in full English interface and audio. I've been playing all day without any problems, and the game looks great (provided you have the proper system to run it). I will also note that I am playing on Windows 7 without a single problem, in case anyone was wondering if it worked on Win 7. I'm using 32-bit, but I have no doubt that it will work on 64-bit as well.

Have fun."
,ll-Arc-ll,2009-12-17T14:37Z,Thanks Venin. I have Windows 7 64-Bit. I followed your instructions exactly and it works.

This is my first time downloading, and i am have some troble getting this to work. 
I have downloaded: Daemon tools lite and: winzip to open the files. 
I have succesfully installed the game by using winzip. However i am not sure how to use daemon tools. I have tried to mount the mini image, however when i open it with daemon tools it only allows my to see the files wich it contains. what should i do?
Since i have installed the game i have lanched it using daemon tools, but i askes me to inset the DVD. 
Can anybody help me? please?"
,Basmand69,2009-12-24T16:09Z,"i have fixed my former problem by following the exelent guide made by venin, who i would like to thank.

can anybody help me?"
,wtfronsson,2009-12-27T16:02Z,"Only works with daemontools lite, don't bother with anything else. I think this is intentionally coded into daemontools, so they get more ""trusty supporters"" like their website says.

,Rottencore0,2010-01-31T13:39Z,If you can't mount both the MDS and the ISO then you need a new version of Deamon Tools. At least 4.30 I think is the most recent.
