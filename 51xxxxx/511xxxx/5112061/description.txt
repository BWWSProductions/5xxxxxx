After seeing allot of tears from people that could not mount the CLONEDVD image of the game I decided to make a simple ISO with the game kit (nothing is ripped).

So, mount the ISO, install the game, mount the mini image and play.

Update:

Patch the game to version 1.1 (http://games.softpedia.com/progDownload/Risen-Patch-Download-61956.html)

Use the no DVD crack from gamecopyworld
