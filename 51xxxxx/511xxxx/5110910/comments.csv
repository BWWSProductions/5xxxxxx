,fathead71,2009-10-05T11:29Z,"Ok...Go easy on me, I am new to this.  I have a lot of great movies, and over 1000 gigs of music I would like to share, but I do not know how to start a torrent. Also, when I do download something, I move it to a different file, and change the name.  This stops me from being able to help seed, but it is the only way I can get my XBOX360 to find it on my laptop.  Any suggestions on how I can do this, and still seed the download?  I hate to always be leeching."
,kudos2jen,2009-10-05T14:25Z,"fathead...your torrent host will help you with creating torrents, it's easier than you think.
Regarding your files being moved, copy and paste the file then change the name of the new file and leave the old one to seed.  Works for me. "

,fathead71,2009-10-06T23:24Z,"Thanks for the response, Kudos2Jen.  I hate always leeching.  I will start creating torrents soon.  Is there a place to take requests for music.  I have so much.  Many of it very hard to find.  I would love to share them."
