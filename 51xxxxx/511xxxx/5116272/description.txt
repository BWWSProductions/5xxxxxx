Judas Priest, Helstar, Vicious Rumours and Wolf. Try to imagine whatever
associations these names stir in you with a female vocalist. Unusual as it may
sound at first, it's exactly what exceptional vocalist London Wilde and Dave
Starr, wellknown for his bass-work in the aforementioned Vicious Rumours as well
as Laaz Rockit, Destillery and Chastain, do.

Of course pure and uncontaminated US power metal is the name of the game and Mr.
Starr knows how to play it. Riff after powerful riff is blown on to the listener
while Wilde's shrieks soar overhead, overshadowing most male heavy metal singers
in the process. For connoisseurs of the genre it soon becomes obvious that the
duo has created a few really exceptional songs. There however also lies the rub.
While some tracks are close to heavy metal masterpieces, a few others are
completely forgettable altogether. To be blunt, the slightly balladesque moments
of the album bore me and while there are many amazing riffs on it, a fair amount
of filler-riffs have found their way on it as well.
