Here are the complete soundtracks from George Lucas's original three Star Wars films: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.  In MP3 format with composer John Williams conducting the London Symphony Orchestra.  Also the soundtrack from the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, by the same composer.  This is just a test upload so the tracks aren't all properly labeled yet but a track list is included with each set.
