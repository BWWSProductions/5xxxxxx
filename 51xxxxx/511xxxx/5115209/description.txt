Plot

Amistad is the name of a slave ship traveling from Cuba to the U.S. in 1839. It 
is carrying a cargo of Africans who have been sold into slavery in Cuba, taken 
on board, and chained in the cargo hold of the ship. As the ship is crossing 
from Cuba to the U.S., Cinque, who was a tribal leader in Africa, leads a mutiny 
and takes over the ship. They continue to sail, hoping to find help when they 
land. Instead, when they reach the United States, they are imprisoned as runaway 
slaves. They don't speak a word of English, and it seems like they are doomed to 
die for killing their captors when an abolitionist lawyer decides to take their 
case, arguing that they were free citizens of another country and not slaves at 
all. The case finally gets to the Supreme Court, where John Quincy Adams makes 
an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release.
