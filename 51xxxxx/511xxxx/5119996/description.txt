Thanks to the original rippers and encoders. Spread the Virus.

A little heads up, if and/or when The Pirate Bay closes you will still be able
to get classic OnA at M i n i n o v a, or I s o h u n t, or D e m o n o i d. See you there.

P.S.  When The Pirate Bay goes down try the above sites, I won't be going back to re-post the days that were missed.
