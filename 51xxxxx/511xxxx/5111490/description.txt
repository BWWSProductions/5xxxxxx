Drain the Ocean (2009)


Drain the Ocean is a National Geographic special featuring CGI animation of what the planet Earth's ocean floor would look like without water.

Digital ocean mapping and CGI technology vividly illustrate the mountains,plains, canyons and creatures of the deep as never seen before,revealing a world of almost unimaginable scale right here on Earth -

The oceans cover three-quarters of our planet, hiding a whole other world beneath the waves. If we could pull an imaginary plug at the bottom of the sea and, layer by layer, expose the majesty and mystery of what lies beneath, we would be astounded. Discovery Channel presents DRAIN THE OCEAN, a new landmark two-hour special, which reveals the longest mountain range (65,000 kilometres!); the deepest point on Earth; the largest stretch of flat plains; and psychedelic bioluminescent life forms that look like Hollywood aliens. 

Narrated by Avery Brooks (STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE) and combining the latest scientific data with state-of-the-art CGI computer hardware plus specially written software, this innovative and visually striking special drains the water from the oceans to reveal the mountains, canyons, plains and volcanoes that are more dramatic than anything visible on dry land.
