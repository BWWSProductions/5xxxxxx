Django Reinhardt - I Got Rhythm Two Disc Set

Forty Four Tracks of Django Reinhardt's Amazing and utterly unique jazz guitar styling. He only had two fingers on his left hand you know. Many tracks Feat. StÃ©phane Grappelli, the violin player. 

If you have not heard of Mr. Reinhardt, you are in for a treat. If you do not like jazz, I challenge you to listen to this and not like it!

Ripped to mp3 & can't recall what bitrate It was encoded at, as I ripped it a while ago, not that It really makes a world of difference in my humble opinion.

Enjoy, seed, and burn for all your friends. Spread the gospel of Django!
