House M.D. S06E02 - Epic Fail (2009)

House returns home to Princeton where he continues to focus on his recovery,
but surprises Cuddy with the news that he's making a big change in his life.
Meanwhile, the team is unable to diagnose a loud-mouthed video game creator who
posts each new symptom on the internet and opts for treatments suggested by the
online community rather than by the doctors, and Foreman angles for House's
job, but the pressure to solve the case creates tension in his relationship
with Thirteen.
