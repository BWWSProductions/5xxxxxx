or 6x03 The Tyrant ?"
,colemar,2009-10-05T12:33Z,"It is Epic Fail, as stated in the torrent title.
The Tyrant is scheduled to be aired tonight (october 5), and I live in Italy therefore I can't have it until posted somewhere.

There is some confusion as some people tag this one as episode 2 (Broken being the episode 1), but Fox TV refers to Broken as a double episode (01-02) and to Epic Fail as being episode 3."
,Ind0,2009-10-06T11:50Z,"People thought Broken was a double episode, it was just an extended one. Thus, this is in fact S06E02 - Epic Fail. (Search wiki or even Fox for the episode list in case you don't believe me.)"
,colemar,2009-10-06T15:12Z,"Wikies are basically words from the crowd, not something to rely to.
housewiki.fox.com lists ""603: Epic Fail"", while en.wikipedia.org has ""113 (6-03) Epic Fail"". 

www.fox.com has ""Epic Fail (HD), Season 6: Ep 2"".

I guess I have to correct the torrent title."
