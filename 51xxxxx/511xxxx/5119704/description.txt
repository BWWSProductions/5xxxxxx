This compilation DVD contains some very rare clips. Some from the net and some from old VHS cassettes. Made this for some of my rockinÂ´ friends a while ago. Maybe some of you out there also will enjoy some real music. Guaranteed free from Hip hop and disco crap. Some of the videos are of low quality picture wise ( some of these old TV recordings had that quality when they were broadcasted ), but the sound is ok.

Request: If any one out there has the DVD with Bob Luman at Town Hall Party I would appreciate if you could put it up here on TPB. Have searched on nearly all of the torrentsites but itÂ´s nowhere to be found.

     
Please write an comment what you think of this compilation. Custom DVD cover is in the torrent ( I hope, if not tell me about it so will I upload that separate )
