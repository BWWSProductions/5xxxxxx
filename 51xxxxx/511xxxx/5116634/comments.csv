,iznissin,2010-02-28T05:40Z,"okay, so in order to get the serial, you have to download iSerial Reader, once you got the program, open the Serial Box 09-2009.sb2 file. The iSerial Reader will ask if you want to install the file, click yes, then it will show a whole bunch of serials for all types of Mac program. Type Sketchbook Pro in search bar, and you will find the serial. "
