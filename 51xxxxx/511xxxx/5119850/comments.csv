,zeppelinmad4,2009-10-11T15:06Z,I just remembered that most people do not want you to convert to mp3 and share the bootlegs.  If you take any offense or have a problem with this torrent let me know and I will remove it.  It took me a really long time to write that damn info file so I'll leave it up.
,Imperator42,2010-06-05T08:36Z,You got Burn Like A Candle (June 25 1972) anywhere?
,jags87,2011-02-01T22:55Z,"Long time ago I lost my password for zeppelinmad4 and wasnt able to recover it so I had to create a new username and forgot all about this torrent.
@Imperator42: I'm sure I do. I'll do some digging around."
,Imperator42,2011-02-11T02:38Z,"cool; thanks for the eventual reply.
The only version of Burn Like a Candle I found elsewhere was merely a partial version of that show; I'll also look around."
