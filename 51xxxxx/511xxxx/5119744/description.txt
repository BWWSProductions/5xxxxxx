About Notes from the Otherground

Notes from the Otherground is an experiment in spacious audio design, produced during a project trip to Berlin in the fall and winter of 2008/2009. The entire album is a work of Rasmus Thofte, founder of Otherground Project Group. Being a true fan of both traveling and working within the field of art, Rasmus has devoted his time in developing a way to do both at the same time. 

Notes from the Otherground is the first of an upcoming series of artworks, each being produced on a different location in the world. Given the character of abstract and electroish visions prior to the production, Rasmus decided the whole development of the production should take place in the melting pot of modern electronic music: Berlin, Germany. Said and done, Rasmus moved, along with his studio gear, from Stockholm to NeukÃ¶lln in order to start the process of creation. 	
Seven months later, the final mix of Notes from the Otherground was sent to Stockholm for mastering and print, which was carried out by LjudteknikerbyrÃ¥n in Playyard Studios, Stockholm.
