She Wolf is the third English studio album by Colombian Latin-pop singer-songwriter Shakira, scheduled for release on October 9, 2009, in Germany through Sony Music, October 12 in the UK and France through RCA Records and Jive Epic Records, respectively, before being released sometime in November by Epic Records in the US.

So far it is known that Shakira has worked hip-hop producers Pharrell Williams, John Hill, and Wyclef Jean who was involved in producing her previous worldwide hit "Hips Don't Lie". The album sees Shakira shift from latin pop and pop-rock to electro pop while also exploring dancehall.

The album's lead single is also called "She Wolf" in English-speaking territories and is currently making its premier worldwide. A Spanish version of the song titled "Loba" is being released in Latin America and Spain to promote the album. Representatives from Epic Records appear to have confirmed that "Did It Again" will be released as the second single.
