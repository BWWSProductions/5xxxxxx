I just got home and had a look on here and saw this, cool!  Now this album I do wanna download, shall grab it at some point tonight cos I think Shakira is one sexy babe.  She is super sexy!  I've gotta hear her new one, I do like that She Wolf song, it's a pretty catchy one.  Another fine quality upload from Mr Bubanee :-)"

[T],SpandauBaby,2009-11-19T00:39Z,"Hi Bubanee,  just thought I'd say another hello.  To be honest with you I'm a bit bored at the moment, also having sleep problems these last 2 nights, can't get to bloody sleep at night lol oh well :-(  Yeah anyway besides, it's good to see you have many torrents going at the moment.  You've got bloody loads of em haha!  Yeah unfortunately those Now ones I did got completely flushed out of the top 100.  I watched them go down over the period of weeks they did.  They seemed to do pretty well.  Got some good positive feedback from people.  Yeah I like it when people say good stuff, it's nice to hear good constructive comments.  My latest ones are doing well now, got all that weird rock stuff going and many downloaders are coming along.  Maybe not in the top 100 but still they've become quite popular so I guess that many people are listening to this weird stuff now.  I've already made just over 25 gigs so far, it's been hard work.  It takes a lot of time especially the tagging of each mp3 but I've deviced a system which I work to now.  It's good when people appreciate what you've done for them.  I'm just so impressed with how many good torrents you've got going at the moment.  This Shakira album is pretty good, no wonder it's popular.  I saw her on a UK television programme the other day called X Factor you probably know it.  She performed one of the new ones from this album and she was good, I thought better than Britney Spears, I've heard Britney has gone very downhill recently and that she don't even sing live anymore.  She's losing fans according to what I've read cause people are just giving up on her, shame really.  I hope I get to sleep tonight lol I'm becoming a night person and I want to sleep during the day but have to get up for work so it's a bit of a problem lol :-)"
,gsturmer,2009-11-19T17:51Z,how do you download it ???
[V],bubanee,2009-11-21T10:10Z,spandaubaby.. soz for late reply.. yeah the torrents i make OMG i think i have set the bar to high for myself.. but at least there going good though.. i always thought once michael torrent left that was the end of me.. i don't really look at the top 100 much anymore but the day i did i saw black eye peas at back at no.1 WTF that should of been dead and dusted ages ago. i'm actually starting to get sick of uploading myself at first it was all a game of me shit stiring which nearly got me ended early at the other site until the person i call now my silent partner pulled my head in. the one and only thing that keeps me going now is i feel i owe the public 'bubanee' and his uploads.. talk about the 3rd person hehe.. as for britney oh down here in OZ there on to her and her miming.. on stage she looks half pissed from what i have seen on the tele.. those now torrents will come alive when the next edition comes out.. mark my words it ain't over yet my friend.. the day it gets released.. go over there and delete them all and put them back up with the new ones that will flood the torrent world. i couldn imagine 25gb of tagging that's unreal matey. that's commitment whoa! at mo i'm making an 1980's collection slowly not big in your standards just 100songs or so.. you know something for me.. that won't do any good for top 100 i actually forgot about myself hehe.. take care buddy good to here from ya hey! again sorry about late reply...

,infocom4ever,2009-11-26T20:20Z,Decent colombians chainsaw you in the bathtub but this one keeps tormenting you for ever with her lie detecting bodyparts. tjack hora! tjack hora!    
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-11-27T19:14Z,"bubanee, it is a sad day today.  I have seen just before about an hour ago what has happened to Mininova and that the torrents have gone!  Very sad day indeed, I was hoping that site would be there for a while but I guess not :-(  All my torrents have been removed and I presume that yours have the same.  What now exactly?  Any suggestions, the question is what sites should we put them onto now apart from this one if we're using announce URLs like that genesis one and openbittorrent.com?  Just curious to hear what you say now regarding the fact that Mininova has been forced to remove all the users torrents..."
