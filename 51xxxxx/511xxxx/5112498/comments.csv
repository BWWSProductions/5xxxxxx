,hellcat71,2009-10-12T07:43Z,so question. How do you get the .001 file to extract? what program? i tried winzip winrar and winace. onoe recognize the .001 file ext.
,Arxidis,2009-10-14T04:55Z,I use 1920x1080 monitor. I can't get the game to have any sound and ALSO I can't get the game to STICK to 1920x1080 @ 60hz. Every time I initiate it it begins with 1920x1080 @ 25hz thus the screen is trembling a bit. What's wrong with this? And where is the sound??? I have an ATI x1950xtx.
,pickanick,2009-10-14T14:50Z,"ok, so, i am sorry if i'm being an idiot, but i just woke up.  i joined all the files using a joining program... (hjsplit).  it spits out an extensionless file, which i renamed to a rar.  winrar opens it, and sees a .iso file, but when i try to extract it says i need more .rar libraries.  (.r00, .ro1, etc.)...

how do i get those .001 files to turn into rar libraries, and not just a single rar with 1/5 of the information?"
,pickanick,2009-10-14T15:02Z,sorry.  just use winrar or 7zip to extract the .001 files.  don't join them first.
,delboy1972,2009-10-26T09:08Z,will not install on vista 64
,LetsRockit01234,2009-11-01T19:20Z,Use 7zip to extract. Just right click on the 001 file and 7zip and extract here. I usually don't see this without a .rar file but it works. Thanks
,LetsRockit01234,2009-11-01T20:27Z,"ok how do you un-rar this? there should be a .rar, r00, r01... files. How are you guys putting this together to make an ISO file?"
,Donijs,2009-11-23T11:29Z,"to make an ISO file:
1. choose to open file 001 with winrar
2.when you have opened the file with winrar there should be another winrar file in, choose extract to specific folder.
3.after you extracted, in folder that you choosed should be another winrar file you can extract it there or put it in virtual cd 
4.instal it"

,mlech,2012-04-03T16:48Z,"After installing this game and copying in the crack I was asked for a windows live account to be able to save games. I clicked to create a new one, then scrolled to the bottom of the page to find the 'local profile' option.  This allows game saving, though not achievements. No game key or internet connection required.  Thanks and hope this helps others"
