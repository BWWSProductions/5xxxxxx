Nobody, it's all in service of Dorkins arrogant egoism. "
,gdarabic,2009-10-10T07:06Z,The funny thing Boolavogue is that by releasing this epub you are only making sure more people read his book and as a side effect go to his website. He already has his money and isn't going to hurt any bit by releasing this. Thanks though for helping to promote him. LOL.  
,JebusKryst,2009-10-10T14:26Z,Cool. I've already got the hardback but its too heavy to carry to work. This is perfect. Now I need to figure out how to get it onto by ipod touch....
