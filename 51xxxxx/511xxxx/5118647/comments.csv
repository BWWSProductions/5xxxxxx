I know how easy it is to make things look like something. They do it all the time. in the media, and also in conspiracymovies. Think for yourself. And movies like these just make me feel that there are a lot of people who make it their life's purpose to bring powerfull people down, no matter how good the intentions of those people are. This seems just another movie in the same legacy, and I think it's time we did our own research and our own thinking, but with an OPEN mind! Don't let anyone poison you with false proof of anything, be it conspiracy fans or government, or media and commercials, or anything or anyone else. Look for THE truth, not just the 'truth' that makes you feel better."
