As the last millennium dawned, Europe didn't amount to much.

Illiteracy, starvation, and disease were the norm.

In fact, Europe in the year 1000 was one of the world's more stagnant regionsÃ¢â‚¬â€an economically undeveloped, intellectually derivative, and geopolitically passive backwater.

Three short centuries later, all this had changed dramatically. A newly invigorated cluster of European societies revived city life, spawned new spiritual and intellectual movements and educational institutions, and began, for reasons both sacred and profane, to expand at the expense of neighbors who traditionally had expanded at Europe's expense.
