Kasabian - Saracuse (320kbps mp3s)

For the Very First Time...

COME BACK DOWN - Original Acoustic version 1999
COME BACK DOWN - Band Version: 2000
COME BACK DOWN - Bedrock Experimental mix: 2001


The original Demos that got Kasabian a record deal!

Track included is 'COME BACK DOWN' - The Legacy:
Listen to when the track was first written in the studio, then recorded 6 months later with the band, and finally a beat box version representing early loops (experimental) that would lead to Processed beats. The final version of Come Back Down was the track that finally made record labels pay attention...


Recorded at Bedrock Leicester. produced by Scott Gilbert & Chris Edwards.


"I remember Chris and I miking up all the kit for the 3rd after work (free for mates) recording session. The drummer was late, so I set up a few microphones around the room and recorded Serge hammering away on his acoustic guitar and singing. Everything was recorded straight on to DAT. We finished up with about 12 songs. A live audio notepad of rough song ideas, brilliant" - Scott Gilbert
