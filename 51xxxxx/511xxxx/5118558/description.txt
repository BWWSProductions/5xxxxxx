Strange Police Encounters

Date: 10-08-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Ingrid Dean, Michael Teitelbaum

A detective sergeant, forensic artist, and 20-yr. police veteran in the Michigan State Police, Ingrid P. Dean shared stories from the front lines of law enforcement which were shaped by angels and apparitions, dreams and intuition, signs, and unexplainable phenomena. By being open to the occasional gut instincts and/or divine guidance, police officers are sometimes able to make life-saving decisions in the crucial moment, she explained, recounting an incident where she saved a boy who was going into shock from a bee sting. Dean also told of an intriguing case involving a wildlife officer who lost his badge in the woods. Just before reporting it as missing, he ran across an unoccupied eagle's nest, and there mixed inside the twigs was his badge.

During the evening, several police officers gave their first hand testimony of unusual cases. Officer Steve spoke about a 1992 incident in which he stopped a car that ran a red light. The driver of the stopped vehicle began firing a barrage of bullets from an automatic weapon, and Ofc. Steve became pinned inside his squad car. Just after his windshield exploded, his car filled with a golden light, and he heard a voice say 'you will not be harmed,' and saw a golden transparent shield forming "before my eyes." Shortly after that, back-up arrived and the gunman was apprehended.

Officer Lawrence described a case he investigated in the mid-1970s, the apparent gunshot suicide of a teenage boy. But during a dream he had, it came to him that the gun went off when the boy was cleaning the weapon. This was later borne out in the evidence, and there was some consolation to the family that it was not a suicide, he said.

Paranormal Tales

Last hour guest, author Michael Teitelbaum recounted scary tales of the paranormal gathered from different American states. In California, a boy encountered a Shadow Person in his garage, a human-shaped figure made of black mist. The boy was momentarily paralyzed until the being vanished, he detailed. In Ohio, a girl went down to the basement and saw items in disarray, and heard a voice say "get out!" When she returned with her parents, moments later, the items were all returned to their place.
