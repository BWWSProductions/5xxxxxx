Install to the root of a drive( C:, D:). Enjoy!

If you get an error in EH saying: "An unsupported operation was attempted" then run
Radar10/autoreg.exe
once.

if you have a problem in full repertory mode and do not see Murphy 3 and SE92,

install update 30:  
http://www.archibel-ftp.com/~public/RadarLiveUpdate/RADARLiveUpdate1000030.exe


then unpack this archive in Radar10/bin :  
http://tinurl.com/63wo2u

add a y after tin in the above url

If you want radar to load murphy and se92 at startup add this to the link property Target: mue300 SE92, ex:

C:/RADAR10/BIN/radar.exe mue300 se92


also unpack this zip inside RADAR10/SYSTEM/ if you want to have an easier time finding the available repertories, as all non available names are replace with spaces:  
http://tinurl.com/6eykrt

add a y after tin in the above url
