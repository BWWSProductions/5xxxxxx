,DirtRich,2011-09-22T23:29Z,Most of the episodes are hard-subbed in Swedish.  I HATE hard-coded subs!  Why do people do that?  Ruins the torrent.
,grama_lama,2012-01-17T01:16Z,hmm? could be handy if you only speak Swedish.  
,zaroba,2012-04-02T19:32Z,"nice collection.  but you have 3 different shows.

You've mixed:
Junkyard Wars (UK) - which had 11 Seasons
Scrapheap Challenge (US) - which had 5 seasons
Junkyard Mega Wars (UK) - Which was only 2 seasons"

Thanks heaps, err torrents. :)"
