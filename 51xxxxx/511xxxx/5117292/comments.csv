It's just another spam site that requires you to register and sells your data.. and I think the uploaded makes money each time someone clicks on the link.  It's a shame users must be teases with a SINGLE comic with the promise of more... 

Well, in any case, thanks uploader for this upload, even though it's an old issue that's been uploaded a long time ago already."
