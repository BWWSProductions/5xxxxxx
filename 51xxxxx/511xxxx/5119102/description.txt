This is a group release (sorry, can't remember which), with latin american spanish audio.

You don't see these often, so I was wondering how popular it would be.

If you lack patience, refrain from downloading until there are several seeds, as my line is slow.

By the way, it's AC3 audio from a DVD source, not a shitty rip.
