[V],godcanjudgeme,2009-10-11T06:32Z,"Hi the_guttersnipe,

the .txt file is missing from the uploaded file.
If you have the text file, you can drop it into the ""Noam Chomsky in Palo Alto"" file and continue seeding - all of the folks stuck at 99.9% will suddenly become seeds.

If not it makes no great difference, the AVI and MP3 work perfectly well on their own.

More importantly - Great Upload !!
Thankyou for sharing!
Looks like you had the best seat in the house."
