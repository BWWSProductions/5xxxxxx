[T],shuazien,2009-10-09T17:39Z,"I've had a pretty rotten week as well. Every morning this week I wake up and no connection to the intertubes. My network is fine (I can see and connect to all the other PC's on it) but no interwebs... Comcast will be here later to replace the modem, hopefully that will do the trick.

blah blah blah bla blah bkah........ i know....."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-10-09T18:11Z,"Damn, show went till almost 11:30 today! Encoding the 64k now, should be up inside of 30 minutes or so. 128k is gonna have to wait till tonight again, as yes - even more crap has been piled on me today. Is it the weekend yet?!"
