This is the album that changed my music direction in a big way and almost got me obsessed about neil young.There are only a few artist's that pull off "The Unplugged" idea as well as Mr Young.
Sixty five minutes worth from a music maverick,who on this recording manages to outshine most of his studio work with unbelievable harmonica playing on the sinster,unfamiliar "Mr Soul" and often accompanying himself on acoustic guitar to great effect, the standout track for me is the pump organ accompanied "Like a Hurricane" which is just heart stopping in it's beauty and execution.
A must have in any music fan's collection.You will find yourself going back to hear this album over and over...it really is like a hurricane....  ESSENTIAL.....
