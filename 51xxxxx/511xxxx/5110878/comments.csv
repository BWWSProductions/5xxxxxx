,MobiusVortex,2009-10-08T09:33Z,"sweet!!  all the keys actually work for KIS 9.  use the very top one: Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 Key By subhy259 (1).key 

that has the latest exp date of 1.22.10"
,MobiusVortex,2009-10-09T21:07Z,"damn, the key did work and then it got blocked today.  all the keys are now blocked!  i gave the trial reset a chance.  yeah it's russian, but i just tried all 3 buttons. i think the left button is the one to reset."
,an.an,2009-10-09T23:32Z,"works. thanks! 
Use the left button to reset"

,soulp0wer,2009-10-11T08:29Z,"do anyone have the REGISTRY FILE for trial reset for Kaspersky 2010?

that method is safer compared to .EXE applications.

,McVilly,2009-10-11T17:40Z,"Left button is Reset (you need administrator rights)
Down button is exit
Right button is ""about program""


And Fail, educate yourselfe. There ARE others language in the world beside English, and people actually speak it.

If it stills bothers you... Well, since you showed unlimited intellectual capacities in your post, why don't you make you're own crack in English?"
,oicnev,2009-11-27T21:39Z,"One good thing about it being in Russian though is that, well, at least so far, Kaspersky has not been able to detect and block it as malware or something.  And in that sense, at least for me, its perfect, coz I didn't anymore have to encrypt [winrar] and password-protect it to protect it against kaspersky."
,oicnev,2009-11-27T21:42Z,"Shoot! Now, it got detected.. So, disregard my earlier comment.."
