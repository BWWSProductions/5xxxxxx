,s3x.m4ch1n3,2009-10-10T19:04Z,"Thats cool, hopefully you meant saturday?

Maybe you should lower the upload slots as well, since we're all stuck around 30%"
,s3x.m4ch1n3,2009-10-10T22:08Z,"Maybe you should have warned people you only have 7Kb/s upload speed, and that it will take 3 days to seed it?"
,LocoZee,2009-10-10T23:12Z,"Don't complain, I know what I'm doing...
Piratebay is not a priority, too many hit and runners, and asshats complaining in the comments.

Theres the seed, I would have added it faster had there been one comment saying ""thanks""."

like Romancing sara or bound in stockings...
