Joy is Canadian singer-songwriter Fefe Dobson's third studio album but only her sophomore release. This is because her second album, Sunday Love was not released. Joy is scheduled for a late October/Fall 2009 release. 

After parting ways with her previous label, Island Records, Fefe Dobson decided to go back to her roots and create a new album on her own terms. She said in an April 2007 interview that her new efforts were coming along nicely and should see the light of day sooner than later.

In early 2008 a new song, "Watch Me Move" was heard in promos for the NBC show, Lipstick Jungle. It was also used as the Title theme for comedian Margaret Cho's The Cho Show. "Watch Me Move" was released as a Digital download on September 9, 2008. In an interview in January 2009, Dobson said that "Watch Me Move" was a "teaser to what's to come" and hinted that the first single and promotional video will be released soon and will have a "soft rock vibe".

A song was posted by Dobson in February 2009, titled "I Want You". The song was featured on her official website for a time, and is now on her imeem. In April 2009, Dobson released a video blog of updates, stating that her album is finally complete, and that it should be available soon. In May 2009, she posted a mix of both "Watch Me Move" and "I Want You", entitled "I Want You 2 Watch Me Move" on her imeem, MySpace, and official website. Dobson confirmed that the song is the first official single from her upcoming album, Joy. She has posted on her Fefe Dobson Official Facebook page that Joy is scheduled for a late October 2009 release. A music video was shot for the single on May 23, 2009. Photos from the video shoot were subsequently released by MuchMusic. Dobson officially released "I Want You" as a digital download on July 3, 2009. The song is featured  in promos for the VH1 show, Megan Wants a Millionaire. On August 5, 2009 the video premiered on MTV, The N, and LOGO. It consists of four incarnations, the individual songs of "I Want You", "Watch Me Move", "I Want You Remix" and a combination titled "I Want You 2 Watch Me Move."
