,PROTEOUS1,2011-09-17T06:56Z,"Apparently you can't use this without the iDeneb Upgrade tool 10.5.7, which is harder to find than chicken teeth. However I have both and they work like a charm on ALL iWhatever disks! Got Leopard working just fine on AMD 64 X2 6000+ Dual Core Processor and updated with them no problem. Soon as I can figure out how to upload Iwill. Both I have are Combo Update packs . THE 10.5.7 one is available on D______.me under iDeneb 10.5.7 Upgrade  good luck and seed like hell when you get them because they are dissappearing like ice in the sun. P.S. GO WITH Leopard because Snow Leopard and Lion are shitbags .I've got both and no way are they gonna let you use all the software you already payed blood for!"
