Good movie. I think some of the characters could have been skipped to give more room for the remaining. But overall I really enjoyed it. Hope you at least break even financially and looking forward to coming projects."

,spamme.aaa,2009-10-11T23:10Z,"Trailern var grym, men jag kom faktiskt aldrig riktigt in i själva filmen. Jag tyckte storyn var väldigt spretig, och den skulle nog mått bra av att stryka en eller ett par av historierna. Kan ha varit att jag tittade på den med helt fel förväntningar, eller i fel sinnesstämning (många filmer jag har helt olika betyg på första och andra gången jag såg dem). 

Men jag hoppas verkligen att det blir succé i vilket fall som helst. Jag tror och hoppas nämligen att det här sättet distribuera film är framtiden."

Will you tell your story to people in the US so others can learn how to make a quality movie without Hollywood?

From script to torrent and every step in between.

The stories we choose to tell and repeat become the legacy of our time, and should never be left to solely commercial interests.

They should be quality stories that make you think, feel, laugh, wonder and perhaps learn something.  They should ask something from the viewer, an investment of time & thought & emotion, to question something inside, to give something to leave the viewer enriched that we take with us forever, not merely entertained during the story and cast aside."

I really like this method of distribution! I strongly encourage more people to do this!

I have made several movie length political videos. Most them are about Latin America and the events their. They are posted right here on TPB and freely available to all, of course!

Note: While this may seem partly like an advertisement, it is not. This is the model of how I share my work with others. I encourage you, the reader, to do the same.

If you watch my videos, you will see an advertisement for TPB right in my videos! I also encourage the viewers of my work IN MY VIDEOS, yo do what I am doing. To create content and post it right here on TPB!

THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF THE MPAA, RIAA, ETC. IS TO ***BOYCOTT*** THEM!!! DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!

If you want to support artists who are on RIAA labels, buy their concert tickets! They get much more of a percentage that way, or just simply give them money directly. But, no matter what you do, KEEP THE BIG MEDIA COMPANIES OUT OF THE CASH LOOP!!!!


For my own work, I don't release under copyright. I pretty much despise copyright law. I feel that patents and copyright impede the free flow of information and ideals. I believe that as a society, most of us have been indoctrinated to be selfish with ""our"" information... to be possessive of it. Selfishness is the fundamental issue behind copyright. Selfishness is a fundamental Capitalist ideal. Mainly, I try to practice what I preach.

So, to fully help get the information that I videotape out to the people, I only release my work under ""Kopimi"" license. It is basically like releasing material into the public domain. People can use material in any way, without restrictions. They may create derivative works, copy, sell, distribute... or paste a snapshot of a frame from the video on the side of a large building and get paid to do that. I don't care.

The main idea is to have as many people as possible learn something from the information without any interference from copyright interference.

Please read about the ""Kopimi"" here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopimi#Kopimi

It is essential for knowledge to reach everyone. Copyright generally restricts the flow of information to only those who can afford its purchase. If it weren't for those socialist public libraries and schools, just think of how many people would be deprived of most knowledge about anything beyond their common interactions with their routine daily environments.

I happen to operate a professional, dedicated torrent server located here.

http://mynetblog.com/media/torrents/

I want to host your LEFTIST, POLITICAL media! (Original works, no copyrights, etc. I'm in the U.S. so I have to follow the retarded copyright laws.)

Media for the PEOPLE, not media for the rich!

We are in the middle of transferring over to our new server from our old server... So, not everything is working yet. However, we should have some way for you to get us your torrents to seed on our server.

Remember, this is not a torrent server for entertainment. This is a torrent server for SERIOUS political media! We are living in serious times and I am SERIOUS about people knowing the truth!!!

Read this please... it is GREAT!!!!

Hanna Sköld, Director

Little by little, Nasty Old People is more and more available to the world! People are being engaged in many ways: André Roegglenis is right now translating the subs into German, Martin Vives into Spanish and Anthony Nordström into Swedish for hearing impaired. Thank you a thousand times! We really love it when you guys take part in the process, in one way or another, and once again I´m convinced that the future is all about doing things together!

Very soon there will be some graphics showing what happens on the donation account, but till then I?ll keep you updated with numbers. Right now we have received almost 12 000 SEK (1 200 EUR)! This is truly amazing to me and to all of us who worked with Nasty Old People! And all of this in just three days!

I know some of you request higher resolution and there will soon be an ISO-file for DVD uploaded on the Pirate Bay. I also need you to keep in mind that we´re still just a few working with this for free, and because of that we don´t have the capability to do all we want in the speed we would like to. But hang in there, keep the world updated, and build the new future for film together with us!

With love

Hanna"

Jag grät så jag skakade, jag skrattade och log.
Underbart otroligt.
Att så mycket kan sägas i en enda film.
Det finns inte ord. Att så mycket... ja. Tack!"

,xcon3k,2009-10-14T12:52Z,"Hi, sorry but gotta write this.. This was a big waste of download time and utter crap. Sorry but it was a waste of an hour or so.

TPB should find something interesting or decent to endorse to be honest..."

,Macoco,2009-10-15T12:02Z,"my rating is 2 of 5, quality is top, but I guess it wasn't my kind of movie, yes as I was thrilled about the way of distribution, I think it's worth donating to creators :)"

Nasty Old People on tour!

Now Nasty Old People have its own life on the internet, but the plans of going on a tour around the world is still as strong as before. We´re convinced there is a big value in the direct meeting between humans, even though Internet of course is a fantastic place for people to meet and interact!

This is why I now would like to invite you all to write to us if you want us to come to your town and show Nasty Old People (e-mail hanna@tangramfilm.se). It might be at a club, a theater, a cinema or at other places you suggest!  Right now it´s too cold, (at least in Sweden), to show the film outdoors, it´s freezing here, brrr!!  But as soon as it gets warmer we´ll show the film on facades! At the live-screenings the audience will be able to donate an optional amount according to the same principles as on the web, and I hope the tour (travel expenses etc.) will finance itself this way!

So far we have booked live-screenings in Lund, Gothenburg and Stockholm:

Gothenburg, the free film festival at Hagabion Nov 7th

Lund, Kino Södra Nov 26th

Gothenburg, Hagabion, Window for independent filmmakers. Nov 27th - Dec.4th (and maybe longer)

Stockholm, BioRio at Hornstull Dec 2nd, 5th and 6th

See you there!!

Next time I´ll write something about all the great things we have
discovered when we released  Nasty Old People on The Pirate Bay.

Love
Hanna "

The concept of paying based on entertainment value is working for me.

Quite the boring movie tho, no matter what  the reviews say.."
,subzeb,2009-12-04T17:38Z,Nice movie - reminds me a bit of Amelie of Monmatre. And I really like the way it's being distributed- hopefully will give fair donation after watching it - so more people will get encouraged to the DIY-model.
