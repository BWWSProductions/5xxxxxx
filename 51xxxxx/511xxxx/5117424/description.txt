NASTY OLD PEOPLE

This is Mette's story. Member of a neo-Nazi gang, her day job is to take care of four seniors that all are just waiting to die. Her life becomes a journey into a burlesque fairytale, where the rules of the game are created by Mette herself. Mette is indifferent about her way of life, until she one night assaults a man, kicking him senseless. Waking up the day after, she realizes that something is wrong, and accompanied by the crazy oldies, she longs for respect and love. Together, they create a world of their own. A world you never knew existed. 
==================================================================

BEHIND THE SCENES
In the autumn of 2007 Hanna SkÃ¶ld took a private bank loan of 10 000 euro to make her debut feature film "Nasty Old People". Now she continues to ignore the middle men in the film industry by distributing it together with the film collective RÃ¥FILMâ€™s Luffarbion, aka Vagabond Cinema, and the file sharing site The Pirate Bay. In addition, she releases it under a creative commons license so that anyone can download, share or remix the film.

This is so amazing, so many emotions! ItÂ´s difficult to find the right words...

by all the kind words and support from you guys, from all over the world!

A million thanks to all of you who seed and donate, and to the Pirate Bay!

Today, once again, I found out that when you do what you believe in - amazing things can happen!

Keep seeding and spread the word!

IÂ´m happy today, very happy to let you all know that we so far have received about 8000 SEK (800 EUR). This is amazing and covers almost 10 percent of the bank loan I took to make this film come true. And this has happened in just two days! It would be a thrill to reach 20 percent by tomorrow, so keep seeding and spread the word around the world!

I also want you to know that we now have the subtitles in Portuguese by Bruno Marcuche, and I keep getting requests from people who wants to organize live-premiers all over the world!

Portuguese subs here:

So! When do I get to see the first remix of Nasty Old People???

Little by little, Nasty Old People is more and more available to the world! People are being engaged in many ways: AndrÃ© Roegglenis is right now translating the subs into German, Martin Vives into Spanish and Anthony NordstrÃ¶m into Swedish for hearing impaired. Thank you a thousand times! We really love it when you guys take part in the process, in one way or another, and once again IÂ´m convinced that the future is all about doing things together!

Very soon there will be some graphics showing what happens on the donation account, but till then Iâ€™ll keep you updated with numbers. Right now we have received almost 12 000 SEK (1 200 EUR)! This is truly amazing to me and to all of us who worked with Nasty Old People! And all of this in just three days!

I know some of you request higher resolution and there will soon be an ISO-file for DVD uploaded on the Pirate Bay. I also need you to keep in mind that weÂ´re still just a few working with this for free, and because of that we donÂ´t have the capability to do all we want in the speed we would like to. But hang in there, keep the world updated, and
build the new future for film together with us!

With love

Hanna

Nasty Old People on tour!

Now Nasty Old People have its own life on the internet, but the plans of going on a tour around the world is still as strong as before. WeÂ´re convinced there is a big value in the direct meeting between humans, even though Internet of course is a fantastic place for people to meet and interact!

This is why I now would like to invite you all to write to us if you want us to come to your town and show Nasty Old People (e-mail hanna@tangramfilm.se). It might be at a club, a theater, a cinema or at other places you suggest!  Right now itÂ´s too cold, (at least in Sweden), to show the film outdoors, itÂ´s freezing here, brrr!!  But as soon as it gets warmer weÂ´ll show the film on facades! At the live-screenings the audience will be able to donate an optional amount according to the same principles as on the web, and I hope the tour (travel expenses etc.) will finance itself this way!

So far we have booked live-screenings in Lund, Gothenburg and Stockholm:

Gothenburg, the free film festival at Hagabion Nov 7th

Lund, Kino SÃ¶dra Nov 26th

Gothenburg, Hagabion, Window for independent filmmakers. Nov 27th - Dec.4th (and maybe longer)

Stockholm, BioRio at Hornstull Dec 2nd, 5th and 6th

See you there!!

Next time IÂ´ll write something about all the great things we have
discovered when we released  Nasty Old People on The Pirate Bay.

Love
Hanna
