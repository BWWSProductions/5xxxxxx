,ZanpakutoUnleased,2011-01-25T17:26Z,"Strange this Episode is formatted as undf. not sure what happened but the entire file size appears to be 20-40 MiB short of almost every bleach episode soagg has uploaded, Am I the only one experiencing issues with this episode? Also why upload complete seasons up until season 7, then take the time to upload individual episodes but not as one file?? Just curious.....Thanks."
