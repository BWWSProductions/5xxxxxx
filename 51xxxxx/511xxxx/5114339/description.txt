Tantra - Being an Instrument of Life -- Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev

Tantra - what used to be a whole spiritual path, has been abused and misunderstood to be mere unbridled promiscuity, especially in the West. 
In Tantra - Being an Instrument of Life, Sadhguru redefines tantra, restoring it to its original scope and dimension as an ancient technology for ultimate transformation.
