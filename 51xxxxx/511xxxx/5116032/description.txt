Tiger Island (2007)

Home to Britain's largest collection of tigers, this award winning zoo has been a dedicated ally to the tiger for over a quarter of a century. The Zoo also cares for a wide range of other animals including lions, leopards, jaguars, lemurs, monkeys, snakes, spiders and lizards. All our animals are housed in a wide variety of naturalistic enclosures that encourage them to display their natural behaviours.

On an island lying off the coast of the South of England and measuring just 22 miles from east to west and 13 from north to south is a zoo with a collection of 29 exotic big cats.

Episode 2
Tigers Diamond and Aysha move to a new enclosure, designed to recreate their natural environment. We also meet the zoo's youngest primate, ring-tailed lemur Mangoki. White tigress Zena is hit by a mystery illness.
