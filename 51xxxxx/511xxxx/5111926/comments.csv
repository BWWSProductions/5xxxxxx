Could you see if you could find a Haynes manual for 2003 Hyundai Elantra? Been looking everywhere to no avail. If not, thanks for all your great uploads! "

You will not find a Haynes manual for any of the late model Hyundais because they can't compete with free factory service manuals. Go to http://www.hyundaiusa.com/ and register as a owner, then you should be able to download the complete factory service manual or just the sections that you need. I downloaded the manual for my '03 Accent and it's great. Very detailed and model specific, as a factory service manual should be. Later."
