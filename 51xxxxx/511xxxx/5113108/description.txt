Hi Internets!

These tracks are selected soundtrack works which I have composed, including those from the films Jack Said, Jack Says & Hard Knocks.

There is also a couple of bonus tracks in there which are yet to be completed - Derelict, Jack Falls & Elixer.

Hope you like them!

I give my music away for free to consumers, I only ask that if you like/dislike something that you give me an email to let me know, but please write as though you are speaking to me directly, and if you really hate a track please give me an honest reason why!

If you want to use these tracks for a project, please get in touch with me using the contact details below.

If you like these tracks, please share them around, my homepage is www.johnharveymusic.com (the site is being updated at the moment) and I'm working on giving away the full lossless and remixed versions of the tracks within a week (todays date being 7th October 2009).

My email address is john (@) johnharveymusic.com

Happy Listening, and all the best from me and my team!

Look forward to hearing from you,

John J. Harvey
