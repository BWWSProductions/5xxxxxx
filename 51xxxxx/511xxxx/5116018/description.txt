ChiRunning DVD: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-free Running

Practiced by thousands of runners, the ChiRunning technique is easy to learn and takes the benefits of running beyond cardiovascular and aerobic by addressing the needs of the whole person; joints and ligaments, body and soul. You'll learn to run using your highly efficient core muscles while relaxing the rest of your body, allowing gravity to do the work instead of your legs. Using principles of T'ai Chi, ChiRunning combines ancient wisdom with modern physics to transform your running experience.
