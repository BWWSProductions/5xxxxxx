Here you go, people. Thanks to Yoshihiro and his EBOOT patcher, we now have a working copy of Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days for the PSP. 

Playing right now, using GEN CFW 5.50 B2. I guess that it should work with all 5.XX CFW, but I haven't tried yet.

What are you waiting for, give it a go! No more worrying about $ony's bullshit firmware updates breaking our games!

Update: After looking more into it, I guess the patcher allows all custom firmware to play these 5.55 and 6.00 games. So, have fun. It's all open again now!
