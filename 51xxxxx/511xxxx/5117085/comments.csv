,spr0cket,2009-10-10T16:11Z,"Yeah. I read more about Yoshihiro's patcher, and I guess it removes the check for firmware versions, so it should work on all custom firmwares. Isn't that something. In any case, I am glad to see people snagged this. I was a little heartbroken when I saw that this game was out, but I couldn't download it because of the firmware, and if I bought it, it may have hosed my PSP because it installs Sony's firmware automatically.

How's that for potentially lame?"
