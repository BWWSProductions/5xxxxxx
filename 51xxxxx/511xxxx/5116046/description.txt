Who is KK Downey? is the story of two perennial losers who want more than anything to be famous, popular, and successful.  The onlye thing is, Terrence's indie band is a joke, and Theo can't Truck Stop Hustler, his touching book about a young male prostitute, published anywhere.  Thing change, however, when they decide to print Theo's book under the name of its fictional protagonist: KK Downey.  The book becomes a sensation, with over-privileged twenty-somethings wanting desperately to identify with the tragic figure.  This have turned around for Terrence, who poses as the enigmatic KK, but at what price?  Who is KK Downey? is a hilarious examination of media hype and hipster ideology as told by acclaimed Montreal comedy group Kidnapper Films.
