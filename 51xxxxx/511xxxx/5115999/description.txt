This is a small collection of some Coast to Coast am programs I have downloaded since they expanded thier archive back 2 years. 

These are not anything special just some that i downloaded to listen to myself on subjects i find interesting and i thought i would share. 

Note-------------

If you find a program is missing the first hour or the last hour its because i did not download it from the coast website, as it was an interview with someone i dont like, or on a topic i do not enjoy.  therefore i didnt waste my time downloading it :o).  anyhow if i left out an hour that you wanted to listen to i am sorry.  

allso i would like to say if anyone has a program they would like to listen to let me know and i will download it and upload it to this site or demonoid when it comes back up.  i am going to start doing this every time i get up a collection of coast programs that i have downloaded for myself i will in turn upload them here and on demonoid.  i probably won't upload individual programs, but i will instead wait till i have 10 or more to upload in a pack.  i will take requests the new coast site will allow me to download 2 years of programs so as of today october the 8th i can download all the programs back untill october the 9th of 2007.  if you want me to get a specific program let me know by leaving a comment on this torrent with what the program is called, and the date and i will download and include it in my new pack.  

I hope you everyone enjoys my upload, and the show i know i do.
