,ernieballesp06,2009-10-09T11:28Z,I appologize my upload speed was limited to 1 KB.  i changed it just now you should get up to  150kb from me as i have a decent connection
,ernieballesp06,2009-10-09T12:02Z,"i was wanting to correct somthing i said in the main description.  i just noticed this about 45 minutes ago when i got on the coast website to download a few shows, that they have now exapanded the archive to 3 years.  this must have happend in the past 2 days as i get on thier site everyday usually but do not check the archives that often.  anyhow i can now get shows back as far as around the 11th of october.  now everyday that goes by is one day taken away so tomorrow it will be the 12th of oct and then the day after tomorrow i will only be able to get till the 13th of october and so on.  i am saying this because if in two weeks i get a request for a show from the 11th of october i will not be able to get it then as it will be gone fallen from the d/lable archive.  anyhow i just wanted to correct my error.

peace everyone"

,ernieballesp06,2009-10-11T06:45Z,"sorry to anyone who is downloading, i am at a friends house for at least the next 24 hours and well his connection is WAY slower then mine.  Upload rate is going to suffer vastly, at my house i can upload to you guys at 150 kbs, here you will be lucky to get 20kbs.  again i appologize, i will continue to seed even though it sux.  n once i get back home i will super seed it with my faster connection, untill i have uploaded at least 10gb,  i have allready uploaded around 5 or so.  anyhow just wanted to comment in case anyone was d/ling"

totaly offtopic to coast to coast am, i am looking for Digital Tutors tutorials.  ones for Autodesk Maya, and Zbrush.  if anyone has any of the newer ones, like 2009, or 2010 i would greatly appretiate the upload i simply dont have 60 bucks to drop on one right now or i would, and i need more then one :o).  the only older ones i could use is metal ray sub serface scattering and mental ray workflows in maya.  i have the maya extreme bundle and quite a few others i could upload if anyone needs those.
