Over five nights in Manchester last November the musical collaborators behind Gorillaz' smash hit second album Demon Days assembled at the Manchester Opera House to take on the task of recreating the album live on stage. This was the very first live rendition of the record. Gorillaz: Demon Days Live DVD brings the whole experience to the small screen for the first time. The entire performance was set to a backdrop of specially designed visuals and animation by Gorillaz co-creator Jamie Hewlett. The DVD will also carry a unique full screen visuals version of the show.
