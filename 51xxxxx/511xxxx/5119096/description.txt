Dead By Sunrise recently finished filming videos for the songs â€œCrawl Back Inâ€ and â€œLet Downâ€. with director P.R. Brown (Slipknot, Korn, Godsmack, Avenged Sevenfold).
Bennington began working on Dead By Sunrise back in 2006, explaining, â€œI came up with a few songs that felt and sounded really good, but I knew they werenâ€™t right stylistically for Linkin Park. They were darker and moodier than anything Iâ€™d come up with for the band. So I decided to work on them on my own rather than turn them over and have them transformed into Linkin Park tracks.â€
