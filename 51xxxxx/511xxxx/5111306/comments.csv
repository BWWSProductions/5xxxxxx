,Lefty4e,2011-03-31T08:18Z,"I hate myself for being so  broke I need to pirate this man's music. Someone with his talent deserves the money.

I put up a note up on my wall, as soon as I get out of school and can earn some money, this will be top-priority. Pointless to mention to the world, but nonetheless."
