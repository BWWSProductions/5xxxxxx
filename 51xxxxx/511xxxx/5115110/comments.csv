myself i came from the late 70s early 80s era. though i do enjoy some of todays music but my roots tend to drift back every once in awhile..
Cheers :)"

,potet9,2012-06-16T20:58Z,"Is it possible to rip the songs in such a poor quality? minimum, the worse mp3 320kbps. do not understand why there are some who complain about the low kbps. I get so tired of dull people no matter how poor sound quality it is so no one complains! Shit people up in sound quality?"
