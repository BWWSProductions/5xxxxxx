Episode two: The Thynkynge Revolution

One night in 1572 the Elizabethan astronomer Thomas Diggs saw a bright new star in the sky. It was a real shock; it shouldnâ€™t have been there. The Tudors believed that heaven, where God lived, was perfect and unchanging, and the appearance of this bright new star completely undermined their whole system of belief. 

But there was worse, that observation wasnâ€™t just quietly recorded it rapidly became common knowledge thanks to a really dangerous piece of high technology, the printing press. News of that star was just one of a load of ideas that were going to turn the Tudor world upside-down.

Hart-Davis travels around Britain to introduce the idea and inventions of the Tudor Age in science, literature and education.


* The first printing press, like the one recreated at St Bride Printing Library, was brought to England by William Caxton.

* The resulting printing revolution included William Tyndaleâ€™s English bible that lead to the standardisation of the English language.

* State education was founded by Henry VIII providing opportunities for Christopher Marlowe and William Harvey amongst others.

* Human anatomy was revolutionised by Andreas Vesalius following the legalisation of human dissection by Henry VIII.

* Modern medicine began from the Swiss Alchemist Paracelsusâ€™ belief that minerals and chemicals could be used to treat diseases.

* Observational science came of age when Thomas Diggs recorded the first observation of a supernova.
