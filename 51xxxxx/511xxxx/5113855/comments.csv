Again, many thanks for the upload, will seed like a madman!"
,murder86,2009-11-09T00:20Z,"sure, download, decompress the files and put them into My Documents/Electronic Arts/Downloads/ directory, disconnect your internet, then load EA Manager, then install the items, reconnect internet when finished"
,murder86,2009-11-09T00:22Z,"slight typo, the right directory to put the decompressed files in is

My Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Downloads/"
