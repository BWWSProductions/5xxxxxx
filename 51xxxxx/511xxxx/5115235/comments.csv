,brillmann,2009-10-09T17:34Z,Hope this is Blood Bowl (Cyanide) Update v1.0.1.10 Cracked by Reloaded ?!!
,Akuensan,2009-10-09T22:49Z,"Can anyone verify if this is a legitimate release, and if so, from what group?"
,Overturn,2009-10-10T10:35Z,"This is indeed working.

Install update 1.0.1.10 then this patch.

Working!!"
,Duck3,2009-10-10T14:00Z,"Failed to initialize the emulator :(
How is it work ???"
,Akuensan,2009-10-10T16:07Z,I find it pretty dubious since the download contains a bunch of ads for websites and the nfo is the same as the full release from Reloaded.
,Duck3,2009-10-11T08:20Z,"Indeed, it's work."
,McVilly,2009-10-12T13:23Z,"It works. Just extract Archive to folder where you've installed game.

Someone probably just added those files to archive after installing reloaded release."
,zamzacool,2010-07-04T02:06Z,can somebody tell how this REALLY works????
