Just a Minute was devised by the late Ian Messiter who came up with the idea on the top of a number 13 bus.  He suddenly remembered being given the horrible task of speaking for one minute without hesitation or deviation by one of his school masters.

Thirty-five years later, Chairman Nicholas Parsons continues to attempt - and mostly succeed - in keeping control over a roll-call of celebrity contenders attempting to talk on a subject for sixty seconds without hesitation, repetition or deviation.
