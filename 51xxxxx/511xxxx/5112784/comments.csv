[V],neon,2009-10-08T19:50Z,"im doing another comment for this movie,i watched this first on my pc..fine with great audio + video...then burned it to disc for my kid to watch on tv...thats when the audio turned nasty--now i understand why people are moaning about the audio--V-9.5 A-4.. sorry movieFOX "
,Cybersprire,2009-10-08T19:57Z,"Better audio than DUQA, but still not good enough for me since the sound is half the experince or at least 1/3 of the experience. I'm gonna wait it out untill the sound is fixed.

Thx for the effort though.

V: 10
A: 6"
,Cybersprire,2009-10-08T20:00Z,Make that a V:5 in stead...
,Cybersprire,2009-10-08T20:01Z,sry... meant Audio=5... lol
