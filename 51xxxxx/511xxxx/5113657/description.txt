Fourteen-year-old Benny (Arno Frisch) is a video freak whose life consists only of school, videotaping what he sees outside his window and spending hours watching violent action films. Benny becomes obsessed with amateur footage of a pig being slaughtered, and soon, his passion for videotaped death leads him to commit a heinous act of his own. Austrian director Michael Haneke helms this postmodern exploration of emotional disconnection.
