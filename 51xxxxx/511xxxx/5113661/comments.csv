You aren't brilliant in European languages, a X to X dictionary is an explicative one that gives a definition of the word, not a translation, using the same language:
The Latin language Advanced Learners' Dictionary."
,yosoyusuario,2009-10-09T08:00Z,"Ok, LATUM, fucking piece of pretencios asshole, I think I said ""forgive my ignorance""; never said I was  a wise man. Anyway, you can take your torrent and take it through your ass, fucking piece of shit "
,torkelhilde3,2009-10-09T11:01Z,"FYI: This is Forcellini's Lexicon Totius Latinitatis, 1940 edition. It is a comprehensive Latin-Latin dictionary in 4 volumes. The torrent contains one scanned PDF file for each volume. The scan quality is fairly low, sometimes the text is barely legible. Nevertheless, it is a very useful resource if you need it, since the only other way to use this book probably is to go to a good university library."
