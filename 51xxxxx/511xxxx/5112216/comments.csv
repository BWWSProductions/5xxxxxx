,barton_hall,2010-04-29T17:32Z,"I was looking forward to this collection, but it appears to be corrupted.  WinDefender found TrojanDownloader:Win32/Lnkget.C in Ton Koopman\J.S. Bach - Organ Works CD10\22.mp3.  To eddie, you might look into this issue."
,scottielass,2010-11-07T16:29Z,Wonderful collection -- thank you so much.
,halers,2010-11-28T08:24Z,"Thank you so much.  Downloaded it without a problem.  The notes are excellent, too.  I think Koopman is the best performer of Bach's keyboard music."
