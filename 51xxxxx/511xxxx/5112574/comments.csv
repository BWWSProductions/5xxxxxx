This film rocks!!!!!!!
So does Thrashin', I heard it's same director or something?"
,ElectroNomad,2010-01-19T05:48Z,Go out of sync about 45 mins into the movie. Really annoying. I'll get the ISO and convert it myself.
,kchri,2011-11-03T22:27Z,"ElectroNomad's exactly right. Out of sync after a certain point. Funny enough, I have the ISO of this, too. What program does one recommend to convert it from there, though??"
