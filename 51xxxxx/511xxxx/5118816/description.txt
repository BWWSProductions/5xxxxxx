Weird Mystery Tales was a mystery and horror anthology from DC Comics, which ran from July 1972-November 1975.  It was originally hosted by Destiny, but was gradually taken over by Eve, who fully assumed the title with issue #15.

Early issues printed material by Jack Kirby that had been intended for his black and white, magazine-size DC comic, Spirit World, which lasted only one issue.  These stories featured Dr. E. Leopold Maas as host, sometimes with an appended hosting segment by Destiny.
