Thank you very much."
,deuce1,2010-01-04T23:35Z,"Does anyone know if the hour long episodes are supposed to count as two episodes in the numbering?

IMDB says no (lists Niagara as one episode and Mafia as #5): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/episodes

Wikipedia says yes (lists Niagra as two episodes, and Mafia as #6: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_%28U.S._TV_series%29_season_6

Which is supposed to be ""correct""?"
,deuce1,2010-01-07T02:14Z,"I finally found a page on NBC that lists episode numbers.

http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/categories/season-6/1157983/

Secret santa is listed as E13, so counting the hour long episodes as two is correct."
