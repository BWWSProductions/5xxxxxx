,vdMerwe,2009-10-11T11:59Z,"For me, the installer says:

An internal error has occurred.
You will not be able to install this software. "
,jexen,2009-10-12T08:28Z,"Had the same problem, where the 1.74 update wouldn't run. Turns out you need copy the updater from the disk image to your desktop (from http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=249279). Enjoy!"
,blazingherb,2009-10-14T04:01Z,"Thanks jexen for the tip but I found another solution to my dilemma. I ended up downloading the BTS expansion pack. Once installed and cracked, It works perfectly, except for a few minor glitches of course. =P

,RixxxOne,2009-10-21T14:42Z,"Hy People!!! Anybody can help me??? How do I open or unstuff or unzip or mount the ""civilization IV.cdr"" file???? When I double click on this, it's open the Corel Draw.... I have a intel iMac with Snow Leopard..."
,RixxxOne,2009-10-26T13:55Z,???
,jgbulius,2009-11-18T18:38Z,"rixxone it's easy. Just like every other file on your Mac, just go to 'Get Info' for the file and use the 'open with' section to change the program which opens the file. To open it you need to use DiskImageMounter."
,jgbulius,2009-11-18T18:39Z,"I've got a problem of my own however - I don't know how to apply the crack (either that or there's something wrong), because I keep getting asked for the original disk.

Can anyone help?"
,Zuko66,2010-01-15T11:17Z,I'm new...what do I do to make this work. Step by step please
,5orless,2010-04-23T09:10Z,"Found an answer that worked. I kept having a problem with ""chaging permissions"" not working, You have to right click the CIV IV APP and ""show package contents"" then open ""contents"" folder then open ""Mac OS"" folder right click the CIV IV file and scroll down to sharing and permissions and change from read only to read & write. This allows the crack to work with the file. This also works with the same with the BTS crack"

,edreba,2011-08-09T07:12Z,"IT WORKS! IT WORKS! 
Hey boys finally got it! 

1,-download/mount install (Civilization IV.cdr.)  


2,-after the install locate civilization 4 carpet on applications , right click Civilization IV and choose show content packages  it will show a carpet named ""contents"" navigate as contents/macOS/ and right click the civilization IV exe.  and choose get info scroll down to sharing and permissions and change from read only to read & write. This allows the crack to work with the file.


3,-mount Civ4_1.74.dmg after opened  drag and drop installer to you're Civilization IV carpet on applications in you're mac


4,-run the installer choose the civ4 app and install
FOR THE CRACK 


5,-mount crack.dmg after opened drag and drop Civilization IV 174.52473 UBCrack  to you're civilization 4 carpet 


6,-run crack and  listo !

MY  M.I.T. finally paid off  "
,dauberbanaan,2011-10-19T21:40Z,"So let's translate that last comment to English, shall we? 
1. Mount the CDR file and install Civ IV
2. Open your terminal, type ""chmod 777"" followed by a space and drag your Civilization IV.app/Contents/MacOS/Civilization IV file into the terminal window.
3. Mount Civ4_1.74.dmg
4. Drag the updater into your Civilization IV folder and run it. It should fail, but when it asks you, select the Civilization IV.app
5. Repeat step 2
6. Mount and run the crack"
