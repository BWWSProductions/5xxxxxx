Though popular at school, teen siren Roseanne Skolnik (Monica Keena) leads a miserable life at home thanks to the friction between her bitter mother, Maggie (Ellen Barkin), and swillpot stepdad, Fred (Michael Ironside). Things reach a boiling point when Maggie hooks up with a bartender, and the angry, self-pitying Fred has his way with Roseanne. Consumed with revenge, she plots payback with the help of her witless jock boyfriend (James DeBello).
