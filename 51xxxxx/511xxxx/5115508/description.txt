Synopsis:
Two best friends, Badrol and Lim went to Badrol's old kampung (village) where he grew
up, with intentions to experience some long-forgotten true Malaysian life 
in his Grandfather's durian orchard. However their simple holiday trip is 
cut short by the discovery of a clue that leads them closer to the legend 
of the mystery house deep in the forest. Together with their newly found friends,
Rajoo the animal-whispering boy, Rose the village beauty, and her two mischievous 
twin brothers (Upin and Ipin), they work together to unravel the secrets 
surrounding the small kampung. The background of this movie is about the multi-racial
society in Malaysia, which lives in harmony despite their differences in culture
and native language.
