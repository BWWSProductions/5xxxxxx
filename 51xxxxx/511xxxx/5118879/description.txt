Frankenthumb

It's alive! Gasp at nonstop comedy in this
outrageous spoof of the horror classic, direct
from the mind of Steve Oedekerk (Jimmy Neutron,
The Nutty Professor).

Incredible stylistic detail brings you into
a world of gothic laboratories, hunchbacks,
and even a deceased Thumb brought back to life!

Hold on to your electrodes!
