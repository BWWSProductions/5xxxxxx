A Voyage Round My Father - John Mortimer's autobiographical play

John Mortimer's autobiographical play is the affectionate portrait of a son's relationship with his father. Growing up in the shadow of the brilliant barrister, who adored his garden and hated visitors, and whose blindness was never mentioned, the son continually yearns for his father's love and respect.

A radio production of John Mortimer's highly acclaimed West End play with the 2006 theatre cast.

One episode of approximately 90 minutes.

Theatre Reviews:
`This is John Mortimer's best play, a play hilariously and profoundly English, so profoundly as to be universal... Thea Sharrock's production is spare, precise and moving: the actors play together like an orchestra of minds... Derek Jacobi creates... a masterful performance, towering, touching and tragic: one of the great events of the year.` [The Sunday Times]

`An evening of rare and continuous pleasure`
[Daily Telegraph]

`Thea Sharrock's beautifully pitched and acted production...AN UNMISSABLE COMIC TRIP`
[Evening Standard]
