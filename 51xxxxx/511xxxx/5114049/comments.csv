,OlexKi,2009-10-09T11:36Z,"Wow! This is OTHER version of 'Now And Then' song by ANOTHER unknown band! This is interesting: I has bought my version of this bootleg 10.09.09 in russian CD-shop, and it is comlpetly different! :)))"
,OlexKi,2009-10-09T12:39Z,"I'm downloading your torrent RIGHT NOW and I already have listen about 8 songs from it. Most of all songs in my version from different sourses :))) For example, your version of 'Now And Then' song was created by Beatles fan named Octavio Cavalli in 2008. My version of this song created probably by IAmAPhoney in 2006. :)))

Thank you for comments on my torrent. ^__^"

,johnnybleed,2010-01-07T20:06Z,Most of the song are not on the other bootleg...
