  MixMeister Fusion + Video
Rock-solid audio & video mixing flexibility.

MixMeister Fusion + Video is the ultimate audio and video mixing system for live DJ performances.  Built on top of our groundbreaking MixMeister Fusion software, this add-on module lets you mix full-motion, beat-matched videos right alongside your audio mix.

Offer a complete show.  For only $99.95 more than the cost of Fusion, you can perform integrated audio/video sets without the complexity of dedicated VJ gear.  Place music videos in your playlist just like audio files, and Fusion will let you beat mix them, loop them and manipulate them on the fly.

Play hands-on or hands-off.  Fusion + Video lets you control exact video sequences and transitions, or you can use the montage builder to automatically create video mixes in perfect sync with the beat.  This feature is perfect for displaying lots of short ambient or psychadelic clips in sync with a song.
