,GlobalNWO,2009-10-17T07:51Z,Avast said there was a virus in the crack
,Damien74,2009-10-21T15:02Z,Avast always says that about cracks and such.
,P0ks2,2009-10-24T19:10Z,Anyone knows if it works?
,Barton3CD,2009-10-28T18:09Z,"If you are not sure, you could try this: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5098359/Alcohol_120__Retail_v1.9.8.7612


It is the latest version, anyway, and the poster is trusted"
,uberwagn,2009-10-29T16:49Z,"Thanks, works perfect."
,uberwagn,2009-10-29T16:49Z,"And I mean this torrent - not the link the guy posted above, THAT one didn't work."
,tart1,2009-11-08T19:32Z,This does indeed install a trojan/virii. as soon as the patch is executed it places a file in the helper section of where ever alcohol is installed... Avoid peeps
,sho666,2009-11-12T10:28Z,"@GlobalNWO

you ever heard of a false positive?"
,schitiz,2009-11-12T19:15Z,"I have Windows 7 Retail version installed.
When I run the setup-
1) It asks to choose language
2) The I agree statement comes up
3) It asks 2 restart pc & after that the setup will continue.
4) After restarting again the setup starts from step 1.

Can't understand what 2 do."
,UrInaTion,2009-11-18T05:21Z,"@schitiz  DUDE you have the Loop virus...good luck getting rid of that..It completley ripped my os apart...it converted my Win7 os back to Vista..It also hacked my pc telepad software, and made a call to my Ex without my Permission.. Damn thing called him a whore..Good luck"
,prying eyes,2009-11-25T21:00Z,"It seems to be clean. Ran in sandbox, took the extracted exe file, unpacked and checked with virul total.

I haven't installed alcohol yet, so can't comment on that aspect."
,DeadlyMoon09,2009-11-28T20:25Z,"Thanks for this, I really wanted to play this game, but I couldn't...because of Deamon tools doesn't work on Windows 7. My computer detected no viruses. I really enjoyed this. Thanks voll12!"
,catdetective,2009-12-07T23:46Z,"Just so you know, my F-secure antivirus reported an Ad-program/virus in the loader.exe file. I just wanna confirm if someone else has detected the same thing or if my antivirus is just being nervous?"
,ShatteredK,2009-12-12T08:59Z,@UrInaTion your fucking retarded get a life. its not a loop virus dumb fuck
,kamilr,2009-12-19T10:23Z,"Yes, there is 90% virus in crack.

In torrent archive there is PatCh500ML.exe [724 KB (741Â 796 bytes)] as crack, and while unpacking there is a virus/troyan warning.

But I downloaded from other site PatCh411ML.exe [529 KB (541Â 897 bytes)] and while unpacking there is no virus warning and Alcohol works good on windows 7.

So be carefull, it's better to download PatCh411ML.exe and takes no risk."
,Da-5iddySixx,2010-01-22T19:52Z,"Just in case anybody didn't know this ""crack""/""patch"" has a virus in it. I wrote a crack that didn't have one but it gets deleted and gets me banned. So sorry but I can't upload it here..."
,intelliq,2010-01-25T22:22Z,Kamilr is correct.  Get the other patcher and it works flawlessly (at zudoDOTcom)
,mazinelobeid,2010-02-04T23:00Z,can someone tell me the instructions its in russian or something
,Schmidtinflames,2011-01-28T09:20Z,Thx dude :D U saved my day xD

,Quicksilver59,2011-03-07T17:41Z,By the Comodo Internet Security Premium the files are ABSOLUTELY CLEAN !!!
,hussain8,2011-04-20T18:23Z,thankssssssssssssssss
,kukuhri,2011-05-09T02:32Z,"Thank you, worked perfectly. AVAST didn't complain either when I scanned."
,user2552552550,2011-08-06T16:41Z,GREAT!! THANX MAN!*** I LUV U (NO HOMO)
,a19tay92,2011-08-20T05:55Z,"This works great for Windows 7 Ultimate!

1)Download Torrent
2)Extract Files
3)Run .MDSI
4)Copy Contents of crack folder to the directory of Alcohol 120% Install
5)Run the App withing the copied contents
6)Run Alcohol 120%!!!!
7)Everything Should Work Great!"

,DC262012,2011-12-11T13:08Z,"WORKS FLAWLESSLY*

SUPERB TORRENT"
,Ears14U,2012-01-21T22:43Z,"DeadlyMoon09    FYI, you just might want to swith to an ""earlier"" version of Daemon tools. I've run into the same crap, until I went back to version 4.40.2.0131    No problems at all now.
"
,Ears14U,2012-01-23T04:36Z,"If anyone has an install error directing you to seek alcohol's help? DON'T. Just try disabling any/all antivirus software first. If that doesn't work, then do    what I did...Reboot into safe mode, and install it easily. Just make sure you transfer your crack file to the install file before you run it, and run the 3 files that modify your registry. That's it! Easily installed then. Check your help? And you'll see that it works superb!"
