I take no credit for this footage. I have simply downloaded it from You.tube and converted to DVD with simple menue for fans to enjoy!


Filmed in HD 16:9 format so footage is DVD quality. Audio recorded directly from soundboard. Exceptional quality for an audience recording. 

If you are a fan, you will love this short concert!
