Amazing freeriding sequences from Alaska and breathtaking paragliding acrobatics show, where snowboarder Ueli Kestenholz and paragliding pilot Mathias Roten got their basic skills for speedriding. They take freeriding into a new dimension. Impossible lines now are rideable by simply flying over massive cliffs and seracs.
