Easy to use interface and powerful defrag engine

PerfectDisk, the world's most popular and thorough disk defragmentation solution, combines speed, thoroughness flexibility, control and ease-of-use to help improve PC and server perforance. Global enterprises benefit from faster computers through regular, automated, unattended defragmentation with PerfectDisk.

Certified by Microsoft for Windows, PerfectDisk is designed for today's largest disk drives. With the PerfectDisks Command Center management console, complete management and control is at the administrator's fingertips. If you really need disk defragmentation, optimization, as well as free space consolidation, then PerfectDisk will surely meet each of your high demands and precise necessities.

Designed to quickly and efficiently defragment heavily fragmented, multi-terabyte drives

PerfectDisk will defragment your largest drives faster and more efficiently than any other product, resulting in faster-performing PCs, laptops and servers and a more productive user experience. And you don't need to be concerned about the size of the drive or how badly fragmented it is - PerfectDisk can handle it. PerfectDisk will make your drive completely defragmented and optimized..Plus, you won't pay a premium to defragment large drives. And that saves you money.

SMARTPlacement -- patented file placement strategy

PerfectDisk's SMARTPlacementÂ·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·ï¿½ optimization strategy results in faster subsequent defragmentation runs because many of the files on the drive do not need to be moved at all, since they are placed according to users unique usage patterns. Typical defragmenters waste resources by constantly moving all files around on the drive.

Space Restoration Technology

Space Restoration Technology provides the most complete and efficeient free space consolidation available today. Raxco Software pioneereed free space consolidation years ago, and the leadership continues with PerfectDisk 8. Added to PerfectDisk's unique single-pass free space consolidation is another exclusive -- Consolidate Free Space Defrag. Consolidate Free Space Defrag creates the largest piece of contiguous free space available. This is useful prior to creating large files or in performing partition resizing operations. It is also useful in compressing a virtual hard drive on a virtual machine, as a large amount of contiguous space will be recaptured.

AutoPilot Scheduling

PerfectDisk's exclusive AutoPilot Scheduling automates all aspects of defragmentation. Administrators and users have complete flexibility in defining schedules to completely automate the enterprise's defragmentation. If users are working, PerfectDisk will run in the background. Once PerfectDisk's schedules are set, everything runs on autopilot.

Resource Saver -- patent-pending technology

PerfectDisk's Resource Saver technology speeds up the process of file analysis, resulting in faster defragmentation runs. And it does it all using fewer resources than typical defragmenters.

Single pass file and free space defragmentation

PerfectDisk does its job - thorough and complete file defragmentation and free space consolidation - in a single pass, no matter how large the drive or how badly fragmented the drive. No slowly chipping away at the problem like typical defragmenters. Once and done - and using fewer resources as well.

Intelligent Screen Saver mode (Professional version only)

PerfectDisk's Screen Saver mode will defragment when a system is idle, but only when the drive has not been defragmented in a user-defined number of days. While taking advantage of a PC or laptop being idle, it does not unnecessarily perform a defrag if one has recently been completed, thereby saving resources. Typical defragmenters do not have this intelligence built into their screen saver functionality.

Defragments drives with as little as 5% free space

PerfectDisk only requires the drive to have at least 5% free space. Other defragmenters require as much as 20% free space, thereby wasting space because much of the drive can't be used. Because PerfectDisk requires only 5% of the drive to be free space, you make much better use of your storage investments.

Perfect-Time user-defined thresholds for defragmentation

Allows you to limit the amount of times PerfectDisk needs to run to only when a chosen level of fragmentation is reached, thereby reducing unnecessary runs.

Faster subsequent defragmentation runs

Fewer resources are consumed in subsequent defragmentation runs because of PerfectDisk's patented SMARTPlacement optimization strategy. This means you can do more, and do it faster.

Defragments Master File Table (MFT) and all NTFS metadata

Because only PerfectDisk exclusively defragments all metadata, you end up with a drive that is completely defragmented. Other defragmenters do not defragment all of the NTFS metadata and even more alarming, do not report on the files they leave fragmented.

Detailed fragmentation statistics for ALL files

You get the complete picture of the state of your drive. With other defragmenters, since you don't have statistics on all files, you're only seeing part of the picture.

Places Master File Table (MFT) according to Microsoft recommendations for improved performance

You will see a 5%-10% performance improvement over other defragmenters because of where PerfectDisk places the MFT. Microsoft has specific guidelines for placement of the MFT for this improved performance, and only PerfectDisk follows these guidelines.

Single File Defrag

PerfectDisk allows users to defragment a single file rather than an entire drive if desired. This can be useful for users working with large files, such as videos.

Defragments directories, the pagefile and the hibernate file

No file or directory is left fragmented, so you'll have better performance.

Utilizes the Microsoft move file Application Program Interface (API)

Ensures complete safety of your system

CPU and I/O throttling

PerfectDisk provides the ability to control CPU and I/O resources. While PerfectDisk uses very little CPU resources, administrators still have the ability to throttle CPU depending on certain circumstances. Similarly, I/O activity can also be throttled. This can be useful if, for example, another application is performing large amounts of I/O.

Power Management

Users can choose to control whether PerfectDisk should perform a scheduled defrag when the computer is running on a battery or connected to a UPS. This is particularly useful for laptops users, preventing the battery from being used.

Full integration with Active Directory Group Policy Administrative Templates for enterprise deployment, scheduling, and management

Saves time with enterprise deployment and requires no training for administrators familiar with Microsoft's Active Directory

Installation without User Interface for administrative control

Allows administrators complete control if they wish to deny end users access to the PerfectDisk interface

No limitation of number of systems being scheduled

Easy to schedule across the network, no matter how big. Some defragmenters place restrictions on how many systems can be scheduled.

AutoUpdate Ability

Automatically keeps up with PerfectDisk updates to ensure you are always running the current release.

Full-featured command line support for both local and remote operations

Not limited to certain commands, as you are with other defragmenters. This ability to utilize all PerfectDisk commands gives you even more ability to control PerfectDisk and tailor according to your specific requirements.

Low system resource (CPU, memory) usage

Saves computer resources, freeing them for other needs and applications.

Automates compaction/defragmentation of Microsoft Exchange data stores

Improves Exchange performance and helps you regain disk space (requires PerfectDisk for Exchange)

Q: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'
A: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded

Q: 'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.

   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    

Q: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'
A: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum & explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772

Q: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'
A: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701

Q: 'I don't know how to mount an image file. I don't know this I don't know that. How?'
