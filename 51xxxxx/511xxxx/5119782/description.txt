Secrets of Sinister House was a horror-suspense anthology comic book series published by DC Comics from 1972-1974, a companion to Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion.

After four issues as Sinister House of Secret Love, which featured gothic romance/horror stories written by Michael Fleisher, the title changed to Secrets of Sinister House, and the original format and romance angle was abandoned the following issue. Very much in the same vein as House of Mystery and House of Secrets, (as well as its successor, Secrets of Haunted House) Secrets of Sinister House was "hosted" by Eve (the character debuted in issue #6) and included guest appearances by Eve's children (officially "cousins") Cain and Abel. All three characters would later serve as supporting characters in Neil Gaiman's Sandman. In issue #16, Eve was removed as host - as editor Joe Orlando departed from the title, replaced by Jack C. Harris - to focus on the concept of the "sinister houses." The following month, she began nudging Destiny out of Weird Mystery Tales.
