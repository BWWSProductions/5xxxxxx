Rez for the Ps2                                                Rel. 01/07/2002


Format:	      CD-R NTSC-USA
Lang.:	      English
Discs:         1
Image:         MDS/MDF 
Gener.:        Rythm/Music Action Shooter
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2, or Swap Magic Disc Method.


Compressed with WinRar, Game was tested and works.

(Tested on a Modbo 4.0 chipped Ps2, and ran fine). 

Try 7Zip its free google it, if you don't have WinRar.


This is a CD-R or Compact Disc Type PS2 game, so you'll have to use CD-R media 
only to burn with. (Verbatim recommended)


Note: No Ps2 Backup disc/game or Copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is modded
      or if you use Swap Magic.

     
You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Also swap magic should have a cd loader to boot cd type ps2 games.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

You will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.


Game Description:

Rez is a fast-action shooter that takes you deep into the worldâ€™s computer network. The â€œProject Kâ€ Network has recently been upgraded to handle the rapid expansion of the information age and the core, known as â€œEden,â€ holds the most advanced artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, Eden cannot handle the ability to create her own thoughts and buckles under the pressure in an existential breakdown. She is lost deep inside the system, and youâ€™re the only one that can bring her back online, saving the world from utter chaos.

You must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.
