The Eureka Years - Series 4 - 2008 - BBC Radio Documentary Series



Adam Hart-Davis presents all four programmes from the complete fourth series on BBC Radio 4.

In it he explores spectacular years in the long history of science, when brilliant ideas emerged from the maelstrom of mad, bad and dangerous thinking.

Four episodes of approximately thirty minutes each.



Episode 1: 1650 - Coffee, Cosmology And The Civil War
The country is still reeling after the execution of King Charles I as a small coffee-house opens in Oxford, the first on English soil. In the years that follow, coffee will become the preferred drink of businessmen, scientists and politicians, and fuel the discoveries of the new Age of Reason.

Episode 2: 1923 - Traffic Lights And Frozen Food 
Clarence Birdseye's observation that the Inuit could freeze the fish they caught and keep it fresh led to an invention which transformed both diets and economies across the world. Garrett A Morgan came up with an idea which would stop traffic.

Episode 3: 1893 - The Internal Combustion Engine
Henry Ford builds his first car, Karl Benz constructs his first four-wheeler and Gottlieb Daimler succeeds in putting his new engines in horseless carriages. The internal combustion engine, hailed as the answer to London's pollution problem, is born.

Episode 4: 1879 - The Light Bulb and Moving Pictures
The light bulb and the first moving pictures appeared, and a scientist did a great service to dieters when he forgot to wash his hands before eating his sandwiches.



First broadcast in July/August 2008 on BBC Radio 4.
