,Jamers91,2009-10-14T08:54Z,"Hey, everything is running great, but it says my license will expire on November 13th, 2009. Did I do something wrong, or what's up?"
[T],jmb2012,2009-10-14T13:31Z,"you didnt add key while installing.
Run AVG..click on help..re-activate with a key in the text file"
[T],jmb2012,2009-10-17T14:31Z,"If you guys just want the anti-virus, two choices:Get this torrent and do a custom install or get this...http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5119747/AVG_Anti-Virus_Professional_9.0_Build_663a1706___Keygen_%5BRH%5D"
,Island_Bill,2009-10-24T15:40Z,"This is an awesome torrent - it downloaded fast and is 100% clean. I installed it on a Vista laptop and the installation couldn't have gone smoother.

One of the things I like most about AVG Internet security is it provides a broad base of protection but at the same time is easy to use with the excellent GUI.

Thank you for sharing your skills with us."
,Diablofonts,2009-11-01T03:14Z,"My license expires on 11,17,2009 can I put one of these #'s in to re-activate my exp date to 2/25/2018. I've already paid for it a couple of times b4. I don't want them to ban me from using their program. Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question."

,jzpirate_1,2009-12-17T17:17Z,Thank you much.  Great stuff.  Keep up the good work.
,d14lonestar,2009-12-28T06:56Z,Great upload. If you feel kinda weird about downloading the whole program just download the trial version of AVG Internet Security 9 from the avg.com website and use the serials  from the txt file in the torrent. I'm downloading the exe from the torrent and I will scan it with avg and report back. But the serials DO work so i'm sure the exe is clean. GREAT UPLOAD DUDE! 
,d14lonestar,2009-12-28T07:52Z,Scanned it with AVG Internet Security 9 and it's 100% clean. Again great upload dude! Props.

,locobans,2010-03-15T19:06Z,"@jmb2012 

Thanks a lot bro... I started receiving messages regarding activation...are these keys still working?"
,Island_Bill,2010-03-16T02:40Z,"Just recently I've received notices from AVG stating the program was switched to a 'trial' program and will expire unless I ""renew"" my license. Will it indeed expire and if so, have you got any suggestions?

Thank you for sharing your knowledge"
,locobans,2010-03-16T23:23Z,"@Island_Bill

Try using this KEY (below) and let me know if it works for you...

8MEH-REDSL-7ETEC-ULA8R-EAOKL-4EMBR-ACED
"
,locobans,2010-03-16T23:23Z,Make sure you re-start computer and update...it shouldn't pop the activation message no more.
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-01T10:46Z,"How come when i install this there is no firewall or anti-spam icons or options? they're completely non-existent.

can anyone help?"
,kperaki,2010-04-14T17:34Z,"I installed ok, after a few days it turned to trial version and I activated it again with another serial in your list. But what happens when I've been through ALL the serials?

Next time I will try the serial provided by locobans. Maybe that one will last longer."
,OOOpsyOOO,2010-04-15T09:43Z,I think the problem for most is that they are connected to the internet while installing. Disable the network-adapter before installing. When finished installing -> restart -> enable network adapter -> update avg
,OOOpsyOOO,2010-04-15T11:15Z,Let me correct myself: Unvalid keys....
,kperaki,2010-04-18T23:19Z,"So, the serial provided by locobans also expired. So what are we supposed to do when they ALL expire?"
,xldown,2010-10-24T21:09Z,"
This Activation Code is perfeft!
8MEH-REDSL-7ETEC-ULA8R-EAOKL-4EMBR-ACED
