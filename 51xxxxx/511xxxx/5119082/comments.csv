,ace_012,2009-10-16T00:59Z,"Thanks :) I just finished downloading this, but it says unverified in abgx. When a new game comes out and it says unverified, and then when its in ABGX's db and ""autofixes"" it does it actually change the game/stealth patch any or does it only just ""verify"" the game to the one on the online db? I would really love to go ahead and start playing this without waiting to have to wait for abgx :p"
