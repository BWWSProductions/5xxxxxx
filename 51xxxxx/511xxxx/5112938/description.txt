Storyline: When 9 first comes to life, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans are

the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no 
good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first 
place. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilization may depend on them.
