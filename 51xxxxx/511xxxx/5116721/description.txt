Shakira's brand new English album "She Wolf" is an uptempo pop album. It is all about synthesizers and electronical concepts, all mixed with the world sounds that we are used to from Shakira.

Sounds from countries like India, the Middle East and her home country of Colombia. "She Wolf" features a predominantly English track list with a follow up album of new and unique repertoire in Spanish to come in 2010. The title track "She-Wolf " boasts the infectious and energizing sound that made Shakira a household name, with a slightly more dancey/ electronic beat (about 125 beats per minute). Though most tracks on the upcoming album will be in English, Shakira chose to service the Spanish version of the first single, "Loba", two weeks before the English single is launched.
