The first TWO episodes of season 6 were released on the same night, Broken Pt. 1 & 2 premiered Sept. 21st. That makes what I assume this posted episode is, ""The Tyrant,"" episode 4. 

If this is actually ""Epic Fail,"" aka, S06e03, then my apologies.

The FIRST episode was released on its own premiered September 21st. The second episode ""Epic Fail"", was released a week later."
