How Europe Sees America (2008)
 
HOW EUROPE SEES AMERICA is a documentary that focuses on changing European attitudes toward America from the period after World War II to the present. The film chronicles Europe's love affair with America after World War II, its fascination with U.S. popular culture, and its excitement about the moon landing and the spirit exemplified by John F. Kennedy. The documentary examines how Europeans, with the onset of the Vietnam War, turned against America and became increasingly concerned that their traditional cultures were being trampled by American popular culture. The film also looks at how the Old World feels about America's obsession with consumerism. The film then focuses on more recent events the European reaction to America's invasion of Iraq and often-ambivalent reaction to 9/11. The film ends with European descriptions of what is appealing about America.
