Women Beware Women (c. 1612 - 1627?)
Thomas Middleton (1580 - 1627)

Thomas Middleton's Jacobean classic in which the women are the worst betrayers. When Leantio's beautiful wife Bianca catches the eye of the Duke, the worldly Livia arranges an assignation, plunging Bianca into the vice and corruption of the court.

First broadcast 2003, possibly March 3rd, but I am unable to verify this.
