,esfelipe,2009-10-08T00:23Z,"Great, thanks.  Will Level activation codes be following?"
,djlace,2009-10-08T01:31Z,I downloaded the torrent thanks to all the seeders it was nice and speedy. I have OSX Snow Leopard and I can't install the software. I can mount the ISO's but when I open them all i see is 4 folders with a bunch of files. What do i need to do to get this to work? Thanks for the help in advance
,snodrog742,2009-10-08T02:02Z,"Activation - supposed to be able to Phone Activate and put in 1's all the way.  Not sure how to do it yet.

djlace - Mount the ISO, then go into Rosetta and Add A Language.  It will detect the mounted ISO as a CD-Rom and let you add the level.  Let me know if you have any other questions."
,snodrog742,2009-10-08T02:09Z,Activation instructions now added above.
,djlace,2009-10-08T03:07Z,Sorry for asking stupid questions here. How do I get into Rosetta? I mounted the ISO but when I double click the image I still only see the 4 folders. i am not quite sure how to add a language or anything because I haven't been able to get the program to run.

That gets you the program and patch.  Follow their instructions."
,djlace,2009-10-08T05:34Z,ok got it to work. thank you for your help and quick responses =)
,snodrog742,2009-10-08T05:41Z,No problem. Glad to help.
,spir3x,2009-10-08T09:33Z,"What do you mean ""re iso'd""? 

Jw... I have almost all of the iso for PC, and if I can re iso them that would be great."
,djlace,2009-10-08T16:33Z,"grr now it won't let me activate, it wants a response code and the 1's don't work for it."
,snodrog742,2009-10-08T16:40Z,Try the X's
,djlace,2009-10-08T17:31Z,"i figured it out. I forgot to apply the ""patch"" to the program so it wouldn't let me use the crack. Silly me. thanks for the help though, much appreciated"
,snodrog742,2009-10-08T18:32Z,"By re-iso'd, I followed this thread in a way.  

Pretty much, the ISO's mounted but were not detected by Rosetta.  So they had to be made so they could be detected."
,snodrog742,2009-10-08T18:34Z,"Okay, so it won't let me post the thread link.  Google ""Rosetta Stone Installation Tutorial (Mac users only) - Mininova"" and you can see the thread I followed."
,sorai47,2009-10-08T20:46Z,"Thank you posting this! Also, might be useful to amend that this is the ""Latin American Spanish"" version (as opposed to the ""Spain Spanish"" version). :-)"

,rsrvplmbr,2009-11-24T06:30Z,"I dl'd this and v3.3.7 and they both work fine, but 
I have reached the point were I need to activate the language and the x's and 1's trick isn't working. 
it just says I have an error and asks if i want to try again. Any other way around or a solution to my (and others it appears) problem would be nice.

,marmar16,2011-09-10T11:11Z,"@Dstseven and baseball

I never had to type X's or 1's. Whenever I start RS, it asks me to register, I simply click ""Register Later"" or the red X on the top right hand corner of the box to close out.

I DLed snodrog's RS APPLICATION, opened the APPLICATION, applied the patch and THEN and ONLY THEN did I bother with the language packs. 

Step 1: Download RS Application
Step 2: Apply the patch after installing the Application (Snowdrog has a readme file with instructions)
Step 3: Download language packs
Step 4: Mount 1 language level at a time using DiskUtility (Macs have built in mounting software, you don't need Daemon tools, etc)
Step 5: Open RS, click add language. When asks you to insert disk, hit OK, language level should show up.
Step 6: Repeat step 4 and 5 for all language levels. 

Voila!

You must apply the patch/ crack (.dat file) before attempting.

Also make sure the internet is turned off once you've DLed everything.

ANNNND never activate!

Enjoy!"
,marmar16,2011-09-10T11:14Z,"CORRECTION!!!!!

I DLed ANONYMOUS' RS Application, not Snodrog's.

,apriltheia,2011-11-17T22:23Z,"Hello. 

First of all I want to say THANK YOU SO MUCH for putting this language pack up. I am however having a spot of bother with it and thought you may be able to help me.

I dounloaded Rosetta Stone application version 3 from another site (not the link you provided) and I downloaded your language package. They worked perfectly together - didn't have to do any of the crazy shit listed below to get it to work - but now I have encountered a problem. I am up to section 3 of level 1 and its asking me to put in my activation code - which I do and I follow your instructions. It asks me to do it by telephone, and I put in the string of 1111's and it gives me this message: ""An error has occurred while activating your product(s). Would you like to verify the code and try again?""

I can't move on from section 3 of level one without going through this rigmarole. Could it be that the activation code isn't working because I downloaded a different Rosetta Stone application that then one you have linked below?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I was just get into it and now I'm stuck!

Sincerely,

April "

If I don't activate then I cant access all Rosetta Stone has to offer. Thanks"

,FThisSht,2012-04-01T16:55Z,"Can someone please explain to me how to install these packs like I'm 5 years old.  I've tried using the Disk Utility on my Mac; it doesn't work.

The funny thing is, I downloaded these packs two months ago and successfully installed the first to, but I'll be damned if I can remember how I did it.  Obviously I followed someone's instructions, but I have no idea whose.  Please help me install this last pack.  I don't know why I didn't do it along with the first two."
,FThisSht,2012-04-01T17:00Z,"Nevermind.  I forgot the part where you have to open the program and select ""Add a New Language"".  My bad."
