it's because he's only using the pirate bay's tracker, which has been offline for a month

add these trackers in and you'll be set:

http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce

udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce"
,boring123,2009-10-10T08:23Z,I added the extra trackers as suggested using http://torrenteditor.com and now its much faster. I had to edit the torrent because my client wouldn't allow me to add the trackers directly.
