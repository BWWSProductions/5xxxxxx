As a result of Jane's (Josie Bissett) tip, the police bring Ella (Katie Cassidy) in for questioning about Sydney's (Laura Leighton) murder. Lauren (Stephanie Jacobsen) is torn between going on a shopping date with Riley (Jessica Lucas) for her wedding and impressing her new boss Wendi (guest star Kelly Carlson) who just set her up on a "date." A stunned Jonah (Michael Rady) is accused of stealing a diamond necklace from a mansion he videotaped for a realtor, but becomes even more upset after Ella mentions a similar necklace that she saw in David's (Shaun Sipos) apartment. Violet (Ashlee Simpson-Wentz) sabotages another employee so she can get closer to Auggie (Colin Egglesfield). Norman Buckley directed the episode written by Chris Fife.
