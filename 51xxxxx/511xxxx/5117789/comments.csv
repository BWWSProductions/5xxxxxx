,sandraphan,2009-10-15T17:27Z,I've done a search for t27 and can't find it.  On the torrent thread on backup is gibberish to me.  Any help?

,Handsom1ma,2009-12-18T12:31Z,"where is t27 and t1?? 
""its posted in the torrent thread on backup"" - I have no idea what that refers to.
Searching google, piratebay and isohunt have all failed for t27 and t1. 
Could anyone help?"
