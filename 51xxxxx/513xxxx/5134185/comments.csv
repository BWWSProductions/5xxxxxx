,tikitwat,2009-10-24T09:00Z,"You haven't been paying attention - I HAVE been sharing them. And no, there's no point telling where they came from if they came from the site itself. 

I'll share them when I feel like it. Your attitude is not exactly making me feel generous. I care fuck all about a thanks, but hostility is not welcome.

Get it now?"
,tikitwat,2009-10-24T10:22Z,"My point is this: I am not the first to complain about his dickheadedness about giving some semblance of credit. You can call posters ""thieves"" if you want, but let's compare and contrast...

Reposter: download shit from usenet to a folder. Make a torrent.
Post a torrent. Seed for 1-8 hours

Poster: BUY prepaid card (because the sites ALL watermark their shit now so any card you use to share will be dead to the sites after the first post). 
Create new email address. 
JOIN site.
Figure out their structure so you can CRAWL site.
Download shit.
Make torrent.
Post torrent. 
Seed torrent.

That don't include posting to usenet if you want, in which case it's another matter of POSTING and PAYING.

You think people are lining up to post this stuff? Most of those who have been REAL contributors (ie the people posting the shit where TB has been scarfing it up without showing any ratitude at all) have gotten fed up with that bullshit and QUIT. Look at his profile a year ago and see for yourself how much more variety was available then vs now. 

You can suck his dick all you like, but the joke is on you. He's driving off the OPs and you people are acting like he's your friend. The reality is, he's driving off the first tier posters. If you had any sense at all you'd be screaming bloody murder at him to quit being such a dick, instead most of you bend over for and ask him to shove it in harder."

You are right.... and soon enough, there will NOTHING ""new"" here."
,fullmer,2009-10-25T08:41Z,"Hey tikitwat (if that is your real name) - You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I don't know how long you've been at this hobby, but a reposter is someone who posts a link to someone else's sets, without uploading them to a new host. This causes the original poster's sets to be taken down because of the increases in traffic. 

Downloading a set, then putting the pics into a torrent, is not reposting. You're so worried about tikibob getting credit he doesn't deserve, but you seem to be the only one who's fixated on people getting credit. I've seen plenty of posters who pat themselves on the back for thie posts, but I don't recall ever seeing tikibob do that. 

Considering that I don't believe you ever took any of these pics yourself, your whining about who gets credit is bullshit. When they get posted to Usenet, do the posters credit the photographer? No, because they're just reposters themselves, by your definition. Grow up."
