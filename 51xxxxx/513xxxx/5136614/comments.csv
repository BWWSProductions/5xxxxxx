,SuiChiDae,2009-10-26T08:49Z,"Add http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce to your list of trackers. It has over a thousand seeds, and thousands of peers, as of this moment."
,SuiChiDae,2009-10-26T09:29Z,"By the way, this is real, and of excellent quality as usual - eztv never lets us down. :-)"
[T],tzanev,2009-10-26T09:41Z,"I reckon these guys screaming ""fake"" are paid by the corporates to do it. All told not a bad job if you are willing to sell your soul to corporate hell. "
,Spartan_300,2009-10-26T10:09Z,"EZTV's uploads,... Are completely 100% safe,...
Every week I look forward to the uploads of several shows,...
So ignore the fuckwits yelling fakes,...
The only thing fake are their own comments,...
So enjoy...."

,societymike,2009-10-26T11:09Z,"Have you guys actually watched this???
The other ""eztv"" 720p version of this episode is not working. It doesn't connect and gives false share ratio."
,Goodgooglymoogly,2009-10-26T13:44Z,awesome! downloaded pretty quick for the amount of leechers... thanks for the subs alex

,nyder,2009-10-26T16:58Z,"hey, eztv, mr. shit for brains.
your tracker isn't working, so quit being a fucking lazy bastard and add:


http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

to your torrent so everyone that downloads it doesn't have to.

fucking wanker "
,alliford,2009-10-26T19:29Z,"You're the f*ckin' best. I don't know what I'd do without you. Well, I might actually pay for Showtime but that just seems insane."
,alliford,2009-10-26T19:32Z,"BTW, nyder, do you upload anything? Do you provide all these people with quality tv shows and/or movies or fucking anything for that matter? Nope. So keep you're fucking mouth closed unless you're thanking someone for doing something you aren't capable of."
,Italian_Banker,2009-10-26T21:01Z,21.5% after 3 hours? I added the tracker listed above.
,tusantshaq,2009-10-26T21:38Z,@bobross24872487: yeah baby! I love it when those fucking movie companies spend lotsa money to pay idiots like you for doing something which will have absolutely no effect :p
,denman123a,2009-10-27T00:28Z,"my D/L never did connect, but  is bopping along quite nicely, .... you'd think with 24254 Seeders it'd just blaze. Y'never know!"
,denman123a,2009-10-27T00:34Z,"re my last, I pasted the link that IS working but it didn't appear in my comment, so the comment makes no sense. The D/L never started, look at the others in the list as another did work. ... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5136815/Dexter.S04E05.Dirty.Harry.HDTV.XviD-FQM ... "
,drunkship,2009-10-27T00:35Z,eztv is the shit
,DaveTraderPa,2009-10-27T00:39Z,I just wish EZTV's website was back up
,BorisSGD,2009-10-27T08:21Z,"Download never starts. Can't find tracker.... Use this instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5136815/Dexter.S04E05.Dirty.Harry.HDTV.XviD-FQM 
Cheers :-)"
,cmlegend,2009-10-27T21:15Z,Thanks bro... nice upload just like usual
,twiz069,2009-10-28T01:09Z,"Yeah thier website is back (down for like 5 days)but nothing that i download has been updated, very odd. But thank god for the link to PB.
thanks eztv"
,feather22,2009-10-28T16:23Z,EZTV is a hero of mine
,rapzeh,2009-10-29T16:17Z,"@ BorisSGD

it took 6 minutes until it started downloading, not forever.
people should stop re-uploading the same file, they are only slowing down people because a newly uploaded torrent has very few seeders and a bad seeders/leechers ratio.

be more patient and think about it before posting shit and thinking you make us all a favour."
,akaangus,2009-10-30T10:44Z,"Downloaded at a solid 650KiB/s with only a 4000 connection, using Deluge. Took exactly 14 minutes. NOT FOREVER. 

Thanks for the quality up! 

Also, I would be really wary adding some random trackers some guy in the comments suggested... pretty bad idea. Especially when the download is super-fast to begin with."
,kabalizo,2009-11-08T20:17Z,"bloody brilliant,,,, also brilliantly bloody!"
,phin4snm,2009-12-16T00:29Z,"can someone help me out please? how do I add the tracker on my end? damn I feel like an idiot.,.."
,gum.Pseud-AMD,2010-11-26T02:34Z,"Daaaamn that was one fast download, 3.1mb/s all the way.

Thanks "
