,bben95,2010-01-03T03:24Z,psps dont need to have flash cards like the ds r4ds. On the psp you put it on the memory stick and use custom firmware to let you lay it
,dlxmax,2010-01-08T05:49Z,Didn't work for me.  Game doesn't load.  I've been using other patched iso's without any problems... think I'll seek out another release
