All supernatural creatures from vampires to werewolves to ogres and beyond are part of the same race, known as The Others.  The Others live undetected among us, functioning almost entirely at night.  They refer to our daylight world as "Dayside" and their own nighttime realm as "Nightside". 

Sydney Taine is a female detective who walks the narrow path dividing good from evil, the gray line that separates the daytime from the Nightside.  No one knows much about Taine other than she solves crimes that ordinary detectives can't. 

Written by author Robert Weinberg (Cable) and illustrated by Tom Derenick (Trinity, The Web).
