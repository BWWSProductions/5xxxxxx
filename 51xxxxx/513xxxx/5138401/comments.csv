,camper182,2009-11-02T13:45Z,"Yeah its the latest patch i think, doesnt really matter it works great. its funny when u go outside the vault 101 the first time you emmediatly get alot of quests because of the expansion packs.

installing was easy. mount disc 1, then when they ask to insert disc 2 just mount disc 2 and voila, its done. theres no crack or disc needed to play too! so thats nice. im still seeding btw"
,Renkai,2009-11-05T16:41Z,"Umm, Disk 1 works, but the DLC disk just freezes on me.

It never asks you for Disk 2. I'm not sure what you're talking about."

,shmegmo,2009-11-08T00:05Z,"Shit. The same thing happens that happened on the last version of this game that I downloaded. 

Game works fine on first install, no patches. But as soon as I patch it, or in this case install the DLC from the second disc, the game now refuses to launch. I click the icon, screen goes black for about 10 seconds, and BAM, right back to desktop.

Does not matter what i launch from either, be it the .exe, the fallout launcher, or FOMM, same thing every time.

Running Windows 7 RC 7100 if it matters."

Well after that, I went to task manager and right clicked on explorer.exe and left clicked on UAC Virtualization. It worked after that. I don't know why and I had more of a hard time figuring it out, but I wanted to point that out.

I currently have a stable load order at 157 mods and any mod I add after that crashes the game and I have tried many different mods and they all do this.

If your using a 2 speaker system ensure the configuration is set to 2.0/2.1. Can't remember where abouts it is, audio configuration or something. I am assuming you have the problem where you can't hear people talking some of the time etc. Its because the only sound coming out is what would be output on those 2 speakers in a 5.1 setup.

Had same problem with Audigy 2, might be something else I had to do (it was a while ago) but it stems from fallout 3 using 5.1 on 2.0/2.1 or wtv speaker system."

I just got an msi 9800gt, I run it with all vid settings maxed at 1600x900 and it runs Beautifully.. Iv been playing for a couple days and i just nuked a city..LOL. 

So I doubt its the game, your hardware is probably struggling to generate the outside world, as it takes much, Much less to generate indoors with short view distance."

,silverdra,2009-12-26T17:55Z,"im lost with this one.

I downloaded, unrared both DVD 1 and 2.  There was no disk, no iso file or anything to mount on PowerIso.  I simply installed the game by using the setup in the DVD1 folder.  That works perfect.

Now, Is it already patched?  or do I have to do it manually?

Most important, the Add-ons.  I assume they are on DVD2?  I tried double clicking on the EN_Fallout_3_DLC file, but it just froze.  What am I doing wrong?"

,Sephiroths_Wife,2009-12-26T20:31Z,Hey I was googling some stuff and only registered here to answer the Questions about ATI's VPU Recover. It has nothing to do with this game the ATI Catalyst Drivers 9.9 and 9.10 have some weird flaw that causes this when in Overdrive and playing a 3d game. I had it do this with both the Sims 3 and Resident Evil 5 but only when in Overdrive. So I'd suggest Turning off overdrive or rolling back to the 9.7 or 9.8 Drivers. I haven't updated to 9.12 so I don't know if they've fixed this yet. But I can confirm it will not happen when using the older drivers unless the card overheats which it shouldn't if you manually control the fans.
,DarkRak3r,2009-12-27T01:59Z,"So I keep getting ctds. I haven't even gotten up to the Bethesda intro screen yet. Also, as silverdra asked, is this patched up to 1.7? The GOTY version is supposed to be, but the file version of the executable is 1.0.0.12."

SOLUTION FOR CONSTANT CRASHES IN FALLOUT 3

I have spent the last week tearing this apart to find a solution. I have finally figured out what has to be done.

This solution is a last resort AFTER, this is important, AFTER the following:

   1. Install the game - You can read the instructions right?
   2. Install the FINAL FIX (no other crap, just the final fix and follow the instructions) This will stop crashing that occurs in certain parts of the game.
   3. Fix all the LIVE crap as listed here or elsewhere, use GOOGLE and stop posting here to figure it out, if your that dumb to not try that first then you should not have downloaded this or even have a computer.
   4. Install the latest patch from the official site (version is - US english) this will eliminate the crashes/freezes on exiting the game and other in game issues.

Now try the game and see if you are still having crashes.

If you still crash then do the following:

   1. Open file ""fallout_default.ini"" in notepad or whatever other garbage you use.
   2. Go to the end of the section that says [General]
   3. After the last line add these two lines:

bUseThreadedAI=1

iNumHWThreads=2

   1. Save and close

This is some missing code that is needed to manage threads a little better, mostly this will stop crashing inside of buildings or small areas.

Try the game. Still crashing?

   1. Open File Explorer
   2. Search your system drive (usually C:) for ""mpeg2dmx.ax""
   3. Rename the file to ""mpeg2dmx.ax.bkp""
   4. Play the game

Most people experiencing any crashes related to the last will see the problem in their error reports in administrative tools. I'm not sure if this is a OS problem though because many people dont experience this. If you experience sound problems afterwards, try installing the k-lite codecs. I dont know if you need to because I installed them before to try and solve the problem, which it did not. This is the only thing I did that I am not sure will help or not."
,Shadow_Jedi,2009-12-31T13:02Z,"@ Ltrain10: Your answer to a fellow pirate's question was helpful in getting my game fully operational, however, instead of your condescending remarks towards anyone having that problem how about just helping out and don't be a douche about the ordeal. Your assistance would be much more appreciated if it was done so in a guiding and polite manner; we were all noobs once. 

@ AiTB (Downloader) Thanks a lot for this great upload! It was fairly simple to install. My only concerns were the extra content on the second disk, however, that was simply solved by unraring the file, placing it in the Fallout 3 folder, and double clicking it to install. Everything is fairly straight forward if downloaders would do like myself and read previous comments along with the uploader's instructions. If I have any problems with this game in the future I will do my part and add to the comments. The biggest problem it seems that most people are having is crashing problems... "
,Shadow_Jedi,2009-12-31T13:08Z,If your having crashing problems than most likely your system can't handle this heavily GPU intense software. Try tweaking your video settings and you will be able to play with fewer crashes. If this doesn't work I believe I've seen previous comments that could contribute to your problem. I've just built a new computer so luckily my new system can handle all the newer games but I've had my share of crashes with older systems. There are a lot of comments regarding this game but I find it to be a 'great' upload without any flaws that I've yet to uncover. Thanks again AiTB and good luck with everyone getting this game to work.

,SpeedPhantom,2010-01-01T21:32Z,"@Nindigo7, this happend to me before, after 5 minutes of gameplay (right after leaving the vault getting to the vending machine just before megaton) i got a freeze screen, and a BSoD. 

I am running a pretty old machine but still managed to fix the problem and play it at a decent framerate even outdoors! I downloaded Game Booster which eliminates all unnesecary  processes and i was playing for 3 hours straight (including that i disarmed the bomb in Megaton) try this, and patching to 1.7 and having all the latest drivers and running it on 800*600 

I was running fallout 3 @ 20fps outdoors on the following specs:

2.4GHz Intel CELERON (Oh FUCK)
768MB RAM DDR1
256MB GPU 3.0 Pixel shader ATi Radeon x1650pro
80GB HDD

,SpeedPhantom,2010-01-02T16:32Z,"I am 'bout to write a decent text about all the things that happend to me (the errors)

Solution to this is downloading Games for Windows LIVE 3.0 (free) 

For this torrent, first install DVD 1 (it's fallout 3 without expansions, so, regular) then update to US Patch Version 1.7 (google it) and download Games for Windows LIVE 3.0

If u are experiencing game crashes:
1. try updating graphic card drivers, or checking if ur system is supported (see system requirements).
2. Get rid of all CPU intensifying processes (downloading Game Booster might fix the problem)
3. Updating the game to 1.7 might fix the  problem as well

this is a list of things i did and managed to fix my troubles and play the game decently.

Your .dmg files will be downloaded differently on the mac side and when transferred to the windows partition won't work correctly. So if you try and launch the first disc on this torrent, for example, command prompt will jump up and say ""The Program Is Too Big To Fit The Memory"" and then immediately cancel out. So make sure you torrent on that windows partition!"

Someone said they couldn't play disc 2, well you don't play disc 2 - it just contains the data files for the expansion maps.

,tapper101,2010-04-18T00:29Z,"::::Please Read:::::

This was by far the simplest installation I've ever done. There's no way to fail at this. All you do i mount and run the installs. It's failproof. 

My laptop can handle Mw2, BF:BC2 and Just Cause 2 on the Highest and Ultra settings.

I have the latest DirectX, I've got the latest xlive, I've got everything istalled. I even have the fix from Skullptura. I've read all the comments, and I've tryed everything they've said.

This is the 100th-something torrent/game I've downloaded, I've had a couple of extremely advanced installation, this is by far the easiest - Yet it doesn't work for me.

I can run the game, I can make my character - but the game freezes after a couple of seconds/minutes in the game. What's also quite interesting is the fact that the ""Download"" option in the main menu in the game is grayed out and can't be clicked on. (Yes I've checked the DLC in the Launcher Options). I did read something about ""Load loose files"" tho, what's that supposed to mean?

What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't have to be the computers fault, or the execution of the install. 

Anyways, I'm a huge fan of Fallout 3, love it. I actually have it for my PS3. I just want the DLC.
Would be awesome if someone (not a douchebag) would give us all a detailed and correct guide on how to install this game correctly. Thanks in advance."
,tapper101,2010-04-18T18:09Z,"I'll give a bit more detailed info of my problems with this game. 

I get no errors or anything like that. The game just freezes, usually when the screen gets bright white (after the ""One Year Later"" text). But I've also got as far as the birthday party. 

I have the latest drivers, 
I have DirectX10, 
I have Games for Windows and an offline account, 
I have the latest .NET Framworks version,

Laptop specs (Samsung, all brand new):
Windows 7 Home Premium 32
3,7ghz processor (Intel i-series)
4gb DDR3 ram
1,7GB graphic memory (NVIDIA HD Cuda)
1 TB harddrive
Nvidia HD sound card

How I installed the first time:
I unpacked it.
I mounted CD1, installed. (C:/Program)
I mounted CD2, went to Computer -> right-clicked the disc and clicked ""Start and install"" (which starts the install faster). Then I installed it. 
Then I started the Fallout 3 Launcher (I also tryed just launching the game). The launcher set my settings to highest. I opened Data Files in the launcher, made sure all the DLC was all checked. ""Load loose files"" was unchecked.
Then I pressed ""Play"".

And as I previously said, the game freezes, either during the character creation, at the white screen or at the birthday party.

My fan works very well, it doesn't get overheated. 

And as I said in my previous comment, I can run most, if not all, modern games on highest settings. This is the only game I've had problems with. I've tryed everything you've mentioned in these comments, I've googled and tryed everything I found there. It just doesn't fix it.

I read something about changing the name of the file ""mpeg2dmx.ax"" to something different, but I can't find that file.

I've heard someone saying that the game can't run on laptops, someone said that if you can't run the game - you're computer isn't good enough or you did something wrong with the install. But what makes this game so special? It's old and should work perfectly.

I would like to say thanks to all the helpful people at TPB and this torrent in particular for trying to help people with their problems. I'm sure you've helped alot of people and we're all very appreciative. We've solved the error messages for Games for Windows, and other some other problems - but we haven't really fixed the freezes yet have we?
And to all you douchebags, who thinks we're stupid and incompetent as we can't install a simple game - we install it the exact way you do it. How come it doesn't work for everyone?

Sorry for writing so much lol, thanks for reading.
Also read my previous post, if you haven't."
,tapper101,2010-04-19T19:14Z,":::::::HOW TO GET RID OF FREEZES::::::

I have found out how to get rid of the random game freezings. The game works perfectly now.

The game engine has some issues with processors that have more than 2 cores. You can force the game to only use two of them and it will stop the freezing. I haven't had it freeze once since I did this several days ago.

Open up the fallout.ini file in: My Documents\My Games\Fallout3
Find the line:

    bUseThreadedAI=0

    change it to:

    bUseThreadedAI=1

    Add another line after it and insert:

    iNumHWThreads=2

This will limit the game to 2 cores and prevent the engine bug from causing the game to freeze.

Downloaded the whole thing and mounted disc 1 with daemon tools -> worked like a charm.
Then I installed the DLCs and when I select 'play' a message shows: ""couldn't find ordinaal 5360 in DLL-file xlive.dll"" (this is translated from the actual dutch message so it may be a bit different in english)

Turning of the DLCs in 'data files' doesn't work either. Anyone come across this before?

Thx

Find the line:

NOTE: You do NOT need to do anything else other than these instructions. Once installed you can now play Fallout 3 as you would normally. You do not need to go through this newly installed program or anything. This just puts the correct files in the correct folders to allow Fallout 3 to run.

I finished one game, but broken steel just wouldn't kick it, no matter what i did, even disabled all mods. I'm hoping it was because of the save game i used from a previous install, because i started all over again and am hoping it will work.

*spoilers*

what happens is, at the end where you're at the water purifier, and the radiation if going to kill you, i don't wake up in the hospital bed.. i just end up back at the water purifier. sometimes just standing there, sometimes on the ground unable to move.

anyone have any suggestions??"

boot camp - windows 7 ultimate

ive unrar'd the iso and tried to install there, didnt work
i've used daemon tools and tried to mount the iso, didn't work
i click on either the falloutlauncher and the setup application, ive tried to run it as is, and ive tried it with both set up in compatibility modes for XP SP2 and Vista SP2. the same thing always happens. 

 I click on it any application and it opens a black box which immediately disappears. 

i updated my Direct X, my OS and windows live. i cant get any sort of response beyond this black box appearing and disappearing. any help? suggestions?

The ordinal 5360 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll

and i went looking for the xlive.dll and i couldnt find it anywhere...wtf is this games problem?

i can get it to work partially with a different nocd hack, but that causes a bug which doesnt allow me to play the map packs, because as soon as i end the normal campaign and watch the video im taken to the room adn i cant move and theres no one in it, i left it like this for 20 min and no one came and nothing changed and there was no response from the controls so im assuming its a bug, also sometimes enemies turn to red triangles with a filled in white horseshoe shaped, if i kill them, or go into vats mode on them the game creates an error and kills itself

i need either a new xlive.dll and where i should put it, or a better nocd hack

FACT 1:
This intstaller works
(my system specs: ATi 4800 series card, Q6600 CPU, win7 x64 legitimate ""cough XD"")

FACT 2:
The iso's in this torrent are completely independant of one another when using with mounting in daemon, there is no insert disc 2 message or anything like that. ( i dunno what happens when u burn the image but quite frankly i can't be assed to try).

FACT 3:
microsoft live games IS NOT NEEDED at any time during this installation

FACT 4:
I had one issue with sound but downloading the official 1.7 patch and re-installing it AFTER installing the DLC disc image seems to have fixed the problem

After alot of searching, i couldnt really find a reason why except maybe a reference to Securom dectecting Deamon tools or something.

I cannot install the first disc, that is Fallout 3, at all. I put the iso into daemon tools and nothing happened; but when I put the dlc iso in daemon tools it started to install then promptly told me I needed to install Fallout 3.

I have tried to install it by opening both setup.exe and FallOutLauncher.exe by extracting the iso into a folder and by opening the iso up through daemon tools and hosts of other iso programs, including winrar.

The game can install, I gave my friend the iso and it worked fine for him. I meet the system requirements, on Windows XP, but even if I didn't I should still get to the install menu.

If anyone else gets a problem with Windows Live, download xlive.dll and place it in the Fallout 3 directory (as you would have done should you have gotten the xlive.dll error), and it should stop Windows Live from interfering.

,svetkopetko5,2011-10-16T01:23Z,"I spent hours trying to figure this and most people that give advice and solutions are not reading what the problems actually are and I am still having those problems:

1. You have to specify only ONE of the two solutions: ""mount and run ISO"" OR ""unrar and run EXE"". Please don't say ""unrar and run iso"" - there's no iso in the folder after you unrar it.

2. I tried both ways - to mount and run and to unrar and run and I still have problems with the second DVD. The first DVD installs perfectly.

 The second DVD doesn't. 

It takes about 45 seconds for the second disc to initiate installation and after completing ""successfully"" I get a windows popup error telling me that it was not installed correctly asking me to reinstall.

If I try to just play - I get the ""original 5360 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll"" error. But obviously the game did NOT install correctly, otherwise I wouldn't get the system popup.

What is the solution exactly to install the game correctly and not get system error popup at the end?"
