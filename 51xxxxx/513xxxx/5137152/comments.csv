Can this ""shrink"" DVD9 to DVD5, etc.?"
[V],Murlok,2009-10-26T19:21Z,Sorry guys this is my slow line but its not a big torrents so my ratio now is over 2.0 so seeders will come up I hope.some are at 90% so it will come for sure:)
,adamlg1,2009-11-16T06:12Z,"I installed the program, moved the keygen to the program folder, changed the keygen to DVD Architect 4.5-5.0, and entered the serial number. I entered information in the register from another computer boxes, and i entered the given authentication code.

It just says that the authentication code is incorrect.

I've tried a few tweaks in the method and plenty of code combinations. If anyone could help I would greatly appreciate it."
,ElJulioso,2009-11-17T02:33Z,"adamlg1,

I had the same problem as you. I figured it out, however. Here's how you get it running:

1. Install the program using the .exe.
2. Patch it using the keygen - open the keygen, find the right entry, click ""Patch..."", then choose C:\Program Files\Sony\DVD Architect 4.5
3. Run DVD Architect.
4. Input the serial number. Do not hit generate again after you enter the serial number.
5. Click on ""Register from another computer.""
6. Enter the corresponding Authentication Code.

That's it! Works like a charm now. Thanks to the uploader!"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-01-19T17:45Z,Works perfect on my Windows Vista SP3. Thank you. Too bad I'm not familiar with it's layout. Difficult to make it work. Have to look at tutorials. Thanks. +1

windows 7"
,Dutchy82,2010-01-31T21:48Z,"In windows 7 try to run the keygen as administrator, worked for me."
[T],idf560,2010-02-09T10:41Z,"Many thanks Murlok.
Just downloaded this because I needed the subtitle feature which doesn't appear in Architect Studio 4.5. 
Downloaded in a couple of minutes and installed like a dream. Remember to run the keygen as administrator in Windows 7."
,Bebras2,2010-02-26T13:33Z,thanks

,ilikasip,2010-12-30T10:59Z,"Hello Murlok, can you please advise, do I need to have 4.5 already installed on my PC before I down 5.0.   Many thanks in advance."
,guysfn38,2011-01-13T04:05Z,"For everyone having trouble with getting the authentication code to work, make sure you have selected ""DVD Architect 4.5-5.0 Series"" in the dropdown menu in the keygen and NOT ""DVD Architect 4.5 Series."" If you use the ""4.5 Series"" choice, it will incorrectly patch your files and will result in the authentication error. Make sure you use the ""4.5-50. Series"" option for BOTH the patching AND the code generating.

Cheers!"
,ssgonewild,2011-01-16T05:52Z,"I can't figure out how to ""patch"" it. It always says an error has occurred. Ugh, someone help?"
,thanesharp,2011-02-20T22:42Z,"Ok, before you get the flamethrowers out. I am not a complete numbnut. I have installed working copies of Vegas Pro 10 and Acid7 using the patch Keygen method.  So please dont try explaining how to do that.  also i am using the 4.5 - 5.0 patch and patching the correct file.  My only assumption is that the keygen is no longer any good (blame it on someone else if it doesnt work... )> can anyone confirm that keygen no longer work and or point me to a keygen that is working?  And to Murlok and the others who post these torrents and packets.. Much Love. Thanks guys. You are awesome.  I will be watching this post to see if anyone has an answer.  Also, one other Sony question.  Do I need to use Sony DVD arc to create dvds or can i render then burn with an optional software or would you say stick to Sony? (At this point I would buy the damn thing but not in USA and am traveling for next few months. Thanks again."
,thanesharp,2011-02-21T03:29Z,"I am a tard.  Strike my previous posting. Murlock you are a stud.  (Though I am now having issues installing it on my back up laptop) I figured out what the issue was.  This torrent defaults to folder called /dvd architect pro 4.5   and I had from a previous attempt from another torrent a file labeled 5.0  so i kept patching that.. So it was driver error (picnic error problem in chair not in computer.)
Thanks Murlok great torrent.  Even though I hate your cousins on WoW."
,lococo,2011-03-08T15:42Z,"Great. Fast download, worked perfect!"
,pharkit,2011-03-15T09:44Z,"Thanks for this!

Keep up the great uploads!!"
,sbxx,2011-03-16T15:15Z,"It worked perfectly under Win7 64-bit.

I followed ElJulioso's instructions, just make sure you:
- run the keygen as administrator
- select the right product ""DVD Architect 4.5-5.0 Series"""
,akhnaten,2011-04-22T01:43Z,"Thank you so much for this! People who are having problems, it works.  I just installed on Windows 7, 64bit.  Make sure you choose DVD Architect 4.5-5.0 Series from the Key Generator under the ""Product"".  It will then patch correctly and follow the instructions others have posted to insert the key from there.  PeaCe!"
,pedrinhenri,2011-04-26T03:51Z,"Hi!
I have a Windows Vista 32bits, SP2.
My problem installing is doing the patch. I make all the steps here posted, but when I select the fold and click ok, a mensage appears: "" An error has occured while patching the file!""
Anyone knows how should I proceed?
Thanks!"
,CommanderMONG,2011-04-28T13:21Z,"pedrinhenri, make sure you run the keygen as administrator."
,Jimmu,2011-05-05T12:34Z,"I had no problem with the keygen. BUT, after installation is complete I can't start the program. When I click the icon the windows error message ""DVD blablabla has stopped working"" comes up and nothing else happens.

Can anyone help me with this?

I am using Vista."

,Peewee-kun,2011-10-28T13:37Z,Dutchy82 is correct. Win 7 requires the patch to be applied as admin.
,Ghenghy,2011-10-31T13:48Z,Doesnt work. Admin route wont register.

Rorks great!"
,apvizion,2011-12-31T00:01Z,"I have followed all instructions but still the patch won't work. I click patch, then go to the DVD Architect install directory, it says to then go to the ""shared plug-ins"" folder but then it fails to patch when I select this folder. I am running Vista and also have a cracked version of Sony Vegas Pro installed if that has anything to do with it. Any help would be great! Thanks."
,matako46,2012-01-01T21:33Z,I am having the same problem installing the patch in Windows Vista 32 .I click the drop down menu and select SDVDA 4.5-5.0 and hit the generate button. Then click on patch and it takes me to another window to patch directory. I select to patch on program/sony DVD Architect Pro DIrectory 4.5. and get error occurred while patching the file. Any help will be most appreciated.
