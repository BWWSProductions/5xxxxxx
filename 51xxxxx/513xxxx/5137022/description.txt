i noticed smooth jazz is quite popular on tpb so heres Smooth Jazz Plays Motown's Greatest Love songs featuring various instrumental jazz artists on the Shanachie label performing classic songs from the famous Detroit music label Motown. Included are cuts featuring saxophonists Kim Waters, Eddie Baccus, Jr., and others. Showcasing such tracks as "My Girl," "Aint No Mountain High Enough," "My Cherie Amour," and many other great songs, this is a pleasant, romantic, and soothing listen.. perfect for any afterglow situation....and as marvin put it... Lets Get It On.
