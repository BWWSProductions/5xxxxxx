errari 308 GT4 Dino - Episode 12

Wheeler dealer Mike Brewer has gone and bought his most extravagant car yet, a 1974 Ferrari Dino. Spending almost double the usual budget he has a lot riding on this project.
With the car in mechanic Eddâ€™s hands he has already fixed the exterior panels to get it looking its best but now he has to check it will run to its full V8 capacity and thatâ€™s where a couple of the problems lie.
Putting in the hours Edd fixes the problem with the exhaust and after a surprising paint job on the car the guys take it out on a test drive.
With the car looking, sounding and driving its best itâ€™s now time for Mike to sell this super-car and hopefully turn a profit.
