Well I'm not sure, because I downloaded this torrent from another web page and used myself and worked for me. So, I said it would be good to share this file. 
My system was not genuine and the tray icon appeared each restart, so, I used this file and solved the problem. 
I think it will work for you, this is for S ervice P ack 3. Use it with no doubt, it won't mess your system."
