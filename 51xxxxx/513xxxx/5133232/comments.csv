,Aquahutch,2009-10-24T15:59Z,"I'm stoked to finish the download and try it out, but I'm also nervous. It seems TOO easy. How sure are we that this OS doesn't come with a hidden file/hash/reg entry/etc. that Microsoft can use to sniff us out as non-legit, especially when we connect for updates? Being the first ones to pirate this just after release, we're really throwing ourselves out there as the guinea pigs. "
,scoobydoo2u2,2009-10-24T16:21Z,"There's some confusion with the terminology here. This is the original 'Final' RTM version (build 7600.16385) released to OEM manufacturers about 2 months ago. I have used this version without problems since then.

RTM build 7600.20510 is the most up-to-date RTM. It contains all the patches MS released since the first RTM shipped. However, if you install the original RTM build 7600.16385 (this version), and then download all the patches from MS, the build will be automatically upgraded to build 7600.20510. So you're not missing out on anything.

This is not the retail version that was launched on Oct 22. However, AFAIK, the retail and RTM/OEM versions are all the same. If you buy a new PC today, what you get inside will be this RTM/OEM version. Hope that helps."
,Dropastone,2009-10-24T18:20Z,"Can somebody please confirm this works. I only have one PC and I don't want to take the chance right now to see if this works?

If I had two PC's I would just see for myself."
,Aquahutch,2009-10-24T19:56Z,"I've one computer, Dropastone, but I'm going to try it anyway and report back. If it kills my comp I've got my legit copy of Vista standing by and I'll just reinstall."
,Dropastone,2009-10-24T21:01Z,@Aquahutch okay cool I'll be on standby to see how things went for you.
,glasswings21,2009-10-24T21:36Z,So exactly it is a Pre-activated version right?
,Treped,2009-10-25T02:04Z,"I have just downloaded both the 32 bit and 64 bit version of Windows 7 directly from Microsoft today Oct 24.  Both of them are 90 day trials of the ""Final Version Released To Public"" stated by Microsoft Technet today as I subscribe to that and get the downloads. And the versions are 7600.16385.090713-1255 so if anyone really thinks this WOP is posting legitimate software is smoking more weed than me.
There is no such thing as version 7600.20510 so do yourself a favor Dropastone and find another download link and if you downloaded the WOP version delete it. Be assured it is crap or contains a virus so save yourself a headache and find a copy somewhere else, you just cant trust an Italian for anything legit."
,Aquahutch,2009-10-25T03:41Z,"Dropastone,

I'm on Windows 7 now. I formatted my system drive and did a clean installation. So far, I've got no immediate bad news. I had a problem with the install stalling at the very beginning (just showing a wallpaper and a mouse cursor but no other activity) but after searching the web, the solution was to disable the Floppy drive in BIOS if you're not using one. That worked. I also got the install hung up at 69% but I ejected the disc and put it back in and that seemed to work. When you get to the screen that asks for a security key, just leave it blank and click next, and it'll keep going.

Also, I noticed in the control panel/system and security/system that it was awaiting activation, so to glasswings..no. It doesn't appear to be pre-activated. But I downloaded RemoveWAT 1.4 here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5133259/Windows_7_Activator_RemoveWAT_v1.4_by_Hazar_15.10.09_NEW 

The message to activate is now gone. I've already done all the available Windows Updates, and they did fine. I'm now in the process of updating drivers and putting games back in.

I won't claim that this thing is 100% working, but so far so good. I'd say as long as you have a legit copy of Vista or XP standing by and you have your important stuff backed up, go ahead and give it a shot. 

And sorry Treped, but unfortunately the GOOK and JIGABOO versions aren't available yet. "
,Dropastone,2009-10-25T04:18Z,Thanks for the heads up Aquahutch. I will defiantly take your advice into consideration. Thanks for doing the grunt work on this one.

I have currently 32-bit Windows XP, but how can I run this 64bit setup with my system? Do I need to reformat, and then use bootable disk?

Btw. If anyone wants any other information of this image file I can try to inform you before you download."
,Aquahutch,2009-10-25T15:08Z,"Mibrons, since you're trying to run a 64 bit application from a 32-bit OS, you're best option would be to burn the image to a disc and just boot straight from the disc after you restart. "
,Dropastone,2009-10-25T16:06Z,Yeah if you were trying to upgrade from XP to W7 I don't think it can be done and I may be wrong folks but I don't think you can upgrade from  32 to 64 bit you have to do a clean install.

I don't think this is legit. Not worried though... I did the install on my sandbox, nothing on it anyway.

I tried to install fresh with a formatted drive and got some error so it wouldn't install."
,Aquahutch,2009-10-28T18:37Z,"l0lcats, I mentioned in a post above that I left the the spot for a product key blank and clicked next. That's nothing unusual. That's just a normal part of a windows os install. The removeWAT application takes care of the activation requirement later. As for your other problems, i don't know what to tell you. Myself and some others posting here are doing fine. I'm 3 days into using it and all is good."
,l0lcats,2009-10-29T15:04Z,"Used Active@'s kill disk to low-level format the drive then reinstalled. Seems fine.

After reading a bit about the error code, I tried reducing my burn speed from 8x to 4x and it worked flawlessly. Apparently it's easy to corrupt data on OS disk burning if your write speed is too high. Great torrent, A+."
,l0lcats,2009-10-30T00:39Z,"@ Aqua...

About the WAT Removal tool... Are you saying that when you installed the OS it showed as already activated? So if you installed fresh and opened System Properties it showed Active and Genuine? But you needed to run the WAT Removal tool anyway?

OR Did you install the OS, open System Properties, and find that the OS ""needed to be activated?""

I just need to know, since after my install the OS shows activated and genuine, if i really need to use the WAT Removal tool."
,sanitarium66,2009-10-30T16:30Z,"@ l0lcats

The WAT Removal Tool he's talking about is part of the installation process of windows. If you were watching when it was almost finished installing a cmd.exe window pops up and does the activation during the end of windows installation. Whoever made this torrent just added it into the code of the windows installer so people wouldn't have to run anything extra. =D"
