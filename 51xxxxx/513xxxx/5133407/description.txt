RE SEED for Christmas and the party season:

Please see torrent files for track details as these are all re named using industry conventions and one day this is how companies like promo only and the Video pool will deliver there music to us hard working Video Jocks or VJ's for the days of playing CD or DVD's in busy venues to the public have long gone.

Just like the industry's reaction to file share, the distribuition model for sending songs to us is broken and no longer works, for the first thing I have to do with a Promo Only DVD is run it through software to break the VOB's into individual music track which I can then import into my OtsAV pro software for playback.

ANYONE from the record and Karsoke industry out there reading this???  You can not search your music collection on a single DVD.   Karaoke players are two slow and skip, the physical media is bulky and fragile, get with the times Record industry and the Performing Rights people and give us what we want!   Thank you.

VOB (mpeg2) files
4:3 and 16:9 mixed screen ratio
320Kbs Stereo.

Oh and PS, Promo only DROP all support for 4:3 screens and stop wasting my time with any screen ratio other than full widescreen 16:9.  Again move with the times guys.
