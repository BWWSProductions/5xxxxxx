"Deluxe Edition" two CD edition includes a bonus seven track CD.

2009 album from the Ghanaian born and East London based Grime/Hip Hop star. "Catch 22" is a milestone in Tinchy Stryder's ascending career. A move on from the sound of 2007's Star In The Hood, "Catch 22" sees Tinchy working with a diverse range of producers (from. Fraser T Smith to Frank Musik) and guest vocalists (from Taio Cruz to Amelle) to create a signature sound that is not only fresh and current, but is also uniquely his.

Lyrically the album focuses on Tinchy's day-to-day tales from his hood in bow, and his ever changing life as a rising star in the music industry. Spanning the shiny and radio friendly `Number 1' and `Never Leave Me' through to the gritty and bassline heavy, `Stryderman' and `Spotlight', "Catch 22" seamlessly balances universal appeal with street credibility.
