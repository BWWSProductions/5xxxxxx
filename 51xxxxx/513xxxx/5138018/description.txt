Britain's leading pop entertainer Robbie Williams goes backto pop basics with his eighth studio album 'Reality Killed The Video Star'. After receiving mixed reviews for his 2006 record 'Rudebox', the former Take That man enlists the help of pioneering producer Trevor Horn, with electrifying results. Big and bold, it's a typical Robbie album. Packed with plenty of wit and humour, it's a storming return to form. Includes the single 'Bodies'.
