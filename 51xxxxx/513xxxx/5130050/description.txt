A MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³ film.
English, french and spanish subttitles.

Csend Ã©s kiÃ¡ltÃ¡s is the clearest and easiest of the three films to follow in narrative terms. Perhaps because this film is one of JancsÃ³'s more conventional films with respect to story, it has been marginalised in overviews of JancsÃ³'s career and especially relative to SzegÃ©nylegÃ©nyek (The Round-up, 1965) and Csillagosok, katonÃ¡k, despite the fact that the three films are sometimes considered as a forming a "trilogy" together. Nevertheless, the film is an absorbing one and it looks forward to works such as Ã‰gi bÃ¡rÃ¡ny, Szerelmem, Elektra (Electreia, 1974) and SzÃ¶rnyek Ã©vadja (Season of Monsters, 1986) in that it focuses on a dual of individual personalities.

In visual style, the film looks forward, too. This was the first film with JanÃ³s Kende as cinematographer (he was an assistant on Csillagosok, katonÃ¡k), and a distinct aesthetic of choreographed camera movements appears in its nascent form.
