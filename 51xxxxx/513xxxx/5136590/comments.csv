,JBNyen,2009-12-06T23:22Z,"This is a FAKE stuff - DONT DOWNLOAD
the installer tries to put links to website to your system.  Don't trust any shit with the ""By Tree"" or crap like that."
,BigDownUnder,2009-12-25T21:53Z,"I downloaded this about a year ago, it worked fin until today when it asked me to register. So either the license code is out of date or something or other. Oh well i got my use out of it. "
,Rab310709,2010-03-17T16:53Z,"i'm the same as ""bigdownunder"" i have had this for a long time but the serial has run out just ten mins ago so thanks alot to the uploader i made the most of my time with this =D"
,FezzFest,2010-04-06T22:14Z,"This works perfectly. Do as the program suggests. Disconnect your internet-connection before installing & registering. 

I also checked it for virusses or any other malware on VirusTotal and with NOD32, and it is clean. If you don't trust the uploader, you can use 7-Zip to unpack the archive and run the installer directly.

Thanks!"
