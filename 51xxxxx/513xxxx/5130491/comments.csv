[T],[D],2009-11-11T10:16Z,VLC won't work. Use mpc-hc with haali splitter.
,koudepinda,2009-12-16T00:33Z,are you gonna upload the other episodes? 
[T],[D],2009-12-17T22:44Z,Yes.

,luckylime,2011-02-05T04:38Z,"Why did you upload it as a bunch of seperate .mkv files?

I'm not asking this because I disagree with your choice, but because I'm not very knowledgeable of .mkv's and their functionality/practicality.

Was it impossible to upload the episodes as (for example) .avi files?"
,Liet727,2011-06-29T10:13Z,"@luckylime
.mkv just happens to be a superior format.  Wikipedia it if you want details.

Also, thanks to [D] for uploading this phenominal (and hard to find) series.  Runs perfectly on VLC for me (newer version, I suppose).  I love that each episode has Translation Notes as well.  Excellent in all respects."
