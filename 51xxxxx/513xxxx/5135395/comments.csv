This man is brilliant and future generations will realise it, even if many deluded people in our own age cannot!"

,photonboy,2011-09-19T21:26Z,"Thank you for sharing.  Although Richard Dawkins is preaching to the converted in my case (sorry, couldn't resist) I still find listening to him to be a refreshing reminder that even though we atheists are a minority and face worldwide condemnation that is only because most of the human race is, sadly, held in the grip of the insane stupidity of religion.  We can only hope, out of compassion for our fellow humans, that someday organized religion is replaced with organized intelligence..

peace"

Good riddance."
,derpfft,2012-04-13T23:03Z,"^ lol. threatening an atheist with something he does not believe in is beyond comprehension. but... i'm not surprised. religious people don't use much logic or rational thinking in any aspect of their lives.
thanks for the upload btw. :)"
