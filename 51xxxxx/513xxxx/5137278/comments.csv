****************************************

This is a Great up (All of RobbingHood's up are great).

I guess Norton caught on to some of the trial resetters. 

Ok. I use this torrent with trial resetter NTR2010.v1.7.0_[RH] that has 366 days. I always get an uninstall message for Norton but I found a way to stop it.

1st) install Norton and then install the resetter (you may have to go to safe if it prompts you) 

2) Update Norton (it will say to restart your computer) Restart.

3) Log back on and you will notice Norton says to uninstall. Uninstall and choose to save your setting. Restart.

4) Install Norton once again. Install updates (it will tell you to restart) Restart.

5) Log on and do a quick scan. It will say Threat Found SecurityRisk.URLRedir. Don't worry its not, just what the resetter installed to prevent norton from checking your account. 

6) You will need to restore SecurityRisk.URLRedir. Go to Notepad (run as admin) Find your Host file (its under C:-->Windows-->system32-->drivers-->etc [click on the drop down icon and choose ALL FILES]) and right-click it--->go to properties and uncheck READ-ONLY-->APPLY-->OK. Then, go to Norton Internet Securiy and go to Quarantined and double-click SecurityRisk.URLRedir.--->OPTIONS-->RESTORE&EXCLUDE this file-->YES. Go back to your host list and click on the READ ONLY-->APPLY-->Ok. 

7) Done. Also, if you have another firewall program that supports ip blocklist feature, use this to block the Norton Account as well (just to make sure it cant communicate to Norton and rat you out)

216.12.145.20-216.12.145.20
206.204.52.31-206.204.52.31
206.204.54.252-206.204.54.252

-Enjoy"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-27T19:10Z,"@


The trial reset adds two addresses to the hosts file so that he Norton account does not keep popping up when running Norton online. 

127.0.0.1 	www.mynortonaccount.com
127.0.0.1 	mynortonaccount.conxion.com

Norton silently removes the lines through an update, and doesn't warn about it. But indeed it's listed at Quarantaine as SecurityRisk.URLRedir. Your description how to restore and exclude it is correct."
,RottenTaint2007,2010-08-29T03:12Z,"*RobbingHood

I went about 5 days doing the method I put on here without any issues but yesterday, Norton ""found out"" and I had to uninstall. I was on-line and all of the sudden, Norton popped up and said I didn't have a subscription. I checked my Hosts file and everything was ok. This is what the trial resetter put in:

#Norton Internet Security Starts.

127.0.0.1 	mynortonaccount.conxion.com
127.0.0.1 	lcsitemain.conxion.com
127.0.0.1 	lc1alt.symantec.com
127.0.0.1 	lcsitemain.symantec.com
127.0.0.1 	subsync.symantec.com
127.0.0.1 	webact.symantec.com
127.0.0.1 	www-secure.symantec.com
127.0.0.1 	www.mynortonaccount.com

#Norton Internet Security Ends.

I also have Outpost Security Suite PRO 7.0.1 and my ip blocklist was unchanged with this:

216.12.145.20 #mynortonaccount.com
206.204.52.31 mynortonaccount.com
206.204.54.252 www.mynortonaccount.com.gtm.symantec.com

My question is, are there any other address I'd need to block the norton account? "
,RottenTaint2010,2010-09-01T18:50Z,"* RobbingHood

I believe Norton has another way besides the Norton account to find out if you have a valid subscription. I even used my Outpost Security Suite 7.0.1 File & Folder Lock (which enables protection of locally-stored assets from corruption, modification or illegal access by other users or malware)  to lock my Hosts file but Norton still found out. I double-checked my hosts file (after I disabled the File & Folder Lock)  and everything was still there. "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-02T00:17Z,"@RottenTaint2010 

I've installed NIS v17.5 and used NTR v2.6NE. NIS smoothly updated from v17.5 to the current v17.7.

After Norton removed and restored the SecurityRisk.URLRedir my hosts file looks like:

#Norton Internet Security Starts.


#Norton Internet Security Ends.


127.0.0.1 	www.mynortonaccount.com
127.0.0.1 	mynortonaccount.conxion.com


.... While at first it looked like:

#Norton Internet Security Starts.

127.0.0.1 	www.mynortonaccount.com
127.0.0.1 	mynortonaccount.conxion.com

#Norton Internet Security Ends.


.... Everything is still running smooth, and just once the small sys tray box popped up saying that the registration wasn't completed. There's no way that Norton can disable the NTR, unless maybe the NTR itself is detected, or something weird happened."
,RottenTaint2010,2010-09-03T03:45Z,"*RobbingHood 

Thanks 4 your responses.

I've began testing with the trail resetter on my clean install of Win 7 32x now. Norton has never removed any hosts file line but still prompted me to uninstall after reboot even though I was offline (after 1st required reboot). 

I even tried to install w/o any resetters, update to the fullest (prompted restart(s) ) and then install the resetter (in safe mode[as it prompts me]) but Norton's graphical user interface doesn't load afterwords. My NTR is on a usb stick and doesn't get scanned. 

Well, Norton Internet Security 2011 will be released soon :) So, ill be trying to keep NIS 2010 ""valid"" until then. Well, thank you for your hard work and time and if you would, could you tell me where to start to find out how to develop trail re setters and other hacks?
