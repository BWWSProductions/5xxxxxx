,huggums537,2009-12-14T05:25Z,"To get the actual game CD's go here instead: http://mxoemu.info/forum/thread-17.html
They are 3 ISO image files provided by a russion website that can either be burned to disc or mounted on a virtual drive. You will need a free virtual drive emulator such as Daemon tools lite."
,huggums537,2009-12-14T06:08Z,"Please forgive my misspelling of the word ""Russian"" above. I also respect my Russian comrades by pointing out that the word ""Russian"" should always be spelled with a capital ""R"".

Also, just to be clear, you need to get Daemon Tools Lite only if you intend to mount the CD's on a virtual drive instead of burning them to discs. "
,huggums537,2010-10-11T07:42Z,This is now the only place you can get the official storybook since it is no longer available on the official site anymore. I'm so glad I saved and copied it when I had the chance. Now it isn't forever lost as it would have been had I not copied it. I'm awesome.
,huggums537,2010-10-11T07:47Z,This is now the only place you can get the memory book since it is no longer available on the official website. I'm so awesome for saving it and making a copy to share.
,oneneo,2010-10-31T02:51Z,"Dude, you seriously are awesome. I was trying to find the old MxO storyline website and noticed that it was down. I hope that people download this torrent, keep it alive, and perhaps upload it to other sites so that everyone who cares has access to it. 

Seriously, man, thank you. :-)"
