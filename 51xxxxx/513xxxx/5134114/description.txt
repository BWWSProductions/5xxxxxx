This is the complete MxO Memory Storybook in both PDF and HTML format.

The Matrix Online was an MMORPG developed with a storyline that follows after the events of the movie Matrix Revolutions and picks up where the movie left off.

The official storyline plus other memoir/tribute features are beautifully done and all are included in this collection for those of us who missed the opportunity to experience MxO before it finally went offline in August of 2009.

Another of The Matrix Onlines defining and differentiating aspects was its inclusion and emphasis on what was called "The Continuing Story". This is to say the game itself is the official continuation of the universe, story and characters established in The Matrix series of fictional works including the Movie Trilogy, the  Animatrix short films, the Enter the Matrix video game and a series of officially written and produced Matrix comic books. -Wikipedia
