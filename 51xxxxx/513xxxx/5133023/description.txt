Kenrick covers just about his entire bag of tricks in this seminar. You will see Kenrick cover -

- criteria elicitation
- rapport
- unconscious hello
- tonality, pitch, rhythm and pace
- anchoring
- story telling
- metaphor
- The six stories you need to know how to tell
- Sensory language
- metaprograms (towards and away, options & procedures, sorting, etc...)
- EFT

There are also multiple light & sound sessions.

Kenrick has two guest speakers - Dave Lakhani and Eric Knowles. Lakhani covers "The Hero's Journey" as a way to build rapport and credibility and Knowles covers Resistance. The Knowles session is outstanding - one of the most useful sessions on influence I have ever seen.


In my opinion, this is a MUST HAVE, from the Master of Persuasion.
