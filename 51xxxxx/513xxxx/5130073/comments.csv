I don't at all care for American football either (and I'm American).  Where else could a hurt pinky be a season ending injury?  But gay...not really.

thanks from Portugal =)"
,Fox_Almighty,2009-10-28T00:16Z,"lacrosse, lmao... if that's not gay then I'm Bill Clinton... And there's almost as many women playing hockey as there is men, it's just not shown on tv as much cuz ppl want to see fights and injuries... Football is a manly sport, but just as boring to watch as every other sport... I hate watching sports... Watching sports are for couch potatoes with fat asses and no life...

I hate that we got a re-run of I think an episode of season 4-5?, anyway, :'( Hopefully next week the season 6 continues. I want to see the moron Chase go to jail or something... I hate the character, too stupid and useless. I hope 13 and big nose guy comes back. Cameron is too sappy.

Not sure if I left a comment here before, but this torrent is all good, no glitches or off sync, and awesome video and sound quality which is obvious cuz eztv uploaded it."

eztv you screwed up your numbering,now every1 on TPB is being idiots about this.

,Fox_Almighty,2009-11-02T07:58Z,"daverichards123, shut your face... do proper research, then re-comment on here admitting you're an idiot who got the episode list wrong.

last week was a re-run, this monday should be a new episode, can't wait to watch it."

,ansfav,2009-11-05T07:37Z,"to fox_almighty:

that's why i didn't reply to richards, hes a retard...

so can someone forward me to the episode 6? its already thursday so i think its already up, or was it another rerun??? pls reply?"
,crispyorganic,2009-11-08T03:40Z,"Uhhh.... Richards might be a retard, but he's right.

In the ""can't admit you're wrong"" category, we have ansav and foxalmighty.

Here's my imitation: ""fuh fuh fuh shutup richards you're rong aboot de apisodes. You a moron who sux.""

""Now whear's dat episode 6 fuh fuh fuh I cant find it but I saw it on da house website and whatsgoingon I dont know what to do fuh fuh fuh.""

Um, if you listened to Richards, you know that the Fox-TV website, the company that produces the show, is using the number ""6"" to identify it.  I think they've earned the numbering right. Here's a straight cut and paste from their website:

Brave Heart 
Episode 606 : 2009-10-19

That's this very one here in this torrent, which the torrent poster has numbered as ""5"", possibly to up his status in the torrent-poster community as ""the renumberer of TV episodes"".

Also, it would seem that you're using the Fox-TV website to identify the show you would like to find. So you can't have it both ways. If there is a certain episode you want to download, and you're using the Fox website to identify it, then you'll have to accept the fact that it's numbered differently here on this torrent site. "
,JMan1c1347,2009-11-20T08:59Z,"This is episode 5...some of you geniuses 
need to stop counting the two hour premiere 
as two episodes.  Go to FOX.com for crying 
out loud.   

EZTV got it right calling this episode 5...
I'm tired of having to list this again and 
again, but apparently some ppl want to 
f*ck up the season numbers all year long.  

~~Season 6~~
1. Broken (both part 1 & 2) 
2. Epic Fail
3. Tyrant
4. Instant Karma
5. Brave Heart
6. Known Unknowns
7. Teamwork

That's how it goes...
I'm not asking...
I'm telling...

Screw technicalities...
Go to FOX.com & shut up. 
Good job eztv & keep 'em coming..."
,JMan1c1347,2009-11-20T09:08Z,"@crispyorganic...

here's another look at the FOX website you like looking at:

http://www.fox.com/fod/play.php?sh=house

I don't care how they sent the info to tv guides in the U.K.  bottom line... if this is Brave Heart, 
then it's episode 5.  "
,kittymelon,2009-11-26T01:38Z,"JMan1c1347... I must say. I never felt the need to register on this site till now. I did so just so I could comment. If you must tell everyone that they are idiots... well at least check your own sources.

I went to the link you provided and all it did was confirm that crispyorganic was right. 

The first episode is listed as:
Broken (2 hour episode)
Episode 601 : 2009-09-21

The next episode after that is listed as:
Epic Fail
Episode 603 : 2009-09-28

No episode 602 is listed. I'm just going to assume that it's because they are considering episode 1 as two episodes... makes sense to me.

Even if you were right and the first episode is just episode 1... well, that still doesn't explain why they are calling ""Braveheart"" episode 606? Did Fox TV make a typo spanning 5 episodes?

I also checked Wiki and IMDB (neither of which I would trust over the official site). Wiki also says that the first episode is both episode 601 and 602. IMDB on the other hand says what you say. So, if you had used IMDB as your source you wouldn't have looked half as crazy.

Overall, I'd say that Episode 1 is in fact Episode 601 and 602 put together. Two out of three sites say so. One of them being the site you provided. Thank you and I hope this has been a learning experience."
,JMan1c1347,2009-11-27T17:04Z,"@kittymelon: YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

For someone complaining about checking sources, 
you didn't check your source.  Otherwise you'd 
realize that that same site does support my 
words.  

And I'm not calling ""everyone"" idiots...
Just the people that are wrong.
Congrats, you've added yourself to the list.

I'm aware that their are lists calling broken 2 
episodes.  Those lists are for technical purposes, & for other countries that saw the two episodes separately.   

But I'll say this again...it's an American show, so when it says in America, that broken is 1 episode: BROKEN IS ONE EPISODE.

Two out of three sites can say all they want...
I only need one, and I've showed it.  

And to drop a bombshell on you:
No one is going to have a ""learning experience"" 
from anyone calling themselves kittymelon. 

Thanks.  Cheerio!"

Dzi?ki!"
,kittymelon,2009-12-05T00:49Z,"Okay... You seriously need to calm down. I was never saying you were wrong. I was a little upset at the time. I was trying to point out that it is easy to misunderstand the the episode numbers. 

In fact, I went back to re-check my sources and found that you were indeed right. I was looking at the recaps and they only listed 601, 603, 604, etc. This is where, I think, people are getting the most confused. Usually the last numbers indicate what episode it is. (Ex: 609 = Season 6 Episode 9)

Then I went to where you can actually watch the episodes and they were actually label Episode 1, 2, 3, etc. It was there that I realized you were right. 

So, congrats. I guess I am an ""idiot"". We should all now bow down to your superior knowledge and maturity. 'Cause someone with my user-name could never be half as mature. I'm willing to admit that. I've learned so much form you."
,JMan1c1347,2009-12-07T12:42Z,Oh...i was perfectly calm...actually it was quite fun making that post...  You never were trying to call me wrong huh...?  Let's see...i called crispy wrong... you called him right... i don't think any further math is required.  But thanks for the admission... of that... and my superiority... it's usually the hardest part...
,kittymelon,2009-12-09T01:20Z,"I see. Then I did call you wrong, but you also implied 'idiots' when you said ""some of you geniuses "". It's all in the way you take it... but yes, despite the confusion and animosity, this was actually fun... in a weird way. If I didn't argue with you I would probably give false information on other threads. Also, I'm sure it will clear up any further confusion other people might have. Thanks for the chat and I hope to see you using your superior douchebaggery to clear up other failed information. It works. Sayonara!"
