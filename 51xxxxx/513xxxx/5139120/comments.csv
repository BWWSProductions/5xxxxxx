,someguyfromhell,2009-10-28T20:15Z,"This disc allows you to pick which version you want to install, Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Pro, Ultimate, etc."
,1069,2009-10-28T20:31Z,"Why should I trust yours you have no history of uploading any thing?  
 Fair Question."
,someguyfromhell,2009-10-28T20:41Z,"@1069 I've had this account for quit a while. I only uploaded Vistaloader previously, but I deleted it. It you want a disc that works with older systems, feel free to remaster your own. I have provided all the links you may need. "
,kellyfong,2009-10-29T04:05Z,@manuscp - you had it for so long and yet to share it yourself. So stop b*tching someone that does share!
,someguyfromhell,2009-10-29T16:22Z,@barry123best This was from a MSDN image of the RTM release. You can choose which version you want to install. It will ask you during the installation process.
,someguyfromhell,2009-10-29T17:54Z,@freeforever03 Thanks for reporting back. I'm glad it works for you :)
,someguyfromhell,2009-10-30T01:36Z,@chaoslh Yes this is the RTM / Final release. 
,someguyfromhell,2009-10-30T05:13Z,RTM = Release to Manufacturing = Final Release = Retail disc

,OAPM,2009-12-17T17:42Z,"I bought a WIN7 Home Premiun but my DVD won't boot; for what I've read, it is because of my old MSI motherboard.

I tried to follow the steps in the www.unawave.de site with the vLite option for the boot sector, but can't get it right. 

I save this vLite in a USB but when I extracted the Boot Image it was too heavy, ending in a ISO file of 10gb, so I did not burn the DVD becuase is not going to work.

Actually I'm dowloading your iso file.
Does it works for Win7HomePremium 64 bits?
Thanks."
,someguyfromhell,2009-12-28T06:23Z,Sorry but this is just an 32bit build. I left out the 64bit build because most likely you wouldn't be using more than 3GBs of RAM on an older system.
,someguyfromhell,2009-12-28T06:29Z,Also I forgot to mention that you shouldn't use Vlite. Just pop in your Windows 7 disc and use Imgburn to add the new bootsector. The Vista bootsector will be posted soon. Just when I get some time
