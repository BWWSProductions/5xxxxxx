Hey! Thanks for downloading this iso. Make sure you seed to at least 1.2 ratio. Thanks :)

This Windows 7 iso includes:

ei.cfg fix / One Disc Mode - You can install any version of Windows 7 from 1 disc, more info here: http://www.anandtech.com/weblog/showpost.aspx?i=630

Code 5 Error fix - This disc will boot fine in older PCs with AMI BIOS, more info here: http://www.unawave.de/windows-7-tipps/code5-error.html?lang=EN

The only steps needed is to burn the iso to a clean dvd and then boot from the DVD.

To burn this iso, use the included USB-DVD Tool (Windows7-USB-DVD-tool.exe). You can boot it from a thumb drive also. Just install the tool and browse to your iso file. Another alternative is to use ImgBurn (http://www.imgburn.com/) but that is only for discs.

If you need a crack, just search up 7loader. I won't post any direct links however.

No components have been removed (services, tools, accessories, etc.). The iso was based off an MSDN image, and the hashes do match Microsoft's Official RTM release hashes.
