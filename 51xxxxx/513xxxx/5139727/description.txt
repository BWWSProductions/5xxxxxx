Fun action game about base jumping. Google this for gameplay video:

8LRQzEunphA

This is a cider version so is not supported by game developers.

------------------------------------------------

It works fast in my Macbook 2.4 intel GMA X3100 Snow Leopard 10.6.1


Issues (probably because of my intel GMA X3100):

- It crashed in the first run but after a restart no more problems since.
- I can't see the score result.



Enjoy!
