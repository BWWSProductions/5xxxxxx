The album Winter Songs follows the UK number one album Songs For My Mother released six months earlier, this time pulling together a set of 11 songs that evoke special memories of winter and Christmas for Ronan Keating.

Winter Songs includes traditional christmas classics such as "Silent Night" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" as well as modern festive classics like Joni Mitchell's River and Sugarland's "Stay". Songs originally performed by legendary artists like Simon & Garfunkel ("Homeward Bound") and Bob Dylan ("Ring Them Bells") are also included on the album, which also includes two brand new Ronan Keating songs "It's Only Christmas" and "Scars".

Like Keating's previous album, Winter Songs is produced by Stephen Lipson (Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox and Pet Shop Boys):
