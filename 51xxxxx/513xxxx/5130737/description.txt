I previously tried to compare this movie to the Japanese movie Heaven and Earth.

I was mistaken. This movie is related to Shakespeare's King Lear, only with sons
instead of daughters.

The other movies I was thinking about is Kurosawa's Kagemusha. That one refers to
the 16th century warlord Takeda Shingen, but refers to an attempt to substiture
a look-alike after the real guy dies. Maybe I will upload it later.
