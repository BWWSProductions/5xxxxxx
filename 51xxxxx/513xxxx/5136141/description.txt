This is a situation that every tech support person has faced or will face at least once:
a failed hard drive.

In this particular case, a user was getting errors like â€œdisk 0 errorâ€ and â€œinvalid drive specification.â€ Here were the other facts in the case:
â€¢ The data wasnâ€™t backed up.
â€¢ The problem came out of nowhere.
â€¢ The user had accessed Setup and tried to manually enter the settings for the drive type when
â€œAutoâ€ didnâ€™t work.
â€¢ There was no startup disk made by this machine.

Reviving a drive like that oneâ€”even if only long enough to copy its data before you throw the drive in the garbageâ€”is a tough challenge.
