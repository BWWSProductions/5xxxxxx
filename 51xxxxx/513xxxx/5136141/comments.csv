,swamiolsson,2009-12-17T18:34Z,"Thank You, Friend. 
I just lost 2 USB harddrives (1 TB) with films and books. No way to recover it, though the manufacturer replaced them free of charge (WD). Now, I hope to be better prepared if this happens again. I hope Your book will help."

If they made a data guarantee, they would be looking at thousands per hard drive recovery."
