Twenty years ago Danny Summer found his father hanging from the
rafters on Christmas Eve. Ever since that night he has been plotting
revenge. When Brian Hartwell moves into Jessica Michael's guesthouse
she has no idea that her new tenant has a deadly agenda to go with
his new identity. Her daughter Laura doesn't trust him from the
beginning but can't convince her mother that there's more to "The
Perfect Tenant" than meets the eye
