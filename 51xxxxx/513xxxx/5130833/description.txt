I found all the Columbos, got them organized so they're easy to play. There were 50 in all. Ransom for a Dead Man is not yet uploaded. I really messed it up my own homemade original by hard-subtitling it, and doing a bad job at that. I've got two new clean ones coming in now. I will send it out soon.

Now. I've done the same thing with Sherlock Holmes. I was able to find clean copies and all the clean-fitting subtitle files. Here is the first upload of that. I didn't want to do them individually like Columbo because they're too short a video. Well, a little shorter. I decided to group them. There are seven natural groups, seasons, but they come out over 2 gigs each. Neither way of sending them is ideal. 

This first one has seven episodes:
A Scandal in Bohemia
The Dancing Men
The Naval Treaty
The Solitary Cyclist
The Crooked Man
The Speckled Band
The Blue Carbuncle

The file arrangement should be fine. When opening it up, all files and associated subtitle file lay neatly side by side clearly identified by season and episode.
