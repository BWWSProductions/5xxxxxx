,Azorax,2011-04-26T12:03Z,"Anyone who wants to use this game needs to remove the "" . "" in the filename.

Hell just name it GTA.cso and it will work."
,arata75,2011-06-13T08:37Z,"The game works perfectly on my PSP 3001 with 6.39 PRO-B6. 

Remember to use the Sony NP9660 or M33 driver (the former works for me, didn't try the latter) by pressing select, scrolling down to ""UMD ISO MODE"" and using the right or left buttons to select one of the mentioned drivers. Then restart.

Happy gaming! It's a great game, I've been playing it all day."
