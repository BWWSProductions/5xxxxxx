,botanybay1,2009-12-02T23:43Z,be careful with this file seems to be a hidden program running.
,maskedman300,2009-12-08T16:30Z,is this working??...download failed once already
,Duett69,2009-12-27T13:01Z,"Pls, Can anyone confirm @botanybayÂ´s warning about hidden program running!"
,gfmickel,2009-12-30T18:57Z,This original file came from isohunt and I had no problems when I downloaded it from there.  I have Mcafee 2009 which never picked up anything so I don't know what botanybay1 is talking about.   None of my torrent uploads have ever had any hidden malware/adware and this one doesn't either.

,nightprowler.,2010-09-21T04:14Z,"as far as I can tell e03 is complete or every other stand alone download out there is not complete because they are all 212 mb too.
"
,nightprowler.,2010-09-21T13:25Z,"OK I take that back, it and the others I saw are incomplete.  Full versions are out there, but on other trackers unfortunately."
