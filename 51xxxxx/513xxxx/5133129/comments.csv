,Metthos2,2009-10-23T15:23Z,How the hell do I do to seed???
,winwood2010,2009-10-23T22:36Z,"Do not seed, it's freeware.  Seed all, download all - but not Freewrae"
,Metthos2,2009-10-23T22:53Z,"Freeware or not, it doesn?t matter. Its better AI traffic and AI aircraft than Payware and I?m sure many wants it."
,winwood2010,2009-10-23T22:56Z,"yeah go to WOAI and support them! They have best and accurate AI, more up to date than Morten."
,Metthos2,2009-10-24T11:33Z,"Yeaaa??but WOAI comes in two thousand packets and they uses the same AI aircrafts as Morten and the air files in Morten?s packed are adjusted for better AI aircrafts behaviors. But of course, its up to you to put the two thousand packets together.
Good Luck. "

,Metthos2,2009-12-22T14:19Z,"Well, in that case YOU have something wrong in your FS-installation.
It's not unusual that morons are complaining when they have pissed there own pants."
,tetuke,2009-12-31T15:17Z,"METTHOS2: Thanks for sharing it !
This is a great AI Traffic addon for FS2004, way better than any other payware traffic software ever made for FS2004 !!!

,bgtheman,2012-03-20T08:41Z,"Works great in FSX also. Just have to move the files from FSX/Aircraft to FSX/Simobjects/Airplanes.

This pack is better then WOAI btw for the following reason - WOAI is missing a bunch of regional aircraft that ARE available in this package. This pack is not freeware as the author of the models including removed rights for the aircraft to be distributed any longer.  

In other words..Great Torrent! Thank you very kindly for the share! "
