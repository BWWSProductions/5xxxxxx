http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054119/

Plot: Seductive, violent yet philosophical gangster drama throws audiences into the verve of the crime-ridden streets of San Paolo, district called Liberdade, where thousands of immigrants looking for a new life and fresh opportunities in the New World.

Yuda, a Chinese immigrant, and his adopted son Kirin, who he saved being eaten by a tiger in the jungle, stand at the head of a massive pirated goods operation that brings in both money and influence. But their empire is crumbling, as corrupt politicians and rival gangs seek to end their power in the city. Yuda is soon got arrested and his dedicated son tries his best to save not just the family business, but his father's reputation.

'Plastic City' debuted at the 65th Venice Film Festival on August 30, 2008 in Venice, Italy. It is the only Chinese movie that competed for Golden Lion award in 2008.

â€œIâ€™ve integrated some classic elements of Asian genre films, such as a sword fight, into this story of the end of a video piracy empire,â€ Yu told Variety. â€œAs foreigners, the characters are incredibly fragile, and from different generations we see one clinging on to power and the other more of an idealist.â€ [English and Greek Subtitles]
