Strange. Here is working fine without asking anything. If you were using a previous version of this program maybe it finds the old license."
,jersson,2009-10-25T22:12Z,"Yeah that happens to me too, it asks for a serial and I have uninstalled the previous vers, strange but Il see if there are any leftovers ???"
,jersson,2009-10-25T22:41Z,The reviews says that the no 1 driver update is Driver Detective. Any thoughts of uploading that one to a portabel vers ???
[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-25T23:10Z,"@jersson
I've tried Driver Detective, but it requires .NET 2.0 to install, and this can create some problems running it on a PC without it. The one that I've found also had a not valid license, so no way to register it. At the end I prefer smaller programs running without .NET."
,jersson,2009-11-04T05:34Z,"This one did not work for me, it asks for a serial so I installed it and used rhe provided serial and now it's ok,"
,simco18,2010-04-10T17:32Z,Very good. Rate up.
,jazzz3,2010-07-05T03:25Z,"hmph, the licence code's not working :("
