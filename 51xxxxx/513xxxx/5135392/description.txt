Good evening, Pirates,

This is a lossless rip (flac) of the following works by Bruckner, conducted by Sergiu Celibidache - according to many, Bruckner's best interpreter in recorder history (and I think I agree with that : ))

====================================================================
Symphonies 3 through 9, including rehearsal recordings from the 9-th
Te Deum
Mass in F Minor
====================================================================

Downloaded originally from Demonoid.
Sound quality is excellent.

If, for any reason, any of you wish to have a trascoding to mp3s (high-quality mp3s) please let me know and I'll upload my mp3 version of this torrent, although it's easier to just use XRECODE (http://xrecode.en.softonic.com/). It's free, does a great job and can utilize your dual or quadruple or whatever core through multithreading.

Enjoy : )
