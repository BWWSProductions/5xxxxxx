They had a ratio counter which is why I seeded there are people downloading were forced to seed 1:1.   That does not apply here on TPB but please seed to the swarm for as long as you can after receiving this download so others can enjoy it as well.   You will also allow me to move on and seed the best of 93 to 2003 before I loose the Internet for 4 or 5 months this November as I move country."
