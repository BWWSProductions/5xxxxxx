RE SEED with extra public trackers so if the unthinkable happens and we loose TPB and Demonoid my torrents will live on.

Promo only best of series.  Source Promo Only DVD split into tracks with DVD Decrypter and then re named using industry standard tags, so good to go in your Video Discotheque.

All you uploaders out there PLEASE do NOT rip VOBs into mp4, AVI and other lossy formats - if the file size of any of these ends up at less than 100Mb per track they are lost for Video Discotheque use as the quality is not good enough for hi def wide screen TV, which is all we use these days.

Please try and upload quality video.   Thank you.

VOB (mpeg2) files
16:9 and 4:3 mixed screen ratio
320kbs Stereo

Enjoy
