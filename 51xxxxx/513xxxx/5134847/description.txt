Romowe Rikoito is a band of Dark Folk in the most neoclassical slope in the genre, not in vain they have flute, piano, violin and violonchelo accompanying to the traditional acoustic guitars and voices. However, there is not percussion of any type like it is frequent in bands of the genre of more martial character. There is not electronic programming, with the exception of some extracted sounds of field, of birds in the forest or similar things, so one cannot speak that there is an electronic section or of programming in the music, it is purely acoustic. The tendency of the songs is very bucolic, with an air of love toward the forest and the nature, it is not a cheerful music, rather parsimonious and caressing, incites more to the view than to the dance, it is reflexive. This is due to the specific weight of the violonchelo-in charge of Anny-and of the violin-executed by Elena-taken to the melancholic land where they are very productive. But the compositions are beautiful and very elaborated when having many musical elements. The voices also contribute to this atmosphere, that of Niktorius-the leader of the band-it is serious and grief-stricken, sometimes accompanied to choir for Julia's voice that underlies as the call of the nymphs, very ethereal. Of not being for the guitars folkie of Johnny and Niktorius, it would be practical and simply a neoclassical group. As for their discography, this consists of three exceptional works:
