Yeah I did it. I finally got so goddamn pissed off that I downloaded the RARed pieces and put it here myself.

WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?
Those GODDAMN RAR-shit-files are the most unneccesary piece of frustrating shit you can possibly upload!

ONCE AND FOR ALL: There is NO REASON to use RAR files when uploading a torrent! Every bittorrent client that is from the 21st century knows how NOT to delete an entire 500GB file but ONLY the broken piece. Uploading RARed files only makes people use their precious harddrive space for another fucking copy that they end up deleting because they save the unpacked one instead.

I'm a fucking nobody and I couldn't care less. Enjoy this UNCOMPLICATED torrent. Install and play, it's that simple.
