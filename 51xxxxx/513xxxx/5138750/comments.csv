,Ch3244,2009-11-13T03:08Z,"I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes people prefer it in RAR. Idk why. Maybe they get like half a meg smaller file size or something.

Thanks for uploading this."
,lotus02,2009-11-13T18:42Z,did this work for any one? I loaded it I get to start new game than it stops responding 
,lotus02,2009-11-13T19:01Z,I run win 7 64 bit
,Zetoss,2009-11-14T16:22Z,"Should work fine on anything later than XP/2000 so just make sure you have the service pack for Win7 and updated drivers and it should work. The only problem that can be tricky with this game is that it tries to install ""Games For Windows"" and sometimes just doesn't succeed so you need to download and install manually. Far as I know this problem occurs in all versions of the game so it's not just this torrent."
,lotus02,2009-11-15T00:03Z,"win all up to date can't install ""Games For Windows"" stop at   C:\windows\SysWOW64\xlive.dll already here I deleeted it now it stops at XLiveRedist.msi 

is there a way to uninstall  Games For Windows live so I can reinstall"
,skillerman,2009-11-25T14:32Z,yea thx I don't have DVD's so I use daemon tools for my iso reader so anyway thx be seeding this for a while :)
,Zexal,2009-11-29T04:55Z,Way to go. Iso files are more of a pain in the ass then rar files.
,001011,2009-12-02T12:30Z,Works fine no virus but I cant get the DLC to work I disabled Windows live with Games for Windows LIVE Disabler but the DLC dont work for some reason anybody else have this problem????
,maxsibon,2009-12-05T15:04Z,"WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD - SEED AT LEAST A BIT, IM TIRED OF SPEED 2 kb/s..
Please, people, seed.  only 13 % to go :D"
,jamieushuoc,2009-12-07T23:43Z,"has anybody actually got this working on vista 32 bit? iv installed fine, but when i click new game it jus crashes everytime. iv read about this on other torrents and am finding it hard to believe there isnt a solution? anybody know anything ? lol"
,manuelcastelan,2009-12-10T07:08Z,Can someone help me on installing? I was thinking about burning it to a dvd but one part is 5.5 gb and a dvd is only 4.7 gb. It will not extract with winrar but i guess i should have seen that coming. Let me know. thanks.
,M6dEEp,2009-12-15T19:18Z,They put them in separate RARs because then your ISP wont know what types of files you're downloading..There are a few private torrent trackers that require you to .zip or RAR your torrents because of that fact alone.. crazy huh
,Ocelot29,2009-12-25T04:14Z,"Right on, yo, i fucking hate rars, and people who think iso is though need to learn wtf deamon tools is

ill update on the torrent when i get this badboy dled and installed"
,cooleo45671,2009-12-25T05:24Z,"Fast downlaod, and works ok...For some reason, the Point Lookout dlc is screwed up...The boat you're supposed to take is a bunch of giant red exclamation points (error symbols). I'm not sure if any of the other dlc is screwed up too, but this has led me to believe that they may be...Should I re-install it or what?"
,Mehw,2009-12-26T16:16Z,"Zetoss, how am I supposed to put this on a dvd when one is 4.7 gb

and one of the files is 5.5? Help is appreciated."
,Mehw,2009-12-26T16:46Z,"meh, i got it to run with DTl, but everytime it says it's going to check my video settings it Says Fallout Launcher has stopped working. HELP ME THIS IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING I'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE CHRISTMAS EVE TO PLAY"
,cooleo45671,2009-12-27T07:54Z,"I tried downloading a seperate point lookout, and that screwed up too. Oh and disregard when I said that this was just ok. It's a great torrent, and worked fine for me. And, janieushouk, I got it working on my vista 32 bit..."
,Zurenriri,2010-01-11T04:36Z,"TPB seems to be having issues, and torrents.thepiratebay.org seems to be down, so I can't download. Anyone have a mirror link? -___-;;"
,o0banky0o,2010-01-11T16:20Z,its rar'd because newsgroups use udp and its considered unscenely to change a release and re-release it.
,o0banky0o,2010-01-12T00:59Z,"(many rars are easier to make repair files for, fyi)"
,BudiniZe,2010-01-13T18:51Z,thank you a guy who dosnt take the piss by putin read me or that shit and a load of other crap on just to make it harder thanks dude ur a legend
,mathias_the_damned,2010-01-13T23:06Z,"this download is full of rar files dude, wtf how am i supposed to use this shit? there isnt even an iso file is here!!!"
,Zetoss,2010-01-15T23:06Z,"HEY EVERYONE!

Hope as many of you as possible are enjoying this torrent, I just want to say that in a few moments my Vuze will have uploaded a total of 200GB to this torrent alone. There should be plenty seeds by now so I'm celebrating by no longer having this on forced seeding.

For everyone displeased with the torrent/speed/me/their life... Fuck off! Because I don't give a shit! :D

The rest of you; play on 'til you can't comfortably leave your real life house without something to kill the ferals with. This game is epic. Enjoy."
,Shanaloli,2010-01-20T05:04Z,"Thanks greats torrent, works fine for me :) "
,Shanaloli,2010-01-20T05:09Z,"Oh, and for people who don't like deamon tools, mounting or burning to discs, very very simple, download Power or Magic Iso, open the Iso file, make a folder on your desktop, extract all files to that folder, hit the setup exe file job done, delete folder from the desktop. 

Simple       "
,J0z3F,2010-01-25T22:30Z,"One of the best game torrents ive come across quick download, quick install

,lunchboxer,2010-03-11T03:59Z,"Thanks for the awesome torrent. Super fast download!

But, maybe I'm retarded or something?
I can't get the game to play. Every time I click to start a new game I just get an error message that says Fallout 3 has stopped working.
I'm using daemon tools, but I don't think really makes a difference. This is my first game that I've downloaded so I don't really know what I'm doing. Halp?"
,KD120,2010-03-25T01:35Z,"SOmeone please reply... 
If there are no RARs, why do you need winrar.. i have it but I don't know how to use it very well.....
Yeah, I know. I'm a noob."
