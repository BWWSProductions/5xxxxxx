Filipino (Tagalog) Learning Tips
Tagalog Learning Tips (Filipino)
In Filipino, most letters of the alphabet have only one corresponding sound, making learning to read easy. Vowel sounds are not combined in Filipino words. When two vowels appear together, each is pronounced as a separate syllable. For example, babae (woman) is pronounced as ba-ba-e. 
Filipino uses affixes, which are letters that attach to root words. Affixes determine the wordâ€™s meaning. For example: will eat kakain 
is eating kumakain 
ate kumain 

Learning prepositions is easy in Filipino since the language has only two prepositions, nasa and sa. 
Contractions are commonly used in Filipino. For example: pula na libro (red book) becomes pulang libro 
bata na lalaki (young male) becomes batang lalaki 

Filipino speakers employ polite speech when conversing with strangers or elders. Use of the word po or plural pronouns in speech are common ways to show respect. 
When asking a question that can be answered with â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜no,â€™ speakers use the question marker ba. Rosetta Stone will teach you how to use this important word in asking questions. 
In addition to learning the Filipino words for numbers, you will learn the Spanish words for the numbers one through twelve, which are used in telling time.
