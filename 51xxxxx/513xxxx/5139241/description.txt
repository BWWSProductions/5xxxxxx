Nova: Family That Walks On All Fours
Aired: Oct 27, 2009 
 
An intense scientific debate has ignited around a quiet but extraordinary family living in rural Turkey -- a family with five adults who walk on all fours. Since bipedality has long been considered one of the defining characteristics of modern humans, such a discovery raises fascinating questions about genetics, society and the evolutionary history of our species. Is this the anthropological find of the millennium or simply a unique medical case? In this moving documentary, NOVA sets out to unravel the controversy and meet the individuals who have captured the imagination of scientists around the world.
