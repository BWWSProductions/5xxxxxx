A mysterious and persuasive figure is moving amongst the circles of San Francisco's political elite. When Jonathan Van Helsing and his team of vampire hunters come to town investigating a string of grisly murders and stumble into a virtual pit of blood-soaked horrors, they know it's only a matter of time before they come face to face with the master of the dark!

The most memorable instance of Dracula in comic books remains the 1970s Marvel series The Tomb of Dracula, which ran 70 issues with the same creative team. Now the same team is back with a fresh take on horror fiction's most durable character. This is the classic Dracula, brutal and unrepentantly evil, in the hands of the creators best suited in portraying the most evil of all vampires. The Curse of Dracula is Dracula done the way Wolfman and Colan have always wanted to do it.
