The are two factors to be considered in this upload:

1) The source for subtitles I used is quite accurate. However, I found the length of the video for the first episode is shorter than the subtitle file by about two minutes. This means the video has been edited--shortened. The amount removed does not affect the story significantly, and I did not investigate further.

2) Most of the movie appeared dark--too dark. I lightened it slightly.



Once again I have had to resort to peculiar name changes in order to get around

Pirate Bay's censors.  They would not allow me to use the straightforward name

in a civilized way: "Aleady this torrent is in the system," they said. Poor chaps.
 
They don't realize I'm arranging things better for the viewer.
