Release Notes:

Cosmic Egg captures another kind of insanity. Following up Wolfmother's
multi-platinum first offering wasn't easy, but Stockdale was up to the
challenge. The singer and guitarist created a powerful and poignant
rock n' roll record with all the ingredients of a modern classic. From
the unforgettable riffs on "Pilgrim" and "Sun Dial" to the infectious
hook on "New Moon Rising," Wolfmother have crafted their masterpiece.
Instead of simply nodding to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, Stockdale
turns the formula upside down and gets more progressive this go-around.

Deluxe edition including extra tracks.
