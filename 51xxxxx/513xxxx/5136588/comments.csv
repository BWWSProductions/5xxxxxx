,jerm4ny,2009-12-03T16:04Z,After playing this a couple of times Ad-Aware found Win32.Trojan.Spy in the game directory.  Could've come from somewhere else but just FYI.
,huntermckiller,2009-12-04T21:13Z,"Apparently I'm missing ""d3dx9_41.dll""

Help?"
,huntermckiller,2009-12-05T11:54Z,"Ok, I just googled and downloaded the dll and placed it in the binaries folder and it worked. 

Seems odd that it was missed during the install."
,Halfbrother,2009-12-06T22:31Z,"it works 100% its to bad he didnt put instructions for all you idiots who download cracks and dont know  how to put it in. heres the instructions=D

1. download it 
2. extract it to your desktop or to a folder using your winrar/or extractor device.
3. install it. 
4. open the crack folder and put the files from the crack folder in to 2kgames\borderlands\bineries and replace the old one. then if you try luanching it should load. if you get an error when it is loading, then try rebooting your computer. i spent hours trying to fix it and all i had to do was reboot. 

100% works! we need alot of seeders. + works online! good torrent!"
,panzer_uk,2009-12-11T13:59Z,extracting it now ;) will post outcome shortly.
,panzer_uk,2009-12-11T15:05Z,"Ok update.

All extracted ok no errors, game runs no errors and no files missing.

However, the game isn't for me, very much cartoony. thanks to the uploader and the seeders."

,Sieyk,2010-01-13T15:55Z,"i encountered a bunch of problems which were easily fixable (dll's wrongly moved files etc)

but now im stuck

whenever i load up, nothing happens then BOOM!

""This game requires at least Shader Model 3.0""

is there a way of fixing this without replacing parts (im on a laptop so i cant), ive updated the drivers, nothing came out of that, i couldn't find a program that bypasses it, so i have no idea...

any help would be greatly appreciated :)"
,Chabs232,2010-01-14T17:25Z,Shit... Can't patch that version because it's digital... Sucks man...
,MilanJosic,2010-01-15T03:21Z,how good does your comp have to be to run this game?
,MilanJosic,2010-01-16T00:07Z,"ok this is how you find
2kgames\borderlands\bineries 
go to start and in Search type C:/ then  click on 1 search result
go to program files
2k games
Gearbox sofware
BorderLands
and finally Binariers
hope that helps"
,Saybut,2010-01-19T20:43Z,"Okay, I will see if this torrent works. Would be great if it did cause I've already tried two other torrents for borderlands and none of them working."
,Clawblade,2010-01-31T11:21Z,"i have downloaded it, played it, fucking nice game

anyone know a fix?"
,Clawblade,2010-01-31T11:22Z,"BTW, dont complain about seeding, im dling at 800 kb/s"
,Clawblade,2010-01-31T11:26Z,"@siejk

yep, ur videocard is not good enough, and no, it cannot be fixed without changing parts.
thats the big downside about laptops :P

so, get a new laptop/pc, or just try and find a way to get a new graphics card into that laptop of yours"

vad kan det vara för fel?"
,tooclever,2010-03-09T10:15Z,Unable to install on Vista 64 bit. Unable to run .exe file in Windows XP. No proper instructions. What a waste of time and download.
,g0tvtec,2010-03-12T05:25Z,"Ok I have no idea where the crack files are located. Is it located in the ISO itself? If not, where is it located??"
,Apakal,2010-03-24T23:47Z,"The Crack is in the ISO. 

Go to My Computer and explore your virtual drive that you have the ISO mounted on. The crack will be there.

Copy the crack to the Binaries folder of your Borderlands install and you should be good to go.

I'm running on Vista 64 with no problems, all 3 DLC packages included. RELOADED is supreme!"
