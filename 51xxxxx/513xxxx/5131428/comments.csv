I've only just found out that they are collecting money as a limited company and are not a charity. 

They can use the money for whatever they like. They are not using it to find Madeleine (as they know she cannot be found) but they are using it to try to censor anyone who speaks against them. 

Hundreds of thousands of pounds spent with the scummiest solicitors on earth such as Carter Ruck (search on Wikileaks for Trafigura), and dodgy detectives. 

I wonder whether Gerry should have a Paypal - Pay Now button tattooed on his forehead, because this is all about raising money for them, whilst defiling the memory of their daaughter.

Vive le internet - they cannot shut us all down."
