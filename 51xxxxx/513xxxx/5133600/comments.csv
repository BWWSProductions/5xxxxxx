This one here loks like a straight-to-DVD film and I can find no info or critiques on it. Probably not so great, but who knows?"

,TheKhenke,2009-10-24T18:21Z,"OMG! This movie is a MUST see!

This movie is so bad that I can say it is impossible to make anything worse.

See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1479847/usercomments as it sums it up pretty well.

It's so bad I could not stop watching. It's not bad in the way that you laugh, more like your shocked how bad a movie can be."
,jabunk20,2009-10-24T18:48Z,why dont you upload this without the winrar shit  this damn is the slow download that i have done i will keep seeding

,fffd,2009-10-25T00:01Z,"And it wasnt to critisize you Murlok.. You did a great job uploading this movie. That someone takes the time to make this available for the mainstream is great.  I only thought the movie itself was a ""bit"" bad.  Anyway, keep up the good work, I like this kind of movies, just not this movie..  ;)"
[V],Murlok,2009-10-25T00:29Z,fffd  NP :)
,zen-TAO,2009-10-25T02:50Z,"Hey People,
avoid this movie like the plague!

The reason why its over 7.000 seeders is
because you people dont check out what
you DL. 

This is a Asylum-movie, and that
says it all for those of you that know what
you are doing...

But its a free world and you do what you
want with your own time...

Peace and LOve!

,110777,2009-10-25T23:03Z,"This is truly a piece of shit, avoid at all cost, acting is semi bad, but its the effect and the HUGE plot errors, and complete lack of anything bound in realism, that really kills it completely.
Only watch this movie with lots of friend and beers, oh so many beers.

,dwnwrd,2009-10-27T00:38Z,"Thanks to the uploader for seeding a quality file and taking the time to post this.

That said, the studio, producers, director, and actors should be ashamed of themselves. This movie is terrible."
,sateef,2009-10-27T12:07Z,why are people still download and seeding this when there seems no doubt its utter shit?
,apollge,2009-10-27T12:14Z,"@sateef

,happynick,2009-10-28T10:06Z,"lol... do not waste any harddrive space...one of the worst movies I`ve seen. No I changed my mind, watch it... so you will get a new bench mark in the category ""worst movie of all time"""

,mistergroenevingers,2009-10-31T01:22Z,"PEOPLE DON'T LET YOURSELF GET SUCKERED INTO DOWNLOADING THIS PIECE OF CRAP MOVIE!
this isn't what you are looking for
it is by far the worst movie i have ever dragged myself through
i figured with a couple of thousand seeders it would be something but unfortunately it turned out to be some fucked up piece of crap
it has to be said though that it is actually quite an accomplishment to create a movie that is THIS bad
literally every aspect of it sucks, script, screenplay, casting, acting, even the special effects are crap
FUCK THIS SHIT
i can't believe i wasted my time downloading and watching this
to the uploader, sorry bout all this coz i'm usually very appreciative but fuck you in the ass with a big hard dildo for uploading this"

,mistergroenevingers,2009-10-31T23:16Z,"fuck you smoothice
the whole world is waiting for 2012 made by the guys that made The Day After Tomorrow, not this piece of crap movie from Asylum (who by the way do nothing else but making crap movies and naming them almost identical as the blockbuster originals)
there's no way that thousands of people are genuinly interested in this movie, ergo, the people seeding this have all been had
everybody who's invested their time in viewing this movie says its a fucking load of crap
i'm just warning the rest of the world for this by writing my comment
do you have any idea how much internet bandwidth is wasted worldwide by all these people seeding and leeching this shit?!?
in my opinion the uploader is largely responsible for this and you are too you smoothice motherfucker"

i f**king hate it when people try to gain souls for their sites with these kind of comments
besides that, the fewer people get to watch this f**ked up piece of crap junk movie the better"
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-01T12:33Z,"murlok, i may have been a lil harsh on you in one of my previous comments
i sincerely apologize for that, i was just soooo pissed off at the time
obviously sharing stuff via torrents is a very good thing so i'm sorry i said what i said
that having been said, i stick to my opinion that this movie shouldn't have been seeded because it's a wast of bandwidth for everyone
lots and lots of people get fooled into thinking this is the Emmerich movie and are wasting their own time as well as other peoples time"
