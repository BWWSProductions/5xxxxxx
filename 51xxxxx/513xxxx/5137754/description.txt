This is not your usual, blurry, 10 year old 5 minute clip from bestiality sites
with fat, ugly women... this is a full length, high quality japanese unagi porn movie with crystal clear sound, crisp image, live eels and cute girls.
If you're into this kind of shit (like me), you'll love it.

If you want another movie, ask me.
I have almost all of them.

The Eroticism of Eels

An extremely thick eel with a dark, oily lustre. What, I thought, if it was inserted into a vagina? I made this film to answer those questions. I'd never handled eels or loaches in my life. But I tried my best to film it, despite being frightened by their strange squawking. People still ask me whether the image on the cover is CGI. I can assure you it's genuine and alive. This film single handedly determined the direction of the Genki label.
