From the creators of Space Cruiser Yamato, this controversial series was one of the primary forces in the launch and growing popularity of the "erotic grotesque" genre of Japanese anime. Fast-paced and with excellent animation, the gritty, often disturbing series features apocalyptic battles, enslavement, sexual depravity, demons and desperate grabs for power by some of the most disturbing characters to hit the screen.
