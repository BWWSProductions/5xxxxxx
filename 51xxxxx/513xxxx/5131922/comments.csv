,ripripboy,2009-12-03T08:18Z,u guys having problems with the game have one solution...never download tptb games ...they are noobies and half of their games crash midlevel or have audio and video problems and have very basic or no compression....look for other repacks or fullrips...or dld the iso...that way u'll be sure ur not dldin shit uploaded by  a group of fags with god complex.

,sergnechaev,2010-06-19T21:42Z,"guys, if it doesn't work for you, you can try the following fix: there are a bunch of IMG files in the root folder of the installed game. take them and place them all in a new folder entitled img. then the game should start."
