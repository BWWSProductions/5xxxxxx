DVDx : the most complete DVD ripping solution ever !

What can DVDx do ?

* DVDx copies DVD movie to VCD, SVCD, DivX, AVI or WMV in one step.
* DVDx has been designed as a simple and intuitive program especially for unexperimented users.
* DVDx produces high quality MPEG and AVI movies and advanced features provides smart settings for experimented users.

Why DVDx is the fastest DVD backup solution out there ?

* DVDx is likely the fastest solution ever to copy a DVD into a DivX file because the DVD reading (and decrypting) is done while encoding to DivX.
Alternative solutions require to copy the DVD to the hard drive with DVD Decrypter
(or SmartRipper or any other DVD ripping software) which takes about 30 minutes, and then the encoding time is added.

So with a 75FPS encoding speed for a 1:30 PAL (25FPS) movie, the total ripping time of alternative software is 1 hour.
While DVDx will take less than 32 minutes (at 72FPS).

DVDx Ultra Edition can copy protected movies while standard version can't.
