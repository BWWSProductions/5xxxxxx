The Omega Sessions is an EP recorded in the early days of hardcore punk and reggae pioneers Bad Brains in 1980. It contains five early versions of songs that eventually appeared on later releases, including a reading of "I Against I," which would not be released in its official format for another six years.

The demos were remastered in 1997 and released in November of that year by Victory Records. This record was released as a CDEP, a 10" vinyl record with limited pressings on red, green, and yellow vinyl (1000 of each), as well as en even more limited 8" picture disc. All versions of the release included two previously unseen photos by Glen E. Friedman from the time of the recording. All design, and handwriting, was by Sean Bonner.
