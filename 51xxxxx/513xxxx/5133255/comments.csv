[T],verifire,2009-10-23T17:20Z,"Oops.. Sorry.. Didn't know I didn't. Smooooth now, huh..? :-) Sorry.."
[T],verifire,2009-10-23T17:23Z,"And thanks ""ThePif"" for the IMDB. It got lost somewhere while trying to upload the vid.
""Now you see it, now you don't""-thing.. It's there now, though.. :-)"
,uffesnuffe,2009-10-26T17:02Z,Thanks for the upload. But before  I start downloading I would like to know the level and method of compression. www.discshop.se says that the movie is 188 min long which usually is a lot for a DVD5.
[T],verifire,2009-10-27T20:54Z,"@uffesnuffe: Yes it is rather a long movie, isn't it? But it's a really good movie.. [DVDshrink is your friend] :-)"
[V],neon,2009-11-03T10:40Z,Hey buddy...thanks for the upload it's a good movie...big file but worth downloading :o)
[T],verifire,2009-11-12T12:08Z,"Well, hi there, catsout! Long time.. How's things? :-)"
[V],neon,2009-11-15T13:17Z,"things are good verifire,as you can see they gave me a skull(not really my colour but im not complaining)...im downloading moses with ben kingsley cause he's an awesome actor and im sure i'll comment on it."
[T],verifire,2009-11-17T00:05Z,"Yeah, I see they've endorsed you with a pink scull. I've never gotten one, but then again, what would I do with it? As long as I'm able to upload and comment (Rather do more of the first and less of the other, not including this ""comment"", though.. :), I won't complain or ask questions. Great to see you anyways and that life's looking out for you!
[Hah! Ye' know what I mean.. Harr harr..]

And comment right along. There's many things to like and dislike about most things. My favorite in this series is ""Abraham"", though. Think R. Harris fits the parts of old patriarch so well in his movies. Yeah this one's definitely a gem..

See ya later!"
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T19:52Z,"Hey, catsout! Look!
""..I've got a sku-ull, I've got a sku-ull..""
Now I've got some heavy credibility. Now I'll start really bossing around.. LOL :-)"
[T],verifire,2011-02-13T03:41Z,"..And then, of course, NeonKitty got a green skull.. I'm thinking that one is well deserved too... 

'grats.. :)

[What's next? Blue? With oak leafs and sabers? LOL]"
