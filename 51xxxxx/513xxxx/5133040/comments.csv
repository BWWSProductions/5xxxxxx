,pystdante,2009-10-25T07:37Z,Thanks Alot Sunblock. You the man!!
,sammaful,2009-10-25T12:09Z,thanks alot sunblock and big thanks for the info found it quite helpful
,pystdante,2009-10-25T17:48Z,"@ Sunblock. I can't get this to work correctly, I am not a newb, I burned it on IMG burn twice, had all defults set (I usually use clonecd for da games), It asked if I wanted the data on first layer only, said yes, put it in xbox, displayed 'Play dvd', swapped it with tekken 6 and it also just says 'play dvd'. I have iE 1.6, does it work on all drives? I think i have a liteon, Id have to open my box to check, and abgx verified the game, any suggestions?"
,FigNuts1017,2009-10-26T06:17Z,"So let me get this straight.

The waveX detects if the game is pirated or not, right?

If this is the case, say for example, i pop in a bad game. Does my system get bricked, or am I just banned from xbox live?

I am asking this, because I don't play xbox live. I only play offline, but I don't want to put in a game that isn't protected, if it bricks my system.

Please help!"
[T],Sunblock.,2009-10-26T19:37Z,"@pystdante

Activate iso shows up as a moive.

@FigNuts1017

Yes wav is some of check it do to prevent bad games. If read the hole text here you see the answer to u question.

Now, its important to remember that iXtreme was designed to PROTECT you and part of that protection is the ""video partition"" check. When this video partition changes, the firmware doesn't know if its just a new ""wave"" or if its a bad rip and thus opts to not boot it.

YOU must make sure that the game u going to use ""activate iso"" are verified with abgx360 ( i mean 1.0.1 (wave4) ). It should be the same as safe as it was with out the iso.

""READ VERY CAREFULL BEFORE YOU USE IT!"" was the deal here :D."
[T],Sunblock.,2009-10-26T19:38Z,and yes 1.0.2 is not out get. So by 1.0.1 is not safe as i understan becuase it dont support wave 4.
[T],Sunblock.,2009-10-26T19:43Z,"It should be 1.0.2 not 1.0.1.  :D. The 1.0.1 do not support wave 4 and by trying verified with 1.0.1 makes it unsafe. This what i heard.

Clear now i think :D"
,pystdante,2009-10-28T04:06Z,"I am still not getting it to work, when i insert the boot disc, it does come up as a dvd movie, am i supposed to wait for it to just 'see' the disc Or do I 'play' the dvd movie and then swap discs? or maybe I have a bad burn of tekken?"
,pystdante,2009-10-28T04:14Z,And I am running iE 1.6 with a lite on

,jdoggg211,2009-10-31T04:55Z,"I was banned from xbox live today!  i think it was because i copied forza 3 to my hard drive the day before it was released (i know, what a stupid idea, didnt think they checked though :P ), and yes ABGX checked out fine.. anyway i have a samsung with 1.51, will this boot disk work for me as well?  I wanna play liberty city stories...  also, if i buy a new console and copy over the hard drive, will that get my new xbox banned as well?"

,Benne5925,2009-11-05T02:42Z,HEEELP!! what the heck should i do when it says i need an update to play the game. i tryed say no but then i can not play. then i tryed yes and it just keep asking me to update. PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ HELP!!!
,pystdante,2009-11-06T01:36Z,"@ xixaw Are you using HDMI? if so, often the xbox will reset when swapping discs, try using a/v cables instead"
,johndabomb44,2009-11-06T21:52Z,"Okay, now let me get this straight.

Step 1: Flash my 360.

Step 2: Download game 

Step 3: Burn activate.iso on a SEPERATE disc.

Step 4: Burn downloaded game on SEPERATE dual layer disc.

Step 5: Put activate.iso disc into 360. Wait for 360 to say ""Play DVD"" then eject activate.iso disc and put in the actual downloaded game.


Is their ANYTHING else im missing? I am new to doing this and I dont feel like fucking up."
,MaxerMax,2009-11-07T03:36Z,"Yeah, I have a Liteon and I was banned yesterday... Maybe it was Forza, I played it after the release date for a couple days, didnt like it so i went back to madden for a few days and randomly got banned... weird"
,scooter96,2009-11-07T04:52Z,someone please help    I have read everything here and i am still having a problem.  I put in activate disk it starts then it says to play this put it in an xbox360 i take it out and put in wave 4 game and it still thinks it is a dvd
,MaxerMax,2009-11-07T17:36Z,"Yeah, I'm having problems too, I burned the Activate disc and it seems to work fine but as soon as i put in a wave 4 game it plays for like 2 mins then i get a disc read error at a loading screen... I've tried Dragon Age Origins and Lego Rock Band and both have the same result... and I've never burned a coaster before so the chances of 2 in a row seems slim to me"
,DiGiTaLdIsCiPlE,2009-11-13T01:38Z,"Ok so I'm having issues as well, please help!

Running iE 1.6

I burned my Activation disk per instructions with ImgBurn, on a single layer, on DL disk.

I also have a Dragons Age:Origins and I checked it with abgx360 and everything was fine.

So I put the Activation disk in 360 and it boots up a screen saying ""To play this disk, put it in a 360 console"" (and then on and on in other languages). So I press A to bring up the dvd menu and then when I open my tray to swap disks it goes back to dashboard. When I insert game it just stays on the xbox logo. Can anyone please help? It seems others are having the same issue.

Also, I using AV cables and not hdmi.

On another note,  I GOT THIS TO WORK BEFORE I WAS BANNED ON MY MAIN CONSOLE, NOW IT DOES NOT, but the swap method DOES work on my other modded elite that has not been banned, but it hasnt been updated in a few months either, it has not been connected to the internet. So I am starting to think I downloaded some update before I was banned that prevents the boot disc working!-------------- @ Wave10 - you are correct, MS teamed up with punkbusters and they can detect the firmware now.........If anyone else had this boot disc working and now its NOT, please make a post! Long Live Pirates!"
,pystdante,2009-11-21T20:50Z,"@ markied20 - the region only matters if you are NOT playing on a lcd, plasma, led, etc. Different countries have different resolutions that wont display on your countries standard tv, but it doesnt matter if you have a hi def set and are using HDMI "

You use Abgx360 to se if its safe.

You use Activate Iso that is burned to a dual layer dvd +R. (Do you have to burn on both layers?)

You then insert the burnd game dvd dual layer +R (Do you have to burn on both layers?)

And then it should work if you have Ixtreme 1.61

,wtmp2,2011-03-17T20:23Z,"This totally worked for me! But not for the ap2.5 games like CoD BO. Works for Bulletstorm and Homefront so far. That's the only games that say ""Play DVD"" when I insert them. THANKS A LOT!!

,ogrev,2011-04-23T04:36Z,"Does your 360 still need a mod chip for this to work, or is this a software mod you can use instead of a chip?"
,shehzaan,2011-04-23T11:10Z,can this make xbox 360 slim also work fake games?
,funkifreshstylee,2011-05-14T19:31Z,"@johndabomb44: I would also like to know that too. and your comment was worded in such a way that I trust you'll have the right answer after I ask (maybe a stupid question): what is ""flashing"" the xbox? (step#1) I can't really get a straight answer... .thx"

,Yoobenne,2011-05-24T23:45Z,"I just Updated my Xbox 360, and after that the Activate-iso don't work any more. every thing look normal but the game allways comes up like  ""Play DVD"" what's up?"
,samljer,2011-06-20T03:22Z,"This file should be removed from existance, its too dangerous and not required anymore.
Users should just update to 1.1 or 1.9 for LT
and keep thier DVDs proper.
even on a banned console this is a headache. just do a quick update to IX and finish it."
,chronjohnson,2011-07-22T22:25Z,"How dare you say this file should be removed, didn't you read the description?  Anyone who uses softmod tactics to boot discs on a 360 is an ""idiot"", therefore you are all idiots, not getting this file makes you an idiot, reading the description makes you an idiot, having an opinion makes you an idiot, etc.  Gosh, you're such an idiot."
[T],whodathoughtit,2011-07-24T01:25Z,"I have read a load of comments and still dont know if you need to flash, softmod your xbox 360

could someone please clear this up

Does this disc allow you to play coped games without flashing your xbox 360?

please help"
,marsh000,2011-08-09T18:05Z,You still need a modded 360 this is just for older version of the mod because people were to lazy or dont know how to update it.

,junaid.kh,2011-09-29T10:46Z,Can i use Activate ISO to play xdg3 games?
,Hicks,2011-10-07T15:03Z,"No, this won't make your xbox play xgd3 games. You need ixtreme 2.0 for that."

,steelllynx,2011-10-30T20:37Z,"FYI, I have burned and played over 50 games with the help of TPB here and never needed this for anything.  You probably don't need it for anything either."
,misspaperwait,2012-03-30T02:44Z,"hi, i have an older xbox360 that was modded years ago already, it's hard modded not soft and the burned games used to run fine. I have an activate iso disk also from a couple years ago and up until recently i never had a problem running any of my games now all of a sudden when i put in a game it reads as a dvd even after i put in the activate disk. I got your DL and burned it following your instructions and when i put it in the xbox it won't even read it as a dvd it just says open tray. Did i do something wrong or do i need special firmware for this to work or what? any help would be greatly appreciated"
