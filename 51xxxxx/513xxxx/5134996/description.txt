Born to a young woman driven to insanity and black magic by the deaths of her previous children, the 13th Son is a creature like nothing this world has seen before. Humans are not his target. It is the other monsters who walk this world-the wendigo, werewolves, ghouls, zombies, and vampires-who live in fear of his enormous and terrifying powers. And what those powers are setting into motion is a horror beyond your deepest, darkest nightmares.

Written and illustrated by Kelley Jones (Batman).
