well it works....BUT it doesn't want to accept the lock combination in the first god damn level, even though I know it's right...so I don't know if it's uploaders fault because of the cracks ""side effects"" or if it's the developers fault for releasing a broken game

oh and the second time I tried to play the level, the texture for the tv is missing...wtf?"

i tried to play this game, extracted and all, put the crack in.
But when i try to boot the game, my pc loads for a sec and then nothing happens.
How is this possible?"
,theduchboy,2009-10-26T11:08Z,"O never mind, i already found it.
It was the directx.
So if you have problems with the game not booting up, go to where Saw is extracted and look for the folder DirectXRedist.
In here you will find DXSETUP.exe.
Run the installation and there you go!
Now you can play :D"

the problem is PhysX go to PhysX folder and install it EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE A NVIDIA CARD also install the DirectX thats in DirectXRedist folder

*IF you do not have sound:
go to control panel and sound options  you need to set your format to 24Bit 48000 Hz"
,diveb,2009-10-26T21:34Z,very shitty game!
,dr.vamp,2009-10-26T22:28Z,"** The solution for the no sound problem **
For Windows XP: 

Right click on the my computer icon and select properties. 
Select the Hardware tab and click the Device Manager button. 
In the device manager go down to Sound, Video, and Game controllers and click the plus sign next to it. 
Look for any devices that reference a Modem or Unimodem sound device. 
Right-click on this device and select disable. This device should now be disabled. 
and now the sound should work well!"

,miroca,2010-10-04T19:35Z,"Lol.
Okay, for those having trouble, I installed the game, and after trying to run it, it whined that it didn't had some ***.dll file. After getting it on the net, it still didn't worked.
So, I reinstalled the game yet again. Same problem persisted. Last resort, I rebooted he pc and voilÃƒÂ¡! game worked.

Though the efforts aren't worth wasting some neurons on...when people stated that the game sucked, I thought 'okaay, picky guys.' just like those thousands of people reacted like when silent hill shattered memories came out.

But after playing it, i came to discover that it was true all along. The game sucks terribily. why?

First, it gives you the feeling that this crap was rushed to hit some deadline (whatever it was).
Basically its all about graphics, because the game lacks a bit of 'humanity' in it.
If you're inside one bathroom block, and press 'open', you can magically appear on the other bathroom block nextdoor (major lulz, even games in the XIX century didn't had these weird glitches...or did they? hmmm).

Not to mention he combat style, which was designed to make the player always lose a portion/half/all of his life gauge. One could say ""okay, so the guy is 'slow', just like in real life"", but come on, when your life is at risk, who the hell takes 5 seconds between each attack?


If not for the gore and amazing mental/physical torturing gadgets and ideas, this game would seriously be a major-fatal-exteme-blowing mistake ever (unless there was another failure before this one that i don' know of).

I did not intend to make the game look back (but i think i really hit that score). I share the same opinion of the many people who said 'this game sucks', but when I read that one unique line, I did not understand why, because one line saying it sucks could mean anything. 

Basically positive is : graphics and sounds.
That would probably give a score of 2.5 out of 5, because, let's be honest gameplay is a lot more important than pretty shiny graphics."
,strixton,2011-01-26T18:03Z,"The game loads fine, but as soon as Jigsaw starts to speak at the first challenge, the screen is black, then when hes finished an arrow shows up and spins, but that is all I see.
