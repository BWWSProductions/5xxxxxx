,Shyressa,2009-11-25T01:10Z,"Exact same as the Imagine release. Video is dark at times and overly bright at others. Audio gets a bit tinny at times and a little distorted at others and they used a watermark in the middle of the movie on the audio track.

Around 54 minutes there is the same chuck of film missing as in the Imagine release.

Overall, there is nothing new to warrant downloading a torrent with much lower numbers."
