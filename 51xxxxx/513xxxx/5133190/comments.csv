You have to unrar the files till you got a CUE/BIN image, then mount it (ex. with Daemon Tools), install, and enjoy :)"

,4rror,2010-01-02T21:29Z,"Yeah, let's put a bin in split rar files in another rar files, with a bunch of links that no sane person will ever click. It will be, like, way cool. Old school, yo!

Did we learn anything since the warez sites of 1998?

Seriously, I downloaded, I looked, I refused to bother. I'll try this torrent next: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5231521/Machinarium"
,ma4kata,2010-01-08T14:06Z,"u have to unrar the sr-machi.rar and then mount it
Nice game 10x for uploading"
,TheMal,2010-02-02T20:28Z,This is by far the most obnoxious thing I have ever downloaded. Ever. 
,uhada8,2011-11-29T09:15Z,"I repeat my message from the other torrent, which had no seaders:

I download this only because I already bought the game (on http://amanita-design.net/) and my download link timed out. I recomment all to do the same, as Amanita Design don't make as much money as EA and the other big boys, and also their games are much cheaper and much more creative!"
