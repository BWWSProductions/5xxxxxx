[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-23T16:02Z,fume90: It depends on how many seeders you connect to and their bandwidth. When there is over 2000 seeders you can´t connect to them all and if your´e unlucky you only connect to slow ones. Check the settings in flashget and adjust how many seeders you can connect to. I have never used flashget so I can´t tell you exactly how to do it. i can´t promise that it will help but maybe...
,fume90,2009-10-23T17:01Z,which other program can i use...anyone better?

Yo welkom in de wondere wereld van digitaal stelen!
wat je doet is in het bestand wat je gedownload hebt kijken naar een map die er niet tussen hoort,
zoals een crack map het kan ook wel eens een reloaded map zijn of en andere naam van de kraker zoals razor1911 enz, 
in deze map zit vaak de ""keygen"" en cracked .exe file.
met de keygen maak je een installatie sleutel aan .
de rest van deze bestanden moeten verplaatst worden naar de locatie op je harde schijf waar je je spel installeert er bestaat altijd al minimaal 1 bestand met dezelfde naam als de crackfile .
op standaard install zit deze in c:\program files\\
met de crackfile omzijl je de securom beveiliging waardoor er niet meer gekeken word of het cd-tje er wel in zit.
ik geloof dat je er zo wel uit moet komen.
laat maar weten of het gelukt is.

Support the developers my ass, oh my god I dont even wanna imagine how pissed I would be if I had payed for this. 

Dont anyone tell me ""dont play it then!"" - because I know that with every new part of the PES series you need a couple of hours of playing to get into the new feel, new controls etc. - but I spent something like 20 hours on this game now, and IT'S SIMPLY A TERRIBLE BULLSHIT GAME, it feels like controlling a bunch of fucking retarded mongoloids on the field!!!

,Quantum12,2010-03-04T18:51Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."

the fucking controls
this game thinks (by default) i have an xbox controller and you can't possible change it!
this means you got realy fucked up controls...
the ab and xy buttons on the xbox controler ARE IN THIS GAME THE AB AND XY BUTTONS!!! 
your right (or left??) thumbstick are arrow keys, but i don't have a clue what the keys are for the right and left pumper or the other thumbstick...
this is just so cheap, let one of your many gamedesigner change the controls properly which will take a hour and this game could be great"

Anyway I got a question about the patches: If I download only the last released patch, will it include all the contents of the previous released patches, or should I install them one by one? If I need to install one by one, can someone tell me if they all work, or should I be careful with any of them? Thanks!"

,gyroscopic,2010-07-14T19:07Z,"Stop complaining about the controls, people.  It\'s free.  You want everything nice and easy?  Buy the game.  nPlus, it\'s not hard to use the settings file to reconfigure the controls the way you want.  And even though using a keyboard in place of a controller limits the number of buttons you can press simultaneously, you can still play the game normally with a little effort.  Mapping out the buttons and teaching yourself how to move your fingers to execute moves / plays takes only a little practice.nThanks l_c_f_c for a great upload."

your left with an iso 

mount it to your e drive or other drive

open my computer

look at E drive or other drive


install from there,


daemon tools creates a 'fake' cd drive to trick your computer into thinking you have the cd

anyway, copy the crack over the original logo
