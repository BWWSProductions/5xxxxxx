,cthrash,2009-11-17T21:40Z,Outstanding program. Many thanks to the uploader. I thought I lost everything to a virus but this program helped me to save nearly everything. It takes a very long time to do its thing but it really does work.
,sk11,2009-11-21T04:52Z,"Thank You so much !! With it I was able to save my external hard drive that I had been using for storing family pics and importnat docs. SAVED ME FROM A NIGHTMARE as I would have lost all kids pics :(

Will keep seeding so that it helps others as well."

,alex5309,2012-02-05T05:20Z,"Hi, this program worked great the first day (I was able to get my pictures from my corrupted hard drive); it was simple to use and clean of viruses.

However when I tried opening it up today a window would flash on screen for half a second and then disappear - the program would not work. Reinstalling wouldn't work and neither would redownloading. Many thanks to the uploader but please look into this matter if possible! :)"
