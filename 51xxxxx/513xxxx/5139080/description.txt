A compilation of grunge songs from the late 80/ early 90s. Most were released on Sub Pop but there are some on some volumes that came out on other labels.
If you like the Sub Pop compilations, you'll like these.
Sorry that there are a few songs that aren't perfect sound quality - some were recorded of the radio years ago.
There are 7 compilations in this series, none of which were released. They're all my doing in terms of compiling.
Therefore, I would appreciate some thanks for what I do.
