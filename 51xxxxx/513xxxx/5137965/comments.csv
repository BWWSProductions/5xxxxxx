,.dot,2009-10-28T10:43Z,"@simon200: Maybe because im dl Borderlands and other games, but i bought Torchlight esven in the pre-release sale.

So why dont you shut the fuck up and get ur brain to work. I got no problem with u dl any games, its ur decision. But theres a difference if u pirates a AAA titel from a major publisher (they already are rich and it wont hurt them really and most of the times they deserve it for how arrogant they are) and pirating a titel from a small indi publisher (if they dont get the money they will ""die"").

So before u start with this asshole behavior think and if u like it buy this game. Its only $20 and they offer u a free demo with 1h+ gameplay. Dont be a dick!"
,yeesnaw,2009-10-28T13:56Z,"ok, i havn't seen any problems, i guess this will be the first :S

,fjongybong,2009-10-28T16:19Z,"Havent downloaded this ;)


But to everyone saying this img dont work/ Coruptet i might have a solution :)

Might be cos this image needs the newest version of DAEMON TOOLS

Not PRO ! unless you bought it
els you gotta use DAEMON TOOLS
Light ;)

Then mount it with the little tray ICON
Then mount image and everything should be fine ;)

New images needs new software ^^"
,Mark_X,2009-10-28T17:33Z,it looks like diablo 3..nice
[T],Juan.Too,2009-10-29T07:32Z,"Awesome game!
+1 from me, bro!

I'm about two hours in and I'm at level 9, still in the first dungeon.  This game makes me remember why I loved Diablo so much.
Everyone should be playing this!

I have had a few weird issues, though (these seem to be problems with the game, not the upload).
About every other time I try to launch the game, I get the error message ""FAILED GAME CREATION"".  Apparently, this has something to do with the game not liking ATI graphics cards.
Also, when I get the game started, the display options are always out of whack no matter what they were set on in my previous session.  If I try to turn on AA, for some reason the resolution will default to the lowest setting.  If I change the resolution to 1600x900 (my native res) the game switches to windowed mode.
Weird stuff.
I always eventually get it to work - seemingly randomly - so it's more of an annoyance than a real problem.  And again, I think it has to to with the game not liking ATI.
I read over on the Steam forums that the devs are working on this, so I hope there's a patch soon.

Anyway, thanks again for the upload!"
,Flawlessjess,2009-10-30T01:47Z,Id buy the game but i have like 20 bucks to my name atm with no job

,ust2,2009-10-30T04:17Z," If you like the game, I urge you all to support the makers! They orignally created diablo/d2, yet have nothing to do with D3/Blizzard (trust me it shows.)

  D3 is a major letdown for us die-hard fans, it's missing so much that we loved the previous two for.. so stop waiting for it and give your money to the people who deserve it in the first place.

 ((and yes I plan to buy myself a copy, I'd just rather test it out to see that they did infact deliver what D3 was *supposed* to be.))"
,the-bit,2009-10-30T15:36Z,"im going to download this game right away :D i read almost every comment and im going to download it right away :D 

- thanks (for now) :D"
,Arrrrrrrg,2009-10-30T17:33Z,"seriously, if anyone was gonna buy the game they wouldn't do it because someone on pirate bay asked them to. I understand where you guys are coming from and all but seriously, I need my money for pot. the PC gaming industry was supposed to die from pirating 10 years ago but rite now I'd say it's even stronger then any console out now (name me 3 xbox360 exclusives you think are worth buying and I'll show you a frat boy in the mirror.) stop whining and let us steal crap guilt free thx! "
,bbpwnt,2009-11-01T05:09Z,"I will be downloading this just to try it out. If it's as good as it looks I'll certainly pay the $20 to buy it. I loved D2 and I'm so sick of MMOs waiting for D3 to come out so I will for sure support the makers of this game with my $20 if it's worth it. 
 Seriously though guys don't tell people NOT to download the game. It's hypocritical to say it's okay to download one game but not this one just because they have less staff. This is a torrent site after all. And I personally am sure I will buy this game officially later down the road just because I like it which is what I always do with games I enjoy.

And to the guy who said this;
And I quote ""rite now I'd say it's even stronger then any console out now ""

You are so fucking wrong. PC gaming is indeed dying. Not just because of pirating but because people are against having to spend so much money to upgrade their PCs to play what's on PS3s/Xbox 360s for half the price.(Console versus PC) 

PC gaming is at an all time low right now. I mean look just the other day the guys who are making Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2(Infinitry Ward) gave us PC version players a big fuck you by saying there'd be no dedicated servers and the only ones we can play on are PLAYER HOSTED and if the player leaves the game has to find a new host or it dies in 120 seconds. 

That's just one major blow but take a look at all the other PC games which are going to consoles now too. Valve used to be the PC gamer's heroes but now lately every game they put out is also on the console and more people are playing them on consoles(Xbox 360 actually) than on the PC. (Check out TF2 PC stats versus 360. Way more on the 360) which is sad because if this continues we'll be seeing the best games on shitty consoles sooner than later.

I'm not trying to turn this into a discussion on right and wrong or pc versus console but I just had to correct this guy since he is blatantly incorrect. 

LAST BUT NOT LEAST THANKS ESPACONSOLAS!"

thx~"
,Marenghi,2009-11-02T00:08Z,"@ bbpwnt

If that's true what you say about them not having dedicated servers for the next COD then that's harsh as fuck. The people playing it on line will be the only ones who buy it, and they're the ones that suffer! Silly games companies."

,k1n81k,2009-11-06T23:37Z,"I found a workaround for the update. Download the official 1.2 patch from runic and save the executable from this release. I have not tested this thoroughly but at least got the game to launch and loaded my previous save. there was a huge difference in speed and load time. anyways go ahead and replace the update executable with the one from this release and you should be ok till skidrow or whomever releases a patched executable of the new update. im sure doing this is not a perminant fix and there are some fixes you wont get. the 1.2 exe is 11mb and the exe from this is 9mb so they updated the exe as well. anyways try it and post your results.

ill update later after more testing "

,Greed18,2009-11-07T04:12Z,i like the game i downloaded a different torrent but i was wondering hoe to install this one
,k1n81k,2009-11-08T03:57Z,"ok so my ""fix"" did not work as well as i hoped or at all for that matter the game loaded in town but soon as i went through a portal it crashed. I tried to update before but was having login issues with tpb. anyways sorry if i got your hopes up.

from my digging around it looks like this is possibly a pre release version of the game or a hacked steam version of it. I am leaning towards the steam side because of the steam api in the dir. this is all guessing of course. but as of yet I have not actually found a ""cracked"" copy of the executable or patcher of any sort. so I am curious as to how this release came about. but so far the best results for load times and all that has been repacking the pak.zip. hopefully there will be a proper crack/patch for 1.2, though I am more then likely going to just buy the game some time in the next week or so. my only issue with relic is the licensing control system only allowing 10 installs. bot for $20 its not bad"
,Munkatten,2009-11-09T01:48Z,"Woot! Just bought it!

@dilsky just make a folder on your desktop, then right click one of the rar files from the torchlight folder and extract to the new folder you made!

,Arrrrrrrg,2009-11-17T08:15Z,"@bbpwnt

all I was saying is the PC gaming world is not dieing and it never has been. people have been crying about pc gaming dieing since the PS1 days. and guess what? it's still #1. 

sure you may or may not need to play COD p2p but I guarantee it will look 1000 times better on PC while you play it. and run much smoother.

 the fact is that you can get a graffics card that will make your PC able to play any game out there for 100 bucks. and 4gb of ddr3 ram will only set you back 60 bucks on ebay.

 sure, consoles are doing better, but they always have. that doesn't mean the world will stop producing games for PC. especially as consoles become more and more  like a prioritized PC. there are only a handful of games that are available only on consoles and almost every game available on ps3 and xbox360 is also out on PC (and now there starting to come out 2 months after console releases instead of 6-9months) assassins creed took about a year after consoles to come out on PC. assassins creed 2 is coming out in july or febuary on PC. game companies have been paying more attention to PCs rather then less.

I too don't want to start an argument I'm just trying to say that everyone needs to stop telling me to buy things I don't have money for for silly reasons.

with that said I will totally buy the FTP ""mmorpg"" as long as the mmorpg part stays in quotes. I would much rather have something like diablo where everything is instanced. mmorpg just says UO or WOW to me. and those games make my dick soft."

You will soon come to realize after that that this game has essentially nothing new to offer as you progress, and the repetitiveness becomes mind-numbingly boring. The quests are a joke. ""There's a beast on floor 21 that's reaking havoc, go kill"" ""there's a monster that no one can defeat on floor 22, go kill"" ZzzzzzzzZZzz ""go find shining ember and bring it to me""
