[V],bubanee,2009-10-26T09:31Z,Yes mate was released in australia on the 20th.. and when i have CDRip [Cov+CD] in the name it's REAL!
,thepostal,2009-10-26T14:22Z,thanks dude!
,TheBombio,2009-10-27T12:53Z,"Safe torrent.

It's the real deal.
Great quality (320).

The album was such an improvement over Lead Sails. Although that album was okay, this one brought back the old Atreyu feel and it was sure as hell welcoming. Absolutely fantastic album. Thank you."
,SuxXarD,2009-10-27T17:28Z,"Thanks!

Been waiting for this album.
Hopefully it's better than their last!

Been Atreyu fan since they released their first EP."
,bigsears77,2009-10-28T00:14Z,haha i feel bad downloading this cd. they deserve my money with how fucking great they are. but tough shit i'm broke START THE TORRENTING!
[T],zombifuzz,2009-10-28T04:53Z,"thats funny you say its legit because unlike every other music torrent i DL this one couldnt be accessed in itunes.  your cd was the only one that did that.  i dont care what nayone says, this is not the real official completed release.  ive been DLing torrents for like 6 years and i know real when i see it.  i burn cds and put them in itunes.  if the album information doesnt come up then it is not real to me.  sorry man."
[T],zombifuzz,2009-10-28T04:58Z,"2 minutes ago i posted a comment.  out of curiosity i did something ive never done before.  i saved the cd, rather than throwing it out after the info didnt come up, and sure enough after the official us release date it came up in itunes.  ive thrown so many cds away because i am particular with my music and thanks to this mistake (on my part and bubanee's torrent) i learnt that if i have patience and save the cd then put it in my itunes that the info might show up and it is a legit release.  i am apologizing for being rude to u and thanking u for your work on this torrent."
,Matt42,2009-10-29T03:06Z,"The bitrates are all around 300kbps, but the quality isn't so great for some reason...  I have 192kbps mp3s that sound better.  It's not bad though.  Seems like a great album, but haven't got through the all the songs yet."
,adamspike,2009-10-31T19:57Z,thanks good cd!!!!
,pwncakes,2009-11-02T01:30Z,"really good album. sounds like it picks up where death grip left off, rather than the more rock oriented lead sails."
,lastghst,2009-11-03T06:19Z,this is a great album i plan on buying it as soon as i get some cash i recomend every one else do the same if they realy like it the album artwork alone is almost worth the 12 bucks. i dont mean to be anyones consience but i realy love this band and want to support them any way i can.ATREYU!!!!!
,UnderWillis,2010-02-05T09:01Z,"I'm glad this download was well worth it because the speeds sucked. My downloads speeds ALWAYS range between 500kb/s - 2mb/s downloads. I didn't get above 80kb/s! But, good CD bubanee."
,xthecavex,2010-09-18T20:43Z,"good files and fast, didnt even take 1 full minute to download  thanks"
