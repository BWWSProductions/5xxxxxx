,GAZZA2008,2009-10-25T01:06Z,"must be a virus then.........?
maybe crashes your comp......?"
,biddaddy,2009-10-25T18:58Z,"Downloaded trouble free and plays well.
The Video and Audio are in sync  10/10 on both.

The film it self seems action packed.

No virus here. Watching it on tv as I type."
,5iF3R,2009-10-26T00:01Z,"...Downloading this movie is a waste of time!
Seriously folks, we've been had, the movie is seriously flawed. Worse acting is hard to find. Effects is a joke! Seriously, the car-chase scene in the beginning made me ?&#* angry... 

Whats up with the seeders? Is there like a cult meeting going on somewhere or what?

Blows my mind.. 'D' movie for sure!

There.. im done bashing it now."
,mistergroenevingers,2009-10-31T23:28Z,"i see that people haven't been leaving sufficiently bad comments about this movie here yet
so i will do the honours then

THIS MOVIE IS FUCKING CRAP!!!
THIS IS NOT THE BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
THIS IS A CHEAP KNOCKOFF MADE BY A MOVIE PRODUCTION COMPANY THAT DOES NOTHING ELSE BUT TRYING TO MAKE MONEY BY MAKING CHEAP KNOCKOFFS OF GOOD MOVIES

do not waste your or anybody elses time and bandwidth with this shit
this is by far the worst movie i have EVER had to endure watching
there are really no points to hand out for any aspect of this movie

ASYLUM SUCKS DICK!"
,OCbeta,2009-11-15T10:09Z,"morons.

2012, THE NEW MOVIE IS OVER 2 HOURS LONG.

THIS IS THE OLD MOVIE.
"
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-16T08:37Z,"old movie?
this movie is like a month old
they only made it so it would coincide with the big studio ""2012"" movie so they could make as much money as possible
bunch of cocksuckers with their crap movies"
,rocketero,2009-11-17T00:21Z,"can anyone give me an A/V ratio of this torrent movie?

I need at least 9/9 a/v to download it."
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-19T23:49Z,"why do you need that? can't you just download it and see for yourself? you're not on a connection where you have to pay for every bit you download i hope? if so, then do not waste your money on this crap, do something useful with it. i don't know what the quality of this rip is because i haven't downloaded this one. i'm just going around leaving negative comments wherever i find this movie because watching it is worse than having a catheter 70 cms up your intestines. just trust me on that one. or watch the movie and then take a trip to a hospital to find out for yourself. anywayz, seeing as it has to be a dvdrip because this movie has only been released on dvd, the quality of the rip is probably good. so enjoy... or not."
,mistergroenevingers,2010-03-04T03:12Z,why do people keep seeding this total piece of turd movie?????
,m0nkeymafia,2010-05-03T21:27Z,"Absolutely turd movie, grab the covers here http://www.coverdude.com/dvd-covers/3545-2012-supernova-2009-r1.html"
,mistergroenevingers,2010-05-19T03:34Z,Aaaaaaaaarrrggh!! Still too many torrents for this total crap movie!
,Diet_cola,2012-03-10T23:53Z,"Really,  all these people bitching over the quality of acting and the movie it's self. 

Sure might be bad acting,   Sure SFX might look like they been done on a ZX spectrum,   And yes the over all movie maybe a steaming pile of 3 month old donkey turd,  BUT

1 - its free
2 - some people (like me) enjoy asylum movies
3 - did I mention its free ?
4 - no one forcing you to seed
5 - no one forcing you to download
6 - most importantly ""ITS FREE"""
