From the time he played his first public recital at 14 (Liszt I believe - who he went on to despise), I don't recall anyone mentioning him ever making mistakes, seriously. I've watched a lot about him, most of the video of his playing. He was flawless, and could play thousands of the great works by memory, one-off, modifying them as he saw fit at times (much to the disdain of many purists). To be honest this guy made Horowitz look sloppy and unpracticed, and I say that in all seriousness, just to lend perspective to Gould's true virtuosity. "
