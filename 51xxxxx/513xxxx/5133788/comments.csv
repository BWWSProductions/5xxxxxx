,Kamui_84,2009-11-27T23:56Z,"Yes, I know. :-) Thanks.
But nobody wants to help me seeding. I can't seed this alone for ""all time"".
Seems that people are too selfish and don't understand how torrents work. :-("
,bioneo,2009-12-02T01:11Z,"wow great,

i will star this torrent just is download the next generation

thanks great work!!!"
,Mr-Rivet-Head,2009-12-07T03:32Z,"Holy jesus this will take some time to grab.. xD , 

I only have a 70lbps upstream but I'll do my best to keep this running whilst i dload"
,tureke,2009-12-07T15:15Z,"i think when it's done my great-great-great-great grandchildren would be the first to see it...
wayy too big"
,forumow,2009-12-07T20:22Z,"Kamui_84, when you intend to make a similar release of DS9?"
,Kamui_84,2009-12-08T07:19Z,"@forumow: Since I don't have any sources of DS9 yet, I can't create anything. Do you know, where I can get it (as (untouched PAL DVD ISOs) from?
Since buying all seasons of DS9 is really expensive, I have to wait till I have enough money for it. I will buy the first season this month. Maybe the 2nd and 3rd after Christmas. Dunno when I will have them all, but it will probably be in 2010."
,forumow,2009-12-08T20:27Z,"DS9 on DVD9 already laid out on the TPB, it seems it was a user [b]wormman[/b].
This torrent search [url]http://2torrents.org/search/list?filters%5Btitle%5D=Star+Trek+-+DS9+DVD9&filter=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%B8&filter=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%B8&sort=seeders&type=desc[/url] still gives information about it, before you can view details of saved pages, Google, but now the term storage has expired.
Perhaps one of these users swayed handing respond earlier and posted them again. Luchshe just lay out a pack of old torrent-files."
,Kamui_84,2009-12-09T01:44Z,"@forumow: Maybe there were such torrents, but now there is nothing like that. TPB user wormman isn't seeding DS9 in any form (at the moment).
The torrents found by this site/machine in your URL are more than dead, they are nonexistent:
Not Found (aka 404)
You're looking for something that does not, has not, will not, might not or must not exist ...
So there is still no source available."
,Stuart11,2009-12-30T16:07Z,Season 1 Disc 6 ISO Not Voyager it is The Oringial Series is this an error
,Stuart11,2009-12-31T12:12Z,Looks like Disc 6 is a Bouns Content Disc
,Kamui_84,2010-01-04T07:47Z,"As kef71 already said, disc 6 of season 1 is a bonus disc with episodes of TOS. You can leave it, if you aren't interested in it. Season 1 of Voyager had less episodes than the others, but was sold for the same price. For compensation, Paramount decided to add some TOS episodes."
,Kamui_84,2010-01-04T07:50Z,I got DS9 season 1 for Christmas and will upload it soon.
,Seedgood,2010-01-23T18:36Z,Oh god let me get this fast! Once download finishes I'll seed x3 (about 1Tb). My upload capacity is 30 Mbit (NOT kidding).
,Kamui_84,2010-01-30T21:43Z,@Seedgood: It would be great if you could help me permaseed this.
,pimpampet123,2010-03-02T09:24Z,"Epic upload! Thanks for being bold enough to go where no torrent uploader has gone before. Will help seed as much as I can (but this'll take a while to download, heh)!"
,DSCFS,2010-03-08T22:44Z,"So Epic!, im gonna have to get a Ekstra HDD while im Downloading this Torrent!, So awsome!, i LOVE the series, and for new im just gonna dl and se it ;D, not sure if i can wait tho, might just buy it xD, lets see how money farers this year :D.

Amazing Torrent!,Remeber to upload Folks ;D.
Shareing is Careing."
,amoghthegamer,2010-04-20T00:10Z,This is a great torrent but Iam not even going to ATTEMPT to download. 
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-01T14:40Z,small is different
,mcmanly,2010-05-20T15:03Z,Any chance of an .mkv or .avi of Voyager? These uploads are waaay to big.
,Kamui_84,2010-05-20T17:05Z,"mcmanly: These are untouched PAL DVDs. Some like to download it in best quality possible (you still can re-encode/shrink it later)...
Maybe I will encode all three series (TNG, Voyager, DS9) to MKVs some day, but not so soon (and these kind of torrents exist already - at least as AVI)."
,mcmanly,2010-05-21T10:01Z,Could someone please let me know how I can shrink them/recode them into another format?
,icelaw,2010-06-05T01:21Z,"Kamui_84:
No you see, no one is helping you to seed on your gigantic torrent, mainly because the complete Star Trek Voyager Serier is about 30 gb in size, 360gb is to much."
,xelaispwn,2010-06-22T03:22Z,"...this is the largest torrent on TPB right now. 

Holy god."
,PirateTopboy,2010-06-29T16:33Z,"By time I download this and will be able to watch it, I will be dead.

Oh and I am only 16."
,hasbeenhonshu,2010-07-01T18:47Z,"Three weeks of machine resources wasted trying to keep this torrent downloading. In the future I will avoid torrents this large like the plague. I finally gave up well into week three with only 24.3% downloaded. Yes I'm port forwarded correctly, etc., etc. Yes I have a lousy connection also, but something got hold of this download and made it impossible to finish; could not figure out what."
,Kamui_84,2010-07-03T13:50Z,"I currently see 12 seeders (I'm two of them) and 117 leechers (all with different progress) - that indicates the torrent is working, a few people help me seeding and everything is fine. ;-)
But if you have a lousy connection (small bandwidth), I discourage you from downloading that torrent.
Even with a good connection it may take a week or so. So think before you type - erm - begin to download..."
,jack.tremols,2010-07-20T15:49Z,"please Kamui_84 , could you ensure me that all the ISO-files are containing the french subs. Of course, everyone could answer me if he wants to. Thx"
,bioneo,2010-09-04T15:29Z,"please help me to seed this

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5788589/Star_Trek__Deep_Space_Nine_DS9"
,jack.tremols,2010-11-24T20:28Z,confirmed : no french in season 3 DVDs...  :(
,Kamui_84,2011-02-06T19:30Z,I have to gainsay jack.tremols: There are french audio tracks and french subtitles in season three DVDs too.
,danwat1234,2011-06-10T10:09Z,"So, does this  have non-removable french subs??

That wouldn't be cool.

To the people that think 350GB is too large, storage is cheap these days. 3,000GB hard drives are only $140."
,danwat1234,2011-10-16T21:44Z,"4 months later and I'm all done downloading!!
It has many different audio streams of different languages, with english as well of course.

Perfect!!

I just wish that Paramount would have released these DVDs as ""High Quality"" dvds instead of ""Standard Play"" ... standard play = ~4.7GB per 2 hours, high quality is ~8.5GB per 2 hours of video.
Same thing with ST:TNG.

BTW people, they are remaking TNG in HD!!
That will be one heck of a torrent and I look forward to it!

Thanks again uploader, I'll seed indefinitely, on and off."
,danwat1234,2011-10-16T21:53Z,"Well, i'll seed unless the 350GB TNG or DS9 torrent needs seeding more than this 1"
,Kamui_84,2011-10-25T08:17Z,"danwat1234: of course it has; see the torrent header and/or description...
Thank you for seeding, btw.

Hm... I just recognized that stashbox.org has gone, but I can't edit my torrent (the function is ""temporarily"" disabled)."
,fin2,2012-03-02T01:51Z,"I appreciate very much having an untouched DVD version of this show, but one thing I discovered is that the official PAL version is not near as good as the official NTSC version, due to how this series (and TNG and DS9) were produced.

The 3 shows all use 24 fps film for the live action scenes, and 30 fps interlaced video for all the special effects scenes. But when 30i is converted to 25i on the PAL version, the video becomes jerky and shows constant judder in all effects scenes. This is because 1/6 of all frames are *discarded* when they do this conversion for the effects scenes.

Does anyone have the untouched NTSC version of any of these series? That is currently the only version with the original non-modified non-corrupted content. I'm hoping that Voyager will get the HD treatment that TNG is getting, which would be the best of all worlds."
