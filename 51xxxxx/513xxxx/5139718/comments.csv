,rainingblood0187,2009-11-05T04:33Z,any info on quality?
,SystemFolder,2009-11-07T06:25Z,"I haven't downloaded it yet, but the first track calculates out to 297.511162 kilobits per second, so it's probably good quality."
,SystemFolder,2009-11-07T06:35Z,That's why it calculated out so weird. The first track is 304kbps VBR. In fact the whole CD is more than 298 kbps VBR
,barcode98315,2009-11-07T16:54Z,"great torrent! 

most songs seems to be about 310 kbps (VBR)
