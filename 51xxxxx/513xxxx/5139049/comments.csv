Due to the frequent, sometimes prolonged power outages in the area I've decided not to leave my computer on when I go to sleep anymore - my UPS is not as powerful as it used to be almost 3 years ago when I got it, won't last but a few minutes now.

But I will return and continue seeding it, and will continue monitoring & supporting it even after new seeds have been created.

So, please be patient, and
No Panic!
