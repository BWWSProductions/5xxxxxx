Hi,

This is an almost complete (I believe) collection of Mozart's Symphonies.
I'm not too knowledgeable in Mozart symphonic works lore, so I'll not go into it.

Let's state the facts I am certain of:

Conductor: Karl Bohm
Quality: Flac (lossless).

All organized in 10 discs (good for burning, but you may need the flac plugin for your CD burning software), with m3u playlists for WinAmp.

I hope you enjoy them as much as I did - Bohm is wonderful (and we try to forget his past as an enthusiastic Nazi party member), Mozart is, too : )
