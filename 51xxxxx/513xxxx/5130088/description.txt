Seventeen year old Calliope Crestone thinks life is hard, but it gets much harder when her parents move from Georgia to Oregon.  They move into a drafty old mansion on the ocean, and weird sounds haunt Calliope at night as her parents come and go to work in secret on scientific experiments.

Things seem to be looking up when she meets Octavius, a cute guy at her new school.  He loves her poetry and seems interested in her-- maybe a little too interested.  But how does Calliope's dad know Octavius, and why does he hate him?  And who does Calliope hear screaming at night?
