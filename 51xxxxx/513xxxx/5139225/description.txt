iFreeMem free's memory from the in-memory cache that accumulates with every file or application read from hard-disk.

The cache is good, but it can become cluttered with files you don't even need cached anymore that take up precious RAM.

Maximum free memory can sometimes be better than half your memory filled with old cached files.

If you are in the middle of using an application and the system becomes unresponsive for several seconds it could be the memory manager recovering cache memory for your application. 

iFreeMem optimise feature is a quick and easy alternative to either a reboot or RAM upgrade to get defragmented free memory.
