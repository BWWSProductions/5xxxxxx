What I don't understand is that a lot of folks will go and see this film, applaud it's creativity and feel all warm and fuzzy with the friendship theme, but ask them if they'd allow their 8 year-old daughter to be pen pals with an older man in another country and they'd think you're nuts for even asking this. They find humor and entertainment in something that happens to ""someone else,"" as long as it's not them. What a sick world."
