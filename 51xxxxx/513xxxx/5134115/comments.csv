""We can quantify the deaths caused by both communism and fascism, but we will never know how many deaths have been the result of capitalism; of nothing more noble than a rich man wanting to be even richer, and sacrificing the health and lives of millions of workers to achieve this. Don't even try to count how many people capitalism has killed, because not only will you not know where to begin, but also it will never end.""

In fact, this moron has so spammed this quotation all over the web, that putting it into a search engine is one of the best ways to find the best liberty oriented works around. How ironic, that what you meant to pollute liberty, can be used to find it. Suck on that!

,mattguitarman13,2010-04-09T11:37Z,"can't wait to listen to the download many thanks 4lib3rty, even after listening to this I plan to purchase a copy of the actual book just for the sake of support and lend-ability. maybe I'll send it to leniniststalinist, he might learn something. I don't blame him however it's easy to make an emotionally based judgment that lacks reason when your told by ""the experts"" that its for the ""good of the people."" LNS its a case of the little red hen, if i work hard and make the bread why should i give it to a lazy worthless fuck like you, make your own if you want it. no one wants to see anyone die, in a statist society an arrogant dictator kills those he deems unfit for his society, whereas with REAL capitalism everyone has a chance to live and prosper if THEY choose to do so. everyone comes across hard times to. in a statist society its all the time because everyone is forced to give what's theirs to everyone else and no one is ever compelled to do anything extra to help a needy neighbour because everyone is in the same boat. in capitalism some prosper some don't, a family hits hard times their neighbour is willing to reach out if that family holds value to them. simple point you can't have something from doing nothing, and if that's what you want leniniststalinist, then you have no sympathy from me when starve.
