PLOT

Vincent Ward weaves drama with documentary to unravel the
extraordinary story of Puhi, the Tuhoe woman who welcomed the
young filmmaker into her home in 1978. Ward made the
observational film In Spring One Plants Alone about Puhi's
day-to-day life in the remote Urewera Ranges. By then almost
80, she was obsessively caring for her schizophrenic adult son
Niki, whose violent fits terrified her. In this new cinema
feature Ward sets out to unravel the mystery that has haunted
him for 30 years: Who was Puhi?

And why was she so obsessed with this last remaining son?

Using his relationship with Puhi as the framework to explore
her life, he finds a woman of extraordinary fortitude who, at
the age of 12, was chosen by the great Tuhoe prophet Rua
Kenana to marry his son, Whatu. Rua gave her the name, Puhi
("special one"). At 14, she had her first baby while hiding in
the bush, having escaped from the 1916 police raid on Rua's
community at Maungapohatu, where she witnessed the arrest of
Rua and Whatu and the killing of Toko, Rua's other son, said
to be her lover

She would go on to have 13 more children. But by the time Ward
made his initial film, there were few signs of what had become
of them. In Rain of the Children, he finds out how the loss of
her children affected the course of her life. The tragedies
she lived through were so powerful that some, including her
believed she was cursed

After a tumultuous second marriage and the manslaughter of her
third husband, Puhi was left with her dependant son, Niki. She
dedicated herself to this man-child, trying to protect him at
all costs, even from beyond the grave

Rain of the Children is Ward's search for truth in the story
of a woman who sought redemption through love and who has
remained a touchstone for him throughout his life
