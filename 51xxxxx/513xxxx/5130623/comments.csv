,famemon78,2009-10-30T16:29Z,"Leandroo this is by far the suckiest job of seeding ive encountered on pirate bay ! no offence over a week and not a single disc has completed for a single person so far and now uve stopped seeding as well! Not to mention the fact that discs 4,5,6,7 have still not been uploaded :-( pity coz it was a great upload and a great many people were counting on u !"
,jbemms,2009-11-05T08:47Z,Cara vocĂŞ precisa de seed. Depois que eu abaixo eu deixo meu para seed atĂŠ esse torrent fica forte. Please seed this torrent so people can download it all.
,jbemms,2009-11-10T20:24Z,Please seed the upload. People please do not limit your upload to 1 kbps. It makes it almost impossible for others to get and please do not stop seeding when then download is done.
