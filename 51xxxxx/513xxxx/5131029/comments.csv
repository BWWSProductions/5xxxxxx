,FreeTibet,2009-10-23T16:35Z,"Wow, what a wanker Simon Posford turns out to be. I definitely won't be buying the album after reading that thread. And his fans seem like a bunch of pathetic tools, worse than boyband-obsessed teenage girls. LOLz"
,ciperlone,2009-10-26T10:58Z,"FreeTibet, you don't deserve that name. If you complain about simon's complainings, don't download the album. And, by your patetic words, I assume you are a fan of Simon, worse than boyband-obsessed teenage girls."
,FreeTibet,2009-10-31T01:15Z,cry me a river
,StrikerZ,2009-11-02T06:03Z,Buy the fucking album.  Shpongle is one of a kind; Well worth paying for.  Do you enjoy this music?  Support it...  I dare you to justify piracy in this situation.
,sir_realist,2009-11-03T14:10Z,I wait patiently for each Shpongle album to come out.  I'll be picking up a copy at my shop next time i'm there.
,cuntmug,2009-11-12T18:00Z,i think it's quite touching what posford says in that post. it actually makes me feel pretty bad downloading that album - or any form twisted records
,1337h4x0n,2009-11-14T10:22Z,"@StrikerZ: It's no less moral to download an album because StrikerZ likes it so much. If you love the album and you like spending money on music then go ahead and buy it, but don't attack other people who choose to download music torrents when you yourself have an account on the biggest torrent site on the internet."
,spunkster,2012-01-04T03:23Z,"FreeTibet, why don't YOU cry us all a river. Why the fuck are you whining about Simon and his fans, when you're here downloading his album, therefore you're clearly one of his ""pathetic tool"" fans?

Try hard to see beyond your own tiny, self-absorbed worldview. 
Precisely how many albums have you sold? None? Ok, then shut your fucking stupid mouth hole. Nobody cares about anything you have to say or ever will say. "
,spunkster,2012-01-04T04:02Z,Thank you satnapar! Exceptional rip. Much appreciated.
,HverGang,2012-01-19T19:09Z,"I have bought 8 Shpongle albums. That's right - some of them I bought more than once, and gave away because I think more people should hear their great work. Besides, I've listened to the 5 albums so many times it's well worth multiple times what they cost.

I'm downloading this anyway, just because I ""need"" MP3 format at the moment, and can't be bothered ripping the CD myself. ;-)"
,tweakmode,2012-05-25T22:22Z,"thank u very much for this satnapar!

as to all tha comments of hate plz GTFO. 

& thanks to Spunkster for puttin FreeTibet in his place."
