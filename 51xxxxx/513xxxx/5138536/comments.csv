We don't all have FiOS, ok?"
,darlakk,2009-10-28T09:58Z,"Argh, makin me actually buy the book, i must know!"
,Cloter,2009-10-28T16:04Z,Reducing number of upload slots maybe?
,-SPQR-,2009-10-28T16:48Z,"looks pretty much like a fake.
maybe a strategy to wet your tongue until you got enough of fakes :)"
,-SPQR-,2009-10-28T16:53Z,"some wrote its the real deal (at another site)
strangely no chapters, but who carez :)"
,-SPQR-,2009-10-28T16:56Z,"anyway, please make sure the company who made these receives some money from you!
After all its a very good job they did."
,Ticondrius,2009-10-28T17:30Z,"3 Seeders in the swarm now, I'm at 54.4% 13.5 hrs after initial seeding.

I copied the first MP3 to my desktop and listened to it, fragmented as it still yet is.  This IS the real deal.  I've heard bits from the Foreword up to Chapter 8.  I actually heard the narrator say ""Chapter 8"", so this is new material.

Download and enjoy.  :)"
,strongnc21,2009-10-28T18:26Z,Why no chapters?  :-(
,stackbv,2009-10-28T19:46Z,"This is 100% real im at 60.6% with 90.1% on part 1 so i stopped the torrent and played it to make sure. And its awesome, granted when i moved it (because it wanst complete) it turned into chipmunks reading it lol.

 Anywho if anyone knows of a E-Book to go along w/ this please post a link to a working one >< both of the ones ive downloaded were just posted by jerks w/ spoilers in them.

Also tyty for the great upload but plz dont go offline before people can seed it next time! TYTY again!"

,DragoonReborn,2009-11-30T00:13Z,"downloading at a whooping 1,5 mbs, atm! Hope this is the real deal!"
,DragoonReborn,2009-11-30T01:16Z,"Finished downloading with a nice dl speed. Thanks!

This is the real deal, and its read by Kramer and Reading, the same pair who read the rest. 
Sound quality is.. ok, not disturbing atleast. The book is divided into 4 mp3-parts, not by chapter."
,marcosmanmeat,2009-12-03T03:37Z,thanks mate will injoy listening to this :)
