That was my 9/12 traffic cam vid Glenn mentioned on the radio and showed later on TV. Since he linked to it, so it's been a major lib magnet... suits me fine! Easy hunting.

Let's save the horrible, dehumanizing soul-devouring attacks for Barry-and-friends, huh? ;)

Thanks again, m8"

I actually called in last thursday when he was asking for ""a way out without too much pain""

I have an idea but my cell phone lost reception and I was just like...screw it...my lack of an attention span just killed my motivation to call back 1000 times to get through...

That's awesome though that he showed it on TV too, I didn't get to watch it today, gotta look through the DVR...

I noticed that Netviper hasn't uploaded anything in a while. Is there anyone recording Beck's TV show? 

I would rather not have to set up my computer to capture all that...I have an awesome rig but moving it is something that is just a day's worth of work.

If I do end up capturing glenn's tv ill be sure to start upping that as well..."
,ZERO_BS,2009-10-28T04:43Z,"I have yet to call... the only radio show I've ever called was Coast to Coast with Art Bell when I was 16. He was talking about the Swissair Flight 111 wreckage which I happened to see being transported to the base I volunteered at. I was trying to point out a mistake a previous caller made, but couldn't get through. Lol, those were the days... back when there was room for entertainment. Now it's just a constant red-alert situation. It's insane! Batshit insane.

Yeah, it was pretty cool that Glenn showed it. Rush and Michelle Malkin had it on their sites, too. Nice to contribute something. It shut up CNN and MSNBC's fake crowd numbers, in any case.

Well, there are at least 2 users on Y0uTube I'm subscribed to (BuckFarack and therightscoop) that upload his shows in 5 parts reliably, every day. I'll PM them and ask if they'll upload them here. If not, I or anyone else here could always just DL and re-upload them as torrents... don't know why I didn't think of it before."
