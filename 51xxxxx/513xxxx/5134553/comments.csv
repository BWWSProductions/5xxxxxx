Keep up the good work, we all really appreciate it, and if you ever need anything do not hesitate to ask!"

,WWIII,2009-10-25T02:44Z,"your welcome, one question though.. do you capture the stream or do you have a hour by hour  download and merge them in something like super video converter? i actually was about to capture the stream and edit it and start to upload them, but then i saw you and Jerkstorex where uploading them here. so i didn't  think it was needed.."
