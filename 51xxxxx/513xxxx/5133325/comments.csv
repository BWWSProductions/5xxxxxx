[T],bi20,2009-10-25T02:37Z,done :)
,potah,2009-10-25T22:37Z,"I know this hasn´t been up for long, but there are a bunch of people stuck at 7,6% and i´m one of them. It would be nice to have some more seeders cause now i guess it´s only bi20 that is seeding."
[T],bi20,2009-10-26T02:44Z,"yes, it's only me. I don't know where you'll find more seeders. Be sure that I will seed until 100%. Right now it's 7,7% ;)

Please, don't complain about speed. I know it can be frustrating, but that's the situation and this torrent is huge. Thanks.

I am seeding starting with the first season, so you can start watching it ;)"
,ANGRY_KOREA_MAN,2009-10-27T19:45Z,"nice upload. it went really well for a while, at like 500kb-1mb/s but now nothing. was just wondering if you could start seeding again, would be great. thanks again."
[T],bi20,2009-10-27T22:45Z,"Oh, come on. I said no complains, please. I was seeding. I am seeding. I will be seeding."
,ANGRY_KOREA_MAN,2009-10-28T00:58Z,sorry :P
,ANGRY_KOREA_MAN,2009-11-07T17:52Z,you're not seeding at all anymore
[T],bi20,2009-11-08T00:06Z,yes I am mister smarty pants. :P
[T],bi20,2009-11-16T15:28Z,"right now it's 99,7% seeded, but I don't know what files is that 0.03% that is lacking. Could anybody tell me?"
,Rollep,2009-11-17T00:14Z,"Season 2 episode 2 to 11 is incomplete. Season 9 episode 8 & 9 is also incomplete. Hopefully you will be able to make everything complete.

Thanks, bi20, I am a big Seinfeld fan, up here in Europe I have not had the opportunity to watch the episodes in 720p, so your effort is much appreciated."
[T],bi20,2009-11-17T02:04Z,"Thanks. Are you sure all files from season 2 ep2 until 11 are not 100% seeded? that's strange...

btw, I am from Europe aswell :)"
,Rollep,2009-11-17T12:09Z,"Yes, I'm sure, just did a Re-check"
[T],bi20,2009-11-17T15:27Z,"ok, will seed those aswell."

but if everyone can keep seeding it would be amazing! i promise to seed"
,ANGRY_KOREA_MAN,2009-11-24T04:05Z,people! SEED! :(
,EKasica,2009-12-21T19:44Z,"Why is anyone bothering with this?

The tops and bottoms have been chopped off so the Yuppie dorks can have their 16:9; there is frame-dropping and other speed issues; and some eps are edited. Other than that. . .

And all for HD. LOL! This is a friggin' TV show (and one about as visually undistinguished as you can get), not Stanley Kubrick.

The original DVD releases are much better."
[T],bi20,2009-12-26T18:29Z,"this is what they have done:

""Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped out the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring previously cropped images on the sides, from the 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 frame"""
,J Dirty,2010-03-14T15:05Z,Anyone ever find the missing episodes with the same quality?  It's kind of gross when you get to the 175MB episodes.
,glabos,2010-05-22T23:58Z,"22/MAY/2010 Los Angeles

I just finished downloading this torrent. Overall it took 3 months and 9 days but it was worth it. It is much better quality and HD format than the DVD Rip that I downloaded last year.

Yes there are watermarks and TV popups but the quality overall is great and there are no commercials so shut up and watch it.

I substituted my DVD Rips for the missing seasons and episodes so at least I am now 80% HD. Since HD wasn't even in the picture when Seinfeld was filmed you can bitch much about the presentation. It is what it is and it is far better than the DVD rip.

It was worth the 3.25 Months of download time, so hang in there and let it complete. I seeded for the same amount of time and now I am done.

,ESSVirage,2010-06-25T23:56Z,"Hey fellows
Its very very slow ... i tried port forwarding, TCPoptimizer, everything, but it still SLOW !
Are you really going to seed this !!"
,libremaster,2010-06-29T15:05Z,Anyone know if there are good sync eng subs for this rip?? Tnks!
,shelborg,2010-09-12T08:38Z,amazing torrent. thanks. 
,frant1k,2010-11-28T10:01Z,"Thanks for this. Any word on if/when the missing episodes will be available in 720p?

Again, thanks for scrounging for this."
,baksug-i-dasseborg,2011-01-12T22:46Z,I know it is a big file but please seed. Cant wait to watch my favourite show in 720p.

,funky89,2011-03-04T01:01Z,"Didn't realize these were from TBS. That makes it kind of a deal breaker for me. I hate seeing overlays for Family Guy and House of Payne. I thought they might be from local affiliates. My local CBS station airs Seinfeld at midnight every weeknight, and there are no watermarks. It's like watching a DVD (not counting syndication cuts.)"
,Ropower,2011-03-21T16:43Z,"Well, was hoping it was a DVD source, but those stupid watermarks and advertisements are annoying. Took me months to get it, slow as hell download! Having to do it off peak as local internet service is so expensive. Seeing people in Europe downloading it at 2MB/s while I struggle along at 30KB/s is so sad. Some people getting 100% in 24 hours while I've been slugging away at it for soo long. Uploaded almost 3x as much as I've downloaded.

And I still have to get the last 30GB of episodes from elsewhere, at least its better than the crap 420p I previously had. Damn my country's internet sucks balls!"
,geenotreally,2011-06-14T09:37Z,"I was seeding the whole 95.46GB since Jan and BHAM, my Lacie NAS just lost it's XFS file system. Nothing wrong with the HDDs, but no data. Never buy Lacie products. They suck. Downloading it all over again. "
,dadeohdan,2011-07-07T21:40Z,Great job   The best i have seen...Thank you.
,detlort,2011-07-12T14:12Z,"Why even bother...?

Original frame has been cropped to create the 16:9 format. 
You get watermark and pop ups; ""Friends up next"".

Save yourself the time and space, and get the dvd-rip. Uncropped, no adds/watermarks.

,wtfjbl,2011-09-11T20:09Z,come on ppl. I'm seeding 4times my dl speed. Don't be so greedy gents.
,Scrag85,2011-09-26T13:02Z,"but this isn't cropped, i compared it to my dvds and you see more on the sides in the 720p rips..."
