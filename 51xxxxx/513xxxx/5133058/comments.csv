,goofy113,2009-10-24T01:41Z,"when we said bilderberg group existed
20 years ago you called us crazy.

we told you bush would destroy the constitution
we told you obama would be ten times worse!
all his promises of change went were???

more troops in irac
more troops in afganistan
reaffirmed the patriot act.
more laws that detroys the constitution.

now we are warning you of the H1NI vaccination
with mercury ect: will you listen or let time show you we are right yet again?

if we are allways right in what we stat as fact
and you allways deny it even though it is true
and just call us tinfoild hat wearing crazy people

,zato1,2009-10-24T02:22Z,This is how Alex Jones makes a living. 
,fish_fingers,2009-10-24T03:41Z,"Boy, this thing is everywhere."
,sandshreder,2009-10-24T18:00Z,"@zato1 ""this is how alex jones makes a living"" = True, does that make him wrong?  watch before you just criticize.  its right therre on the video... the lies coming right out of the politicians mouths. they are not just telling you what the quotes are they are presenting the actual footage of the events, the interviews, the congressional hearings... there are plent of stupid Americans already, dont add to the growing list!"
,fish_fingers,2009-10-24T22:34Z,"I agree that the politicians are full of sh*t, and there's plenty of facts that are frightening here, but some of the conclusions are a bit out there."
,lsnicket,2009-10-25T02:47Z,"Alex Jones doesn't make evil money like Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck.  Its honestly earned.  Also you don't get rich off of movies that you have people give away.. The cover of the DVD says TO MAKE COPIES!  He has a release that says you can copy all of his stuff..

This is his best film better.   He got real experts this time.  This is what is going on right now!

If we don't take action we are all going to be living in FEMA camps or buried in some mass FEMA grave site!

great upload! Keep spreading the truth, these people who commented on this torrent abotu Republicans are fools. They still believe the Republicans are worse than Democrats or visa-versa, anyone who has half a brain knows they are both evil. These commenters I believe are sooooo stupid they think its about Republicans because the title says ""Republic"" not realizing that the United States is a Republic and i has nothing to do with Left and Right. They also probably think being Democrat means the same as Democracy..."
,Panjazz2000,2009-10-27T13:58Z,People actually watch this bullshit?
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-11-04T04:32Z,"Alex is right about the H1N1 being toxic but I wonder...why does Alex Jones' father, a dentist, use mercury in his dental fillings? A little hypocritical, no?"
,Murphy416,2010-03-07T17:21Z,"Yeah but it's mostly watched by intelligent people who see through facade of the world we are shown on tv. If you can just shrug off everything we're seeing in the world today, and act like nothing's going on, you really have to be pretty close to brain dead. Go back to watching your Looney Toon, or Westlemania downloads and quit being a troll. Also, remember that just because you can't grasp something--and I'm sure the list of things you can't grasp is extensive-- it doesn't make it bullshit."
,Nilbop,2010-04-23T15:57Z,"Observe as Murphy416 insults someone who doesn't share his world-view only to come across as another bitter neocon.

This man is the best president your country had option to, and he's doing a lot of great works.

But if that's not to your liking you can always move."
,dg39,2010-05-23T14:35Z,ur an idiot if u voted obama. look what's happening now. bush was'nt perfect but he was a president unlike the clown in office. by the way if u voted for obama u are nothin but lazy motherfuckers who rather sit on your asses and live off the tax payers than work and for u guys can all hang as far as i care. fUCK OBAMA!!!!!!!!!!! and dems!!!!!!!!!
