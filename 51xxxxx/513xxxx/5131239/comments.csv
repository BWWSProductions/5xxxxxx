,Sumsonfire,2009-10-24T08:09Z,"hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference as it took me 5 or six days to download a single season 
thank you for all your work"
[V],McTav,2009-10-24T08:53Z,"@Sumsonfire

chances of that are slim to none, and no matter how a torrent is packed download speeds always rely on people seeding and your connection with them.

and to be fair its not like I have a kickass connection either. If i didnt have limitations myself I would be releasing stuff everyday. Just be happy you dont have to pay for it and move along ;P"
,goshjosh5,2009-11-14T02:42Z,"McTav, got most of your Office torrents-huge fan, can't thank you enough. perfect quality. quick question, if possible: how do you rip dvd's to avi? I'm trying to do the same you've done with The Office with things like Friends and stuff-I have access to the DVDs-I just can't find a suitable solution with good quality-I don't care about hard drive space-just quality and yours are perfect. what's the secret? thanks for any info you can share."
,semicbland,2009-11-19T13:22Z,damn good have been looking for this :)
,zdude123,2009-11-20T08:15Z,"McTav is THE Boss!
McTav is THE BOss!!
McTav is THE BOSS!!!

Phew...thank you :-)"
,zdude123,2009-11-20T08:40Z,"McTav, will you please consider releasing the Blooper reel for all the seasons of The Office. That would make an awesome addition to your releases.
Pretty please :-)"
[V],McTav,2009-11-21T23:06Z,"@goshjosh5

although I myself have the whole friends series ripped I dont think I will up it any time soon if at all.

although what I do is no secret and I once like you was stressed not being able to find the best solution, so here is what I do, its very simple.

download
Magic dvdripper - http://www.magicdvdripper.com/
well worth what ever I paid for it. or if you are cheap you know how to get it.

Is is the best ripper ive ever used, rip with the setting of original MPEG2. that will give you a video file of the original video on the dvd. then I compress that to give the best quality.

then download autogk - http://www.autogk.me.uk/

its freeware so no need to look for anything else. Import the original mpeg2 you ripped and compress, this is the best xvid compressor ive used and pretty sure what 99% of the videos you download are from.

and that's basically it. Enjoy backing up your dvds its nice :P"
,goshjosh5,2009-12-06T07:59Z,"Wow, jackpot. Backed up a number of DVDs using your method and I can't thank you enough, McTav. You're my new hero. Haha. Out of curiosity, is there a set level of compression you use with AutoGK? I've been experimenting and I'm sure I'll find my own preference but I'm just curious what your rips are."
,Uberlegen0403,2009-12-17T04:42Z,"Thanks man, this is great stuff."
,DoubleUKG,2010-01-27T10:45Z,thanks dude! u are a bloody champ! i will seed for 1 month after finish downloading :)
,tytytucke,2010-02-14T23:06Z,Thanks for every season so far
,PerNot,2010-02-18T20:25Z,"stuck at 95.4 % for several days! Please, someone for gods sake, SEED!"
,rjohnson1990,2010-02-20T18:34Z,Thanks for all of the seasons of The Office. The show is awesome and your torrents are the best I've found. I know this sounds like a lame question but I have searched online for a while now and I was wondering what you use to rip DVDs and make them AVI files? I have a couple here I'm borrowing and I'd like to rip them to my computer and possibly upload them. Thanks again.

,ay2459,2011-01-03T16:02Z,"Be careful, this one is being tracked. I got an email from my school specifically naming this torrent."
,gadsman1,2011-01-07T20:25Z,that doesnt mean its being tracked.. it means your pc was caught trafficking huge bandwidth..
,S!R3,2011-04-06T11:12Z,"These rips are great, will keep seeding for a while!"
