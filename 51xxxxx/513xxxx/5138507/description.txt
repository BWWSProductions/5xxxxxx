Wake Up Randi Rhodes - lay off the sauce lady

Alex continues his discussion with Lindsey Williams, the ordained Baptist minister for 28 years who went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary. Williams, citing inside sources, predicted the recent fall in oil prices. He has warned about the coming of hyperinflation and the engineered destruction of the economy. Last week on the Alex Jones Show, Mr. Williams said there will be an economic collapse within two years, according to his inside sources. Alex also talks with Timothy Baldwin, the son of former presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin. Baldwin is a former prosecutor for the Florida State Attorneyâ€™s Office who now owns his own private law practice. He is the author of Freedom For A Change.
