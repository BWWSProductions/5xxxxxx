Set in the 16th century, El Greco's search for freedom and love ranges from the courts of Crete and Venice to Toledo in Spain. Here he is confronted by his greatest adversary: the Holy Inquisition. Never backing down in his against with the establishment of his day, El Greco's story is one of unusual heroism, betrayal, love, and the power of one man and his creative consciousness to stand up and overcome barbarity and ignorance.
