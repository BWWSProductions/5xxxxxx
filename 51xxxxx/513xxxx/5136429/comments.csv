,Aliensponged,2009-10-26T18:18Z,Could you get Sweeny Todd with Johnny Depp?

I know you have already posted lord of the rings extended and i appreciate it, but the version you posted is in two parts and has a long 18 min credits at he end of every movie which is kind of stupid. there are a lot of bluray versions that do not have this problem and come in one part per  movie. If you could get around to doing this sometime that would be great. It is not a priority.

Thanks "
