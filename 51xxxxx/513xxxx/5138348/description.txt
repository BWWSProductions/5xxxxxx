NEW YORK (AP) - Students are using a new ring tone to receive messages in class â€” and many teachers canâ€™t even hear the ring.
Some students are downloading a ring tone off the Internet that is too high-pitched to be heard by most adults. With it, high schoolers can receive text message alerts on their cell phones without the teacher knowing.
As people age, many develop whatâ€™s known as aging ear â€” a loss of the ability to hear higher-frequency sounds.
The ring tone is a spin-off of technology that was originally meant to repel teenagers â€” not help them. A Welsh security company developed the tone to help shopkeepers disperse young people loitering in front of their stores while leaving adults unaffected. The company called their product the â€œMosquito.â€
Donna Lewis, a teacher in Manhattan, says her colleague played the ring for a classroom of first-graders â€” and all of them could hear it, while the adults couldnâ€™t hear anything.

Choose the folder on your PC that contains the files you want to move, select the files (or folders) and transfer them over to your cell phone. You can also use these software to transfer photos or ringtones from your cell phone to your computer. Consult your user's manual for additional instructions specific to your brand and model.
