,lapis2,2009-10-24T23:02Z,what a load of shit lol
,brainphreak,2009-10-24T23:11Z,"Thanks for clarifying, I had always wondered what the defintion of ""lapis2"" was.

lapsi2 = ""what a load of shit""

interesting fact :)

Thanks, and enjoy the movie!"
,encore8800,2009-10-24T23:48Z,"Screw you brainfreak and crawl back into that degenerated rightwing cespool you crawled out of! Lapis2 is right - What kind of whining Republican dribble are you trying to peddle here? 

Scientific dictatorship?? high-tech tyranny???
neo-feudal slavery???? Sounds awfully alot like the agenda of your old boy Cheney and his little born-again-christian-ex-drunk sockpuppet bushyboy.

Face it, you GOP morons your reign of uselessness is OVER! The PEOPLE of AMERICA kicked your lying, twofaced corrupt asses out of the White House! And this vicious spew pulled out of Rush Limbaugh's butthole is the best you can come up with?? Come again you little girlies!"
,brainphreak,2009-10-25T01:00Z,"HAHAH encore8800... not sure if you are truly as ignorant and uneducated as you sound, but Im guessing your just talking shit about a movie you never watched, and were too stupid to read the description... 


Ill take you on one stupid comment at a time....


RE: ""Screw you brainfreak and crawl back into that degenerated rightwing cespool you crawled out of!""

HAHAH Nice, so you are one of those ""left and right"" idiots who think that there is a left and right and they have two separate agendas, when in fact as always, both left and right both have the same agenda, to support corporate greed and screw the hard working citizens.


RE: ""Lapis2 is right - What kind of whining Republican dribble are you trying to peddle here?""

Exactly, you dont even know what this is about? the entire movie explains how the left and right are greed.. and Republicans are as bad as democrats, as well as all my other uploads...  Republican dribble? I can only assume you think this is Republican because of the word ""republic"" in the title... just shows how ignorant and pathetic you are... America is a REPUBLIC, it has nothing to do with being REPUBLICAN! Just like a Democracy, has nothing to do with being a DEMOCRAT... A Democracy and Republic are forms of government and voting, a Republican and a Democrat, are illusions of choice that give you the same options presented in different gift wrap... simple as that, you are very stupid to think its ""democrats"" or ""republicans"" at fault of ANYTHING... 


RE: ""Scientific dictatorship?? high-tech tyranny???
neo-feudal slavery???? Sounds awfully alot like the agenda of your old boy Cheney and his little born-again-christian-ex-drunk sockpuppet bushyboy.""

Exactly, that's why you should watch the movie, and see that this is the current agenda of Obama and his administration as well. Your idea that Cheney and Bush are the big bad men, and now everything is ok because a Democrat or Liberal or whatever you want to call the current dictator is in power... Sad, simple minded way at looking at life. Go root for the home team, is it Democrat or Republican? haha, either way you are just a spectator and listening to dictators sell you fear. Go kiss Obama's ass if you think it was only Bush and Cheney who are evil. You have some growing up to do. 

RE: ""Face it, you GOP morons your reign of uselessness is OVER! The PEOPLE of AMERICA kicked your lying, twofaced corrupt asses out of the White House! And this vicious spew pulled out of Rush Limbaugh's butthole is the best you can come up with?? Come again you little girlies!""


HAAHH yep, this comment seals the deal. You are truly a brainwashed idiot who thinks that just as soon as Bush and Cheney left the white house, you suddenly have a saint running things. Obama is the master and chief and makes all the decisions in America, he is honest and true and will bring you to salvation! right? hahahahahah!! 

You kicked the Republicans out, so now you can rest easy...


oh wait... the patriot act still exists...
oh wait... the military commissions act still exists..
oh wait... the troops were doubled in Afghanistan by Obomba...
oh wait... Now they are working to make mandatory vaccines..
oh wait... Now he gives bailouts to the wealthy CEO's and forces pay cuts to the companies underpaid stafff
oh wait... he gives BILLIONS of our and our childrens tax money so that companies can close up shop in the US and open up facilities in foreign land
oh wait... he has been repeatedly caught in direct lies on stage, great speaker, great liar. 
oh wait... there is still torture going on, and his only goal is to close a single facility, and that isnt even done...
oh wait... he wants to force every single person into a health care system they may or may not agree with, yet more government, yet more failed government programs.. are any successful to date?


So yeah. Go back and watch Jon Stewart for your news, and beleive that Obama will lead you to salvation as he is the hero... Thats what the media likes you to believe. Meanwhile all the same exact things occur tha"
,brainphreak,2009-10-25T01:03Z,"also its brainphreak not brainfreak, but I dont expect you to pay attention to detail when you are stupid enough to think that a Republic has ANYTHING to do with being republican... Really, you looked at the title and thought it was about Republicans? mwahahah

if you are over 14 years of age, you should really think about taking some classes so your IQ is no longer lower than your age. The only thing you accomplish with your misinformed posts is making yourself look like a bratty child who failed social studies."

WTH is the matter with you people? You are pro NWO? you don't agree with this film, but you want to download it? Strange society we live in...  WAKE THE FUCK UP, there is mass corruption in the white house and you are foolish if you think Obama or any president will save you. "
,encore8800,2009-10-25T02:45Z,"Oh fuck this troll. obviously he's just lurking around here to see if somebody want's to bite on his crap. Brainfart, you are a loosing cunt and so are all the fucking republicans. You and your ilk should be hurled against the sun without a lunchbox!

Over and out"
,brainphreak,2009-10-25T02:00Z,"Dude ""encore8800"", learn to read. I am the uploader. This movie is not a Republican movie. Simple as that. How can I troll my own upload? you people are seriously retarded here... "
,lsnicket,2009-10-25T02:33Z,"We are basically having Bush's third term with Barrack Obama.  

This isn't Republican propaganda this is what is really going on.  

IT IS REALLY URGENT PEOPLE WATCH THIS RIGHT NOW!  WE ARE ONLY A FEW EVENTS AWAY FROM LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY!

Also not covered in the movie but super important. . Research the COPENHAGEN CLIMATE TREATY.. In December, if OBAMA signs it we lose everything!

Thanks brainphreak.  I've been seeding the PrisonPlanet.tv version since it came out.  Now I can burn the full version and hand them out!"

,brainphreak,2009-10-25T03:40Z,"RE: powerman5000ca

Your right, I was just super shocked at the comments. I believe they are truly just idiots who were confused thinking this is Republican stuff. Your right though, Ill ignore those morons now they are worse than TV when it comes to killing brain cells :o)"

,bobtheman,2009-10-25T13:13Z,brainphreak: you've got my wote!
,666Loke,2009-10-25T15:59Z,"Well, it was interesting. I downloaded it because I was bored and expected some Bush fans.

But it was about the Illuminati instead. Some of it was utter crap but not everything, it is worrying that corporations are getting more and more political influence over the world as time goes by, and that goverments all over the world spend more and more money to spy on their citizens.

I wouldn't say that Obama is like Bush but I am not impressed of what he did so far. The fact is that the US foreign debts are totaly out of hand now.

When I am low on cash I lower my spendings, I don't go out and borrow a lot of money. That only worked in the 30s and that worked because of the war. Giving away money to corporations that goes badly is counter productive in the long run.

Still, I rather vote for Penn Gillette than any of these guys."
,soulfried,2009-10-26T02:51Z,"Good upload. Also, ignore those trying to get a rise. If people are to blind to accept the reality that our government is neither republican or democratic but a mess to confuse the public then let them die off in their dream world.  As for those of us with some balls who will stand for our rights, spreading the word is most appreciated."
,sothcott,2009-10-26T14:56Z,"Politics, Left, Right, Left, Right, LEFT!
Sounds like the marching of the Police State to me.

Alex Jones is not saying that the solution to the mistakes of the Right is to vote for the Left any more than he is saying the solution to the mistakes of the the Left is to vote for the Right."

I liked you long reply. Maybe more zombies will understand now.

Most trolls only post their comments in a way to discourage zombies from daring to take a chance at grasping the REALITIES we need to deal with."
,botanybay1,2009-10-28T04:38Z,Wait until the legislation passes to shut the internet down whenever they feel like it like they do in China. Then all the naysayers will be scratching their moronic heads. Blow up the federal reserve now!

,maksimsi,2009-12-01T12:40Z,"1. In my opinion earth is overpopulated. But it shouldn't be reduce in the way they plan to.

2. Monetary economic system should be thrown away becasue it is bad for most people anyway.
Competition is not good because natural resources are wasted every day because of cheap stuff we buy every day and throw away in a week like various ""Mister Tool"" equipement...Made in China things etc.
I think VenusProject is better future fo mankind.

3. Very good documentary. Hope it will make a lot of people to start thinking."
,brainphreak,2009-12-08T07:08Z,"Thanks for the comments! I think the idea that Earth is overpopulated is completely fiction. The problem is the waste of resources on each individual which amounts to a HUGE number. If you look at most overcrowded areas, there is an area with almost no population nearby. Nature has a HUGE amount of resources, and the problem of overcrowding is mostly caused by the abuse of those resources, not the amount of people. Even if the population was reduced, the waste will just grow as it does now until the earth supports less and less people. 

this of course is just my opinion, I just feel its overplayed like global warming. The earth will be completely polluted and poisoned to the point that we all die, probably long before the temperature kills us due to mans effect. The suns effect on the Earth is so great that our effect on global temperature is basically non existent. Yet we are having trouble breathing and there is an island of garbage in the sea... so why must we prove global warming in order to start cleaning up? we dont have to... we shouldnt focus on it... but high places, the powers that be, big corporations etc. and those who are in charge, they will pay big money to fly someone like gore around, and be sure his movie gets great ratings in order to push a global tax... and people will believe that we dont have enough resources to go around so that they can push the population control agenda. In reality this is a very small factor, and while it DOES have some effect on resources due to number of people, and the global temp CAN be effected by humans and their waste.. this is by no means the source and merely a symptom of the real problem.. The problem being that there is waste, and corporations in control. There is politicians out to push the ""green"" agenda now, only to make more money and rob you through ""pollution"" or ""green"" taxes.

OK end rant. :) Thanks again for the comments, and glad you enjoyed it, I will soon upload many more great dvd's on the topics!"

In Canada that is: Liberal, Progressive Conservative, New Democratic Party .... etc. They are ALL the SAME; merely different aspects or PRESENTATIONS of the same element. Did any of US (You and Me) come up with these moronic classifications or definitions? 

Who put these definitions (limit-setting positionalities) in place? Think about it. It is the wish (and in-place programs) of the ""controlling elite"" ""agenda setters"" that 
You classify/categorize Yourself according to the [thought]-limiting definitions/categories that You had no hand in creating. You LEARNED all that bullshit in ""school""... and ""school"" is still (contantly) in session. Well that's my extemporanteous blast. I had to let that out.

Regardless, most of the issues he talks about are more important at the moment anyway, vote Ron Paul 2012 if hes able to run."
