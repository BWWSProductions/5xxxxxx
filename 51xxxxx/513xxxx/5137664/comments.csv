After the install the ""Razor"" advertisement plays, then I hit finish on the installation. I click on the shortcut thinking it'll work, but my computer just thinks (hourglass) then nothing happens. I check my task manager it says Borderlands is running. Still nothing though lol.

,Harrewho,2009-11-23T01:12Z,"How to install this properly (atleast how I did it)

1.   Mount the ISO file
2.   Proceed until the installation starts installing
3.   WATCH THE TEXT THAT SAYS WHAT'S CURRENTLY INSTALLING
4.   WHEN YOU SEE ""Microsoft DirectX"" INSTALLING GET READY TO COPY THE ""Borderlands.exe"" FROM YOUR ISO (...\Razor1911\Install) TO THE BINARIES DIRECTORY (...\Borderlands\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries) WHERE YOU'RE INSTALLING THE GAME    *************you have to do this WHILE installing and after the DirectX is installed in the beginning of the installation************
5.   After you've put that Borderlands.exe file in the right place you have to go to your ISO file again and go to ...\Razor1911\Crack  There you should copy this borderlands.exe too. It is VERY VERY VERY important that you do this right. Then put it in ...\Borderlands\Gearbox Software\Borderlands**         ***********NOT IN THE BINARIES DIRECTORY AS YOU DID WITH THE LAST EXE**************
6.   You can now let the installation finish. There will be a Razor 1911 logo popping up in the end of the installation, but don't worry about that.
7.   Now uninstall the game and then redo all of these steps untill you DIE >:D (no just joking, THE GAME has been installed so u can now play it ^^)"
,RedKing13_ca,2009-11-23T10:33Z,"none of these work online anymore because when you go to online it wants you to download a patch...

Install this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5137664/Borderlands_Proper-Razor1911%28No_Rars%29 At the end of the install, when it says ""Please use original disc"" hit 'cancel' and finish as normal.  
When it finishes, COPY borderlands.exe from the crack folder into the C:\Program Files\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries folder.

Then, download this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5167164/Borderlands.Patch.1.01-RELOADED and extract ONE of the 14-or-so kilobyte folders somewhere you can find it. Copy all the files you extract into the  C:\Program Files\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands folder.

THEN, you're going to need to again COPY the borderlands.exe from the crack folder into the C:\Program Files\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries folder. Then you're ready to play."

,spitfirex81,2009-12-13T01:00Z,ok so i did everything that the instructions said. replaced the borderlands exe in binaries with the one in the install folder after dx installed and overwrote the it. then i placed the exe file from the crack folder in the borderlands folder. it installed. i got the razor 1911 splash thing with the music. it dissapears and then i get 1722 error. what is going on? i tried to install from a mount and from extracted iso files and same thing. tried instlling as admin too and same thing. one thing im curious about is that when you extract the iso there is one setup.exe that says application and one setup that says its a windows installer package. then there are 4 other setups that are other languages. does it matter which setup i use the application one or the windows installer package one? has anyone figured out how to fix the 1722 error? please help ive been trying everything for 2 days now. im on windows 7 ultimate if you need to know.
,spitfirex81,2009-12-13T03:07Z,"ok while im waiting for a response for my first post i tried installing on winxp pro and no 1722 error. thought everything was ganna work. clicked on the exe and waited a bit and then i got ""general protection fault"" what the hell is this? does anyone have a fix for this? i cant find answers anywhere."

,jbrad2,2009-12-17T18:44Z,"I did exactly what I was supposed to do and ran into a few problems before I got it right. The 1722 error was because I let the program decide where to put the game but it did not make the Directory. So, I told it to put it in the Program Files Directory and it worked fine. Then I made sure to put the Borderlands.exe from the install folder into the Binaries folder after the DirectX installed and waited until it copied over the original. make sure you see that size of the file change from 49,xxxk to something like 256k. then put the Borderlands.exe from the crack folder into the Borderlands folder. then when the game finishes installing you will see that the borderlands.exe in the Borderlands folder disappeared and the borderlands.exe in the Binaries changed size from like 256k to 28,xxxk. if it says 256k or 49,xxxk you did something wrong. after that you will be fine. Now, I did do this on an XP 32bit machine so I don't know if it works on a Windows 7 machine, which I believe is a 64bit ops system. "

,blackembrace,2009-12-17T22:20Z,"**For anyone having problems with the 1722 error on windows 7** 

Ignore the install notes supplied and follow this guide.

1. Mount the iso and extract the crack folder.

2. Start the install, and let it run through without placeing cracks

3. When the 1722 error pops up, leave the error up and go into your ""Program Files"" folder (or where you installed) and rename the ""2K Games"" folder to ""_2K Games"".

4. Click OK on the 1722 error. When it finishes rolling back the installation, click OK on the final installer message. Now you can rename the folder back to ""2K Games"".

5. Now place both the cracks in correct places

6. Locate the Borderlands.exe file (which you just placed in the binary folder) Right-click and create a shortcut (you may need to create this shortcut on the Desktop.)

7. Now right-click on the shortcut and select properties. Add a space to the end of the text in the ""Target"" box and after the space, add: -installge
It should look something like this:
""C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries\Borderlands.exe"" -installge

8. Then select the ""Advanced"" tab in the ""Properties"" dialog and enable ""Run as Administrator"" and click ""OK"". Click ""OK"" one more time to close the properties dialog.

9.  Finally, run the shortcut. You should see a dialog that says the game was installed into ""Games Explorer"" successfully.

10. Delete the shortcut you have just used, and run the game from the ""games"" folder or create another shortcut to borderlands.exe

Hope this helps!!"

,MessiahDJ,2009-12-21T14:45Z,"This worked perfectly for me.
I had a hard time getting it to work, i had to install/reinstall this about 5 times.
But it's just about timing.
I'll tell you how i've done it.

1) You download this torrent

2) You mount the file with some program ( I did it with Daemon tools )

3) The menu will open up, and you click on INSTALL or whatever.

4) Make sure u got the razor folder of off the disc and copied it to your desktop or something, somewhere where you can reach it fast.

5) When it's starting to install, you'll first install some other things, that's when you go to the folder you've just copied to the desktop. And go to the INSTALL folder. You copy the .exe in there.

6) When it's installing, after directx, you wait a while. Untill you've got like something that looks like 15% of the total or something. Just make sure, it installed the original .exe that the installer made. So when you paste the .exe from Razor, you actually overwrite the one from the installer. Otherwise, razor's .exe will get overwritten by the installer one. You paste this .exe van from Razor in the c:/programfiles/2kgames/ blablabla BINARIES folder.

7) When that's done; you wait untill like 50% of the install is done, don't really bother that much. And then you copy the .exe from the CRACK folder from razor, into the borderlands folder, the main folder, not the binaries one.

8) when the install is done, you will get a cheesy Razor song, that looked like pacman, and you will be able to play Borderlands.

BUT

I've got it to work, i've played single player, and when i wanted to play multiplayer, it wanted me to install the patch , i did that. And it screwed up the whole game, i could'nt get nothing to work anymore.
So i'm going to need to get some clearance upon patching borderlands for multiplayer.

Anyhoo. Hopefully i've cleared up some shit for people who could'nt get it to work.

I had the same issue on 64-Bit Windows 7. Here's how I fixed it:

1.) Downloaded DirectX updater from Microsoft. 
2.) Ran DirectX installer as Administrator with my antivirus (Panda Cloud) turned OFF. Install failed first try, disabled AV and it worked.
3.) Installed the game from the launcher and, lo and behold, I got past the DirectX installation.
4.) Followed the supplied directions from that point on.
-Good luck-

What you do is to copy all files that are already installed to a memory stick or another folder. Then you can let Securecom uninstall. After that you take your copied files to the correct folder (or maybe another folder) And it works! :-)"

magic disc its free

http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm
Download and install.

 After thats done you need to right click on the new icon in the right hand corner there is an option to mount from there you will point it to the iso file on the portable hardrive after it is mounted explore the disc in it there will be a folder called razor19 something copy this folder and paste it to the desktop we will need the files in this folder while installing. now heres the important parts.......

Now during this time a splash screen for the game will have popped up. go ahead and install it will start its thing.
go into the folder you copied to the desktop inside you will see two other folders one named install and one crack ,copy the file in the install first

Wait for it to install direct x and while its doing this open up the program folder where your installing to and leave it open and wait for the 2K studios folder to appear once this happens wait a few seconds and then copy the install file from the desktop to the binaries folder .

it will ask you for permission just say yes and replace. Now it will continue doing its thing when it gets to the point where it says there are 2 minutes remaining you must copy the other file from the crack folder on the desktop to the main folder directory of borderlands NOT the binaries folder but the area where the binaries folder is located. once its done a techno arcade song should play just let it set a few then it will say finished and give you the option to finish.

where you put the install folder
copy the Borderlands file inside there...

2. go up one level back to the Binaries folder...

,CC_CC,2010-03-19T19:26Z,"Works on Win 7, 64 bits - no viruses according to NOD32. Crack while installing!"
,TheMooGod,2010-03-20T01:05Z,"I can't seem to get this to work. I've done as several people here have said to do - although, it contradicts the original instructions? -

I extracted the game via MagicISO, go through the beginning setup with no problem. I wait until it's done installing Direct X, and starts to install the actual directories. 

This is where I get confused:

The instructions say to copy the crack to the (dir)/2k games / gearbox software / boarderlands directory, yet there is no boarderlands.exe for me to be replacing.

The people here say to replace the exe in the binaries directory, which I do, but that doesn't help.

Replacing the exe in the binaries directory avoids the securom check error, but then boarderlands simply wants to start itself, and once it starts, I get a black screen - the game loading - then I am told that the installer did not install correctly, blah, blah, blah, it crashes, and does a roll back.

What am I doing incorrectly?"
,D4lan,2010-03-20T23:48Z,"@ themoogod

what I did was once I got the installer didn't load correctly error I just hard reset the computer. all of the files were still there and I was able to play the game. I don't know how bad it is to do that for the computer or the program, but it worked for me."
,TheMooGod,2010-03-21T01:07Z,"@D4lan:
I will try that, thank you.

It's not particularly good for your computer, but once in a blue moon shouldn't kill it. :)"
,therealmasterpirate,2010-03-21T02:38Z,@TheMooGod did you mount the iso? you install from that. follow the included instructions although i think there is no rar and you should mount the iso. extracting a game disc and installing from folder usually causes installation problems
,TheMooGod,2010-03-21T08:21Z,"@therealmasterpirate

No, I did not mount the ISO. I extracted it via MagicISO and ran setup from there. I could attempt a mounting, but I highly doubt that it would have any real effect.

@D4lan

I tried the forced shutdown. Unfortunately, Windows 7, combined with my fabulous laptop, don't allow for an INSTANT forced shutdown. I still have to go through what is basically a ARE YOU SURE, DURRR? kind of thing before it will actually do it. I don't believe that there a true forced shutdown; I even checked for the little hole to stick a paperclip in.

It didn't work; I tried it two times, and both times, the installation reverted itself.

I will try to mount the image rather than installing from the extracted, and post my results."
,TheMooGod,2010-03-21T09:16Z,"I'm afraid that mounting the image produces no results. Thank you for your help, though."
,TheMooGod,2010-03-21T09:23Z,"Sorry for posting so much. :o

I'm trying another thing, which may help those who have the same problem as myself. I'm waiting for the error at the end of the installation, which rolls back the saved progress -

Once it shows up, I'm simply copying the files to another area - in my case, this is a portable HD - to see if that works. I will post results."
,TheMooGod,2010-03-21T09:29Z,"I am very proud to say that my method, as described above, worked. The game launched, and so far, I am not experiencing any problems.

Screw you, Installer!! :)

When you've done that go to your mounted iso again into the razor1911/crack folder and put the exe in that folder into your borderlands folder, where the binaries folder is, but not in the binaries folder.
let the installer finish, it should come up with the razor symbol and song thing at the end of the install, after it does this, if you have placed the files in the correct places, it should say successfully installed and there will be a finish button at the bottom. click finish then put the exe that was in the borderlands folder outside the binaries folder into the binaries folder. if all goes well, you should be able to play the game just fine."

1) Install with the Autorun

2) DO NOT copy the install crack while installing just leave the installation goes

3) once install has finished and you will get an error: ""No correct CD"" or something like that

4) In the windows, click on ""Start Analysis"", in the next prompt windows click yes.

5) And it will give you another ERROR don't shut the error window down! 

6) Pres ctrl + alt + delete at the same time.

7) Start the Task manager ---> click on Processes. 

8) Click on Image Name a tab right under the processes tab (this will make it easier to find what you are searching for)

9) Now scroll down until you find Broderlans.exe *32 or something like that

10) Click the ""End Process"" button in the lower right corner. 

11) And copy the crack to the install directory.

12) Stay up the whole night playing the game!

downloaded the 1.31 UPDATE for the game (about 195 MB). Installed it straight over Razor's 1911 installation. Success.

,DaN00berz,2010-11-22T12:07Z,"hey dude, so did you try moving the folder back* to the default location (originally) C:\Program Files\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands

I think so*, so try moving it back and then run the uninstall thing and see if it works.

And if the error message is this: ""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log for more detail.""
then here's what you should do: update using this 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86)'
here http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/1/1/1116b75a-9ec3-481a-a3c8-1777b5381140/vcredist_x86.exe
Did you? You have to also install the directX as well, by installing from the borderlands disc image, it's provided in it (and if the error message you got says a dll file's missing then this is at highest chance the cause..)
Check your video card and see if it's up to date.. (less chance that this is the cause than another 2)
PS: I got these when dloading the repack vsion of BLand, now i want the complete disc with autorun.exe in it it's cool lol.

Yeah, so that's all and good luck. And if the error message was another, tell us pls we might be able to help :)

All the best, mate!!"

I get error 1335.  The cabinet file 'Setup5.cab' required for this installation is corrupt and cannot be used.  This could indicate a network error, an error reading from the CD-ROM, or a problem with this package.  Ignoring it gives me Internal Error 2350."

,DaN00berz,2010-12-12T16:49Z,"@Ayotte, I'm sorry to hear that.. :( but try adding the same torrent again, and choose the location where you downloaded this once.. let it check the checksums (or hashes or whatever you call it) then look carefully as it scans past.. 0.04%, 0.12%, 0.23% etc.. and throughout the whole process before reaching 100%, look carefully whether it has any red gaps in between the progress bar.. If yes, then this means your files are downloaded with a bit of errors by other peers/seeds. If that's the case, just let it finish the download, won't take long. And I can tell this is the highest chance that this is the main cause when others get it working perfectly but you get the error coming from CAB files during installation. Good luck and that's all I can help with cab errors.. :)

The important factor is NOT to move the crack shit in while installing. After getting the error a few times, I decided to let it do a ""legal"" install and after that move the cracks in.

After the install it will tell about online check. Don't click anything yet! Now let it be and go move the cracks in where you're supposed to. Once you've done that, I'm pretty sure I hit Retry and it passed the check. Now I had the game installed successfully, got it running.

,thepro12345,2011-03-17T07:34Z,"Okay, so before you people run your mouth and say this is a shitty crack and it doesn't work, maybe you should actually do a little reading about how to properly install it. Just because it has like 1 more thing you have to copy doesn't mean its bad. 

1. Mount Iso to a dvd drive with Daemon tools or w.e you use.
2. Start the install
3. Right click the iso and open its contents.
4. Go into the Razor file and copy the thing in the INSTALL folder.
5. Go to your program files and find 2kgames, then paste the thing from the install folder inside the binaries folder.

Works for me (Windows 7 -32bits/64bits) 
Tested on: 26-10-210 and 8-4-2011


1) Install with the Autorun

2) DO NOT copy the install crack while installing just leave the installation goes

3) once install has finished and you will get an error: ""No correct CD"" or something like that

4) In the windows, click on ""Start Analysis"", in the next prompt windows click yes.

5) And it will give you another ERROR don't shut the error window down! 

6) Pres ctrl + alt + delete at the same time.

7) Start the Task manager ---> click on Processes. 

8) Click on Image Name a tab right under the processes tab (this will make it easier to find what you are searching for)

9) Now scroll down until you find Broderlans.exe *32 or something like that

10) Click the ""End Process"" button in the lower right corner. 

11) And then http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5938770/Borderlands_Patch_1.4.1-RELOADED

if some dll missing try google.i have physxcudart_20.dll missing than put into binnary folder......n have fun....

12) Stay up the whole night playing the game!

,thenemeses,2011-04-24T23:24Z,"After four hours, I haven't made it work. 

I copy the Razor install file to the binaries folder just after directX installs, and the full program starts installing. During installation, I copy the crack file to the borderlands folder. Easy enough.

When the install is essentially complete, a securom window comes up and wants to check the installation via the internet. If I'm not connected to the internet, the check can't run, and if the check doesn't complete (or is interrupted or forcibly closed in any way), the installation rolls back. If I AM connected to the internet, the check is successful, but it deletes the cracked file. 

When it offers the opportunity to analyse the problem, allowing it to do so does finish the installation. However I don't get any razor ad indicating a successful installation, and the program tells me to insert the borderlands DVD, even if I've recopied the crack a split second after it was deleted. 

How do I make the securom internet based check piss off?"
,thenemeses,2011-04-25T00:02Z,"...and now I got it. 

Don't worry about securom deleting the crack, that's okay. After the installation totally finishes, put another copy of the crack into the binaries folder.

Yes, the binaries folder. If you try to run the crack from the borderlands folder, it complains about a missing .dll file that isn't missing, because it's in the binaries folder. If you try to run the uncracked file from the binaries folder, not surprisingly, it complains that you need the DVD.

So yes, it works. The instructions could have been clearer, but it works. "

- Wait a while

- When the 1722 error pops up, just pull your pc's plug out of the machine and put it back

- Start your pc

- Copy the files provided on the .iso in the Crack folder to the install map of borderlands

- PLAY

It also stated that my windows was shut down due to this creating an infinite loop. Anny thoughts as to what may have caused this?

Install Notes
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Extract RARs
 2. Mount or Burn image
 3. Install the game
 4. Important!! While installing replace the original exe with the 
    cracked Borderlands.exe from Razor1911\Install directoy after the DirectX
    installation!!
 5. Important! While installing copy the cracked exe from Razor1911\Crack directory
    to the .\{$InstallDirectory}\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\ directory!
    (Not the Binaries directory!)
 6. Play the retail!

,Chaos8035,2011-11-16T08:45Z,"So I've gotten this to work before by taking the contents of the iso and putting it on a dual layer dvd and running the game that way in which case I never had to bother with the whole install thing, just replaced the exe in binaries and ran it.

Thing is now I'm at a friends house in California some 2300 miles from Michigan where my comp is at heh and decided to put BL on his comp, since I have no dual layer discs to do it my way I did it via the install sequence everyone says to do in the comments.

Now my problem is I need to get this to work online, I have no issue getting it to work on my comp but for some reason when I swap out the exe files from the crack folder I get an R6025 runtime error stating a ""Virtual Call failure"" had happened and I can't run the game. (mind you I've put the 1.41 patch in place, also downloaded from here and never had issues running that at home either)

So my question is how do I get around this? I tried googling C++ Runtime thinking it could be solved if I updated it but the program says it's got a newer version heh.

Also did the compatibility mode thing with XP-SP 3 and run as admin. GFX drivers are up to date, had to do that since we run FFXIV on here and that game's engine Crystal Tools is far more advanced than BL will ever be.

It just seems to be a matter of when I swap out the exe files I think. Any idea's or suggestions, maybe I've not thought of something."

,Lycanthrope321,2011-12-29T07:42Z,"Worked after following some people's comments. It translated the sloppy english in the .nfo file. This is how I worked it out:

Basically I did the usual. Mount the .iso file with Daemon tools or just extract the files out. Both works.

The installer screen will pop out when you run it. Press INSTALL.

A main installer window will appear. A smaller installer window will appear randomly at the initial installation. When the random window stops appearing, the main installer will say Installing DirectX or something similar. Wait for it to finish.

After it finishes, it will start copying out the game files. I waited for the progress bar to reach about 25%. Then I copied the Borderlands.exe in the Razor folder of the mounted .iso file. I pasted it to the Binaries folder of the game folder, replacing the original one.

Then I waited for it to finish. Because the guides say that you have to copy the other Borderlands.exe file in the crack folder and overwrite it in the game folder, I panicked a bit when the main game folder didn't show any .exe files and the progress bar was reaching full. It was my third time trying to install this.

So I randomly pasted the crack .exe file to the main game folder without replacing or overwriting anything. The .exe file immediately disappeared after I pasted it in. Then the installer showed that the installation was successful.

I wasn't quite sure if I had done it correctly, but for me the game works fine. My comp is running Win7 x64. You can attempt how I did it if you keep failing.

To all: If you finished installing but have problems playing it like jet black surfaces on the ground or massive lag, CHECK YOUR COMPUTER SPECIFICATIONS. Maybe your computer can't run the game in the first place, and not the installer's problem. Check the system requirements for the game, and if you are sure that your computer meets the requirements, then try reinstalling. If nothing works, you THEN need to seek help from others."

,mjgamer,2012-06-06T16:06Z,Is this the physical copy pirated version or the digital copy pirated?
,itaav,2012-06-09T14:24Z,"Simple, easy to install.

Mount iso with Daemon tools lite, click install.  Once its done just navigate into the mounted iso and copy Razor1911CrackBorderlands.exe to C:Program Files (x86)2K GamesGearbox SoftwareBorderlandsBinaries
then just run the disk and you should be good to go.

,jackal21,2012-06-15T03:25Z,"Ok so I followed the extact instructions from user ""Harrewho"" on page 2 and I still can't play the game. The game is technically installed, and I can click on ""Play Borderlands"" but the same comes up where it says ""Please insert the original Borderlands CD/DVD"". Can anybody help me?"
,jackal21,2012-06-15T03:41Z,"Ok new problem, gonna be hard to explain. But I had my ""Gearsoftware"" folder and another ""borderlands"" folder which had everything both under one folder, I decided to move the ""gearsoftware"" folder within the other one now when I press play I don't get the error, but nothing happens"

,akshaybz,2012-07-09T06:56Z,"Works perfect.
I was getting this error while installing:
""Installation ended prematurely because of an error"".
Fixed by a google search :P
For those who are getting ""no CD/DVD"", they have not replaced the borderlands.exe from crack folder to the binaries folder in install directory."
