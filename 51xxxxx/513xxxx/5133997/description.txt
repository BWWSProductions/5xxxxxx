For The Kids series is a unique collection of classic, contemporary and original children's songs performed by an eclectic variety of talented musicians, including Barenaked Ladies, Of Montreal, Moby, Mates Of State and Hem. A portion of the proceeds in the US will benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation. 

Nettwerk and VH1 Save The Music initially teamed up in 2002 around the release of the first For The Kids album with a goal of creating a children's album that would be just as enjoyable for adults as for kids. The response was overwhelming - notes and emails from parents and teachers across the country and fantastic reviews poured in. Nettwerk was inspired by the response and decided to release For The Kids Too in 2004. Three years later, both albums continue to be parent favorites and still end up on "best of" lists.
