,Deathstryker,2009-10-24T07:44Z,Transformers wasn't officially fixed in this released. It will probably be fixed in the next version.
,cressdadd_1,2009-10-24T08:15Z,yeah i tried what mkbarin said and it went from 5mb to like 82 gig on full disk and like 75 different file with the same amount of time on the main movie and i keep getting errors on reading it but thanks anyway let me know if anyone gets it
,mkbarin,2009-10-24T15:13Z,I also got alot of errors on trying to get the transformers to copy I kept clicking on ignore all and it eventually copied at 65% quality but it took a long time to copy it.

have you tried using clonedvd 4 or anydvd and clone dvd 2 to burn trnasformers 2 ?

maybe if you d/load total converter and convert the movie first and then burn it..... it will take a while to convert though (about 1 to 3 hours)"
,fredpc,2009-10-24T23:41Z,"transformers *
btw use the convert and burn option in this app...you can find it here
