,justeve,2009-11-23T23:16Z,"Ok this is a modded version of cod 5 its got god mode no clip and give all and works in campaign and online zombies.
If you want this and dont want to download much then all you need to do is create a copy of your cod5,rename it to  XGD2DVD_NTSC Mod and let this torrent check against your version.
You will only need 12 mb if done right"
