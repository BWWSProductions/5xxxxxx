My original upload of this movie was from VHSRip and pretty bad quality.
I have since found a better copy. This is it.

The subtitles made for my first upload fit this newer copy okay.

The title of this upload should read "The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982) TV updated."

But I mistakenly deleted the old file before trying to update it.

Pirate Bay does not like that. They think I am reloading a deleted file, even
though the name is diffferent.




Notify me of any problems or mistakes.
