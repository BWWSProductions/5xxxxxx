Idolatry in Judaism and Christianity â€“ Collection 2:

This upload is a continuation of last week's and we examine here several forms of idolatry: more on worship of images, worship of the Cross, of the serpent, and of the dead. Another venue for idolatry is in the practice of witchcraft and black magic. Here, the practitioners pay allegiance to demons as gods, and often make sacrifices to them. It is interesting to note that several Popes were known to have been active practitioners of witchcraft.
