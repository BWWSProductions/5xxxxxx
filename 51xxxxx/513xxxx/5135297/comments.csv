,tre.work,2009-10-25T04:41Z,"Yeah, pirate this one, it is way way over-rated, the internet hype so manufactured I feel duped to have bought a real ticket. Entirely dull, derivative of Blair and Blair's precursors, and with a Steven Speilberg bogus ending. Pirate its ass."
,sxp64,2009-10-29T14:37Z,FAKE ! Don't fall for it.
,rapter,2009-11-02T05:37Z,This file is bogus. It doesn't play then redirects you to some BS site that says you have to take a survey in order to play the file. Why do people bother uploading this bullshit?
,Mexako,2009-11-14T01:45Z,"Oi dickhead..? thanks for wasting my time downloading this bullshit... PLEASE no one DOWNLOAD this - ITS FAKE. Eactly what ""rapter"" said."
