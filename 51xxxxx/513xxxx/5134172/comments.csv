,cdog21,2009-10-24T04:40Z,"@ DaveDac


I've had the same problem the last couple of weeks with all of eztv's torrents. No idea why because it always says that people are seeding and leeching in large numbers."
,rightler,2009-10-24T04:46Z,i would love to see what eztv himself has to say about his site and tracker status!
,razin_the_furious,2009-10-24T06:17Z,"The default trackers don't appear to work, but the extended list of trackers from EZTVs website are working fine. Usually one or two connect and supply most/all the seeders / leechers"
