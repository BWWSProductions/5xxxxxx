After you've clicked through a ton of folders, your presented with a lode of zips, each containing part of a multipart rar archive. You can't just extract the rar from the first zip, because it won't find the next part. Your only option is to extract each of the zips then finally! extract the rars.

This is the worst upload I've seen ever.
But it's possible to extract the executable without messing around with a proprietary scam like ALZip, Powerarchiver and others. You'll only need 7-Zip.
1. Select all zip files (e-vmw701.zip - e-vmw750.zip).
2. Right click on the selection, 7-Zip > Extract to ""*\""
Now you have got 50 folders named e-vmw701 - e-vmw750. Move it to any different directory.
3. Go to that new folder, press Ctrl+F (search) and seek for all embrace.r files. It will be 50 such files, embrace.rar and embrace.r00 - embrace.r48 in the search results. Select them all and copy to a new directory.
4. The last step: go to that directory, open up embrace.rar archive and extract the executable."

embrace
file_id

2. Rick-click or go to file at the top left of the explorer bar and extract to a folder on your desktop.
3. Open e-vmw701, there's a zip folder in it named embrace.rar, extract embrace. to the same folder on the desktop. Don't forget to extract the keygen to the desktop folder as well.
4. Now run the setup you extracted from the embrace.rar folder.
5. Use the keygen to register the program.

Thankful for shaving 15MB off of an otherwise 512MB download? That's a whopping 3% reduction.

,spitfoo,2009-12-02T19:19Z,"Thanks for this great torrent! Even the keymaker is completely clean (which is not a suprise since it's made EMBRACE-team.)

Despite the number of guides how to unrar/-pack this, here's a wuick one for 7-zip users:

1. Select the following files (hold shift and pick first + last to select all):

e-vmw701 
to 
e-vmw750

2. Once you've selected all (a grey backround appeares behind them to mark that they're selected) right-click with your mouse and choose ""7-zip"" and ""Extract (to)"".

3. A menu appears. Now click on the three dots (...) to select the folder to extract the files. I made a directory named ""Extracted"" to my desktop and extracted the files to that location.

4. Now you should have a whole lot of files named such as ""embrace.r00"", ""embrace.r01"" and so on. Now the next thing you need to to do is simply extract the one file called ""embrace.rar"". Double click it and you will see that it actually collects all the smaller packages and makes it as one, the vmware setup-file.

5. Extract the ""vmware-workstation-full-7.0.0-203739"" and you're done!

Install it with the keygen and try it out! if you like it, go buy it!

,Zinedin,2010-01-08T00:18Z,"I am using genuine Vista 64-bit with SP2, and PeaZip version 2.8.1 for 64-bit Windows. PeaZip is basically a front-end for 7-zip archiver. However, PeaZip integrates much better into the system in my opinion than native 7-zip. Although, both are very competitive and good software for compressed archive files.

Anyway... I was unable to use the Extract or the Extract (new folder) commands from the context menu to unpack the e-vmw7xx files correctly. At first, I started the unzip (unpack) operation starting from file ""e-vmw701.zip"". What happens is that only the data from that specific file is extracted (unpacked), and not all the other subsequent files like e-vmw702.zip and e-vmw703.zip, etc.

So this seems to be a problem with this release. The problem is that this part splited ZIP file won't consolidate when extracted, as if they were not linked with each other.

I tried to mark all the ZIP part files and chose Extract (new folder) and I only got a subfolder for each ZIP part file in that new folder, so they were still not consolidated. I then executed the full UI of PeaZip and gave it a try with different extraction options but the results were the same. What gives?...

I then downloaded and installed WinRAR as some have suggested in comments and executed the full UI, navigated to the folder, marked all the ZIP part files and chose to extract it with default options. This time it was a success! But choosing only one part file, like the first one ""e-vmw701.zip"" it gave also the same results as PeaZip as I described above in the first example.

Unlike PeaZip, WinRAR also has some nice update options when extracting the files where you can chose ""Extract and replace files"" or for instance ""Extract and update files"". I think the latter one should do the trick and consolidate all subsequent files with each other if everything else fails. I was about to try this, that's why installed WinRAR, but the default settings, with the update mode set to ""Extract and replace files"" worked fine so I didn't bother testing the other update modes.

So if you are like me and are using either 7-zip or PeaZip as your default archiver and it fails to consolidate all the ZIP part files, give WinRAR a try! WinZIP might work as well, I just chose WinRAR as the first one to test and it worked for me.

After successfully extracting and consolidating all the ZIP part files of this release thanks to WinRAR x64 3.91 I found out that the extraction job was still not done. In the new folder where I extracted the ZIP part files, named New Folder, I now had a whole new set of RAR part files, in addition to the very same embrace.nfo, keygen.exe and nud.jpg files found in the original folder of the download.

What the hell man?! This release is mess! This is unnecessary, why ZIP archive RAR archives? No wonder that people are making complaints about this release.

Now... bare with me... I'll be done soon. Now I had to unpack the ""embrace.rar"" file. For this task I could use PeaZip without a problem, as well as WinRAR. I chose to unpack it with PeaZip, using the Extract (new folder) option from context menu. It was a success! In the new folder named ""embrace"" I now had a file I didn't see before, named ""vmware-workstation-full-7.0.0-203739.exe"". Finally! Or so I thought!

I executed the ""vmware-workstation-full-7.0.0-203739.exe"" file, only to receive an error message saying that the given device, search path or file is unaccessible. It suggested that I may not have the rights for it.

Screenshot: http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/6120/vmwareworkstationfull70.png

As a experienced user I knew what might be causing it. When I saw the short 8.3 filename on top I was almost 100% certain of what caused the error. It's the long search path that now existed after several extractions of the very same frickin data over and over again in several subfolders. So I copied the file to the desktop and executed it from there and it worked fine.

Damn what a job to deal with this thing. I always use PeaZip and it consolidates part file archives just f"

5. The open e-vvmw702 extract only embrace.r00 to the new folder and do it so on to e-vmw750.
6. After done extract all the file, open file embrace.rar in the new folder then extract again which will give you the vmware workstation 7.

Now, this is not the worst possible situation because most of us are aware of how to just highlight all the files and decompress them however the jackass decided to also place all the rar files that are in the zip files into folders within the zips.

I did it this way and had had the windows installer extracted in less than 2 minutes. Yes, it is a little bit excessive on the packaging front but not hard to extract when you have winrar.

,14hundred,2010-06-11T22:14Z,I don't suppose anyone has a document that would tell a person how clone an os with a 1icense for 5iemens S7? Or avoiding having to re-authorize a os? I just lost my 1icense when i accidentally dropped it in a usb that wasn't the proprietary one i'm supposed to use...
,theonetheycallbiggy,2010-06-18T23:10Z,"the BIGGEST fucking pain in the ass i have ever had the extreme misfortune to extract. the one that compressed the files is a dumbass.

however, it is installing as we speak."

Indeed there are too much archives but if you are not satisfied... buy the soft ;)

I agree, this is not the most effective upload but I say thanks to Murlok who took the time to do it! 

And in fact, it works like a charm.
Peace out !"

,istuffedsunny,2010-12-28T20:59Z,"Wow, I'm embarrassed to be browsing the same site as the fuckwads complaining about the archive format. It's really too complicated to hit Select All, Extract Here twice, isn't it? Welcome to the internet!"
,istuffedsunny,2010-12-28T21:01Z,"Also, fucking google false positives while you're here, and enjoy your stay."

,totalwise,2011-05-18T21:02Z,"It's packing like this that makes you want to seed less. You have to unpack these files 2 times in order to get to the .exe installer. So if you're someone like me that wants to keep your download archives all unzipped, it means that you have to have an unzipped version, and the stupid original version on your hard drive to seed. Why use up double the disk space? So you end up deleting the original downloaded packed files..

I know these files are kept small for usenet and for public sharing sites, but please do everyone a favour an unpack before redistributing onto torrent sites.

Other than that, good upload, thanks"
