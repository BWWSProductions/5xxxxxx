British Reggae, dub & dancehall MC's.

This is more like listening to dub but with a dancehall feel to it. The singing is very fast & if you don't understand deep jamacian accents then there is no way you could understand this. Strong jamacian accents, singing really fast. However, if you do understand strong jamacian accents then I highly rate this. Excellent album with a nice feel to it. Requires moderate concentration. Happy Listening :-)
