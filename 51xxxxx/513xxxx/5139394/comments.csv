,hamai,2009-10-30T22:56Z,"It seems only dark scenes get poor conversion, other scenes get plenty of resolution in lots of colors... It's probably a way to reduce the final size... one can try to reduce bright in the screen, but I like the gray tones lighten up..."
,libertaswv,2009-10-31T04:48Z,"Fuck you, 'FSC', ya whiney little princess. If the quality's not good enough for you, then just piss off. No one wants to hear your frickin 'demands'.

 Who the hell are you? What the hell have you ever contributed? Oh yeah, that's right....Absolutely nothing. What a shock. 

Sulky little princess."

video : 8, was a lil dark in some spots, but might have just been the movie too. 
movie : meh, it was decent, lots of action, not really anything special, but worth the download for sure."

,N8tHeGR88,2009-11-13T05:39Z,"I have gotta be honest. The movie was ok. I enjoyed watching it but it was horribly thought out. When John Connor and Marcus destroy the t-800(Arnolds character in first movie) before he went back in time then the whole future and their present would have changed. Skynet would never have been built, John wouldn't have been born and no judgement day?!?!?!  I love when movies play off the whole time travel thing but hate when they muck it up. Watch 12:01    Thats true to time travel or time loop theory!"
,JoeScar2008,2009-11-16T18:00Z,"THX,,,FxM"

anyway...i like this film. its not the best, but it does what it says on the tin. plenty of nods to the original terminator..works great on a big screen with big bass. much better than most shite released this year like transformers 2 etc"
,d.ostormz,2009-12-14T03:46Z,"Q:10 
A:10 

The movie overall was shit, but cool to know how it all started in the first place.... BUT Judgment Day was better hands down. "

But I would give the movie itself 6. A good action flick but virtually no development whatsoever, even with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington."

,kopend2010,2011-03-06T18:53Z,"How the fuck is this AV 10? You dumb idiots. Thanks for upload but rubbish quality.

A 8
V 7

Not a DVD Rip."
,Harry Q Hammer,2011-03-16T11:00Z,"Yeah, kopend2010's assessment on quality is right.  (A=8 & V=7).  People who have posted that A=10 & V=10 really have no clue!

While it does seem to be a DVD Rip, it looks like this file was encoded in a single pass, as there is significant pixilation and compression aftifacts.

A visually detailed CG movie like this definitely needs a higher bit rate and 2 pass encoding."
,Harry Q Hammer,2011-03-16T11:02Z,Edit:  Definitely not a DVD Rip!
,MaskWhoRU,2011-07-07T14:27Z,"good copy, thnk you, a/v 10"

,iceman65201,2011-10-21T17:04Z,This is a copy of a copy of a copy.  There are hardcoded subs that are blurred in this movie.  It would be nice if posters would post their work and not work done by some one else.  The V is about 6 and the audio a 9.  This is the 4th one I have downloaded and it is the same as the other 3.  4 different posters posting the same movie.  Post your work.  Don't copy another and call it yours.
,CompleteCarnage,2011-12-20T18:03Z,THX U
