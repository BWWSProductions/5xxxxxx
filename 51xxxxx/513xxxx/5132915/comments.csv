[V],sailo,2009-10-23T15:50Z,"Thanks, MPAA or whoever company you are.

You help make this torrent No.1 by trying to jam it.
It never works with Bittorrent, in fact you guys are actually helping to make the torrent download faster with more people on it, when are you guys ever going to learn. 

And yes, thx, fed_cri , for posting this for me. "
,Cammo92,2009-10-23T23:51Z,Do you have Transformers Revenge of the Fallen with danish and swedish subs ??
,z0rr0,2009-10-24T03:53Z,BlueRay!? It's 720x480!!!!!!!!!!!!
,enritnt,2009-10-24T15:44Z,"Its bluerayRIP, its right ther on the title of the torrent, that means they took the HD blueray and downcorverted it to regular DVD (720x480) if done right this yields better results than doing it from a dvd9 source since the BR is much cleaner (and the 7x resolution also helps)"
,Gordaxim,2009-10-24T15:55Z,THanks for the Language Portuguese!!

,Owen_L,2009-10-26T14:58Z,"I have problem burning this to a disc. At least two burning software rejects it due to strange ifo-files.
Is there a real problem effecting others too or something I do wrong.
I'm trying to burn the video_ts folder  to a disc using Nero or IMGburn."
,e-asy11,2009-10-27T01:39Z,"@jus75au: It does not have the original movie menu, no. But a fully functioning, simple menu.

@Owen_L: If you're having problems burning the TS-folder, first use ImgBurn to create an image file from the TS-folder, then burn the image you've created as usual in ImgBurn. Or watch it on your PC-screen, if you have a good one, using VLC.

Just have to say that it is truly a good movie for all ages, fantastic charachters and a funny storyline.
The quality of this rip is also very good; pretty much just like a proper DVD. 

Thank you fed_cri, for this great rip! Good work."
,Owen_L,2009-10-27T14:50Z,"@e-asy11
Thanks for the tip. That doesn't work either though.
The error message says: VIDEO_TS.IFO is not a valid ifo file.

Has anyone had this problem and found a way around it?"
,Owen_L,2009-10-28T10:31Z,Problem solved. I deleted the whole thing and downloaded it again and the new folder had no errors. A case of corrupted data in the process and not something with the content itself. Sorry if I scared you away from this perfect download.
,arthurneddysmith,2009-11-01T12:44Z,"Found the video to be less than dvd quality. In particular, there is pixelation on the skin and facial skin of the characters. It is very distracting to anyone who is used to actual dvd quality. Disappointing considering that I have had nothing but praise for everything else sailo1 has done.

Thanks for making it available nonetheless."
,Ninis_mami,2009-11-05T13:11Z,"omg this movie is sad, funny, and sweet!! my 3yr old and i enjoyed it!! "

,olis11,2009-11-14T19:20Z,Thanks for nordic sub. Keep it up.
,olis11,2009-11-14T19:26Z,Burn it with Nero Burning Rom. Choose DVD-Video and move the Video-TS folder to new and then burn.
,.hmagnee,2009-12-09T11:13Z,use convertxtodvd it is great!!!!!!
,apoc25,2009-12-16T10:42Z,"Out of the other 15 listings I see for this movie, this torrent is the only legit BD/DVD rip.
