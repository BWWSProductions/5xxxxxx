,AzeemDanish,2009-10-28T18:53Z,"WTF... when i click on run uTorrent.. it says
uTORRENT IS NOT INSTALLED ON YORU PC!
PLEASE INSTALL IT FIRST TO USE THIS OPTION.

ANY IDEA GUYS?"
,Nugmonster,2009-10-28T19:01Z,"If uTorrent is already installed prior to installing this then open uTorrent first, then start the accelerator. Make sure your network interface is correct and you should start to see traffic moving."
,stingrayyy,2009-10-29T03:08Z,If your virtual port on your router is set properly this program will NOT increase the speed of your download. If you see the green checkmark at the bottom of the uTorrent screen you're already set for maximum transfer. Right click on the program and you'll see a lot of advertising.  Good luck but I think this is wasted time.
,Nugmonster,2009-10-29T04:20Z,This program has nothing to do with your ports on your router stingrayyy it has to do with hash checking and such within uTorrent. Why don't you read up on what this product does before you start talking like you know something. Plus I have never recieved any advertising from this product. Your just shooting off your mouth.
,Nugmonster,2009-10-29T04:22Z,"Plus I'd like to add Stingrayyy, your just another one of those idiots on here who talk nothing but trash and NEVER upload a damn thing, why don't you take your wasted time elsewhere."
,0u812_09,2009-10-30T01:37Z,"Works for me , Thanks"
,JTyler1990,2009-10-30T03:50Z,"hey i installed and i checked that the interface war correct. i can see ""bytes sent/receive"" move but when i click run u torrent it says its not installed. iv run u torrent 1st but nothing seems to work. any help would be gr888888"
,Nugmonster,2009-10-30T18:47Z,"If uTorrent is already running, and you see bytes moving, then you don't need to hit ""run uTorrent"" on the accelerator. That is just there so if you start the accelerator first you can use it to initialize uTorrent. It isn't necessary to hit the button again when you can manually open and start uTorrent."
,bvrsknr,2009-10-31T04:20Z,"I'm running this progy now,and do not see any difference in speed.At all
could be just me,but seems like a waste of time
does not seem to hurt anything either,so use your own judgment"
,Nugmonster,2009-11-03T20:24Z,"My experiences with this program are both good and bad, One bad thing I don't like about the program is it has a tendency to stop running for no reason. I mainly use it for those torrents which should have good download speed cause of enough seeders but don't. If the program stopped running I'll start it and run it for as long as it will go and it seems to speed up those slow torrents.

Overall I give this program an 8 out of 10 because I have seen improvements on several different computers on different networks. (I am IT Tech)"
,thibauld,2009-11-22T14:44Z,"shoudl my bites sent be positive or negative? in one network interface i see less traffic than in other networks, about 10^6 - 10^7 bites sent/received, and in a couple of other networks the bytes sent are negative, but there is much more traffic total, about 10^9-10^10? which one should i choose?"
,thibauld,2009-11-22T15:02Z,"oh, that last comment was a bit vague I see now.
i have one network interface with less traffic than in other networks, but the bites sent are positive. in a couple of other networks there is much more traffic, but the bites sent are negative, which one should i choose?"
,Ami115,2009-12-31T05:36Z,"Hey anyone, tell me, i found three accelerators for utorrent at piratebay. Does each accelerator program work the same? 

1. Ultra accelerator
2. Turbo booster
3. Turbo accelerator"
,93noob93,2010-03-11T15:03Z,it dont do anything .. preety useless
