Maybe not the best sound, but you can hear it."

,davthepunk,2009-10-26T02:30Z,"I just watched the sample and the video had a noticeable flicker to it which I found very distracting. Colours were very badly washed-out too.

I think I'll wait for a better release."

This is the full movie, with the beginning, middle and end.
The quality isn't as bad as I was expecting it to be from reading the comments. I'd give it about an 8. There were moments where it was hard to see but the scene wasn't that important.

The audio was great as well. I was watching it on VLC and I didn't have to turn up my sound past where I usually have it (6 bars in). As for the sync, I did not notice any off-sync moments. The audio I'd also rate an 8.

The movie in general was absolutely great. I loved every minute of it. The way the guy at the end was persecuted was something I've always wanted to be seen done in a movie and kudos to the film makers for making it pretty nice. The constant references to previous Saw movies is another concept I love about the series. And finally, the very end is a great way to end off the movie. I'd rate this movie a 9.

Thanks very much for uploading."
