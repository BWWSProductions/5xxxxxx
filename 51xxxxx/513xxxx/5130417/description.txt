Om det inte funkar att uppdatera med denna nyckel sÃ¥ Ã¶ppna mappen "Genuine Windows XP License Keys + WGA crack" och
fÃ¶lj instruktionerna i "Instructions + info.txt".
OBS! KomihÃ¥g att lÃ¤gg denna mappen pÃ¥ ett bra stÃ¤lle innan formatering! :D

Proper Reason:
The release from ConnectionResetBySatan was homemade, you
can see that the cd contains sp2 files in the root and the
EULA is for SP2. This takes us to the conclution that their
release is a homemade iso, based on a sp2 cd with sp3 slipstreamed
onto it. Its also much bigger then it should be.
So here is a untouched iso from microsoft and not something homemade.
