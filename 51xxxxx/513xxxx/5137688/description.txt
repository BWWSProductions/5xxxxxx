Yes is one of the most innovative and successful rock bands of all time with a
career that now spans five decades. In 2003 the band made their first appearance
at the Montreux Festival, despite having a long association with the town itself
(they recorded there frequently in the seventies). It was a triumphant night and is
regarded by both the band members and fans as probably the finest Yes gig ever
to be filmed. It has been much in demand and is now finally cleared for release.
