'Show Me' on my version is split between both mkv files.

Looks like you've joined then shrunk the video files down to 42% size. ?
My version has DTS audio at 1536 kbps. And my video is H264 - AVC.

The video on this torrent here is m2ts which is an MPeg2 container. Perhaps your source was dvd version files. Oh well, I know which version I prefer. :D

Not complaining about sharing. :D  But many people 'SHRINK' the original files for really no reason, all it does is reduce quality. And don't you hate those XviD & DivX rubbish conversions; these & AVI are so out of date now."

,petersky7,2012-03-23T02:03Z,"Ignore the comments above. Ignore the alternative torrent. THIS is the one you want. I used ConvertXtoDVD to burn the .VOB files to DVD. If you select DVD-9, you'll get a 7.88 GB file. If, like me you burn to a DVD-5, you'll get a 4.14 GB file (which holds up well on my 40"" TV screen.) 
Unfortunately there's no menu but it's up to the person who uploads the file to choose which format they use.
I hope this is useful to anyone wondering."
