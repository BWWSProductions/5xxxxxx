Namco Museum Vol.1-2-3-4-5[PSX-5

Description

Namco Museum refers to the series of video game compilations released by Namco for various 32-bit and above consoles, 

containing releases of their games from the 1980s.
The series began on the PlayStation with the tentatively named Namco Museum Volume 1, indicating Namco's intent to 

make further installments of the series. The series ran until Volume 5 on the PlayStation, covering various games from the 

late 1980s.

Namco museum vol. 1 released on november 22, 1995

This was the first in the long series for the PlayStation and contains Pac-Man (1980), Rally-X (1980), New Rally-X (1981), 

Galaga (1981), Pole Position (1982), Bosconian (1981) and Toy Pop (1986).
All of the games were ported from the original arcade version's source code â€” Galaga allowed for an alternative 

screenmode to compensate for the lack of vertical monitor, whereby the scoreboard was located on the left of the screen, 

or rotated the image 90 degrees if the user possessed a vertical monitor or was willing to risk placing the 

television/monitor on its side. Pac-Man allowed the same. The games in Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary Arcade 

Collection were emulated using the original game ROMs.

Namco museum vol. 2 released on february 9, 1996 (Western Version)

The second installment of the PlayStation series features Mappy (1983), Xevious (1982), Galaga sequel Gaplus (1984), 

Grobda (1984) (a Xevious "spinoff"), Dragon Buster (1984) and Super Pac-Man (1982) (in western versions), and Cutie Q 

(1979) (in the Japanese version). Although Cutie Q is only playable in the Japanese version, its code can be found on the 

American release of this compilation. It enjoyed similar success to the original, and contained a similar "museum" mode. 

The Japanese version also features Bomb Bee (1979) as a hidden game. There is a glitch in this volume where in Dragon 

Buster the Hi-score is not saved properly. It is shown in the Record Book, but does not appear in-game. The default Hi-

score is 10,000.

Namco museum vol. 3 released on june 21, 1996

The third PlayStation volume contains Galaxian (1979), Dig Dug (1982), Pac-Man sequel Ms. Pac-Man (1981), Pole Position 

II (1983), The Tower of Druaga (1984) and Phozon (1983). The first four were well-known in the U.S., but the latter two were 

relatively unknown. It contained the now-customary museum mode. Two unique versions of The Tower of Druaga were 

also hidden in this volume. One called "Another Tower", and the other called "Darkness Tower". Both are harder than the 

original and require different methods to beat the game.

Namco museum vol. 4 released on november 8, 1996

Volume 4 for the PlayStation features Pac-Land (1984), Assault (1988), Ordyne (1988), the sequel to The Tower of Druaga 

known as The Return of Ishtar (1986) Genpei Toma Den (1986), and Assault Plus (1988) as a hidden game. The usual 

museum mode was included. Genpei Toma Den was renamed "Genji and the Heike Clans" in this collection.
