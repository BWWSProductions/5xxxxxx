In order to improve the sound, do the following:

Use The KMPlayer (free download).
Open the player only.
Either right-click the middle of the screen and select Control Box, or click the small circular icon on the lower-left collection of icons, or (Alt. G).
With the Control Box open, click in the middle-left part on PRESETS.
Select Full Treble in the displayed window.

Remember, this is a permanent setting for the player and treble will be added
to the next movie viewed with the player. After watching the faulty video, be sure to go through the same procedure, and in the last step, select (Default).

Sophisticated viewers can even improve upon this.
