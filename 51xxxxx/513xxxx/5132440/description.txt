Three Asian masters of horror spin twisted tales in this terrifying trilogy. Hong Kong's Fruit Chan directs "Dumplings," in which an aging actress's obsession with recapturing her youth leads to an unnatural diet. In Korean filmmaker Chan-wook Park's "Cut," a movie extra with a grudge torments a successful director. And in "Box," from Japan's Takashi Miike, sibling rivalry and jealousy reach disturbing new heights.
