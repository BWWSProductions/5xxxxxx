,JebusKryst,2009-10-28T09:23Z,Thanks dmfunk. This is the best show ever! Does anyone have season2? Cant find it anywhere
,dmfunk,2009-10-30T00:49Z,"Season 2 is considered the extra specials between series 1 and 3, which are the following:

Spinners and Losers
The Rise of the Nutters (also called xmas special)
Opposition Extra

All three specials are floating around torrentland, just do some searching and you'll find :)"
,Faunsix,2009-11-08T16:18Z,"Does anyone have any idea where to get the most recent torrents for series 3? I can't believe that a show as brilliantly written and funny as this doesn't have more active torrents. 
If I was in the UK, I would be uploading the most recent episodes, but i'm not, so I can't.."
