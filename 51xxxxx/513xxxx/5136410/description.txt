The first episode of the third series of 'The Thick of It', which aired October 24th 2009 on the BBC.

From Wikipedia:
The Thick of It is a British comedy television series, which satirises the inner workings of modern British government. It was first broadcast on BBC Four in 2005, and has so far completed six half-hour episodes and two special hour-long episodes to coincide with Christmas and Gordon Brown's appointment as Prime Minister. To date, the series has earned Best New Comedy and Best Comedy Performer for Chris Langham at the 2005 British Comedy Awards, and won Best Situation Comedy and Best Comedy Performance, also for Langham (although Peter Capaldi was also nominated), at the 2006 BAFTAs.

Great show!
