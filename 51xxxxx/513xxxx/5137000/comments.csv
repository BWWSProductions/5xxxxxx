,DaveTehSlave,2009-10-26T18:52Z,"Correction on my comment: I meant nuked RELOADED release, not the Proper. My bad. Yeah, I'll be seeding for a while when this gets done, but at this rate it won't be until tomorrow."

,Lokk,2009-10-26T20:02Z,Thanks for this!!  Grabbed it at a solid 12MB/s here in Korea.  Will be seeding for a few days as well.
[T],Ex_Exist,2009-10-26T20:05Z,"Knaster, during installation place files since an image of a disk from a directory ""Razor1911\Install\Borderlands.exe""-> in ""\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries \""

,Rhonselak,2009-10-27T15:53Z,"@ mike
You have to extract the ISO out of the 001 file with WinRar"
,scotchy,2009-10-27T19:47Z,"Come on people, seed!!!"
,cyber15,2009-10-27T21:48Z,"Hmm, after I've installed it (yes, I did it the Razor way), 
I get: Borderlands has stopped working, then it says some shit about some file missing.

Anyone else got this prob and fixed it, plz tell me how if you have.

Gr8 UL otherwise, just my damn computer who dont like me ;("
,BloodStainD,2009-10-28T00:08Z,"I'm getting the 1335 error during installation as well =\ ""Error 1335. The cabinet file 'Setup3.cab' required for this installation is corrupt and cannot be used.

,BloodStainD,2009-10-28T00:30Z,"re-extracted still get the same error, except this time its setup4.cab (the file isn't corrupt, i was able to extract it manually) soo idk wtf is going on -.-"

,Gose023,2009-10-31T01:55Z,"With me everything went fine, but when the intro ended end the actual game started there was no sound!!! 

does someone know how to fix this?"
,taeyeon,2009-10-31T13:55Z,"i took abt 3 days to get this whole thing going, but it's paying off now :D

well here are some things i think that should be made known to people who are dling from this torrent:

1) The torrented files come in parts. Do NOT use HJsplit to join the files. I'm on vista so i couldn't see the file extensions and went to join them up, only to find myself screwing up.

2) Drag and drop the first part over WinRAR and extract away. I tried using 7zip but it didn't really work out for me.. but it might for you.

3) As for installation, the installation notes seemed pretty confusing to me. 

""4. Important!! While installing replace the original exe with the 
    cracked Borderlands.exe from Razor1911Install directoy after the DirectX
    installation!!""
This part is simply trying to say that once your installation has completed the part for DirectX, navigate to the borderlands BINARY folder. For eg, My Computer\C: drive \Program Files\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries

""5. Important! While installing copy the cracked exe from Razor1911Crack directory
    to the .{$InstallDirectory}Gearbox SoftwareBorderlands directory!
    (Not the Binaries directory!)""

As for this one, it means that you simply copy and paste the .exe from the 'Crack' folder to My Computer\C: drive \Program Files\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands, where you should be able to see the 5 main folders - ""Binaries"", ""Engine"", ""EULA"", ""Readme"" and ""WillowGame"". Just paste this .exe in the directory with these 5 files. 

Hope this helps!  "
,4LexMiguel,2009-11-02T11:49Z,"Even thou cracked , can you still play online Co-op or just SP ?"
,4LexMiguel,2009-11-02T11:54Z,"@ Gose23

hmm , try to reinstall , check audio settings on game , check audio settings on overall volume for your PC , check your plug and play connections for audio devices , if using headset make sure volume is turned up . When it comes to audio theres millions of things you may have overlooked . "
,Ridikewl,2009-11-04T10:50Z,"Oi.. Well I tried installing this like six times now. Got past the 1722 error. Finishes installing and everything, but when I try to run the game it just gives me a protection fault error. Any help? :/
I really wanna try this game out, you know, before I go buy it for the multiplayer."
,a.don04,2009-11-06T11:14Z,"Hi! I've spent hours and hours trying to get this thing to work lol. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong!

During the installation I'm replacing the ""install"" stuff in the binaries folder; then putting the ""crack"" in the area with the 5 folders (EULA, Binaries, Engine etc...).

After the install the ""Razor"" advertisement plays, then I hit finish on the installation.  I click on the shortcut now thinking it'll work and my computer thinks (hourglass) then nothing.  But when I check my task manager it says Borderlands is running.  Still nothing though lol.

Anybody got any ideas?? Please? :-D"

,MrTupins,2009-11-20T07:31Z,"For those of you who are hacking the Windows Installer Error 1721 and are on xp, windows 7, or the whole safe mode or Administrative mode hasn't worked for you, I've discovered another way to make it work.

I was having the same problem you guys were. So I decided to try extracting ALL files to a folder instead of running it as a .ISO through some kind of reader. So I just extracted all of the files to some random folder, doesn't matter where, using MagicISO or any program that can do this, and hit the setup.exe in the designated folder and underwent the installation process. It worked PERFECTLY. Except my computer's not good enough to play this... :( The textures don't even render.... Hope this helps."

,brasilballer,2009-12-05T04:49Z,"So, I downloaded this easily with no problems and then mounted it. However, when I tried to open the drive it said it could not read the disk?

So something went wrong with the mounting? Anybody else have a problem after mounting?"
,brasilballer,2009-12-06T19:58Z,"Nvm my previous comment. I deleted the stuff and downloaded the torrent again. It worked this time.

I am a little confused, however, on the part with replacing the regular exe with the cracked one. I went in to the razor1911 folder and see the cracked borderlands, but what do I replace it with and where do I find that?
"
,MrTupins,2009-12-21T00:27Z,"You replace the .exe in the Borderlands\Binaries folder with the one in the crack folder. This will be done one the .exe is created during the install. Then  right after, place the .exe in the Install folder right into the Borderlands directory. You should not have to replace anything."
,Allegedly,2009-12-25T20:01Z,So I downloaded this torrent and got a folder with rzr-bord.001 to 066 and .sfv. I loaded up Daemon Tools but it wouldn't let me mount anything... and WinRAR won't let me extract any of them... what do I do??
,minitt,2010-01-06T22:51Z,PLEASE SEED For the Love of GOD...
,Nybbles,2010-01-23T02:07Z,"Well, 13 hours to download it isn't that bad. I mean it could have been worse. Anyways, this is amazing. It works with the legal 1.20 patch and the two DLCs. And the most amazing part is that it works online. Thank you very much for this torrent. I will seed whenever possible so that others can have this amazing game.

Oh and to what MrTupins said, it's the opposite. The .exe in the install folder replaces the one in the binaries folder. And the .exe from the crack goes into the borderlands folder. Just thought I would say that because if you do it the other way around it doesn't work. (Well at least not for me.)"

when i replace files form rzr to bin it give me tryagain i cant copy when install is on"
,KinGgame,2010-02-06T18:10Z,"for easy install 

1 - install borderlands
2 - after DirectX finish's installing copy the app from  
install,razor1911 file to bin in borderlands directory.
3 - then copy the crack.exe for crack,razor1911 file
along with the bin engine eula Ect,ect
4 - after the setup completes you will get razor1911 securom bhabhaba..
and razor's sign.

give finish button

those who have errors

1721 - download the game and extract to a place in the computer do not mount it and then install in a directory which doest have windows files.

1722 - go to previous installed folder delete all borderland directory and the install

pls ask is any doubt"
