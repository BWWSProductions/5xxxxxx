-----------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenLinux is a Caldera Systems-maintained distribution of the Linux
operating system. Caldera Systems OpenLinux 1.3 uses a standard 2.0.35
Linux kernel. It also includes other unique features, making OpenLinux
the most reliable and easy-to-use Linux available.

Caldera has taken important steps toward cleaning up this rogue OS for 
the buttoned-down crowd.

Caldera has managed to make the installation process tolerable for the 
relative Linux neophyte, but again, we wouldn't call it easy. 

The installation utility isn't as pretty or as intuitive as the one 
provided by Red Hat Software, but it gets the job done as long as you've 
checked your hardware in advance.

For the client, the CD contains the graphical user interface system 
X-Window, K Desktop Environment, Netscape Communicator 4.06, and the 
productivity suite StarOffice.
