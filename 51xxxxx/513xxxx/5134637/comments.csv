,subbass87,2009-11-19T15:29Z,"Junk dl.  Fab only reads 7mb ""extras"" which turns out to be nothing and does not see the rest of the data in the folder.  Used Shrink to burn and the stand alone dvd player goes haywire, 0.00 flashing on the display.  Now if you're going to convert to another format and edit the problems out, it ""MAY"" work, but I did not try that.  If I can't burn your 4 gig vob format without major modification or conversion, no thanks...........  Checking out djfred's dl now, hopefully more usable than this."
