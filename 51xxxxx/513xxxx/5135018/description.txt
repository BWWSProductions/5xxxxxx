Flashpoint / Dou fo sin (2007)

A dedicated inspector and an undercover cop are working together to bring down a triad formed by three Vietnamese brothers.


This is one of Donnie Yen's better flicks. The plot in incredibly thin, but who watches these things for a plot anyway? The fighting scenes are plenty and they are well choreographed. A distinct (and quite unusual for this genre) feature of the movie is the presence of MMA/judo techniques. Donnie is insanely agile for a 44 year old guy. 

Cast: Donnie Yen, Louis Koo, Collin Chou, Yu Xing.

Anyways, enjoy the flick.
