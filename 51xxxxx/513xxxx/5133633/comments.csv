,SerialSinner,2009-10-24T15:43Z,Downloading fast 191 seeders. will be testing on a slim psp 5.00 m33 firmware. 
,SerialSinner,2009-10-24T15:45Z,Anyone who doesn't know where to put these files shouldn't be attempting to download stuff off the pb or hacking their psp.
,SerialSinner,2009-10-24T17:05Z,does not work on 5.00 m33 File was transfered via mp/root but does not play any file or transfer to video folder. Does not affect the firmware nor damages any programs but doesn't work.
,BurnProcess,2009-10-24T18:27Z,"SerialSinner, if you can't get it to work, then that's an error on your end.  I'm using the same firmware you are.  It doesn't go in mp/root, it goes in MP_ROOT/100ANV01."
,SerialSinner,2009-10-24T19:05Z,BurnProcess I transfered it to the MP_ROOT/100ANV01 FOLDER and afterwords there was still no video located on the psp. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong? After it is transfered and I turn unplug the usb where would I locate the file then? Any help would be appresiated. I have tested almost all the games and videos on the pb and this one is def the trickest. Thanks again.
,BurnProcess,2009-10-24T19:35Z,I honestly don't know what the problem might be.  If anyone else is having the same problem that Serial is having please post on here.  
,SerialSinner,2009-10-24T20:54Z,Ok Burn got it to work. For those running 5.00 M33 firmwear the correct folder to apply it to is MP_ROOT/101AVN01 This was an error on my fault didn't correctally title the folder. Burn awesome upload great picture and sound! Thanks again Bud and look forward to seeing what else you upload........
,BurnProcess,2009-10-24T21:44Z,My pleasure.  Many more to come.  I'm working on fixing the whole file naming process as well so files can go in the VIDEO folder.
