,4lib3rty,2009-10-28T06:37Z,"Dawkins is as religious as those he mocks. Indeed, far more so. If anyone had any doubts that atheism was a religion, they sure won't after listening to this. Whatever happened to just focusing on the science? "
,Donniedong,2009-10-29T22:19Z,"Any time some promotional joker wants to make a cent off  with the religion biz regardless of the belief system or creed, it usually makes for very bad voodoo, karma and usually has a ton of dogma BS added in the mix to divert the attention of the sheep while they are being sheared. "
,Donniedong,2009-10-29T22:27Z,"Most of the many other ""holy books"" including the bible, new, old and all the many rewrites and derivatives are just rehashed myths, fables used for propaganda to control the unthinking masses.
Think for YOURSELF. TAX all organized religions for what they are - FOR profit businesses.
That includes the Dawkins poops."

Atheism is not a religion, the same way the believing in a god doesn't necessarily make you religious. For something to become a religion you need tenets, atheists have only one thing in common: non-belief in god, there are no tenets.

""Whatever happened to just focusing on the science?""
Whatever happened to allowing a scientist to use science to test the validity of religion (which is what Dawkins is doing)?

""DAWKINS HAS NEVER DENIED THE EXISTANCE OF GOD. HE HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT HE'S ONLY SIXTY PERCENT SURE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST""
I thought it was 99%? Well anyway, on a scale of 1-7 in not believing in the existence of god(s) Dawkins is a 6.9, leaving a slight possibility that there is one, something that all scientists would do."

How completely typical of this idiot species. 

I'm mostly annoyed that this isn't the entire lecture which is my only problem here. (Hey. it's great to be an athiest. You never get a headache over other people's blindly-accepting made-up fantasy stuff.)

Remember to seed and remember that you'll never know who was right or wrong until AFTER you're dead. So quit you're bitching, and be nice to people until then."
