Digital Technology has changed the way we interact with everything from the games we play to the tools we use at work.

Designers of digital technology products no longer regard their job as designing a physical objectâ€”beautiful or utilitarianâ€”but as designing our interactions with it. In Designing Interactions, Bill Moggridge, designer of the first laptop computer (the GRiD Compass, 1981) and a founder of the design firm IDEO, tells us stories from an industry insiderâ€™s viewpoint, tracing the evolution of ideas from inspiration to outcome.

Moggridge and his interviewees discuss why a personal computers have windows in desktops, what made Palmâ€™s handheld organizers so successful, what turns a game into a hobby, why Google is the search engine of choice, and why 30 million people in Japan choose the i-mode service for their cell phones. And Moggridge tells the story of his own design process and explains the focus on people and prototypes that has been successful at IDEOâ€”how the needs and desires of people can inspire innovative designs and how prototyping methods are evolving for the design of digital technology.
