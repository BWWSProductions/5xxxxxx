EMERSON LAKE & PALMER - WELCOME BACK MY FRIENDS TO THE SHOW THAT NEVER ENDS...Ladies and Gentlemen 2009 (2CD DELUXE EDITION) 


Between 1970 and 1978, Emerson Lake & Palmer became one of the
most exciting rock bands on the planet. From their stunning introduction
during the Isle Of Wight Festival in 1970, the trio became a by-word for
virtuoso musicianship and the over-the-top extravagances associated
with Rock â€˜Nâ€™ Roll during the 70's.Never afraid to tear-up and re-write the
rule book on how popular music could be consumed and presented, Keith
Emerson (keyboards), Greg Lake (bass & vocals) and Carl Palmer
(drums & percussion) took many risks as both studio recording artists
and on-stage performers. Their marrying of neo-classical works to Heavy
Rock with dazzling special effects under arena conditions was a
presentation which had to be experienced at first-hand to be truly
believed!Releasing a succession of multi-award winning albums, ELP
finally called a halt to their initial career in 1978 though later reformed for
two years and as many more albums.Recently rumours have been rife
concerning a 40th anniversary reformation for 2010 and a chance once
more for the common man to celebrate the works of Messrs Emerson,
Lake & Palmer.Released in August 1974, Welcome Back My Friends To
The Show That Never Ends...Ladies And Gentlemen, Emerson Lake &
Palmer, the triple live album that chronicled ELPâ€™s successful 1973/74
world tour made rock history. It was the first, and only, triple live album by
a rock band to hit the Top 5 and become a platinum seller.Only six triple
albums have made it into the Top 10 in history, with the two most popular
being the soundtrack from the film, Woodstock, and ex-Beatle George
Harrisonâ€™s All Things Must Pass. The fact that ELPâ€™s album, which was a
live album and not a new studio release, made it to #4 remains an
astonishing feat.Despite its wordy title, the album was designed to be a
showcase of the bands raw talent, along with being testament of its
blistering live show, which had become the most exciting concert
experience of its time, hands down. Although taken from multiple nights
that that band performed in February 1974 at the Anaheim Convention
Center near Los Angeles, the original triple LP set featured the show the
band played on the tour promoting Brain Salad Surgery (the same show
would be seen by 70 million on ABC-TV in the USAlater that Spring when
ELP headlined the legendary California Jam before 250,000 enthusiastic
music fans).
