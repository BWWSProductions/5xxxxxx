I thank you indeed for your appreciation, but I think that my average torrents, though interesting, are not so ""mainstream"" to meet a lot of seeders and/or leechers; and I guess that having a lot of seeders and leechers is the criterion that makes you a trusted user.

See for instance: a recent torrent of mine of 9Gbs with a lot of hystorical progressive bands is seeded by a friend of mine who can have a good upload bandwidth (mine is less than 30mb\s, and as I stress in torrents infos, I can't keep all those torrents always on).
My torrents can be interesting: usually I have a burst of downloaders in the first two/three weeks, but after the average users decrease.

So I guess I can't be a trusted user :)

Anyway, thanks... :)"
