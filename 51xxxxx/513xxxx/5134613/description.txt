DJ Sebrok was born Munich in 1979, and raised in Regensburg. He was infected by electronic music from the early age of 14, and soon after acquired two turntables to pursue his new passion at home. By the age of 16 he was already playing at friends parties and quickly became a professional DJ by spinning at big name clubs such as Club Schimmerlos, Neue Heimat, Ultraschall... just to name a few.
