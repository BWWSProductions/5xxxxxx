Summary
The new Spawn takes matters into his own hands, and becomes vicious in doing so. Unexpectedly, Jim's acts of violence are caught on film, and the once hidden antihero emerges from the shadows into the spotlight. Reporter Marc Rosen discovers Jim's powers are beyond those of a mere mortal, and investigates further into Jim's background.
