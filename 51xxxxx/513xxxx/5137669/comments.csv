,mike18xx,2009-10-29T17:52Z,"Man, you are one insecure asshole, ""jonny"". You downtick my torrent and pump your after pulling the same spamming routine over on mininova.

Not everybody has 9gb of free HD space necessary to decompress all of segmented RAR files in your torrent, which you inconsiderately uploaded without recombining first.

THIS IS NOT USENET OR IRC OR EMAIL RELAY.
SEGMENTATION IS UNNECESSARY AND STOOPID ON BITTORRENT."
,StyxXer,2009-12-22T11:52Z,"Totally agree with you Mike.
Jonny! Mike did mention this is your upload but only un-rared.
RAR in BitTorrent sucks!"
,NateNavire,2010-01-01T09:34Z,I'm getting no sound?
,mike18xx,2010-02-21T10:18Z,"So...fix your problem, Nate."
,mike18xx,2010-03-14T10:40Z,"Everybody check Johny's link.

Does anyone care to continue arguing that an un-RAR-ed torrent will not eventually supersede the identical RAR'd one?

Case closed."
[V],-jonny-,2010-06-21T12:31Z,"More seeds on my torrrent, and the speed is much faster. Might as well delete this one."
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-02T20:32Z,I have now deleted my torrent so that there aren't competing swarms. But you're a prick mate :)
,Alver,2011-02-18T11:12Z,"Funny. People who don't have 9GB of free hard disk space... shouldn't be downloading high res movies in the first place. So, nonsense.

Be careful who you insult, kiddo. If they don't upload, you don't have anything to rip off anymore."
