,GAZZA2008,2009-10-29T16:05Z,"good i hope. 
or why upload a bad copy?"
,Eminem924,2009-10-30T19:18Z,It has pretty good quality. but the audio could be better. but all and all it's the best one out so far. So this one is your best bet if you don't want to wait until a better one comes out.

,intelliq,2009-12-21T06:17Z,"If 10 is a straight DVD rip quality (no compression) and 5 being a VHS quality, then I'll rate this at: Video 2/ Audio 5.

Im grateful to at least watch a little bit of this, I'll probably buy the DVD based on what Ive seen now.  But overall this recording is so dark you'll be lucky to view 40% of the scenes at best. "
