,krycek827,2009-10-30T22:01Z,"The installation of the ISO file works great, but  it won't let you download any financial info from your bank, credit cards, etc without registering it.  Registration always fails when I try it. Anyone else having this trouble?  "
,Xx666xX,2009-10-31T00:46Z,"many many thanks for this torrent..downloaded fast,installed perfect,and was able to register with out any problems

xX666Xx"
,krycek827,2009-10-31T01:11Z,"@xx666xx:
I'm glad you were able to register with no problems.  Did you install with the autorun, or install.exe?  Maybe I didn't run the correct file to install.  There was no included documentation to say which one to run, so I just let the DVD install it from the autorun."
,obaoba1234,2009-10-31T02:19Z,"krycek827: Try this:

    1. Press and hold the Ctrl + Shift keys on the left side of your keyboard while you select the Online menu and select One Step Update.

    Note: Using the Ctrl+Shift keys on the right side does not disable the prompt permanently and the following message does not appear.

    2. When the message ?You will no longer be prompted for registration? appears, click OK."
,krycek827,2009-10-31T14:31Z,"@abaoba1234:
Thanks!  that worked great.  I just held down the Left Shift+Ctrl and clicked ""Tools"" then ""One step Update""  Thanks dude."
,tachikawa54,2009-11-04T03:38Z,"Thanks very much for this excellent torrent.  After I burned the ISO file, it installed without a hitch, registered without a hitch, updated without a hitch and ran without a hitch.  It just doesn't get any better than that.

I did not have to do any of the control-shift maneuvers a couple of downloaders did.  "
,justdance11,2009-11-05T03:16Z,Thank You 
,richmunc,2009-11-06T10:38Z,"Can anyone who has already installed this verify that it is the ""Home & Business"" version, not just the regular version?

When I started to install it, it only said ""Quicken 2010"".  I thought it specified ""Home & Business"" on install, but I could be wrong.

Thank you!"
,xbillx,2009-11-08T20:57Z,"Installed with zero problems using Windows XP Pro.
I was using 2009 Quicken and the 2010 software removed my older version and converted the data files to the new format.
and yes it is the HOME & BUSINESS version.
Kudos and thanks to justdance for sharing"
,d.makalaster,2009-11-09T01:52Z,Does this work with out a serial or crack? I'm worried I might use it for a month or 2 and lose everything. I only need the most basic functions.

,james2008qwerty,2010-01-26T02:58Z,"justdance, do you mind sharing the original source of this release? 

I had a strange error today that's a symptom of a trojan / malware infection. When I restarted my computer, windows firewall wouldn't start, possibly because its registry key was corrupted.

I don't know that the problem was associated with this application (and it seems to have resolved itself) but I am curious and a little concerned, considering how much personal data you put into Quicken."

,auramarina79,2010-06-17T03:22Z,I'm totally new at this...I really need Quicken but I have no idea how to go about downloading it from here. Could anyone be so kind as to give this poor lost soul a hand? Thank you!!! 
,BipolarMonkey,2010-06-17T17:22Z,@auramarina79: You will need a torrent downloader. I use Utorrent which is free from their website. Once you have that fully installed simply click the link that says Download This Torrent. A box will pop up asking you which parts to download and just accept whatever it is asking you to download. You will also need a program to use the ISO file that you will be downloading as noted in the uploaders comments. All ISO programs are here on piratebay as well and should have included instructions on how to install them.

,riegal,2010-11-20T14:47Z,"How to install? Copied to CD but nothing. Clicked on all the autorun and .exe files I could find, but nothing happens except error messages.  Why does file have .iso.iso ... why not just .iso?  Am I missing something here or is there some magic to be performed to get this to install and run?"
,riegal,2010-11-22T01:15Z,"Despite the comments above, this will not install.  Only generates error message.  If justdance11 still insist that this is good, perhaps they could provide a bit more instruction on how to make it work (saying simply ""Burn on to Dvd with UltraIso or MagicIso"" is not sufficient.)"
,pro_torr,2010-12-24T04:57Z,"I must defend justdance11 here. As there is no comprehensive list of instructions, I will post one here so that others may benefit from it. 

If you don't already have a bit torrent client, you will need one. I personally use uTorrent, which is free form their site: http://www.utorrent.com/downloads. You will want to download the stable 2.2 version.

You can either download via the magnet link of by means of the torrent file, which is preferred. Once you've downloaded the torrent file, and if you installed your bit torrent client correctly, you should just be able to double-click on the torrent file you just downloaded and it will be added to your downloads list.

Wait for it to download. 

Before I continue, you will also need virtual drive software. I personally use DAEMON Tools Lite, which you can download for free at http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads. You will want the Lite version, which is second from the bottom. 

Download and install. You will have to reboot your computer once it's installed. 

Once you've rebooted, you need to right-click on the DAEMON Tools icon, navigate to ""Virtual Devices,"" and click on ""Add SCSI Virtual Drive."" It will add a virtual optical drive. 

Once the drive has been added, you can left-click on the DAEMON Tools icon, select the drive that was just added, which should be Device 0 or 1, and find the .iso file you just downloaded. Once it mounts to the drive, an auto-run dialog will appear. Run the installer. Quicken will then run and update. When it finishes, leave the ""Run Quicken 2010"" box checked and click ""Finish.""

Once Quicken is open, you will be faced with two choices:
1) Add a new user.
2) Import from an older version.

Personally, I selected new. It will then ask you to register. You may do so. Once you've completed these steps, just follow Quicken's guided setup. 

I hope this helps, everyone. If I left anything out or said anything that was inaccurate, please correct it and say so.  "

I clicked the ""update"" icon, and it went through the process and did not prompt me to register as it had been doing.
