 Brand New is the fifth and last studio album by rap trio Salt-n-Pepa. It was released on October 21, 1997 by Red Ant Entertainment. Red Ant filed bankruptcy before the album was really released. Salt-n-Pepa toured to support the album, despite the fact the album had no other promotion whatsoever. Brand New had two minor hits: "R U Ready" and "Gitty Up", the latter of which samples the Rick James song "Give it to Me".
