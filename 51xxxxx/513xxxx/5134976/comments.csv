And don't forget seed support TPB torrents, and 
show your support by seeding.  With all the recent attacks TPB has been under, seed this torrent for as long as you can.  And while TPB is still with us."
[V],Big_dude,2009-10-24T18:57Z,"Sorry for repetivie words seed seed seed.

I know sounds like a broken record.

But you get what im saying."
,kid2323,2009-10-25T13:52Z,nice game thank you!!!
[V],Big_dude,2009-10-26T01:09Z,"Noticed got a -9 quality, Don't know why anyone would rank this in the negative.  This game works fine just like all my other ps2 downloads.

Maybe someone didn't have a modded ps2 or didn't have swap magic, and tried to get the game to work well it won't no ps2 copy will
unless you use those two methods.

This game has been tested and works fine, no matter who game me the bad score I can you to 
anybody this game works.

Its fine you should vote better quality for this.
stupid why anyone would give me a bad rank for this.  Don't worry people this game is good and working."
[V],Big_dude,2009-10-26T01:15Z,"Anyone that can't get this game working, or who gave me a bad score write a comment on why
or what was the reason.

Also people remember that whoever gave me a bad score, could be people trying to be depective to TPB users, Like the same people that hate TPB. 

Download try it out yourself post a comment if its working for you. "
[V],Big_dude,2009-10-26T01:22Z,"Also remember anyone that gives a bad score in the future for any of my torrents, probably hates TPB and me. (Like people trying to shutdown TPB for example).

But just ignore the quality negative score for any of my torrents because all my torrents are good tested and work perfectly.

They probably give a bad score cause their messing with you or is someone just stupid and retarded and doesn't know how to get the download to work.  Or is trying to make me look bad.

But trust me Im a trusted user my torrents are good working and clean."

,Hamayumi,2010-05-10T17:31Z,"Wow, Finally, a working Rogue Galaxy game!
Thank you Big Dude, I will download this and seed for as long as I can! (I won't remove this on my PC, but I will seed/re-seed from time to time, whenever there is less seeders at the moment, is what I do.) (^-^)

Anyways, thank you very much again, I really appreciate it!    v(^o^)v"
,despilks,2010-09-16T13:52Z,"Hi. Ok, I have this really strange problem with this game. I burned it to a verbatim disc  and it worked great for a few days, but than suddenly my ps2 (it is modded) started having problems with the game. The strange thing is it boots up shows ps2 logo and then returns me to the ps2 browser showing that a ps2 disc is inserted. If i try to open it from there the same thing happens again. A few times i managed to get in game and load my saves but after a few minutes of play the game breaks in a strange way. I can move my characters around but music stops or if i try to get the menu open i get stuck with half-opened menu screen. The problem originates from ps2 not being able to read files from the disc i think.
At first i taught that the problem was with my disc so i burned a new one, and again it worked for a few days normally. After that same problem started happening.
Also when I try to make a iso image of ps2 disc with this game burned i get an error, as disc can't be read, so it image can't be made. This happened with both discs i burned.
O yeah my ps2 reads all other games that i have without a problem.
I am really confused. Can there be a problem with this rip? If anyone had same problem or if anyone has a solution please tell me."
[V],Big_dude,2010-11-04T18:58Z,"To despilks:

Well I tested this on my ps2 (modded with modbo v.4 chip) and never had problems, It
might be your ps2. 

Now if you really want to solve this problem seriously just buy the original dvd9 game like from gamestop or ebay why...

because ps2 dvd9 sometimes have issues when converted to dvd5 just buy the original and save the hassle. for me though this upload works fine without problems."
,ssgohon,2011-01-05T20:11Z,"Ok so there's an .MDS file and an .ISO...which do I burn? I tried burning .ISO first with Alcohol 120% but that didn't work. I also tried burning the .MDS and that didn't work with my PS2 either. Any help? 
Thanks"
,LynxV1,2011-03-26T10:06Z,is there a way to get this to work on pc? if there is can someone please tell me how to do so? like where do i get this emulator and how do i get the emulator to work and then how do i get the game to work on the emulator and stuff you know? someone help me please and thank you!
