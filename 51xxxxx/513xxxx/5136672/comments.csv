err a little lost here ""HolyRoses"" probably not the best target concidering the Quality and number of his torrents 28 pages last time i looked....i'd winded ur neck in and start properly describing ur uploads. 

So lets be honest only a troll or a flamer would make such a comment in the first place trying to draw HR into conflict ....YAWN.

Give me 28 pages of quality uploads i'll big u up  "

@ rabbit3: i dont have a problem with HR and I love all the stuff he puts out there on his own time just to make others happy.  "
