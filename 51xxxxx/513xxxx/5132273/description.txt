Like The Ramones, Screeching Weasel, The Queers, etc? You just might love The Maxies' keyboard-infused powerpop from Greenland!

The biggest band in Greenland.Transplanted to Redlands CA. Always in the top 10 on Greenland radio and G-MTV. We have two songs in the top 40 in Finland, Denmark and Sweden. We have played with and blown away most every band that has come through Greenland (Coldplay, Green Day, Slipknot, U2, Fallout Boy, Alkaline Trio, Bloc Party, Blink 182, Madonna, The Who, Sum 41, Rammstein, NIN, The Killers, Hot Hot Heat). These bands suck next to us. We are the true kings of ROCK. More Punk than Rock. More Rock than Punk! If you don't like us, you must be stupid! Your taste is only in your mouth! We would love to play yer town and yer sisters. We will be in the states until we are deported. We are soon to be in your top 10 radio. We will be bigger and better than your famous Black Flag, Dead Kennedys or shitty REM. Get ready for the best thing you have ever heard! WE RULE!
