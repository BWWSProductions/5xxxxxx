"Lets do it!"

On a personal note I am almost gave up on this video.  There are soooo many f'ed videos of this on TPB and the net in general (thetube fails me).  Even this source was screwed up, but it had the best video quality, just wrong AR and sync issues.

Wonder how much HP paid to get their Vivienne Tam laptop featured in this video?
