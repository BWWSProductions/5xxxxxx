A newest version of FineReader with powerfull patch.
Supports a lot of languages of user interface.
The patch totally removes trial limitations.
Patch "FineReader10-patch.exe" is identified as troyan by some antivirus programms. But really it doesn't contain any malware. During downloading and applying the patch antivirus should be switched off. On Windows Vista and Windows 7 it should be ran with admin rights. If after some time FineReader's functions "Save to" and "Send to" will be disabled, it should run script "Trial-reset.vbs".
