,Ov4ar,2009-10-29T20:55Z,Nice one ;)
,SomebodySomewhere,2009-11-05T09:46Z,Don't bother downloading. The patch doesn't remove the maximum of 50 page saves and the script doesn't reset that count either. Quite useless. The patch also identifies as a Backdoor in Nod32 although most likely a false positive.
,okyumarro,2009-11-13T11:31Z,"@SomebodySomewhere is a n00b who don't know how to use an computer...after applying the patch I scanned the entire HDD with Eset Smart Security an didn't found anything and second, this version will save more than 50 pages...I saved 78 pages, so you don't fool people with your stupid nonsense"

,XenoSilvano,2009-11-20T23:06Z,"I'm having the same problem as 'SomebodySomewhere'; I installed the programme the trail reset thingamajig-er worked however that 'trail removal patch' didn't!  

The message 'Can not access the file.  Maybe it's in use...'

(Maybe?) There's no maybe about it because I know its off.

'Please close the file before patching!'

Has anyone gotten this message besides me?

Now if I'm doing something wrong could someone please tell me."
,arabianmonkey140,2009-11-29T01:32Z,Got the same message - can't get it patched
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-11-29T04:59Z,"XenoSilvano I completely agree with you. The patch dosent works it says file cannot be patched it is in use. Though its not. I tried a lot of things buy copying the patch at different places on the installed drive and then run it but still dosent works. I even copied the patch file in the programme files in the abby fine reader folder then run it still dosent works.

ChaosMechanic there is some issue with the patch finding the file exe to be patch."
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-11-29T10:04Z,"EVERYONE I have found the way how to make it work if it gives error  'Can not access the file. Maybe it's in use...'
The way is Make a folder in the drive you want to install for example make a folder in c drive name anything lets make it ABBY 10
Run the installation when it come to installation directory click browse and show the folder you just created to install the programme there.
After when you have installed the programme. don't open it. Run the patch file. Click the patch button.It will say file not found click on find file.
Now show the folder you created in that there is file called FINEREADER its an application exe file select it click open.
That is it its been patched.
Close everything.
Do the dance if any questions ask me.
In the whole installation process trick is install the programme in your own created directory and then run the patch file it will ask you to locate it. then locate the finereader application file click patch yepieeeee"
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-11-29T10:35Z,Remember you have to turn off your anti virus as it will show false alarm for the patch file and delete and disable anivirus as you are download the torrent and while installing. I have mc afee and it shows alarm but it is flase so I disabled it for the time i was downloading and isntalling
,charles1234,2009-12-07T00:18Z,"London Bridge i followed your instructions but I still get the message 'Can not access the file. Maybe it's in use...' There is no 'find file' option :(

Do I need to move the patch file into the new installation folder??

thanx"

does anyone have the problem?"
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-07T17:40Z,charles1234 I will tell you a solution copy the patch file and paste it on your desktop. Now double click to run it. you will see the patch will say cannot locate the file then u just locate the file. so using that technique I told you to make a different folder and install it there and try to patch it. as the patch file is not able to locate the finereader application file it automatically prompts to locate it. Do the desktop thing you will understand what i am talking about. And yes what windows are  you running
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-07T17:43Z,you should try that as well move the patch file atleast on the same drive where it is installed or trying moving in instalation folder try it. it should promt or something to locate it when you dont install the programme in its default mentioned location that is c: programme files etc
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-07T17:45Z,charles if u still cant do it then I will do it for you u need a software called teamviewer google it download it then I will do it for you through teamviewer. 
,majkus82,2009-12-09T01:47Z,"After downloading there is no patch file...
Can some help me ?"
,majkus82,2009-12-09T01:57Z,"nevermind I got it.
I had to switch of Norton because it deletes it automatically."
,majkus82,2009-12-09T02:29Z,"I did it the way you told and it worked! :)
thx a lot"
,xyz3352008,2009-12-11T07:37Z,no patch file! My Norton removed it before you got 100%. It drives me carzy.
,xyz3352008,2009-12-11T07:44Z,"Hi

You may installed completey and works all right for a while. But the patch file has a virus in it, your computer can go wrong later. "
,sdwhwk,2009-12-12T06:08Z,"Actually I have the oposite. The cracks go through, but Kapersky is showing a trojan apon running the install. Do a scan of the install before running and it passes, just when it is extracting to the temp folder for installation."
,charles1234,2009-12-13T19:03Z,"@ London Bridge, I tried again with your extra instructions and it installed fine, thank you. Running ok so far.  "
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-15T17:06Z,"xyz3352008 it is not a virus it is a false alarm from your antivirus because the crack file makes your abbyy finereader run without serial etc. It is a crack file so turn your antivirus off while downloading and installing otherwise patch file will get deleted or quarantine by your antivirus. I have MC Afee it quarantines it I have to just restore the file from MC Afee. I believe other antivirus have a restoration function as well. Make sure when you run scan later on, if it quarantine again then just restore the file mentioned in the antivirus list and next time your anti virus should not do it. "
,alaoza,2009-12-24T08:42Z,"if you are running windows Vista or seven, you mus run the patch with administratot rights (right click)"
,6rtury,2009-12-26T13:49Z,"I have no problem getting the patch to run or work, but it totally wipes out the ability to Save, Save To, or Send To an OCR'd copy. The only thing that can be saved is the scanned image. Any idea of why I can't save the OCR'd pages?"
,boemape,2009-12-29T00:18Z,works fine on Win 7 x64. by the way ... okyumarro is right
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-30T06:38Z,This software works perfectely fine I agree with okyumarro. Secoundly pleople who are telling the patch file is not there because the anti virus must have quarentined it. You have to open your anti virus go to the quarentined section and look for the patch file. click on it and then restore it. That is it. Now install it. It is suggested to turn your antivirus off while downloading or atleast while installing. 
,brenoseifert,2010-01-06T13:08Z,"I'm getting the same problem as the other guys here. Can't patch the file, although I did everything londonbridge told us.

New 10.0.101.56 crack from Russia :D

Removes ALL trial limitations

original post from author: http://forum.ru-board.com/topic.cgi?forum=35&topic=43954&start=1560#15"
[T],FaeGiN,2010-01-20T10:10Z,"Hmm I was using this OK and the patch had worked fine...but then, after xmas, I get back home and I tried to run it today, but cannot save the book I scanned before xmas. a 500page book and now the app is returned to a trial and so I cannot export the pages!
I tried the patch again and it says 'already Patched' so I looked around online and cannot find any working crack. The trial reset that is going around does not work either!
It seems the 15 days thing is all I probably had but I didn't realise it.
Oh and I have not had the same problem as others are describing - the patch definitely found the file and definitely patched it. It just seems that it didn't actually work after 15 days or so anyway... ?
Now I am pissed off cos I just downloaded and run the patch that is given in this page, from the Russian forum...it worked apparently but when I opened abbyy and tried to save my book...nope. still same error.
Wonder if I can go back a few versions and still keep this scanned book?
Hmm.
crap :("
,org.foi,2010-02-04T23:26Z,"Had the same problem of loosing ability to save after 15? Days, reinstalled & patched in a sandbox, works fine now, will see what happens in 15 days now. Actually installed v 10.0.102.109 posted to a.b.warez on 1/30 by UHQ, but same idea."

6rtury got the same problem. You resolved it?
10x"
,ChaosMechanic,2010-02-26T00:19Z,"I didn't expect problems with trial period, but I also noticed that after some of time programm declines saving and sending OCRed document. I was able to resolve this issue by script ""Trial-reset.vbs"". It should to copy the script to folder where is installed FineReader, run ""Trial-reset.vbs"" and wait pair of minutes while appear message dialogue about successfull reset trial period. Sure, it is not quite conveniently, but nevertheless it's better then nothing :)
In all other aspects all work fine on my machine. I use it in Windows XP 32 bit. Programm was installed to the separate disk (disk D: - I have some reasons to separate some programms between disks). Before apply patch ""FineReader10-patch.exe"" I've copied it to FineReader install folder. Of cause antivirus should be switched off when you copy and run patch.
My apologies for any inconvenience. I hope now nobody will have problems with it :)"
