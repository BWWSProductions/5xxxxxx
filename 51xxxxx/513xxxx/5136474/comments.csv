,bennur,2010-05-16T03:15Z,"Unto Him is the return of all of you; it is a promise of Allah in truth. Lo! He produceth creation, then reproduceth it, that He may reward those who believe and do good works with equity; while, as for those who disbelieve, theirs will be a boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved. (Qur'an 10/4) "
,boggerman666,2010-07-05T14:53Z,shabi9: I see muslims still use super sharp arguments to make their points.
,banjar,2011-03-04T21:44Z,"I used to be a Muslim. I have listened to the audio of this book. And it is 100% true. Muhammad was a hypocritical, lying, false prophet. All of the quotes in this book are taken from the Quran and Hadiths, so you Muslims cannot say that they are lies. Rather, it is the Muslims who are liars. Islam is the religion of the sword. It is a false religion. This book proves it."
,manosteell,2011-06-30T08:14Z,"There's a reason why Muhammad is the world's most popular name.  And a reason why this is the only published work that has villified his glorious tale - obviously misguided, falsified, and propaganda driven twisted garbage.  Muhammad invited non-Muslims to come surrender to peace, and if they would not, he let them go and wished peace upon them.  A man spent his life throwing feces at Muhammad, and when one day he didn't because he was sick, Muhammad visited him because he was worried why there were no feces at his feet; and the man submitted to Peace consequentially.  Fabricated lies have no value and they are transparent; and when evidence talks, lies such as this work are silent."
