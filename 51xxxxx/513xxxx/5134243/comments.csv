,Shylock,2009-10-24T07:38Z,"Does it really matter anyways? if someone who hates mathematics or someone who loves mathematics says 2+2=4 they're still both right, and saying the same thing. haven't seen the film yet though to say if it is just garbage or decent. The world certainly doesn't need more hacks like Micheal Moore around thats for sure, no matter which side they represent, so I hope this isn't one."
,sandshreder,2009-10-24T07:43Z,"I have watched this, and It does not matter weather your a republican or dem or just some idiot from another country... America is getting robbed... that is the american people and sadly most Americans are too stupid to see that."

,sandshreder,2009-10-24T17:27Z,"@bozo2bozo the clown... no one who is watching this is a supporter of either political party. If you watch this documentary you would see that both parties have the same agenda they merely keep americans preoccupied with things like abortion, healthcare reform, and so called left right issues so they can carry out their real agenda of which both parties agree upon... one world Gov. every president since Reagan has used the term new world order, republican or dem. so take off your blinders and figure out what is really going on. dont be another stupid American"
,Hegelian.Dialectic,2009-10-24T17:36Z,"On top of that, while Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld were officially in office I was out handing out DVDs, holding signs on street corners and freeway overpasses, getting harassed by cops due to my bumper stickers, etc. So, I don't want to hear that I was doing nothing for the Bush years. That's a laugh."
,Hegelian.Dialectic,2009-10-24T17:37Z,Nixon also talked about the New World Order (used the term). As had others before even him.
,totonebadass,2009-10-24T19:13Z,"This sent a chill through my spine.  I am ""just some idiot from another country"" as sandshreder put it, and in my humble opinion it's not only americans that should watch this, but also the rest of the world. 

This is not only happening in America. The U.S. is just the biggest fish in the pond right now. They're trying to exterminate us all (or at least a large part of us, the rest will be used as slaves). 

Just unbelievable that there could exist such people with such ideals.

For all you people out there criticizing this documentary / (whatever it is)  -  have the decency to watch it before you start bashing it."

,Shylock,2009-10-25T17:06Z,"actually, it is Micheal Moore stuff. a 'movie' made up of a bunch of high impact snippets, for dramatic effect, often taken out of context. It isn't pro Dem or Republican however, and it's going on about the same stuff thats been gone on about conspiracy wise for decades......course our country has been going down the tubes for decades also, so ...well, who is to say? There is a lot of very good points, and I've always been of the opinion we should get rid of both the republican and dem parties, because yes, it is a fact that those in them are and have been puppets and slaves to the entity, not their conscious, which is how things should be done."

great upload! Keep spreading the truth, these people who commented on this torrent abotu Republicans are fools. They still believe the Republicans are worse than Democrats or visa-versa, anyone who has half a brain knows they are both evil. These commenters I believe are sooooo stupid they think its about Republicans because the title says ""Republic"" not realizing that the United States is a Republic and i has nothing to do with Left and Right. They also probably think being Democrat means the same as Democracy..."

The world hated George Bush. It's bad cop good cop. Bush makes Obaama look wonderful, but watch this film and you will see the problem."
,Ryuukai,2012-07-03T22:18Z,"Alex Jones, the genius behind the great oeuvre  ""Are you practising communism?""

These people are just spreading prejudice and misinformation and fomenting divisions. 
Divide and conquer, keep people's apart and mistrusting and fighting each other.


""They said men and women in poorer countries should be encouraged to have fewer children to help fight global warming.

So you think that Contraception is bad? Planned Parenthood is bad?
So you think that poor people should have many many children and then sell them on the street or let them starve?

Poor countries have extremely HIGH fertility rates. That's one reason why poverty is endemic - the poor have more children, and they cannot support them.

Also, i bet you don't understand the notion of Malthusian crisis. Too many people, too few resources => mass famines and deaths. 

It has happened before in the 14h century, and in slighter form, continuously in India, China, etc.

Only a completely demented idiot would argue against contraception and birth's limits."
