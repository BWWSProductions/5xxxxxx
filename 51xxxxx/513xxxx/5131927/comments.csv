,deathz,2009-10-31T19:46Z,"Im guessing this is not an UPDATABLE version? If so, what am I doing wrong? The program works fine. Though it does not read my phone. LG Xenon. Im guessing it needs updated, though when I do, it says the serial is BLACKLISTED. So..... Is there a solution to this or should I search for a new Torrent?"
