Ugh, I frikkin hate that dude too.  Its ass-jockeys like him who make it that much harder for people who legitimately want to investigate the huge amount of unanswered questions floating around the topic of UFOs/ETs. Any right-minded person might (just maybe) question the credibility of a fat Mexican dude who claims to have had hundreds of UFO sightings himself.  I don't know how much he looks at the sky, but I'd say I check it out about as much as the average guy, if not a bit more, and so far the most anomalous thing I've witnessed is a bird almost shitting in my eye.  This guy, though, he sees shit every Tuesday. Oh, and JUST SO HAPPENS to be a HUGE Mexican celebrity on his major radio show, where he can conveniently dump all his knowledge... which is either from outside sources or as a result of his own mysterious extraterrestrial-magnetizing properties.  The guy is a douche, so I share your hopes that he isn't a prevalent figure throughout.  Wish I could remember it, but watched a different video a bit ago which had a team of investigators go down to Mexico for a sighting... turns out it was a hoax by this kid, but Mausslan stubbornly stuck by his belief that ""the kid wasn't lying"" even in the face of incontrovertible evidence (camera time-signatures of photos didn't match his claims, off by 6 hours + obviously cut/pasted ufo).  
Shit, sorry all.  Done with my rant.  Thanks for the collection, I have only seen the first video, but was very impressed with what I saw!  Wasn't aware there were so many parts, can't wait to check it out!  Thanks guy!"
