,Adosin,2010-10-23T00:17Z,Thanks again Chaves!!! I get all my Bleach from you.........
,zacrilege,2010-11-01T20:49Z,"MrMaeth, they were only in Hueco Mundo to get Orihime back, or at least find out why she left.  When Ichigo fought Grimmjow, he was able to get Orihime back and thus there was no need for them to be in Hueco Mundo anymore.  Did you somehow miss an episode?

Userdownloader: bleach has only been dubbed up to episode 177 as of October 30.  New episode each week, check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_episodes for details."

A.8  (little bit out of sink) what show is? haha
V.9   don't think there is better on the net."
,zacrilege,2010-11-10T04:50Z,"after watching season 9, it appears that my comment is actually completely inaccurate.  I am actually a little baffled as to the chronological sequence of how this is all being played out, i'm sure it will be explained in the end, but i think i may also need to do some wikia research on the matter.  nonetheless, excellent torrent chavez, looking forward to future releases from you, much appreciated."
,nunchaku_master,2010-12-09T20:37Z,"Thanks Chavez91, you're torrents are awesome. any chance you can upload any more seasons after season 10... or do we need to look elsewhere...?"
,hitz_80,2011-01-05T12:01Z,thankz m8 :) :D
,rayness09,2011-02-24T11:23Z,Dude idk if you know this but you got your season all mess up this is in all actuality season 11 and your pass ones are about half a season half starting with season 8 or so back but 9 is actually 10 just so you know 
,azxo,2011-03-07T21:06Z,"Why is it, I cannot play these on my xbox 360? unlike the other Seasons... Is there a convertor i should use? "
,Osthrys,2011-06-03T06:30Z,"MrMaeth and zacrilege, the reason the invasion of Hueco Mundo was split by a season in the human world, is because it was a filler season. Think of it as being a verrrry long stand alone movie. The Bount arc that happened in season 3 was also a filler season, but they incorporated that in to the timeline seamlessly.
The need for a filler season happens in most animes that are based on ongoing mangas.  They need to put them in to give the mangaka time to write and publish more chapters and further the story.

Just to warn you, there are more filler seasons coming up as well."
,Osthrys,2011-06-03T06:31Z,"On another note, rayness09 is right. The seasons are numbered wrong. This is actually season 11."
,amsama,2011-07-06T20:27Z,Hello (: Can i know which funsub did you used?
,shooting.starfish,2011-11-27T20:08Z,please seed. thanks! :)
,Ismokeduhkronik,2012-01-21T22:33Z,"Osthrys 

Fillers suck aye bud, theres only 1 good filler season and thats the one with muramasa the zanpaktou ark the other fillers you might as well skip them nothing interesting in there "
