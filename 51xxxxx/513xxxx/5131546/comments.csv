Are you for real?
You can't slate an uploader for seeding a good torrent just because you have no idea what to do with the file it contains!!!
These are rom back-up files in the "".nds"" format, for use on emulators or DS flash-cards.
Some may be compressed into archives like "".rar"" files, others are ready to transfer to your hardrive or micro-sd card.

EDUCATE YOURSELF before commenting like that !"
