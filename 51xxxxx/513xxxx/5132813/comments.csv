,{Dotcom1},2010-06-13T02:51Z,"i got 2009 and 2010 to work on the ps2 emulator 
you need the bios`s and the new march plugins 
i got it to work on 
intel celeron E3200 dual core 2.4ghz 
ati 4350hd 1gb  pcie
3GB of gaming ram ddr2 dual channal

and i have to use the speed hacks on this pc
then it works perfect 

this game is only a little bit more demanding than 2009 game 

google this version 
EmuCR-Pcsx2-r3059
&
ps2 Plugins-11-March-2010.7z

best to mount image with alcohol 
then setup plugins to work with virtual drive
