Since the birth of man, eternal life has been one of the species' greatest dreams. For Dr. Ashtar Ahmad, it has been more than a dream; it's been a lifelong obsession. And while he has not conquered death's rule over the body, he has found a way to keep the soul alive - a complex suit that houses the inner being of the deceased and allows them to go on living. When a group of unknown assailants come of Ahmad's research, the doctor is caught in the crossfire, and his only chance at survival is an untested prototype of his most prized invention. But when the megalomaniacal tycoon responsible for the break-in kidnaps Ashar's daughter to use as a bargaining chip in acquiring the groundbreaking discovery, the good doctor must discover how to stop his enemy and keep his soul intact. Can he make up in death for his misdeeds from life?
