,Mangamaniac,2009-10-23T22:32Z,"This is NOT the disaster movie 2012. This is ""2012 Supernova"", a D2DVD release. So probably no fake. Just look at the imdb link."

,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-01T00:26Z,"this isn't a fake torrent
unfortunately it is a fake movie however
while i was watching this i just couldn't believe that any movie studio could ever create such a piece of crap film
and it just kept getting worse and worse the more i saw of it
this movie has been such a waste of time i am now spending ten times as much time writing comments and warning other people about it
which in my opinion is time well spend
i don't think hamlot had seen the movie yet at the moment he wrote his comment :P
it's such a shame that because the movie 2012 is a hype there are now dozens of torrents floating around of this crappy knockoff which are suckering litterally many thousands of people into downloading it wasting all that time and especially bandwidth on it which could have been spent so much better"
,dlarrym,2009-11-02T04:53Z,"If you look at the IMDB info you wil instantly know it isn't the movie ""2012"".  Only the truely FOOLISH/idiots, were FOOLED to think this was the big time release with John Cusack and Danny Glover. Just seeing that these 2 mega stars were not listed is clearly enough info to conclude that this is NOT the movie titled ""2012"" release that is due to come out on November 13th this year... The biggest clue is the name... the release is called ""2012"" NOT ""2012 Supernova"" as this film is titled."
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-20T00:23Z,"i'm trying to save peoples time by telling them it is fucking crap so that they don't HAVE to go to the imdb to find out for themselves that it's crap
capice?"
,mistergroenevingers,2010-03-04T03:21Z,this movie still reeks like a very foul smelling steaming pile of donkey turds
