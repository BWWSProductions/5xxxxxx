,k4killer,2009-10-31T00:20Z,"Ok, game works but i am having some wierd problems...
Every once in a while the game just freezes. Ive figured out that it has something to do with the graphics.
I have a laptop with a core 2 duo t9600 2.8GHz, 4GB RAM, and a GT 240m CUDA.
I have tried messing with some of the ini settings as well as the ingame settings.
Ive tried running in and out of windowed mode, tried disabling Physx, tried vsync settings ect. It still freezes at random times."

put the cracked exe from the DVD (/Crack/ directory or something similar) into the game files folder (overwriting the exe already there)

Tested and working torrent, for those with problems (direct play, 2/3 the size of this torrent, easy setup): http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5134235/PC_SAW-The.Video.Game.Full-Rip.-TPTB"
