,funnyname,2009-10-25T00:23Z,"thanks for the link, catsout! I got a sample from there. Sound (for the sample) is very good, video too."
,rippervanwinkle,2009-10-26T13:20Z,"The audio is ok on this one, no echo and it's in sync.  This is much much better than the prism release."
,rippervanwinkle,2009-10-26T14:57Z,"Correction: the audio is not really ok, it's just less spectacularly shitty than the prism release. There is a lot of crackling noise constantly, the echo is almost gone though.  I guess it's watchable now, depending on how easily irritated you are.  If you have even a half decent audio set up you'll hate it, if you listen on cheap shitty PC speakers it'll probably seem OK (blame the speakers ha ha).  

Is it really so hard to mux audio?  Maybe the source is from a cam or a microphone in the theatre. "
,funnyname,2009-10-26T19:28Z,"Yep, I use desktop stereo speakers plus bass box. I was not irritated. After reading reports about horrible sound in other releases I felt it comfortable with this one. Thanks raymondhome for up!
Everone may download the sample from
