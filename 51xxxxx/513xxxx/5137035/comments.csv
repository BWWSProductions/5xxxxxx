,balleron24z,2009-11-02T13:17Z,"Good quality, good dl speed, i appreciate the torrent.  I don't appreciate that the m3u playlist didn't play.  Thats because you renamed the files after the playlist was made, making it fail to link.  No problem though, thats no big.  Also, i may be nit-picking, but the artist in the ""title"" field isn't good.  Putting the artist in the actual ""artist field"" and then putting ""Tech N9ne"" in the album artist (or band) field would be the proper way.  but thats nit picking.  i'll fix this on mine.  but, what counts is you upped quality files.  thanks"
,MistaWigga,2009-11-03T04:55Z,"Truly a great Torrent, Ima big Tech N9ne fan and I love to be the only one on the block bumpin' the new shit.

,pyromaniac2000,2009-11-18T20:20Z,"i love the description for this....except for the part where you liken him to eminem, as him and em do not have similar styles at all, if one was to compare tech to someone else, it'd be the love child of twista, afro man, and esham."
