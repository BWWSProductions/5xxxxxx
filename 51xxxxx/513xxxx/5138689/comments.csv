,DevDeathKeet,2011-09-29T13:02Z,"""I must say, the lack of appreciation for providing all 6 Highlander seasons from one source is disappointing indeed.""

Wtf dude? Screw you. Did I come to your house and put a gun to your head and made you do this? No.

You chose to put these up. You chose to seed them. It's great they're here, but don't act all high and mighty about doing us all a huge favour and you're sooooo philanthropic. 

Asshole."
,boobar,2012-02-09T15:06Z,"DevDeatheet is a total ungrateful idiot.No one put a gun to his head which makes him even greater for providing us these episodes...Which can't be found anywhere else.
