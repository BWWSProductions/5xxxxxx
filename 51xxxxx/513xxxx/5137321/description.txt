"Donkeyboy" are the latest pop sensation to emerge from the shores of Norway. They're young, gifted and full of great tunes.

Their first single Ambitions was released on the Warner Music Norway label, March 30th 2009 - and thanks to heavy rotation on Norwayâ€™s largest and most important pop radio station (NRK P3) their forthcoming album, Caught in a life is eagerly awaited. 

When asked to describe themselves and their music the guys are quick to point out that they're a tightly knit group of friends who feel increasingly comfortable and satisfied with the direction their career is taking. They have set their sights high and are ready for hard work.

Even though, or perhaps because, they were all born in the eighties they feel a close connection to that decade and its musical sensibilities. They all agree: "The days of big budgets, big name producers and big, melodic albums were good days". As for musical heroes and favourite artists they're not too keen to be pigeonholed, but names like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Fleetwood Mac and Michael Jackson cannot go unmentioned. When asked how they're received by their audience, they add that they have sometimes been compared favourably to fellow popsters Phoenix. 

No matter how one would choose to describe it, it is obvious that donkeyboy are onto something good. The radio stations love them, the girls dig them, they're bristling with energy and can-do attitude. They are not going to leave the recording studio until they are certain the album is poptastically good!
