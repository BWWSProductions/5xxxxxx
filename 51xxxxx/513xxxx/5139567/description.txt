Miles Davis - Seven Steps - 2004  - The Complete Columbia Recordings 1963-1964


Seven discs paint a pretty good picture of the sound that Miles Davis gave us back then.

Some of the master's mid-'60s material has not been previously issued. As had been the
case time and again, the Miles Davis quintet was reinvented during this period. A perfectionist
with a golden tone, the trumpeter demanded no less from his compatriots.

Arranged in chronological order from April 16, 1963 in Los Angeles to September 25, 1964 in
Berlin, this superb collection traces the development that Davis wanted, ending with Wayne
Shorter on tenor saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Tony
Williams on drums.

The eight previously unreleased tracks include Victor Feldman's "Joshua," with cohesive
interplay from Davis, Feldman, Carter, George Coleman, and Frank Butler. Davis was in fine
form, and the music ran perfectly straightahead. Two takes of "Seven Steps to Heaven" with
the same lineup, but one moving faster than the other, and one alternate take with a newer
lineup and a false start, cement the piece as a standard part of the Davis repertoire. The
open horn arrangement makes the most sense, since Davis had a beautiful tone to share.

A thirteen-minute version of "Stella by Starlight" in Berlin with Shorter, Hancock, Carter and
Williams makes a pleasant surprise. Davis plays it soulfully, building his featured opening
beyond expectations. Emotions run high. Walking bass and ride cymbal keep things even for
Shorter's entrance. But he, too, builds his solo section beyond the usual, emotionally. That
may explain why the piece remained unissued for all those years. In all, however, it's a
welcome surprise: one of the package's high points.

Many of the sessions were recorded at live performances; locations include Juan-les-Pins in
France, Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo, and Berlin.

At the Festival Mondial du Jazz Antibes in France, Davis led an informal session that found
the music just rolling out casually, with his band at a creative high point. As the applause
appears during each track, we're tempted to join in. These are longer tracks: the kind that
allow an artist and his band to explore in-depth. "Walkin'," with its upbeat tempo and bebop
articulation, stretches out endlessly, with Davis, Williams, Coleman and Hancock finding
plenty of room to solo. The unheralded tenor saxophonist, in particular, gives his audience
something to remember for eternity.

At Philharmonic Hall in New York, we listen in on two sets with Coleman on tenor and Davis'
quintet on fire. Again, the longer pieces allow much room for freedom by each artist. "All
Blues," with open horn, etches its familiar melody into our psyche and stands apart from the
rest for its emotion-laden presentation. Similarly, "My Funny Valentine" gives us a unique
performance on open horn that remains unmatched by any other.

Sam Rivers replaced Coleman at Kohseinenkin Hall in Tokyo. The full set, while containing
no big surprises, once again allowed plenty of time for individual stretching. The songs are
the same, but the interpretations are changed somewhat. Rivers gives the quintet a mellower
hue with more restraint. His fluid phrasing gave Davis a strong supporting partner who turned
out, perhaps, too much like the leader. Rivers, too, could build his solo spots into something
furious and dynamic; however, the bulk of his work remained comparatively gentle. The most
noticeable difference came when Davis and Rivers played side by side in ensemble.

Wayne Shorter replaced Rivers at the Berlin Philharmonie in Germany. He gave the quintet a
heartier sound. Like John Coltrane, Shorter's energy went through the horn and made
everyone sit up and take notice. His full tone gave Davis what he wanted for his rebuilt
ensemble. Together, they produced a session that excelled: the same pieces with a different
lineup.

Throughout these 1963-64 sessions, Davis plays with his characteristic mood. Whether
muted or open, he pours heartfelt emotion through his horn. No one has ever done it better.
