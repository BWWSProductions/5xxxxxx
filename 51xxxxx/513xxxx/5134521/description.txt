Set just after the destruction of the Twelve Colonies, the narrative largely follows multiple versions of the Dean Stockwell and Tricia Helfer Cylon characters who have infiltrated the remaining humans, both on the planets, and those who have escaped into space. From there, the events of the series are shown from a Cylon perspective, and their underlying plan is revealed. Edward James Olmos states: "When Battlestar fans see The Plan, theyâ€™re all going to have to go back and watch the entire series again.
