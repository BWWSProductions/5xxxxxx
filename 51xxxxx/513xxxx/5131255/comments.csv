,lberry,2009-11-10T05:16Z,I am sure it is. Pure_screens is a VIP member I am sure he got that status from uploading virus's. With 85 seeders and 114 leechers I am surprised that there is only 1 complaint.
,supmus,2009-11-26T21:47Z,i tested antivirus PRo and slamen is telling the truth. it is really bad. im using norman antivirus now.
,goattke,2009-12-09T13:30Z,"This ""antivirus pro"" they are talking about is a spyware/virus program itself.  i had gotten it on my computer once and it said there was a virus on my factory copy of office 2003, so it's completely bogus.  pure_screens is a trusted member, his stuff will be clean"
,nostar,2011-07-26T09:01Z,"There really a virus in his movie, he did list the name Virus Vellons, I can't wait download it to see the girl, thanks pure_screens"

The people saying that it does have no idea what they are talking about and I am only saying this because it annoys me when people allow their own infected computers to think for them, much less having quality Internet security in the first place."
