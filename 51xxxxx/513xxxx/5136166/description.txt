* Gears of War is the first game developed by Epic Games for Microsoft Game
  Studios. Gears of War thrusts gamers into a deep and harrowing story of
  humankind's epic battle for survival against the Locust Horde, a nightmarish
  race of creatures that surface from the bowels of the planet.
 * Engaging and disturbing cinematic story. Massively scoped worlds, memorable
   characters and an epic story line play out like an intense and unsettling
   blockbuster action film. Dramatic in-game camera work and a compelling
   story bring the brutal, emotionally charged experience to life. Gamers
   control Marcus Fenix and his fire team as they pit advanced human
   technology against the overwhelming and horrific Locust Horde.
 * Fire team co-op action. All game modes, levels and scenarios are designed
   for cooperative fire team play (AI or human). For the first time, AI
   teammates are indiscernible from human players. They move intelligently,
   take orders effectively, and seek cover and defend themselves when
   necessary. Gamers will experience richer cooperative gameplay than ever,
   through unique characters that require cooperation to survive.
 * Unprecedented visuals in next-generation gaming. Gears of War ushers in
   the next generation with unprecedented visuals. The Unreal Engine 3
   technology pushes high-definition visual designs and brings out the
   smallest details in the largest battle. Gamers will experience a rich
   dynamic world with an unprecedented level of detail. Characters come to
   life with unbelievable model quality and a physics-integrated animation
   system that has them truly reacting intelligently to events as they unfold
   around them.
 * Hyper-realistic and intense combat. In Gears of War the battlefield is a
   lethal place and to foolishly stand out in the open is to die. To survive,
   gamers can create and take cover using interactive and dynamic
   environments, suppress the enemy with blindfire, and use their weapons and
   teammates to outwit and outfight their enemies.
