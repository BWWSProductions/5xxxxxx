Show Information:

In "Extreme Paranormal," irreverent paranormal explorers Shaun, Nathan and Jason investigate chilling local legends, attempting to seek the truth by provoking spirits. Unlike other paranormal investigators, they put themselves directly in harm's way - taunting ghosts, summoning the dead and daring the demonic to attack.

"Extreme Paranormal" gives rabid paranormal fans the ride they've always wanted: the chance to follow a team that dares to challenge legends, curses, and hauntings by actually attempting to provoke paranormal activity. These guys have spent the last ten years kicking sand in the face of ghosts across America. Every Sunday at midnight, they recount their latest mission on their popular radio show "Ghostman and Demon Hunter."

While other paranormal investigators keep the spirit world at arms-length, our guys lack that part of their DNA that tells other investigators to "be afraid" and run away during intense encounters. The team has developed a bring-it-on mentality when it comes to their explorations.

New Mexico State

Monday, October 19, 10/9C

New Mexico State Penitentiary, 1980, thirty-three inmates were hacked to death, burned alive and tortured with no remorse in what became the worst prison riot in U.S. history. Since then, visitors to this abandoned maximum security lockup claim there are confrontational tortured souls trapped inside. Our investigators want to see whatâ€™s really going down in this potentially volatile paranormal environment. They go as far as to recreate moments of this horrific event, even shedding their own blood, to provoke the violent spirits to show themselves to the cameras.
