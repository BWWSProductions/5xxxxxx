Please explain that retarded statement.

before moving on, I would like to let you know:

1. RTM:Release to Manufacturer

2. GA:General Availability

So, Windows 7 RTM is a final version, GA is a date. The Date for General Availability (GA) of Windows 7 is October 22nd. Which means Windows 7 will be in stores beginning October 22nd.

i'll ask agian 

Please explain that retarded statement."

You said you can install Windows 7 by copying the whole DVD to the drive. How would that work because the setup process will format the drive, won't it?"

Ok. So what are all the possible ways to install without a DVD drive. I am trying to go from XP to 7."
,iHacker0325,2009-11-04T01:52Z,"1. A clean install, using flash media, like a USB drive or SD card, you can use this tool to create the drive from the ISO, http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool,  This option can format the drive and blow the xp install away (if you chose to do so)

OR

2. Copy the file structure of the DVD/ISO to your XP desktop, and run Setup.exe and do a ""Custom Install"" in which a clean install of Windows 7 in installed and your XP is placed in a folder called Windows.old in the C:\ This option does NOT format the drive.

I like using the Windows Easy Transfer to copy all of your files and setting from XP to 7 (this is of course optional)  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2B6F1631-973A-45C7-A4EC-4928FA173266&displaylang=en"

http://wintoflash.com/home/en/"
,revtel,2009-11-04T21:25Z,"I know some of you guys are wanting to install from a USB drive. I tried the windows flash drive tool someone mentioned earlier but it kept telling me that my .iso file was invalid. So after some searching I found this method which works fine for me. It was originally written for Vista but works the same for Windows 7. So grab yourself a usb stick (4gb min) and away you go!!!

Create a bootable Windows Vista on Flash Memory
1. Format the USB flash memory drive to FAT32 file system

    Run CMD.EXE and type the following command. Note: This set of commands assumes that the USB flash drive is addressed as ?disk 1?. Double check that by doing a list of the disks (type ?list disk?) before cleaning it).

   1. diskpart
   2. select disk 1
   3. clean
   4. create partition primary
   5. select partition 1
   6. active
   7. format fs=fat32
   8. assign
   9. exit

2. Copy Windows Vista?s DVD ROM content to the Flash Drive

Type in command to start copying all the content from the Windows Vista DVD to your newly formatted high speed flash drive.

    * xcopy d:\*.* /s/e/f e:\ (where e: is your usb stick)

3. Setup your computer BIOS to boot from USB Drive

4. Install Windows Vista from flash memory drive"

If you mean a ""in-place upgrade"" No, you can not go from XP to 7 like that, your only choices are a ""clean install"", which is wiping everything and starting fresh, or what MS calls a ""Custom Install"" a custom install takes all of your XP file directories and places them inside a folder called windows.old on your c:\, it's essentially a clean install without the formatting, from XP to 7 those are the only 2 options, to do a Clean Install, boot your computer from the setup media, to do a custom install run setup from your XP desktop"

 and run setup"

,iHacker0325,2009-11-28T02:02Z,"Windows Starter=Lame

1. you need to mount the iso using magic disc, daemon tools, virtualdrive... whatever 

2. copy all the files to a folder on your desktop or wherever you want on your hard drive

3. ei.cfg is in the sources folder (i think) and delete it

4. run setup, chose custom install and it will put your starter into a folder called c:\windows.old

5. you can also copy the files to a usb drive and boot from that and do a true clean install , read my previous posts for instructions or just use google."

,guruPirate,2009-12-20T07:46Z,"Actually 'muufasaurus"" installing an Upgrade is better and faster than a clean install if you are going from Vista Home Premium to Win7 Home Premium. It's just an Upgrade to the next level  of that Windows version...nothing more impressive than several new gadgets and artwork schemes .

But of course there will be significant 
speed-per-use changes and spiffy add-ons... duh.

In the case that you are installing a new Windows 7 Professional from say Windows Vista Home Premium, then YES, a ""Clean Install"" is forced and there is no work around.

WARNING: Back-up the important shit in highly recommended.

It is ""not considered"" a NEW Operating System if you are merging Vista Home Premium with Win7 Home Premium.
It's virtually the same shit, but the changes are obvious and cool.

It's called an UPGRADE for that simple reason.

BTW... thanks for the upload!
Peace out you filthy mates!
"
,guruPirate,2009-12-20T07:55Z,"at "" mistertagalong ""


For anyone that does not have this understanding DO READ THIS.

Mistertagalong had "" Windows Vista BASIC""...the keyword is ""Basic"" fellas.

This torrent is not for any other Upgrade except for Home Premium...therefore mistertagalong
will have to lose all his Data now...

why? He probably thought the two Operating systems would MERGE.
However they do not.

They DO and will had he had Vista Home Premium previously installed on his PC or laptop.

IMPOTANT:
Find the Windows 7 version that matches your current version and it WILL MERGE gracefully without problems :)

So mistertagalong sor"
,guruPirate,2009-12-20T08:19Z,"oops! sorry about that man...

""mistertagalong"" was suppose to download 
Win7 Basic... so that's why it was taking dreadfully long.

then the horrific BSOD (blue screen of death) came to visit him like Ebenezer Scrooge. bummer.

In his case, the new operating system of 
Win7 Home Premium was conducting a clean install. So it got confused and had to sort shit out. hence, he got impatient and might have lost all his Data...but maybe he can REPAIR his previous OS by using the old WinBASIC CD 

He more than likely didn't know this before hand, so fellas? check your shit and make sure you have Windows Home Premium before you use this Upgrade.

Click Start-->Right Click on My Computer -->Properties -->and in the ""General"" tab your Windows operating system version will be displayed.

Get the Windows 7 specific version for that exact version ONLY if you want it to merge without losing important data.

[ The install will go faster than a clean install in this scenario only ]

BUT.. if you actually want a ""Clean Install"" on a separate partition so you can have both, then you can do it with no problemos, IF you have enough GB to support it. At least 16-20GB of free hard drive space.

And, If you actually want a Clean Install to ""run over"" your primary C:/drive... so be it.

The choice is yours, but make a good one 


Will this work if you don't have Vista Home Premium on your computer??

YES! but it will wipe out all your existing Data if you RUN IT over your main C:/drive letter or Main Partition all your programs are located.

Once again, you can have BOTH if you still want to keep your old shit as is....

LMAO!

Once you activated it, no further steps are needed. You can use the updates on a regular basis. However, you must be careful because there is an update ""KB971033"" which you may not install.

What is KB971033?

As part of its anti-piracy efforts, Microsoft recently released update KB971033 for Windows 7?s built in activation and validation system, called Windows Activation Technologies. KB971033 was designed to give Microsoft the ability to help you determine the legality of your Windows 7 installation. It does so by looking for software specially developed to circumvent the operating system?s genuine check. In its current state, according to the Genuine Windows blog, this update will be able to monitor the customer?s computer for over 70 "

3. Get an empty DVD. Burn the downloaded ISO to the DVD with DVD Decrypter (Mode-ISO-Write).
4. Get the Windows Loader from here:
http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Current-release-information, put it on an USB flash drive.
5. Backup all your important files on your pc.
6. Boot your PC from the Windows installer DVD.
7. Install Windows. Do not upgrade. Delete the previous version of Windows.
8. Do NOT type in any serial key during the installation, UNtick automatic activation.
9. When installation is complete, open the Windows Loader you downloaded before. Just click Install. 
10. When the Windows Loader finished, restart your system.
11. Update Windows, and your done."

If you dont want to burn to a disk. Use a program like Winrar or 7-zip and extract the .iso file to somewhere like your desktop. Then you will spot a .exe setup file. Run that and you will keep all your files, programs (basically, all your data)
