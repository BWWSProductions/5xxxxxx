,stagman21,2010-03-06T11:36Z,"unpacked like a dream - played basics okay, but game saving seems a problem, but I am unpacking again to make sure it ain't something I'm doing worng.

Thanks for the upload fireblade."
,DelphiUniverse,2010-03-29T18:13Z,"Does not work. When launching the Sh3.exe from both admin and normal account it gives ""Cannot launch 3d engine"" error and quits.

You should have shared the original iso of the install disk, not a preinstalled one."
,Mavyalex,2010-04-19T18:22Z,Holly macaroni! I'm downloading at alamost 1mb/s and only 93 seeds?! I can't believe it! 2.36 Gb in less than an hour! Waow...But with Internet through fiber optic cables (soon in my house maybe?) it will be evn faster....
,coolhandz69,2010-07-01T23:59Z,"Downloaded and installed just fine.  Played for a little while just to make sure that it works, but the game is really slow for my taste.  Kind of like playing chess with a couple minute pause between moves.  Bad example maybe.....some people may like it though.

Anyway, cheers Fireblade80 for the great up with a simple install."
,ceemosp,2010-08-07T01:39Z,"@DelphiUniverse Maybe gathering some info before complaining that the game doesn't work would make you look less stupid, wouldn't it? Unpatched (without the 3dx mod), the game is restricted to a resolution of 1024x768 - a resolution that was sufficient when the game game out. I am sure you are using a higher one and thus get the ""Cannot launch 3d engine"" error. Ask auntie google for a solution next time and spare us from your silly remarks. "
,ceemosp,2010-08-07T23:52Z,"A follow-up to my previous post. 

- Search on the web for the following mod: SH3_Mod_DirectX9Res10
- Extract the files into the MAIN SH3 folder
- Edit the d3d9.cfg file to the desired resolution
- Change the resoltion of your monitor accordingly.
- Start the game and have fun :)

= ATTENTION =
The game is programmed for a 4:3 screen ratio, so you have to select such a resolution here (e.g. 1280x1025 etc). 
16:9 or 16:10 ratios will NOT work!!!

,youritjuuh,2010-09-18T16:03Z,does it have to unpack every single time to play?
,lilrunindeer,2010-09-18T20:12Z,"Great torrent, works fine for me.

I was wondering though if the jsgme that is with it works, so that i can activate the various mods that aren't activated? Also...Can I add a sound mod with jsgme?

Or, is the jsgme disabled and it is what it is?

Thanx uploader, very nice torrent."
,lilrunindeer,2010-09-22T01:01Z,"After playing awhile...(plays great), game saves disappear after awhile. Seems to save for a few times, but then when you start the game the saves disappear. 

Anyone know of a fix? "
