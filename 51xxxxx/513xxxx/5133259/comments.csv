Did you tried with a fresh installation? Here on mine works fine, it has just downloaded the latest updates,  and no WAT."
,charnos55,2009-10-25T10:41Z,Seemed to work on my Prof N OEM version. Just updating now and will try MSE to test it. Will let you know if it passes.
,charnos55,2009-10-25T10:47Z,It passed the validation test on MSE install. Looks like a good job.

Reminds me of RemoveWGA..
just one click, one minute, and a reboot, and you're activated"
,syndre,2009-10-26T05:36Z,"in the time elapsed between the comment above and right this minute, the message about me not being genuine has started nagging me again. Did I miss a step? "
[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-26T08:19Z,"@syndre
There is a new version out, try with this one. Otherwise try with a clean install, maybe the problem is because the actual was already detected as not genuine. Here is still working fine."
,syndre,2009-10-27T01:38Z,"@NoExcuses, that does make sense. I did try to use this after windows was detected to not be genuine. I will re-arm windows and try it again.

FYI for those of you who shudder at the thought of doing a ""clean install"", you can use something like Windows 7 Toolkit to remove any and all activation cracks you have on your PC.

I believe the activator out there by ""SK"" lets you Re-Arm windows too

In my experience, you can ""re-arm"" with any old appz, but you will ALWAYS want to use the latest and greatest activator

I'll try this and post results later"
,fourtwentyz,2009-11-24T20:01Z,"does exactly what its supposed to do. downloaded file after new install of windows 7, followed instructions and i'm all good. not a single hint that my windows may not be geniune. thanks for the upload!"
