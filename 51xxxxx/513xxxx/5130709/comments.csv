,onemorning,2009-11-16T03:21Z,A reboot causes it to ask for a new key. Has anyone found a way around that yet?
,juggalo17butrfly,2009-11-19T08:17Z,Is this just zonealarm antivirus or is this zonealarm pro with antivirus?
,TwoFaced1680,2009-12-04T08:23Z,"The procedure I followed to ensure the license remains active is this:

Note: Tested on Windows XP Pro and Windows 7 Ultimate

1) Install ZoneAlarm
2) Re-Boot your PC
3) Generate license and input when prompted
4) Re-Boot and enter safe mode
5) Login using an administrator account
6) Ensure hidden files are shown
7)

For Windows XP browse to c:\windows\system32

For Vista/Win7 browse to C:\ProgramData\CheckPoint\ZoneAlarm\

8) Right click the file 'zllictbl.dat' and select properties
9) Click on the security tab
10) For each user and group listed set 'write' access to deny
11) Reboot

You should now be able to update ZoneAlarm and reboot your PC without having to worry about the license expiring.

FYI: If the security tab isn't available you can still set permissions using the 'cacls' command from the command prompt. If requested I'll post a tutorial. "

i didnt find security tab. please post the tutorial u mentioned"
,TwoFaced1680,2009-12-06T00:02Z,"Okay, the instructions for using the 'cacls' command are as follows:

Do steps 1-6 in my previous post. Then ...

7) Bring up a command window by clicking on 'Start' > Run and type cmd ...then press enter
(Vista users I think should type in cmd where it is says search, but I can't verify that right now)

8) At the prompt type:

cacls c:\windows\system32\zllictbl.dat 

(Note: if vista user remember the path is c:\ProgramData\CheckPoint\ZoneAlarm\zllictbl.dat and should be used instead)

9) A list of 4 or 5 accounts should be displayed and look something like:

     BUILTIN\Administrators:F
     BUILTIN\Users:R

10) For each account listed type the command

     cacls PATH_TO_FILE /E /G ACCOUNT:R

where ACCOUNT = one of the accounts listed in step 9 such as BUILTIN\Users

and PATH_TO_FILE = file path used in step 8



At this point all groups and accounts should have read only access which will prevent ZoneAlarm from changing 'zllictbl.dat'. 

The steps followed here accomplish the exact same thing as using the security tab, only without the GUI.

I hope that made sense. Any questions please ask. "
,TwoFaced1680,2009-12-06T00:22Z,"Sorry, in the above instructions the command to changer permissions should have been

cacls PATH_TO_FILE /E /P ACCOUNT:R

Note the /G is now /P"
