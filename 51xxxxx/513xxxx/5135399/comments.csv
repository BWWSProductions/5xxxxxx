,sistromo,2009-10-25T14:06Z,"Tamarind777, try and leave your anachronistic prejudices behind and learn a teeny bit of science, of which you clearly know nothing at all. Evolution by natural selection is a superb scientific theory, put to the test on a daily basis literally, and so far getting nothing but further experimental confirmation. Do attend some basic course on biology, and learn."
[T],dougietrotter,2009-10-25T19:16Z,"Oh my god it's Tamarind the Ignorant!

Haven't read any of your nonsense for a few weeks. Hopefully I won't have to read it for a few more!!

Ignorance at its best!!"

,NewGod,2009-10-27T00:23Z,There is no God! :)
,scoobydoo2u2,2009-11-01T10:23Z,Thank you very much. I've watched almost all these documentaries before but somehow I missed the first from 1987 'Nice Guys Finish First'. Should be interesting. Cheers.
,dubblue,2009-11-16T13:17Z,"excellent. well done, dougietrotter. ignore idiots like tamarind. they haven't the brains to learn anything new, apart from their inbred ignorance. everyone should download this."
,Supermariomad,2009-11-17T11:00Z,"Thanks for the upload. I will for as long as poss.
Plenty of seeds here well appreciated!"
,Gortie,2009-11-18T14:06Z,Great collection. =)
,phish1999,2009-11-24T19:03Z,"Thanks for the upload. Richard Dawkins is a great hero of mine; a well-educated man with the courage to stand-up to religion and the ""faith"" it calls a virtue. Just got his new book The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution - brilliant! Thx"
,eros_man_gr,2009-12-12T02:47Z,"What a great discovery! I had already seen ""the Root of all Evil"" and ""the Genius of Darwin"", both of which I recommend highly, by the way, and now I find more. The only thing that's better is reading his books, but I am sure glad somebody took the time to put all of these on one disc. Thanks, Doug!"
,cmonroy,2009-12-23T04:18Z,"Of course I want to thank you for maintaining this torrent. Dawkins is one of the few who really stand up for science against unreason. Good work, Dougietrotter!"

Poor trolls! don't insult them!"
,Rabbi_Marshak,2010-09-26T22:33Z,"אַ שײנעם דאַנק

A sheynem dank!

It is quite ironic that Tamarind is actually using ""religion"" as a derogatory term."
,SurferRN,2011-01-15T08:06Z,"Dawkins quote, ""We no longer live in small clans; Darwinism's pressure to ge good is no longer so strong... The point is that our evolutionary past built into us a lust for sex... and a lust to be good... to be friendly...to cooperate, to be sympathetic toward suffering.  But it also comes from something less easy to define.  I call it the shifting moral zeitgeist... a kind of SOMETHING in the air, some other force, something which we can't understand with sufficient sociological, psychological sophistication.  Whatever else it is, it isn't religion.""   BRILLIANCE!!!

Atheistic science at its best.  

""SOMETHING IN THE AIR.""   BRILLIANT!!!

Seems a pity that the scientist who had promised to provide the public with an ""understanding of science"" apparently lacked ""sufficient sociological and psychological sophistication"" to give an explanation.  

The UKs finest.  Brilliance!!!  

I smell ""something in the air"" and it smell like Dawkins is on RE-FEED STATUS, consuming his own shit.   "
,edm_ddd,2011-02-15T23:48Z,Richard is brilliant. We need more people like him on earth.
,Fredonia2k,2011-02-21T18:41Z,"@SurferRN I Googled the first part of the ""quote"" you posted. There was one hit, and it was a website criticizing Dawkins. Got any real proof for that ""quote?"""
,WeeJock78,2011-02-28T21:45Z," @SurferRN: What's your point, precisely? The quote looks like what I would perhaps reconstruct from memory: It reminds me of a passage from The God Delusion, but I don't have the book here to confirm. 

 The term zeitgeist, ""spirit of the times"", is a long-established philosophical term to refer to the intellectual, moral, philosophical and emotional discursive climate. And, yes, the Humanities have so far failed rather gloriously to come up with testable predictions about its twists and shifts. Anyway, those would tend to be self-influencing prophecies whenever they gained sufficient currency to form part of the intellectual canon. The variables involved in generating the zeitgeist are manifold and complex enough to assume that it's unlikely that we shall come up with a halfway decent list of them. What's wrong with using a popular figure of speech to refer to an elusive concept in a book for the general public? What's wrong with admitting to ignorance? And why, precisely, is it that stoning someone to death for breaking the Sabbath rules is nowadays considered not acceptable? Religion, if taken seriously, is in conflict with the zeitgeist -or heavily influenced by it. 

Oh, and please, please seed!

Cheers"
,Barosanescu,2011-04-20T07:02Z,"These episodes should be shown in every school in the world. 

Dawkins is one of the smartest men in the world. I thank him for having the courage to show the truth in an otherwise imbecile world. 

A world dominated by a 2000 years old lie.

I will seed this until my supercomputer will evolve into HAL :)  "

,kneebutt,2011-09-14T11:48Z,"@ Surfer - we get it.  Girls don't like you.  But you'll always have jesus, the poor fucker."
,Nagakaze,2012-04-25T11:24Z,"I really can't thank you enough for the amazing upload.

Don't mind people like Tamarind777 and SurferRN, they never really graduated from their Jesus Basements."
