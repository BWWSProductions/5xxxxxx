Where i live unfortunately there is no tv coverage of fis events.
This is the almost only chance to watch top quality skiers compete each other.
(what a shame I'm living in country where snows alot winter time...)
anyway I'm lookin forward to other fis events
I'm really glad such a great person like you are around here!"
