NOTE for the text beneath: if you boot from the dvd or usb-stick you will see ''tryck ned valfri tangent om du vill starta med cd- eller dvd-skivan''
that means''Press any key to start from CD or DVD-ROM'' and when you pushed any key the following message popsup ''Windows lÃ¤ser in filer...'' that means ''windows is loading files...''
it is Swedish it think it displays that language because it has been integrating as the last language DON'T BOTHER IT WON'T AFFECT YOUR INSTALLATION!


you need to burn this iso to a dvd or copy it to a usb-stick!
after you burned or copied it restart make sure your bios is booting from the dvd-station or your usb-stick!
then install windows by just following the clear steps when you have chosen the configuration of your network(so home-network, public-network or a work-network) it will apple the settings 
and then install automatically the loader that activates your copy of windows it says ''7Loader is being installed, the system will restart when done'' so when the computer says welcome(in your language)
it will shut-down and restart! now windows is activated and ready for business!

btw.you can select localpacks by right clicking your desktop and choose personalisize now there will all localpacks they appear with the names of the themes from the localpacks! 
if you have created more accounts then there will only be one localpack available for selection, to see all the localpacks run ''localpacks.reg'' that is located in the .iso say yes and click okay 
(run this ofcoure on the account that you want to show all the localpacks)



there is a change that microsoft thinks you are a pirate and displays an annoying message that you may be a victim of piracy don't bother and look around the internet.
They find their way, but we find ours!

			Torrent is downloaded from someone! 
			We don't do commercials for anyone. 

		The Company has it's location in the midst and the 
		North of Sweden. 
		We make movies and music from different sources. 
		Complete sets of DVD's with menus and multiple subtitles. 
		Just give us a proper MPEG and we finalize it.
		Music collections with mixed music from 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. 
		We also make complete discographics for certain artists and groups. 
		We are translating subtitles from English and Greek to Swedish. 

		We don't rip DVD's, we make them.
		Always original full uncompressed movies.
		If you like the movie you borrow, buy it. Also, if you 
		buy a movie without Swedish subtitles we can translate 
		for you and include them. If it's possible we also include 
		Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Greek subtitles. 

		If you want you can say "Thank You" it will 
		be highly praised. But the choise is yours.
