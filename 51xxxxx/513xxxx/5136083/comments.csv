,fr33kachu,2009-10-25T17:51Z,Thanks!!!!!
,ZenRhino,2009-10-25T18:21Z,"here's a better release of this event (no offense to the uploader - thanks for providing this release, but I think this version is better until a 720p version comes out) 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5136003/UFC_104"
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-25T18:26Z,ZenRhino: No offence taken but it´s hard to tell if that one is better quality with no info about it at all. And since that torrent is actually smaller in size than this I'm not to sure that it is better.  But everyone is free to download which one they want or both if they feel like it. 
,pissmyra8,2009-10-25T19:26Z,Thank you so mutch !!
,lobo345,2009-10-25T20:15Z,"Oh noes, RAR-files. Come on it's 2009."
,dadeohdan,2009-10-25T20:39Z,you need a password..whats up with that
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-25T21:32Z,dadeohdan: Stop lying you pathetic little wanker.
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-25T21:33Z,lobo345: Why don´t you contribute to this site then and upload one yourself? 
,MFINN23,2009-10-25T21:57Z,"you guys are fucking morons, what the hell does rar files have to do with it being 2009?  How about it's 2009 download winrar already and stop whining about things that don't matter."
,peterxxx,2009-10-25T22:47Z,"hows the quality on this one?

thanks for uploading bro

1-10?"
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-25T23:05Z,"peterxxx: The quality is ok. Around 5 i guess. it's good enough to watch on my 42"". "
,MFINN23,2009-10-26T00:18Z,"I don't know what zenrhino was watching but the one he suggested had artifacts all over the screen while this one has none.  I have watched the beginning of both, and this one is much better."
,Caspers_Ghost,2009-10-26T04:42Z,Thank U 4 Your Time & Effort   l_c_f_c Trusted
,arfett,2009-10-26T07:28Z,"l_c_f_c: why don't YOU contribute MORE by not uploading compressed files?

MFINN23: woooo woooooo woooooo moron alert"
,kefiafusu,2009-10-26T08:25Z,is this wide screen or full?
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-10-26T09:30Z,"arfett: Are you so stupid so you need me to unrar the files for you? And you don´t contribute at all so you can fuck off. 

kefiafusu: 16:9"
,MFINN23,2009-10-26T14:47Z,"@arfett lol i think everyone can see who has proven himself a moron, telling a person who has contributed enough to earn a pink skull that he needs to contribute more.... 

It amazes me how ungrateful and self centered some people can be.  People that shit all over the uploaders while contributing nothing should be banned from this site.  I'm betting you don't even seed the files you download.  You are the epitome of the word leech. "

yes and newsgroups are as popular now as ever (google it noob), file sharing doesn't just revolve around fucken bittorrent."
