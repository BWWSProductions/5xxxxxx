Play the Clown as We're Going Down:
"The Human Agenda, Vastly Detailed Plan,
Entails Dehumanization of Every Man,

Corpses Hanging on Wires, Copulating,
Freak Art by Freaks, Authorized, Degrading,
Young Murdered for Body Parts, Utterly Disgusting,
Arranged by a Priestly Class, Pious and Trusting,
The Wise do Watch and the Wise do Know,
Malevolence is Manifest, Not Far to Go"

Why Wait for Retiring?  Here's Population Downsizing:
"Terrorism, Swine Flu, Rationing Health Care and Stuff,
Elitist Masters Saying You're Not Dying Fast Enough,
Armfuls of Statistics, Graphs with Zig-Zag Courses,
Impressive (to a Moron), Say We're Chomping Up Resources,
You See, We Ordinary Folk with Decency, Few Needs and Compassion
Are Loaded Down with Junk Genes, Declared Out of Fashion,
The Rich have Made it to the Top with Cunning and with Slaughter
And Centuries of Inbreeding, Sometimes with Their own Daughter,
Once We've been Eliminated, the World will be Their Home,
Quiet Forests and by River, Elite's Offspring then can Roam"

Humanity -- Progress Means Less:
"The Architects of the Route of Progress
Wish to Reduce Population to 2 Million or Less,
Replacing the Slaves with Better Breeds,
Through Cloning and Splicing to Best Serve Their Needs,
From the Mass Propaganda We're Living Through,
All They Need is the Co-operation of You,
To Accept You're Inferior, Not Much Contribution
To Society, So Please Accept Final Solution,
Don't be a Spoilsport, Let Mankind Progress,
Same Old Eugenics is My Better Guess,
Over Methods Employed They Bicker and Wheedle,
Lord Bertrand Russell said 'We'll Use the Needle' "
