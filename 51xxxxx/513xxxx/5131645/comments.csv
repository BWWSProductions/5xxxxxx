,Spuddle1,2009-10-21T17:34Z,this is wave 4...you will need to use activate iso boot disk if on ixtreme 1.6 (until new ixtreme gets released)
,cncfrost,2009-10-21T19:19Z,Care to elaborate Spuddle?
,qumahlin,2009-10-21T21:42Z,"No need to elaborate.

Go to google and type in ""Xbox wave 4""

It's almost as if google is some unknown site to people on the piratebay comment sections."
,luxusmuxus,2009-10-22T15:52Z,it also works on ixtreme 1.51 if you have a hitachi drive
,cncfrost,2009-10-22T18:06Z,"Hey gummy, no harm to ask for info. You could have typed the info instead of a stupid response that would have gotten you a smack down in real life. Xbox is always trying to change things up, so we pirates should share knowledge to stay on top of it. We all would like to keep our games. Thanks for the info luxusmuxus. As for gum-under-my-shoe, fuck-off twat."

,dedlok,2010-01-30T12:26Z,"except that if you were to actually google ""xbox wave 4"" the very first result is a complete explanation of exactly what wave 4 is. The actual post detailing all this info is way too long for some comment.

but there you go since you're too lazy to even try before asking."
