The Mike Feder Show

For Mike Feder, freedom of speech is a religious principle. In more than 25 years on the air, he has tackled everything from politics to culture to religion
from a liberal-left point of view. His interviews, critiques, rants and sermons on the state of the world are personal, compelling and transforming.
