Plot:
Cameron Diaz takes a detour from comedy to play Sara, the domineering mother of Kate, a young girl with cancer. Saraâ€™s other daughter, 11-year-old Anna, was conceived just to serve as a donor for her sick sister. On the outskirts of the family are father Brian, who feels unable to stand up to his wifeâ€™s strength, and son Jesse, who craves attention in the face of Kateâ€™s illness. But the complicated situation gets more difficult when Anna hires a lawyer , so that she can control her own body and say â€œnoâ€ to giving a kidney to her sister. Cassavetes and Picoult both traffic in tears, so MY SISTERâ€™S KEEPER is a perfect match between director and source writer. Even the most jaded viewers will find it hard to keep their eyes dry in the face of this emotional family tragedy, so audiences are warned to have tissues parked next to their popcorn. This dramaâ€™s stellar cast also includes Thomas Dekker as Kateâ€™s cancer-stricken love and Joan Cusack as the judge who presides over Annaâ€™s case.
