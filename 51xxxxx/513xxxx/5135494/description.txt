      After establishing his credentials as a master of the ookie and kookie with his indelible theme song for the television goth-com Addams Family, composer Vic Mizzy lent his playfully macabre sensibility to the like-minded 1966 camp classic The Ghost and Mr. Chicken. The plotnebbish Don Knotts bumbles his way through a haunted house is a perfect vehicle for Mizzy's gifts, and over the course of this soundtrack he comically upends virtually every clichÃ© of horror movie music, gently mocking the genre's conventions while expanding its parameters with the addition of jazz and garage-rock elements. Fans of Raymond Scott and Carl Stalling will enjoy this as well; even the titles ("Gaseous Globe" and "Plucky Chicken," to name just two) are delightful.
