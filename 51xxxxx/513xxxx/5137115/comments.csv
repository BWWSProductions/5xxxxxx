,forsiktig,2009-12-05T13:36Z,"Hi :-)
Downloaded, extracted with zipitfree and burned on a DL DVD with Nero. It is not working on my -07 XC 90, any hints anyone ?"
,Nicolai123,2010-01-07T17:30Z,"forsiktig: could it be that your XC90 runs with earlier type of software, not this newer type. you might be using the one also used in volvos from 2001 with rti. "
,charles_w,2010-03-02T14:19Z,Zip file has erros and will not unpack also this will only work with 07 onwards versions ie intergrated Hdd RTI not DVD versions. But the core problem is the zip file is corrupt
,jeroenvv,2010-06-18T19:14Z,"Works on my V50. Indeed, unzipped and burned with Nero on a DL DVD. Only shame the maps are of 2008-01, so already a little outdated."
