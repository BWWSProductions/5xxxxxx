,gearofwar,2009-10-30T13:39Z,"Thank you thank you thank you!
These collections are by far the best ups I've seen on here.
I've voted up all four, please keep going!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-10-30T15:37Z,"Thank you very much everyone, your words are very kind.  I just hope you enjoy this music as much as I do.  I am gonna put up lots and lots more bands yet, some really great music so don't worry, it's just a question of time that it takes to make the mp3s.  I want them to be right for everybody, certainly at the best possible quality and also all the names be correct also so you don't have to do any work, you can burn them or whatever you want to do.  I am sorry that I have been a little slow with these but it's because I have hardly been at home much these last few weeks and it's finding the time to get more done.  Just keep checking back to my torrents every now and again and surely enough you will see the new ones as they come along.  I am so pleased I can share these bands with others, I just hope the pirate bay remains as it is because my work with these albums will be pointless if it become unaccessible."
,burningrabbit,2009-11-02T02:24Z,I am freaked-out. This collection of musical data seems pretty important for my journey into obscure music from decades ago...and not 'your'average kind. I applaud your effort and raise my pipe to salute you...
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-11-02T04:05Z,"Thank you, very kind...  Please be sure to grab the next part, part 5 when I get it ready, not quite as big as maybe this one but it will certainly contain some interesting sounds.  I'm just working on it now, always trying to find time to get these all done."
,grubtrot,2009-11-15T21:07Z,You are a very nice person to do all of this for us.
,dagseoul,2009-12-08T11:24Z,"have the first three and they are great.  as with those, will seed the next three to at least 3:1"
