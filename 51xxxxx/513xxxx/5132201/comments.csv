,Piroulika,2009-10-21T21:24Z,"Hi,
Your key doesnÂ´t work. I got error 2001D. I am on Vista.
Thanks "
,MrB8,2009-10-22T14:14Z,"@Piroulika: thats because it is an older key (v9.0) so you'll have to use the included crack to overlook that key issue.


I hope someone can post a key for the current version, or a crack for x64 systems

Thanks"
,Piroulika,2009-10-22T15:10Z,"Hi again !
I tried with the crack but Dopus blocked it. It recognised the crack...
If somebody has a key...
Cheers"
,zugzug,2009-10-22T19:36Z,Nice! Too bad this is only for 32bit and not 64bit. 
,Schout5,2009-10-23T09:15Z,Key does NOT work
,kraps,2009-10-23T12:32Z,After a few days directory opus' component checker kicks in and shuts down the whole thing. Any way around that?
,Bloodsplatter,2009-11-10T08:29Z,I want an x64 version!
,joecp1963,2009-11-10T23:24Z,"I am using Win7, and am having the same issues as  most of the other here. There aren't any install instructions for the other files, and after trying everything else- I backed up the installed files that corresponded to the ones that were in the folder in the torrent- with no luck from  that either. I am at a standstill. I am going to look elsewhere for crack/ PGP key or something that will work- and if I find something- I will come back and let everyone know. I don't believe the problem is OS dependent- from what I have seen- I think it was maybe a case of hastiness in getting this particular crack out there- and not enough R&D.  I SINCERELY appreciate everything that these folks do to make this available to those of us who would never be able to use this s/w without their expertise at 'reverse engineering' and all of the tools in their box- the most important being their brains. Thanks again all you 'miscreants'. :)"
,ivankgb,2009-11-14T22:42Z,"Really need version 9.5 for x64!
Any chance of that? Really really need it.
Thanks a mil!"
,billydv,2009-11-18T00:12Z,"As far as I know, there are no licenses in the wild for any version of Dir Opus higher than 9.1.3.0, the cert from this download should work on 9.1.3.0 and you can download that version from any number of places on the net. If you install on Win 7, install in compat mode for vista sp2 and be sure not to choose explorer replacement if it's available as an option. This cert was blacklisted starting with version 9.1.3.5"
,1Dellu,2009-12-25T03:19Z,"The crack is not working. 
Can you guys crack this  program please?"
,george_arceo,2010-01-05T03:16Z,"crack is working for me.
After installation, don't run the program yet.
copy first all the files inside the folder: Dopus 9.5 EXCEPT key.txt to the installation directory in program files.  Overwrite as necessary.

Run Dopus
then go to license manager and install new certificate.
Select the LOAD button and point to where the key.txt is.

I have just installed the key successfully now and will observe over the next few days if dopus will still work fine. Will update if dopus fails."
,george_arceo,2010-01-05T03:19Z,"P.S.

disable the option in dopus to automatically update

-just to be safe from being blocked...

it is in tools - preferences - miscellaneous - options
UNTICK: check for program updates..."
,george_arceo,2010-01-05T03:19Z,"P.S.

disable automatic updating just to be safe from being blocked..."
,george_arceo,2010-01-05T03:47Z,"sorry for the double post....

unfortunately after several minutes, dopus detects that there is an inconsistency with its program files because of overwriting from the cracked files.

dopus performs integrity check every now and then and closes dopus.  You can still open dopus after this but it keeps on checking every now and then...

its nagging you all from time to time..."
,george_arceo,2010-01-06T15:34Z,"tried to install again, because i got some error while over writing files.

now it is working fine for two days now, compared to the first attempt where about every 10min i get a nag of corrupted installation files

i guess i did not overwrite the .dll file before because i opened opus immediately before overwriting with the cracked files.

so after installation, dont run opus yet, overwrite cracked files immediately,
after opening, you can now install the license that came with the torrent"
,Bouarf,2010-01-06T19:18Z,"I've followed the same process than george arceo (thanks to him), for now it's works. I didn't reboot my computer, i mean the install is very fresh, so i'll com back later to tell if it's still ok or not.
I'm running on Win 7 64 bits.
By the way, the only free windows explorer i've found was Ultraexplorer. But it's a little buggy.
Happy new year to every body!"
,Bouarf,2010-01-07T09:59Z,"Hello again,
Unfortunately, after i turned off my PC for the night, this morning when i started, opus didn't work anymore... :( lol so i apologize i should have comment after a reboot, sorry for that.
But what is interesting in my case, is that i've installed an odl version opus 9.1.3.0 on my netbook on win7 32bits, then installed the key, and yesterday it worked... and today also it works!
So in my opinion the only way to have opus working is to install an old version (don't take 9.1.3.5 version and after) and install the key.
By to all thanks for all comments "
,joukot,2010-02-17T19:46Z,"I've had this installed for almost 2 weeks. I just got the pop-up about ""Dopus failed an integrity check, and must close"".

I get this pop-up also, but i got mine work.

1. Install 9.5
2. before copy cracked .exe file to install folder, rename original dopus.exe file ex. dopus.org
3. Continue instructions to setup key-file
4. When you are finished then rename cracked dopus.exe to dopus.crc and dopus.org back to dopus.exe

It looks like that cracked dopus.exe file needed only time to install key-file then you could replace that file to original dopus.exe

Mine works now just fine."
,george_arceo,2010-03-03T22:31Z,"I am still using this version, and used the same steps i provided above.

i also had a popup of the pirate cat chasing the opus icon.  good thing, i had a ghost image and reverted back.  but this time, i had set my eset smart security's firewall to interactive so that i can see all the programs that are attempting to access the internet and then deny all attempts made by opus.
I also noticed that not only opus is trying to access internet.  There was a popup saying: 
Microsoft Malware Protection Command Line Utility is trying to reach a remote computer.  When i first allowed it, after a few minutes, the pirate cat appeared again.  So i reverted back again, then blocked access to it this time.  There were also 2 or 3 other programs not named opus that were trying to access the internet as i opened opus.  I just blocked them all and until now my opus is still working.

I am using eset smart security v3.0.669.0 to deny access to opus.  I know there are newer version now, but i think they require you to change passwords every now and then, but this one doesn't (precracked)  :-)"
,1Dellu,2010-03-04T23:20Z,"@george_arceo: Do you remember the  other applications you blocked?
I get Microsoft Malware protection command utility. I blocked it, but, still i am getting that nagging stuff"
,george_arceo,2010-03-19T22:45Z,"i was trying to manually log all connection attempts made by opus 2 weeks ago.  so far these are the logs i got:
Outbound
Name:		Windows SQM Consolidator
Remote:		65.55.7.141
Remote Port:	443 https

Outbound
Name:		Host Process for Windows Tasks
Publisher:	Microsoft Windows
Remote: 	65.55.53.190
Remote Port: 	80 http

i think there was another process that tried to connect, i just did not have a record of it before.  I had set my eset firewall to Interactive mode so i can see clearly what tries to connect to the internet. "
,threezee,2010-03-23T19:08Z,"Working perfectly...

I did exactly as George Arceo said in his very helpful comments.

1. Install (DO NOT RUN PROGRAM)
2. Copy all files EXCEPT key.txt to installation directory
3. Run program
4. Disable automatic updates (and block internet access with firewall)
5. Apply license from key.txt
6. Done and done!

Thanks George Arceo, I always greatly appreciate when people take the time to post helpful comments and explain what works and what doesn't. Cheers!"
,torone,2010-04-07T05:35Z,"Working!
Thanks to UP and seeders. Installation guide is helpful "
,astitch,2010-05-29T02:10Z,"Just want to confirm that if you have been blacklisted or have run the program before cracking it  you do need to clean the batch and reg files as given above. (thank you everyone who helped).  But the message from Threezee has an error.
When you install the key it resets the auto update option!!! 
Install it, crack it, run it, use the key, then go to preferences-misc-options and uncheck the auto update.  All this has to be done before reconnecting to the internet.  CHECK THE AUTO UPDATE LAST!"
,george_arceo,2010-06-29T03:44Z,"9.5.2 is now available:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5446546/Directory_opus_9.5.2_x86__amp__x64

follow the instructions and you will not get the pirate cat problem anymore.

i was sometimes experiencing that problem in this 9.5 version.  I am now using the 9.5.2 version for months now and not having the same problem anymore."
