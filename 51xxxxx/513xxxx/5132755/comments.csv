If it's wave 3 lets get this thing popping!!!!"
,ServerModerator,2009-10-23T05:40Z,What! This game released! Tell me this is Legit!
,KookieMonsta,2009-10-23T05:41Z,Legit Wave 4
,ShineEyes,2009-10-23T05:41Z,This is wave 4.  Google how to get a wave 4 game working with iXtreme 1.6 or wait for the next version of iXtreme.
,ServerModerator,2009-10-23T05:43Z,"Crap, I need to Update...."
,Ci2USH,2009-10-23T19:57Z,"Well I uploaded over 7gb on this torrent call it a gift, as I refuse to risk getting ban on XBL over a wave 4 game, One Shot Boot is far from being XBL SAFE so I will pass on this till new iXtreme comes out.

Thanks for the upload though...But in the future please note what wave it is. "
,ShineEyes,2009-10-24T06:21Z,"Or you could google what wave it is.  It's fairly common knowledge among the 360 pirating community that most new games are wave 4.  Provided it's been uploaded by someone with the skull and crossbones next to their name, you can pretty much ensure it's safe.  Just burn the activation iso and you're fine to play Wave 4."
