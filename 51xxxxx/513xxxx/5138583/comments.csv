,ShineEyes,2009-10-28T06:01Z,Any word on this being Wave 4 or not?
,ShineEyes,2009-10-28T06:21Z,Good point.  That would be pretty excellent.
,Bonez86,2009-10-28T08:51Z,"@Dark_Knight1
I thought this was supposed to include ""ballad of gay tony"" and The Lost and Damned. correct me if i am wrong."
,ShineEyes,2009-10-28T08:53Z,"If this IS Episodes from Liberty City, then yeah, it should include both."
,Bonez86,2009-10-28T09:02Z,"I hope so, ill be pissed if i waste a DL Disk lol

,Cremegg,2009-10-28T09:15Z,Is this the same as the MARVEL release or is it someone trying to take credit for the MARVEL release??? It's just the rars don't have the name that matched against abgx
,tisemann,2009-10-28T13:06Z,"It's WAVE 4.

Dark_Knight1 should check his facts better."
,ScottyB,2009-10-28T13:28Z,"Please tell me it IS definately region free. 

I got excited when Dark_Knight said it was 'wave3' and started downloading, but if it's only NTSC i'll stop."

,Douche88,2009-10-31T15:23Z,"@Amsterdom 

Does the ppf-o-matic actually work for wave4 games?  I remember it working for wav3 but if it works with wave4 also thats amazing (since i dont have xbox live).
