,geburha,2009-10-30T19:53Z,"""Source: 1080p Blu-ray VC-1 TrueHD""

,werdyloks,2009-11-02T03:15Z,so thanks for this im dowloading now hopefully it work good but why not 1080p if you got from true hd disk? anyways better than standard def so thanks.
,caliwillbemine,2009-11-03T12:45Z,"ok i watched it, the quality is great! true HD 720p and great song, not to mention absolutely amazing movie!! will buy it. it is sad that harry potter is now over..

,caliwillbemine,2009-11-03T12:45Z,sound**
,rc71,2009-11-04T07:54Z,"Thanks for the upload.

Thanks for being 720p.

I think I'll go on the 1080p torrents and complain it's not 720p, like those in this thread.

As far as I know, this is NOT the last one.  The next one is.  Something about a hollow or something."
,MsMew,2009-11-09T02:50Z,Can this be converted and reduced to DVD5?
,rlawat,2009-11-21T05:34Z,thanks cgaurav007 !!!!!!!!1
,shizilao,2009-11-21T16:47Z,"I will burn this into two DVD-5s with MKVtoolnix, though to determine the appropriate split position is a little bit tricky."
,greenteagod,2009-12-12T08:32Z,Eat a dick geburha. Stop to think that 1080 was the damned source like it says not the final encode. Twat
,CK1010100,2009-12-15T17:09Z,ip tracked on this one. lost internet for a day cause wb contacted my isp. twirls finger. 
,yomatoshison,2009-12-15T22:36Z,i downloaded this 3 days ago and my isp send me an email for copyright infringement wtf.....
,yomatoshison,2009-12-15T22:37Z,just a warning to those who download this it is being tracked and reported to your isp.....
,live2hit01,2009-12-17T03:05Z,"its true, dont download."
,StayPhrosty,2009-12-19T19:21Z,"lol live2hit01, yomatoshison, CK1010100, i know you're the same guy/bot, how much did they pay you to spam BS all over TPB? 
fyi-not true, there's NO tracer on this torrent and you will NEVER get disconnected by your isp for downloading ANYTHING, it's just bad business."
,condorwanb,2009-12-20T06:12Z,"I woke up on the 19th and my IP was banned. They received a notice from WB about d/l'ing this. I was using bitlord and have changed since the incident, that may have been the issue or there is something not right with this torrent. "
,irving182,2009-12-24T07:42Z,I just got a notice of Copyright Infringement from Verizon :-/
,smokerdalejash,2010-01-08T17:09Z,thanks audio seems to go out of sync with lips but this could be something to do with this being american ntsc and  im using a pal tv
,Crank392,2010-01-13T17:02Z,Anyone know whether it works on PS3?
,apat0409,2010-01-14T22:47Z,I'm having issues with the audio on my divx player...  It's sounds like white noise.  Anyone else having issues or have a better free program to watch it on besides divx?
,live2hit01,2010-01-15T03:00Z,"StayPhrosty youre an idiot.  would you like me to post the fucking email i got from verizon saying that i have illegally downloaded this?  maybe its just verizon thats tracking this... but i def got the fucking email, i would not recommend dl this."
,Zhylo,2010-01-19T23:12Z,"live2hit01, Not everyone lives in communist America, you know."
,kushsmokinog,2010-01-22T22:40Z,"i dont understand why this download is taking 7 weeks!! i have a 5mb/s internet download speed and theres 10 seeds, why is this?"
,ProGunNL,2010-01-25T20:40Z,Is it real or fake?! can i download is without problems?
[T],jonnoel1,2010-02-12T15:13Z,i think i'll pass with all the isp warnings on this one....more than 3 makes me not want it that much....lol
,crazedewok,2010-03-11T19:42Z,"I've hesitated to download this.  I actually received a DMCA Takedown notice for downloading a harry potter movie before.   But I did it anyway.  Ive waited 2 weeks, no email from ISP yet.  Personally, if I actually DID receive the email I Would totally post it here!  Those takedown notices are posted EVERYWHERE online, they are all the same.  I also have a feeling those guys posting that were fake."
,joediggety,2010-04-10T19:24Z,You people need to install utorrent with IPFILTER. you wont get any more emails from your isp.
,Equinox117,2010-04-30T11:32Z,"nice torrent, seeded well, took about 15 mins to d/l, thanks again"
,ml01172,2010-05-07T10:36Z,"I really don't know if it's up to peers or my ISP, but the download goes RREALL SLOW (right now even 0,2 kB/s). Have it in mind."
,AJSaK07,2010-11-21T04:36Z,@grewde Why are you saying is not True HD? are you sure? coz I don't want to spend a lot of weeks downloading this shit if is not True HD.
,Stikre,2010-12-14T21:04Z,IN BEFORE THE LOCK
,kslxmwld,2011-07-04T23:16Z,"To all those saying it's not 720p HD, it is. Look at the aspect ratio of this movie, the width remains the same but the height has a bunch of black bars on top and bottom. Those bars are not needed, they can be put with with the software, so you save bandwidth downloading the black bars."
