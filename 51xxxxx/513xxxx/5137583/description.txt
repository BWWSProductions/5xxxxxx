The invention of cinemaâ€”and its growth into a sophisticated art formâ€”are vividly brought to life in this massive collection of films from the early years of the influential Gaumont Film Company. Each disc is devoted to one of Gaumontâ€™s artistic directors, who oversaw all film production at the studio, and profoundly influenced not only the identity of the studio but also the evolution of the cinema itself. 



DVD 1 Alice Guy 

Few individual artists have exerted as profound an influence upon the evolution of cinema as Alice Guy (later known as Guy-BlachÃ©). With this collection of more than 60 films, culled from the worldâ€™s leading archives and carefully mastered, Guy may no longer be seen as a â€œwoman filmmaker.â€ These films, produced by Guy for Gaumont before she moved to the US, reveal her to be an unqualified pioneer whose work stands alongside that of the LumiÃ¨re Brothers, Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, and Edwin S. Porter, in cinemaâ€™s rapid growth from an optical illusion to a storytelling medium to an art form. Among the highlights are a 19th-century serpentine dance, early â€œtrickâ€ films, experiments with hand-coloring and synchronized sound, comedies, social commentaries, and (as the collectionâ€™s centerpiece) a 33-minute religious epic: The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ (1906).
