,MistaWigga,2009-12-16T04:59Z,"A'ight I'll keep my eyes peeled, Another one if you happen to run across Ice T's OG Original Gangsta, Power, The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say, VI - Return of the Reel, and  The Seventh Deadly Sin.

Pretty much his discography minus 2 albums, I can't find them anywhere, and When I do there's no seeds.

Also There's talk of a New Dre Album Coming out... Just Saying.

BlueNuke You da man!"
,cheveto_chaz,2010-01-02T04:01Z,"ok i got alot to say.... 

1. this ain;t the actual album....where is big money, krazy, and better days?

2. most of these songs sound like mixtape material...plus if the game released an album like this i'd be pissed, the only actual good song was ""band along""

3. plus game is featuring a bunch of gay artists on his album...like lady gaga, akon, gucci mane, justin timberlake... guess it's cause pharrel produced this one....

4. i feel bad for all those people who are downloading this torrent, believeing it's the actual album.... if you are gonna release something on piratebay...atleast label it mixtape...and not get everyone all hyped up on a fake album with the name of a real album....

i litterally thought the album leaked...but nope....thanks for the tracks anyways"
