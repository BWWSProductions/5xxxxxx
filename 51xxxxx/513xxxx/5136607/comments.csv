This one is the latest version, I suppose they have fixed something in it. Plus, even if cracked, the previous version shows as with license expired, this one not (yet)."

I'll be very careful when using this software, since every time I used it (v2.2) in the past, some software failed to work afterwards. So I started using CCleaner, which can do much less and appears much safer."
