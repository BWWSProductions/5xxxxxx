Would not this be  automatically removed by the system activation? Could you explain as this activation happens? Will WU work without problems?

Just some questions..."
,alienfox,2009-10-25T16:29Z,If you have a watermark still remaining on the desktop after activating windows 7 use the Plus Patch to remove it. Windows will still be activated afterwards.
,kengill,2009-10-25T18:30Z,"Windows 7 does not have a watermark, only the trial versions had it. I suspect the serials are for the early BETA versions."
,alienfox,2009-10-26T07:37Z,if that does happen salmanbar1 i recommend using a loader as well just as a precaution as the only things i have found worked are these serials and a loader

,wazz62,2009-10-29T19:37Z,I have already used a watermark removal tool to remove the watermark on my elaluation copy due to expire on 02/03/10. What will the key do?
,wazz62,2009-10-29T19:40Z,Followup to my last message. Will these keys keep my elaluation copy activated beyond 02/03/10?
