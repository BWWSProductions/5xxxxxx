[T],keka_umans,2009-10-22T12:56Z,S07E14 Aired today...So Most likely fake
,zxcvzxcvzxcv,2009-10-22T14:38Z,"The episode with windows open vs. closed in a hurricane and liquid nitrogen on a christmas tree. Not sure about the episode number, but otherwise legit."
,jorma132,2009-10-22T14:54Z,Fake in my ass. Keka noone is forcing you to download.
,pinecone,2009-10-22T19:40Z,"Translated description: Hurricane and windows. Windows open or shut when hurricane strikes? Will a head frozen with liquid nitrogen shatter into pieces? Will a christmas tree explode using liquid nitrogen?

(yes, it's redundant like that. ""shatter into pieces"", indeed.)"
,TripleAAABattery,2009-10-23T07:32Z,thanks. quality is great
,TripleAAABattery,2009-10-23T07:33Z,"btw to those thinking this is fake, its real. other countries are getting episodes of mythbusters faster than US. this is real."
,shadowcat007,2009-10-24T11:37Z,It's real. It's fun to watch how they try to smash a frozen pigs head. Only too bad about those subtitles. Great quality.
,macavity81,2009-10-25T16:47Z,"Yeah it's legit, they test new stuff. The finnish subs detract a little, but it's not major. Overall a good episode."
,PingPang,2009-10-26T01:51Z,IT'S REAL
,palakust,2009-10-26T14:32Z,this is very real. thx to uploader

,byseachairten,2009-10-29T09:40Z,"Jorma132 has ONLY upploaded fakes, he should be shot or gangraped for this.. Stupid finnish people... "
,kas1,2009-10-30T00:30Z,"This is NOT... repeat NOT a fake... this is the real Mythbusters s07e16...
Mythbusters is aired earlier on Discovery in Canada and even earlier in the UK and certain other European countries than in the United States.
This was aired Oct 5th in the UK before episode 15 was aired (on the 12th)."
,snaketus,2009-10-31T21:48Z,byseachairten and keka_umans fake in my ass you morons. Very real and thanks for the uploader. Finnish subs are great but little confusing because I used to watch this show without them many years.
