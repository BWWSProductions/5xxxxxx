,MisterPoe,2009-10-25T22:00Z,This ending is a lot cooler than the screener version. I was a bit disappointed in the other one.
,hobowithashotgun,2009-10-26T01:25Z,Er i dont see how this is an alternate this is exactly what i saw in theaters...
,Shynobi,2009-10-26T02:32Z,"read the description hobo, he says this is the theatrical version, the screener version out on here has the different ending."
,Shynobi,2009-10-26T02:33Z,"the theatrical version also has some more parts throughout the movie, some demon activity during the day etc..."

,Destructo_Dom,2009-10-26T19:09Z,"yeah the screener is ""limited""...meaning , the whole movie is missing little odds and ends...its more than just a different ending , some scenes are shorter in it..."

,vrul,2009-11-15T22:16Z,"This ending is thousand times better then the other ending, i though this movie sucked until now when i've seen it with this ending.. shit crazy, i got chills all over my body"
,randwich,2009-11-22T22:21Z,"@Destructo_Dom: Don't just make shit up when you don't know what you're talking about, LIMITED means that it's a limited theatrical release, rather than a wide release, it has nothing to do with it missing ""odds and ends."""

,FeRoCITy05,2010-01-01T13:18Z,Good stuff. The right Theatrical version I saw in the theater. Wanna show my friend the right one. But the only downside of this torrent is the video quality....
,DSDO,2010-01-02T23:12Z,"Check this one : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5219506/Paranormal_Activity_-_Last_Five_Minutes_taken_from_DVD_Rip_-_The

It's the same ending than this one, but in a much better quality.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD (though if you're looking at 'endings' torrents, you probably already saw one of the versions of the movie) :
I'm still looking for the original ending (or alternate, whatever it's called) meaning the one involving the police."
,billy95,2010-06-02T11:18Z,this is the endings with the cops or the other one?
