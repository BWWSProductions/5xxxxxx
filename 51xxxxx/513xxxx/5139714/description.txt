Largely taken from author Taylor's online DVD FAQ [Frequently Asked Questions]...this is a good reference for questions about DVD technology. It covers the history of DVD development, some minor troubleshooting, and DVD recording. Many questions may be answered in the online site at [http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html.] Libraries building extensive video technology collections should consider this along with Taylor's DVD Demystified.
