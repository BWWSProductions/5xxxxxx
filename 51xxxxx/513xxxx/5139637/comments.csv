,EnemyDrone,2009-10-29T21:11Z,No different than emo rockers singing about how sad they are. No different than rock n roll metal screaming where you cant understand them..
,DeNiaL365,2009-10-29T23:01Z,"Or country music sining about their pick up trucks...... Or pop music singing about nothing....

Most good rap tells a story and is probably the most lyrical music out there. "

,HamsterXX,2009-11-05T00:50Z,"Thanks for the Up. Great quality.

Rap is stating to suck nowadays. 

There is some good shit on this though, just because i wiped my ass with it. 

50 is garbage."
,rU3uw4se,2009-11-13T04:30Z,Good quality. But 50 cent has seriously lost it. 50 cent straight up garbage now a days. Glad I didn't buy this crap.

Lol, I'm sorry, but this is the biggest shit I've ever read. Rock tells you a story, but not rap."
