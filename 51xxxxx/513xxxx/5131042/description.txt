The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009) - DvDrip DivX7 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1111422/

Plot: New York City subway dispatcher Walter Garber's ordinary day is thrown into chaos by an audacious crime: the hijacking of a subway train. Ryder, a criminal mastermind, leads a highly-armed gang of four, threatening to execute the train's passengers unless a large ransom is paid within one hour. As the tension mounts beneath his feet, Garber employs his vast knowledge of the subway system in a battle to outwit Ryder and save the hostages. But there's one riddle Garber can't solve: even if the thieves get the money, how can they possibly escape? 

Denzel Washington, John Travolta, John Turturro, Frank Wood
