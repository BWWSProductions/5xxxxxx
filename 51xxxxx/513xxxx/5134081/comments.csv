,tcalkin75,2010-12-09T15:29Z,I also havw a white box in the middle of my play screen and I have windows 7! How do I get rid of it?
,Jerkoroids,2011-04-05T18:00Z,"to get rid of the white boxes, uninstall the game and also uninstall ''Quicktime'' from add remove a program and then reinstall the game and agree to install quicktime and directx"
,nikolaga,2011-05-11T02:31Z,"1. Mount File CS1DVD.000 with Daemon Tools (Choose ""All Files"" to appear). You can see how yo do that on the video...

2. Go to Control Panel - Regional and language Options, then to Advanced section and change whatever you got there to French (Canada). You may need to restart your computer for it to work (if windows asks you). Then install the game. After it finishes, change that back to whatever it was before you changed it. The problem is that in Francais, the letter isn't just, but the french, which is... That's why it doesn't work!!! 
Have fun.

3. Play"
