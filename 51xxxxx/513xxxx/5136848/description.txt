Game Notes
~~~~~~~~~~
Lock, Load, Face the Madness Get ready for the mind-blowing insanity, as
one of four trigger-happy mercenaries, taking out everything that stands in
your way. With its addictive action, frantic first person shooter combat,
massive arsenal of weaponry, RPG elements and four-player co-op, Borderlands
is the breakthrough experience that challenges all the conventions of modern
shooters. Borderlands places you in the role of a mercenary on the lawless
and desolate planet of Pandora, hell bent on finding a legendary stockpile
of powerful alien technology known as The Vault.


Proper Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The usual suspects suprised us again. They not only released a self made iso,
which is totaly out of place for this game and wasts 1GB more space, but
this time they also rushed their (realy ugly looking) crack and removed the
delay import directory entry, which some of you allready noticed, loads the
PhysX subsystem. We are realy frightened what happend with our honored friends
in Reloaded ... .. and by the way the game exe isnt the same as your
try media one. Next time better proof your words...
