The Nature of Things 
Mini Monsters of Amazonia
Aired: Oct 18, 2009

A look at the astonishing and complex relationships of the "mini monsters", insects of the Membracidae family - treehoppers that live amid one of the richest ecosystems on the planet, one so mysterious most people don't even know that it exists.

The astonishing biodiversity of our planet is the result of perpetual evolution - in which species have had to adapt themselves to often hostile environments. The complex relationships between species and their environments, the pressure of natural selection and spontaneous mutations, between chance and necessity, have fashioned the living world in a multitude of forms, beyond our imaginations. And although scientists and biologists have already made great strides towards illuminating the extent and variety of the web of life, our knowledge of certain species is still very limited, in particular those that are isolated or difficult to access.
