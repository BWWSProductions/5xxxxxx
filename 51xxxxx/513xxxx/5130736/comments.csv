[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-21T09:34Z,"Well, I've tried it on my W7 Ultimate, and after this it's not showing anymore the WAT in the System menu, but my W7 was already activated with another crack. Considering that the infected file is having some hundred uploaders, and that Hagar is a good cracker, I suppose that it works, until M$ finds the way to stop it..."
,phantom.knight,2009-10-21T13:48Z,"It seems to be working, it no longer says 30 days to activate, the activation and serial info is gone. Mine wasn't activated before. Lets see if the updates work after this?"
,TheBizzBoy,2009-10-21T17:25Z,ive ran the program on my x86 pc and works fine...removed all as listed...still curious how long this will work
,gjstyl,2009-10-22T14:20Z,"I attempted to use this activator when my software stated two days until activation required.  Unfortunately, it did not seem to work.  Perhaps I need to run this right after a clean install?  I hope to hear from others if this has been working for them or if they had to get creative in order to make it work..."
,JPeterson,2009-10-22T19:11Z,"""the files that remain resident and connect to internet"". What files?"
[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-22T20:08Z,"@JPeterson
Not this one, this has been cleaned off. The other file that you can find around in internet, of about 1.30 MB of size, when runned it creates some extra files that try to connect to internet. If you use the other, you can find a foreign CMD.EXE in %AppData%\Microsoft, and other System320.exe and System3215.exe in %WinDir%. Only the last is the good one."
,jokulie,2009-10-23T14:01Z,Worked. Thanks!
,dorenhagen,2009-10-24T04:35Z,"I purchased a copy of Home Premium which I loaded onto my laptop and activated with this nifty little program.  No problem whatsoever.  I'll let it go for a couple of weeks and if it continues to work, I'll load my legitimate copy onto my desktop.

,Barbarian1471,2009-10-25T14:16Z,"Clean.

Seems to be working now, although nearly corrupt my boot sector at one stage - not sure what happened there. Performed on new retail installation. Gave errors:

OS/2 !! SYS01475
OS/2 !! SYS02027 

But upon re-booting from CD the issues resolved. 

Many thanks all. "
,Barbarian1471,2009-10-25T14:19Z,"Ah no, boot sector corrupt again. :-( 

Maybe will try the newer version."
,Barbarian1471,2009-10-25T15:01Z,"Ignore me, wasn't using Ultimate version. "
,Barbarian1471,2009-10-25T15:40Z,Er... and just realised I'd disabled HDD booting for an unrelated problem! o_0
,ShadowMastr,2009-10-25T20:02Z,"eset flagged this, hopefully a false positive???"
,aiseen,2009-11-06T12:15Z,Working thanks ..
,chestbuster,2009-11-16T10:02Z,"One word: OMFG!

Finally! One that works! I had to re-install Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit four times other cracks screwed up my boot sector!

Congratulations and a sincere thanks to the crackers, hackers and uploaders! You guys are the best! 

I'll seed this for as long as I can."
,toddtol3,2009-11-28T15:07Z,This works great!!!!!!!! Thanks for the WAT!!!
,fordgoose15,2009-12-02T01:13Z,"Thanks!  I ran this right after my Ultimate x64 install and it seems to have worked.  Updating with no problems.  But since I never saw a ""xx days to activate"" message I guess I can't be 100% sure quite yet.  If somebody can tell me where they see that message, I will happily confirm later."
,lathil,2009-12-14T07:40Z,Works great! Thanks!
,Vindt,2010-02-23T07:11Z,"This worked very well. Thank you NoExcuses for uploading it. Got rid of the annoying ""Windows is not Genuine"" message I kept getting after I did something stupid... x_x"
,colbrodok,2010-04-21T16:38Z,pls SEEEEEEEEEEED !
,Ruty2shoes,2010-10-15T20:33Z,I love you man! This worked like a charm! Thanks!
