Quantum Physics & Consciousness

Date: 10-21-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Amit Goswami, Joshua P. Warren

Quantum physicist Dr. Amit Goswami talked about the "science within consciousness," and how the paradigm is shifting from a materialistic world view into one that incorporates spirituality and the mystic traditions. He believes the existence of God is being revealed in the signature of quantum physics. "Quantum physics says every object is a possibility, so there has to be a non-material entity that chooses the actual event from the process of these possibilities," he explained. In quantum physics, there is also the concept of non-locality, signal-less communication outside of space & time, which is being mediated by consciousness. This relates to religious notions of God, he said.

The materialist viewpoint tends to be pessimistic, and doesn't find value or meaning in the world, Goswami commented. "As you become a connoisseur of consciousness, you begin to see that we are more than just our material bodies. We have a vital body that we feel, and it is...the coupling of this vital energy with the physical organ-- that is what gives us vitality." When this coupling is weakened, that's when we fall sick, he continued. 
He foresees humankind evolving over the next centuries, integrating emotions and thought in a more balanced way. People will learn how to harness the energies of love, and access more of the intuitive mind, he said.

Encounter with Snakes

Last hour guest, paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren shared an account of two large snakes that appeared in his home at the same time. While sleeping, he heard an internal voice warn him that a snake was in the room. The snakes' arrival took place after Joshua tangled with a wizard who was a practitioner of black magic.
