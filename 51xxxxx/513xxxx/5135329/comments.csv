Make sure there'e a line space between each
Also whenever having any seed problem you can always search for more seeds by copying the hash of the torrent
select torrent > General tap > scroll down until you find Hash
there's a code-like characters lined up.. right click and copy, then go to google and paste it there and open the torrents you find to add trackers"
