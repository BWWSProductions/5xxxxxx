i saw your comment on brick's post. and yes that torrent is fuecked. i don't know exactly what went wrong, but i think it had to do with the fact that i uploaded it to HDME.eu first then added the tracker. anyways i know you've been waiting for this one. oh, btw i will re upload batman returns for those that want it."
