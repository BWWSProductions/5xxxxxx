Friday

New Line Cinema | 1995 | 97 mins | Rated R | Sep 08, 2009

Just another day. But what a day. A day that shows a lighter side to life in the â€™hood. That brought Ice Cube (Barbershop) and Chris Tucker (Rush Hour) to a wider audience. And thatâ€™s now even more uproarious in an Extended Directorâ€™s Cut never before available. Itâ€™s Friday, and Craig (Cube) and Smokey (Tucker) must come up with $200 they owe a local bully or there wonâ€™t be a Saturday. Co-writer Cube, director F. Gary Gray and other innovative movie talents lace the plot with shrewdly hilarious looks at family (including John Witherspoon), a preacher (Bernie Mac), a girl-next-door (Nia Long) and all manner of the good â€™Nâ€™ bad of life in South Central. This is keepinâ€™-it-real comedy for every day of the week.

Genres: Comedy / Drama
