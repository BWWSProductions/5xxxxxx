BIG TNX TO MURLOK."
,Shad0w325,2009-11-29T23:23Z,"Works fine with Windows 7 64 bit.

Make sure you patch the files before going through the activation process.

1. Open the keygen and select Sony Vegas Pro 9.0 (32 and 64 bit)

2. Click Patch... and find your install directory. (Default is C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas 9.0

3. After the patch finishes, open Vegas 9.0 and it will ask you for the serial. Click Generate on the keygen a few times and copy and paste the serial. DO NOT CLOSE THE KEYGEN OR HIT GENERATE, YOU WILL NEED THE ACTIVATION CODE THAT MATCHES YOUR SERIAL.

4. Enter bullshit info and accept the terms.

5. It will say it cannot activate, hit retry a few times and then hit cancel.

6. It will ask for the activation code. Copy and paste it from the keygen and hit OK.

Vegas Pro 9.0 will load and be fully activated.

Congrats and enjoy! :)"

Working no problems!

I noticed alot of people had trouble installing this with Windows 7. Heres how I did it.

1. Install Sony Vegas Pro 9 fresh (that means uninstall, and delete C://Program Files/Sony)

2. Reinstall, and DO NOT START Vegas

3. If you mounted go to your virtual Drive through my computer and go to the KEYGEN_D.7 folder

4. Open KEYGEN.EXE as administrator (right click, Run as Administrator)

5. Select the ""Vegas Pro 9.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series"" tab

5. Click generate a few times to get some fresh fresh keys, then hit the patch button, then browse for C://Program Files/Sony/ 

6. Patch it and wait untill everything has been patched, and do not close KEYGEN.EXE or generate a new key. JUST LEAVE IT RUNNING.

7. Start Sony Vegas, when it asks you for a serial number just copy the one from the keygen.

8. Register online, click retry several times usually or until the text changes. Once it has changed read it (to make sure) and then click cancel.

9. Now copy the activation code from the keygen into that box and click finish/done!

Hehehehehehehehe!"
,biker9075,2009-12-07T22:46Z,thanks j-d-uk! all of the other instructions didnt work but yours did
,rickyvesp,2009-12-16T06:05Z,When trying to patch i get an error message saying 'An error has occured while patching the file(s)'. anyone have an idea what im doing wrong and how to get around this
,warped13,2009-12-24T09:36Z,"Hey rickyvesp
I had the same problem but all i did was reopen the keygen by right clicking run as administrator then hit genarate lots of times.  Then went to patch found the folder and it finally worked! so hope either running as administrator or hit generate would do the tick for you"
,maxigawa,2009-12-30T11:31Z,"works fine (the crack) the problem people are having is when you click patch it takes you to the download folder not the installation folder.
just search for the installation folder ie: start,my computer,programmes,sony,vegas pro 9.0
thankyou."
,SintLouis,2010-01-05T16:20Z,"Does anyone else get an error that says ""Requirements not met""? When I open the installer, I get past the language select screen, but things go wrong when it tries to install ""Microsoft visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable"" "
,SintLouis,2010-01-05T17:38Z,"fixes that problem in the last comment, but there's a new one. When I try to patch the files it sais ERROR PATCHING THE FILES
Yes, I have selected the right one from the dropdown menu I've patched the right folder."

IMPORTANTE MESSAGE TO EVERYONE GETTING ERROR WHEN PATCHING!!!! ::


You are probably patching : C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony\Vegas Pro 9.0

That is wrong!!

This is the right one ( Even for 64-bit users like me, Ive got Win7 aswell)

C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Pro 9.0

,Prinzce,2010-03-09T06:00Z,"So sorry to say this, but after installing the program and following all the guidelines I still cant start the program. I get up a window called ""Problem report"" where it says ""Sony Application Registration Utility has stopped working. There they want me to type in info and check a few boxes and send the error report to them..
So cant get the program running at all. i even reinstalled the program 2 times to REALLY make sure i did it all right.

Anyone has been able to work around this problem?"
