,lowcage,2010-05-27T23:47Z,sweeeeet thanks alot man!! really like this show
,ha1991,2010-06-28T07:17Z,"is there someway you can get the spanish audio and upload it as mp3 or ac3? my uncle loves this show, but he can't speak english."
,Lindane,2010-06-29T04:51Z,"Wow these are very nice, pretty great quality for the file size too, and downloaded in under an hour.

(Tip for those trying to play on xbox360):
The xbox360 is capable of playing these, but Vuze automatically tries to convert them, which usually ends up distorting them or fucking up the sound, instead put them on a usb or other flash drive, and play it from there."
,jush86,2010-06-29T09:39Z,Does anyone where to find a list for the right order or the episodes??

,MovieX101,2010-10-13T06:41Z,"Thanks For Up!

@ jush86 - Google it!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-02-11T05:43Z,"@FEARLESS1964: Well done! Thanks. . . Also, since you are open to requests, Do you have other animation? Original Dragonball-Z, the series from the early 70's late 60's called : ""BATTLE OF THE PLANETS"" (sometimes incorrectly labeled as as ""G-FORCE""). Lastly, I heard a rumor of an animated full length movie based on the original ALIEN movie but I have NEVER found any thing other then the rumor to substantiate its existance. ANYWAY. Maybe upload a Txt file with a list of what you have? if you can't thats cool too. Thanks again! great upload!"
,assfaic,2011-11-29T20:21Z,just convert it in format factory. it has the right format presets for both xbox 360 and ps3
