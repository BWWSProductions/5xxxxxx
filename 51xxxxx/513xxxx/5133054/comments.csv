I made an account just to say that you're a fucking TOOL if you don't understand that an R5 is actually a DVD.. like the DISK itself, its just in a different language HENCE the different audio when its converted to the correct language. So in reality an R5 = DVDRip that has an audio track ran over it.

If you want something to complain about go yell at the guys with cam versions where they can't focus or hold the camera still for more then a few seconds.

oh, and stop being a virgin knockx2, jesus dude.. you REALLY need a life.

,tre.work,2009-10-25T04:43Z,"Yeah, pirate this one, it is way way over-rated, the internet hype so manufactured I feel duped to have bought a real ticket. Entirely dull, derivative of Blair and Blair's precursors, and with a Steven Speilberg bogus ending. Pirate its ass."
,PoshNinja,2009-10-25T11:22Z,"Great torrent, LW.

Decent Video and decent Audio.

Also in an attempt to settle this screener/DVDRip controversy..

DVDRip is mainly a tag used to confirm that it's a rip of an *official release* rather than a R5 release.

Screeners, though technically DVDs they're not *official* releases.

Other than that, there's really not much difference other than the variance in quality but if the screener is good enough, it can pass for a copy of an official release.

Remember, everyone.

Screener = Not so official
DVDRip = Official

Conclusion = Different tags for different meanings, other than that, there's really no difference.

Thanks again for the torrent, LW. Keep up the good work."
,amarmitra,2009-10-25T11:35Z,"@ PoshNinja
So you agree that this is NOT a DVDrip. 

@ XoLWoX
KnockX2 was right. This is NOT a DVD rip. You mislabled it. If you think you are good at this, you should probably tag your releases right and let people judge your credibility. Have a sample we we can judge better.

Fake tags make YOU the loser.

Besides, there is another screener that has a sample, looks better and is smaller in size. "

,QoMSoL,2009-10-25T18:04Z,People who think that so called R5 (which only means DVD of region 5 - Russia for example) has any difference from any other DVD apart from the audio language are ignorant idiots! Thank U 4 your attention.
,PoshNinja,2009-10-25T18:52Z,"@ amarmitra

Correction, I don't agree that it *is not* a DVDRip.

How ever, I do agree that it isn't an *official* DVDRip.

R5 is in fact a DVD copy, though not *official* despite being a DVD.

The *official* DVDs are the DVDs that are *officially* released in stores in countries such as the U.S. and the UK, so on, so forth.

Again, there really isn't much difference other than the variance in quality. Other than that, R5 IS a DVD how ever an unofficial DVD.

If anyone else is similar to me, then they will agree that ""R5Rip"" and ""DVDRip"" are only different due to the meaning of the titles.

R5Rip = Unofficial Rip.
DVDRip = Official Rip.

And once more, there's really not much difference other than the variance in quality and an alternative source for the sound. Other than that, technically an R5 is a DVD, just an unofficial DVD.

Whoever fails to understand what I typed is either looking for a pointless e-argument or looking to prove a point that is ultimately moot.

And also once more-- Thanks for the upload, LW."

and this is by far the best ending, why pepole are saying this ending sucks i dont know. "
,DocEvil,2009-11-25T09:39Z,"This is a DVD rip in the loosest of terms. This is NOT a cam in the theater. This is the digital copy of the film as it was one cutting before release to box offices. This will have the ORIGINAL ending and NOT the ending viewed if you went to the movies. I guess there are a few more differences, but I can't say as I didn't go to the theater for this.

Quality on both Audio and Visual is awesome; its just as if you were watching a DVD.

Ending compared to the theatrical version...eh....it was good, but not better. The box office ending was more jumpy/scary. The ending in this version is creepy enough to enjoy.

,froggz,2009-11-28T04:46Z,"How about you all stop bitching over this torrent and go find something meaningful to do with life, you're getting this at no expense its better then all of the cam copies out there. It has been clearly explained what the difference is, this IS a DVDRip just no from a major movie distributing country such as the US or UK. Therfore implying that there was an unnoficial release to some countries. Good torrent, thanks for the upload. "

And you got to love the ""tricks"" they use to try and make it more suspenseful, like the sub-bass with every scene where something is going to happen, playing on subconscious primal responses to try and trigger a state of alertness. Phah."
