,Eztiger,2010-11-01T17:20Z,"@Danellio not 100% but i reckon that you have to register or subscribe to that, it says something just before you play a match, check it out,

Game working 100%, Easy install too, the only problem is that i cant load up any of my saved games, Tryed loading from autosave,quicksave and manuel save but crashes at about 75% of the progress bar, Anyone else having a problem? im running windows 7 ultimate 64bit."
,Eztiger,2010-11-01T18:39Z,"Ok forget last comment, after trying again i noticed that if i leave it about a 45-60sec it eventually loads"
