,KLTRMINISTRN,2010-02-17T19:28Z,"Ras Bumbaclaat, i want ENG subs too! Like now!"
,Cadinot,2010-02-25T02:16Z,Somebody is working on them at Karagarga. I'll upload them if they get posted.
,X45JKD,2010-03-04T13:52Z,"Finally, English subtitles:

Some caveats: the translation is not completely accurate - mistranslated phrases or some phrases simply omitted; some lines are out of sync.
However, it's certainly better than none. Maybe there will be a better English translation soon."
,X45JKD,2010-03-04T14:13Z,"OK. I must apologize. I just went over the subtitles line by line in a subtitle editor, and the translations in the subtitles that I just referred to above are terrible. It seems whoever did it translated from a Spanish translation of it because some of the less easily translated Spanish words were left in place. I tried to fix the the errors, but there were too many to count and it's probably better to wait for another translation.

The bottom line: it's good enough to get the gist of the plot, but if you want a more nuanced and accurate viewing experience, you should wait for a better version."
,SERZT42,2010-03-07T15:27Z,X45JKD -thanks for the information.
,X45JKD,2010-03-18T04:54Z,"Although the video encoding is better on this version, the best English subtitles sync best with the version found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5123960/Ajami.2009.Subbed.DVDRip-JaffA

I highly recommend that version. Excellent subs!

Thank you for the upload, anyway.

PS The English subs can be found in the link in my comments in the above page."
