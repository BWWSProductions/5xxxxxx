I don't get this show though -- 10 minutes into it they've already figured out the persons name (which is all theyre supposed to do) but that doesnt stop them coz the next 35 minutes they go after the bad guy, like they're cops! Aren't these people supposed to have regular lives? I doubt this show will last to the 3rd season... i'll be surprised if they make it to season 2"
