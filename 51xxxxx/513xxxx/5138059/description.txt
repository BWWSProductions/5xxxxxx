Ferrari 308 GT4 Dino - Episode 11

Expert car trader Mike Brewer usually has Â£5000 to purchase and restore an iconic car but this time itâ€™s a little different.
Mike is after a classic Ferrari and thatâ€™s going to take a bit more cash so the budget is going to be blown out of the water. Even going for the more affordable Ferrari 308 GT4 Dino the budget needs to be almost doubled.
With such a risky move is this classic going to reap in the rewards or leave Mike and Edd struggling? With the car being 30 years old and handmade star mechanic Edd has his doubts but begins by knuckling down on the exterior.
Only time will tell if he can get this 70â€™s super-car back to its former glory.
