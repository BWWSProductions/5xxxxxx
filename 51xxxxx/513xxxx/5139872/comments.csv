djstallone--many of the people who watch this show have already read the manga, which is far ahead of the show.

I am one of these people, and I can tell you that you've already been given enough clues to figure out what Pain is, that figuring out what Pain is becomes a huge focus of the next, like, twenty installments, and that since there's not much else interesting to think about while you're watching Naruto, You're better off puzzling over it and guessing for yourself for a while.

But it is cool, once they get there."
