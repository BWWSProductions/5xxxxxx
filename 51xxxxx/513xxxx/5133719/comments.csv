,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-07-29T07:14Z,"Not worth the download in my opinion.

Almost 7gb and the movie is only at 720x480 pixels. I'm guessing it's because there are a few languages and a lot of special features included, but still, i'd expect the quality to be a lot better than this.

A: 7
V: 6

Very disappointed i wasted my time, and money, downloading this because i thought it would be 1080p(or even 720p) resolution. I was at 100% of my bandwidth and pay 2$ for every gb i go over, so basically this download cost me almost 14$. Oh well. lol"
