Hello fellow pirates,

This is a torrent I downloaded from Oink which has, since, sadly, been sunk by Her Majesty's fleet.

It's mp3s, and I know there is another torrent with the same recording in mp3, but mine seems to be of a little more quality.

Contains:

Beethoven's symphonies 1 through 9, performed by Wilhelm FurtwÃ¤ngler.
Plus:
Coriolan Overture, Op. 62
Fidelio Overture, Op. 72b
Leonore Overture No. 2, Op. 72
Leonore Overture No. 3, Op. 72a

MP3, 320 kbps. Those are probably his recordings from the early 50's, so even with such fine mp3 quality (ahem), sound is not exactly what we would expect from a rip of like bitrate of a modern recording. With that in mind, it is still great music with decent, or at least, acceptable sound quality, so


Enjoy : )
