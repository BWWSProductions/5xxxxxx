,mamboze,2009-10-31T07:39Z,"Hi, thanks for this fantastic music. Furtwangler is one of my fav conductors. Unfortunately torrents of much of his music are not working. Very sad as I think Furtwangler is one of the masters of the 20th century along with Klemperer. 
I haven't done a torrent upload yet but I must as I have d/led many Gbs of mainly classical music. 
One question, why you use mp3? I prefer flac but I suppose at 320k/s there's not a lot of difference.
best regards"
,mamboze,2009-10-31T08:08Z,"Sorry I meant to say  torrents are NOT working.
There is a lot of brilliant music by this man which is not available now. 
I know upload costs can be high in some countries which, I guess, might stop people seeding torrents. "
,harigata,2009-10-31T14:26Z,"Hey mamboze,

Thanks for your comment.
First - I got this torrent from Oink (there I was inspired to do my first and only CD rips), which is sadly no longer with us. The sound is not even what you would expect from a 320 kbps MP3, but I guess the recording itself, being from the early 50s, is a major contributor to the quality. It's the only one I could get....

Furtwangler - yes, he is definitely one of the best. Listened many times to this torrent, and learned to love it. Now I know F' is a master, but I didn't like all of his interpretations, though they were, still, high quality performances. The 9th in particular, was too slow, he missed things. He did many performances of all his symphonies, especially of the 9th, and I'm sure some are better than the ones in this collection - well.... what can you do but buy'em and rip'em...

Klemperer... gotta see if they have ""Das Lied von der Erde"" by him here. It's a masterpiece. I've learned to admire him recently, though I didn't approve of his rendering of the Second By Mahler. Tough piece.

If ya wanna rip all you need is:
1) CDs to rip (stuff that has not yet been apploaded in both mp3 & lossless)
2) CD ROM drive in your computer.
3) Any computer bought in the last, oh, 5 years (could be even more) that's not malfunctioning and that can manage the not-so-resource-intensive ripping process.
4) A decent ripping program (I've used Exact Audio Copy - google it - and heard they also recommended Replay Music - you can download it here). Read the manuals (or some easy net tutorials) and you're good to go.
5) Optional - a transcoding program, if you want to convert flac files into mp3, although I don't see any real reason for people to want to download anything that is not lossless, internet speeds being as they are today.

Good luck,
Uploading and sharing IS caring about the future of piracy!

,harigata,2009-10-31T14:44Z,"BTW - my upload rate is circa 60 KB/s - not bad, not too great. Wish it was much higher, but still, I upload several gigabytes a day, since my computer is usually running night & day, with the torrent client always on."
,mamboze,2009-12-23T04:08Z,"Hi harigata,

Sorry for the delay in responding, I haven't been back to TPB for awhile. It's sad to see the music dictators winning a few legal battles here and there over bullshit copyright law. Still they haven't won the war for copyright freedom, that's for sure. 

Anyhow, thanx for your hints on uploading, much appreciated. I have d/l many Gb of music and the time is overdue for me to give back. so New Year's resolution #1 - start uploading. 

I appreciate your comments on Klemperer. I'm very fond of his Beethoven cycle. In lifestyle and his music he was a bit eccentric, but that's no problem for me, should be more of them.  

All power to the file sharing community. 

Best wishes for the New Year. "
,mamboze,2009-12-23T04:11Z,"The comment function seems to be truncating the lines by a few characters.

Anyhow, I said that Klemperer was a bit eccentric.

But no problem there. "
,harigata,2009-12-23T22:34Z,"Hey man,

Didn't know that about Klemperer, but of course, I don't really mind that. Greatness is often misunderstood, and it tends to repay the rest of society in kind.

As for uploading stuff - yeah, I feel I owe the community a lot, especially that my upload rate is only 60 KB/sec, and I can download 10 times faster than that. Plus, we've suffered some very serious losses recently. Demonoid - I fear this.... great, wonderful tracker is not coming back. Mininova - they have stopped displaying all their copyrighted content. And I wonder who else and who's next.... how much longer will the Bay hold?

So, the very least I can do is keep uploading stuff here, most of it I got from Demonoid, to make them available for others.... and if I get my hands on any CD they haven't got here, I'll rip & upload it.

Anyways, good to hear from you : )
