PLOT

This is a story of coal, communism, and the Australian prime
minister who went to war against his own during the national
miners' strike of 1949

Using rare archival footage and re-creations, this dramatised
documentary shows how Labor Party leader Ben Chifley took on
and defeated the growing forces of communism in Australia

The film examines the complex issues that the conflict raised
and introduces the major players in the dispute

A former train driver from Bathurst, Chifley was a working
class hero, a Labor Party icon and 'man of rthe people'. But
his actions flew in the face of Labor values and tradition
when he believed it was in the interests of post-war
Australia

Chifley introduced draconian laws to, prevent unions accessing
funds to support the strike and sent in the army to replace
striking miners - so defeating the Communist Party leadership
that controlled the militant union

This is a fascinating era of Australian history rarely seen on
screen
