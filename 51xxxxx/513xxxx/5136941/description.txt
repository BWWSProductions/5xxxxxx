================================

If for any reason you cannot download the .torrent file, copy the following magnet link in it's entirety and select File, Add torrent from URL from the uTorrent/BitTorrent menu (or ????? if you're using Vuze) and paste. Your client will then download the torrent file not from TPB but from peers. This usually takes a few minutes. Once it has the torrent file it will automatically proceed to download the torrent and save it in your default download location or, if you haven't set one, in %UserProfile%My DocumentsDownloads
