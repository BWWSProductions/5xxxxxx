[V],CanadaJoe,2009-10-26T19:43Z,You're both welcome but the comments I was fishing for were whether the magnet or hashden links were helpful.. ofc if you didn't use them nvm..  =)
,PoshNinja,2009-10-28T01:59Z,"Yes, they were helpful. :)

I couldn't help but notice that the MP3 rip is on a slightly more quiet side than others that I've run across such as the m4a rips. Could just be me.

I'm just happy to have it on my MP3 player now, I listen to it everywhere. Lol."
