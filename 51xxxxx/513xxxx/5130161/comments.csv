Remove your shoes and anything on your head. Unplug all electrical/electronic devices and stand still in the center of the room. Remove any eye glesses/contact, false teeth, and any other prosthetic devices. Stay away from pets and any gas pressurized spray cans and cigarette lighters. On an approximately square sheet of aluminum foil, use an indelible marker to write ""shiny side OUT"" and set it aside until after we show you how much we care about you and that we are your friends, ALL the people work for any of the governments are your close and personal friends and only want the best for you. Now close your eyes and listen for the CLICK

If you have found several sheets of foil on your floor recently, chances are you've tried this and it's not working. We apologize for the inconvenience. Tech support has been notified. To schedule the technician's visit to your ground coordinates, please leave a message after the

PPS: No we do NOT probe. That's the other guys.

PPPS: Black? We wear it because it's cool. What'd you think, it was some form of perfect blackbody energy absorption protective clothing? That's the other guys.

PPPPS: No, I said we do NOT. Not even if you ask nice. No, not for money either. I said that's the other... NO I do NOT want to see your webcam, no DO NOT turn it on... oh jeez
