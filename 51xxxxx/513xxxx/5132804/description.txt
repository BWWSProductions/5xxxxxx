From Wiki:

Thomas Earl "Tom" Petty (born October 20, 1950) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He is the frontman of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and was a founding member of the late 1980s supergroup Traveling Wilburys and Mudcrutch. He has also performed under the pseudonyms of Charlie T. Wilbury, Jr. and Muddy Wilbury.

He has recorded a number of hit singles with the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist, many of which remain heavily played on adult contemporary and classic rock radio. His music, notably his hits, has become increasingly popular among younger generations as he continues to host sold-out shows.[1]

Petty and his band the Heartbreakers celebrated their thirtieth anniversary with a tour in 2006, though Petty has occasionally released solo work, such as 2006's Highway Companion[2], on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation. Members of the Heartbreakers have played on each of his solo albums and the band has always backed him when touring in support of those albums. He has also toured with Mudcrutch in order to promote their debut album.

Petty has been managed by Tony Dimitriades since 1976.[3] On February 3, 2008, Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at the Super Bowl XLII Halftime show
