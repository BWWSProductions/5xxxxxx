Recorded live in Sweden in 1967, this spotlights the humor of the early Mothers on a parody medley of doo-wop and early rock & roll that is both reverent and sardonic. "King Kong" and "It Can't Happen Here," on the other hand, show them equally interested in contemporary avant-garde compositions.

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
