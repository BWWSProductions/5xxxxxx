,nameskay,2009-11-01T14:06Z,"This DOES NOT WORK ive auto fixed it on abgx and all sorts and burned it twice and it says PLAY DVD, the PFI is unknown and its a bullshit torrent."
,lDunKs,2009-11-01T22:23Z,"Ok so this work perfectly for me and im using NTSC USA console. You guys don't have to patch it with abgx360 or w.e Just burn an ActiveIso dvd, which you would insert and play first then remove and then insert any Wave 4 game in and it should work. all new games from now on are WAVE 4."

This looks wave 4, just patch it as usual like wave 3 games and make that ""one-shot boot"" disc, if you dont know how just google it and make sure to use DUAL layer dvd instead of single dvd even though the file to make one-shot disc small.
Put it on your 360 to if you have Ixtrme 1.6 to let it play wave4 games otherwise you cant play wave 4"
,ianmb007,2009-11-04T12:23Z,"Just had my console flashed again upto the new 1.61 firmware. chesked this game on abgx.net and it is verified. it burned and plays perfectly, my only concern is wheather to try on live or not. evry one says its ok BUT Im not sure. what do you reckon, anyone using on live yet and not banned."
,dragkhar,2009-11-05T00:59Z,"I've played it on live just fine, But bans dont typically happen till an update of some type, So the only time to worry is when you see that your consol needs one... lol. 

Although i do have one consern that i cant Verify, When wave 4 first came out people were adding the file from GTA4 to play, And if you log on live that could get you banned, When you put the disk in, you see "".Episodes.From.Liberty.City"", but if you play and go to your dashboard you see GTA4.... Anyone catch my drift? "
,ianmb007,2009-11-05T11:02Z,"cheers dragkhar,
another question though.
I checked from Dashboard and it says liberty city not gta, but I've searched the game and cant find any were to get me on live
do you have to have the first gta in order to play on live. any help please"
,Robbinski,2009-11-05T15:16Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT!!!
I GOT BANNED FROM XBOX LIVE WHEN I PLAYED THIS SHIT FOR 3 FUCKING DAYS!!!!

,ianmb007,2009-11-08T00:44Z,"it works perfectly (other than I couldn't find any live options anywere) (you must require the last gta game to play on live)
as I said it works perfectly but and big fucking but, I have now received the dreaded ban hammer.

,halo37253,2009-11-15T20:49Z,"MS can detect any copied game, so wave 4 or not. they can detect it and you will get banned. if i were you i would stay off line for awhile maybe untill ixtream 1.7 comes out."
,wave10,2009-11-19T04:07Z,It doesn't even matter if you stay offline. I stayed off LIVE for 3 weeks during the mass-banning and as soon as I got online I got the ban notice. Using a BenQ and iXtreme 1.61. They beat us this time... Good luck!!!
,markied20,2009-11-19T08:36Z,Downloaded this and works great. As for me I have to patch this game to wave 3 as my xbox cant read wave 4 eventho i tried using activation.iso (due to different firmware i believe). Anyway thanks uploader!
