He's not going to steal someone else's torrent and claim it as his own... he uploaded Beck for a long time, but stopped. There hasn't been a reliable uploader of Beck's show for a while, and he's just trying to direct people to a source.

Just add Quazza's upload list to your favorites and be happy people like these two are towing the line."
