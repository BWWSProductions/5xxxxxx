Ella (Katie Cassidy) and Riley (Jessica Lucas) arrive at the Anton V photo shoot and meet the photographer - former Melrose Place resident, Jo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga). Jo feels that Riley's inexperience is preventing Jo from getting her shot, so Jo pushes Riley's buttons and insists on a topless shoot to help Riley get in touch with her emotions. Meanwhile, Jonah (Michael Rady) meets with a producer's development exec, Kendra (guest star Jenna Dewan, "Step Up"), who invites him to have drinks later that night to discuss his film. Violet (Ashlee Simpson-Wentz) makes another play for Auggie's (Colin Egglesfield) attention, and Lauren (Stephanie Jacobsen) finds out about David's (Shaun Sipos) secret. Patrick Norris directed the episode written by Jonathan Caren.
