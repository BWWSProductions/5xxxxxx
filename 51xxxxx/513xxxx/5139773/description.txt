The collection of comments in this text file certainly are different from the
ones included with the other Persuasion,(2007).

I like it. The 1995 write-ups are lively, upbeat and positive.

The 2007 comments are too wrapped up in analysis and criticism.

What a difference!

I liked it and I needed it.
