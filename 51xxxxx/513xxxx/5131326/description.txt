The album carries a PA label but there is no actual Parental Advisory sticker on the album cover.

Asher Paul Roth (born August 11, 1985) is an American rapper. He was signed to a joint venture between Scooter Braun's Schoolboy Music and Steve Rifkindâ€™s SRC Records. His first professional release was on June 13, 2008 when the DJ Drama and Don Cannon-helmed The GreenHouse Effect Mixtape was released for free via Rothâ€™s website Thedailykush.com. Roth was featured on the cover of XXL magazineâ€™s annual Top 10 Freshmen: Hip-Hopâ€™s Class â€™09 issue. Roth's debut album, Asleep in the Bread Aisle, was released April 20, 2009.

Sometime in mid 2008, Roth announced he would be making a full studio album and it would be released sometime in early 2009. He started recording in late 2008, and continued into 2009. The first single released was titled, "I Love College", which received many hits across North America. His second single was titled, "Lark on my Go-Kart". After the 2 singles were released, Roth's studio album, Asleep in the Bread Aisle, was released on April 20, 2009.

The album contains a song titled, "As I Em", which was made to confront the problem between him and fellow rapper, Eminem. It was not a diss, but it was to tell people to stop asking why he has a similar voice inflection to Eminem. Eminem later heard this song, and co-signed Asher Roth.
