,nyder,2009-10-26T16:59Z,"hey, eztv, mr. shit for brains.
your tracker isn't working, so quit being a fucking lazy bastard and add:


http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

to your torrent so everyone that downloads it doesn't have to.

fucking wanker "
,mossadek,2009-10-28T20:38Z,"@nyder how about some love for eztv huh? I mean it's not like you're you know paying or anything. Then again those of us who don't up any torrents are obviously well placed to tell those that do how to behave.
