,ultrajouninx,2009-12-03T06:15Z,"Worked fine for the first few hours, but then Avast picked this up numerous times: Sign of ""Win32:Delf-MZG [Trj]"" has been found in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\JAM Software\TreeSize Professional\TreeSize.exe"" file.  

Cant say for sure if it legit or false positive :("

Sign of ""Win32:Delf-MZG [Trj]"" has been found in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\JAM Software\TreeSize Professional\unins000.exe"" file.  "
