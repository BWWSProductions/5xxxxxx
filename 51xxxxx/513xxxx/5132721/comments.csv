Putting the AVI into a RAR didn't even save one single byte of file size, so it's obviously not going to speed up file size.  I just don't see why people do this... it only adds an unnecessary step in the process.  Just upload the AVI and you'll have instant playback abilities."
,ndoggfromhell,2009-10-23T13:48Z,"It's split into rar's so that if a file downloads wrong you can redownload the bad part.  Unlike an avi where you're fucked redownloading the whole avi file again.  It's probably not as necessary for a sub 400 meg file, but for 4 gig movies it's appreciated.   "
