This is a wonderful collection of music, most of which I would never have even heard about if I had relied on Amazon, HMV or Virgin.  There is no way by conventional means that I would have even heard of many of these artists. As it is I have spent the past few weeks listening my way through the stuff I have downloaded and have expereinced new sounds that I would never have found in any other way than through pirate bay and P2P.

There is some great stuiff here. I am particularly fond of all the corsican / sardinian stuff that I would never have fopund otherwise. And some relatively mainstream bands that I had ignored until, now and have just realised what I had been missing.

Thank you n0b0dyh0me - you are what5 P2p is all about. Long may you reign!"
