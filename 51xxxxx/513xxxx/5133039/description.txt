After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
                
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	                
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	                
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce                
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce                
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce                
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

My momma always said, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."' (Forrest Gump)

The same happens here...
This is the fourth of four torrents with several authors, bands, performers coming from all the World...

World Music...

That is: ethnic, jazz, folk, fusion and God only knows what else...

The torrents are sorted only on a rough alphabetical criterium on the artists names.

They are like the Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans of Harry Potter...
You can always eat one of them thinking that it is a nice toffee one, only to discover that it is earwax flavour.
Who knows? :)
So you're warned: Make a good use of them :)
