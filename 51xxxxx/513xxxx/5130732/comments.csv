,DrunkPollock,2009-10-26T06:04Z,how's the audio on this one?
,mooe1965,2009-10-26T07:48Z,"Audio kinda sucks. 

Video is good for the torrent size, but the audio sounds like someone recorded it with a cheap mic in front of a speaker on an old TV set.

Everything is intelligible, though, so it'll still work if you don't worry about that sort of thing."
