,Captain_Kidd,2009-11-05T17:31Z,"Great quality, Ive watched many secret myth rips before, BUT this one is the first one that I couldnt get to play on my xbox 360, Ive probably watched 40 movies from him and always remuxed the audio to two channel for my xbox360 but for some reason this one wont play , it will on my pc but no luck with the xbox. so i just thought I'd put that out there for anyone hoping to watch this on an xbox"
,morrill20,2009-11-06T15:18Z,I was also surprise to find that it did not work on my ps3.
,orinvee,2009-11-13T15:17Z,"Captain Kidd: Are you saying that the two enclosed files (the NFO and JPG files entitled ""How To - 2 CH MP4 for XBOX 360"" do not work"" or did you just perhaps overlook those files?"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2009-11-15T04:53Z,Thanks. Nice rip.
,billibuoy,2009-11-15T11:22Z,My first time of using Piratebay/miro or any other file share. This dload worked great The ugly truth is one of the funniest films I have seen for some time - saw it on the cinema screen last week and asked a friend how piratebay worked so that I could watch it  again 15/11/09
,Hyperlink,2009-11-18T06:57Z,"Thank you so much for your uploads SecretMyth. I also had a problem playing this upload on my Xbox 360. I used YAMB to convert the audio, but it still didn't play. "
