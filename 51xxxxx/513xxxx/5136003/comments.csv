UFC.104.Machida.vs.Shogun.PPV.aAF.avi
apparently its in a .rar and password proctected
and better still there isn't a password included..."
,ZenRhino,2009-10-25T17:56Z,"Machida is good, but he's a punk coward for running away like he does... he won't be able to keep that up forever cuz UFC fans will bitch to Dana White & eventually Machida will be told to ""nut up or shut up"" and fight like a man - that'll be when he loses!!"
,milanfc,2009-10-25T18:55Z,I think so too. Shogun won and even machida didint expekt that he hade still the belt.I dont know what fucking judges they have there or who gives the decizions or mayby they whant rematch betuin them.This dussnt change that  he is realy tuf and a great champion but yestaday the winner for me was Shogun.Shogun the champ

,bitchesbrew,2009-10-26T09:28Z,this torrent did not work for me Everything else always works
,zigme,2009-10-26T16:27Z,"Despite the fact it was recorded from a hd tv broadcast, the video quality of the file itself is far from excellent. In fact, it's somehow disappointing.
Oh, and to all the poor guys who were told by moodybooty the main event outcome, it is not as if it wasn't all over the internet when it ended.

I could care less about the watermark, I think you're asking a lot for something you're getting for free if you think the watermark was a hindrance.  Picture is quite clear, I've seen better, but I'm very happy with this.

I can also care less about the audio, I get these to watch and learn from - not listen to the bogus pre-fight hype or the moronic color commentators.
