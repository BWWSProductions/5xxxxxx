,tooticki,2009-12-13T13:54Z,"Hi WunSeeDee!

I want to thank you for these fantastic uploads. I haven't been able to post forever. I couldn't log in to my old account and signup didn't work for a long time. So please see this as a replacement for the hundreds of thanks I would have posted, had I been able too. Yes, I have downloaded all your files, except, I think, two.

A special thanks for providing subtitles. I read and write English well enough (I hope), but it's a whole other thing with movies. Accents, slang, background music and sounds... it all make it hard for a poor ESLer.

Kudos! :-)"
