Javier Solis - La Historia de Javier solis (m4a 320kbps)


Many fine singers have come close, but Javier Solis is still regarded by many as the best bolero ranchera singer Mexico has ever produced. Since his death in 1966, there have been dozens of hit compilations. Luckily, this collection contains most of Solis's biggest hits: "Payaso," "Cenizas," "Sombras," "Media Vuelta," "Lloraras, Lloraras," and "Si Dios Me Quita la Vida." And while Solis got most of the credit, it's important to remember he worked with topflight producers, studio musicians, and, most critical of all, excellent song material from Rafael Ramirez ("Lloraras, Lloraras"), Luis Demetrio ("Si Dios Me Quita la Vida"), and Jose Alfredo Jimenez ("Media Vuelta"). But the combined power of vivid tearjerker songs enveloped in gorgeous mariachi arrangements is nothing without Solis's exquisite vocals and tough but compassionate stance.
