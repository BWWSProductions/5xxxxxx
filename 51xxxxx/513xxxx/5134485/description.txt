"I Don't Believe You" is a song by American recording artist Pink. It will be released as the sixth single from her fifth studio album, Funhouse, in Australia on October 23, 2009 and in the the United Kingdom on November 2, 2009. In the U.S. it is being released to Hot AC and AC formats as the 4th single instead of "Funhouse".

Musically, the song is a mid-tempo pop ballad, set in common time and played in the key of A-flat major. The guitar and piano are used for the background music, while Pink's voice follows the Aâ™­ â€”Fm7â€”Cmâ€”Dâ™­â€”Aâ™­ chord progression. Pink explained on her website that, lyrically, the song is about pleading for reconciliation, and is her favourite song from Funhouse "because it's just so naked. It's like taking a deep breathe and saying, 'Here I am. Take me. Take your best shot'." She went on to explain that:

The first thing that comes to my mind with I Don't Believe You is me standing in the vocal booth listening... Actually in the control room listening to this song, tears running down my face, just like 'fuck, really?' It's the vulnerable weak side of me that I don't let out very often. And it's [sighs], yeah it's that song. And I love it, I love it. I just love it, it's very near and dear to me.


The music video for "I Don't Believe You", directed by Sophie Muller, was shot in September 2009 in Los Angeles, California. The video is in black and white, it features Pink in the wedding dress she wore to her real wedding as she searches for her lover, to no avail. Scenes include Moore lying down in the dress, running around what appears to be the inside of a church, and singing to herself in front of the mirror.
