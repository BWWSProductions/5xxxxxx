,mibrons,2009-10-24T11:59Z,"Lol nobody cares if you don't believe, it's everyones personal choice afterall do they download or not.

I prefer cracked one though :O"
,Maxx2009,2009-10-24T13:08Z,"The final build is called 7600.16385.090713-1255. Is this exactly the same? If yes, you might want to change the description maybe?"
,noellife2000,2009-10-24T15:16Z,"I believe when I first saw this torrent, the build number was not written that's why I asked if it is the final or rtm"
,Vidpro007,2009-10-24T16:49Z,"What is the offline 20510 update pack for then, wasn't that to update 16385 to 20150.  Anyone got any clarification on why the ""packaged"" releases aren't 7600.20150?"
,wheelman44,2009-10-24T17:57Z,Double checked the registry and it is like maxx2009 said  7600.16385.amd64fre.win7_rtm..090713-1255 what is written in the reg string
,ScreamingDeath,2009-10-24T17:57Z,my only concern is will we still be able to get service packs and windows updates?
,wheelman44,2009-10-24T18:05Z,yes you do still get updates.... when first installed thats the first thing i did
,ScreamingDeath,2009-10-24T18:16Z,"Ok, why is it saying 1 seed?? Shouldn't it be saying 3,000 seeds?"
,ScreamingDeath,2009-10-24T18:17Z,"Ok, its still saying 1 seed, but for peers it looks fine:
49(630) on Vuze."
,ScreamingDeath,2009-10-24T19:21Z,"Like i can see that!!! re-do it, except make it larger!!!!!!!"

,ShadowMastr,2009-10-25T20:00Z,"Was a quick enough download for me, thanks for the torrent.

@screamingdeath, lighten up ahole, first line of the description says no key or crack included. Some people like to get a clean install disk. There are a number of activators available, gee.... maybe even here at TPB??? I downloaded 2, am trying to decide which one to go with. Eset had a problem with both, but it's most likely false psitives, since both downloads were from respected people."
,denniz94,2009-10-25T22:10Z, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       ARE THIS GENUINE    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE GUYS ANSWER ME. ARE TRHIS GENUINE
,wheelman44,2009-10-26T00:45Z,nice well i guess some people don't know how to read the description and if you don't like that its not preactivated ScreamingDeath then don't download it then 
,wheelman44,2009-10-26T00:50Z,you are asking if this is GENUINE well you get all updates and such no key is include or cracks but this runs smoothly and how its supposed 2 so i guess it is 
,kumpao,2009-10-26T04:19Z,"do i have to use an activator? or how can i use it
?
"
,wheelman44,2009-10-26T04:43Z,well best way is if you bought a key enter it in and register but activators are available in the usual places
,kumpao,2009-10-26T04:47Z,"can you tell where can i find an activator that works with it?
if you know about it"
,wheelman44,2009-10-26T05:10Z,ok here try this one Windows 7 Loader v1.6.9 (x86-x64) - By Daz [RH] search for it u should find it
,Vidpro007,2009-10-26T16:23Z,"@ScreamingDeath - First if you can read, then read the description.  This is just like you get ""out of box"", except no serial.  If you have ever installed an OS before, then this should be pretty clear.  Obviously, by looking at your comment, this might be your ""first"" time, hence the screaming like a virgin at the uploader.  Get some digital chops, man up, and figure it out.  Don't disrespect a great up with your lack of 01101110 knowledge."
,wheelman44,2009-10-26T23:08Z,"i do agree Vidpro007...... if you guys have any question at all just ask me. And if you do not likle what is available on this download at all, like i said before go somewhere else and get something you are looking for "

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-10-27T15:50Z,"with vista oem disk, the DVD had all the HOME and ULTIMATE on it. the load depended on the KEY you used. is this the same way or is just ULTIMATE? (ps i know that if you do not put in a key it loads ULTIMATE!) 

thanks gang!"
,wheelman44,2009-10-27T23:12Z,maybe later when windows 7 is been out for awhile that options could come available on a dvd
,allyman8,2009-10-29T04:49Z,"Okay, i have Windows Vista, 64 Bit.

I am wondering, how can i install this without a USB or Disk?.

Is it possible? Will it mess my PC up? 

I have installed Ubuntu, and other OS's before, but i had Disks.

Could i just open up the Setup in the ISO?

I mounted with daemon tools.

(I am using a different torrent than this, but the same stuff should apply, right?)

Thanks."
,nee_vapir,2009-10-30T10:56Z,"This will upgrade vista 64 bit to win 7 64 bit! You only have to do a fresh install if you have vista 32 bit and going to win 7 64 bit but yes allyman8 it should work the way you said! But if you have not run win 7 before on your pc I would not do the upgrade just go to http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windows7 and read all the problems people are having, best to do a dual boot and test first if it will work for you with out problems first or just leave vista on tell you can!"
,allyman8,2009-10-30T23:16Z,"I put it in VMWare (Virtual OS)

And it was pretty good ;D"
,phr3shxboi,2009-12-03T04:39Z,"Hello wheelman44 I love the torrent works like a charm. I installed it and every thing creadted my user profile, named my comp, you no the good stuff. Well shortly after that i was taken to a screen that says Set UP Windows at the top left corner. Inside of the box it says Windows 7 ultimate then in smaller letters it says Windows is Finalizing your settings. And there is a status bar under it with the green thing strobing thru it. Well i was trying to use Windows 7 before i had to go 2 skool in the morning but i had to go. o i left it on the charger on that screen. I came home about 7 hours later and the same thing was still going. Now its more like 13 hours later and its still going. I dont understand why it wont get of of this screen. I really need help because i cant use my laptop right now because of it. Im sure it shouldnt take one half of the day to do this. Please help if you need to you can email me at"" godj13@ymail.com ""(with out the quotation marks). Please reply...."
,paro17,2010-05-16T23:40Z,hey wheelman44 ..is this a bootable...can i fully format with your verison? ...wat i mean by bootbale is when restart my computer i should be able to access the cd before i get in to the window
,Dorkside,2010-10-19T13:57Z,let's just hope i can get a clean instal with this thing. and idd best choice is just buy a OEM disk for around 160âŹ and install it from there you lose more time wasting around with cracks. if you crack a game it's cool if you crack windows 9 times from the 10 you get fucked :) 
,g.qbeats,2010-12-05T23:55Z,Can somebody help me seed..Im almost there been waiting for 20hrs
,Timst185,2011-04-11T02:25Z,"Installs Perfectly, NO CRACKS or ACTIVATIONS included.

THIS is the version for you if you already have a Win7 Ultimate CD Key as I did and just need a copy of the x64 Ultimate Disc to re-install.

No Service pack is included but all the updates along with SP1 install just fine.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD if your looking for a Pre-Activated or Cracked Copy. IF on the other hand you need a nice, clean x64 install - This is the one to go for :-)

Thanks wheelman44. A+ for uploading this.
