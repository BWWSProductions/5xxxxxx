Like her direct descendent Princess Diana, Georgina Duchess of Devonshire was a glamorous royal, much loved by the public. While her attractiveness and charm afforded her popularity, the intelligent and vulnerable Duchess was trapped within a loveless marriage to one of the country's richest men. Rebelling against the establishment, Georgina became active campaigner for the liberal party and in turn, romantically involved with Earl Grey, leading her through tragedy, self-discovery and redemption.

Saul Dibb (Bullet Boy) directs an all star cast including Keira Knightley (as the Duchess), Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Attway.
