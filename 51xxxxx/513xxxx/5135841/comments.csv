Yeah its cool that all the videos are like 15 megabytes but the quality is SHIT.  it wouldn't be so bad on an ipod but you can only play them with fucking realplayer or vlc, and i dont have the patience to convert a million episodes to a good format like avi or m4a.

V: 1
A: 4

dont download or seed"

,bimock,2010-01-19T19:34Z,"Very nice effort. People, it's 20 seasons of one series taking only 7.5 GB, that's fucking awesome :D .... Thank you my friend.... Now, if you can do Scrubs as well..... "
,Hilpi75,2010-03-06T11:49Z,"Yeah...  Right    Awesome if you're Deaf, Dumb and Blind!!!   

2 Thumbs up for Effort and a swift kick in the Ass for result....   Each Episode should be at least 250mb since 15 inch Monitors are a thing of the Past...."
,amin4ever,2010-05-28T00:44Z,"Thank you so much Bolanboy :
Great effort and it's probably not a good quality but if you dumb retards wanted a HQ you wouldn't look for a torrent with 7.5GB for 20 seasons. So shut your mouths and write your comments elsewhere !!!!
Thank you again uploader, that's very nice of you. Hopefully there will be enough seeds to complete this. 
Keep up :D"
