I don't have to upload the internet radio recordings anymore because another uploader is uploading the CF version. If you go to either of the sites listed in the text file, you'll find links to both places the new uploader has his torrent. Sorry for any confusion and you're not being ungrateful. I greatly appreciate your interest and I'm glad that you're keeping me on my toes. Thanks."
