,Dr1pDr0p,2009-10-28T13:17Z,"When I play this with VLC it crash's after a few frames.  What bothers me more is that included in the leech is QQplayer.  Googling this informs me that many folks have been virused often with this
application.
I would most certainly be very careful with this.

,1MSCD2J,2009-10-29T18:51Z,Why does this old movie got so many leechers?
,nerd707,2009-10-29T21:55Z,"1mscd2j the reason this ""old movie"" has so many leechers is because this i the first time it's in HD. It's one of the best movies of the 90s and to see it in HD makes it 100x better.

Oh and you think this is old? I bet you're one of those ""if it's not new I don't like it"" kind of people... or ""eww it's in black and white"" people. "
[V],-jonny-,2009-10-30T16:01Z,lol 90s is not old.

pacino and de nero in 1 movie!!!"
[V],-jonny-,2009-10-31T02:00Z,there are no viruses
,manieks69,2009-11-11T00:04Z,"I don't get it, the official blu-ray site says that release date of BR version of this movies is actually today but this rip was uploaded two weeks ago... how is this possible? Is this really bluray? For me is more like some HDTV from russian or chinese tv + these weird files in torrent..."
,bongowolf,2009-12-02T21:21Z,"I'm having trouble playing this on standard players - like Realplayer, etc. While the image is great, the sound is completely out of synch.

Question: Why should I have to download QQPlayer to play this?  Gotta tell you it makes me VERY suspicious of any movie download that won't play on common, widely-used players.

If I cannot find another major, commonly used player to play this on . . .  then I'm deleting the whole, entire file.  I sure as hell ain't gonna take a chance putting some QQPlayer on my computer.  And I'd advise everyone else - if a movie will ONLY play on a special player, DUMP IT."
,w000ter,2010-01-06T02:09Z,"real player?
what kind of idiot are you"
[V],-jonny-,2010-01-13T16:45Z,"@manieks69
Things do exist before their retail date, you know."
[T],zeromancer,2010-01-19T22:47Z,are you ever coming back jonny? your rips are awesome.
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-01-30T00:43Z,"hey Jonny, thx, this looks cool and realistic
with 4866 kB/s for video and 6.6 GB for a 3 hours movie.

Can you imagine,there is a 1080p rip out there
with Video Bit rate : 3 132 Kbps and 4.37 GB size. 
How sad that people ruin HD quality.

thx again, this is now the apx the 20-th rip I dl from u. I always upload back 3 x your torrents(This way I dl it much faster too ;-). cheers."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-01-30T17:22Z,"here is a snap shot from one of the cleast scenes:

To be honest it doesn`t look much better then an ordinary DVD.

So many blue ray are released nowadays (just to sell better) with ordinary picture.

It's not jonny's fault, some blue rays are simply not that beautiful.

I've been more then generous, uploaded 5.25 Ratio(here is the proof):

(done in 6 hours, although so many mean peers out there)"
[V],-jonny-,2010-06-20T23:25Z,"Quality is much better than DVD. But it's not exactly a visually beautiful movie...
More info in the review linked to above."
,joshokie,2011-02-10T06:12Z,"@jonny

Thank you for uploading this. I have been meaning to see this movie since I was a youngling."

,zorn1,2012-01-03T16:39Z,"720p in not too low (right) bitrate and well just what I want but there's too few seeders and it'll take a long, long time to download this so I'm not really sure what to do..."
