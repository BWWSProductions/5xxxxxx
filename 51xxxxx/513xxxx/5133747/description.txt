[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin - October 20, 2009: Quantum to Cosmos (Q2C) Festival - Wired 24/7?[/b]

Overwired? Technology and our daily life. Part II of The Agenda at The Quantum 2 Cosmos Festival.

[u]The Debate: Wired 24/7[/u]

Would you be able to survive one day without your television? Computer? your Blackberry? Our grandparents didn't need them. Some of our parents lived without them. And yet these technologies are now an integral part of our lives, for better or for worse. Where will the wired world lead us next? And will we be happy with what we find at that destination?
