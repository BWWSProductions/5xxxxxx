,kastlebay,2009-10-22T15:58Z,brilliant - no password to open the DMG ... and what about the serial for the software included in the DMG?
,LochDhueDude,2009-10-22T20:47Z,"Apparently our anonymous (yet trusted) poster placed the key in a separate post at:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5132167/iSale_5.5.1%5Bk%5D.rar

but isn't seeding that one! 
It looks like Serial Box has several 5.5.1 keys tho..."
,LochDhueDude,2009-10-22T21:06Z,Serial in the txt file
,krypton2,2009-10-31T23:09Z,"How do you enter the registration data? When I try to do so, it takes me to a website to create an account. Am I missing something. Please post detailed instructions if possible. "
,hafatash,2009-11-03T20:09Z,@krypton2: I have the same issue. The registration data in this zip seems useless. Anyone know how we can get this working?
,aarontic,2011-01-25T10:25Z,"@EVERYONE!!! I have had the same problem with the lack off a password, if you use the TXT file the email etc... need a passwword to activate account?? is this the developer changing the registration system to avoid people like us??"
,matthorton,2011-03-04T11:02Z,"hi im having the same issue with the password. i click on 'Activate iSale' and it asks for the email address. and that is fine, it says 'welcome back' and then there is a box for the password. none of the details provided in the text file work as the password including the serial number. and it doesnt work if i leave it blank. am i going about this the right way? if so can somebody please provide a password and if not, how do i do it?

cheers"
