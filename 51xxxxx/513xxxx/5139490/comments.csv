,verbose2,2009-10-29T15:46Z,"Unfortunately though, jonny's torrent is rarred so if you also feel like seeding, much of your upload progress will likely end up being deleted or in someone's trash bin. This version however doesn't have that problem because the file you download ends up being the same exact file you watch.
Also, if you're coming here from jonny's torrent and have already downloaded and unpacked his files, you can now safely delete the useless rars and begin uploading to this torrent. They're the exact same files.

Be a friend to the community and stop uploading rars, thank you."
[V],-jonny-,2009-10-29T17:53Z,fuck off you cunt
,verbose2,2009-10-29T18:00Z,"This is what you wanted is it not?... ""Ungrateful fuckers can go elsewhere"".... At the time there was no where else to go, so I made my own torrent out of your shitty rars. You should be satisfied now."
,aliasdavidoff,2009-10-29T21:48Z,"@-jonny-
Thanks for a great movie.
@verbose2
Thanks! I've been waiting for this. I will never reseed rars, so I don't download them. This cooperation seems to be the solution for me: jonny upload, You download/unrar and upload again! Great!"
[V],-jonny-,2009-10-30T15:45Z,"no, davidoff"
,Ulyss31,2009-12-08T18:01Z,"Alright, I'll download Jonny's version, un-pack it, and then seed your version because at the moment, there's a lack of seeders on your torrent... but hey, thanks for the Unrared version mate :) and Jonny... hope you understand the ""why"" and the ""how""? Otherwise... let's say you're... aw, nevermind, I'm not here for bitching... Love you!"
,Mimimae,2010-04-10T03:05Z,"I agree, those huge files in rar format are nuisance, and it makes reseeding more complicated, and sometimes prevents me from seeding. 
I often have to stop seeding fully downloaded torrents because  want to see what is within and when I unpack rars I just don't have enough space for both versions. Don't get me wrong I have a lot of space, but it gets filled from time to time, and than I have to stop seeding something that I otherwise would continue.
It is even harder too see what is within the downloads, so I greet this unpacked reseedings, even if I understand the original seeders frustration.
And you -jonny-, as much as you are appreciated as uploader, please make life easier for all of us and stop being stubborn with those damned unnecessary rars. No matter how  clever you are in explaining them in widths and lengths. Love to you all.

,MonoKulen,2010-09-28T23:29Z,"Hey Verbose2. Leave -johny- alone. There's no point arguing here. His motivation behind seeding .rar files is simply because he seeds in warez worlds where you can download 100mb parts. That's the only reason. He is using your interest in his seeding just to troll you giving you names like fuctard or whatever. 

Thanks for seed."
,azrulleus,2010-10-20T11:36Z,"Very nice to unrar and re-uploading, keep it up. Rars really bug me, they have no place in torrent distribution. (Yes, I've examined all the arguments for and against, and there really are NO good arguments for rars in torrents.)"
