,fritz1965,2009-11-08T14:05Z,"You can get the exact same file directly from their website.  Without a serial number it is only a limited demo version, so what was the point in wasting you time uploading this????"
,yoniperez2008,2009-11-10T00:23Z,if you want the key       yoni012009@hotmail.com
,fritz1965,2009-11-17T04:38Z,"This guy doesn't answer emails, so as far as I'm concerned he's full of crap and doesn't have a valid key.  Wait long enough and someone who's credible will provide a good crack or serial."
,fritz1965,2009-11-21T20:14Z,KILLA-CONNI: Thanks for the serial- worked like a charm :)
,tomreedtoon,2009-12-04T21:26Z,"Did anybody have a problem with this? When I tried to install it, it crashed...and my computer ended up with a virus or worm or something. Had to Nuke and Pave my system. Is this even a real release of TuneBite?"
,nimrodxx,2010-01-02T18:40Z,The key worked fine. I downloaded my 7 from a different source though. the program was good but the key wasn't. This key did the job.
