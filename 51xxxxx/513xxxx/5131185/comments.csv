God Bless Geert Wilders!"
,WWIII,2009-10-22T21:46Z,"you know, i listened to Geert Wilders on the savage nation the other day, decided to look him up... turn's out he's atheist, i mean don't get me wrong xD i really could care less about his religious views, but i find it very appealing that he pushes for Judeo-Christian values and for that i respect him ^_^ 

*raises mug*
god bless Geert Wilders
god bless rush limbaugh
god bless michael savage
and god bless the conservative movement!"
,AladinSane1984,2009-10-22T22:23Z,"I follow Zeitgeist/God who wsn't there view.
That said
God Bless These United States of America.
A Republic if we can keep it.
Pry Constitution from my cold, dead fingers."
,WWIII,2009-10-22T22:45Z,"Agreed, we must protect our republic and our constitution!

we can not allow the throwback ideas of the 60's and the 30's to take root, for i believe this is the seeds of destruction for this great land!

down with trade to china,
reconstruct the Iraq and Afghanistan constitution to be like ours, to have no ""official"" religion... to allow them to practice freely, without fear!

kick berry out of office, and if need be send him back to kenya or wherever he was born!

our constitution IS TO BE UPHELD, it is the greatest document in the history of human kind, besides the bible!"
