BTW, I'm planning to get Ghost/Pink Turns Blue, U posted the song Can't Be Love that I like very much in Vol14. What about the rest of the album? Is it any good?
PS. I have the CD of Well Well Well for those interested although it's not that fantastic."

I know that some of these were on promos I got at the time."
[V],80zforever,2009-10-25T17:27Z,"fanciz, ghost is not a bad record, but not greatest either. If anyone knows Kuruki, it's possibly you hahaha.

SteamRadio11, if you're playing these songs to your listeners, then change your name to non-SteamRadio11 !!  cheers guys"
,Estlin,2009-10-28T15:55Z,"Hey 80zforever:

Sine you're from the Wet Coast, do you remember an 80s new wave-ish band called 4th Floor? It put out a two-song EP: Black and White, and Follow in Stride. I used to have the vinyl, but no longer. Any chance that you have it? (I don't know if 4th Floor ever made a full LP.)

Thanks"

[V],80zforever,2009-11-02T04:01Z,"Hi Estlin, I knew them pretty well (personally), Maxwell brothers with Tim and James! I have the single for sure, but I need to find it in the storage room. Also I don't remember how the vinyl has aged since 1985. stay tuned.
