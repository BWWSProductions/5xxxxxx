HOLY....Rosa you RULE. YOU FREAKIN' RULE. 

Let me counteth the ways:

1) a legendary music video source for a loooong time.

2) who has been on a roll lately with rare 70s/80s stuff and then the Johnny Cash show live performances...

3) and now the Pink Floyd super post just in time for Halloween.

Can we rename a constellation or something in her honor? Cassiopeia the Queen should be Rosa sitting in front of a computer uploading music videos.

So yeah...uh what I am trying to say is thanks so much Rosa for these and for so many years of quality rips! Video brings the past to life and you bring us the video!"
