,bakaonna,2009-10-25T22:12Z,"Ok, i'll bite - as i've stated before, i appreciate your work very much. My favourite sites are TTOO, FM, DB, HT, WA, WP, MIP, CM, PD, CB(dunno if it still produces vids) - basically most of Kink and a bit of others. As far as appreciation goes, dropping a line is fine by me (or adding a quality point) - yet for a more precise form of measuring how well received a torrent is, you might try checking how many people keep seeding after a period of time. For instance, i loved HT-5225 with Devaun and kept seeding it for approximately three months."
