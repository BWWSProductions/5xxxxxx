Not sure what I think yet about ""range of awareness"" or ""military psychic studies"" - but I'll be learning more soon enough. =) The first hour sounds fascinating too - I don't know much about either of these UFO events - I'm gonna be glued to my player for a while here. LOL!

Hey - there's show notes with the files too - awesome!! Thank YOU! I appreciate all your efforts."
