Attack on Pearl Harbor is an aerial combat game to relive the action-filled dogfights of the Pacific Theater of WWII as both Japanese and American pilots. Featuring arcade-styled gameplay and an accessible interface, players will be able to quickly jump into the cockpit and take part in exciting aerial battles. Richly detailed graphics, graphic-novel inspired cutscenes and realistic radio chatter round out the experience. Attack on Pearl Harbor features four solo campaigns, plus a "quick play" dogfight mode. In addition to the initial Japanese attack on Oahu, the game also offers a host of famed and challenging scenarios such as the Battle of Midway, Iwo Jima, Burma and Manila. Each campaign spans several months during 1941-1945, presenting an exciting and varied selection of missions.

    * Intuitive controls â€“ Pick up and play the game via a simple, straightforward control scheme that'll have anyone flying in seconds.

    * Instant action - An accessible interface makes it easy for anyone to jump straight into the biggest aerial battles of WWII.

    * Multiplayer dogfighting action â€“ Up to 12 players can fight it out via the Internet or LAN, fly solo or team up in squadrons as either American or Japanese pilots. (untested)

    * Choose your side â€“ Dashing Douglas Knox of the USAAF or fighter pilot Zenji Yamada of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service.

    * Riveting action - Take off from the deck of an aircraft carrier in the most prolific fighters, bombers and torpedo-bearing aircraft of the WWII Pacific Theatre! Historical Locations â€“ Fight the selfsame battles that determined the outcome of the war including Doolittle Raid, Pearl Harbor, The Battle of Midway and Iwo Jima!

    * Unique cutscenes - The campaign is advanced through graphic novel-inspired animation panels which bring an exciting and refreshing feel to the game.

Attack on Pearl Harbor is a pick-up-and-play WWII flight combat game appropriate for all ages and skill levels.
Attack on Pearl Harbor includes four campaigns as either the Japanese or Americans as they fight in over 50 battles of World War II. Some of the key locations include:

	* Pearl Harbor - this location reflects the actual location of Pearl Harbour on the island of Hawaii. The harbour is located on the South coast of the island.

	* Wake Island - Scattered island with one airfield on one insland. On another island are the millitary buildings.

	* Midway - Two islands with airports, harbours and other millitry buildings.

	* Manila - The city of Manila has a river (Pasig River) running through the northern part, with the main city to the south of the river.

	* Japan - An area of Japanese mainland with a small section of coast showing. On the coast is a large city.

This is not a flight simulator to keep track of numerous technical details of your aircraft, this is an AERIAL-COMBAT SIMULATOR !

Attack on Pearl Harbor asks nothing from players in terms of control familiarity, allowing immediate and unquestioning involvement in the dog fighting rather than the subtleties of aviation. The missions themselves are equally quick and hard hitting, without requiring ten minutes of navigation.
