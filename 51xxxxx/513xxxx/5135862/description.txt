The Dorktones -Pop Go The Dorktones

The Dorktones are a three piece combo hailing from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with limited skills but with a great passion for sixties music. They play sixties-garage-punk styled tunes from unknown or forgotten artists, with an occasional original thrown into the mix. This results in a totally eclectic playlist of songs, all thrown into the Dorktones blender to create that special raw and loud dorky sound.
