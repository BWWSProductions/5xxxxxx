(see wikipedia for what I mean, it says it was only shown to the public one time) I'm dying to see that one cause it seems even more wicked than the theatrical release version. I have the limited screener version, and it seems tame compared to the theater version, so thanks again for this so I can choose which version to see!!"
,lizzyborden,2009-10-23T22:49Z,"No problem. I haven't seen anything about the 3rd ending.  If I do find it, I'll post it."
,keithdylan,2009-10-24T16:38Z,looks like you did a great job.  Thanks
,keithdylan,2009-10-24T20:17Z,"FYI:
  This seems to be PAL format."
,inkzomia,2009-10-30T11:53Z,"Question: Does this have the parts of the theatrical release version?? Because i believe someone who's seen the theatrical release says that the theatrical version not only has a different ending but also several scenes of demonic possessions and stuff. So I would like to know if this has those things, I really want the theatrical version as the majority says it's better. Never watched the movie, so no spoilers please. THX."
,goofygal21,2009-11-01T03:57Z,I'm new at this and am having a problem downloading it.  Can anyone help and let me know what I am doing wrong? Do I need to download something to get the movies>
,share00,2009-11-02T04:15Z,"the ending of the ""internet version"" and the ""theater version"" are different."

Three great programs to use and look for.Yo can find them all hear under application area on TPB
I have and have been using them for years
Convertxtodvd
Dvd santa
ojosoft total video converter
I use them all and they're all great/
One exception if you use windows vista convertxtodvd will slow your computer way the hell down and sometimes the program freezes up.
I only use that program if i don't plan on using my computer for an hour or so."
