I cobled this together with the theatrical ending thats going around. The vid is split so you watch the movie to day 21, then choose the ending you want. The quality of the original is great, the theatrical ending is a cam, but you'll get the point. Don't forget to burn to a dvd you need to make an AUDIO_TS folder. Enjoy, and please seed.
