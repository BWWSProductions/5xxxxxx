then start the game from that file."

Check around google to find possible solutions, tho none worked for me..."
,jameswsparker,2009-12-23T01:28Z,"@SwingingDead69. 

It's most likely the case that Prototype isn't compatiable with the Xbox 360 controller; but either way I have a solution. 

Go to Google and search for a piece of software called 'Xapper', it basically allows you to assign keyboard keys to your Xbox controller. 

So when you hit a key on your controller, it's as if you are pressing it on your computer keyboard. 

Hope I have been of some help. "

3. Rename [ ..\Prototype\Audio\audio\ambience.p3d ] into something else.

Downloaded. Installed. First working fine. But again as I read in comments there is bug with sound. Then it started to freeze, though i have good video card etc. Then at Loading of second level it just doesn't load. Already loading for like an half an hour, but nothing. Don't know what that might be.
Just wanted to tell also game is interesting. Weird beginning, you start from the end of the game, then go into beginning of the story on the second level. But they start to explain you how to control your cute freak only there, not in the beginning, that's also weird.
If anybody knows how to fix bugs I have written before...let me know.

ive been downloading and seeding here for a little over a year now and demo'd some great games , heard some music etc, i highly suggest seeding if u are to download, and buy it if u like it, respecting the uploaders as well.

as for installing, over a year of doing it all i do even with iso's most of the time, i just winrar to a new folder i set to desktop, extract files to the folder, 90% of time it will say something like crack, bunch of dll files setup.exe (as an application) *whatevergame.exe) etc...i run setup.exe...let it install. if has multiple disc folders ill mount the ISO files with daemon tools, once installed, open crack folder, gave the exe file, and any DLL files in folder and paste them in directory u installed the game. go to directory create shortcut to desktop and enjoy... ill try and help with more technical issues now that i decided to register .....btw sorry for WALL OF TEXT but rushing to get things ready for this game...making backup disc ready, raeding comments to see if i need to get a crack for it or if its available etc...

hope this wall of text helps u all out if not, no worries its not like i wasted much of my time "

the first mission, it'll be hella choppy unless you have a state of the art rig, cause there is a CRAPLOAD to process and render (so many models, so much AI, and, like I said, there's a FUCKTON to render, considering you're in Time Square in the afternoon during the viral outbreak). The rest has been running fine.

Don't forget to download latest Games for Windows Live - Solves a lot of your problems.
I believe this one is 3.2 http://www.shacknews.com/downloadpop?file_id=15286

But all in all, it's a pretty simple process
1. Unrar using winrar
2. mount using %120 Alcohol or, my favourite, Daemon Tools
3. Install

AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HAVING ""Wrong Disc"" ERRORS:

4. Copy the crack (located in the download - should say prototyperf or something like that) and paste it in the Prototype game directory (C: > Program Files (x86) > Activision > Prototype)

5. locate the file you JUST pasted in that directory - right click and select ""Send To > Desktop (create shortcut)""

voila! your game should be running fine when selecting this desktop shortcut.

For those of you having a problem with the first level (following the prologue)... Did you not read the prompts? Use tab, choose da choppa, then click. Boom, alex throws a fucking car at da choppa. And you can go off on your merry way, sprinting 90 degrees up buildings and what not.

I've skimmed through the comments and I think I've answered everything that I can...

If you don't know how to install a torrent, I suggest you either avoid torrents altogether, cause you probably don't wanna put in ANY effort (It's called google). It can get pretty hairy... I dont wanna tell you what I had to do to get my rig to run Fallout New Vegas... a good 3 hours on that and another 4 on Borderlands :S

Seeding now, chumps!"

,DopeShowVal,2012-05-05T19:13Z,"Just ignore all the people who are too stupid to understand that Prototype 2 isn't even released yet. If they cannot get that you can't crack a game without actually getting a copy of the game, them F em. 

This is another, working upload by a trusted source. DOn't be confused by the stupid people commenting about a completely different game in these comments, or people whining because they don't know how to use the files.

,juraj9,2012-05-13T19:16Z,"For all of those who are getting ""CRASH AFTER LOADING"" error - there are two solutions:

- click START - type MSCONFIG into search bar - click on Boot - Advanced Options - in Number of Processor you must set 1 (doesn't matter if you have dual-core or quad core), of course click Apply and OK....if this works for you and you will get error sometime later, repeat one of these solutions....dont forget to set it back (just uncheck Number of Processors field) when you uninstall the game.
.........or..........
- disable hyperthreading in BIOS

It's treated both as zip file AND ISO. mount it, instead and then install. Ignore the windows blah blah blah and directx or w/e its called. After you install, go back to where the file is now placed. Open your start menu, go to computer-> program files (x86)-> activision -> prototype. Here, you drag the file inside the ""crack"" folder from the torrent and drop it into the prototype file. replace the old application. done."
