,silvrmane,2009-10-25T01:11Z,"Someone stripped the mac installers out of this release, so for now, it's windows only. I'll keep seeding this but would like the mac installers as well."
[V],Murlok,2009-10-25T01:32Z,silvrmane  I take al ook and see what I can do
,Squeazer,2009-10-25T10:29Z,Works Great on my Windows 7 64bit installation! This is the best C4D 11.5 package I've seen out there! Great job uploader! 
,zeeowl,2009-10-25T20:40Z,"I would have happily seeded this for weeks too... been looking for it for a while... but without the Mac installers it's useless for me.  Oh well... will keep waiting for that to show up.  Meanwhile, I'll keep seeding Star Trek Yoyager. :D"
,frothingslos,2009-10-27T19:32Z,"Looks great!

Does it have Bodypaint as well? If so, what version?

Great Up Murlok!!"

,whitepony51,2009-10-31T13:05Z,Hi there. Concerning the serials numbers provided. Are they temporary supposed to be valid for 3 months or are they permanent ones? Thanx for the upload
,rathab,2009-11-04T09:28Z,seed seed guys
,rebel1,2009-11-05T19:00Z,"Thanks for this great torrent, works perfectly without any problems on Vista ultimate 64-bit. 

Nice1"
,silvrmane,2009-11-06T17:46Z,"As there are no Mac installers in this or the other torrent of this product, I tried installing it on my Mac via VMware and Parallels (latest versions of each). Software installs fine, but the zoom, pan, and rotation controls are messed up - they only go one direction, and way too fast. I then installed via BootCamp and it ran perfectly - everything functions as it should.

Anyone else have issues with this running under VMware Fusion or Parallels?"
,ohfoohy,2009-11-06T23:43Z,"I'm confused, is the ""Serial_Readme"" permanent serials or are they just 3 months?"
,sparklife,2009-11-07T10:14Z,"Hello there, im new to this so bear with me please :)   i dl the torrent and when i try to open it it tries to open it up in photo shop cs3. Do i need to dl something to open it up with or what am i doing wrong? Ty for the DL btw, hope to start using it soon :P"

I felt pity for you... having to use Windows to run the latest and greatest Cinema 4D. :P  So here's my present to you (and to myself). :D

,zeeowl,2009-11-16T02:31Z,"@LightSpeedNox
You can get those from Serial Box - Nov 2009.  Or if you don't have access to a Mac, download just the Serialz.txt file from my torrent.  The whole set for 11.5 is in there.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5162952

I don't want to post them in the forum because then they can be Googled and blacklisted by Maxon in the next update."

net render"
,snowrabbit,2011-01-02T19:13Z,"Murlok thanks alot!


This is how I did it, and it works fine and all serials are OK! 

-Extract

-Lanch setup.exe and install CINEMA 4D (inc body...) 

-Once again, launch setup.exe, pick only the NET RENDER CLIET with all modules and install.

-Then go to your MAXON folder and open the NET.... folder, open the modules, copy the files and paste em in your C4D/Modules folder.

-Launch your C4D and enter all serials, OK

Done!"
