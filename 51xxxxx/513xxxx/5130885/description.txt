--About Roman--
Johan Helmich Roman (26 October 1694 in Stockholm - 20 November 1758 at HaraldsmÃ¥la, in the parish of Ryssby near the city of Kalmar, Sweden) was a Swedish Baroque composer. He has been called "the father of Swedish music", "the Swedish HÃ¤ndel" and the "Inovator and reformer of Swedish Church Music".

Roman spent six years (1715-1721) in London and there studied with Johann Christoph Pepusch and met Francesco Geminiani and the great HÃ¤ndel whose music he admired. Roman returned to Sweden at the age of 27 and was appointed Deputy Master and six years later became Chief Master at the Swedish Royal Orchestra. Aside from being a composer, he was a performer. The violin and oboe were his favorite instruments.

--The Swedish Mass (Then Svenska Messan)-- 
It is easy to hear HÃ¤ndel's influence upon Roman in this piece. The mass was first performed in 1752 at Ekeblad residence in Stockholm by the Royal Court Orchestra and Adolf Fredrik's private orchestra, bolstered by cantors from the churches of Stockholm and oboists from the military guards along with as many competetant amatuers as could be engaged. This was Roman's last large work for orchestra and choir.

This version is sung in the original Swedish and was recorded over two concerts during October 1983 in the Alfred Fredrik Church, Stockholm. It features the 'Alfred Fredrik Bach Choir' and the 'Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble' and three outstanding Swedish soloists (Mikael Samuelson: Baritone, Anne-Sofie von Otter: Mezzo-soprano, Hillevi Martinpelto: Soprano) - Conducted by Anders Ã–hrwall.
