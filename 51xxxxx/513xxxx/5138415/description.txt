Pulp are an English alternative rock band formed in Sheffield in 1978. Upon their split in 2002, their lineup consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Mark Webber (guitar), Steve Mackey (bass) and Nick Banks (drums).

Throughout the 1980s, the band struggled to find success but gained prominence in the UK in the 1990s after the release of the albums His 'n' Hers in 1994 and Different Class in 1995, which both reached number one spot in the UK Albums Chart. Pulp's musical style in this successful era consisted of disco influenced pop-rock coupled with "kitchen sink drama"-style lyrics. This period of success led to the band and frontman Jarvis Cocker becoming major figures in the Britpop movement in the mid-1990s and also to two nominations for the Mercury Music Prize; in 1994 for His 'n' Hers and a Mercury Music Prize win in 1996 for Different Class. Their 1995 single "Common People" reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Later in 1995, they headlined the Pyramid Stage of the Glastonbury Festival. After their last album We Love Life in 2001, the band entered an extended hiatus. As of October 2003, Pulp had sold over 10 million records.
