All of your BRRips are beautiful. Thanks!"
,Maxstats69,2009-10-26T21:34Z,"This says it works on the xbox 360. But then in the files listed it shows a file for how to change the audio channels for it to work on the 360. Do I have to do anything to this to make it compatible with the 360 or will the mp4 automatically work on the 360 when I download it?

Sorry if this is a dumb question or has been answered before I just don't want to download it if I have to do a bunch of converting for it to work. Thanks in advance...."

just one question. i used that yamb program for it to work on my xbox 360 but when it finishes its not an mp4 or anything its just a file. then i burned it to a disc and said mixed media disc in my xbox.
CAN U TELL ME WHAT I DID WRONG??"
,MeatTycoon,2009-10-30T00:59Z,"The quality is amazing and perfect. Thanks a lot, SecretMyth, and may your enthusiasm for providing us with the best rips possible never cease!

Oh, and by the way, I'm registered on kingdom-kvcd.net, but that forum is VERY hard to navigate, so I prefer to get your torrents from here."
