Plot Summary:

September 1914, news reaches the colony German Eastern Africa
that its motherland is at war, so Reverend Samuel Sayer became
a hostile foreigner; German imperial troops burn down his mission,
driving him mad- shortly after his well-educated, snooty sister
Rose Sayer buries him and leaves by the only available transport,
the crummy river steamboat 'African Queen' of grumpy boorish 
compatriot Charlie Allnut. As if a long difficult journey without
any comfort weren't bad enough for such odd companions, she is
determined to find a way to do their bit for the British war effort
(and revenge her brother) and aims high as God is obviously on their
side: construct their own equipment, a torpedo and the converted
steamboat, to take out a huge German warship, the Louisa, which is
hard to find on the giant lake and first of all to reach, in fact as
daunting an expedition as nobody attempted since the late adventurous
explorer John Speakes, but she presses till Charlie accepts to steam
up the Ulana, about to brave a German fort, raging rapids, very
bloodthirsty parasites and the endlessly branching stream which seems
to go nowhere but impenetrable swamps... Despite fierce rows and moral
antagonism between a bossy devout abstentionist and a free-spirited
libertine drunk loner, the two bachelors grow closer to each-other as 
their quest drags on...
