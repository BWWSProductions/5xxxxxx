At the end of Raven Court, a side road in small town Massachusetts, sits an old cottage under an even older oak tree. Children riding bikes pedal double-fast to race by this house, and none dare knock on the door for Halloween treats!

3 Raven Court is a spooky scene that includes a house, ground, fence and walkway. This product can be used on its own or combine it with Lisa Botanicals - Raven's Rest to complete the atmosphere and create a perfect setting for your moody renders!

Textures consist of detailed diffusion (texture), bump, displacement and transparency maps. Poser version loads in with maps applied, DAZ Studio version includes DS materials and a full scene file. Optimized for DAZ Studio and Poser.
