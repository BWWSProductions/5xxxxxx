,htonyc,2009-12-12T02:13Z,"Thanks for your work on the Bleach torrents. Amazing!
Discovered Bleach about 2 months ago and love it.
Question - Episode numbering seems messed somehow - I have season 7 ending at #151, and season 8 up to #167, then season 9 starting at #190...
I seem to be missing episodes #168-189..

not a problem, I will figure out where they are - just wanted you to know

Again thanks for this - Bleach has it all - humor, action - it has taken on a whole ""epic"" type feel.
Love to see Hollywood make this into a live action movie"
