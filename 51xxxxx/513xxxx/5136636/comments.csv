Thanks! +1"
,Smorgan,2009-10-26T22:46Z,Out of plain curiosity how did you get rid of the pop ups since I made a try at this method.
,Smorgan,2009-10-26T23:09Z,cause I probably did try this first I'm just curious and this question is not directed at anyone else but just you cause I keep on getting pop-ups after I make the registry change.  I'm not pissed I just want to know.

Maybe it's better you go to ask on Hazar's Forum, he should know what this thingie is doing..."

,csstechie,2009-11-18T01:32Z,This is for real? Is it for 32bit? Has anyone had any trouble with this?
,myke6000,2009-11-26T22:13Z,"Works.

I ran on 2 computers.  Both 32bit Windows7 Ultimate. Run the program in windows, It left all my firefox windows open too. 

The laptop had the windows is not valid, expired after 30days message, and this cleared up those messages (run crack, then 1 reboot). 

Great Program!"
