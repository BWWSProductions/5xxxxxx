Tom Tom 6 - with Australian Maps
(For Windows Mobile 5 & 6)

For Devices:
MITAC MIO A701
MITAC MIO A702

MIO have stopped supporting the A701 & A702 which pissed me off becuase there is a bug in the 
MIO MAP V3.3 GPS software - It does not recognise the new section of EASTLINK.

Because MITAC MIO will never fix this bug or offer newer Maps, I was forced to find another GPS program.
After weeks of searching the Torrents I found a few files and combined them into thisworking
collection.

Although the Maps are old, atleast it works 100%, now all we need is someone to upload New TomTom maps
specific to Pocket PC, (For Windows Mobile 5 & 6).

TomTom 6 was installed & testedworking on my MIO A702.
