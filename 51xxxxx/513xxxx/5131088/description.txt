This is Legend of Mana converted to an eboot.pbp for use with the PSP

I've added a background, custom icon, and Video Icon.

Copy folder containing eboot.pbp into the "games" directory of your PSP.
Only works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.

Enjoy!!

If anyone has any problems with the game, or if you want to request a game for upload, you can E-Mail me at iammrfrank@gmail.com
