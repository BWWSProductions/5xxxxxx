Longtime friendships are put to the ultimate test when a dying woman summons her best friends from college into the wilderness for a four day camping trip, and everyone quickly discovers that they havenâ€™t exactly been told the whole truth about her current condition. Lucy (Missi Pyle) has always been obese, and now that her health has taken a turn for the worse, she wants to spend her last days with the estranged college social group who helped her through one of the most difficult periods of her entire life. Upon learning that Lucy is on her deathbed, her loyal friends all rush to Montana in order to be by her side for one last weekend together. Immediately upon arriving, however, itâ€™s glaringly obvious to all of Lucyâ€™s friends that something isnâ€™t right. Her condition is a far cry from what she made it out to be in her desperate messages, and as tensions begin to rise Lucy realizes that the people standing before her today simply arenâ€™t the same people who she remembered so fondly from college. With no modern conveniences to fall back on as the reunited group begins an arduous four-day hike into the wilderness, everyoneâ€™s deepest fears and demons gradually claw their way to the surface, leaving Lucy to wonder whether her â€œfinal wishâ€ was truly the brilliant idea she initially thought it to be.
