,joshysquashy,2009-10-27T23:05Z,Has anyone managed to grab this yet? Is this upload real? Perhaps someone else could seed it for us?
,SirCrow,2009-10-27T23:37Z,"Yes it's real and works fine, 'm seeding ;)"
,modelcitizen,2009-10-27T23:49Z,"Thanks onefish, I'd appreciate an upload of just the keygen tho"
,hemu2712,2009-10-27T23:50Z,"Awesome Release, I will Seed Now. Thanks For Upload."
,onefish2,2009-10-28T00:51Z,Very nice.
,hemu2712,2009-10-28T02:00Z,"Hi Onefish, I just installed this application but it's not 64 bit but the original one is 64 bit. Can you please make sure."
,ScreamingDeath,2009-10-28T02:39Z,Program works as promised! I still don't get difference between this and 2.0.6 though except windows 7 compatible?
,jb510,2009-10-28T05:40Z,Thanks...  curious though why you would bundle the two dmg's together in a zip file so we can't download just the keygen...  since anyone could easily download Fusion 3 build 204229 directly from VM Ware right now?
,Inidra,2009-10-28T05:46Z,"Can't get keymaker to work... starts, but hangs - can someone pls grab the serial."
,miknos,2009-10-28T06:27Z,Thanks for sharing. I downloaded the trial waiting for the serial to arrive here in TPB. Can someone post the serial so I don't have to download it again?
,onefish2,2009-10-28T06:35Z,Wow. So many nice comments. Thanks. Next time go find the Keygen yourself. It does not pay to do something nice and share.
,miknos,2009-10-28T07:51Z,"onefish2,

At this time the torrent has more than 2500 known downloads. From all that, ONLY 3 are asking for the keygen instead (and not complaining). In my case because I already downloaded from vmware's website.

I have no doubt that (practically) everyone is very please with your upload, including me.

Again thank you."
,miknos,2009-10-28T08:00Z,"@hemu2712,

The application IS 64bit. Check under ALL PROCESSES for vmware-vmx.

,SirCrow,2009-10-28T08:46Z,"Uuhhhm deleted my own Light Version, now it looks that VMware has removed it from there site.

Some know where i can get VMware Fusion 3 Light again?

TIA"
,mordors9,2009-10-28T12:47Z,Thanks onefish2. Great up. App and keygen both seem to work as expected.

,SirCrow,2009-10-28T19:56Z,"
Thanks Packhater :)

Uninstalled and installed the light version :)

But still got the menu option ""Install McAfee VirusScan Plus"" under the ""Virtual Machine"" pulldown, thought that the light version is without McAfee? :("
,onefish2,2009-10-29T14:34Z,wad11656 - I do not see a setting to do that in 10.5.8.
,dynamitesteel,2009-10-29T20:08Z,Totally real... seeding too. Thanks dude keep up the great uploads!
,Archaon59,2009-10-30T23:25Z,Thanks a lot !
,pcorlatan,2009-11-08T05:22Z,Works flawlessly with my unibody MB running snow leopard
,takasta,2009-11-08T08:13Z,"works great, does anyone know how I can get a copy of windows and install it onto the mac? or do i have to use an original disc, ie. xp?"
,james2009,2009-11-08T13:14Z,"works well!
I tried it with XP and Windows 7... I think I'm going to use the XP one, it's way faster.

I'm waiting to try The Sims 3 on it.. will let ya all know."

,DutchBayer,2009-11-16T23:10Z,Smooth download and very easy to setup. The complimentary MacAffee 12 month subscription is awesome too lol. Thx for the torrent onefish2
,DutchBayer,2009-11-16T23:13Z,"@takasta 

Torrent a nice version of windows 7 or xp. Burn the .iso onto a cd/dvd using the Disk Utility. Then just use bootcamp to install windwows and you can use VMware fusion if u want to run both OS at the same time. Windows 7 and mac OS X dont run smooth with VMware though...I have a 4gb ram 24' Imac."
