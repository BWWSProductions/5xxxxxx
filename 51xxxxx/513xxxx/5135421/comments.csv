Thanks!"
[T],bogart55,2009-10-26T19:22Z,"first of all its the complete op 97 arcduke  ,and ghost op 70 no1  trios ,i thought the arcduke and ghost trios where so much better than the work piano trio in e-flat WoO 38,so thats why i decided not to include them in the torrent and thats why tracks 5,6,7 are missing,

thanks for your comment of the torrent"
