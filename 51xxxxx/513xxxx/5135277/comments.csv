,raidendude,2009-10-31T14:41Z,"This does not work on windows 7...When trying to run Age Of Empires 2 (The regular, not the expansion)It says that i do not have the cd inserted.I do have the iso mounted, and i've tried the crack.When i try to run Age Of Empires 2 The Conquerors, it pops up an error window that doesn't say anything...I've tried every compability mode and run as administrator on both of them, and cracks, and fixes...To no use.I'm going to download another age of empires 2 torrent and if that doesn't work either, i'll know that something is wrong on my side.I'll comment when i've tried it."

,GLR457mAn,2009-11-01T18:58Z,raidendude.  **its a must that you install the patch for aoe2 it before installing aoe2 expansion.** then once the expansion is installed then patch it with age2_x1.exe then copy over the expansion crack. i have windows xp/vista/& 7 (yes i have 3 pc's) & it works just fine for me on all 3 os's.
,GLR457mAn,2009-11-01T19:03Z,"
as said in the Aoe2 and expansion install plz read 1st.txt

*please note that i **havent tested the (crack.rar)** mostly ppl play the ""expansion"" on gameranger. if the crack doesnt
work for aoe2 (not expansion) or on gameranger then google for age of empire2 2.0a crack its not to hard to find. (or try renaming the crack.exe)
 too  empires2.EXE and see if that works on gameranger. the crack.rar is for aoe2 not the expanson.  use the age2_x1crack.rar for the expansion."
,DeathStrack,2009-12-06T16:40Z,nice i love this series but what i really love is the first one it has that certain thing to it that makes me love it anyone find one with a no cd crack?
,GLR457mAn,2009-12-06T20:11Z,well sence ive posted this torrent ive seen like 30 + 40 new ppl out of 800+ ppl that has downloaded this. good job ppl on playing @ gameranger & make even more game rooms for this game to play ppl with ;-)
,RogueDragon,2009-12-08T00:34Z,"ok i just downloaded this onto my comp i think it may have something to do with the patches but im not sure but im still getting the ""i need to insert disc"" when i try to start up that game"
,KoRe401,2009-12-12T19:57Z,"I am getting the same error, ""please insert the cd-rom"" can someone help with this please?"
,GLR457mAn,2009-12-20T18:33Z,"try reinstalling & read the instructions closely as your installing the game/patchs/cracks.

when i said *please note that i **havent tested the (crack.rar)** its a misstype i made 2 times. sorry guys/gals it supose to say............

*please note that i **havent tested the (Aoe2crack.rar)**    

again im very sorry for that misstype but what that means is thats for the aoe2 game/disk.. not the aoe2expansion game/disk.... & has not been tested by me.

i know for sure the the expansion crack works but for the orig game aoe2 i dont know if thats working & you might want to google it with the patch ver you applyed & or you can try gamecopyworld.com cd cracks as well. but again make very sure that the no cd cracks are for the patch ver. included in this torrent."
,ShadPriest88,2009-12-21T05:08Z,"hi GLR im confused at step 5 where it says put the crack at age2_x1, which file is the crack? sorry i am noob..."
,Spillsasher,2009-12-22T16:04Z,When i am installing it seems to get stuck at the Lbrite.ttf file. Wtf?
,matshoot,2009-12-24T21:38Z,"HELP PLEASE!
ive got a problem, i installed the game and had no problems and i put the crack in the right map and i ran aoe 2. It worked fine but when i try to start a campain mission or a deathmatch or something it says it cant load the data or something :("
,fr0wningf0x,2009-12-26T00:12Z,"I have everything downloaded successfully. If you guys are having trouble opening files then you may need WinRar32 or PowerISO or an other ISO mounter program thing...

Here's what I did using PowerISO

NOTE: You need to have WinRar32 in order to open the .rar files in order to try this.

1) Create a new file on your desktop to download AOEII to. Rename it to something like ""AoE Download"" or ""AoE Extracted"" so you know where it is later on.

2) Go to where you dl'd torrent. Right click the AOEII folder and click ""open with PowerISO"". (Don't bother registering product). Then click on the Mount tab and select 2 drives (one for AOEII and the other for AOEII the Conquerors Expansion). Then select mount again and mount AoE II to the first drive.

3. Open 'My Computer' and look for the drive where you mounted it. It should say something like AOE2 (F:) or whatever letter. Then click on it to install. Install it to your desktop AOE folder that you made earlier. MAKE SURE YOU SELECT FULL INSTALL. 

4. Go back to the AOE patches and cracks folder and open the ""ageofempires2 patchs"" folder and run the ""Age2upA.exe"" file.

5. Go back to AOEII the Conquerors Expansion Folder and mount it on the second drive you set up with PowerISO as you did with the first one.

6. Run the full install. Make sure its installed to the file you made on your desktop. 

7. Go back to the ""ageofempire2patchs"" folder and run ""Age2XPatch.exe"" 

8. Follow the rest of the Read Me directions provided in the download and you should be fine.

About the multiplayer set-up, I have no idea how to set this up. I have all the files downloaded and GameRanger installed properly. I just can't connect to firends with the cracked version. Can anyone help me out?"
,W427,2010-01-13T08:54Z,i have followed all the instructions and the expansion works but when i crack the empires2 it does it then when i go to open it it says empires2 has stopped working??? im not to good with computers... and its really shitting me! can some one help me out?
,l1_Sick_1l,2010-01-14T01:28Z,"when i try playing the game it says to insert the disc and retry
I'm using an iso mounting program

I was a little confused on step 5 on what file i was suppose to place where"
,TheBll,2010-01-16T21:59Z,hm nice but wasn't there a soundtrack in the game? or its cause it was on the other track of the audio/data cd mix? :(
,Afgandhi,2010-01-23T03:23Z,does it work online?
,James1613,2010-02-04T22:01Z,"Thanks man.

FYI to all others the cd for AOE II age of the kings is broken. You will have to download another one "

,netino,2010-02-21T08:30Z,"ok, DLed fine, installed, kinda fine had to get a no-cd fixed elsewhere, now both games work on 1p, i tried going online with just the AOK on gameranger and everything works fine until the host launches the game then as soon as the countdown starts i get an error saying windows needs to close AOE, am i doing something wrong? thanks"

,Aemilius_Paulus,2010-04-18T03:44Z,"Does this copy of AoEII have the music? Most pirated copies of AoEII usually don't, for some reason..."
,Eitjes,2010-05-14T10:21Z,"I have windows xp home edition and the included crack does not work with me. (Aoe2crack.rar) 
So as told in de 'read me' i looked for an other crack. 
And i found a website where you can download a working crack and a 'No CD' crack! 
So you dont have to mount the iso before playing. I only tested it on windows xp, 
so i dont know if it will work on windows vista or 7.

,A_Dog,2010-06-06T11:52Z,"I have a problem with this download. Whenever I would play the game, a stupid new age bull (Track 2: thinking your way to success...) plays instead of the game sounds and it doesn't end or I have not had the patience to wait and suffer listening to that bull. Does anyone have this same problem? Does anyone know how to fix it?"
,A_Dog,2010-06-06T14:07Z,Help! Somebody please help. Please look at my problem (written above). That damn new age crap is driving me nuts and I can't even turn it off completely (unless I turn of the speakers).
,A_Dog,2010-06-09T15:08Z,"I have figured out why that stupid new age bull was playing. You have to delete the file - DPLAY61A. I have sounds, but no music. Sucks. But better than none. As for the crack for age of empires 2 (not expansion), you need to get some other copy. That said, however, I did try playing opening the expansion and age of empires 2 works there, so no need to download an age of empires 2 crack, just make sure you enter the game through aoe2 expansion."
,YamanaiAme,2010-06-11T09:08Z,"Great stuff.
I downloaded, patched everything, and it worked with no problems on Win 7 X64.

I didnt played it yet but i have no doubt that its working."
,A_Dog,2010-06-11T16:31Z,I spoke too soon. That stupid new age bull is back. Does anybody know how to get rid of it?
,A_Dog,2010-06-11T16:38Z,I am bursting in anger. Help!
,YamanaiAme,2010-06-11T23:31Z,"I know about the bull you talking about, but in this version there is no bull.
Didnt see it here.
Also im pretty sure this iso made from the original game, because the instalation is official."
,A_Dog,2010-06-12T18:38Z,Sh!t! How do I get rid of that new age bull?
,A_Dog,2010-06-12T19:00Z,"So, how do I get rid of this bull? 
I already uninstalled and reinstalled so many times. I also downloaded 2 other copies, all with this bull. Angry here.
Do you know what the file name is?"

,waterbbq,2010-07-19T10:20Z,The owner puts in a trojan named mythxpak.exe in this torrent. he also deletes any post that says theres a trojan. this guy is a crook.
,habydlg,2010-08-02T18:36Z,the music is a file that needs the cd to be read because its not made to be installed in the game because before they wanted to make them as small as possible (10 years ago).. thats why most dont have music or movies
,Dutch-Down,2010-08-08T18:59Z,"Nice download speed and a nice torrent.
The readme file is very handy and you really should follow it to install the game right. 

But i have a problem:

I copied the crack to where I installed the game. I runned it and i tried to start: Age of Empires II. (Not the expansion) But i get an error. 

Can someone help me??"
,darkbeard,2010-08-16T04:32Z,this torrent installs some unnecessary movie files That take up a lot of space during installation i just deleted them.
