Marillion - Recital of the Script


Mark Eglinton from The Quietus comments:

Recorded at the then Hammersmith Odeon in April 1983, Recital of the Script is an excellent quality rendition of the band's first album Script for a Jester's Tear with a couple of B-sides from that era thrown in for good measure. Split into two discs due to the length of some tracks - 'The Web' alone accounting for twelve minutes - it's the start of what would become the band's heyday and Fish himself deems this to be one of their finest shows, according to interesting 'sleeve-notes' updated for this release. What shone through too, even at this early stage, was the singer's theatrical and almost mythical persona on stage, and fans of the band would soon be hanging on his every uttered word.
