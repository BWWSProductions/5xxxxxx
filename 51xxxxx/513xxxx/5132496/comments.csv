,Ooame,2009-10-22T15:48Z,This is probably one of the best films i have seen all year. I couldn't find it anywhere on the net so i thought i'd share.  My upload speed ain't that good but ill keep it running for as long as possible
,nerd707,2009-10-24T00:10Z,"EVERYONE ON THE PLANET NEEDS TO SEE THIS FILM! 

Saw it at Fantastic Fest in Austin and it blew me away. 4 hours of pure perfection!!!"
,zato1,2009-10-25T04:24Z,"Um, just started watching and the subs are coming up as numbers... like timer or something. What'sUpWitDAt?"
,zato1,2009-10-25T06:46Z,"Strange, subs won't play in VLC for me but work fine in mplayer. Thanks again, this movie is awesome!!!"
,scv42,2009-11-30T11:48Z,"Great that there's a post here.  Now the real question: Does anyone have an actual DVDR version (DL or SL) with English Subs?  This should not be tagged as DVDR. VCD maybe, not DVDR."
,Truvbay,2010-01-08T04:57Z,"Good quality, dumb movie. If you are one of those losers who think jap=good, than you'll enjoy this. If not, it's just artsy crap not worth your time."
,cUNDra69,2010-02-18T01:23Z,Thank you!
,tomh34th,2010-03-04T06:35Z,"The problem with the subtitles is that there are full stops instead of commas in the timecode. Some players can't parse that correctly. It's easy to fix by yourself with some regex, or you can get my fixed ones here: http://subscene.com/english/Love-Exposure-Ai-no-mukidashi/subtitle-307638.aspx"
