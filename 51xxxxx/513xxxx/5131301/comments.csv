felt the need to mention: this song is NOT from the original album departure. the album was re-released as 'departure: recharged' as this song came out quite a while after the album. i have the original departure album and this song is not on it."

btw, what I meant was, I don't know for sure from what album the version with T-Pain was taken (or if it was released as a single). But I know the ORIGINAL version is in ""Departure"".
In any case, ENJOY!"
