,Th3_Raging_Bull,2009-11-06T09:35Z,"This is going to take a while.....
"
,DarkOrbitDeathPilot,2009-11-09T01:27Z,Im 2 days into the d/l and at 50 %. bandwidth comes and goes as to be expected. thx for the upload bone and i will seed until ratio hits 2x
,camarorachel,2009-11-13T16:26Z,"Thanks so much. Download took a very short time, only overnight."
,vinzone,2009-11-27T07:59Z,"This is my torrent from mininova,
Season 1-6 are DvDRIP, Season 7 Ep. 1-9 are DvD also. The end of season 7 is PDTV as well as the 3 episodes from season 8.
Oh yeah and I forgot to replace S06E09 - Back To Woods so that is a PDTV rip as well, sorry.
Anyway hope everyone enjoys and keeps this seeded!"
,TireSlap,2009-12-07T12:35Z,"Sweet torrent BONE, the ratio is still in the leechers favor, as is the download progress.  Right now im seeding @ unlimited, can i ask that everyone else do the same, after all, we are all here to share.  =)
Thanks for the uppy BONE"
,partykid,2009-12-24T16:26Z,"@tireslap. you shouldnt put your upload to unlimited. 80% of total capacity should be used, 100% capacity use will slow your dowload because the program will have no overhead to recieve communications from other computers or the trackers. it will also crush your web surfing ability.

and i know the question has been answered but when you ask about source why would you ask which station aired it(fox adult swim) that makes no difference, it is the medium that matters (hdtv, dvd, bluray, ts, ect.) 

and who uses divx anymore. xvid all the way baby.

i realize this is a lot of griping "
,acidr3flux,2009-12-29T05:31Z,"lol @ party kid

Thanks for this one Bone. I'll be downloading this one instead of your earlier FG release. Thnx"
,oversoul53,2009-12-29T08:52Z,"ok, here's an update for those of you who don't know yet, I'm currently downloading this torrent to put it on my ps3 and I noticed it also contains the episodes form Season 8, so BONE, just a suggestion, I'm not complaining cuz I LOVE what you've done, but u MIGHT wanna change the name of yur torrent to ""Family Guy complete collection seasons 1-8 (full)"" and fyi, u don't have to put ""+ movie + blue harvest"" in there, cuz the ""movie"" is just the last 3 episodes of season 4 smashed together and blue harvest is the first episode of season 6. otherwise, GREAT JOB! and MUCH appreciated! now, we need more seeders though, this takes literally all night to download.  "
,oversoul53,2009-12-30T04:17Z,"guys I HATE to bitch and moan, but this morning bit torrent said i have approx a day left on this download and it was at like 30%, now it says 2 days and it's only at 39% and it's not moving, it's like dwnldg at 66kb per sec. what the hell happened to all the seeders!? am i seriously gunna have to go download each season separately? -_-"
,Reshy,2010-01-11T06:11Z,"I try to download the torrent (actually any torrent for the record) and it says I can't connect to the server, etc. etc. etc.

wtf? I'm getting annoyed and concerned considering I use the website ALL THE TIME."

,ToTheGrind,2010-02-27T16:23Z,@stnerrothcraes 200mbs per sec (1gb per 5 secs)? well that would take about a minute and a half to download 20gb so lol. and if you meant 200kbps it would take considerably more then 30 mins to download this so gj with your bullshit
