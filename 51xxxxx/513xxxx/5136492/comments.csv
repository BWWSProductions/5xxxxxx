,L0xias,2011-02-16T18:20Z,"Poor bitrate! I only download 1 albums and The Early Years, but they both were 128 kbps."
[V],thethingy,2011-02-17T10:34Z,"L0xias, albums are not 128"
,chandlerboy,2011-03-26T19:17Z,"Lazy upload. Files not tagged, no album art... thanks for making every one else do the work."
,scoopnohlee,2011-03-26T23:44Z,haha yeah @chandlerboy  I know what you mean.  I can't believe these people upload torrents like this.  Just goes to show that this guy doesn't take pride in what he does:)
,camplex,2011-04-01T03:03Z,"Doesn't take pride...? Do you clowns see the little green skull? You don't go to thethingy for music and movies. He was just kind enough to share something he had. You go to thethingy if you want badass software that works EVERYTIME. period. 

THX for all of your work thethingy, these idiots aren't on your level."
,lestatvvvvvv,2011-05-21T04:25Z,"and for those bitching that theres no artwork , you are looking at the singles , the albums are all separated . Also when you download music , do you do it for the artwork or for the music? 
Infact quit bitching, look at the price your paying for any of it, if you dont like it here goto your local best buy an try to find it ."
,Steror,2011-05-22T22:54Z,"I completely agree with Camplex, we're here for music, not for some fucking artwork..."
[T],theLEAK,2011-06-05T15:06Z,Nice!
,CommanderKittenFace,2011-06-23T16:45Z,"If it wasn't for thethingy, I wouldn't be the same person I am today. He supplies great, expensive, and hard to find stuff. How are you to judge his work, when you haven't yet to even upload a single torrent? Seriously, you're inconsiderate."
,StvnWilsn,2011-07-03T20:11Z,man where are those 320 KBPS  rips!!
