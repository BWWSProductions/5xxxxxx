,Ordeal,2009-10-22T19:07Z,"I agree, this game is actually quite nice, despite its simplicity.. Quite addictive too I might add :P

Thanks for the up Groo :)"
,leprechaun91,2009-10-22T19:55Z,"Virus? Hell yeah, Norton removes the file as soon as I unrar it. I t tells me it's a trojan; I don't feel comfortable ignoring that, I have a completely new computer..

Can someone tell me why Norton would tell me that a file that isn't a trojan gets warned as one? I need some reassurance or whatever, thanks a bunch."
,phnw123,2009-10-22T21:18Z,"Dear leprechaun, wikipedia says:

""False positives

If an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files (or does this by default), false positives in essential files can render the operating system or some applications unusable.[21]

Heuristic analysis can also detect safe programs as malware if the programs in question use certain functions such as accessing the screen directly; mainly keygens and some modern games suffer from this, as they use keyboard hooks the antivirus program automatically associates with keyloggers (keygens are also often scanned for their serial number generation algorithms as a form of copyright-enforcement).""

This torrent is a sack of gold :)"
,Vonzom,2009-10-23T01:53Z,"THIS GAME IS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!!!

YOU ROCK GROO!"
,kraziaznvtboi,2009-10-24T03:33Z,"Amazing and 100% Working and Clean!

Thanks Groo!"
,alien00785,2009-10-24T18:59Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT

I found a Trojan Horse inside when i extracted the files."
,sc10n,2009-10-24T21:17Z,omg. now you have to find your brain somewhere and start using it.
,sherwelbuilding,2009-10-25T05:48Z,"leprechaun, its because norton is a virus itself."
,jimmyjoe21,2009-10-25T19:07Z,"this is an awesome game that i didn't think anybody would crack. but i was wrong and its on the one and only pirate bay!

great job guys, works perfectly."
,kraziaznvtboi,2009-10-31T08:10Z,"Boohoo your AV is detecting a virus on a torrent. There's no fucking logic in that. It's like asking a cop to safeguard your bud.

My God, you people are such babies so that every time you risk getting a boo boo or virus you complain and bitch. It's a fucking torrent site, what the hell do you expect?

Honestly, grow the fuck up and learn to take risks. Or are you still waiting for mommy to come and hold your hand?"
,XxOblvionxX,2009-11-01T12:30Z,it crashes when i start game.......it loads then crashes :(
,hoper7,2009-11-11T21:55Z,"dont download this, this piecie of shit is not working for 90% of people"
,Aurella,2009-11-17T18:09Z,"works perfect,installed 1 part and the 2nd part on the same location where 1st part was installed....also you need net framework installed...good luck.."
,dikimwar,2009-11-20T22:05Z,"I use Avira Antivir, it said it had a trojan. ( it is a false positive )

Installed it anyway and it works perfect!
Thank you very much for uploading!

For those who have problems installing : Try running the setup as administrator ( vista )"
,mdk504,2009-11-30T00:13Z,game works fine on win7. not a single hiccup here.
,KaworuIIDX,2009-12-15T03:51Z,"The game is great
The torrent is great
If you get a false positive, get a better antivirus

I had a bug with the fonts that makes them unreadable, it's a known issue with Intel Integrated Cards and some other, I fixed my problem patching to version 2.02 here http://www.dyson-game.com/files/PatchEufloria.exe

Hope it help someone else"
,oxymoronic,2010-01-08T06:32Z,"eufloria.part2.rar wont open with 7zip.  It tells me the file is broken anyone else have the problem, or is it on my end.  I'm on windows 7 if that makes a difference."
,zarathustra2k1,2010-01-26T07:17Z,"What a beautiful little game. Just completed the demo on Steam & hadda have it NOW!

Many thanx for the up! =]"
,Dunbal,2010-02-22T19:02Z,"Remember this is an indie game - if you like it, you can buy it for just $20"
,natchos,2010-04-13T16:50Z,"Guys the fact that the game doesn't crash doesn't mean it doesn't contain a virus. This specific virus is specialized on
A; Dropping harmful files in your comp
B; Monitoring broadband content
This file IS harmful. The game itself is not affected tho.
And WTF kraziazn? Just because we are downloading a torrent doesn't mean we have to fucking accept getting a fucking harmful virus you fucking asshole. Either post a helpful comment or don't comment at all you fucking fucktard."
,jkwq,2010-04-30T06:09Z,"@natchos - i think the real fucktard is u.

y r u here in te first place?"
,Wham666,2010-06-12T11:17Z,"Working perfectly, no trojan detected with avast.
Thanks for the release guys !"
,Minee22,2010-07-12T00:34Z,"Several things, Just because it is a torrent doesn\'t mean it has to have a virus. Or you should have to take a risk. If you find a virus thanx for telling everyone but if the uploader is a trusted person then it is most likely a false pos. And for the people that wine and bitch about someone asking a question, stop blowing ur dog and get out of the house and talk to someone like that in real life bunch of pussies. nAs for the download i didn\'t need the second zip to have it work and I am running 7."
,n3ptun0,2010-08-11T01:15Z,Thanks for torrent!
,Sasukhai,2010-08-29T05:42Z,@KaworuIIDX: Thanx for the heads-up. i also had the problem with the fonts. it's now solved thanx to you
