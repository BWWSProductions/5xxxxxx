,iklsjicbryanharley,2009-10-28T01:57Z,Quattrox this is a wave 4 game you need to burn the activate iso which you can find with a quick google search and then burn it to a dual layer disk but only on the first layer and use imgburn it is the easiest way. hope i helped 
,iklsjicbryanharley,2009-10-28T01:59Z,then put it in the xbox everytime before you play a wave 4 game and wait for it to say play dvd then eject and put tekken 6 in and it should play perfectly fine.
