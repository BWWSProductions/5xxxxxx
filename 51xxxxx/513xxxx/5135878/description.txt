True Romance 1993 was a great film written by the brilliant Quentin Tarantino. The original movie was directed by Tony Scott and shot in linear order, going against Tarantinoâ€™s script. He did this thinking the audience would understand the film better. (He didnâ€™t take a chance) Scott also cut out many additional scenes. 
The Original is still a great film with an amazing cast: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport and James Gandolfini. But True Romance: The Tarantino Cut has the movie edited out of sequence the way Tarantino had intended. It adds in the deleted scenes that now make perfect sense to the film edited in this manner. This new edit made a great film EVEN BETER! I include the Original Directors cut of the True Romance in this download as well simply so you can compare the two endings. The Tarantino Cut offers a new, never before seen ending. Although I love the Tarantino cut much more than the original film cut, the original ending I like better, and I think really defines â€œTrue Romanceâ€ But You Decide and ENJOY.
