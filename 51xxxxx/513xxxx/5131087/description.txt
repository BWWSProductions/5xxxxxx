The Muppet Movie (1979)

Story of a frog, a bear and a pig (portraying themselves are Kermit the Frog, Fozzie the Bear and Miss Piggy) on the road to Hollywood. 
Kermit claims it is "approximately" the way the Muppets began. 
While on their nationwide trek, they encounter Doc Hopper who plans to make Kermit his spokesman for his Frog Leg restaurant chain. 

This is the Muppet characters' first outing in the movies features cameos from Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthy), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles.
