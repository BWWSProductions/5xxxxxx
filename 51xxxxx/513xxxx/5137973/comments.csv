,hornitos1,2009-11-08T23:40Z,"do i need to download something else? i finished it and could not get it to run.
i mounted the .rar file inside the folder but nothing happened."
,BeLeave,2009-12-09T17:14Z,"You have to extract the files before you mount, unless you already did but didn't say
also make sure you have all of the files in the right place, your problem happens to people that even buy the retail"
,BeLeave,2009-12-09T17:16Z,"and you may need both torrents for the game to work, thats DVD 1 and DVD 2"
,17Patty,2009-12-27T05:02Z,"DL is slow, but steady.  About 20 kb/s for 2 days now.  There's still approx. a day left till completion.  Seeding is very much appreciated, for me and future downloaders"
,17Patty,2009-12-27T20:29Z,"SHIT! Only 8 Seeders??? Come ON, guys!  I'm at 95% here- downloading at 5 kB/s.  

I'll seed when I'M done... idk why this torrent is losing seeders so damn quickly >:("
,pwn7s,2009-12-29T05:09Z,"I seem to have everything installed, but the game crashes as soon as I try to start a new game.  It always happens in the same place (3-4 seconds into the loading screen).  Any ideas?  "
