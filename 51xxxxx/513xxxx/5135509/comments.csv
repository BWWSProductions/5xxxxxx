A question about uploading, needing to UL a whole season of Highlander (22 episodes) but do not know how to bundle them together into one torrent, can you please assist?"
[V],Ekolb,2009-10-25T05:36Z,"Create one folder name it Highlander Season #, and add all 22 episode into that folder and then create one torrent.

This way it will include all 22 episodes in one folder and you can have one torrent."
