Aired: Oct 27, 2009 
 
Producer Ofra Bikel chronicles how the middle class is faring in this recession through the stories of the people who she's come to know at the hair salon she's frequented for the past 20 years. The film reveals the struggles of a small business owner to stay afloat, her sister's risk of imminent foreclosure on her Florida home and the various clients whose lives intersect at this New York City salon --from well-to-do bankers to struggling actors, each with a story to tell about how they're getting by in these turbulent times.
