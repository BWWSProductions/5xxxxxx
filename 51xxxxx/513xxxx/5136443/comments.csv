,msober,2009-11-04T08:29Z,"rating for cam a:8 v:8

a:8 (Audio is good to great for a cam, not hollow, or muffled, direct audio ie you can't hear people laughing/talking)

v:8 (Aspect ratio is good, nice and centered. you can see that the edges are rounded off most likely due to the fact that the camera is hidden in some fashion.  however you don't get the feeling that you are missing a bunch of the movie on either side of the camera.  slightly blurry)

All in all a great cam release.
