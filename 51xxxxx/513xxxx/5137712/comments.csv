thanks.  now if i can figure how to convert flac to mp3.  or will vlc play flac?  been a while."
,leafsmack,2009-10-28T09:54Z,"vlc ought to work fine, if you need to convert to mp3 I suggest mediacoder, using the extreme option for the Lame encoder, it is equivalent to a v0 rip.  maybe I'll upload a mp3 rip"
