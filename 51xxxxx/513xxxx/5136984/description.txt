The crystal clear video is from the DVD and the mono audio is restored from an old Swedish VHS. Hiss and noise removed.

Since the Swedish version of the movie is a bit censored, there are a few moments where I had to use the English audio track.

The sound is resynced to work with the movie

Here is a short summary of the movie:

Jim is working as an innkeeper, together with his friend, the mouse Gran. One day, a mysterious man visits the inn, leaving a map behind. The map shows an island with a treasure. So the duo sets off in their own little boat, trying to fulfil their dreams and leaving the inn far behind. But it seems more people knows of the map, as they cross paths with Captain Silver and his band of wild pirates. Jim, Gran and their new friend Kathy tries to beat them in the treasure hunt that ensues.
