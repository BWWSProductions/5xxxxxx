If you have Soul Revolution or Soul Rebel, Natural Mystic, and Soul Shakedown Party then you already have all these tracks."

Much the same tracks (plus some others), FLAC,  30 seeders. Album title for this one is ""One Love"".  

I'm not sure ""I haven't noticed this on pirate bay"" qualifies this as rare.  I'm not trying to discourage people from downloading this or criticising your release, it's fine.  I'm only pointing out that these are not rare tracks, they are easily and widely available by either purchasing the CDs (usually these are ultra cheap on budget labels) or by doing a quick search on any of a number of torrent or ed2k index sites.   

Many of the tracks in your release are excellent, and date from just before Bob Marley & The Wailers made an impact in the UK and then the USA.  They have a really different sound from later incarnations of the Wailers and some really distinctive and sweet singing from Bob Marley & Peter Tosh. "
