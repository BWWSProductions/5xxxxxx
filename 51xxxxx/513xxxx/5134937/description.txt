When a kindly elephant hears a faint cry of help from a floating speck of dust, his attempts to protect the tiny particle cause his neighbors to question his sanity in this animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' classic 1954 children's book of the same name. Produced by "Ice Age" makers Blue Sky, scripted by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, and directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, Horton Hears a Who reunites "Bruce Almighty" co-stars Jim Carrey and Steve Carell as the eponymous elephant and the mayor of Whoville respectively.

Elas kord elevant nimega Horton, kes oli tuntud oma lennuka kujutlusvÃµime poolest. Ã¼hel pÃ¤eval kuulis ta appihÃ¼Ã¼et tolmukÃ¼beme pealt, mis temast tuulega mÃ¶Ã¶da lendas. Kuigi Horton seda siis veel ei teadnud, asub sel tolmukÃ¼bemel terve linnake nimega KessekÃ¼la ning selle elanike pÃ¤Ã¤stmine saab sÃµbraliku elevandi elu kÃµige tÃ¤htsamaks ettevÃµtmiseks. Kuigi kaaslased ja naabrid arvavad, et Horton on hulluks lÃ¤inud, jÃ¤Ã¤b ta endale kindlaks: Elusolend on elusolend, olgu ta kuitahes pisike.
