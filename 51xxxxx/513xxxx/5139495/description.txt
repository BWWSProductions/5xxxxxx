Sorry it took so long, TPB's captcha system was down so I couldn't enter a code I couldnt see lol.  I had this up on isohunt, but now that its working on here, i'll put it here.

This is the HD version of Jason DeRulo's "Whatcha Say" video!  This is a really simple video, but thats doesn't make it bad at all.  Jason did a very good job with playing his part in the video, showing emotion of the song, and a little dancing.  He is gonna blow up big if he can produce songs like this one. 

Codec for video is H.264 @ ~1478kbps Reso: 1280x720 and codec for audio is AAC @ 123kbps 44100khz.  This was downloaded straight from YT, so no compression was induced other than what Jason's media managers did.  Very good quality :D  Hope you enjoy the video.  If you like this release, please leave comments and some positive feedback.
