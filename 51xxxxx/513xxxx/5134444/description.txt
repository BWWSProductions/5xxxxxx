"Full Circle" is the upcoming album by American post-grunge band Creed.

It will be Creed's first release since their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits, their first studio album since 2001's Weathered, and their first studio album to feature original bassist Brian Marshall in almost exactly a decade. The record was produced by Howard Benson. The album was completed on July 31, 2009 as announced by Scott Stapp. Four days later, the album cover was revealed through the band's official e-news.

Most of the album is heavier than the past three Creed records, as Stapp said before the release of the album. There are also more guitar solos, as heard on the album, originally announced by Mark Tremonti on his Twitter page. He also stated that he is "very proud of the solos on this record".
