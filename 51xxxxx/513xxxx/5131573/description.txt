The Drunken Act--Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev

â€œLife is a dream but the dream is true." - Sadhguru

In â€˜The Drunken Actâ€™, Sadhguru is as eloquent as ever about overcoming any form of make-believe, be it drunkenness or pandering to oneâ€™s psychological processes. Bold, witty and incisisve, Sadhguru offers us a way out of the traps of the psyche.

Question 1: Sadhguru, you mentioned before that you are simply an act and that there is no actor left. Then who is it that's drunk or feeling the bliss of Samadhi?

Question 2: Sadhguru, when you say everything in existence is just energy, from the gross to the subtle, it suggests a completely impersonal reality. Does the realm of the personal, all it's love, poetry, it's lunacy, it's rage, it mean nothing at all ultimately? Does it mean there is no connection at all between the psychological and the existential?

Question 3: Sadhguru, I have tasted many times something of the beyond. But still I get stuck in many small petty issues. How do I overcome this and maintain equilibrium?
