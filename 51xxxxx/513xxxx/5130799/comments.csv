,DayDreamz,2009-10-22T18:23Z,I really dont understand why people keep using 32 bit software when 64 bit is out there. Looks to me like people are trying to fit a Fiat 127 engine into a Ferrari. 32 bit is so yesterday.
,Jazzy79,2009-10-22T18:49Z,people use 32bit becuase alot of people cant afford a system that will run 64bit thats why. why buy something you really dont need when you have something that works great you already

,hikki_man,2009-10-23T15:19Z,"@DayDreamz: fiat and farrari? People are not converting for good reasons. There is driver and application compatibility issues (if only I had a dollar each time I read someone on a 64-bit system complaining about drivers or applications not working for him). There is also performance, where in a lot of cases or even most cases 32-bit is faster compared to 64. The only real benefit of 64 bit is the ability to have more RAM, and you only ever need more than 4GB if you play four huge games at the same time somehow. So just because that computer salesman fooled you into buying that bigger better more modern 64 bit system and convinced you that 32-bit is so yesterday, doesn't mean other people should be as stupid. You sound a lot like mac users."

I can not tell any huge difference using 32 bit vs 64 bit on regular programs that most people would run and my desktop and laptop are very similar computers.  Yes, the 64 bit let me use up to 8gb of memory which is nice but finding the drivers is hell!"

,Xris22,2009-10-23T17:33Z,"@ hkki_man:

So totally agree.  One of my biggest bug-bears with 64 was that I couldn't find full drivers for my (NOT cheap) sound card...  Then when I finally downloaded some shitty chewing-gum-and-string (a.k.a minimal-function) drivers from OEM source, I had similar probs with my (again, NOT cheap) video card...  Even my DVD writer was asking me ""what IS this shit?""

Anyway.... why DO I bother buying mainboards that can take 8Gb when this 32/64-bit idiot child can't even find it all?  Maybe coz hopefully the idiot children working at MS might actually get it right one day....

Meanwhile my 32-bit system runs ~35% faster than the same (high-end) hardware on a 64-bit system.

Yeah... Creative are pretty shitty too with regards to totally crap support for their over-priced hardware, but they're just playing the game with Microsoft that all the other primary OEMs are doing... 

Microsoft creates OS that don't even attempt back-compatibility any more, while the hardware OEMs reap the benefits of everyone rushing out to buy replacement hardware for their new OS (gotta... coz it's reaaaal funky and there's even pirated BLACK versions of it out already... oops, wet meself ^^).

Yup, I know a guy that binned a 7-week old £700 Sony media system to buy the silver version for £200 more.... true.... And yes, I was into the guy's bin like a ferret up a drain-pipe.

,superxyz,2009-10-24T03:01Z,"@ IWalkAlone247

Yes, this is the 64 bit version.  x86 always means 64bit, because of the 22 sectors of address space in the processor that are always ignored by the operating system, leaving 64 sectors of ""usable"" bits.  Hope this clarifies any confusion. 

PS if you want 32 bit Windows 7, you want the x10 version.

,chakri04006,2009-10-24T13:51Z,what is meant by x86
,superxyz,2009-10-24T15:01Z,"x86, as already stated, means 64 bit due to the 22 unallocated sectors (or ""goblin"" sectors, as those who are familiar with computer processors refer to them).  This is the sort of processor that all the big movie stars like John Travolta are using nowadays.

However, those of us with smaller bank balances are still using the older x10 or 32 bit architecture (which I'm using right now to type this).  

If you want to verify this, I found a great new site called ""wikipedia"" where you can just type ""x86"" into the search bar and find out all about it.  Though you will probably be more confused after reading it than before."

You don't have to make another partition if you don't want to, if you do that then you can dual your current OS and Windows 7, when you turn your computer on you will be asked what one you want to load up.  If you don't make another partition you wont be able to keep your files if you don't do an upgrade, which is the top choice when it asks you how you want to install Windows 7, but if you choose the upgrade option you will keep your files, but you might be faced with driver problems meaning some drivers might now work, that is what happened to me when I first installed windows 7, I could not get my network adapter to work, but when I did a clean install everything worked fine, but I did not get to keep my documents and stuff like that, the only thing you will keep is your old windows files, which will be called Windows old in the C:\ directory.  I recommend doing a clean install, (The bottom option) but you can try to do an upgrade (Top option) , and if you get problems, you can always go back to do the clean install. "

If you attempt to activate over the internet it then tells you that your product key is invalid.  

During my install I didn't enter any product key, I just clicked next.  I also rebooted immediately after getting to the desktop.  

There is no warning or message informing you that it has changed from activated to a countdown, you just have to check.

After installing this a few days ago it has been up and running well, and nae probs. 
Any problems i had installing it were of my own making caused through tech ignorance and just being a numpty[definition of numpty RE-Scots Dictionary}.
After shelling out money for Vista ultimate only 2 years ago i felt that M/soft had conned me, so now i have redressed this and just for good measure also downloaded from Mbb15 Office 2010 to fuck them twice over.

- Download the file (make sure you have winrar, if not download it from*)

* http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5069577/WinRAR_v3.90_Final___KeyReg_By_ChattChitto

- Right click the windows 7 .iso file and then open with WinRAR, this shows the contents of the disc.

- You can just run the setup.exe file from winrar but if you want it in a file then just create a folder and extract it all into that folder

- There will be a bunch of files and at the very bottom there should be a setup.exe

- Click on the setup.exe this should begin your windows 7 Ultimate setup.

- Go through all of the setup, and when you get to the Activation part and it asks you for a serial key, just leave it blank and click next.

- After it has finished downloading windows 7 will be up and running, however not activated.

- Download this file

When you start your computer, repeatedly press F8 Until you see a screen that says, ""repair your computer, safe mode, etc."" Select Repair my Computer and hit enter. Wait for it to load and Then Select Look/Search for startup problems. It should get fixed."

Works perfect can do windows updates etc!  However Ive got another laptop wich fails to have this activated. Installed it several times, but it still says it should be activated in 30 days.
Its a Compaq nx5000 and I have no clue what the problem could be. Somehow this is the only pc wich keeps refusing the activation :( (formatted everything, deleted partitions and made new ones again and formatted afterwords.)

I have no clue where the problem lies...
Anyone know why this happens to particular pc's?

I'll just write few notes which may help others' Qs.
Yes, you can Update your machine like you normally would. No updating issues. During installation it asked if it could find/activate or something similar the key itself, and I opt for Yes, and I didn't have to Activate the Windows at all! (Cool, eh?!) 

- I downloaded the ISO file like we normally do.
- I tried to burn it to a DVD using PowerISO but it said it wasn't the right type of ISO. (It was little worrying at that stage.) 
- Then it just sprang to my mind why not use WinRAR.
- Then, I used Open With option and explored the ISO file. 
- Doubled clicked on the Setup (.exe) file, it took about 7,9 mins to extract the files. 
- That window came up asking if I wanted to Install Windows..

THANK YOU Mbb15! (Y) 
And yes I am Seeding. Everyone, please do seed at least 1:1. Thanks.

pick 4x speed and burn.

right click open with winrar,
double-click setup.exe

then the win 7 install now
should appear."

,chuckmamuck,2010-02-12T19:24Z,"hannibal0.
you can buy OEM versions, look at any online IT retailers website, they sell OEM and reatail. OEM versions are always quite alot cheaper.
theres no real difference in the OS, you just get an OEM key instead of a retail and the OS might be branded with the OEM's logo and have their promo programs installed like you get on any pre manufactured pc. the OEM os is just the same as that installed on an Acer, Compaq or HP computer."
,hannibal0,2010-02-13T20:44Z,"CHUCKMAMUCK

Ok agreed :-) so lets say i have a Acer branded pc with an OA key- could i install a OEM dvd that is not branded, what mean by that by using a retail disc an edit the c.cfg file-channel-retail- and change this to OEM. and my OA key will work???"
