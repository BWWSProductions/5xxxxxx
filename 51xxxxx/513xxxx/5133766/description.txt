English (American) Learning Tips

In both written and spoken English some pairs of words are combined into a shorter form, called a contraction. In spoken English, if a contraction exists for a pair of words, the full forms will be used relatively infrequently (mostly for emphasis). For example, the words â€œit isâ€ are often written and pronounced â€œitâ€™s.â€
Youâ€™ll notice that English spelling is irregular, with the same sounds being written in different ways.
Sometimes words may be spelled the same but have different meanings and pronunciations. Rosetta Stone teaches you to distinguish between these words through context.
English nouns have singular and plural forms, but they donâ€™t have masculine or feminine forms.

This solution will help you:
Further develop vocabulary and language abilities, developing a true command of the language
Practice unscripted conversations in English
Retain what you learn
Read and understand English
Share ideas and opinions, express feelings and talk about everyday life
Negotiate complex situations with confidence and accuracy
Sample topics include:

Scheduling and rescheduling appointments
Arranging home repairs
Planning to move abroad
Careers
Conducting interviews

Industry terms
Problem-solving and commercial transactions
