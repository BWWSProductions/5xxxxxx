,kkbb3000,2009-10-26T15:23Z,"Hi as always eztv thanks for the best downloads on the net, question though, I see the larger files are now in this MKV format, this means they will no longer play on a usb stick in my dvd player, is there  some way I can convert them into Divx format please? 
I'm a clueless downloader when it comes to this sort of thing, advice appreciated."
