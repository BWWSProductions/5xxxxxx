RE SEED just in time for the silly season of office and other parties, this lot started life as a VHS Video Cassette tape sent out as a promo in much the same way as the DVD's are sent out today, in 1992 my Radio Station took the very wise course of going all digital and the CD and Video library were archived using the best quality available at that time.

The result here has even made its way to Ebay were someone actually packaged this lot and is selling them, Oh well whatever.

Vob (mpeg2) files tagged and good to go
320kbs Stereo
4:3 and 16:9 mixed screen ratio
English
Source VHS Video Tape

I will be re seeding the 90s series as well with additional trackers just in case TPB and Demonoid both go down.

Enjoy.  Rigmar Radio
