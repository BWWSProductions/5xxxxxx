3 mixtapes

Contemplations. Vol. 1
Suns Of Liberty Vol. 1
Suns Of Liberty Vol. 2

All 3 are LAME encoded with extreme quality VBR settings.

Sorry I couldn't find setlists for the first two mixes, and I didn't feel like typing them out, but the one setlists should give you an idea of how I roll.
