,ticktock_man,2009-10-28T15:40Z,"thanks... but whats with the RARs? 
this isnt 1992 when everyone is on dialup downloading from FTPs... there is no need for RARs when you have hash checking - all it does is reduce the amount of seeders as people extract and delete RARs."
,Vader--,2009-10-28T15:48Z,Hey ticktock ...you don't know shit about avi and rar so shut your pie hole and go get educated!
,Ghostfish,2009-10-28T17:58Z,Hey Vader--. please educate us.
,j4ymark,2009-10-28T20:32Z,"Ya, Vader-. Put up or shut up! This is suppossed to be P2P not  A2A (Asshole to Asshole). If people need help, take the time to direct them to a site that will EDUCATE them or inform them yourself, you pompass shitass! "
,Vader--,2009-10-29T00:53Z,"Some reasons why people rar files

1)provides a second checksum
2)Skips by copyright checks in some areas of the world.
3)If one corrupts you dont have to download the file all over again all you  do is download that one rar
4)faster to download and uses less bandwidth.
5)Was a Scene Release
   I am sure there are other reasons to.
As I am sure lots of people can come up with reasons they hate them.  But an extra min to unrar is not a bitch!...unlike jy4mark the 12 year old"
,zen-TAO,2009-10-29T01:44Z,"Thanks.

I am not an expert, but
in my experience:

""ticktock_man"" and others:
its like ""Vader--"" says. AND: If you DL a .rar-file it goes faster to DL because its several smaller files than one big .avi-file.

Its common sense, really...

Peace and Love!"
,higedebo,2009-10-29T12:14Z,Thanks for this :-)
,arxidobalo,2009-10-29T22:54Z,"> 1)provides a second checksum

Useless. Torrent is a number of parts with very own checksum each.

> 2)Skips by copyright checks in some areas of the world.

wrong if your connection is encrypted.

> 3)If one corrupts you dont have to download the file all over again all you do is download that one rar

If one corrupts on leacher, automatically download again - this is torrent.
If one corrupts on seeder: This has very low possibility. Specially for AVI files

> 4)faster to download and uses less bandwidth.

No way. compression level is about -1% (bigger result file)

> 5)Was a Scene Release

I don't understand what you mean here.


FACE IT.
We have almost 2010.
We always uncompress and delete RAR files because of ...RAR. So we stop seeding ASAP."
,Vader--,2009-11-05T03:23Z,"1) Oh is that why people can get stuck at 99.9% of a file sometime and it never finishes for them , because of the 1st and only checksum used to carry the file from rip to share....right-NOT

2)connection is encrypted...lol what do don't think the law and or your isp decrypt your shit and look at it...your open file that is

3) You lost me on your thinking here- simple to get and quick -what's the doubt with that???!

4)Typicaly a rar file can be 10,20 even 30% smaller than the contents and can contain multiple folders and files and programs if needed.
This Particuliar RAR was NOT rared in that fashion but could have been if the upper so desired.

5) You gotta balls comming here talking smack shit and ending with   AH duh the scene -I don't understand...HOW THE FUCK can you be using torrents and not realize what the scene is ???

Go back to bed and try waking up in 2020...maybee it will be more to your liking"
,Vader--,2009-11-05T03:53Z,"And look at this

     Milan Serbia downloaded one of YOUR ups and complains it won't finish, he's stuck at 99.9%
on YOUR UP called ATTila 1974.
(click arxidobalo's name to see)

 Should of rared it maybee...lol...oh didn't the p2p checksum work so well and on your torrent. What a prime example!


 Let the door hit you on the way out docu boy."
