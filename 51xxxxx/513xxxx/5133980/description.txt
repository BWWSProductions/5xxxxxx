http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286130/

Plot: The Cylons began as humanity's robot servants. They rebelled and evolved and now they look like us. Their plan is simple: destroy the race that enslaved them. But when their devastating attack leaves human survivors, the Cylons have to improvise. Battlestar Galactica: The Plan tells the story of two powerful Cylon leaders, working separately, and their determination to finish the task.

Edward James Olmos, Dean Stockwell, Tricia Helfer, Grace Park
