Steam (PC Only)

If you have purchased, installed, and activated via Steam, you will already have patch 1 of FM2010, and should be running version 10.1.0

If you have purchased, installed and activated via another digital download partner, you will should already have a patched version of FM2010, and should be running version 10.1.0 - DO NOT MANUALLY PATCH digital downloads like eSellerate or Steam - it will cause errors with your game. '"

however, the game requires that you have the CD/DVD in the drive at all times.
So, just simply burn the iso in this torrent to a DVD and then play!
Or you can use software such as PowerISO or Daemon Tools to mount the image!

SIMPLE!! NO CRACKS/KEYGEN/SERIAL NEEDED!

Unmounting/mounting .iso image doesn't do a thing.  The only thing that will work is to uninstall then re-install.  Kinda a pain in the butt.  Some help advice/help would be greatly appreciated.

,dragonlord21,2009-11-23T14:17Z,This game really sucks!! I definitely prefer fifa 09 to this shit!
,Badfellah,2009-11-24T12:15Z,"Okey, this is what people should know!

There is no need for crack etc. But know that the game will only work for ONE SEASON. In June/July before the second season, you will not be able to play anymore. This is much like in FM 2009. They have really done a great job at protecting this game from piracy. I have to say.

It took a hell of a long time to get FM 2009 to work properly with a download. It was cracked finally with a manipulated form of registration, were you had to go through some steps to ""activate it"" through ""by phone"". And then some new patches came out, and made it even harder. All in all, I spent extremely much time on searching again and again for a working method.

It isn't worth it! FM 2009 was not a great game, it was disappointing, and not as addictive as before.

But what about FM 2010? Well, this is what I will do. I will install it and all, and play for half a season or so. If it works well on my laptop and I like it - I will buy the game. It isn't really expensive. I advise people to do the same! It isn't worth spending heck of alot time to make it work, and ditto when a patch is released!

Use this download as a ""demo"". And if you like it, buy it. The best advice you can get! (And don't forget to download the patch).

Cheers. And congrats to Sega, for really winning the piracy battle on the FM series! "

,Badfellah,2009-11-29T02:30Z,"It is true, and I have to correct myself!

There is no copyright protection on this game! I simulated a season, just to make sure. And the game didn't crash in June/July. Sega also have confirmed there is NO PROTECTION on the offline ""cd version"".

Don't call me a Sega employee, don't be paranoid. If I was, I would never write what I said. Because everyone would see you could play beyond the one season! So use your brain cotechigno! So this game is not at all hell like 2009 was. And sure as hell it is a much better game!

DO NOT USE A CRACK!!! If you do, you are only fucking yourself. Download and install like Mbb15 said in the instructions. Then download the patch, and install it. And then you are ready to play. AGAIN, DO NOT USE A CRACK!

Works like a charm, no problems saving etc. Those probably come from the crack. But what I do, just to take no chances, is to unmount and mount the image every time before I play the game. Probably not necessary, but why take chances? Come to think of it, it is stupid. I will stop it. And for your info, I have activated all of ""safedisc"", ""securom""and ""laserlok"". Just to be on the safe side.

AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST DEAMON TOOLS PROGRAM! I did install the game once, and I couldn't start it up. I downloaded the newest deamon tools and reinstalled the game, and it loaded for me to play. Maybe something went wrong when I first installed the game, but I think it must have been down to me not having the latest DT program.

Cheers guys, and have fun.

PS: Stupid fuckers using a patch, can blame all the problems they have, on themselves. Quite ironic how a crack is the root of peoples problems. ;D"
,Badfellah,2009-11-29T02:33Z,"So I repeat, DO NOT USE A CRACK!

It will probably only fuck things up. Just read about it on the net: there is no protection used in this game for the off-line version. Not even a serial."

,Jain_Pooj,2009-12-09T21:24Z,"Well, I'd just like to help out others who are having some problems regarding the mounting and installation by telling the procedure I followed...

Firstly, I'm on Windows XP so sorry can't help those have problems on Vista.

1> D/l the torrent
2> After the d/ling is done, you'll find two files in the d/led destination. i.e. reloaded and rld-fm10
3> To proceed, you gotta have a disk image emulator like Daemon tools or magic iso. 
4> Just open either one of 'em and mount the file ""rld-fm10"" from the d/led location.
5>Once the mounting is done, just install the game as usual by double clicking the setup file. 

P.S :- Install only after your network connection is disabled.

6> After the installation, just close all apps and go play the game! lOL :D Enjoy!!

P.S :- This is the procedure I personally followed and the game worked like a charm! So hope it helps for all those who've got problems. 

Once again, thanks to the uploader!

,lerchos2,2009-12-09T22:14Z,"Hello dear users. I have recently noticed that most of you, if not all of you have found the function of SEEDING a torrent, but setting you upload to 0 (effectively disconnecting you from the DHT or Peertrade also seems to be popular) to somehow steer clear of the ever so powerful MPAA/FBI/IFPI (at least that is my assumtion, since TPB is working awfully slow ever since the trial against the crew) Let me lay down some ground rules for all of you who are sheepishly afraid of ""da man"" or being sued or in general seem to suffer from paranoid delusions about the governments effort to stop YOU. 

1. NO, the goverment dont spend $$$ on sitting in front of Utorrent harvesting IPs from the log, its inaccurate and worthless. This theory can now be diminshed once and for all

2. NO, the government will not SUE in EVERY DAMN SILLY CASE the MPAA files againts single individuals. The amounts of cases may be staggering, but if we would all be that dangerous, we would already be in jail. And NO, nobody is currently behind the wall, building a case against all of us..there is no conspiracy, only paranoid people who spend to little time in the sun. 

3. There are no FBI/MPAA/IFPi honeypot torrents out there, building a case this way is entrapment and illegal in most countries outside of the USA, and when you do a cross section of people who use a torrent, you might as well paste the UN flag all over it. Even if theyd have honeypots to collect you IPS, filing and suing against you would take many many years..so please stop haggering about ""oh this must be a honeypot..everyone stop your upload..""

4. Okay,  now im going to stop for a while to simply say this. There is NO way you can DOWNLOAD from ThePirateBay, Demonoid, whatever WITHOUT being visible. Whatever douchebag that got this around, or whatever ?expert? said it I don?t care. He or she is propably the one from MPAA, trying to make you look stupid. There is a large difference between Utorrent and lets say Kazaa. Kazaa uses a ?reflection? of you harddrive, to download (copy in webspace) stuff from you to  others and vice versa. I remember the myth that said that you apparently could acess someones entire system IN REAL time because IT HAD CONTACT WTH YOUR HARDDRIVE. I think ive heard som many bad myths about the internet and how fucking dangerous it seems to be. Yes its technically true that someone can do this..but why, and how would they ever find such a stupid idea compelling enoug to try..P2P is safe, more safe than keeping hard copies inside your home..so stop worrying..and start UPLOADING.

5. There is NO excuse to say..have a 10MBIT /10 MBIT and set you upload to 2 MBIT something..set it to MAX output or fuck off.

6. I know that since all this hi fidelity psycho-paranoid crap about that ?theyre watching man, they are..dude? most of you people who cant even unrar a single damn file, let alone use the simplest of inctruction to install say a RELOADED release probably act out like weed-crack-meth smoking hippies alone in your computer room, thinking that the man will run into your house the next minute cause you used the pirate bay..but let me say..smoke all the weed you want..or crack or whatever but RELAX..NO ONE is going to come to your door. It is SAFE to upload, and not doing so is more of a favour to MPAA/IFPI/all other evil companies than anything else.

7. Im sorry if I sound pissed off, but I have 50/50 MBIT Bahnhof optical fiber installed and I know that this must be hard on you people, but I would like to GET SOME JUICE. It doesn?t matter whether your upload is 1 or 10, strangling your upload or not seeding at all will lead to shitty speeds for EVERYONE, especially people with high speed connections, who instead get to feed your leeching with their bandwidth. Ive seen several IPs download from me in 4-5MBIT /Mb/s) and I get to sit and watch download speeds of lets say 20 kb/s. That?s not fair?

So here it is..in short

1. Nobody is watching us..if they do, let them..they cant hurt you.

2. Not using your upload is inexcusable

3. There are only honeypots in Winnie"

,liebenrw,2010-01-02T23:35Z,Worked perfect for me the very first time. No problems since. I am downloading he update and hopefully that will be great too. Use Alcohol 120% to mount instead of burning to a dvd it's soooo much faster. Download took about 4hrs though so we need to seed after we download noobies!

Thanks for the instructions,
but are u FUCKED IN THE HEAD.
Y the fuck are u fuckin up TPB's look by using fat ass big case letters."
,part-time-torrenter,2010-01-06T09:40Z,"right, so first off it took 9 and a half hours to download... It works..... but when you close it you cant re-open it... you have to uninstall it the reinstall it just to play it again... so much fuss to be honest."
,Pirate_02,2010-01-06T19:52Z,"Guys if you just follow the instructions mentioned in this forum, the game plays fine.....
If you face problems then you are doing something wrong......

I will repeat the steps and try to keep it as simple as possible: (this is what i did).....

1. Download this torrent using Utorrent.....

2. When the download is complete, you should see 2 files ----- msinfo and rld-fm10.......

3. rld-fm10 is the iso file.....

4. Burn 'rld-fm10' to a DVD. No need to change anything. But remember this is not a movie file but an image file. So when you want to burn disc, use 'burn image to disc' option. You can use this free program to burn disc
http://www.imgburn.com/     .........

5. After the burning process is complete, you now have a DVD with the 'rld-fm10' file in it. Label the disc using a pen or marker.......

6. Ok now lets play the game. But before you do that, you need a program called 'Daemon tools lite' Its free.
http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/     ..........

7. Right now you don't need to worry about what this program 'Daemon tools lite' will do, just follow instructions and later you will understand. I am writing like this so that beginners can understand......

8. I assume by now you have 'Daemon tools lite' installed. Run the program and you should see it on the status bar below......

9. Right click 'Daemon tools lite' on the status bar ----->virtual DVD Rom---------> Device ------>mount image------->choose 'rld-fm10' file on the DVD drive

10. The game will install. Select offline installation and proceed.....

DONE!!!

11. Now you have the game installed, next you need to patch it (to fix game errors) and apply crack (i guess to enable you to play for more than one season).....


[The reason you are burning the iso file to DVD is to save hard disk space in your PC]"
,Pirate_02,2010-01-06T20:36Z,"Topic :  Applying Patch and crack

Patch - to correct game errors
Crack - to enable you to play for more than one season, i guess.

Ok lets begin,

1. Download Patch 10.1 and crack here
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5141818/Football.Manager.2010.Update.10.1_Crack-BAT

2. When download is complete you will have compressed zip file 
'Football.Manager.2010.Update.10.1_Crack-BAT'

3. To open this file you can use this free program
http://www.izarc.org/

4. I now assume that you have installed the program IZArc. Ok now lets use it

5. Right click on the zip file 'Football.Manager.2010.Update.10.1_Crack-BAT' ---------->'open with'------>'select program'------>'IZArc'

6. Now the IZArc program opens up. Choose 'Extract' and proceed

7. Once the process is completed, you will have an unzipped file 'Football.Manager.2010.Update.10.1_Crack-BAT'. Like a folder....

8. Open it and look for the 'fm2010 patch' file only. Its a single file. Ignore the rest. Move this 'fm2010 patch' file to C:\program files\sports interactive\fm 2010.

9. Once moved, double click it and run that patch file. It will update 817 files.

10. Once patching is done, go to the unzipped file
'Football.Manager.2010.Update.10.1_Crack-BAT' and look for the 'Crack' file. Its a single file, so ignore the rest. 

11. Move the 'Crack' file to C:\program files\sports interactive\fm 2010 . It will replace the orginal fm2010 exe file

12. Run the game from this 'Crack' file. You may want to create a shortcut in your desktop for convenience.

DONE!!!

Next....follow the same steps for future Patches and cracks


Play this game only if you have a decent computer otherwise don't bother."

,Pirate_02,2010-01-20T00:30Z,"Wolly27-
If you installed the game according to the instructions given in this forum, you shouldn't have any problems. Anyway, I suggest you run the game from the directory c:\program files\....fm2010 but before that restart your computer once. If it still fails to run, uninstall and install again. I have given a clear step by step installation guide in my previous comments.
I too use xp on an average computer.

To the rest of the people who say there are not enough seeds, i disagree. This is a very healthy torrent. Perhaps you need to re-configure your Utorrent. "

,MrStaticJunk,2010-02-13T12:45Z,Ok follow GoToSleep's Advice. Even though it uses unneeded swearing. It worked for me. Just use magic iso and magic disk to mount the file to a fake cd drive. (this will allow you activate it) 
,niceworkbuddy,2010-02-13T17:35Z,"Okay, I finally installed it. Enought of the cryptic clues. Here is a proper instalation guide. 
1) Download this Torrent 
2) Download Daemon Tools Lite
3) Make sure you have a program that can open unzip the torrent (Iso file) after you have downloaded. You can use WinZip, but I used UnDisker 1.6
4)After you have downloaded Daemon. right click on the small icon located at the bottom right of your screen (right clicking the shortcut will not work) and select Mount-Manager.
5) Search for the FM Reloader files you downloaded (program files) and select Mount. This will tell you CD drive you have a game installed. 
6) Leave Daemon Tools and search for the FM Reloader files. 
7)Select - Disk 1 - Install Data - Windows (or Mac) and VM. this will now download the game into your computer and bypass the 'insert CD'. 
8) Locate the installation you just installed which should be in the Sports Interactive file located in your Program Files.
9) Select the FM 10 Icon and your game will begin. 
Note: If you want to play a large databade size (more players) cancel the wizard at the start. It will take you to a new screen. 

If you enjoy the game, support the industry and makers and buy it! Unless, like me, you live in Canada, where there is retailer of any kind who stocks this. They will try and sell me Hockey Manager. Nar, I'll stick to Football. "

,jaketuricchi,2010-02-21T15:36Z,"Hey I was wondering if anyone could help me.

I have been playing the game without many glitches, the only glitch i had encounter was every time i saved the game; after saving it would display ""Cannot find Disk; Retry/Exit?""- or something to that meaning. This was okay because it was still saving the game before i had to quit so i could simply reload it and i would start from where i last saved.

But this problem seems to have changed. Now, without me even saving it, it displays this message. Every week or so ingame it will display this message and i am forced to quit and lose my progress every time.

I did not burn the game onto a disk, i just mounted it using Daemon Lite and it seemed to run smoothly until maybe 12 hours of gameplay until these problems began.

I would much appriciate if anyone could give me a hand, thank you."

,pjbarnes18,2010-07-24T08:22Z,"I'm not a computer expert or have a clue about torrents and i still managed to download and play the game easily with only a few minor hick ups. Why don't people like me who are not sure read up about these things before they download then write bad reviews, you are getting the game for free so you should expect to do a little bit of work. I'm a newbie and i figured it out, its called research, you know that thing when you don't know what to do, so you use your head and look it up, honest to god some people i mean wtf, how do you think all these people found out, they looked it up and figured it out for themselves. Sorry for the rant but its deserved its like some people expect a powerpoint presentation on how to install it,  if you can't think for yourself buy the fucker. "

,badboy2010,2010-08-12T19:13Z,"IF YOU CAN NOT GET THIS TO WORK DO THIS

,liljeb12,2010-08-22T00:44Z,"good torrent, works fine, although i have encountered a problem after a long time of playing. i played about 5 seasons before this started to happen. at one stage, just when starting a game, i get an error message, ""a serious error was encountered and the application will close"". this happens at the same game in a save every time, and theres no way to get past it(that i know of). now it has happened to all my new saves ive created, after about ½ to 1 season. can anyone help??"

,Dathe1000,2010-08-26T07:58Z,"@kiwistylz: Well, you could always actually go do something horrid as to buy the game......"
,kiwistylz,2010-08-26T09:39Z,"@Dathe1000  Stop being a dick and trolling, why are you even on this site if you are so worried about piracy.  Go give some money to a homeless person you hippie."

Anyone else have this problem?"
,Doctor-Who,2010-09-24T00:29Z,Forget my last comment.

Why?"

WTF's going on?"
,majida905,2010-09-28T21:12Z,"If you are missing d3dx9_41.dll just do the following:
Solution 1:
- Download d3dx9_41.dll from here:
http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=d3dx9_41.dll
- Decompress it in your folder c:\windows\system32

If after that it still doesn't work, go to Microsoft web site and update your directx"

,Sczcepanik,2010-10-10T03:19Z,"Nice game, nice speed 1mb + easy download."
,vincentdesrd,2010-10-30T06:11Z,"To people having errors with the game, not the torrent file, at the end of the setup process you are asked to install DirectX. Do you click Next to install DirectX dll files or click on cancel?

Even if you have you have DirectX 11 on your system and the game uses DirectX 9 this doesn't mean you have all the DirectX 9 dll files installed, which WILL lead to errors and crashes."

,oddik1984,2011-01-03T09:06Z,"Great download, easy install, works fine :)"
,art_fargunkel,2011-02-09T21:25Z,"I've downloaded and installed the game, the patch and copied the crack. The game works fine, but every time I save manually, it says that the DVD is not there, so it closes down. However, every time I start up again, I can continue, because the game saves automatically after every important decision I make. I will probably play a while and buy it eventually."
,Havoc1188,2011-02-20T13:41Z,"i had this game running perfect before without any problems and recently i tried playing it again and it gives me some error msg ""Football manager 2010 v 10 . 0 . 0 f 80362 quit unexpectedly."" Anyone know how to fix this? maybe i downloaded something that messed around with it?"
