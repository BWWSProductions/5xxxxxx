A Nightmare Outdoor - The Last Daylight 2009  [COMPLETE.PAL.DVDR]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The legendary hardcore festival 'Nightmare Outdoor' moved its borders
on May 16, 2009. For the first time the festival left its Rotterdam
roots to establish a new nightmare in the eastern parts of Holland. 
Going under the guise of "Nightmare Outdoor - The last daylight" this
2009 edition was a thrillin' opening of the summer festival season!
Despite the tricky weather forecasts and the fact that this was the
first time the party would proceed during daylight, around 10.000
hardcore die-hards found their way to the spectacular festival grounds. 
UDC & Mid-Town Records served up 6 areas with a combined total of 75
DJ's and live acts who took this festival ands its visitors into hardcore
heaven.
From kickin' mainstream hardcore via brutal terror and industrial over
to the good old early rave and happy hardcore, all aspects of this
powerful scene were represented by leading artists such as Amnesys,
Paul Elstak, DJ Panic, Mad Dog, D-Passion, Marc Acardipane, Tha Playah,
Peaky Pounder, Scott Brown, Enzyme X, Na-Goyah, The Stunned Guys, Ophidian,
Forze DJ Team, Akira, Mindustries and loads... and loads more! 
The combination of the outstanding music, the surprisingly good weather,
the extreme phat location plus eye-catching decoration and off course
the ear blowing sound systems made this 2009 edition a classic one. 
And now the long awaited Live Registration DVD is being released. This DVD
gives you the chance to relive the event once again or get a glimpse of what
you missed.
