I have collected an almost discography of Dutch rockband Kane. They are originally founded in The Hague, The Netherlands. The group consists of the two original members, Dinand Woesthoff (lead vocals) and Dennis van Leeuwen (guitar). Their music can be described as "guitar rock" and is inspired by U2. The group started to perform in 1998 for a small audience but soon got noticed by Edwin Jansen. Their breakthrough came with the album 'Where do I go' in 1999. Their latest released album was the live album recorded in de Kuip, Rotterdam.

This discography includes 10 albums and some extra's. There are also 5 DVD's in this torrent.

Enjoy!
