Life is pretty normal for high schoolers Julian (John Keefe) and Zeke (Elvin Dandel) until Julian's Uncle Charles (Peter Coyote), who conducts experiments for the evil Hybratech Corp. to re-animate the dead, brings a little bit of his work home with him. Things really get out of hand, however, when Julian discovers that his uncle's favorite test subjects are none other than his parents! Plenty of campy zombie zaniness ensues.
