,HiddenFfear,2009-10-25T10:26Z,"I can't even get past the very first trap.. It says to move in a clockwise way, but moving the mouse doesn't do it, and I can't figure out what I'm supposed to move... Perhaps I need a controller for this?"
,hank266,2009-10-25T12:20Z,Thx Subzero.You made me worry there for awhile. I really enjoy your site and checking it out every day^^
,legendlazy,2009-10-25T15:33Z,Does this one have sound?
,HiddenFfear,2009-10-25T20:04Z,"@ eddietah 

There are no button commands, just the clockwise command, and it's not working. There's also a number that flashes on the back of the beartrap, so I've tried hitting that number, but still nothing works..."
,hazziemo,2009-10-25T23:02Z,"great game. COULD IT DOWNLOAD WANY SLOWER? SEED, DAMN YOU, SEED"
,HiddenFfear,2009-10-26T00:45Z,"Nevermind, got it working ;) Boy I feel dumb now. Great game, combat sucks but that's not what this game is about. Thank TPTB!"
,flirtyguy10,2009-10-26T21:27Z,"is it true???

does this release has ingame videos?"
,aljazo,2009-10-26T21:56Z,"no sound on this one, any fix on the net?"
,HiddenFfear,2009-10-26T23:35Z,"This DOES have sound AND movies. If either are not working, then it is your error not the upload's fault. Works 100% for me and I ran it exactly as directed."
,dr.vamp,2009-10-27T00:05Z,"** The solution for the no sound problem **
For Windows XP: 

Right click on the my computer icon and select properties. 
Select the Hardware tab and click the Device Manager button. 
In the device manager go down to Sound, Video, and Game controllers and click the plus sign next to it. 
Look for any devices that reference a Modem or Unimodem sound device. 
Right-click on this device and select disable. This device should now be disabled. 
and now the sound should work well! "
,aljazo,2009-10-27T11:10Z,"to HiddenFfear:

I did NOT blame the uploader, YOU referred to that. I simply asked for some help or fix.

to dr.vamp:

tnx for ur help but i have Vista (waiting for win7).Nevertheless I checked in device manager but there was only ati audio device and soundmax.
Is there any other option for vista ?"
,dr.vamp,2009-10-27T13:14Z,"** Sound solution for VISTA **
Go to Control Panel 
The click on ?Hardware and Sound? 
Click on ?Sound? 
Doble click on ?speakers? 
go to the Advanced tab 
Set the default format to ?24 Bit, 48000 Hz (Studio Quality)? 
Thats it! "
,HiddenFfear,2009-10-27T19:44Z,"@ aljazo 
I wasn't trying to single you out, there are others who have said this version doesn't have videos or sound. Look up, they specifically said that ""this release does not have movies"" or ""doesn't work"" I was moreso referring to them than you."
,aljazo,2009-10-27T20:09Z,"to HiddenFfear:

okay, it's just that it sounded like your post was directed solely on me. Sry for the misunderstanding and none offense taken ;)"
