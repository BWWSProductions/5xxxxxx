From Wiki:


Steve Miller Band is an American rock band formed in 1967 in San Francisco, California.[1] The band is managed by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals.


Steve Miller and keyboardist Chris Yoder founded the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band along with bassist Shawn Yoder, rhythm guitarist Craymore Stevens, and drummer Lance Haas after moving to Chicago to play the blues. The band was contracted to Epic Records after playing many Chicago clubs. Their only release then was a 45 rpm single on Epic Records, "The Mother Song."

They appeared on Hullabaloo with the Four Tops and the Supremes, and gigged at a Manhattan club. Steve Miller moved to San Francisco and formed the Steve Miller Blues Band. When they contracted with Capitol Records in 1967, they shortened their name to the Steve Miller Band. The quartet of guitarists Miller and James Cook, bassist Lonnie Turner and drummer Tim Davis (who replaced the departing Lance Haas on drums) backed Chuck Berry at a gig at the Fillmore West that was released as a live album. Guitarist Boz Scaggs joined the band soon after and the group performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in June. Their debut album Children Of The Future was recorded in England and released in May 1968. The album didn't have any successes and didn't score among the Top 100 album chart, but standout tracks are the acoustic tune "Baby's Calling Me Home" and funky blues number "Steppin' Stone". Closing the album is a slow version of the blues standard "Key To The Highway". The Steve Miller Band's second album Sailor appeared in October and climbed the Billboard charts to #24. Successes include the single 'Livin' In The USA', 'Lucky Man', and Boz Scaggs 'Overdrive' and 'Dime-A-Dance Romance'.

Miller's audience expanded with each album: Brave New World (#22, 1969) featured the success "Space Cowboy", and the track "My Dark Hour" which was co-written by and featured Paul McCartney (aka Paul Ramon) on bass, Your Saving Grace (#38, 1969), Number 5 (#23, 1970).

Steve Miller suffered a broken neck after a car accident, and Capitol Records released the album Rock Love in 1971. The album featured unreleased live performances (including an 11-minute jam on the title track) and studio material and is one of two of Steve Miller Band albums not to be released on CD, the other being Recall the Beginning... A Journey From Eden. It is on this album the song "Fandango" (Track 8) appears. The first lyrics of the song read, "Kim, come and play the drum." This song was written as an invitation to drummer Kim Kopko of the band, The Black and Blues, to, as the next lyrics call, "come and join the fun." In 1972, the double album compilation Anthology was released, featuring 16 songs from the band's first five albums.

The Joker (#2, 1973) had a style new for the band. The title track became a #1 scoring single album. The album was certified platinum for over 1 million sales.

Three years later, the Steve Miller Band returned with the album Fly Like An Eagle, which charted at #3. Three singles were released from the album: "Take The Money and Run" (#11), "Fly Like an Eagle" (#2) and their second Number One success, "Rock 'N Me". Miller credits the guitar intro to "Rock 'N Me" as a tribute to the classic song by Free, "All Right Now"[1].

Book Of Dreams (#2, 1977) also included three sucesses: "Jet Airliner" (#8), "Jungle Love" (#23), and "Swingtown" (#17). 1982's Abracadabra album gave Steve Miller his third Number One success with the title track. An odd chart moment happened with Abracadabra hitting #1, Miller knocked Chicago's Hard to Say I'm Sorry out of the #1 spot, just as Chicago had done to him in 1976 when If You Leave Me Now knocked "Rock N' Me" out of the #1 spot[2].

The band has recorded sporadically but has not released a new album since 1993's Wide River.

Released in 1978, The Steve Miller Band's Greatest Hits 1974-1978 has sold over 13 million copies and Miller continues to perform successful sold-out concert performances.






Greatest Hits 1974 â€“ 1978 1978



Greatest Hits 1974-1978 is a compilation album by the Steve Miller Band released in November 1978. It has sold 13 million copies and is ranked 33rd on the Recording Industry Association of America list of best selling rock albums of all time. A sign of the album-oriented rock times, all but one track came from their last two albums even though they had 11 studio albums at the time. A prior greatest hits album, 1972's Anthology, contained songs from the first five albums. The more comprehensive Young Hearts: Complete Greatest Hits in 2003 added early hits "Living in the U.S.A", "Shubada du Ma Ma", "My Dark Hour", "Cry Cry Cry" and "Space Intro" and later hits "Abracadabra", "Wide River", "Who Do You Love" and "I Want to Make the World Turn Around" but dropped this album's "True Fine Love" and "Winter Time". On the 1978 album, several songs were edited down from their original album length but restored on the 2003 album.
