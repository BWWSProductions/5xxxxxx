,Huntzberger,2010-06-29T02:37Z,Is this a real surround mix (done using the original multitrack tapes) or an UPMIX (DIY surround effect)?
,CompuTerror,2010-07-19T17:48Z,It was probably an Upmix.
,CompuTerror,2010-07-19T17:52Z,It is an upmix. I don't even know if there's an SACD or DTS of Scary Monsters.
