Release date: October, 21 2009 (10/21/09)


n-Track Studio is an audio & MIDI multitrack recorder that turns your computer 
into a full-fledged recording studio. You can record, playback, overdub just like 
with a tape multitrack recorder, but you can exploit the flexibility and power of 
today's PCs for applying effects, realtime input processing, automated aux channels
sends and returns, destructive and non-destructive wave editing. The program 
supports 24bit-192 khz recording, multiple channels soundcards, live input 
processing, mp3 encoding and much more.

n-Track Studio - a full-featured multitrack audiostudiya, allowing you to create 
your own professional-quality musical compositions. n-Track Studio works with most 
audio formats, allows to impose all sorts of effects on each track with listening 
in real time, to work with channels, correct synchronization, etc. In addition to 
these standard effects like Reverb, Compression, EQ, Echo, Auto volume, Pitch Shift 
and Chorus, n-Track Studio allows you to use DirectX and VST 2.0 plug-ins from 
third-party developers.

  (Shows a realtime representation of the routing of audio signals in the audio 
  engine, enables to intuitively alter signal routing parameters and connections)
- Support for Wave64 file format (Support for wave files that have length that 
  exceeds the 2 Gb limitation of regular .wav files, using either .wav or .w64 
  extensions)

  Microsoft .Net' setting in Preferences/Option can be disabled so that n-Track

  waveform). Volume adjustment is visually to waveform
- Dragging a waveform beyond the end loops the wave file

  default skin image file

- Mixer Sliders customization based on slider type: "Track_Audio", "Track_MIDI", 
  "Master", "Aux", "Group", "Instrument", "ReWire", "Surround_Output" with

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
