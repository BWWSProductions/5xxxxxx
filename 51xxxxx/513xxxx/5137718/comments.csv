what's your opinion on Ubuntu? Have you tried ever tried any linux distro's before?"
,agov,2009-12-08T00:43Z,"Hello Robby! Many thanks for your aid so far! - In this case the serials were not accepted, ""been circulating among pirates"" as a ticket told. A pity!  "
[V],RobbingHood,2009-12-14T14:58Z,"@agov 

Of course the serials won't work if you let the program connect to the homeserver. All serials are working, so that's not he problem."
,niko10n,2009-12-22T17:58Z,thx m8
,joshlance,2010-01-03T10:01Z,Serial Numbers not working. It is detected as a pirated Serial Number. Even after disconnecting the internet
,_snails_,2010-03-06T06:22Z,"due, nice. Most people don't give such good instructions included. Thanks!"
,ToneZone,2010-03-23T01:34Z,Cockblocked with the serial numbers.  Disconnected and received the pirate message. :(
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-23T20:25Z,"@everyone claiming the seirals are broken

They ARE NNOOOOTT BROKEN!  You are just idiots and tried installing while connected to the internet.  If you READ the readme it told you to disconnect all internet access.  I used the very last 2 and they still work as of 5/23/2010."
,svenommel,2010-07-20T20:34Z,"i blocked al.exe in the mainfolder.

,svenommel,2010-07-20T20:38Z,can i block a whole pad now i only blocked the exe
[V],Kuthumi,2011-06-16T11:10Z,"Thank you! This still works if you follow the simple instructions in the ReadMe file. The point is to disconnect your Internet connection completely. Otherwise, the installation process will register your IP automatically with the manufacturer. 
If you are connected with a cable, simply pull out the plug. If you have a wireless modem, pull out the plug to the modem. Or open the Internet connection icon (the double small blue computers at bottom-right on your screen) and disconnect it.
The program will say that a new version is available. DO NOT DO THIS, select it to NEVER check again (bottom of scroll bar) and exit.
Then restart the program at check that it works.
Finally, restart your Internet connection.
The 'new version' sequence will also register your IP with the manufacturer and make it impossible with a new installation from the same IP.
The same procedure applies to many other pirated programs, especially AnyDVD."
,Lochan,2011-08-30T17:10Z,"ok,i installed with internet connection at first.but after serial being pirated message,i uninstall.registry deleted ,internet disconnected ,ip changed as well,and install but same message ""serial being pirated"" pops everytime on second time installisation.Any Solution?"
