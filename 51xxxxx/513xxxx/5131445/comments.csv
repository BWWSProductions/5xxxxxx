,pro_torr,2010-09-12T19:14Z,"For those of you who do not know, you should download a player called MPCStar. It grants you all available video/audio codecs. Also, if you don't want to do that, you can download an audio converter the Switch Sound Audio Converter from NCH Software. It converts anything to anything and vice versa. "
