i started trying to collect season 5 and 6 to build the full season but a lot of the episode i found were very bad quality - unwatchable infact :("

I really appreciate your effort and wish that I had, (or could find), the other seasons you're missing."

I have quite a few episodes however they are sporadic in nature and not of a standard quality. I would be more than willing to host some if you could get me additional seasons I have 2mb up and could dedicate most of that to said service. Let me know man."
