Muchas gracias!"
,dutflip,2009-11-16T03:06Z,"well its well presente how we produce the wood but the why we do it like that its a bit confuse ... in my opinion there is 2 reason why we have to produice food this way.
the frist is that cosumer ask for the best product at the lowest cost as possible, but if you think about it naturly grow food have a cost and we have to accepte it and the other reason it a bit crual but its also very true is that we are way to many humain to produce food the natural way"
[T],dramacore,2009-11-19T19:43Z,"this was really good overall, but they should have given people more down to earth ways of solving the problem on their own.  not just, be a giant business selling organic to walmart.  what happens when you get pushed around by the big hand that feeds?

people themselves should be taught about sustainable gardening or something they do on their own.  

good watch and upload, thanks"

You do what you're able to do within the confines of this corrupt system. 

You have no freedom. 

The only freedom you have is what your purchasing power allows you to have.

The more things you learn, the more information you have, the more choices you will see. "
,jsm2007,2009-11-26T02:17Z,Thanks. Pls upload more documentaries!
,ivan001,2009-11-29T13:15Z,"""watch penn & teller bullshit's episode on organic food after you watch this for a reality check.""
I second that! 
There as over 6 billion people in the world, there is no ""sustainable"" way to do anything anymore specially regarding food production.
A good start is to take measures to decrease the population with things like birth control, exterminating hippies, etc :)"
,stimulation,2009-12-01T03:28Z,thanks for the u/l :) will seed.
,cosmicbdog,2009-12-09T06:36Z,"@amsterdom Watching documentaries is not a new hippie movement - its a new hollywood movement. Hippies have been watching documentaries all along.

yo @robstello, nice preach on anti preaching

thanks for the upload.

i agree with @dermal - people learn to grow stuff.. there's no such thing as a pizza tree. half the people who want anarchy and systems to fall or whatever would try and put a can in the ground and grow it if things collapsed. 

one thing we know is that big enough companies with enough money will do what they can to hold a monopoly - like corn farmers. or meat industries that know their practices are putrid try to make it illegal for people to even be aware? that shit is fucked up. 

trust yourself... start growing at least SOME food. its the most obvious thing. it is balcony or back yard terrorism to big corporations."

Thank you uploader, been waiting for this one! ""

anyone so easily led is hardly an endorsement. documentaries can be propaganda, and slanted. never take anything at face value esp from an activist documentary.  the saddest bit are the ignorant sheep that given a little knowledge become dangerous. they are the ones that become so enthusiastic after watching a ""documentary"" because their base knowledge so so lacking."
