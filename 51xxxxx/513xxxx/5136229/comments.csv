My favourites, off-hand, include his recollections about being swindled by the Arab peddler who sold him a fossil of 'copulating trilobites' and how excited he was at such an 'earth-shaking' find, and his reminiscences about his first pet, the Fire Salamander, who contrary to popular belief cannot live in fire. ;-)  Good to have them all collected together in mp3 format. Hope he finds time to share more of his memories with us."
