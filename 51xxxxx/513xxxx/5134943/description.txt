Description:
Fall Of The Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the US economy by design. Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced by a new global currency.

President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1 Section 9 of the US Constitution by seating himself at the head of United Nationsâ€™ Security Council, thus becoming the first US president to chair the world body.

A scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide; an iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.

A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.

The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the worldâ€™s savior; he is the Trojan Horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.

This film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power elite have in store for humanity. More importantly it communicates how We The People can retake control of our government, turn the criminal tide and bring the tyrants to justice.

TODAY is the release of â€œFall of the Republicâ€ â€” please visitor PRISONPLANET.TV and help spread this film right away. Life, liberty and the fate of this nation are at all stake.
Fall Of The Republic is just one of many tools that will aid the planet in waking from its collective slumber and coming to the understanding that if we donâ€™t stop this agenda in its tracks now, a never-ending dark age for humanity could once again envelop the world and make our current problems look like a relative utopia in comparison with what the global elite have planned for us over the next 100 years.
