,daniilthethird,2009-10-22T17:08Z,"two questions:
1. why no seeds?
2. what do you mean ""Protection: Wave 4
""? New wave?"
,ReaL_BadMaN,2009-10-22T17:10Z,itÂ´s here.
[T],Sunblock.,2009-10-22T17:25Z,"I should not boot. You need the ""activate.iso"".

One shot boot mode allows you to boot a Wave X or non stealth game by using the activate.iso disk as a flag.
 Just insert the activate disc and the next disc inserted will boot without any strict checks. This will still utilise
 full stealth if available. As soon as that disc is booted the flag is cleared, and you will have to re-insert the activate disk 
again to enable one shot boot. As always use with caution.


burn Activate.iso to Dual Layer + R Media (this is vital for later firmwares). Simply burn it with no layerbreak settings, 
with all data present on first Layer, IMGBurn 2.5.0.0 will do this fine just 
select the ISO and confirm you want to burn to a large capacity disc with all data present on L0 

Tell me if need it i can share.

,MQFPLO,2009-10-22T23:08Z,"iXtreme 1.5 or - : stealth like WAVE 3

iXtreme 1.51: burn and play like WAVE 3

iXtreme 1.6: Activate.iso like loader."
[T],Sunblock.,2009-10-22T23:51Z,"Looks like we were wrong in assuming that iXtreme v1.51 was fully compatible with 4th Wave PFI/Video. Turns out that only Hitachi iXtreme v1.51 will boot 4th Wave backups, and BenQ/LiteOn/Samsung iXtreme v1.51 will NOT boot 4th Wave. It would have been fully compatible if only the Video data had changed but not with the change in PFI (capacity). So currently the only safe option for booting 4th Wave backups on a BenQ/LiteOn/Samsung drive is to use iXtreme v1.6 and the one shot boot disc."

,emto,2009-10-23T19:41Z,"If you don't play online and just want to run it, is it possible to patch the game? So I don't need to swap dvds to play."
,ShinoBoy,2009-10-23T22:01Z,"So to clarify, in order to run this (wave 4) game on an iXtreme 1.6 machine, we need to:
 - Download/burn 'activate.iso'
 - Pop in the activate disc
 - after that boots, insert the Tekken disc

After that I'm confused....will it run, or will the activate disc need to be re-inserted for some reason (trying to make sense of Sunblock's post...""and you will have to re-insert the activate disk again to enable one shot boot. "")

Can someone please confirm the process, and if it works? Thanks!"
,daniilthethird,2009-10-23T22:23Z,"i'm on iXtreme 1.5. i've patched the game with ppf-o-matic but it asks me for some update. i google this but can't find any answer.
can somebody help?"
,zogulusnig,2009-10-24T01:01Z,"Can anyone describe how to burn a DVD+R DL without a layer break on a Mac (OS 10.6.1).

I have, and use OSx360 to burn my games, and it will let you set a custom layer break, but I have no idea how to tell it NO layer break.

Toast, of course, makes a coaster.  I also have the rest of the relevant OS X tools at my disposal, if another app would do this better/easier.

Thanks in advance for any help."
,Nonmortale,2009-10-24T02:55Z,I have the same problem as daniilthethird. After I have patched the game it asks to do the recent update. The usual stuff but what's unusual then it goes about unreadable disk. Spent 3 DVD on the 4th wave.
,john5246,2009-10-24T03:09Z,"Ok, so let me get this straight: 

Wave 4 games will not load with iExtreme 1.6 without some kind of work-around until a new version of iExtreme is released CORRECT? 

What is activate.iso? Is it like a boot-loader that I used for burnt dreamcast games?"
,ShineEyes,2009-10-24T06:20Z,"Actually that's a good way to describe the activation disc.  It does something totally different, but it works in practically the same way.  Just burn that disc and you can play any Wave 4 games you want on iXtreme 1.6"
,daniilthethird,2009-10-24T08:19Z,"sorry for the last question. solve it myself. now playing and happy). if anyone have the same problem:
download last update from XBL (without game in your xbox))). /or/ download it from for example http://update.xboxmarketplace.ru (you need the last one - 2.0.8507.0 New Xbox Experience) and install it with CD or flash. I did it the second way. 
Good gaming"
,sammaful,2009-10-24T10:18Z,any ideas or info on a release date for a ixtreme 1.61 or 1.7 
,tomoxicillin,2009-10-24T13:57Z,"Hey here is an idea. instead of being impatient and wasting disks screwing with your xbox360 and attemptiing to play ""fixed"" games by fooling it to think its wave 3. the ativate .iso thing works for hitachi drives and on fw 1.6 all others are screwed and even at that using the activate .iso method and going online will get you banned period. google it  so instead of being impataint just download the game and wait a week thats all it took last time for the new firm ware and for one week of waiting you wont brick a drive or get banned tring to do something stupid because right now microsoft is on a banning spree you have been warned"
,luxusmuxus,2009-10-24T16:43Z,i hope new ixtreme comes soon...modern warfare 2!!!
,Douche88,2009-10-24T23:24Z,"Are you kidding me?  Shit, not another wave of games, I just paid a guy to get me the latest firmware so i could play wave 3 games...  AND NOW like a month after THERES ALREADY A WAVE4!?

Well, I guess im simply gonna have to learn how to do it myself since the waves are changing so fast.  No way im paying for every freakin new wave..."
,ShinoBoy,2009-10-25T03:34Z,"Can someone please confirm if this works (offline) on iXtreme 1.6 using the 'activate.iso'.  

Does it still require some update as previously mentioned, and does this update come on the disc or have to get it seperate? 

Finally, will said update mess around with my third-party (Datel) memory card?  I've read that MS will stop any ""unauthorized"" memory cards using the newest update....and I obviously don't want to install it if it means my memory card is rendered useless :(  Anyone by chance know? "
,ShinoBoy,2009-10-25T14:12Z,"Thanks for the clarification, beaver!"
,LeSet,2009-10-26T01:53Z,"The game worx without the harddrive or memorycard = no update.

1. Boot the X360 with tekken (No harddrive or MC)
2. Start the game, when the tekken screen shows up, put the MC in the machine, now you can play and save the game, however you can't use the HD, but that doesn't matter.

I agree, this game is a HUGE dissapointment!

CRAP!"
,RaLe626,2009-10-26T20:03Z,"Can someone out there convert wave 4 games to wave 3 and upload them like that ?
It's much to ask but it's the only thing left right now :)."
,ShinoBoy,2009-10-27T14:59Z,"RaLe626, looks like there is a file on TPB that converts to wave 3.  Search for ""Tekken 6 wave 4 to wave 3 rsrs 100% perfect By Ferraresi"".

It's much smaller, and probably faster to download this file and then the 200meg convert file.  Apparently it works."
