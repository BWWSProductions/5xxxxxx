[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-01T19:26Z,"@conger86 

See the included Readme!.text file: 

Installation notes:
***************

- Disconnect internet during installation, and/or make sure to NOT let the prog 
  connect to internet (block unwanted connections by using e.g. a firewall).

- After installation copy the cracked .exe into the install directory of AVS 
  (to have it replaced with the original .exe).
  Default installation path --> C:\Program Files\AVS4YOU\AVSVideoConverter6

Done!

NOTE: Do NOT update the program!


...... Or should I come over to do it?"
,conger86,2010-01-02T01:38Z,thanks RobbingHood. much appreciated. no need to come over

,Video_Veg,2010-01-05T03:11Z,"Downloaded and installed OK, but can't comment on results yet since I am using it for first time - 5 HOURS to convert DVD to AVI ! 
Important also that you download and install decrypter program DVD43 first if you need to convert protected disks.
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/dvd43.htm
This last utility will allow other programs (including Windows apps) to copy encoded disks."

[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-19T19:42Z,"@ggun

Just try the Help option of the program or the website of AVS. You can't expect people to explain the very basics (all the time)."

,Babylon9000,2010-01-20T23:20Z,Hi just wanted to say I downloaded this file a few months back it worked fine. Got a new PC and downloaded again last night. Today I tried to use it and it tells me its a trial version. I disconnected internet during install and still didn't work. I dunno maybe I did something wrong but just wanted to give you all a heads up.

,theuseddj420,2010-05-16T03:17Z,"this video converter totally blows!!!!! if u want to wait 2-3 hours to convert 1 700mb size movie file. if you want a faster converter get winAVI, its ten times better than this piece of shit!!!!!!"
,Derragon,2010-05-17T01:05Z,"@theuseddj420
How about you learn to build a better computer that isn't using a Pentium D, or an Athlon64 Dual Core? Or better yet, how about you research why your computer is converting things slowly and don't advertise another video converter on a torrent that is for this one? If you have a problem with the converter, the most likely issue is that you're an idiot and don't understand the fact that VIDEOS TAKE A LONG TIME TO CONVERT. It's not going to happen in 10 seconds."
,puroy,2010-05-18T14:02Z,"SIMPLY THE BEST CONVERTER I'VE EVER USED!!! IT DOES THE JOB SEAMLESSLY. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TORRENT, AND THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT UPLOAD ROBBINGHOOD!!!"

,BloodZero,2010-07-05T05:18Z,"Worms like a charm. Just follow the ""Readme!.txt"" instructions.
Strangely though, it didn't even try to connect to the internet during installation here (COMODO Firewall didn't detect anything).
Oh, just one thing. When converting, set the convertion priority to 'Below Normal' or it'll slow down your PC. It eats your CPU usage! Well, at least it did here (Intel Core i5 750).
Thanks for the upload!"
,Rovelius,2010-07-07T17:57Z,"This is a great software, I've been using it for a while now. You can take pretty much any video and turn into 1080p HD with just a few clicks... and the crack works 100% on Windows 7 64-bits. Thanks"
,harpersneil,2010-09-08T07:07Z,"Outstanding upload as always RobbingHood; my sincerest thanks! :)

Only comment I might make about this one (and perhaps this is just me being a total moron), but it wasn't clear to me which file it was I supposed to replace. After I figured it out, it seemed obvious, but it mightn't be so obvious to most newbies.

Again though, thank you. This is a first class crack and I have found with all your uploads."
