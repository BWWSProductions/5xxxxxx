,hwaire,2009-10-31T03:16Z,I patched with ABGX360 burned at 4x speed and used the one shot boot disc on my xbox360 it plays but as your driving real fast or any sudden turns the game loses its streets they just disappear then reappear after awhile any help

,briley,2009-11-01T07:34Z,"little fix for your CRCs if you still got the file, firstly remove (not delete) the file from your torrent app, then start the dl from the other Grand.Theft.Auto.Episodes.From.Liberty.City.XBOX360-MARVEL.

now copy that name from your file location, and it should be called Grand.Theft.Auto.Episodes.From.Liberty.City.XBOX360-MARVEL.[www.whateveritwas.com]

after this copy the [www.whateveritis.com] from the new one to the old one, then remove the torrent and start it again, if your apps and good like utorrent, it will check over the file and fix it accordingly with minimal downloading. couldnt let my time and bandwidth go to waste, so i played around. now it works. neato. hope it helps"
,briley,2009-11-01T07:35Z,can i just rephase the importance not the delete the files at any point just remove from the torrent app
,Blayn3,2009-11-01T17:18Z,"Thanks for that fix, Briley.
I downloaded the first torrent twice, thinking it was one of my hard drives or something."
,SMUPE,2009-11-02T04:30Z,"When I put the disk in my xbox, it recognizes it as a dvd and says play dvd.  when i press play, it just shows the xbox logo and stays like that.  All of my other burned games work fine but I have burned it to two different disks and I can't get it to work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."
