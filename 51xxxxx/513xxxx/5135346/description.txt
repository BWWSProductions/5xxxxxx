Originally from Vancouver B.C. and signed by Chad Kroeger of Nickelback to his 604 Records label (where the band is still signed in Canada), Theory is following up a very successful sophomore album cycle (GASOLINE) that included the huge radio hits "Santa Monica," "No Surprise" and "Hello Lonely."

Theory are road dogs and expect to be on the road for 2 years straight to support their new album SCARS & SOUVENIRS. The balanced 13-track effort is the polished and passionate testament to seven years of hard work, heavy touring and diligent attention to its craft. From the swirling grinds of the first single "So Happy" to the soaring melodicism of "Not Meant to Be" and "By The Way," "Scars & Souvenirs" is a broad-reaching endeavor that puts singer/guitarist Tyler Connolly, guitarist Dave Brenner and bassist Dean Back high in the rock pantheon, achieving creative growth without sacrificing the hard-hitting power that got them here in the first place.

"It's the Scars & Souvenirs of your life," Connolly explains. "The songwriting on the record is really about someoneâ€™s past or and present, their relationships and how they shape everything. Itâ€™s more metaphorical than physical scars and trophies.Weâ€™re just a hard-working band, man. We want to be out there for a couple of years and play these songs to everybody we possibly can." Tyler also contributed guitar and appeared in the video for Chad Kroegerâ€™s #1 smash hit "Hero," the theme song to the massive Spider-Man movie.
