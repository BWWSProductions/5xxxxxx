,NoGimmics,2011-07-07T20:00Z,"how come on all these games when i download them and it says press finish to exit setup, the game doesnt start and isnt in my files?"
,abib07,2011-10-19T14:17Z,I also have the same problem with NoGimmics
,bearclaw01234,2011-11-25T10:43Z,"NoGimmics & abib07, something most of us Pirates know from experience - BEFORE ye download, make sure to TURN OFF your Anti-Virus program to make sure that it does not conflict with the incoming download (some AV's=AntiVirus like AVG AV will delete some files that think are viruses when really they are not).  also, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements for the game (better to exceed the minimum requirements), that could also be the problem.  i hope this helps."
