Film Info
~~~~~~~~~~

Come aboard as the VBS crew takes a cruise to the Northern Gyre in the Pacific Ocean, a spot where currents spin and cycle, churning up tons of plastic into a giant pool of chemical soup, flecked with bits and whole chunks of refuse that cannot biodegrade.

This is the three-part portion of the web show 'Toxic' that deals with the so-called garbage island, more info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch

You can watch it online here: http://www.vbs.tv/watch/toxic/toxic-garbage-island-1-of-3 (though it has adverts about every five minutes >:|). 

Personally though, this show is bullshit. If you're looking to find a good source to learn about the Eastern Garbage Patch, this sure as fuck ain't it. This crap feels more like a half-assed video travelogue recorded by some dumbass kids, with no more than five (and more like two) minutes per episode actually devoted to the plastic crisis, with the other time being wasted on stupid shit like the narrator getting a scopolamine patch for his sea sickness or some such douchebaggery.

Rip Info
~~~~~~~~~~

This was ripped from the webstream at the aforementioned URL...which was more involved than it sounds. Their broadcast splits each episode up into ~70 individual mp4 files. I ripped them all, merged them into one file per episode (and double-checked to make sure no segments were duped or missing), and then converted them to the more friendly XviD. The runtimes are a few seconds shorter than the ones on the site because the copyright notice isn't in these rips, but none of the content is missing. 

The quality is, let's say, way better than your average y-outube rip but slightly worse than a PDTV rip, and there's also a 'VBS.TV' watermark in the top-right corner of the frame. 

Enjoy.
