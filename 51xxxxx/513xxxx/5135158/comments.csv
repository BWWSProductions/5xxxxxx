,LeGra,2009-12-11T20:11Z,"Attn: ANTH202
You have to watch Cubase as it scans your plugins.  When it crashes on a plugin, you have to figure out WHAT plugin crashed it and then remove that plugin til you can get Cubase Up and Running.  All OLD plugins do not play well with new software."

,refusew,2009-12-15T04:52Z,So I'm assuming by reading comments that this won't work with Windows 7 x64? Can someone direct me to a torrent that will?
,Chuffy,2009-12-15T17:36Z,"@refusew:

All I can say is that the ""Steinberg.Cubase.v5.1.DVDR-AiRISO"" torrent works for me under Win 7 64 bit, despite what someone keeps saying in the comments there.

Cubase is one of those apps that gets confused easily and some problems may be a result of it being installed somewhere other that the default directory or previous attempts to install it elsewhere. Other problems might be related to remnants of old versions of Cubase on your system. Yet more problems could come from older Syncrosoft dongle emulators that already reside on your PC, though I'm just guessing.

If you do have trouble, I suggest you install Windows 7 64 on a VirtualBox or VMWare machine and see if cubase installs and works on that. If it works, then your most reliable option is to reinstall Windows (i.e., a clean install) and try again."
,holywoodj,2009-12-17T15:42Z,"The program works! No crashes as of yet unlike Cubase 4. Seems I always have to mount the image though. Still, I'm not complaining. Brilliant Torrent."
,lowballz,2009-12-18T04:09Z,"for those having sound playback problems with this try this, it worked for me.

\\ This is for those running windows 7 64 //

First download and install the app as normal, the program should work, only problem is you can hear no sound, even though you have your sound devices set up properly.

Exit cubase, 
locate your audio driver
Right click your audio driver device and open ""properties""
Click compatibility
Run in compatibility with Windows XP SP2

Do the same thing again only this time with your cubase app

Open cubase, set sound devise and viola, it should work"

,nitrolord,2009-12-20T03:00Z,"Thanks for this, I am running Vista 32bit and this works perfectly!!! 

After installation and a re-start  my Cubase Sx3 stopped working, seems to be a conflict with the dongle emulators. Anyway Sx3 is redundant once you have this, so just un-install it and enjoy the new toy.

Keep the ISO image mounted as Cubase looks for it when you start the program, that's it.

If you are having problems running Cubase 5, you are making a mistake, because this runs perfectly.  

Thanks again"
,nitrolord,2009-12-20T11:10Z,"Sorry for my previous comment, there is no need to keep the image mounted. When I start Cubase 5, I receive the error message, ""Cubase5.exe - Drive Not Ready""  I thought this was the program looking for the disc, but its not. If you get this message, just cancel it a couple of times and Cubase will start normally. Seems to be a windows problem and not a problem with the program itself."

For people using Vista 64, it works perfectly.

Here's what I had to do to get the program to run correctly:

1) I downloaded the torrent. It is in .iso format.

2) I use deamon tools le to mount. Just open DT and choose the .iso. That's it.

3) Go to ""Computer"" and choose the Cubase ""CD""

4) Install to the default directory. At the first prompt DE-CHECK ""Install Track presets for HALion Symphonic Orchestra""

5) It installs, but it got stuck on a dos-like screen for HALionOne. Close it and the installer continues from there.

DON'T INSTALL THE EMULATOR (found in iso in the \Install folder. It's named c5emu.exe)

6) Go to http://www.steinberg.net/index.php?id=1782&L=1 to install the update from 5.1 to 5.1.2

7) Install the above mentioned emulator

8) find the update for the emulator and download it. It's called ""Steinberg.Cubase.v5.1.2.UPDATE.READNFO-AiR.rar"" Not gunna link this. Just google it and find it. Mine was legit. make sure the name matches.

I am having the same exact problem, and I'm on x86 bit. I have to go into the iso manually and start it, and the screen comes up, then when I hit any key it closes and nothing happens.

Any advice? Other people having same problem?"

Running windows 7 62 bit- installed cubase PERFECT.  program runs PERFECT.

have tried to install VST plugins. (battery , sylenth1)
they install in to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steinberg\VSTPlugins

everything goes fine. but when i run cubase. it is just like they do not exist. Cant find any where to select them. they are not in vst plugin manager. NOTHING?

tried Jbridge- followed instructions. patched .dlls to ""64 bit""

Still. nothing.  i would be more happy if i could at least see that cubase is reading them, and the VST;s were crashing or something... am i missing some obvious step here?

,distill,2010-06-02T14:48Z,"For those who say it works great: Are you really serious? I've been trying to use this for months now, it'll crash once in every 30 minutes or so. When just doing some simple things like stretching audio blocks.

Mostly I've used the AiR 5.1.2 (= 5.1.1) version with its dongle emu. No cigar. So - if it works for you, is it REALLY crash-free for hours of use?

I'm using Windows 7. Before installing Cubase 5 I uninstalled all previous Steinberg apps and deleted any synsoacc.* files. Is this crack approved or even done by Steinberg itself? It would make sense, this is a very good way to promote the software."

,suppjunkie,2010-12-18T23:11Z,"seriously other people have asked the same question as me and it hasn't been answered, why is it after the file is mounted and i run the setup the cmd box appears and just says ""enjoy this team AiR release"" and then asks me to press any key to continue, which i do, and then nothing happens....

,suppjunkie,2010-12-23T21:35Z,"Team AiR would you PLEASE answer my question above? Others have asked the same thing and there's not one answer. Seriously I'm grateful for the torrent but it's useless to a lot of people unless you help with inevitable technical problems.
The setup seems to run fine but then the cmd prompt box comes up, just says ""Enjoy this team AiR release. Press any key to continue"" which I do, at which point it vanishes, and then nothing happens... Any help? "

,suppjunkie,2010-12-24T00:45Z,"Ok so I have a different problem, I didn't install the dongle emu first so maybe thats y it wasn't working for me?

Internal error: An attempt was  made to expand the ""app"" constant before it was initialized

Help anyone? Completely lost..."
,suppjunkie,2010-12-24T01:38Z,"I have FINALLY gotten this to work! Right...

To any1 who was having my problem, here's what you need to do:

Don't use powerISO or windows image burner thing or winRAR.

download and use Daemon Tools Lite, I did, restarted my computer as it say you need to if you want to install it. After I did that I used DT Lite and it works perfectly (at the moment)."
,Samuelthemad,2010-12-24T12:40Z,"@suppjunkie,

Before, I mounted it with DAEMON Tools, and nothing happend. I installed PowerISO, opened the image with it, and ran the Setup.exe file. When it asked me to press any key, I pressed a character, and everything just exited. HELP?"
,Samuelthemad,2010-12-24T17:03Z,"YES! I finnaly got it working! Here's how I did it:

Download and install DAEMON Tools lite
Mount the image in the download
Go to the Start menu>Computer
Right click ""BD-ROM Drive (H:) Cubase 5.1"" and select ""Open in new window""
Run the setup file to begin the installation and follow the steps."

,ratc,2011-03-27T07:42Z,"Hello, is it safe to install the 5.5.2 update over this release, with or without the 5.1 update?
Anyone tried it yet? "
,ratc,2011-03-28T12:52Z,"I tried to update to 5.5.2 over this release but no luck, gives error when launching Cubase, just to warn anyone out there trying.
Also, running ""setup.exe"" alone did nothing for me when installing, had to click the ""cubase5.msi"" to run the install.
After install (as sugested by team Air), I ran the ""c5emu.exe"" to avoid the ""Synsonacc.Dll missing file"" warning. 
I also noticed that I had no ""OK"" or ""Cancel"" buttons when adding an audio track or instrument, but after running the ""cubase patch 510.msp"" it solved the problem for me. Strangely, Cubase was already telling me it was version 5.1, even though I had never ran the patch before. Now all is working fine :)"

,simonjonnemeth,2011-05-08T15:16Z,"I downloaded this version from somewhere else but it wasn't in an ISO, so my suggestion to those having problems installing is to extract the ISO using a compressor/extraction software (I recommend WinRAR) and simply run Setup.exe. DO NOT RUN AUTORUN.EXE, THIS NEVER WORKED FOR ME."
,slipstyle,2011-05-13T08:37Z,"Listen, if you want this to work.

1.) Then go to the hardrive where you ISO  Cubase.

2.) Go to the install folder.
