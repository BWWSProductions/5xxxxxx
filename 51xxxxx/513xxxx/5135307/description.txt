This project is a valiant attempt by Saviours to recapture the magic of NWOBHM 
and tracks such as â€˜Slave to the Hexâ€™ are certainly 
dragging their rotting carcasses into Garage Days Revisited territory. 
The end result is, however, somewhat of a let down as none of the tracks has 
that killer riff or hook which was essential to the dominance of HM as a genre 
in the 80â€™s.

Well worth investigating.
