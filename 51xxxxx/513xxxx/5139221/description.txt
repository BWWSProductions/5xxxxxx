Glenn Beck Program for October 28th 2009



Today Glenn talked about his own little "Serve.gov" thing he was going to do.


I want to be a part of it but at the same time I am a bit reluctant.

I have lost many friends due to me listening to Glenn. I know very well he is right but it has made my social life very...difficult...


What about you? Are you on board?
