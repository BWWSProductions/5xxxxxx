[T],towerelect,2009-10-25T22:06Z,What a pity you have compressed it in AVI format to the point where it looks bad on a hi def screen.   I can not use this and now will have to wait for the November Promo Only DVD.   Not everyone wants to play music video on a mobile device and bandwidth and hard drive space are no longer the problem they once were.   PLEASE try keep the quality of your uploads higher so I can use them for Video Disco Work.   Thanks!
