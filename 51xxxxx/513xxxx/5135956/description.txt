Super rare concert from Bristol, U.K. -84 with the Man, the Myth, the Legand. Ripped these clips fromand made it watchable as one movie and in avi. format for me and some friends. Thought I share it with the Rockers here on TPB. The picture quality is like anÂ´ copy of anÂ´ VHS and thatÂ´s what it is recorded on from the beginning but the raritie of it takes over. Charlie is in a good rockinÂ´ mood w. his son Bubba on leadguitar. Great sound w. slappinÂ´ bass.
