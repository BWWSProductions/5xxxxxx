,ludwignosen,2009-10-25T02:44Z,Thanks again lordmichael. And please keep checking tarpley.net over the next few days: we're about to switch the new site over there. The old site is awful and the new one will feature a blog that webster will update frequently! Also many of his lectures and interviews are available.
