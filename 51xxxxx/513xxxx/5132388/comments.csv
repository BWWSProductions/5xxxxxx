Cheers!"

,ross1701,2009-10-21T21:41Z,"Cheers for upping Rick Mercer. Much appreciated.
Shame about 22 mins. Was really getting into it. Not as good as past years but not too bad. Oh well.
Keep in mind these torrents are indexed by the likes of isohunt, btjunkie, torrentportal etc so not all of the downloads show up here.
Still, keep up the good work. Many Thanks."
[V],Ekolb,2009-10-21T21:52Z,"I have no problems uploading them, it's just didn't seem too popular per downloads.  But what I would do, is continue to upload them and see where it goes from here.  I will post yesterday's episode hopefully by tommorrow. :)"

Great quality !!!!!"

[V],Ekolb,2009-10-23T04:45Z,"Update: Little bad news, the mini USB drive I had where I had 22 minutes stored from TV Capture, well my daughter accidently erased it, so it's gone.  I couldn't find rebroadcast on CBC so I could capture it again.  In a nutshell, no 22 minutes for this week.  I am sorry, but I will continue as of next week. :("

And as well what about Nova S37E01.

THANX in advance 

and THANX for all the upload's great job"
[V],Ekolb,2009-10-23T17:40Z,"SOS which stands for Son of Shun.   They can be found at sonofshun dot com. They upload HQ HDTV with higher bit rate and big file usually in GB.  I don't know why they haven't been posting it lately.

As far as S37E01 is concerned, it was a movie like show on Darwin.  It was really boring so to speak and therefor, I didn't bother to post. lol"
