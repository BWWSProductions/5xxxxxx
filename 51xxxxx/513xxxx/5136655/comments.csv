,fourfive,2009-12-27T07:06Z,"Great torrent! very fast seeders thank you, thank you very much for posting! :) 

FLAC sound is the only way to go nowadays, mp3s just dont cut it anymore. Help spread the word! 

There are far too many uninformed, ignoramuses here on pirate bay still ripping their cds using 320kbs MP3 which is pointless unless your computer has like 200 gigs of ram, a number very low by today's standards. You can buy massive amounts of external harddrive memory for chump change. 

Heres to seeing all of the music on PB available in FLAC! This is the only true way to listen to your music! "
,OOOpsyOOO,2010-01-29T08:49Z,Thanks for a great torrent...
,Greemish,2010-01-30T20:47Z,"@fourfive

people like you should die. You just buy high amounts of memory without even knowing what they do or are. RAM is not Hard Drive space you dildo."
,peterthepiratebay,2010-05-19T11:08Z,"Nice set and since it's from Kitlope the quality is guaranteed 100%
Thanks from Turkey."

,waternut,2010-06-06T18:42Z,"Hey Greemish, I think you would feel better if you would just let us all RAM a dildo up your bloated Hard Drive! Ha Ha, you FLAC-Fag! Bet you couldn't even hear a difference! That processor between your skull is so full yourself!"

,Nerftoo,2011-11-04T23:58Z,"Please - at minimum conduct a Google search before spewing out misinformed garbage.

FLAC is in fact lossless and thus for all practical uses identical to the source. That being said, in double blind ""tests"" it is damn near impossible to distinguish from a properly encoded mp3 and a FLAC. Don't be seduced by ""full"" stereo. Joint-stereo increases quality if anything. When you set a max bit-rate while encoding essentially you allocate a finite amount of data per ""frame"".  Encoding in full stereo essentially splits that data in two - for each channel, even if said data is identical. Joint-stereo intelligently looks at each channel and encodes separate channels only where the two differ, thus saving space and allowing more data to be saved per ""frame"". More data in this case means higher quality. 

That being said, I prefer FLAC so that I can make my own conversions to mp3 from a quality source. Props to the uploader, good quality torrent."
