Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius Worst of commercial-free uncensored 64k mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56


This is the *fixed* upload with the missing minute or so for the
perfectionists out there. Also available in 128k vbr format with
slightly tighter editing. Collect the whole set!



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
