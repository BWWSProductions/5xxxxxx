,Bombardem,2009-10-29T09:16Z,"Why do the french call 'Surrogates' Clones? I mean isnt Surrogate a french word, or at least latin? Whereas Clone is old greek. Not to mention the film has nothing to do with clones at all, they are robots. There's no biological material involved at all.

Stupid French..."
,ponahoum,2009-10-29T10:35Z,I think 'clone' is robot in french and surogates mine 'substitue'
,enarth,2009-11-04T19:17Z,"surrogates is not a french word. The closest french word would be ""substitut"".

Why would they use ""clones"" then ?? i have no idea...

It not the first time... For example the movie  ""the hangover"" is ""very bad trip"" in french...

Maybe clones is supposed to work better on french people, i have to admit clones sounds better than ""substitut""... it has more bite to it."
,ponahoum,2009-11-07T09:37Z,it's only for sel more place
,ignace72,2009-12-09T02:51Z,"In fact, clones are copies to a genetic level but if it evades this point there are the robots in the movies.
Compared to substitute, in France he usually gives the sense of one who takes the place of another, who performs the duties of another, in the absence or sufficient cause, especially a magistrate charged replace flooring in the Attorney General, the prosecuting attorney.

It is also believed to generic drugs to replace those sold by large pharmaceutical companies.

I recognize that the logic of naming films in France escapes me my reason.
It does not help the search for movies here because the titles are often in VO.
I just think a translation would broadly.
There's show lost and delirious rebels who became French in the text."

When you don t know how to speak a language it s better not to leave a general comment saying that the people of a country are stupid because they used a word you don t find appropriate. However french is not only issu by latin or old greek but contain also arabic and anglo saxon word (  for your general knowledge).
Clone has different meanings, the original and scientific one is a genetic copy of a living being.
The other came by simplification and means only a perfect copy of anything living or not. Can also be use when two people say exactly the same thing . Of course the second signification come from what we call the speaked language and for the academic world the real meaning of clone is only genetic copy .
But since what time are movies dealer interested in academic language,  they just want to sell a movie that s why take the most exiting title for the customer.  With my best regards ."
