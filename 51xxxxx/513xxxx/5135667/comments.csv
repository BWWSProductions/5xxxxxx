by any chance would you have EP 4?

Also, will you be uploading the upcoming episodes?

thanks"
,lollager,2009-12-23T19:13Z,I had already uploaded S6E4 but accidentally as anonymous so it doesn't show up my torrents list. Dunno why I can't find it here anymore. But by now it's spread everywhere too. Sorry for not noticing your post earlier.
,lollager,2009-12-23T19:21Z,...and I submitted these because I found nobody else sharing the HD versions on a public tracker. I might do the same for S7 and so on if the trend continues...
