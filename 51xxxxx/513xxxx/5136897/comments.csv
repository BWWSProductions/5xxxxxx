[V],Morck22,2009-10-27T18:11Z,"Wave 4: YES
Can run on my iextreme drive: Only with Activate.iso if you want to be safe at live (forget ppf matic, patchs & other shit like that)
Differences between others uploads: This is a retail rip, it means that this wil be the game you can buy at stores on 30th october 2009. FINAL version."
,clomkfly,2009-10-28T15:06Z,"quick question.
the versions of tekken 6 that are here are non0retail versions...meaning possible banning! or is it just playing any version before the 27th?"
[V],Morck22,2009-10-28T19:00Z,"yow can be banned, cuz its not the same CRC is other kind of copy, so download a retail version to be A-live"
