- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

Here's the first cd from Jello Biafra with his new band! I guess The Melvins
are too busy now so he has a new band that features members of Faith No More,
Sharkbait, Hellworms and others. This album rules and it sounds just like
Dead Kennedys at their prime. Gotta love the title and theme of the album..
Obama was so full of shit and it's just sad that he fooled so many people.
Buy this album to support a punk icon and his great label.
