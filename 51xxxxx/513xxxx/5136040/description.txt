Winner of the prestigious Grand Prix at the 2005 Jazz A Juan Concours festival in France, and an established figure on both the jazz and popular music scenes in Korea and other Eastern territories, Youn Sun Nah comes to the Vortex for her only UK date, showcasing the talents that have made her a truly international star.

A hybrid singer who travels the boundaries of classical and jazz but also combines Korean roots with Western influences.  Her technique is astonishing, her pitch fantastic.  Her very particular timbre makes comparisons difficult.  Youn Sun Nah is a unique performer in the world's jazz scene and one of the most talented contemporary jazz vocalists.  

Her latest Voyage is a truly mature effort.  As the title suggests, it makes you travel in various places - Scandinavia, France, the United States and of course Korea. "The recording is a blend of Nordic cool and some influences from middle Europe, Brazil and Asia" declares guitarist Ulf Wakenius, the project's main sideman.  ~ JoÃ«l Chevassus at sixmoons.com
