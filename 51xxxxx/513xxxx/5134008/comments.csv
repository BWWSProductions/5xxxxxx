I can't help but wonder though why it's at 29.97 fps instead of either 24 or 23.98, since that would be what it broadcast at.  Also i was wondering why it says ""Deinterlaced"" since HD has no fields.  Just wondering is all, no means to offend."
,thejohnus,2009-12-10T09:55Z,"Crigler, you have some (all) of your facts wrong. NTSC broadcast television IS 29.97 fps. 24 fps is for film, and 23.98 is after pulldown from a telecine process. Also, broadcast HD is interlaced. It has two fields. The only HD sources that are progressive are Blu-Ray discs and some premium satellite feeds, but every terrestrial broadcast in the United States is interlaced."

,finisher489,2011-11-02T18:24Z,lol this is 1080i not 1080p!!!! That's a big difference!!! 1080i is recorded on TV Channels only and it's like 720p (some people prefer 720p to 1080i) and 1080p is basically Blu-Ray!!!! The Venture Bros Season 4 did get released on 1080p Blu-Ray so I'm going to look for a better torrent (on Bitsnoop properly because I can't find any on tpb but there might be a few more).
