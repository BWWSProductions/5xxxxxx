,kelvinpicton,2009-10-28T18:10Z,PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!
,repeater4u,2009-10-29T13:13Z,Could be wrong but this seems to be a R5. The video quality looks great but the audio sounds tinny. Only had a quick glance at it so like I said I could be wrong. Thx for the effort DUQA your files are usually spot on.
,keebs_123,2009-10-29T18:01Z,"I just got downloading this crap, sorry to be a party pooper but I just tried to watch this and well the sound works good but there is no video!!! How can I  watch a movie when there is only sound!?!?!?"
,gothambats,2009-10-29T23:24Z,"Keebs, obviously your just a Paduan learner here to the Pirate world. I bet your even naive enough to attempt to watch this on Windows Media Player. Learn from a Jedi...download VLC. It's free, and it plays any and all files you will download off the net, especially Pirate Bay. buahahahaha. Come to the dark side my young one. For only a Sith can teach you how to be a true PirateBayer."
,Rod321,2009-10-31T04:12Z,"Thanks Piratebay for many good movies.

I downloaded this movie & the AVI file plays on my computer but it will not convert using ConvertX. After going through the motions of converting it puts up a mesage about ""virtual Memory"". The vidoe files it creates don't have the ""VIDEO_TS.BUP"" files. It has a ""Muxer.Tmp"" file at the start of the video file list. This has happened with 1 other movie I have downloaded from the DUQA team but others have converted without problems. 
The other movie was: The_Taking_of_Pelham_1_2_3.[2009].PREMIERE.DVDRIP.[Eng]-DUQA.5107544.TPB. Convertex put up the same message as above & had the same oddity with the video files.

Any suggestions for a novice please??"
,foodstamps,2009-11-27T00:27Z,"Ive never had a problem ripping anything. If youre running vista or W7 just use windows dvd maker, i shit you not, that programme with convert the whole lot and you will get a quality product out of it.

If not you can use TMPgenc to convert the files then burn them with Win dvd maker or Nero

Thanks for the upload DT"
