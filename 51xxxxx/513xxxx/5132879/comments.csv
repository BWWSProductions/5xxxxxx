,azzllin,2009-10-23T13:55Z,"Fantastic, this has been sought after for ages by a lot of people, thought Spanish was going to be it until it's November DVD release.
Kudos for being the first with the English version."
,mancunia,2009-10-23T14:18Z,"for R5 the audio is excellent, overall v=8, a=7.

the people who say the audio/video is poor, see your Doc, your eyesight and hearing must be screwed. "

The audio is shit on this. It fades in and out, pops and echos. I would wait for a better copy unless you just plan on watching this on your computer with no one else."
,alex124z,2009-10-23T22:36Z,"Video is perfect. Audio is semi-decent. But the movie is certainly watchable, don't know what these other guys are smokin'. But regardless, this has to be one of THE BEST sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. This isn't like any other sci-fi movie your used to seeing. There aren't any aliens, big space battles, super rail guns, wormholes.. none of that crap. Its all about how one astronaut on the moon mining for helium-3 has to endure on his long 3 year mission. Then something very weird happens and his mission changes very fast.

One last thing.. DON'T WATCH ANY OF THE TRAILERS. They give too much of the plot away.

Watch it now.. your missing a masterpiece."
,thongo,2009-10-24T00:29Z,"The V/A ratings on here are meaningless...

Video is good, well above acceptable.

Audio however is utter crap. The music and sound effects are fine, but speech is low and jarring, and changes from low to high all the time. I was about to stop the film several times because I couldn't hear what was said."
,Krzysd,2009-10-24T01:10Z,"Amazing movie!!

for 1.19 gb video is great but the sound jumps at parts of the movie, was still able to make out what was going on though."
,weakandtired,2009-10-24T02:51Z,Saw this in the theater great movie. Funny plus good acting and music. If you like small sci-fi movies like Sunshine  you'll like this.
,rippervanwinkle,2009-10-24T03:37Z,"The video is good quality but the audio is very poor with constant echo and other artefacts.

A few people here rate the audio as very good or very good for an R5 but there's no reason an R5 should have audio this poor.  It sounds like the ripper really screwed up downmixing from multi-channel to stereo (128Kbps CBR 48KHz), that can produce these kinds of problems."
,PhilnLisa,2009-10-24T05:38Z,"Can someone please post some screens?? Really keen to watch this, but only if it's primo quality....limited Bband hence why I'm asking :)"

The audio is okay, just a little twitchy. It is nothing to prevent you from watching, just takes you out of the moment a little.
Was this film really done on a 5 mil budget? I find that hard to believe. The production quality is outstanding. The sets, lighting, cinematography, etc are all of the highest quality."

If your not into SCFI it's still worth a look.

Great video quality! And yeah, the sound does go up and down every now and then, but it's a minor problem.

Still: is it just me and my turtle-speed connection, or did it take anybody else more than twelve hours to dl?

Whatever, thx a lot MQFPLO!"

Great quality despite the exotic twist in the audio-track for a short time.

A well made Sci-Fi movie with an interesting story. A must see.

Great(!) story.  Problem with audio is that when its good, its completely ok, but when its bad its barely audible.  Seeinga as this is being such a good movie I'd recommend waiting for a release with better audio."
,redhare,2009-10-25T07:48Z,Nothing about the audio my remote couldn't fix. Thanks. Movie requires a bit of thought. Not bad at all.
,T221WA,2009-10-25T16:11Z,"Thanks dude, Great movie!"
,rayhaque,2009-10-25T17:14Z,"!! The sound on this rip is really, really messed up. !!  I don't understand how people can give an '8' rating to the audio, when the levels jump all over the place.  What the hell is wrong with you people?  The audio is broken.  That doesn't merit an 8!  Duh!

But the movie is great.  Had I known that the sound was so screwed I would have waited for the actual DVD rip.  That said, this was very well written, very well filmed, and very well directed.  Kudos to everyone involved in making this film.  This should be right up there with one of the best Sci-Fi films of all time.  

It's best to watch this with as few spoilers as possible, because the storyline is awesome."

but did enjoy the movie "
,slowmo7676,2009-10-26T03:22Z,Film looks good. But the sound is fucked up. Way to hard compression. Maybe thats where they saved money to afford the CG. Or maybe MQFPLO tryed to be crative with some audio effects.

,dlarrym,2009-10-26T07:15Z,"Great job MQFLO!! I never found the AUIDO issue where you said it drops off after a while getting softer in volume level as the movie goes on till near the end you said it gets almost mute. I didn't experience this problem?? If you are using the VLC player to watch this film, I have noticed that VLC seems to do this with several films. I USE CHROMA vs2009.1 by MIRALABS. just google the software company name i mentioned above and you will be sent to the site. It isn't free but is less them 20 bucks in US dollars. It is well worth it.
ANYWAY...I had almost abandoned the idea of finding a copy that was this damn good, then I stumbled, by accident onto this copy.... I saw this film in the theater when it came out. It was great on the big screen.  10/10 in my opinion. The video was perfect and my Audio was perfect too. Any 2001 a Space Odyssey or SILENT RUNNING, will also find this movie a 2 hrs that was well spent.!"

,jkflash,2009-10-28T01:14Z,Sound is broken. Don't bother downloading as it will frustrate the hell out of you. The sound level jumps up and down literally every second so adjusting the volume as you view is impossible. The background sounds and music overwhelm the dialogue. Don't waste your time.

I have just watched ""Silent Running"" on the recommendations in these comments and its nothing like this film!

Space ships with plant habitat dome things get called back to earth where there are no longer plants or animals, their orders are to jettison and nuke the domes. Lead actor guy / conservationist kills crew mates and buggers off on his own with 1 remaining habitat dome. After some time he gets bored and decides to nuke himself anyway, the end.
