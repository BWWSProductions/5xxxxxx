,lime195,2009-10-27T17:51Z,"most i have the ""real cars for GTA 4 v0.1 beta.exe"" v0.1-v0.2? "
,RDCMrT,2009-10-27T23:03Z,"Oké, first these cars are free to donload on www.gtainside.com and www.gtagaming.com, u just made a package. well done.

Cavalcade = Caddilac escalade (Yeah right, dont download this package, this car gives u a SMPA60 error when driving from bohan to alderney).

FXT = BMW X5 (Same shit as caddilac)

Landstalker = Toyota Landcruiser (car doesn't move, give's no error but civs and u cant drive it, it just won't move)

Maverick = Bell 206b (It seems to be crashing when shooting at the windows)

Solair = Infiniti FX45 (Same shit as Caddilac Escalade)

Washington = BMW 760i (Same shit as Caddilac Escalade)

So now i know why u say the game is crashing very often, it has nothing to do with polygons, but with wrong settings !!!

Please don't say i'm wrong because if been working on the crash fixes for a total of 8 hours to figure it out.

People who wanna mod, just go to these sites and do it by yourself, because this package is gonna fuck your GTA IV install up very well !!!"
,Madox,2009-10-27T23:58Z,"hahaha... not this again. I have about 96h beta testing of this mod and not ones the game crashed!  I dont know how you can screw up GTA 4 as you do, or you are just plain stupid..."
,Madox,2009-10-28T00:01Z,(lime195) to answer you question. No this version of v0.2 you don´t need the v0.1 this is a full version.
,Madox,2009-10-28T00:10Z,"""RDCMrT"" one more thing. 
*1. I am pretty sure that you got a unleagle copy of GTA4 .
*2. Those errors you got looks like your version of GTA 4 is not up to date.
*3. Don't you got any life at all? I mean come on, you have spended at least 2 years every day going true all new torrents here on piratebay and every time i help people assambling a mod for the GTA series you are there and complains as usualy. hehehe imean COME ON!!!"
,RDCMrT,2009-10-28T00:38Z,"*1. I am pretty sure that you got a unleagle copy of GTA4 .

Sorry dude 100% legit copy of GTA IV !!

*2. Those errors you got looks like your version of GTA 4 is not up to date.

Ehh.
1. Framework 1.1/2.0/3.5 installed.
2. Latest direct X installed.
3. Newest videodrivers installed.
4. All patches from R* installed.

*3. Don't you got any life at all? I mean come on, you have spended at least 2 years every day going true all new torrents here on piratebay and every time i help people assambling a mod for the GTA series you are there and complains as usualy. hehehe imean COME ON!!! 

Well if u did it right and there where no problems i woulnd have to come back anytime arent i ??
+ I responded at your quote that ""the game crashes sometimes"" it has nothing to do with the fucking polygons, u copied that shit right of your crappy ""Real SA"" mod, that was also fucked up and i had to spend a lot of time in tweaking it !! 
It's just because u put cars in it who are crashing the game, if u wont believe me u can look at gtainside.com with cars give SMPA60 errors !!!"
,RDCMrT,2009-10-28T00:41Z,By the way 0 people downloading says enough i think
,Madox,2009-10-28T01:11Z,"Can i ask you one thing? Why in the HELL are you still downloading my mod if you thing all the releases are crap!!!??? I havent FORCED you to download any thing!!! Right?? I have had hundred and hundreds of people suporting my work and liked it just how it is. All i whant to do is collect all the nice cars that you can donload for free and assable them all to a mod for the public to enjoy the game even more like i do. I don't say i'am a fucking modding expert and claiming this and that. How hard is it to understand that simpel thing. If you whant a bug free and flawless mod, try do it your self and do what ever you whant whit it i don´t fucking care..."
,Madox,2009-10-28T01:16Z,AND by the way... 68gb uploded since yester day and 20 direct downloads just to day.
,Madox,2009-10-28T01:41Z,Here is a idé. why complaing insted of helping me to make the mod 100% all good?
,RDCMrT,2009-10-28T13:07Z,"I havent downloaded your mod, but occasionally i downloaded a lot of the cars u put in the package.

I use about 20 cars an also i use a lot of script-mods, ASI loader, Scipthook and i can tell u my GTA IV doesn't have ANY bugs, runs smoothly and DOESN'T crash !!!
The fact that your GTA IV install HAS bugs says enough i think and is the result of bad modding/installing and bad beta testing. This means YOU are doing something wrong !!

It's not that i'm complaining about the fact that you put your effort in making modpackages, but it annoys me that ur installs always have bugs and always let the game crash. In my opinion the cause of that is the fact that u use bad mods, thats the result of not testing them enough.

If u have the mods beta tested for 94 hours, i'm asking myself what u have tested and done in those hours, because with the cars u use the game crashes almost instantly !!

Thats the fact i'm complaining about, i'm just wondering how it can be, that my game doesn't crash at all, and your does when u say you do nothing wrong !!!
"
,RDCMrT,2009-10-28T13:12Z,"By the way, i won't help u to get the mod 100% working because i don't wanna spend my time making modpackages, i want to make it work for myself and help people who can't figure crashes and problems out.

Thats the reason i posted my comment about the cars, because i'm afraid they will get problems.

So again, it's not an attack to you as person but just a comment so people know where the problem lies when their game keeps crashing.

Sorry if it felt personal to u, i think it's wonderfull u do this for people for free, but it;s just that !! ;)"
,Madox,2009-10-29T01:13Z,How can you say the game crashes with my mod if you never downloaded the mod and tried it for your self??(I havent downloaded your mod) hahaha I mean what the fuck! This isen't looking good for you right now...
,Madox,2009-10-29T01:19Z,"Just so you know. Not one of the persons that downloaded the mod has any game crash experiens, just you thinking my mod crashes because you got some information about a few cars that i use in my mod has crased other poples games... hmmmm i'am sorry but that was probebly the dumbest thing i have ever hered in my life."
