,ExplodingBadger,2009-12-07T13:48Z,"Actually I am not sure if this is a region issue or the disk doesnt work on not. When I inserted the disk the 360 said ""PlayDVD"" then tried to read the disk and then went to a sceen with a white background and the sphere with the X in it and the text ""XBOX 360"" displayed. Anyone got this to work ?"

That means it is Wave 4 and you need the one shot boot disc to play this.

Beside that this doesnt even work, i tried the one shot and after it reads the disc says ""The disc is unreadable"" What a waste of Verbatim"
