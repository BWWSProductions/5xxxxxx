Press the Eject and Give Me the Tape is a live album by the British gothic rock band Bauhaus, released in 1982 on Beggars Banquet Records, and recorded in London and Liverpool in 1981 and 1982. The album cover is a photograph by Eugene Merinov. The album was originally a bonus disc with the initial limited edition of the 1982 studio album The Sky's Gone Out. Later in the year it was released as a separate album, with initial copies receiving a free single (Satori in Paris) and poster pack. The single features live versions of "Double Dare" and "Hair of the Dog" not recorded at the same gigs from the album, the poster being a montage of the bands history on stage and beyond.

The album was re-issued in 1988 with six bonus tracks, including the previously unissued "Of Lillies and Remains" and a cover of The Velvet Underground's "Waiting for the Man" recorded live at Fagins, Manchester, 22 October 1981, featuring Nico on vocals (this track was also a track on the "Ziggy Stardust" single).
