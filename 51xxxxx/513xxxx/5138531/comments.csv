,ezequiell,2009-10-28T04:35Z,"Cool, you just uploaded a program that is at least 9 years old... why don't you upload tetris too, and Galaga, and Arkanoid!
Thanks!"
,Nugmonster,2009-10-28T04:39Z,"Do you know how to read or are you just going around looking at torrents just to shoot your mouth off?

Read the last paragraph of the torrent description and then you will see why I have uploaded this. Moron."
[T],bulletzz74,2009-10-28T05:39Z,thank u sir!!
,Nugmonster,2009-10-28T05:41Z,Your Always Welcome!!
,Uberlegen0403,2009-10-28T05:57Z,"Thanks Nugmonster.

Don't pay attention to that fucking idiot ezequiell. He's just another one of these morons with nothing better to do."
,Nugmonster,2009-10-28T06:49Z,"I think he is jealous because he doesn't have a single torrent uploaded, he's just a leech in the strictest sense."
,kevmeister95,2009-10-28T14:40Z,"yeah, Nug, a friend of mine is still trying to find a copy of this one for the sake of owning a piece of history.  anyone who knows the legend, knows that the hijackers supposedly used this version to help with their flying lessons."
,ZERO_BS,2009-10-28T16:11Z,"WTF is your problem, ezequiell?

Some of us collect flight sims... I recently found Tornado and A-10 Cuba! and am actually playing them on DOS and Win95 machines.
"
,Nugmonster,2009-10-28T20:39Z,"I have a saying, Keep your mouth closed and be thought a fool, open it and remove all doubt.

If ezequiell comment didn't remove all doubt, click on his name and that should.

To all those who appreciate a good upload you are Very Welcome!"
[T],bulletzz74,2009-10-29T05:55Z,"thanks again i have a question i finish downloading but it never ask me for the serial, and when i try to play it it saids please insert the correct cd.
can u help me? please "
,Nugmonster,2009-10-29T07:48Z,bulletzz74 Did you burn the ISO's to a disk? The only time I have ever had a problem was when I installed without burning to disks. Something about a .bat file (or something similar) not opening properly during installation.
,Nugmonster,2009-10-29T08:22Z,"Everyone should leave ezequiell alone now, because of him I remembered I had the Old Skool game Battleship, you know, You Sank My Battleship!! So I uploaded it on to TPB. I hope he see's that game and realizes 9 years isn't squat when talking about video games. He's probably some 12 year old who doesn't even remember his mom wiping his butt on 9/11. "
[T],bulletzz74,2009-10-29T15:22Z,"no i didn't burn it, i mount the cd but it didn't work(  Warning: you could have problems with installs if not burnt to disks.) i know im gonna have to burn it to a cd, thanks for the reply Nugmonster."
,Bastaart,2009-10-30T13:49Z,"TY Nugmonster

,mad4u,2009-11-05T20:42Z,I burned the iso files to 2 rewritable DVDs installed the game OK and it still asks for the CD. Should I burn the iso only on CDs?
,Oatmealism,2009-11-09T10:45Z,"Wow...You have No clue How Long I Have Been Looking for a game Like this (Gunna Download it, Havent Yet). Just for the Record too...I am not a Leach I Have nothing to Upload and I am rather New."
,lhashmi,2009-11-21T21:29Z,"Appreciate the upload Nugmonster!!

Seem to be having the same problem as mad4u. It never asked me for a serial, and I burned the three iso files onto cd's. Was there a special way to burn them? Would love the help. Thanks!!!!!"
,mattumbo,2009-12-16T00:40Z,"I installed by mounting the first image with daemon tools and mounting the second image when they asked me to.  I kept getting the same message that everyone else seems to get, but when I opened my computer's disk drive, mounted the second image, and started the game it worked."
,posker,2009-12-25T19:02Z,"man,fuck you it dont work"
