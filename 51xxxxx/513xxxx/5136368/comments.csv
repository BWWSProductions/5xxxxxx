you say the movie is shit...is it the movie itself or the quality of the torrent?

i can't believe w/ over 7000 seeders, only 2 comments, one of which is jiborush and the other one doesn't say anything about a/v.....c;mon people comment aobut a/v quality. thats how we know who has good torrents and who's torrents suck"

Great rip!

Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie. May not be for everyone but it does have a pretty damn original storyline IMO. Decent acting for an action flick. Some of the graphics and concepts seem like they were right out of a videogame (wont be surprised if we see that happen soon). "

,cybervince,2009-12-11T23:01Z,"this could be an R5. the audio is out of sync. audio sounds like mono and reminds me of an echo type sound. video is perfect as it is from a dvd, but the sound is not up to dvd rip quality. i must remember to take more notice of the Quality rating above: +92 / -62 (+30). obviously others are having problems. to be fair, always appreciate any movie offered by extremezone."

,theRealKarmine,2009-12-19T23:51Z,"id have to say the video quality shifts a lot, and the audio seems to be low.....so if you were to use convertxtodvd and boost the sound it would be.....crackly sometimes.  

id say 8/8, it could use improvement.  c2dvd even says it would be a ""good"" convert.....not ""excellent"".  id download an extra 100mb for a better sound rip and video bitrate.  700mb is definitely a 1:30 movie.....but since this is 1:45+ it needs that little bit of extra baggage.
most people dont burn stuff to kvcd anymore so...."
