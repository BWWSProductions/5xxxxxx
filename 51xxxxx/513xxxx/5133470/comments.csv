Great, now all we need is a ""tea party"" in your face.

You are mistaken. The film makers do not support the GOP. We were out in the streets about Bush and company too. Also, reference these documentaries by the same crew...

P.S. - Do you even bother to watch something before commenting or making any judgement?"
,lsnicket,2009-10-25T02:41Z,"Get this movie watch it, burn it and hand out.  This is an urgent call to save our country.....

We didn't like George W Bush and we know that Obama is even worse.

Action is necessary!   Spend 2 hours 20 minutes watching this and then double check the facts.

Also you can now watch the movie free online:

great upload! Keep spreading the truth, these people who commented on this torrent abotu Republicans are fools. They still believe the Republicans are worse than Democrats or visa-versa, anyone who has half a brain knows they are both evil. These commenters I believe are sooooo stupid they think its about Republicans because the title says ""Republic"" not realizing that the United States is a Republic and i has nothing to do with Left and Right. They also probably think being Democrat means the same as Democracy...
