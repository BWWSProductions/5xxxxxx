10/28/09 Rundown: Sex For Tickets, Vulva Pendants, Where The Wild
Things Are, Chimp Funeral, Jocktober cont.:Loper, Smitty & Randi, 
Bob Kelly in-studio, Cheerleader Gets Flu Shot & Can't Walk, Susan 
Finkelstein (Sex For Tickets Woman) calls the show. 



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
