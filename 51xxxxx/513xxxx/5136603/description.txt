For anyone who enjoyed the BBC's brilliant documentary this month, "Synth Britannia", there's something equally good on offer here in this DVD which chronicles the emergence of Sheffield's new wave/synth scene at the dawn of the 80s.

Bands such as Human League, Heaven 17, Cabaret Voltaire, ABC, Artery and Pulp all feature in this intimate documentary which provides candid insight into what drove the movement and how it eventually came to an end.

The DVD also features extended interviews as a bonus feature, together with a number of rare live performances. Awarded five stars by Uncut magazine and four stars by Q, Record Collector and Mojo, this comes highly recommended.

NTSC format, English audio, No subs.
