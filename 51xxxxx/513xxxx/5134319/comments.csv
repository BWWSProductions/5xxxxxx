,fredfan,2010-02-08T19:12Z,"Yer shittin' me...you put 20.27gb of small files in a single zip file?  Not even a mention of the format type or quality or even files included to give an idea of whether such a massive undertaking would begin to be worth it?  No comments give an idea of whether it's all a huge joke or not either, since not too many seemed silly enough to fall for the bait.  Thanks anyhow."

first of all how would you do it better since obviously you have some say and second of all the only reason i made this torrent was so one of my friends a couple states away asked me if he could have all my music...i just put it on here in case someone else wanted to give it a go...if you download this you will find some good music if you like classic rock, hip-hop/rap, country, metal, and basically any type of music"

,Ram012593,2010-03-23T01:35Z,if its just for youre friend then why wouldnt u have made an ftp or used something like wampserver
[T],ctang,2010-03-24T17:00Z,mostly because this is free. Most sites dont just let you upload 20GB of data to their server and not open up a premium account (i.e. $)
