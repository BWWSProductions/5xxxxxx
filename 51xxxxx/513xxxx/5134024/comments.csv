Absolutely horrible quality. Why would anyone upload this? Should have been redone. Not watchable at all.

ALIEN, the show is called Ax Men. It doesn't matter how you would like it to be spelled. Ax Men is the name of the show."
,spifkitten99,2011-10-12T18:39Z,"Bigfoot420 you should not rip tv-shows. You should simply give up. If you thought this was a good enough rip for anything at all, then you don't have the skills, and you don't even have the capability to learn.

It's interlaces and the encoding is absolute shit. For the length of the video and the file size it should look good. But it's shit. Complete shit."
,EricaTPB,2012-04-05T08:04Z,"The quality is not great but the people are complaining way too much. Yes, the quality is not great, but it is also not ""unwatchable"". Also, its not like there is another torrent available.

If you want perfect quality, move on. If you want to easily grab a few seasons and don't mind a bit of blur/distortion, then this torrent is fine.

Thank you Bigfoot420. Though, I would agree if you plan on going through the trouble of doing more TV rips it would be great to have a more standard quality! :)"

If the copies are so bad then they should make the attempt to improve the situ and put better copies online. From me, Many thanx and it is appreciated"
