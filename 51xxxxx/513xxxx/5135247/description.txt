Album review:

Mr. Meeble's Never Trust the Chinese is maniacally fantastic. An elaborate mix of trip-hop, electronica, and experimental rock - it layers soul-writhing vocals over haunting soundscapes. This album is complex - each song is woven together with the intricacy you'd expect from a Pynchon novel. As I listen, I see dark tiny creatures dancing circles around some lost little girl's toes. These sounds of beautiful sadness keep prodding me, reminding me. The pain reverberates. Angels listen along and tearfully know all the words. NTTC is an inspirational work of art oozing both humanity and the sublime - an utter success.
