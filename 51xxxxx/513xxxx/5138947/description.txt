This book offers Python programmers one place to look when they need
help remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source language
and its many powerful but scantily documented modules. This
comprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the most
frequently needed information--not just about the Python language
itself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard library
and the most important third-party extensions. 

Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers more
than the language itself; it also deals with the most
frequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular and
important third party extensions. Revised and expanded for
Python 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's new
subprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's new
IronPython project. Our "Nutshell" format fits Python perfectly by
presenting the highlights of the most important modules and functions
in its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practical
programming needs. This book includes:



A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language

An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python 

Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,
packages, strings, and regular expressions

A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functions
and key modules
