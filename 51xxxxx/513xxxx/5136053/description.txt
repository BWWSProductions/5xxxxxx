Who is Don Ready? Salesman? Lover? Song Stylist? Semi-professional dolphin trainer? Ready is all of the above â€“ except for a dolphin trainer. When heâ€™s asked to help save an ailing local car dealership from bankruptcy, Ready and his ragtag crew descend on the town of Temecula like a pack of coyotes on a basket full of burgers. Selling, drinking, selling and going to strip clubs is their stock and trade. And they do it well. What Don doesnâ€™t expect is to fall in love and find his soul (cue heartfelt piano). â€œThe Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hardâ€ stars Emmy Award-winning actor Jeremy Piven (â€œThe Kingdom,â€ â€œEntourageâ€) and Ving Rhames (â€œI Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,â€ â€œMission: Impossible IIIâ€). The film, from Will Ferrell and Adam McKayâ€™s Gary Sanchez Productions, is directed by Neal Brennan, co-creator of the hugely successful Comedy Central hit â€œChappelleâ€™s Show.â€
