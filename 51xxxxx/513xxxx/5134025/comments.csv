,frenchyd252,2009-10-24T00:25Z,lol yeh i stole the source for this off a private tracker and re-encoded and uploaded here! they banned my account for leeching and not seeding it back!
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-24T04:05Z,i ue the private trackers to grab a lot of movies but i seed them back before converting i have pretty good upload speed but they are definitly faster the public ones
,steadygettingblown,2009-10-24T06:34Z,yeah private trackers are usually faster because people care about their torrent community rather than a bunch of leechs but thanks for the leech and re-up here ;)
,frenchyd252,2009-10-24T09:30Z,"I did try to seed it back but it was a 12 GB mkv would of taken me weeks with my 45KB up. plus i dont feel bad cos i was the only leecher and the 3 seeds were obviously seedboxes cos i was maxing my download!! private trackers are faster cos pretty much every ones using seedboxes and competing for ratio, I aint payin for that. Ive bin using TPB for ages and its a good site its got pretty much anything on here!"
,kube2,2009-10-27T00:08Z,"frenchy, thanks for this movies.
I've be bugging bricktop about this one for months.
I'll seed to at least 2:1"
,jelome1989,2010-01-08T08:35Z,"sorry for the newbie question, but how come it's not playing full screen in my monitor? (my desktop resolution is set to 1920x1080 , monitor is 23"") am i doing something wrong?"
,TheOnlyPunker,2010-04-11T04:52Z,does this come with the extra scenes? like when they take the cpu out of the t800?? or just the normal one. thanks
,simonjpa,2010-05-19T12:11Z,Use VLC Player to watch the movie.
,viper628,2010-09-01T05:02Z,"good dl. The other dls here are not good enough quality for this movie :)

video 9.5/10"
,kght22,2010-09-06T02:55Z,"great quality for what it is, but it is NOT 1080p, the resolution has been reduced to something similar but maybe a little higher than dvd resolution. an excellent download if you want a full quality dvd copy with 5.1 sound this is your deal, if you want real 1080p, dream on. i do belive that this was taken from a real 1080, or atleast 720p copy, but this is neither. it is excellent though"
,hauntnut,2010-11-09T07:46Z,"@ kght22: 

I don't understand how you can say that this is not 1080p resolution. It is, in fact, 1080p. I think that you are confusing resolution with picture quality: sure, this isn't going to have the high bit-rates that a real Blu-Ray disc is capable of containing, but for my money (or lack thereof, why else would I be here), rips like these are a Godsend for those of us who can't afford to upgrade our DVDs with an overpriced disc. In terms of quality, the only thing I have noticed when doing a direct comparison between a file such as this and an actual source disc is that the resulting rip is slightly darker, but in terms of depth, clarity, color, and smoothness, these rips just can't be beat. Thanks to the uploaders for all their hard work, and keep at it! We need you!"
