Hi to all, this is the directors cut of T2 from a 1080p HDDVD source converted into 4GB .m2ts. I searched high n low for a 1080p source of the skynet edition of this but had no luck, but it only contains like 2mins or something of extra scenes anyway so not missin out on much!

I know pristine has already upped this in mp4 but this rip has working 5.1 dolby digital audio so enjoy!!

Resolution...........1920x1080
Encoder..............x264 2 pass
Avg bitrate..........3.3 mbps
Audio................AC3 5.1 448 kbps
Container............m2ts

Please excuse initial seeding my upstream is pretty slow here im on adsl in UK, i have only 0.38 mbps upload which is about 45 KBps tops so it may take a day or 2. i dont bother with seedboxes and all that so dont complain about speeds please!

I will put this on initial seed to try n get pieces out quicker.

Enjoy and seed!
