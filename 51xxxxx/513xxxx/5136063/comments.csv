Don't you have anything better to do than to spam each Paranormal Activity uploads with your stupid repeated comments? Get a life will you?  As for the movie, AWESOME!! Thanks for uploading this movie!"
,CyborgLuv,2009-10-28T20:02Z,"movie was pretty damn good.  they did a great job, pretty creepy."

,share00,2009-11-02T04:14Z,"the ending of the ""internet version"" and the ""theater version"" are different."
,redsn0w,2009-11-14T18:56Z,"Can't believe I downloaded this film, I deleted it after watching the first 20 minutes of it. It was so boring. Nothing wrong with the torrent though."
,Alex43LUFC,2009-11-25T20:28Z,"i quote ""After downloading this Paramount pictures contacted cogeco who then sent me an email saying they knew i downloaded this movie and it went against copyright infringment.they said i had to delete it and refrain from copyright infringment or my services would be cut and charges laid"" is this true? If so how do they track you and how do i prevent this?"
,lukyboi,2009-11-29T21:37Z,"@ LegitModZ and foamyfart:

Yes, the film was made in 2007, and was shown in just a few theaters. Due to its succes they decided to bring the film out worldwide in theaters :P."
,phoebe7,2009-12-01T18:14Z,"Hi! So, this is NOT the theater version then? It's the other one?
Just want to know for which alternate version I have to look for later.
:)"
,crazymofo,2009-12-06T15:46Z,"I'm guessing this is the version everyone is buzzing about since it says 2009 behind it.. I don't really care since I haven't seen either one. I have heard tho, that the movie starts slow but after prob the first 20min it takes off. And scares the shit out of u. Gonna dl this, thanks for the up. "
,vlaad67,2009-12-08T17:05Z,by far the stupidest & most disappointing movie i have ever fucking seen. if i wanted to see some stupid shit like this I'd be watching it on scifi.. For 30 fucking min.. not sitting thru an hour and a half of this ridiculous bullshit.. This movie is fucking retarded.
,LordPyrak,2009-12-09T02:06Z,"FREAKIN HATERS!!
this movie looks awesome, and im gonna DL it and burn it if i can  :P"
,Paperhouse2007,2009-12-12T04:32Z,"Studies have shown that people who aren't scared by this movie and find it ""boring"" are the same who think ""Hostel"" was awesome.  It all depends on what you find scary, and what you don't.  If you don't like it, oh well, but you don't have to shit on people who do."

,murrambingi,2010-11-06T06:23Z,"Thx for the upload nlx78,
Good quality but its a stupid movie, and its too dark in most areas, maybe to create the suspence i suppose.

,ifariley,2010-11-09T11:57Z,"Alex43LUFC!!!! 
like 5 months back i downloaded a couple movies on a buddy of mine's pc using vuze & they got an email to there default email address for there service from there service provider ""charter"" saying that they have record of them downloading illegal movies & listed 2 of the movies i dl'ed n said that they can terminate there service, the movie production company $250,000 or somethin like that for every illegal movie they dl'ed or they can serve jail time. they said that they will be investigated to see if there gonna be prosecuted. & nothin i did ANYWHERE in ANY WAY! had there default email addy involved in what i dl'ed. so to answer you'r question.... how can you stop them from tracking you... change your internet service provider... and if u ever get an email like that again, transfer all the files you want to keep to a flash drive or external hd dl a good file shreder program (search for serial or keygen to get registered version) shred any illegaly dl'ed files, p2p dl programs like bearshare, limewire, etc... you'r dl folders, install folders, system restore data then reformat the drive...

There are 3 endings for paranormal activity. This one has festival ending.

1. Festival Ending: Katie gets killed by police.
2. Theatrical ending: Katie is possessed by demon and dashes at camera after killing her husband
3. Unrated ending: Katie slices her own throat and dies."
,Tweak076,2011-02-03T22:08Z,"The movie is produced in 2007, released in 2009. Is the theatrical version online? Ending: Katie is possessed by demon and dashes at camera after killing her husband. The only version that fits with part 2. Katie is coming back to her sister, she's not dead."
,SarahAW,2011-03-17T01:52Z,"Wow I can't see why this movie is getting so much hate. If you want to know what it's like I suggest you look it up on Wikipedia first before downloading and then leaving hateful comments on nlx_78's torrent pages like ""wow so boring..."" Don't flame the movie because you weren't so motivated to look it up first to see whether or not you would like it. Kudos to this upload. I believe this a DVD RIP NOT A CAM RIP PA CAME OUT ON DVD IN 2009 NOT 2007 IT WAS IN THEATRES IN 2007. God some people are just retards."
,DRONERS,2011-04-16T22:35Z,Don't download!!! Got the copyright letter too. Fuck Comcast!!!
