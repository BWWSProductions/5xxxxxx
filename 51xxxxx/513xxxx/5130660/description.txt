PokÃ©mon Heart Gold & Soul Silver, both with the English menu patch. These games do crash quite a lot on the emulators but if you have the latest firmware on your r4 / r4i card, then it works great. Still save frequently though.

Both as .nds files, no rars.

I always upload torrents to the best quality I can. All torrents virus free and labeled correctly.

I noticed the soul silver is already on here with the eng menu but heart gold isn't. Enjoy :-)

Heart gold in this torrent doesn't work properly. I have uploaded a different version which is 80% eng patched.... a lot more than the version of soul silver in this torrent,
