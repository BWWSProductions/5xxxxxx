,zerocell911,2009-11-04T09:59Z,"Man I love Weezer so goddamn much, and I appreciate the upload, but this album is a PIECE OF SHIT. Worst album to date. They'd better take a nice long ass hiatus in get their shit together, for real."
,Plenoxia,2009-11-04T16:49Z,i heard good things about it everywhere else but here. . . i guess i'll have to see for my self
,pixidude,2009-11-07T02:36Z,"KidA91827 and lms79

If you don't like Weezer then don't sodding listen to them,go fuck off and listen to some Lady GaGa you couple of fuckin' morons!
Weezer sound like Weezer and have done for six previous albums, so why expect them to sound like anything else?"
,Phrosty12,2009-11-10T02:44Z,Shutup pixidude. You're worse than they are.
,millerman1983,2009-11-10T09:17Z,i'm with pixidude. it's hard not to sing when you're at one of their concerts. if there's one consistent thing rivers and the gang can do it's write a catchy tune. =w=
,NoCode0680,2009-11-13T06:24Z,"I don't think it's that bad.  Let's not forget, NOBODY liked Pinkerton when it came out.  Critics railed on it, hardly anyboy bought it, it was a disaster and the butt of tons of jokes.  Now it's considered one of the best albums of the 90's and the same critics and listeners who hated it now go on and on about how it's an ""important album"".  Am I saying this measures up to Pinkerton?  No, but I'm just saying don't rush to judgement.  And so many people are hearing these bad reviews and comments, and then not listening to the album with an open mind.  Personally I wasn't impressed with Weezer's last 2 albums leading up to this one, so I wasn't expecting to have my socks blown off or anything, but I think the album is pretty good.  It's a departure for them, and I love when bands do that.  So many fans expect band to follow a formula and put out songs that sound EXACTLY like the last song that was a radio hit.  If you don't like it, that's fine, you didn't pay for it obviously."
,08millerj,2009-11-14T04:16Z,do you think you can upload the snuggie? 
,08millerj,2009-11-14T04:20Z,"HEY FUCKING ASSHOLES, DON'T COMMENT ON THIS ALBUM SUCKING IF YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING PAY FOR IT. "

,zerocell911,2009-12-06T17:49Z,"I came back to say this damn album is growing on me. I hated this shit before, but the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate it. Regardless of what anyone says, you should give this album a try. Who knows, it might change your views too."
,RENE9A6E,2010-04-26T09:30Z,"Whats up with all the Weezer hate? I can only assume that all these comments about how much this album sucks are by those who were introduced to Weezer during the ""Beverly Hills"" days and were greatly mislead by what Weezer is about. I've listened to every Weezer album and I with (the Red Album) being my least favorite album, this is a nice clean, greatly entertaining version of what it is that originally made them a great band. Did anybody look at the cover? Its a friggen dog flying through the air for crying out loud!!! They are obviously just having fun with what they do as always. I mean...come on....""I Can't Stop Partying""??? They're poking fun at the music industry all the while, appeasing the industry all at once. Its brilliant. Now, no, I have to admit, its still no Pinkerton, but this album is an excellent recovery from their last attempt."
