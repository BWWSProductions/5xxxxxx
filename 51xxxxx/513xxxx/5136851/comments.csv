""There is a problem with this Windows installer package. A program required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor.""

That message came up when I tried to install the game from both the ""setup.exe"" and by mounting. (with administrator rights)

The first thing it did was trying to ""install Microsoft visual c++ 2008 Runtime libraries""
And then that message came up.... (don't know if that's the problem, but I checked it up anyway, more or less.) -

,iRockSBs,2009-10-28T05:54Z,"ARGH!! i need help installing this. Im running Windows 7 btw. ok so i coppied over the crack to the binary folder and then the installer rolled back. then i copied the crack to the install directory. the installer gets to about 5 sec then i get an error saying ""There is a problem with this Windows installer package.

,iRockSBs,2009-10-28T13:00Z,since no one helped i figured out a solution. when that error popped up i just copied the entire borderlands folder to my desktop. then i clicked ok on the error and the installer rolls back. now i can play straight from the folder. everything is working fine. level 18 Siren as of right now and not a single crash. multiplayer works and all that good stuff.
,Lliam,2009-10-29T01:32Z,"Teves123@

I was trying to install the game in ""safemode"" though I had Administrator rights my system wouldn't recognize it..
I went to normal mode and followed Razor's EXACT notes, it took half a day to install it =P..

I don't really know how it worked but i'll explain how I did it..

1. Extract RARs
 2. Mount or Burn image
 3. Install the game
The first 3 steps are pretty easy, though you don't have to ""mount it"" you can extract it one more time and double click the ""setup.exe"" if you prefer, it works the same.
I extracted it till it's extent..

Be sure to run the ""Setup.exe"" with administrator rights - also called ""run as administrator"" 

I think this is where ""Error 1721"" occurs..
Be sure to run with administrator rights.. in the computers standard mode..

4. Important!! While installing replace the original exe with the 
    cracked Borderlands.exe from Razor1911\Install directoy after the DirectX
    installation!!

The fourth step explains what you need to do, but not ""how"" you'll do it.
I don't really know if I did right here, but I put the Borderlands.exe (that you find in Razor1911/install directory)

-note- 
that I did not mount the game.  
I extracted it one more time (as I explained earlier)
And that's where I put the ""Borderlands.exe"" from Razor1911 install directory.
And I did so AFTER the ""DirectX setup"" had finished in the ""installment process""

5. Important! While installing copy the cracked exe from Razor1911\Crack directory
    to the .\{$InstallDirectory}\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\ directory!
    (Not the Binaries directory!)

By this time, the installment should have created a new map in ""Local disc C - program files"" (if you selected that destination..) 
There you will go and add the other file that was in the ""Razor1911 directory"" which stands under ""crack""

And as the ""install notes"" from Razor said.. ""not in Binaries""
just lay it outside with all the other maps..

-note-
I don't know if it makes a significance ""when"" you put it there.. But just to be sure, put the file there when the ""2K games"" game file is created to your selected destination..

when the installment is done, the whole thing can backfire against you, if you've not done it properly, or clicked the wrong buttons.

Wait until you can click the ""finish"" button on the installment process, never mind the ""put in disc"" window that will come up..
(That has nothing to do with ""mounting"" it, or not)

If you've pressed the ""finish"" button before you press on any button in the ""put in disc"" window, the whole thing wont backfire - or as windows may say it ""Error 1722""

then add the ""bordelands.exe crack"" again in the game fil (2K games) if necessary.. otherwise just click the cracked BL.exe and play.

I think that sums it up..
But write back and explain any problems you are experiencing.. 
If there is one, I'll try to help."
,killjoy408,2009-10-29T07:31Z,Currently seeding and uploaded 7gb but I only downloaded 20% of it!!! What's wrong with you people!!! Seed with a decent amount of bandwidth!!! 
,Davidos3012,2009-10-29T17:08Z,=.= my computer processes the files too fast so I have nearly no time to add the files like described in the previous posts.
,Lliam,2009-10-29T19:29Z,"Davidos3012@

I have installed it again, and I can say that you don't actually need the ""install"" thing, that is in ""Razor1911"" directory..

Just click the setup.exe with ""run as administrator

Let the installment process go...

And wait until windows is asking for the disc.
Press the button on the far left side in the ""disc window""
you can't click ""x"" or ""cancel""
because then it will backfire - ""Error 1722""

click the one beside ""retry""

then the installment process will finish, click the finish button..
And just cancel the thing that comes up after you've clicked the ""button beside retry"" (back with the ""disc window"")

now the only thing you have to do is put in the ""crack"" IN Binaries..
not outside, like it's said in the Razor notes...

Then you should be able to play"

,dodamndont,2009-11-01T06:24Z,I have a problem guys. When I try to run the setup file it says the installation package could not be opened! And when I click on the other one I just get like a black console box. 
,Logan_5,2009-11-02T03:52Z,"Thanks Mbb15 for a great scene release....

@ Lliam: I actually took the time to read your lengthy reply to teves123 as well as RAZOR's .NFO file BEFORE installing the game and I have to say THANK YOU for the detailed reply you gave him because following your directions with one little difference meant the difference for me in playing the game as I am now and being one of the many people posting in all the threads for this game here on TPB that the game doesn't work. I wonder if they don't seem to know how to read maybe?

These are the steps that I followed from Razor's .NFO which resulted in a perfect installation:

 1. Extract the .iso from the RARs -(WinRAR is best but 7zip seemed to work just as well)
 2. Mount or Burn the .iso image -(I extracted the game files in to a new folder on my desktop & installed the game from there)
 3. Install the game 

 4. Important!! While installing replace the original exe with the 
    cracked Borderlands.exe from Razor1911\Install directoy after the DirectX
    installation!!

 5. Important! While installing copy the cracked exe from Razor1911\Crack directory
    to the .\{$InstallDirectory}\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\ directory!
    (Not the Binaries directory!)

(I did steps 4 & 5 while the DX setup was running, doing the install this way instead of waiting for the DXinstall to complete didnt make a difference that I can see)

I'm using the 32bit version of Win7 w/4gb RAM, a DualCore E2200 CPU overclocked to 2.6GHz with an Nvidia 9400GT with 1GB of GDDR3 memory."

,Overx,2009-11-06T23:51Z,"I have been trying to install this for a week now. i've used both the razor1911 crack and the RELOADED crack.

i followed the instructions perfectly however its not opening a razor splash like it did for my friend, instead it pops up a cmd prompt window for 1 second and closes instantly. it sais that borderlands was installed, however when i attempt to actually run the game, the borderlands.exe file (from the ..1911\crack\ folder that is moved into the binary folder after installation(automatically) does the same thing. it opens a cmd prompt window for 2 seconds and closes. it appears the exe files from BOTH cracks are attempting to open as msdos files and not even starting up. i am using Vista home premium.

i meet the requirements for the game, so any suggestions/comments/similar situations?"

I was having the same problem you guys were. So I decided to try extracting ALL files to a folder instead of running it as a .ISO through some kind of reader. So I just extracted all of the files to some random folder, doesn't matter where, using MagicISO or any program that can do this, and hit the setup.exe in the designated folder and underwent the installation process. It worked PERFECTLY. Except my computer's not good enough to play this... :( The textures don't even render.... Hope this helps."

Now I can't extract them. winrar tells me that i have to insert a disc and 7rar just... well, it's not extracting anything... Help!"
,Twism08,2009-12-03T16:55Z,And now 7rar is telling me that the .iso is broken... F*CK THAT!
