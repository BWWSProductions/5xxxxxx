a request for you.  I'm guessing you're Canadian from the CBC programs you upload here.  I know you upload a lot of stuff and aren't probably looking for yet another program to encode and upload, but can you please consider adding ""CBC - The Nature of Things with David Suzuki"" to the list of stuff you capture and upload?  It's an excellent science/nature program and nobody is current capturing and sharing it on P2P.  I think it's a really good program and deserves to be seen by more people.  It's a weekly series so you don't have to worry about doing it everyday.  

If you can't, that's cool.. I know you capture and share enough programs as it is... "
