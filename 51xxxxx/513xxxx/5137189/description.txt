Plot: One of America?s most enduring mysteries â€“ the fate of 16th century British colonists who vanished from their Virginia settlement â€“ provides the backdrop for this creepy horror film. Young preservation architect Will Custis (Scott Cooper) gets more than he bargained for when he undertakes the restoration of a colonial-era house near Chesapeake Bay. Director Robert J. Wilson eschews the obvious, suggesting more than he shows â€“ a welcome respite from the gore-splattered genre offerings of recent years.
