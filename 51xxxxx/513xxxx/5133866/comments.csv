Replace RosettaStoneVersion3.exe version 3.4.3 --- > RosettaStoneVersion3.exe version 3.3.5 or 3.3.7! It will fix your problem: level 1, 2, 3 will be working "
,Takwan,2009-10-26T15:35Z,"Vasia, 

Thank you very much for this upload. I had no problems installing it, but got  blocked when adding languages. It is asking for the languages CD, and I understand the first levels are in the same folder under .../Contents/Resources. 

Any suggestions are welcomed. 

Thanks again.

,NightF0x,2009-10-26T21:07Z,"Other 3.x versions will work for most language levels 1-3 but others (ie. English 4&5) require this version..

Any final verdict on if it activates properly/works?"

,ednum5,2009-11-28T17:54Z,"It isn't the languages that need to be hacked, it is the application. Thanks for the Spanish, VZ!"
,Takwan,2009-12-03T03:59Z,"Thank you very much!!

The solution to make it work, is to burn the 1, 2, 3 language levels, in my case Arabic, to DVDs, then install the languages one by one. 

It works like a charm!!

Cheers!!

,Takwan,2009-12-03T05:12Z,"I spoke too son. 

It is asking for an activation code, for Arabic 1, 2, 3. No solution to the conumdrum.
