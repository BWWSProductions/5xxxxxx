,tmobileg,2010-07-18T03:58Z,Why is this one so slow of a download?
,phatseejay,2010-08-26T23:11Z,My humble thanks for putting these up. Saved me time to rip these myself. Looking at a project where I use the video and paste together with the Swedish dub. 
,mchristy63,2010-10-29T03:24Z,For some reason some of these episodes have bad voice volume and super loud background and music. Very uneven. Compare Atlantic Inferno to Attack of the Alligators.  Sound quality on TV is excellent on Inferno.  Anyone know how that could be. Same codes for both.

Other than that they're ok I guess"
