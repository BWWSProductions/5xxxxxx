From the Northern Ballet's website:

A perfect tale for Christmas. 
A Christmas treat for everyone, from Scrooge to Tiny Tim, A Christmas Carol combines traditional ballet and captivating theatre in a production that has delighted Northern Ballet Theatre audiences up and down the country for over a decade. Colourful sets and costumes, conjuring up a traditional Victorian Christmas, are perfectly complemented by Carl Davis' festive score which blends classical music, played live by the Northern Ballet Theatre Orchestra, with well-known Christmas carols sung by the company.
