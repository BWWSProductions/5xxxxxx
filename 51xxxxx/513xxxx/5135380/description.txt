Machinarium wastes no time at all getting you familiar with its world, dropping you directly into the action without any form of introduction. You're a robot who has been trapped in some sort of prison-like facility and you need to escape. That's all you know. There is no exposition at allâ€”largely because there is no actual dialog in the gameâ€”so the bits of story you do pick up throughout the adventure are sparse but meaningful.
