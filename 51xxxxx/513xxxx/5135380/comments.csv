,d.rt,2009-10-25T11:28Z,"miknos
you email ?"
,miknos,2009-10-25T21:41Z,"I mean this torrent is working (other two had no seeds).

Before you uploaded this Mac version, I tried getting Windows version and using the flash folders inside with Machinarium.app (mac) from demo without luck.

Your upload works like a charm. I don't have to run windows anymore."
