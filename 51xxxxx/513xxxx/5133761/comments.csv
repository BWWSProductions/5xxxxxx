,Kamui_84,2009-10-23T21:27Z,In a good torrent client you can download single files of the torrent. So I don't see a problem with that.
,Kamui_84,2009-10-28T00:01Z,"Hmm, I wonder who the third seeder is, since no one has completed the torrent yet...
Whoever you are: Thanks for seeding! :-)"
,i_bajic,2009-11-24T16:33Z,"I downloaded s1d1 but when I mount iso and start it, there is no audio. what's the catch?"
,Kamui_84,2009-11-27T23:48Z,"@i_bajic: Since there are multiple audio tracks, you must choose one. Don't know what you are doing. It works fine for me (and seems so for all others).
Use a powerful player (like mplayer) or a DVD player (software) like ogle (maybe PowerDVD if you use OS from Micro$oft)."
,bioneo,2009-12-02T01:07Z,"gracias!!

espero poderlo tener pronto

just one question, this is all the season???

you have some more series of this star trek? like deep space 9 or voyager please!"
,Kamui_84,2009-12-08T07:00Z,"@bioneo: As I wrote in the description, these are all 7 seasons. Otherwise it wouldn't be so big. :-)
And if you click on my username, you can see that I have Voyager (from kef71), but dont't have other ST series yet.

@all: Please read carefully, before you ask. Thx."

,Induktor,2009-12-27T03:28Z,"Hi, Just a question, the spanish audio track is spanish from spain or latin american spanish?

,Kamui_84,2010-01-04T07:41Z,"@Induktor: I don't speak any kind of spanish, so I can't tell you what it is."

i'm currently uploading DS 9 S 1 and S 2

S 3 - S 7 are still downloading thru a private torrent, so this is going very slowly since there arn't much seeds of these torrents.

DS 9 S 1 http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5212638/Star_Trek_Deep_Space_9_Season_1

DS 9 S 2 http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5253065/Star_Trek_Deep_Space_9_Season_2"

,Kamui_84,2010-01-30T21:51Z,"@kl01: Can you please create and add MD5 checksums of the ISOs? And can you please seed these torrents?
If so: Great torrents, big thanks! (but DS9 S1 is already online - see my other torrents)"
,primalclaws1974,2010-03-11T15:42Z,makes me laugh...seeing a torrent this big...prob take 2 months to download...and the first comment about a download cap was funny too. I don't think that United States has a limit on their download...I know I don't.

,Akilaept,2012-02-06T22:13Z,I can't download this or the Voyager torrent file. I get an error page.
,Akilaept,2012-02-08T00:49Z,"I finaly got the torrent, but after reaching 958mb or so it stops and say Element is missing. Then i push start and it starts again for a few more mb and stops with the same error. I have 1.19gb downloaded already. Anyone has any info on what is going on and what can i do to fix this?"
,danwat1234,2012-02-08T02:53Z,"I'll be seeding this forever, or until all the seasons of TNG full HD is released on bittorrent!"
,darkhusky,2012-02-21T17:53Z,Good clean torrent. Downloaded fast and the vids are high quality. Thanx.
,hobarrera,2012-04-16T07:29Z,"Why is this 360GB? It's not HD (blu ray-rip), is it?"
,BloodKil_,2012-05-20T21:59Z,"@hobarrera

Nope not HD..

Just started my search for TNG a few min ago, and after being disappointing by the resolutions available I searched the web.

It seems TNG is being remastered and we should see the first of the Bluray disks July 24 this year (2012)

Waiting a few months to either DL or buy these is definitely ok with me, as SD looks like crap on a 73"" tv. "
