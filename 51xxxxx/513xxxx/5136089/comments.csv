Sure, I don't have that one... out of stock 'round here...
I've been keeping my eye open for the BOT version (9781415918593) to show up (Recorded Books didn't seem to do that book).
Got a link & info on the recording?

Thanks for the feedback.
Thanks seeders!"

I'll post it up here if it's decent quality (it seems to be)."

Any suggestions are appreciated...."
