We were doing the same thing when Bush was in office...battling against the puppets in office, their tyranny and the military-industrial-pharma-banking-corporate complex.

What's the next STUPID comment?"

,JBNyen,2009-10-24T22:40Z,"This movie created by a bunch of GOPs, KKKs, backwater sore losers who cannot stand Obama - a blackman won the US presidency. Now there is a God."
,Hegelian.Dialectic,2009-10-25T01:06Z,"@JBNyen
You are mistaken. We were out in the streets about Bush and company too. Also, reference these documentaries by the same crew...

P.S. -  Do you even bother to watch something before commenting or making any judgement?"
,soulfried,2009-10-26T02:38Z,"That's what is really sad is how many Americans will protest something just because it has a title that isn't positive about obama. Failing to even view or know anything about what these films are about. They actively protested Both Bush's, Clinton, and Obama. These films shed light on the mis-truths that American citizens live under. Most portions are straight out of White house footage also, so it's not some hype. Put 2&2 together for yourself.  Appreciate the upload."
