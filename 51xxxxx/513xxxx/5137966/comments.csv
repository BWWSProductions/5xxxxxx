,Althir,2009-10-27T17:12Z,"Yep, its cool.. I liked FATE :)"
,visualfx,2009-10-27T17:19Z,cool!!   thx dude
,Althir,2009-10-27T17:21Z,"Enjoy!
This is 100% Working Version:

-Its Image: .bin/.cue files inside
-Scanned with Kasperky Internet Security 2009, and F-Secure 2010.

Great Game, Leech and the Seed!"
,Behemothius,2009-10-27T17:40Z,Was at 60% and then there was no seeders left. Great work.
,Althir,2009-10-27T18:01Z,"Cmon people Download it, we need Seeders..I dont wanna be the only one!"
,iamnotdeadyet,2009-10-27T18:17Z,Is this a fake? I cannot unpack it either with 7-zip or Winrar. How am I supposed to do i? Thanks.
,Althir,2009-10-27T18:26Z,"You dont need to Unpack it.
I Extracted it already for you..

Just Burn/Mount .Bin Image file and Install :)"
,iamnotdeadyet,2009-10-27T18:43Z,All I see are some sort of rar files that I can't turn into an image file. I guess my PC is kaputt. I might as well restart it. I cannot get me head round this.
,iamnotdeadyet,2009-10-27T18:48Z,"Sorry, got the wrong torrent. I was referring to another one."
,Althir,2009-10-27T18:49Z,"Theres 3 Files inside:

sr-torchl.bin
sr-torchl.cue
skidrow.nfo"
,Althir,2009-10-27T18:49Z,"Btw, Another one is Fake.
Its Trojan."
[T],Knaster,2009-10-27T19:01Z,Althir are you saying this is trojan? WTF?
,Althir,2009-10-27T19:10Z,"Not this, another torrent that is around."
,Althir,2009-10-27T20:06Z,"Everyone: Give a + to Quality, if you liked this Torrent.. It has Seeders now too!!!"
,paulboscu,2009-10-27T20:11Z,"good torrent this one,it seems tpb ppl removed the fake fuked up one that i downloaded before this. 100% working and cleen this torrent is :)"
,Behemothius,2009-10-27T22:09Z,"@iamnotdeadyet

The first version that was uploaded here and that I downloaded had rar files with first 01 being an exe file instead of rar, so it wasn't possible to extract the iso file. The one that is up for download right now seems to have image file already extracted and will hopefully work."
,noekk,2009-10-27T22:31Z,"This is the biggest ripoff I've ever seen; it's almost a perfect clone of Fate (Undiscovered Realms and also Traitor Soul.)

You would think these clowns could at least not blatantly copy someone else's work, could at least change it just a little to make it somewhat original.

Pirate the shit out of this mother fucker and don't even think of buying it."
,Kraid07,2009-10-27T22:55Z,"@foekk: FUCK YOU! nuff said.

Torchlight reminds me so much on Diablo1 :D
I can't stop playing it, I'm so damn addicted!
Will buy it on steam as soon as I got the money together!"
,soapcell,2009-10-28T00:18Z,"@noekk

It's made by the designer of Fate, the co-designers of Diablo 1 and 2 and the original Mythos team.

That's why it's really similar."
,.dot,2009-10-28T02:03Z,"This game is made by the devs of Diablo, Diablo 2 & Fate. Its very good (84+ ratings) and ull get a lot of game for just 20 bucks, so support the devs and buy is (steampowered.com).

This is not one of the big releases, if they dont get ur money they cant make something like this again.

SUPPORT THE DEVS AND BUY TORCHLIGHT!"
,blank_blank,2009-10-28T02:22Z,"@noekk

because the lead programmer with Fate and Torchlight is just 1 person. Travis Baldree! I knew this would be a fate clone after reading the description alone."
,Althir,2009-10-28T06:25Z,"Yes, Its a clone...Perfect Clone, and thats why I like it. Im going to buy it from Steam Next week :)"
,yeesnaw,2009-10-28T14:07Z,"noekk, you can pirate the shit out of my muther fukin 3=====D before you even think about posting again."
,Dexter00111001,2009-10-28T14:08Z,is this the official release?
,riplikethat,2009-10-28T14:41Z,"Cool. I told my friends about this game and they all wanted it. Gonna download and burn this copy for them.

SKIDROW ROCKS!"
,Dexter00111001,2009-10-28T14:55Z,is this the official release? 
,Althir,2009-10-28T14:58Z,This is Digital Download Copy.
,Dexter00111001,2009-10-28T15:00Z,"ok thanks
thought this was a press release version"
,capaomega,2009-10-28T15:13Z,All i see when i try to play this game is a fat man and his dog on a blue screen. =\
,Althir,2009-10-28T16:27Z,"Mmmh.. Its Title Menu  (aka Main Menu), man is not fat :D ..Just start new game, and make character.. Im lvl-100, thanks to Trainer I made.."
,Mark_X,2009-10-28T17:33Z,it looks like diablo 3..nice
,noekk,2009-10-29T01:08Z,"Alright, I'll take back what I said since it's from the same guy as Fate.

This game is pretty awesome and I'll probably buy it because I liked Hellgate London a lot and was sad when those guys went under."
,Blue_Fire,2009-10-29T02:57Z,"can someone help me? after i install the game and go to play it, it doesn't load and says ""Torchlight.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close."" "
,Hawkril,2009-10-29T05:29Z,"Download was fast, easy install and the game is amazing. I highly recommend this download and after playing the game I'm probably going to buy it."
,Althir,2009-10-29T07:56Z,"From daemon tools, mount .bin image you downloaded. You dont need to make .ISO's :)"

,Althir,2009-11-01T11:38Z,"Hey everyone!

,druidzero,2009-11-02T00:36Z,"Althir thank you for post this game!!!!

,DarkHorseDre,2009-11-04T15:05Z,"Awesome!  They made the demo hard to find, and SkidRow came to the rescue!

I cant believe SKIDROW is back - I remember you guys from my A500 days!  SR, Paradox, Oracle, Prodigy - brought me my favourite games of all time - THANKS dudes!

I'll stay seeded for another 18 hours or so - thanks again peeps."
,Althir,2009-11-05T20:13Z,"Enjoy!
See, theres +450 Seeders, and about 50 Leechers!
Get game now, its fast to download!!!"
,Matymas,2009-11-06T18:36Z,from wich vendor i should download patch 1.12 for this release? or it wont work?
,JTuzee,2009-11-06T20:27Z,"""from wich vendor i should download patch 1.12 for this release? or it wont work? ""

I'm wondering the same thing."
,latooots,2009-11-06T21:43Z,"""from wich vendor i should download patch 1.12 for this release? or it wont work? ""

Yep, I'm wondering the same thing too.

 Just to inform you guys, I tried installing the patch from the runic website (which required me to uninstall the game first then reinstall it using the patch, which is by the way the whole game) which anyway did'nt work.

So I tried reinstalling from this torrent, but guess what? It doesn't work anymore.

Help us Skidrow, please? :3"
,latooots,2009-11-06T21:46Z,"Oh, and if this game is as good as what I've been hearing about, I'm definitely gonna buy it. Have to torrent to see what it feels like first though.

Please support this small company. If the game is REALLY good then they DESERVE our support!"
,k1n81k,2009-11-06T23:36Z,"I found a workaround for the update. Download the official 1.2 patch from runic and save the executable from this release. I have not tested this thoroughly but at least got the game to launch and loaded my previous save. there was a huge difference in speed and load time. anyways go ahead and replace the update executable with the one from this release and you should be ok till skidrow or whomever releases a patched executable of the new update. im sure doing this is not a perminant fix and there are some fixes you wont get. the 1.2 exe is 11mb and the exe from this is 9mb so they updated the exe as well. anyways try it and post your results.

ill update later after more testing"
,SiN-R,2009-11-07T00:17Z,"""anyways go ahead and replace the update executable with the one from this release""

DON'T EVER DO THAT!!! the game will taking a longer loading time. i was waiting actually around 6-7mins then failed to load.. :\"
,Solaid,2009-11-07T01:07Z,"yeah it will crash when the game tries to save, etc. when you enter/exit portals."
,latooots,2009-11-07T02:30Z,"@k1n81k
sorry mate. it didnt work for me.

i hope they'll make a workaround for it soon."
,SiN-R,2009-11-08T04:01Z,"Guys. i know temporary boosting the loading screen (the startup screen time still sux with MOD though)
Update your Visual C++ 2008

,k1n81k,2009-11-08T04:02Z,"ok so my ""fix"" did not work as well as i hoped or at all for that matter the game loaded in town but soon as i went through a portal it crashed. I tried to update before but was having login issues with tpb. anyways sorry if i got your hopes up.

from my digging around it looks like this is possibly a pre release version of the game or a hacked steam version of it. I am leaning towards the steam side because of the steam api in the dir. this is all guessing of course. but as of yet I have not actually found a ""cracked"" copy of the executable or patcher of any sort. so I am curious as to how this release came about. but so far the best results for load times and all that has been repacking the pak.zip. hopefully there will be a proper crack/patch for 1.2, though I am more then likely going to just buy the game some time in the next week or so. my only issue with relic is the licensing control system only allowing 10 installs. bot for $20 its not bad 


also @SiN-R ""DON'T EVER DO THAT!!! the game will taking a longer loading time. i was waiting actually around 6-7mins then failed to load""

if you are having 6 minute loading times you have other issues.. I tested this on 3 machines and the load time to the game was about 20 seconds. i was able to get character selection and in town. but that's it.  "
,SiN-R,2009-11-08T04:11Z,yeah. i fix that already. now its 30secs.
,Question2,2009-11-08T06:27Z,Anyone know how to contact skidrow for a proper crack?
,pongfaen,2009-11-12T18:49Z,This downloaded in just 6min! Good job! Works perfectly on my Vista 64
,fakterr,2009-11-14T04:13Z,hey thanx bro works great been jamming this hard for the last few days. running on vista
,Althir,2009-11-14T07:48Z,"Enjoy!
Keep this torrent alive :)"
,zorome,2009-11-14T14:38Z,"this is NOT the patched version. For some reason he changed the name of the torrent, but it still has NO patch at all."
,setari,2009-11-14T18:41Z,"Is there only supposed to be a .bin and a .cue file in this? seems like there's supposed to be more, maybe not though...DLing Daemontools right now to see if it will unpack it."
,ScifiLover52,2009-11-14T20:07Z,"can't reccomend this torrent, the sound doesn't work. music's fine though."
,tturcic,2009-11-14T22:54Z,"I had error during installation and now I can't install it again (error message:""Prior installation detected. Unable to install.""). I checked my registry and there is no Runic Games there. Any help is appreciated."
,flea_friend,2009-11-18T05:54Z,"I downloaded and installed the game no problem, but when I try to play it, the screen goes black and it just hangs until I shut it down in the task manager. Anyone else having this problem?"
,Xoyli,2009-11-18T06:14Z,How do i mount/burn the .bin file sorry i am totally new to this kind of thing
,kaljundm,2009-11-19T20:16Z,how can i mount the BIN file?
,peter980,2009-11-28T11:31Z,"First, so called patch isn't patch but full installation with 1.12b version of the game (which works as demo if not activated). Thus, no need whatsoever for this release anymore. Just download somewhere officially Runic Games version.

Then get crack from gamefix site!
That's all."
,Itsapaul,2009-12-08T11:44Z,Has anyone figured out how to patch this version?
,octopuzziy,2009-12-15T02:37Z,OK so for everyone getting the black screen this is what i did:  I downloaded the 1.12 patch from just searching for it thru google its like 499 megs).  I uninstalled the skidrow version then installed the patch.  I then unistalled the patch and reinstalled the skidrow version and for some reason ti worked.  For everyone getting the problem saying that you already have it installed double check to make sure you deleted the demo.
,octopuzziy,2009-12-15T07:16Z,"This game is so fun.  Alot like diablo2 with a few new features.  For everyone having trouble installing the game I have two things to say1.  e-mail me personally at octopuzziy@yahoo.com 2. just DONT GIVE UP, the rule to never forget is to keep messing around with pirated games and they eventually end up working.  Good Luck!"

,kalmari22,2010-01-05T00:13Z,"Althir: Go die prick. This ain't the patched version, and you renamed the torrent deliberately. Gosh.. On another note, this game is cheap and good, worth the actual buck. :)"
