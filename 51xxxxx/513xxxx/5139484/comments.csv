,Sickeder,2009-10-29T14:14Z,"@snooza

This is the exclusive CD released with the Renegade Edition (Limited Edition) of the game. 

However, I am working on what you ask for, I'll upload it as soon as I can."
,caliwillbemine,2009-10-29T17:29Z,"can someone share the full soundtrack of DJ Hero ???

i can't believe it's taking so long !!!

maybe we have to wait for the european release of the game because americans are too selfish!!!"
,shimbibitty,2009-10-29T23:50Z,"Damn Europeans will never get my DJ Hero! (Despite the post above yours saying he's working on it....)

Thx for this Sickeder"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-10-30T17:09Z,Is this the explicit version? because the track titles are censored i'm wondering if the content itself is like wise?
,Yettum,2009-10-31T01:37Z,"@Psycho

I have the actual CD and it's the Explicit version, so this should be too"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-10-31T02:24Z,"Downloaded, great... thanks and yeah as far as I hear it's the explicit. Any idea why the Jay-Z track titles are censored though? just wondering if you labelled them or what and if there's a reason they're censored the way they are."
,Sickeder,2009-11-01T05:55Z,"The track names are censored but the songs aren't, that's just how it came/imported."
,joelsk,2009-12-31T02:22Z,"I have the cd's too, and it's not cencored in the songs, it's just the title or something..."
