After you installed Pinnacle 14, run ContentTransferWizard.exe located in \Install_Studio_14\Content Transfer directory.

Once you run this program, select that you want to transfer pinnacle 11 content. Once done, you can run Bonus DVD 1 & 2. (just mount them in magic disk or etc)"

Seriously..if you're that bad at life and staying with XP makes you feel good then so be it. I used XP on a friends computer recently, and my god it was so horrible. I advise all to move on to Windows 7, it works on the same level as XP but looks tremendously better and performs equal to. I'd never go back. And the people hating on Windows 7 need to upgrade their shitty computers. Some people are using computers as old as their grandmas ass hairs and get mad at Microsoft because they wont support them. So fuck you ""funy10"" you're livin in the 90's.."

,Llamaduck,2010-10-14T09:18Z,"For everyone who had problems unRAR'ing the files, it is because Windows (probably just 32-bit) does not allow a path to be over 260 characters. My quick fix was the following:

1. Create a folder called ""PS14"" on whichever Hard Drive has space. (in the MAIN HD folder, eg. C:\PS14)
2. Open the files in WinRAR.
3. Double-click on the folder called ""Pinnacle Studio 14 HD Ultimate Collection - by Mick""
4. Select everything in that folder EXCEPT the "".."" (I'm unsure if that matters, but this worked for me)
5. Click ""Extract to"".
6. Navigate to your ""PS14"" folder and select it.
7. Click ""OK"".

If done properly, no files will be created with a path over 260 characters. I did it this way and got no errors.

,Llamaduck,2010-10-14T11:22Z,"As for the actual installation...
If you are running Vista and you receive the error telling you that you don't have Windows Installer 4.5 installed...
1. Hit ""OK"".
2. If it gives you another error and doesn't go through the 3-or-so-minute setup, make sure your Windows Update service is Started. If it isn't started, it will not work.
3. Once the Windows Update service is started, Run the installation again.
4. After setup completes, it will tell you that you need to restart your computer. Do so.
5. When you logon to windows, the installation will continue automatically.

,Dufox,2011-01-08T01:59Z,"@ myuzer
you have to install graffiti directly into the studio14 plugin folder  

so open the graffiti installer after you have installed pinnacle 14 then when it asks you to pick a destination to install it click browse and unless you changed pinnacle go to C: Drive/program files/pinnacle/studio14/plugins   then click ok then install

ty mbb15, truly epic upload"

,sjbsd87,2011-09-13T22:01Z,"The ReadMe file has no information on installation. From Part01 (Why Part01-Part10?). I ran the Crack first (Pinnacle Pixie Activation 470) and then I ran Welcome.exe. Nothing happened. Nothing. No walkthrough, no installation process, no copyright agreement. It took 10 minutes to unload the file and then....Nothing. Soooo, how the hell do I install this thing? I'm on Windows XP. I was able to install this guys Pinnacle Studio 15 but it didn't let me install plugins so without the video effects the program was useless, so I uninstalled and opted for Studio 14 hoping it would allow plugins and have video effects, but it won't let me install. Why would it let me install Studio 15 but not Studio 14?"
,sjbsd87,2011-09-15T03:31Z,"Okay, so I finally got it to install, but just like with Studio 15, there are no video effects. What do I do to get video effects? They're all blurred out and unusable....."

,slitherdmd,2011-10-09T00:58Z,"To all those who say they can't find the video effects or whatever, just search a torrent for Sony Vegas Pro 8 so you can record what you want using Pinnacle, exit out once done, and drag the recorded files to Sony Vegas Pro 8. There you can add more than just some fade outs and in's but add Thermal Vision, increase brightness or contrast, make it night instead of day, etc. If you don't know how to do so, just search up want you're looking for on Youtube. Plenty of tutorials there!

,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-05-22T23:29Z,Just so you all know! The reason why you can not delete folders or copy them over is because this torrent has so many viruses in it. Do not let this person who hosted this torrent tell you other wise. The folders have embedded codes in them so they can steal your information on your PC! Do not waste your time downloading this unless you like being hacked!!!!!!
