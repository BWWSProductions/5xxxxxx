,FelatioSucks,2009-10-26T11:23Z,"the tracker is down as usual, it has nothing to do with this torrent. DHT will see you right. "

,nyder,2009-10-26T16:57Z,"hey, eztv, mr. shit for brains.
your tracker isn't working, so quit being a fucking lazy bastard and add:


http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

to your torrent so everyone that downloads it doesn't have to.

fucking wanker"

,IronBars,2009-10-26T17:49Z,I dont want to pay for it...dont even have the possibility to see this in my country.....why not add a tracker that works? I use bitlord and didnt find where to add a tracker....help appriciated...

,Cocio21,2009-10-26T18:32Z,only thing wrong with this torrent is that uploader is NOT useing the TBP Tracker Data....  either he doesÂ´nt read torrent comments or he just doesÂ´nt care (witch i belive as he uses EZTV tracker data) should be banned for this shit as he is makeing us help EZTV tracker users DL faster witch we at TPB get 0 gain from them..... act up nub
,Jonaleth,2009-10-26T19:43Z,"For fuck sake, piece of shit ungrateful bastards. If it wasn't for eztv you wouldn't get these series at all. You can either 1. Pay for it or, 2. Shut up and be fucking grateful that eztv does this for you, cause eztv sure as hell doesn't get paid for it. "
