,jaylc185,2009-10-27T22:14Z,"Finally, someone submitted it! I'll have to admit the camera quality is dull and it was kind of shaky. BUT I needed to watch this movie so much thankyou so much!"
,jaylc185,2009-10-27T23:47Z,"Actually, in response to my comment previously made... I'd just like to say that the quality is actually very good and you rarely shaked at all. Haha. "

,psilocybonaut,2009-10-30T17:34Z,"Thanks for the movie!  It's not the best cam, but very watchable...  I just wish that 5 minutes wasn't cut out of the middle... (""Sorry Guys"", haha)  I really liked the movie (except for the end), so I will wait until a FULL copy of it becomes available and download that too..."
,tomh2o,2009-11-01T01:37Z,wow why was this so hard to get?
,mikalgis,2009-11-15T12:04Z,"I agree on CAM - When it's not faked (some keep it dubious).  One can grasp the whole movie (on hurry) and come back later for a good rip...
Cheers! "
,EricMS00,2009-11-18T05:05Z,"FOR CLARIFICATION

This is the complete documentary. Both video and audio are complete, however you must use the free VLC media player. Do not use Windows Media Player or you will have issues with the sound.

The fake torrents are brought to you by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

http://www.healthyworldmessage.com/archive.php?id=99

Excerpt:
Moore's message, ""to those who call yourselves Christians (Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Bill Maherists, etc. . . .) has outraged some observers as grossly hypocritical considering his financial ties to ""PharmaMedia"" moguls advancing H1N1 vaccines, population controls, and New World Order politics and propaganda. 

Moore claimed to speak for the first time about his spiritual beliefs, cautioned against religious proselytizing, but ""did a great job promoting 'socialism' as a gross hypocrite working for the world's wealthiest Capitalists,"" says Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained expert in media persuasion and producer of In Lies We Trust: The CIA, Hollywood & Bioterrorism.       

""Moore 'yammers' about American war mongering, invading other countries, when his Big Pharma backers, a.k.a., Hollywood producers and billionaire media moguls, expand their wealth and population control agendas, including poisoning people with everything from napalm to FLUMIST,"" Dr. Horowitz warns.

Surely Moore knows that without propaganda driving military conflicts and pharmaceutical wars against AIDS, cancer, and crime, his Capitalist co-producers might go broke. War waging requires propaganda, and Hollywood delivers it, in this case funded by the same people Moore blames for America's failing economy."
