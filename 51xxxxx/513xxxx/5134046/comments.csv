,YURNXT,2009-10-24T08:55Z,"Cannot get it to work on Vista x64. Loads the slash screens fine then right before the main menu appears the application crashes. Run as administrator and in XP SP2 mode doesnt help.
Just a heads up:)"
[T],Knaster,2009-10-24T10:45Z,YURNXT it works for me though in Vista64. Only thing that doesnt work for me is the sound weird enough.
[V],Mbb15,2009-10-24T13:02Z,"@M4v3r1kk 

its better to post 3,4,5 saw torrents 

an example: you have 1 torrent with 50 seeders and 5000 leechers,
or you have 5 torrents with 10 seeders and 1000 leechers thats better"
,tibrusjer,2009-10-24T16:02Z,"Maybe, but some of the torrents will be let down since one or another have better seeds and the peepz go and download from that instead. "
[V],Mbb15,2009-10-24T16:20Z,yes I know
