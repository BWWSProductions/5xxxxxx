At 37, Harper Simon apparently doesn't mind taking after his pops, Paul, who used to showcase the young, guitar-playing Harper when he was touring on Graceland. Paul co-wrote two tracks on Harper's debut, a friendly album recorded with experienced session men, and you can hear the likeness in the serene alto Harper employs on songs like the wry, acoustic "Ha Ha." He also skews country, notably on the Byrds-y "Shooting Star." Sleepy lyrics like "Sometimes we all break down/When there's no friends around" show that Harper's tunes need more personality, but his well-crafted, breezily pretty melodies keep you coming back.
