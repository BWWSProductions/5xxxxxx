[V],Colombo-bt,2009-10-24T00:42Z,"Stop saying stupid things.
This is the final version. It's the build 7600.16385, which IS THE FINAL VERSION.
It's not BETA. It's not RELEASE CANDIDATE.

IT IS THE FINAL OEM VERSION!"
,lieffring,2009-10-24T02:06Z,This is not the final version it is still RTM Because My build number is 7600.20510 and im still RTM 
,stingrayyy,2009-10-24T03:43Z,"Does it matter, folks? After installation windows update will kick in and bring the computer to the present state."
,egalean,2009-10-24T10:36Z,muchas gracias ... que viva 50c3nt!!!
,alynr1972,2009-10-24T11:59Z,"""Does it matter, folks? After installation windows update will kick in and bring the computer to the present state."" 
 - What the hell are you talking here? Beta will update to Final Version by Windows Update? Are you stupid asshole?"
,mibrons,2009-10-24T12:05Z,"RTM = RELEASE TO MANUFACTURING! Manufacturing goddamn, not for testing purposes.

Everyone doubting this, just fucking go and buy the damn software from store, it sure is the ""final version"", but let me tell you a secret... (It is this same one)"
,uips750,2009-10-24T14:39Z,"is this is a same version , what you buy in shop ?

SRY bad english"
,alynr1972,2009-10-24T16:26Z,Ok i will download this. I hope is no difference betwen Retail and OEM and it is genuine! 
,xlxMAVERICxlx,2009-10-24T16:49Z,Everything downloaded very fast but the tutorial you provided doesn't work for me.  I guess that's what happens when I use a stock motherboard...oh well.

,heizzz,2009-10-25T22:38Z,"the final version is this :
Windows 7. 7.7600.16384.090710-1945"
,wardriver,2009-10-26T02:53Z,"Downloaded, installed, activated, updated and working great

thanks for this"
,Electr0,2009-10-26T05:53Z,"Ok. To clear up all this stupid faggotry:

1. RTM = Release to Manufacturing (As in ready to be released to the public / world)
2. This is the ""final"" OEM version. 
3. It's build number is 7600.16385
4. It's NOT the Beta
5. It's NOT the RC (Release Candidate - for testing)
6. If there are any updates, they will be installed when you use Windows Update
7. This is not (technically) a ""Genuine"" copy - because you haven't bought it! - But it will appear ""Genuine"" to Microsoft and anyone who uses it
8. Yes, it's the same version as if you went to a shop and bought it - it will do the exact same thing.
9. OEM basically means ""pre-installed on the computer before you bought it"". It is usually already activated and working. Retail means you ""bought"" it from a shop and you have to install / update it yourself and activate it yourself.

,xKoP,2009-10-26T09:32Z,"It is NOT the original!! I compared the hash-data against the ORIGINAL, and this one is not a valid Win7 image!! However, it could be the released version of the 22nd of Oct, but it is touched!! Only the x64 version is untouched, if hash-checked against the original hashes listed by Microsoft!! Crap, I've waisted 10 h downloading this."
,guenthar,2009-10-26T13:45Z,"Electr0: Sort of true but OEM is any version that isn't sold in a box and retail is a version sold in a box.  If you bought a copy that was in a sleave with the serial on a sticker on the sleave you got an oem copy.

That is pretty much what oem mean in both software and harware.  That even includes game consoles but oewm isn't very common in game consoles."
,guenthar,2009-10-26T13:49Z,I forgot to mention that if it is anything like how Vista was released then they treat the RTM version the same as the retail version and you can update it and there is no difference.  I downloaded the RTM version of Vista when it was first released on torrent and installed it and have never had a different version of Vista.  All updates work and I am currently on SP1.
,Azamato_the_Great,2009-10-26T21:11Z,"Can someone explain me what i specifycly have to do to install this? how do i do installl it ? pls help :)

,stayby,2009-10-27T16:09Z,"Hi guys, can anyone help me a bit. I have a brand new laptop HP probook 4710s and having problems with activation of this particular product. As it says no activation and no serials required, my comp says otherwise. Any clues how to activate this well protected HP notebook??
Apreciate it!! regards."
,momisi,2009-10-31T14:57Z,"Wow Top Software. I was always afraid to install or change the factory setting on my computer coz im not a computer expert. But it was easy to install this windows 7 and it really works like a dream. I can confirm this is the best download ever. I thank you 50c3nt, you are a awesome guy. GOD blessssssss youuuuu!"
,momisi,2009-10-31T15:00Z,My computer is working better than the original setting. I done update and its working like a real machine anyone would enjoy using. I wish i could know you 50c3nt coz you are not a selfish man. thanks mate....
,launcherx,2009-10-31T20:31Z,"Okay folks. I downloaded this and my view is this.. This torrent is totally %$#@ed up. 

1: Why is it that the boot screen looks like vista's when I boot from the DVD?
That's the first thing that caught my eye. It's like people just took bits of pieces of vista, then added in a BIG chunk of 7 to it or something.

2: I installed it and it didn't activate! This is no joke! I installed this darn thing and it told me I have 30 days left to activate it. I restarted my pc, I shut it down and started it back up, still says 30 days. I wasted so many freakin' hours downloading this, only to find that it's been tampered with and doesn't work? I think I am better off with XP or an original copy of 7 that I buy from the store or online. >.>

3: Be REAL! Don't put stuff up here, tell people it works and then when people get it, it turns out to be a piece of crap! >.< Don't LIE!
Some of us have high hopes and waste countless hours and bandwidth to get this! Seeding it is another story altogether.

Good luck to the rest of people who're downloading this... >.> It only works for some, and not for others. Waste of my bandwidth and time."
,rockstar99,2009-10-31T20:51Z,"@ launcherx

This copy of windows 7 works and updates itself. During installation a separate window pops up and remains blank for a bit, then the key is inserted. I would recommend you try installing it again, doing a ""custom"" install, and not clicking on anything unless prompted to do so."
,momisi,2009-10-31T21:03Z,"Guys, this software works. Follow the installation guide carefuly and its done. Its activated and you'll be able to update it all time. Im a baby on computer matters but if i could do it you'll probably do. Dont stress this download is free of virus and a real thing you need! Again thanks to 50c3nt."
,momisi,2009-10-31T21:18Z,"launcherx

Plz, take it easy. Do a ""custom"" installation you'll get there my Brother. This is the first time i did a big installation like. I was afraid if things go wrong coz i dont know much about computer. At first i feared doing it but after throwing that fear away i done the installation and things worked easy. My computer had no problem at all before but it is working better and better than before. I dont have more words to mean what this installation mean to me..!"
,blufyre,2009-11-01T14:10Z,"Many thanks 50c3nt.

No cracks needed. During install, it prompts you for a key. Just leave it blank. Later in the install, it just activates automatically.  This is RTM - the same as released on 22/10 but without all the manufacturer's crap added. Great!!! "
,spike2me,2009-11-05T04:54Z,This is NOT OEM. It asks for a serial key but you can click next. But you must put a serial key in to Activate. You have 30 days to activate. 
,cred1980,2009-11-06T10:44Z,have installed and all works fine it has a key but saying i have 29 days to activate but unable to activate is there a way round this 
,aarangio,2009-11-12T10:48Z,"Hi ya..
Thanks for the upload..works great!!
Could you possibly confirm if I will need another serial key in 30 days as one of the IT people where I work said that this was only a 30 day activation trial??
Thanks"
,crossebby,2009-11-17T12:41Z,"************ITS NOT OEM****************

 It will show OEM after installing and it will also show that ""your copy of windows is activated"" but only until U connect your system to internet.  Now its asking me to activate. Downloading crack now. I don't know why he lied."
,thunder9991,2009-11-20T23:17Z,"My question is, is there anyway to burn this onto a CD? i dont have a Dvd burner, althougth i do have DVD/CDRW.

Or maybe a workaround with daemon tool's?

,fourtwentyz,2009-11-24T13:36Z,"i downloaded this file and installed with no problems at all. i had to use removewat1.4 to remove the activation option in control panel but other than that, no problems whatsoever. i love win7. its a lot better than the fossil version of xp i had on my pc. thanks for the upload, works great!!"
,fourtwentyz,2009-11-24T19:51Z,"Also as a side note for people complaining about it showing it needs to be activated, it has a tool built into the installer that should automatically remove the windows activation tool from the OS but mine didn't. the easiest way around that is to download removeWAT 1.4 after the install is done and use that. once u restart your system you will notice that the activation option is gone from the control panel.
