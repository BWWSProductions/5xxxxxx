Thank you for uploading this rare film with Eric Roberts in a very unusual role.
You have made a mono VHS rip into a 3.6 Giga iso file, where the size cannot improve the quality of the original. The normal thing to do would be to make a 700 Mb rip of this iso file.
Moreover, you have made a rar package  with lots of irrelevant and unneccessary files. Most people have software to burn iso files and play them."
