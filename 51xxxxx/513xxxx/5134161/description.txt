Starring Eric Roberts (Julia's brother), this movie is based on a book by the same name, about near-death experiences. Saved by the Light is the true story of Dannion Brinkley, who has died three times, and lived to tell about it.

This rare 1 1/2 hour movie is not available on DVD, and has been transferred from VHS, by way of a Sony standalone DVD-R, then ripped with Magic ISO. Test burnt with Nero portable (included), and played fine on a $50 Philips DVD player.
 Enjoy, please seed =)
