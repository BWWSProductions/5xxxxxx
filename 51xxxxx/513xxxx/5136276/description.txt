I've been thinking for a while that I really miss the old sounds of drum & bass that kind of disappeared from the scene a few years ago. It's such a shame, because the tracks used to be heavy without bullshit. However, there are some very interesting styles developing with drum & bass right now, so I bundled and mixed some of that great innovativity with some of that raw oldskool sound.

Enjoy!
