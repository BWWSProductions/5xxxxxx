this the version that has a couple of words in French? or you actually get your hands on a bluray?"
,frenchyd252,2009-10-25T20:01Z,hey brick have u uploaded the original predator and predator 2 yet? im gonna do that next if u aint. Im downloading some mkv sources for them.
[T],bricktophd,2009-10-25T22:58Z,No this doesnt have any french spoken in it and it was a mkv that i coverted i got from a private site. Frenchy i havent done any Predator movies so go right ahead i be looking for them
,frenchyd252,2009-10-26T09:52Z,no probs i found a couple of old torrents 4 them on some public trackers there downloading pretty slow tho gonna take some time
,kube2,2009-10-26T19:39Z,I think I have pristines and it is mp4 format Looks a little grainy. A m2ts version would be nice.
,teabag87,2009-10-26T21:48Z,"kube2, actually.... the mp4's have better picture quality.  This is because of the 4gb limit.  The mp4's have a lower audio quality, so the video bit rate has room (under the 4gb limit) to be higher.

However, the m2ts format's that brick now uploads for us have a much much higher audio quality then the mp4's.  But, to make room for this higher audio bit rate (and keep the file size under 4gb) the video bit rate is sacrificed to make room.

Pristines are grainy because its either a HDTV upload, or because thats just how bad the original bluray looks.  there are some blurays out there that look just terrible"
,frenchyd252,2009-10-26T22:24Z,"yeh i will reencode them to m2ts as pristines rips dont use the ac3 audio codec that most peoples av recievers support (well mine dont neway only does dolby and dts!) the 1080p sources ive got arent bad a little grainy in places judging by the sample files, but these are old films they never look quite as clean as recent movies."
,frenchyd252,2009-10-26T22:31Z,nxt up is probably gonna b the usual suspects neway as im still downloading the others and gotta reencode em
,kube2,2009-10-27T00:20Z,"cool, I learn something every day.
The differences I've seen between the two formats must be due to the moves being older (i.e. Predator, The Thing) than the newer releases being uploaded. 
anyway, thanks to all the uploaders
I will seed to 2:1 or higher"
,besike,2009-10-28T07:14Z,"thx. u are getting better every day!!!
nice upload!"
,pipa_olt,2009-10-29T12:14Z,"help wanted.
why i'm I stuck at 36% and my utorrent says that this torrent has no seeders and here are 131?
anybody?"
,xiIix,2009-10-31T17:56Z,"These m2ts's are so clean and so small. I'm impressed dude. The nHD morons don't have a clue wtf they're doing, but this is really impressive encoding. You crushed the shit out of it and it still looks clean. It's amazing.

BTW, you should list Zoomplayer as one of the players for playback on PC. I've been using Zoomplayer for so many years now. I've tried using other players, but I always come back to Zoomplayer. It's just a great player."
[T],bricktophd,2009-11-02T00:47Z,im glad you like the encodes and i will be sure to add  Zoomplayer to my write ups
,z0rr0,2009-11-04T11:55Z,"Why do you guys keep making 1080p fit 4Gig! Most ppl use NTFS and most HD TV's that support external harddrives through usb also support NTFS.

It's just a waste in quality!!!!"
,vetri25,2009-11-04T14:55Z,"hi bricktophd..

if u can upload the DTS stream for UP(2009) DTS 5.1 1536 kbps.pls....

good quality....but resolution 720p is better for 5.3 mbps...thankz man good job..."
,unibrower,2009-12-07T12:20Z,"QUESTION: I tried streaming this from a WD Myworld NAS with Twonky installed, to the PS3 over ethernet but it stuttered every five seconds.  Any settings I need to change, or anything else I need to do?"
,xRnEx,2009-12-22T13:16Z,"hi guys,
first of all i want to say: supernice quality :D !
but,
i have this problem,
i converted the m2ts file to a avi file.
but i converted it to a 720p file.
and now the audio isnt synchrone to the video.
is this because i converted it to a 720p file ?
will the problem be solved if i convert it to a 1080p file ?"
,Spironic,2009-12-28T08:01Z,How are you able to lower the filesize to 4GB?  Did you lower the bitrate?  Non-PS3 (FAT32) versions of 1080p videos are usually between 7GB and 13GB. How are you able to maintain the full 1080p video with such a small filesize?  Is the FPS lower?  Or is the video quality dumbed down?
,kristie_b1,2009-12-31T15:33Z,"Help. The file is not done being downloaded. BUT when I try to play it (I know it will be choppy until completely downloaded, but I wanted to check if it was a real download of the movie)... well It plays STAR TREK 2009 and a few bits of UP. It's like its both movies in one. I don't even have Star Trek 2009 on my computer so I really don't understand why this movie starts playing!?"
,kristie_b1,2009-12-31T15:46Z,"Did you all seriously get the correct movie? I am downloading this and I am NOT getting ""Up."" I am getting Star Trek 2009. WTF?"
,mrcrazymongo,2010-01-03T08:00Z,"Hi, what aspect ratio is it in?"
,Ramsgate69,2010-01-20T13:04Z,Cheers mate
,NT100,2010-06-16T14:55Z,"Hmmm I downloaded it - and im streaming it to my ps3 through Vuze -- but it keeps skipping when i play, it doesn't play smoothly. Am i doing something wrong? Should i transfer the movie onto the ps3?"
,rdiaz910,2010-10-04T18:33Z,can you get transformers 1 (2007) i need that!! thanks
