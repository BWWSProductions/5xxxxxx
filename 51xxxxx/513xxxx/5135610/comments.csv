,thescribe,2009-10-31T05:55Z,"Not sure the protocol on comics requests, as I'm new here, but here's a few I simply cannot find and would love. Is this a space for requests of scans, or comics you know are scanned but are no longer seeded? Is the place to request? A couple I'd like to see:

King by Ho Che Anderson
Comic Book Tattoo (anthology) by Tori Amos
Flight v1-5
Amelia Rules
Alison Dare
Sandman Postcards (the only sandman related product I could never find scanned)
