Supernaut were an Australian glam/punk rock band from Perth, Australia formed in 1974 and disbanded in 1980

Formed in 1974 in Perth, Western Australia, Supernaut (originally named Moby Dick) had a short but successful career which yielded two straight top twenty singles (including a number one hit) and gold album status for their self titled debut album.

Supernaut were quickly signed up by Polydor after a recommendation from Ian "Molly" Meldrum (who produced their debut album) and burst on to the Australian charts with a number one hit in July, 1976 with "I Like It Both Ways". A follow up hit came in November, 1976 with "Too Hot To Touch", which reached number 19, from their self-titled album Supernaut.

In 1978 Supernaut relocated to Sydney and shortened their name, their hair and changed their attitude. They opted for punk/new wave garage style and became "The Nauts". They released an album (produced by Robie Porter) under that name in 1978. The album was widely acclaimed by critics but sales weren't forthcoming and they disbanded in 1980.
