For anyone who'se not sure, just install them individually. You'll probably run into 4 or 5 that don't apply to your system. Don't reboot after each install. Just keep clicking cancel and reboot once you've completed them all. 

To verify your version before and after, in regedit (type 'regedit' in your start menu search bar) and go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SOFTWARE Microsoft Windows NT CurrentVersion.

Thanks again, man."
