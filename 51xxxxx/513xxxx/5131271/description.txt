from canadianbands.com:

The epitome of Canadian pop best describes Loverboy. Never taken too seriously by the critics, the group got started in '79 when Calgary-based guitarist Paul Dean and drummer, Edmonton-native Matt Frennette left Streetheart and moved to the west coast. After a brief stint with a band Brian MacLeod was putting together as a sideline to Chilliwack (The Headpins) - Frennette's path crossed with Dean's again, when they met up with singer Mike Reno (real name Mike Rynoski) - ex Moxy singer, in Vancouver. 

Along with Doug Johnson on keyboards and bassist Scott Smith they began doing the BC circuit and were signed to Columbia Records later that year. They released their self-titled debut in the summer of 1980. The timing couldn't have been better for a simple yet slick approach to radio-friendly pop to have been on the scene. Dismissed by some as soft-core punk, others blasted them for being nothing more than teeny-bopper pleasers dressed in tight leather pants. Like them or not, if you lived in Canada in the '80's, you knew Loverboy. Backed by the singles "The Kid Is Hot Tonight" (co-written by Headpins' drummer Bernie Aubin) and "Turn Me Loose", and the "much more than filler" "Lady of the '80's" and"DOA", the album quickly went gold - then double platinum.
