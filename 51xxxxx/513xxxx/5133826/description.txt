RF Online, originally named 'Rising Force', (Korean: ë¼ì´ì§• í¬ìŠ¤) is a 3D free to play MMORPG developed by CCR.

The first version of the game was released in South Korea and was later followed by Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Brazilian and English translations. The North American/European version of the game launched its retail phase on February 21, 2006 and closed on November 10, 2008. RFO is currently a free to play game.

The EU/US game service was brought down as of November 9, 2008, due to licence expiration.[1]

However, the developers, CCR have started to relaunch the game hosting it themselves for EU/US[2] It released on January 18, 2009.

A mixture of science fiction and classic fantasy, RF Online (or RFO, as many of its players call it) is set in a distant planet in the Novus system where magic exists alongside high technology. Like most MMORPGs it follows the typical fantasy setting complete with swords and sorcery, but it also emphasizes the three-way Race vs. Race vs. Race (RvRvR) concept and modern/futuristic technology such as mecha and nuclear weapons.

The Bonus Content was added by myself so it's custom.
But it's definitely worth getting, this is what it includes;

- The RF Online Game Original Sountrack, 
  As well as a Game Music Rip (because they defer).
- A Wallpaper pack with various different wallpapers and resolutions.
- Two Icons that you can use for your game's shortcut.
- And a fansite kit of almost 31 MB!
