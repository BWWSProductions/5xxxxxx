NASTY OLD PEOPLE

This is Mette's story. Member of a neo-Nazi gang, her day job is to take care of four seniors that all are just waiting to die. Her life becomes a journey into a burlesque fairytale, where the rules of the game are created by Mette herself. Mette is indifferent about her way of life, until she one night assaults a man, kicking him senseless. Waking up the day after, she realizes that something is wrong, and accompanied by the crazy oldies, she longs for respect and love. Together, they create a world of their own. A world you never knew existed.

BEHIND THE SCENES
In the autumn of 2007 Hanna SkÃ¶ld took a private bank loan of 10 000 euro to make her debut feature film "Nasty Old People". Now she continues to ignore the middle men in the film industry by distributing it together with the film collective RÃ¥FILMâ€™s Luffarbion, aka Vagabond Cinema, and the file sharing site The Pirate Bay. In addition, she releases it under a creative commons license so that anyone can download, share or remix the film.
