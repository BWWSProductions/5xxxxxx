About Chipmunk

For someone who's just 18 Chipmunk has already achieved a lot - in 2008 he received a MOBO award for Best Newcomer, an Urban Music Award for Best Newcomer, and a nomination for Best Rapper at the American BET Awards, not to mention having racked up millions of plays across his MySpace and channels - and all when he was just 17. 

He's not new to the scene...at the age of 15 Chip started producing and self-releasing mixtapes, buying CDs in bulk and selling them to his mates at school. For his final mixtape, League Of My Own, he came together with Alwayz Recordings, together they then went on to release the much talked about single Chip Diddy Chip, reaching number 21 in the UK charts. 

More recently he's been working and touring with N-Dubz and featured on their album Uncle B. 
He also put his MC talents to DJ Ironik's top 5 single Tiny Dancer. 

Once his A-level exams are out of the way in June expect to hear a lot more from Chipmunk. 
Diamond Rings, will be released on 6th July, followed by the album I Am...Chipmunk in September
