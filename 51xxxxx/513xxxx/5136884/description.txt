FS 2004 - ANGLE OF ATTACK 767-300ER TRAINING VIDEOS


So, yet again an attempt to upload this torrent. I hope it won't be deleted for no reason again!


At first, I would like to thank rrodger99 for uploading the AOA 767 DVD. THANKS!!

However, 5.08GB is still qite a bit. ;) That's why I decided to recode the videos.
The result - all three videos in acceptable quality. As quality ensurance, you can download a 1 minute sample file, and decide if it's good enough or not.

This upload icludes also the areonautical charts used during the videos, as well as the 767-300ER Fuel Planner.


Enjoy!
