[V],RR-NE,2009-10-24T09:42Z,Where did you get this?
,BurnProcess,2009-10-24T18:29Z,I did some searching.  I eventually found it here on PB then converted it to PSP.
,BurnProcess,2009-10-24T22:22Z,"HR,
I did this, but after renaming the files and putting them in the VIDEO folder I get ""Unsupported Data"".  I converted my files to H.264 and the typical THM thumb file.  Regular MP4 would probably do a better job of playing out of the VIDEO folder, but the quality and size are not worth it to me.  If I knew anything about your way, I would do it that way.  Some of us just aren't that blessed.. ;)"
,BurnProcess,2009-10-24T22:23Z,"BTW, I have tried this in M33 5.00 as well as 5.50 Gen-B2, so I know it's not a firmware issue."
[V],RR-NE,2009-10-24T22:29Z,"Oh.. I thought you converted it from my version that I have.. lol, because my ""Twister was up just hours before yours"
