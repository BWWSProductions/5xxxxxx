I converted this specifically for PSP.  Enjoy the tornadoes.

Twister is a 1996 American disaster film starring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as "storm chasers" researching tornadoes. It was directed by Jan de Bont. The film was based upon a script by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin. Twister was the second-highest grossing film of 1996, with an estimated 55 million tickets sold.

In the movie, a team of storm chasers try to perfect a data-gathering instrument, designed to be released into the funnel of a tornado, while competing with another better-funded team with a similar device during a tornado outbreak across Oklahoma.

Twister is notable for being both the first Hollywood feature film to be released on the DVD format[1] and the last to be released on HD DVD.[2] Twister has since been released in high definition on Blu-ray disc. It was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound in 1997.
