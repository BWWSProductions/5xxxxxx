So I started with me understanding the episodes were each about 50 mins long and expecting 3 avi files of fifty minutes?

In fact you end up with 4 *.avi files for 3 ""stories"" speared over 8 episodes which I think breaks down as follows:

File				Content
Episode 1	.avi		Season 1 Story 1 ""The Mad Woman in the Attic""     Parts 1 & 2 = 1h 39 min
Episode 2 cd1.avi	Season 1 Story 2 ""To Say I Love You"" 	                  Parts 1 & half of 2 = 1h 08 min
Episode 2 cd2.avi	Season 1 Story 2 ""To Say I Love You""                    Parts half of 2 & 3 = 1h 24 min
Episode 3.avi		Season 1 Story 3 ""One Day A Lemming Will Fly""  Parts 1 & 2 = 1h 37 min

Hope this helps. Sorry if it makes it worse!

Thanks again to .BONE."
