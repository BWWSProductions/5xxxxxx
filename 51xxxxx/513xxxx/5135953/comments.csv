,Bilderbooger,2009-10-25T18:33Z,"Was this made for TV, like Lifetime For Women? A truly crappy movie.

The car chase scene, was enough to force me to immediately delete it. 

How many shots were fired from a machine gun, which you could hear supposedly hitting the vehicle? And yet there were no bullet holes in the car, but their tire was blown out, so instead they made a run for it on foot.

The stupid people that made this stupid movie should be shot, with real bullets that make real bullet holes.

But the video and audio quality were excellent!"

,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-01T00:20Z,"shittiest movie ever

I think I'll watch this just because Brian Krause is in it. I'm a sucker for B (boring) movies :-P "

this movie seems to be something with my personal favourit as actor Briand Krause, he's the best out there and for you guys who say's i'm wrong then leave to yourself because i'm not wrong!

Well i will see if this is a good movie or not, i think this is gonna be one of his big shot movies can't wait to see it :D:D:D !"
,vrul,2009-11-06T01:00Z,"ok i change my mind...

this is by  the worst movie i've ever glued my eyes on...

i mean that car chase makes no sense and what that's making even less sense is when they shoot at it they only get the tires, i mean OMFG!

WORST MOVIE EVER!"
,Valle9,2009-11-06T10:46Z,"i hadn't seen this one but from the stuff i read at imdb.com i could tell that this is going to be a shity hour.

PLEASE trust me - this is 1 hour and 27 minutes you will want back immediately.  I kept watching the timer to see how much more I had to endure - that never happens.

However, the quality of the rip was excellent.  Sadly, that was the best part of the movie."

,orinvee,2009-11-12T13:49Z,"This was one of the greatest movies of all time...go see it in a theater!

For those complaining about the machine gun bullets only hitting the tires and not the car body...

...well, it's obvious that they used rubber-seeking bullets...

DUH!

And the title of the movie made me realize how good it was going to be...

I used to own a Chevy Nova and it was my next favorite car, right after my Yugo...

I've always wanted a Super Nova...

Anyway, after watching this, I can't sleep at night...I've become a night watchman.

One question...were any stars harmed in the making of this movie?"
,smokkapi,2009-11-12T18:08Z,"This a terrible, terrible movie.

Then this piece of aids appeared on my screen.
And as somebody pointed out. kidding with aids isen't cool.
Its serious. And everybody involved in the production of this movie has fullblown aids. Not hiv, AIDS! 
And they will suffer a horrible death. And this movie is their mark on the world.

I think it's so funny that every moron that decides to bad mouth America and it's citizens uses, watches and loves what our country produces.

Hypocrites are funny.

What's more is that you, razzal_ghul, have decided that the random nature of weather will target a single country because it has broken some rule that you have decided is sacred. Does that mean that Indonesia broke some rule of yours too? So many innocent people died in 2004 that they must have committed some crime. At least by your standards.

If you're looking for some nice insults, try ""The Secret of Monkey Island"" or any of the games in that series. You'll be able to enjoy some insult-sword-fighting or insult-arm-wrestling.
