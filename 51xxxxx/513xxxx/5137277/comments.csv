3) after install if your cpu amd and your os Windows XP try install amdcpusetup.exe from install game directory -> Support.
4) start game (from desktop shortcut, or launcher)

if directx dll missing, install fresh directx from microsoft web install."

,tomt123,2009-10-31T13:19Z,"Hey, hate to be someone else posting a problem, but I really don't know whats going on.

Finally finished downloading and everything, mounted it just fine with Daemon Tools.
I go to install it, and it starts installing and this black box comes up, this arc thing?
Only stays on 0.3% and never goes up. I've exited it and it says installation finished, but then I can't play the game, says somethings missing like the .exe

any ideas?"
,tomt123,2009-10-31T14:21Z,"Its the black box that says data arc. Supposed to be extracting the files. Once its finished it says I can play the game, but it never loads.

Also, when installing, it never comes up with anything past:
 Output folder: C:\Program Files\Borderlands
Extract: Arc.exe... 100%
Execute: C:\Program Files\Borderlands\arc.exe x ""F:\data\data.arc""

Hope you can help."

,d7jedi,2009-11-03T05:21Z,hello i have the same problem as tornt123 and calvron. the arc extractor seems to stay at 0.3% and after a few minutes closes itself and says the installation is finished. the 2k games folder is only 11.7 mb. any help mr. ex_exist?
,Screamroot,2009-11-03T20:45Z,THE Perfect torrent... Bravo
,R0LEM0DEL,2009-11-04T08:27Z,For anyone having the problem where setup stops at 3%. Try turning of your antivirus. I had the same problem wit Left4Dead by TPTB (Great Game - Love TPTB). Antivirus tend to block the installation 'silenty'. For safety diconnect from the internet and install the game- restart the machine and connect internet again. 
,Tyronian,2009-11-05T04:07Z,"I just tried it online, and it is fully functional as of 11/4/2009, all you gotta do is make a gamespy ID.... THATS IT... (sadly online play is a no-go for me since im on satalite internet)"
,d7jedi,2009-11-05T13:55Z,"Any words from others who stop at 0.3% ?
Im sorry rolemodel but i have tried your suggestion and it hasn't worked...
If it is any help i have a mcafee antivirus and i have disabled it by making sure it doesnt turn on during startup. Have you tried this method and confirm that it works? (on this torrent not l4d) pls reply..."
,Psiuniek,2009-11-06T20:11Z,Any words from others who stop at 0.3% ? I have this proble too. 
,Psiuniek,2009-11-07T11:42Z,Up. 
,peewee533,2009-11-14T05:08Z,"For those with the problem of it getting stuck at 0.3%, just wait longer.. for me the time remaining kept going up and up til about 100 hours then it moved. Just be patient."

,PirateSantana,2009-11-19T20:58Z,"Great download, it works amazing. For anyone getting the error on startup, get the latest version of DirectX from Microsoft. 

Question: I can't seem to patch the game. Whenever I attempt to, and run the game, it asks for me to insert the CD for the game. I noticed Exist said something about patching it through the registry and not to run the exe. How do you do this so it works?"
,tmanman,2009-11-21T01:34Z,How to you update borderlands with a patch??????

,pgfizzle,2009-12-01T05:07Z,"I'm getting the same problem as everyone else. Stuck on the 0.3% extraction. I've tried turning off antivirus and internet, nothing happens. And I've tried just waiting it out, but it hasn't moved and it's at 345 hours. So, waiting isn't helping me."
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-06T05:16Z,"How do you patch this correctly? (patch 1.0.1)
I screwed up somehow on the patching (had to reinstall game) Torrent and download of game was great no problems)
plz reply"
,polobow,2009-12-07T16:35Z,"When i start the game i gives no error but i only see black, then after a few seconds my computer restarts. can anyone help me?"
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-07T20:15Z,"@polobow
are u sure your system can handle it?
and are u using vista? how often does it go black (everytime u try to start it or only sometimes)?"
,polobow,2009-12-07T22:44Z,"Hmm... nevermind what i said in last comment. I re-installed it and immediatly did the setup and played it. i got error d3dx9_dll. .  However i probally think thats because i didnt mount or burn anything. But i dont get that point...

mount Borderlands.PlayBay.iso

i didnt see any file with .iso :/. Can any1 help?

If it's not clear, please say."
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-07T23:55Z,"http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/pop.php?d3dx9_41

here try this, then OPEN WITH borderlands
i didn't need to mount it, u have too? O.o

P.S. can anyone tell me how to patch without screwing it up? i really want to play online -_-"
,polobow,2009-12-08T00:05Z,"Thank you for that :O. But do i have to unistall everything again? Cause, ( i extracted it to desktop ) when i use it /w borderlands, it says: C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop\D3DX9_41.dll is not a legal Win32-application."
,polobow,2009-12-08T20:23Z,"I tried it again, but now it seems i have an .ICO file , instead of an .ISO file... what i do now?"
,polobow,2009-12-08T20:33Z,"(sorry for spam :l. i really wanna play >.< )
Randomguysayshi, can you tell the exact thing u did so u could make it play?
So if u mounted anything and did what first...."
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-08T21:41Z,"well ,i dunno about u but i have windows vista 64-bit.
I extracted the downloaded files to desktop (unzipped the main folder that had the setup,I didn't know what the 32 byte text file was for so i left it alone) and put it into a folder. 

(arc extractor successful)
the first time i opened it, it said file D3DX9_41.dll
wasn't there (so i downloaded it)

Then I dragged the D3DX9_41.dll file to desktop and i right clicked and selected ""Open With..."" and selected desktop>shortcut of borderlands and then it loaded.
Then there was a message saying a map couldn't be found and asked if i wanted to load the default map instead so i said yes and it played.
Note: I am a noob at this, I fiddled around a LOT of stuff. *Not a computer genius -_-"""
,polobow,2009-12-08T21:58Z,"Lol, i just found out, and i think thats the big problem why alot of douchebags ask how to mount, is that the file u extracted, IS the iso file T_T.
So, i mounted it and did all the steps. im going to do step 3 now. I'll give an answer when it works =)."
,polobow,2009-12-08T22:12Z,"Nope, didn't work.
I did all the steps, and when i used D3DX9_41.dll on borderlands, i said:
C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop\D3DX9_41.dll is not a legal Win32-application."
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-09T00:43Z,"uh i think its a directX file.
So try downloading the newest directX file from somewhere. Google it? O.o"
,polobow,2009-12-09T08:12Z,"This is just... Q_Q....

Look. I iso'd the wizip file. i did every step and such. and when i used the dll, i used it not on the launcher T_T.. SOOO stupid. I tryed it once on the borderlands launcher, and he did it :D. Randomguysayshi, without your help i couldn't playing this awesome game now. Thanks!"
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-09T21:54Z,"Great, Now can someone out there tell me how to patch this (correctly) and play online? -_-"
,polobow,2009-12-10T21:48Z,"Maybe i know...

Go to here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5167164/Borderlands.Patch.1.01-RELOADED

Look at the second page of comments, then the first one. He's called 'Bokii13'. He describes it pretty well. i myself didn't try it, though."
,orlo9,2009-12-11T06:56Z,"thanks polobow for the patch link it saved me some time in figuring why the proper patch update wasn't working 
for those of you who are having problems you need to extract the data i recommend using 7zip for this then mount the disk image using daemon tools or  something like it then hit install you might need the like that Randomguysayshi posted for your missing piece
also this is a great torrent with nice compression thank you"
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-12T03:20Z,Did anyone try what polobow said to patch it correctly? Cause i really dont wanna screw up and end up deleting my character data and game and redownloading it.
,polobow,2009-12-13T02:01Z,"Well, i installed it, and didn't look at 'Bokii13' but 'Oreo2996' . Much simpler. After i installed it how he said it, i could play. Also online. But i couldn't find any games. Probally because i had to open ports.

HOWEVER. patch 1.20 is out. U need this to play online. I have nothing seen on piratebay that has borderlands patch 1.20. So, all we do is wait :*(.



Also, Randomguysayshi, can you pm me your MSN? Cause then we don't have to say this all in piratebay comments :L."
,Randomguysayshi,2009-12-14T00:11Z,"I have no idea how to pm on this site.
how? or can u tell me yours? (i use aim.)"
,polobow,2009-12-14T16:34Z,"Damn, i use MSN :/."
,polobow,2009-12-14T16:35Z,"Well, u can mail it to my spam mail:

,HLG_Haxor,2009-12-21T06:23Z,"I installed and have been playing no problems. Great game BTW. Tried playing online, but you need the latest patch and after installing it wouldn't let me open the game and had to reinstall.
