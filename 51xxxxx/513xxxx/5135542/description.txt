If you've been yearning to create games but have been frustrated by the complexity of programming languages such as C++ or Java, you've come to the right place!

Blitz3D provides a simple yet powerful environment for game creation - simple, because its based around the popular and easy to use BASIC programming language; and powerful, thanks to a highly optimized underlying 2D/3D engine.

Blitz3D includes many commands to help you out with game creation - but not too many! Rather than confuse you with tons of commands, Blitz3D's command set has been carefully designed to provide maximum flexibility for minimum effort.

Can you write commercial quality games in Blitz3D? Why not - others are! Great titles such as Best Friends, Wonderland and Juno Nemesis were written in Blitz. In fact, many shareware authors are moving to Blitz from languages such as C++ due to the faster development time.
