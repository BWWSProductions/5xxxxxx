Annie has terrible luck with pets. She's killed hamsters and mice and lizards and birds. For a domesticated animal, getting Annie as an owner is akin to a death sentence. But when Annie finds a little beastie named Ojo in a drain pipe, has her karma really changed or is she destined for more disappointment?

Written and illustrated by Sam Keith (The Maxx).
