In the past I already downloaded some apps by your torrents. I have never said thanks for that.
Well, here it is: thank you for your contributions. Most of it useful stuff. Peace."
[V],polisdavid,2009-10-24T03:13Z,"Hi Widowlicker,

Thanks for the comment, and you're welcome.  I only try to upload apps that I personally use.

To all - you're welcome as well. 

Enjoy this app - it's been around ""forever"", and has helped me out many situations when I couldn't open a graphics file in Photoshop.  Just open in GC and resave."
