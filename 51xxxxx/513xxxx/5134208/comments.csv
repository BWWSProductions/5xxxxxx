,ozc,2009-10-25T00:14Z,"--------------------------------
I'm not sure why these are labeled HDTV when they're shrunk to 624x352.
16:9 HDTV is either 720 or 1080 lines of horizontal resolution. 4:3 Standard Definition TV is 480 lines interlaced. This is essentially progressive Standard Definition.

,ozc,2009-10-25T00:15Z,pimpmobile butthurt much?
,rct999,2009-10-25T00:23Z,stop wining if you dont like the show -> stop watching. nobody wants to read ur lame comments at every download ^^
,HamsterXX,2009-10-25T00:32Z,There is not much action in this new series at all. I hope this series gets better before it ends. Thanks though for the up.
,capnpat,2009-10-25T00:35Z,"wow...some ppl really don't like this show...well i'm a stargate fan and while the pilot ep left me wondering a little, its just the pilot...lots of shows take a few eps to grow on you...if ur a TRUE stargate fan, you'll like the show...it does have some growing pains though... :-)"
,capnpat,2009-10-25T00:38Z,"...and thx for the UP eztv..as always.
@ ozc....i believe the HDTV label is just to show the source was HDTV, rather than to define what rez the up is in...to let us know why the file size is so big, comp's to the standard ups...but that's just my guess..."
,dxmjunky420,2009-10-25T02:02Z,Who knows a free streaming link to UFC 104 tonight ???? to watch free :D
,horse1bun,2009-10-25T08:47Z,"Anyone is entitled to their opinion, but so far I see great plot dynamics and character developments. A good plot takes longer to setup and a lot of pressure is on the creators. I could give specifics as to why I think it will be a strong series, but it would do no good. People see what they want it to be and rarely appreciate anything for what it is."
,horse1bun,2009-10-25T08:49Z,"By The Way, Why Is there a RE-Pack? I didn't see anything wrong it, which just re-affirms my previous comment. LOL.
ANYHOW, I have switched to the RE-Pack."
,horse1bun,2009-10-25T08:54Z,"I'm Stupid. The Re-Pack is .mkv, High Def for those who prefer quality over quantity.
But someone tell me why on earth there are 5 duplicates of the same episode? There should be at most like two. Seems a bit redundant to me."
,duxs,2009-10-26T18:36Z,"First time commenter, thank you EZTV, thank you very much..."
