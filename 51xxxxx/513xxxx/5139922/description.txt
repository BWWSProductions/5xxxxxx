From Wiki:





Anthrax is an American heavy metal band from New York City, formed in 1981. The band was one of the most popular of the 1980s thrash metal scene and is notable for being the first to combine heavy metal with rap music. When thrash metal began to gain a major following in the mid-late 1980s, Anthrax were dubbed one of the "big four" of thrash metal alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer.







Spreading the Disease 1985


Spreading the Disease is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax and the first with vocalist Joey Belladonna and bassist Frank Bello. The album was released in October 1985 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island in the United States and in March 1986 by Island Records globally.

The band produced the album with Carl Canedy, Jon Zazula serving as executive producer. The album includes the single "Madhouse".

A music video was produced for "Madhouse" as well, but didn't receive much airplay because it was banned by MTV, who believed the content to be degrading to the mentally ill.

This was the last Anthrax album to feature songwriting from fired vocalist Neil Turbin, who is given songwriting credit on the songs "Armed and Dangerous" and "Gung-Ho". Songwriting credit was shared to the track "Medusa", the first and only songwriting contribution from former producer Jon Zazula. Originally he was credited as the sole writer of the song, but reissues credited the rest of the band to it as well.

Among the Living features a drawing of Reverend Henry Kane, from the film Poltergeist II: The Other Side, tipping his hat.

This was the last album to feature songwriting by original bassist Danny Lilker, who, despite having left the band after 1984's Fistful of Metal, was continuously credited as the co-writer of certain songs for the next two albums. On Among the Living, he is credited as the co-writer of the songs "I Am the Law" and "Imitation of Life."

The album was dedicated to the memory of Cliff Burton.

In 2000 the album was released in Germany as a double album along with Persistence of Time.

Persistence of Time 1990


Persistence of Time is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. The album was released in 1990 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island Entertainment.

The album includes the singles, "Got the Time" (a Joe Jackson cover) and "In My World" (which was performed by the band on an episode of Married...With Children.)

Anthrax returned to the studio in the fall of 1989 with Mark Dodson (who produced the previous album, State of Euphoria) to start work on their fifth album. Recording of the album was difficult, with a large structure fire causing the band to lose more than $100,000 worth of gear and their recording studio in January 1990. Following their personal disaster the band moved to a different studio in late February of that year to finish work on the album.

The lyrical focus of Persistence of Time is the need for tolerance and peace. This would be the last Anthrax studio album to feature Joey Belladonna on vocals. The introduction to the song "Intro to Reality" featured dialogue from an episode of The Twilight Zone called "Deaths-Head Revisited".

The beginning riff on "Belly of the Beast" (The Greater of Two Evils version featuring John Bush) is from the Celtic Frost song "Dethroned Emperor", which Anthrax themselves later did a cover of, which appeared on the EP Summer 2003 and as a bonus track on certain editions of Stomp 442.

Persistence of Time was certified gold by the RIAA. Its highest Billboard Music Chart position was #24 on the Billboard 200 chart.

Sound of White Noise is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax, released in May 1993 on Elektra Records. It is the band's first album with former Armored Saint vocalist John Bush, and also their last studio album with guitarist Dan Spitz.

The band and Dave Jerden produced the album, which includes the singles, "Only","Black Lodge", "Room for One More" and "Hy Pro Glo". This album marked a change in the sound of the band, mixing the old thrash metal with new grunge references (Dave Jerden was the producer of Alice in Chains) and the album got Anthrax's highest ever chart position, debuting at #7 on the Billboard 200 charts, with "Only" and "Room For One More" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time. Sound of White Noise was certified gold by the RIAA.

Anthrax also contributed a song from these sessions called "Poison My Eyes" 7:05 to the Last Action Hero soundtrack.

The title "C11H17N2O2S Na" is the chemical formula for sodium pentathol. The closing of the album, which appears at the end of the song "This Is Not an Exit" includes a sample from the 1991 movie "My Girl".

A music video was produced for "Black Lodge", which features Jenna Elfman as the lead role in one of her first film appearances. The Black Lodge is a fictional place from the television series Twin Peaks, which Twin Peaks's score conductor Angelo Badalamenti helped write.

This was released on LP in Europe (Catalog Number 7559-61430-1). The song "Black Lodge" was omitted from this vinyl release due to time.
