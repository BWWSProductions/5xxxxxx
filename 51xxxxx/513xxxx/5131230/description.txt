[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin - October 19, 2009: Quantum to Cosmos (Q2C) Festival - Are We Bound For Space?[/b]

[u]The Debate: Are We Bound For Space?[/u]

April 12, 1961: Yuri Gagarin becomes the first person to leave earth and travel into space. But in the near half-century since that day, only 500 others have taken that special voyage. Is that now about to change? Do problems here on earth mean we should start thinking about a new home in outer space?
