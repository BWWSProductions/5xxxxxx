Plus for a band like Spandau you really should have full quality for the videos.  I literally bought a brand new copy of the album with DVD and just copied it straight onto the computer instead of compressing it down like this one.

Grab my Reformation Tour DVD if you want, it's full size DVD-9 format.  Only worth that quality really, no point in compressing down to DVD-5 because there is a good documentary about the very first return of tour gig..."
