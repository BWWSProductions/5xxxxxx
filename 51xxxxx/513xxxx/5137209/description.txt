Also, something to keep in mind. 

Compare the violence and number of arrests on 9-12 (No violence, no arrests)
                       to
the violence and number of arrests at the G20(lots of violence, lots of arrests)

I actually have a friend who is a cop who was at the G20 and he said it was horrible. He couldn't stress to me enough how out of control it was.

those environmentalist liberals really practice the "peace and tolerance" they preach...
