100% clean."
,PedroDaG,2009-11-01T18:38Z,"@jmb2012 - Thanks a bunch for the blazing fast torrent (Avg. 2.5MB/sec d/l). I can't wait to try this program out. I had been waiting for this for a while.

@fukdalaws - that's because AVG sucks anymore. Bloated, STUPID amounts of false positives, dropping real detection rates, etc. When in doubt, u/l the file to either virusscan.jotti.org or www.virustotal.com, let them run the file against a battery of antimalware apps.
"
,bendskier,2009-11-02T11:57Z,"I followed the steps... and it is still running (great, I might add!) but it is still in the ""demo"" mode...

So do I register it now that I copy and pasted the .dll files?

thanks!"
,sco7735,2009-11-08T18:57Z,The Demo version works sweet but i posted the cracks after i ran the program so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it again but the cracks are'nt there now? Do i need to download it again?
[T],jmb2012,2009-11-08T23:12Z,Yea you probably cut instead of copied the cracks the first time download them again.
,jameswsparker,2009-11-09T07:08Z,"Hey fukdalaws, don't worry; there's no virus. 

AVG reports near-enough any popular crack, keygen, or 'illegal' modification or reverse-engineered program as a virus or trojan. 

Be sure to turn off your anti-virus and keep a back-up copy of the crack in a compressed zip file or something, as AVG has a trick of corruping the file beyond repair. "
,bendskier,2009-11-13T15:31Z,"I'm still in demo mode.

All cracks copied and pasted into folders.

Do I register it online, and create a user account and password?"

,Samhain90,2009-12-27T18:07Z,"For the morons who cannot read the info file:
1: Torrent the damn thing

2: Should have three objects (1 Folder labeled Cracks, 1 FL Installer, 1 Notpad file labeled Info)
BE SURE YOUR INTERNET IS OFF!

3: Install FL to whatever your heart's desire but UNCLICK run, so when you click finish, it does not run.

4: After install go into the ""Cracks"" folder, then go into the FL folder on your computer. Should be easy, my computer > C: > Program Files > Image-Line

5: After finding the FL folder, go into ""FL Studio 9"" and copy the FL Crack from the cracks folder, to the FL Studio folder. REMEMBER: Copy and REPLACE the files.

6: After doing so, go into the folders marked ""Poizone"" and copy that crack into the ""Poizone"" folder in the install directory.

7: Do the same thing for the other cracks, except be sure to match name with folder.

8: After getting everything right, be sure to re-boot as a ""Just-in-case"" factor. (It's what I do, I never have problems)

9: If you do not get this? Too damn bad."

Also as a note to people having trouble with the pastches put the file (FLEngine.dll) in C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 9

and put the plugin files in there respective folders C:\Program Files\Image-Line\*****

Note: do not touch the files in the directory  C:\Program Files\VSTplugins because these or used by other programs

All the directories mentioned are default
and a final recommendation use the asio driver instead of the sound card driver"

For those having trouble installing:

Just install like you normally would, then open the crack folder. Copy the one for the program, not the plugins. Go to your C:/ drive and follow the directory to the FL Studio 9 folder, and paste the crack. Copy and replace, and you should be good to go. 

Also I installed on Windows 7, so if anyone was wondering, no problems on Windows 7.

copied engine.dll file to the Fl Studio 9.0 file but it never asks ""would you like to replace or keep both files"" it just copies it there.

basically there is no file there in the first place to be replaced by the crack file.

Anyone have a fix for it?"

,xxTaienxx,2011-02-28T08:40Z,"if the installer will not load you most likely have a 64bit like I.. bc it does the same to mine, in task manager it is lised as an active process that sucks up 50-60% of CPU resources but nothing happens. If you're using WIn7 you will notice a *32 by the process which means it is for a 32bit. Mind ou win7 64bit has backwad capabilities, yet seem to be buggy and not function for all 32bit programs.. apparently this is one of them. Solution? Find a 64bit.. anyone?"

So you go to the download location and u right click on flstudio_9.0 and select properties. Select the compatibilaty tab at the top and then under Compatibility mode check the little box and select Windows XP Service Pack 3. then at the bottom under Privelege Level select RUN AS ADMIN and click apply. Try it out you should be good to go!

,wuzzex,2011-12-26T00:01Z,"It seems that many are complaining about Virus detection. I got a virus detection, but I allowed it anyways because I have an IQ high enough to understand that Virus Detection alerts at stuff which wants to deal with/open things in the system.
For an example, many Trainers are detected because they need to go into the game directory.

Tl;dr. It is not a Virus"
,aldog24,2012-01-16T07:02Z,Great it works! 
,NegativaX,2012-01-27T16:44Z,"@wuzzex

Since my IQ is higher than yours, I will put my 2 cents in as well.  

Seems as though people that think they know what the fuck they are talking about instantly scream ""FALSE POSITIVE NOOBS GG!!!!1111""

Idiots. 

For one, the trial version you get from Image-line's website, is INFECTED.  Not a false positive, legit infected

Secondly dumbfucks, you are not even addressing the file in question.

OCsetupHlp.dll is adware.  This is not a false positive, as it is detecting it for what it is (again, you're a dumbass).

What's funny is that you can actually google this shit.  Did you even bother to research shit before you typed your dumb bullshit?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCandy

So you see, opencandy is bullshit, but it legitimately comes with the program.  I for one say fuck FL studio because of this, there are better programs anyway, they can take OpenCandy and shove it up there ass.  Microsoft Security Essentials says it is adaware (which the wikipedia article mentions it would), but just because it legit comes with the program does not mean it is not bullshit software, cuz it is, cuz I let it install and it fucks shit up and opens unauthorized connections (used process explorer).
