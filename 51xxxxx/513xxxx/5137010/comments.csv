,Gogoplex,2009-10-26T20:27Z,nice down speed. 15MB/s + :D 
,Blue_Flames,2009-10-27T01:33Z,"Ah Jonny ... can't you guys just get along?

Also, this release has, better vid bitrate, the commentary (I kinda miss them from when I actually used to, you know, buy all my films), the shorts -and- it still fits on a d/l disc ... gets my vote."
,Hardcode,2009-10-27T04:28Z,"Sorry jonny, I'm with Blue_Flames.  This release is much better all around and despite having fewer seeders than the other, it downloaded much MUCH faster.

Thanks BOZX!

(jonny, don't take it personally, I also often enjoy your releases)"
,w000ter,2009-10-27T05:41Z,yup no use complaining about dupe when bitrate is clearly different.

,Gia_anainah,2009-11-20T23:02Z,when i downloaded it the audio wasn't in sync anyway i can fix that ?
,teohhanhui,2009-11-30T10:00Z,English subtitles are not included but subtitles for other releases seem to work just fine (I tried one for ESiR's).
,Sublime865,2009-12-01T22:27Z,"And Jonny, you are an asshat.

No one likes split rar files. It is ridiculous to add the processing time and space requirements of extracting a single movie file. go back to the 90s when the sheer speed of dial up was the greatest thing since sliced bread and the crc checksum benefit of split rars wasn't COMPLETELY obsolete by EVERY bittorrent client out there. Useless, redundantly so; annoying; and used by fakers to mislabel files back in the day. Man my list keeps growing! Maybe I'll just download BOZX's file, there seems to be nothing to hide or hidden in THIS torrent.... "
,kristie_b1,2009-12-31T11:03Z,"My download is going from 0 to 4kb/s!!

SEED!!"
,downpayment,2010-01-03T00:57Z,"@nitsujz   sounds like its a codec issue to me. i use wmp 11 with klite codec pack. try reloading your codecs or new ones. (klite likes to delete old codecs, tell it no. bad klite) Thanks for the upload BOZX. Im kind of curious to dl -jonny-'s and see how much of a dif the bitrate makes. cant be much of any."
,hanqin81,2010-01-15T17:00Z,"what's with this torrent man? My download rate is like 2kb - 10kb. there are way more leechers than seeders.

Please seeeeeeeeeeed..."
,hazard92,2010-01-25T01:44Z,"why am i the only person seeding this??!

i can't promise i'll be seeding this for much longer"
,fransfl,2010-02-04T20:02Z,Why DHT was disabled for this torrent? This is really a stupid thing!
,somedude.1001,2010-02-08T07:30Z,"v/a 10/10 (obviously)

,SergeantSpoon,2010-03-07T20:50Z,"Download speed: 500-600 kb/s

,balok,2010-06-02T12:54Z,"@vanquish747

,CovertOPSDragunov,2010-06-09T07:11Z,lol i m stuck at 98 percent and been downloading this for 3weeks and 5days
,Nodrog2000,2010-10-17T01:43Z,"hey guys, if someone could start uploading this torrent again, it would be greatly appreciated! =D thanks!"

,BobaFett_X1,2011-08-05T12:47Z,"Average Movie, not as Good as Toy Story but still decent. Wasn't Really worth downloading the 1080p version though.
M-7.5
A-10
V-10"
,ilovemkvs,2011-09-09T03:44Z,"V: 10
A: 10
M: 10

Perfect quality and looked amazing on my TV (much better than any of the 720p's I found).

Thank you so much, BOZX."
