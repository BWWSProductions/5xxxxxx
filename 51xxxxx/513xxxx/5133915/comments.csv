,vigelante,2010-07-26T16:49Z,can somebody seed? i have 84%but now is totally blocked... please help...
,blackxino,2010-11-27T05:32Z,"thanks for uploading but a fatal effort at uploading this!

around 0:27min in the movie the video slows down by frames and audio cuts off!

The hardsubtitle is nice but timing is off sometimes and definitely different to what they say on screen!

No point!
I deleted this torrent, I'm gonna buy this on Bluray instead!
The picture quality will be good so I wouldn't see any bitstreaming blocks and subtitles will be on par with speech and english will be updated."

However, being of obsessive compulsive nature :o) I also dl the 3.2 GB
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6280695/Hero_2002_%28Dual_Audio%29_720p_BRRip_H264_%28Evade%29

While this 10 GB has *slightly* higher res, the 3.2 GB version has significantly better quality/size ratio (pretty much by a factor of 3 ;-)  (I could only see a *tiny* difference by pixel peeking, and even that was hard) 

So I'll delete this version and keep the 3.2 GB.

... Actually - based on the pixel noise - This *may* be a 720p upscaled to 1080p??, with the added ""resolution"" being ""virtual"" (i.e. an artifact due to upscaling+sharpening).

.. But then again, I could be wrong... Having bought the DVD version twice (also as a present), I'm NOT going to buy it again as BR! :)

What I did miss however - on both the 720p and this 1080p - was the sharpness of the high-res scenes as I remembered when seeing it at the theater...

(wow, I just realized that I've ""bought"" this movie 3 times... Darn!)"
