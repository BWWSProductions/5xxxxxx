Nude photos of Rihanna, have leaked.

Seven pictures show various body parts, including two close ups of Rihanna's face and a third photo of Rihanna head-to-knee reflected in a bathroom mirror with a message of "I love you" scrawled on it, reports Huffington Post.

All seven shots seem to be self taken in the same white bathroom and bedroom area. Rihanna's photos were reportedly taken in Hollywood where she was staying at a hotel with Chris Brown. Brown is also featured in a photo with pink panties on his head reports FitnessFit.

The four shots that do not include Rihanna's head in them include two of a bare bottom as seen reflected in a mirror, one of a dark lacquer-nailed hand squeezing a bottom and a photo of an undressed torso from a reflection in a mirror. One breast is pierced and pink Nike towel is flung over a shoulder hiding the other.
