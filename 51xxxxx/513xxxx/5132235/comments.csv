REQUIRES you to enable Javascript or to disable you Adblocking software just to VIEW the site. Useless. I am sorry, but if you cannot even view the site without having to ""pay"" (complete a trial of something, then gain access) then it's useless in my opinion. Seriously, I'd think they'd make more if they just put ads all over the site...

Spyware or adware

Engaged in the distribution of malware.

All i got when i visit the site is YOU MUST DISABLE ADBLOCK in huge letters and a warning sign, if memory serves me right when i actually got onto one of these sites they just throw survey after survey or questionaire after questionaire or marketing ploy after marketing ploy and it never seems to bloody end, it pisses you off that much that you have to give up at some point, i mean patience is a steady earned virtue with computers anyway and then you get this shit, na i AINT  buying it man, go back to ya cold calling so i can ignore ya that way instead. Anyway sorry peeps, it just pisses me off, but i'll add to my many paragraphs about quality of the torrent a little later folks lol, peace."

,Schwarzenbart,2010-04-01T09:05Z,"If Jean Reno shared veins with Steven Segal, Jean Reno would have had a cardiorespiratory shutdown. Segal is too fat and self-absorbed to entertain, and Luc Besson wouldn't touch him with a laser pointer."
