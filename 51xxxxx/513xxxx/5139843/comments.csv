,tauffen,2009-11-19T05:47Z,"Subs are all nordic.

And what this 3D means anyway? That's 3-Dimension?

I've played the movie and looks all the same to me..."
,crankyerma2,2009-11-21T04:08Z,It looks all the same because the poster is full of poop.
,Prosodie,2009-12-13T20:30Z,"There is no info at Imdb about ""Profondo Rosso 3D 2009"" but there is something about Profondo Rosso (1975) above:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073582/
Anyone can tell me the right information about this torrent please?
3D or not? If 3D, which colors used and need magenta green or cyan red glasses?
Thanks"
,mvfreak,2009-12-27T07:46Z,Is this the Director's cut (123 min)?
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-02-08T22:02Z,"everything stinks about this upload:
-Deep Red 2009 (in the title)(not 1975)

-3D (WTF)

-in the description says nothing about the torrent just a link of an other tracker.
(I always thought thepiratebay forbids advertising other trackers, well I was wrong.)

-In his comment he says multisub ( he is obviously too lazy to tell us which languages).

I'm not going to guess anything about this torrent, just stay away from it.

This must be the most superficial and confusing torrent upload on this tracker."
