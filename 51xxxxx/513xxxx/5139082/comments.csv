,yoseph125,2009-11-27T00:35Z,"Hello, do i need to mount anything?"
,brianxxx,2009-11-30T20:37Z,"Is this the RETAIL ""BOX"" version or the download version?"
,rowanator,2009-12-09T08:05Z,"do we have to burn or mount?
or is it just: extract, instal, play?"
,Roast_Zombies,2009-12-17T03:08Z,Can anyone confirm if online multiplayer works?

,elliotlolxz,2009-12-21T16:11Z,"Ok so I copied the cracked file over to the Borderlands folder (i didn't have to overwrite anything because there was no file that was named the same)

When I click Borderlands.exe (the cracked file) it tells me i'm missing wxmsw28u_core_vc_custom.dll

If i try to click Launcher.exe it tells me that no disc is inserted... 

Do i need to mount something with a virtual drive or what? please help!"

,HotDog999,2010-01-12T07:01Z,"I don't understand why nobody is helping anyone here! 
I also have a problem I have mounted the iso when I try to install I get an error 1721.
Now this is a problem with registry but I am highly doubting that because I have installed iso's just fine in the past! But I assume no one will help....
Quality +4/-5 huh no wonder!
LAZY ASS INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!"
,HotDog999,2010-01-12T07:05Z,NVM I got it.
,unrealx420,2010-01-12T20:10Z,"HotDog999, I am having this same problem. I just wanted to know your method on how you made it work. I tried some other things i found by searching the web. But when I try to launch borderlands.exe it asks for all these .dll files and the game will not start. Any help from somebody would be appreciated."
,HotDog999,2010-01-13T23:48Z,"Unrealx420 I tried alot of different things.
First if your getting the error message 1721 you might just be trying to install from the iso. That wont work. 
I got mine to work by just mounting it and then going into my computer and clicking the drive that said borderlands. ran it and it installed. 
Now if that dosn't work go into the ISO and install all of the .exe's and then try running it again from my computer blah blah blah! Hope that helps. "
,unrealx420,2010-01-13T23:55Z,"Fixed it, Works great. Found a fix for people who got into the game and has grey walls and buildings. Simply just rename your Borderlands.exe to Bishock.exe and oddly the problem is fixed. I got mine to work by mounting it its probably the best and only way. even tho at installation i still get the 1722 error there are 2 options to make this work. #1 you can shut off your computer as soon as you see the error pop up at the end of installation, it will still be installed. #2 you can copy/paste the existing filesd the installer just installed for borderlands and put them into a different place, then put them back after it rolls back. I prefer option #1 cause it takes a while to move 6gb of shit. GOOD LUCK!!"
,bookimam,2010-01-16T18:48Z,nice tor.thanku all.seed plz

Please insert the original ""Borderlands"" CD/DVD.
Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=wrongdisc for further, more detailed information.

is the error I get when i use the normal Borderlands launcher.

""Program cant start because wxmsw28u_core_vc_custom.dll doesnt exist.""
is the error i get when i use the cracked launcher instead. Please help :)"
,MitcheII,2010-01-22T01:58Z,"Why the fuck does anyone put a torrent up and give half assed instructions and not help anyone? I haven't been able to get around the securom wrong disc shit, other people obviously haven't either. Seriously, it would take like 5 minutes to post an answer. First step is install the game, but you can't even get beyond that due to securom. Post a solution for fuck's sake."

,NeroAkira,2011-03-19T15:44Z,"First of all I say, it might be a jackass thing to do but they go through the trouble of cracking and uploading for your pleasure so in my mind they don't have to add instructions its just nice that they do(Thank you for that). 

Secondly, if you don't know how then don't do it you retards.

Thank you, best wishes

,shredder777,2011-05-19T06:07Z,How the hell dou you install dlcs on this?
,NeroAkira,2011-05-30T14:50Z,"I, personaly don't need instructions, but sometimes i do if im really drunk when i start installing a game"
,roflhotcakes,2011-09-18T23:53Z,"Ok, installation instructions for the noobs:
1. Mount the iso with image mounting software. I use Daemon Tools Lite.
2. Run image like you would a disc in your CD/DVD drive.
3. Run installation, accept license agreement, blah blah blah.
4. When you get to online release date check, let it. Chances are, it'll fail, so look for installtion files in Program Files (x86) or Program Files. Copy and paste somewhere else. Cancel the release date check, and the original install files will disappear.
5. Paste the install files you copied back where they should be.
6. Locate Borderlands.exe in the crack folder (somewhere close to the .iso image file) and copy it. You'll find a very similar file in the Binaries folder of your installation files. Overwrite it with the crack file, and run it. You should be good to go :)

If you really enjoyed the game, go out and buy it. More funding for Borderlands 2 :)"
