[V],thethingy,2009-10-27T07:11Z,"noellife2000, read the description;

VISTA IS ""OLD"" NOW BUT IF YOU HAVE XP & WANT TO UPGRADE TO 
WINDOWS 7 AND KEEP YOUR PROGRAMES,FILES AND SETTINGS THEN
YOU NEED TO UPGRADE TO VISTA FIRST THEN TO WINDOWS 7.

IF YOU DO THIS YOU DO NOT NEED TO ACTIVATE VISTA BEFORE 
UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 7.




CHECK OTHER TORRENT FOR WINDOWS 7 & ACTIVATOR."
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-06T00:25Z,"Hey guys.

So, my computer was full of viruses, so i had to format it. Before I formated it, with Magic ISO I extracted the files and then burned them into a DVD-R. Then, I formated my computer and then when I was about to install this Windows Vista, it keeps delivering this message: ""Non-system disk or disk error. Replace and strike any key when ready"". How comes it doesn't recognize? What did I do wrong?"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-06T00:56Z,"you extracted the files then burned a dvd,,, burn the iso not the files to a dvd to make it bootable,, there is a iso burner in this;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5140603/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_7_EXTRA_PACK

once you have burned the iso you will have a clone of it that will boot."
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-06T02:50Z,hey thethingy thanks for the help... but didn't you give me the wrong link? that has something to do with windows 7
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-06T03:16Z,"thethingy, i just burned the dvd not extracting the files, but burning directly the .iso file with the software ""Active ISO Burner"". You think it will work? Thanks in advance."
[V],thethingy,2009-11-06T12:13Z,"yeh itll work, burn it at a slow speed like 8x"
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-07T01:20Z,"hey thethingy... so I finally managed to install this version of windows vista... but now, i still have two doubts... first... when i open the ""welcome center"", when i got to the separator that says ""windows activion"", it says there the product ID but then it says ""30 day(s) to activate. Active Windows now"".. does that means that the Windows is still not activated? After I installed windows vista, i ran the file activator.exe, but it still says ""30 day(s) to activate. Active Windows now"". is that a problem? Second thing... Before I formated the computer, the colors use to be more bright and stuff, and the image itself used to be wider (now it wont even strecht all the way.. i mean, it doesnt fill all the ""space"" on the monitor... there are two black bars on the side... if u know what i mean, i dont know if im making my point understandable...). what is wrong? did i download the wrong file? should i have downloaded the x64 version? hey man, sorry for bothering u again.. hope u can help me here... thanks in advance"
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-07T01:54Z,"by the way, my processor is a intel pentium dual cpu t2390... i dont know if this information will be useful... now, for this processor i need the x64 windows vista sp2 version? or is there any drivers i can install so that the resolution gets better? thanks"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-07T02:52Z,"run the activator as admin then press the activate for whatever brand youve got and wait till a window pops up telling you the slic info has been added,, takes about 2 to 3 min then restart,, adjust the screen by using graphics properties till it fills the screen,,, 64bit chips work with 32bit windows but 64bit vista is here;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5146376/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_VISTA_SP2_X64__amp__ACTIVATOR"
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-07T03:20Z,"ok... the image is now ok, the problem was that i didnt update my video drives.. stupid me. now... i already ran the activator.exe as administrator, for my brand (HP) and restarted my computer. but when i go to my computer's properties, in the separator ""windows activation"", it says ""30 day(s) to activate windows. active windows now."" and then says ""product key: 89572-OEM-7332166-00026"". is my windows activated, even though it still says ""30 day(s) to activate windows. active windows now"" after i ran the activator as administrator and restart the pc? man, really, thanks for the help, and im really sorry for all the questions. thanks"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-07T04:16Z,"no its not activated,,, run the activator as admin,, select the brand,, wait for oem info installed to appear,, wait for slic installed to appear,, close the activator it will tell you to restart for changes to take effect,, restart and it will say windows is activated when you righ click computer and select properties,, it will display a blue box that says ""ask for genuine microsoft software"" at the bottom right of the window."
[V],thethingy,2009-11-07T04:42Z,"forgot to say,, there will be 3 windows that pop up,,,1 oem installed ,,2 key installed,,3 slic installed,, wait for all 3 to come and go then close the activator and do the restart. "
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-07T04:54Z,"thethingy, it says ""OEM Logo's, Information and VistaLoader installed successfully. Please restart your pc!"". It says this everytime, but it never seems to activate my windows"
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-07T04:59Z,"okay now.. i ran the activator, but it only shows ""OEM Logo's, Information and VistaLoader installed successfully. Please restart your pc!"". the other two i waited for like 10 minutes and nothing. can it be because it already did some windows updates?"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-07T05:11Z,"dont think so, this works 100% on all vista editions,, try doing the activate with no oem."
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-07T05:15Z,still nothing.... just installs the first thing.. nothing of the rest
[V],thethingy,2009-11-07T05:21Z,"mayby if you have downloaded the windows genuine advantage update before applying the activator it doesent then work,, check your updates,, i used it straight after installing vista on sevral pc's and have never had any problems."
[V],thethingy,2009-11-08T02:59Z,also try it with user account control off. checked it on a vm vista business on hp today and it activates
,PedroFSGS,2009-11-09T16:00Z,"man, its finally working. thanks so much for your help."
,haCkSs,2009-11-14T16:10Z, thethingy i've got a question do i burn only the image file or everything in the file thanks in advance
[V],thethingy,2009-11-14T17:43Z,"burn just the image file, or if your upgraing from xp just mount the iso with majic disc or power iso to upgrade, there is a tool in this;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5159797

to put the files on a usb so you dont need to burn a disc or mount the iso."
[V],thethingy,2009-11-14T18:02Z,ITS THE LATEST.
,haCkSs,2009-11-15T14:18Z,One more question after the vista install do i run the    activator..? thanks..!
,haCkSs,2009-11-16T10:23Z,Hi guys im a first to all of this can someone explane the proses to me please if u could I'd really appreciate it.Thanks
,forellana,2010-01-08T13:02Z,"to anyone who manage to make it work please tell me how you did it.
For some reason the activator does not work and after i install,the recovery option shows up. "
[V],thethingy,2010-01-09T20:00Z,"just install vista then run the activator as administrator, select activate, wait for the prompt to restart, restart and youre done"
,hes2smart,2010-01-16T14:08Z,"@thethingy 

Thanks for the upload. I personally like vista and windows 7. Vista SP2 is not that bad, it performs on my desktop as good as Win 7. I still don't have all my software compatible with Win 7, so Vista lives for some time. Thx.
hes2smart"
,lashag35,2010-01-19T15:57Z,"Just Installed this copy of Vista, and it works great, no problems, just follow instructions given by ""thethingy""

Thank you very much ""thethingy""."
,mo654,2010-01-19T18:18Z,"if i burn this iso, will it be bootable?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-19T18:47Z,yes
,NickleDyme,2010-01-24T05:52Z,Can u get updates and service packs with this or is that not advisable?
[V],thethingy,2010-01-24T06:01Z,yes u can
,NickleDyme,2010-01-25T02:42Z,"Awesome!!
Do I burn the activator and OEM editor to the dvd or will it run from my laptop.I have power iso and have never used it to burn anything to a disc before.I was wondering if u have some quick instructions for that.I've never installed a new OS before but not worried.Just wanna get the everything straight before I do this.Thanks so much by the way.My wife is more anxious about it than I'am so if it makes her happy I'm all for it."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T03:27Z,"just burn the vista iso to a dvd at the slowest possable speed, or if your upgrading from xp just mount the vista iso with power iso to install, run the activator from the desktop of vista when installed, dont enter a product key when installing and its ok to let the installation check for updates during install."
,NickleDyme,2010-01-25T03:35Z,I have XP Pro and my wife has XP Home Basic.Do u think it would work if I upgraded with the serials I have in my system for XP?If not I'll just run the activator.I just burned the bootable to a dvd at my slowest speed.I tried it and it works but I need to clear out my files before install just to be safe.I'll be sure to move those files to my desktop before I install.Everything is in an external drive right now.
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T03:46Z,"you can keep all of your files and apps just boot from the dvd and select upgrade, your xp serials wont work you have to use the activator, if you do do an upgrade and it fails booting from the dvd then you need to start xp and run the upgrade from within xp and you will then be told what xp updates need to be removed to do the upgrade."
,NickleDyme,2010-01-25T03:58Z,I can uninstall the updates and service packs from the control panel if I remember right.If not I'm not sure how to do it but running it from within XP?Do u mean with a virtual drive?Like I said I've never done this before and don't have money to fix things if I mess it up too bad.I have most of my stuff backed up externally.Would only need to move a few things unlike my wife lol
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T04:14Z,"start xp, let it settle down, put the vista dvd in and it should autostart and show you the vista installation window whare u can select upgrade, dont worry about your files if anything goes wrong short of a power cut then the installation automatically rolls back to xp.,, start uour upgrade and vista will check what if anything needs to be removed and it will if needs be show u a report, 9 times out of 10 it will just work."
,NickleDyme,2010-01-25T04:38Z,"I have a very small drive on my laptop so moving as much as possible probably won't hurt.I only got 20 gigs but have 250 externally.20 gigs is the minimum according to the vista advisor I ran before deciding to try vista.This is a worst case scenerio but if my system won't run vista properly,how could I roll back.I'm on a Dell Latitude D500 if that's any help.Thanks for all the tips by the way...I'll be going by everything u said to the last letter.I woulda gone for windows 7 but my system has no chance with it."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-25T05:11Z,"the vista advisor would tell you NO CHANCE, but your good to go, vista needs about 6gb the rest is 4 apps and stuff, when you have upgraded if you want win7 dont run the activator, download the win7 dvd from the description above and upgrade vista to 7, you cant upgrade xp to 7, your pc can handle vista so it will be even hapier with 7, same procedure upgrading vista to 7 except you dont need to burn the dvd just right click the 7 iso and select power iso then mount, go to my computer and 7 will appear as a dvd drive go into it just as a normal cd and click on setup to upgrade.,, if you do this with your limited space turn of system restore to get rid of all the backups, go to my computer and right click c and select disk clean up, download ccleaner and select all of the options in ""clean"" and ""registry"" and run both, if u do all of that b4 upgrading youll free up loads of space."
,NickleDyme,2010-01-25T05:41Z,"Windows 7 advisor pretty much told me no chance with my weak video card,low memory and not enough RAM.I have plenty of space so before I get around to 7 I think I need a new laptop.Gonna give this one away to somebody who needs it when I get ready.U have some sweet torrent up that my wife wants bad.She's all about photoshop so that might be next after this deal's done.Thanks alot tho....makes my cpu life alot easier!"
,NickleDyme,2010-01-30T03:51Z,Works with my wife's pc but my laptop won't activate no matter which way I do things.I need some major help getting this thing done with.
,NickleDyme,2010-01-30T03:58Z,I installed home basic first and ran the activator as admin.That didn't work so I spent 3 days trying every crack inaginable.So I ran the disc again and installed home basic again.This time I did a format and tried activation thru the OEM and logo option.That didn't work either...I've once again reformatted my whole drive and installed Home Premium.I ran the OEM and Logo thing again.Still no luck....is this an issue with my bio version??Sorry bout blowin up the comments I'm seriously stumped but my wife's is perfect.
[V],thethingy,2010-01-30T07:19Z,"try running as admin, if no luck try installing as admin with no oem info, if it still fails google  VOATK Tools (download it), turn off user accoun control, restart and run  VOATK Tools (as admin) and remove all vista cracks, restart run it again and use it to change the vista edition to oem, restart and then run the activator again."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-30T07:26Z,VOATK Tools lets you reset the 30 day trial 3  times (120 days) so dont worrk about running out of time.
,NickleDyme,2010-01-31T23:09Z,"Yeah I tried that and did all u said but still wasn't working.I tried every hack,activator and then some.I spent the last 4 or 5 days trying to find something and reinstalling over and over.I finally got activated like 5 minutes ago.There's an activator from Bad Religion.Seems I missed the one tool that finally did it.Too bad u guys couldn't combine torrents somehow.I really owe it to both of u guys.Awesome Torrents and the support u gave was very helpful.I tried seeding but my system only seeds for awhile and quits.Don't understand it lol"
,SilentAvenger,2010-03-06T07:14Z,plz seed all
,jandejoop,2010-03-21T18:32Z,"I didn't use your vista because I already had an SP2 on an other pc, but the activator works really fine. Two clicks and a reboot. Thanks"

,scream000,2010-04-04T13:30Z,What version is this? and is it a full install?

I need help, Im downloading your torrent now, but Im a noob in this xD

Right now I have windows 7, but I have some problems with it, some problem related to the kernel-power, a common problem with W7 as I have read in many forums

I want to install vista, but I have NEVER install an OS before...

what do I need to do ?? (keeping in mind that my PC is still running W7)

what I have catch until now:

-I have to burn all 3 files (or just one?) of the torrent to a DVD right ?? what program do you recommend me for that ?? and at what speed??

-Then I should boot my PC from the DVD right ?? but how can I do that ?? its an option in the BIOS???

-Then I just let Vista Install...and when its ready I must run the activator as admin and thats all ???

or Im missing something ?? 

thats the best way to install vista considering Im still using W7 ??

and what about the drivers ?? this version comes with all the common drivers or I need to download them ??

please help xD

thanks for your time"

,Rainmanscloud,2010-12-23T06:25Z,so i think i figured out why you don't for this torrent anyway and is because it's a bad iso checksum does not match downloaded it twice to make sure but the x64 one is good    odd
[V],thethingy,2011-01-02T16:44Z,"Rainmanscloud & others, there is a small config file that determine what edition to install, this torrent has it removed to allow you to install any edition from the 1 iso that's why the hash don't match, the 64bit one also has the file removed so that's not an official ms hash either, this is clean and functional, I could of uploaded like 10 different Vista torrents but what's the point when they all can install all editions, and I don't really bother with this torrent as its a year old and is on pg 15 of my posts that's all.
