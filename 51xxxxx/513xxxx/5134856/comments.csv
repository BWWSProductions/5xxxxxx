,the_devious,2009-11-02T11:15Z,"Hi Jonny... Great up; much appreciated. Just a quick question. I thought such a high video bitrate can't really be justified for enhanced-for-hi-def movies (i.e. not originally filmed in HD). Wouldn't a DVD5 video size have been sufficient? Not complaining or anything, just wondering ;-)
Cheers."
,camj,2009-12-11T00:40Z,most films are actually have much larger resolutions for cinema screening purposes and are often downgraded for dvd/blu-ray.
,thedarkfilth,2010-03-11T03:44Z,@the_devious wat @camj said! lol i only know that because im in a film class which is requiring me to download this to watch and be quizzed on :P
