,Prospector99,2009-10-23T02:16Z,"I am around 90% complete on a different torrent. I have watched some parts of it and it is perfect.  I am curious as to what will be different in the Repack ?   

Thanks"
,teabag87,2009-10-23T02:19Z,"im with prospector, im 29% done on the other release which is said to be bad because its a ""french title"".... but its fine..."
,Blue_Flames,2009-10-23T02:44Z,"Yeah, French titles/credits is the only reason for the repack."

,2015guy,2009-10-23T20:59Z,"one of pixar's best.  this is the first movie i brought my 2 year old to see.. he sat for the whole thing.. we ended up seeing it again!

You're going to make him very happy once it's downloaded..  

This film is on my ""Buy on release day, but dammit, i can't wait"" list."
,justin131,2009-10-23T21:28Z,"Ugh. Thanks for the repack, just wish I would have seen it before I was finished downloading and seeding.

Unfortunately, I am OCD enough to redownload and reseed it just to avoid the french lol."
,maxxdl,2009-10-24T04:15Z,"when is 3d version coming?
ty"
,king_pirate,2009-10-24T08:59Z,"Been waiting for this movie to show up on here for a while now, knew it would eventually thanx.

Oh and just to be clear this is not the french title right? That's the only difference between this and the others?"
,mrmajorna,2009-10-24T10:21Z,What is REPACK version ?
,novopolia,2009-10-24T13:02Z,The quality of this release is stunning!
,1MSCD2J,2009-10-24T15:08Z,"@ king_pirate & mrmajorna

The title and credits were French in the original torrent, this repack has it in English."
,caliwillbemine,2009-10-24T18:30Z,"any chances of a stereoscopic release ?
pirate bay should make a 3D section since tvs are now 3D ready"
,christian350z_dude,2009-10-25T08:46Z,"been waiting for this, thanks alot!"
,boring123,2009-10-29T14:54Z,Is there a way to get rid of the subtitles?
,gino24-8,2009-10-29T18:16Z,"I need help friends... I use GOM player for this mkv file but i can 't hear nothing from this movie...
However the visual part seems to be working great.Also, it is definitelly sure that i worked .mkv with that program in presedent times without any obstacle.  Any help would be appreciated...."
[V],-jonny-,2009-10-29T18:32Z,this is one of pixar's weaker offerings. certainly not their best yet.
,boring123,2009-10-30T02:36Z,I'm on a Mac and this was the first movie I can remember that didn't play right on Front Row. I tried using VLC instead and it worked fine. Don't want any Mac people to give up on the file too soon.
,KOHb,2009-11-07T13:16Z,Thanks
