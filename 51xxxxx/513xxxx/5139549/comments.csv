,Black-beered,2009-11-20T07:33Z,"So have anyone used this yet - any successful installations? When running the bundle-/setup-script which is supposed to extract the installation files, it reports ""magic number does not match"".

The file consists of a bash scripts and an attached binary part which is calculated in terms of offset etc. This obviously fails. I am running Debian Lenny btw, and have been well acquainted with Linux since 1992. Maybe I'll look into the script a little better, but I must admit I got a bit sceptical with this error popping up."
