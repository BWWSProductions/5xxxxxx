,berniethedog,2009-10-28T00:25Z,"Here's what someone said on IMDB:
Although the whole thing was filmed on a low budget, I'd say they made the best of what little budget they had. On a par with early 70's sci-fi movies with similar special effects and sounds etc. I really nice rendering of the ship with a lot of detail though.

Acting could have done with a little more ""feel"" since a lot of dialogue sounded as if it was being recited parrot fashion. Only Aaron Ginn-Forsberg actually felt as though he was 'being' the part rather than just playing it, both in acting and dialogue. The rest of the cast sounded flat and emotionless."
