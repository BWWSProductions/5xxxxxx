This week we had on Steve Pain and Famous B. Steve pain has been a winner at the last two CMLL Dragomania Events in Mexico City. Famous B was involved in this year's XPW X reunion show and both train out of Santino Bros. Training Camp in California. Apparently Pro Wrestling training partners don't necessarily get along with each other the way that MMA fighters do as these two went at each other hardcore! Sensei was blacked out, Violence Jack stirred the pot and dug out information and the callers called in and pissed everyone off as usual!
