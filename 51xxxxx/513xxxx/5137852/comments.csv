GameStop has released the much awaited DJ Hero.  This is great but there is only 1 small problem, no one is selling the turntable by itself!  I was hoping that you could purchase the turntable alone but for now that doesn?t seem like it will happen anytime soon.  That alone kind of makes this a pointless release but here it is anyways."
