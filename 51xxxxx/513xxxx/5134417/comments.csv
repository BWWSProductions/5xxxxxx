There are a lot of rumors going around this is the last show of the episode and that it has been canceled. Does anyone know if this is true?

I can't believe they would cancel this show, has anyone seen ABC's line up? This and Lost are the only 2 good shows they have. What a bunch of bastards."
,Prince_Bytore,2009-10-24T17:41Z,Thanks err0001. Great show. So sad that it was canceled. 
,Goblin77,2009-10-24T18:23Z,"Thanks for uploading this episode and the last few err0001. Appreciated dude.

On October 22, 2009, TV Squad reported that the sets for Defying Gravity had been destroyed and that the series had been canceled earlier this fall."
,dedutch,2009-10-24T21:22Z,"thanks for uploading the remaining episodes err0001!

i think everybody appreciates it very much!"
,Evanshm,2009-10-24T22:16Z,"Very good ep, both a/v and artistic quality. I don't suppose you could shine a light into an alternate reality future and bring us some more seasons of this unfairly doomed series."
,valoteagan,2009-10-25T02:22Z,"yeh cheers man
just a shame there will be no more"
,Bombardem,2009-10-25T21:07Z,I am very very sad to see this series disappear. It makes no sense to cancel this. Once the sets were built for the first season their costs were almost nothing for the remainder of the run. They could have really explored and explained the intricacies of space travel from a real perspective as limited by todays technological knowledge.
,iketheclerk,2009-10-29T03:35Z,"probably going to be replaced by some drivel clone of american idol or dancing with the stars. Gah..what a waste, this show was pretty decent."
,max11max,2009-10-31T08:13Z,This has just started on the BBC and I dont think they would have purchased the show if it was going to end mid season.
,Jonesing,2010-01-25T05:29Z,"It was a long way short of perfect but I'm such a sucker for sci-fi that I wanted it to go the distance. How about a book or three to wrap up the story, I'd buy it."
