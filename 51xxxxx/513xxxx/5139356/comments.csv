1. you have to download Daemon tools, right click on it's taskbar icon and mount the .iso
2. double click on it in 'My Computer'
3. Run the install to wherever
4. find the bin folder and run 'Resurrection update'
5. once complete, Click the resurrection application and you're done :D
Thanks  AiTB :P"
,DreadPoet,2010-05-14T23:45Z,I've done the update and now it says something about the direct3d rendering device and that i need to reinstall DirectX or update my drivers which are all current. So what's next?
,m4of7,2011-04-07T11:34Z,does it work or not on windows 7?
,opaleg,2012-02-14T04:37Z,I guess there won't be the four seeders out of the 50 people connected. And this game can't be found anywhere else online? WTF?
