The Maiden Heist is a comedy film directed by Peter Hewitt. It had a tentative release date of May 29, 2009 before being shelved following the bankruptcy of its distributor, Yari Film Group. Iâ€™m gonna check this out soon, enjoy!

Their plan wasnâ€™t exactly a work of art. It was a stroke of genius. But now the perfect crime is turning into a perfect disaster in this madcap comedy featuring Academy Award winners Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken, Marcia Gay Harden and Academy Award nominee William H. Macy. Charles, Roger and George are the very picture of honest security guards. But when they learn their favorite artworks are being sent to another museum, they concoct a plan to switch the real masterpieces with fakes. All goes well until a mistake forces these first-time thieves into a last-minute escapade in the comedy caper that proves youâ€™re never too old to have some new fun.
