Luckily, they're not suing people anymore, but enough of these notices can get my ISP to drop me... I switched to Usenet and I suggest everyone reading this either do the same or use a VPN."
,duel0007,2010-09-30T17:12Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD, This torrent is being tracked by BayTSP, a copyright enforcement company. I downloaded it on 9/13/2010 and got a notice about it today. They aren't suing anymore, but too many notices and your isp will drop you/internet access will be suspended if you're at a university like me."
