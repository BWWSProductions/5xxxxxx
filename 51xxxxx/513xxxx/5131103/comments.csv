only prob is I can't burn in IOS format, its in quicktime format. its great quality to watch on your puter. or burn in a DVD format but I don't have the time to Encode it. IOS is the way to go."
,j34ngr4y,2009-10-31T18:49Z,Is the version with the alt ending? Cause I'm dying to see it!!!!
,thewill4u,2009-11-03T06:37Z,iso u mean
,PUFFnKILLERBUDZ,2009-11-09T10:09Z,"i agree that an ISO would have been better, but u take what u get. oh, and i had some problems about 20 secs into the video, due to the file format being in quicktime. lucku for me i had magic converter and was able to change it to an xvid file and vlc worked perfectly. good upload."

I downloaded this one very fast, compared to the others, and the quality of this one is very good. This torrent is worth downloading! :D "

This is where bullshit ends and true horror begins. After watching this one yesterday I believe that this one ranks up in my personal favorites of all time in the horror / thriller genre. Its original, great acting and just when you think you have all figured out, you really dont.
Thanks for the up. 
Great, great movie"

But whatever you do STOP FUCKING WHINING.
