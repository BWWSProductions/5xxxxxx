plot

Every seven years in an unsuspecting town, The Tournament takes place. A battle royale among 30 of the worldâ€™s deadliest assassins. The last man standing receives the $10,000,000 cash prize and the title of World's No 1 (which itself carries the legendary million-dollar-a-bullet price tag). The Tournament is set up by a group of sick high-stake billionaires who watch the mayhem unfold via CCTV and bet on its outcome.[1] Each of the assassins carry a tracking device, embedded under their skin, allowing the observers to monitor the Tournaments movements and the assassins to track each other. When one removes his tracker and throws it into a coffee machine, a local priest (Robert Carlyle) who inadvertently swallows it is caught in the crossfire.
