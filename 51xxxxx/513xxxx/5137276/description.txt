During the prohibition era, gangsters grew rich on our nationâ€™s vices, and rivalries between criminal organizations resulted in open warfare and gangland murders. But unknown to the common man, a more sinister power controlled the crime cartels, using greed, gluttony, lust, and other sins to fuel a much more lucrative trade: mortal souls.

Three demon families fight for control soul-trafficking within the city, capitalizing on the rackets that lead unfortunates into their grasp. 

Offered a deal by one of the demon bosses Eddie, cursed to return from the dead and unable to rest, finds himself caught up in the middle of a sinister web of kidnapping, murder, and damnation.

Written by Cullen Bunn and illustrated by Brian Hurtt (Queen & Country).
