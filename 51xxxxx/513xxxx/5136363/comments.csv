What is with your comment on the Devo - Recombo DNA torrent??


""storoa - 2009-04-02 05:06 CET:

This torrent ""smells really bad"". I won't bother to download it because I know it will be fucked up. Check torrentguiden's other FLAC torrents before you waste your time and bandwidth on this shit. And torrentguiden, how does Suspira79's cock taste ? hahahahahahaha""

Are you 10 years old? Not enough attention from your parents? Please do not waste people's time with such weak-minded bollocks. If there is something wrong with a torrent, say so intelligently or say nothing at all."

EEE YARRRGGGG!!!!

I love this shit...

Oh, and thanks for the music too.  Properly named and sequenced.
