[T],tzanev,2009-10-26T09:37Z,I'm assuming everyone is ignoring that bobross idiot. EZTV posting a fake? Unthinkable!

,nyder,2009-10-26T16:58Z,"hey, eztv, mr. shit for brains.
your tracker isn't working, so quit being a fucking lazy bastard and add:


http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

to your torrent so everyone that downloads it doesn't have to.

fucking wanker "
,lxl3lindxl,2009-10-26T17:05Z,"One of the best shows ever, but this episode definitely lacks the humor to which the show is known for. "
,alves_com,2009-10-26T19:31Z,there are some network problems here

Add it yourself you f-king moron, if you knew how to use your Torrrent client you wouldnt be spoutin off like your only 2 brain cells collided and you had a thought...

Turn on DHT you fucking moron, I had absolutely zero problems connecting and DLing this torrent, you probably should not be allowed to DL it because your too fucking stooooopid to know what to do with it...

STFU..."
