Alternate install CD

The alternate install CD allows you to perform certain specialist installations of Xubuntu. It provides for the following situations:

    * setting up automated deployments;
    * upgrading from older installations without network access;
    * LVM and/or RAID partitioning;
    * installs on systems with less than about 192MB of RAM (although note that low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop environment reasonably). 

PC (Intel x86) alternate install CD

For almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors. Choose this if you are at all unsure.
