,Nugmonster,2009-10-28T03:30Z,"What is the problem?

And why all the foul language?"
,mikeee54,2009-11-03T20:23Z,"Ok, no one is telling you whats wrong,, the file is downloading  as an audio only file, there is not video,, I've tried it   twice"
,Nugmonster,2009-11-03T21:08Z,Works fine on my computer and both laptops? What player are you using? I use VLC cause I think WMP is crap.
,Nugmonster,2009-11-03T21:14Z,"Oh I think I know what is wrong, If you are using WMP you need to install the k-lite codec pack as I used FFDS for compression, I originally got this as some Russian file format that was an utter PIA to get ANY player to run properly so I used OJOsoft to reformat this and compress the file so the audio and video was in sync properly while still keeping the video definition. (main problem I had was audio when in Russian format)

So short answer: Use VLC to play or install k-lite codec pack into your Win. Media Player. Both are free."
