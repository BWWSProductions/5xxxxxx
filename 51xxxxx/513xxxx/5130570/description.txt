Looking back in history of mankind we understand that we do not see the true reasons of mankind madness, and on a threshold of the New Civilization each person should rethink all aspirations again. The life is not races behind meal, and we simply very much have got tired to resist each other and have not noticed that in a pursuit of illusions, we get involved in real wars them  for the sake of who we live. The mankind lives one day and does not think of the future but by intuition we understand senselessness of this day as well as all others in infinite war and slavery. Irritation and Indignation, Consent and Compromise, Dignity and Arrogance, Patriotism and Nazism, Thrift and Avarice. Russian Zeitgeist presents: Awakening of The Mind 2 Pairs.
