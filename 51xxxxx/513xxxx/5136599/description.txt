    [Howard Stern Show - Artie Roast]    [TIME: 1:17:39] [SIZE: 71.0MB]
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Artie Roast was one of the best Roasts on the Stern Show and it
    also caused lots of drunken commotion.  Howard decided to have the
    Roast at night so people could drink and have a good time.  Show is
    edited down to just the Roast.


    [Howard Stern Show - Drunken Mayhem] [TIME: 0:25:19] [SIZE: 23.1MB]
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you thought the Roast itself was full of energy and drunkeness
    then you have to hear the show going on in the hallway. The mayhem
    going on includes Richard and Sal spitting on eachother, making out,
    heads being shoved in toilets, Robin taking anal temperature, and
    lots of other craziness.


    [Wrap Up Show - Party Continues]     [TIME: 0:45:16] [SIZE: 41.4MB]
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    To push things even further the drunkeness continues and spills over
    into the Wrap Up Show.  This is one of the very few times where not
    only Artie stops by but also Howard, Robin, Fred, and Ralph are all 
    on the Wrap Up Show at the same time.  Then to top it off, all the 
    roastees pack into the studio including Bob Levy, Shuli, Yucko, Jim
    Florentine, Richard, Sal, Crackhead Bob, as well as Andrew Dice Clay
    calling in to get in on the action.  Don't forget Jon Hein and Gary
    Dell'Abate as the hosts. This is an hour of radio you shouldn't miss.
