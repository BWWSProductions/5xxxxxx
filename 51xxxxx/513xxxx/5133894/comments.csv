,sasi89,2009-11-26T08:54Z,"This flac files are game cd rips, these are only 22KHz. The original albums flac rips would be better. Anyway, thanks for the upload."
,sasi89,2009-11-26T09:24Z,"http://www.nfscheats.com/?p=12

It would be awesome to rip these versions to flac.
These original versions are 44.1KHz, more better quality than in this torrent."
,sasi89,2009-11-26T09:30Z,"NFS2: http://www.en.game-ost.ru/info.php?id=444
NFS3: http://www.en.game-ost.ru/info.php?id=445
NFS4: http://www.en.game-ost.ru/info.php?id=446"
,blitzlash,2009-11-26T16:01Z,"hey sasi89, is there any ""download link"" here http://www.en.game-ost.ru/albums/445/need_for_speed_iii_hot_pursuit_-_the_album/

 ??"
,naher2k8,2009-11-27T15:45Z,Have anybody Need For Speed - Hot Pursuit 2 soundtracks in lossless??????
,zonda01,2009-11-28T04:29Z,"sasi89 If I wanted to do that, I would have. You seem to have missed the point of my versions. Compare the lengths and content of my versions to the official album. That is what makes them unique. They are utterly complete."
,sasi89,2009-11-29T01:30Z,"But the quality of the tracks is much worse. I would appreciate that if you upload the original OST albums NFS 2, 4 in flac. I have The NFS 3 original album in flac. If you need it, i upload that, and i need the NFS2 and 4 orig albums flac version."
,zonda01,2009-11-29T09:03Z,"Look...

NFS II
Album Version: Pavlova (2:42)
My Version: Pavlova (4:16)

Album Version: Nashat (6:32)
My Version: Nashat (8:21)

NFS III
Album Version: hydrus 606	(3:44)
My Version: Hydrus 606 (4:58)

Album Version: Snow Bags	(6:26)
My Version: Snow Bags (8:07)

NFS IV
Admittedly, most in the album are longer, but they are simply remixed versions with repeated phrases. Plus the sheer number of missing songs in the actual album is a let-down.

If you don't like it, don't download. I spent a considerable amount of time hunting down the official album songs before taking matters into my own hands, and I am far convinced these are better. My goal was simply to evoke the underlying memories of those who had played these games through the music by using what was actually in the game and by using a particular format."
,sasi89,2009-11-29T17:11Z,"I know what are u thinking, and u are right, i know there is a lot of difference between game rip and game album tracks. I'm just only say, the game rip is only 22.5KHz, the official album CD's are 44.1KHz, so the quality is worse in the game rip."
,sasi89,2009-11-29T17:13Z,*much worse
,zonda01,2009-11-30T02:05Z,"Well, sasi89, can you upload yours so I can compare it to mine?"
,sasi89,2009-11-30T06:28Z,"Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit - The Album [1998][FLAC]:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5188187"
,sasi89,2009-11-30T06:55Z,"Need For Speed II - Excessive Speed! [1997][MP3/VBR/V2]: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5188214
Need For Speed IV: High Stakes - The Album [1999][MP3/VBR/V2]: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5188221

These are in MP3/VBR/V2, but 44.1KHz, it sounds better too than you verion."
,zonda01,2009-11-30T23:35Z,"Well, sasi89, they are good. Really good. I suppose I won't be able to conjure up the ultimate NFS II, III, and IV Soundtrack after all.

But I must ask. If it weren't for the quality setback, which versions would you prefer (from NFS II and III), the album or my versions?"
,sasi89,2009-12-01T10:43Z,"NFS2 --> nevermind
NFS3 --> i would prefer yours, cause my favourite track (Romolus 3, there is in NFS2SE too) is missing from the official album."
,amivoytec,2009-12-31T18:43Z,"Many, many thanks zonda01!"
,grovest2010,2010-10-02T14:09Z,"You took these tracks from games, if yes that what program?"
,grovest2010,2010-10-02T14:12Z,You took these tracks from games? if yes that what program?
