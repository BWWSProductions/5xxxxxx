***WARNING***

I just downloaded this and installed it, coppied the cracked .exe into the program files folder.

Opened the program.

Seconds later Microsoft Security Esentials pops up saying its found a Trojan!!!

I click remove. Sketchbook pro seems to be running fine no harm done. Did a quick scan and nothing found... doing a full scan now!"
,botok,2010-01-04T01:21Z,"read the readme.txt!!!
Works very nice, thx to 50c3nt!"
,Danman42,2010-02-20T16:28Z,Why do people always say Virus alert. Look the guy has got a Green Skull cause he is a VIP. Which means You can trust him. Anti- Virus's work with companys like Autodesk to prevent piracy also. Fair enough if they are not VIPS or Trusted.
,meddahmorphosis,2010-03-26T18:47Z,i cant figure out how to ionstall this thing 
,scoot9,2010-05-31T20:37Z,"50c3nt,  I'm not questioning your torrents but will you explain the virus.  I always scan my torrents using kaspersky and usually I get no viruses from VIP guys but this one showed up as a back door worm ??"
,scoot9,2010-05-31T20:46Z,"Well,, I even tryed to take a chance but Kaspersky deletes the .exe file before I can copy it to the program folder..   50c3nt, can you come up with another way to get this software to work?"
,scoot9,2010-05-31T21:12Z,"50c3nt,, I just wanted to tell you that I did try...  but Kaspersky deletes the .exe file within seconds.  No luck for me.. thanks for the torrent anyway"
,stansware,2010-06-19T22:26Z,"Hey mate, clam also finds a virus in the cracked .exe....
Ca you post a new crack? thx"
,cockn1pples,2010-07-31T02:06Z,"I installed and copied the crack, but when I launch it the program starts to load from the bottom up (slowly showing the interface) and not letting me click anything because when I do it says Not Responding. Any fix?"
,wherescare,2010-10-06T13:57Z,"I'm using 64bit windows 7. Works perfectly for me. Just follow the instructions on the readme. - Replace the file in the ""CURE"" folder with the one in the sketchbook pro folder..."
,Twisthem488,2010-11-11T00:24Z,"Downloaded real quick, and scanned just fine with NOD32. 

It installed and runs just fine in Win7 32bit, and I'm still scanning clean. Thanks for the up Colombo-bt

currently using a Gateway E295C convertible tablet. Oooh-rah."
,1nooodlse,2010-11-17T01:35Z,"To all those who commented it, this is not a trojan, or a worm, or a virus. It's just that many antivirus companies are payed to work against these kinds of cracks. In fact, I called geek squad, there is actually no way, at all, to add an exception with kaspersky antivirus. Sorry y'all. "
,Xtr2252,2011-03-22T07:26Z,"Don't listen to those tools who say it's not a trojan. It's main files are hidden in windows\installer, a folder that you can't even see if you have ""View hidden folders"" on, and the uninstall doesn't work. Had to use Perfect Uninstaller, go to x86, then click Autodesk SketchBookPro 2010, then uninstall and it should actually uninstall."
,wherescare,2011-03-30T18:29Z,"YES THERE IS A FUCKING TROJAN IN HERE!!!

My anti virus says:

Trojan horse Generic3_c.VMV

So download this at your own risk!

Danman42.  How can you be suck a fool to think that in the world of pirating a ""Green skull"" means shit? The guy who uploaded might not have even known about it. Even if autodesk was working with antivirus companies, this is listed as an ""msn virus"" - I highly doubt autodesk would use an ""msn virus"". It's bullshit. And fucking pisses me off that this fucker has even got a ""green skull"" that people think they can trust so much. WAKE UP PEOPLE, this is the piratebay!!!"
,wherescare,2011-03-30T18:36Z,"Twisthem488: 

NOD32 is shit! I used it for a year, the genuine copy. And it still failed to detect a lot of virus'. My computer started running really slowly, so had to reinstall windows in the end. I put all my files including my downloaded files onto my external hardrive, which I then plugged into my dads computer. Low and behold, his free AVG Anti-Virus found something like 7 or 8 infections, that NOD32 missed. Thank fuck I plugged it into his computer, else I would have just put all the same stuff back on the computer after reinstalling, and the same thing would have ended up happening! "
