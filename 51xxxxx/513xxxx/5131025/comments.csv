,Arse_Done_69,2010-12-06T04:27Z,Awesome this is the perfect song to use for a movie that i am making. QUICK FACT: if you play this song in reverse that it is the beatles song Because. just wanted to let you know that.
,alicedowntherabbithole,2011-03-22T18:19Z,Thank you!Thank you!
,Mr_Duck,2011-03-31T22:47Z,"QUICK FACT: Arse_Done_69 is actually incorrect. Moonlight Sonata's chords played backwards make up the chords of Because, but the notes in between are not the same. Lennon got his inspiration from Yoko playing it backwards on piano."
,rob_tassie,2011-09-12T12:21Z,"Regardless of where it came from, for my money, this is the ultimate piece of 'visual music'! Close you're eyes and you can just see the moon at night through broken cloud.  Just superb!"
,randomstranger99,2011-12-31T12:55Z,"The quality, despite the high bitrate, is low -- perhaps equivalent to 128k. There's a hiss throughout. I can only assume that this file was transcoded from a low-quality MP3 to a high-filesize WAV. Don't bother with this one."
