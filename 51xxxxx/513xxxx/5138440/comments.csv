,Mark_X,2009-10-28T17:33Z,it looks like diablo 3..nice
,fogzz11,2009-10-29T04:39Z,"This game is freakin amazing! Reminds me of Diablo so much, I feel bad for not buying it."
,hikki_man,2009-10-29T11:48Z,"The ingame interface is so complicated my head exploded! Then again, this is my first time playing an RPG. I wonder if there is a tutorial somewhere... Anyway, game looks good and works flawlessly. Thanks TPTB. May you grow ever more powerful."
,max1678,2009-10-29T18:31Z,"hey tptb guys
thx for this nice game
but what about borderlands?
rip this please"
,playypro,2009-10-29T19:14Z,Thanks for this awesome game :)
,hikki_man,2009-10-29T21:05Z,"I change my mind, the interface is alright... it's just I couldn't figure it out without reading the help messages in my initial test of the game. 
@max1678: borderlands has already been ripped by KaOs, whose rips are also good. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5138056/Borderlands.FullRip-KaOs"
,BenZo6339,2009-10-30T02:28Z,How exactly do you get an invite from TPTB?  I was interested in checking out y'alls site.

,Bosskelso,2009-10-31T10:42Z,I did buy this game. Its a good game. i wanted it the same day it released so i had to buy it :D
,failmao,2009-11-01T12:13Z,Cant get this to work... :S i run the setup file and click the makeicon and try to run the game but it freezes :S what to do!?
,failmao,2009-11-01T12:18Z,oh nvm got it to work now! yay!
,cheese1988,2009-11-01T18:28Z,"could anyone tell me how I can get the respec potion mod released by runic to work with this torrent?

I cant get it to work, seeing as how the game isnt actually installed."
,R0LEM0DEL,2009-11-04T08:18Z,Plz Help I cant get this game to work. Downloaded it extremely fast had within 1 night. But I cant seem to get it to work. I follow instructions But when i run SetupTorchLight.exe it shows TPTB... Then shows a black screen (like all the TPTB torrents do) But then the black screen goes away immediately. if i try to run the game from icon it says ...Reinstalling the application may fix this problem. ??? Help plz
,failmao,2009-11-07T17:05Z,Where the fuck does this place my save files?! cant find em anywhere!!
,Phaedrus_x,2009-11-12T13:37Z,"I have the same problem as R0LEMODEL: after launching the Setup app, a screen appears with some goofy music, and then nothing happens. The only way to exit the app is to hit escape. The game itself won't launch because ""the configuration is wrong."" To those who have gotten this to work: what exactly are we doing wrong?"
,Masem,2009-11-13T00:45Z,"Yes, I having the same problem. I get the TPTB 4 Ever screen, but nothing happens, and it freezes at a black screen when I try and load the game. "
,Phaedrus_x,2009-11-13T04:21Z,"I guess that's it then: this download was a complete waste of time. I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose: the info file that came with the download wasn't even for this game. If they can't even get that right, I'm sure they screwed up the game as well."
[V],Subzero!,2009-11-16T23:11Z,"@Masem and the others...

on that screen you press the ESC key, to exit, those who are able to read on screen text, showing cleverness! ;)"
,Phaedrus_x,2009-11-17T15:17Z,"Subzero: Yeah, we already figured that out. Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that we still can't play the game. Do you have any advice that would help us, you know, actually run the game?"
,evilalan,2009-11-17T19:37Z,"This is a great game I did play the demo, And I am going to buy it when I get the money but I really want to play it now so TPB helps... even tho I feel bad about this I know I can't control myself, thank you for this torrent"
,evilalan,2009-11-17T20:44Z,"Didn't work at all, When I press the EXE file or the shortcut it just go black and then nothing... something is wrong with this so many people complaining... well what can I do? Just download another one it took me 18min so not a big deal"
,Phaedrus_x,2009-11-17T23:41Z,"Yeah, something got messed up in this version. It's strange, because I've downloaded TPTB torrents before, and they've always worked. Either someone is trying to pass off their own work under the group's name, or the group isn't good as I thought it was."
,PeaceMaker22,2010-01-13T16:18Z,"GreatTorrent WorksGREAT.
Yes it does work people. Follow the Install Notes
-Extract 7zip
-Run SetupTorchLight.exe (thelittlevideowithmusic)
-double click makeicon
should be a shortcut on desktop. exit the video and shortcut should work. I got this working in literally 1min. and 10min to download"
,simply33,2010-01-16T14:03Z,"the game runs fine
make sure to set the registration entries in the folder torchlight"
,Uder1710,2010-01-20T02:05Z,"I did it just like ""PeaceMaker22"" said but yet still I only get a balck screen when I try to run it!
I waited for about 30min. and still nothing happenes!
Help please!"
