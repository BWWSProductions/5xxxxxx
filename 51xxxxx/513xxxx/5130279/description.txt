After Hayley and Steve leave for their summer vacations, Francine looks forward for the time she will have alone with Stan. However, Roger is living in the attic fighting for all the attention he can get. This results in Francine taking her time to teach Roger to be self-sufficient, which finally makes him get a place to live. But Stan has a fear that he will bore Francine, believing she will leave him, so he comes up with a plan to get Roger back into the house. Meanwhile, Steve's camp doesn't go as planned when a prank doesn't quite have the effect it was supposed to give.
