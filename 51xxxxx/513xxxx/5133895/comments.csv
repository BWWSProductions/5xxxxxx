Glad that I could assist you with making the conservative message available! I used to do my own radio recordings...so I fully understand how much of a burden it can be to cover them all.

I am also a fan of TPB but as you already said, it has been a bit shaky lately so I'm glad you suggested Mininova. I couldn't even upload yesterdays GB on here because of its current issues. I'm sure they will get it back in working order but at least now I have an alternative to post to. I might start on Demonoid as well, assuming they come back soon.

Thanks for pointing people my way and thanks a lot of the Rush podcasts! He is always a good listen. See ya!"

Yeah Piratebays been way flaky lately...i've actually been downloading from mininova cuz it updates the latest stuff quickly....Demonoids my fav but its been almost 2 months since its been active if I'm not mistaken or at least it feels like it.
