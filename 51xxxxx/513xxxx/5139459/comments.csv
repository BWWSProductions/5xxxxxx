Is it? It's the .ru that worries me, though it may just be the servers..."
,SkierDude09,2009-10-29T04:59Z,Is this in English? or is it Russian?
,gusiskirby,2009-10-29T05:11Z,Who cares what language it's in. It's Left 4 Dead 2!
,Arg_the_pirate,2009-10-29T07:23Z,Confirmed. It's in freaking Russian.
,Arg_the_pirate,2009-10-29T07:24Z,"It IS real, though. No viruses."
,Arg_the_pirate,2009-10-29T07:25Z,"Wait...

There is an option for the English version of the install towards the end of the setup. See how that works..."

I wouldn't spend anymore time on it if you don't get it to work, the full game is just around the corner.
Sucks that didn't work though....yes, I tried the fix thing in the description."

,sleeptalker,2009-10-30T01:08Z,It worked without problems for me. First I started it and after the intro the game crashed. I noticed that I had steam running so I closed steam. Then it worked. And this was even before the fix mentioned above.
,teamsamson888,2009-10-30T02:40Z,"5th time reinstalling, this music is pure garbage coulda atleast put a mute button on this thing, anybody find a fix for the crash when loading any of the maps?"

,medjaii,2009-10-31T16:26Z,"it does work. just do the following
-install the demo and overwrite the fix files(install the sound pack if you wish)

-then change your system date to 29th oct 2009 and timezone to Moscow( you'll avoid ""no permission"" error)

-then download and install steam create a new steam account then shut down steam

-google for ""undead steam patch""  download and crack steam

-start steam and run the demo from ""left4dead2.exe""  

have fun
"
,Kevin481,2009-10-31T18:10Z,can somebody give me crack plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz i would appreciate that!
,sentinel245,2009-10-31T18:28Z,"Hey guys, i dont mean to troll, but the solution medjaii and 2beFine mentioned really works.

Set your calendar to 29 October, and the time zone to (GMT+03:00) Moscow, St.Petersburg etc.

Just install steam, let it update itself, then use Sasio's UndeadPatch.

http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=44153

I didn't even use the ""fix"" mentioned in the description. It runs even on my 5 year old pc :)

The russian audio is quite funny :P"

Thnx for sharing this."
,sarihaddu,2009-11-01T03:11Z,"Hi Guys, I got it working finally after 2 hours of banging my head..., i tried all things, but this is the way it works as said by other members..
1. Install l4d2 demo.
2. Change date to October 29, 2009, and TIME ZONE to Moscow, St. Petersberg, Volgograd.
3. Download and install steam and create a new account, let steam update and log out of it.
4. For some reason, I don't feel the undead crack supplied in demo is working properly, so go to http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=44153 and download UnDead666_SASiO_22092009.rar [73.26 KiB]
5. Unzip all the files into c:\Program Files\Steam folder, which is where the default installation of steam would be..
6. Double click on UnDead - Install & Launch.bat
7. Log back into steam.
8. Launch the game by click on RUN_L4D2.exe

This is the way it worked for me, provided I am a noob with the system.. Excuse me if the details are too long, i just wanted to help other piratebayers who badly want to play this game :), if it works, thank other people who made this work and kick some zombies ASS"
,Swedenp0rn,2009-11-01T20:44Z,When i load Singel player so just when i have load it so Come a msg : STEAM validation rejected. What i do to work ???

,dakine7t9,2009-11-03T11:48Z,Ok so after I've been trying to get this to work forever. I tried everthing I could find. What I think finally did it was reseting my timezone to moscow and changing the date to october 29th.
,kalle.fisk,2009-11-05T17:58Z,Just get steam and you can play it online.

,MackanZoor,2009-12-12T22:38Z,"Got it working in multiplayer on LAN, didn't play any though, just saw that we could connect to each other and move around and shoot. Slashed off some heads and tried falling off the building a few times.

One of us had steam installed (not updated to the latest version), I didn't have steam installed. Both are on Vista 64.

This is how we did it:

Installed the game, only thing we changed in the installer was that we selected ""English"". Haven't installed any fix or english sound package (voices seem to be english in-game, russian in cut scenes).

1) Everybody start the game with -console
Example: Make a shortcut that leads to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Left 4 Dead 2\RUN_L4D2.exe"" -console

2) The guy hosting: In the console, type ""sv_lan 1"", then ""net_start"" then type ""map "" and press TAB
to select a map. Press ENTER to start game.

3) The guys joining: In the console, type ""connect X"", where X is the ip number of the guy hosting.

These are my notes from Left 4 Dead 1, havent checked if they work in L4D2 but they probably do:

Tip: ""name Blabla"" will give you the nickname ""Blabla"".

If the game crashes for someone he can simply rejoin by writing ""connect X"" again, but the guy
hosting have to kick him first from the game by writing ""kick X"" in the console, where X is the
nickname of the guy that crashed. The compuer will play the role of the kicked player until he
joins again.

Select a map with ""vs"" to be able to play as both humans and zombies. Press ""m"" to change team.

So, as I've said, haven't checked that much but at least I know it's possible to connect to each other (why shouldnt it work since it did in left4dead1 and this is just the first game with some additions, same ""engine"" in the back so to speak). Good luck and have a good game!"
,MackanZoor,2009-12-12T22:45Z,"Whoops, meant to comment on ""Left 4 Dead 2 no-Steam.ru"", not the demo version.

My bad, oh well. :)"
