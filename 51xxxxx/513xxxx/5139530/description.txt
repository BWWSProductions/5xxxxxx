*Edit*

*This was only intended to give the player creation tools to my friends but others seem to be downloading it as well so i will write a content list and explanation of the torrent*


Players need only to read the "Player's Handbook" and use one of the Character sheets.

Player Handbook 2 Has more races and classes to choose from.

The extra Player creation folder has the 3 main class division books which are worth a look at if you want to customize your character more.

-Martial (Fighters, Rangers, Rogues, Warlords)
-Divine (Avengers, Clerics, Invokers, Paladins)
-Arcane (Bards, Sorcerers, Swordmages, Warlocks, Wizards)

This torrent is comprised of files from other 4th edition D&D torrents filled with "too much chaff not enough wheat". 

As well as dragon magazine articles from the older editions, they are useful tools, or they are great inspiration to DM's and characters alike (check out the family creation article to get an idea). 

I can post more in another torrent if requested on the comments, they would include things like.

-Unstable Arcana, 60 random unintended magic/potion effects.
-Dragon Psychoses Draconian Delusions and Dementia.
-Knights, rules for Honor and Chivalry in any D&D game. 
-Unique Prestige classes including the likes of the "Gnome giant killer" or the "Tainted" (unwilling prestige class that's my favorite when used fairly).
-Unique Items, Weapons, Armor, and Abilities with drawings.
-Unique cults, orders, and groups with all relevant information (size, gold, influence).

(apologies for the slow upload I'm being throttled by my isp)
