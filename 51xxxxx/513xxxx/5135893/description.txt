supported processing operations), video capture, AVI MPEG WMV video joiner, video 
compressor, media management, audio and video playback (including full playlist 
support), and much more! 

The converter features are easy to use, yet very powerful. Both audio and video 
formats can be converted. Supported audio converter operations include CD, MP3, 
WAV, WMA, OGG, MPEG-4, AIFF, M4A, AAC, AC3, FLAC, and ALAC to MP3, WMA, OGG, or 
WAV; audio CD burner from WAV, MP3, WMA, and OGG, WAV and MP3 Compression, and 
two-way video conversions among MPG (MPEG-1, MPEG-2), AVI, WMV, MOV, etc. 

MPEG converter options are available for VCD, SVCD, and DVD compliant output. 
The MPEG encoder and decoder features are both very fast and easy to use. 
The audio content of video files can also be extracted and saved to the WAV format.
The CD converter module provides a FreeDB auto-save feature, which enables track 
title, artist, and album information to be dynamically downloaded from the Internet 
CD Database and used when you want to convert audio CD tracks to WAV, MP3, WMA, or 
OGG. This feature is fully configurable to use as much or little of the information
desired in any preferred order. Of course, this feature can also be disabled for 
those who do not wish to be connected to the Internet while using the convert CD 
tracks feature. Blaze Media Pro also features the ability to convert AVI, MPEG, 
and WMV video formats to Flash. 

The full-featured audio editor's capabilities include many effects and operations 
with audio data, such as Amplify, Null Amplitude, Insert/Delete Silence, Insert 
Noise, Insert Pulse, Insert Sinus, Fade In/Out, Invert, Normalize, Reverse, Delay,
Flanger, Vibrato, Stretch, Mix. Mix from File, Paste from File, Paste from 
Clipboard, Copy to Clipboard, Delete Selection, Save Selection, Zoom, Convert, 
Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Crop, Filters (Band Pass, Low Pass, High Pass, Low 
Shelf, High Shelf), Input/Output Volume Control, Audio Information Read/Write, 
and much more. Furthermore, the audio editor can be used for audio file recording 
from any available source (such as cassette; record player; phone line; TV tuner 
audio; CD player; line-In; auxiliary; microphone; wave-out; and wave-out mix) as 
well. The audio recorder also provides a solution to convert MIDI to MP3, WMA, 
WAV, or OGG. Recording can be saved directly to all supported formats, including 
MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, and more.

Advanced Audio CD burner features support the ability to burn audio CDs from MP3, 
WMA, WAV, and OGG files as well as burn data CD containing any type of files 
desired. Powerful capabilities include very fast and efficient multi-threaded 
recording; highly compatible with most any IDE and SCSI drives on the market today;

supported and optimized internally; ASPI manager not required for NT/2000/XP/2003 
systems; full re-writeable disc support; superior data buffering; and much more. 

Blaze Media Pro also features a powerful data CD burner. The software allows you 
to burn data images on-the-fly; no need to create an image on the hard drive first.
Therefore, very little disk space is required to use the data CD burner. For data 
CDs, existing ISO images can be imported from other sources, and the software can 
also write ISO files for external use. Audio CD creation offers such options as 
caching data locally to prevent the possibility of errors on slower systems for 
maximum compatibility. Test-mode burn is also supported to verify success without 
having to risk a wasted disc. Audio CD track manipulation is very easy and 
intuitive as well. You can quickly and easily rearrange tracks, remove any 
unwanted tracks, erase CD-RW discs, add a complete path of files to the list 
at once, and more. 

Blaze Media Pro features a complete and powerful digital video editor as well for 
AVI, MPG (MPEG-1 and MPEG-2), WMV, and ASF formats. The video editor allows you 
toedit, delete frames, delete selection, add audio to video files or replace 
existing audio in video files, and trim any desired portion of your video and 
audio content. You can add movie editing effects and titles, make color 
adjustments, export frames or audio selections, crop the video, flip, mirror,
 rotate, resize, stamp, adjust audio volume, and much more. WAV, WMA, and MP3 
audio files can be inserted into the video or extracted from the video; and BMP, 
GIF, JPG, PCX, PNG, RAS, PPM, TGA, and TIF are the supported image formats that 
can be inserted or extracted. The software's video capture feature can even be 
used to record video from DVD, and save to AVI or WMV, which can then be edited 
also. 

Blaze Media Pro supports all popular multimedia formats for playback, including 
MPEG Layer-3 (MP3), MPEG Layer-2 (MP2), OGG Vorbis (OGG), Active Streaming Format 
(ASF), MPEG Video (MPG, MPEG, MPE), Windows Video (AVI), Windows Media Audio and

precise zoom adjustment. Playback speed and position control are also supported. 

The playlist editor gives you the ability to create your own symphony of favorite 
songs and videos for your listening and viewing pleasure. You can combine both 
audio and video files within the same playlist. Since Blaze Media Pro supports 
all popular formats, the creation of playlist(s) is limited only by your 
imagination.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

For visiting my account*:

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
