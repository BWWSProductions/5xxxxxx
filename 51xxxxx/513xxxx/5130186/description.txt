RE SEED Wow power seeding, not done this in a while. It's fun as long as you don't need the bandwidth for anything else that is ;)

I am not only moving house but moving country in Novemember so will be off the net for the longest time, March next year soonest, so got to keep this lot alive until then, so I am adding extra public seeds to the trackers so if the unthinkable happens and TPB and Demonoid both go down these torrents will live on.

I STRONGLY advise you all look at your current seeds and do the same, add the public tracker torrents you see on the Demonoid page or search for them but do it NOW or the RIAA and SOCAN and Hollywood will win the file share battle and control the internet.  Volume 7 of 12.

VOB (mpeg2) files
4:3 and 16:9 mixed screen ratio
320kbs Stereo.

Just in time for the party season.   Seed on good people and enjoy life.
