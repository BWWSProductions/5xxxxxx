Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) are experiencing strains in their
marriage after Kate's third child was stillborn. The loss is particularly hard on Kate, who is still
recovering from a drinking habit that cost her her job. While visiting the local orphanage, they
decide to adopt Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a nine-year-old Russian girl. While Kate and
John's daughter Max (Aryana Engineer), who is deaf and communicates with sign language,
embraces Esther almost immediately, their son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) is somewhat less
welcoming.
Kate grows suspicious when Esther, who watched Kate and John have sex, expresses far
more knowledge of sex and its slang than would be expected for a child her age. Not long
after Esther arrives, she pushes a schoolmate who had picked on her off a playground slide,
breaking her ankle. Max saw Esther shove the girl, but covers for Esther by saying that the
girl slipped.
