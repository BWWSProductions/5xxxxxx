[T],Sunblock.,2009-10-25T15:00Z,The is a rumour that xbox 360 store info on console and when you get online again it sends the info to M$. So just by not playing online makes not safe way. Moding it .like this makes even more ban enable.
,totsuko,2009-10-25T15:07Z,"you can also patch wave 4 to wave 3 then repatch it with wave 3 to wave 2 using ppfomatic and proper patch files!!
it's working great on 1.5 firmware!

anyway tekken 6 is a huge letdown... quite amazing crappy graphics!! soul calibur 4 is quit old now but 1000 times better in every way!"

Patching Guide For WAVE4 Game to Wave3

We all know that the new 360 games are starting to circuit with a different structure, which includes the latest dashboard update.
All consoles are flashed with ixtreme and 1.6 ixtreme 1.51 and can not play these games will have to follow the following steps, is also recommended not to play in the live as there is a small risk.

What is needed?

ABGX30 Gui v1.0.1
PFI included in the pack
Video.iso included in the pack

We started ...

1 - Select the ISO
2 - autofix selected:

Level 3
Adjust angle 359 for ixtreme 1.4
Fix C / R data table is invalid
Adjunts angles that deviate more than 3 degrees from their CCRT

3-In Misc selected splitdvd our region and ""add it if it doesn't exist or isn't valid""

4-We keep as default for having this configuration, we proceeded to patch

5 - This step should always do with all the isos selected:

Even if steath passes _Patch
_Patch Even if these files are invalid
_Patch Video and select the video.iso
_Patch PFI and select the PFI.bin

6-We give the Launch button where patched the game and then re-analyze common without any patching

7 - We get a 100% WAV3 iso work on firmware 1.51 and 1.6 without having to re-flash
