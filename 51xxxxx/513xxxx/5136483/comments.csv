For many users, burning rom is all they ever need"

,darin_god,2009-12-11T11:47Z,"It needs plugins to do anything.

I can't burn any kind of file.
"
,_unul_,2009-12-19T17:38Z,Great app. Exactly what I wanted. A performant burning Software with no useless extra's.
,malevolent,2009-12-28T22:27Z,"Excellent!

Greatest torrent in smallest size :)"
[V],Slickinator,2009-12-29T21:42Z,you don't need anything extra just restart computer after installation and then set device in top scroller too your dvd burner it may auto set to image file just set too which you want and boom its all good
,brotherdav3,2010-01-07T15:25Z,Nero has already upped a  'pirate serial detection' bug in this torrent which kills it. DL at your own demise. Too bad because this was a bloat free torrent.
[V],Slickinator,2010-01-17T01:02Z,hmmm not sure but after it comes up with that little warning it cracks it so there has not been anything wrong with mine it automaticly fixes the prob on the way as it installs 
,paragon9,2010-02-06T23:23Z,"if your using vista AVOID this like the plague!!

Be sure to use your 'system restore' to recover your operating system."
[V],Slickinator,2010-02-07T04:04Z,why would you avoid this if i may ask? i have installed on windows 7 and other vista systems and never a problem?
,DuKeFX,2010-02-07T17:18Z,"Works perfectly on Windows 7, even after getting rid of that bugged Nero 9."
,paragon9,2010-02-08T01:49Z,"@slickinator

Yes of course, it was because after loading this software, my 'vista' operating system began to run at a virtual standstill, and then the screen blanked out.
I had to remove the laptop battery to turn it off because none of the buttons were responding when trying to shut it down.
Refitting the battery allowed me to go to 'system restore' to recover control of my operating system.
Hope that helps..........."
[V],Slickinator,2010-02-16T02:42Z,well sorry you had problems man hmmm not sure why like i said i used on vista and win7 and others and never a problem yet
,bridog80,2010-02-16T07:58Z,"Thanks for this dude! One question. Do you know if this will create a VCD for me, from an AVI file? Guess I'll find out. It finished downloading as I'm typing this, lol."
,scott_ehm,2010-02-19T20:52Z,Works good thanks.
,tintara1,2010-03-02T15:57Z,very nice thx / odli?no on win 7 ult
[V],Slickinator,2010-04-05T00:43Z,well it works perfect on windows 7 for me just remember when you see a warning message and it disappears during installation its all part of it and just allow the registry and crack and its done enjoy
,yazz00,2010-04-21T23:42Z,"Excellent, very simple and it works unlike that Nero 9 shit. Just what I needed. Thanks!"
,checkster,2010-07-16T12:31Z,exellent torrent! thx alot. Wth dont they make all programs like this. Its fully functional without all the bullcrap I usually disable/remove anyways. Works with both CD and DVDs and looks fully compatible with Windows 7 (x86). For those with problems installing - just click the [OK] button when running the registry hack.nn Slickinator - thx alot! great torrent
,suckbox554,2010-09-14T15:08Z,"I get this every time I reformat my PC. Works great every time, only one thing missing - The FLAC decoder to burn FLAC to audio CD without losing any sound quality that most burners use by compressing to MP3 during the burn process.
