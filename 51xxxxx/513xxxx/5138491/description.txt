Set in two contrasting environments that underline the same premise of imprisonment, Selda tells the story of Rommel (Sid Lucero), a young man who accidentally kills a boy, resulting in his incarceration. Inside the jail, he befriends another inmate, Esteban (Emilio), who becomes his rock and protector. Seven years later, Rommel is living in the province as a farmer together with Sita (Ara Mina) his wife. Esteban tracks down Rommel in hopes of renewing a brewing love affair. Rommel and Sita welcome Esteban into their lives, until their intimacy crosses borderlines and results in the undeniable scourge of self-discovery.

A film well worth watching. A psychological drama. A young guy gets sent to prison after an accident and encounters hell. The music is very well done with a piano and a sultry voice throughout. I'd give it a 6.5. The subs are in great shape now that 3 - 4000 typos have been fixed along with a little rephrasing. They are well timed.

The video is pretty good with a little pixelation. Audio is very good. say V=7, A=10
