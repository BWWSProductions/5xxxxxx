,Cadinot,2009-10-28T02:39Z,"Filipino indie film by Paolo Villaluna and Ellen Ramos.
Selda is a return to classiscist forms and delivers a stylish, deliberately-paced treatise on love. At moments strange, Selda is a sublime and disquieting portrait of a young man whose search for happiness, innocence and true love is laden with guilt and doubt.
True to form to their themes of love and its different vagaries, filmmakers Paolo Villaluna and Ellen Ramos follow up their highly-acclaimed debut film ILUSYON  with the tragic tale of 3 characters in Selda. The film stars Sid Lucero, Emilio Garcia and Ara Mina. Also starring are Michael de Mesa, Allan Paule, Soliman Cruz and Ping Medina.
