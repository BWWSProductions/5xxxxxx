NOTHING gets by it and it is not invasive at the same time!!



if any of you post up on here that its a trojan horse then you fucking suck.



and if any of you have problems with installation and etc please let me know.

TO ANYONE HAVING PROBLEMS
install the trial version, reboot, turn off the self protection, reboot, run the mara-fix, reboot and turn self protection back on.
