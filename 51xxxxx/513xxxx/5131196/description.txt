DVD Rip of Marcam Productions "Western Winter Wonderland" 704x480 ITU H.264 30 fps AC-3 Stereo 192 Kbps, 48000hz.

When moist Pacific Ocean air collides with cold mountain temperatures, it creates an opportunity to see mother nature in her finest white dress. Railroads traverse these mountains by way of scenic routes and steep grades. Put winter and railroads together, and the result is something special: mile long freight trains braving white flurries, passenger coaches on mountain excursions, and small operators battling the elements. This is a Western Winter Wonderland.
