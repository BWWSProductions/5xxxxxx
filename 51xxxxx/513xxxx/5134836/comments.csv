,Gangstargun,2009-12-06T02:12Z,Worked perfectly dowloading again cause i had a trojan BUT not from this torrent! this torrent (and game) worked perfectly on Windows vista 64-bit i guess and extracted with 7-Zip
,ftgamble,2010-02-13T03:04Z,"Download and install was quik, however when i try to play it says my trial period has exceeded. I'm guessing my son has played the demo. How do i fix this. Do i per se have to re誰nstall windows?"
,ftgamble,2010-02-13T03:34Z,"I tried manual removal of all files + regedit.  no succes.  Tried several De誰nstallers. No succes either.

I do not want to re誰nstall windows. Is there another way?

pls mail: ftgamble@gmail.com"
,mw2terorist,2010-06-02T09:43Z,"For anyone who is strugling to obtain the bin/cue fro these files is simple: take the first one and rename it like this: add-wose.001>>add-wose.rar. After this it should transform in a rar one and simply go to extract and it would extract from all the files. That's how i do with all these things. ;) 
 Sorry for the bad english"
,mad_flyer,2010-10-06T23:02Z,"Shit doesn't work. After I rename file to add-wose.rar and try to extract, says I need the next volume being add-wose.000 or whatever. "
