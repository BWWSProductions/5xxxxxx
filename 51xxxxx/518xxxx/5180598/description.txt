NASA Moon Anomalies III - Other Peoples Work - watchZEITGEISTnow


Hello fellow Moon groovers!

Today I present some of the best work collected over the net in the past year or so by some of the pioneers, and new to the field of Moon anomaly research.

Please take time to research and look up these peoples work on the net...

I thank Alex Collier, Fred Steckling, George Leonard, Don Wilson, John Lear, Mike Singh, zorgan, Alan Sturm, William Cooper, Ingo Swann to name a few for their visionary insight and their persistence to go before all those that oppose, ridicule, and dismiss your work. You are the true 'heroes' of our times. You are inspirational and give hope to those who KNOW the world is run by a few dickheads that need to be exposed and held accountable for their deceptions. 

I also have a torrent with 370 Moon anomalies taken from Lunar Orbiter photos from 1966-1967 a must see!

They are here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4966387
