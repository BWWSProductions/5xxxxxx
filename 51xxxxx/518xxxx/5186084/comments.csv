Thanks for the upload!  I'd been looking forever for a copy that isn't missing the voice tracks on the single player mission.  I can actually get into it now!  Thanks again!"

,picklator,2011-10-29T00:58Z,"I registered just to comment on this game.  I was super excited to play it, it loads up fine, goes through the first few cutscenes fine, then when it says set status on green alert, the screen starts blinking and glitching and wont stop. this is in single player I havent tried multi player yet..  There are also NO original voices in this. when Picard speaks to you it is in text only.  I am very disappointed with this Upload. please come up with a fix or solution for these problems."
,kurtyogs,2012-03-14T05:01Z,"run the game in windows 98 compatability mode and 256 color mode, and the sound works fine, if you know how to edit your soundboard settings in bios and Windows, if its a tower with a sound card ,use the onboard one......if it has 1, if not  text only or get hold of an old soundboard that supports sound blaster pro.....or tough text reading :o)"
