,gimpythewonder,2010-09-08T05:39Z,I installed the Haali splitter thingy but I still can't get subtitles to show up.  Can you help me out plz?  I normally use Zoom Player but I tried it w/ WMP and DivX player (which had some weir popping going on) and none of them showed subtitles when I turned them on.  any help is much appreciated
