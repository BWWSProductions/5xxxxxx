,revdfowl,2009-12-19T07:18Z,Im using it now but not sure how its gonna look.. not able to edit the DVD menu too much will tell you if it worked or not in a few...
,revdfowl,2009-12-19T08:32Z,"Ok it works great.. I was able to burn an AVI file to DVD that I could not do with Nero, but I would still recommend you keep nero as well because you can burn most AVI files to dvd and it has better menu editing abilities then this one does.. But I do recomend it 100% as a back up or for people new to making DVDS.."
