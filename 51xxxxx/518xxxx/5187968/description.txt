This is one of at least two productions from the 1982 Festival.  Although this does not compare to some of the other live concerts the music is playable, nothing is going to make a greatest hits list, but I have listened to the album half a dozen times and my Jazz collection is 200 plus albums.  The other version of this same concert with the exact same tracks can be found here:  Take 5 Quartet:  A Jazz Hour With Dave Brubeck Quartet.  Track 9 is a bonus track which was recorded January 28, 1983, Cannes, France. ~ Skylark Poems
