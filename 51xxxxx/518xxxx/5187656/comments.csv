and no. the app itself is ""illegal"" because it violated the GPL v3 that Bootmii was distributed under. even though the source is included for the bootmii files, the license requires that the source code for everything in the distributed package be include. and sneek is not open source. you couldn't create a ""patch"", thats not how this work. it makes the SD card the wii's Nand, ther for unlocking virtual unlimited storage. also there is no nand dump included."
