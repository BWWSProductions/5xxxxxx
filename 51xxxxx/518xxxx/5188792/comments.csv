,davidh27,2009-11-30T14:20Z,This is legit. The latest ep 10 aired in Australia and this is the rip of that. Thanksgiving in the U.S. saw no ep this last week.
,CyberGRIM,2009-11-30T14:28Z,Finally! Thanks! :)

Season 1, Episode 10: A561984
Original Air Date?3 December 2009
Against Wedeck's orders, Mark and Demetri travel to Hong Kong in search of the woman claiming to know details of Demetri's fate; Lloyd tries to come clean about his and Simon's involvement in the global blackout - against Simon's better judgment -- and Zoey discovers the true meaning of her flashforward.

Next US airings:
Thur. Dec. 3 8:00 PM ABC 

Is this real?

I already downloaded one E10 from BT Junkie which was a moviex player P.O.S..

Says December 3rd on IMDB and this doesn't say it's preair in the description."
,DeltaPan,2009-11-30T14:44Z,"Sorry.

Australia had it first did they.

Caught out once already i'm obviously suspicious when IMDB says air date is 03/12."
,davidh27,2009-11-30T15:27Z,Flashforward airs on Mondays In Australia.(That's Sunday in the U.S.) They are now ahead because this ep did not air last Thursday U.S. time. It is legit.

,V1X0,2009-11-30T16:15Z,Crashes @ 01:39 for me. :(( Tried with 3 different media players. 
,Zenman1976,2009-11-30T16:36Z,"EZTV RULES.. Best ""TV shows"" uploader(s) on the net imho.

,Big-fat-cone,2009-11-30T18:37Z,"Anyone else having problems downloading this?

I can download the torrent with no problems but when it opens in vuze it says their are 0 seeds and 0 leaches.

Does anyone know why this might be happening? Thanks."
,ava10,2009-12-01T11:34Z,Thanks eztv.
,ergabo,2009-12-01T14:32Z,THX !
[V],matimike,2009-12-03T03:30Z,thanks
,Skillem,2009-12-03T07:39Z,Hey thanks eztv! This episode finally gives me the feeling that this show is getting somewhere. I wounder how they will keep it going after the date happens. Or do they plan too? Maybe another blackout will happen... Its funny though that the people dont realize the future is happening because they saw it. Not because it was going to happen anyway.
,zen-TAO,2009-12-05T03:04Z,"Thanks.
Dont know why there is a proper out.

This one works fine for me.

V1X0 at 2009-11-30 16:15 CET: - use VLC-player, it works fine.

Peace and Love!"
,LazyTown,2009-12-07T06:12Z,where is episode 9? I haven't seen it up in like 2 weeks but 10 is out.
,x2rob,2009-12-23T23:08Z,"

,sammoth65,2010-05-08T22:36Z,euh? i downloaded this about 20 times and everytime it crashes a around 1m50s... got the full season from you and so far almost 100% perfect but this one seems to be broken.
,dlarrym,2010-07-31T08:13Z,"Does everyone SEE the Bright Florescent GREEN SKULL!! Hello, they don't pass those out to just anyone I have yet to see any member or guest that downloaded a torrent from an up-loader with a SKULL that turned out to be a FAKE. LASTLY, I also don't imagine that the TPB would allow any skull marked member to upload bogus torrents."
