Their Love Story Lasted A Lifetime.

From the acclaimed director of What Dreams May Come, Map Of The Human Heart is a visually stunning love story that would last a lifetime! When a half-Eskimo boy named Avik (Jason Scott Lee - Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story) leaves his artic home with a British mapmaker (Patrick Bergin - Beneath Loch Ness) to seek medical attention in Canada, it marks the first steps in an epic personal journey. In Montreal Avik meets Albertine (Anne Parillaud - La Femme Nikita), a half-Indian girl with whom his life will be forever linked. Spanning decades and distance through war and adversity, their star-crossed relationship becomes a grand romantic adventure of never-ending intensity! Featuring a memorable appearance by big-screen favorite John Cusack (Runaway Jury) - you'll agree with critics everywhere who raved about this outstanding motion picture!
