The Boys of Paul Street (Hungarian: A PÃ¡l-utcai fiÃºk) is a 1969 American-Hungarian co-production film directed by ZoltÃ¡n FÃ¡bri and based on the youth novel The Paul Street Boys (1906) by the Hungarian writer Ferenc MolnÃ¡r. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It features English-speaking (American and British) child actors (led by Anthony Kemp as ErnÅ‘ Nemecsek) accompanied by Hungarian adult ones including FÃ¡bri's favorite actress Mari TÃ¶rÅ‘csik as Nemecsek's mother. Currently it is acclaimed as the best and most faithful adaptation of MolnÃ¡r's source novel and a classic film in Hungary.
