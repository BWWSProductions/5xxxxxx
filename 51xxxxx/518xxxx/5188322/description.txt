Death Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band takes its name from a satirical song of the same name, written by Vivian Stanshall and performed by The Bonzo Dog Band on their 1967 album Gorilla and in The Beatles experimental movie, Magical Mystery Tour.

Death Cab for Cutie began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs With Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums.
