The pirates bay tracker is, until further notice, down. They are using DHT to track the torrents. Read more here... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table#DHT_protocols_and_implementations"

,okachobi,2009-12-02T01:43Z,"I'm trying to transcode this to .m4v in preparation for importing/burning a HD-DVD with DSP, but ffmpeg gives errors like this as I demux the ac3 stream:

[NULL @ 0x10181f200]error, non monotone timestamps 23040 >= 23040
    Last message repeated 6 times

In the past when I've seen this, the audio breaks up repeatedly on the HD-DVD.  The episodes labeled ""DIMENSION"" always transcode perfectly.  The episodes labeled ""RED"" (at least the last two) have this issue when transcoding, but play fine with VLC. Any ideas? thx."

dexter for life "
