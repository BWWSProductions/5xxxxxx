This image can be copied to a USB drive from both Windows and Linux.
Instructions are as follows. You will need a 4GB pendrive or memory card
to use this. Disk requirements may be reduced in future versions.

Linux:
Extract chromiumos.img and run the following command in the same
directory as the file, where X is the device name of your USB drive.

#  sudo dd if=usb.img of=/dev/X

where {/dev/X} is you usb drive, or, like me, {/dev/sdb} to install to SSD


Once the command finishes, you can then boot from the USB drive.


Windows:
Download Image Writer for Windowsand extract the
program. Launch the program, and select the image (chromiumos.img) and
your USB drive letter from the drop down box. Click "Write".
The install image will then be copied to the drive. Once it's done,
close the program and you can then boot from the USB drive.


Important Info:
Default username for offline login is USERNAME, default shared password is 1.
