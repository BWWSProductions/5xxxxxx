Awesome album."
,PMartinez,2009-11-30T02:57Z,"two of these songs are incorrectly labeled.
A Call to Arms should be ""Vox Populi""
Equinox should be ""L490""

also, Search ""and"" Destroy instead of ""&"""

,kian089,2009-12-24T19:31Z,"tOKIN BOUT aLBUM
its pretty ,actually aloooooot disappointing to get this kinda low leveled music from a world class band after FOUR years . i donno any music site, like imdb as a movie site,where we can put our views up for the music , so i ws unable to hold it bak and i had to put it here..
i cant even cout a single song which i can count as a good song ...
its like fame spoils everybody ...
1 up for the torrent though for a quick release...keep it up man
thank you"

,joka2385,2010-03-11T16:42Z,"Well if fame spoils everyone Jared letto's been spoiled since ""My SO Called Life"". Not 2 mention all the movie's he's acted in. Call it artistic differentiation or whatever but really no bands 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or even 20th album will compare to the 1st. The chemistry is never the same. So back to this torrent. Its a Great album!!! Thanks"
,joka2385,2010-03-11T16:44Z,Comment above is about Kian089's remarks to this album
,TheBombio,2010-03-12T03:49Z,"Safe torrent.
Great quality.

Decent album. Thanks."
,merethan,2010-07-18T14:38Z,"""If you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable, well, so do we. And the fact that EMI informed us that not only aren't they going to pay us AT ALL but that we are still 1.4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier.""   -Jared Leto (lead singer 30stM)"
