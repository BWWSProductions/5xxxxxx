,Lopes_221,2010-06-15T20:29Z,"does this have the hidden ""Half Moon Bay"" track on the save me sf album? or does anyone know where to find it?"
,xMxyztplk,2010-07-24T07:43Z,"Anyone know where to get Album Artwork for ""One & A Half""? I can only find a 300 & a 170 one. Anyone have or know where to find one at least 500x500?"
,xMxyztplk,2010-07-24T08:00Z,"Does anyone have or know where to get, Album Artwork for ""One & A Half"". The best I can find is a 300x300 one from last.fm but it's crappy quality & the only other ones I find are 174 or less. Or does anyone have a scanner & a non-mutilated copy of the album artwork they can scan & put up?"

,Zarkow,2011-01-03T18:01Z,"Awesome share. A note, most people might play this great FLAC release on the computer, but if you want to put it on your cell phone etc you might have to convert it to a MP3.

If you wanna try a Beta of a free tool called zAudioConverter, that does this. http://www.digitalsoftware.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=289&tag=zaudioconverter_beta_released_"
