,scatattack,2009-11-27T19:00Z,"Thx for the up, it's the best version I've came across so far 
A7.5  V7.5 ,     
but the movie itself is quite shit. I did expect as mush, as danny glover and john cusack are the main roles. I was planning to check this out in the cinema to appreciate the special effects, but honestly the effects is all this movie has to offer (just like terminator salvation), because it certainly aint got much else i.e acting etc.

Overall it's American cheese, I think that's the best way to put it.  :')"
,universal300,2009-11-27T19:57Z,"Firstly, everyone is entitled to their opinion as far as quality is concern. I give this torrent a   10 10.
 Its great quality & I have no complaints.

Secondly, Thank you for sharing and know that you're very well appreciated not only you saved me a trip and a $ticket$ but also from having to listen to others talk through out the movie in the cinema which is often the case (-:

Thirdly, I like your work and effort and would like to request New Moon from you?!?

And finally for those of you who have nothing nice to say to extremezone after his effort and thoughtfulness;

I say go ""swallow a dick up to you ""HICK-up"" stop moaning and learn to be grateful.

2 Thumbs up for *extremezone* @)~)~~~"

He took basterd from the Tarantino movie Inglourious Basterds, where it is spelled wrong on purpose. He's not an absolute retard, although he may have presented himself as one."
,malarius,2009-11-28T21:55Z,"Some people just can?t appreciate a good cam..
Inglorious_Basterd should perhaps change nic to Ungrateful_Buzzard and stop screaming???"
,altoid1001,2009-11-29T05:32Z,"to aids infested fag: dude, i now hate gays even more because of how obnoxious you are. I was at a ""just keep me out of it level"" but now you can burn in hell for all i care"
,thecherrypopper,2009-11-29T07:21Z,"You know, all of the sudden I want to murder the next 1000 fucking billion homosexual fucking faggots that i see... oh and by the way... this movie... is confusing... i may sound dumb when i say this... but when they talked... i didint understand what da fuck they was talkin about..."

,xo_xo,2010-01-20T13:41Z,"good download, but watchout big brother is watching this one. 

I received a warning from my isp about downloading this torrent. It was originally sent as a complaint from a big movie studio. "

,Video_Veg,2010-02-15T22:27Z,"I heard some bad press on this one, but I thought it was best 'Disaster' movie yet - it will be hard for next ""Armagedon"" movie to beat.   Yes, it was C- for human interest, and a number of ""gimme a break"" close escapes, but what the heck. Plot was basic 'run for your life' type.
Quality and sound good, I found myself turning subs on and off for brief foriegn language sections - no need next time I watch.
For those who go to the races to see the crashes, this movie is for you.
(I prefer TV - has the 'Slo-Mo' replays)
Thanks extremezone, and all seeders."
,Video_Veg,2010-02-15T23:08Z,"For you guys worried about ""Big Brother"", don't worry - you can't 'pirate' a DVD that hasn't been released yet. The new owners of TPB haven't ended disputed downloads, but may well be passing on subscriber info.
Im' from Canada, so it's legal here. We all pay a 'surcharge' on all blank media to cover royalties. The USA should consider the same deal."
,dea986,2010-02-28T20:13Z,"bad video quality,audio better but take another version.."
,xxpenceyxprepxx,2010-03-08T17:22Z,"Ah I love watching people argue over morons via comments on a torrent. It's so funny to read.

Thanks for the upload. Will seed when I have internet access. "
,foreignadaption,2010-03-23T00:21Z,"@altoid1001

I don't know what your problem is with gay guys, but that is beside the point.  Any logical person knows hell does not exist, and they also know that heterosexuals are the #1 cause for the spread of HIV.  "
