,VastLite,2009-12-01T04:14Z,"Is there any way one of the peeps out there can take these 128k's, convert them to pcm, and then post a 44.1khz 64kbit mono mp3? The 64's are still 22khz stereo atm and they're killing my ears. DL'ing ~170MB a day would also kill my (satellite) bandwidth limit. I would really appreciate if we could find some efficient way of going about this. Thank you goose for these, I may have to start using them if we can't sort out the 64k's."

,cface,2009-12-01T22:37Z,"thank you mothergoose

but just so you know, the 128VBR never work good for me :/ I always used to d/l the 64k. problem is, with the 128, on my ipod they do not play back correctly, for example if i go back a bit with the left button, it will go to some place where it isnt!! so there is no way to get back!!! its random, like on 30:33 might be the same part as 20:35!!!!

luckily i have sony vegas, so i just converted this into a regular mp3 ;D"
,mancation,2009-12-01T23:13Z,"portableapps.com/apps/music_video/bonkenc_portable 

is a little application that does not need to be installed.  it is made for a jump drive, but the folder can be placed anywhere to run.  i use it at work to convert to a non vbr for compatibility.  i spread the virus at work over the network and the vbr causes some trouble.  just an option..."
,cface,2009-12-01T23:36Z,moncation that was itneresting i will check that out!!! but btw i converted the vbr to a regular 128kbps mp3 with vegas and it now has no problems like the vbr does!!!
,go_yukuri,2009-12-02T01:54Z,"Thanks for the link to 12/1 's show.  Appreciated.

128s are all good.  It's all good."
,yerk55,2009-12-02T02:18Z,Thanks as always MG. And thanks for keeping ahead of the (sadly) collapsing torrent sites.
,Tubebaum,2009-12-02T04:43Z,Thanks for the uploads Goose but can we possibly get the 64k too?
,anonymiss,2009-12-02T10:33Z,"i like these 128k. Takes longer to dl but its worth it. :3 Just sounds better.

thanks for the win, goosie. "
[V],mothergoose56,2009-12-02T11:20Z,"> can we possibly get the 64k too? 

Shuazien has been upping the early 64k's:

http://thepiratebay.org/user/shuazien/

Come on now, I was gonna quit altogether as ""Real Life Stuff"" has gotten in the way a bit - and now I'm upping R&F on top of the 128k's. You see, the perfectionist in me won't allow just a re-encode of the 128k - so that means two separate encodes and two separate edits. Yes, I could edit the raw wav's but then they'd go up later because the wav to mp3 encoding would be a few hours altogether.  

I was looking to see if one of the file hosting sites did transcoding, that would kill two birds. I could step the size down a little for the bandwidth-challenged and have an http dl option for those who cannot torrent. Haven't found one yet but it might be out there.

How about a live 202 stream? One that works as a java applet in Windows, Linux and Mac? I need to set up a few more hoops but I think I can make it happen and cover my ass too. It'd be O&A and R&F and the ever increasing commercials 24/7."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-12-02T11:24Z,"RE: 64k vs 128k

cface, do you have an older gen ipod? I stripped the id3 v2 tags from my 128k's awhile back and it solved some compatibility issues with Apple's products. It's basically their issue, for some reason they don't fully support all mp3 variants. Some cheaper off-brand units may not like vbr's either but since cutting the v2 tags I think probably 98% of peeps are good with them.

But especially since it's talk content, if I go with CBR 128k's it'll basically add 10-20+ MB's per file. And when I A/B'ed them with AKG pro headphones awhile back I thought the cbr's actually sounded a hair worse than the vbr's. 

So basically I either add size to everyone's download's (with a hair lower quality, imo) or the handful of folks with issues just get shauz's 64k's. Heck, I really outta be using OGG or AAC but there's going to be a signifigant percentage of people not able to play those at all so I go with the best sounding, most compatible option. 

They are going up later as it is, so my main goal is tight editing and the best sound quality possible in these uploads. "
