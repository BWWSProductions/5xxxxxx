I give up:("
,D0gmeat,2009-11-28T02:37Z,"Yeah, thanks, but just didn't work like all the other cracks. Gosh, may just have to buy this sucker. Maybe that was the plan all along. ;)"
,Rittihilatti,2009-11-28T03:30Z,"Ohh, my mistake, its working now for me! Sometimes it is still crash, but it is rare, much more playable than earlier. No cola or male weapon bug!

+1"
,dr.vamp,2009-11-28T03:56Z,"GREAT JOB!

,k_p_n_b,2009-11-28T08:47Z,"Great torrent, finally works good. No crashes, no bugs. :)

,raffadizz,2009-11-28T12:29Z,"I keep trying to run revLoader but it says ""ProcName value not found on commandline or in rev.ini. Please edit the file"" ...

what do I do?

Also, the ""Setup file 'gameinfo.txt' doesn't exist in subdirectory 'left4dead2'. Check -game parameter or VCONFIG setting"
,raffadizz,2009-11-28T13:05Z,Nevermind. I'm pretty sure I found the problem. 
,raffadizz,2009-11-28T13:40Z,"Nope, the ""Setup file 'gameinfo.txt' doesn't exist in subdirectory 'left4dead2'. Check -game parameter or VCONFIG setting

HELPP"

,Aavis,2009-11-29T19:55Z,"GUYS GUYS GUYS !!!

This WORKS !
I've have the Globe v. of L4D2 and here's what I did -

1) Download and extract the entire content of the zip-file 
2) Go to the ""Sound"" folder where there is a ""Globe Converter"" .. Just double-click on it and wait until it's done.. Should take 10 minutes max.
3) Download this torrent and extract at the main L4D folder
4) This step is IMPORTANT. Once ur done with that, DO NOT FORGET the reg files.. Run either one which suits you.
5) Just PLAY !! :D

It fixes all the bugs.. Every single one !!
And no need to change the date.. I have an XP and meet the requirements easily.

There is however, one glitch.. Every time u quit, it resets ur achievements. That's no big deal but I think it doesn't erase em in the RAZOR v. 

Have fun !!"
,gamepsyched,2009-11-30T07:14Z,"Dude i am very impressed, This is the ONLY crack that does not crash and is 100% working. Much thanks to the poster!!!!"
[T],eXPer1ence,2009-12-01T14:43Z,"It still crashes to the desktop the same as all the other cracks.

How is it working for some people?

They all use ATI cards?

I use nVidia and it just crashes, can't even get past the first corridor even with this crack people say works.
"
,cauzee,2009-12-02T03:04Z,"Aavis thanks for instructions.. it Works great! 
I have had only one crash, and that was during the level change..
Only the sounds are little fucked up, but its very playable anyway :D"
,Rated.,2009-12-06T00:00Z,"Thank you "" VELiUX "" for this crack it works perfectly!! now i can play L4D2.

BTW when i play it the graphics look weird is it my computer? its a WindowsXP and it old i might just play it on my lap top that has windows 7"
,Rated.,2009-12-06T00:15Z,how come on the loading screen the whole thing changes to purple? like it goes on the normal color then 2 secs later it goes all purple. why?
,Tazzy95,2009-12-20T06:54Z,How do you play multiplayer using Genera?
,yakuu,2009-12-27T20:59Z,this thing don't make things better i cant even play now. crashes afta 1 min of play

,earth3,2011-01-28T00:56Z,"if it doesnt work guys do this:
goto registry and delete the value u added

,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T14:33Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768

,IndoctriNation,2011-07-22T22:44Z,"@Aavis:

You know what, you son of a bitch?

I've seen comments like you a plenty of times, probably a plenty too much of times, and no matter how much I extract my L4D2 zip/rar/whatever file, I never seem to get the 'globe converter.exe' file out, even with my antivirus down (yeah, I know, strange, how about you figure this shit out, hu?)

So how 'bout it? Either I figure out what the f*ck's wrong with every f*cking L4D2 torrent I download off this shit-site, or you tell me what the hell's wrong with my pc."
,Akibre44,2012-02-14T15:11Z,this shit wont download
,zahej,2012-07-11T12:03Z,"dude i downloaded the game but when i start it it says ""steam must be running in order to play this game"" HELPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
