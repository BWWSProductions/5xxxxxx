Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended Portable Edition
_____________________________________________


Packed with VMWare ThinApp Enterprise 4.30 on Windows XP (Not compatible with lower operating systems)

Tested to work on Windows 7 and Vista.

First run will take a bit to load it up as it has to create the user files in the application directory.  All apps in the Utilities folder are the programs required to run Photoshop.  You can completely ignore them as you never NEED to open them to use photoshop.

Pre-Activated with HOSTS hack.  No matter what computer you run it on, it will always be active.

Requirments:
700MB disk space
512 GB RAM
1024x768 Screen Resolution
DirectX 9.0c
Windows XP SP3/Vista SP2/7 Home Basic-Ultimate



What is Portable?
Portable means you dont have to install.  You can copy this to a USB, and it will run directly from it.  You can run it on amy computer that has the minimum requirments listed above.  I personally use it at school on the library computers.
