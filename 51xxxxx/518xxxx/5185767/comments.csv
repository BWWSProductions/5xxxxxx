,impz0r,2009-11-29T19:00Z,Awesome! Thanks alot man!
,nemesiswes,2009-11-30T07:36Z,"Is this the full cs4 extended, just in portable form or does it have features missing "
,cclloyd,2009-12-01T01:08Z,Its an exact copy of the one you would install.  So it its full with all features that come by default with it.  Havent figured out how to include extra plugins.
,jimoffar,2009-12-01T04:01Z,"I can't find a Plug-In folder so I don't see any way to install my favorite plug-ins.  Otherwise, it works fine."
,cclloyd,2009-12-01T04:30Z,"Mabye what ill do, is ill start a little post somewhere, tell u guys the link, then ask for suggestions for fonts, plugins, brushes, ect. and then ill repack and upload as a customized version."
,TSSPat,2009-12-03T07:09Z,"""Win32:SdBot-269 [Trj]"" Trojan found.
Along with another one...

These were found in the .DAT file.
Whats up with that? I need Photoshop for a class project.
Thanks, Pat."
,neptunecity,2009-12-03T14:03Z,"The download was successful and it works fine, but it has a big lag with the brushes and painting in general that would, I imagine, make a lot of people not even want to use it.
I looked it up and adobe made a patch to clear it, but it isn't compatible with this. is there a way you can put it on, or something?"
,TSSPat,2009-12-03T14:20Z,"IS THIS SAFE TO USE OR NOT?
It keeps reading ""Trojan Virus Found in the .dat file""
"
,cclloyd,2009-12-04T00:14Z,The trojan is just the modified hosts file.  that file is needed to keep the license active.  its perfectly safe.
,swexpert,2009-12-07T16:02Z,"512 GB RAM - those days are not here yet! But the way m S apps are being designed to eat memory, the day wont be far..."
,getsomepie,2009-12-08T04:16Z,"Great program, I am ecstatic for the ""Full Master Collection"", that is, assuming it's going to be portable. It will be just what I've been looking for quite a while."
,cclloyd,2009-12-08T21:41Z,"estimated date for MC CS4 coming around 12/18/09.  Date isnt for certain though. 

Required specs will be
10 GB disk space
3 GB RAM
1024x768 Screen Resolution
DirectX 9.0c
Windows XP SP3/Vista SP2/7 (excluding starter edition)


And possibly after christman or mabye new years will be the x64 bit version of photoshop."
,Fighterlegend,2009-12-13T02:37Z,"This DOES NOT have any viruses.

It contains 'samples', but is not harmful.

Thanks for the upload, cclloyd! Great portable app!"
,gmfdaa,2009-12-13T18:43Z,can you use this without a usb drive...and does it work for windows xp
,cclloyd,2009-12-14T00:44Z,"Works for Windows XP that have SP3.  Yes you can use this on a USB, all you have to do is run it."
,desw,2009-12-18T18:09Z,sweet thanks this will make my girlfriend verry happy and you know what thats means :D
,ThinkCreative,2009-12-19T00:33Z,"I have downloaded it and the NOD32 said everything was alright. 
However, when I ran it it didn't start up and secondly it changed my resolution to about 1000x700 (approx). It didn't work at all on my pc and half my taskbar dissapeared and FireFox behaved weird. I have deleted the whole folder and ran system restore and now everything is back to normal (I hope).

I am not saying this is a virus, maybe Win 7 just behaves weird on this. And since cclloyd is a trusted user I think this might just be the case."
,sak_kool,2009-12-21T04:55Z,"hey I'm unable to open this file...

,Skyee,2009-12-28T09:14Z,"it works fine, but there's a problem everytime I open the program the terms and agreement keeps popping up and asking to accept etc. everytime I open CS4"

,L.exe.M,2010-01-03T12:40Z,"This shit fucked up up my word processors, every time i try to type something it crashes for some reason. Anyone have a solution for this? Or am i just being stupid?"
,buckeyed,2010-01-09T07:10Z,Smooth. Thanks so much

,googrester,2010-01-19T04:53Z,"Trojan detected... ""Generic.dx!hk""

,Orion727,2010-02-21T23:58Z,This appears to work fine except for one little problem; I cant get any of the tools to work. I can select them normally in the toolbox but upon placing the cursor on my image it remains the glove-hand and only moves my image/canvas.... what gives?
,Orion727,2010-02-22T00:02Z,"Okay, IDK what that was all about but its back to normal now. I increased the cache levels and set the scratch drive to a different physical drive. Weird... anyways, Thanks for this :D"
