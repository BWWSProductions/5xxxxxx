Thanks for the upload :P"

Only problem is that if someone is trying to look fer replacement CBR mp3 files, then they'll have hard luck with the Engine album. I cannot find a high quality CBR of this album anywhere on the net except from furk (site)... even then the FLAC download never finishes and stops midway. If anyone can point me to a CBR download (not 128kbs), then I'd appreciate that.

Still, an awesome torrent. Rock on. \m/"
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-02-15T21:08Z,"NEVERMIND!!! I found the 320kbs CBR album of Engine. But mane, I was searchin really hard and fer a good long time though. Funny how that worked out...

It's located on some kind of thai board I believe. Google the album and put this at the end in the search: zidoboardcom. The password is Rapidfind.org

Thanks again dude. \m/"

also, if the first link doesn't work, just use the Rapid link.
