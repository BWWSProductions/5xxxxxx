This is a great resource for some basic nutritional info, mainly tailored for the P90X fitness program. But the recipes in this pdf are good for anyone working out or just wanting some good healthy food. There is also calorie info and many tips for eating good.


The original was a ridiculous 387.7 MB with poster size pages and that was just not practical to load a doc that size on my netbook, I scaled to a more normal size (41MB @ Letter/A4) so the pages don't take for ever to load, quality is about the same.

There are a few (8) missing pages (since the original), but nothing important only the phase 3 market (shopping) list, all the recipes are there so you still know what to buy. 


This is the best version available.


Info:
139 Pages, English, .pdf format, 41.5 MB.




There's apparently a full version thats not missing the 8 pages(although it is 3x larger) here:

If anyone feels like playing with compressing it then optimal results can be achieved by:

1. Import into GIMP and save layers (pages) as individual png's using the sg-save-all-layers.scm script (google it).

2. Batch convert the files into jpeg, i used gThumb for that, but for windows there are other things.

3. Insert pics in the right order into openoffice and export to pdf.

(normally imagemagick would be used for all this, but it was buggy for me, so not having been able to use that approach i cant guarantee as good results. although people using windows might be able to find another app for this)
