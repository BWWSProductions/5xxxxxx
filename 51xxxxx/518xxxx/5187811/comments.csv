An own section, I'm all for it !"
,abban009,2009-12-07T22:03Z,evn i thnk it wud be gr888....coz a lot of ppl like myself prefer microHD for their small size and appreciable quality...so plzzz make a spearate section if u can manage one..thnk u
,T-Fish,2009-12-13T21:38Z,"its a stupid idea, sorry.
theres no such thing as micro HD.

running time * bitrate = file size

if there would be a category like it, then where would it begin/end ? people cant even differentiate between SD and HD as you'll find enough 720x480 vids in the HD section as is.
no point in making it even messier.

,No_256,2010-03-02T12:15Z,"This video contains random intruder scenes that annoyingly flash starting after 50th minute.

Very unhappy!"
,simpledood,2010-03-16T08:45Z,"@ no_256, that is part of the film, if you pay attention to the story, you'll make sense of those quick flashes. Mungki thank you, it looks great, and it's a movie I enjoyed as well."
,misiek.bogiem,2010-04-25T15:53Z,What is this *.tbn file included? is it subtitles file?
,_mungki_,2010-08-03T19:56Z,"@misiek.bogiem the .tbn file is a thumbnail for applications such as XBMC, Plex or Boxee"
,osriccc,2010-11-14T16:28Z,"Dude, THIS IS A PERFECT RIP, thank you so much. Seed this until you die, pleas, my friends. ONLY problem I have... Is that I really want the 6CH audio, please. Can somebody or uploader upload a 6CH audio track to merge with MKVmerge and replace the 2CH one? THANKS!!"
