,himter2,2010-02-27T06:19Z,"actually they dont suck
they have less bugged quests than any realm i have seen.
apparently constantly means every 3 to 8 hours now?. and besides they are moving to a different core very soon which will make it more stable and having more complete playable classes than ever.

but the real reason i play here is because there isnt a bunch of asshat punks around and everyone is very friendly and they have a couple guilds that run alot of instances and raids nightly."

Just double click the launcher.exe in the game folder, let it update to 3.3.3 and then edit the realmlist.wtf file back to wow.dethpod.com and your good to go! (the file is located in the games /data/enUS/ folder simply delete the current text and add the line: set realmlist wow.dethpod.com)"

,Picklewalrus,2010-06-19T13:43Z,"Hi there, I downloaded it, extracted it, changed the realmlist too. Every time I open the launcher I get this message that says ""Blizzard Updater was unable to start up.
  The file ""WoW.exe"" could not be found. If this problem persists, you may be able to solve it by uninstalling and then reinstalling the game. If you are unable to correct this problem, please contact Blizzard Technical Support.""
What can I do so it can patch? I'm on a laptop with Windows 7. Not sure if that has anything to do with it though"
