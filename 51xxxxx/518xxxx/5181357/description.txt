What is it about? It seems like Alcatraz was just reopened Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but this time as a true action ride. The Rock minus lame jokes, minus goofy moments, minus incredibility = full throttle action.


tagline: The Rock rocks, finally!

original film name: The Rock
new film name : The Rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Thermalized
film studio name : Hollywood Pictures
edit crew name : CBB
Date Original Film Was Released : 1996
Date Edit Was Released : August 2007
Original Runtime : 136 min.
New Runtime : 125 minutes
Amount of time Cut/Added : 11 minutes cut

Cuts removed/added/extended :
Plenty of scenes were altered, too much to mention, but most of all these 5 scenes were really changed or even completely deleted:

    * 1. The stylist scenes: I reduced his gay behaviour and a lot of flat jokes that came with it. He still seems gay and special, but his appearance is a lot shorter and will not leave much of an impression.
    * 2. The Cable Car scene: What I did is, I deleted the cable car owner form the movie. His acting is so over the top and he is just not funny, but he spoils a cool car chase action scene.
    * 3. Stanley goes to vomit scene: Well, he still does, but this scene is much shorter. What was supposed to be funny, was not so much. Now he is more of a man.
    * 4. The Rollercoaster Mourge Ride scene: The entire scene was unrealistic to the max, so I tried to reduce the size of the cave and get rid of the wagon drive scenes. It worked pretty well.
    * 5. The thermite plasma explosion: Thermite plasma is not your usual bomb or explosive. It is hot like hell and causes a HUGE explosion. And because Stan could never survive to be blown away by that, I changed that, so now he escapes the explosion. I am very proud of this editing work.

Your intention for this fanedit:

    * THE ROCK is still one of the most successful action movies of all time and it ranks very high in my personal ranking of great entertaining movies, just because the action scenes were so well edited, the score is so great and the actors are just brilliant. Connery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cage are a great couple. Too bad there never was a part 2. But as I watched the movie again and again, the annoying things about it became more and more obvious, which made me hardly enjoy the movie anymore. Lame jokes, most of the time by people which are unimportant for the plot, and way over the top scenes, which became so embarrassing, spoiled the fun. So I decided that something needed to be done, to make this the movie I could watch over and over again, and I think I succeeded 100%. This fanedit is not so much shorter than the original, but the number of cuts is immense. Hopefully you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize a single one of them.

Your way to achieve your intention:

    * By eliminating the thread. Search and destroy.

Additional Comment:

    * I am very proud of this fanedit. What started so small became more important all the time and the final result is far above what I actually wanted in the first place, when I just meant to remove a few goofy scenes.

Time needed for the edition:

    * 4 weeks
