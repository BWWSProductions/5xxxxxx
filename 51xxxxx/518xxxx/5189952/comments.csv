,ArrrghX,2009-12-06T09:57Z,Could some nice pirate out there go back and seed S01E20 for me? It's driving me crazy to be missing the one Episode. 
,boubou80,2009-12-08T15:50Z,"thanks !  quality 10/10

i'll hav to say that this show really went 

from ""superb"" to ""superbe crap downfalling show"",
 when i think producers cancell shows like pushing daisies or sarah conor chonicles.... it's a shame."
,Kanegasi,2009-12-23T07:57Z,"ArrrghX, if you still want it, I'm seeding 120. I can't guarantee it'll help since I probably won't be anywhere near you or internet topography disagrees with a torrent connection to you."
,iJnf,2009-12-28T17:10Z,"When is the next ep going to be released?

A month has passed n nothing so far.. :o

Kind Regards."
