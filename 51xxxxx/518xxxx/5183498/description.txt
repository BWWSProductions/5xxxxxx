Season 4, Episode 8: Donna's Story
Original Air Dateâ€”20 November 2001

Donna writes a nasty story in the school paper, obviously taking the mickey out of Eric albeit under 

fake names and playing in the Victorian age, so when schoolgirls see trough the pseudonyms and scold 

him as cat-killer, he tries to write his own version... Red is startled that Bob has found a new lady 

friend -bossy Joanne, who picked him up shopping- and furious as she insists on doing the grilling, in 

Red's view at the very core of manhood. Kelso hasn't bought a dress for Jackie but half of the pinball 

machine in the diner, hoping for a 50% profit even each time he plays it; alas nobody else does, and 

Fez surprises with business sense...

Season 4, Episode 9: The Forgotten Son
Original Air Dateâ€”21 November 2001

Eric feels rejected by both parents. Kitty goes lunching out with Donna, and they become friends, 

baking cookies together, according to Jackie ample reason for jealousy. When Red gets to make a 

training video for Pricemart, he chooses to star photogenic Michael Kelso as stock-boy, although that's 

Eric's real job; he intends to play the 'character' in John Travolta style... Leo the hippie says he 

inherited $1,000,000 from his Uncle Eddy, and generously takes Fez and Hyde shopping.

Original Air Dateâ€”27 November 2001

Fez is dating fat Rhonda, who just returned from Mississippi and gets Donna and Jackie to give her 

feminine advice to become more desirable, but he still prefers her as she was. Red is charmed by 

assertive new Pricemart cash register clerk Stacey, so he tries to set her up with Eric, but she is 

more interested in- Forman Senior, who was already wrestling with intimacy with Kitty on the clock .

Season 4, Episode 11: The Third Wheel
Original Air Dateâ€”11 December 2001

Eric convinces the guys to spend a girls-free night bowling, but Hyde scores an instant-kissing chick 

on the alley, Jill, which kills the plan. Red and pastor Dave have such fun as basketball supporters 

that it takes Kitty some insisting to remind the clergyman that mass is his Sunday priority, only to 

hear Red inspired him to resign! Donna is shocked Bob already sleeps with his new girlfriend Joanne, so 

her ma Midge is completely out of the picture. Jackie is jealous to find Rhonda is already more in the 

loop and even has a key to the basement and gets challenged to wrestle... 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Season 4, Episode 12: An Eric Forman Christmas
Original Air Dateâ€”18 December 2001

The gang grumbles Christmas isn't real fun any more, like when they were little kids, except Kelso who 

looks forward to the traditional X-mas children's specials, but Jackie won't let him watch. Kitty gets 

them to volunteer for pastor Dave's church pageant, with Eric as director, who has an all too hard time 

stopping everyone for modernizing their parts most un-biblically. When Dave tries to take over 

directing and the lead, he is irreverently tied up, enough for Leo to give the sacrilegers heaps. 

Meanwhile Red is so angry at Bob's seasonal 'noise' that he hides his neighbors' decorations. Yet, in 

the end...

Season 4, Episode 13: Jackie Says Cheese
Original Air Dateâ€”8 January 2002

Kitty brings Eric a lollipop, sex pamphlets and condoms to the men's disgust; yet when Kitty is home 

only one night and Red is out, he tries to steal some back; Eric thinks he thus found the basement 

stash with Hyde's dope, so the two desperately avoid each-other. To Fez' despair, the new exchange 

student Thomas, although not much brighter, is instantly popular because of his good looks; so Fez 

dumps him at the Michigan border. Jackie is broke, expects Kelso to get a job to keep her in cosmetics, 

but the only one available, at the Cheese Palace, is girls only- as her zit seems an even worse fate, 

she accepts it grumbling and complaining, but her first paycheck ever is a refreshing new experience...
