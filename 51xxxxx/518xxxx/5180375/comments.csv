,Dragonite_9,2011-04-12T23:05Z,"TY, just episode (not just here, all except the 720p HDTV) are really bad even for standard TV rip, but I think this DSrip (PDTV) is a bit better then the one named only aAF, but may just be imagination.. anyways so you know, if you really want a non really pixelated file get a HD 720p for episode 5, rest is standard OK 8/10 (for non HD non ripped down sources) (video) "
