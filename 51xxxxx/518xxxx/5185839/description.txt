This is the first and second audiobooks of the Alpha & Omega series in the Mercy Thompson world by Patrica Briggs, read by Holter Graham. 

I have split each book up into their chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  In the original torrent, they were split up into at least a hundred smaller pieces, and I joined together those pieces to create a chapter.

This contains the m4b files

Also included is the On the Prowl side story, that actually starts off the Alpha & Omega series.  I do not have an audiobook for it at, so this was the best I could do.

Enjoy.
