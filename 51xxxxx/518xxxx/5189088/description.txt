Benjamin H. Freedman's Speech given in 1961 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. [Original Audio + Transcript]



Benjamin H. Freedman was one of the most intriguing and amazing individuals of the 20th century. Born in 1890, he was a
successful Jewish businessman of New York City at one time principal owner of the Woodbury Soap Company. He broke with
organized Jewry after the Judeo-Communist victory of 1945, and spent the remainder of his life and the great
preponderance of his considerable fortune, at least 2.5 million dollars, exposing the Jewish tyranny which has enveloped
the United States.



Mr. Freedman knew what he was talking about because he had been an insider at the highest levels of Jewish
organizations and Jewish machinations to gain power over our nation. Mr. Freedman was personally acquainted with Bernard
Baruch, Samuel Untermyer, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, and many more movers and
shakers of our times. This speech was given before a patriotic audience in 1961 at the Willard Hotel, Washington, D.C.,
on behalf of Conde McGinley's patriotic newspaper of that time, Common Sense.
