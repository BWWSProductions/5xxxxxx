CommuniquÃ© is the second album by British rock band Dire Straits

CommuniquÃ© was recorded in November and December 1978, at Compass Point Studio, Nassau and was produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett. The album became the first LP ever to enter the German charts at number 1 in its first week of release (while their debut LP Dire Straits was still at number 3 in that country). CommuniquÃ© went on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide; in Europe, it sold 3.6 million copies and in the U.S. it reached gold status.

It was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000 in the United States.
