Sacred Seed--Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev

"All of us are given a seed that has the possibility of boundlessness. You are very careful and good, so you preserve the seed. I destroy the seed and make it into a tree."
- Sadhguru

In Sacred Seed, Sadhguru deals with moving on from mere survival that all life forms are capable of, to spiritual flowering - the highest possibility offered only to a human being, achieved through the journey inward.

Question: Sadhguru a pupil asked, "Is it best for me master, to walk the straight path or would it be better for me to choose the crooked path, on which my spirit leads me?" The master replied, "He who takes the straight path North sees the North; he who takes the straight path South sees the South; he who takes the straight path East sees the East; he who takes the straight path West sees the West; and he who walks the crooked path, sees all the directions."
