,cph1001,2010-01-02T22:13Z,you're right. yours is the first one I have seen. I just happen to have two of these albums. I also saw the group do this album in 1989 in a club called club richard in mississauga ontario. It blew me away

I made a digital copy yeas ago of this from the Vinyl LP I bought in the 70s, I will post it soon."
,pablo_jre,2012-05-23T08:20Z,"Even though it is being reported as no seeds, I am indeed seeding it. It has been on my seedbox for almost a year now. My ratio on this torrent from the last 30 days alone is 26.8

Just load it into your torrent client and I'm sure you'll have a connection to my box in no time.

I will seed this forever..."
