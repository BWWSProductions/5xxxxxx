Ripped November 26, 2009

I just picked this CD up yesterday after a year search for it.

I was looking for it on the internet for over three and only stumbled
upon it once. Someone had ripped it in a lossy 128kb/s MP3 format,
which was kind of a disappointment.

It's not even on iTunes or ebay. I have only been able to find the
vinyl on ebay, not one CD.

Anyway, last year around the beginning of Fall I started posting
wanted ads on every local listings web site I could think of.
Kijiji, craigslist, etc.

So here it is in the best quality possible. I was debating on ripping
it a lossless codec like FLAC but decided it was best to leave it as
original as possible.

This copy is the original Canadian CD pressing by Now See Hear in
1993. This is not the American redistribution.

I ripped it with IMGBurn at low speed. So just load up the .cue in
IMGBurn and burn it to a CD. You will have an exact one to one copy
of the original.

Enjoy!
