the song, a picture.jpg, and a random song. 
whenever you encounter a file you want but it comes with random crap follow these instructions:

with bittorrent/utorrent you click on the download within utorrent/bittorrent when its downloading, go to files(bottem right area..., and right click the random file so you can choose to not download.

I hope this helped the noobs.."
