I'm very interested in this story.


TIA"
,bart001fr,2009-11-30T18:51Z,"Hyperwords translated the title as

Harry Potter and the Torch with the Green Flames

so I'll be looking for a title with the words Green Flames in it, I guess.

For those of you who don't know, Hyperwords is a Firefox add-on for automatic translations. If you need stuff translated, I strongly suggest you get it.

Bye.
