If you're asked for a password, next time don't download your stuff in a sub/sub/sub/sub/sub/sub/sub-with-a-long-name/sub/subfolder.

Otherwise, rename the zips to a shorter name, extract again, and this time, TADAA, no password will be requested.
It's just a matter of total file path (folders+file names) that can't exceed a certain length, and zip clients will return a ""password"" error when they're facing it."
