Jason hits the expected hot issues and topics of the day, alternative news and insightful commentary.

Webster Griffin Tarpley guests during the first hour, discussing economic issues -- global and domestic -- as well as the implications of "climategate."

In the second hour Jason discusses the CBC's The Fifth Estate documentary -- "The Unofficial Story"  -- a surprisingly balanced [for mainstream media] piece about 9/11.  In conjunction with this, Jason airs some clips from his movie, "Fabled Enemies."

Jason also takes a number of open-line calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
