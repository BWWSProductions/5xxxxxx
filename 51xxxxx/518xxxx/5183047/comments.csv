,matteu12,2009-11-30T00:06Z,"Okay, I'm not at all new to torrents...

But when I spent the past hour and a half downloading this, it finished and there were just a bunch of files:

like 53 files that were all like .r53 to .r01

There was also one .rar, and when I unzipped it with 7zip, it showed a bunch of ARC files, and an application that doesn't start.

I've never encountered something like this before, and would love to have some help.

Thanks,

Matt"

But it doesn't start at all.

I am using Windows 7 witch might be the problem :\"

It says in it that the DVD must me inserted before you can start."
