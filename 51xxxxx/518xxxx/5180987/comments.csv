and have not decided on others as yet... :)"
,donaldinoduck,2009-11-28T05:22Z,"Heyy Bubanee ... Great to see ur consistency and all ur uploads being so popular and well seeded !

Mate ..just wondering why u don't upload your torrents with 320 kbps cbr ???

With skirgsk gone, all ur uploads are ruling the top 100 charts here at TPB..

With such high number of seeders, the community won't mind sharing that extra 20-30 mb for a 320 kbps cbr rip !!!

So please consider the same for your future uploads ... or if you feel there are challenges then could you also let us know as to why 320 kbps cbr uploads are not possible for you to upload ?

Again please don't take any offense to this.. just askin.
Respect !!!"
[V],bubanee,2009-11-28T07:14Z,"no offence taken.. i use VBR because i can play with settings to suit... and CBR does not interest me at all... and skirgsk and i are two totally different uploaders in alot of ways.. 

CBR is done and dusted... VBR>ABR>CBR thats the order of MP3 these days as stated by hydrogenaudio.. and those boys know what there talking about... cheers!

google it... :)"
