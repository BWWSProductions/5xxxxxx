,Eggre,2009-11-30T18:43Z,"Hey 123dutch, you're doing great work!  I just want you to know this.  You're not going to see the people you're helping by uploading this torrent but I can tell you that it's certain to help hundreds of thousands in only a matter of time -- people who could really use it!  You won't see them, of course, so I'll thank you on their behalf!

It's definitely helping me!

I've been looking for this Fluenz Spanish torrent for d@mn near a year now and am aware that hundreds of others are looking to!   I've even put in requests for it to no avail.  If we had the money, of course we would simply buy!  But we don't.

And you're helping a great deal, bro!

I've mounted the Fluenz 2 that you've blessed us with and it works great.   Am looking forward to testing out 1!

If you can get Fluenz 3 Spanish as well, would be great!

Couldn't thank you enough, 123dutch!   Also be on the look out for Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 4 & 5 which I'm hoping will show up soon too!  The unhacked version has already been posted (two days ago)."
,123dutch,2009-11-30T21:34Z,"Thank you VERY much for your long and nice reply! :)
This is what makes it all worth while.

I hope this ISO workes for you!

By the way: Rosetta Spanish level 4 and 5 IS on here:

,universekkk,2009-11-30T22:06Z,"I am downloading this file and can't wait to try it. 

I totally agree with Eggre. After I spent ?200+ on a horrible Spanish course which was useless, I simply don't have another hundreds to spend on other stuff. I searched this and Visual Link Spanish for a while, when I finally ended up here, I was so excited. After I realized the previous 1 didn't work, I left a comment but didn't expect any reply. Surprisingly, dutch replied so quickly and uploaded this file on the same day. I was totally speechless and deeply moved. 

Just can't thank dutch enough, I will do the same to others if I have something others need.

P. S. If anyone knows where I can find Visual Link Spanish, pls. kindly let me know. I have tried every single torrent search site I know but got nothing."
,universekkk,2009-12-01T20:14Z,"Hi Dutch, I have finished the download and this version works! You are a star! Gracias!"
,123dutch,2009-12-01T21:52Z,"Tank you VERY much for letting me know that it works now!!! :)
I am really happy to hear that!

PS: I have looked for Visual Link Spanish for you on usenet (and torrents ofcourse), but no luck... I hope you will find it!"
,123dutch,2009-12-01T21:52Z,"Thank you VERY much for letting me know that it works now!!! :)

,universekkk,2009-12-01T23:02Z,"Thanks a lot dutch! I will keep looking for the Visual Link Spanish, if I can find it one day, I will upload it here.

I have tried the lesson one of Fluenz Spanish and I absolutely love it. Hasta luego :)"
,FSSR.Keyno,2009-12-03T07:33Z,Yeah i'll buy that for a dollar! Gracias G?ey

,talal1230,2009-12-06T08:26Z,"Thanks a lot man!  Been looking for this forever.  I didn't like R.S., and this seemed quite helpful.  You are so helpful! 

By the way, is this the Fluenz Reloaded (F2), per the website?

Thanks man. "
,123dutch,2009-12-06T12:09Z,"You are welcome :)
Nope, this is the first Fluenz, not the reloaded one..."
,moeman921,2009-12-11T01:20Z,anyone else have the problem of once you start it a box Macromedia Projector has stopped working and then it shuts down? vista fwiw
,123dutch,2009-12-12T12:29Z,"Dear Moeman, I am running it on win7 without problems, also WinXP doesn't give me problems, but I haven't tried it on Vista..."
,Eggre,2009-12-15T15:05Z,"123dutch, I'm sorry to take forever to write after the download.

YES, this works!   And, YES, you are a part of the team of filesharing Gods looking after us!

Also, a working crack for Rosetta Stone's Spanish Level 4 & 5 has shown up (about three days ago)!

Thanks a bunch!  Please continue to make the the holidays -- every day -- for us!"
,123dutch,2009-12-17T08:20Z,"Thanks for letteing me knoe Eggre :)
And thanks also for pointing me out the Rosetta... I am so busy uploading here that I am not looking for new things for myself, lol...

More to come for the Hollidays... so keep on looking for posts on TPB :)"
,Eggre,2009-12-18T14:07Z,"Holy Crap!  123dutch, you're actually a Super Seeder!   I didn't know this : (    

We are not worthy!  I've checked your uploads and see that you've uploaded half the Sun in less than two weeks!

Cheers!!   You're the truth!    And it makes me happier to know that we've got people in the world like you.

Thanks a bunch!   You've made every day a holiday for a lot of us!

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you!"
,pcheese,2009-12-20T22:47Z,i'm completely new to this. What programs should be used to open this torrent?
,ALx___,2009-12-25T16:57Z,"man, ur god
thanks so much"
,ALx___,2009-12-26T07:44Z,... But there is a problem. The conversation for each lesson (which is the main part of the lesson) is missing...do you guys have this problem?
,ALx___,2009-12-26T09:28Z,"hey again, my bad, if you mount it works a treat!"
,Rokovak,2009-12-28T18:46Z,"Don't you need a registration code to use this? I have Fluenz French and even though I haven't tried using another version, I vaguely recall entering a code. "
,xsel01,2009-12-29T23:56Z,"Will this work on a Mac? If not does anyone know where a mac version can be found? 

Thanks in advance."
[T],VasiaZozulia,2009-12-30T19:19Z,"Thanks, 123dutch!"
,ednum5,2010-01-03T18:00Z,"Hey 123dutchTtanks a million! Where is the separate upload you mentioned for the audio CDs? 

Folks, it is silly to compare this to the Rosetta Stone. This is for English speakers (Americans) only. Rosetta Stone enables anyone to go from any language to any other language that is available in their software."
,outroot,2010-01-12T10:24Z,"For some reason after the conversation part of the lesson, when the lady goes to speak again, there is no sound. This happens with every lesson number."
,outroot,2010-02-04T04:59Z,"Oh. Apparently a lot of the audio files are missing surround sound. If I set my windows sound settings to stereo, I get all the sound."
,mictrmbl,2010-03-08T00:06Z,Thank you so much!!! I was shocked how easy it was to play. I mounted it and presto! Thank you.
,dare2defyy,2010-06-01T01:41Z,"Once the file is downloaded, how do you open it?"
,xeneg,2010-06-02T10:05Z,"Can the uploader or anyone tell me where I can find the French version of this progam?
Thank you."
,TopShoTTa7,2010-06-30T23:12Z,"thanks a million this is actually the rated second best language learning software out today, second to ""tell me more"", even with rosetta stone being more versatile as far as original language, it still lacks so much that it is 4th best software out..."
,turtlecove,2010-08-11T10:14Z,"Thanks 123dutch, torrent still going strong 9 months later... I'm actually a Brit leaving in Madrid and this is very much a ""Latin American"" Spanish course, but there's not so much difference between this and Castillan Spanish. This software is real user friendly and motivational!"
,maxmak,2010-08-16T06:40Z,"The first CD didn't work for me so currently I am downloading the one from this link. 2nd one seems to be working fine, but I must say I am kind of disappointed with the user interface. I wonder if such problems arise from extracting from the original source. I cant exit the program unless I open a conversation and click on the close tab on the top right. I can't change the resolution of the software and it hardly covers half the screen while staying in the middle. Why won't it install like all other softwares."
,maxmak,2010-08-16T06:48Z,"I was just clarifying my point of you, but overall I am really thankful to the fact that you have made available this wonderful software for us. I hope you also upload L3,L4,L5 of fluenz Spanish as well or if you could tell us when will they be available.

I was also wondering why I can't seem to find the 'Tell me more"" series in Spanish. It has up to 10 levels+2business levels, is it possible for you to look up this thing. I hear its the number 1 software out there followed by fluenz. So why go for 2nd best when you can have THE BEST. 

Thanks once again. you are a good man"
,maxmak,2010-08-24T04:25Z,"I am having problems with the ""Conversation"" and ""advanced conversation part"". I can't hear the woman speak to me and I can't seem to record my own voice. Any body who was able to solve this problem, please help me out as well. Thanks in advance"
,murrambingi,2010-09-04T19:39Z,"Works great, thx 4 tha upload 123dutch"
,slkmclaren,2010-10-22T10:44Z,"hello guys, im currently downloading this torrent. hopefully i will be able to finish this one in time. please seed coz i will also be seeding this torrent as long as i can.

thanks  dutch for this."
,nanna99,2010-11-08T22:50Z,"Hallo, seemed to be running fine first, but when I want to start a section always get ""director player script error continue?"" and the application is shut down, may I ask what certain media players you have running? I have Quicktime and Shockwave installed. really want to have this 500 bucks software running, thank you"
,niagaraman,2010-11-09T20:02Z,"thanks for the upload 123dutch...everything working well...cd's 1and2..

Thanks again

,blainecarbo,2012-04-25T22:47Z,"The programs down loaded without a problem, but when I start the program, after the lady explains how it works, when you move on to lesson 1, I cannot hear anything except for the music.  Can someone please help???"
,blainecarbo,2012-04-25T22:55Z,"Also on the screen it says...undefined, please help"
