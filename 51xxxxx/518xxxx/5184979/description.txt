Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original:

**************************INTRODUCTION***********************************
TCM The Beginning and TCM Remake were not that bad, but no competition to the atmosphere of the 1974 original. But still they gave the audience a more inside look into TCM and that is what brought us to the idea to create a complete Thomas Hewitt (a.k.a. Leatherface) story by taking scenes from both movies. Since the beginning really sucked, when it came to storytelling about the first Hewitt victims, these had to go completely.

***************************THE EDIT**************************************
It was very important for us to tell a believable and continuing story, so we had to erase anything that didn't make sense (like the animals in the meat factory in REMAKE, when the same factory was closed for good in THE BEGINNING) for both. Deleting them was tough work.
Next thing was to find out where the movies went over the top with gore or credibility. That is why Uncle Monty will not loose his legs in our edition. The Hewitt's are still cannibals, although there is hardly any mention of that in REMAKE, but it somehow made sense. Erin stabbing Andy was way over the top, this would never have happened in reality (friends just don't do that to each other), but we kind of solved this very sufficiently. Be surprised.
For the tension of the movie we removed the annoying and badly acted Jedidiah (the kid) almost completely from the movie and you can be sure, he won't be missed. But it is a wonderful example of editing, how we removed him from leading our two escapees from the dungeon. Unfortunately there was no room left on the DVD to include this scene as deleted scene.
Our movie is scary, gory, cruel and very dark, it is not for the faint of heart and we are not sure if this would have gained an R rating in the US.
