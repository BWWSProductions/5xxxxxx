,goldensun87,2009-11-27T04:34Z,Where have you been all this time?  Why haven't you been uploading Disney shows in the past three months?
[T],seriousmill,2009-11-27T17:37Z,LOL ive been taking a break. I should have 1-5 up soon of this season.
,goldensun87,2009-11-28T09:01Z,"Lol, I understand.  And I would appreciate you uploading all the first five s03 episodes.  There's a guy on Dejatoons IRC who encodes most of the shows you do, but he insists on making big file sizes.  Also, I hate to nag, but could you also please upload the Hannah Montana episodes that are missing?  Man, I hate to put so much pressure on you, but since WKTV group shut down, torrents of these particular Disney shows have been extremely scarce."
