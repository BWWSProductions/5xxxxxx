,abc23232,2010-06-23T03:54Z,"Hey, I downloaded/installed it perfectly. Now, I have also gotten a BUNCH of movies that I have torrented, and I want to put them to DVD's.

How do I do it, using this program?

Also, how will the quality be on a big screen TV? I don't want to burn these movies if they come out crappy.

Let me know, thanks guys!"
