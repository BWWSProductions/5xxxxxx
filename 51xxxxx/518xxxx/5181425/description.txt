The recent WinTV 7 application requires a retail CD to start installation.

I have found out that the installation does not require all the files on the retail CD, thus I removed all unnecessary files and came up with this 2MB version.

This is an ISO file, so you can either burn this to CD, or you can load it via a virtual drive program like Daemon Tools or Alcohol. I personally like the latter method so that I do not have to burn to a physical CD.

Please help to seed if you like it.
