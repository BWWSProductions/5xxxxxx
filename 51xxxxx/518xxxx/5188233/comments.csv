The album is probably worth it, but you have to spend a lot more on a decent turntable and at least a good MC cartridge to better a decent cd-rip."

Compared to the CD & 100% EAC FLAC it is quieter, it appears to have less punch and on a cursory listen seems to have less detail.

Do your own research, but CD limitations such as limited bit depth and filtering may allow brighter, louder aspects of the recording to stand out (low levels & high frequencies are lost), resulting in a false, but apparent, improvement in clarity/detail.

The CD (original German GED24433 Sub-Pop/Geffen 1989 in my case) and CD FLAC sound the same on my system (same DAC etc)

The CD appears to be well mastered, making the most of the medium. If you prefer CD to Vinyl/Blueray 24/96s, then, that's fine, modern CD players and DACs can sound pretty good, and this torrent may not be for you.

Compared to the original vinyl LP (original pristine Sub-Pop/Tupelo/Revolver English first pressing TUP-LP6 A1/B1 in my case) this sounds like an accurate copy. I must admit, I am using one of these crap ($$$) MC Ortofon cartridges too.

Frequency analysis of 'Scoff' shows frequency response up to 20kHz with the CD against 27kHz with this (unsurprisingly).

I have been listening to Bleach & Nevermind on CD since '91. As others have said, I have found the Vinyls are like hearing the music for the first time. YMMV, you will need a reasonable vinyl setup ($$$$) and an original vinyl in VG/EX cond (beware the many fake clones). Although you could always try this torrent and spend at least $$$$ on speakers to be a smug bastard like me.

ps. thanks for using such a good ext. soundcard.  There are so many 24/96s out there with less detail than the CD
