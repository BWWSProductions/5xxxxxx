,digi8boy,2010-01-19T04:04Z,Why for god's sake don't you just upload the album in FLAC?!? Leave it to the select one or two people to convert it to stupid DTS.
,ArsenoLupino,2010-01-20T04:32Z,"A DTS wav is a highly compressed audio format. Further compressing it with FLAC only saves about 10% of the size. The DTS wav (with the provided cue) can be burned as an Audio CD, which would not be possible with a FLAC. This is the standard way of packaging a DTS upmix. "
,BSteven,2010-07-31T09:16Z,"It is quite obvious that this torrent is so unpopular, even though it is the only torrent on the PirateBay of the Stereophonics most recent album, because it has been converted to DTS.

Well done."
