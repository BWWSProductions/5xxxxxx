Boyd Tyrone "Ty" Herndon (born May 2, 1962, in Meridian, Mississippi) is an American country music singer. Signed to Epic Records in 1995, Herndon made his debut that year with the Number One single "What Mattered Most", followed by the release of his first album, also entitled What Mattered Most. This album was followed one year later by Living in a Moment, which produced his second Number One country hit in its title track.

Herndon released three more albums for Epic â€” Big Hopes (1998), Steam (1999), and This Is Ty Herndon: Greatest Hits (2000) â€” although none matched the success of his first two releases, and he was dropped from Epic in 2001. He recorded a Christmas album in 2002 for the Riviera label, followed by his fifth studio album (2007's Right About Now) and a second Christmas compilation for the Titan Pyramid label.

Herndon has charted a total of 17 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. This figure includes three Number ones â€” "What Mattered Most," "Living in a Moment" and "It Must Be Love" â€” and four additional Top Ten hits: "I Want My Goodbye Back," "Loved Too Much," "A Man Holding On (To a Woman Letting Go)" and "Hands of a Working Man."

Herndon made his chart debut in early 1995 with "What Mattered Most" which went to #1 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. This song served as the title track to his debut album, which was released in April 1995 and became a top 10 country album. The song was added to 133 radio stations' playlists in its first week, breaking a record set by Tracy Lawrence. The album itself debuted at #15 on Top Country Albums and #1 on Top Heatseekers, the highest debut for a country artist since Billy Ray Cyrus' Some Gave All in 1992. In addition, it had the biggest first-week shipment in the history of Epic Records' Nashville division.

"I Want My Goodbye Back," the album's second single, peaked at #7. He won the Best New Artist Award at the 1995 Country Radio Music Awards and received various other nominations throughout the year. The album also produced two more singles: "Heart Half Empty" (a duet with Stephanie Bentley, who was also signed to Epic at the time) and "In Your Face", the latter of which failed to make Top 40. What Mattered Most was certified gold by the RIAA.

What Mattered Most is the debut album of American country music artist Ty Herndon, issued in 1995 on Epic Records. The album's title track, which was Herndon's debut single, reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in mid-1995. Other singles from the album were, in order, "I Want My Goodbye Back," "Heart Half Empty" (a duet with Stephanie Bentley) and "In Your Face."

Stephanie Kay Bentley (born April 29, 1963 in Thomasville, Georgia) is an American country music artist. She made her debut in 1996 as a duet partner on Ty Herndon's single "Heart Half Empty", which peaked at #21 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. The single was included both on Herndon's 1995 debut album What Mattered Most and on Bentley's 1996 debut album Hopechest. It produced three more singles for her on the country charts, although only one ("Who's That Girl") reached Top 40.

Bentley never recorded an album or charted a single after the release of Hopechest. However, she did find success as a songwriter, having penned Faith Hill's 1999 crossover single "Breathe", as well as Martina McBride's 2002 Top 5 hit "Concrete Angel". She has also co-written album cuts for CÃ©line Dion, Pam Tillis and Jo Dee Messina, and recorded a song to the soundtrack for the film Holes.
