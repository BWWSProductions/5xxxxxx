-------------------------------------

Many couples would do well to watch this movie. While it contains some sex, it is not a porn movie but one about deeply mental and spiritual issues in close relationships with a strong message to many couples out there. 

It took me over 2 weeks to download the entire DVD at 5-7 kB/s. Most torrents I found were dead. I'm dedicating some serious bandwidth to this now and I'll likely upload a smaller AVI version of this, too. Please download and seed - this movie is worth spreading. Could save many marriages.

Update: There's now a 850 MB .avi (xvid) file available here (English subs):

Update: Something is wrong with a few smaller files in this torrent and I seem unable to fix it. I've created a torrent for the original .iso-file, here:
