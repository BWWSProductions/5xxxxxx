,pryll,2009-11-27T15:01Z,"this is a great movie - if you have any interest in the concept of sexual healing, you should watch this."
,pryll,2009-11-27T23:54Z,"It´s the IFO and BUP´s that don´t come through - you can use IFOedit to create new ones, copy them and rename the copies BUP (since thats what they are, copies with a different name). It works."

Changing the contents of a downloaded folder will ruin the seeding, because the torrent will be considered as corrupt. To avoid that, first make a copy of the folder work only on the copy.
Even after the fix, Nero gave severe warnings when burning this DVD, and my standalone player could not use it. Nero Recode refused to handle it, as did several other programs.  I finally succeeded with ConvertXtoDVD."
,pryll,2009-11-29T18:12Z,"So you did something different then I did. I used the new files and burned it with Ashampoo. Worked like a charm. BUT - it is not possible to seed afterward since the new files is not part of the torrentfile. So yes - the torrent will be considered to be corrupt but it is burnable and playable. Or was for me. Anyway, the guy is back on tuesday."
,axs75,2009-12-01T13:59Z,"I couldn't figure out what went wrong with this torrent, sorry. I don't seem to be able to fix it, only goes to 99.9 % with some minor files missing. Instead, I've added the original .iso-file as a new torrent, here:

Hope that fixes any problems for those wanting to download the original DVD. For the 857 MB .avi (xvid) file, go here:

,pryll,2009-12-01T20:39Z,Thanx. So I will now go offline and remove my torrent. Bye.
