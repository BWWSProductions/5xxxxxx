,mudkips1997,2010-08-19T04:03Z,"ok 4 yo homeboys out there, ill teach u how to use daemon tool, lets do it step by step
1:download this torrent, if u haven't, do it now
2: extract it
3:open daemon tool,preferably to pro
4:look at the daemon tool, and find this icon that says ""ADD FILE"" if u don't see it...look harder
5:click on it
6: find the torrent u download
7:go to the ""diablo 2"" folder
8: click on diablo 2 + diablo 2(lod)
9:click on diablo 2(not lod the the regular one)
10:now, u should have 3 things
11: put everything in
12:THIS PART IS IMPORTANT SO DONT FUCK UP, go to  the device part area, right click and set how many device u want, click 3
13: now that u have 13, one by one NOT ALL ISO, just one, theres 3, so mount 1 to one device,when ur done dont mont the same one to the device that has already a mount, after that so cd1 goes to device 0, cd2 goes to device 1, cd3 goes to device 2, ok now thats done download, and update
14. if all goes right, u should have diablo 2, if not, just reply and i give u some help"

,slayerofu,2010-09-03T02:31Z,"alright, so I have the game installed, and I have disc 2 mounted which is the play disc. But it keeps telling me to insert the diablo 2 disc. I have tried mounting all the discs and it doesn't work. Anyone have any suggestions. If you suggest a cd crack could you tell me where to get one that works? I am running Windows 7 64 bit"
,imanuel2012,2010-09-14T22:29Z,"mudkips why does it just say ""make sure the cd is in and retry"" when i try to click on the game. I did everything you said step by step i used damean tools everything"
,borat304,2010-09-19T02:12Z,"I got through the installation of D2 and LoD.
I mount the expansion disk but...
When I click play diablo II : Lord of destruction it says Windows - No Disk Excpetion Procession Message...

What crap I get a cd rom drive error and if I try to mount any other of the files it gives me same no disk error but insted of cd rom error tells me to make sure I am using the expansion disk....

Well the expansion disk isn't working I'm on windows xp... I'm this close to removing and trying another torrent looks like other ppl are having the same problems as me."

,vh602,2010-11-26T17:38Z,"Finally got it to work! Thanks to xZarrz for the torrent and mudkips1997 for his walkthrough.  mudkips1997 walkthrough only takes it as far as the original Diablo II game, so I'm gonna take it a step further so you can get the expansion to run.

Follow mudkips1997 walkthrough until you get to step #12. What he means in step #12 is... at the bottom of the DAEMON tool, there is a icon of a hard drive, right click it and select ""Add SCSI Virtual Drive"" two times, so that you will end up with 3 virtual drives, with labels Device 0, Device 1, and Device 2.

Mount cd1 in Device 0, cd2 in Device 1, and cd3 in Device 2. You will get the option to install after mounting Device 0, but don't do that until all 3 devices have been mounted.

After all 3 devices have been mounted, then initiate the installation. When installation is finished unmount all the devices and go back to step #9, only this time instead of doing it for Diablo II, your going to do it for LoD.

Extract LoD and put it in Device 0. Another installation screen will pop up. Select ""Upgrade to Lord of Destruction"". When that's done, open the ""Patches"" file in the original Diablo II folder and select ""LODPatch_112a"". It will patch the game so you can run it.

And that's it. You're ready to play.

I'll be seeding for a while. Currently, the download speed is at 1.5MB and took less than a half hour."
,diablol5rfan,2010-11-29T08:51Z,"Ok i downloaded and installed and it works but when you finish act 1 and try going to act II a message pops up

,ArchangelRenzoku,2011-09-27T19:35Z,"Works great. Was able to download and play without a hitch. Game crashed on first boot, simply re-opened and was able to play.

I don't even have to play in compatibility mode on Vista32-bit. Middle mouse button doesn't work though, I forgot how to fix that from back in the day. Think it had something to do with that window-mode hack they had out back then.

Keygen hits most virusscanners as a virus, I can attest, it's virus-free. "

,plplplomg,2012-04-14T01:21Z,"Works very well, for retards:
U don't need to make 3 virtual drives, one is enough... Just look at loaded cd image name and load with deamon tools the one game asks for, one after another... Afaik third is cinematics, etc etc.. 
After u install just apply lod patch, and on windows 7 go into properties of shortcut and check box to disable compositions (which turns off aero) and terminate explorer process (ctrl shift esc) during playing so u get no funny colors alt tab back to game and after u finish playing make new task (explorer)"

,Kjvass,2012-05-17T04:17Z,"There is a key logger in this file so beware, heads up all."
,powermad0,2012-05-20T03:31Z,"The hell, keylogger? Getting suspicious here...I'm investigating this."
,powermad0,2012-05-20T03:46Z,"Alright, I investigated. It seems to me that there isn't a keylogger. I scanned all my processes thoroughly and checked for threats, and nothing was found that shouldn't be there. However, I am still running a full Malwarebytes scan. Just know that before downloading this torrent, I already had Daemon Tools installed, so I didn't use the one in this torrent. That means that if there is a keylogger, it is in the Daemon Tools installation file included in the torrent."
,andysandman,2012-05-30T18:46Z,hey daemon tools doh work on windows 7. any solutions? i tried using power iso but it saying the diablo 2 files are corrupted
