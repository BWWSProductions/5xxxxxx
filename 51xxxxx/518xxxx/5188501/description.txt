Developed by Blizzard North - Blizzard Entertainment (2000) - Isometric Action RPG - Rated Mature


After the vile demon Diablo was apparently destroyed in Diablo, be prepared for the fight of your 
life as the hellspawn is back in Diablo II. The warrior who defeated Diablo, thinking he could contain 
the demon, thrust the crystal into his own skull. Yet the overwhelming fury of the arch-demon, combined 
with the warrior's fatigue, was more than enough to overpower the helpless man. Diablo immediately 
twisted the once proud warrior's body into a walking nightmare--you must now stop this new threat.
 
By some, the first game in the Diablo series was considered limited, containing only three character 
classes, one town, and a single set of dungeons, catacombs, and twisted crypts to explore. Well, even 
the most jaded gamers won't find the same problem in Diablo II. Featuring five unique classes, several 
towns, and dungeons enough to fill four compact discs, this game is huge. Containing the massive assortment 
of weapons and armor used to wage war upon the undead in the first game--and adding loads more--you won't 
run up against a shortage of ways to mutilate, massacre, and utterly destroy your competition.
 
Once again, this newest Blizzard release includes free internet play on the company's Battle.net internet 
gaming service. But, as cheating was most likely the worst problem with playing Diablo on Battle.net, the 
team working on the sequel has taken great pains in redesigning the entire game engine from the ground up 
to eliminate the frustration in fighting unbeatable opponents. ~ Chris Couper, All Game Guide






                      Diablo II Expansion Set: Lord of Destruction
     

 Developed by Blizzard North - Blizzard Entertainment (2002) - Isometric Action RPG - Rated Mature


This expansion pack for Blizzard's well received Diablo II adds to nearly every aspect of the original 
release. In addition to the five classes offered in the basic game, the expansion allows play as a Druid 
or an Assassin, each with his or her own unique skill ladder. There are also new monsters to fight, some 
with all new styles of attack. There's more to collect in the expanded game as well, with thousands of new 
weapons and magic items, plus more room to keep them in a larger player "stash." Finally, the expansion 
includes one whole new Act, set in the Barbarian lands, to provide players with new NPC's to meet and quests 
to fulfill. Like all expansion packs, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction requires a full installation of the main 
game, Diablo II. ~ T.J. Deci, All Game Guide
