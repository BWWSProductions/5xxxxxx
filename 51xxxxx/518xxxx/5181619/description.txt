Transfers files and folders at highest possible speed between two computers over the Internet or the LAN.

The server must have a port open (forwarded). If the server is behind a firewall/router the server should use it's local IP eq 192.168.0.3.

Client types the server internet ip that can be found at whatismyip.com (on the server computer).

Always click start transfer on the server before the client!

It's an early version of the program and if you use wrong ip addresses it might crash.

If you do all steps correctly it works perfectly :)
