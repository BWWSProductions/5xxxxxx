,Saihtamen,2009-12-12T06:06Z,This version has crappy image quality. It's like watching a slightly better then usual DVDrip. Should have seen that coming with this file size.
,Redcliff008,2009-12-13T05:10Z,"Quality is solid, subs are synched, it's the highest quality rip available on the entire internet with hard subs (or even synched subtitles) and you bitch about it.

Saihtamen... congrats on being a douche."
,Saihtamen,2009-12-14T01:31Z,"It may be the best RIP of this movie, but the picture still isn't the best. As I said, it's better then a DVDrip by far. But it doesn't use the resolution good. The colors bleed a bit too much and that sharp, crisp HD-experience is just missing. There's a limit to how much information you can store on 2GB, and considering the movie is 2hours and 25min long, some quality had to be lost.

I have said nothing about the subs or the rest, only that I had expected more from the image quality. But I can agree that I did/do bitch.

Thanks for writing my nick right btw. Usually it comes out in a ham way =/

And why does it say 720p/1080p? The file is 720p."
,lbk62mz,2009-12-14T03:29Z,"the quality is good, the audio is good, thanks for the hardcoded subs, Saihtamen dont be such a bitch, if you want awesome quality get it in blu-ray.

thanks uploader"
,Saihtamen,2009-12-14T17:44Z,"=)

This bitch is still wondering why it says 720p/1080p?"
,xBYzk,2010-01-03T07:09Z,"Can somebody help me?
When i play the file in windows media, only the audio plays and no video."
,nbtnbt5,2010-01-04T03:31Z,"Wtf, the video started to frame skip and freeze during just about any part with action....."
,jbrrr,2010-01-07T07:44Z,"@Saihtamen - Do you know what a BRrip is?  

If so it's not exactly hard to understand why the title says 720p/1080p.  

The description clearly states the output resolution 1200x554 @ 1884 kb/s.  This is just like most other BluRay Re-rips from a 1080p source down to or near 720p are which are designed to play back on Xvid capable DVD players with better detail than standard DVDR (480p) resolution.

Here's a good explanation with examples: http://filesharefreak.com/2008/11/19/blu-ray-brrip-bdrip-two-new-xvid-hd-formats/"
,baradanikto2,2010-01-12T05:32Z,"""designed to play back on Xvid capable DVD players ""
Any reason why you can't burn this dld to a DVD 
due to a 'corruption' error when using Windows DVD Maker or the format won't play on DVD player for TV viewing when a DVD is burnt using Windows Media Player. The dld file seems to playback  directly on Windows Player OK. Format the problem?"
,baradanikto2,2010-01-14T04:42Z,"OK steep learning curve but decryptor, DVD shrink & imgburn did the trick"
,Superbus,2010-02-15T18:30Z,"If you have issues with skipping playback install newest K-lite codec pack and enable DXVA, (uses gpu more than cpu)"
,Superbus,2010-02-15T18:40Z,"The above is if you are just playing it as an .avi 

Excellent movie. Thanks for upload"
,RickFrenzy,2010-03-17T04:53Z,Can one of you mates repost this with english subs. You would be a friggin legend. thx
,RickFrenzy,2010-03-17T04:59Z,Can one of you mates repost this with english subs. in the dvdR section You would be a friggin legend. thx
,SKRiders,2010-03-25T02:56Z,I am just curious is this the Asia release including both parts or just the western.. Can't believe that I have never heard of this movie until now since I am addicted to the Dynasty Warrior games that are based off of this
,feruxus,2010-05-10T07:06Z,Any ideas on making this PS3 compatiable?  Media server will not.  Thanks
