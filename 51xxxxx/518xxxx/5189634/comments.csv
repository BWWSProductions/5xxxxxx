Glad to find you.
Most of the Mininova users are now at kickasstorrents(dot)com.
Hope you come join us. Your stuff is showing on their tracker now.
Like a dummy, I posted a comment thinking you uploaded it there.  It was your name in the file that threw me. Doh!"
[T],sebaygo1,2009-12-02T07:26Z,"Thanks for the heads-up!

I registered at kickasstorrents... yesterday, I think. Since the 26th when Mininova ""died"" I have been uploading at a handful of different trackers, but had intended to make TPB here sort of my base. 

Today, though, I began not being able to upload here. Every time on every torrent I get a message from the system saying I can't upload the torrent because I have it set as private. But I don't.  Nothing has changed in what I'm doing since I began uploading here.

Even if TPB is not going to be ""home,"" I still hate to not be able to upload here at all.  I know a lot of people come here looking for the kinds of things I upload and if I upload them elsewhere they never show up here... in spite of the fact that the converse is true.

Oh well, time will tell.

Thanks again."

Until a half-hour ago, I had never noticed that TPB even had a forum!
