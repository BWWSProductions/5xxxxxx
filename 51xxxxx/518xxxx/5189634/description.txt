[description from the Infowars web site]


"No guests scheduled. Alex runs down the latest news stories of importance and takes your calls."

Also included today: clips from Sunday's discussion with Charlie Sheen & Christo Garcia as well as Friday's interview with Lord Christopher Monckton.


And, in the later part of the 4th hour, Alex announced that both the PrisonPlanet Forum and article comments on Infowars are temporarily locked down [ostensibly until he can hire someone to oversee them].

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of the contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
