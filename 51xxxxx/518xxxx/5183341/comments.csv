,chamillion02,2009-11-28T00:26Z,"It would be nice if you guys left comment if the application worked for you, or maybe give a thank you!"
,death1223,2009-11-28T04:39Z,"Downloading now, Will post comment if it works."
,death1223,2009-11-28T22:10Z,"doesnt work, there is no 64-bit X-FORCE Maya one, and the serials/product keys dont work."
,death1223,2009-11-28T22:11Z,"nevermind, the 000-00000000 thing worked, haha didnt see that, but still not 64-bit x-force."
,death1223,2009-11-28T22:18Z,"installed, and patched, it starts up, but doesnt work for me, because it says my graphics card isnt good enough, but its 9600 GSO, a great graphics card, I think it is just because of my OS, Im gonna try to run it in compatibility mode."
,death1223,2009-11-28T22:22Z,"I need  fix for this error: ""Warning: Some operations are not supported by the graphics card. Please check the minimum system requirements or update your drivers. See the log file for more details."""
,chamillion02,2009-11-28T23:04Z,"@death1223

It worked for me when using Windows XP Home Edition. Maybe your OS and graphics card combination doesn't work for Mudbox 2010. I have no clue how it works for me, since I have a crappy NVidia GeForce 6100 G-card.... lol"
,death1223,2009-11-29T09:57Z,"@chamillion02

Well, Idk What to say, I can run EVERYTHING else, like completely everything, I tried 2009, doesnt work either, same error, I want to use mudbox but FCK!! :( I have horrible luck..."
,riplikethat,2009-11-30T15:43Z,"Dunno about x86 but x64 version of Mudbox 2010 is giving video issues to a lot of users (the reason why I haven't uploaded the torrent).

Autodesk hasn't bothered fixing the problem (the Video error when you click anything in viewport) yet so my advice is to stick with Mudbox 2009 x64.

There are few additions in 2010 release but it feels like they are selling a service pack (seriously, the amount of changes or ""features"" is laughable). Autodesk really needs to stop fucking around and releasing a new software to make money every fucking year only with minor additions. This is the reason why most of us end up pirating their crap (and yes, I actually used to buy Max even).

When they bought Mudbox, I was expecting a better integration in their current apps. Instead, they decided to release new version of all apps along with shitty cube wheel and interface changes to fuck it all up at one time. Their customer support is still ass btw.

My advice, stick to 2009 version unless it's Max (then 2010 is worth upgrading to)."
,charis_s,2009-12-02T18:40Z,"hi, i download the torrent, thank u so much for the torrent, i installed it perfectly fine, but when i open it and i try to work with it, it shows ""mudbox application file has stoped working, windows is searching for a solution""

is that because of my graphic card? is something wrong with the .exe of the torrent?
can please someone enlight me?
thank u!"
,otoma2136,2009-12-04T00:13Z,"I downloaded it, installed, ran it again but it's telling me the serial code is invalid. I tried the 3 you had listed and none of them worked...what do I do?"
,Zareste,2009-12-27T19:32Z,"the activation program has an outgoing connection, so you might want to block it with a firewall such as Comodo, or unplug the internet"
,Zareste,2009-12-27T20:07Z,"Well I got it to install just fine, but the program itself is pretty worthless. Pen-camera controls don't work, sculpting doesn't work. Someone send Autodesk a 'Programming for Dummies' book"
,bustbunny,2009-12-28T07:21Z,"It wont let me use the mem patch, when i click it, it says no debug and that i need to apply the patch when the license screen appears"
,xboxbreakafake,2010-01-03T17:59Z,"Dude thank you so much i have got maya 2010 and mud box both from u and i thank you xforce is easy and quick also i have not had any problems with your softwatre i know people don't comment like they should so thank you and great down loads by the way ha ha my programs work great in vista Xp and 7

,chamillion02,2010-06-30T06:32Z,Thanks to all the seeders for helping share this!
,Ordinary_Story,2010-06-30T20:14Z,Dammit!...This isn't the 64-bit version! Atleast Specify that! DICK!
,s04r35-BR,2010-08-13T20:03Z,"Thanks, works perfectly"
,winterSTU,2010-08-31T19:41Z,"Hey chamillion02 - I've gotten to the activation stage, and am using the x-force for maya 2010 - but every activation code I enter comes back with this ""Registration-Activation Error (0015.111) 
 There is a problem with the activation code that you entered. Click one of the following links.  
"" Any advice? I've tried about 20 activation codes."
,Gabo1175,2010-09-03T17:12Z,"^^ having the exact same problem ^^
any way around it guys? tried different serials and activation codes. also, mem patch won't work. i guess that could be the problem?"
,MoonDookie,2010-10-02T14:10Z,run the keygen as admin...
,handal,2010-10-26T04:59Z,"thanx for the UL.
no hassle in downloading and installing,but i'm stuck at the activation.follow the instruction(over and over again) but it's still didnt work.

sigh..tired of trying now,but i dont wanna use it just for 30 fking days  !(=_=)"
,xmm0,2010-11-07T08:25Z,"Thanks a lot man! If anyone is having trouble, try using the XF Maya 2011 keygen. That's the one that worked for me. Thanks again!"
,death2solicitors,2010-11-19T22:27Z,"Possible Solution:
Like chamillion02 mentioned make sure your system is updated. If you don't have Directx 10 the crack probably won't work. I went from v9 to v10 and everything worked right away!
Thanks chamillion!"
,vinax522,2011-01-09T11:40Z,"use serial: 000-00000000
it works! "
,MeowMix86,2011-02-24T23:50Z,"Installs fine...a bit of trouble with the keygen. But was able to open it only to receive this message:

""An unknown error has occurred while performing the operation. We are sorry for the inconvenience""

Won't let me do anything. I am forced to close Mudbox. Anyone know what this is about?"
,nabilqatar,2011-05-06T17:29Z,"Thanks alot for this....I installed it and it works, but when I start the Mudbox, and pick a basic model to start with, it give me a black model with no details...please help with this....."
