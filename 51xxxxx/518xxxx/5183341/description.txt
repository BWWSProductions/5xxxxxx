1.Install Autodesk Mudbox 2010
2.Depending on your OS and architecture you may be prompted to enter a serial for installation
  juse use 000-00000000
3.Finish the installation & restart Autodesk Product

4.Choose to Activate
5. Enter any of these serials: 666-69696969, 667-98989898, 400-45454545
6. Product Key: 498B1
5.Once at the activation screen: 
  start X-FORCE Maya 2010 (This is not a typo as there isnt an offical Mudbox keygen yet) 
  Keygen 32bits version if you are installing a 32bits application and 
  64bits if you are installing a 64bits application.
6.Click on Mem Patch (you should see successfully patched)
7.Copy the request code into the keygen and press generate
8.Now copy the activation code back to the activation screen and click Next
  YOu have a fully registered autodesk product

Again depending your OS, Architecture and previous installed product, you may be prompted to enter a serial
or a product code, in that case use 
as serial : 666-69696969, 667-98989898, 400-45454545 .. or anything matching this template
and as product code : 498B1
 

I tried every X-Force keygen for Autodesk 2010 and failed, I just happen to try the Maya 2010 
keygen and bam it worked.




NB:
1.If you want to install Mudbox 32bits in a 64bits OS, you need to use 
  the 32bits XFORCE keygen to activate your product
2.Make sure you are running the Keygen as administrator and with UAC off on Vista
  but you have to anyway to install Adesk products.
3.Make sure your system is updated with directx and other little things you may need ..
