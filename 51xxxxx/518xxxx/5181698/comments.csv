,fredd42,2009-11-27T06:42Z,How about Pathways Into Darkness?
,drwvb,2009-11-27T08:43Z,"uh fred, i never heard of that one before? Do You know the year in which it was released?"
,Jason99KR,2009-11-28T10:02Z,looks fun :)
,ScreamingDeath,2009-12-01T06:14Z,"None of the games work in this fucking thing!!! I tried all the games, and they all say REQUIRED FILES ARE MISSING.. DON'T DOWNLOAD.. ITS A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!"
,fricken64,2009-12-01T13:02Z,"This works, but as ScreamingDeath said, many games don't work. We'd be interested in the rest of your games, if they work....."
,DaCake,2009-12-02T04:16Z,"To make it work: install MAME, put the roms, artwork and sample folders in ~/library/application support/MAME OS X then (in mame) audit all the roms
After this most of them still don't work. but you can still play a number of them"
,drwvb,2009-12-02T12:53Z,"- Either You do it like DaQuake said, 
- or You set ""Preferences"" right. 
- You always have to audit them (right, daquake!)
- @Screaming death: read the f0ck1ng manual, Dude
-Okay, next time I'll add installation instructions, so *everybody* can use it. 
- You can also filter on ""good"", which removes most  non-workings, again, rtfm 
- i didn't program MAME, so don't blame me! 

You know what: I'll try to find an easier way to filter the games  for You. That Might take a while."
,drwvb,2009-12-02T15:42Z,Added install instructions
,Arnelon,2012-05-19T11:03Z,Thanks man :D
