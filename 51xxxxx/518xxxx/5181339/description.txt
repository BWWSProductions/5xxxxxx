...."Red, Black & White" was recorded in May 2006 at Blue Room Studios (Rosario City), including 10 songs, 7 of whom are completely in spanish. It was mixed by Billie Gomez, with input from the rest of the band, and mastered in Buenos Aires by Gustavo Fourcade and Billie at "Steps Ahead Studio." Crude and direct sound characterizes this album, with lyrics that relate urban reality, trying to rescue the strength and attitude from many groups of 70's and 80's, as well as more contemporary bands that have influenced ATH..s music.
