    You might have seen a FLT release of this game before, which turned out

    to be just another beta. A few examples of differences for files that do

    not have the same date and/or content (from both cds and installdir):

    That all proves that FLT's release was a definite beta (i.e. a copy for a 

    magazine (p)review) and not a store final. [BTW, we recommend that a certain 

    FLT person takes a closer look at the cgamex86.dll on his beta cd.]

    

    Lately we have seen a number of newbies and dumb biased scene nukers asking

    why DEViANCE even bother to release finals for games that have been 

    released as late betas by other groups. We couldn't say it better than our

    competition themselves have done, as quoted from an nfo for a game that 

    FLT put the US-store final out for (Final Fantasy 8):

        

    "So here you have the full FINAL version of this Huge game and Error free 

     Bins, Killing two birds with One Stone. The purpose of the ISO scene is 

     to share images of store final CDS, the same product that would be sold 

     as retail in a software shop. Otherwise we risk problems of update patches 

     not working correctly."

     

    We would welcome if all groups aimed to uphold quality in the iso-releasing 

    scene - and that means that groups do not release betas intentionally and 

    that they do not release versions of games of which they are not sure if 

    they are really final. Mistakes in judging what is final and what is beta 

    can of course happen and have happened to us in the past as well.



    But we in DEViANCE believe that it is not acceptable when iso-groups like 

    FLT release betas in almost regular short intervals. We can only hope that 

    our competition in FLT will finally learn that reviewers' copies on gold 

    cdrs are almost never the final versions of a game - and definitely not 

    worthwhile iso releases.

    

    If you prefer betas, do not leech this release.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    of Honor: Allied Assault gives you a sense of the courage it took to

    through the heavily defended border of Germany itself to take the

    bridge at Remagen. You assume the role of Lt. Mike Powell, member of

    You think you can contribute to the scene too? You have one or more

    talents in:

    

    - supplying NEW unreleased games (maybe you work at a game/util

      magazine, courier delivery firm, newspaper, game press/marketing

      company, distributor, publisher, duplicator, tv/radio show, shop, 

      warehouse, store etc.) You do not need a fast internet connection

      for the above!

    

    - supplying unreleased NEW store/shop games & have a fast UPLOAD

      300k+ internet connection and time to spare on weekday mornings.

      Of course we shall reimburse you for the costs of the games you

      buy.

    

    - you are a coder with lots of experience in Debugging/ASM & C/C++.

      You also can code your OWN tools to automatically remove

      commercial iso protections like the latest versions of any of the

      following: SafeDisc or Securom or TAGES or VOB or Laserlok or

      Copylok. Using tools created by others does NOT count and we

      check! You will also need advanced knowledge of PE File Formats.

 

    - you are a Unix guru with good ansi-c software developing knowledge

      and understanding how to prevent network security vulnerabilities.

      That means you must be able to code to ansi-c guru level. And you

      must also have a good coder perspective of hostbase and network

      based intrusion detection systems. You should be able to code tools

      to generically prevent stack and heap buffer overflows on unix in

      Ansi-c. And Be able to code tools to look after a group of systems

      and code sniffing avoidance tools. And you can configure a system 

      in ways to prevent packet sniffers and "man in the middle" attacks.

      No window's lamers ;p   



    - supplying linux/BSD eggdrop/bnc shells to the group (for free).

      They should have 2mbit MINIMUM link. We shall require flexible

      control over the shell. Root access on the box with dynamic

      ident such as midentd for bncs, but just normal shell accounts

      are fine for eggdrop shells. All boxes must have legitimate

      IP's, they should not be running NAT or a firewalling system

      that will constantly interfere with the link. Ideal shells will

      have multiple vhosts, reasonably good uptime (20+ days), and a

      low system load. Public shells such as JEAH.NET or similar with

      25+ load averages and 3 day uptimes are not acceptable. The more

      reverse ips you have the better. We are only interested in LEGIT,

      NON-HACKED/CARDED shells. These shells will be used only for the

      purposes listed above and will NOT be used for any kind of

      'dump site' or for spreading any kind of releases. We are NOT

      interested in modem, cable, or DSL shells. The shells should be

      up 24/7 with minimum downtime for upgrades, etc and should not be

      overloaded with processes.



    - If you know the difference between reindexing and unpacking

      large files. Or if you can identify ANY major file formats by

      looking at the hex byte code of the header. Or if you can tell

      and show the difference between MPQ & HAPI.

      And can code your own tools to rip apart the above technologies

      (to show you fully understand them) then apply at once.



    - making trainers for newly released games (menu driven, must work

      in Win9x and Win2K/WinXP).
