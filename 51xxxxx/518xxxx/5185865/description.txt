== a Red Ice Creations interview; 22 October 2009 ==



[description from Red Ice Radio]


"We discuss the Origins and the Symbolism of the European Union with David Icke. The EU is the reemergence of the (Holy) Roman Empire. We talk about the Catholic/Vatican influences in the EU and the Royals, especially the Hapsburgs, who are behind its inception. We talk about Religious Symbolism and the Babylonian/Sumerian Origins of those Symbols. Where is the EU heading with the Lisbon Treaty? "

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
