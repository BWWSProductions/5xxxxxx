This is a very interesting band; first band of Perry Farrell (later Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party). The band released only two EPs. Their stuff is really hard to come by and is extremely expensive, fetching between $3,000 and $10,000! I know it sounds insane but that only goes to show that torrents are such great cultural tools.
