,Em3rald,2009-12-06T02:43Z,"This file does not seem to play very well.  VLC is telling me there are errors, and AVIdemux is telling me it had to rebuild the time map and a number of other issues.  Without repairs, will not play past 1 minute in VLC, nor Totem, nor in my new LG DivX Player.  Net result?  I am going to download a different one and try it."

@crazyone1981: I'm pretty new at this too but I get many triple digit kB/s downloads by setting uTorrent to the following:
Connection/Maximum (Both upload and download) rate set to ""0"" ""unlimited""
BitTirrent/Global Maximum .... : 5000
BitTirrent/Maximum..... peers per torrent: 500
BitTirrent/Upload slots ........ : 10

Hope it helps."
