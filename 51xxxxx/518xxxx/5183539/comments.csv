Compare the violins here to the Chamberlin violins from Mike Pinder's set. The classic mellotron violins were actually a lo-fi copy of the Chamberlin violins. These new remastered samples sound even cleaner and clearer.

And you know what? I think maybe these samples sound too good. I definitely want to explore them more, but I think there will be times when I reach for the Mike Pinder samples for that vintage sound."

Peace."
