Blowing is more open and relaxed this time, maybe Hawes was tackling the style du jour or he was just in a more somber mood, at any rate the playing is superb throughout - he even enters pop territory exploring Burt Bacharach's "This Guy's in Love with You" in his own, unique way.  And lest I forget, we have the added bonus of Dexter Gordon joining in for some serious chops exchange on the aptly named blues Dexter's Deck.
