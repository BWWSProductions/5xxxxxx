80 Minute Show of Boat music for my buddy Colin.
Taken from the "Party on the Patio Show" with "ALLNIGHT ESQUIRE" AND "WALTER SCOTT JAMES" from Summer of 2006.
I do have one more show from these guys,plus a number of their OLD SCHOOL DANCE SHOWS. 
Let me know how this works for you.
BOB.

This 24 tracks edited to fit an 80 minute CD. Do not gap the tracks.
I did at one time have part 2 of this Show, but can not find right now. Was a three hour show with all commericals removed to fit a CD.
Great summer fun.
Enjoy Colin, hope to hear it on the boat next summer.
