The keygen is a Super-Trojan, pegged the virustotal scan at 37/41 http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/39c8cd58072d71ad0f9371b0f6fc720724450ae87f7d6c79a2a42f1d08d0eb9e-1259004851 - you can even run it if you have any anti-virus installed. So setup an unscanned directory and run it sandboxed. This didn't work on Win2003 but worked on Win2000 (didn't try Win7 and Vista sucks). "
