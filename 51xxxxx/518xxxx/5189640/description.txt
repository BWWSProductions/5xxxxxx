                              Everyones a hater. 
                       
                     There has been a DVD SHRINK copy floating around. 
                    It includes both WS/FS and both audios and still     
                            comes in at 4.35gb. The DVD9 is far bigger than
                         that and this encode comes from that. We have included
                     a jpg of the disc scan and the DVD9 folder. Enjoy!
