        Setup Factory 8 is the result of over a decade of experience in
          creating software installation tools. Unlike other installer
        builders that require week-long training courses in order to get
         up to speed, Setup Factory was designed to be fast and easy to
          use. By pairing a visual layout of your software's files and
          folders with a point-and-click interface, the entire process
              becomes completely logical and absolutely painless.

           What's more, Setup Factory creates a compact, single-file
         setup.exe that runs on any version of Windows from 95 to Vista
        (and above) and is perfect for distribution by Web download, CD 
                             -ROM, DVD-ROM and LAN.
