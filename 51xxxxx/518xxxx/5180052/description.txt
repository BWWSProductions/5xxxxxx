The Heart to Heart 

A liver arrives at Chicago Hope---intended for a patient who needs a heart-lung transplant immediately. What to do? Alberghetti has heard of a radical procedure developed by a Sri Lankan surgeon. It is radical, but it has worked on goats and besides, there are no other options. Nor is there a surgeon on hand who knows how to perform it. Meanwhile, details are shared about Hanlon and McNeils' first date - a complete disaster.
