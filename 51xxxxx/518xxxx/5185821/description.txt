[sebaygo1]



Webster this week kicks things off with commentary on Obama's leaked plan to escalate the Afghan conflict by sending in 35,000 more troops.  Webster also points out the need for the peace  movement to come out of their coma and have a massive turnout for the December 12 Washington D.C. protest.  Then it's on to the climate change swindle and the China/India situation.


In the second hour is the weekly update by Phil Berg [obamacrimes.com] on the Obama birth certification issue.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
