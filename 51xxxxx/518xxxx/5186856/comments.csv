,qwertybnm,2011-05-08T10:52Z,"a_wf - As Maaurice said above, the torrent itself isn't a cracked version. You have to download a cracked copy of the exe file and replace it after you install the torrent. The copy Maaurice linked to worked great for me.

So: 
1)Download the torrent
2)Download the crack
3)Mount the torrent using Poweriso or Alcohol; or burn it to a dvd and run the dvd.
4)From the DVD or virtual DVD, run Autorun.exe; the program installs.
5)Now take the Robertcollins.exe file from the crack download, and drop that it your PROGRAM FILES/LE ROBERT/THE ROBERT COLLINS FRENCH DICTIONARY folder, replacing the version of robertcollins.exe that you already have in that folder.

6)Voila, vous allez parlez francais comme ca."
