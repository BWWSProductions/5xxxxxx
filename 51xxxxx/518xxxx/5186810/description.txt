- COMPLETE SHOW Recorded Live From the Mixing Desk -


Great show all the way around. You can hear the mixer messing around with the sound
quite a bit throughout the whole show. It is not real distracting or anything. He seems to
finally get it right towards the end of Honky Tonk Women through the rest of the show.
You really get a chance to hear the Stones exactly how they sound. Very little to no crowd
noise at all during some of the tunes. Some tracks sound further away and some sound
closer. With the further away sounding ones, you can really tell they are in a dome
stadiumâ€¦ ish. I saw this tour at both an outdoor stadium and an indoor stadium. Believe
me, the outdoor shows are much better. Anyway, check it out because it is a good show.
Hope you enjoy!
The last two tracks on disc 2 are from the â€™94 MTV Music Awards. They are two very solid
performances, sound good and are a very nice fit to complete this boot.
