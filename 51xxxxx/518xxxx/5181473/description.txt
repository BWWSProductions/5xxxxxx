Secrets of the Dead: Mumbai Massacre (2009)

Mumbai, November 26, 2008. What began as a typical day in a buzzing cosmopolitan city devolved into a nightmare of explosions, gunfire and death when terrorists attacked. The world watched in horror as the escalating violence was broadcast live across the globe. But within the walls of the besieged hotels, a social networking revolution was taking place. Even as the terrorists watched CNN to find out where their victims were hiding, the prisoners were texting with terrorism experts, passing information to specially set up user groups, and even searching the web for plans of the buildings to coordinate their escapes.

Told completely from the victims' perspective using their own words, voicemails, texts, and user-group postings, this program places viewers inside the deadly cat and mouse game as it played out. It captures the desperation and courage of ordinary people in the face of extraordinary events, and explores how social media became a survival tool and a witness to the violence and horror.
