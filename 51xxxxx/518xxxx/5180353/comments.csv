At the end of this week I am stepping down from the gordsmash title and giving it to my pal. I want to thank everyone for supporting gordsmash and uploading my torrents to keep them alive! I hoped that everyone of you has enjoyed my torrents! I want to thank all of you for supporting me! Thank you all and goodbye!"
,seikogb2,2010-04-20T20:05Z,"i'd just like to point out that this pdf is secured.. so you can read it on the screen but cannot print it out. I wanted to, so 5 mins of googling and 1 tpb search brought up this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4788636/PDF.Password.Remover.3.0 which worked perfectly.. just to help other people :)"

,Pirate-Bean,2010-10-11T16:16Z,"If you want to learn how to program in Java, you shouldn't use this guide. It's pretty simple, and they keep the language on a level even a child can understand, but it's not that good. Instead, go get the book Objects first with Java: http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/ can also be ""found"" as a .pdf file somewhere. :)"
