I just saw a screening of Sion Sono's Love Exposure and immediately went online looking for a DVDR only to be sadly disappointed.
Any chance of you upping some of his films? (particularly some of ultra impossible to find in America titles like Bicycle Sighs, Into A Dream, Hazard, and Be Sure to Share, etc.)

Either way, keep up the amazing selection and thank you as always for your dedication!"
