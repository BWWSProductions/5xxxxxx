James Morrison Undiscovered(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
________________________________________________

By the time James Morrison's debut, UNDISCOVERED, was released in the 
United States in 2007, the singer-songwriter was already a hot commodity 
in his native England. 

Morrison's sound lives somewhere between the classic soul of Al Green and 
Stevie Wonder, and more folk-oriented artists like James Taylor (not to 
mention contemporaries like James Blunt and John Mayer). 

As a result, UNDISCOVERED has a definite retro feel, yet it still manages 
to sound contemporary in its approach and production. A mere 21 years old 
at the time of this album's release, Morrison proves here that he's an 
artist to keep an eye on as he develops and matures.

The 21-year-old presents a spellbinding collection of raw, bittersweet and
bluesy soulful songs. 

His voice evokes shades of Rev. Al Green and the late Otis Redding,
remarkable for a blue-eyed Englishman imbuing his material with a genuine 
passion and raw emotion that is honest and inspirational. He comes from a 
less fortunate background and taught himself to sing and play guitar from
age 5 and has more than enough experience to provide material for this 
outstanding debut. 

Martin Terefe sat in the producer's chair (known for his work with 
KT Tunstall, Ed Harcourt and Ron Sexsmith).
