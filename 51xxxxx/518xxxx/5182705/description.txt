The first adventure featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace and his quiet but smart dog Gromit.

One night, Wallace and Gromit are pondering where to go for the upcoming bank holiday. Wallace gets up to prepare tea with cheese and crackers, only to discover they are out of cheese. Making the most of their situation, Wallace decides they should go somewhere where there is plenty of cheese, ultimately choosing to go to the moon, since "everyone knows the moon is made of cheese." The two build a moon rocket in their basement, complete with easy chairs and a wallpapered cabin. Once the two complete packing provisions for the journey, Wallace lights the rocket's fuse.


Wallace ja GromitÂ´i esimene animatsioon, kus nad lÃ¤hevad kuu peale juustu otsima.
