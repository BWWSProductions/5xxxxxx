,EnemyDrone,2009-11-27T14:52Z,Someone comment is this the theater version or the orginal cut?
[T],jerry7_57,2009-11-27T15:29Z,"It's not the theatrical release, it's the screener we have already got."
[V],neon,2009-11-27T15:31Z,"3 reasons why im guessing this is the 2007 version 
1-imagine group released the 2007 screener
2-extremezone has not uploaded this movie before
3-if this was the 2009 version im sure he would put it in the heading or say in comments

i could be wrong"

,TheobaldDancelot,2009-11-29T03:30Z,"excellent film thanks for the upload. quality is not the best but its ok. 

but it is a remarkable film. i'm fuckin sick of hollywood cgi bullshit and the titillation but lack of tit in todays usual films.
this film is pure gold though and works in a very old skool way.

i really regret watching this at home on my computer though. i should have waited for the cinema, and eaten a 1/4 oz of cannabis beforehand.
plus the cinema version coming has shit that's not in this copy..according to the good people above me here^^

i recommend waiting for the cinema..then downloading this

,isisx3,2010-02-10T01:05Z,"The maker of this movie never claimed it was based on a true story, notice how it doesn't, at all, ever, say, ""based on a true story"" or any thing like that. It thanks some police station for images but it does NOT say it was based on a true story. The director also says it wasn't. This movie was filmed in a week and edited in another week and published in an indie movie fest in 2007 where it started gaining publicity. 2 years later it was released in some movie theaters across the US and a couple weeks later released all across the US. 

I personally think this is a really good movie, first half is sort of boring but the second half is amaaazing.


Definitely worth watching.


--this is the one with the ending where the door slams shut and startles the police and they kill her.


thanks extremezone."

But that doesn't make it a good movie! Everyone who I talked with about this movie said that it was 'sooooo scary', and when I said that it didn't scare me at all, they come back at me with 'yeah but they made it in like a few weeks with a low budget'. And then I just laugh at them and change the subject.. How does a low budget and little time make a movie good? God! I can't get it into my head..

This movie wasn't actually all that bad. So to any1 who hasnt seen it. Dont read the rest of the comments coz they contain spoilers and watch it. If you are bored easily unless a car blows up every 2 min then dont watch. But if you like story n don't mind a plot watch it. Im not gonna say its hugely scary but it makes u think about walking through ur house in the dark for the next 2 nights or so.
