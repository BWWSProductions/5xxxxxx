,uzielvb,2009-12-13T00:14Z,"after windows update it didn't work anymore (""not installed for the current user""), i had to replace the mso.dll again. i hope it will work now forever. i didn't know i had to disable the update."
,hussey12,2009-12-18T17:38Z,thnx mate wrks fr now
,arman-h,2010-01-19T22:46Z,"badbader88, what do u mean ""it doesn't ask to replace anything""?!!!!!!!!!!!

In Windows 7 go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\OFFICE12

than delete the original MSO.DLL and copy the MSO.DLL from this torrent there

follow the other steps...

It works 100%

many thx to hwate12, u r great :-)"

,ben8996,2010-03-08T15:12Z,"Windows 7
 microsoft home and office 2007 files in directory
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE12\

msoshext.dll
MSOXEV.DLL
MSOXMLED.EXE
MSOXMLMF.DLL


their is now MS0.dll to replace. I could rename one of these origonal MS0x*.* files to the file name the activation guidelines suggest, but which one.  does this really work for windows 7?"

,DarkHorseDre,2010-05-27T01:56Z,"Awesome, thanks!

To clarify, the guide says: C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\OFFICE12 

but for Windows 7 64 bit systems, the folder is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\OFFICE12"

,soth037f,2011-05-23T19:01Z,"Thank you very much. I actually bought this damn program years ago off the net and lost my key in my last move. 

Tried to access my digital locker, oh sorry we no longer support that. MS had deleted my old widows live account and no longer uses the locker. 

Tech support is complete fail, all they wanted to do was sell me 2010.

Microsoft solution = buy it again :( . Pirate solution = download key and crack + tell Microsoft to sit on it :). MS can kiss my ass, never wasting my $$$ on them again."
