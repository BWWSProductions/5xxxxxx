,sathanas6,2009-12-02T07:33Z,Anyone interested in version 3.1? I am now using it. It's the same as this but with the very latest Windows updates added. I will also be releasing Office 2003 SP3 with updates through December 1st 2009 integrated.
,jimmybrock,2009-12-05T10:56Z,any idea what the serial number is as it is asking me for it half way through setup ??
,Bob__Dole,2009-12-06T03:20Z,"Note that the ""Copy To"" / ""Move To"" shell extension can cause a bug.  When you double-click on an menu item in your start menu it is supposed to open, but does something else (like try to move it?) in some cases when Copy/Move To is enabled as an Explorer shell extension."
,sathanas6,2009-12-07T04:08Z,"jimmybrock, if it is asking for a license key, it did not preactivate. Either your system is not a supported OEM or the preactivation failed. You will need to use the crack provided. Read the instructions."
,sathanas6,2009-12-07T04:12Z,"Bob_Dole, I have been using the shell extension for 18 months on over 100 PCs, and have not encountered the issue you are describing. Why do you think it is caused by the shell extension? Are you personally experiencing this issue or merely forwarding information? If you are experiencing it, would you be more specific? What are you double clicking, and what happens as a result?"
,TehPeliCANMan,2009-12-24T02:25Z,"So to delete my partition I use a program like Partition Wizard and just select delete? If so then I'm all set! Sweet torrent can't wait to use it! Can I run it on a virtual disk drive? I guess thats a stupid question, but I just want to make sure."
,TehPeliCANMan,2009-12-24T02:27Z,"Sorry but I left out a question XD. Sorry I'm a newb. Upon booting with the new XP, will the PC have its factroy settings so that its new? "
,CEDR777,2010-01-08T17:19Z,"i have some issues with this, when i tried to boot with this CD to install a fresh copy of windows, after a few restarts the device manager and some other tools fails to run properly, it shows an mmc.exe error, and when i right click any file then i get to ""Send To..."" my pc crashes, i don't know if it's just me, but i think this mo is unstable."
,sathanas6,2010-01-20T08:59Z,"Sorry, I have been busy lately. It isn't necessary to use a 3rd party partition manager to delete the old partition. That can be done easily from within the initial Windows XP install blue screen. This disk is custom, so no, factory settings will not be restored. It does allow for factory pre-activation, but will not return any PC to it's factory state, nor should you want it to. Restoring to factory means old outdated apps and drivers and lack of latest updates. CEDR777, I have not encountered the problem you are describing. Did you burn the disk at 4X? Have you tested your hard drive for bad sectors? Is it possible you have been infected with malware?"
,sathanas6,2010-01-24T06:29Z,"I am not sure if anyone else has this problem, but I was unable to install this KB978207 update for IE7 XP. It may only be due to the slipstreamed nature of the IE7 hotfixes in my custom XPawesome 3.1 install DVD. If anyone else has this problem, the solution is simple. Close IE7, browse to C\Windows\System32 and delete iepeers.dll. Then restart IE7 and go ahead with the update."
,sathanas6,2010-03-04T13:22Z,4.0 is coming soon.
,sathanas6,2010-03-09T12:43Z,Version 4.0 is now available here----------->http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5422706/XPAwesome4.0_CDROM
,sathanas6,2010-03-10T06:33Z,The XPAwesome 4.0 DVD.ISO with multi-OEM preactivation and integrated driverpack installation has been completed and tested. I will make the torrent and upload tomorrow. It is gooood.
