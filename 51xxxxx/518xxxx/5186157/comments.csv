,eagleray1079,2011-07-31T01:44Z,can this work with windows?
,Sonofthespiralshop,2011-12-24T04:35Z,"Ok, everything downloaded fine with no asking for passwords or codes. But, error message says it won't install Print Shop without Art CD, then when I try installing Art CD it says Print Shop application not found. Please post if I have to burn these onto a CD first or not.

,Sonofthespiralshop,2011-12-29T02:45Z,"Disregard previous comment about installation error messages, I fingered it out. When you unpack the installers do the Print Shop Installer FIRST, Art CD second. Be sure to NOT check ""Install Art CD"".

When Print Shop 2 is all installed, then go ahead and install Art CD. 

If you do this procedure wrong the remedy is to delete installers and start over by unpacking the files again.

Working great, thank you!"
