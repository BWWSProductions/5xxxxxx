This is FINAL FANTASY VIII (8)
Working, tested, and played many times.

Works on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. Zero problems, zero errors at all. Never crashes.

System Specifications used:

Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit Edition and Windows XP-Home 32bit
Intel Quadcore Q8200 @ 2.33ghz
NVidia Geforce 9500GT DDR2 1GB
4GB DDR2 RAM

NOTE:

Before starting the game BE SURE to go to FF8Config (after installation) and select
GRAPHICS>Software Renderer (NOT HARDWARE, as this will create boxxy pixels on the game.) You may also select Hi-res Fonts, makes the game look better. 

Post comments or questions if you need help.

Download and Seed!

Mount with Daemon Tools/Alcohol or Burn directly to DVD.

Edit: At the end of each disc, it will ask for the next disc. No problem, exit out of the game (ctrl+alt+del) then open the game again, starting from transitioning save.
