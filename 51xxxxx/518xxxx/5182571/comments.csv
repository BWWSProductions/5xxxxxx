I have the same black screen issue after NEW GAME.

I followed all the instructions, installed SFX to either main or other folder as well as moved cracked ff8.exe to orher folder. Nothing helps, not at all. I have Direct X 11 and run ff8 as administrator.

Can you (successful with this problem people) describe whole process with more details? What do we have in common that this issue appeared?

For anyone who can help me I'm writing about my PC: it's Dell Mini 10v, Intel Atom 1,6 GHz, Intel GMA 950 (64 MB Ram), 1 GB Ram, running Windows 7 Professional.

,ArchangelEhlana,2009-12-23T19:16Z,"Hi,

I was so excited to play the game after the download... but I've got that black screen problem after ""New Game""

I hope you can help me. I'll try to describe my steps.

1. downloaded the game, burned on dvd. 
2. Installed
3. Copied Crack into the ordner and overwrited the old datas
4. After I clicked on ""SFX"" - there was just a noise out of FF8 but nothing happend. 

5. If I click on ""New Game"" comes a error from windows that it is not working.

Makes me completly sad :( I really do hope, that you can help me!"

-Install FFVIII first
-Install SFX in the Finall Fantasy VIII folder just created
-Copy the crack and replace the files in the Final Fantasy VIII folder
-Open FF8Config and select software renderer and hi-res fonts
-Right click FF8 app and open as administrator

Everything seems to be working fine now, but haven't got too far yet."
,kwapao,2010-01-08T07:57Z,"First of, I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate x64. I found out how to fix the ""New Game"" Crash. When you install the game it will install in the x86 folder of the program files. Next, when you install the SFX, you will notice the default directory isn't the x86. You have to manually direct it to the folder where you installed FF8 which is ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Eidos Interactive\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII"""
,Mountaintroll,2010-01-09T11:59Z,Got the game installed and working and was very pleased.  However right when the scene finishes before I go to take the SeeD exam the game crashes.  any suggestions or has anyone else had similar problems?
,201131181,2010-01-11T01:13Z,"Here's how I did it.

1. Mount FINAL_F_VIII.iso using Daemon Tools
A menu should pop up
2. Install FFVIII
3. Install SFX
4. Replace files in crack to the ones in your FFVIII directory (Directory should be C:/Program Files/Eidos Interactive/Square Soft ,Inc/FINAL FANTASY VIII
5. Run FF8 Config, change Renderer from Direct3D To Software renderer and add Hi Res Fonts if you want.

It should work then. I haven't got to Disc 2 yet, so if that asks you for a disc (which it shouldn't due to the crack) then do this... 

1. Find the files DISC2.pak, DISK2 and FIELD.FI, FIELD.FS, FIELD.FL and FIELD2.FS files. They should be in your FF8 directory after you Installed SFX in the DVD menu.
2. Burn them to a CD
3. Do the same for Disc 3 and 4 if required, just change DISC2.pak and DISK2 to 3 or 4 dependant on the CD.

Usually mounting the DVD itself allows you to play Disc 1 without the need to Burn the DISC1.pak, DISK1 and Field files to a CD. I have tried 2 other FFVIII games on TPB and they are the same.

Also, with the other 2 versions, they both crash some point on Disc 3, if you have that problem I have a fix on that too. But it should be fine."
,xxx_11_raphael_11_xxx,2010-01-13T12:55Z,please insert disc 1.... how can i insert disc 1?? can somebody help me?? please..
,jack6251,2010-01-14T14:26Z,"I've installed the game no trouble at all using Daemon tools. Managed to apply the crack, but I'm also getting the Insert Disc 1 message after hitting New Game.

I've tried everything everyone here has suggested, the ctrl+alt+del, regedit and even looked for the DISC2.pak etc from the download, and it doesn't appear to be there included in the download after opening the downloaded FF8 file from here with Isobuster, which allows you to view all the files that can be mounted.

If discs 2, 3 and 4 are included in the torrent that's downloaded, shouldn't it automatically carry on loading through Disc 1, 2, 3 and 4 once in game on hitting an in game key?

As I say, I've followed everything posted and it's still not continuing to recognise that Disc 1 is there, even though the file from this download torrent is mounted and all the cracks etc are in place."
,jack6251,2010-01-14T15:02Z,"Ok, scratch everything in my previous message. I just followed the bulletpoint advice from Stormblast115's comments on page 2 of these comments and it's worked fine. I've been able to bypass the whole messing about with Disc 1 etc. It seems the the DISC2.pak info is contained in a compressed file that is actually included in the download from the torrent, it doesn't appear at first glance using Isobuster or another similar programe. Instead once you have installed FF8, also select instal SFX, this is the key to getting it to work along with the crack etc.

I think previous comments from people with Disc 1 trouble probably made the same oversight as me, if you only selected instal game and not instal SFX also, from the popup menu that appears after immediate mounting, you'll probably have the same trouble I did.

Just follow what Stormblast put, thanks for that! :)

Thanks for the game too Killerhaze! :)"
,jack6251,2010-01-14T15:09Z,"Ok, scratch everything from my previous comments. I've just followed the bullet point advice from Stormbals115 on page 2 of the comments and it's worked ok, meaning I bypassed the whole Disc 1 trouble.

I think what I did was, I never selected Instal SFX after installing the game. After mounting in Daemon tools (or whatever), there'll be the popup installation menu, from there, select Instal SFX after you've installed the game. That's where the other data discs are (I think). You won't be able to see DISC2.pak info either by using Isobuster etc as it's contained within a compressed file within the downloaded data from this torrent, but installing SFX unpacks it into the game folder and it's run ok.

Also, on installing the game, I selected/checked, the instal additional game information in the instalation process (the middle of the 3 boxes in one of the installation menu screens), but I don't know how relevant this is.

Anyway, thanks to Stormblast for his comment! :)

Thanks too to Killerhaze for the game! :)"

,kenoy21,2010-01-16T09:39Z,"Hey everyone i think i got the solution for those people who are following the comments and are still not getting it to work. i installed the game, then the sx thingy (if it makes a sound and does nothing explore the mounted image and copy the sfx install (the largest file) to where you installed the game). i played it and then got the disk one error. i copied both patches over the original files then played the game and got the black screen crash. the key to making it work was to right click the ff8.exe and click ""run as administrator"" and then it should work perfectly, just make sure that it you have changed the config like everyone before me has said. this is all on vista

hope this helps"
,jack6251,2010-01-16T12:37Z,"Yeah I forgot to mention, mine is on Vista and is running perfectly since I posted my last comments. I've done a lot of battles and I'm moving into the whole FF8 story nicely now.

Just make sure to instal the SFX option too after installing the game, then mount :)"
,munki17,2010-01-17T21:59Z,"Hey i wanted to comment because this thread under the Torrent helped me out alot (after many tries and tweaks)

i am running windows 7, have a pretty damn good setup, although idk exactly what it is.


I installed the game under C, using PowerISO. Just mounted it on E, then installed it. straightforward enough for an average joe like me with a little comp knowledge.

I copied the crack, making sure it was under my (X86) program files not the regular one

I installed the SFX once again making sure it was in my x86, because i did not do it the first time there, it was in the non x86, and it caused the ""Black Screen Error"" i see so much here in the thread.

Once i got that done, game started, I'm in. YES!

HOWEVEr, the game ran extreeeeemely slowly. If you have this problem like me, what i did was run it in compatability mode for Windows 98/ME because that was what it was designed for. I also checked the boxes, run in 640x480 full screen and 256 colors or whatnot.  Then i checked ""Run as Administrator"" which i have found is very important with your secure programs in windows 7.

Then, started up, noticing it was much faster. Game ran smoothly, took me 4 days of downloading Playstation emulators, finding out it was also a PC game, finding this torrent, downloading, seeding, installing, frustration. But i got it and i hope this comment helps someone else, because alot of these helped me. Thanks all and have fun playing this kick ass game we played when we were kids!"

any help?"
,Aske81,2010-02-08T13:03Z,"I've now got this to work after several attempts...

Here's what to do:

1:Mount with deamon tools 
(Install screen should pop up, if not double click on your virtual drive you mounted it in)

2:Install game......
 when you come to the select components screen, make sure you leave the optional game data unchecked... 
(Do not Update)

3:Install SFX

4:Crack it (copy the binkw32.dll and the ff8.exe to:
 C:/ProgramFiles/EidosInteractive/Square Soft, Inc/FINAL FANTASY VIII, paste and replace)

5:Open up your FF8 config(run as administrator)

go to graphics tab, change the renderer from Direct 3D hardware renderer to software render
and check the box for ""Use High Res Fonts"" hit OK

6:Open up Regedit(Go start, all programs, accessories,run....) once you got that up, type:

regedit

For those of you who are new to regedit, simply browse through the following folders on the left side in this order:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
SOFTWARE
Square Soft, Inc
FINAL FANTASY VIII
1.00

On the right side you should now see a string value labeled "" DataDrive"" with an icon ""ab"" on it

Right click

Modify

In the field marked ""Value Data"" it would probably say something like c:

You need to change this to whatever drive you installed FF8 with. 

It would be one of the virtual drives since we used deamon tools... Go to my computer and check the name of your virtual drive that ff8 are inserted in..... mine is H: at the moment. 

Type in(Capital letter) H:(or whatever you drive is) in your ""Valuedata"" and hit ok..... 

close regedit

This should fix the black screen and insert cd 1 problem... 

Now run your game as an administrator and you should be good to kick some ass

Hope this helps

-Cheers-

,isildour15,2010-02-10T05:57Z,"couldn't find a fix for the Zell crash =/ if you take your save file out uninstall it and then reinstall it will fix the problem...but only for maybe an hour or 2 until you hit another portion of the game where it will randomly crash as you transition between screens. And as you could guess I grew tired of constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the game just to get past some crashes. So I'm going to shelf this game until I get bored again =p or until someone comes up with a legitimate fix for the random crashes happening all the time =p Anyways I hope this helps someone. 

P.S. I didnt check it but maybe if you just delete the SFX files and reinstall those it might fix it temporarily. But the conclusion I came to had to do with the music transitioning nothing to do with AMV's "

Before I start a big thankyou to KillerHaze for this Torrent...

K here goes... 

I have installed this on a Windows7 x64 version and it works beautifully

1) Mount ISO to drive or burn disc and place in dvd player

2) if autostart fails to start install - run startup.exe

3) Install the game selecting all options to install

4) do not run game, now run FinalFantasyVIIISFX.exe - this file is on the install disc(iso)

5) make sure it has selected correct directory, for x64 systems ""program files (x86)""

6) Let this installer do its thing...

7) copy the two files from the crack directory binkw32.dll, FF8.exe into the ""Eidos Interactive\square soft, Inc\final fantasy viii"" directory under ""program files"" or under ""program files (x86)"" depending on a x86 or x64 Windows version

8) in the ""Eidos Interactive\square soft, Inc\final fantasy viii"" directory, locate the file called ""FF8Config.exe"" and run it...

    -then change direct3D hardware acceleration to software renderer
    -in performance options click in «use high res fonts(requires 8mb of vram)

9) then close this app...

10) run the game...  and enjoy

This sounds like you did not run the  FinalFantasyVIIISFX.exe - this file is on the install disc(iso)

If you swear you did... then try these troubleshooting tips...


What OS are you currently running on?

If its vista, or windows 7 (both x86 and x64)

You will have to use the compatability mode.  right click on the icon you use to start, then select properties.

click on the compatibility tab

check the box that says Run this program in compatibility mode for...

and select ""Windows 98"" or ""Windows xp service pack 2""

you will have to test to see which one will work...

,psu3,2010-03-09T19:21Z,"Ooh it look right when I installed the SFX, but it went to the wrong file :P Thanks alot for the help!"
,Kohenkio,2010-03-11T22:13Z,"ok guys here how it works for those who have problems...

First MOUNT the file to any available program (i used Daemon Tools)

then autorun the installation
install the game, Make your own folder ex: programfiles/newfoolder/ff8
then instal sfx TO THE SAME folder u created

after u've done installng, go to Search or RUN and find ""regedit"" there you should find

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
SOFTWARE
Square Soft, Inc
FINAL FANTASY VIII

On the right side you should now see a string value labeled "" DataDrive"" with an icon ""ab"" on it

Modify

In the field marked ""Value Data"" enter the value of the current drive you are mounting at, it sais at the daemon tools menu, probably F:

now u've done the basics, be4 running the game, go to it's main folder, where all files are, crack it, if Geforce use the compitable crack, BUT, make a new folder and move the FF8.exe to that!, 

after running that (or if not run as administrator) you should face 0 problems!

hope i helped and i am seeding!"
,Kohenkio,2010-03-11T22:15Z,"and BTW i depend on that u already read all of prev comments, so noo need to mention the FF8Config!"
,iamneo33,2010-03-12T09:31Z,"Ok I have seen alot of comments on installing Final Fantasy VIII. I have worked out step by step instructions... as well I have provided the keys needed to play the game on the pc...

Before I start a big thankyou to KillerHaze for this Torrent...

K here goes... 

I have installed this on a Windows7 x64 version and it works beautifully

1) Mount ISO to drive or burn disc and place in dvd player

2) if autostart fails to start install - run startup.exe

3) Install the game selecting all options to install

4) do not run game, now run FinalFantasyVIIISFX.exe - this file is on the install disc(iso)

5) make sure it has selected correct directory, for x64 systems ""program files (x86)""

6) Let this installer do its thing...

7) copy the two files from the crack directory binkw32.dll, FF8.exe into the ""Eidos Interactive\square soft, Inc\final fantasy viii"" directory under ""program files"" or under ""program files (x86)"" depending on a x86 or x64 Windows version

8) in the ""Eidos Interactive\square soft, Inc\final fantasy viii"" directory, locate the file called ""FF8Config.exe"" and run it...

-then change direct3D hardware acceleration to software renderer
-in performance options click in «use high res fonts(requires 8mb of vram)

9) then close this app...

10) run the game... and enjoy

Don't forget to unmount the disc... from my above instructions...

YOu will no longer need the disc or iso...

again if you follow my instructions... you will not need to do anything else to play...

,Kohenkio,2010-03-13T00:21Z,"i also faced some probs, but if nothing works for u, even Neo's instruction then the final solution is to...

copy FF8.exe to a new folder you have to create INSIDE the original FF8 folder, in there except FF8.exe copy the current disc u are running, ex: DISC1.PAK when disc 2 is required just del the current DISC1.PAK and copy the DISC2.PAK in that folder....

can't get it to run otherwise over here, tryed all of the above vertions of solution! after you download keep it seeding! i still am, cuz this DL is gr8!"

,iamneo33,2010-03-17T01:35Z,"Nara

First question, did the install complete sucessfully, if so then you either forgot to run the update, or you forgot to copy the two crack files.

DO NOT RUN GAME, first run FinalFantasyVIIISFX.exe - this file is on the install disc(iso)

MAKE SURE it has selected correct directory, for x64 systems ""program files (x86)""

COPY THE TWO files from the crack directory binkw32.dll, FF8.exe into the ""Eidos Interactive\square soft, Inc\final fantasy viii"" directory under ""program files"" or under ""program files (x86)"" depending on a x86 or x64 Windows version

if you have run the game before these steps... then uninstall the game and follow the instructions I posted here to the letter...

Any other issues, Please let me Know

,nara1267,2010-03-17T07:42Z,what about the update folder? do i put those in before or after crack?
,nara1267,2010-03-17T07:54Z,working! still wondering about the update though ;) thanks so much!

,bberry6,2010-03-20T04:36Z,"i know beggars cant be choosers, but it seems to be running pretty laggy and sluggish.  im on windows 64 bit running out of the x86 folder. any suggestions to get it up to a normal fps?

thanks neo for all the help. and also thanks killerhaze for the torrent."
,closetmonsterrr,2010-03-20T04:56Z,"would it be better, graphics wise, to run cracked or mounted with virtual drive? 
looks better than psx emulators, but still reeeeally pixelated :P
still sweet though."
,bberry6,2010-03-20T05:40Z,"i just ran into a game crash!!  i completed the dungeon that you get ifrit at, and then quistis tells me to go change, i go change and she introduces Zell to me.  Then she calls Seifer out and right before he comes out it crashes....anyone have this too?

also, from my earlier post, i have adjusted all the performance settings to minimum, but there is no change in the sluggishness...

suggestions?"
,iamneo33,2010-03-21T22:29Z,"bberry6

You would need to move to a quad core to get out of the sluggishness.  I am running it on x64 with quad with no issues.  I do have 8Gig Memory... 2 GB DDR3 Video, with a raptor hard drive for loading games.  However I noticed that on dual core systems its tends to lag at times, but I had attributed that to being a laptop.

basically after all the geek speak.  You would have to make a hardware change..

Closet Monster,

Would be better graphics wise to run it cracked.  With a virtual drive there is a bit of hesitation.  Then again it depends how fast your hard drive can fetch info.

Hope this helps...

On the target your own party with spells like Curaga, you need to use either Cerberus (Cast double & Triple on your party) or cast the spell double/triple, which allows you to use Curaga 2/3 times, which you then have to use once on each character"

Ok So, lets try again

Download Torrent
Mount to Drive using virtual drive emulator
Install Game first.
Then install FF SFX
once that is done copy the crack over. ( try them both without the update and with the update)
Then go to start run, REGEDIT, on the side find software, programfiles, FF8, go into the game folder then into the file named 1.OO then in the main console you will see data drive, click it and CHANGE IT to the virtual drive name that FF8 is in. could be :h or :f or whatever letter.

Then, run ff8 config, set hardware render and load up the game. 

Now, if it still doesn't work, you HAVE TO reinstall the game. BUT delete the Whole ff8 file by going to program files, right click it and delete. then try to reinstall using the above instructions. If it still doesn't work. try using Just the different cracks, Or Just the Different updates. If it still doesn't work, Then try using a different Emulator. for example Daemon did not work for me, but POWERISO did, , That May be the case for you.

and by the way I did all of this on windows XP, I do not know what to do on vista or 7 "
,soggybreadd,2010-05-19T07:04Z,"Also, Try Unmounting the disk from the virtual drive Right before you run the game, That has been the case for some, but the REGEDIT instructions I said Shouldd fix it . that has been the case with most as well. If it doesn't work Holla back. Im always checking ahaha :P "

Idk wat else to do, it just goes to a black screen when I click new game =[

And to Silentmajority y would u download a title that u hav no idea about? most of us r downloading this game becuz of the warm sentiments and memories this game brings back rather than the ""cutting-edge"" graphics... I remember this title from when I was younger and its till fun to play.

here's what I did:

1. Mount, or Extract using WinRAR
2. Run ""STARTUP.exe""
3. Run ""FINALFANTASYVIIISFX.exe"" (or what they call SFX).
This SFX Installation will take some time, be patience in this file. It'll where you want to install it, browse to FF8 directory.

4. after you finally installed SFX. Apply cracks found in the ISO (Don't update)
5. Run FF8 Config, change Renderer from Direct3D To Software renderer and add Hi Res Fonts if you want.
6. Run the game.


- Done! -"

I've gotten it to the point where I reach the main menu. It crashes as soon as I select ""New Game.""

I got FFVIII to work this much but moving it to a subfolder within the FFVIII folder. Do I need to move certain files to the subfolder to get it to work?"

,crossfire92x,2011-04-07T09:58Z,"Okay, for everyone who is frustrated like I was at the game not working, follow what everyone else has posted, which is 

1. Install the game
2. Run SFX
3. Copy the cracks (either GeForce or non-GeForce)
4. Adjust the settings in FF8config to software rendering and hi-def fonts.
AND...this is what's killing ppl running Windows 7...MAKE SURE COMPATIBILITY MODE IS TURNED ON AND IS SET TO WINDOWS XP SP3. It will not work for others(at least not for me).

This solved all the issues I had with the black screen coming up when I would hit new game. I am now able to play and move successfully through the disks. Good luck everyone!!! AND THANK YOU KILLERHAZE! (you sexy beast!!)

PS. DO NOT USE THE UPDATES. THEY SUCK BALLS (not working.)"
,ljkremer,2011-04-08T03:41Z,"In the crack guide is says to paste ""binkw32.dll"" and ""FF8.exe"" in the installation directory. Can someone tell me how to get to the installation directory and what to do there exactly. Some input would be appreciated."
,EbloG,2011-04-12T22:49Z,"Alright!

I previously could not get this to run properly. However, after upgrading my OS (for completely unrelated reasons), it worked just fine! I ran Vista 32bit and upgraded to Win7 32bit with the gracious help of extremezone's Win7 Ultimate torrent. So, running Vista could possibly pose an issue with running this game."
,punkmonk007,2011-05-15T07:04Z,"Found in FF* launcher ReadMe file. I hvae the exact problem, but Haven't been able to solve it this way. but I hope for many This will Help.
-------------------------------------------------------
Q: The game crashes (""Black Screen of Death"") on Vista x86. What do I do?

A: This is due to EAX acceleration no longer being supported in Vista.
   If you have a Creative Audigy or X-Fi soundcard; Creative supplies an application called   ""Creative ALchemy"" that translate audio calls from DirectSound3D (EAX) to OpenAL.

   The application can be found here: http://connect.creativelabs.com/alchemy/default.aspx

   Owners of non-Creative brand Soundcards should check their manufacturer homepage for a possible workaround. Disabling EAX/sound acceleration or in worst case, uninstalling the soundcard drivers, should fix this issue. The latter would result in no sound."

,tickle92,2011-07-03T19:53Z,hey guys sorry iv looked through all comments and ill probably get problems later on by the looks of it but the install wont work for me.. it loads the autorun after ive mounted it with daemon tools but when i click install it takes a while then starts the download setup. al that is all good but when it reaches 100% it just shuts it and nothing installs... please help if any1 had the same issue

,Temppuli,2011-07-11T13:45Z,"**********GUIDE & BUG FIXES**********

TESTED ON WINDOWS 7 64-BIT PROFESSIONAL - READ EVERYTHING I WROTE HERE, DO NOT MISS A THING.

1ST PART IS THE INSTALL. 2ND IS THE BUG FIXES.

1. Mount the Final Fantasy ISO file with DAEMON TOOLS.

2. Run autorun.exe. ""INSTALL FF VIII"" Let it go 100%

3. Install SFX (HEY! Make sure this installs to same place as the game you just installed -> C:\Program Files (x86)\Eidos Interactive\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII /Cause for me it went to normal ""Program files"" and the game DID NOT WORK then.

4. Now both are done. > Go to my computer -> RIGHTCLICK the ""CD-Rom"" and choose ""open"" > You will see folder named crack.. Choose GeForce crack if u got geforce graphic driver. If not, choose NON-geforce.. (EXAMPLE OF MINE F:\CRACK\GeForce CRACK) (both cracks worked for me)

5. Copy ""binkw32.dll"" and ""FF8.exe""
Paste it in the installation directory.. WHICH IS: C:\Program Files (x86)\Eidos Interactive\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII (atleast for me, for you the place where you INSTALLED THE game.

6. Choose FF8Config, go to 2nd tab ""GRAPHICS"" and change: RENDERER TO: SOFTWARE RENDERER!
Below it you see ""PERFORMANCE OPTIONS"" -> CHOOSE  ""USE HIGH RES FONTS (REQUIRES 8MB OF VRAM)

7. MAKE SURE You rightlick ""ff8"" and CHOOSE: ""Run this program as an adminstrator"" AND Run this program in compatibility mode for: WINDOWS XP SERVICE PACK 3. 

7b. DO EXACTLY SAME TO FF8CONFIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

8. DO NOT UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9. READY TO PLAY :))

********FIXES**********

1. The game starts up to the 'new game' screen. But when I select new game, the game shuts down and returns to my desktop. 

- I had this myself also... But making the Ff8Config ""Run as admin + compatibility as Win XP sp3 fixed it"" (reads above too)

2. The game wont install? 

- I had this myself TOO... So okay.. u hit the ""install game"" nothing happens -> Turn off your computer for sometime... (I shaved, took a shower and smoked a joint.) Then put on again. Run the install again -> Tadaa it works.. (IT MAY TAKE TIME SOMETIMES.. BE PATIENT. IF WONT. TRY TO BOOT AGAIN. EXAMPLE: FOR SFX I WAITED 7MINUTES, BEFORE IT CAME UP)

2b: Saw some1 asking.. ""where is the game directory"" OMFG...... Where you installed it!? Example once again: C:\Program Files (x86)\Eidos Interactive\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII

3. Black screen of death!?

- Q: The game crashes (""Black Screen of Death"") on Vista x86. What do I do?

A: This is due to EAX acceleration no longer being supported in Vista.
If you have a Creative Audigy or X-Fi soundcard; Creative supplies an application called ""Creative ALchemy"" that translate audio calls from DirectSound3D (EAX) to OpenAL.

The application can be found here: http://connect.creativelabs.com/alchemy/default.aspx

Owners of non-Creative brand Soundcards should check their manufacturer homepage for a possible workaround. Disabling EAX/sound acceleration or in worst case, uninstalling the soundcard drivers, should fix this issue. The latter would result in no sound.

4. The game asks for CD1? 

- Did you install the UPDATE? If so, thats why.. it removed the CRACK!!
Install the game again, by my advice i just wrote for you. Before it.. delete the game from: Control Panel -> Uninstall a program. Find the game and uninstall.. Also go where you installed the game and delete EVERYTHING that remains for FF8 (Like Eidos interactive folders, from both program files.) Reboot! And do install again.

4b. 

-For those stuck with the ""first disk"" problem, follow this guide:

In regedit, find the key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Square Soft, Inc\FINAL FANTASY VIII\1.00

Right click on the string value labelled ""DataDrive"" (it will have an icon with the letters ab on it to the left of it) in the right pane of the regedit browser.

Click ""Modify""

In the field marked ""Value Data"" place the driver name of (C: or E: e.g) your virtual/physical drive you are running the disk from.

(For me.. It didnt even show the game files in RegEdit.. dunno why? )

,sergewar,2012-07-11T15:09Z,"@Blazun05 There is a file called ""FinalFantasyVIIISFX.exe"" in the .iso file. After the .iso file is mounted you must do a couple things:

1. Click startup.exe or setup.exe both will install the game.

2. Install DirextX if your computer doesn't already have it, its on the startup.exe menu

3. Use the Crack folder. If you don't know replace the files in the crack folder with the installation files that were install on your computer, the game will ask for Disc 1 when you try to play.

4. Run FinalFantasyVIIISFX.exe. This will unpack CDs 1-4 so you don't have to load them. The game will crash if this is not unpacked in the correct place. I REPEAT the game will crash if not installed in the RIGHT place. Double check that it is unpacking the files in the SAME folder the game was installed in.

5. Enjoy the game!"
