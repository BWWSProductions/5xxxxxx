                 Those of you who have followed us for a                     
                while might remember we released a VHSRip of                 
                this back in 2003. While the tape was pretty                 
                decent, it was still a 1983 VHS, the rip is                  
                getting pretty old, and as you all know Jacko                
                went and died since then. We're therefore                    
                thrilled (get it!?) to bring you this                        
                updated rip, made from the finest source                     
                available, the 1991 remastered Laserdisc                     
                with digital audio.                                          
                                                                             
                  This is a double treat, as it has both the                 
                full Thriller music video, and the extensive                  
                making-of documentary that aired so frequently               
                on MTV back then. Both were record holders for               
                their time, Thriller as the most expensive music             
                video ever, and the documentary as the best                  
                selling home video ever, with over 9 million                 
                copies sold worldwide.                                       
                                                                             
                  This is Michael at his very biggest, when                  
                he owned the world, and could get anything he                
           wanted at the snap of his fingers. Like SFX             
            legend Rick Baker, teamed with John Landis,              
              and the most elaborate extended choreographed              
              monster zombie dance scene the world had ever              
             seen.

            primarily on '80s childhood gems, over time              
               that focus has expanded to include a wide                   
                range of rare and out of print material from
