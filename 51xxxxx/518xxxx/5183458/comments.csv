[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-26T12:11Z,"Hi,

  This is the Internet Security version, because it also protects you on the Internet. But is also Ă­ncludes Anti-Virus."
,natedagreat81,2010-03-21T06:53Z,"Worked perfectly, so far everything seems on the up and up. Thanks for the torrent."
,petadaman,2010-03-31T05:40Z,"i want the new one for free, but what happens if it doesnt work, you know? Like im all go but i want to know what happens if it doesnt"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-04-01T16:59Z,"Hi,

  What do you mean with the new one?"
,dan0uge,2010-05-12T18:55Z,So this has the firewall included?
[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-22T19:08Z,"Hi, 


Yes, Firewall is included, but it's optional."
,dan0uge,2010-05-26T01:42Z,"Thing is, Firewall doesn't appear in the components view, all I see is: Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, link scanner, Anti Rootkit, E-mail Scanner, License, Online shield, Resident shield, Update manager."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-29T10:33Z,"Hi,


1. Are you sure you Installed the Firewall too?

2. If yes, you can acces it via the 'Options' menu. Just search for 'Firewall'."
