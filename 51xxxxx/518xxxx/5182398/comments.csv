Pass on this one."
,exelmo,2009-11-30T05:00Z,"Ok guys i have figured out how to get this working pretty easy really :P 
So you will have noticed that the game works fine for about 4 to 10 mins and then qits to the desktop instantly :S 
well all you need to do is download this first & install it into your directory 
(First) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5187564/Left_4_Dead_2_Update_2.0.0.2_incl._crack
Then you need to do the same with this one 
But also you need to use the registry files it comes with
