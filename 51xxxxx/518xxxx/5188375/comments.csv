,truckiebro,2010-02-23T07:13Z,Why won't FLAC files transfer to Itunes? using transmission
,Zeppoleon,2010-03-10T05:19Z,Thanks!
,kurac55,2010-09-15T15:33Z,"Becouse iTunes doesnt support FLAC, use the freeware program called XLD, it converts to Apple lossless and imports to iTunes."
,Berend.botje,2010-10-23T14:30Z,"Good work!! i love FLAC! 
its a pitty that so little people know FLAC and upload in Flac, i think its time for a revolution! 
get rid of the MP3 and FLac will conquer the world :P ;)"
