,bart001fr,2009-11-30T20:19Z,"What most first-time uploaders don't know is that torrents work like this:

1: your make your torrent on your computer and enclose it in a folder;

2: you post the torrent and add a description (most often lacking) to your chosen torrent site (I say site because they don't track anymore, and some are legal-only)

3: (this is the most important step most first-time uploaders forget) when your torrent appears on the torrent site, you start the procedure as a normal download of a torrent. Since you then point the client (eg: uTorrent)  to download the file to the exact place where your prepared torrent resides (remember the folder you made in 1 above), the client sees that the file is complete and automatically starts seeding.

Voila. 

I hope this is clear enough!

As for what the other commenters said above me, they are partly right. your torrents are just a little too big. Please try to cut them so they fit on a dvd. That would make them about 4.3 GB. 

Better yet, burn the files to fill a DVD first, then copy the DVD to a properly named folder, then post the folder to the torrent site. Then do step 3 above.
