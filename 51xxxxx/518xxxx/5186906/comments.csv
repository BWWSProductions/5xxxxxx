,snoopz14,2009-11-29T16:36Z,Go into the sound settings on the ps3 and uncheck AAC. You may need to re enable it to see movies encoded in AC3.

,Piz77,2009-11-30T01:40Z,"I cannot get 5.1 surround when I run AAC encoded files... I uncheck the AAC setting of my system, as instructed by snoopz and the sound comes on, but not in 5.1 . I have no problems with any of the M2TS/AC3 encoded files... they're wonderful both in picture and sound. My receiver is a Denon AVR-1604... "
[T],suavecito195782,2009-11-30T19:55Z,wow i cant believe how long this movie is taking to finish does it make a difference how many people are leeching off me

,irate976,2009-12-15T13:59Z,"No one is coming to get any of you. Sounds like some sort of ploy to mislead us. Don't know where your getting your info but if the people who run the bay are in jail, then how is the site still up???"
,irate976,2009-12-15T14:01Z,"sorry, the founders***"
,acsluploading,2009-12-29T04:32Z,"in sweden copyright laws are different and the founders arn't the only ones running the site ;) The Bay will never die because its to connected and organised. And downloaders cannot be prosicuted because its hard to track individuals and pointless to arresting a downloader does not really effect the pirating business therefore not worth the hassle or money of a prosicution. Think about it if 1000 people download this each person would only really be affecting 0.0001% of it. Its the uploaders that have a higher risk, but with so many varients and torrents of the same thing its lowered and most companys or copyright holders wont chase them down because its just not worth it when someone else will put up what that person put up. :P"
,acsluploading,2009-12-29T04:32Z,But yeah thanks for this film man A++ quality and a awesome film :)

,Ahmedattia24,2010-02-15T12:38Z,"The screenshots seem really small, can anyone please confirm this is 1080p.
Thanks."
,me.me.me,2010-09-13T05:13Z,"oh its HD allright. amazing rip; 5/5.

,eklxtreme,2010-12-22T22:03Z,Why don't you mention in the title that it's ONLY for PS3? It doesn't work on any of my 4 media players on the computer
