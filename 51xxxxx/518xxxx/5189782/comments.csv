,andre1264,2009-12-01T04:34Z,is this real?
,imagines,2009-12-01T07:03Z,"Ok I have seen it, and it's ok. Quality is low, but the story is not for the eyes, it's for the mind, so no need to wait for better picture quality.

I saw the original yesterday and they do compare in some ways, but it's far from a remake. Original is far darker and deeper and the acting is more ""in your face"" than this parody that makes it more entertaining and light.

All the offending stuff, the heavy shit is removed, and the ending is, well, I wont spoil either for you, but if you wanna laugh, see this, if you wanna see a real bad lieutenant, see the original..."
,m3dik8ed,2009-12-01T16:28Z,"This isnt a remake of the Harvey Keitel movie Bad Lieutenant. This is another movie with a similar name starring Nic Cage. Have been looking forward to seeing this one, thanks for the up, will drop back in when Im done to confirm A/V details"
,stu8975,2009-12-01T17:28Z,"imagines - stfu, you've left the same comment on just about all the versions of this. The nedivx copy is the best so far."

,Phatfish,2009-12-02T07:30Z,"Excellent movie! A must see.
I was a bit sceptic at first but it turned out there was no need."
,Yellowbelly,2009-12-02T14:02Z,For all of you who are on here looking for movies....do not follow any link that promises you a site where you can watch the latest movies for free.....they make you fill out a survey (which in turn will overflow you with spam) then they say your video player needs its latest update....as soon as you click yes you are downloading a herpes like virus (when you try and run virus removers or delete associated files....up pops the Blue Screen of death).  Please use common sense and try to keep your downloads to trusted TPB users.
,scott_ehm,2009-12-02T19:06Z,Why did Herzog do this?
,theoquda,2009-12-03T01:57Z,"Very good movie, mediocre video for a dvdrip.
A/V - 7.5
M - 9"
,kbowk2,2009-12-03T09:56Z,Good work yellowbelly.  I usually spam the dicks who leave those types of comments.  They deserve no balls.
,quixable,2009-12-05T02:15Z,Hey...how do you extract or play these files? Win Zip doesn't seem to cut it for me. ta.
,stenna_215,2010-03-05T11:05Z,"Why did Herzog do this?  ... I have no fucking idea, his specialty is road movies, anyway, much as I like Nick Cage,I reserve judgment on this movie, because for me Harvey Keitel played the baddest mutthafucking cop on the planet, with a little assistance from Abel Ferrara, lets see ""who's bad""!"
,jammin83,2010-05-28T00:39Z,many thanks
