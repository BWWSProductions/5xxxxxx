From the book "The Miracle Seven: 7 Amazing Exercises That Slim, Sculpt, and Build the Body in 20 Minutes a Day" by John E. Peterson and Wendie Pett.

This small pdf file contains the "Tiger Move" exercises in text with illustrations.

I've never found any particular need to look at the rest of the book, though I have told literally hundreds of people about it, so I wanted to create a way to share the good stuff without all the fluff.

Here's an Amazon review: "This book contains exercises that are thousands of years old and yet are the most efficient and effective way to exercise in the twenty first century.

They have their origin in the ancient Yoga and Kungfu tensing exercises.

They require no special equipment or clothing and give you the ability to exercise anywhere and anytime.

The resistance is provided by your own mind using your imagination and visual imagery.

The course consists of stretching and tensing exercises that are fun to do and because of the intense concentration you are developng your mind at the same time that you are developing your body.

Give them a try-I bet you'll get hooked even if you don't like to exercise."
