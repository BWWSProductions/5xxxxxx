,scoopnohlee,2009-11-28T00:36Z,Keep in mind that the comment section is for comments about the torrent and not about trying to get people to go to your stupid movie sights.  Respect the uploader and let them no by commenting on their torrent.  You're being very selfish and ignorant.  Thanks for the upload  Extremezone.  You people who leave your spam shit should be banned!!

,maloop,2009-12-03T12:36Z,What is the matter with you people. Can't you write something with out resorting to using foul and unneccesary bad language. Either you're adult enough to cope with homosexuality or you're not but don't just come on insulting people because you are too immature to live and let live. Happily married with two kids. 6' 4'' 250 pounds and you wouldn't tell me to ''F'' off if I was stood in front of you. The bravery of being out of range! Quite saddened me seeing so many people make complete idiots of themselves.
,piratepete9,2009-12-03T15:08Z,maloop fuck off ha ha just kidding big fella!!! ya right mind about the comments section...its about shareing these torrents that matter not childish crap and i personally thank the uploader for all the hard work gone into placeing this film here for us all to watch so THANK U extremezone for another great movie and peace out maloop..
,maloop,2009-12-03T20:07Z,"A perfect example of ''The bravery of being out of range'' guitdude! Had you made you point about martial arts without having to resort to using bad language I would have not replied to your comment.
You have a good point that despite my size I am not fit and you're also right that a first year student would make me look helpless and defenceless against his skills never mind what Mr. Lee would do to me. As it happens I don't use my size or weight to intimidate others. I tend to find that because of my size people tend to leave me alone. I was ranting at the morons who use the comments section to be rude offensive and homophobic. When people have gone to the time and effort to share a movie they should be thanked and not critisized because of the content or because Video and Audio don't score a perfect Ten. I would love to know if the loud mouthed idiots who swear and cuss at other peoples efforts ever upload themselves or do they simple download and still have the cheek to complain....."

ashes152 >> Make sure you use VLC player.

jake420 >> shut up. Even if you're telling the truth, its your own fault and you're one in a million who got cut off.

And in general, yes Adam Sandler has a lotta crappy not-so-funny movies, but hey he has also made some aulity such as The Longest Yard, so don't bitch - you would only watch this movie if you like his sort of humor in the first place. I'm looking foraqrd to seeing it, thanks for the UL.

A lot of the people commenting on this are obviously out for cheap laughs or something to watch stoned. No disrespect I fully understand as I have been known to get baked and watch a good comedy. This movie is more a DRAMA of lighthearted nature. Despite what the commercials made it out to be it actually deals with some serious issues and emotions. It is merely a movie ABOUT comedians and is only supposed to have a funny nature, it is NOT INTENDED to be hilarious.
