,Davomartinez,2009-11-27T23:21Z,"Hi, thanks for the file.  When I played the file it seems like the program repeats (time 1:43:22).  

I use Audible.com but when they play a 'best of' I guess the R&F guys post a previous show instead of the 'best of'.

Is there anyway I can help doing some of these recordings?  Before I had Audible I used to record the show from my XM radio (using the Line In) to my computer and kept all the shows as an archive."

Not sure. I did notice they don't seem to have proper intros and outros, but they are not my work so it is what it is. The O&A I'm editing myself so that would be my issue. 

As far as helping, I'm sure there are folks out there who would appreciate (even line-in) Ron and Fez. The key would be the editing of commercials (use mp3directcut) and uploading in a timely fashion. Though I haven't been too timely myself as of late and bottom line is if no on else is upping first you'll be appreciated either way. 

I think Dr. Dumb may be finished, I saw a comment he made awhile back about traveling alot and not being able to post much so he could be done with R&F. "

Cheers to all and Happy US Thanksgiving."
