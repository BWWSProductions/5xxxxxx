Miriodor are one of the finest Canadian experimental progressives. A strong influence of the first Canterbury bands (EGG, GILGAMESH, UNIVERS ZERO's influence) is noticeable, as in the experience of the MUFFINS. They perform themes based on breaks and harmonic audacities with a technical facility and a lot of ideas that should please all the fans of a pioneering Progressive. There is plenty of good sax playing which contributes to that jazzy improvised sound attributed to the Canterburries.
