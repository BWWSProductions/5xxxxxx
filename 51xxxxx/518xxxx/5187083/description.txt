Small collection of eBooks on mercenaries also known as private military companies or security contractors (sounds better doesn't it)
This business has been around for many (thousands) years but a lot has changed since Executive Outcomes in Africa (not to mention ancient Egypt). Nowadays this business is worth some $100 billion a year and it's more overt that it used to be.
There are 5 eBooks inside- each one packed with 7zip with nothing but PDF file inside the archive. No viruses, no trojans- I know archives may look suspicoius to you but it saves a lot of bandwidth in the long run as I seed my torrents all the time.
All books include covers for thumbnail view.

Books included are:

-Big Boy Rules: America's Mercenaries Fighting in Iraq by Steve Fainaru (winner of 2008 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting) Year 2008, Pages 273

-Corporate Soldiers and International Security: The Rise of Private Military Companies (Contemporary Security Studies) by Christopher Kinsey, Year 2006, Pages 209
