The Blueprint 3 is the upcoming eleventh studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, set to be released in the US on September 11, 2009 (UK released September 14), which is 8 years after the release of the first Blueprint. It will be the final installment in The Blueprint trilogy, preceded by the critically acclaimed The Blueprint (2001) and the commercially successful The BlueprintÂ²: The Gift & The Curse (2002). On May 20, 2009 Jay-Z confirmed that he bought out the remainder of his contract from Def Jam Records in order to start his contract with Live Nation, and therefore The Blueprint 3 will be released under Roc Nation and distributed by Atlantic Records.
