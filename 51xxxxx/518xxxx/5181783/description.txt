This is the first ISO release of Ubuntu's April 2010 Long Term Service release. It is in Alpha and is meant for testing/developing only.

That said, I'd like to think it's for the curious and interested. It seems to run very well already. It's clearly not something you'll want to use as your primary OS, but it's fun to mess around with as are all new things.

ENJOY!

I'm home from college for thanksgiving so it'll be a bit slow for a bit. Hopefully I can do a little port-forwarding, but it's only till sunday so the speed will be faster starting 11/29

Another key bit i forgot to include: There is a bug with the image size. It is still a live cd, but you will need to either use unetbootin+usb drive, or a dvd.
