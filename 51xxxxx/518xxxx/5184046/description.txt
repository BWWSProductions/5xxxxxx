Astro Boy 1980 Uncut Pilot:
     - The Birth of Astro Boy
     - Astro Boy vs. Atlas

These are the first two ~24 minute episodes of the 1980 Astro Boy as originally aired in Japan (and with English subtitles).  When it was released in the US, it was cut down to a single ~24 minute episode with several major plot points removed (including the entire Atlas subplot).  As it stands, while available on DVD in some other countries, it was never properly released in the US or UK, despite the rest of the 1980's series being widely available.

Good quality .AVI format - Japanese audio w/ English subtitles
