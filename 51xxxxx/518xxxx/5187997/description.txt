Here you are, perhaps bit older version, but easy to install and working fine:

Altiverb v6.10 by Audioease - unfortunately for Windows only (who has a Mac one?)

This is for the music professionals with small wallets among us,
but please buy the product if you can afford it.

Also included is a legal demo version with some IRs (Impulse Response files).

Do not ask silly questions what it is or how to use it, if you still need to perhaps using it is a bit out of your league.

Enjoy!
