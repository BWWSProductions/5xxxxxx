,HungryProducer,2011-04-22T15:51Z,"MAC USERS DOWNLOAD THIS.
why would you say its ONLY compatible for windows? are you retarded?
you say this:
""Do not ask silly questions what it is or how to use it, if you still need to perhaps using it is a bit out of your league."" 
but i'm not sure how much you know because VSTs are cross compatible between OSX & Windows."
,HungryProducer,2011-04-23T07:14Z,"ok so i was wrong, they stupidly used a Windows only installer for a cross compatible VST... first time i have seen this... LAME..."
