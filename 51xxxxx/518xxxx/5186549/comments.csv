,Valaquenta,2009-12-06T14:45Z,"Oops...
Sorry, forgot about that.
Here's how to fix it:

Option 1 Firewall/Antivirus (Recommended):

1) Install the game from the .ISO file (Mount using Daemon tools or another image mounting program.
2) Run the game.
3) Your anti-virus/firewall will now prompt you to allow a connection to the internet. DO NOT ALLOW THIS!
4) Enjoy the game =D


Option 2: Patch + No DVD Crack
1) Install the game
2) Launch the game
3) Allow CoH to connect to the internet.
4) Download all patches with the RelicCoH downloader (auto launches)
5) Your game version will be updated to 2.601
6) Download the following file: Oops...
Sorry, forgot about that.

6) Be sure to back up both files (RelicCoH.exe and udro.dll)
7) Remove all CoH exceptions from your firewall
8) Start CoH

,Valaquenta,2009-12-10T21:47Z,"This doesn't work. I blocked all internet connections but I still get the login screen when I start the game and cannot proceed. 


Then you didn't block them properly. To test if you did, just shut down your internet connection for like 1 minute, and start the game. Then you'll see a screen that'll ask you to verify the game ;)"

,Zinu,2009-12-13T16:08Z,"Do I have to reinstall every time to get either other two unlocked? I installed using CoH keygen, so only original CoH episodes are unlocked.

Do I have to reinstall with CoH:OP or CoH:ToV key to be able to play those?"
,Valaquenta,2009-12-13T22:23Z,"Nope. only one installation is required.
You need to validate using the retail store option."

,tjiax1,2009-12-14T05:19Z,but the retail store ask me to input cd but i mount it on deamon and the game cannot detect it
,Valaquenta,2009-12-17T16:08Z,"No it's not online mode only. It's the full version, including Single Player.
Try to download the no cd crack (according to your current version) from www.gamecopyworld.com"
,Sparx10,2009-12-19T04:53Z,"Well after a few hours I got this working. NONE of the no-cd patches worked for me, so I did the following: (but this probably won't work for you)

#1: I installed CoH: Opposing Fronts from a free copy I received with my video card.
#2: Allowed RelicCoH.exe in firewall
#3: Didn't download patch
#4: Mounted and installed CoH: Anthology (it said it would modify my existing installation)
#5: Started game, it asked for my Opposing Fronts disc; verified.

Debating right now whether or not to install patches (might screw up).

Thanks for the great torrent."
,Sparx10,2009-12-19T06:51Z,"If you don't have the original disk, try using a mini-image from www.gamecopyworld.com it worked great for me to unlock the original campaign. and it should work if you dont have a legal opposing fronts disk."
,Sparx10,2009-12-19T06:53Z,"lol one more thing: DON'T USE A NO-CD CRACK! IT WILL SCREW SHIT UP! JUST BLOCK THE EXE IN YOUR FIREWALL!

that will be all

thanks for the super torrent Valaquenta"

patches work fine from the official site (good idea having patches dled as torrents instead of http)"

1) Mount The Image And Use THIS KEY ONLY To Install ""3333-4444-1111-2222-ce13"" Its a ToV Key And With This You Will Have NO MORE CD Key Checks!
2) Now The Image MUST Be Mounted At All Times! Dont Use ANY Cracks,Not Necessary.
3) DISCONNECT From The Internet And Launch The Game, And Click On OK When It Checks For The CD Once.
4) Play And Enjoy The Game :)
(Later You Can Alt+Tab And Enable Internet In-Game) 
5) Alternatively You Can Patch The Game To v2.601 Without Needing ANY Crack, Juz Make Sure Your Disconnected From The Internet Before You Launch The Game And The Image Is Mounted.

,Chanmasta,2010-04-22T12:10Z,"Okay, people! This is REALLY easy to get going. You just have to download the CoHOF and CoH original mini-images from GCW and mount the necessary image before you enter the serial and click to verify it.
http://m0008.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_company_of_heroes.shtml (I don't know if the link will work. If not just go to the CoH section). Search the page for ""mini"" and it should go to ""administrator"" then it will go to the mini-image file location. Download it, then go to the CoHOF page and search for ""mini"" again and download the mini-image from there.

I only tried this with 2.601 using a fixed image so I didn't need the ToV disk.

-Disconnect your internet 
-Start the game
-Click the first content circle (Normandy Beach, I believe)
-Alt + Tab to desktop
-Mount the CoH (original) mini-image
-Enter given serials and it should verify, no problem
-Repeat with CoHOF image for the 2nd content and it should unlock both the 2nd and third content. (takes about 30 seconds to verify)
-You will need to keep the CoHOF disk mounted, though.

Enjoy!"

It says this package includes Company of Heroes (Game of the Year), Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts, and Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor.

However, it only contained one disk, which was Company of Heroes (supposedly ""game of the year""), which was fine since that was the only one I wanted because I have bought the game, have the keycode, but my disc got damaged and I can't install.

But this was NOT the GOTY edition. It's the normal edition. The installer is the same as the regular, and my GOTY legit keycode did not work on it.

Just posting this as a heads up. If anyone is looking for Opposing Fronts, Tales of Valor or tjhe GOTY version of the original game, don't bother.

Also, if anyone knows where I could possibly find the actual GOTY version it would be greatly appreciated."

,redhammer,2011-11-02T15:42Z,"I have tried again and again with the Opposing Forces mini image off of the TOV rar, but theres just no chance of getting Daemon Tools to actually mount it,  COH1 and COH TOV mounts right off, but when I mount CoH OF I get a small Daemon Tools window where it says its mounting the image but simply nothing happens and I`ve left it open for a couple of hours now... Come on..."
,vipeanut,2011-12-12T23:23Z,DOESNT WORK
,LurnLoroth,2011-12-28T22:09Z,"Torrent works but takes a bit of work to get there. Follow the previous steps to install and such but when unlocking the campaigns make sure you use virtual SCSI drives, not the default DT drives. This will make it so you don't get the ""emulation software detected"" message and should let you unlock everything with no problems. ;)"
,nobrain43,2012-01-02T14:23Z,"ok i tried everything listed before, after installation i get black screen and nothing more. could someone please write the exact and detailed instructions how to install?"
,AbhijeetSingh307,2012-01-26T17:58Z,is this torrent have all 3 games n campaight...... how its only 7 gb if others r about 17 gb
,LurnLoroth,2012-01-26T18:07Z,"1) Mount The Image And Use THIS KEY ONLY To Install ""3333-4444-1111-2222-ce13"" Its a ToV Key

2) Let the game patch itself to the most current

3) Download 3 mini images from http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?g=1&c=725495341&d=2009&f=NetShow-TOV_DC%21rar

4) IMPORTANT! In Daemon Tools you MUST mount the mini images with virtual SCSI drives, NOT DT drives or else you will get the ""emulation software detected"" message! Mount the mini images with SCSI drives.

5) Now you can unlock the campaigns.
For the first use 3438-fdf3-fd15-7fa6-94b7
The next use 9D64-33D0-6368-1911-1E07
And Done! "

thanks"
,Eteneme,2012-04-10T03:45Z,Great Torrent! Thanks @Valaquenta and thanks @LurnLoroth for the instructions. Why Daemon Tools don't let me mount SCSI drives? Now I only need to mount the CoH Opposing Fronts mini image to Unlock the campaign...

This is required for the anthology as well.

,iamhelix,2012-06-02T09:35Z,loser: why have a misleading title on this.
,glsmaster,2012-06-03T06:47Z,"WTF with this shit? ""Follow My Previous Posts Here,Steps For The Know-How To Installing The Game Properly."" which ""Previous Posts"" are you talking about? What the hell with this .rar that contain a simple .iso file? it doesn't contains nothing more but a ""DISK1"" image! Where is supposed to be located the others .iso that need to be mounted? Shitty instruction, shitty torrent. Give at least some detailed explanation first. High Quality Torrents doesn't need the use of external resources to work. Just mount, replace files and it is done. :/"
,EuPhobos,2012-06-13T18:15Z,"This not Antholohy!
This RAR contain ONLY ORIGINAL game on 8Gb !
STOP FULLISH PEOPLE!!!"
,blackarun,2012-06-15T18:26Z,"Fully working

use tales of valor key while installing.

then search NS-TOV_DC-poseden and download 3 images.(less than 500kb)

Mount it in daemon tools pro advanced edition

launch game.
use keys for respected campaigns by clicking on lock icon inside game.

type the keys from readme file.

select retail for protection checking.

Thats it. you got a full version of games(opposing fronts,tales of valor,company of heroes original) within a single download. enjoy
