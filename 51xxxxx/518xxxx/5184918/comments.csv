2 pixels top, 4 pixels bottom
Aspect Error is -0.1%"

Ok, let's download and see if 1500 Kbps makes any difference. :)"
,BasilBrush,2009-11-29T03:33Z,If you use FFDshow for rendering try the Sharpen filters. The LSFMod() Avisynth filter does a similar thing but doubles the encoding time.

I think the sprints are THE most exciting event in modern cross-country skiiing. But why don't these motherf...ers on Eurosport show the ENTIRE sprint program? :(( They didn't have the women's quarterfinals this time... I think the sprint quarterfinals are way more interesting than the individual (not mass start, separate) races, where for the first hour or so you have to watch the weak skiers boringly ski their way along the 15 km or 10 km..."

They now only do Content Distribution.
I've applied for Content Distribution status but I think that's highly unlikely. I'll try to post to isohunt instead if Piratebay go down."
