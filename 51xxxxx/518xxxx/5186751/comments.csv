I see you advise not to allow it to install office genuine advantage - that is probably the problem but not sure how to prevent that when updates are done automatically?"
,goldfishshaz,2010-01-23T01:18Z,"re message about turning off updates, I have selected check beforedownload and install but will it specifically list ""office genuine advantage"" as all I can see are office security updates listed in past downloads."
[V],thethingy,2010-01-23T03:10Z,depending on the windows os you either select show detail of the update or right click the update for the update details.
[V],thethingy,2010-01-23T03:14Z,"and do this;

Show hidden files & folders and go to;

C:ProgramDataMicrosoftOFFICEDATA 

Then delete;

opa12.dat 

And reaply activation method."

So, I read through all the threads, including other ones from other torrents, and again it works, only to give the same error once I turn on the internet.  What gives? thanks in advance"

,amom,2012-04-11T00:38Z,Thank you for this download.  I am new to torrents and wasn't sure about it but it really works!  I don't understand about the seeding other than it's a good thing to do to keep sharing the files as per the FAQ page.  I left mine on until I saw the U and D on the bottom go to 1.5 each.  Hope this was the right thing to do.  Let me know what's proper torrent manners.  Thanks again.
