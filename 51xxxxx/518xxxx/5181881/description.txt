Release Notes:

For nearly a decade, American Heartbreak have been one of rockâ€™s underground heroes,
but with the release of their eponymous second full-length album, they aim to leave
the underground behind and follow in the footsteps of their arena rock idols. The
San Francisco-based quintet â€“ co-founded by Billy Rowe, onetime guitarist for Jetboy
(a band All Music Guide calls â€œone of the best-kept secrets of â€˜80s glam metalâ€) â€“
blend a punk-influenced pop-metal aesthetic with the melodic allure and accessible
hooks of classic pop radio. If the New Wave Of Classic Rock is in session, American
Heartbreak is at the head of the class.

Along with vocalist Lance Boone and former Exodus bassist Michael Butler (currently
the host of the highly successful weekly â€œRock and Roll Geek Showâ€ Podcast), Rowe
first introduced American Heartbreak to rock fans via the 1997 EP What You Deserve,
initially released on Perris Records. After several tribute album contributions and
lineup changes, their first full-length, Postcards From Hell, surfaced three years
later on hometown indie Coldfront Records. The album recalled the unpretentious fun
of supercharged Sunset Strip rock while reinterpreting the buzz-saw melodies of
arena rock legends such as Kiss and Cheap Trick for a post-alternative rock age.

Following a 2001 split-CD with The Libertines, the group added rhythm guitarist
Casey Crenshaw prior to a European tour, during which they recorded a live set that
became the foundation of their next release. 2003â€™s You Will Not Be Getting Paid
(Perris Records) featured five live songs, five acoustic tracks (including Starz
and Cheap Trick covers) and six remixed songs from the What You Deserve EP.

After the European releases of You Will Not Be Getting Paid and Postcards From Hell
in 2004 (People Like You Records), the group returned to the continent for another
tour in early 2005. Back on the home front, they toured the West Coast with
Backyard Babies, The Chelsea Smiles and Crash Kelly that summer. (The group has
also toured and/or gigged with The New York Dolls, The Donnas, Queens of the Stone
Age, Buckcherry, Warrant, Cinderella, The Scorpions, Dio, Sebastian Bach, L.A.
Guns, Starz and Tsar, among others.)

By yearâ€™s end, the band completed its second full-length with co-producer Rick
Parker (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Space Twins [Weezer guitarist Brian Bellâ€™s
side project], Tyler Hilton). The result: 13 tracks of timeless rock nâ€™ roll. It
proves that while trend-seekers may be fawning over the latest batch of rock
â€œsaviorsâ€ as if the genre was invented only yesterday, American Heartbreak is the
real deal â€“ a band impervious to fads and driven purely by the desire to play
loud, catchy rock.
