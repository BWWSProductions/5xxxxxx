Director Michael Raven

Rebecca Carter's (jessica drake) decision to become a psychologist was easy. After all, she always liked helping people and had always been a good listener. But she doesn't understand why she's decided to become a psychologist who sees mostly cops from the Metropolitan Police Department. Having blamed her detective father's (Randy Spears) lifestyle for the chronic pain and loneliness she's suffered since an early age, she wonders why she'd willingly repeat her past with men who are so much like him. What's more, she's found herself dating a detective. One who is on the front line of a serial killer case and who has little time for her. As she ponders her decisions, two unexpected people enter her life: A handsome patient who offers her what her boyfriend is no longer able to give... and a cold-blooded murderer who wants her dead.
