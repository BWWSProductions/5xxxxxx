,arthoheen,2009-11-29T20:44Z,"@ jack1988, My experience says FXG ain't a Liar. Sometimes Uploaders get these DVDs long before their retail release. Anyway, the Movie is crappy."
,bordrx,2009-11-30T01:23Z,"Yes this is a real DVDrip, there's even a BRrip out since yesterday.
Quality is 9/9
Movie kinda sucks tbh, highlight was the chick's ass in those funky green yfronts, rest was yawnworthy"
