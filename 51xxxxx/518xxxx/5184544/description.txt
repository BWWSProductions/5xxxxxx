  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Blackberry Auto Playlist Creator is a program designed to automatically
   create playlists for the music on your Blackberry. It works by searching
   through all the music on your Blackberry and creating playlists for each
   folder of music it finds. If you have a folder called "Rock Music" then
   a playlist with the same name will be created containing all the music
   in that particular folder. Blackberry Auto Playlist Creator is also
   capable of automatically transferring new music folders to your device.
