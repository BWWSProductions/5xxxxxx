,Digger77,2010-09-10T19:26Z,"its not working for me. i double click the exe, it starts and closes. but thats maybe i have Win7 64bit. any ideas how to fix this? anybody else having this issue?"
,IuliaD,2010-12-15T17:08Z,@Digger77 ... Try running it as administrator. I had the same problem with all my .exe files so you either switch to administrator account either run it as administrator. Should work.
