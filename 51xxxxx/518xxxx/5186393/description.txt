The application can create procedural and hand painted textures from scratch, remove visible seams from existing images, crop textures from photos by applying a perspective correction, render seamless tiles from structure sample patches, combine existing textures and heightmaps with realistic illumination and much more.

Perfect for game/map creation. Complements photoshop users work.

This is hard to come across so please seed.
