    The official Reddit iPhone app. Never be bored again. With this app   
    , you'll always be only a tap (or shake) away from the most           
    interesting stuff on the web. If you can't afford the cost and don'   
    t mind ads, there's also a free version of iReddit: Search iTunes     
    Store for "iReddit Free" All of your favorite reddit functionality    
    is here: view the hottest, newest, top, and most controversial        
    stories of the moment, explore individual subreddits, vote, comment   
    , share, and save links for later. The entire commenting system has   
    been optimized for the iPhone app so you won't have any trouble       
    contributing to an epic pun thread. Save time by never having to      
    reload the reddit homepage. You can even use handy next/previous      
    navigation to move between websites without going back to the main    
    list. And those sites work in portrait and widescreen modes too. It   
    's never been easier to be entertained. Just shake your iPhone to     
    enter "serendipity mode" where you'll be served a random,             
    interesting site. Pro-tip: Turn on "play sound on shake" for a        
    special treat with every jostle -- the iPhone is an elegant phone     
    for a more sophisticated age. We're always trying to improve reddit   
    and the same goes with our iPhone app. Please leave us feedback

    We're no longer supporting the first version of the app, upgrade to

      Start CORE10k.EXE to verify that this release comes really from    
       CORE. If the CRC check fails or CORE10k.EXE is missing you're     
     holding a fake/third party modified crack/release in your hands!
