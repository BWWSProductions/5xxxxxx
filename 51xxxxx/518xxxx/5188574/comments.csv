Thank you for this upload. I'm hopeful that you will upload all the seasons."

No blur!"
,dsorc,2010-06-22T13:52Z,Commentary track in episode 1.
,seederGR,2011-05-02T20:27Z,"very good quality!!! image and sound. well done.

just one small problem. even if i change the name of the files in the explorer, in the vlc media player they are still named ""Done with AutoMKV ..... ...."" and the name I changed it to.

does anyone know how i could change them properly?

thanks"
,seederGR,2011-05-02T22:41Z,"not*

""and NOT the name i changed it to.""

sry forgot to write ""not"" :S"
,seederGR,2011-05-02T23:15Z,"ok third comment in a row :P

i found a solution. the problem was that the metadata still had the wrong name. so if you should experience something similar download ""mkvmerge"" run it and open the problematic file. under the global tab choose the name you want and hit ""start muxing""

ok well... thanks again for the torrent. the files really are of a very good quality!"
,fluster84,2011-05-30T17:41Z,"Ok, so this is BY FAR THE BEST Buffy rip I have seen here. Thank you so much for sharing this everyone. 

A 9.5/10  V 9.5/10

This is much better quality than the complete x264 rip. I play these files with KMPlayer without any problems. 

Thank you for uploading this dude, I hope you do all the seasons :D "
,9525.hondaman,2011-08-12T21:11Z,downloading now cant wait to watch been awhile since i have seen this show
,You_Muppet,2012-07-19T06:37Z,"Thanks for the great torrent. A=8, V=7.

Are the subs hardcoded? There's only the .mkv file in each folder/episode so I'm guessing so.

Much respect to all the seeders. Ta."
