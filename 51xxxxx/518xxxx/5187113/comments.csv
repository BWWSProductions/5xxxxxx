,h1pp0,2009-12-28T21:49Z,"Thanks for uploading this basho, I have a few questions. 

Are the mpg files you posted captured in HD?

Also the smaller ones are in avi, do these use the xvid codec?

I unfortunately found your uploads just now so I won't be able to download the mpg version. I will for the next basho! (hopefully you will post them as well)"
,Bum_Fluff,2009-12-31T08:34Z,"I convert from MPG to Xvid using quickmedia convert.  Unfortunately, the original isn't in HD, just the regular signal available in North America.  

I might just post in only MPG next time."
