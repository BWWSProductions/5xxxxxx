Hey everyone! Another month and another Cosmic Refractions! At the new time of every 3rd Wednesday 2-3 GMT, this month I have some banging tunes to share with you all. As always, we begin with the melodics â€“ which gradually get harder with fantastic remixes from Line of Sight and Oleg Zubkov on upcoming release â€œMysteryâ€ on my Digital Sensation UK label. Some fantastic tracks follow by LuQas and Llupa which really work in some energy, and then we break slightly with a quick switch to some old skool-esque b-boy funk sounds. From here the peaks never let up with some absolutely banging electro breaks stormers, which will have you moving - guaranteed! 

All of the tracks are (or will be in the future) available to download so please support if you like what you hear. Olegâ€™s remix of â€œMysteryâ€ (along with the original mix and Helbot remix) will be available everywhere on Dec 15th. 

As always feedback is appreciated so please get in touch if you like what you hear :)
