Four mountain ridges, a canyon, a copious green valley, a steep rock, a jungle, veld - and an almost punchline ending. The ninth studio album by Pearl Jam , 'Backspacer' is the first one since 'Yield' that has been produced by Brendan Oâ€™Brien.

1. "Gonna See My Friend": Pearl Jam as you expect them today: straight rock, strong lyrics, hands-on and aggressive. Rolling Stone Magazine discussed this in their Feb. 19, 2009 article: One song, a garage-y composition by Vedder, repeats the lyric â€œsee my friendsâ€ over Stooges-meet-the-Who power chords and loose, Johnny Thunders-inspired lead guitar from Mike McCready.

2. "Got Some": Also rock, also straight and almost angry but with some distinctive guitar licks by Mike McCready. Track was performed live on Tonight Show With Conan Oâ€™Brien June 1, 2009

3. "The Fixer": The first highlight. A tight, almost classic rock tune but clever at the same time. Slightly odd, and with cool vocal melodies and rhythms this track is a mini anthem. (Performed for Target commercial shot by Cameron Crowe at The Showbox in Seattle May 29, 2009)

4. "Johnny Guitar": Fortunately not as bland as the title suggests. Also a rocker, but with a remarkable amount of lyrics and sincerity. Grows above average but still a very classical tune.

5. "Just Breathe": The first break and a moment to take some breath. Lovely acoustic ballad. The fingers fly over the fret board, an unobtrusive string arrangement and lyrics about love - mature, wonderful, terrific vocal delivery.

6. "Amongst The Waves": Finally thereâ€™s not only pushing forward but in all directions with a song that tries to reach the sky. The positive build-up reminds of â€œGiven To Flyâ€ as well as the fact that you just canâ€™t point at the root of â€œAmongst The Wavesâ€ .

7. "Unthought Known": First very climatic, then a passionate mid-tempo rock song. A slightly blurry ending but still more palpable than anything off the last album.

8. "Supersonic": The obligatory wild song that you can find on every Pearl Jam album since 'Vitalogy'. Almost cheerful, driven by Matt Cameronâ€™s fast pace, in the beginning reminiscent of Soundgarden. But Soundgarden were better at creating those angular bundles of energy. (Though likely unrelated, the Seattle Supersonics were an NBA basketball team from 1967-2008. The word itself means â€œfaster than the speed of soundâ€, which coincidentally is the title of the next album track.)

9. "Speed Of Sound": Exotic. A strange pop song with a different sound than the rest of the album and its clear-cut production. Still: piano, tingling, suspenseâ€¦

10. "Force Of Nature": A rock song like a Pearl Jam concert: An innocent beginning, but it grows naturally and expands and has you totally in its grip before you know it.

11. "The End": The second acoustic song and to be taken literally. One of the strongest ballads by the band since a long time, amongst other things because its urgency manifests in Vedderâ€™s vocals. Even the end of the end needs a worthy ending
