Mark Twain - The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

Perhaps the best-loved nineteenth-century American novel, Mark Twainâ€™s tale of boyhood adventure overflows with comedy, warmth, and slapstick energy. It brings to life and array of irresistible charactersâ€”the awesomely self-confident Tom, his best buddy Huck Finn, indulgent Aunt Polly, and the lovely, beguiling Beckyâ€”as well as such unforgettable incidents as whitewashing a fence, swearing an oath in blood, and getting lost in a dark and labyrinthine cave. Below Tom Sawyerâ€™s sunny surface lurk hints of a darker reality, of youthful innocence and naÃ¯vetÃ© confronting the cruelty, hypocrisy, and foolishness of the adult worldâ€”a theme that would become more pronounced in Twainâ€™s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite such suggestions, Tom Sawyer remains Twainâ€™s joyful ode to the endless possibilities of childhood.
