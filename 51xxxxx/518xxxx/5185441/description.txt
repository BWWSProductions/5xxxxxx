The debut album from Bridges Of Light - "Live For What's Beautiful"

This Canadian band was formed by Jason Moon in the summer of 2008 and released their first disc "Live For What's Beautiful" in January of 2009. They are currently recording the follow-up, "Another Way To Exist", which is scheduled for release in spring 2010.

Inspired by the writings of Terence McKenna and Alan Watts and others, the band states that it's mission is to "explore consciousness and eat chicken wings". Curiously, over half of the songs on "Live For What's Beautiful" are older Jason Moon compositions dealing with lost love, bitterness, bad religion, and uncertainty. The band's website (www.bridgesoflight.ca) states that these were included to show Moon's musical journey from a self-centred world view to a more enlightened one where beauty and love are the reality.

The album is Beatlesque in that there are several musical styles coming in to play. From the jangly acoustic folkiness of songs like "Your One And Only" and "Sail Away From Your Smile" through scorching blues rock numbers like "The Shadows Know" (currently riding high on the charts of GarageBand.com) to the psychedelic climax of "Ocean Of Consciousness", the ever-present harmonies, skilled guitar work, and tight rhythm section tie everything together seamlessly.
