,logros13,2009-11-30T16:17Z,"yeah i have it, i even have stuff for a [complete+] release (artbook and special). :)

starting pre-releases prep now, torrent will probably be up in about an hour."
,logros13,2009-11-30T17:02Z,"hmm, upon deeper examination its seems it will need far more pre-release work then i initially thought so i'l have to push back the release time, i cant give a new estimate right now but it will be out today at least."
