,abhi_v45,2009-11-30T12:30Z,Will ISO also include Recover Disk???
,VISailor,2009-11-30T17:05Z,Great job!
,rotelli,2009-12-01T13:48Z,"Il cd  Ă¨ di boot il keygen fa il suo lavoro anche se visto da nis come virus euristico sospicius.cloud come tutti i keygen core.
Ottimo lavoro comunque."
,mstaley,2009-12-02T21:04Z,"keygen does NOT work, getting this error message ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions do access the item"". So a useless download unless you got a working key or keygen from somewhere else."
,-BeDLaM-,2009-12-06T01:39Z,"this isnt multi language. BUT it is the full blown version.

for those who wish to install this in English, just extract the ISO into a folder, you will see a folder called ""autorun""
in that folder you will see a file called ""AUTORUN.INI"" edit it with notepad or notepad++ or any editor, you will see the line that says,..
Language = es

Just change that to say,...
Language = en

save the file and then use any iso program and recreate the iso!
Then you can install this in english!

There is another torrent just uploaded yesterday that is version 15, but its only the trial version with a keygen. This torrent is the full blown retail CD.
Thats why I suggest using my method."
,-BeDLaM-,2009-12-06T04:57Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5199252/Norton_Ghost_15.rar

I repacked this to be english as it was spanish only. theres the link for the english version
This is the full blown version, NOT the trial with crack"
,widgi,2009-12-06T05:16Z,"I can't get the keygen.exe to work. Every time I extract it somewhere then go there to run it, windows says it can't find any such file. It shows up on the CD that I burned but the first time I tried to run it, Mcafee Antivirus said it had a trojron and i haven't been able to run it since."
,-BeDLaM-,2009-12-06T15:54Z,"wdigi:  Mcafee deleted the file.
its a false positive. when you try to run it from the CD, mcafee will stop it from running.
alot of people install their virus software without paying attention to the options. you must have done a normal install of mcafee and you have it set to ""block possible harmful programs""
turn off mcafee before you try to run the keygen and then start it backup afterwords."

,widgi,2009-12-07T04:46Z,"BeDLaM-
Thanks, I figured that out just after I posted my last comment. I shut of Mcafee and restored the file it deleted and it ran fine then."

and thank you "
,datakurs,2009-12-20T22:42Z,I have the same problem. It seems there is no executable file to start the program. Any ideas?
,Vorloc,2009-12-23T17:54Z,Avast Anti Virus found 'Win32:Malware-gen' in tihs file.
,zomomo,2009-12-25T12:39Z,"AVG 9.0.722 found ""Trojan horse:Generic15.BLDM"". Looks like there is some doggy code in it."
,johnroberts,2010-01-05T01:23Z,"This release works as expected.

With some manual editing of the ISO
(as described by BedLam) it is easily converted
to a standard English install.
The new fancy-smancy GUI
(compared to the good old Spartan
Ghost 2003) looks like the current, usual,
crappy Symantec bloatware.

Keygen was scanned using fully
updated (04/01/2010) 
Microsoft Security Essentials
and Jotti's online file scanner.
(http://virusscan.jotti.org)
True that 8/20 a/v programs
report it as a virus
(A-Squared,Avast!,AVG,CPsecure
G-Data,IKARUS, QuickHeal,SOPHOS), 
but the rest DO NOT.
(ArcaVir,AntiVir,BitDefender,
ClamAV, Dr.WEB, F-Prot,
F-Secure, KAV, NOD32, Panda,
VBA32, VirusBuster)

When editing the ISO take care
not to destroy the bootable part
(ISO works as a bootable rescue disc)
The ISO (as-is) has been tested to
cold image a HDD on a USB stick
with a full disk restore afterwards.
(WinXP Pro/SP3)

Thus, provided a serial is available,
one may use this directly for imaging
w/o installing alltogether.

The pluses over Ghost 2003 & 11.5
are better support of external
USB devices and network drives.


======================

Tks to the uploader!"
,1605mike,2010-01-06T04:25Z,I give up. Where is the backup recovery disk? I have the program running but I can not find any clue as to how to create a recovery disk.
,Darkling6,2010-01-12T00:06Z,"Just to clear up a few issues people are having

There is no need for a seperate 'recovery' Boot CD like in the past. This iso IS the Boot CD + Install files. Simply burn it to disk and boot from it.

The Keygen does work, just deactivate your virus checker to use it. Its probably the case that keygen.exe is marked as a potential malicious fime name.

This is the Spanish version but with one easy tweak it becomes english. Simply browse into the iso file (use something like iso buster or 7zip to extract it) and browse into the 'autorun' folder. Open and edit the language settings in autorun.ini to read language = en for english. Simple.

Thanks for the upload OP."
,nirgoen,2010-01-22T01:07Z,Thanks
,nirgoen,2010-01-22T01:11Z,Thanks. I hope it will work for me
,nirgoen,2010-01-22T02:16Z,"And I did it as -BeDLaM said. I recreated the ISO with imgburn. I have installed it and it works like a charm. If someone needs the english iso version, just tell me.

also Many Thanks for the uploader"
,seedmor,2010-01-23T09:23Z,"Muchas Gracious to the uploader and the helpful commentators. This dude gives it a 10.

,tzepx,2010-02-01T09:42Z,"i've got this error for recovery boot cd: after loading a couple of minutes, it gives this error: ""Can not find file x:\windows\shell\AutoTest.cmd"". click ok = reboot

anybody tried to use recovery till now?"
,augen1025,2010-02-25T03:04Z,Great Torrent. Thank you.
,defiancee,2010-04-01T22:39Z,"To install this with english after burning, skip the autorun part and just manually start the setup.

I did this by going here:

My computer > F: (meaning your dvd drive) > Right click and Explore 

Inside the DVD there will be a folder called INSTALL go into that and start setup.exe"
,benhuidrom,2010-04-10T08:03Z,"Thank ""50c3nt"" for uploading this wonderful program.
Like -BeDLaM- said I followed the instruction and installation and backup was fine
But the recovery part didnt worked for me. I burned the edited file(english). tried 3 cds but window7 just start normally even though the bootup setup was to Cd 

Could someone please help me"
,T2G,2010-04-18T07:28Z,"Thanks to the uploader. This is definitely clean BUT...
Beware, Norton Ghost 15 has a serious error that stops it working. It's been known about by Norton since November 2009 but is yet to be resolved... The error is so serious, it can often prevent the program from being uninstalled, even by Norton tech support. For more info, go here:
http://community.norton.com/t5/Other-Norton-Products/quot-Snapshot-error-1-quot-after-quot-Failed-to-have-success/td-p/176885

I'm moving to Acronis..."
,poolpee,2010-04-25T06:19Z,"This is clean. 

Tips: 
1. Don't bother burning this to CD. Just used winrar (or whatever) to extract the ISO to a folder. 

2.  Browse to the 'Install' folder and run setup.exe. You'll get English.

3. Don't enter reg key yet; Start in 30-day demo mode. Use to LiveUpdate to get the ltest version (which is MUCH less buggy). Then enter the reg key from the keygen.

4. Run the 'LightsOut Restore' wizard afterwards so you don't need a boot CD. 

Doing it this way will get you a better solution than Acronis."
,tomwlms,2010-05-14T16:53Z,"I am having trouble installing this. It seems to install fine, but after restarting it says something about not having appropriate permissions. I have tried using different programs to extract and create the ISO. Run as Administrator etc. etc. OS is W7 Ultimate x64 and UAC is turned off. Any ideas?"

Thank u uploader,... Working fine...."
,deepandhard,2012-03-24T22:55Z,I did not install this on my win7 x64 rig. It is a bootable disk. I burned the image to a cdr and booted from it. Then I used the backup function to backup my system harddrive to external harddrive via usb connection. I did not have to enter a key or use the key generator. The menus were in english.  Thanks for the upload and long live the Pirate Bay!
