I clicked a button within the program to create the rescue CD/DVD and it sent me to a download link on Paragon's site but my key was detected as invalid and I wasn't able to download the ISO but the program is still working fine, so far.  Will try and watch out for features that try and log me into the site from here on out.  

Thanks again for making this available TVTeam."
