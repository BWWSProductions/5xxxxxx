This rip has 2 audio tracks, with Spanish as the first. You need the VLC player or equivalent to switch to audio track 2 if you want original English.

Subtitles are not in English as stated above, but in Russian (Cyrillic alphabet)."

Anyone else not having English audio/subs? (I'm new to this so I might have done something wrong.)

BTW, there is another torrent with Spanish as 1st track and Russian subs, here:

Maybe that's what you're referring to."
