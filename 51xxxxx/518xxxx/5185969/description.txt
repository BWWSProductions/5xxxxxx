Why is there so much anti-Americanism in the Muslim world? Who are the extremists and how do Muslims feel about them? What do Muslims like and dislike about the West? What do Muslim women really want?



Inside Islam: What a Billion Muslims Really Think, a new documentary film from Unity Productions Foundation, explores these questions by using the Gallup World Poll, which interviewed tens of thousands of Muslims in over 35 countries with predominantly Muslim or significant Muslim populations.
