,bikesexual,2010-10-01T03:59Z,It is the DOS Box version of the game.
,silverchloride,2010-10-02T06:28Z,"inside the .app package there is a Doxbox emulator. 
follow the instructions given by the emulater and mount your local War2 folder to whatever virtual drive dos emulater is in. you can run most dos game here."

,chickenman123456,2011-04-11T02:52Z,I have one major and one minor problem. I can't save my progress when I try in game. Also the scroll speed is way too fast even when I customize it in game options.    
,bloomart,2011-06-15T08:41Z,"Can somebody explain to me in detail what I need to do to torrent a file like this? 

I have looked at a bunch of other advice. So far, I have downloaded uTorrent AND Transmission and attempted multiple files of the few games I want. 

I need to know more about this whole seeding thing, and more about how I can actually get it to download. On every link there are several comments saying things like ""Great Torrent!"" for some people, and then a few other people will ask questions like me. None of the previous advice has worked for me. 

PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU."
