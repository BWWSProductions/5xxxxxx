[T],SgtRlee,2010-09-10T21:07Z,"there are 2 peers at 99.9% completion, but not able to get to 100%. I just wanted to let you know that if you changed anything in this torrent on your harddrive, like the text or name of a file, you will not finish until you put it back to the original state and then do a ""Force Recheck"" hope this helps ~.~ "

Be back to reseed some more when i can tonight. I reseed all my torrents when needed so keep trying :) "
[T],SgtRlee,2011-01-06T22:52Z,reseeding :) though this might take a few days since i'm also reseeding other no seed torrents i posted. Please stay on after completion so i might start up some of these other older venture bros/lock n load torrents again.
[T],SgtRlee,2011-01-07T20:19Z,"I was able to reseed a few of you last night from 0% to 99.9%, But thats where there is a problem, and it's with these first torrents i posted that have NO additional Trackers added to them by me like i do now, so they are all doing this same non comp-letion 99.9% bullshit :( 

The good news is that i got you to that 99.9% and you will have a complete .mkv video file and picture files, but no readme, which is fine since i copied the readme to this webpage when i posted these so..."
