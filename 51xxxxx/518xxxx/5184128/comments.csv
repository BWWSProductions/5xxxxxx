,thedeadredhead,2009-11-28T22:54Z,Thanks very much. This is the Latin American version I take it? The European Spanish version of levels 4 & 5 doesn't appear to have been released yet.
[T],VasiaZozulia,2009-11-28T23:05Z,"@thedeadredhead
Yes, this is Spanish (Latin America)"
,danmanchester,2009-11-29T22:50Z,"Fantastic! Thanks very much VasiaZozulia, I've downloaded your other RS torrents...I'll save these 4&5 levels for future when the latest RS has a patch fix.

I couldn't get it to work with Win7 x64 so am using version 3.2.11 for now.

Much appreciated :)"
,ramblerguru,2009-11-30T19:04Z,"Vasia, budlaska pidkazhi!
I have a problem. I have RS V3 Levels 1-3, works fine. When I try to add Levels 4,5 it gives me an Error 3321. I have Win7x32. What should I do?"
,Aubaine141,2009-12-02T07:43Z,"I saw this, and.... I jizzed a bit."
,thepiraterockstheboat,2009-12-02T23:15Z,In the comments it says works with mac....I was wondering if its mac compatible.
,ZAXYY,2009-12-04T23:06Z,"You are a thief!!!
It was me who post this torrent!
You also copied the text I wrote!!!!
SHAME ON YOU!"
,malmalmal,2009-12-09T19:25Z,i've been learning Spanish(spain) is it ok to  continue on learning Spanish in Latin for 4 and 5 plz answer
,00seven,2009-12-10T01:34Z,"@malmalmal:

For the most part you should be fine.  There are quite a few diferences, however, that may throw you for a loop.

Wikipedia has a decent summary of some of the differences: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language

Here's another summary of some of the differences: http://spanish.about.com/cs/historyofspanish/f/varieties.htm

Having said that, there are currently no cracks to get level 4 and 5 working.  So, you won't be able to use them right now anyways."
,FillmoreHoes,2009-12-10T10:13Z,French 4 & 5? pleeeeeeeease!
,Novawire,2009-12-12T10:48Z,Where are the Audio Companions for Levels 4 and 4?
,Novawire,2009-12-12T10:50Z,There is a crack for Version 3.45. It was released yesterday. You can find it very easily at this website. Anyone know where I can get the Audio Companions for Spanish Latin America Levels 4 and 5?
,xxx-yyy-zzz,2009-12-13T15:41Z,"There is a great post on RS3 on mechodownload

All languages P2P available so far are there

Just look for it"
,kaiserfranzjosephdererste,2009-12-14T02:23Z,"""There is a crack for Version 3.45. It was released yesterday.""
Is the crack working for Mac too? Where can I find the new crack?
Thanks."
[T],VasiaZozulia,2009-12-14T11:19Z,"~kaiserfranzjosephdererste
Is the crack working for Mac too? -> YES.
Where can I find the new crack? ->http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack"
,Eggre,2009-12-15T14:58Z,"This along with the working crack is proof that there is a God (of Filesharing) looking after us!   

Another uploader (123Dutch) has also added the expensive program Fluenz Spanish 1 & 2 finally -- a perfectly working version!

But can someone get us Fluenz Spanish 3 now!

Super Cheers!"
,Bendependent,2009-12-15T18:28Z,I have been waiting and requesting for this since March! Muchas Gracias!
,Bendependent,2009-12-17T05:50Z,I thought after I struggled downloading and installing and everything else the first time with levels1-3 that this time would be a breeze. I was terribly mistaken. Does the crack reeally work? Everytime i mount the languages on Daemon the thing says It can't find any languages. Do I need to winrar the iso files or something. I followded a tutorial on yo0utube and did everything to the t but no luck. I've been working on this shit for the last 4 hours. I hope that maybe after some rest I will tackle it again. Can anybody offer any suggestions.
,Bendependent,2009-12-17T05:52Z,Oh yeah by the way! Levels 1-3 are no longer loaded!
,eldiab21,2010-01-05T20:29Z,You mf'n rock !!
,DuhChick,2010-01-07T05:54Z,"How do you activate these?  I have a legit copy of Rosetta Stone 3.4.5, and I can't get any language packs to activate so I can't do anything beyond the first two modules.  The patch somebody posted for the problem doesn't work because it's trying to replace a dll that doesn't exist.  How do I fix it?  Help?  Is there another licensing file in this version that needs to be patched?"
,jimbob88jt,2010-01-28T16:10Z,"Does anyone know where to find GERMAN L4 and L5? 

And thanks again VasiaZozulia. "
,penthe,2010-02-02T12:41Z,"I like to see Rosetta Stone Spanish (Spain) 4 & 5 and not the Latin one, there is to much difference.

I find this torrent name misleading :("
,romulo212,2010-02-05T19:20Z,"Please.
Can you send the link or torrent for French Level 4 & 5?"
,eldiab21,2010-02-09T14:16Z,thanks so much for this !! 
,brad12887,2010-03-01T00:58Z,"I've downloaded a RS application previously in which it allowed me to add versions 1,2, and 3.  I downlaoded VasiaZozulia's levels 4 and 5 and it wouldn't let me add it because it said I needed an update.  I downloaded the update offered by someone on one of VasiaZozulia's comment threads and it allowed me to add his levels 4 and 5, but I can't activate them, it shows levels 1-3 are still activated, but not sure how to activate levels 4 and 5.  Can someone please instruct me?"
,TompsonLocal,2010-03-07T17:30Z,"@VasiaZozulia
Where's the Spanish version of Spanish at?!
Do you think you'll beable to get it any time soon?

Thanks! Great work!"
,dark_jedi24,2010-03-20T15:14Z,Has anyone seen French levels 4 & 5?  merci (gracias)
,casino9876,2010-04-11T21:40Z,"any chance you can get hold of the Spanish level 4 and 5? this is the Latin version but thanks for the up anyway..

i know there's not a lot of difference, a bit similar to American English and English lol but iv still done the level 1-3 of Spanish and would love it if u could get hold of the lvl 4 n 5 VasiaZozulia :)"
,bitemybag,2010-08-01T22:06Z,"im having the same trouble, message reads, This language content requires an update to rosetta stone, any help would be greatly appreciated"
,MichelleS1985,2010-09-04T14:35Z,Do I need an activation code?  What is it?
,dorkenstein909,2010-10-10T00:07Z,"Im so confused! when I try adding levels 4 and 5, it always tells me I need to update Rosetta stone, but Im running the latest version! wtf!"
,ShinSonJazrin,2011-01-10T04:21Z,"Same here, anyone have a workaround for this?"
,cheesecarrot,2011-01-20T23:27Z,">ShinSonJazrin
Try installing levels 4 & 5 before cracking the program. Then perform the crack.

That means you'll have to have a copy of the uncracked files as backup for when you want to install more Level 4,5 languages."
,rugburn11,2011-02-19T04:00Z,Works perfect 100 % with RS 3.4.7... thank you
,Sonic98,2011-03-01T15:25Z,I was on 3.3.5 and I had the same problem saying I needed to update RS. I did not find a crack for 3.4.7. but I found 3.4.5. It works but I cannot edit course settings. There is no option
