Spanish pronunciation and spelling are regular and predictable.
There are two categories of Spanish nouns: masculine and feminine.
Donâ€™t be surprised if you see sentences without subjects. Rosetta Stone teaches you to identify who is speaking or who is being spoken about through the form of the verb.
Spanish has two verbs that mean â€˜to be.â€™ One is used for characteristics that are more permanent, and one for characteristics that are more temporary.
Youâ€™ll notice that many Spanish words use accent marks, which indicate where to put stress.
Sometimes an accent distinguishes one word from another that is identical except for the mark. For example: esta and estÃ¡.
The letter Ã± is distinct from n in its pronunciation. The letter ll is also pronounced differently than two single lâ€™s.
Spanish has both formal and informal ways to address others, depending on the age of the speaker and her relationship to the person being addressed.
