This is the FINAL DVD-5 ISO Reproduction of How Difficult Can This Be? The F.A.T. City Workshop a 70 minute VHS by Richard Lavoie produced in 1989

F.A.T. stands for Frustration, Anxiety, and Tension and that's exactly what you'll experience as the inspiring workshop facilitator Richard Lavoie and his unique program brings you into the world and everyday life of a person suffering with learning disabilities

A series of striking simulations emulate the daily experience of the learning disabled. Teachers, social workers, parents, and workshop participants, reflect upon how the workshop changed their approach to learning disabilities.

The classroom can be an intimidating place for the learning disabled.  This video is so similar to my childhood experiences that I cant help but get choked up every time i watch it.
