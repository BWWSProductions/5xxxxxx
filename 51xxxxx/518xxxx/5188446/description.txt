     Paramore revealed today on their official Website that their brand new album Brand New Eyes will be released on September 29th. As Rock Daily previously reported, Hayley Williams and Co. worked with American Idiot producer Rob Cavallo on the new disc. â€œWe made a record that is exactly what we set out to make,â€ Williams said of the follow-up to their smash Riot! on the bandâ€™s LiveJournal page back in April. â€œThereâ€™s fast, thereâ€™s slow, and in betweenâ€¦ happy, angry, desperate and over it. And I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s real.â€ The albumâ€™s cover art, featuring a dismembered butterfly, is also posted on the bandâ€™s official site.

    First single â€œIgnoranceâ€ is out July 7th, but those Web-savvy Paramore fans have already found a 30-second preview of the track â€” and the singleâ€™s cover art â€” over at Amazon.com. July 7th is also the first day fans can begin pre-ordering the album and get the â€œIgnoranceâ€ ringtone.

    â€œIgnoranceâ€ is a fitting title for the albumâ€™s first single, as Williams told Rolling Stone in December, â€œI have a lot to say this time around, and thereâ€™s a lot of things I thought I knew that I was absolutely wrong about.â€ So, after pleading â€œIgnorance,â€ Williams is now seeing everything with Brand New Eyes.
