,jontegrabben,2009-12-02T10:26Z,"theRealKarmine: Are you from USA or just stupid? Our language contains similiar words from many languages, as does every language....
Have you never heard of the word ""Smorgasboard""......  :)"
,ferox21,2009-12-15T15:03Z,"jontegrabben: Strunta i de dumma amerikanerna. De flesta har nog inte vett nog till att förstå att det finns fler på jorden än dem. 

the RealKarmine: Get an education!"

,crazymofo,2009-12-29T00:38Z,"theRealKarmine: haha, seriously? I guess u don't know we write drama and thriller too just as u do.. The words don't belong to u my friend, so go fuck yourself!
Eller som man sier på norsk: Dra til helvette! 

btw: thanks for the torrent, heard alot of good things about this movie (Y)"
,crazymofo,2009-12-29T15:06Z,"good quality, audio and video. 
swedish texting inprinted on the film, but it's no prob for me;) 
As far as I have heard it's not an normal viruz movie. It's more about what ppl are willing to do than gore and zombies. I'm looking foreward to see this one, I hope it's a breath of fresh air. Thanks again."

You said ""Ignore the stupid Americans. Most are probably not savvy enough to understand that there are more languages than theirs on Earth.""

I ask you not to judge all of us based on our most ignorant and arrogant users and in return I will not judge all of you based on YOUR most arrogant and ignorant internet users. Thanks. 

Also thanks to the UL I've been looking for this and the quality is really good. "
,leontyne,2010-12-18T10:00Z,"I apologize for theRealKarmine. Unfortunately, intelligence isn't a requirement for using the internets. :-/ Just think of them as the idiot cousin we keep locked in the attic so they don't bite the guests. Still, don't think we're all that ethnocentric."
,6Qubed,2011-06-20T18:01Z,"To my comrades from Sweden:

Hello from the United States. We do not claim theRealKarmine as one of our own. Do with him as you please.

A word of friendly advice, however; Don't bother dropping any money on lube. I'm sure a tough guy like him can take it. ;)"
