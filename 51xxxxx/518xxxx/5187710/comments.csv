I'll keep seeding. 

Downloading at 12 kb/s, are you kidding me?

I just downloaded another movie at 300 kb/s."
,kght22,2010-09-06T06:12Z,"great quality for what it is, but it is NOT 1080p, the resolution has been reduced to something similar but maybe a little higher than dvd resolution. an excellent download if you want a full quality dvd copy with 5.1 sound this is your deal, if you want real 1080p, dream on. i do belive that this was taken from a real 1080, or atleast 720p copy, but this is neither. it is excellent though"
,hauntnut,2010-11-09T07:45Z,"@ kght22: 

I don't understand how you can say that this is not 1080p resolution. It is, in fact, 1080p. I think that you are confusing resolution with picture quality: sure, this isn't going to have the high bit-rates that a real Blu-Ray disc is capable of containing, but for my money (or lack thereof, why else would I be here), rips like these are a Godsend for those of us who can't afford to upgrade our DVDs with an overpriced disc. In terms of quality, the only thing I have noticed when doing a direct comparison between a file such as this and an actual source disc is that the resulting rip is slightly darker, but in terms of depth, clarity, color, and smoothness, these rips just can't be beat. Thanks to the uploaders for all their hard work, and keep at it! We need you!"
