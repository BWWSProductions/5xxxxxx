2009 release from the Electronic artist also known for his work as Plug and Wagon Christ. We Hear You is a genre-defying record that combines his idiosyncratic samples, sweetly strange melody, big bass and sloppy drums. On the album, Vibert connects the dots between Terry Riley, Dubstep Bass, Techno and Hip Hop. 13 tracks.
