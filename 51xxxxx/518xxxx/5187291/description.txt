It is very weird for an ordinary guy like Sutin when he finds many females in town
suddenly pregnant in one night and deliver the baby in another day! Amazingly, all
the babies exactly look alike him and grow up faster than normal kids. Now, Sutin
begins to find out this strange event with the help from a crazy doctor. It seems
Sutin is not an ordinary guy anymore.
