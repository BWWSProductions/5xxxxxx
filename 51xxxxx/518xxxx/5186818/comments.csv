,xzeron,2009-12-02T16:48Z,Seed plix ^^ i'm longing for wow 2.4.3 server's :D
,Thidan,2009-12-03T15:49Z,I'm seeding 24/7. Although my ISP is shit. So my UL is at like 250kb. But I'm doing my best!
,jama1001,2009-12-03T20:23Z,"is this wow US or EU?
ty "
,Thidan,2009-12-03T22:02Z,"It's EU. But you can use it for both. The only difference on live ervers = what realmlist you used. On pvt, it doesn't matter at all.
And a shout out to people who get this down. Please seed for a day or so, it really helps."
,jama1001,2009-12-04T00:33Z,whats happening with dl? stuck at 3kb with 86% already downloaded :x
,Saxor_ftw,2009-12-04T12:48Z,The DL has stopped now. Dling with 0.1 KB/S for the last 12 hours. Was dling with 1.3MB/s whole yesterday.
,Saxor_ftw,2009-12-04T13:02Z,Dling with 1KB/S Uploading with 1.3 MB/s ... dont really understand it.
,xzeron,2009-12-04T13:45Z,"ahh, this is so slow.. i've been downloading for the past five day's... and the dl rate is 0,1 - 0,5 -_- please seed.. i'm at 88,7% done ^^"
,xzeron,2009-12-04T13:49Z,btw thank you Thidan ;) for the great download. looking forward to it.
,Thidan,2009-12-05T12:20Z,"Really sorry for not seeding the past days.
Had a HUGE thunderstorm which basicly struck my computer (But thankfully not the HDD, just the processor) and I got a new one today and just got it plugged in."
,Saxor_ftw,2009-12-05T14:34Z,Perfect timing. :P Just deleted the folder + torrent. have to dl 88% again ^^
,Saxor_ftw,2009-12-05T14:36Z,Whats up with the Down speed now then. Used to dl @ 1.2 mb/s
,xzeron,2009-12-05T20:13Z,"ohh, hehe:P well, it's working now^^ i'm dl'ing for 200 - 300 kb/s.. thank you again thidan, i will seed for a while ^^"

,sinkill02,2009-12-24T16:35Z,Hey i have this downloaded but little confused on the extracting part. do i extract all 83 files? or do i just have to do the one? i only did one so far and got a full wow folder with the patch but when i go to run it with my realmlist.wtf changed i log in and it says my something like invalid game version. can someone please help me thanks
,morackis,2009-12-27T08:49Z,"So I've extracted and set up a game account with a private server. When I try to sign in Wow (after having chenged reallist) to the one my server said, it says its unable to validate the game version. I'm not in the EU but you said it doesn't matter. Am I missing something?"
,tsundaere,2010-01-16T14:30Z,"Please seed after downloading guys , i am seeding for a time."
,iceracer454,2010-01-24T10:32Z,"no. the only real emu hacker for wow comes from deathsoft, google it. 

dont trust random pages you get linked to, especially on torrent sites"
