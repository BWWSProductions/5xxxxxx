Chickenfoot is the debut studio album by American hard rock band Chickenfoot, released on June 5, 2009 in Europe and the US. The first-pressing of the album was packaged with exclusive "heat sensitive" artwork that revealed an image when touched or exposed to heat above 84 degrees Fahrenheit.

On March 20, 2009, the band released two songs, "Soap on a Rope" and "Down The Drain" on their official website. The band's first single, "Oh Yeah", was released to radio stations nationwide, as well as on their official website, on April 13, 2009.

On October 7, 2009, the official Chickenfoot website revealed that the album had been certified Gold.

A deluxe edition with a DVD was released in the UK on October 26, 2009 and the US, exclusively at Best Buy stores, on November 1, 2009.

Chickenfoot is an American hard rock supergroup, comprising ex-Van Halen members Sammy Hagar (vocals) and Michael Anthony (bass), solo musician Joe Satriani (guitar) and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. The band released their self-titled debut album, Chickenfoot, on June 5, 2009. Regarding the band's status as a "supergroup", vocalist Sammy Hagar states: "Weâ€™re not a supergroup, we like hanging out together and the music is a bonus. We just happen to be in other groups."

While the band's name and logo reference a disparaging term used to describe the peace symbol, the "footprint of the American chicken", bassist Michael Anthony asserts that the name originated from initial jam sessions between Hagar, Smith and himself: "there are three talons on a chickenâ€™s foot and there [were] three of us."
