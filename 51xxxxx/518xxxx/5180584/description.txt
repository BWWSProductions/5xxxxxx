Hi,

This is my first torrent so please be gentle ;-)

I didn't rip the original video and I'm not taking credit to it. I found this as two mp4 files but because the second part was hard to find I decided to join them into one file and share. Since avi container has wider support than mp4 I thought it's better to use avi.

Hope you'll enjoy it. 

Technical details: 
I kept the same quality settings:
Video: 720 x 480, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, 29.970, 2000 kbps
Audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 48000Hz,  160 kb/s tot , Stereo
Length: 2:38:14 hrs
Frame rate: 29.970

PS. I'm looking for the following, if anyone has it please share:
- Tony Sweet's Visual Literacy: Photography Workshop
- HDR (High Dynamic Range) Photography Made Easy
- Digital SLR Photography, Show Me How Videos
Or any other good video photography guides

"Oct. 21, 2008 â€“ Nikon is pleased to announce a new DVD that guides viewers on advanced creative lighting techniques under the masterful instruction of award-winning National Geographic Traveler photographer Bob Krist and world renowned photojournalist and lighting expert, Joe McNally. Painting with light is the very definition of photography and this DVD demonstrates why the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS) continues to define the imaginative possibilities available to photographers. 

â€œA Hands-on Guide to Creative Lightingâ€ demonstrates the essentials of lighting techniques that separate exceptional images from everyday pictures. The video will lead viewers through the fundamentals of lighting in the studio with Bob Krist, who is later joined by Joe McNally in a variety of real-world shooting situations faced by many photographers. Shooting at several locations from the dramatic Boston Ballet School to the rustic charm of Gloucester, Mass., Krist and McNally teach viewers how to get the most from their Nikon Speedlights. 

â€œThe basic and advanced lighting techniques demonstrated in this DVD will benefit all levels of photographers and help create lighting schemes that transform an ordinary subject into something spectacular,â€ said Edward Fasano, general manager for marketing, SLR Systems Products at Nikon Inc. â€œBecause of its adaptability and ease of use, Nikon Speedlightsâ€”the heart of the Nikon Creative Lighting System, remain the industry standard for a portable lighting solution that allow photographers to create inspired images in the studio or on location.â€ 

Topics include direction, color and quality of light, Speedlight placement, working with wireless flash, and creative use of alternative flash sync modes. The DVD will also show users how to use the advanced features of their Nikon CLS system, including the SB-800, SB-600, SB-R200 and the new SB-900 Speedlight, as well as the SU-800 Speedlight Commander. 

â€œA Hands-on Guide to Creative Lightingâ€ presented by Nikon School will be available starting November 1, 2008, and can be obtained online at the Nikon Mall (www.nikonmall.com) or at authorized Nikon dealers for an estimated selling price of $39.95.* Running time is approximately 2 hours, 34 minutes.
