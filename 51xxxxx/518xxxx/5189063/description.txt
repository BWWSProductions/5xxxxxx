Today, on one thread, was over-heathed debate because first Dexter ep. 10 appeared as MPEG. "It's bad." one saidâ€¦ 
"Its MPEG quality" was response. 
It sounded like "It's JUST mpeg, and mpeg cannot be better."
Yes, it can. It must be better. â€“ I was thinking. DVDs are MPEG. Transport streams of HDTV are MPEG.
"Bitrate is too small for better quality" has been another argument.
No, bitrate is fine.
"File-size is too small, like XviDâ€¦ it cannot be better" was the answer.
No, file-size is not the problem.
Problem is when someone thinks it knows, and knows squat.
Here is DVD compliant MPEG with 2 ch. AC3 sound.
