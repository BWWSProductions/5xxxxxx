,Jackson.Pa,2009-11-30T10:53Z,oh and btw these removewat's are amazingly good
[V],NoExcuses,2009-11-30T11:30Z,"@Jackson.Pa
RemoveWAT is intended for people that don't have an ""original"" license for W7. If your new laptop comes with W7 why use RemoveWAT or similar? Sooner or later M$ will block it too, so no reason to use it. Anyway, running again RWAT will restore your W7 as it was before, or so says Hazar. In any case, it's always better to make a backup of your original installation on the PC, and create also the Recovery DVDs, as you 'll never know if and when you 'll need them. After making all the safety backups, you can do anything you want, if you screw something you can always go back to the original setup. Always do your tricks on a machine where you are sure to be able to go back to its original state..."
,4rthur,2009-11-30T13:54Z,"Tks, it worked."
,Jackson.Pa,2009-12-01T00:29Z,"no but say i bought a knew laptop with windows vista, and i put windows 7 on and removed the wat, would it void the year warranty of that laptop?"
,Jackson.Pa,2009-12-01T01:45Z,new** i dont normally do stuff like that :s
,4rthur,2009-12-01T05:58Z,"I said it works yesterday, but actually I am still getting the WGA notification saying the software is not genuine in one case: when launching notepad. Not a big issue though after setting the test file association to another editor.

@NoExcuses: maybe you can have a look at this for your next revision ;) . 
Tks anyways."
[V],NoExcuses,2009-12-01T09:20Z,"@4rthur
I've only uploaded it, if you have any problem maybe it's better you do directly on the Hazar's forum and let a message there. Here it's working fine, even if I read that someone goes better with older versions (i.e.  RWAT 1.6), and for someone this doesn't work at all. It looks like it works better on a clean installation, if you were already trying other cracks before this can interfere with the last one.

@Jackson.Pa
Depends on what the laptop producer thinks about, but the warranty is usually related to the HW, the SW can be messed up in many way, a virus or a crash. If it's HW they will repair it, if it's SW they suppose you'll have a backup or you can buy a Recovery DVD from them. I remember HP was selling its first laptops with Vista, telling that they were not supposed to work with XP, no drivers, no nothing. After a year they were selling them with the possibility to ""downgrade"" to XP. They have probably lost a lot of new customers with their choice, for sure they lost me..."
,skilledhavoc,2009-12-02T06:12Z,so i just run this and in 19 days i will still have windows 7? and how will i know if it truely worked?

,Kraz91,2009-12-02T16:33Z,"I got couple questions :P

Does this work fine with the ""Windows 7 Ultimate AIO Activated""? In case it's integrated activator fails at some point.

How do this activator and the integrated activator in ""Windows 7 Ultimate AIO Activated"" differ from each other?

If some activator works say 30 days and then fails, is it possible to activate again with another activator even if the 30day win7 trial has ended?"
[V],NoExcuses,2009-12-02T17:42Z,"@acemp3
This should work on any version of any language of W7, so says Hazar. On mine worked.

@Kraz91
Usually it's better to try a crack on a clean installation, as you can never know how it can conflict with other cracks. Hazar recommends uninstalling any previous crack, but you can always try, if it doesn't work then it's time to reinstall.
Every crack is supposed to work until M$ finds a way to block it, so don't expect to see it working for life. It's like for love, it lasts until it lasts, then it's finished and you have to go and search for another one... ;o)"
,karated,2009-12-03T12:59Z,"It does not seem that MS could manage to block loader activators. Using activators like   7Loader 1.6d by Hazar is perfectly OK.

Reason: Vista is aroud for some three years and loader activators still work perfecly.

Vista and Windows 7 are quite the same.

Only after a Service Pack the old loader does not work.

Then a modified version of loader activator is made. You just uninstall the old and install the new activator."

,Kraz91,2009-12-10T02:54Z,"Thanks for your response NoExcuses.

It seems that the ""AIO Activated one"" is just using a master key of some sort, and some people (using the AIO version) that managed to get their windows 'unactivated' got it working again with this :)

However I was just wondering that, If I got all the automatic updates off and windows defender off, can microsoft anyhow 'block' this crack? "
,p49,2009-12-13T03:55Z,"Tips for a safe and reliable system: from (http://forums.mydigitallife.info/showthread.php?t=7126)

    * Do not install anything that modify system files, including (but not limited to) Chew-WGA, RemoveWAT from Hazar, Toolkit 1.8 from Orbit30, and other similar tools that imply changing the way the operating system works by disabling or modifying main features (such as activation modules) or crucial characteristics (such as edition integrity) also known as ""Frankenbuild monster"".
    * When downloading a software from the Internet, always check its authenticity by matching its HASH with the one provided by its official editor (e.g. Microsoft).
    * Only download updates for Windows through Windows Update or from Microsoft.com. Do not install leaked updates, since there are no HASHES available from Microsoft's website, nor any certitude that these updates will be ever released officially, nor any guarantee that it's not malicious software.
    * Do not run .exe files found on P2P networks, forums, blogs, or unknown websites. Always perform a virus check when you don't trust the download source. "
[V],NoExcuses,2009-12-13T09:17Z,"@p49
The safest way to activate your W7/Vista and to receive all updates is to use a legit license. If you don't have it you can try with Loaders , OEM Bioses and so on. Hazar is already spreading a Loader, but he has also done this little crack that seems to work fine, so why don't give it a try?
Obviously everything, and I mean EVERYTHING downloaded from P2P sites or anywhere in internet must be tested before using it. Even Loaders can be mangled by bad guys, I've already found many of them around. This one comes from Hazar's Forum and I suppose it is clean."

Haven't rebooted yet though... Hope it lasts :)

@philbo1, Most likely there is no avoiding the expiration of beta, and since it cannot even be updated, I'm afraid you eventually have to install the retail version. I doubt anyone would crack the beta as there is the real RTM windows available."

,ninj0e,2010-02-25T22:58Z,"I was very frustrated when the Windows Genuine Advantage windows showed up every time I boot up. Most of all, it was shutting down 1 hour after turning it on, so i began applying the activators, but nothing seemed to work, until I came here to TPB and found this solution, hope MS dont get their hands on this in a few months :D

BTW this is what i did to fix my OS:
1. Go to Windows Update
2. Hit Installed Updates (link at the bottom left corner). If that link isn?t there, hit ?view update history? and hit the ?installed updates? link at the top.
3. Scroll down to the section titled ?Microsoft Windows? and look for update KB971033.
4. Right click it and hit ?uninstall?. Hit okay.
5. Reboot

After that, check for updates, and the KB971033 will reappear, you just have to hide it, and it wont ever appear again, by doing the following:
1. Go to Windows Update
2. Click to View Your Optional Updates
3. Right Click the one Labeled ?Update for Windows 7? with update ID ?KB971033?
4. Click ?hide update.?

After these steps, I simply used an activator, and it worked like a charm :D
