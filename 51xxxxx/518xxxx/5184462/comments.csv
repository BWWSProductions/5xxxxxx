,traxstar7,2009-11-29T05:55Z,"Its your gps ID, start your garmin and go to system setting and so on, you will find your device number in it."

,testogel,2009-12-01T16:41Z,"I mixed up some torrent files, hence my stupid comment above. Still possible to convert the maps to mapsource 6.13.7!  Tnx vnhc, worked like a dream. "
,hp79,2009-12-07T00:39Z,"Can anyone explain how to use the img format? I tried all sorts of ISO format extractors, none worked. I got 2010.20 installed and working, but I want 2010.30. The other torrent with 2010.30 doesn't work because it has a CRC error, bad seeding. Do I have to use some software like mapupload from http://www.mapwel.eu/down.htm to install the map directly to my garmin?"
,billrs2002,2009-12-11T18:20Z,during the install garmin is asking for the produck key useing the key gen is not working any help would be great
,Fluxxeder,2009-12-28T04:14Z,"maybe i'm extremely slow... but what's Step 8? I have the map showing as unlocked, now what? "
,byronjr,2010-01-04T07:21Z,use the mapsource help to see how to select maps to transfer to your device. thanks for the upload

So I have Garmins mobile software. I have the North American map. but how do, or can I use the maps in this software. All of the ""cracks"" ask for a unit id, and I certainly dont have one as I dont have a unit.

Is this even possible? The software is really slick and worth buying, if that is even an option but I dont want to buy a garmin gsp, I already have one. I just want to get modblePC to display the map based on my gps, like GoogleEarth does so nicely. 

Anyone?"
,S_K_U_N_X,2010-01-28T16:43Z,"Ok I have the map unlocked, and mobilPc is stuck in trial mode, I tried the uln file trick using the id form the about screen but its still asking for a 8 digit product key."
