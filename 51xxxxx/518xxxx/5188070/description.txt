Muneharu Kuonji is a handsome, popular and well rounded high college student with a very dark past.
As a child he endured abuse from both his father and sexually enslaved mother; they tried to break his spirit, repeatedly raped him and forced him to perform sexual acts. His two sisters were also abused by their parents until his older sister Kasumi finally lost it and killed them. In a fit of madness her love for Muneharu also drove her to attack him and he kills her in self defense. To conceal his crime he dismembered the body with an ax and disposed of the evidence. The shock of it all drove him to forget the abuse he went through and what happened to his family, so that now he is able to move on with his life. He and his younger sister; an intelligent yet sadistic high school girl move in together and start having an incestuous relationship. Everything appears to be going smoothly for Muneharu until his memories start to cause him pain as they begin working their way to the surface and it seems he may be forced to face the demons from his past once again.
