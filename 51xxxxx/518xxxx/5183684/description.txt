wii scrubber v1.4

This is software for windows used to modiffy Wii game iso's. it can do a few things. 

scrub- rewrites random data partition to something more compressible.
Trim- Cuts update section and random filler data section off iso's leaving only the game data section. (need signing bug)
unscrub- Ummmmmmm ya. if you dont get it you suck at life.
extract/Replace/Delete any files- very useful for extracting update wads or main game dols or removing update section so people cant brick their wii. (need signing bug for deleting data or changing data)
 

i did not make this just uploaded it because v1.4 is the newst and kinda hard to find. 
IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS OR DOES DONT USE IT!!!
enjoy
