Includes: Log/Cue

With the economy tanking, homes being lost, and folks switching to survival
mode, America may need Neko Case's back-to-nature fantasias more than ever.
On 2006's gothic classic Fox Confessor Brings the Flood, she belted out
soaring country rock, Southern gospel, and power-pop hymns about lions,
sparrows, and two-legged creatures living outside civilization. Middle
Cyclone carries case's unique vision one step further: here, she truly
embraces the beast within. Whether she's imagining herself as a killer whale
or translating a magpie's song, the message is clear. "I'm an animal," she
growls, "and you're an animal, too."

With cameos by Calexico, M. Ward, and the New Pornographers, Middle Cyclone
finds its haunted heart in the tension between rootsy twang and man-made
squall. On the smoldering ballad "Polar Nettles," robins chirp just before
Los Lobos' Steve Berlin wipes them out with a MIDI sax solo. And while
"Fever" sways like a '50s- style slow dance at the VFW hall, its guitar outro
warbles like a melting motherboard.

The two forces dovetail with fragile grace on the title track, as Case pours
out her throaty tenor over music-box twinkles and acoustic strums: "I lie
across the path, waiting / Just for the chance to be / A spiderweb trapped in
your lashes." the instincts she channels -- hunger, fear, lust -- may be
animalistic. But the ache in her voice is wrenchingly human.
