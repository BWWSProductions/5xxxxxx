At a standing-room only event, Oscar-winning filmmaker Michael Moore tackles the death of media, the promise and problems of the Obama era, and above all, his new film, Capitalism: A Love Story. With Americans losing their homes, jobs, and savings to foot the bill for past spending, Moore asks, "What is the price that America - and the rest of the world - must pay for its love of capitalism?"
