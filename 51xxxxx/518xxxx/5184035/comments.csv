,AnonymousTakeANumber,2009-12-10T04:06Z,AVG and MBAM scans turn up clean. Waiting for my POS internet to upload to virustotal.
,AnonymousTakeANumber,2009-12-11T07:25Z,"Meh, gave up on getting virustotal to accept the too-large RAR. I installed it. No problems so far, went through tut levels and computer (win 7 x64) still runs fine"

,fazeem,2010-01-16T04:57Z,this is version 2. the game is up to version 3 plus an expansion (Zenith Remnant)
,deMangler,2010-01-18T11:38Z,"I just have to say that this is an amazing game for anyone into strategy.
The developer has some pretty clear anti-DRM views and he puts a lot into this game.
It sells for under $10 and he does not make enough $ at the time of posting to give up his day job.
IF you like this game, visit the forums and get to know the community. You will more than likely see that, even if you do not normally pay for games, this one is one to support - especially for Pirates!  Yarrr!"
