This is half hour Christmas special starring well known â€œMadagascar".

Merry Madagascar begins when Santa and his sleigh unexpectedly crash-land on the island, giving the jolly gentleman a case of amnesia. So it falls to Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria â€” along with the ever-inventive Penguins â€” to deliver the presents and save Christmas. And it doesnâ€™t hurt that Santaâ€™s Sleigh just might be able to make a little trip to New York City, so they can finally return to their beloved home. But during their appointed rounds, the four re-discover the magic of giving â€” and that it is ultimately more important than their own wish to return home. Also included is a long-lasting North Pole/South Pole rivalry between the Penguins and Santaâ€™s reindeer, plus magic flying dust and a King Julien-based holiday called â€œJulienuary.

For vicerock (mod):

vicerock, PLEASE, do not move my torrents to "Handhelds" category. Please.
I have no idea why you have done it...
I just have moved in from "downed" mininova, I do not need anyone to tell me what to do, especially without my consent. I have 300 000 downloads every month, I expect to be found by my "audience", people who are lost in this mess.

As the file-name says, [PC Mac XboX PS3 ipod] where ipod is on the last place, it is possible to play such file on ipod, it is good, ipod compatible encoding and that's all. It is COMPATIBILITY tag, nothing more.

I DO NOT encode for Hanhelds exclusively and BTW, I will done it myself, right?

Sincerely, twentyforty.
