,zyzykwy,2009-12-01T02:42Z,"don't know why TPB keeps showing no seeds, My torrent client shows 2 seeds and almost 700 with 18% plus.  Bytes going out continuously."
,ratt101,2009-12-01T03:22Z,"remember now zyzykwy the negatives really mean positives

dont even look at the Quality its wrong

they hit the negative and they dont even see what the contents of the torrent is

they do it cuz there on drugs


"
,ratt101,2009-12-01T03:49Z,"the trackers were offline for a short time

but there back up"
,zyzykwy,2009-12-01T03:56Z,"My guess is that quality is like polls, those who hate all speak out and only 1 in 10 of those who like say anything."
,zyzykwy,2009-12-01T03:59Z,"If my computer can stay on all night and not shut itself off this might be getting multiple seeds by morning, if so I'll share something else through the week.  I feel the need to share to thank those who shared all the stuff I DLed over the months."

,zyzykwy,2009-12-01T21:15Z,"Already set that way, has been for ever, it went off because of being 10 years since I did a total reinstall of the OS and it needs a system clean out of excess files.  A trojan/worm attack in the night showed up on my AV log and that caused the shutdown."
