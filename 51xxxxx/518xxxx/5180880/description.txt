If you ever did live in Zambia in the 60's, 70's and 80's you might like this. Phllipo sings of the problems in Zambia. His music is educational and falls in the category known as Kalindula rather than the general conotation of 'Zambian Music'. To the madalas this is a gem owing to the wisdom contained herein. Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to get ahold of this kind of music but if you like the music, please do support the artist by buying a copy.

Enjoy and seed.
