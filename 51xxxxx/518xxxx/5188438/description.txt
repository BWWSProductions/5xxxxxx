    While there are some definite flaws heard on Kid Cudiâ€™s debut (inconsistent flow, some trite/immature lyrics, and some lackluster beats), Man on the Moon: The End of Day is still a stand out in the hip-hop community, as well as all music, this year. Cudi brings a style not heard by many hip-hop artists in the mainstream today, and he has does a fine job of balancing swagger with his insecurities, making him someone a lot of us can relate to. The emotional ebb and flow of Man on the Moon is enough to bring in listeners, while the outstanding production will keep them hooked. So how much higher can this man on the moon reach? Weâ€™re about to find out, because Kid Cudiâ€™s spaceship is about to take off.
