AbcPuzzles offers two variations on a tile-based puzzle game. Each uses the same basic engine, in which you move the tiles in groups of four or more by spinning them with the control located in the corner where four tiles touch. Much like Rubik's Cube in two dimensions, the games are harder than they first look since you must get the tiles properly aligned without disrupting your previous work. AlterJig uses images, scrambling the inner blocks but leaving the outside one intact. Five images are provided, and your own properly formatted bitmaps can be used. Cyclanoid is similar, but your task is to arrange the tiles in rows to match the icons displayed along the game-area border. Demo modes and documentation are included for both games.

Enjoy!
