Green Memories is a meditation on the global ecology and it is based on the poetry of the highly acclaimed Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad. A mixture of the music of Iran, India, and electronic ambient, it features the exquisite and angelic voice of Azam Ali, the virtuosic violin performance of Keyavash Nourai, and the intricately complex compositions and electronics of the internationally acclaimed composer and computer musician Shahrokh Yadegari.
