,dreifunken,2009-12-01T05:53Z,"Not entirely sure what to think of this. I downloaded the spectrum analysis files only, and it looks, to me, like the den0izer remaster is severely brickwalled. Am I misreading the graphics?
Anyway, could someone download this and do an A/B comparison?"
,elektrostatisk,2009-12-01T10:06Z,"Warning. This so called remix sucks. It [i]may[i/] work on bad computer speakers but on a descent system it just sound compressed, distorted and with excessive treble and bass. All the quality that the engineers have strived for is just gone. The originals is available here, download them instead, this is just a waste of bandwidth."

,tommythekat,2010-01-22T09:18Z,"there is a little more to mastering then running it through some crappy program and setting a preset. go out and get the real remasters, listen to them on a real set of speakers, then punch yourself in the nuts"
