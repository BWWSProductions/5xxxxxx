Description:This WIndows XP Pro SP3 install DVD is a multi OEM preactivation disk that works with almost all major OEM systems. I created this disk myself from an untouched
OEM disk using RyanVM Integrator, Nlite, Driver Pack Finisher and a few other apps. This is the culmination of months of
research and experimentation. This will certainly install on ANY system, but if you built your own system, you will need
to provide your own license key or use the included activation crack, or else after 30 days you will be locked out. BURN THE ISO
AT 4X SPEED! If your PC is a Dell, Sony, Gateway, etc. on the OEM list in the description of this torrent, Windows will
activate during installation and never ask you for a product key, and it will not only pass WGA, it will actually be
genuine. This is not a crack or generated key being used. The keys used are genuine SLP keys for the OEM activation of
these systems. The manufacturers use the same keys.

VERSION 3.0

Here is the OEM list. I was not able to test
every OEM. Dell, Gateway, Emachine, IBM, Toshiba, HP and Sony were successfully tested.
