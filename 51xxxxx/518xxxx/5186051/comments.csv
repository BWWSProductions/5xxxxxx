,sathanas6,2009-12-02T07:34Z,Anyone interested in version 3.1? I am now using it. It's the same as this but with the very latest Windows updates added. I will also be releasing Office 2003 SP3 with updates through December 1st 2009 integrated.
,IHV,2009-12-04T17:03Z,"Downloading now, thanks for upload. I hope it works on my Acer emachine. I actually got XP OEM but its seems to be counterfeight as MS said (even tho its bought totally legally) so im not gonna pay them for another OS."
,ed.m,2009-12-08T01:55Z,Would be nice to have the on updated to December 1st of 2009.  :D
,Blaze_Of_Glory,2009-12-25T01:45Z,"Thx! Have been looking for something like this. Now I don't have to reinstall all the crap that came w/the Compac. Btw, what would v3.1 add? Any chance the drivers for SATA HDs?"
,carsons,2010-01-05T04:54Z,"I'm installing right now and it appears to have gotten my Emachines OEM!!!
I'll post again after genuine product test"
,carsons,2010-01-05T06:07Z,"woo everything's done, but the start menu is gigantic (like 10 icons tall but with a ton of extra space), how do i reduce it to the normal size"
,fhaffar,2010-01-19T16:41Z,"Excellent work maaaan, well done, but when will you upload awesomw 3.1 mate ?, also have you Win 7 yet ?"
,sathanas6,2010-01-20T08:52Z,"Sorry I haven't responded recently, been busy. I did create version 3.1, which only added the latest Windows updates. I will not release it, but I use it myself. I just don't see enough demand for it. Sata drivers have been included in all my releases and will continue to be in future releases. I will likely release version 4.0 sometime in late February or early March. The start menu size can be reduced in the start menu settings by right clicking start, selecting properties, clicking customize on the start menu tab ang changing the number of programs on start menu to a lower number. I do have Windows 7, but not a custom disk. There are many builds available, and an original build with an OEM loader seems to be the common practice for 7 OEM activation. The tools I use to customize XP will not work on 7, nor are there as yet readily available tools to do so. I will continue to do what I do best and keep this disk updated regularly."
,sathanas6,2010-01-24T06:30Z,"I am not sure if anyone else has this problem, but I was unable to install this KB978207 update for IE7 XP. It may only be due to the slipstreamed nature of the IE7 hotfixes in my custom XPawesome 3.1 install DVD. If anyone else has this problem, the solution is simple. Close IE7, browse to C\Windows\System32 and delete iepeers.dll. Then restart IE7 and go ahead with the update."
,toddcaz,2010-02-04T16:56Z,WILL THIS WORK IF YOU USE IT FOR BOOT CAMP ON A MAC
,sathanas6,2010-02-04T20:16Z,It won't preactivate. I'm not sure if it would work at all. I think I remember reading in a forum that Bootcamp requires the valid license key upfront or else it won't install. I have no experience personally with this.
,cdoug88,2010-02-15T21:16Z,I would really enjoy 3.1......can you get it to me?
,sathanas6,2010-03-04T13:21Z,4.0 is coming soon.
,zakitc,2010-03-08T22:00Z,"hi :) THank you for this torrent. I have installed it on IBM T42 and everything is fine except that when I shuting down it, it takes a strangely long time...."
,sathanas6,2010-03-09T07:46Z,The long shutdown will go away. It is because the prefetch isn't optimized. It takes a few days to really get fast. 4.0 will be out in a few days.
,sathanas6,2010-03-10T06:31Z,The XPAwesome 4.0 DVD.ISO with multi-OEM preactivation and integrated driverpack installation has been completed and tested. I will make the torrent and upload tomorrow. It is gooood.
,roshanabey,2010-06-23T19:59Z,"Does it work on assembled PCs? 
does the key appear as OEM in system property?
Can this communicate with Microsoft without fear for updates?

Pls Answer soon 
Thnks lot.
RoshanSL"
,sathanas6,2010-07-02T07:18Z,"roshanabey, all your questions would be answered by reading the description if you would care to, but this is version 3 and we are on version 6 now, so I wouldn't bother with this anyway."
,seth1969,2010-11-24T15:53Z,     look like   they need   for   lic number itt owner  oh dam how    go get it do that?
,Rottweiler-fan,2011-01-07T02:11Z,"Thank you sathanas6. this works Great on my Acer Ferrari 3400 Laptop and only needed approx 200Mb of updates on Windows Update (installed on 02/01/2011) and it passed WGA with no problems ;o) I`ve also installed it on an ASUS with no problems as well. 
It takes a while to install but it`s well worth the wait.
Thanks for all your hard work... "
,Rottweiler-fan,2011-01-07T02:35Z,Ooop`s... I ment to write this about your other Upload 5.0 Beta 3 but i`m sure this is is up to the same standards that you are known for.
,aus_jopie,2011-12-17T10:50Z,"Hi sathanas6, thanks for the prog. realy great!!

,neo2jcl,2011-12-19T23:31Z,F*****G great torrent.
,th3,2012-03-19T17:59Z,"Its good but those utilities you included are really bad stuff, revo uninstaller and that copier, and most of all the superretarded UNLOCKER! WHY did u destroy this with hard-to-remove stuff, hidden crap lyng around a fresh install, it just violates the term FRESH INSTALL. Bloatware warning, do not download xpawesome. "
,dtkenmo,2012-04-26T23:38Z,"Any chance you might upload a vanilla version of this, i.e., without all the customizations, which while nice for many, do not suit everyone, and are a pain for the less knowledgeable to deal with."
