I don't think I will bother as the video quality will only be good enough to watch on your mobile phone.  What is it with you lot... Can you not afford a 1Tb hard drive, or are you uploading at dial up speeds... sigh.   What a shame reducing GREAT files to video rubbish"
[T],towerelect,2009-11-28T11:23Z,Oh just looked at the file format... Yeap MP4... RUBBISH!!!! do me a favour just upload the whole DVD's when you have gotten over the mobile phone quality thing.
