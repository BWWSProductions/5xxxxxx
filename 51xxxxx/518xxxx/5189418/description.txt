Todays release is finally here! :)

This one was a real headache to prepare since the original volumes seem to all have been done by different people many of which did not seem to care weather things where displayed in the proper order or not so i pretty re-package the whole thing, remember people keep you files organized or the spirit chaotic file indexes will come and haunt you -_-. Well anyway now its done and everything *should* be ordered properly so i hope you will enjoy it. :)

As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. credits pages and possibly some fan art are included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.
