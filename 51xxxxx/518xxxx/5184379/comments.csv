,BigSoul,2009-11-28T12:49Z,"I dont know how to cd-ing in the terminal, olease explaine

Thanks"
,zogulusnig,2009-11-28T18:12Z,"By ""cd-ing"" the poster is referring to ""changing directory"".  You need to navigate to the directory where this application gets installed from within the Terminal.

Since you start the Terminal in your home directory, you would probably type:

cd /Applications

Which will put you in the 'Applications' directory.  Then:

cd ""name of directory containing Avid Media""

Here the part in quotes is where the application resides.  The application may have been installed directly in the 'Applications' folder itself.  If so, you are there, and ready for the next step in the instructions.

Good luck."

I don't know why 3.12 works on SL and 4.02 dose not. all I know is that SL support from Avid starts at 4.04. I DO know that they made a lot of changes to the license system from 3.5 so that may be the issue. I did not write the crack, just trying to help.

But unfortunallity not for eweryone, (me).

Could someone please give an step by step instruction of the procedure in terminalmode! I really dont understand, and the more I try the more stupid I feel.

What does ""cd-ing"" or ""changing directory"" really means. Do you write the path to the app? Or do you copy/paste the three written 
lines in the discription into the terminal window? (the one witch starts with ""sudo""...)

I could really need some help here.

,edit6969,2009-12-11T08:01Z,"after you have installed the app first and restarted 

After restart, copy the files in the crack directory to the places stated, so step 1
AvidMediaComposer goes to Applications/Avid Media Composer/AvidMediaComposer.app/Contents/MacOS
and(step 2) SuperPro32 goes to /Library/Frameworks/SuperPro32.framework/Versions/A

(step 3) then comes the important bit, you must tell MACOS that it is allowed to run the new AvidMediaComposer application.
this is were the sudo chmod -R 755 command comes in. Open a terminal window and type
""sudo chmod -R 755 "" without the quotes (remember the space after the last 5) then drag the file you replaced in step 1 from /Applications/Avid Media Composer/AvidMediaComposer.app/Contents/MacOS to the terminal window. ( this should make the line now look like this
""sudo chmod -R 755 /Applications/Avid Media Composer/AvidMediaComposer.app/Contents/MacOS/AvidMediaComposer"" then press enter/return and the terminal will ask for an administrators password, type that in press enter/return and the terminal will go back to the same prompt it had when you opened it.

Launch the app and it will ask you how you want to activate media composer. Choose activate via Dongle and it should run. This is what i did and it worked.

,alphabeta666,2009-12-13T18:49Z,"Edit6969,
Thank you so much for your step by step guide. Exactly what I called for!!!

But unfortunally I end up with the ""No Dongle"" message. 
I copy (and replace) the files in the crack folder to the places described above,
I do the ""chmod -R 755"" command in terminal. Still ""No Dongle"".

Has anyone got a clue..? By the ""no dongle"" message can you figure out witch part Im doing wrong.
I mean is it the actual crack files that isnt working (AvidMediaComposer or SuperPro32) or is it
the ""chmod -R 755"" command that goes wrong?

Install Application from http://cdn.avid.com/MediaComposer/4.0.2/Mac/AvidMediaComposer_4.0.2.dmg

Restart

Overwrite this two patched files.

Type the following into the terminal after cd-ing to the ""AVID MC 4.0.2"" directory:

sudo cp AvidMediaComposer /Applications/Avid Media Composer/AvidMediaComposer.app/Contents/MacOS

sudo cp SuperPro32 /Library/Frameworks/SuperPro32.framework/Versions/A

4) Go to your Applications folder and locate the AvidMediaComposer.app in your Avid folder. Right click the AvidMediaComposer.app and choose ""Show Package Contents"". A new window will open with the app contents and in /Contents/MacOS folder you will see the AvidMediaComposer file. So Replace it with the one from your medicine. DONT close the contents window yet.

5) Open your terminal and type: sudo chmod -R 755 (after the 755, don't forget the space) and from the contents window Drag and Drop the AvidMediaCopmposer file (the one you replace in the prev. step) in the terminal. If you do it correctly your may read this: sudo chmod -R 755 /Applications/Avid Media Composer/AvidMediaComposer.app/Contents/MacOS/AvidMediaComposer.
