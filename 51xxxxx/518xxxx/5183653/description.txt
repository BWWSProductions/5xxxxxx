It is an instrumental soundtrack to a book called "Finch" by Science 
Fiction/Fantasy/Horror author Jeff Vandermeer. He approached MBD about doing a soundtrack to go with the limited edition of his new book, and we thought it was such a strange idea we had to do it. The book reminds us of Bladerunner- with spore-faced bad guys. Bitchin'. We locked ourselves up in our friends studio (Farm Fresh) in Bloomington, IN for 5 days and wrote and recorded an instrumental album inspired by the book. We have used a lot of crazy techniques that we have never tried before on this record. Our old pianist Vincent Edwards lent his hand(s) at the piano, organs, and Rhodes. Each song is attempting to recreate a scene or mood from the book- the release shows the page numbers in the book that correspond to each track on the CD.
