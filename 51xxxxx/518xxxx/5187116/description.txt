Shirley Bassey November 2009 


Graham Norton:
The Girl From Tiger Bay (from her new album The Performance)

Children in Need:
This Time
Diamonds Are Forever (edit -removed insane man in tuxedo shouting)

Strictly Come Dancing:
This Time

As mentiond above when DSB appeared on Children in Need a man invaded the stage and started shouting. Strangely, someone had given him a microphone. DSB looked embarassed and he almost wasted a great song and performance. DSB looked quite emotional at the end of This Time with Gary Barlow (Children in Need).


This came from BBC DVB Freeview and is now a DVD. Drag all contents to your burning app make a DVD video or play the largest VOB with VideoLan or your usual player.


I'm after Another Audience with Shirley Bassey (2006). Anyone help with that?
