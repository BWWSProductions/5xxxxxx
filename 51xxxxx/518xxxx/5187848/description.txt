Best Of Whitesnake(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_______________________________________

Whitesnake have to be one of the most important rock bands of the last
two decades, how can they have lasted 30 + years and 12 + albums and 
not prOduced this record before?? 

The Greatest hits album of the 90's was total garbage containing pointless 
remixes and the 'wailing' period of Whitesnake songs. 

This album is a much truer representation of what the Whitesnake fans see 
as thier greatest hits.

The songs you would expect are there; A nice remaster of Fool for Your Loving 
plus Dont Break my Heart Again, Is this Love, R&W, Here I go again, 
Guilty of Love and Still of the Night all sounding as fantastic as ever.

The great thing about this album is the inclusion of great songs that were not 
big hits, for example - Standing in the Shadows only made it to no 62 in the 
UK chart and Long Way from Home only made it to 55 in the UK chart, 
yet both are superb songs.

The way the album is mixed is nice too, the songs are in no particular order, 
but follow each other nicely, which is quite rare with compilation albums.

The jewel in the crown has to be the inclusion of the 1978 studio version 
of 'A'int no love in the Heart of the City', this song just gets you tingling 
all over everytime you hear it the album is worth buying for this song alone.

All in all, I would say this is one of the best compilation albums I have heard, 
the subject matter helps a lot! The sleeve is nice colours etc, I think there 
could have been a bit more information and history about the band.

You are NUTS of you do not buy this album right now, a great introduction 
to Whitesnake.

BUY,BUY,BUY!!!!!!! 

Note: Sorry about the last track as i had to scource from elsewhwere as
