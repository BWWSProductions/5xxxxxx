[V],Kuthumi,2009-11-29T13:57Z,"Thank you Blueboy for taking all this trouble to preserve TV history. Several of the episodes you uploaded earlier have run dry of seeders and stand still at 90%. Hope you can take a few minutes and seed them again up to 100%.
For fans of Peter Berg, I have uploaded the rare Aspen Extreme at

,blueboy2419,2009-11-30T14:34Z,"Kuthumi - I want to cencentrate on getting the final episodes of Season 6 up and then I'll see what I can seed from earlier seasons. I've managed to sort out the mono sound problems of earlier files so these will be new files rather then finishing off part completed ones. I think this is worth it to get stereo. 

If anyone has a particular request let me know."
,blueboy2419,2009-11-30T20:41Z,"royfan38 - I've reseeded the original torrents for all but S01E21. My original file has been changed, I think to improve the sound (?) so I have seeded a new file. Please download this version.

This is one of the files I had a problem with. Vuze suddenly reported that a piece had been corrupted but couldn't download because noone was seeding. I had to put up another file:

try this, it shouldn't take long if you are the only leech."
,blueboy2419,2009-12-03T09:05Z,"Sorry, mixed up my s05 and s06 !!!

S05E06 is being seeded at the minute, you should be able to finish it, I'll keep it going for a while."
