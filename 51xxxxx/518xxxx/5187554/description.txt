Modern Guilt was released one year ago this week! For the occassion we are putting up acoustic versions of the entire album recorded earlier this year after returning from the Japan tour (under severe jet lag). Tracks will be released weekly starting with this rendition of Orphans. There will be limited EP of four tracks from the session available soon. We'll also be putting up all the promotional videos from the album this week in the new section, Videotheque.


==================

This torrent includes the original .mp4 video files posted on Beck's vimeo.com site (http://www.vimeo.com/videotheque). They were ripped with clipnabber.com and are the original files uploaded by Beck, not the vimeo stream, not the vimeo re-encode.

The flac and mp3's, therefore, are clean rips from the best possible available source (the original mp4 videos) and are not sourced from the vimeo stream or the re-encoded / compressed vimeo files.

Enjoy this in the highest quality available until Beck officially releases it, if he does.
