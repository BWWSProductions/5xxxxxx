But despite the size, they're only mediocre quality ..."

Just saw ""The Last Airbender"" in theaters, and my god M Knight Shamalayan (sp?) BUTCHERED the series.

I hope you don't upload the live-action movie, and I'm glad you posted this so I can go back and watch it and remember how GOOD the series actually was.


Sorry for the rant, thanks for the great seeds and I hope any true Avatar fan won't even think of buying and/or uploading the live action movie"
