,joemama77ca,2009-12-26T19:35Z,"Hi, when I attach the kitserver it changes all the menu items to Russian (or something). How do I get them in English?"
,whatwhohow,2010-01-16T04:21Z,"setup.exe will not open:
""D:\PROEVO~1\KITSER~1\setup.exe
C:\DOCUME~1\User\LOCALS~1\Temp\. A temporary file needed for initialization could not be created or could not be written to. Make sure that the directory path exists, and disk space is available. Close 'Close' to terminate this application.""
Tried running it through DOS:
""Program too big to fit in memory"".
Does anybody have any clues about fixing it?"
