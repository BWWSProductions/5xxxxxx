,Jaybo1213,2009-12-05T22:04Z,"ahh, really?? well like i said, i'm not very experienced with this, i know it works perfectly well when you use the standard window's media player, but i've never really bothered to try it on anything else. i really only use 2 programs, the WMP, and Real Player, i've never needed to install anything else."
,Jaybo1213,2009-12-06T09:05Z,"oh yeah, apparently i forgot, i use the K-Lite, Codec package, i really dunno if that makes a difference or not"

@TheOperator With limited info, I can only guess it is the software you are using. Try using VLC."

Thanks Jaybo."
