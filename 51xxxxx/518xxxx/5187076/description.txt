It's the latest album from scottish rock geniuses Biffy Clyro.
It's here in FLAC format so if you want you can rip it to another format (using foobar2000 or some other program) or just keep it as it is.

With FLAC and CUE files, you can recreate the original CD with something like Nero.

The possibilities are endless when it comes to FLAC so please, seed to your heart's content and go see Biffy Clyro in concert.


(Credit for the original FLAC files goes to centroids1@gmail.com, A guy who had all his uploads on mininova until the closure.)
