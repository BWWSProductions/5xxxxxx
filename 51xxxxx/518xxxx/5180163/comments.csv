,birger72,2009-11-29T23:32Z,"How du you use this map?
I copy the map to the GPS, but when I choose the map it says there is a problem with the map and I can't use it.

If I use Tomtom home on the pc it says I can't use the map because it's not activated.
How do I activate it?

I have a 930Go

Thanks"
