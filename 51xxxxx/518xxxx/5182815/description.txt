Well, this is my first torrent. I decided to publish this because I have been trying really hard to find this book. It was nowhere to be found and where it was - almost impossible to download it. But I finally got it and am glad to share it with other drawing enthusiasts. If anybody is in need, I can publish Andrew Loomis books as well (which have helped me a GREAT deal in drawing portraits, hands, human body and helped with composition, perspective as well.

Anyway, hope you enjoy it and visit my blog if you are interested in drawing/painting.(myartistfactory. blogspot. com - just remove the spaces)
P.S. - don't be too harsh. I've only recently started this endeavour again.
