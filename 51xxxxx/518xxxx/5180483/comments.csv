,rizzon,2009-12-11T18:10Z,Nice upload but if the keygen is all you really need could you please not rar everything into one file? Seeing as it's only 13 MB the rar is kinda unnecessary. Now we who only want the keygen have to download the whole thing.
[V],Alia_Erenel,2009-12-11T23:41Z,"Sure. I realized afterwards that the setup could be easily downloaded from their website.
If you take a look at my other ""releases"", you'll see I'm all for using someone's else up bandwith ;).

Feel free to upload the keygen only."

,marvelues,2010-03-09T11:39Z,"nice upload

but it would be nicer if you didn't compress the keygen with the installer

in my case i only need the keygen

so :)

thanks a lot anyway "

No worries, but I understand your concerns :) ! Next time, use something like Sandboxie to open things like keygen and generate a key without any worries.

And here, try this one:
