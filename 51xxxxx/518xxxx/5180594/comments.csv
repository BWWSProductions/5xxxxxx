,DarkRedoSin,2011-05-02T17:05Z,"First it won't install correctly,thought it finally worked then get message saying that it's only standard copy which adds watermark to video,this I don't want.Next not all settings work right which isn't very good-message I get when I try the better settings is-""ffmain:unrecognized option'-hq'.So again not very good,sorry I will have to look elsewhere for something that works correctly!Very disappointing!"
,DarkRedoSin,2011-05-02T17:10Z,"Forgot to add when message ""ffmain:unrecognized option '-hq' comes up on screen the only way to shut down the application is through the 'Start Task Manager'and close the program that way as nothing else will shut it down!"
