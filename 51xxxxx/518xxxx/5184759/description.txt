On May 28th 1987 , the Washington based group Bad 

Brains, played the Paradiso in Amsterdam, the 

Netherlands at the Tegen Tonen Festival.

VPRO Radio recorded the show on 24 tracks.
The tapes were later mixed down to 2 -channel 

16-bits PCM on videotape and offered to the Bad 

Brains management.
They refused the tapes because they were thought to 

be too expensive and the management decided to 

release the live album "The Youth Are Getting 

Restless" on vinyl.
They used the inferior 2 channel tape they recorded 

themselves from the front of house desk.

Here, for the second time, the far more superior 

version of "The Youth Are Getting Restless"!

Second time ? I hear you ask !

The first time I seeded this baby there were some 

major problems.

There were a lot of digital pops and cracks on the 

recordings and I could not give you what I had 

intended to do so.

But afer searching high and low I managed to find 

first generation cassettes taken from the PCM 

masters.

Also I found a recording of track 14, The Fearless 

Vampire Killer which was omitted from my earlier 

seed.

Bad Brains Managemant claimed , in a post on my 

first seed, that the album and these recordings are 

the same !

I must disagree with them for the eq and effects 

are totally different !
The album "The Youth Are Getting Restless "is, in 

my opinion, a completely different album than these 

recordings.

NOTE : These recordings have a few songs which are 

not on the album (track 11, 15, 19, 20) and the 

album has two songs which are not in these 

recordings because they were thought to be in such 

bad condition that they were omitted from the PCM 

videotapes (Rock For Light and Right Brigade)

The audible difference between the album and these 

recordings are ; a clearer, richer and fuller 

sound, audible vocals and a better instrumental 

mix.

Judge for yourselves !
