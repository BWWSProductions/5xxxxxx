Fourth full length rips deeper with both 90 second & 10 minute forays into skeletal psychedelia. This is not to say the idiosyncratic songwriting style & vocalizing of Jeremy Earl is not present in spades but expanded, colored, & twisted into a tie-dye of soundscapes. Having toured incessantly over the last 12 months as a four piece, many of the songs on "Shame" benefit from having been road worn, windblown, & deeply grooved.
