,redhare,2009-11-28T07:53Z,MAYBE it's just bad writing but the acting is so bad on this series this year they should pull the plug and put it out of it's misery. Why are they pushing BIG BROTHER having police cameras EVERYWHERE as a good thing? EVERYBODY lose their privacy to catch one brain-injured guy who has killed some people? An episode which the sole purpose of advocating and promoting and supporting POLICE CAMERAS EVERYWHERE. The very WORST of all the CSI series and a very bad collection of characters and actors. Don't download.
