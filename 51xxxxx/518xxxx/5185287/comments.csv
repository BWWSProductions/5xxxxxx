,synczorR,2009-12-22T20:36Z,Is this really the full game and can I play online ?
,undertaker007,2009-12-26T16:12Z,no you can't play online because this is a crack and for dvdesa if you have vista try running it with admin right and if that don't work try letting the screen like that. The first time you play it can be kinda buggy but after it's normal...
,Hockey55,2009-12-27T12:38Z,I removed game.in rar file is.How to switch to normal format for the games computer.please help
,GameEnjoyer,2009-12-27T20:00Z,"Hey, Undertaker. I've installed the game using setup.bat, however, once I try to play the game (with the firewall installed, mind you) I still get the secuROM activation and I fail it. What's the problem?"
,GameEnjoyer,2009-12-27T23:28Z,"Nevermind. I found out that when secuROM loaded it provided a link. I followed that link and the game producers had the amazing courtesy to produce their own ""hacked"" .exe for the game. Thanks!"

,evulta,2010-05-09T15:14Z,"BLACK SCREEN , sound and cursor that is all i got :("
,comet.vermont,2010-07-11T20:33Z,"For everyone writing about the dreaded \""BLACK SCREEN\""...do some research online.  It\'s a common issue with crysis & warhead.  (I had the same problem-win. 7 32) hit CTRL+Alt+Delete, then select task manager, then click the Crysis icon on the bottom of the screen to bring it back up.nnIt will probably return in \""window mode\"" so go to options/video options/ & click FULL SCREEN.nnWorks 99% of the time."
