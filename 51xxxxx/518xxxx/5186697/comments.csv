[M],k-kid,2009-11-29T15:04Z,"never tried with LAN, but should be able to "
,ReaL_BadMaN,2009-11-29T15:08Z,Does it work on Vista x32?
[M],k-kid,2009-11-29T17:09Z,"windows 7 & vista are similar OS, so should be able to work"
,The_Skum82,2009-11-29T17:17Z,can confirm that this does work. Win7 x32 x64 and xp
,chunlianghere,2009-11-29T17:44Z,works fine wit me. winxp 32bit.
,Derc,2009-11-29T18:43Z,Thank you! Was saving my Rzr rls in hopes... going to try this out (again) on XP PRO x86.
,Derc,2009-11-29T19:25Z,"Well.. Re-installed RZR LFD2, Used the RZR patcher, extracted this to the install directory (from within the rarred folder) overwrite.. added the 32 bit reg keys. Ran the game for 5 minutes in SP mode and... CTD again. =(

I have noticed in my peerblocker, that its trying to talk to valve and limelight networks. Anything to do with that? I don't have steam installed right now. should I be starting the game from the .exe? Or the launcher or the loader? Will try again with each."
,Derc,2009-11-29T19:52Z,Works.. but crashes on smoker... or the last time it was a charger in the hotel. Hopefully this works for some. =/
,SDWILLIA,2009-11-29T21:13Z,"Does it fix the problem when you uninstall the game that all your fonts are messed up???

It doesn't sound like it fixed the crashing problem, from what is said below."
,The_Skum82,2009-11-29T22:20Z,"Just make a new install, and aply ONLY this crack. It worked for me, and not a single crash yet."
,matelian,2009-11-30T00:12Z,"@ SDWILLIA
i remember from back then L4D 1  when i uninstall it all the windows fonts go Bold that mad me mad coz i have installed it like 4 times to see if it will work good"
,esperm,2009-11-30T02:27Z,try disable multicore rendring in the game options. That prevented crashes for me i think
,darcoolio,2009-11-30T03:14Z,"after instaling this patch, my game menue is on russian, is this normal?
how can i remove all russian files?"
,SLAM-ER,2009-11-30T05:37Z,"Well this crack is better than the one included with the Razor1911 release which for me would crash to desktop as soon as the intro movie finished, but this 'fixed' crack still crashes to desktop, now about 30sec after starting a game.  I'm running Win7 x64.  Ran the x64 reg files, and launched game using RevLoader.exe as well as Launcher.exe (both with same results, CTD after 30sec or so).  Tried a delete and fresh install from Razor1911 release but still happens.  Also my name is [unknown] even after editing rev.ini and using name command in console (and using the launcher.exe with name set in there too).  Am I doing something stupid?"
,SLAM-ER,2009-11-30T05:44Z,"Oh and I also tried it with multicore rendering disabled, it still crashes to desktop.  (Been trying Hotel map, I barely get into the hallway before it crashes)."
,Qu4z1,2009-11-30T05:52Z,"Im having the same problem as SLAM-ER. ""but this 'fixed' crack still crashes to desktop, now about 30sec after starting a game."" And, ""I also tried it with multicore rendering disabled, it still crashes to desktop."" Please help."
,SLAM-ER,2009-11-30T06:14Z,"I just found that it crashes only when I shoot a teammate.  (It only takes me 30sec to accidentally shoot the AI, lol).  "
,waterman100,2009-11-30T07:38Z,"Stay with original razor 911. This will mess up your install. wiped out all controls. no mouse or keyboard. Dude, set to the default command functions. not all use joy stiks"
,SLAM-ER,2009-11-30T10:51Z,"Nah this patch is good, just fix your keys and your right.  Also I found a fix for CTD when shooting teammates.  Edit Rev.ini and add -lv to the ProcName line to read: ProcName=left4dead2.exe -lv -console -sv_lan 1 -sv_allow_lobby_connect_only 0
This will force it to run in 'low violence' mode which stops it crashing to desktop.  Hopefully someone will fix the crack so normal 'full violence' no longer crashes, but the above will work till then."
,Derc,2009-12-01T06:24Z,"@SL-Ammer or whatever your gay name is... LOW VIOLENCE MEANS NO FULL GAME!!!! assslammer....

We have to find a fix for the full game for ALL players. no funky workarounds no weird.. ad this file or that... IT DONT WORK!!! Im sorry K-KID!! IT DONT WORK!"
,ninja05,2009-12-01T09:46Z,can't play the finale..  
,darcoolio,2009-12-01T13:06Z,"No crashes at all for me...
But does anyone know how to remove russian language, and return game menu to english???"
,JojoTM,2009-12-02T18:50Z,"Tested on my install with already initial razor fix + lonewolf22 fix (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5174793) and it seems to work (win7 x64)

,colinb74,2009-12-03T14:34Z,"Thanks k-kid, this FIXED crack works ( you knew that!! ;) ) Windows 7 32-bit, no worries!! All I need to do is change language from Russian to English. Changed in rev.ini but it seems not to work :(

Not to worry, sure I will find a solution (learn Russian maybe??) 

Just glad to play this fully without CTD, I would buy this game but it has just been BANNED here in Australia :((

Cheers mate!! :D"

,raviraj87,2009-12-10T16:03Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!!"
,raviraj87,2009-12-14T14:13Z,"Can any body upload ""setup.exe"" for this game (Windows 7(x64) compatible)......Please!!!!!"

,SJCarline,2010-01-02T17:03Z,"I'm running Win7 x64 and I had no issues installing, however every time I fire my gun the game crashes to decktop. no message or warning just crashes."

,duckflash,2010-09-11T22:46Z,Game crashes when i come across a charger. is there a fix? i noticed someone here saying the same thing but no fix was mentioned.
,duckflash,2010-09-11T23:04Z,"ok afterall it crashes, not only when charger shows up, but whenever any 'special' infected shows up. what could cause this?"
,Keyholder,2011-02-17T21:37Z,"works... BUT...

Only for approx 10 mins.. Game keeps crashing back to desktop !

NEXT !!!"
,Keyholder,2011-02-17T21:39Z,Works but game keeps crashing back to desktop !! 
,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T15:05Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768
