Volume 1 of the Superman: The Animated Series series from 1996. This is part of the DCAU and a must for all fans of DC or Superman. I ripped these from DVD in the way I do all my TV DVD rips. Each file a rich 233 MB with 192 VBR MP3 at a 720 wide image. Any quality issues you noticed are due to the source being low quality from over a decade ago, and not me.

Enjoy,
