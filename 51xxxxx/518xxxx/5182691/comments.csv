All I did was put his keys with my scanned Kaspersky Anti-virus 2010 client and RAR'd them.

,xZarrx,2009-11-30T09:43Z,"Shoulda been keys from ChattChitto in there, sry for that... and I'm pretty sure that I did mention him in credit for they keys in the nfo.txt the client was was from the website but I scanned it and uploaded it. And I know you don't mean that there were 9 Trojans' in my upload lol b/c I scanned every file before I Rar'd then scanned the Rar..."

,ErosDeium,2009-12-04T03:39Z,Um what do i do if it says I don't have enough memory to open the file?
,xZarrx,2009-12-09T03:24Z,"Lol... I suggest getting an extra Ram stick - if u have an extra slot, OR upgrading the one u have to a bigger one... if ur PC will let you... shut down some processes, uninstall some auto start programs (or set them to NOT auto start) or just do a clean install of your fav. OS :P unless ur talking about Hard drive space... then just uninstall something, or actualy, this is a small file lol, do a clean up of everything >.< idk... just trying to throw some hints here...

,kaneboy96,2009-12-14T15:09Z,"Hey guys

I downloaded this and it all went fine.
When I browse for the activation code, I don't know what to browse for?
Can anyone help me?
I really need this."
,DarkKnight009,2009-12-15T15:01Z,"Thanks DUDE! and i think  the instruction yu have given above is for internet security .Well i read it from the nfo ty =)
I activated the trail version thru default method of kaspersky!I donno hw to activate the ""registration key"" or i cant find this ""browse"" option anywhere !! can yu help me! "
,xZarrx,2009-12-17T02:14Z,"Lol.. OK... The KEY here, is to UNHOOK or DISABLE your internet in order to get the ""Brows"" button to show up so you can add the key file... you ONLY NEED to do this when you are trying to use a keyfile to activate then Anti-Virus... The Keyfiles will be located in the area where u saved this torrent from, so if you downloaded this torrent and saved it to downloads then the keyfiles will be in (this is a windows 7 Ultimate example) C:/Users/(whatever ur log in is)/Downloads/Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 with keys (clean)/keys

so with a made up User name it might look something like this 

C:/Users/Home/Downloads/Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 with keys (clean)/keys

This is where you will find the keyfiles using the brows button to register Kaspersky 2010, just pick a keyfile and double click it... if it doesn't work, do the same thing over again until you find one that does... If none of them work, let me know and I'll see if I can get more keys for you...

 Hope this helped...
