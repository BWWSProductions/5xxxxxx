Kaspersky┬« Anti-Virus Editor's Review

We're currently working on our own review of Kaspersky┬« Anti-Virus 2010. Until we can get this up, however, do know that Kaspersky is the antivirus brand we are using ourselves, and - unless anything extremely unexpectable happens - we are Kaspersky┬« life-timers. The level of protection Kaspersky┬« provides can't be beaten in our mind!

 

Free Upgrades: Kaspersky┬« offers free upgrades to users with currently valid licenses. For example, if you hold a three year license to Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 and a new version launches within that time, you can upgrade to the newest version for free!
