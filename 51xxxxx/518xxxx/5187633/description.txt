Shogun Warriors were a line of toys, licensed by Mattel during the late 1970s that consisted of a series of imported Japanese robots all based on then-popular giant robot anime shows. 

Shogun Warriors was licensed in 1979-1980 for a 20-issue series by Marvel Comics which was written by Doug Moench (Batman, Moon Knight) and featured art by Herb Trimpe (Hulk, BPRD: The War on Frogs).  In the comic, the Shogun Warriors were created by a mysterious group called the Followers of the Light.  Human operators were chosen from all around the world to operate the massive robots in order to battle evil.  The series is firmly rooted in the Marvel Universe as evidenced by their interactions with Doctor Demonicus in issues #12-14 and the Fantastic Four in the last two issues of the series.
Though he never appeared in the comic series, Red Ronin (a robot created for Marvel's Godzilla comic) was mentioned occasionally and was frequently talked about in the letters pages.
