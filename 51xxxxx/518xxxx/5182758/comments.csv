[T],VasiaZozulia,2009-12-19T16:50Z,"Friends, seed, please!"
,pcheese,2009-12-20T22:46Z,i'm completely new to this. What programs should be used to open this torrent?
,123dutch,2009-12-21T23:23Z,"Dear Pandagirl, unfortunately this is all I could find...
If anything else from Fluenz ""falls in my lap"" I will surely share it here :)"
,pcheese,2009-12-21T23:59Z,hey pandagirl.....how did you use the torrent after you downloaded it. I'm trying to figure that out. With mozilla or what program?
,123dutch,2009-12-22T12:22Z,"Dear Pcheese:

,pcheese,2009-12-22T19:25Z,dear dutch.....downloading is easy. I'm talking about actually using the torrent once it's done downloading.
,pcheese,2009-12-22T20:49Z,I dont have enough storage space for this
,pcheese,2009-12-22T23:04Z,nevermind this crap is too confusing and downloading copyrighted content is illegal anyway.
,ALx___,2009-12-26T07:37Z,First of all thanks for the torrent. But there is something wrong. The conversation for each lesson (which is the main part of the lesson) is missing...do you guys have this problem? 
,quin29,2009-12-28T18:45Z,"Works perfectly. Best Pirate Bay program experience ever. Took about 24 hours to download. 
Here is what I did for it to work: 
1.) Download Torrent
2.) Used WinRar to extract the files
3.) Used PowerISO to run the program
have PowerISO and WinRar on your computer before you download the torrent and the file will attach itself to those programs. 
4.) Open fluenz.exe file and it should open right up. 

The audio file is in FLAC. I would prefer it as a MP3 file so that i could use it on my IPod. However I can convert the files myself. Here are the instructions to convert FLAC to MP3.

hope that helps people out. I am downloading Fluenz 1 as well and will report back on that one. 

Anyway of getting 3, 4, and 5? Please. Thanks a lot! "

,0rounder0,2010-02-06T17:10Z,"Is this version Mac compatible as well as Windows? Anyone notice a .dmg file in the same directory as the .exe, or a folder titled OSX / MAC ?

Thanks in advance"
,spaceham,2010-02-08T02:56Z,No this is the PC version... no DMGs or OSXs...
,FSSR.Keyno,2010-02-18T04:55Z,"wish i had the rest of the CDs, 3, 4, 5 and F?"
