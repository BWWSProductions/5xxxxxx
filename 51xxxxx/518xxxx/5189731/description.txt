    You think you can contribute to the scene too? You have one or more
    talents in:

    - supplying NEW unreleased GAMES (maybe you work at a game/util
      magazine, courier delivery firm, newspaper, game press/marketing
      company, distributor, publisher, duplicator, tv/radio show, shop,
      warehouse, design firm, language translation company, packing company
      store etc). You don't need a fast internet connection for the above!

    - supplying NEW unreleased store/shop games BEFORE the store release
      date & have a fast UPLOAD 300k+ internet connection and time to
      spare on weekday mornings. We are NOT interested in modem,
      cable, or DSL links as they can be capped at anytime! Proper
      internet connections are needed! Of course we shall reimburse you
      for the costs of the games you buy. As we buy our games!

    - you are experienced in removing executable protection systems
      (such as ASProtect, ASPack, Armadillo, tELock, NeoLite etc.)
      and you are willing to help defeating the latest versions of
      commercial iso copying protection systems like Safedisc 2+ or
      Securom or Tages or VOB or Copylok or Laserlok. You must be
      able to code in assembly language.

    - you are a coder with lots of experience in Debugging/ASM & C/C++.
      You also can code your OWN tools to automatically remove
      commercial iso protections like the latest versions of any of the
      following: SafeDisc or Securom or TAGES or VOB or Laserlok or
      Copylok. Using tools created by others does NOT count and we
      check! You will also need advanced knowledge of import tables
      setting breakpoints with/and PE File Formats.

    - you are a Unix guru with good Ansi-C software developing knowledge
      and understanding how to prevent network security vulnerabilities.
      That means you must be able to code to ansi-c guru level. And you
      must also have a good coder perspective of hostbase and network
      based intrusion detection systems. You should be able to code tools
      to generically prevent stack and heap buffer overflows on unix in
      Ansi-C. And Be able to code tools to look after a group of systems
      and code sniffing avoidance tools. And you can configure a system
      in ways to prevent packet sniffers and "man in the middle" attacks.

    - supplying linux bnc shells to the group (for free).
      They should have 2mbit MINIMUM link. We shall require flexible
      control over the shell. Root access on the box with dynamic
      ident such as midentd for bncs. All boxes must have legitimate
      IP's, they should not be running NAT or a firewalling system
      that will constantly interfere with the link. Ideal shells will
      have multiple vhosts, reasonably good uptime (20+ days), and a
      low system load. Public shells such as JEAH.NET or similar with
      25+ load averages and 3 day uptimes are not acceptable. The more
      reverse ips you have the better. We are only interested in LEGIT,
      NON-HACKED/CARDED shells. These shells will be used only for the
      purposes listed above and will NOT be used for any kind of
      'dump site' or for spreading any kind of releases. We are NOT
      interested in modem, cable, or DSL shells. The shells should be
      up 24/7 with minimum downtime for upgrades, etc and should not be
      overloaded with processes. We check!

    - are you able to write source code to unpack & repack game related
      major file format types such as MPQ, MIX & WAD? And can you also
      identify most major big-file formats(files that contain more
      files) by looking at the hex byte code of the header for that
      file? Do you know what reindexing is in regards to game .exe's
      and can you do it? And can you turn your OWN source code
      written in ASM/C/C++ for the above tasks into executable group
      tools? And do you also have 50K downlink for downloading new game
      formats to write tools for? You must send example code of your
      work with sources on major file formats for depacking/repacking.
      Existing/stolen source will not be allowed!

    - making trainers for newly released games, menu driven, must work
      in Win9x and Win2K/WinXP. Also you must be on a 50k downlink at
      least. And you have time during the week to do trainers.
      Also you understand DMA & ASM debugging techniques and use them
      to find your trainer codes. This is needed to make sure your
      trainers will work on all operating systems!

    the finest active group in the scene today, e-mail us.
