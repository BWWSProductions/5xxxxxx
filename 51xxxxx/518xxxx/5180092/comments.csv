,finger88,2009-11-26T01:41Z,well  seed
,BurnProcess,2009-11-26T04:46Z,"Lots of leechers and no seeders.  I can only seed these for so long each day, so if you guys want this stuff you have to give back a little."
,BurnProcess,2009-11-27T19:53Z,Final verdict was 80 leechers and 0 seeders.  I won't be uploading anything this big again unless there's a little more give and a little less take.
,urashima_keitaro2010,2009-11-29T09:33Z,"I have downloaded 81.4% of this file for a total of 1.34Gb, my computer is showing that I am uploading from 30kb to 90kb pretty consistently on just this file alone.  I am currently showing 134 peers for this file and I am willing to seed to this file. Would you please seed it so I can get the file to re-seed? The problem is that noone has been able to fully download the file from your computer to be able to seed the file not that there isnt anyone willing to seed."
,BurnProcess,2009-12-01T10:05Z,"I'm pretty sure enough people fully downloaded this in the time I seeded to be able to return the seed, but I am going to seed some more and hopefully others will be nice enough to do the same."
,Razeal18,2009-12-01T19:31Z,and the seed left when i started to download of course this shit happens all the time
,BurnProcess,2009-12-23T05:23Z,"There are plenty of seeders, stop bitching."
,brawesome126,2009-12-30T01:42Z,"i downloaded it no problem and put it on my itunes without a problem. the videos play just fine on iyunes< but when i try and add the vids to my ipod it says "" the video was not added because it cant be played on this ipod"" any suggestions??????"
