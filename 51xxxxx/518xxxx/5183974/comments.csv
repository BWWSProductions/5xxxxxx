AVG 9.0 nor MSE detected it until i started it.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
,waza123,2009-12-27T22:08Z,"kora04 , this is not a trojan, its virus free. The only why some antiviruses say it's trojan, only because its packed with crypter or some other packers.

Here is screenshot, i jsut tested it, work nice and no problems, no any other proceses or registry entrys etc.

There is a simple way to use keygen/crackz -even if a real virus is attached:

Use Sandboxie from http://sandboxie.com/

it will NEVER infect your system but still you can use it.
