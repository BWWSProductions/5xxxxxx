    HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems      
    main health sensors: voltages, temperatures, fans speed.              
                                                                          
    The program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITE IT87       
    series, most Winbond ICs, and others. In addition, it can read        
    modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives      
    temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.            
    Special hardware monitors such as abit uGuru and Gigabyte ODIN        
    power supplies serie are supported too.                               
                                                                          
    In comparison to its classic counterpart, HWMonitor Pro adds the      
    following features:                                                   
    * Remote Monitoring - Watch the sensors of one or several distant     
      PCs through a simple TCP/IP connection.                             
    * Graph Generator - Save monitoring data and generate logging         
     graphs as bitmap files.                                              
    * Improved Interface - Sensors in system tray, editable sensors       
      labels ...                                                          
    * PWM Control - Fan PWM control (for ESA compliant devices).
