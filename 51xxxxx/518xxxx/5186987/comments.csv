If you're working with DDS textures, you may also find our DDS Utilities, Adobe Photoshop Plug-ins, and Windows Texture Viewer to be useful.

The shit is clean... tested in my virtual OS besides it is from Nvidia.... if you search more you find in internet a freeware named ""dds convertor 2.1""  It is a small app   http://eliteforce2.filefront.com/file/DDS_Converter;29412"

i have just downloaded your textures from piratebay and have 4 files

JBtex_PART1-15 zip
JBtex_PART2-15 zip
JBtex_PART3-15 zip
Higher terrain textures-15 zip

...........................................................................

when i unzip them (i unzip the files 1-3 all at once) i end up with

Very_high_textures_all_terrains exe
HDtextures_ver21 exe

............................................................................

if i then click on one of them it will produce a folder called 'overide'

i can do the same for the other 

my question is:_

if i unpack them into one folder, one trys to overwrite the other so which one do i copy into the      dragon age/packages/core/override  first ?and then let the other one overwrite

cheers
