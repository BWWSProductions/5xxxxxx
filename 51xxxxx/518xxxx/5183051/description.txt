Gangsters is played by alternating between turn-based and real time
gameplay. At the beginning you give orders to the gangsters (or 'hoods')
under your control, which are then played out in front of you during
the real-time aspect of the game (the working week).

To have any chance of winning the game, you must begin expanding your
territory by giving your hoods the order to extort businesses into
paying protection money to you every week (which must be collected).
You will also have to begin recruiting more hoods for your gang as
soon as possible by giving your hoods the recruit order. Additional
hoods can be recruited from gyms, pool halls, cafÃ©s, the docks and
the unemployment office.
