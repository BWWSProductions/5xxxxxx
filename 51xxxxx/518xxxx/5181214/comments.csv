,murrambingi,2010-08-09T18:07Z,"pfft your torrent don't work, all the files are locked and you can't extract them with WinRar or WinZip, i can see that you are trying to force people to donate to your website as it says in the txt file nice try butthole.."

,rkanjl,2011-06-11T14:54Z,"bigkandy10, you must have a program like winrar or winzip first.  Select all of the zipped files at the same time and ""extract here"".  You will get a new set of zipped files.  Select them altogether and ""extract here"" again.  You will then get a .zip file, ""extract here"" and you should get the .exe file.  Install, run, add a company name (make one up), enter the serial key provided in the info folder and that's it!  So easy a cave man could do it!  Just don't tell murrambingi, lol."
