I saw the original yesterday and they do compare in some ways, but it's far from a remake. Original is far darker and deeper and the acting is more ""in your face"" than this parody that makes it more entertaining and light.

All the offending stuff, the heavy shit is removed, and the ending is, well, I wont spoil either for you, but if you wanna laugh, see this, if you wanna see a real bad lieutenant, see the original..."
