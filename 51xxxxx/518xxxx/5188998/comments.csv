Most of the new enemies are added at higher player character levels, but the most obvious indicator of it not working right is this weird translucent pink triangle thing in the Jefferson Memorial rotunda.

Erm, so yeah, I have invisible and intangible Feral Ghoul Reavers whom I can't hit while they're missing their models :("

I downloaded only the version 1.7 patch that was an exe there.  That worked with my cracked version.

For Broken Steel, though, I don't think this torrent is enough: you also need to download the end game videos that go with it, but for the all four other expansions, I think it works fine as long as you have the patch.  I haven't fully tested it though and hopefully I'll post when I have it all figured out."
