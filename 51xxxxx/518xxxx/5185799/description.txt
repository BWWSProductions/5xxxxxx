[from wikipedia]
La Linea ("The Line") is an Italian animated series created by the Italian cartoonist Osvaldo Cavandoli. The series consists of 90 episodes which are about 2-3 minutes long each which were produced originally broadcast in the Italian channel Rai between 1972 - 1979. Over the years the series aired in more than 40 countries around the world. All episodes of the series are available today on DVD version.
Due to its short duration (usually 2 minutes 30 seconds), it has often been used in many networks as an interstitial program.
The tune played in the background of the series was created by Franco Godi.
