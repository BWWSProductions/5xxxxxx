,rockaway99,2009-11-28T18:07Z,"Thanks for the great albums. Leyden Zar was one I've been looking for. However, this one is actually Leyden Zar II. Their first album contained the song ""Backstreet Girl"". If you have it that would be great.

I also appreciate the Haywire album you posted earlier - that one was on my wish list as well."

Out of interest, what percentage of your records have you posted so far? Are we getting anywhere near 10% yet? "

[V],80zforever,2009-11-30T18:35Z,fizdude you're welcome my friend.
,snowy0505,2009-12-06T06:01Z,"Hey 80zforever - a big thanks for such a quick upload of The Little Heroes. That's awesome. 

Thanks too for pointing me to that Venetians album. I'd looked through what I thought was all your earlier selections of albums but obviously must have missed that one. You've posted so many by now that you almost need to post a document listing everything so that it's easy to search and find which collection particular albums are located in.

Anyway, thanks again and keep up the great work."
