Here's a few records you requested. I sure hope you'd enjoy 'em. To people who are new to my torrents. When you add what I have posted so far to the mainstream music of the 80's you already knew, it would be like an encyclopedia and a reference book. Go through these torrents and discover many talented bands/musicians that fell through the cracks.

Red 7 - When The Sun Goes Down [1987]
