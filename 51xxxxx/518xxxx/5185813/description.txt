Last release for today. :)

To tiered right now to come up with anything witty to say but here is the release i promised earlier. Perceptive readers might notice that v02 of the "extra stories" is missing and if anyone know where i could find it please drop a comment. :) 



As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. credits pages and possibly some fan art are included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.

Summery (From baka-updates manga who in turn attributes it to Viz)

Alita is a powerful cyborg with a soft heart and a mysterious past. Her second lease on life isn't easy: her heart is broken, she gains and loses friends to the cruel world of the Scrapyard far below the Utopian city of Tiphares, and she serves many masters in her quest to protect the innocent and create a new life for herself.
