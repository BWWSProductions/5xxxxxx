I click ""OK"" and the game quits. Help please?"
[T],Games4theworld,2009-12-30T13:06Z,"Hi,

  This should fix your problem:

Go to: C:\Program Files\Restaurant Empire 2\shader\shadowmf  and copy all the files in that map. Then go to C:\Program Files\Restaurant Empire 2\shader\shadowmi    and paste the files.

For more information, feel free to contact our (Live) Support: Games4theworld@hotmail.com"

  We're not familiar with that problem, maybe you could Google the problems or reinstall the Game."
