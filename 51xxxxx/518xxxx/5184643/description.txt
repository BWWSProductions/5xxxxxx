THE RISING won the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. 
"The Rising" won the 2003 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song 
and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance.

THE RISING was nominated for the 2003 Grammy Award for Album 
Of The Year."The Rising" was nominated for the 2003 Grammy 
Award for Song Of The Year.

Considering that the last time Bruce Springsteen 
collaborated with the E Street Band for a full album of 
new material was on 1984's epochal BORN IN THE USA, it's 
entirely appropriate that their 2002 album THE RISING should 
be forged from images strongly linked to the events of 
September 11th, one of America's most trying times. 

Virtually every song here is related to that tragedy 
either directly or indirectly. Some, like the surging 
"My City in Ruins" and the melancholy "Empty Sky" largely 
eschew metaphor, while others approach the situation from more 
oblique angles.

"Mary's Place" is a rousing roots-rocker about finding joy in 
the face of sadness, while both the Eastern-flavored "Worlds Apart" 
and the homegrown "Let's Be Friends" address the need for 
communication and understanding between disparate entities.

Musically, many of THE RISING's songs are in wide-screen, 
anthemic mode, as Bruce and company attempt to rally their wounded 
country with positivity and clear-eyed optimism without shrinking 
from unpleasant reality. 

The interstitial ballads take the poignant storytelling mode 
Springsteen employed on his last new album, 1995's THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD, 
and apply it to THE RISING's more universal themes. Whatever the format,
the enthusiastic camaraderie of the E Streeters and their Boss is audible 
and infectious.
