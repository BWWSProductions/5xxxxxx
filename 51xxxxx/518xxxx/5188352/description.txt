Muse have clearly gone off and explored their own possibilities, and the result is an album that rarely relents and surprises you with what's around the next bend. Really can't tell after one listen whether there are any huge hits on this record or whether the album is just one big adventure from a band who are really hitting their stride and unafraid of taking the lazy rehash path. The singles released thus far certainly don't do the album justice but perhaps offer digestible clues to this albums grandeur and the ever more sophisticated mad-scientist-ness that we've come to know and love from this Teignmouth trio. The symphony on the end is perhaps a bit much but then Muse have never been a band afraid of being bewilderingly over the top. 9/10
