,ioniancat21,2009-11-29T06:57Z,"Just to be clear to all: THIS IS WORKING!!!!

Many thanks to our Russian comrades over at CSmania.RU and impulse666 for this excellent working L4D2!!!

To install: Simply run the file ""L4D2_full_client_281109[csmania.ru].exe"" and the install process will begin. During setup you'll want to choose ""english' if needed at that point. 

Just to add, I played all 5 levels straight thru with cracks enabled and disabled with no crashes, even running modded files. Also, once installed, no disk or crack is needed, simply run L4D2 as usual.

NOTE: I updated my graphics card drivers before installing. If you find yourself crashing, you may need an update as I've passed this around and everyone is rocking this without issue."

definately a trojan inside.
Rusty Tankard your virus scanner is protecting you by not allowing you to run the .exe and has probably quarantined it. I have added it to the exceptions list in AVG and it runs.
