All the Paw Discs and recordings I have found.  This includes both major label releases, Dragline and Death To Traitors as well as Death To Traitors sessions, the independently released Home Is A Strange Place, Live At The Bottleneck - 2004, and a rare EP of covers and oddities Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself.

I did not create this torrent, merely downloaded and reproduced it to keep it alive as there are rarely any seeds.  I apologize as it is ripped at 128 Kbps, but it is better than not having it.  I saw a retail copy of Home Is A Strange Place listed for over $120 on-line, and this is free.  Complain all you want, just seed!

Enjoy!
