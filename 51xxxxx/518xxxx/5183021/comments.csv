,ubatch,2009-12-05T00:29Z,"""An error occurred while retrieving the license. (-7/500)"" Followed as instructed. Will try to reinstall and do it again though. Any advice if it doesn't work? Thanks."
,ubatch,2009-12-05T00:32Z,"Edit: I guess I didn't click Generate the first time and thought I did, or it created a bad serial. Working now, thanks!"
,camel1241,2009-12-09T06:26Z,worked fine after i realized the instructions had one mistake. when it tells you to change the version number in the keygen make sure to use 4.0.7.32 instead of what the instructions say 
,synthjocke,2009-12-22T06:33Z,Come one.. What AV?
,Siddha,2009-12-26T14:56Z,"Tried the fixes suggested by camel1241.  I copied new .lic file into the program folder with the .exe but still get license request when running the app.  
Any suggestions?  

NB  No error like ubatch had above, just app. not recognizing new lic. file.  "
,wwefan,2009-12-27T18:00Z,And I also agree and thank CAMEL on this one.  I did what he said from the get go and had no trouble at all.
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-01-19T16:31Z,Thanks. If I can remember I'll return here and let you know how things worked.
,MaBros,2010-01-22T10:38Z,"When I try to apply the patch from keygen, it says file not found.  It is still asking for a serial.  Any help would be appreciated.  Maybe what I'm doing wrong or maybe a working serial.  Thanks for the upload 50."
,MaBros,2010-01-22T10:38Z,also I'm running Windows 7 if that makes a difference.
,ferd2000,2010-01-23T02:04Z,"I followed all steps carefully and got it working in Vista, moved to 7 doing a clean install and tried again and am having the same problem as MaBros... any suggestions???"

,antiinsight,2010-01-31T21:51Z,no trojan found but it doesnt work anymore. It constantly asks for me to obtain a license when opening the program 
,computershell,2010-02-04T08:54Z,I got the keygen to work set compatibility to XP SP3 and everything started BUT the actual program wouldn't run VM error
,computershell,2010-02-04T10:14Z,"I now have it working with Win7 64bit using the tools available.
How?? Run everything as admin including install
User Computer name rather than User name
Allan-PC not just Allan. The keygen / activator will generate licence key in the correct place and needs setting to the version your installing 
4.0.7.32 BUT you will need to direct the Patch to the correct Path as it's set to Program files not Program Files (86) where it actually is.
Finally run in compatibility mode as XP SP3 and it will work, I have just edited out the ads in a TV program with it. Thanks to the uploader!!"
,thebigguyconnor,2010-02-06T05:55Z,"OK HERES THE DIRECTIONS FOLKS - AS MANY HAVE SAID, THERES SOME LICENSE VERIFICATION PROBLEMS.

FOLLOW THE README INCLUDED WITH THE TORRENT, BUT SUBSTITUTE 4.0.7.32 INSTEAD OF WHAT IS THERE NORMALLY!

IMPORTANT!

sorry for ""shouting"" - its just to get  the point across, some other comments that stated this aren't obvious enough to be noticed."
[T],Shepard76,2010-02-06T17:29Z,Is this clean of virus /trojans ? Thanks
,traxstar7,2010-02-16T13:07Z,"Thanks, works great on Win7 32bit."
,FilePile,2010-02-22T01:45Z,"lindery0611
Is correct. Spyware sample found in keygen.
Normally these keygens for this software are OK, but this one is not.
Avast 4.8 pro."

,xxgemini,2010-03-05T03:31Z,I got a False pos in Avast. No Virus in Keygen !!
,jamillionair,2010-04-14T05:05Z,when i generate the keygen where do i find it because it not show up on screen. 
,_purple_,2010-10-15T11:37Z,Why doesn't the application show any video preview in cut-edit and simulation? I'm using Windows 7 x64. Any suggestion?
,Enigma1990ad,2011-02-01T21:11Z,"The Preview and Simulation options DO NOT WORK. Any solution to this problem Colombo-bt? 
I am running Windows 7 32-bit OS btw. "
,jarlsberg_n,2011-03-15T17:59Z,"@  purple & Enigma1990ad.

You must have Apple - QuickTime on your pc for preview and simulation."
,jarlsberg_n,2011-04-20T11:12Z,"It took me a while to make it work on Vista 64b despite all the advice given here. Here is what I did (I already had a previous version installed; I followed the instructions given here plus one or two things):

1) Delete the old version (and delete the folder in program files\Pegasys Inc)
2) Delete the folder C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEncAuthoringWorks4
3) Delete the folder TMPGEnc in My Documents (Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s absolutely necessary, but it didnâ€™t work until I did it)
4) Install the new version
5) Right click on the Pegasys Inc folder, properties, Security, Modify, and grant total control to users, administrators and SYSTEM.
6) In the app folder, set compatibility mode to XP SP2 for the exe files, i.e. TMPGEncAuthoring Works4 and TMPGEncAuthoring Works4Batch [right click, properties, compatibility]
7) Run the app (i.e. TMPGEncAuthoring Works4) once and close it.
8) Restart (weird, I know, but when I ran the crack without restarting, it bugged, as if the app was still running and the crack couldnâ€™t access it)
9) Set keygen compatibility to XP SP2.
10) Run it as admin and change the version to: 4.0.12.42
11) Select the install folder.
12) Click on patch.
13) And then click on generate (even though it's the 1st button).

Hope it works for you



IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL ON WINDOWS 7 X64 BIT Version, change the Pegasys Inc Folder Location to c:\Program Files (THE X64 one and not THE c:\Program Files(x86))"
,Wesleyggm,2011-06-25T22:39Z,"jarlsberg_n, thank you so much!
It's working fine in w7 64bts."
,pchrb,2012-01-14T17:20Z,"Guys! 
Fortunately I didn't follow your instructions. Sorry.
The program's version is 4.0.7.32. This is what you 've got to type in keygen's ""version"" space. Else it won't get unlocked. Installation was done on xp system."
,awest1715,2012-04-25T03:53Z,Awesome upload man. Between all the advice I was able to get it to work. It's a clean upload according to my computer. If anyone is having trouble just try running the key gen a couple more times. That helped me. Thanks again!
