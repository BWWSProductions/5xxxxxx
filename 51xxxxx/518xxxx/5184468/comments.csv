vicerock, PLEASE, do not move my torrents to ""Handhelds"" category. Please.
I have no idea why you have done it...
I just have moved in from ""downed"" mininova, I do not need anyone to tell me what to do, especially without my consent. I have 300 000 downloads every month, I expect to be found by my ""audience"", people who are lost in this mess.

As the file-name says, [PC Mac XboX PS3 ipod] where ipod is on the last place, it is possible to play such file on ipod, it is good, ipod compatible encoding and that's all.

I DO NOT encode for Hanhelds exclusively and BTW, I will done it myself, right?

Sincerely, twentyforty."
