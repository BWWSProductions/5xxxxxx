,erikphnx,2009-11-28T04:47Z,Somehow I think I will still be discovering music long after all torrent sites are down. I have only listened to a small fraction of what you have provided. I intend to listen to it all.
,snowy0505,2009-11-28T08:40Z,"80zforever - awesome collection of tunes - so many rarities. I've been able to find quite a few tracks I've been after for ages so thanks a million.

You have a few old Aussie bands which is very cool - by any chance do you have anything by The Venetians, 'Pop Art' by Scribble, or 'Watch The World' (or any others) by Little Heroes? Have been trying to track these down since forever with no luck.

Thanks again and I'll be seeding as much of this as possible - have to keep P2P alive. Killing Mininova won't kill the torrent world."
[V],80zforever,2009-11-28T09:17Z,"Hi snowy, The Venetians - Calling In The Lions is already posted here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4923352/4_Rare_80s_Albums_[Part_64]_Glam_Rock__AOR__New_Wave

I have others you mentioned as well and I'd try to post them shortly. cheers"

,rtrifunov,2009-11-29T21:57Z,"I agree with you, erikphnx, 80zforever uploaded such an immense discography of fabulous rare gems, that we're not able to keep up with it.
One question. Do you 80z or anyone have early 80s Aussie albums like The Sports - Sondra (1981) or The Reels - Quasimodo's Dream (1981)?
Thanx in advance, God bless."

,Overfloat,2010-11-20T15:21Z,"Wow this is amazing, I'm  so glad I stumbled upon your downloads - 28th Day, Renaissance, Deserters and New Math are legendary! I can't believe they came to be so unpopular :-P
I should listen to everything you uploaded so far."
