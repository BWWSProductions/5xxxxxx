Hi,   Why is this 4.9 GB!  Thats HUGE!     

A normal film should be about 500 MB
??"
,The-Blob,2010-02-15T05:57Z,"Actually it's 4.2 GB. The reason is because it's a clone of the actual DVD so that you get high-quality that you can easily burn onto a DVD and play straight on your set-top DVD player. Those 500MB movie downloads are, to me, crap because the quality is poor and you have to go through a lot of trouble to burn to a DVD correctly. I am considering making lower-quality, smaller downloads available but for now I only provide the best, highest quality available. :)"
