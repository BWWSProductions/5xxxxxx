,gary85007,2009-12-03T21:59Z,It would be great if there was some instructions to convert this?  I've used MagicISO but it still doesn't work right.  Anyone else having a problem and could you some  solution?  Thanks!
,CompuTerror,2009-12-04T21:20Z,"Convert it? Why are you going to convert it?
It's a DVD-Audio of scary monsters... nothing to convert because it's done...

If you want it in DTS CD, you can download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5139324/ But you need to have a DTS capable player for it. The same with DVD-Audio... You need to be able to play DVD-Audio with your equipment"
,CompuTerror,2009-12-04T21:38Z,"Sorry... it's ""Station to Station"" I had accidently put ""Scary Monsters"" in the info, but I corrected that now. ""Station to Station"" is not uploaded in DTS CD. At least not by me"

,BigJohnLA,2010-09-14T02:36Z,I burned the ISO to a DVD then tried playing it in my DVD-Audio capable Samsung DVD player - it doesn't play.  Other DVD-Audio disks I own have some files in the VIDEO_TS folder; they also have two files in the AUDIO_TS folder that are missing here (DVDAUDIO.BUP and DVDAUDIO.MKB).  Has anyone been able to burn and play this in a DVD Audio player?  One of my all-time favorite albums so I really want it to work....
,sartre7,2010-10-12T04:05Z,"What is the source of this? I assume it's been upmixed from either a needledrop or regular CD-Audio since there never was a DVD-A or SACD released. Not even a genuine 5.1 dts, really. Better to wait for a proper release of the new DVD-A from the Deluxe reissue."
,Pantyboy_cocteau,2011-01-27T18:00Z,"I downloaded this file, but also cannot use it. 

The iso file burns just fine, using Nero. However, it creates a disk that no DVD drive can read. They all say the files are corrupt. 

Is this file region coded? 
Seeking advice from CompuTerror as to what to do here?"
,CompuTerror,2011-03-31T19:42Z,"Actually. I don't know, since my DVD isn't capable of DVDaudio. But the ISO is untouched from the source I downloaded it.

Sorry if it doesn't works for you, but I assumed it was legit."
