---------------------------------------
At the end of this week I am stepping down from the gordsmash title and giving it to my pal. I want to thank everyone for supporting gordsmash and uploading my torrents to keep them alive! I hoped that everyone of you has enjoyed my torrents! I want to thank all of you for supporting me! Thank you all and goodbye!"
