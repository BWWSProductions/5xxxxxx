Is this real?

I already downloaded one E10 from BT Junkie which was a moviex player P.O.S..

Says December 3rd on IMDB and this doesn't say it's preair in the description."
,DeltaPan,2009-11-30T14:46Z,"Sorry.

Australia had it first did they.

Caught out once already i'm obviously suspicious when IMDB says air date is 03/12."
[T],keka_umans,2009-12-01T09:23Z,yea guys the last 3 episodes i beleive came out a few days early. its called a pre-air.the rest of the season may be done but unreleased. vtv don't play around....atleast not in my experience
[T],keka_umans,2009-12-01T09:34Z,he shoulda checked the file tho divx player reports 1min 40 secs and media player crashes at the same time....divx player(7) will play more than the 1:40 but you cant skip with-in the video. A/V quaility is perfect. i don't use VLC so you may find it'll play it no prob
