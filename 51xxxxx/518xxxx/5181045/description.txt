THE CROSSOVER EVENT OF THE CENTURY IS HERE! The heroes of the Image Universe are united in order to fight the greatest threat the world as ever faced! You can't miss this historic event as the original Image Founders draw all the characters they made history with. Each page is an amazing jam piece - it's a story told in a way never before attempted in comics!

Also includes Haunt back-up story.
