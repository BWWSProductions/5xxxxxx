However, the movie was shot in English language. English is the correct original main language of the movie. I hope that rippers out there will take that into account and always rip undubbed audio. Thank you for this release. Mostly appreciated."

Had never watched the full version (makes more sense actually), never had watched the english (original) version. Rosanna Arquette in her best age :)) Image/ sound quality : perfect. And with the right ending indeed :) Dynamite file. "
