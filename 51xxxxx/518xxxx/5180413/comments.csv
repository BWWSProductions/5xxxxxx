>>>>>>>>Here is how to set it up:

The original downloaded files are in zip format, and are divided in many folders when you extract each one of them.

Best program to use to extract all zip files into one single folder, is to use winzip(shareware) or 7-zip(freeware) and specifiy to extract all files into one folder (say folder 1 on desktop)

Now you'll find they are all compressed in RAR format, it is now you click on ""eatco1.rar"" to extract the files once again, into 3 final files.  1 setup, 1 info file and 1 crack.

1. Install Setup
2. Copy and replace original CaptureOne.exe with the one in the crack folder

Done"

,jjdecay,2009-12-16T13:12Z,"files are corrupt,setup.exe doesn't work."
,sjprg,2009-12-17T04:20Z,"Only installs trial, crack does not work with either Windows or XP"
,zelen0,2010-01-02T19:32Z,"This is indeed Windows version.
Installation works fine.

Note that you should not run the ""crack"". The instruction says to install via setup.exe, then replace the captureone.exe with cracked file - and it works just fine."
