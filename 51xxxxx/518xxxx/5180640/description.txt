Code calculator for Renault radios...

I have used this on many different Renaults,the lastest registration i have tried this with was a 1999 Megane-Please post what year and car you try this with and if it works.

Usage-

Run "CALC PHILIPS DE DOS" and when asked for the pre-code enter the last 4 digits from the barcode sticker of your radio-usually 1 letter and 3 numbers.

If you have any probs just leave a message and i'll help as much as i can.
