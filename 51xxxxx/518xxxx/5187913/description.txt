Collection of comics based on the Japanese movie monster Godzilla published by Marvel and Dark Horse.  

The Marvel series told original stories and attempted to fit into the official Toho continuity, while avoiding direct references to it. It integrated Godzilla into the Marvel Universe. It was published from 1977 to 1979, fitting between the Showa Period movies and the Heisei Era. This series described the adventures and confrontations of Godzilla in the United States.

Dark Horse started with a six-issue mini-series reprinting the manga adaptation of the original Japanese version of the film Godzilla 1985.  Godzilla then appeared in his own series which ran for 17 issues and several specials.
