,Agent0007,2009-11-30T07:40Z,NoDVD ?? ???????? (doesn't works)
,mahak420,2009-12-01T09:33Z,"As given in the torrent description :- ""if you get an error when you try to apply the crack go inside the crack app an replace the existing ipatcher file with the one that came with the torrent. contents/MacOS/ipatcher""


I tried this and it was sucessful...."
,Josh_posh,2009-12-03T18:06Z,I LOVE U ALL!!!! Great game.
,Uralte_Sage,2009-12-06T22:11Z,"@mahak420: What did you do to change the read/write permissions of the crack? All options to change permissions seem to be greyed out, so I'm unable to put the newer ipatcher in place of the old one?"
,rollmft,2009-12-14T18:37Z,"i'm having the same problem as Uralte_Sage -- how do you alter the read/write privileges to manipulate files within the crack folder? (mine are also grayed-out.) i'm unable to delete the original or cut/paste the new ipatcher file from the torrent into the crack file.

thanks in advance for the help."
,Dane.C,2009-12-24T17:12Z,Does this game just not work with Macbooks? Cause I've applied to patch properly and everything but whenever the game starts up... I just get a black screen. Does this sound familiar?
,DJbillyE,2010-01-06T23:26Z,"Okay i have no idea, whats going on, were to apply the patch, or how to???? please someone help me the instructions dont make any sense to me, when i try to open the patch i just get an error msg?? can anyone help"
,tommmmrawwr,2010-01-13T22:47Z,"Downloaded swiftly enough, but suffering the same problems as Uralte_Sage and rollmft.
Can't replace the old iPatcher with the new one, so seems pretty redundant tbh. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
,L4ngbein,2010-10-25T11:43Z,can someone please tell us how we can replace the ipatcher? plz?
,dan98mg,2010-11-22T23:46Z,"ok here is how to do it
1. right click on Imperial ""Glory 1.0 NoDVD"" 
2.click show package contents new window should open 
3. open foder named contents, open fodder named MacOS there should be an ""iPatcher"" in there
4.with the contents that you downloaded there should be something named ""ipatcher.zip"" double click on it and an new program should appear  called ""ipatcher""
5.take that program and put it in the fodder with the other one it should replace it
6.open the program ""Imperial Glory 1.0 NoDVD"" and put the game ""imperal glory"" in the  checked marked box that opened when u opened ""Imperial Glory 1.0 NoDVD"" it should over write it
7.it should work and happy gaming
if you have an trouble or just want to say thx just e-mail me at dan_the_mantex98mg@hotmail.com
o and before i forget when u patch the game and open it your screen will be black just be patient this is it loading it will take anywhere from 30sec to 2 min "
,Lukasu,2010-12-23T08:53Z,how do i install the game
,enjaze,2011-01-07T02:51Z,If I don't have permissions to write in the Mac OS file (though I am logged on as the one who is supposed to have access according to the permissions sections of the info page) how do I change that so I can put in the new ipatcher?
,jesusshockwave,2011-02-25T03:50Z,Thank you man!
,sidanvekar11,2012-02-09T04:12Z,neither the nodvd.dmg or the ipatcher works....:(
