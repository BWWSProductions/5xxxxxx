[V],thethingy,2009-12-14T17:27Z,where does bcm state it is not activated?
,donixa3,2010-01-25T05:14Z,"Is this really working?
I already try to install it, but it wasnt working

I did setup and configure outlook first, and then install BCM,
Do i really need to install BCM first without opening Outlook?

Can i use this BCM with other office installation not from yours?"
,donixa3,2010-01-25T05:50Z,this BCM successfully installed and database created
,Tibby12,2010-02-18T21:19Z,Have been using it now since your upload. Works just perfect. Thx. And now I got hooked on Office 2010. Could you (if you can) be kind and provide BCM for Office 2010 as well?

,Zar137,2012-06-30T17:43Z,tried downloading got halfway through and get this: setup failed to install the required component MS SQL Server 2005 Express (MSSMLBIZ) after looking in the summary log everything is successful except MSXML 6 Service Pack 2 (KB973686) when I download this hot fix it goes to install then says setup was interrupted before MSXML 6 SP2 (KB973686) could be installed. Your system has NOT been modified. I have search for solutions online but everything I've tried is not working. Can you please help with the hotfix so I can install? 
,Zar137,2012-06-30T19:30Z,"Update: I went ahead and start Windows Utility Clean-up tool and remove SQL files & MSXML then restated my computer. Now BCM installed after ran the BCM data tool. Now when I started MSO I got the welcome screen, did the express install registration with no personal info and now it keeps prompting me here with the welcome screen even after completed. Any ideas why its not working? I almost there.   "
