Okay, ... 

First, I have a small upload, so plz check the date before posting "plz seed", sometimes my connection drops, unfortunatly and this torrent is a big huge!

Secound, this was hard work getting them together, renaming, sorting, threw the lists whats missing, labling and so on.

Third, it is not complete, some books are missing (not much tbh), a few are hard to read (also not much), but meanwhile I think I am not going to work further on it, so better then nothing I would say, ... not perfect, but good imo!

Forth, so that u can pick what u miss, I have not packed the files, ... guess we all have to live with it!

Fifth, yes it includes other torrents, ... I even went so far and took the folder setup from someone else. 


Finally, ... as I was unhappy with any other torrents, I made this one, and think it should be the most complete oWoD torrent. 


Have fun!
Kind regards!
