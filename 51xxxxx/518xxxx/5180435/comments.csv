,drednought,2010-02-02T01:34Z,"i've been downloading this torrent for some time now and was quite looking foward to reading much of it. 
unfortunately every time i open one of the pdfs adobe acrobat/reader crashes and i get the windows error reporting message, any help would be appreciated."
,kindach,2010-02-03T22:16Z,"Yes, I am aware of this problem with some pdfs. In order to read them all, u need Foxit Pdf reader and Acrobat. 
For instance MtA: Corerulebook (3rd) will not open with Foxit but with Acrobat and so do others only open with Foxit at mine."
,kindach,2010-03-02T00:53Z,"Hey all!

Close to give v2 the finishing touch, should be available at least at the end of the month!"
,Arcanus1973,2010-08-11T04:45Z,"Hey kindach, in your missing files you listed a few That I have.. would you like them."
,dziban303,2010-09-19T07:25Z,"@Kindach

Like Arcanus, I have some of the missing items in your list. So either put out a call for what you need or upload your v2 like you said you would NINE FUCKING MONTHS AGO.

Thanks."
,Valmont1982,2010-09-28T19:31Z,"Clan Novel 1: Toreador is incomplete right now. It cuts off at about a third of the book. I dont have a full copy, couldnt google one off-hand either.

Interest for OWOD will return given that the WOD MMO has now been announced as OWOD-based. OWOD books are being reprinted as this is typed and PDF versions with better quality redistributed for the whole line.  "
