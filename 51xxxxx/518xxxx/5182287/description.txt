Rip schwigger, Edit+Re-encode mg56

From orbitcast:

Over the years the dysfunctional family lives and upbringings of Sirius XM hosts 
Gregg "Opie" Hughes, Anthony Cumia and Jim Norton have been the subject of many 
memorable Opie & Anthony Show moments.

Now, for the first time, these classic tales have been collected into a hilarious 
Thanksgiving special: "Sharing the Laughter and Love: An O&A Family Special."

And who better to host such a show than someone who knows a little something of 
dysfunctional families... Jerry Springer himself.

Opie, Anthony and Jim "Yimmy" Norton will reveal favorite family dysfunctional 
memories and moments, while Springer will introduce these tales. Throughout the 
special, Springer will offer up his inimitable commentary on all the twisted and 
hilarious memories of family dysfunction.

Highlights of the "Opie & Anthony Family Special" include:

* Opie reveals that his parents were so frugal, he used to have to carry his 
  school lunches in old cement bags and shopping bag.
    
* Anthony recalls the time the uncle who lived with this family grew pot in the 
 backyard garden, but told Anthony's mother it was an "oregano hybrid."
    
* Jim Norton reminisces about his imaginary childhood friends, including a 
 superhero version of him, an old lady with a beehive, and the band KISS.
    
* The rest of the O&A crew share their stories of mother issues, including 
 abandonment, being disowned, physical and financial threat.



Note: Friday November 27th will be my last "early" 64k upload. 
Starting with Nov. 30th and on, I will upload the 128k vbr 
mp3's in the evenings. If you listen a day late, you'll be 
fine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,
you'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will 
be doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending
schedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.
