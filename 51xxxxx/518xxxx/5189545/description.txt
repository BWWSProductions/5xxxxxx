Jackie is crushed to be mere runner up for queen, so Kelso's girl, not the other way around. Hyde came with some of 'his best', to build a party his style in coach's office, gets caught in the act, but when coach hears about his phobia -tornado- decides to try something: smoking weed! Fez and Rhonda decide also to get rid of their virginity, but... Meanwhile Bob and his floozy Joanne Stupac, who have no shelter, kill time in Red's basement, and his mood... The only ignorant one is Eric, who forgot to bring Donna, whom he promised a ride, and thus arrives at the radio station, where she was left alone, as saving hero, but too scared to drive back, so they spend time alone there and kiss again...

Fez can think of nothing but fat Rhonda's promise to 'share something' with him, so he gets Leo's permission to use the Photohut and Kitty's advice 'for a friend' about 'doing it', but Rhonda feels because she loves him best...

Vicious 'girlfriend' Jackie shows her jealous nature by first pretending it's not true, then it's not important, finally trying to make him give it up 'because modeling is her dream', and when that fails turning to her Cheese Palace boss, Todd. Fez begged till Hyde gave him a driving lesson in his El Camino, but by the time he gets to drive a few meter- that's too far, being backward, so the rear section is damaged to the tune of $80; Leo, who stood there, lands in hospital, where he enjoys Kitty's care so much he continues to woo her after his discharge, while she feels that doesn't annoy Red enough.
