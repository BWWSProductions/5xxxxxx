,ratt101,2009-11-30T09:04Z,"Good Luck and i hope it does work

hint

if you are using utorrent under options click on preferences click bandwidth make sure the automatic is checked off

then off to the races

cheers"
,ratt101,2009-11-30T09:05Z,"i mean make sure the check mark is there

checked on"
[T],keka_umans,2009-11-30T11:25Z,"theres a section in the forum that will clearly answer all your questions. the most important part is seeding,that is sharing a completed download, currently there are no seeds to download from"
[T],keka_umans,2009-11-30T12:14Z,everyone is stuck at 60 percent...you need to seed the other 40%of the file
,iPh0ne,2009-11-30T12:38Z,lol pedos... they are like homos. they just don't know how technic stuff works. XD
[T],keka_umans,2009-11-30T13:06Z,torrent is a waste of time just under 200 peers. still no seed. done wastin my time....read the how to upload section pal
[T],keka_umans,2009-11-30T13:07Z,-21 on the quality...lets see how low that can get
,zyzykwy,2009-11-30T15:16Z,"sorry, computer shut off overnight while I slept, back on now and I think I have it set to unlimited upload speed.  I'm using BitTorrent and it is claiming that there are several seeds and 130+ peers.  I hope restarting my computer helps."
,GAZZA2008,2009-11-30T18:35Z,dumb ass!
,zyzykwy,2009-11-30T22:47Z,over 100 seeds now so I guess it all worked out.
,ratt101,2009-11-30T23:57Z,"yay you did it

yeah i think you were  doing something wrong check to see if you can  set it to automatic on your bittorrent

Also what keka_umans said read the forums

but dont worry about the quality every one knows thats always wrong

cheers"
,zyzykwy,2009-12-01T02:56Z,"thank you Ratt101, my second torrent seems to be going out OK as well, TPB keeps showing no seeds by my client says 2 seeds and everyone else at 18% +/- so I don't know what's going on, but the few encouragements will keep me trying when all the negatives would make me stop sharing."
[T],keka_umans,2009-12-01T17:33Z,torrent is fully seeded and working fine now... good job i'd suggest Utorrent as opposed to bittorrent. appearence is almost identical however more people agree utorrent runs better
,zyzykwy,2009-12-01T21:12Z,"Apparently -21 wasn't the bottom, currently at  -966, is that a record?"
