SEA URCHIN was started back in 2004 under the guise of Godzilla On Demand (or G.O.D for short) by Smudge (Ex-Deimos) and Peeps, both founding members of Unborn Son back who have now disbanded. Our first release the â€˜Demo Of Doomâ€™ was the first lot G.O.D material to be released which was a 3 track demo which was mainly to see how the band sounded and the sound was slow, heavy doom. They we quickly followed that up with â€˜Godzilla On Demand EPâ€™ which had more melody to the songs and a much tighter sound in all. It had 5 tracks and lasted for 28 minutes. 

Through many different name changes and splitting up twice! (Fuck, we feel like an oldies band!) we have decided to give this whole thing one more shot. We also had to change yet again due to Japanese lawyers deciding to sue anyone using the name 'Godzilla' if they don't own the rights to. So after much debate and discussion we decided upon SEA URCHIN. 
We are currently writing/recording material for our new album which should hopefully be out around the end of summer 2009. I know every band says this but going by some of the riffage at rehearsals this sounds like it will probably be our heaviest shit to date! Keep an eye on our player for demo tracks/samples/yada yada. 

Other than that, enjoy, hate.. Whatever!
