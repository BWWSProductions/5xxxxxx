,Crimacabre,2009-11-29T14:33Z,"Download the other torrent, the BDrip, it has better quality. The audio is not good in this torrent."

,Casabian84,2009-12-01T13:38Z,I don't mind the Final Destination films but this one is terrible. If you download you will be disappointed.

,STS-25,2009-12-02T06:33Z,thanks
,TheWiiplayTeam,2009-12-02T06:44Z,"There is no video, only sound. 
I tried in multiple video players, but none of them worked. "
,TheWiiplayTeam,2009-12-02T08:24Z,"Sound 7/10  Video 0/10. 
After redownloading this 2 times, it still does not work. 
Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong? 
I am using Miro to download and play, but it doesn't play in Real Player, Miro or the DivX Player. 

What am I doing wrong?  
The files downloaded correctly, but all I get is a green screen. 
Now it will not load at all, and it says the file is not an avi file. ?  

What am I doing wrong? "
,TheWiiplayTeam,2009-12-02T08:29Z,"In VLC, it will work for about 5 minutes, then it will stop. 
It is now saying that the file is corrupted. 

.......
It appears to be working now, but with no sound :( "
,TheWiiplayTeam,2009-12-02T12:39Z,"I resolved my problems, and the movie was actually really good! 
Audio is about a 9.5, and video is a 10. 
Although it is not recommended to watch this on your 50 inch HDTV, as it will be a little distorted. 
I would give the movie itself a solid 9.0, but be warned, this is not a movie for children, and it is very gruesome, and it contains nudity and sexual scenes. Just a word of advise from a tired guy who has been up all night watching movies. "
,Underworld,2009-12-03T13:20Z,Thanks!
,Skull_13,2009-12-03T22:05Z,"seed y'all....i just dl 8 Mile in 15 minutes, i know it aint my connection. i'm only getting this torrent at ~20 kb/s....and it has a lot more seeders than 8 mile did....."
,LiquidInsanity,2009-12-06T00:28Z,"As usual another XviD non working piece of shit. Extremezone, is it cool now to up-load a blank file?"
,z0m613,2009-12-08T01:25Z,The audio quality is terrible.

,casino9876,2009-12-11T20:39Z,"btw if you have no sound, or no video download VLC would only take you 2 mins, and alot better than WMP"
,casino9876,2009-12-12T22:00Z,"if people wanted to watch it online they would search for that, instead there here wanting to DOWNLOAD it you spaming fuck, g advertise ur website elsewhere, its obviously shit if you need to market it here"
,kbowk2,2009-12-16T13:24Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD.  Its crap.  I love the first movie.  And the 2nd even thou it was a little cheesy with unknown actors, the third was OK.  But this is terrible Especially the last scene.  Whats with the skeletons depicting what's happening.  We want to see it.  Disappointed enough to come back and warn you. "

,XMaramena,2011-08-26T17:21Z,"Great movie - good quality, good audio. Looks like they ran out of budget at the end though - it's that quick ""what wait... that's the end?"" ending. Not that this comment should spoil much because there's no way you could know it's coming!"
