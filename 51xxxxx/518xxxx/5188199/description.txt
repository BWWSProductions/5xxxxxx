Bukka White goes down in history as having hits both musically as a bluesman and as a pitcher in the Negro Leagues. He met and studied under Delta blues legend Charley Patton as a young man and later recorded tracks for Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, White relocated to Memphis, TN where he lived with â€“ and mentored â€“ younger cousin Riley "B.B." King. This Biograph recording was Whiteâ€™s last, recorded three years prior to his death.
