Email me if you are looking for an album in Lossless/FLAC (even obscure ones). I'd be willing to send you a link to it if you would share the album on publicbt/thepiratebay after you finish downloading it. My email: centroids1@gmail.com

Julian Casablancas of the Strokes releases his first solo album, thus leaving Nick Valensi as the only Stroke not to go solo.

The tracklist runs:

1. "Out of the Blue" 4:41
2. "Left & Right in the Dark" 4:54
3. "11th Dimension" 4:03
4. "4 Chords of the Apocalypse" 4:59
5. "Ludlow St." 5:42
6. "River of Brakelights" 5:08
7. "Glass" 5:20
8. "Tourist" 5:02

According to the liner notes, all the music was arranged by Julian Casablancas. All the words and music was written by Julian Casablancas. However, to prevent any hint of confusion, the liner notes point out that the chord progression in the chorus of '4 Chords of the Apocalypse' was written by Fab Moretti, Nick Valensi and Julian Casablancas.
