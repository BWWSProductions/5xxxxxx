The Climatic Research Unit e-mail hacking incident, also known as Climategate,[1][2][3] began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server used by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, England, in the United Kingdom. An unknown individual stole[4] and anonymously disseminated over a thousand e-mails and other documents.[5][6][7] The university confirmed that a "criminal breach" of their security systems took place,[8] but could not confirm the authenticity of the material at short notice,[9] and expressed concern "that personal information about individuals may have been compromised."[10] Details of the incident have been reported to the police, who are investigating.[5] Later, Phil Jones, Director of the CRU, confirmed that all of the leaked emails that had provoked heated debate appeared to be genuine.[11]
