,biggus.dictus,2009-11-29T03:49Z,Thanks. How about French?
,123dutch,2009-11-29T11:57Z,"sorry, Spanish was the only thing I could find. I would like to have more also. But if I will find more of Fluenz I will definitely share it."
,universekkk,2009-11-29T14:11Z,"Thank you very much for sharing. I downloaded both of them. Fluenz spanish 2 works very well and I can play the iso file with Daemon. However, fluenz spanish 1 doesn't work, I couldn't play the iso file with any software. When I extracted the whole file, ""keep broken files"" is grey so I couldn't choose it. Any suggestion?"
,123dutch,2009-11-29T15:18Z,"I only used ""kep broken files"" when I downloaded it the first time from R@pidshare. Then the ISO I got is the one I shared here on torrents. So you don't need to use that option anymore. Just burn the ISO with any programm. It should run just fine :)"
,universekkk,2009-11-29T15:25Z,"I see, I will try to burn a DVD tomorrow, fingers Xed that it will work :) BTW, do you have ""Visual Link Spanish"" by any chance?"
,Triffstar,2009-11-29T15:46Z,"Hi dutch, would just like to say thanks for the torrent, been looking awhile for this.

But I think there is a problem with the Fluenz 1 iso as universekkk said. I have tried mounting the iso in several programs and when i try to run the install exe I get ""not a valid win32 operation error"".

Now if your iso works 100% before you uploaded it then perhaps something has corrupted when rar-ing it.

I've done a check in winrar and nothing seems wrong with the actual rar imo.

Let us know what you can find thanks!

Also if anyone has got the Fluenz 1 cd working let us know!"
,universekkk,2009-11-29T15:55Z,"I also saw the ""not a valid win32 operation error"" when I tried to run the fluenz.exe file. Just like Triffstar, I tested the file with winrar too and it turned out ok. So maybe something went wrong in the rar-ing process?"
,123dutch,2009-11-29T22:33Z,"Hi all, I burned the iso and then run it on a WIN7x86 system. It runs fine.
I shared the ISO that I downloaded.

Maybe with that ISO I was lucky?
If no one gets it working then maybe I should UP an new image made from my dvd that workes?

What do you guys think?"
,universekkk,2009-11-29T22:47Z,A new image from your working DVD will be fantastic! I will be looking forward to it. Thanks a lot Dutch!
,123dutch,2009-11-30T00:37Z,"For the people having problems with this torrent, I have uploaded a new one. This time I made an ISO of my working DVD.

,artulito,2010-12-15T08:41Z,"Unfortunately, this doesn't work well, half of the files in the iso are corrupted. Maybe there's something wrong in the iso-ing prosess."
,akkino,2011-09-03T09:41Z,Thanks for this program. Can anyone upload the fluenz spanish 3 4 5?
