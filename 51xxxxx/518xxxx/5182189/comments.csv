,brianxxx,2009-12-09T01:21Z,"Love that you provide this! Paragon is really great stuff. I have used them for years. Forget Norton Ghost. The only thing comparable or maybe better is Acronis programs. 

But I have found that I use them both since sometimes one gets weird and the other saves the day.


Thanks AOL!!!!!!"
