,baracus1983,2010-03-16T03:22Z,"this is like paradise - its really overwhelming what 80zforever has uploaded - i always was looking for rare aor pop 80s musik and never really knew where to ask or where to look.

please upload more obscurities like : stabilizers , glen burtnick , nik kershaw - mostly synth based pop/ aor from around 86 !!!!!!!! thats the greatest kind of music "
