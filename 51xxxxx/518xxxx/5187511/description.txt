New in 5.1c

Changes to support wez AtomicParsley --longdesc

Includes new AtomicParsley.  You must install this if you are using appletv and the output file is over 2gb.  You will get a fatal AtomicParsley error otherwise when it tries to tag the file.

Just a note, if you use the -I option with -t appletv you may experience framerate slow down in certain scenes (with Apple TV playback).

New in 5.1b

Added support for Apple TV Cabac/trellis mode with option -I

Apparently this works and Apple TV published specs are wrong for some reason.

-----------

New in 5.1a

Logic error surrounding new ffmpeg -codecs that was introduced in 5.0c
Most likely wouldn't effect anyone.  It wasn't setting the output format type correctly.
