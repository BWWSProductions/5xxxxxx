,aaxte666,2010-05-18T18:01Z,Does it work on windows?
,d_sellers1,2010-05-31T19:34Z,"Just FYI, the serial posted above works on v2.7.6 (7 April 2010).  

@ aaxte666 - The description says it is for WinAll; I'm running Win7 and Airfoil started up just fine."
,graydj,2010-11-05T02:37Z,"Just plugged it in and it worked! Thanks!

P.s. enter the registration code quickly, unless you want to piss your neighbours off with Airfoil's white noise!"
,Lillbrandt,2011-02-02T20:10Z,"Cant get the registration key to work, am I doing something wrong?"
,uzer4o,2011-07-12T21:59Z,Anybody notice any latency ?
,caapel,2011-09-19T13:15Z,Where is the serial?
,Ugot2fly,2011-10-05T22:40Z,Doesn't seem to work anymore on the 3.1.0 version!! Any idea where to download the 2.7.5 version?
,95410,2011-11-25T02:12Z,"Lillbrandt - definitely. Registration key is in the description.

uzer4o - yes, there is some latency which is because of the airplay protocol. 1,5 - 2 seconds maybe

caapel - serial is in the description

Ugot2fly - THIS is the 2.7.5 version. uninstall 3.1.0 and then reinstall this if you want to downgrade."
,95410,2011-11-26T04:54Z,"Actually I have about 4 seconds latency atm with spotify + airport express. Which is fine for music listening purposes. So don't use this for video: you'll have to plug in a cable for the picture anyway, so while you're at it plug another cable in for audio."
