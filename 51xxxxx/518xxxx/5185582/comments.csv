Yeah, I prefer to seed by hand, see, I go to the field with the seeds in my pocket, semi-wet beforehand, then I push them in the soil about 1.5 inches deep, then WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT????

Just seed to 1.00001:1 ratio or 500:1, you choose, and you are good to go man for devil's shake!"
