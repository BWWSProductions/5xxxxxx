,teh__masterer,2009-12-30T12:19Z,"Massive kudos to the uploader. The torrent is one hundred percent clean and works perfectly. If you come up against a fatal error during installation, you might wish to upgrade to the latest version of Windows Installer, which you may download for free from Microsoft Download Center. In case you get a fatal error or an Error 1628 after one or more interrupted or failed installations, just use Task Manager to kill all instances of msiexec.exe, as sometimes Windows Installer does not fully close, thus preventing any other installations from being run. That will most likely do the trick. Just a heads-up: if you have a newer ATI graphics card (4xxx, 5xxx), do yourself a favour and DO NOT install the patch, or the game will freeze at the splash screen. Furthermore, Microsoft Visual C++ 2002 Redistributable Package (actually, MSVCP71.DLL and MSVCR71.DLL) and Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 or newer are required for the game to work properly. Both can be downloaded for free from the aforementioned Microsoft Download Center. If the game still freezes or crashes, make sure Lighting Quality isn't set to Very High - on some graphics cards, any setting other than Low makes indoor scenery abnormally dark, so yeah, bear that in mind. Enthusiasts, feel free to keep it on Very High and just change r_Quality_BumpMapping to 2. If nothing of this solves your problem, do read the ReadMe file. It can be rather useful. Also, make sure your DirectX and graphics drivers are up to date. If you still can't get it to work, you probably are:
a) 12 or younger (see b)
b) intellectually inferior to your average gorilla
c) using an x64 version of Vista (see b)
d) an owner of a machine that's at least a decade old (see b, not because the machine's old, but for trying to run FC on it)...
...so give up. You ain't running it. Hope that helps. Cheers. Thanks again for the awesome torrent. Will seed for a long time.

-TM"

,horstmayer,2010-01-04T20:45Z,"i installed the game and i put the crack in the game folder but when i want to run it , i got the error ""put in correct cd  ....why? 

pls help :')"
,pjmartins4422,2010-01-05T01:34Z,"first reinstal the game... then if u don´t know here to put the crack, just mount the firt cd and it will works... :)"
,teh__masterer,2010-01-06T17:47Z,"I guess the instructions should've been a bit clearer - that would enable those who are new to piracy to install the game easily, as well as the hardcore ones. The cracked .exe is supposed to be put into the bin subfolder inside the install directory, not directly into the folder where you'd installed Far Cry (e.g. if you installed it to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Crytek\Far Cry, put the .exe inside C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Crytek\Far_Cry\bin). Hope that helps. Cheers."

,zSerJz,2010-02-21T15:20Z,Pjmartins I have problem in the 3rd stage Fort. When I'm near finishing the stage there appears the video with Jack Carver sneaking behind the commander who has the red card. But this video appears when I'm not in that building and when I go in that building the commander isn't there and I can't finish the stage because I don't have the red card! :|

,Jovcha,2010-04-12T21:36Z,"Pandaman, you might wish to read the previous comments. The problem you're having seems like the typical msiexec.exe issue. Just kill it and restart the install. Just to be sure, don't start the install from AutoPlay, but do it manually, from the launcher on the 1st disc. Hope that does it. Cheers."

If you're a Win XP user just like me, then this is the best Far Cry torrent out there. Because you need this 1.4 patch.. fixes something with the engine or something with the graphics i belive. Because without the 1.4 patch, there is only but a black screen.. LOL"

,the_n00bthatneedzhelp,2011-01-11T16:06Z,"hey, i got a kind of problem.

i have cracked it and mounted it with daemon tools
and when i went in to the game it all was okey, but when i came outside the ground was light blue and stuff :(

please help me :P"

,pollix568,2011-04-16T18:37Z,ps error 1311 is the same as verify if data1.cab exists and if you can access to it
,kolokythis,2011-04-28T15:30Z,Warning: It's better to change the controls settings after starting the campaign. Otherwise maybe your mouse will not respond (can't look around etc). If this happens go to main menu and set the controls to default. Everything else works perfectly. Many thanks to the uploader.
