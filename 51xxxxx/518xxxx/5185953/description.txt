This is essentially an update of Dirkdiglie's incredibly useful torrent "Ultimate Marvel - Complete (as of 10-17-08)".
This is everything, right here, in one torrent.
I've included a couple of reading orders to help you make sense of all of this.
Enjoy.

EDIT: ULTIMATES 3 AND ULTIMATE HUMAN SEEM TO BE MISSING FROM THIS TORRENT. I HAVE UPLOADED THEM SEPARATELY HERE: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5242881

EDIT 2: FF ANNUAL 002 AND SM ANNUAL 003 DON'T SEEM TO BE INCLUDED ON THE COMPREHENSIVE READING ORDER. THE SPIDER-MAN READING ORDER DOES INCLUDE IT, AS DOES THE FANTASTIC FOUR READING ORDER - SO IF YOU NEED TO KNOW, CHECK THERE.
