,willyqpublic,2009-11-30T02:09Z,Really great torrent! Thanks!
,crackfiend76,2009-12-13T15:33Z,"Is it just me, or are some of the files missing?  when I Dl'ed (awesome torrent btw) I couldn't find ultimate human...or Ultimates 3..someone explain"
[T],Juan.Too,2009-12-14T02:49Z,"@crackfiend76

Here's the explanation: I fucked up.
I noticed the missing folders a few days ago and it really pissed me off.  I can't tell you how many times I checked and re-checked to make sure I had everything.  My only guess is that I dragged a folder into the wrong place while I was organizing everything.
I'm in the process of rectifying the situation.  I've noticed ""Ultimates 3"" and ""Ultimate Human"" are missing, has anyone noticed anything else?  Now would be a great time to mention it.
Actually, I'm surprised it took this long for someone to notice (it took ME this long because I actually have all the files on my computer, they just didn't end up in the torrent).

Anyway, give me a little bit and I'll figure out what to do."
,CooLxKiDx,2009-12-22T21:40Z,"Awesome, sir. Just great...

[T],Juan.Too,2009-12-26T23:08Z,"In case you didn't catch it above:
I've created a new torrent that fills in the holes from this one - Ultimates 3 and Ultimate Human.

,phelpzy,2010-01-15T11:12Z,"i have a question, im new to torents, do i need a program to read them? im on a brand new computer thats running Windows 7, will this torrent or the other that has ultimate human and ultimates 3 effect the computer? like is is virus free. i know this is a bad place to ask all of this but idk where else to. ANY help will be appriciated"
[T],Juan.Too,2010-01-16T22:25Z,"@ phelpzy

All of the comics in this torrent are in either .cbz or .cbr format.  Pretty much all the pirated comics you find are going to be like this.

As for what program to use, I recommend CDisplay for reading comics.  It's an awesome program that's super-easy to use. You can download it from cnet here:

,crackfiend76,2010-03-14T08:27Z,"Thanks for the explanation.  I managed to fill in the missing ones by downloading all the ""ultimate"" compilations and filling in the holes.   Has anything new been added to the torrent since..12-24-09

if yes, hit me up on gmail  same username"
,janjjd,2010-06-17T15:56Z,"witch reading order is best to start wit and what is the sequence of the reading orders?

i'm sorry i think it's a dumb question but i don't get it :0"
[T],Juan.Too,2010-06-20T02:52Z,"@ janjjd

If you are wanting to read everything, then just use ""Ultimate Reading Order - Comprehensive"".  That one covers every comic in this torrent.

""Ultimate Reading Order (for TPBs)"" and ""Ultimate Reading Order (alternate)"" are just alternate reading orders that I included because no reading order for this many comics spanning this many series could be perfect.  If you don't like one of these, just switch to another.

I also included reading orders for some of the individual series as well.  You only need to use those if you only plan on reading a few series here and there rather than all of the Ultimate comics."
,janjjd,2010-06-20T11:54Z,ok thanks!
,neoinnirvana,2010-07-27T22:58Z,Its fucking slow...SEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
