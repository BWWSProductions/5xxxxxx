BORAT trickster Sacha Baron Cohen returns to the big screen to offer yet another stinging dose of socio-political satire in this comedy that finds him assuming the persona of gay fashionmonger Bruno, the self-proclaimed 'voice of Austrian youth TV'. Originally conceived as part of Baron Cohen's cult television series DA ALI G SHOW, the character of Bruno offered a cleverly costumed Baron Cohen the opportunity to highlight the absurdities of the fashion industry by interviewing unsuspecting fashion icons and other haute couture hangers-on.
