,thearches,2009-11-26T16:09Z,Thanks very much.  Most of us will need to convert this because it's has teeny-tiny print.  But still great to get it.
,WediOrwin,2009-11-27T07:50Z,"Yes, small print AND only 34 pages of story. Thanks for trying, BUTT"
,raj6,2009-11-29T16:52Z,"""WediOrwin"", I dont understant what do you mean by '34 pages of story'. The PDF has 168 page on it and I have personally read it."
,WediOrwin,2009-11-29T19:19Z,"Raj6 your copy (PDF file) may be good, but the 5 times I got a copy the size was  1,810 KB and only the first 34 pages had words on them.  The rest were blank. I don't know what else I can tell you.
  Wish I had a good copy. I'm rereading 1 - 5 now"
