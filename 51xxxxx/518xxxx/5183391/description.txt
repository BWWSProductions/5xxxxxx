        SpaceObServer is a powerful and flexible hard disk space manager
       for Windows. It scans local and network drives using a background
       service and stores their structure, sizes and properties in an SQL
          database. Linux and Unix filesystems can be scanned via SSH
        (Secure Shell). In an Explorer-like user interface the collected
        data can be viewed and browsed in hierarchical or tabular views,
        3D bar, pie, line charts and tree maps. Using the archived data
       you are able to track the development of the space usage from past
          to present, and forecast future size usage. A flexible file
         search, with predefined searches for very big, old or obsolete
           files allows filtering and listing files directly from the
              database. A duplicate file search is also included.
         The SpaceObServer Remote Administration Client is a management
        tool to configure scans, view scan results and generate exports
               remotely from additional machines in your network.
