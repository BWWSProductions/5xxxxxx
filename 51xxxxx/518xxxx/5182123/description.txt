In an extreme antiquity, for 1300 BC sorcerers-germetistami Ð´Ñ€ÐµÐ²Ð½ÐµÐµÐ³Ð¸Ð¿ÐµÑ‚ÑÐºÐ¾Ð¹ hierarchies of Amona have been developed schemes of deliberate hermetic sealing (concealment) and a distortion of representations of mankind about the Universe, about mission and a place of the person in him; about God true - the Creator and the Almighty, uniform for all living on the earth. The representative of hierarchy of Atona Amenhotep IV (Ehnaton, 1375-1325 BC) was last Pharaoh, to bearing people the truth ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ð½Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð¶Ð¸Ñ, . In the subsequent purposeful distortions have been introduced in mankind representations about schemes of social management with concealment of their top former priestly echelon which has gone underground; in philosophical knowledge. Ideology as representation about ideals, the history, psychology, economy and other sciences have taken place the formation not as system of objective knowledge, and as tools of zombiing and management of mankind of unstructured methods. For a disorientation of those who realises these schemes of management, sorcerers-germetistami throw theories of world plots, the world governments which are intended for Ð¾Ð´ÑƒÑ€Ð°Ñ‡Ð¸Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ crowds, for concealment of true egregorialno-matrix unstructured methods Ð½Ð°Ð´Ð³Ð¾ÑÑƒÐ´Ð°Ñ€ÑÑ‚Ð²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ managements."
