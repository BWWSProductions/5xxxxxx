Alex Merklinger's radio show 'Mysteries of the Mind' from 2004 featuring the late Bill Pawalec.


Among other things they discuss, and remember this is back in 2004 before the glogbal credit crunch, the troubled economy and the developing housing bubble. It is interesting to hear Bill's insights on the economy, which with the benefit of hindsight seem like accurate predictions. Alex also discusses his recent (in 2004)heart attack.


Bill Pawalec died of cancer about one year following his shows, as did Alex's daughter Saucy. The Mysteries of the Mind radio show stopped bradcasting in 2005. The mp3 archives are listed on the web site but the archive is no longer available.
