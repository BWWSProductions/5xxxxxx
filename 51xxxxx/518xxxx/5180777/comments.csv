thanks for the upload. nice, clean, updates nicely just like it should. aoloffline is my new hero. keep those phantom versions coming!"
,pouya99,2010-01-29T11:12Z,"Works brilliantly! No virus, no malware, simply a great upload. This program is 3x faster than Adobe Acrobat Pro and does the same job.

Full credit to aoloffline for the upload and the creators of this wonderful software.

Haven't tried any software updates yet though, as this serial has been out for a few months now. Any comments on this?"
,basha04,2010-03-02T18:33Z,"hi, i sure hope this really works as what the comments says here. thanks!"
,basha04,2010-03-03T02:41Z,"this really works but has anyone experiencing problem creating PDF from office files e.g. doc, docx, xls, xlsx?

here's the error message:

""This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Folder Options control panel.""

aoloffline do you have any ideas?"
