zmacdaddy8, I'd suggest you try watching Anh Hung Tran's previous movie (Vertical Ray of the Sun):
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0224578/
It's one of my all time favorite. I'd better warn you, it's a pretty slow movie too. If you can't cope with it either, I'd suggest you watch ""2012"" instead.

Like video quality, audio quality, download speed.. this is not a place for movie reviews made by an idiot neither it is the place to say to that idiot that he is an idiot ..oups did i just tell him? shame on me. SO: IS V/A QUALITY GOOD OR BAD???"
