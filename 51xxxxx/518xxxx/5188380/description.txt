Ours discography, 4 albums: Distorted Lullabies, Precious, Mercy and Sour. Sour is a very rare demo tape made by the band in 1994. There is also a single by Jimmy Gnecco, the frontman, off of the Spiderman 3 album; there is also a cover of Bohemian Rhapsody. Real music lives!!!

One of the greatest yet most underrated bands of our time. Ours has all of the components for brilliant music. The songwriting is poetic, instruments and music flow are phenomenal and the vocals (Jimmy Gnecco) are divine. It is a SIN to let this slip by. Ours can be compared to Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Soundgarden, Jeff Buckley etc. with its own flow added. Download this, listen to it, if you like it I encourage you to buy their albumsâ€¦this is a must!

Enjoy
