As you may know, today is Thankgiving Day in the United States. A short history lesson, the pilgrims were about to die from starvation, however the native Americans saved them. The Pilgrims repaid them by killing them all. We are no longer allowed to slaughter and eat native Americans, so a turkey gets killed instead. The only problem is how to properly eat a turkey. Luckily Erica Campbell has made a beautiful tutorial for us.
