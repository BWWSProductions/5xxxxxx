This version is very nice because of the acting, although the quality is a bit poor, it still is a great watch. I was surprised because very often these interpretations get very dull and predictible, but this one comes up with many surprises due to camera and acting capacity of the actors, I suppose. Thanks for putting it here and I'll seed it for a while."

This is one of several great English film renditions of English literature from 19th century novels. especially those by Charles Dickens. This one is very rare, but it appeared on TCM a few weeks ago and it blew me away with how fine it was. Think of Christmas Carol Alister Sims 1951, Great Expectations 1946 with John Mills,  Oliver Twist 1948, and David Copperfield 1935-- and so many more of the era. All of them exhibit a wonderful sense of story, character, and plot. Back then, the makers had a good feel for how people in Dickens time spoke and behaved. This is one of the best. 
Again, seed!"
