We are Holy Hell Rod, a heavy metal band out of Eastern Texas. We have come from the depths of country music hell to bring you head banging melodies, aggressive in your face lyrics, blaring double bass and riffs that will bludgeon your senses. We hope to branch out of the local venues, and take over the current music scene that tolerates mediocrity, and bring back talent to this emo infested mainstream garbage.
