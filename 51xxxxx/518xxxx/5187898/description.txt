IL-2 Sturmovik - Forgotten Battles


Il-2 is the best WW2 flight sim ever created for the PC, thats a fact.

You can fly at least 50 maybe even a 100 diferent aircraft ranging from WW1 Bi-planes to post war jets.


The multiplayer community is quite large with 2 main multiplayer modes, Co-Op missions and Dogfights


Fight with or against your friends on your own maps as the game includes a good mission creator.


The realism can be turned up to include various weather effects and advanced engine management or down to where you'll find it difficult to crash your aircraft.

This torrent includes the latest multiplayer patch.

I myself have created a few missions that can be played both single player and multiplayer. Some of them are realy good and others were failed attempts. I would advise trying the Pearl Harbour mission, and the stalingrad mission.

I also created a good dogfight map which i designed to simulate an actual war front with ground battles taking place along the front line and German V2 facilities to attack.
