,Zenit33,2010-01-05T00:57Z,"IL-2 survives online with HyperLobby (under the Forgotten Battles server, IL2 & Pacific Fighters servers are normally empty). And most play IL-2 1946 v4.09 (latest patch), a few play v4.08 and plenty also play the HSFX mod (for 1946).

 FB can be combined with 46 but for the average person it is a waste of time, go get the 1946 DVD or buy from steam for $5, it includes all previous IL-2 and only requires the application of 1 or 2 patches to be playing online.
