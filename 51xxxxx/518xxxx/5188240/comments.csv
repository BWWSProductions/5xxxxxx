,kenpoo,2009-12-02T09:14Z,"Thanks for seeding torrents of this episode and the following episode s01e13.   I was able to easily find and download the first 9 episode torrents in the spring 2009, but I could not locate torrents of subsequent episodes since June 2009.  I wondered what happened to the series, but an internet search indicated the series was not canceled, and in fact was renewed for a 2nd season.  I surmise no one in England was interested and/or able to torrent subsequent episodes.  I didn't realize though that the last 4 episodes were broadcast late in the cycle in Canada.  Anyway...thanks again, as this completes the series for me in the USA."

Thanks for your comments about the broadcast order.  I'm quite surprised, bordering on amazed, that episodes 10-13 have not been shown in the UK, but already shown in Canada and Australia.  I proverbially scratching my head at why the episodes have not yet been shown in the UK; after all it is an English show set in London that's called ""...UK"".  Ah well, I'm happy that err0001 has been kind enough to seed and torrent the episodes."
