,Nannocrob,2009-12-01T00:08Z,"pirate bay and isohunt seemed to be the only good options right now.  demonoid seems to be hinting that it will return in full at the beginning of 2010, hopefully.  right not only the tracker seems to be functioning, sort of.  I'm sure if they return they'll be accepting new registrations for the first few weeks; so if you don't already have an account, get one.  best of luck and thanx."

[T],Quazza,2009-12-01T02:04Z,"I'm here. I'll be posting on TPB.

Jwhitt, if you find another site be sure to let me know, yes?"
[T],Quazza,2009-12-01T02:07Z,"I have invites for demonoid...or at least i should have a few when it comes back up.

I would rather keep them to a public tracker if possible since sites like demonoid are really difficult to get into."
,ZERO_BS,2009-12-01T03:50Z,"Good to see you guys...

If TPB ultimately becomes too unreliable again (seems to be doing great the past week) you can always start a blog or simple webpage and post private trackers yourself. It's not hard... I have a page built into my gaming website for file distro via torrent and FTP. Just take out the middle man and index your own torrent links if it comes down to it.

Whatever happens, we appreciate what you do. Thanks!"

While it appears you can't upload a torrent like you can on TPB or Mininova, you can use magnet links, which TPB is now advocating as the best way to distribute files through bittorrent.

Here is TPB's blog post on the subject:

""Worlds most resiliant tracking

You might have noticed all the new magnet icons  everywhere?

These are ""magnet links"", a link that lets you download a torrent directly in your BitTorrent client, instead of your browser. Most clients supports this (uTorrent, Vuze, rtorrent, whatever) and will get the relevant torrent data over the DHT network.

And DHT? It's a de-centralized peer to peer network that all modern clients join by default, even if they are currently not downloading any torrents. DHT can help you find peers and metadata when you choose to start a torrent download.

(If you want to learn more about DHT this Torrentfreak article might be a good place to start)

http://torrentfreak.com/common-bittorrent-dht-myths-091024/

You might also have noticed that the tracker has been down lately? And that the upload page don't recommend trackers anymore! The development of DHT has reached a stage where a tracker is no longer needed to use a torrent. DHT (combined with PEX) is highly effective in finding peers without the need for a centralized service. If you run uTorrent you might have noticed in the tracker tab of your torrents that the [Peer Exchange] (PEX) row is often reporting a lot more peers than the trackers you might have for that torrent. These peers all came to you without the use of a central tracker service! This is what we consider to be the future. Faster and more stability for the users because there is no central point to rely upon.

Now that the decentralized system for finding peers is so well developed, TPB has decided that there is no need to run a tracker anymore, so it will remain down! It's the end of an era, but the era is no longer up2date. We have put a server in a museum already, and now the tracking can be put there as well.

By moving to a more decentralized system of handling tracking (DHT+PEX) and distributions of torrent files (Magnet Links), BitTorrent will become less vulnerable to downtime and outages: 

With decentralized peer acquisition, there is no central tracker that can be down.

With decentralized fetching of metadata (torrents) we don't need to rely on a single server that stores and distributes torrent files.""

Hope the info is useful.  I may not be a dittohead or even a conservative, but Rush makes me laugh and no one sticks it to the donks and dems better than he does."
,UncleBeer,2009-12-01T07:05Z,thx jwhitt!

[T],jwhitt62,2009-12-01T22:10Z,"Sorry guys. I'm receiving the following error when I try and upload my torrent today, 01-Dec. ""The torrent you are trying to upload has the private-bit set, this means it will not work with DHT, please recreate it without the private torrent option"" I've tried everything but can't get it to work. I'll try again later today."
