,iphase,2009-11-29T08:05Z,The activation-crack don't work. I've got just the normal 30-day trial process. Any ideas? Thanks for your help.
,Wedas,2009-11-29T13:32Z,someone pls get hypershot for scutch.
,scutch,2009-11-29T15:40Z,uninstall 2010. put 2009 in trash. install 2010 again. after 2010 is running you can take 2009 out of the trash.

Thanks for the post quality"
,OxxK,2009-12-02T11:18Z,"I don't really get it, when I run the soft, my mac (MBP 2,26GHz 2G RAM) makes a strange zipping sound as if it was trying to read a CD and Maya stops working for like? 5 s with the rainbow wheel turning on it? What could cause this ?

Appart from that, it works neatly really. But having a 5s lag every 30s makes it pretty unusable."
,OxxK,2009-12-02T11:18Z,"Oh and I meant to add ""Thank you for any assistance provided"" of course and thanks also for uploading the torrent."
,OxxK,2009-12-02T11:26Z,"BE AWARE /!\

From the Autodesk site :
Maya 2010 will not work on Mac 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

Published date: 2009-Sep-02 
ID: TS13830094

Applies to:
Autodesk速 Maya速 2010
Issue
If you install Maya 2010 on Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Maya will not start up

Solution
At this time, Autodesk has not qualified Maya to work on Snow Leopard (10.6). It is strongly recommended that you do not upgrade to this version of the operating system."

,xniggler,2009-12-06T14:43Z,"i can't get maya to work on leopard it just won't chancel the register/activation screen

any ideas people?"
,xniggler,2009-12-07T07:19Z,OK easy ...it misteriously worked the next day....

,xniggler,2009-12-09T16:41Z,"ok , for all of you who get the zipping problem:

http://www.mac-torrents.com/torrents.php?mode=details&id=ca74d09ce7dfc5c7fad2d55168a1add1268bc1fd

download version two of the crack here"
,xniggler,2009-12-13T00:26Z,"little tip: for those of you who can't get rid of the activation screen, make shure you're above osx 10.5.7 (leopard latest update basically)"
,_shiva_,2009-12-13T19:58Z,"@ xniggler

Thanks for that. Maya now works like a charm.

Matchmover crashes constantly though. I guess this might be a similar problem - in need of a new crack?

Any leads?"
,OOZOON,2009-12-14T22:40Z,"Let me guess: this is a X-Force crack. Statistical probability that it contains a virus is therefore nearly 99.99%. As long as I have been downloading these X-Force cracks AVG virus       scanner keeps alarming that file contains a virus. 

Now I have few questions which I would like to get a specialists answer...

1. Are X-Force cracks always containing a virus? If that is so, why people keep downloading them? 

2. Is AVG virus scanner wrong when it finds a virus from X-Force cracks? I want to point that in my case this always happens.

3. Are people aware of these viruses but despite of this fact they still keep using them cos they need the software badly once they have no money.  

I think a virus makes crack unusable. In most cases cracks are now days useless because of many viruses. In the old days things were differently crack could be clean. Now it is impossible to be certain. There are so many viruses that one scanner cannot find them all. 

So what to do? Should I buy OEM release? Do these OEM releases contain as many viruses or trojans than X-Force cracks?

Please tell me your opinions..."
,ingy489,2009-12-16T19:47Z,So I downloaded the software and Unrar'd it so its a dmg file. Now whenever I go to install it it says that the default install location cannot be found. Does anyone have any work arounds or have had similar problems?
,ralibs,2009-12-27T21:10Z,"is this really multilanguage?
or just english and japanese"
,xniggler,2010-01-16T05:51Z,"well about this virus thing...bullshit....all good...
and as far as matchmovers crashes go:
just don't do the auto track with a high tolerance stting or do the track points by hand"
,Ripperman,2010-01-27T19:36Z,"I am a newbie, and I have know idea how to crack. It is foreign to me, sorry guys. Every time I open the Maya app, it says Activate, or Run the product. I have been running the product but don't have many days left. I thought once I entered serial and key code I was good. Anyone have steps to crack? Not sure what that is.
Thanks"
,nabstarr,2010-02-03T01:26Z,This has viruses. I just got done installing and now i have no sound. And my cd tray is going insane. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
,xniggler,2010-02-03T01:57Z,yioru cd tray is going insane because you've only installed one of the two cracks  necessary you fool
,spetznatz,2010-03-02T16:41Z,"Thanks for this.

Hmm. D/led crack 2 and ran it. May is installed in default 'Applications' directory... when launched, though I still get the 'Activation' splashscreen...

No other versions of Maya installed.

Any ideas?"
,n5ane,2010-04-14T17:12Z,"It seems to work well for me on Snow Leopard.  No ""viruses"", crack works (the 2nd time).  Everything fine.

When installing it says that it couldn't install ""Exit"".  I don't even know what ""Exit"" is. I hope this doesn't bother me when working on Maya."
