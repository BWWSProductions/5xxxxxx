,JonxAllen23,2009-12-03T02:37Z,"fuck this torrent. google linux.  and get the shit off their site. this guy dont know wtf he is doing.  linux can only work properly depending on your system and system requirements. for example. i have 6 gb of memory. and asus motherboard. i have 2  1TB hardrives and my computer wont support this download, wtf.  this dude is stupid. im also running NuMega SoftIce and this program doesnt work to its fullest compatibility.  "
,Fuck__You,2009-12-03T05:10Z,"wow, THIS IS THE OFFICIAL TORRENT FROM THEIR SITE! your a fucking dumb ass. learn to use a computer, and how to check checksums before you come bitching about how i dont know what im doing. it dose not sound like you are even smart enough to be using linux. let alone torrents. LOL i still cant believe your blaming me for you not knowing about whats going on.  FUCK YOU. eat a DICK B=====D"
,Fuck__You,2009-12-03T05:12Z,"one last note about this quote:
 ""linux can only work properly depending on your system and system requirements""
You really are a dumb ass. LOL."
,Fuck__You,2009-12-06T20:36Z,"@goddess_of_war
I do agree with you completely, and i did choose the wrong things to say. i was just mad. sorry jonxallen23. but i think its a well know fact in the most Linux communities that new hardware, for the most part, is not supported for a wile.  and i still do not appreciet being called stupid for my upload, (that i did not make) because a user couldn't get it to work, and saying i know nothing. Hey i posted a torrent. one that i like. but are they going to blame me for hardware failure now too?"
,FrostyC,2009-12-09T17:11Z,My motherboard went out when I installed this! It's been working fine for the past 20 years & all of a sudden just died. This is clearly the fault of whoever uploaded this crap torrent.
,FrostyC,2009-12-09T17:14Z,"This torrent is a fake, I can tell from the pixels & from seeing quite a few photoshopped torrents in my time."
,Fuck__You,2009-12-10T06:14Z,what the fuck are you talking about? fake? pixels and seeding? what the fuck are you talking about? this is the offical torrent from their site! download them both and look. verify the MD5Sum its not fake. and it didnt break your mother board.  software wont break your mother board.
,pholic,2009-12-11T21:09Z,"The world is full of Idiots, get used to them being here since mininova is gone."
,antibus5,2009-12-12T12:57Z,"@Fuck__You :: would say its more than a modified UBU. use it now since Bianca & it becomes a own distri, for sure with UBU roots and repos.
Now UBU has a new Âťsoftware center thingiÂŤ this is a part of the last 6 Mint's. thanks 4 the torrent and it runs super fast, I wish all my downloads would fast as this. ;) greets ?
---> and I pray 4 less stupid assholes on this planet! "
,nightflamef,2009-12-12T14:33Z,all i can say thanks bro ^_^
,Fuck__You,2009-12-13T02:55Z,"thank you o the last 3 people.

,Jokkkk,2009-12-14T23:24Z,"@Fuck__You 's reply to FrostyC, learn some sarcasm

btw, shouldn't this be in applications > UNIX?"
,Fuck__You,2009-12-15T18:09Z,"ya maybe, iv seen some Linux distros in UNIX, and other in ""other os"""
,SevenTwentySeven,2009-12-29T03:58Z,"this is actually a great torrent and it works like a fuckin charm
thanks for uploading
and to all the assholes saying this is a fake and shit you obviously havent downloaded and tried it and if you keep saying "" this doesnt work on my system"" and crap like that, its not his fault or anybodys fault you have shit hardware... this is better if not exactly the same the the official torrent from linux mint
so stop complaining people
once again
thanks for the up!

:]

oh and one more thing!!!!
can somebody send me an inivte to demonoid? :]
i lost my account during the server crash and all i got was a email saying sorry
so if anybody would be amazing enough to send me a email i would appreciate it!
(ill put my email once i get a reply, no email for you spammer :] )"
,SevenTwentySeven,2009-12-29T04:03Z,"@ everyone whos commenting dumb stuff
this is on Applications > UNIX

My Specs:
Asus MoBo, 
intel i7 6 core at 2.67ghz
12gb RAM
dual sli nvidia 120m 2gb ddr3 cards
3.120 Tb Storage (dual 1.5Tb, 1 120gb hdd specially for linux)
3 monitors and 1 LED tv plugged in

everything runs smoothly
and it also runs great in VMware and VMware fusion if ur runnning a Mac.

you can mount using alcohol 120%, poweriso or anything
and burn with those programs too.
it works on 128mb of memory but it runs like crap (just had to test)
runs great on laptops with 320mb of memory and up
and it is better than ubuntu 9.10"
,FrostyC,2009-12-31T02:54Z,"lol sorry. I was trolling you. And apparently rather well...

Now I lol everytime I see:

Fuck__You: ...but are they going to blame me for hardware failure now too?

FrostyC: My motherboard went out when I installed this! It's been working fine for the past 20 years ...."
,FrostyC,2009-12-31T03:03Z,btw I've been an avid Mint user for awhile now... And I still say Mint 6 Felicia was Mint's peak of development. After that is starts getting more & more unnecessary bloat.
,MadeOfFake,2010-01-13T20:41Z,"I must say. this is the fastest torrent i have ever downloaded 2mb/s down speed, 6kb/s up. All glory to Fuck__You.
also, don't stop uploading torrents cause of people who think all torrents are a virus out to get them.
FrostyC: Good Troll, mate. Caught that one on and lol'd hard."
,Fuck__You,2010-01-23T06:55Z,"ahh, i didnt stop upping cuz of these bitch haters, i stopped cuz of the mad leeching. and a upload on demonoid under the username ""Hatredg0d"" thats been my tag from when i was 13. and all my torrents are private...  BTW, the seeding there is amazing... leeching is minimal. and people actually comment on torrents there. sorry guys."
,jesusismyairbag,2010-02-11T20:02Z,why do you have 3 monitors?! are u BLINDDDDDD

,NostalgicStone,2010-05-03T14:24Z,"This is the same as from the site. Everyone claiming it's not, is a moron.
