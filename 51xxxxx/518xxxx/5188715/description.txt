The up to date run of Invincible Iron Man. How is tony going to cheat death this time? Replaced by a younger version from an alternate timeline? Resurrected by a super powered child of near unlimited power? Or maybe as he lays dying someone will have some dangerous and untested technology to not only revive him, but drastically improve him?
