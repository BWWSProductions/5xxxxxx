,angilix,2009-11-30T03:36Z,"Thanks, but poor quality."
,p-sub,2009-11-30T04:24Z,"Jesus Christ, this is bad quality. I mean all creds to the first uploaders of a ninja assassin cam but playing with VLC the sound goes out after 3 minutes and I couldnt even make out what they said until that point...

Only people laying on their deathbeds should be desperate enough to get this one and not wait for a better release. Then again, I`ve been wrong before.

Again, credits to the people who worked hard to get this up here but..."
,simps_br,2009-11-30T04:42Z,"You know when people say:

""well, this is better then nothing""

Its just not true in this case. Nothing is better then this bad bad bad quality junk.

A:1/10
V:1/10

,mazE187,2009-11-30T07:05Z,"stop hating the video is watchable I've seen VERY WORST cam, so don't complain since its the only real one out. Ill upload it in better quality tonight, I got some programs to enhance the video quality. the video will look just like an average cam, not a good one. i can't transform poop into flowers.

... and the video doesn't deserve an A:1 V:1. If u know what ur talking about u should know that first release are usually worst than this, sometime u just can't find better so stop complain and give credits."
,kotj101,2009-11-30T07:40Z,"very low quality, thanx tho!"
,simps_br,2009-12-01T03:39Z,"mazE187,

This is 2009, almost 2010. You don't record and upload some ridiculous bad quality footage like that anymore. Are people recording this with mobile phone cameras? You call this watchable? Get a clue, this is just a waste of bandwidth, and this is what a V:1 and A:1 looks like.

People need to learn how to do CAM. You can't do it unless you have some $2000.00 equip minimum, on an empty theater, with the CAM on the right distance, right angle, no zoom and yes, the right lightning. That is just the first part. You need to know a lot about how to cap the audio and how the encode both video and audio the right way, using the filters when needed to enhance the quality, deal with grain and make it as sharp as possible.

The copy failed in every aspect. Mistakes all arround. You people don't know how to do it, they shouldn't do it, let someone else do it.

This copy is a waste of time, the quality is so bad, no one can possibly enjoy the movie."
