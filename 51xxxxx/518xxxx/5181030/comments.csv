guess we are stuck over here now huh?
happy thanksgiving to you and yours."
,Diceman_,2009-11-27T08:21Z,Yeah what happened? Did they create a filter for your torrents?
,abcd-she,2009-11-27T16:41Z,"@Diceman_
No, Mininova is now limited to 'Content Distribution service'"
,abcd-she,2009-11-27T16:47Z,"Why?
For more information: http://torrentfreak.com/mininova-deletes-all-infringing-torrents-and-goes-legal-091126/

@sig_garrett
Please restore all your submissions to Mininova.

Have a good day."
,[TR],2009-11-28T00:24Z,"I don't think it was sig who removed the torrents from Mininova.
They probably just deleted everything they hadn't vetted themselves.
If they will take sig's torrents it would be cool. Nothing illegal about them, right?"
,Diceman_,2009-11-28T03:04Z,Thanks for the info abcd-she.
,abcd-she,2009-11-28T09:52Z,"@[TR]
Indeed.

@Diceman_
You are welcome.

Love and (hopefully) Peace

[T],sig_garrett,2009-11-29T20:14Z,"Greetings Infowarriors!!!   Yes, Mininova did remove my torrents. They cleaned house - it appears it was a general purge that wasn't directed at me personally or the materials I torrent.

I have submitted two applications to become a ""Content Distributor"" with no replies as of yet.

I argue that the materials I provide are already available via the internet or podcast free of charge. It can also be argued that I actually promote and advertise the businesses generating the source material which I repackaged and disseminate.

With a little luck and/or Mininova's kind benevolence I will be able to cross post there before too long.

As for restoring previous torrents to Mininova in the future - that depends on Mininova's approval of my application(s) and my time availability. Basically everything exists right here right now (as well as other torrent site replication) so motivated listeners can take up the cause if they are inclined to do so.

Thank you for your support, listenership and activism.
