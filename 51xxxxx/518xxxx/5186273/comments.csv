,misguidedmonkey,2009-12-04T02:43Z,You crazy dickbag. You're gonna rate your own torrent with A/V=10/10 ?? Let someone else do that.
,tiewire,2009-12-31T16:18Z,Fuck you misguidedmonkeydicksucker! He posted it he can do what-the-fuck-ever he wants with it. Including take it down so ungrateful faggots like you can't bitch about him being so gracious as to post it. Was your mom so busy sucking nigger-dick that she didn't treat you how to act when somebody is doing you a favor?
,tiewire,2009-12-31T16:19Z,Oh... and thanks Nehalkhalid. Keep up the GOOD work.
,goon-o,2010-01-14T22:40Z,@misguidedmonkey- 'you crazy dickbag' LOL-that comment made me laugh for 10 minutes straight-might have to claim that phrase as my own-good work fella !
,jahberry,2010-03-16T16:57Z,"LoL! sometimes, reading the comments to torrents is more entertaining than watching the dwnldd content.."
,73sad73,2010-03-23T15:20Z,"A/V=10/10 ???? Is that supposed to be a joke!

More like 8/5 A/V

Audio isn't too bad but has some distortion randomly

Video is far from 10, too dark and grainy qualifies it as a 5 max.

,dubblue,2010-09-25T09:18Z,"worst film ive seen in a long time. idiotic teenage shite. but thanks for the upload anyway, nehalkhalid."
,kaya.md,2011-05-14T16:17Z,"why is you people hating the quality of this movie?

that is not logical

DVDRIP quality is by definition bad quality, if you want good quality, buy the movie on bluray. "
,xjessiieex,2011-12-23T13:45Z,thanks to the children for blocking the feed so I have to scroll down for a/v.
