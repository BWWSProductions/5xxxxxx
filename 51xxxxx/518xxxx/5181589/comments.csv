,Jazzdancer,2011-05-21T02:50Z,"I watched it and have to comment as this was incredibly heartwrenching.  The main program was a little bit slow in parts but I'm glad I watched the whole program.  The Revelations (part II) was much better as far as pace.  The story itself is shocking and down right scary. It makes me thankful I don't live in that part of the counrty. I much prefer the ""lunatics"" in Los Angeles.
