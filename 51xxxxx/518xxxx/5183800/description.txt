Okay last manga for today. :)

Well not realy much to say about this one anyone who is in to anime and manga probably allready know of love hina, but there is nothing wrong with puting up poppular stuff. Kind of suprised there is no good copy of this up allready (The two other seeded torrents i found where packed weirdly and judging from the file size of far lower quality). :)

As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. Nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. Credits pages and possibly some fan art could be included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.

In a desperate effort to go into seclusion and study for his entrance exams, he decides to ask to stay in his grandmother's hotel. His plans are ruined when he discovers that the "hotel" is actually an all-girls dormitory ... and some serious distractions ensue.
