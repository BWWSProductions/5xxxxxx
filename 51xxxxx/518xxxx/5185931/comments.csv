Besides, I always find myself curious about how many people think 'I wonder if this torrent is real...ah ok, it is! Sweet!'. Anyway, let me know what you think! :-)"

I can't stand watching this stuff from the funimation website.
funimation lags like hell so it takes 2 hours to get through a 20 minute show.
whereas, I can let my computer download a torrent and afterwards be able to watch it anywhere anytime even withought an internet conection on whatever device I should choose.
THANKS!"

,butt_cheese,2010-01-30T06:14Z,the audio for episode 2 and the last 3 or 4 episodes is horrible. its extremely loud and buzzy and i can barely hear the voices over the buzzing
