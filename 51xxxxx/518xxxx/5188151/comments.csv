[T],victory144,2009-11-30T16:18Z,Rev15 recommended for Usb Loader and rev14 more than for actual Backup Loader.
,Fuck__You,2009-12-03T19:35Z,"yes, disk backup loaders are old any ways. the only real purpose i see in them is for GC games. but the ""WODE"" is going to take care of that. =) but my favorite part about this update. dual layer fixed. =)

Thanks (even though i had this when it came out)"
