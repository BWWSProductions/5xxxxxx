The Idiot (Russian: Ð˜Ð”Ð†ÐžÐ¢Ðª) is a costume drama TV series produced by Russia TV Channel in 2003 based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel with the same title.

Series script is very close to original text of Dostoevsky, well-known Russian actors and playing in the film, and, according to additional materials on DVD, serious effort made to make historical scenes, clothes in film.

The series was branded by the novel's original pre-1920's orthography title "Ð¸Ð´Ñ–Ð¾Ñ‚ÑŠ" (in all caps) instead of the current "Ð¸Ð´Ð¸Ð¾Ñ‚" as one will find it on the bookshelves in Russia (to promote the atmosphere of the tsarist time when the film's plot takes place). This branded title "Ð˜Ð”Ð†ÐžÐ¢Ðª" can be seen at the beginning of each part and on the cover of the DVD release.

The series consists of 10 sequels each approximately 50 minutes.

It is just not fair to make films like that. The director discovered hidden visual dynamite in the bottomless text of the dark genius of Dostoevsky. The best actors of the world's oldest acting school perform like there is no tomorrow. Together, they crash on your senses with an impact of a natural disasters rather then a human-made entertainment.

Every episode goes at amazing pace, rich in events, and crafted brilliantly. It never fails to captivate. Every scene has action, intensity, emotion and impact. TV drama format suits it perfectly - viewers need these breaks.

Although the language is a problem for general English-speaking public, the film is strongly recommended to industry professionals and academics. It has material for 10 years of research and following.

A fantastic achievement! Brilliant acting, especially Mironov and Inna Churikov. Olga Budina (Aglaya), Vladimir Ilyin (Lebedev), Aleksei Petrenko (General Ivolgin), and Vladimir Mashkov (Rogozhin) also give very strong performances. The masterful treatment of even the most minor characters (e.g. Yepanchin's butler) provides an incredibly rich texture for this amazing story. The main difficulty for the non-Russian speaker is the incredibly uneven quality of the English subtitles. As others have stated, the subtitles go from very good to suddenly unintelligible. In parts they annoying lag behind the dialog. The music is weak also, much of it computer-synthesized, and very repetitive. But those quibbles aside, this is a real masterpiece.
