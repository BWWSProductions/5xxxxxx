Gavin and Stacey have moved to Wales. Stacey couldn't be happier now she's back with her mum Gwen, her uncle Bryn and a daily diet of omelettes. Gavin on the other hand is adjusting to life in Barry, and although he won't admit it, he's missing his parents Pam and Mick and of course, his best friend Smithy.

Smithy is bereft in Essex without Gav, and is trying to get used to the fact that his son, Neil the baby, is now living in a caravan with mum Nessa and soon-to-be stepfather Dave Coaches.
