,baba73,2009-11-26T18:27Z,Real but as target already said if you enjoy watching the ceiling of the theater go ahead and DL
,chisinaumoldova,2009-11-26T23:45Z,Terrible.REALLY terrible.
,brendaleyland,2009-11-27T00:02Z,give us proper uploads - not crap file extensions to crap players. Only a fool would risk downloading a potential Virus / Tojan. Why should we trust rhis nonsense. just give it straight.
,doofus2,2009-11-27T00:21Z,This is without a doubt the worst cam rip I have ever seen. I didn't go past the first 2 minutes. Why would anybody put such a crappy copy up.
,wrecklessattitude,2009-11-27T01:57Z,All you fu
,DrChandra,2009-11-27T04:40Z,why is there no version of this out yet? what are we paying these people for?? oh wait..
,Squidgi_deE,2009-11-28T00:54Z,Did you guys even read the description? Uploader clearly stated he didn't cam it so give him a break... I dunno... Maybe uploader uploaded for the umm... blind people... that like crackly noises... lmao...
,Squidgi_deE,2009-11-28T00:56Z,U/L also said that camming suck a*s so it's your own faults... Just saying...
,billybog,2009-11-28T08:55Z,"quality of picture isnt actually that bad, if you can get over the 50% of screen part.  This upload provided one very important service for me, it allowed me to watch the end of the movie, that was missing from the somewhat better copy also available on PB.  Thanks for uploading."
,vladnaut,2009-11-30T07:10Z,"Yes, i know this is a free service so let me stop you right there. this is as shitty maybe shittier than the other cam version of this movie. Free feces is still feces folks. Another floater file sailing the high seas in the bottom of my digital john. :-[  fllllllluuuush..."
,lordtarl,2009-12-04T09:26Z,"Someone tell this retard to stop sucking off the usher and pay attention to his camera placement. I think the bobbing of his head knocked it off kilter.

The only thing this is good for is seeing the ending. The other version posted here on TPB is missing the end (are people just THAT fucking retarded anymore? Shot of the roof, no endings.. WTF)

So go get the other one here on TPB.. watch that till retard 1 cuts the movie off, then load this and skip to the end and watch the last 1/10th of the movie screen to see the last 1/10th of the movie that retard 2 so valiantly gave his innocence up for.

And people.. please.. if you are going UL have a little pride and don't put up garbage. Yeah its free but so is the clap.. and I'm tired of getting both."
,D-Fox,2009-12-09T19:32Z,Terribly sorry for the waste of time and bandwith while dloading it. You should consider not repeating my error...
