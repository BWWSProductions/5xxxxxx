okay time for a new release :)

this time its psychic academy, a manga that i myself am curently in the midle of reading and which i find enjoyable so far. the quality of the scanlation is so so, there are parts where the english grammar is bad (realy realy bad in places...) and the translation seems a litle... odd att times but overall its readable and as mentioned (imho) realy enjoyable.  :)

As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. Nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. Credits pages and possibly some fan art could be included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.

Summary (from baka updates manga which in turn atribute it to Tokyopop)

Zerodaimu Kyupura Pa Azalraku Vairu Rua Darogu (a.k.a. Zero) once stopped the evil demon lord with his incredible psychic ability, and in the process saved the world from destruction and earned the honorable and highly imaginative title 'The Man Who Stopped the Evil Lord.' 
Now, he has accepted a position as a teacher at Psychic Academy, a school for gifted psychokinetic youngsters who have demonstrated incredible raw powers and want to learn how to hone their abilities. Among the student body is young Ai Shiomi, Zero's little brother, a somewhat meek boy who, despite parental prodding and his fraternal reputation, feels that his limited skills hardly justify his presence at the prestigious academy. 
However, everyone else is convinced that he, like his celebrated brother, is destined for greatness. A lot of pressure for a boy just entering adolescence!
