Storyline: Lem is just an average teenager working on getting the girl and furthering his 
career at the local planetarium - except that he's an alien. At least to U.S. astronaut Captain Charles T. Baker who lands 
on Lem's planet hoping for a quick flag plant and a hasty return to earth and his millions of screaming fans. But on this 
alien planet the media has tagged spacemen as brain-eating, zombie-creating monsters, causing Baker to run for his life 
and into Lem's house. Now it's up to the green native to get the clumsy astronaut back to his spaceship before military 
dictator General Grawl and mad scientist Professor Kipple manage to exterminate the Earthly visitor.

NOTE : I have tested this on the PS3 and Xbox and works fine.
I have noticed lots of nobs are posting fakes using my name only grab films from genuine SecretMyth, MajorTJKong and LifeChanger accounts or straight from the source
