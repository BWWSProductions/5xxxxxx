39 Miss understanding
40 Over Phil

Video: 640x480, XviD, 999kbps
Audio: stereo, mp3, 128kbps

Bad news:
---------
Episode 'Over Phil' missing title intro and
(I think) roughly 5.5 seconds at about 4:47.

It's not my fault, sorry, doing my best,
but I can't provide better one.

Appeal:
-------
I can't believe nobody don't want to make
some proper TV rips of these funny 'Penguins'
regulary. Come on guys, if you can receive
american Nickelodeon, please record this
show and share with us. All equipment you
need to do this, is just PC TV card or
DVD recorder. 

Just to quote king Julian 'I am stupidfied'
('Little zoo coupe' episode) of doing these
bad rips.
And to quote Maurice 'Please make me stop'
(also 'Little zoo coupe' episode) and take
over this job.
