The conversion was done using the SPEC method (ArcTan set to "across" with Slice rears) found on www.surroundbyus.com.

The files are only playable on home theater equipment or PC's capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static. You have several options, including the following:

a) Foobar2000: Install the foo_input_dts plugin and load the cue file directly into your playlist.

b) Mount the cue file on a virtual drive (with Daemon Tools, for example) and play with a DTS-capable player (Cyberlink PowerDVD, for example).

c) Burn the cue file to a CD as an image (with ImgBurn or Ahead Nero, for example) and play on a DTS-capable Home Theater system.
