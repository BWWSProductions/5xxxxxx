,chrome44,2009-11-29T04:46Z,What the fuck is this? Seriously how the fuck am I suppose to watch this?
,Destructo_Dom,2009-11-29T10:01Z,"pretty good rip , but the movie it self isnt the greatest...just like all the other Final Destination movies...the story doesnt change , just the characters....worth watching , but not worth wasting a DVD on , its one of them movies that you'll only wanna watch about once...so i suggest watching VIA computer or stream to your xbox 360 like i do. Thanks for the good work TvTeam!"

,calebpopham,2009-11-29T20:14Z,"This may sound stupid, but how do you get a file like this to play? I just get a bunch of WinRAR Archives"
,cire666siuol,2009-11-29T22:20Z,"Well...I'm not even gonna waste my time with this movie, but for all you ppl out there that don't know what to do...Download WinRAR, 7Zip, or WinACE (Winrar is the best IMO)...Extract the first RAR file(Should have .r01 as the file extension) and it automatically extracts the rest...There you go...There should now be an AVI file there that you can play (with the right codecs [DL K-Lite Codec Pack]) or burn to a DVD...Enjoy and thanks uploader..."
