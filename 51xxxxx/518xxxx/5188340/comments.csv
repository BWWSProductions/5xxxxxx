,henry76,2009-11-30T11:21Z,Awsome. Thanks :)
,RedbeardJim,2009-11-30T11:37Z,"to be honest, if you have a client with dht and peer exchange you are better off without the tracker.  You'll get approx the same no of peers and seeds, and you'll be just that little bit safer.

Thanks to eztv as always!"

,Radek.Sch,2009-12-03T02:28Z,"Please EZTV include .NFO files in your torrents.
Do not delete it.
Im the old-school downloader and I need the .NOF file.
And I think I am not alone.
Thanks."
