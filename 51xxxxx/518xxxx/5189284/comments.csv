Anybody else tested it?"
,sinzan,2009-12-02T02:40Z,It's real and it works. Seems to be the same as the ESPALPSP upload only its about 100mb larger and compressed cso 
,Miket728,2009-12-06T02:01Z,Works for me. I have a psp phat 1000 with 5.00 m33-6 Custom Firmware.
,Scruffy1337,2009-12-06T23:43Z,its not working for me!! when i try to play it i get a black screen. i have a psp-1001 with 5.00 m33-6 CFW. what do i do. do i set the CPU clocks? the UMD ISO mode?
,frozen2k,2009-12-07T18:57Z,on VSH menu set the clock on default... of course set the UMD ISO MODE to use  M33 driver... Nothing special config have been made on this file just as it is. And I recntly tested it on PSP 3000 GEN A and it also works... WELP!!! keep seeding...
,azWrATh,2010-01-08T11:08Z,is this the full game????
,BJornxD,2010-01-13T22:47Z,"There are some problems...
When I do story mode, i have only 4 stages.
And when i try to custumize i can't see the hair..
is that because i have 5.00 M33
someone has the same problem with 5.00 M33-6?"
