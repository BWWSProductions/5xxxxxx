Tekken 6 for PSP Slim/Phat cfw 5.0 m33-6 was patched and tested by yours truly courtesy of pspiso...

Update!!!

I also tested it on PSP 3000 GEN A/B and works perfectly...

Update!!!

I upgraded my psp from m33-6 to GEN-D3 and still works for me...

Try setting the clocks on both default... And this is a FULL GAME!!!
