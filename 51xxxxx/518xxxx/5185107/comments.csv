:)

Hopping to hear your comments !"
,deviationer,2009-11-28T22:54Z,based on the screens and description it looks like the SecretMyth release. So is this better Jnu than SecretMyth?
,Attaxer,2009-11-29T04:36Z,"Audio I would give an 8 while the video I would give a 9. It's  kind of bad for a R.I.P and for some reason in the first scene all the audio is pitched up a bit so it's higher than it's supposed to be. Not a bad download, just virtually no seeds so get ready for a long one."
,_Jnu_,2009-11-29T04:56Z,"@deviationer

I haven't seen the secretmyth release.
I got the video source from a russian torrent."
,sohaiz,2009-11-29T05:09Z,"not bad but i dont think this is a dvd rip version..
most probably a cam shot.."

Thats why it says TS in the heading !
Use your brain please !"
,nbelcher7,2009-11-29T12:24Z,the link that oowekwj posted doesnt work. i think its some type of scam.

,xls99,2009-11-30T06:54Z,"A very good cam copy. 100 times better than the last version I saw which was so badly cropped I could not watch it.
So well done fella."
,luukx20,2009-11-30T07:23Z,"This is actually a really good copy, thanks alot!"
,Traysee007,2009-12-01T09:01Z,The Picture is decent but the audio is way too fast....they all sound like chipmunks! lol
,marblue,2009-12-01T10:19Z,"from the sreenshots, i would say i'll just wait for the dvd copy. I might miss a single action with this...it seems blurry and dark...but nice try Jnu..."
,mix3,2009-12-02T03:54Z,can i play it in vlc??
,kayleelyn,2009-12-02T20:12Z,"Chipmunks? Are you listening to the same copy as me?  I previously had the crazy-torrent cam copy and this one is much better.  The audio in particular is extremely better, the other copy had lots of static and  background chatter.  The video, although more washed out because it must have originally been pretty dark, is a straight even picture.  This is a great overall copy this early in the game.  I would say as compared to DVD, A-7 V-6.  Totally watchable.

I do want to point out that unless ""Luna Nueva"" is ""New Moon"" in Russian, which I do not speak, this is a Spanish copy, not Russian as listed.  The months of the year are all in Spanish too in the scene where Bella is in her room."
