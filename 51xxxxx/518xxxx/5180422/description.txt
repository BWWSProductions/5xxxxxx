  P L O T  


                                                         
 Many things have gone missing in this world: Amelia     
 Earhart, D.B. Cooper, the Olmec civilization, Jeff      
 Tremaine's waistline, even the whole continent of       
 Atlantis. Most important and culturally relevant,       
 though, is a big mess of jackass segments that had      
 apparently slipped through a crack in Mianus and never  
 found a home on any of the DVD releases for the classic 
 MTV television series. The "Self Defense Test," "Stun   
 Collar," "Unicycle Poo Barf," "Fast Food Football,"     
 "Roller Jump," and "Satan vs. God" (in its original     
 long ass-kicking form!) are just some of the absurd     
 gold that what was once lost but now is found, not to   
 mention all the original show opens, credit montages,   
 and a bunch of other bonus footage that was never shown 
 on television -- or wasn't allowed to be shown --       
 featuring Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris 
 Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Preston Lacy, Wee-Man, Danger       
 Ehren, and Dave England in their earliest years of      
 basic cable fame and notoriety.                         
                                                         




  C A S T  


                                                         
                                                         
          Johnny Knoxville ... Himself

              Preston Lacy ... Himself                   
                                                         






      R E L E A S E  N O T E S       
  
  
                                                               
  Ok, so here's the deal. Normally we don't like to lower      
  ourselves to the point of mentioning p2p groups, but we      
  thought we should atleast mention the other release of this  
  movie, if you want to call it that. There was a release      
  already done by some crappy p2p group, but it had countless  
  things wrong with it. If each of the individual problems     
  had a measureable amount of mass, their combined size would  
  total just over 3.64 metric fucktons. There was bad AR, bad  
  framerate and on and on. And it was supposed to be a proper  
  of another rip! Seriously though, there wasn't a single      
  correct thing with that rip. You almost have to try in       
  order to fuck shit up that bad.                              
                                                               
  The only catch with this rip is that it had to be ripped at  
  the full 29.97fps since there was constant ghosting due to   
  the filming methods used. We ran into this problem back in   
  2002 with the original Jackass movie we ripped.              
                                                               
  Anyways... we hope you enjoy the REAL rip of this movie.     
                                                               
  Happy Turkey Day!
