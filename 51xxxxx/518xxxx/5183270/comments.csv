,Torgard,2009-12-08T18:01Z,"nvm, the crackfix fixes it :D"
,ffs,2009-12-10T23:21Z,"I'm getting a problem that hasn't been established yet-

the serious sam launcher runs perfectally, but whenever I click ""launch,"" nothing happens - as in, nothing at all - it just closes as if it's launching, but never launches.
I have UAC disabled - but before I did not, and when I didn't have it disabled, after everything I clicked on the launcher it came up with an alert box saying ""the operation was completed successfully.""
I'm rather confused on this one, and I would appreciate any help whether it fixes it or not.
I've also already installed the crack - but when I first ran the launcher, I didn't, so it's got nothing to do with the crack.

I'm running Intel Pentium Dual Cpu E2180 @ 2.00GHz, Nvida GeForce 9500, 2 GB ram, and Vista Home Premium 32-bit - althought I do not think it has anything to do with my specs.
Thanks in advance, I loved this game on xbox, and I really want to play it again."
,Torgard,2009-12-12T16:56Z,"@ffs

Try playing without using the launcher? All it does is making possible to choose language :P"
,Vekkus,2009-12-12T19:47Z,"Why does the save games all go corrupt? I'm on win 7, and i've tried everything from installing in x86, normal, using the crackfix, everything you could think of I did.

How do i fix that?"
,nurmihe,2009-12-13T10:42Z,"I installed it, but when i launch it, it will open Steam. Is that okay? "
,ffs,2009-12-14T00:43Z,"@Torgard

Yeah, I tried running it from SamHD.exe, but that doesn't work either - I tried running it with UAC on and without, still doesn't launch :S"
,rubiximus,2009-12-16T03:23Z,I'm having a LAN soon and heard that this game kicks. Does this version seem to work fine for the network play?
,Bujaaa,2009-12-25T12:34Z,Game works fine for me until final boss fight. Then it crashes. WTF?
,Zakafein,2010-01-14T15:04Z,new patch any1? very buggy game...
,masterw,2010-02-01T20:24Z,"Works perfectly on Windows 7 x64 in singleplayer mode.
Just make sure to overwrite the files in the ""Bin"" directory with the ones in the ""SKIDROW"" folder on the image and run the game as administrator.

Thanks a lot to SKIDROW and AiTB!"
,I_like_downloding_shit,2010-02-04T08:34Z,"I had no prob, i installed and started playing great Game and Great torrent thx alot!  >AiTB"

,Please_wait...,2010-02-08T07:02Z,How to play LAN cooperative mode ? It tells me I should log in to STEAM. Is there a way to bypass this? Like I used to play Left4Dead via console command maybe? Thanks!
,AHumanX,2010-02-12T22:27Z,"Win7 Save Fix:
This worked for me, hopefully it works for you. Very simple.

Step 1: Browse to your Serious Sam HD game install directory as follows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolver Digital\Serious Sam HD The First Encounter\Bin\

Step 2: Right click 'SamHD.exe' and select Properties. Click the 'Compatibility' tab and set the Compatibility mode to Windows XP Service Pack 3.

Step 3: Play the game and save to your hearts deepest desires.

Worked for me, good luck."
,D3vi1dog,2010-02-19T00:43Z,"I am having the same problem. I have tried all tips and comments and nothing works. I installed and overwrite the 'BIN' files with the ones in 'SKIDROW' and then try to launch the game with and without the launcher. NOTHING happens. The hourglass thing pops up next to the cursor like it's loading, but nothing. Help??

@AHumanX
I dont have the option to run it in compatibility with Windows XP SP 3. it only gives me widows 95, 98, ME, NT 4.0 SP5 and 2000 "
,U_Rebel_Scum,2010-02-24T07:32Z,"I'm running XP Pro SP3 and this runs fine.  Do not need to burn to disc, just unzip to a folder then install.  Go to the ""Bin"" folder in the installed ""Serious Sam"" folder and replace the installed files with the ones from the Skidrow folder.  Easy!"
,MachineGhost,2010-03-13T05:37Z,"I can't save games either, what do?"
,rex_shark,2010-03-20T13:59Z,"i know how to play this game in co-op
you need a loader+the crack, download the loader here http://teknogods.com/phpbb/download/file.php?id=89
if it do not work register and download from here http://teknogods.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=998&sid=4f3a4c07afd8d314565e4bc27a083072
first install the game, then crack it like normal, then put the stuff from the download in the serious sam hd/bin directory
start the game with TeknoGods_SamHD.exe
worked great for me :D"
,leviminator94,2010-04-12T00:11Z,I can't save! What's the problem?
,Flaxe17,2010-04-15T19:24Z,"Downloaded this torrent, absolutely amazing thanks so much :) i decided to try help as much as i can here:

IF IT RUNS STEAM WHEN YOU OPEN:
Go to My Computer, right click and explore the iso file and open the SKIDROW folder. Copy all files from there and put them in the BIN folder of wherever you saved the game, owverwriting when necessary. Then, pin SAMHD to desktop and run that (delete Sam Launcher).

IF YOU CANT SAVE:
When launching from SAMHD, right click and run as administrator every time, this is both loading and saving.

Hope it helps, Flaxe :)"
,norwegian13,2010-05-02T18:05Z,"Same problem as Bujaaa: Works perfectly fine until final boss fight, then freezes.  It's just before the boss is about to break some rubbish in the map, could that have something to do with it? Some missing material perhaps?"
,soka313,2010-05-11T18:08Z,pls upload second enocounter HD (:
,Snaffer,2010-05-23T16:20Z,"Works great!

* Installed fast and easy
* Copied the crack files to the Bin folder
* Lauched the game through SeriousLauncher.exe

Keep it up SKIDROW
+1 for uploader"

,Dj510O,2011-02-08T03:27Z,"Okay for you who are having troubles installing this I have created you a detailed step-by-step guide to walk you through it here:
Requirements: ISOMounter (PowerIso,Daemon Tools,etc.)
1.Download the torrent.
2.Mount the ISO and run it.
3.The ISO will run the setup and installer application and then it will install Serious Sam HD.
4.Now extract the files from the SKIDROW folder that is in the ISO to this directory:C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolver Digital\Serious Sam HD The First Encounter\Bin
The SeriousSamHDLauncher should be on the desktop,if not go back to the Bin folder of Serious Sam and create a shortcut for the SeriousSamLauncher.
5.Right Click Serious Sam Launcher and click Run As Administrator.
6.Game should work perfectly! Just at the end because the boss battle freezes and no ending :(  But here's the crackfix:Go into AiTB's description and click the 2nd link which has crackfix at the end of the url.Then download this torrent and open the Zipped file with an extractor program such as WinRar. Get the SKIDROW.dll in the winrar file and use this to replace the SKIDROW.dll in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolver Digital\Serious Sam HD The First Encounter\Bin "
