                          No More Tears (Enough Is Enough).(1979)  

                       Single by Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer

                      
   "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)" is a duet from 1979 by Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand. While Summer was famous for her disco material and Streisand for her more easy listening and soundtrack work (though both had crossed over into other genres before), this song fused both sounds with a slow beginning (lasting almost two minutes) which then evolved into a disco song. The song then becomes something of a feminist anthem with two women taking action against their men and throwing them out.

   
   To date Summer or Streisand have never performed the song together live since recording it, although Summer still sings the song live in concert with other female performers.
