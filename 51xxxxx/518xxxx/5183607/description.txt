Honeymooning couple Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) is hiking an eleven-mile trail in Hawaii when they cross paths will ex-military man Nick (Timothy Olyphant), who earns their trust by helping them navigate a particularly treacherous mountain cliff. A few yards later, the trio runs into a group of girls whose parents are begging them to return home following reports that a honeymooning couple has been murdered on one of the other islands. The suspects in the killings are a young white couple, and when Cliff and Cydney meet Nick's frees-spirited girlfriend Gina (Kiele Sanchez), tensions start to rise. The further the foursome walk together, the more delicate the balance of trust and suspicion becomes.
