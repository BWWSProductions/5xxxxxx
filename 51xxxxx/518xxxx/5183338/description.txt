This was requested by someone who subsequently canceld his request but since i have allready done all the pre-release work il upload it anyway, hope you'l enjoy it. :)

note that this is only the complete release of the original run, the extra volume from the re-publication and the side stories/oneshots whatever are not included.

As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. Nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. Credits pages and possibly some fan art could be included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.

summery (from mangatraders)

These rather disturbing tales tell the story of a high-school girl named Tomie, who can be seen as a living embodiment of lust and all the negative emotions that go along with it, such as jealousy. Tomie is the ultimate self-destructive entity, yet ironically she survives anything. Every male who encounters Tomie becomes obsessed with her and eventually kills and dismembers her. But Tomie is not human, and is always reborn...
