      The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret - US
      comedian David Cross plays Todd Margaret, a hapless office drone
      who flukes his way into a top management job heading up the
      British division of a US multinational. All he has to do is sell
      a dozen container loads of dodgy Korean energy drinks before his
      psychotic boss, Will Arnett, visits in a week's time. It doesn't
      help that he knows nothing about the UK or selling things.
      What's more, he only has one very unhelpful employee to assist
      him. Needless to say, it doesn't go swimmingly and Todd's
      spectacular failure to impress beautiful caf owner Alice only
      makes things worse.
