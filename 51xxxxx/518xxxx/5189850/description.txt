The Patriots begins with the indoctrination of ambitious young International Operations (I.O.) agent Zach Donovan, who is paired with beautiful, battle-hardened veteran Rocky Boorman.  The duo gets more than they bargained for on their first assignment, as Zach helps Rocky confront a deadly ghost from her I.O. past.  Future issues find the agents tackling biological and chemical weapons, genetic-engineering experiments gone terribly wrong, and a host of other I.O. projects that never should have seen the light of day.

Co-written by Brandon Choi and Jonathan Peterson and pencilled by Michael Ryan.
