Mose Allison - My Backyard 
Original Release Date: April 9, 1990 
Label: Blue Note Records 
Quality: flac

On this album, recorded in New Orleans with local jazz players, Allison's mature style intertwines his signature pithy, sardonic lyrics and harmonic dissonance with classic Big Easy street rhythm.  An icon to a generation of rockers, he still writes songs that span the broad emotional and musical spectrum; his originals, notably the satirical "Ever Since I Stole the Blues" and a comical rumination on mortality titled "Was," join his cover of the standard "Your Red Wagon" to reveal that after thirty years the hep cat's message still brings it home. ~ Frank John Hadley 1993
