Words are not strong enough to say how great those albums are and how happy I am to have them. The albums are perfect except two little things; it seems that there's a title and artist name problem in the album ""Sensation 2001 - 2CD"", get the right title and artist thru softs like Winamp/ Auto Tag. ""Sensation White - The Megamixes 2008 - 2CD"" is not the true one, it is in fact the normal Sensation White, not Megamix. The sound quality of ""Sensation 2000 Set's"" is not that good as it seems to be a ""radio rip"". Excepts those little things, those albums are great. Thanks once more..
**As good as Sensation..**"
