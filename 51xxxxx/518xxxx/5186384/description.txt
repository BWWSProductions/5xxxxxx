Here's the blah...blah:


On his seventh release Guitar Jock, Ed Maly delivers a set of scathing blues-rock songs. Malyâ€™s guitar playing on the album is a pleasure to any blues fan, and he is aptly backed by his band to create a smart combination of toe-tapping rhythms and inspiring guitar melodies. The guitaristsâ€™ raspy vocals on tracks like â€œThatâ€™s Just How Muchâ€ and â€œSeven Deadlyâ€ tops the sound of Guitar Jock off nicely, giving the album a classic blues feel.

Maly does a great job changing out guitar and rhythm styles on Guitar Jock to bring a level of diversity to his songs that keeps each track sounding fresh. The opening track â€œThatâ€™s Just How Muchâ€ and the title-song â€œGuitar Jockâ€ are anchored by the impressive soloing of Maly. However, he adds in a second guitar line that makes the most of wah- wah pedal, giving the tracks an undeniable funk feel. 



Maly pulls this funky-blues sound off several times on Guitar Jock with a lot of success, most notably on â€œCinderellaâ€ and the correctly titled â€œWah Wah Eyes.â€ 

Other songs on the LP have their roots in jazz as well as blues. The wailing key melodies of â€œSeven Deadlyâ€ and â€œGuitar Manâ€ showcase this aspect of Malyâ€™s sound well. 

At other times, Guitar Jock uses a more traditional blues sound. The simmering guitar melodies of â€œIf You Were A Guitar,â€ â€œHappy Bluesâ€ and â€œHistoryâ€ leave no doubt that Maly is a talented blues musician. 

Fans of country music will also find something to like on the record. The twangy melodies of â€œCountry Girlâ€ and â€œGet-ter Bugâ€ build a rockabilly vibe that country fans will find hard not to get along with.

No matter what kind of stylistic changes Ed Maly uses on Guitar Jock, he has success with all of them. The album is a unique take on the blues that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy.
