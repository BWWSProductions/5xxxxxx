,tpb_tpb,2010-01-14T15:40Z,"hello dear, no need for special glasses or tv
you can watch this in any tv, laptop,desktop etc
provided you wear simple red transperant glass/plastic/paper on right eye and cyan (blue+green) on left eye.
for this you can use transperancy sheet printed with inkjet printer with diamension similar to glasses.
any querry ask me here in this comment"
