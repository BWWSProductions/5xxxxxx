,kubar123,2010-06-20T14:19Z,"for people having problems (thinking its a trial)
go into my computer->drive c->program files-> iobit -> iobit smart defrag
than replace the ""IObit SmartDefrag.exe""  with  ""IObit SmartDefrag.exe"" provided by pazdog

-> update (free) (good coz it replaces all the icons from the cracked one to the full one"
