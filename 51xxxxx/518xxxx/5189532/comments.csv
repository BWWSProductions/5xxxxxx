,Asianairline,2009-12-01T12:37Z,"Sorry for you ""k_ennyface"" but any poeple like Thai or asian movie (China, Korean, HK...) If you don't like, at this tracker you have thousands movies. Give alternative choice of movies!"
[T],Redhat98,2009-12-04T01:13Z,"This is a great movie and many people here can  understand Asian languages. Is the pirate Bay only for movies in English? 

I got the DVD as soon it came out a few days ago.
