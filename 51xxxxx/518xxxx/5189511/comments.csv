,blueboy2419,2009-12-01T02:37Z,"I had a direct request to reseed some episodes, this was one of them. I couldn't use the old torrent file. it reported an error when checking the file size. I think (only think) that the original file had mono sound and the new one has stereo. 

Marisha might know as this was a problem with a few of these earlier files."
,Marisha84,2009-12-01T03:31Z,"Yes, some files have mono sound, but the earlier file of this episode have stereo."
,blueboy2419,2009-12-01T08:40Z,"Apologies for any confusion, whatever happened I had to create a new torrent to carry on the seeding. I wouldn't expect anyone to d/l it if they were happy with a version they already had. 

Happy days !!"
