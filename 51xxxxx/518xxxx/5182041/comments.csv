,pegbundy,2009-12-06T18:23Z,Didn't work for me. Couldn't get the program to load from this download so I downloaded from the software site and installed. Supposed to replace original files with included ones. Couldn't find those either. Big waste of my time. Thanks TVTeam. Maybe I am just a big dummy but I couldn't get this to work.
,sweetcar,2009-12-07T22:10Z,Didn't work for me either. Maybe there are steps that should be added.
,Sylevar,2009-12-19T08:14Z,"Okay, for those who can't figure it out.. here's how you do it.

1> download ALL parts!
2> Right click on the 4 ZIPPED FOLDERS and EXTRACT HERE!
3> Right click on the 4 RAR FILES and EXTRACT
4> Double Click on the folder this will create
5> Double Click on Xlinksoft Converter


This will install it, though I can't seem to find the crack for this."
,Sylevar,2009-12-19T08:19Z,"Okay, figured out the crack..

once installed, right click on the desktop icon
select properties
click ""Find Target""
Now, in a new window, open up the download folder you downloaded to
locate the ""QUANTiZE"" folder
inside is a Help.dll file
copy this over to the application folder
and this will crack it.

Any more questions?"
