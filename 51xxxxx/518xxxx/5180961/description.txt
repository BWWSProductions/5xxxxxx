       It is the most important road in Wales, but the M4 was never 
       designed to carry the millions who use it now. Week in Week Out 
       talks to people whose livelihoods depend on the motorway and 
       examines the efforts to improve it.

       After 40 years the M4 through South Wales is feeling the strain, 
       congestion is commonplace. A relief road to take some of the 
       pressure off has been ruled out, so what next? Week In Week Out 
       investigates the state of the M4. Just how bad is it, and whats 
       being done to ensure we keep moving?
