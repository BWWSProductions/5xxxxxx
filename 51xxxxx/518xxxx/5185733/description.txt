    [ Release Notes ]

      On September 11, 2001 the world watched in shock and disbelief as planes
      flew in to New Yorks World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington,
      and Americans realized they were under attack. But by whom? What really
      happened? In The Unofficial Story, the fifth estates Bob McKeown
      introduces us to people who believe the real force behind the attacks
      was not Osama Bin Laden, but the U.S. government itself.

      Emerging from the dust and debris that day was a movement, known these
      days as 9/11 Truth or truthers  people who believe that 9/11 was part
      of a vast conspiracy and cover-up by a criminal faction within the U.S.
      government. As the fifth estate reports, public opinion polls now show
      that the majority of Americans believe the Bush Administration had
      advance knowledge of those attacks and somehow allowed them to happen
      and that one-third of Canadians share the same belief.

      In The Unofficial Story, Bob McKeown explores why these questions and
      theories are growing in popularity.

      Youll meet some of the leading proponents of truther theories: Richard
      Gage, an American architect, explains how the WTC twin towers and the
      lesser known Tower #7 could only have crumbled as they did due to
      explosive charges placed inside the buildings. Others, including Canadian
      professor Kee Dewdney, insist that the story of the brave fight by the
      passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 must have been a hoax. But, youll
      also hear from others who dispel truther theories and try to understand
      why, from JFKs assassination to the moon landing to 9/11, a culture of
      conspiracy springs up around certain historic events.

      Despite the difference of opinion between those who blame the hijackers
      and those who blame their own government, the real importance of the
      fight over 9/11 truth is that it may have less to do with the past than
      the future.
