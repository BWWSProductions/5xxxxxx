,HansTek,2010-12-07T13:43Z,"This is the best size for hi-res.
Just noticed some visible pixels starting with the word ""REC"" & ""video timer"" in the recording video scene at the beginning of the movie & the following scenes, but not that noticeable for regular viewing.

Almost perfect. V9/A9

Tnx for the download, this is helpful for others, especially those size conscious peers.
but i gotta keep the 4.37GB of aoloffline.
Tnx again, keep it up!"
,HansTek,2010-12-07T13:45Z,"for those guys looking for subs, use media player classic and go to file menu, subtitle download."
