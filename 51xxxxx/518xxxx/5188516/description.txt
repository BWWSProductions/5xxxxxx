Cosmic Egg is the second studio album by Australian hard rock band Wolfmother, released on 23 October 2009. It is the first album released by the second lineup of the band, featuring bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins, formed after original members Chris Ross and Myles Heskett left in August 2008.

Dave Atkins (drummer) is a recogniseable face in the Australian music scene, as he has been performing with a number of other groups over the past decade or so. Perhaps best known as the drummer for the Resin Dogs, he also played for Pangaea back in the late 90s.
