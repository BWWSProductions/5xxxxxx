Basically an old school point and click adventure game. Now playable across multiple platforms thanks to ScummVM

Sam & Max Hit the Road is a graphic adventure computer game released by LucasArts during the company's adventure games era. LucasArts began development of the game in 1989, wanting to use new settings and characters after the success of the past Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island adventure titles. Sam & Max Hit the Road is a 2D adventure game where the player controls the actions of Sam from a third-person perspective. The player uses Sam to explore the pre-rendered cartoon environments of the game and solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface.
