        SiSoftware Sandra (the System ANalyser, Diagnostic and Reporting
          Assistant) is an information & diagnostic utility. It should
       provide most of the information (including undocumented) you need
        to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether
                             hardware or software.

        It works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it
        tries to go beyond them and show you more of what's really going
       on. Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high
         and low-level. You can get information about the CPU, chipset,
          video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network,
         Windows internals, AGP, ODBC Connections, USB2, 1394/Firewire,
                                     etc.
