""Subs: English/English(Forced)..."" "
,joshokie,2009-12-02T22:47Z,"Sorry, my last comment got cut off. 

Are subs are hardcoded throughout? Or only for lines not spoken in English?"
,xylolz,2009-12-03T02:53Z,thanks very much
,smilt123,2009-12-03T05:32Z,"I have a question about converting to bluray and playing on a ps3. Does the file have to be burned to playback on a ps3, or can you just transfer the file to the ps3 and play it that way?"
[V],Murlok,2009-12-04T18:15Z,smilt123  all is in the info read:)
,StevenK08,2009-12-05T13:13Z,Eggcellent
,Paperhouse2007,2009-12-12T04:36Z,"There is a program called mkv2vob that will convert this to a file that will play directly on a PS3 without a disc.  However, putting it all in rar files was kinda annoying.  I still don't get why people do that."
,BuffaloD,2009-12-13T22:06Z,"I know this is a noob question, but I've always skipped uploads with all the rars. Do I have to just go 1 by 1 and unpack each of the rars individually or is there 1 thing you run that unpacks them all in a batch file or something?"
,djtymon,2009-12-15T02:54Z,"@BuffaloD

Winrar extracts them in 1 go, extract the file with .rar extension and it will automatically cycle through the .r00 files & output the contents"
,shmootz5,2009-12-15T08:44Z,the subtitles don't seem to be hard-coded when converted to mp4 and played on ps3. anyone help? thanks :D
,movieshopper70,2009-12-17T01:33Z,New to this...I see someone mentioned WinRar...willUtoreent do this as well...anything special that needs to be done before playing...just using cpu to play. Thanks in advance.
,dsorc,2009-12-20T16:22Z,"The subtitles are English srt softsubs (you can enable disable and format them). They are throughout the movie, not only for non English parts.

Video quality is great.

To unpack open down-ingb-1080p.rar with winrar and extract."
,stinkbutt,2009-12-22T22:05Z,The subs are very much hardcoded.  They're not SRT files either.  Have you even looked at the files?

""New to this...I see someone mentioned WinRar...willUtoreent do this as well...anything special that needs to be done before playing...""

utorrent just downloads the files.  in this case they are rar files.  To open .rar files, you use winrar, and select the one ending in .rar, not .r03 and so on.  Then, after unraring, you have a MKV file, for this, you will need VLC player, get it from http://videolan.org.  and have a fast computer with a true 1080p monitor.  
FYI everybody, if you have even a little sub, use the 5.1 sound encoding for a much better experience!!!!!!    
This movie is a real fine piece of work btw...

,fisken82,2009-12-26T22:24Z,"Hi I tried extracting it, it said ""extract files"" but i wont open???
What am i doing wrong??? I have VLC player.
But the winrar program i have sais that i have to buy the program, it this true???? Thanks for any help;-)"
,gostavos,2009-12-26T22:52Z,Can't use any other subtitle but the two english ones. Tried playing it with both VLC and Media Player Classic. Anyone know what to do?
,jkhab,2009-12-28T21:59Z,I'm having an issue with the playback.  It is very choppy and pauses on certain scenes and doesn't move on from there.  Anyone have an idea of what's going on?
,Spironic,2009-12-30T07:55Z,"""It's like releasing DVDR's that don't run in DVD Players."" -Murlok

Not to nitpick, but don't must dvd releases require transcoding to burn onto DVDs?  Pretty much everything is in either avi, mp4 or mpg, none of which can be burned to DVD player-compatible DVDs without transcoding.  It kind of kills the analogy a little bit.."
,Sickpup120,2009-12-30T17:01Z,Thanks +1
[V],Murlok,2009-12-31T20:42Z,Spironic sorry you not like it.But to get something for free does also means that you know something! About how to handle it.
,Theorydqvist,2010-01-01T04:19Z,How do I get Swedish subtitles for this movie. ther is one swe.sub file but fails to get it work. only works with English subtitles
,portuga2010,2010-01-28T23:49Z,"the subs are all F***ed up 
i can fire it up on vlc but it only works in english 
and as my pc is crap it doesnt plays the vid smoothly so i use core avc + windows media player that cant read the .sup files 
any srt files that i know wmp will read ?
or any solution to the problem ?"
,styriantj,2010-01-29T20:54Z,"Thanks for this HQ file!!! I have one prob though: no sound at all, player says it has no codec to play sound. Which codec is needed?
Thanks
styriantj"
,Yurn2,2010-01-30T13:00Z,Don't download this if you're looking for a quality 1080p rip as the video bitrate is too low. It should be double or nearly triple what it is.
,Normalcy,2010-02-03T09:56Z,does this torrent have the fucked up subs that prevent you from reading any of the in-movie german & french subs?
,carlosgmsousa,2010-03-13T12:01Z,Don't download this. It has one file attached named mkv2blu that is a trojan horse. Next time just upload the damn movie and let the rest to the users. Retard...
,FormaldehydeFTW,2010-05-23T16:39Z,"My apologies for asking what may be a noob question but, when the download is finished and the rars extracted, will I have an mkv file?"
,i89nnop,2010-10-23T14:01Z, fucken trojan releaser...
