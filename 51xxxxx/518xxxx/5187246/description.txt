This is the second EP release preview of a new artist called infraBuse. It's called "A state of Mind" : a sonic onslaught of ferocious bass, head cracking drums and complex rhythms. With influences from experimental hiphop, broken beat and dubstep, infraBuse has grown, taking a next step in its evolution towards crafting its own form of futuristic glitch-hop. With a nod toward the resurgence in the instrumental hiphop beats-movement, as well as the still growing dubstep bass-oriented culture, infraBuse has this time injected a larger degree of dance sensibility into the music, in an effort to carve its niche with a new school dance floor sound.

Check this out if you like Glitch Hop artists like The Glitch Mob, Nosaj Thing, Beats Antique, Bassnectar, PantyRaid, Ill Gates, etc.
