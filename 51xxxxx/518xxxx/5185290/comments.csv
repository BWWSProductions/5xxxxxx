,OwlPox,2009-11-28T23:58Z,"I hadn't heard of Taws before.  There is a lot of cross-pollination between bodywork modalities on the W. Coast of the US.  I've seen Cranio-Sacral Therapy often added to the repertoire of Rolfers for addressing more delicate issues such as sports injuries and the like.  I'm not an expert here at all.  Eric Dalton (a Rolfer) has made a set of videos aimed at injury related work, but I don't have them.  Sorry."
