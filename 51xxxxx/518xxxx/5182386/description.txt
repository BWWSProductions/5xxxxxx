Notes
-----
This is not my torrent originally, but it was hard to find and took awhile to get since there was nobody seeding most of the time. I fixed a typo in one of the song titles and unzipped the uselessly 1% compressed art work, otherwise it's the same. This is my first torrent, enjoi.

You know you have enough bandwidth | PLEASE SEED.
