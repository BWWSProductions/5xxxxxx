,ryboi,2009-12-03T13:21Z,"Question: How do you select which version to install? I have installed on 2 machines and both times it installed ultimate. That was what I wanted on one, but the other can't handle ultimate. I did upgrades for both. Do you have to do a clean install in order to choose which version to install???"
,hostage24,2009-12-03T13:40Z,Do need an activation key to install this at all? Anyone!
,casper07,2009-12-03T15:08Z,"@ ryboi
i didn't do a clean install
it just installed ultimate

@hostage24
i just click next when it asked for key and its working fine"
,hostage24,2009-12-03T15:17Z,"Thanks Casper07, much appreciated. Has anyone done a clean install, and did it ask for the activation key?"
,hostage24,2009-12-03T15:24Z,"I'm only asking now guys about a product key because I'm downloading it now, and I'm just trying to find out if I will need one before I do a clean install. I'm not one for surprises. It would be much appreciated if some one could tell me,.... thanks!"
,ryboi,2009-12-03T15:55Z,"ok, I figured it out. If you just burn the downloaded iso you can only install ultimate. In order to get the options to choose which edition to install, you need to either extract the iso image or burn the image and then copy all the files and folders to your hard drive. Then, with the copy on your hard drive,  you need to go into the Sources folder and delete ei.cfg. Then burn the files and folders back to DVD making it bootable. Now whether you do an upgrade or clean install, you will be given the option to choose which edition you want to install.

hostage24: No key is required whether doing a clean install or an upgrade. Just uncheck to activate online, then click next and click no when it warns you. Windows will be activated once installed. "
,hostage24,2009-12-03T23:37Z,"Thanks ryboi, its much appreciated."
,MoreFree,2009-12-04T21:12Z,"You need to install this without key.. it will be activated when you done installing automaticly.. 

But please keep this torrent up!"
,hostage24,2009-12-05T13:59Z,"This has got to be one of the best torrents I have ever downloaded. I works beautifully. Thank you up-loader, and everyone who helped with my questions,... you are all brilliant."
,erixon35,2009-12-05T20:26Z,Does this have both 32 and 64 bit OS's?
,casper07,2009-12-06T02:26Z,"my ratio is just 4.0 ill have to stop seeding now, iv done my bit, thank you uploader"

,Stoner3,2009-12-08T05:08Z,"After I delete the ei.cfg,to make it bootable what file inside of Windows 7 do I load as the boot?"

Experienced users can also fix the problem manually by following the steps detailed at the very same support page:

,Kronic777,2009-12-23T10:05Z,"First I'd like to thank MorerFree for all the work that was done and for posting it for all of us to share! For all you Netbook owners wondering if this is going to work with Atom Intel Processor... YES it worked Perfectly! For the first time EVER installing an OS without having to find the drivers for anything at all! WOW! What a F**king thrill!! I did a CLEAN install of the Windows7 Ultimate version on my ACER ASPIRE ONE 1.6ghz 1gb Ram with an EXTERNAL USB DVD Drive since my NETBOOK has no internal dvd drive. I know there are ways to install this via a USB external drive or USB PENDRIVE by making them bootable but it's  a wise investment to buy an External DVD/Burner ANYWAY  I previously had Dualboot WindowsXP & MacOSX. During the install it shows you all the Partitions on your harddrive and it lets you delete them one by one from there until your left with 1 partion showing the full size of your harddrive and even an option to specifically choose how many GB of your harddrive you'd like to use. I didn't even need to Format the drive! When the install asks for the Serial/Productkey just LEAVE IT BLANK an UNCHECK the ONLY box that is there, if by chance you forget to UNCHECK the box DON'T PANIC just don't give any info on your wireless internet or disconnect your ethernet cable so it won't register automatically to Windows. Just complete the install and you are DONE!!! You DO NOT NEED ANY CRACK OR SERIAL # OR PRODUCT KEY AT ALL!!!! THIS IS ""PRE"" ACTIVATED ALREADY! In fact there is nothing there to activate. You can't put a serial number even if you WANTED to! You can even do windows updates. This is an ENGISH version but you can download the Language pack with the Mirosoft Update! 

My ONLY question to the MoreFree Team is, since you removed the WAT from this Windows7, does this mean it will still work after March 2010? Please let me know...

Thanks AGAIN!!

KRONIC777 is also my PS3 username! Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 ROCKS!!!"
,LarsaSolidor,2009-12-25T01:20Z,Yeh will this still work after the march 2010 update??
,ottoman96,2010-01-12T21:27Z,About to try editing the ISO to obtain access to other versions... Can someone please answer the March 2010 question? Will this indeed stop working after that point?
,MoreFree,2010-02-22T14:15Z,"I think after the march WAT update it will totaly reinstall WAT. So i think you guys need to re-remove WAT with HAZAR's crack.
You can find it on google. Search for Hazar's forum:
its the first link.
Then go to Releases and you will see RemoveWAT."
,spinaker2007,2010-03-17T10:58Z,everything was fine till the 1oth now a window keeps popping up asking me to validate this shit. any fixes for this or should i just validate and see if it works
,SAMIAM72,2010-09-23T05:40Z,Absolutely awesome corrent!!! Thank you MOreFree!!!  I ran the ISO from virtual drive chose to go to windows for updates and do a new (clean install) everything went as smooth as silk.  Awesome OS windows 7. I burnt it to a cd and tried on another computer and it will not load from the CD.  I tried 50 different hings nothing worked.  I am downloading the torrent again and I will just run it like the other machine. I used magic disc to load it in the virtual drive. If someone has some info on what i am doing wrong i would appreciate it. THank you.
