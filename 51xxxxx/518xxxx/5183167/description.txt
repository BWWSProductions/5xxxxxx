Hi Guys,


This is the first release of the MoreFree Team.


This is Windows 7 with ALL Version's of 32Bit.


All the versions are activated using RemoveWAT2.0 by Razor.

What Razar Said on his forum:
--
RemoveWAT is a tool that removes WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, while still retaining genuine status and receiving all updates. You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender etc.


In theory this should have a 100% success rate on all machines.

--
Google for more infomation!

Both methods will work only i recommend a fresh install.
Tutorial for Upgrading:
1. Mount this ISO. with for exemple: Daemon Tools Lite. I Recommend to Enable Auto Mound. )
2. Just follow instructions of the DVD and skip product key.


For Fresh install:
Just burn it with IsoBurn for exemple.
and let your computer boot on DVD Drive.
