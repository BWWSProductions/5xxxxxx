,CHOOKA03,2010-01-14T08:49Z,"Absolutely AWESOME collection. Thank you for taking the time to do this! Why should we pay big bucks for the rich to get richer.
Only one book needed from here...the god of candlesticks..Stevie Nison - Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques.
Very expensive book to buy but a must have .
Awesome thx again!"
