"BURN . E" Hilarious All-New Animated Short for "WALL . E" by DisneyÂ® PixarÂ®

This is one of the WALL . E dvd extras and is very funny. 

The BURN . E robot must fix one of the Axiom's transmitters, and each time in doing so, is distracted and fails. He tries three times, and his commander robot SUPPLY . R is fustrated with BURN . E for not completing the replacement of the transmitter. Upon finishing on the third time, the Axiom has already arrived on earth, and BURN. E cannot find anything, as everything has come off the ship. He launches an escape pod out the side of the ship out to everyone else and has a party, when the lid of the pod pops out and falls on the same transmitter again.
