The whole movie is not here."

Does this version say ""SPIRIT AWARDS"" on the screen through the whole film? or is it the dark grany one? Or did you rip this yourself and quality check it before you uploaded it?"
,yoncenator,2010-02-23T06:03Z,"For those who care this is the same dark grany one going around with text but the text is blurred out so there's a splotchy mark instead of text.

Whatever why couldn't you say you just put it in MP4 format from someone else's upload? I always give credit when I'm taking from someone else's torrent. You should too.

Think I'll stick w/ my 'Spirit Awards' copy at least it's one or two generations cleaner."
