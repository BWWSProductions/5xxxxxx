Austen Tayshus (pronounced "ostentatious") is the stage name of the Jewish Australian comedian Alexander 'Sandy' Gutman, born Sydney, New South Wales, Australia on 17 March 1954. He is the son of a Holocaust survivor, is pro-Israel, and lives in Rose Bay, New South Wales.

Austen Tayshus burst into the consciousness of Australians in 1983 performing his comedy single, Australiana, a piece written by fellow comedian Billy Birmingham. This was a spoken word piece using Australian terms that conjured up different words built on extensive sets of equivocations, such as "...my mate Boomer rang", "...do you wanna game of Euchre Lyptus", and "...how much can a koala bear?" . It was the nation's biggest selling single of the year.
