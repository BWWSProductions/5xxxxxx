,Flawlessjess,2009-11-30T04:06Z,Twilight sucks bad series made into bad movies
,isisx3,2009-11-30T09:58Z,"I think it's so funny when people leave comments saying ""this movie sucks"" or something, because its like, well you sure are wasting enough time searching for a torrent then commenting on it when you don't even like it aren't you? If you don't like it that's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there's no reason to leave negative comments. Get a life."
,kumidian,2009-12-02T00:15Z,"haha. right on isis. i won't be downloading this myself, sorry, i'm sure it's a good rip though. 

you gotta admit, people that go out of their way to actively seek something to insult (when they probably secretly enjoy it--you know, like homophobes) are pretty good for a laugh. 

hopefully ""flawlessjess"" goes out of their way to find every twilight torrent out there and warn people about how terrible a series it is, so people don't suspect 'em of actually liking it!"
,lb963,2009-12-03T05:24Z,"isisx3, I'm stuck at 98.7% dl'd.  there seem to be plenty of seeds, any idea what's going on?"
,lb963,2009-12-03T05:33Z,"I've watched the entire movie....A6 or 7/ V9
Its the BEST cam I've seen so far, colorful, not grainy.  Thanks isisx3!"
,lhubble2005,2009-12-03T23:03Z,I prefer and use your torrents Isisx3. You always have good stuff. You are the only one who keeps up to date House M.D. shows weekly. I depend on you for that! I have no t.v. So thank you and keep sharing! I am new to this stuff but you're my favorite so far. Thank you! :) 
,isisx3,2009-12-07T13:08Z,"aw thanks you guys! 

lb963 I hope you finished downloading. A little advice, sometimes your torrent downloader locks into all the seeders that happen to not be seeding or to have their upload limits to like 1 or 2. A way to fix this in uTorrent is...

Options>Preferences>
Under the ""bandwidth"" section at the bottom it says ""Number of Connections"" 

Set your Global Maximum number of connections to something high like 2000, and your Maximum number of connections to torrent to like 500 or 600, that way you'll connect to a lot more people if they are available to download from. :) GL."
,isisx3,2010-01-08T00:06Z,Voçe precisa de um programa tipo VLC para ver o video com a legenda. Pode usar windows media player também mais eu prefiro muito mais VLC. Se o vídeo e a legenda esta com o mesmo nome na mesma pasta e se voce estiver usando o ultimo lançamento do VLC so de clicar no vídeo e pedir para abrir com o VLC ja vai ativar a legenda tb. Boa sorte.
