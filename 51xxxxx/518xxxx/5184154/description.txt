"Ti Sento" is a single by German techno group Scooter, based on the 1986 song of the same name by Italian group Matia Bazar. The single features the former singer of Matia Bazar, Antonella Ruggiero, and was the second release from the 2009 album Under the Radar Over the Top.




The 1940s-themed video premiÃ¨red on 18 September, 2009. Shot in a cinematic style, it depicts the three band members, H. P. Baxxter, Rick J. Jordan, and Michael Simon escorting Antonella Ruggiero into an opera house, wearing full formal outfits. They enter through a storm of paparazzi and reporters. Jordan and Simon appear to be securing the premises, as Baxxter goes to a balcony seat. Ruggiero portrays an operatic singer, and she prepares for a large show before a mirror. Jordan spots an attractive woman climbing the stairs, and doesn't give it a second thought. Ruggiero exits out on the stage, and sings for a full house. Baxxter, Jordan, and Simon watch the show, and they notice an assassin (who is in fact the woman Jordan spotted earlier) poking a high precision rifle (the rifle is a .177 12 multi-shot CO2 air rifle) through the curtains on the floor above them. Jordan and Simon run up the stairs to apprehend the shooter, while Baxxter throws himself off the balcony in a failed attempt to take the bullet for Ruggiero. The bullet is fired, and Ruggiero dies in Baxxter's arms at the end of the video, as they escape the opera house.


An extended version of the video premiÃ¨red 25 September, 2009. The video features over 2 minutes of extra footage, and the extended version of the song. The end of the video shows the reflections of the three band members failed attempts to stop the sniper from killing Ruggiero. [5] The video was inspired by the opera scene in 1997 science fantasy film The Fifth Element.

The video, like many other Scooter videos, features a historic automobile.
