SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CLAUDE ELWOOD SHANNON
MYRIAD Presents: 36 Papers by the father of Information Theory

This torrent is a collection of papers by Shannon, who founded the discipline
of Information Theory in his classic 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of 
Communication". This paper is included along with many more classics which
are not publicly accessible on the Web. Also included are book reviews by 
Shannon, editorials he wrote and the text of the 3 US Patents he was granted.

When you read in the introduction of textbooks and your professors tell you
that you should 'study the original work of great mathematicians', they didn't
mean that you should go and read one of Euler's 10,000 papers on infinite 
sums which don't use proper notation and are all in Latin or Swiss, they mean
that you should grab this torrent and learn from Shannon.

Essential for mathematicians, engineers, hackers and cryptographers.

We are still looking for some of the rest of these papers, so if you have
electronic copies or can access them, get in touch with MYRIAD at
myriadwarez@gmail.com

If you want to help MYRIAD, have access to mathematical material that 
should be available to all, or want to suggest what we should release,
get in touch at myriadwarez@gmail.com, we are pretty friendly ppl. 

Greetz to quad, generic and chitsock who joined MYRIAD and who are
helping us with downloading, preparing releases and with uploading.
RIP to tpb tracker - thanks for the good times, looking forward to the 
next stage of torrent evolution. THANKS TO ALL THE SEEDERS!
