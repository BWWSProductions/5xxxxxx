Peter Kolinsky was among the world's foremost experts on rare books, with a top position at a prestigious auction house, until black marketers took an interest in him. Since narrowly avoiding jail time, Peter's lived a lonely life in a tiny apartment, with a menial job he hates.

Things look like they might turn around when, looking for a late-night snack, Peter wanders into a cafÃ© and meets Angela. She shows him the Archives, where books currently being written are somehow on the shelves. It's a book-lover's dream until the black marketer who ruined Peter's life returns with a grudge. On the run, will Peter find salvation in the Archives, or further ruin?

Written and illustrated by M. K. Perker, (Cairo, Air) one of the most prominent and internationally recognized artists of his native Turkey.
