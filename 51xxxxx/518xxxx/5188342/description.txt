Release Notes:
Metric is a four piece band formed in NYC that has been based at various times in Toronto, Montreal, LA, and London. Their fourth full length studio album 'Fantasies' is a much anticipated follow up to 2005's highly acclaimed 'Live It Out'.

'Fantasies' was written by the band in a farmhouse outside Seattle, and by frontwoman Emily Haines in exile in Argentina. The album was recorded at guitarist Jimmy Shaw's own Giant Studio in Toronto and mixed at Electric Lady in NYC by Grammy winner John O'Mahony (Coldplay, The Strokes). A densely textured modern mix of psychedlia, electro and rock, this album s dream like quality stays true to the band s aesthetic while venturing into more accessible musical territory. On standout track ''Gimme Sympathy'', when sharp-tongued Haines invokes the age-old existential dilemma - ''Who would you rather be: The Beatles or The Rolling Stones'' - it's because she already knows her answer: neither.
