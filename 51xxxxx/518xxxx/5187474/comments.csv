[V],thethingy,2010-01-09T18:18Z,"mrwilson07, download this;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5172727

then mount or burn the iso (mounting is simpler) to install word, you can also open .iso files with winrar."
,TechWizard86,2010-01-12T23:28Z,2.6MB/s download...very fast. Will check out and see how it runs.
,chicken-,2010-01-30T21:35Z,"Upon loading Word, I never was asked to activate the product.  When I go into ""More Commands"" and then Resources, it has the option to activate, but it says it's already activated...

[V],thethingy,2010-02-16T18:28Z,"right click the virtual drive and select unmount, you can delete the iso if you want, if you need it again you can get it in 5 minutes from here"

Asked me about MS update, I clicked no...and its good. Never anything about auth by phone at all. Just what Ive said, and it works. Should I be worried that it went easier than instructions said? Oh and yes I had internet disabled while I installed and activated it."

,Derragon,2010-10-05T16:34Z,"@Kaloda
What processor you are using is not what matters when it comes to actual applications. The Core i3 will run Microsoft Word 2007 perfectly fine; make sure you downloaded the torrent correctly and read all the instructions to ensure proper installation.

@Drusky0007
Looks like a file corruption error, or a missing file. Best solution would be to re-download the torrent to ensure that all the files are there, and are not missing/corrupt."

1. Downloaded the torrent for word and the torrent for poweriso.

2. Got poweriso working and put the iso file for word into it.

3. The only thing that I know to do on poweriso is mount an iso to a drive so I mounted it to a free drive and opened it up from my computer.

4. Completed the setup and entered the 25 key code.

What do I do now? when I right click and go to open on the iso when it is mounted I just get a load of folders called ""Admin"", ""Catalogue"",""Office.en-us"" and so on.

,7deri,2012-01-19T05:03Z,I hope this works on Windows 7 64-bit.
[T],nlx_78,2012-01-19T13:36Z,"Works great on Windows 7 (64 bit)

I unplugged the cable between modem and PC. Mounted the ISO, installed and used serial as mentioned in description:
QCH43-6G3GH-HG9J7-TCWXB-2W3Q8

It installed fine, plugged in the cable again and tested it. It's registered. No need to call some number as in description. 

Thanks Thethingy!"

,cojon,2012-05-12T04:09Z,"Thanks again thethingy, your work and dedication are at the very top. 

Installed per instructions, not a hitch--as always!  I have never missed installing on the first attempt and have picked up 34 of your finest offerings.  

As an intelligent disabled person, mental stimulation is a necessity. Your efforts have provided much. I cannot afford to purchase, and sincerely appreciate what you do. 

To those who insult Thethingie when an install goes bad . . . 

Please be kind and realize that there is a high probability that difficulties are emanating from faulty synaptic transmissions on your end.   Consider both your postsynaptic potentials and signaling cascades. It could also be memory failure.

Of course, following the instructions carefully, exactly as written--step--by--step, slowly and accurately also helps.          "
