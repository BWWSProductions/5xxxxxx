It's hard enough for your average person to get a date with all the anxieties we have in our modern world. For Jack, it's even worse. Where he lives, superheroes are a common sight, flying through the air and showing off their outrageous muscles in skintight outfits. In comparison, a regular guy must seem really boring and puny. Imagine his surprise when the cute girl on the subway agrees to go out with him! But as a reporter for a major superpowers magazine, is Nora really as unimpressed by the flying heroes as she professes? And how would she react if she knew the amazing secret of Jack's cat?

Written and illustrated by Andi Watson.
