This is a Bob Marley and the Wailers compilation album called Revolution Experience and is a singles collection from 1970-71. Has a lot of his original recordings of older tracks. Great album for any Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer or Lee Scratch Perry fans out there. 

The versions featured here find Marley and band midway between their '60s incarnation as an Impressions- and Temptations-influenced vocal group and their '70s emergence as international ambassadors of Rastafarianism
