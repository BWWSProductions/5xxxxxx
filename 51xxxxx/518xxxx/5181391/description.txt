Swedish Jazz.
Jan Allan, Rune Gustafsson and Georg Riedel started out playing in the 50's. Early on, it was a matter of course for each of them to find his own distinctive voice. For Almost four decades, now, they have continually perfected their means of expression, and, as you can hear for yourself, they are true masters of their art.
