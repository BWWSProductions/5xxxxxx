All: Come on, somebody should make a working version with lots of details, informations how to set up the game, without any bugs or crashes.

,raviraj87,2009-12-11T17:31Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). I have ""Left 4 Dead 2 - Razor1911"". But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!!"
,travisisbored09,2010-01-29T05:27Z,hey does this reali work because i hope it does
,masterjedimike,2010-02-02T05:31Z,"@raviraj87:

I know with Vista, you can right-click the program and select ""compatibility"" and you choose a lesser version of Windows like Vista (if you're using 7) and it should work."
,Whythiswontwork,2010-11-13T09:41Z,"Why my version says: ""steam is not running""? i have windows 7 64bit    pls help"
,Whythiswontwork,2010-11-13T10:07Z,it tells me that steamemulator 001 is not working...any tips?
,mr357magnum,2011-04-03T15:06Z,"If you get an error saying ""MODE NOT SUPPORTED"" because your monitor or TV does not support the Games Default Resolution, then here is the fix:

All you have to do is, go to your shortcut on the desktop, right click go to properties. There should be text ""Target"" and next to it a line of coding like this ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" 

Change ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2.exe"" -w 1024 -h 768 or what ever your Monitor or TV Supports.

That should force it to start up with those dimensions. Also if you wanna skip the video in the beginning, type -novid after -h 768
