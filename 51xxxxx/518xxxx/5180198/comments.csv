,Nickotak,2009-11-28T01:43Z,"I dont get it. To all of you who say the quality is crap, well here is a thing for you: Newsflash guys! It's been recorded with a cam! What do you expect? If you want to see the movie with decent quality, then wait until the DVD comes out or until there is a DVD rip on TpB. Or do as I did, go out with your friends (If you have any that is) and watch the movie at the cinema. Sure it costs you a little but it's way more fun to do that than watching it here yourself.

And ""Inglorius_basterd"", please dont act like a 12 year old child when you write a comment. You're an embarrassment to all torrent downloaders. And that says something...

All in all. In my opinion the quality and the Audio is good for being a cam tape. Worth watching if you absolutely have to see the movie now.    Thx for the upload secret_myth! =)"

as for the movie I didn't like it. I found the acting very bland (according to the previous movie and the trailer to this one)
If uve seen the trailer, when edward leaves bella in the forest he talks to her as if he were thinking:""God damn it I've had with saving your ass all the time. Now Go to hell and leave me alone!!!!!""

If the food is cold, they whine, if they cant get a hardon they whine, if their girlfriend leave them they whine, if the get sacked from work cause they cant get their fat lame ass in on time, well guess what, they whine.

And if some dude up a movie, game, music whatever thats not up to par well they sure hell whine about that to.

And many of us wonder why mankind is going straight to hell, maybe cause most of you can't seem to be content with what you have or what you getting even if it's free!

try saying thank you instead of fuck you, and maybe then you'll realize that things will be easier in life.

It's like a flick of a switch

Thank you - ON or open a door
Fuck you - OFF - shuttin the fuckin door

,hentooth,2009-12-26T20:38Z,"Quality as expected for a copy of it's type, but why MP4? I had to convert it so my family could watch it on the Divx player on the TV, and the movie just suddenly ends...

Thinking it may be down to my conversion to divx I checked the end on the original, and it does just ""stop"""

,xpunzx,2010-01-04T00:08Z,"Pretty decent quality overall - it seemed to cut out a little early on mine? Don't want to spoil the movie for anybody, but edward asks bella a question and then it cut out - so didnt really see her response or the movie wrap up? 

Not a big deal to me, ive read the books - but could be annoying?"
