I like vista more than windows 7. Mainly because there are less compatibility problems. Especially because I got a bluetooth to usb adapter about 3 weeks ago, I tried installing it to 7, and the computer crashed in no more than 2 minutes. I installed it to Vista, and it had no problems at all."

Hopefully this one will work, huh? It may be because I am helping someone with their Toshiba Qosmio, and these are really old, (garbage) computers and nothing is going to work? Thanks for the up, though, I will give this a shot and seed it if it works."
