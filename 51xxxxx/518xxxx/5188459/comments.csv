,Einrik,2011-09-28T19:14Z,"How is it possible to be worst than Bush but having a donkey level brain ? BTW, U.S peoples are very good at electing U.S. global company's dollars puppets for presidency, than keeping complaining that government doesn't focus on their actual needs... Very weird. Kennedy was your last true independant president. You're on the run to be finished by your own egocentric and greedy peoples... Still, you don't want to see. No better blindman than the one who do not want to see then. No better deafman than the one who do not want to hear. 
Do not complain, when you are the ones letting your country to loot the world... Somedays you will face the bill."
,lattari,2012-06-29T20:06Z,"Yes. Americans love their illusions. Normally I don't feel I'm in any place making comments on how people live their lives, but with them the problem is they inflict such a staggering amount of pain and loss to other people. Its hard not to become emotional when you see that a nation as a collective travels around the world bombing people and toppling governments, murdering supposed threats and at the same time project the ugliest image of them selves, as ignorant and fanatical people who cry foul and injustice when they get hit but at the same time so no regard what so ever to people in other countries. Influential people with strong values in humanity there seem to be portrayed as weak and not desirable as leaders because they don't protect america. I'm done watching their films because it makes me only bitter. How can millions be so ognoratn and impressionabloe? In what fantasy land to they live in? What is that they think is worth 'defending' that it justifies a massive army on a non-sstop world true? It often seems their hypocrasy is the only thing theri defending."
