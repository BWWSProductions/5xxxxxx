,JS0884,2009-12-22T18:24Z,"Just as a note to the creator - I've been playing most of these games and they work fine. However, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis has a bug. I got pretty far into Atlantis, and every time I tried to fix this robot, the game would either freeze or Indy would disappear. I ended up having to finish the game with an invisible Indiana Jones... which is very hard if you've ever played the end.

I don't know if there is a way to fix that but it was definitely not good. Could be worse but it really scared me, I thought I wasn't going to be able to finish."
