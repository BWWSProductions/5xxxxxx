,qner,2010-01-15T06:04Z,"I started the movie when I was about 50% and I saw the beginning of ""sin city"" is this a kind of joke or what?"
,qner,2010-01-15T17:48Z,"sorry about my previous comment; I have finished the download, now I see it's house of flying daggers, but I cannot find any reasonable explanation to the start of sin city, I don't even have it in my computer.

By the way, Nice quality, thanks kriss_kringle"
,Liensrii,2011-03-08T23:52Z,LIAR!  There are no subtitles!  Unless I did something wrong or unless there's something I have to do by myself but there are no subtitles.  
,Liensrii,2011-03-08T23:57Z,I'm going to try it one more time.  Maybe something went wrong cause everyone else seems to love this torrent.  I just for the life of me can't figure out why I'm not getting subtitles.  
,Liensrii,2011-03-09T07:49Z,now it has subtitles but there're not english.
