This is the popular game SWAT 4 prepacked with the mod HSME 3.Reloaded

Installation instructions:
1. Copy all 3 .exe's into program files.
2. Run them one at a time, order shouldnt matter.
3. After extractions completed, direct your file broswer into the directories in this order:

>S.W.A.T. 4
   >H.S.M.E v3.R
      >
 

Then right click on "Launch H.S.M.E v3.0 Reloaded.bat" and click send to desktop(create shortcut)

To run the game double click the new link on your desktop
(may come with a few accounts or profiles already in the game, my bad, just delete em)


I didnt build any of the mods inside this file, i merely compiled them.

The download is 1GB however when extracted its roughly 3GB.

Me and my friends run this over Hamachi for some tactical fun, and it works for all of us. (windows 7 x32 and x64)

IF THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR YOU, PLEASE DO NOT HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE.
As i've said, it works for us, all of us... If it doesnt work for you, tough luck.

This file doesn't have any viruses, its the direct exe's me and my friends ran to install our swat games. If your virus scanner goes cracky its probably just heuristics going insane.


If you want to play SWAT 4 WITH us then add me on xfire (latentsarcomatoid) and we will see about timezones and whatnot :P  (we're all GMT)


Next Expected Upload as of 29th NOV: Custom VB Voice Chat Application (to go with the game)


Thanks and peace from LtSarco
