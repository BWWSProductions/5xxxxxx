If you want to make it right, episodes 5x24 and 5x26 sould be canged over."

Also, I just don't understand how anyone can diss this show which is top family entertainment, old-fashioned and good-natured, with great chemistry between the actors (regardless of what was happening in real life)..."

,Untrapuka,2009-12-14T22:11Z,"kivilcik, thanks for the ""thank you"" comment :)
I'm happy to know that all my work was not in vain.

destry71, Doogie Howser is quite easy to find. Just type ""Doogie Howser torrent download"" in Google searh line and I'm sure you'll find what you need."
