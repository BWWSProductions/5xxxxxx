,420therock,2009-12-20T06:20Z,"I cannot get itunes to open these files, don't know why, anyone know how I can get it to do so?"
,DumDrumer,2009-12-21T02:32Z,"itunes doesn't play flac files, you need to convert them to wav (using something like winamp) and from wav to mp3 (itunes can do this)."
,disimagery2,2010-01-15T07:00Z,"GET foobar2000- free download and useage!
plays FLAC..."
,bfg666,2010-01-21T21:08Z,"@ 420therock : iTunes is a shitty software anyway, I can't understand why people would use it for anything else than transferring files to their iPods ! For me, good ol' reliable Winamp still rules..."
,Seth01,2010-01-22T19:54Z,Thank you very much for putting up the lossless version.
,konk684,2011-10-25T02:15Z,"Awesome! Thx for sharing a FLAC copy! Best thing out there to play flac files is foobar2000. Winamp a close second.


YOU ROCK!"
