Det bÃ¤sta med Karin och Anders Glenmark is the third album by brother sister group Gemini, released in 2005. Unlike their previous two albums, Det bÃ¤sta med Karin och Anders Glenmark is more of a compilation featuring tracks from their previous two albums with remastered sound along with a few rarities.
One song that caught attention was the previously unreleased "When I Close My Eyes", a song intended for their first album but was subsequently left off as being too similar to the song "Another You, Another Me", a composition already included on the album. Also of note is the inclusion of the Swedish version of "Too Much Love Is Wasted", entitled "Den som sa det var det". This version of the song isn't merely the English version with Swedish lyrics. The Swedish version was produced in a country style and adds a depth that is lacking on the English version.
