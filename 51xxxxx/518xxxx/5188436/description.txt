2009 album from the Latin Hip Hopper.
Pitbull is a Miami rapper who has
been an independent artist and now
signed to a major label. His 2004
debut album M.I.A.M.I. (Money Is A
Major Issue) featured the hit single
Culo and became the biggest selling

self titled debut in 1991. With five
subsequent chart-topping albums and a
multitude of hit singles, including
The Anthem and Krazy, Pitbull
continues to blaze trails and
maintain his status as the 1 Latin
artist on Myspace and beyond.
