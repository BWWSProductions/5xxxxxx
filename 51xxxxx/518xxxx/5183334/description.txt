What is it about? This avoids the turn to social criticism the movie took in its second half. This time it stays an apocalyptic horror movie.

Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original:

We just wanted this movie to stay what it was: a horror movie about a spreading infection and people dealing with it. The soldier scenes implanted to much social criticism and must have been based on â€œDawn of the Deadâ€ (â€they are us, weâ€™re themâ€). These scenes changed the mood and slowed down the pace a lot. Still the second half is more a thriller than a horror movie, but the thrill is not broken by stupid conversations about ethics
