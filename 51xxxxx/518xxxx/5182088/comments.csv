The format of 'D:\Movies\Hardware (1990) 1080p\Hardware aka M.A.R.K.-13 1080p x264 AC3-5.1 and 2.0.mkv' cannot be detected. Have a look at the log for details."
,Danux01,2009-11-28T16:32Z,"@kyza07  : You're the first to comment that it doesn't work, torrent has been going hard for four months. I can only conclude that it is an issue on your end.
  I have VLC v1.0.0 on an old P4 w/WinXPPro, and it seems alright - audio and video tracks are selected correctly - the system isn't really up to 1080p playback, but other than frame stutter, everything seems OK. Plays fine under mplayer and Xine in Linux.
  Your copy of VLC said to look at its log, that'll give you a hint. I don't know where VLC writes its log on your computer."
