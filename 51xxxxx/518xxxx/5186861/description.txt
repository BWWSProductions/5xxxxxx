American fans got a great deal with the Pubic Fruit compilation of EPs in late 1992, but unfortunately it left off this fantastic release from a few months before, pairing a good remix of the Doppelganger track with three excellent new songs that deserved wider attention. The first, "Falling Free," runs with a quick, crisp 4/4 dance beat amidst some fine guitar work from Garcia and higher-than-normal singing from Halliday. Things really kick in with "Mission From God," mixing a haunting mock choir wash with a slow, sprawling wash of feedback and one of Halliday's most seductive, compelling vocals. "Today is Not the Day," meanwhile, takes the moody ambient vibe of Doppelganger's "Sandpit" one step higher, resulting in a surprisingly effective ballad that combines mood and restrained power, not to mention a great final vocal hook. Add in a fine cover from the band's usual design team Flat Earth and Horror Head may well be the band's true lost classic.
