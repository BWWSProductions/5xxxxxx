Hi there..

Please read this whole introduction to the end.

A while ago, I started to upload a version of this word for word movie of the accounts of John in the Bible. And on request, I started to track down a Spanish-subbed version.

I found one, but the subs weren't very good, according to Spanish feedback. So I got me a copy of the original movie, ripped it in the three available subtitles and languages; Spanish, French and English.

I decided that a English subbed version would be great for the hearing-impaired in the English speaking countries.

So this is the result.

This torrent is made only including some of the few open trackers available still, so please help by "Enable DHT" in you torrent-client, as well as "Peer-exchange".
Cause judging by things, the trackers will soon be a thing of the past.. TPB made this step into the next level of doing things.

Honor to the crew of TPB. Salute! Double rations of rum  for them this evening. :-)

In the hope that this movie will show you a Jesus that's neither Catholic, Pentecostal or any other denominational, but rather inter-dimensional, a friend to trust and the Saviour of mankind. That's the Jesus of the Bible I'm referring to. The Man from Nazareth,

Love from Verifire.
