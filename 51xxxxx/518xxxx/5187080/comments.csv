,LuHash,2009-11-29T18:15Z,Hi Brick;) could you please tell me which prog are you using to convert movies to avchd?? I'm wondering what gave you this fine quality:)
[T],bricktophd,2009-11-29T18:22Z,I use Ripbot264. its a freeware.
,LuHash,2009-11-29T19:22Z,"Supperb, i'll try it;) One more question - what output size sould i enter to have 3,99GB rip?"

Thanks A Lot bricktop.

BTW, May Be I Am Wrong But Have You Ever  Mentioned Somewhere That You Have Band Of Brothers Series?
Then I Will Wait For Yours. :)

And, I Like Your Releases Very Much Because Of Perfect HD Video And Specially
AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1CH Surround (640kbs).
I Don't Know But Most Uploaders Are Switching To AAC Audio Now, 
That Is Nowhere Near AC3 DD.
What Is The Reason For Switching To AAC ?
I Hope You Will Stick To AC3 DD. 

Last Question,

If A Film Has 2.35:1 AR
And It Is Encoded To 1920X108,
Will It Be Strached?
If Not, Why?

before you transfer to ur ext. hard drive make sure you have it formated in FAT32 so the PS3 will recognize it."
