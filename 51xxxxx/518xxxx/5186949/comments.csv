Thks"
,naturally_magical,2009-12-30T00:14Z,Thank you. This is fantastic :)
,lasaldude,2010-01-03T12:48Z,When i unrared it the iso's were rar's. so i unrared all to a game folder. then in that game folder- unrar the two CD rars in that same folder. when you do the second iso. just say yes to all replacing. then go to the crack folder and copy the simcity4.exe and paste it in the apps folder and replace the original. then click on that new simcity.exe file to play the game. don't install or worry about registering. that game needs the setting tweak for display and currency needs changed to American USD.

,Steelserie,2010-05-24T22:07Z,"Hello Games4theworld

I've got a small problem regarding this game. The installation went fine and I did every step as it is explained in the 'installation guide', but when I try to copy and paste the crack to the folder where it should be I get an error message saying: 'The file you're trying to move is already in use. Please make sure you close everything ..' 

I made sure nothing containing the file is opened except the folder where it should be. Do you have any idea (or does anyone else) on how to solve this problem?

Thanks in advance."

Could you tell me step 6 in more detail? ('6. Now, the open '# crack' file in the. Rare. "")
Please help me! Thanks in advance."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-29T10:32Z,"Hi,


@Steelserie

Try to restart your PC and then do it again.



@ShutDown.93

Open the '# Crack' folder, which can be found in the .rar file you've Downloaded, and copy + paste (or drag & drop) the .exe file in there to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\SimCity 4 Deluxe   and REPLACE it with the existing one. 
(When a popup appears, telling you the file already exists, just click 'Replace')"

,la_cross37,2010-08-22T01:03Z,"this works 100% with windows 7 ultimate 64 bit.

for those who get the (The file you're trying to replace is already in use"" error, just go to task manager and check you processes for something like ""simcity 4"", when you find it, click it and then click on ""end process"".

And for some reason simcity 4 didn't install in the Electronic Arts folder, I found it in program files/Maxis

great torrent

Just one question: why does it say in step 8 ""Install the game""? It's already installed, so why install it again? did you mean ""play the game""?"

[T],Games4theworld,2010-09-04T11:35Z,"Hello,

@la_cross37

I just checked the Installation Guide and you're right. It's a mistake in the Installation Guide, it shouldn't be there at all. (The step 8)


@la_cross37

Our free Mounting Guide can be found on www.games4theworld under ""All our Downloads"" or send an empty e-mail to Games4theworld@hotmail.com and start the subject with ""Requesting Mounting Guide"".


@capturetwist

I'm not sure about that, but you can try to burn the two .ISO's on two DVD's and then insert them in your PC. (Or use our CD/DVD Service; see www.games4theworld.org) And then apply the Crack using a Program like Crossover."

[T],Games4theworld,2010-10-19T15:53Z,"Hello,

@littlebacon2

If you don't know how to Mount, please read our free Mounting Guide on www.games4theworld.org under ""All our Downloads"".
Mount BOTH images, before starting the Installation and see if it works then.


@bluesstrat

Have you tried to drag & drop the crack to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps   and choose ""Replace"" on the pop-up that appears?

Good point. ;-)"

[T],Games4theworld,2011-02-15T19:40Z,"Hello,

 Just look for a patch on Google and download the patch for the version you want.
After patching the game, just be sure that you find a new, working and updated NoCD crack for the version that you patched to. Just copy the NoCD crack to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps  and choose ""Replace"" on the pop-up that appears, telling you the file already exists.
The game should work fine now."

I have been having good fun with this game!"
[T],Games4theworld,2011-04-02T00:11Z,"Hello,

@tcat00

Since you stated that you got the original game from ÂŽ Games4theworld Downloads, it's OK.
You do not have a lot of downloaders though, since it's your first torrent. 
You could also just upload a guide/torrent with only the patch and a new crack in it. That way, people can download this (faster) torrent and then apply your ""Update"" torrent.

You can't. You have to make a different DVD for each .ISO.

,HarderStronger,2012-06-07T20:39Z,"Sim City 4 on Windows 7 64bit
Follow these steps:

1) Install Sim City 4. When the game starts on completion, exit.

2) (Optional) Install Sim City 4 Rush Hour. When the game starts on completion, again exit.

3) Install the Sim City 4 Rush Hour Update from this URL: http://simcity.ea.com/update/index_update.php

4) You may use a custom resolution by adding this to the shortcut:
""CProgram Files (x86)MaxisSimCity 4AppsSimCity 4.exe"" -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32
Adjust as needed.

5) Right click the shortcut again, and go to compatibility Check Run As Administrator, Disable Visual Themes, Run in Compatibility Mode for XP Service Pack 2

6) CLOSE ALL OTHER PROGRAMS NOTHING ELSE CAN BE RUNNING ON THE TASK BAR

7) Run the program. It may drop you back to the desktop at this point, or if it is still going hit CTRL-ALT-DEL go to TASK MANAGER then Processes. Find the Sim City Process. Right Click the process and select ""Set Affinity..."" Uncheck all but one processor, so that one processor only can run the Sim City process.

8) Click back into the game on the taskbar. During the loading sequence (""EA, Challenge Everything"") it may continue to drop you to the desktop... don't worry... once the game actually starts (Region View) you'll be able to play just fine!"
