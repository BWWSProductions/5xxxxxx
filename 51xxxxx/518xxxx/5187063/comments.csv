Click on the red ffdshow icon in the taskbar and tick the Sharpen tickbox. Sharpen options are:
xsharpen, unsharp mask, msharpen, asharp"
,Spartanus,2009-11-29T20:00Z,What happened to Mininova?
,BasilBrush,2009-11-29T22:18Z,"Mininova now only allow ""Content Distribution"" torrents from copyright holders. There was a court case similar to Piratebay.

If I increase the frame size to 1024x576 and increase the bitrate to 1800Kbps and also use LSFMod() in the AVS script that should give about as good a quality as you could hope for.
That would give a quality factor of 0.12bpp (similar to the 700Kbps 640x368 torrents).
I'll try it out on the Biathlon race next Wednesday night."
,BasilBrush,2009-11-29T22:26Z,The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation are using similar size MP4 torrents with a frame size of 1024x576. They're using a very high bitrate of 2800Kbps.
,BasilBrush,2009-11-29T23:18Z,I've just spotted that the torrent is private - sorry about that. DHT and Peer exchange won't work in private mode. I'll make sure it's off in future.
,ahtramos,2009-11-30T03:40Z,"How can I download the videos from this torrent, since this is private?"
,Spartanus,2009-11-30T07:04Z,"My Internet connection speed will increase from 1 Mbit/sec to 4 Mbit/sec as of tomorrow, December 1. So, 1024x576, I am not afraid of you! :)"

Yes, you can download the videos no problem but your dependant on getting a connection to one of the trackers listed in the torrent. If the trackers are down or your DNS provider has blocked access to the trackers then you don't have much chance.

With the private flag un-ticked access to other users running the same torrent is possible without a tracker as long as you enable DHT. In this situation all you need is the magnet link and a BT client that supports magnet links."

If your exchange has LLU support you should be able to go faster although it might cost a bit more."
,BasilBrush,2009-12-01T14:25Z,"I've done some test encodes using x264 CAVLC 1024x576 at 1800Kbps using LSFMod().
Picture quality is better than the mpeg2 but encode time will be about 5 or 6 hours for 2 hours of video. I need a Core-i7."
,Spartanus,2009-12-01T21:58Z,I'm going to buy myself a Core i5 soon. :)

You rock! I love watching ski-ing but I don't get Eurosport. You are the only way I get to watch! Will you be uploading Alpine & Ski-Jumping events as well as Biathlon & Cross-Country?"
,BasilBrush,2009-12-02T20:58Z,I haven't got the time to cover it all. I did the first Giant Slalom of the season. Last year I did some Luge and Bobsleigh but people prefer the cross country. Biathlon is slightly less popular than the cross country. The Winter Olympics is coming up in February plus the Tour de Ski so that'll keep me busy.
