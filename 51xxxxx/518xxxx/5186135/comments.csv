,Admiral_Xyes,2009-12-04T23:40Z,Would someone be so kind as to seed the finished version?  I will seed for a while if they do
,skutieos,2009-12-05T01:27Z,what do you mean by finished version?
,Admiral_Xyes,2009-12-05T06:28Z,"Sorry, I meant there were no seeders.  Just some people who were around 70%."
,skutieos,2009-12-05T06:56Z,"I'm sorry. I can only seed sometimes, my brother complains that I use up to much bandwidth whenever I do it, so I can't do it while he's around. At some point I will seed."

,Nybbles,2011-04-30T10:36Z,"Vinroke, The english version of the second season, actually hasn't been finished yet. It's only a couple episodes in."
,eviction0,2011-06-29T06:15Z,"Nybbles: 

Forgive me if I have made a mistake, but wasn't the DVD release of the English dub back in September of 2010? The asosbrigade website lists it as in stock, as does Amazon (which gives the release date)."
,Dorstlesser,2012-03-08T14:54Z,"Episode order is on wikipedia.

Season two was aired in 2011 in Japan, so not 2010. "
