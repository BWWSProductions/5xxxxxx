,cosmicdancer,2009-11-28T16:25Z,this is my first upload so please comment much as possible. how come it says no seeds when i have been seeding for the last 24 hrs?
,sussumopop,2009-12-09T21:55Z,How can someone post comments if its impossible to get this file because there are no seeds? Seed it again!!!
,jdr235,2009-12-10T11:10Z,"I'd love to have this movie! Please seed! It is DLing, but very slowly, and it will get deleted before it finishes if it stays at zero seeds!"
,jdr235,2009-12-10T11:15Z,"Also, uploading it as an .iso is a bit silly. Most torrents are uploaded as avi files. I'm fine with it this way because I have conversion software, but many people will be turned off by it. "
