I've never found the solution of it."
,warpwar12,2010-05-12T14:24Z,maybe we can find out what ip(s) it phones home to and block them in our hosts file?
,warpwar12,2010-05-12T15:32Z,"Seems like it is working, add ""127.0.0.1 www.zabkat.com"" to your hosts file & restart your computer.

I also added it's ip (82.165.115.192) to my peerblock block lists as well.

also, xplorer2 seems to delete your settings when it has its little ""not paid for"" shit-fit, so save & export that when you get it to your liking."
