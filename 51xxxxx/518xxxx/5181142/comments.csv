,billy1989,2010-01-02T00:00Z,"ok im playin it on my r4 ds card. the game works great and is patched in english. but not all of it is english. ramdom people on da roads and most trainers are still japanese but who wants 2 no wat they say anyways. playin da game for 25 hours and only freeze 1 time. runs very smooth, it is the best 1 yet in english. thanks uploader for this its amazin.

now does any1 no wen 100% english will b released. i no the game is released in march but expectin someone to translate b4 den or a leaked english version. if any1 knows let me no.

@Mehw dats just ur emulator or ur computer cant run it. try a different emulator or increase the settings in ur current 1.

@lpsssmdlj u need a homebrew card to run it on ur ds (hand held) u can buy them on ebay or amazon for 20 pounds or so. really handy."
