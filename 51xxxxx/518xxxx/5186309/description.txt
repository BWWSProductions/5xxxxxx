
Description

The complete second series of the iconic â€œBush Tucker Manâ€ available for the first time on DVD.

Major Les Hiddens (aka the Bush Tucker Man) became a household name in the 1990s when his television show hit Australian screens.

In a battered army truck, Hiddens sought out and recorded the different types of bush food and medicines used by Aboriginal people for thousands of years. Having been a bush survival expert for the Australian Army, Hiddens travelled vast tracts of uninhabited Australia from Cape York to the Kimberley, taking viewers on an entertaining and informative journey across rugged and inhospitable terrain.

Revisit the television show that inspired the imagination and became a treasured part of Australian culture with the laconic and likeable Bush Tucker Man.
