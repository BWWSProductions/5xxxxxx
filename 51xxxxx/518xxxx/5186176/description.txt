Zeitgeist: Addendum premiered at the 5th Annual Artivist Film Festival in Los Angeles, California on October 2, 2008, winning their highest award. It was released free online on October 4, 2008. Director Peter Joseph stated: "The failure of our world to resolve the issues of war, poverty, and corruption, rests within a gross ignorance about what guides human behavior to begin with. It addresses the true source of the instability in our society, while offering the only fundamental, long-term solution."

Hi-Quality torrent - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4341233/Chemtrail_film__Don_t_Talk_About_the_Weather_

Blurb from DVD:
"Ever wondered why the sky is overcast nearly every day, why people are coughing and getting sick, and why everything on the news is suddenly a crisis? Don't Talk About the Weather chronicles a grass-roots investigation into chemtrails, analyzing the different and contradictory official explanations, as well as uncovering official documents that prove chemtrails are not only real, but are
a WEAPONS SYSTEM. It also examines media involvement,
including subliminals and counter-intelligence, and links the subject to an all-encompassing political agenda. There should be something new here for anyone who sticks with it, as each section takes a different perspective. Information is presented to provoke intelligent and peaceful debate."

"On Sunday, 17 December 1995, viewers in U.K. saw an hour-long T V. program which, at long last, puts across the clear message that "free energy" is on the way.In the opening stages Arthur C. Clarke explained how there were four stages in the way scientists react to the development of anything of a revolutionary nature. "Free energy" was now working its way through these four stages of reaction, which were: a: "It's nonsense,"b: "It is not important,"c: "I always said it was a good idea," andd: "I thought of it first."
