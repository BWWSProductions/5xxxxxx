Pin ups of the late 1980s, A-Ha were a teen dream.
Their style relied onthe quality of their vocal harmonies backed by a 
wash of electro drums and perky synths. 

Headlines & Deadlines features their greatest hits, such as "Take On Me" 
and "The Sun Always Shines on TV" plus some of their lesser-known work as
they steadily lost their appeal over the 1990s. 

Near in spirit to supergroup Abba, A-Ha in their day appeared less 
manufactured than rivals Bros or any of the other generic boy bands, which 
is why their songs have remained timeless classics all these years later.

This compilation spans their first four albums (from 1985 to 1991) and 
contains their early classics, 'Take On Me', 'Sun Always Shines on TV' and
'Hunting High and Low'. 'I've Been Losing You', 'Blood that Moves the Body', 
'Manhattan Skyline', 'The Living Daylights', 'Train of Thought' and their 
cover of 'Crying in the Rain' are wonderful tunes as well, and A-ha are 
well known for their looser pop music like 'Touchy!'and 'You Are the One'. 

Their later material like 'I Call Your Name', 'Early Morning' and 'Move to 
Memphis' is brilliantly diverse, and a sign that they were not a band who 
were typecast by a particular sound.
