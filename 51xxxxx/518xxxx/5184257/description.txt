Pop Tops were a vocal/instrumental band formed in 1967 in Madrid, Spain and consisting of Jose Lipiani, Alberto Vega, Ignacio Perez, Julian Luis Angulo, Enrique Gomez, Ray Gomez plus lead singer Phil Trim (born January 5, 1940, Trinidad and Tobago).

Their sound was a blend of baroque classical-styled pop with the soulful vocals of Trim. Major influences included Procol Harum and The Left Banke.

They are best known for their 1971 hit "Mammy Blue" , referring to a son's poignant song addressed to his departed mother about his childhood memories and life in general, sometimes spelled "Mommy Blue" or "Mammy Blue", or misspelled as "Mummy Blue", which was a Top 10 hit throughout much of Europe, Japan, and Canada (#42), and a minor Billboard Hot 100 chart hit in the United States as well.
