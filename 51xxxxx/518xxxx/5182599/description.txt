Paragon Backup & Recovery 10 Suite
Our newest complex disaster recovery and system migration solution combines two methods for securing your system and data â€“ the time proved Drive Backupâ„¢ method with rich functionality and excellent flexibility, and the new System Backupâ„¢ method based on simplicity and minimal user participation.
The suite also builds a bullet-proof shield against any disaster with the brand new Virtualization Managerâ„¢ which successfully migrates Windows based systems to different hardware platforms (P2P) and virtual systems (P2V).
