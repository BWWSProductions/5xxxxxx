,_mungki_,2010-08-03T19:53Z,"This release features the majority of the film in its standard 2.39:1 aspect ratio - the same as the standard and widely-available Blu-ray release of the film - but offers select scenes in a ""full screen"" 1.78:1 (16:9) aspect. Though it takes more than 50 minutes to arrive at the first IMAX sequence, the wait is well worth it. "
