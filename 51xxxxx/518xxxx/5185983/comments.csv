Call it weird but I enjoy getting blown and watching dumb asses."
,*Wizard*,2009-11-29T04:20Z,"Why are you archiving the file?

Please simply torrent the actual file itself, there is no need for archiving.

Thank you."
,*Wizard*,2009-11-29T04:22Z,"Nevermind, I'll download eztv's torrent."
[V],TvTeam,2009-11-29T06:01Z,"*Wizard*, it will take only 1-2 minute to unrar them.

it's better to download rar files. safe and clean."
,33rdegree,2009-11-29T07:26Z,"quite the contrary, .rar files can be misleading...
they can also contain hidden trojans, viruses & such.
lol, that's why I'm a Mac & not PC! i can DL & unrar whatever I want & my HD won't get fired no matter what, LMFAO!!"
