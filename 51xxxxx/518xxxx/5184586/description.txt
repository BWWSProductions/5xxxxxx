This is my first share here, hate it or love it.
It's Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, with Dutch Subtitles.
Please enjoy the share, and remember to seed as well!

If you want to burn it on a dvd, download this (free) tool from: http://www.trustfm.net/divx/SoftwareAvi2Dvd.html and simply convert the file.

Support can be asked for here.

If you think I could've done better, please post your suggestion, so I'll know what to watch out for next time =D






Small edit: If people want a portable version as well, please request it, and I will.
