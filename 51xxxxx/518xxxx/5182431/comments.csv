,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-28T10:38Z,"@ barcabollen: open the CD2(or DVD2) folder or .iso or whatever it is in this torrent... in there will be a crack(in a folder called 'skidrow' apparently), it will be one or two files, you need to cut/copy these files and then paste them in the folder you just installed the game to. the root folder(you can find this folder easy because it will contain the same files as the ones you just copied)... then paste them in that same folder - it will ask you if you want to overwrite(cuz the files already exist), say yes then start the game.


@ PirateXD: make sure you're playing the game from the crack and not the original launcher."

@suisenbenjo
WRONG DOUCHBAG!! As soon as you download even 1 kb of data you are seeding that 1 kb back up u fuck tard. You do NOT have to download a whole file to seed it. For example, I've uploaded 23.7 Gigs of this fucking torrent (thats over twice the whole thing) yet ive only downloaded 73%. How is that possible? Cuz your fucking stupid thats how. Ive obviously uploaded that 73% to several different people. If torrents worked the way you think they do, they simply wouldn't work at all because it would require there to be a 100% seed/leech ratio which is not possible.

@PPL who are seeding-> YOUR FUCKING STUPID!! The less you seed the slower your own download rate will be you dumshits! How? Well if theirs 1 seeder and 2 leechers, that 1 seeder will be spliting his bandwidth amoughst the two leechers for the same peice of data, where as if both those leechers where to seed, then the leechers could also download from eachother and save time.

BUT NO!!!! YOUR ALL TO FUCKING STUPID TO GET IT!!

I know most of you dipshits wont be able to understand this no matter how much it is explained. So for once just fucking do what your told and fucking seed dipshit."
,jlw08,2009-12-08T20:49Z,"oops, thats @PPL who are NOT seeding.

Your fucking stupid too. You forgot to account for the fact that everyones upload rate is UNKNOWN. 30% of the seeders could be uploading on a 56K modem for all you know... on the flip side you have no idea what the download rate is of each of the leechers.

Hence, it is 100% IMPOSSIBLE to get even a rough estimate of your download rate by compairing the seeds/leechers.

It sucks that 70% or more of pirate bay users dont know that leechers hurts their own down speed. 

I wanna go back to the good ol days of Kazza P2P software that measures and restricts your DL rate if your not uploading.

Or better yet i want a Torrent programs that automaticly disconnects peers that are downloading from me but not uploading the same Torrent to somebody else. "

,DocEvil,2009-12-09T01:58Z,"@jlw08
I undestand your pain. People just do not get how seeding works. I think a lot more people need to use a program that helps with this. uTorrent has a wizzard that sets it all up and configures each user with a seed cap. It helps a LOT and makes the swarm healthier.

@hacker46644
Please, SHUT THE FUCK UP! You cannot predict, calculate, devine, or in any other way figure out what speed you will be downloading a torrent at before you join the swarm. No ammount of math will generate a real answer. There are no minimums or maximums that can be applied to everybody.
There are people on here that probably have their seed cap set to 1 KBp/s. They're DICKS, but they're there. And then there are people who are on comcast internet and once they have fully downloaded the file, comcast's SandVine technology severs them from the swarm and makes seeding impossible.
Hundreds of reasons cause a torrent to suck balls, and to tell people that there is a special math trick you can do to figure it all out is a fucking dick move.

This particular version of the download has a VERY shitty swarm. I was only able to get 60 KBp/s on it.
But this one, however:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5156714/Call.of.Duty.Modern.Warfare.2.PROPER-SKIDROW.iso
(identical upload)

I am currently, as I type, getting over 550 KBp/s and uploading at 150.

How does your math do there, buddy? The one where I'm getting half a meg has less than 1000 people participating (seeding OR leeching)!"

Sorry, dipshit, but you're wrong. Uploading does not = seeding. That's why it doesn't say seeding until the file's done, because seeding is ONLY uploading, not uploading while also downloading(leeching).

Don't touch the crack until after the installation finishes. 

Mount DVD1 and start the installation. Later in the installation it will ask you for DVD2. Unmount DVD1 then mount DVD2 and continue the installation. After the installation finishes you will see the icons on the desktop. Find the installation directory folder(right click one of the icons>properties>open file location) and leave it open. Browse the DVD2 files for the cracks. Copy the cracks from DVD2 to the installation directory folder. It will ask you if you want to replace them old files; click yes or ok. Close the folders and click on the ""Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 SP"" icon. It should start up. If it doesn't then you have done something wrong.

NOTE: Multiplayer/Online Play WILL NOT WORK. We are waiting on a working multiplayer crack.

Here's an image from before the first mission starts. It should say the name, time, etc.

Once you dl and open the torrent, you will see the dvd1 and 2 folders as you stated. Now open dvd1 and look for the .zip folder, open this and mount the .iso image. I use Virtual CloneDrive for this (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4012644/Virtual_Clone_drive). 

Once the .iso is mounted follow the installation just as if it was a disc. When it asks for disc 2, unmount dvd1 and mount dvd2 and hit continue. 

Once installation is complete, go back to dvd2 folder where the .iso is located and open that with winzip or whatever you use. Open the SKIDROW folder and copy iw4sp.exe and iw4mp.exe and paste them in to the /Activision/Modern Warfare 2/ folder. Overwrite the two .exe files already there. 

Should be all set from there with no problems for Single player. Haven't gotten Multi to work yet."

,b00tsy42,2010-01-22T19:54Z,"Thnx for the torrent. Crack works fine and will seed for some days.

Glad i didnt buy this over priced game. In MW2 there is even less strategy and tactics involved then MW1. All SP missions are the same ...follow the AI team mates from A to B and kill anything that moves. + all pre-scripted enemy spawning if you cross an invisible line...so lame. And wtf, there is no dev console in this version either. It is a game with a lot of explicit and sadistic violence (like killing all civillians in an airport) packed in a kiddy game fo console teens. The game looks nice, other then that it's a total joke."

1. Unpack release

the "".rar"" files- right click on the first rar and press extact, you need winrar download it from here -> rarlab.com

2. Mount image or burn it
--
you need daemon tools, you can download it from here http://www.disk-tools.com/download/daemon, install it and then right click on the little lightning icon beside the clock and press mount then browse to the "".iso"" file.

3. Install
--
after you mounted it it will come up like you putted a real cd in the driver. just press install.

4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on DVD2 to your
installation directory and overwrite
--
i think you understand this.

5. Play the game"

Any1 have an update for the crack?"
,Whale_Lord,2010-02-13T17:38Z,"I Got this game free and, I got multiplayer :D 
THIS IS HOW:

Step 1: Buy at EB Games
Step 2: Install and activate CD Key on steam
Step 3: Return game and get full refund (EB Games has 7 day trial)
Step 4: Play! 

Since COD MW2 is on steam, you don't need the disk to play, and you don't need the disk for an update, so you can play online 24/7 ;) 

Extention Steps:
If You Want To Have A Backup Just:

Step 1: After installment, download ""magicISO""
Step 2: Make a image of both disks
Step 3: Make sure to write th CD Key on a text file.

I put my backup on my external Hardrive, it saves space on my pc ;)

If you need anymore information just give me your email and I'll assist you best I can (lol I'm no pedo, I just don't want spam)

LAST THING: Don't give the game to yor friend, because only one of you can play the game at the same time."

anti virus software mostly gives a false sense of protection. by the time your mighty anti virus software detected it, it has already copied it self into several key system files. good luck deleting that... you will have to reinstall your OS.

btw the trojan does not activate right after install...it activates after x amount of runs of the SP .exe

I am not some 12 year old... I know what I am talking about.

lawl, I am aware of false positives, this  was not a false positive. Infact with every keystroke  i did the keygrabber activated and the same with every mouse click in my browser. The trojan activated after like 20 runs of the SP, before that the the crack showed as clean. 

In other words, the trojan stays dorment till an x amount of runs and then activates and copies it self to other files.

The fact that your scan does not list the trojan does not mean its not there.

The game runs normally, I did not expect the trojan either. I always scan the torrents before install and it showed as clean...until x amount of runs."

Fact is that I am stuck @ 86.07 Megabites away from 100% and that is seems that i wasted 11.02 Gigabytes (that is 32% of the amount that i can download monthly) + some uploadGigs.

Any ideas what might happened here?
Any solutions?"

Stop saying these kind of things when you have no idea what he's talking about!

He quoted wrecktum, as you see here: 
"" wrecktum at 2010-05-07 17:45 CET:
1. You people are having crap downloading speed because either your internet sucks, or because there aren't that many people awake at 4AM, so stop being retards and begging for people to seed who can't even hear you.

2. Multiplayer does not work, get over it, there is no such game that you can play for free online. For over a decade you have had to buy a legit CD key and nothing has changed, wake up.

There is a way to do this without any burning program.
Extract a rar file from both of the disks, extract them to one map (for example: D:\My Documents\Downloads\CODMW2).
Then, you extract the iso file in that same location, so that you have all the .bin files in one map. Then just run the setup and you won't have to insert any disks"

if you want to play it online you can use steam(search on google)
don't buy the games with steam just start the game on steam, and you can play it online for free

Nederlands:
om te beginnen moet je (met winrar) de rar bestanden uitpakken, voor elke dvd zijn het er een stuk of zeventig maar je hoeft voor elke dvd maar een uit te pakken want het is eigenlijk maar een rar bestand (voor elke dvd) dan moet je power iso of deamon tools (of een ander programma dat images aan een speler kan koppelen) dan ga je in het programma dat je gebruikt naar ''koppel image aan speler"" (of iets dat daar op lijkt) dan zoek je dvd 1 op en kiest die, als je dat gedaan hebt en de instalatie start niet vanzelf dan moet je naar ''deze computer'' gaan, (of ''computer'' bij windows 7) en je kiest de speler waaraan het image bestand is gekoppeld, dan klik je op setup of autorun en de installatie begint, als hij zecht dat je dvd 2 erinmoet doen  doe je koppel image aan speler, en kies je dvd 2, ga verder met de installatie enals de installatie voorbij is koppel je dvd1 weer aan de speler en je kunt beginnen.

als je het online wilt spelen dan moet je steam gebruiken(zoek maar op met google)
je moet niet de spellen kopen met stam maar alleen starten in steam, en je kan het online spelen"

Works like a charm so far. This is how I installed the game:

1) I unpacked the map called MW1 and MW2. 
2) I mounted the Iso file with daemon tools that I got from the map MW1.
3) I ran the setup t it took a few minutes.
4) After reaching 50 percent It asked for the second cd, so I unmounted the first iso file and mounted the second iso file in map MW2.
5) When the setup was done, I clicked on a map called Skidrow and copied all the things and paste it in where I installed the game.
6) Then I clicked on the shortcut and I began playing without any problem.

Hope this work for those how can´t get the game to work. 

I DONT FIND THAT SKIDROW MAP EVERYTHING I SEE IS 31 FILES TO UNPACK PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAMES AND 38 FILES THAT ARE PROBABLY MAPS BUT THERE NAMES ARE sr-mw2b.r30 and it go like this till mw2b.r67 so WHAT TO DO???"

Even took off the OC profiles on my PC to make sure wasn't me.  Have been able to run setup and ignore missing files but only able to play game for a few levels.

Install Notes:

1. Unpack release
2. Mount image or burn it
3. Install
4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on DVD2 to your
installation directory and overwrite
5. Play the game


Right you need to extract the first rar file by right clicking on it then click extract hire do that for dvd 1 n dvd 2.

Next mount dvd 1 iso to deamon tools then open the disk and click on the install or setup file follow instructions.

Then lastly copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on DVD2 to your
installation directory and overwrite.

Then play :) Hope that helps you."

Then if installed, you have to go to DVD1 and then extract one winrar packet and then if its done you will find another WinRAR packet (ISO file)
Then you go to daemon tools and then ADD IMAGE left above and then find the DVD1 Directory and then click on the ISO file
Your install will begin and then you will get a message that you have to put your MW2 Disc or something like that.
Then you go to DVD2 And extract the Winrar pack and inside you will find your 3 Install files to resume your installation and a SKIDROW map (map with your crack)
Further you have to check by yourself

1) Download PowerISO, install, restart and then goto disk 1 folder find the file and right click. Goto powerISO-mount-drive 1.

2) Goto My Computer, there should be a new drive there like K:\ or something. Go into it and it should be MW2 disk 1. Run the set up. When it prompts you to insert disk 2, unmount this file find disk 2 and mount it. Continue installation.

3) Copy all the contents from the ""crack"" folder (if there is 1...im doing this off memory) and place them in your Modern warfare 2 folder. Over write existing files.

4) Dont complain there is no multiplayer. It is possible, but since you are stupid enough to have to read this tutorial on how to mount a disk, i CBFed.

5) Have fun with this single player game. 4-5 hours, but quite entertaining."

Install was easy. Unrared and extracted DVD 1 & 2 to a new folder on my desktop. Then mounted the image from DVD 1 with daemon tools lite. Then when prompted mounted DVD 2 and completed the installation. Then copied and replaced the cracked files located in the SKIDROW folder with those in the installation location folder C-\program files\activison\call of duty etc etc. Deleted the extracated folder/from my desktop. Thats is!! Now just double click on the game icon on the desktop and now I can play the best game ever!

For those peasants who are still having issues installing and have read every page of comments on here and still you cannot install then perhaps you really should go out and buy the game.

then double clicked the ""iw4sp"" that I just moved out into the folder and it worked perfectly fine :)

How to use Deamon Tools: After opening the program you go add file, then select dvd 1 and then  click mount. Do the same with dvd 2. I haven't downloaded the torrent yet because ive had net-problems, but this is based on earlier experience with Deamon Tools.

,coolsday,2010-12-23T16:58Z,what does unpack release mean?
,casey12141,2010-12-24T20:52Z,"@coolsday- Unpacking the release means taking the files you download from the torrent and making them in the format that is used to play the game. So when you see DVD1 and DVD2 in the spot where you downloaded this torrent (probably in downloads), unpack it by downloading winrar, opening it, then extract the data. When you click the extract data, just browse to DVD1 and click on the first file in the folder. Do the same for DVD2.

For mounting the data, download Daemontools lite for free. There will be a little icon down on the bottom right hand side of the screen on the taskbar, with a blue lightning bolt. Left click it then select Device 0:(F:) no media. Then click on the .iso file that you unpacked earlier, it should be in DVD1 and it will trick the computer into thinking that you have the mw2 disk :) Then, when the game asks for disk 2, just mount the second .iso file in DVD2.


But I have a problem too-after the level where you drive the boat off the waterfall, the game stops working. Sounds like mr.jagger had the same problem-everything worked fine up until now. My computer is just fine, I run everything maxed easy. Is it because I have windows 7 32-bit?"

If you`re having any problems installing the game, just follow the steps below and everything will be perfect!:)

So,

Step 1 â€“ Download the latest version of â€œdeamon toolsâ€. You can download it from here ïƒ  http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads

Step 2 â€“ Download the game :)

Step 3 â€“ Open â€œDVD1â€ folder and find a â€œsr-mw2a.rarâ€ file. Right click on it and choose â€œExtract to sr-mw2a\â€. When it`s done, a new folder will appear in the same directory as a â€œsr-mw2aâ€ with just one file in it. Enter a folder and then drag a file into your â€œdeamontoolsâ€ program interface. When you have finished, the installation interface will appear right in front of you.

Step 4 â€“ Continue the installation. It`s a simple, standard procedure. Just click the ""NEXT"" button a few times :) When you're finished, please, stand by and let the progress bar reach the 80%. When it`s done, the installiation will ask you for second DVD disk.

Step 5 â€“ Open â€œDVD2â€ folder. Find a â€œsr-mw2b.rarâ€ file. Right click on it and choose â€œExtract to sr-mw2b\â€. When it`s done, a new folder will appear in the same directory as a â€œsr-mw2bâ€ with just one file in it. Then, you need to go back to installation interface and click the â€œBROWSEâ€ button. Specify the location of the next disk. Just find the â€œsr-mw2bâ€ folder. Enter it and double click on â€œsr-mw2bâ€  file. Installation will continue. Be patient and wait for a while.

Step 5 â€“ Installation is finished! Now, enter the â€œDVD2â€ folder and drag the â€œsr-mw2bâ€ file into your â€œdeamontoolsâ€ program interface again. Then, go to â€œMy computerâ€ and double click on â€œCALL OF DUTYâ€ icon. In there you will see several folders and files. Double click on â€œSKIDROWâ€ folder.

Also thanks medveckij

You can't burn this too a CD as it is too big 

all you have to do is unrar the files with win rar or daemon tools which are both free 

once the files are un rar'd they turn into a ISO file which then has to be unrar'd and then you can start to run setup =)

Go under computer, then open Disk 2.  You will see a folder named SKIDROW.  Open it and copy the contents.  Now go under computer> (C:)>Program files (x86)>Activision>Modern Warefare 2.

I don't know what I have to do to fucking just play the dam thing and it's so complicating because I look everywhere and I jus don't get what to do. The read me says I have to mount the image which I don't know how to and I don't even see an image. I don't know how to do any of this. I jus want to get on the game and play online but this shit is unclear. wtf. Can you plz help me? Inside the main folder CoD, there is a DVD1 and a DVD2. In DVD1 there is 1 rar folder and 82 unknown files. In the rar folder there is another fucking rar folder. In that folder there is 1 autorun.inf text document that doesn't help, then there is a mw2.ico icon, then there are 5 setup media bin files, and lastly there is a Setup.exe app which I click and it asks me to insert a fucking disk. Sorry about my language it's just that all of this is really starting to piss me off. I thought once I download this I can just play mw2 right away on it. This is all so complicated and unclear to me at least and it annoys me that uploaders expect you to just know what to do with these. Anyway I don't want to spend my time wining like this but as I said, I really don't even know where to get this information from. May anyone explain to me exactly what to do step by step so I can get these files to actually run as I game so that I can actually get on mw2 and play it? plz

,Universe_X,2011-09-03T22:23Z,"Infact after reading a few of these comments, I came across this:

Step to step guide:
1* Unzip both the packages in DVD1 and DVD2. 
2* Mount both images using a program like Daemon Tools.
3* Use the Setup from DVD1.
4* Wait.
5* Some more.
6* When asked for DVD2, give the right path to DVD2 and wait some more.
7* When finished, do not run the game.
8* Go to the SKIDROW map inside DVD2. Copy the singleplayer .exe to the map by default located in your Program Files under Activision, Modern Warfare 2.
9* Enjoy.

I'm done step one which is unziping both packages in DVD1 and 2. That's not hard to understand but steps 2 to 9 I don't get.
"" Mount both images using a program like Daemon Tools. ""
I got Daemon Tools, but what images and how do i mount it? ya, stuff like this i don't understand. any help here? I hope to get a response to this withing 2-3 weeks because i only got a 29 days trial for it and even if i didn't, by then, I will most likely have moved on or maybe i may not even get a response from some1 else, that's fine too. now i'm just texting to myself."

It's quite easy to install i suppose, i dont use daemon tools i use magicdisc (it's free no crappy trials).With magicdisc u go to your explorer bar on the bottom right and you will see the magicdisc icon (a hand holding a cd) you right click it and go to virtual cd/dvd-rom.Use one with no media (if you just installed it should be the first one) then you leave the mouse over the no media and it should appear another box and you press mount then you will have to browse your call of duty Iso,cd whatever one you understand better you open it and the autorun box will appear.That should do it any questions Mp me or even extremezone i suppose"

No shit MP doesnt work THIS IS A PIRATED GAME!!! In order to get MP to work you need to DL the alterIW multiplayer crack torrent here at TPB and follow the instructions...

For those who dont understand how/where to extract the crack on disk 2...open the folder, you will see a bunch of files..Find the RAR file, open that. Mount the disk 2 ISO and instead of clicking setup or whatever, click view contents on disk, then open the SKIDROW folder and copy EVERYTHING there and paste it into Activision/MW2 and overwrite anything...

It is ALOT easier than you people make it...Anyone who says to check the torrent because it is not working for you and many others, it is not the torrent, ITS YOU.

Hope SOMEONE gets it..."

UPDATE 26/05/12 - for MULTIPLAYER 0NL!N3

Once you've downloaded and installed the mw2 go ahead and go to (fourdeltaone. Net) and click on download

Then click the setup and locate your mw2 directory and install. Before you play online you must register at fourdeltaone."

Every time I go out of the game, I lose any progress I have made and start at the beginning again, at the bridge. The save points are in the folder but just do not show up in the mission select or when you click resume game. any ideas please?? thanks so much"
,markdewet,2012-06-07T10:03Z,"Hi all,
I do hope someone can assist me. as per my title, I have played as far as Favela, I can see the save point favela.svg in my players folder, but when I go to the game after exiting out and click on resume, I start at the first mission of the game again. I have checked and I do not see any entry in my config.cfg for the save point like there is in Black Ops and my .cfg file is definitely not read-only. Can anyone perhaps advise what is going on here and how I can get my save points back into the game?

Many Thanks,
Mark"
