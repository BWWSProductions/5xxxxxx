,DevoidOfTruth,2009-11-30T09:00Z,"This is to the fellow members that request new release movies to Holyroses:

THERE IS NO NEED TO REQUEST NEW RELEASES! 

I cant remember a time where HR hasnt uploaded a new release within 1-2 days of its availability, So no need to ask.

If you havent already noticed, HR doesnt (atleast not anymore) upload Screeners,Cams,Workprints,R5's etc. HR only deals with high quality Blueray rips and dvd rips, Therefore once those are made available HR will provide us asap.

HR thank you for your time and effort!"
,chuac,2009-11-30T09:35Z,"yeah DevoidOfTruth,

Keep going HR!"
