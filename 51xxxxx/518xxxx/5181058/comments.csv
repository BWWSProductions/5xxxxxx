,halftome,2010-01-16T11:42Z,"guys come one this is like one of the most awesome programs on the market. And every time a crack comes out, it works for a short while than it gets blocked. I've been searching for a working crack for months now. Can't somebody take the time to ask one of the crackers to do this program. So many people will be thankful. Anyway thanks for this release, back when it worked it was awesome. :D"
