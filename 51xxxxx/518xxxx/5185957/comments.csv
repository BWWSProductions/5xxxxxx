Do you, or anyone, have some early 80s Aussie albums like The Sports - Sondra (1981) and The Reels - Quasimodo's Dream (1981).
Thanks in advance. God bless."

,JettBlack9,2009-12-01T01:43Z,"in the 80s John Byrne created a Superman villian who could teleport any weapon into his hand when he wanted it...I think you can do that with vinyl records...they just appear in your hand when your asked about them....Amazing.
Thanks"
,rtrifunov,2009-12-01T02:16Z,"80z, I've seen your prompt answer to my requests. I appreciate your efforts so very much, you're amazing. Cheers."
,fizdude,2009-12-01T16:38Z,"80zforever, you do fantastic work thanks a lot!  Here's a challenge for you ...  I'm tempted to say ""I bet you've never heard of them"" but judging from your extensive collection I'm guessing you've seen 'em all.

Canadian Band: Bob's Your Uncle
1986 	Bob's Your Uncle
1990 	Tale of Two Legs
1993 	Cages"
[V],80zforever,2009-12-01T23:55Z,"fizdude, Bob's Your Uncle was part of the local punk/wave bands in Vancouver. Since I am from Vancouver too, I know them pretty well. The lead singer Sook-Yin was kind of active in the 90s. If I am remembering correctly she released one CD. Now I think I have their 1986 EP but need to double check."
,fizdude,2009-12-02T03:14Z,"I knew you'd be on the case!  Thanks for your quick response.  It would be great to hear anything from them again.  My searches have turned up nada.  I have their albums on tape (haha) in a box in Winnipeg or Wimperpeg as we call it during frosty season.  Currently living in Seoul, Korea - your collections have been keeping us sane and we thank you for that."
,pinoy321,2009-12-02T07:06Z,"thank you thank you thank you!!!!!

,brianscottmatthew,2009-12-05T07:50Z,"Hey!
I just wanted to thank you for all your hard work bringing us all these unfindable gems and of course as you for one more!
I've been searching for ""Listen to the City"" by Spoons from 1984. I can't find it anywhere after like almost a year of searching nearly daily!
If you have this one could you please upload it?
:)"
,resonator,2009-12-10T15:10Z,"Have been looking for years after the Play - Red Movies album, and finally I can now retire my old and noisy cassette copy. Thank you for your endless source of quality 80s music uploads."
,resonator,2009-12-13T19:03Z,"If you like the Vanity Fair album checkout Lustans Lakejer albums here on the bay, which is the band's name in Sweden, but with swedish lyrics then. (Search text =lustans only, for some reason lustans lakejer didn't return any hits.)"
,standardpolaroid,2010-10-04T21:07Z,"created an account just to tell you that you are awesome :)
