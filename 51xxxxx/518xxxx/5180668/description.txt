Hanlon's Choice 

Hanlon tries to treat a traditional Hmong woman with a cancerous lesion that might have metastasized to her lungs. But she and her family are skeptical of Western medicine, and don't believe in surgery. Dr. Peters does his level best to make Jeremy miserable in their department, and annoy Phillip. Alberghetti's patient is a 22-year-old who has a very serious heart infection of unknown origins, and refuses to remove his multiple body piercings. Jack feels left out when he isn't asked to write an article for Chicago Hope's new Web site.
