Yes, I bought this CD. Im a big TP fan. I've even been to his New Years parties. But this is just too good of a collection to not pass along. Good music deserves to be shared and appreciated. Enjoy!"

[V],smbdownload,2009-12-01T05:57Z,I have been having trouble with my torrents starting the past week - I had one take over 24 hours before it would start seeding even though I had hundreds of leechers waiting to grab and I was on and ready to go ??? - hope to grab this one - thanks to the uploader - what is the bitrate of the tracks ?
[T],Robin86,2009-12-02T14:16Z,"Seems your having some trouble with the seeding. That's okay, it can be a little tricky at first.  Tell you what, up it to dropbox (or similar service) and send me the link, then I'll seed for you so everyone can have chance to enjoy some great rock n' roll. :p
