,KILLGRANNY,2009-11-28T21:21Z,"And Man said unto God 'I create you Lord, for I am fearful and superstitious.'"
[T],IndianChristian,2009-11-28T21:54Z,"And Man said unto God 'henceforth I will no longer believe in you for I want to live like the animal from which (I believe) I evolved'.

From that time onwards, live-in-relationships,, pre-marital sex (fornication), adultery, rapes and abortion have increased a hundredfold. 

God created man Holy and in his image. Man kicked out God from his life and since then in behavior has become like the savage apes from which he claims ancestry. "

,flghtlss,2009-12-17T18:59Z,THANK YOU INDIANCHRISTIAN! GREAT DOWNLOAD!
,ash_96bc,2010-12-05T06:23Z,"Thanks for all these IndianChristian. Any chance of you sharing 'The King is Born' and/or 'The Animated Nativity'? My kids want to see ""baby Jesus"" cartoons but I can't really find anything other than the Hanna Barbara Nativity cartoon on youtube (blah). Just trying to combat the commercial side of Christmas (Santa, Rudolph, Frosty, etc). Thanks again."
,ash_96bc,2010-12-05T06:28Z,There's also 'the story of christmas'. Not sure if you have any of these. They're impossible to find or buy it seems.

Or are Christians stealing from animation artists too? :)

are all present in whatever religion. It is the male gene's animal instincts coming through.

I still think it's the work of men that wrote those books (in whatever religion). All the rules always seem to have women in second place!
