         â–ˆ  -To-Use,  Highest-Quality Tool  for Correcting  Pitch  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  Hailed as a "holy  grail of recording," by  Recording  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  magazine  (and  adopted  worldwide  as  the   largest  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  -selling  audio  plug-in  of  all  time),   Auto-Tune  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  corrects  intonation  problems  in  vocals  or   solo  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  instruments,  in  real  time,  without  distortion or  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  artifacts,  while  preserving all  of  the expressive  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  nuance  of  the  original  performance  -  with audio  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  quality so pristine that the only difference  between  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  what goes in  and what comes  out is the  intonation.  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  All with a user-interface that is a model of clarity,  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  speed and ease-of-use.                                 â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  For  most  common   pitch  problems,  Auto-Tune   5's  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  Automatic Mode instantaneously  detects the pitch  of  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  the input,  identifies the  closest pitch  in a  user  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  -specified scale  (including minor,  major, chromatic  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  and  26  historical   and  microtonal  scales),   and  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  corrects the input pitch to match the scale pitch.  A  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  Retune Speed control lets  you match the retune  rate  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  to virtually any performance style.                    â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  For meticulous tweaking, the Graphical Mode  displays  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  the performance's detected pitch envelope and  allows  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  you to draw in the  desired pitch using a variety  of  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  graphics tools. This mode gives complete control over  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  the correction or modification of the most  elaborate  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  expressive gestures.                                   â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  Auto-Tune  is  used  daily  by  thousands  of   audio  â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  Key new Auto-Tune 5 features include: Improved  pitch  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  detection algorithm: While Auto TuneÃ†s patented pitch  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  detection  technology has  always provided  unmatched  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  speed   and   accuracy,   Auto-Tune   5    introduces  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  improvements  in  performance  with  marginal quality  â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  A sleek new  interface: As Auto-TuneÃ†s  features have  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  proliferated  from  version   to  version,  we   have  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  continually focused on  maintaining its ease  of use.  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  With  Auto-Tune  5,  we  have  undertaken  a complete  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  graphic redesign. The result is both easy on the eyes  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  and logically groups  related controls for  intuitive  â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  function allows you  to set a  fast retune speed  for  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  short notes, while  still allowing natural  variation  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  in held notes, for results that are even more natural  â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  Larger  Pitch  Edit  Display:  As  youÃ†ve  no   doubt  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  noticed, the Pitch Edit  Display is now bigger.  Lots  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  bigger.                                                â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  Sync to  host transport  (host dependent):  For hosts  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  that provide valid time information, Auto-Tune 5 will  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  now maintain  sync with  the host  program. Once  you  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  have tracked audio and created correction curves, you  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  can move around in your track at will. No more having  â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  Full-time correction mode (host dependent):  Whenever  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  Auto-Tune 5 is not specifically tracking audio,  Auto  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  -Tune 5 will be  operating in correction mode.  There  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  is  no longer  any need  to press  a Ã´Correct  PitchÃ¶  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  button. Besides being convenient, that makes possible  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  the following feature:                                 â–ˆ
         â–ˆ                                                         â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  Auto-Tune  Graphical  Mode  operating  on   different  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  tracks simultaneously, even if their windows are  not  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  open. In  previous versions,  since you  had to  have  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  plug-in windows  open to  engage Correct  Pitch mode,  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  only open instances could be active. No longer.        â–ˆ
         â–ˆ                                                         â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  all of the graphical editing features while Auto-Tune  â–ˆ

         â–ˆ  of vibrato in your audio while preserving the contour  â–ˆ
         â–ˆ  of the original vibrato. Moving this control  results  â–ˆ
