J.D. Blackfoot - The Ultimate Prophecy

Formed from the ashes of other local bands in Ohio in 1969, J.D. Blackfoot unleashed this stunning blend of folk, country and hard psychedelia in 1970. Though the band was short-lived, their sole album has gone on to be recognized as an all-time rock classic, featuring searing lead guitar and some of the best drumming ever recorded.
