,Bob_Oblaw,2009-12-11T19:24Z,"""Future dude you have to leech and seed like the rest of us, no re-upping this torrent with you're name plastered all over it, that is strictly forbidden and in violation of the EULA.""

Well isn't THAT the pot calling the kettle black.

What do you think you're doing by uploading this and plastering your name all over it?  Shouldn't it be, ""Brought to you by McPhat!"" or whatever?

Note:  I fucking hate McPhat.  I think they're a bunch of faggots that cover up their shitty painting skills with an overabundance of ""dirt"" and ""grime.""  
It makes me sad to see all of you faggots cumming in your fruit of the looms over this shit.  I'll bet if any one of those kids over at ""McPhat (gayest name ever, btw)"" whipped out their uncircumcised, unwashed flaccid cock you would be all to willing to milk it with your mouths.

Pathetic.  The whole lot of you."
