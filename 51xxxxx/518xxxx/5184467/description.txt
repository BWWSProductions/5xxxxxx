Acquired especially in honor of hitchup's recent up, the liveries to go with. I didn't bother with pack 2 because it is all British Airways, no offense, pack 1 has more variety is all. Be mindful that this is a rip, not an install, so you will have to add the liveries manually. The install requires authentication and we all know what that means.
 There is a text document within titled "PaintInfo.txt". Open the aircraft configuration file titled "aircraft.cfg" using notepad. Take note that each entry is headed with a term in brackets separated by a period followed by a number. [fltsim.#] Each entry must be sequentially numbered starting with "0" 
 After the end of the final entry [fltsim.5], copy paste the text from PaintInfo.txt, then replace the "XX" with sequential numbers (6, 7, 8, etc). Finally copy the texture folders into the FeelThere ERJ145LR v2 folder. Apparently they didn't write any liveries for the ERJ-135LR and ERJ-145XR or perhaps those are in pack 2.
 By the way, McPhat is really taking a beating these days, did anyone else see this coming?

 Ok, that's as simple as I can make it, please seed as usual. Future dude you have to leech and seed like the rest of us, no re-upping this torrent with you're name plastered all over it, that is strictly forbidden and in violation of the EULA.


Once more, not sure why the first flailed...
