                    Sweet Dreams.                            
                    Fantasy drama. Dignitaries from rival kingdoms  
                    descend on Camelot for peace talks, but what  
                    King Alined really wants is war and he'll do  
                    everything in his power to stir up hostilities,  
                    even if it means using magic. Alined's jester  
                    Trickler puts a spell on Arthur to make him  
                    fall madly in love with rival King Olaf's  
                    daughter Vivian. Chaos reigns in the palace and  
                    Camelot is once more poised on the brink of  
                    war. Can Merlin free Arthur's heart before the  
                    prince loses his head in battle?
