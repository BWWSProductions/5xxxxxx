Though if anyone would care to explain why all of a sudden alot of new dvds, r5's and things like this are making my video players like xvid,  k lite, CCCP, and windows media player mess up on the audio and yet windows media center (Windows 7) plays it perfectly would be very helpful. As it is it got me stumped and I am pretty damn good with computers."
