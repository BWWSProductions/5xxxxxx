                    |Realism Patch V2.121 for any OF version|
                     ---------------------------------------






THIS PATCH CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY OPEN FALCON VERSION, REGARDLESS OF ANY PREVIOUS REALISM PATCHES...!
THE "REALISM PATCH V2.0/2.1 OF" IS ALREADY INCLUDED INTO THIS PATCH, SO YOU ONLY NEED TO APPLY THIS ONE OVER "Falcon4" FOLDER



	It comes with small adds and improvements over realism patch V2.0, increasingly closing the edge around the data reference of some missiles,

once again bringing them to a higher level of realism!!!



These modifications are as follows:



-The F/A-22 Raptor has been revised for a low speed "bug" issue, and now it won't tend anymore to pitch wildly up or down upon low flight speeds,
thus fixing the powerloop behaviour as well so it performs very close to the real airplane!



Thank you for chosing the Realism Patch of Open Falcon for a higher level of accuracy and performance...!


Grtz...!
