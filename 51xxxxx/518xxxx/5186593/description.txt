I couldn't find NWOBHM legends "Legend" from Jersey, UK anywhere out on the web, so I decided to give it a shot with my first torrent.

Band and album details can be found at http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=749.

Torrent contains:

Legend - Legend [1981]
Legend - Death In The Nursery [1982]
Legend - Frontline [1983]
Legend - Demo [1983]
Legend - Still Screaming [2003]

The first four where ripped from the Anthology CD and track sorted in original order. Don't forget: If you like it, go buy it......

Oh, and of course seed!!!!!!
