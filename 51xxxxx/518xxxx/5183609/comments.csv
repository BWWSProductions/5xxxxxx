I got this to work with the patches at Lucas Arts, but I have one issue.
When I get to the menus they're all blank. the tool tips beside the mouse icon are blank, the buttons are blank, no text at all.

Also, I can only play the training mission even after I complete it.

Can someone recomend a fix?"
