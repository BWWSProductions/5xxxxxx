The allstars edition with Fabio = Top Chef season 6 episode 11.
even though it DID NOT contain any of the season 6 competitors it still counts as part of the season 6

So THIS file that states Top.Chef.s06e13 SAINTS...is miss labeled!
THIS file is actually episode 12 (Culinary Olympics!) from the 18th of November.

s06e13 is ""Saints"" that aired last night 11/25/09 is and should be officially the latest episode

i dont know where the episodes became jumbled by episode #s but please look into it!

(FOR THOSE DOWNLOADING THIS)
if you already have Culinary Olympics from last week the 18th of November...this is the SAME episode. it is NOT the new ""Saints"" Episode from the 25th of Nov."
,BDLucidBD,2009-11-26T16:58Z,"just to clarify, - episode 13 is the Napa Finale part 1 aka ""saints"" and airs on Dec 2nd (according to Wiki)
where the have to cook on a train.

,jimmyb22,2009-11-27T02:17Z,"BDLUCID:  You started off right by saying that the reunion eppy was #11.  Unfortunately, you forgot that episode 12 was called ""Meat Natalie"".

THIS IS EPISODE 13 if you include the reunion show.

And for the record, ""Saints"" has nothing to do with the title of the show.  It is the name of the group who capped and released the show."
,jimmyb22,2009-11-27T02:19Z,"Oopps.  Episode 12 was called ""Strip around the world"", not Meat Natalie (that was episode 10)"
