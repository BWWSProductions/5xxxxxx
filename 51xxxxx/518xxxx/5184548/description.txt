  Release Description:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Are you looking to eradicate bugs and ensure consistency? SSW Code
   Auditor is a code analysis tool that allows developers to take
   control of your code, ensuring large, complex source code can be
   simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in rules focus on the most popular
   NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms and ASP.NET;
   however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to add
   their own rules to target any language in any text file.
   As a project or company grows, managing code standards throughout
   your team becomes virtually impossible. Consistent code is crucial to
   future development and maintenance. SSW Code Auditor lets you take
   control of your code and automatically review your web apps and projects
   giving you more opportunity to spend time where it really matters.
   Here at SSW, we face the problem of maintaining our standards across
   nearly five thousand web pages, over twenty active projects in both
   Visual Basic (6 and .NET) and C#. There comes a point where a tool to
   check our work is needed, this tool is SSW Code Auditor.
   SSW Code Auditor utilizes the power of Regular Expressions to audit
   your code. This powerful feature permits the user to write their own set
   of rules and have different rules for different projects.
