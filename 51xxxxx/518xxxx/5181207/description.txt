   Use Public PC Desktop to turn your personal computer                    
   into an Internet kiosk or a public access workstation.                  
                                                                           
   It can be setup to completely disable access to files installed on      
   your PC while giving full access to all necessary applications you      
   specify. This way, you create a workstation that can be easily used     
   in any public place, where many people have free access to it, but      
   none of them can damage (whether accidentally or intentionally)         
   vital system's files or clutter your hard disk with garbage.            
   You can selectively enable access to any programs installed             
   on your PC so that not only the web browser, but also any other         
   software you specify, can be run and used.                              
                                                                           
   Public PC Desktop is a complete solution and is ideal for public        
   libraries, Internet cafes, information terminals and in-store           
   kiosks. It is also good for limiting activities of your children        
   on your home PC so that they could have full access to the programs     
   you specify, but have no access to the workstation itself.              
                                                                           
   Public PC Desktop supports multiple security modes providing you        
   with an ability to specify the most acceptable type of access to        
   a locked desktop such as username and password authentication,          
   time-locked code (that allows users to access workstation for           
   a given period of time only) or a combination of both.
