This ZIP file contains two things:

1) An E-Book that gives practical advice on how you can learn a foreign language both quickly and effectively. It's for anyone who reads English (including non-native speakers), and wishes to improve his or her language-learning skills.

2) Some audio files that teach the English phrasal verbs (mainly for those whose native language is Spanish).
