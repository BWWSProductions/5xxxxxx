DESCRIPTION:

Throughout their illustrious rock 'n roll career, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers have used the music video medium as more than just a commercial outlet for selling their music; instead, they have made some great, artistic short films. Seventeen of these are featured, in chronological order, on this great compilation video. Featuring the surreal Alice in Wonderland takeoff "Don't Come Around Here No More," the Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway-starring rise and fall narrative of "Into the Great Wide Open," and finally, the tragic murder story (starring Kim Basinger) of "Mary Jane's Last Dance," PLAYBACK serves as a testament to the quality of both Tom Petty's music and videos.
