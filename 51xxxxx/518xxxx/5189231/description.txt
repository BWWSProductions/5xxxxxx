Painful Cuts 

Geiger is under enormous pressure from the hospital board to make drastic cuts, and because his daughter is facing life threatening surgery. He had operated on her when she was born (with congenital heart defects), but that was before she was his daughter. Now he's insisting on doing the surgery again, even though it's not permitted under hospital policy. Dr. Hanlon performs an appendectomy on an uninsured conjoined twin.
