That's probably why their styles seem so similar.  What software did you use to rip this stuff?  I know it's originally DRM-WMV, been looking for a good ripper which you seem to have (from the shots of your desktop lol)."

,D_Blan,2010-09-26T19:49Z,So hard to find these vids. Thanks
,D_Blan,2010-09-27T04:54Z,"I'm kind of new to this. Is seeding as simple as just keeping the video on your torrent list when it's done downloading? If so, that's what I'm doing. Thanks again!"
