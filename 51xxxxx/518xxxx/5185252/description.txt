The 2nd Mix I ever did. It's all Kniteforce or related stuff. Absolutely everything you'll hear in this mix was downloaded at www.kniteforcerevolution.com!
Respect to Mr. Luna-C for giving away his music for free. Please don't be mad at me.

ENJOY!

P.S.: Back in the days we used to call this "Happy Breakbeats". You'll hear why...
P.P.S.: Anyone remember the "Milk!" club in Mannheim '92/'93?
