Veckatimest is the long-awaited follow-up to Grizzly Bear's critically hailed album, Yellow House. Neoclassical composer Nico Muhly and Beach House singer Victoria Legrand contribute.

There is an unbelievable clarity of sound and vision to Veckatimest: vocals (a duty shared by all band members) are sharper and more complex, arrangements are tighter, production is more venturous and lyrics more affecting. Having opened the creative dialogue at such an early stage, Grizzly Bear was able to realize these 12 songs together as a band, making it their most collaboratively compositional album to date.
