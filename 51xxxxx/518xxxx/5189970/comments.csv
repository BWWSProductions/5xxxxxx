[T],towerelect,2009-12-01T09:25Z,"Nope I am good Sir, where I am working until next year has very limited internet speeds, slower than dial up, so I am good thanks.  I just hope when I return to broadband in March of 2010 all my torrents are still alive!!!!

Any questions about DHT and the future of bit torrent please put here.   I will try get back to you as best I can"
[T],towerelect,2009-12-02T17:28Z,"My Thanks to local VJ 'Sawbones' for helping me seed this and get it out there in records time.   I am switching off the Internet for the last time here and will remain offline until March 2010 at the earliest, so please look after all my torrents until I can get back and seed again.   Thank you to all the good guys and girls out there keeping the music video's alive for now.   Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, Towerelect (AKA Rigmar Radio) will be back seeding DHT/PEX on the Pirate Bay in the new year."
[T],towerelect,2009-12-06T13:58Z,"IF you can afford it, go to Zazeen.com and read up about running a virtual PC on the fibre optic Internet Backbone, then just like this download your torrents will fly with a full T1 assymetrical 20mbits ps connection!

Download 20 - 50 m bits per second
Upload SAME SPEED!"

[T],towerelect,2009-12-24T08:43Z,"OK Gang still seeding at 20Gb T1.   Check out Zazeen,com to see how I did that.   I am off Braodband until March of 2010 but like the Pirate Bay this Torrent lives on!   Don't you just love Technology :)"
