Comic book mini-series based on the hit Emmy and Golden Globe winning FX TV series.  

When a famous TV journalist is murdered, the media spotlight falls on the Barn. Captain Aceveda orders everyone to be on their best behavior - which hampers the style of Vic Mackey and his Strike Team. As with the TV show, interweaving cases affect everyone on the force, with suspenseful and surprising results. 

Written by novelist and award-nominated comic book writer Jeff Mariotte and illustrated by Jean Diaz.
