,PHr0Z3N-W4t3R,2009-12-11T04:39Z,"Make sure you delete the space at the end of the key when you activate it.

Also, the first key is 2500+ days, the second key is 1500+ days, so you may be able to find one with a longer amount of activation."
,Drtnoz,2009-12-17T10:16Z,Fanx man! Awesum!
,yoncenator,2009-12-17T21:06Z,Would feel a lot more comfortable if some people w/ XP would attest to this working fine after more than one day. Thx
,vamprewill,2009-12-17T23:56Z,"yoncenator, i have XP sp3, this downloaded in under 2 minutes and installed even faster. i've used this program in the past, and aside from never having a key, it works just fine."

,Faziri,2010-05-01T17:54Z,"For those wondering, use http://www.avast.com/resend-license.php to change the license keys to a file (like Avast asks you to do)

Avast doesn't have a textbox for the license, you need the file with the link above"
,Faziri,2010-05-01T17:56Z,"No wait, sorry, doesn't work unless you enter a valid emailaddress :/

How the fuck do we use these keys in the Avast that doesn't have any textboxes???"
,Bleutje,2010-05-02T22:45Z,works great OK

,Msiin,2010-05-21T11:16Z,"help please....
where to enter the serial key...i dont see any registration or serial key buttons or any posible space to enter one...."
,Fourbrezio,2010-06-14T08:19Z,"This completely took over my PC. My internet is slower, and it won't allow UL/DL windows on firefox. I do not recommend DL until this is fixed. Any suggestions?"
,doingitwell,2010-06-17T08:07Z,"I'll comment about several things that should help most users. First of all, un-install any Avast program you're using. You'll have to d/l the removal program from the Avast site as the usual methods will not work. After you get rid of any previous versions if needed and install this torrent, use the workstation key, you get the longest activation time. I noticed a lot of users had problem with installing the key, this should help. After you install let the system re-boot without trying to install the key. Once re-booted double click the Avast icon that should be on your desktop, it will fire up and start scanning memory, hit the registration tab and you'll get a splash screen, this is where you enter the key.

Further more, I'm using Vista 64 and I kept getting a red Windows ""X"" shield on my tool bar. Here's the biggest tip, stop fucking around with trying to adjust the settings in the Security tab as it's probably saying Avast is expired or out-dated. Again, ignore it, let your system cook a bit and you'll get a screen to pop up on the lower right hand side saying there is an update version available. Then you need to progress forward with the update and let the shit rock for you. It's worth the trouble/hassle.    "
,doingitwell,2010-06-18T03:15Z,I forgot a very important thing to my above post......thank you very much Ahmed for the U/L. Rock solid!!!

,Alerec,2010-11-25T18:26Z,"Thanks, Worked perfectly, Serials Included also work, Just installed and I have 2350 days left for mine.

For those having problems follow these steps.

1: Run the file in the ""Setup Folder""
2: Reboot computer
3: Right click on the avast icon in your tray.
4: Hit Start Avast! Antivirus

And you should get a prompt to enter your serial.
Open the Serial text file, pick whatever one you want, Copy and past it into the prompt, And then DELETE the space it puts in there, if you do not delete the space it puts, it will fail, Click OK and your good."
