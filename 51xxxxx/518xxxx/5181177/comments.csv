,Niensel,2010-01-25T15:32Z,"Hey seriousmill,
Thank you so much for these torrents of Sonny With a Chance. In my country (Belgium) we do have disney channel, but we get those scary (in my opinion) dubbed versions of the show. 
Are you going to put episode 19 and 20 on line too ? I already found 17, but I'd really to have the complete first season :)

Thanks !
