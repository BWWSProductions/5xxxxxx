,citygal87,2011-05-10T07:18Z,"I like this comic, but I wont buy it to support the makers (blizzard entertainment)

I just fucking bought world of warcraft for 80 bucks (inkl all expansions) so there is no way in hell that I will buy the comic aswell.

Also bought 1 month of play, and have to do it until I quit playing wow, blizzard gets enough fucking money from me! XD"
