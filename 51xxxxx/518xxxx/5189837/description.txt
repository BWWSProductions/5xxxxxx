Boston's Passion Pit is the brainchild of Michael Angelakos, a songwriter's songwriter drawing from a variety of influences, from the classic pop of Randy Newman to the synth work of Giorgio Moroder. The Chunk of Change EP was originally put together as a (belated) Valentine's Day gift to Angelakos' girlfriend and was written and recorded entirely on his own, showcasing Angelakos' signature euphoric and blissfully melancholic sound. Playing as a five piece live, the band has already blown away audiences opening up for Death Cab for Cutie, These New Puritans, and more and won the WFNX/Boston Phoenix Best New Music Poll as Best Local Act of 2008.

Holy shit, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Passion Pit. Far and away my most listened to band of 2008, the creators of the best song to grace these ears in fucking forever (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be Ã¢â‚¬Å“SleepyheadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and the most exciting band to come out of the States in as long as I can remember, Passion Pit are about to fuck shit up for real. The brainchild of frontman/creative force Michael Angelakos, they sound like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve taken the best (read: most euphoric) parts of MGMT, Black Kids and The Go! Team, and on the new material theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re currently working on it sounds like Ratatat are very much in danger of being beaten at their own game. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got some seriously exciting news to announce next week regarding the band, but in the meantime take Ã¢â‚¬Å“SleepyheadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for a spin and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to pick your jaw up the floor. Yeah, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like that.

Give it a week or so and Pitchfork will be shitting themselves.
