Toni Halliday and Dean Garcia return to take out the garbage with this self-released, limited-edition single. Bridging Cuckoo and Come Clean in terms of sound, "Pink Girl with the Blues" is one of Curve's greatest moments, just as pumping and charging as "On the Wheel" or "Coast Is Clear." "Recovery" is a dark, menacing track that ended up becoming an excellent closer on 1998's Come Clean. Though a strong track, one has to wonder why it ended up on the full length while "Pink Girl" didn't. The midtempo, percolating "Black Delilah" sounds like an outtake from Cuckoo, which surprisingly isn't a bad thing.
