,werm_,2009-11-30T08:16Z,"why add tpb tracker to torrents when the tracker no longer exists, i dont understand, this site has gone to shit "
,henry76,2009-11-30T11:25Z,Awsome. Love the show. Thanks :)

,chilkot,2009-11-30T12:56Z,"Site hasn't gone to shit, dumbass, it still works. I'd rather have to us alternate trackers than have the site go down. 
Also, any possibility of subs?"

eztv.it is down at the moment."
,werm_,2009-12-01T00:18Z,"@chilkot what alternate trackers you ignorant twat? do you see any trackers beside tpb added to this particular torrent? also isohunt and torrentzap offer much better variety of torrents and all their trackers return peers, if youre going to post a torrent in here at least have the decency to add in more than a tracker in it."
