Mongowery (former names: 13 Ghosts, Silent Thoughts, Morning Sunset) was formed in 2004 firstly by Denis Mironov and Roman Belov. They were trying to make a complete band with different musicians . Somewhere in 2005 constant rehearsals started to take place with their present drummer Max Sorogin. After that their present lead vocalist Sveta Navrozashvili joined the group. That was the point when Mongowery actually started to exist. Currently the band performs in clubs of Riga and produces new material.
