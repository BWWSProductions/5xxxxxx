,Rheyvan,2009-11-27T18:29Z,"Hi again logros, please ignore my previous comment, a friend had both of the animes I was looking for so I no longer need them."
,logros13,2009-11-27T18:53Z,"oh well i have allready done all the pre-release work on them so il upload them anyway, hopefully someone else will enjoy them. :)

btw its manga not anime. -_-"

I think I never laughed so hard of a manga serie so much as I did with Angel Densetsu.
Both warming and comedic.

Thank you logros13 for uploading this masterpiece.

Very good quality too."
