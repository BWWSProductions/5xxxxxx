Greetings my future fans! :)

After spending a long time lurking att this site i have decided its finaly time for me to start giving something back to the comunity and thus i have decided start sharing with you all my quite extensive manga archive. i will only be upploading completed series and will be striving for quality so dont hesitate tell me in the comments if you find something wrong with any of the manga i uppload (corrupted files missing pages etc, there shouldent be any but since i uppload stuff directly from my archive without cheking it to carefully first and my archive quite large some stuff migt have slipped trough.) allso feel free to request mangas you want me to uppload in the future and il fill them if i have them. now without further delay Angel Densetsu!



oh actualy one smal further delay... nothing i uppload is scanlated by me so i cant do any thing about image/translation quality etc. credits pages and possibly some fan art may be included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i dont add or remove anything from group releases.

Summary (from mangafox)

The story is of Kitano Seiichirou, a very kind and pure-hearted young man, with a horrifying, monstrous face. People being what they are, they think he's a terrifying delinquent, and there are plenty of chance misunderstandings (coupled with Kitano's convenient inability to understand what's happening around him) that propel him into the position of "school guardian", a.k.a. head thug on campus.
