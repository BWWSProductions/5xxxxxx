[Missing]

There are 4 tracks I couldn't find: "Pink Deville", "Riviera Romantique", "Maraschino Moon" and "Spy Guy" all courtesy of Extreme Music.
"Pink Deville" should be written and performed by Paul Rothman and other three composed and performed by Werner Tautz. "Pink Deville" also shows on soundtracks of movie "Strange Wilderness" and series "Stangers With Candy" but there are no published soundtracks for those two as far as I know.




[Extra]

Just some movie stills.
