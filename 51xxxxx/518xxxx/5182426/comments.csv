,Amazingm2,2009-11-27T18:05Z,"Hey,
I have a very easy question. I will get an legal copy of windows ultimate because of my work. But i don't know how long it wil take maybe a week or maybe even a year so I am thinken on an temporarily ''illegal version'. But know i have the question will I be able to do microsoft updates or will microsoft prevent me from doing this or will they even marck my PC as ''illegal''.
Grtz Milan"
,ocyrus70,2009-11-27T18:30Z,yes you can get microsoft updates as long as you use a loader or if you look at some of the other windows 7 torrents some of the posts list keys they have used try one of them..but god knows what will happen when sp1 for 7 comes up but thats next summer so they say by then 7 will be like 20p to buy!!..

,vietidk,2009-11-28T00:33Z,"Do i need to download the files in both the 64 and 32bits folder? Can I just download and burn the en_windows_7_ultimate_x86_dvd_x15-65921.iso from the x86(32 bit) folder? I currently have vista 64bit, can I install this? Can i revert back to Vista through system recovery?"
,pzychoe,2009-11-28T00:55Z,"
   I 1st had a problem burning the image. According to the instructions, u need to 1st extract the files(didn't work for me). I just had to right click on the .iso and click open. My Nero automatically opened and gave me the option to burn the CD - so i burned it. 

   It took me aprox 3hrs and cost me 5 DVD-Rs just to get it right... haha. But it was worth it. Every single app that I usually use on XP is working on 7. I installed the x86 - no problems so far. I haven't tried activating it though. 

  I'll try installing and playing some old school games on this just to be sure. I'll just leave another comment next time.

*do not forget to create a back-up of the this torrent so that u can seed and share."

,mpeters23,2009-12-01T04:27Z,"WARNING:

I have a warning, i am not accusing anyone or saying this DL is embedded with malware/trojan/spyware but here is my experience.

I formatted and installed the 32bit version, after installing Malwarebytes full the Mbam was constantly blocking IPS. I checked these Ips on google and tracert and they were coming from Netherlands, Germany and Russia (coinidentally TPB servers are from Neth and Russia btw) I would get a block every 45 seconds or so.

I formatted and reinstalled the 32 bit version 2 more times, same issue.

I came back here and dled the 64bit version, installed Mbam, same issue again. I cannot explain how i could be getting these without the windows being modified by clever hackers, but that doesn't mean it is true.

Since i am not experience enough, i call upon someone who is skilled at this and try to go deep into this torrent's files and make sure it is safe, this is severe. Sorry to scare you guys. And apologies to extremezone if i have offended you in any way."

why the hell you keep repeating the download?!??!?!?? you were making download traffic got more busy.
it's not about download problem but it was your nti media maker crap problem. every torrent downloader uses hash-check technology which is impossible to be corrupted after 100% of the download or selective download completed.
i suggest you to use this free burning software:
http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-burnwin.htm

or you can use nero or ashampoo if you like to, but they are huge program.
remember to burn at slowest speed as possible to avoid chances of being corrupted.
have fun and good luck all the best to you"

,kostassv,2009-12-02T17:48Z,I have a question about the windows 7 compatibility. I downloaded windows 7 from TPB and this NOD 32 but when I install it it wont update. It will either act as if its updating and just have that little circle go round and round all the time without really doing anything or it will say it could not connect to server...WHAT DO I DO???

,Jackson.Pa,2009-12-03T20:39Z,"THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THIS DOWNLOAD BUT DONT HAVE ANY DISCS, ITS A REALLY EASY METHOD, AND WORKS PERFECTLY.

- Download the file (make sure you have winrar, if not download it from*)

* http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5069577/WinRAR_v3.90_Final___KeyReg_By_ChattChitto

- Right click the windows 7 .iso file and then open with WinRAR, this shows the contents of the disc.

- You can just run the setup.exe file from winrar but if you want it in a file then just create a folder and extract it all into that folder

- There will be a bunch of files and at the very bottom there should be a setup.exe

- Click on the setup.exe this should begin your windows 7 Ultimate setup.

- Go through all of the setup, and when you get to the Activation part and it asks you for a serial key, just leave it blank and click next.

- After it has finished downloading windows 7 will be up and running, however not activated.

- Download this file

Spic, btw I meant to say only do a upgrade if your doing it from Windows Vista to 7.

You can't do a direct upgrade from XP to 7 so you'd have to do a custom install and it will keep all your files in the windows.old folder.

,Latiino,2009-12-06T03:07Z,"first u said ""dont upgrade, its not as reliable"", well thats a lie

and now ur saying ""only do a upgrade if your doing it from Windows Vista to 7""

WTF?! u can only upgrade from vista, most of us know that. So how on earth did u mean to tell us to upgrade  when u first told us not to do it.

dude seriously stop spreading BS and get ur facts right before u open ur mouth.

------------------------------------------------

Oh btw noobies, yes this is the full version, this torrent also contains both versions of windows 7,  ""32bit (also called x86) and 64bit"", u will only need to download one of them, if u have 4GB RAM or more go with the x64, if u have 3GB or less stay with x86

Also remember 
vista 32bit (or x86) ---> to windows 7 32bit = upgradeable 
vista 64bit -------------> to windows 7 64bit = upgradeable 
vista 32bit -------------> to windows 7 64bit = not upgradeable, u will need to do a clean install.

and stop asking for cd keys, u dont need any, just leave it blank and press ""Next"" when u are asked for it.

to activate windows 7 which is very easy to do use this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5140761/Windows_7_RTM_Activator

Thats all u need to do.

When burning the ISO to a dvd, make sure you burn it at the slowest speed (everyone should know this tho).

,Boxer_Dog_2002,2009-12-06T21:11Z,"hey ankit71 if ya another computer anywhere you need to download the iso then use power iso to burn the iso, if ya aint got a dvd drive and ya have got a pen drive then do the following,

Step 1: Format the Drive
The steps here are to use the command line to format the disk properly using the diskpart utility. [Be warned: this will erase everything on your drive. Be careful.]

1. Plug in your USB Flash Drive
2. Open a command prompt as administrator (Right click on Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt and select run as administrator?
3. Find the drive number of your USB Drive by typing the following into the Command Prompt window:
diskpart
list disk
The number of your USB drive will listed. You?l need this for the next step. I'll assume that the USB flash drive is disk 1.
4. Format the drive by typing the next instructions into the same window. Replace the number ??with the number of your disk below.
select disk 1
clean
create partition primary
select partition 1
active
format fs=NTFS quick
assign
exit
When that is done you'll have a formatted USB flash drive ready to be made bootable.

Step 2: Make the Drive Bootable
Next we'll use the bootsect utility that comes on the Vista or Windows 7 disk to make the flash drive bootable. In the same command window that you were using in Step 1:

1. Insert your Windows Vista / 7 DVD into your drive.
2. Change directory to the DVD's boot directory where bootsect lives:
d:
cd d:\boot
3. Use bootsect to set the USB as a bootable NTFS drive prepared for a Vista/7 image. I'll assuming that your USB flash drive has been labeled disk G:\ by the computer:
bootsect /nt60 g:
4. You can now close the command prompt window, we're done here.

Step 3: Copy the installation DVD to the USB drive
The easiest way is to use Windows explorer to copy all of the files on your DVD on to the formatted flash drive. After you're copied all of the files the disk you are ready to go.

Step 4: Set your BIOS to boot from USB
This is where you're on your own since every computer is different. Most BIOS allow you to hit a key at boot and select a boot option.

hope this  helps if ya got any questions dont hesitate to ask me"
,crimsonlung,2009-12-06T21:21Z,"Ankit71:

Boxer just gave you a bunch of bullshit, it sounds like hes never booted from dos before in his life, so ignore everything he told you.

All you have to do is burn the ISO you want (32 bit or 64 bit version) to a DVD, then, stick the DVD in your drive, reboot your computer, and make sure to boot from CD.

There is usually a boot option on your computer, usually you press f12 or Esc just look around for it.  If there is no boot startup option, then just set your CD drive as the first boot device in BIOS.   Google that up to learn how to do that.

Its as simple as that, Windows 7 (as well as many previous version of windows) give you the ability to format your hard drive to whatever format is needed for windows 7.

Let me know if you need more help after that.

,TrailM1x,2009-12-07T15:01Z,"OMG OMG GUYS SERIOUSLY

Jackson.Pa's method is the easiest way.

1.Open the torrent with WinRar
2.Click Setup
3.Choose the windows you want 32 or 64
4.It will either upgrade from Vista if you want or you can choose a custom install. 
5.When it asks for a Product key don't fill it in, just hit next.
6.Windows 7 will start up but wont be activated.
7.Down load http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5188318/Windows_7_Activator_RemoveWAT_v2.1_by_Hazar
8.Run that file, what it does is removes the trial from windows 7 but keeps it as a genuine install and you will continue recieving updates as well. 
9.The other method is just using the loaders provided which still work as well.

,Boxer_Dog_2002,2009-12-07T22:55Z,ok well have ya got power iso? try mounting it if ya aint got power iso just download it as a trial and then mount it it should reconise the iso wen you restart ur pc it will do the same job as opening it up in win rar
,TrailM1x,2009-12-07T23:01Z,"Download Magic ISO, right click on the file and click mount image with magicdisk, and you can run the set up from there."
,dknight10,2009-12-07T23:11Z,"Alright i just got power iso and opened the file in there.  Then i tried to run the setup.exe and did it directly it says and it says there is an error.  Should i be extracting to a temp folder first (the other option other than installing directly)?  Im doing that now and its going to be about 5 minutes before its done. 

Do you think it could be a bad file?  Maybe i should try downloading the file again?"
,Boxer_Dog_2002,2009-12-07T23:51Z,yea well you need to open the iso in power iso then go to virtual drive and make sure you have 1 drive open then click mount drive then find the iso in ur pc and then it should basically get mounted and u should be able to go to my computer and it should be there right click it and click install or run hope this helps
,dknight10,2009-12-08T00:42Z,"alright i got it mounted i think and then got it installed but then ran into some problems...

When it started up my resolution was messed up, it would only let me go to like 1024X800 or something.  

Then i tried to activate it and it said it was done and had to restart and now my computer wont start...  It tries to boot up but gets to the first screen (the dell screen not to windows yet) and keeps shutting off over and over again."

Okay, this is not an upgrade, technically it?s a complete OS, meaning, its not lite, half-assed or bad. It is a full version. Since Bill gates is a greedy slimy nerd he decided that his new OS would be as smart as him. You have to be above sub-par to beat the Gates and this man practically invented copyright in the 21st century. You can seriously expect you to push a button and magically have Windows 7 fully working like that.

I will list some usual dumbfuck mistakes which most illiterate dumb people tend to do when thinking installing an OS is just ?installing the shiiit maaan?. 

It requires more of you than the average user and considering how much help MS built into their latest release, given that even Vista made us all look like sobbing retards, hoping we would understand all the stupid cunnyfucking ?messages? constantly telling us in childish language what just went wrong. So once we?ve established that, we all know Bill Gates thinks were all retarded. Which some of you may be, but this fact should give you a pointer to where the OS is angled. Windows 7 is basically a top of the line, self aware almost automated OS, in that it does much of what XP never did (without your interaction) and does much of what Vista failed to do or did bad. 
First off, here some basic info, for all of you.

1.	This is not a VISTA upgrade, nor does it have anything to do with vista. 
2.	Installing two operative systems on top of each other may be convenient, but that would be like making two meals for just one person. Its just plain fucking useless and it wont work. If it was designed to work, it will not. I have had my runs with XP and I can tell you that zeroes and ones don?t want company by other zeroes and ones. Don?t try to install two of anything.
And were off to the big questions, like ?please heeelp meeeee? and ?I burned this REALLY SLOWLY and it wont work?(OMFG how dumb are you, you have to burn it SLOOOOWER) this only applies for you who cant seem to use simple instructions, let alone burn a DVD

Okay, I will write this in plain text and not number it.

First off, when you install an OS, you must make sure that there is nothing else on the hard drive. Some structures of file systems allow this (*64 for example) because they are technically more advanced that the x32 (NTFS) predecessor. It also comes down to a lot of other factors, such as partitions and what type of HDD youre trying to use. So all of you who decided to ?upgrade? vista are not completely dumb, but you must realize that a fresh copy of Vista, MAY be compatible this way (im just assuming that MS did it this way) but once updated and used, the computer changes a lot of its predominant structure. This leaves a mess on your HDD and will usually fuck things up once your OS is installed. Even if windows says its removed all the starter files, it needs to reformat the disk. A new computer comes freshly formatted from the line, but once you?ve used it, you must redo all of that.

Next off, you must always make sure YOU ARE NOT connected to the internet when trying to install RETAIL stuff. RETAILS contain code from the manufacturer, telling the software to ?call home? and tell where it is, what its doing and if it carries that shiny badge saying ?legit? on its chest. This is something I hate MS for since youre practically renting their OS, it will always respond to its one and only Master..microsoft themselves. XP did have this issue when its retail pirated versions came out on TPB, but after a year or two hackers started changing the stuff so that XP didn?t ?call home? or needed activation. With windows 7, we wont see that for a long time since Microsoft probably have anticipated all of this and will try to shut down illegit copies remotely. This means having you computer online is probab"
,lerchos2,2009-12-14T02:49Z,"To all of you who have issues with the OS. Do the following steps.

FORMAT YOUR HARDDRIVE

REINSTALL

MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET IS OFFLINE

DONT RUN WINDOWS UPDATE, UNLESS NECESSARY.

MAKE SURE YOU ACTIVATE PROPERLY AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS."

,funkstar10,2009-12-14T13:45Z,"hey guys, just curious about this, i got a couple of questions, if this works on my comp, every time microsoft releases updates i can get them and keep up-to-date with all bug fixing also i have a backup hard drive and i want to install this in my C drive, will i lose my backup cause since the backup drive is not recognized by windows 7, thanks in advance "

administrative tools in the control panel will let you recognize the partition so you can mount them to D:\  or E:\   and so on. it's entirely up to you...

@ANYONE
""some people like me are really hate to format the hard disk or even creating partition(s).""

if you one of them and dont want to format your hard disk, you got another option,
you might scan the hard disk for error using checkdisk also known as error-checking and set them to be automatically fix the disk errors and attempt the recovery for a bad sectors."

,BasSmurf,2009-12-15T01:39Z,P.S.  I upgraded from a 32-bit Vista to the x86.  Worked fine as an upgrade.  You don't have to format your HDD if you have vista i believe.  I didn't need to.

@bbaassiiee: All your programs including your previous Windows OS will be moved to a folder named ""windows old"".
Most of my progs there still worked. Managed to simply cut and paste them into a different folder and still working. Others need to be run in Windows xp sp3 compatibility mode, and ofcourse a couple others needed a re-instal.

Also good to know is some progs simply don't work in Win7. My old daemon tools for example. Had to get the new Dtools lite version which is 100% compatible with win7. A game didn't wanna start either because it lacked directx9, so I had to install some directx pack, now it works fine."

if ya worried about getting into trouble then you shouldnt be on here cus u obviously dont know what ya doing.

the bay is full of loaders(activators), just use them like everyone else does, thats what they're there for. people dont need to email u for tips on how to get past the activation screen, installing and activating the os is simple so dont try to make it more complicated for the people who dont really know what they're doing.

hows it going mate, i see ya still getting wound up with the noobsters, ya gonna need some anger management before long, or some diazepam. its shocking reading some of the comments on here tho, they dont even understand their computer so defo shouldnt be dl'ing torrents, reading someone asking if they can get into trouble doing this is fucked up, i wish people would just use google to get some understanding of what they're doing, if ya dont know what ya doing u shouldnt be here. knowledge is king.

Will the loader work when i upgrade Win7 to SP1 when the service pack comes out? Or the Remove wat method of Hazar would work?

When will we get a developer crack for this just like Vista.

@extremezone and everyone else

I haven't installed it till now. But when I open the images of hazar's activator, the product ID in it is black. Have you blackened it or is it black? I think it should show a ID there.

Anyway thanks for the upload extremezone. You are the greatest."
,NarutoNamikaze,2009-12-22T14:39Z,"^^ I mean after writing the retail version that extremezone has uploaded.

Plus what is the difference between Retail and RTM. Is the RTM version the Retail one? I am really confused.

Will these loaders work on the RTM version?"

Do not unzip the files. In image burn select the option 'Write Image Files to the Disk'. In it add the file that you have downloaded. Not the unzipped one. The big file that you have downloaded is actually the .iso file. It is not .rar file. Write is to disk and enjoy."

,savestheeday,2009-12-23T11:14Z,"WOW!  works excellent!  I installed it from my portable HDD since I didn't have a DVD burner, and it installed in about 15 minutes, amazing.  Fully activated and fully updated.

For those of you having trouble, once the image is mounted, there is a folder located under the image titled Crack.  within that folder is program called a ""loader"" just run the loader, and then reboot the pc WHEN it tells you to.  Also, when it asks you for a serial during the install, don't put one.  Just click next and it will let you finish the install.

It's amazing what can get done when you simply follow instructions ;)"

,Matter123,2009-12-24T13:07Z,"to fucksholihin, im obviously talking about the product key needed to activate windows, I have finished installing and everything works great but I only have it for 30 days until I find a product key... So my question is are there any product keys out there that work? I hope my this helps you understand what im talking about."
,savestheeday,2009-12-24T16:25Z,"Matter, I'm about 100% if you just run the Loader under the crack file, and then reboot your computer like it tells you to, it will activate it AND it will assign you a key.

As far as those who are getting errors during install, the only thing I can tell you is the files are burning to the disk correctly.  Try burning another copy, and if that doesn't work, re-download the torrent and try again.  You are burning it to a DVD and not a CD correct?

If that still fails in your face, just do what I did and install it from a USB device.  It's a little trickier than burning to a disk, but it saves time in the long run, and installs in no time flat!"

There are instructions included with this up. If you follow them correctly you will not have a problem.

Yes you can upgrade but from Vista only (remember all versions before Vista are FAT32 file system, not NTFS)
There are two SEPERATE ISOs included: 32bit and 64bit. Burn either one to a disc and install
You can NOT upgrade with the 64bit version...you have to do a fresh install or not at all.
As I said before...follow instructions carefully!
The older Hazar folder does have instructions on how to use the activators.

Kyngo you are an idiot. 
This IS Windows 7. Maybe you have a lesser version of it but this is indeed Windows 7....
Humor me...right-click on ""Computer"" and choose ""Properties"". A window will pop up and at the top of it, you will see your Windows version. 
Mine says ""Windows 7 Ultimate"" (now).
Vista never did say Version 6.0 or 6...it said ""Windows Vista"".

well i finaly got it downloaded... it took 5 days thanks to few generous arsholes that had there uploads set to 1.... but its ok because it works... it updates ect.

it runs my machine, faster than the 2009 XP black download and i only have a gig of ram...

i,m noticing my 9400GT graphics are looking a hell of a lot better with the new directX, and that bastard login noise that i heard all the time, useing XP, has been replaced with a nice, soft, easy to listen to, audible shiatsu massage...

there was nothing worse than booting up XP, and you,v forgoten to turn the 500 watts of blood curdling volume down on the power amplifier from the night before... the friggin house stumps vibrate and your missus, shits an egg roll... yeah! real funny joke that shit was Microsoft!

Made me waste like 10 or more Blank Discs, tried different Burner softs, Tried at the very lowest speeds of burning...

still wont budge ""missing files upon installation""

until i discovered that while the download is in the torrent downloader (utorrent for me) i had to force re check it...

The download state indicates it is already completed at 100%

then i force re-check (or if force recheck isnt available, try the option: right click the torrent then select the option ""remove"" (but don't remove and...)

after the check i found out i am only 88.1%, then download resumes...

at the next check, it resulted to a 99.4% complete, then download resumes...

at the check it finally it made 100% and then burned it at 4x to a blank dvd...

finally it worked for me...

hehehe

hope this helps someone having problem ""missing files""

I had this same issue(although I was going from x32 to x64 due to increase in ram)...I spent 6+ hours backing up movies/music etc...installed(...perfectly i might add!) only to find better news...it actually does not remove your files, it creates a folder called windows(old) which has everything from you past windows edition...anyways I was mad for wasting all that time, but it also saved me time by not having to manually copy back everything I backed up..."

Is it possible that Vista is still installed? I deleted the Windows Old file which was like 60GB. Mistake?

,seebee0509,2010-01-20T12:51Z,"vampire_man182,

There are 2 iso file in the torrent. Each ISO is 3gb. sure will fit in one DVD. the x86 for 32bit and x64 for 64bit. DOnt have to unpack. use cd burner software, select burn image. In other word, burn 2 DVDs."
,hplp20,2010-01-20T16:06Z,"All right.
First off, you only need one of the two ISOs in the torrent. You have to pick between 32-bit and 64-bit. I always prefer a clean install. 
Here's what I did.
1. Download any one of the versions (x64)
2. Burn to DVD using Magic ISO, Power ISO, etc.
3. Backup anything you want.
4. Restart and boot from DVD. 
5. Click Install now and then custom.
6. When the list of drives comes, format the drive which has the current installation.
7. Start installing.
8. After finishing, it automatically restarts.
9. Create a user account. 
10. Login to Windows.
11. Open Daz Loder 1.6.9 included in the torrent.
12. Set SLIC and Certificate to any company you want.
13. Select one of the Ultimate serials.
14. Select 'Use default loader.'
15. Software mod --> install.
16. Click ok to restart. 
17. Windows 7 Ultimate is activated and updates normally."
,pospit,2010-01-20T18:05Z,"i've read here that some people's DL speed drops (torrents) after installing windows 7.

maybe that (like with xp) you have to get tcpip.sys edited or patched to increase the numbers of max half open connections in windows 7.

i still use xp (64) so i'm not familiar with windows 7.
i know that standard xp has only 10 of these half open connections. torrent speeds can increase after editing to e.g. 100 (recommended) connections. 
i have it set to a couple of thousands (was an unattended install)
and the torrents fly in as fast as my connection lets me.  

so google some info about it or check this

I've discovered something unusual about the x64 build 7600 that you might want to know about. Last night I got the ?This copy of Windows is not genuine? message. Had a look in my firewall rules and found a rule that was allowing ""windowsupdaterapplications"" to connect to the internet and I thought that was the source of my problem. Turns out it wasn't - the included activators don't work - but I found out that upon blocking ""windowsupdaterapplications"" from the network I lose all connectivity completely. When I diagnose the problem I get the result ""The DNS server isn't responding"". My laptop can't connect through the router either. When I allow ""windowsupdaterapplications"" again my connectivity comes back. Is there any way a knowledgable sort like yourself might be able to look into this and find a fix? I don't like allowing this apps to have network access but I'm not savvy enough myself to find a fix."

you have to do some research about formatting. You see, if your HDD have partition is easier for to format without losing ur data. Format only the partition which dont have any important files in it. Yes it will erase all of your data and WinXP IF AND ONLY IF they were on the same partition.
You have to do some googling about this.
Good Luck!!"

I´ll be back later when I managed to install it and use it. The 32 went fine... so I don´t see if there should be any problem with the 64.

Oh, and try to remember people... a great or good connection can make a whole difference in the upload/download. If it goes bad, it´s often your connection and you seriously need to get a better one. I don´t ask you to seed since I´m a bit more patience then you ever be, but have that in mind alright? I´ll try to seed some... but if you other don´t hang in as well... I will cancel it.

,peterpanpirate123,2010-02-04T20:17Z,"Great torrent.  I ran avast on this several times and found no virus.  Hopefully, that is really true. 

Anyways, I've been running Win7 for a week now and today I started having some problem.  Maybe it's just me but this is what happened.

After login, all I got was a black screen.  I hard boot my pc and was able to login properly.  But the next problem was that I can't open any programs.  I tried opening Firefox, PowerDvd and it wouldn't open.  You click on the icon and nothing happens.  So I just restore my image and I am good again.

I think the problem is with a current Microsoft Update.  I did my first update of Win7 fine like a week ago.  But maybe it was last night's auto-update that caused those problems because my pc was fine up until this morning which is Feb 4, 2010.  So after my image restored, I turned off auto-update and I should be good for awhile.

So careful guys with the auto-update.  Image your pc pretty much after you finish installing Win7 or after you loaded all your core programs."

So i downloaded this torrent, downloaded very quick, because of the fast speed(Thanks:D), and then i put the windows 64 bit iso file on a 4.7gGB DVD+R. Then i rebooted my pc(which uses xp) and nothing showed up. so i did it again and again and again, tryed every f buttons, but nothing worked.

Then i booted up a medion XP cd, which i use to reinstall, delete and repair my XP OS. it worked ofc, so i went on and i deleted the whole (C:) partition.

So now my HD is blank, now it must work i think. but no, it doesnt. Instead i get this message ""BOOT DISK FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER"". This message came even if i didnt have the windows 64 bit file cd in my drive. And when it was in, the message went away, and then a few secs later, it comes again.

So now i've reinstalled windows XP(using that medion cd), installed everything i need to go on the net etc just so i can post this message, and maybe get some help.

i check all my updates looking for the allusive creature known as ""windows verification tool"" (not knowing if the same apply for windows 7 as XP?)

so this is how it went away for me... for now!?

keep in mind you may just have to uninstall HAZAR loader 1.6.1d then reinstall, but these were my faults (also being done out of order) leading up to it working some how. 

first i tried repairing the loader with  HAZAR loader 1.6.1d, on reboot i had to repair windows loader with ""last known config""

then i uninstalled HAZAR loader 1.6.1.d and restarted windows successfully

then i tried loader 1.6.9 by Daz, i was given a error after install MSVCP71.dll not found, then i restarted

then i reinstalled HAZAR 1.6.1d OEM only, i did not use SLIC 2.1 in bios

BAM! its working.. somehow? did my faults lead up to it working?? first try uninstalling and reinstalling OEM loader by HAZAR. if that doesn't work... then try the stupid route

if only uninstalling and reinstalling HAZAR works... please post for others!"

Hello, i need your help!

So i downloaded this torrent, downloaded very quick, because of the fast speed(Thanks:D), and then i put the windows 64 bit iso file on a 4.7gGB DVD+R. Then i rebooted my pc(which uses xp) and nothing showed up. so i did it again and again and again, tryed every f buttons, but nothing worked.

Then i booted up a medion XP cd, which i use to reinstall, delete and repair my XP OS. it worked ofc, so i went on and i deleted the whole (C:) partition.

So now my HD is blank, now it must work i think. but no, it doesnt. Instead i get this message ""BOOT DISK FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER"". This message came even if i didnt have the windows 64 bit file cd in my drive. And when it was in, the message went away, and then a few secs later, it comes again.

So now i've reinstalled windows XP(using that medion cd), installed everything i need to go on the net etc just so i can post this message, and maybe get some help.

Thank you, help is appreciated.""""


Did you burn an image (at slowest speed) or did you just burn the file to dvd???    you need to make sure you burn an image with an image burning program...i.e. magic, iso, nero....ect then just put in your dvd drive and reboot..."

read the INSTRUCTIONS at top of page!!!

1. Burn the ISO to a DVD using any image burner software, a free option would be
""Image burn"".
2. Boot using the DVD and follow the instructions to install the OS.
3. After the OS is installed, run either Hazar 7Loader 1.6.1d or Daz Loader 1.7.0 and your Windows 7 will be activated and genuine.

,miserydan,2010-02-18T07:20Z,I noticed running windows 7 64bit with some 32 bit programs runs average. Once every program is written in 64 bit it will make sense. 32 bit programs can only read 4gigs of ram and windows 7 can read 128 gigs of ram. I have 8gigs installed with a 2.3 amd quad core and windows 7 runs ok but when I go back to my 32 bit xp with these programs installed they run so much faster. It is a night and day difference.

2) Because I didn't use a common and illegal activator that MS can easily recognize - like 90% of you did. 

3) The anti-piracy update 'THEY' have out is optional for now, so no need to worry unless you run it. 

4) When Win 7 SP1 comes out - then you may have to worry should you DL it. Then again, there will most likely be a fix for that within a day or two. Don't panic. ;P"

I upgraded WIN7 ultimate 7100 RC  to WIN7 ultimate Final RETAIL. I had 3 more days to go until my version of win7 would shut down every 2 hours.

Guys that have win7 7100 RC build and want the final version of windows 7 ultimate, follow these very easy steps:

1. GET THIS DL IMMEDIATELY !!!!

2. RUN ISO IN DEAMON-TOOLS

3. COPY THE WIN7 INSTALLATION CD TO YOUR HARD DRIVE --> NO NEED TO BURN ON DVD FOR UPGRADE !!!!!

4. JUST MODIFY ONE SMALL FILE, follow the nuuby steps in the link below lol 
http://tech.icrontic.com/articles/upgrade-the-windows-7-rc-to-retail/

5. INSTALL WIN7 UPGRADE FROM YOUR HARD DRIVE (JUST CLICK THE SETUP FILE)

6. THE upgrade took around 2 hours for me....depending on how much crap you have on your older version of windows 7.

7. IF ASKED for a ACTIVATION KEY...DO NOT FILL ANYTHING IN.....JUST PRESS NEXT!!!!!!

8. AFTER IT HAS INSTALLED, all your crap will still be there, even the bloody wallpaper lol

9. FINALLY just run one of the activators from this Download....the PC will restart and you will have a FULLY ACTIVATED WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE FINAL RETAILED VERSION.

Tips:
Stay connected to internet let windows update what it wants.....it will not affect anything

After installing everything, if you want make sure that windows 7 does not automatically downloads or installs anymore updates....CLICK NEVER UPDATE, that way you can update when every you want, and choose exact files you need.

don't ask me about windows vista, i guess it works the same way"

,stunna13,2010-02-27T12:35Z,"depends on wich one u want to use
do some research u know its called google
x86 is 32 bit x64 is 64 bit system
i recommend the x86"
,wassall,2010-02-27T12:48Z,Well actually the 64bit is better but as most programs don't support WIN7 32bit let alone 64bit..I would choose 64bit if you watch more videos in HD but for complete pease of mind use 32bit
,MediaKing_123,2010-02-27T13:46Z,"For god sakes guys...when a nuub asks a question read carefully what he/she wrote and answer him fully according to the question...so they dont have to keep asking again just to get a clear answer.

@jurdajurss....bro this download contains  literally 2 different versions of windows 7 ultimate: the x86 version and the x64 version.

You do not even need to download both of them...you can choose to download only 1 of them if you want.

You do not need to install the x86 one to install the x64 one, they are totally independent from one another.....but as to which one you want to install it is up to you. I have 4gigs of RAM so i choose the x64 version.
Good luck!!"
,MediaKing_123,2010-02-27T13:51Z,"wassall...did you just say:

""but as most programs don't support WIN7 32bit let alone 64bit""

Every shitty program I use has worked on windows 7 64bit version....

IF you are running a program that is not 64bit....windows will install it in 86x Program files folder and will still run it....so both 32bit and 64bit software runs fine in windows 7 64bit"

@ anyone whose windows doesnt start up after using the activator - 

Go to the Cracks folder, then into the Activators folder and go into - ""Windows 7 Loader 1.6.9 by Daz"" Folder. There you'll find the folder named ""Notes"".

You'll find all the help from there. Refer to the file named ""How to recover Windows.txt""

,Shazam_777,2010-03-02T04:21Z,"Werm sounds like a troll.  he makes no mention on how he activated, we all can presume he bought a legit copy.  

this is what he writes:

""Werm at 2010-02-26 02:26 CET: 

I'm still activated and will be continue to be activated. I even downloaded and ran their anti-piracy WAT and all is still good. Why?

1) This DL is the untouched retail version so 'THEY' cannot know only from using this.

2) Because I didn't use a common and illegal activator that MS can easily recognize - like 90% of you did. 

3) The anti-piracy update 'THEY' have out is optional for now, so no need to worry unless you run it. 

4) When Win 7 SP1 comes out - then you may have to worry should you DL it. Then again, there will most likely be a fix for that within a day or two. Don't panic. ;P 
Werm at 2010-02-26 02:31 CET: 

5) It is a good idea not to run WAT at all even if you are still legit. You are only helping 'THEM' figure 'THINGS' out for when they update it. You can easily uninstall it - like I finally did.

Once you have downloaded windows 7 open magic iso cd&dvd burner burn win 7 iso. 4). download bootable ISO Active@ Killdisk from killdisk website, it's free. burn to cd using magicISO. Its better if you do a clean install. back up your important stuff. i just backed up my music..f*** the rest. 5). Now boot from Killdisk CD and enter KILLDISK.EXE at prompt and format your HDD. 6). Ok once its finished formatting. Install Win 7, don't worry about key...7). Now that win 7 is installed, go to mydigitallife forum and download most recent DAZ loader. which is 1.7.7r. 8).

\$WINDOWS~BT\Windows|System32\winload.exe is missing or corrupt.
Insert disc into drive D and restart computer. If problem continues contact Admin or Software supplier.

I opened the burned disc and here are the contents that are on the DVD disc:-
boot
efi
sources
support
upgrade
autorun
bootmgr
bootmgr.efi
setup

Ok so where is the i386? where is the 

\$WINDOWS~BT\Windows|System32\winload.exe

Nice to see that people are getting the goods since my earlier comment. 
Whats the story on the one I have, that won't load to a partion of Master drive so I can dual boot W7x86 and this W7x64, installs on top of my installed W7 x32 and then screws it by not continuing the instal?....which is meant to be going to the Master HDD partition D drive.
Me??...I'll think I will stay with the 32Bit and forgo the 1GB waste of 4GB DDR2 RAM I have installed.
I envy those that have had this instal for them, but....spilt milk ain't worth lapping up.

,gbroman,2010-03-04T18:02Z,"A bit more info: I burned the entire 3GB of W7x64 to DVD using ImageBurn

The inserted disc in the DVD drive is labeled ""GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD""

Double click the DVD RW Drive icon with the disc in drive and get a UAC window asking if I want to allow this program from an unknown publisher to make changes to this computer?

Program name: sperr32.exe
Publisher: Unknown
File origin: CD/DVD drive

I have two downloads of W7x86 + x64 from two different sources. Unfortunately, neither of them instal and/or run a usable OS.

For the hell of it I Googled GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD and got the following from the link below:

http://www.google.co.nz/search?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&channel=s&hl=en&source=hp&q=GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD&meta=&btnG=Google+Search

If somehow I have D-loaded the version given in the link well I'll be blowed. Some wires have gotten crossed somewhere. I'm sure extremezone's upload is faultless. I seem to have got a hold of a maverick.
I'll give it one more shot and try to d-load W7x64 again.

,Quantum12,2010-03-04T18:58Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."

You can pick any activator from the three available options

-It is recommended to use Hazar 7Loader 1.6.1d or Daz's Windows 7 Loader 1.7.0,
as they are newer and better versions .You are free to use any of the loaders listed
here, just go through their features and pick the one which is most relevant with your
case.

-If Hazar loader doesn't work, there is an option to uninstall it, you can then use Daz Loader, it is a bit more featured and perhaps better.

Do this have Finnish Language?

Aarooo at 2010-03-06 15:10 CET:
Is there Finnish language? When I update this, is there gonna be finnish language?

Yes you will have Finnish language available to you. It is in the 34 Optional updates that are available to download From M$ using the Updates utility found in Control Panel.

As has been mentioned umpteen times ""DO NOT DOWNLOAD and/or INSTAL THE UPDATE KB971033""....it will screw up your Validation of Windows 7 and you'll have to go read here in the comments and find out how to get it oki doki again.
The update KB97033 was an OPTIONAL update, MS have now made it an IMPORTANT update.
Suggest you look at what updates are availabe and look for KB971033 and UNTICK the box so that it doesn't download and instal itself.

OKI DOKI
""DO NOT DOWNLOAD UPDATE KB971033"""
,gbroman,2010-03-06T20:45Z,"           WARNING!!!!!!!!

,gbroman,2010-03-08T10:14Z,"FIRSTLY
The comments I left about about the screwed up instals I made with the X64 version of this torrent; I managed to get the X64 partial  Custom instal removed from my computer today and that allowed me to boot into the X86 version of W7 I had tried to make the 'Old Windows' part of the step up to X64 Bit. 
I opened the uT and saw the dload of this torrent still there and checked the folder where my torrents go to. I noticed that the X64 Bit file said ~part file......looked at the torrent in uT and there it was unfinished, at 98.2%. Something must have been amiss( my eyes perhaps?) when I thought it had finished. I had burned to disc an incomplete file..it would seem. I finished the dload and run a Force Recheck twice. I also started ther X86 part of the torrent so that I would have the fill torrent.
I will burn the X64 to disc and try the instal again. See what happens and will post result asap.

SECONDLY
I had used the WAT removal tool to boot out the KB971033 deactivator problem and had used the Loader to revalidate my X86 W7 that I had installed from another source and all was good again.However, I think something went amiss in the part instal af X64 and the Windows is Genuine Watermark was missing in System Information window. A message said "" 21 days to activate Windows"" etc Nine days ago I tried to instal the X64 W7.
Anyway, I couldn't find the loader I ysed but I knew that I had copied a page from somewhere that gave some serials for W7 X86 and X64. I dug it out of My Docs and Used it to 'Change Product Key""
The first one I tried didn't pass the test when sent to MS online, but the second one did and my W7 X86 is validated again.
The first one I tried was the bottom one of the two SK's, the second one I tried was the top one of them.
Perhaps I shouldn't post them here in case they get spied by M$ sleuths...but here you go...Good lock and get in QUICK if your W7's been de=validated. AND use the blimmin WAT REMOVAL tool before ya use one of these keys. And shoot the KB971033 with a DO NOT DOWNLOAD SILVER BULLET.

,gbroman,2010-03-09T13:29Z,"I'll make it easy and show where my attempts are getting screwed up, the problem is there in the End Game:-
My moves
Instal from USB drive
1/ Copying Windows files ( reboots itself)
2/ Expanding Windows files (gets to 100%)
3/ Installing features ( 5 seconds max)
4/ Installing updates ( 1 second as I didn't opt to get any at start)
5/ Completing Installation ( did it do it? I wonder...seems to have rebooted computer while the staus bar was not fully green)
6/ After the reboot informed "" Setup is updating the registry"",- this takes 8 minutes then reboots. (This is not in a Command prompt window)
7/ Starting Windows screen.............W7 icon..........just sits there indefinately
.......................
Orbit30's moves ( or this torrentS'as well I'd assume they should all follow a set pattern)

- After formatting, setup will continue automaticly and it will finish after 15-30 min.

- Next step would be username

- Type your password (if you want).

- When you get the screen for CD-KEY just ignore it leaving blank.



*Uncheck the box for automaticly activation and click next.

- Choose the third option for next step.

- Select your time zone.

- Select your current location (Home is recommended).

- The black CMD windows will appear. Wait a few seconds until computers restares once again.

- And that would be all about installation. You are in Windows now.
.......................................Why am I getting the Reboots and not being asked to enter Time zone/user name/omit putting in a cd key...etc? and that reboot which then says ""Setup is updating registry""

I dunno, beats me. I have downloaded W7 X85 + X64 from 3 different sources, and not one of them works for me.
I'm fairly confident that I have the complete W7 OS downloaded and either on DVD or HDD/USB HDD. Can't get one of them to function.
Makes me wonder what's up doc?
As I said, I don't think its my computer, running Gigabyte GA-M68SM-S2L mobo, AMD AThlonII X4 630 CPU and 4GB A-Data DDR2 PC6400 Dual channel RAM and I'm sending the W7 X64 to a Seagate Barracuda160GB Sata2 HDD partition 1 or to a 1TB Seagate Sata2 slave HDD.
Sigh.........got me beat it has. I have tried unconnecting all HDD's bar the 160GB that I'm installing X64 to....still get the same result ( 4 letter word/s)
Bummer, 1GB of RAM goes begging...
I'll let ya know if I get a positive result
KiotiMac 
ps: only thing I can think of that may cause the problem I have installing would be the Award F9e (Beta) BIOS I installed so that I could run the AMD AthlonII X4 630 CPU (AM3) on my AM2 motherboard. I already had W7 X86 installed before I upgraded my computer,
Just a thought. Another is that I have XP Pro on a HD that I can put into my computer and run it, I might try the ""Upgrade""  option, XP to W7 is an option I believe.
Anyway, thats my lot on the subject for now. Think I've just about said it all.
Cheers"

So I want to reinstall windows. I managed to copy all my files on external harddisk so I want to also format the XP-computer. I downloaded this torrent and burned it on dvd. I started my XP-computer and started Win7 installation in XP. Of course after 4-5 minutes my installation got stuck, same in safe-mode by the way. When I put the dvd with this win7 file it doesn't reboot from the dvd but starts XP normally. In BIOS I have cd/dvd as 3rd boot device enabled. I burned with alcohol120, chose directly the image file that downloaded to my harddisk, didn't winzip anything. Win7 is on the burned dvd and works because I started the install and all was good till my computer ofcourse crashed again. My question: How to format my xp-computer using this torrent and install win7 over it, without having to start windowsxp first because it crashes after 3-4 minutes.

pick one iso file from the torrent to download. they are clearly labelled either 32bit or 64bit, if you are unsure about your system, use 32bit.

use one of the loaders in this torrent to activate, dont ask for a serial.

It did not come with drivers for the sata harddrive that i was trying to install it on, and therefore just kept going through the install over and over. Could be your problem. If so, you will need to slip-stream the drivers into the copy of windows which is a lot easier than it sounds. just google instructions. 

On the other hand, windows 7 does require quite a bit to run and your systems specs seem way below the possibility of getting it to work (no offense). I could be wrong on this. I do have a barebones copy of xp sp3 that i already have those drivers slipstreamed into. I could upload it if you wanted. However I dont know how long i could seed it."
,bQ,2010-04-18T21:02Z,"i tryed to burn the x64 image in to a DVD which i wanted to install on my other computer as that didnt work, i took the DVD into my computer and an READ ME.txt file came up and said:

This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system
that supports the ISO-13346 ""UDF"" file system specification.

What does this mean? Is there something wrong with the version i have?"

When i had vista on, i did use  the upgrade option instead of a custom clean install (which ended messing my system) So i installed xp. So for the ppl who are trying to install from xp, make sure you update all the graphic drivers and etc...Then run Windows 7 upgrade advisor, it will let you know if need further updating of your drivers.

runawaa - What version of vista do you have? I installed win 7 on a secondary computer. IMO win 7 is little bit more colorful and has lots of functions in comparison to vista. Also Win 7 takes much less space on your hard drive than vista. So it could be faster than vista depending on the specs you have. "
,Doktor_Cult,2010-04-23T15:08Z,"I've read almost every page of comments and it looks like in the last month or so there has been some confusion as whether this torrent still works as it did before.

I have just successfully upgraded from Vista 32bit to Windows 7 32bit. All my files, folders, and settings were retained.

Before installing I backed up my entire PC (this was not necessary in the end), and disabled my anti-virus software.

The installation process took 2 hours (probably due to the large amount of files on my laptop) but had no errors. I ran the installation from my laptop, I did not burn it to a DVD (see below on how to do it).

After installing the first thing I did was run the Hazar 7Loader 1.6.1, this installed very quickly (restart is required). After doing this my Windows 7 was activated and is now genuine.

I then updated using Windows Update. I did not come across the dreaded ""KB971033"" update. I installed all the updates available to me, except the unnecessary language updates. Upon restart I checked to see if I was still activated and genuine and I AM =D

So, to recap - I upgraded from Vista to 7, keeping all my programmes, documents, etc. This took approx. 2 hours. After this was complete the first thing I did was installed the activator, followed by re-activating my anti-virus, then installing Windows Updates.

I now (currently) have a working, genuine copy of Windows 7 on my PC, thanks to this torrent.


Thanks to ""Jackson.Pa"" for instructions on how to install without burning to a DVD. His information is copied below:

(note: I did not use his recommended 'Remove WAT' software, I used the activator included in this torrent)...

THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THIS DOWNLOAD BUT DONT HAVE ANY DISCS, ITS A REALLY EASY METHOD, AND WORKS PERFECTLY.

- Download the file (make sure you have winrar, if not download it from*)

* http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5069577/WinRAR_v3.90_Final___KeyReg_By_ChattChitto

- Right click the windows 7 .iso file and then open with WinRAR, this shows the contents of the disc.

- You can just run the setup.exe file from winrar but if you want it in a file then just create a folder and extract it all into that folder

- There will be a bunch of files and at the very bottom there should be a setup.exe

- Click on the setup.exe this should begin your windows 7 Ultimate setup.

- Go through all of the setup, and when you get to the Activation part and it asks you for a serial key, just leave it blank and click next.

- After it has finished downloading windows 7 will be up and running, however not activated.

- Download this file

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5188318/Windows_7_Activator_RemoveWAT_v2.1_by_Hazar

^^ that is the latest

This will activate your windows 7 and make it genuine, removing the 30 day trial crap, i prefer to run this whilst disconnected to the internet.

and there you have it, a genuine, activated windows 7 without burning it to a disc, i hope this helped. "

To all of u who ask about licence codes, forget about it, just leave it blank, and run ""7loader by hazar 1.6"" as soon as installation is complete, it will make your OS ""legit"" and let you use Windows Update..

During installation/upgrade you're asked if you want to download relevant win updates to aid in the installation process, I selected the ""NO"" option. Make sure you download any Windows updates before installing, but don't download any during the process in case some Genuine/etc detection software is downloaded. I also disconnected from the internet during the entire Win7 installation to make sure that nothing came down the line from Microsoft that would stop the loader from working.

Still genuine a week on, more win updates have been downloaded since =)"

,nimbylive,2010-05-05T06:09Z,"Awesome DL.  To all who do not want to go through the 50+ pages of comments:

Skip his serial keys.  You do not have to enter one.  When you are completely down with the install just load up one of the installers (Daz worked great for me) by putting it on a thumb drive or a cd.  

Burn a couple copies with different media, my first did not work and it was burned slowly on the the same drive that I ended up putting win 7 on, but my second worked perfect and I used another comp. and burned at max speed.  

Keep your PC unhooked from the internet until you are validated with the activation program.
When you get to the part with the windows updates ask to look at each one first.  Do not accept (ever) KB 971033 it is meant to check if you are genuine or not.    

Bask in someone elses hard work like the thousands of others that are seeding this thing because of how much it rocks."

,princesslea,2010-05-06T03:07Z,"First let me say THANK YOU to extremezone for this awesome DL. Then THANK YOU to all the peeps who posted helpful solutions to questions. I AM A NEWB and with only a few speed bumps (steep learning curve ;) I managed to successfully DL W7 AND run the loader :)

I have one question I'm hoping someone can answer....sorry in advance if this is a dorky NEWB?

After reading through all the comments (and yes folks I even copied and pasted the ones I thought might come in handy during my download to a word doc)there was one in the early days of this torrent that mentioned something about the software deactivating Aug2010....here's the post:

djrush at 2009-12-06 19:27 CET: 

I downloaded this torrent and it DOES work... The only problem I see is that even if the software is activated it will deactivate sometime between June and August of 2010. I only know this because I too have a MSDN tech account and the news of a 2010 cutoff was published on their site back in May of this year (when I downloaded the same files contained in this torrent). All I'm saying is don't wast your time and hard drive space downloading this if you want an OS that won't stop working on you.. THE VERSION OF WINDOWS 7 AVAILABLE FROM MSDN HAS A 2010 CUTOFF DATE. See For Yourself.. 

Can someone just confirm if this is BS or not?"
,bcasey25,2010-05-06T06:46Z,"@princesslea
sorry that was for the beta and rc not the release specified here.

it is safe to install. but if it breaks on me i always have a backup plan.
i will just reinstall windows xp."
,princesslea,2010-05-06T07:47Z,"Thanks for the quick reply :)

Oh and for anyone who is still asking for a serial number.....YOU DON'T NEED ONE. Just leave the field blank and continue on with the install. 

FYI I selected the Custom Install, not the Update Install....you'll see what I mean when the program gets to that stage of the install. After the install was complete, I went to the folder Windows Old (the program automatically creates this folder if you choose the custom install) and found the torrent I had downloaded which also contains Daz's Windows 7 loader. I opened the loader program and it completed the activation process for me :) Very easy....even for a total NEWB like me ;)

Thanks again to everyone who made this possible :)"

follow these steps, cant go wrong:

download,
burn the image file to a blank dvd,
run setup.exe on the disk,
follow instructions,
DO NOT select the option to update windows,
DO NOT validate the software,
DO NOT enter a cd key or serial,
when the installation is complete run the DAZ programme which is included in the download, which will validate windows,

and ur done :)

I know this has nothing to do with warez just that finally after 20 years I thought maybe I should buy an OS.

Go to windows update, view update history (on the left), and on the top of that, there is a link to see installed updates.
Scroll through the list. It is likely that you installed the KB971003 update, if so, find it and uninstall it. Try re-running the activator, and it should work."

,carambolapreta,2010-05-19T17:23Z,"1 - this torrent works perfectly, 32bit and 64bit. I installed both in many computers and still working for months without no issues.

2 - Dont need to burn the iso. You can mount the image with Power Iso. Easier and faster.

3- If you're facing any problem you must have done something wrong like updated K971033 or your iso is corrupted.

4 - You do not lose your data. just pay attention during installing and you ll be able to keep it all. look for windows.old"

I've looked through all the archive of comments on this particular torrent and spent a good while searching through Google.  However, I still can't find the answer to my following question:

I have my original harddrive C:, my Windows XP is installed on it along with all my music and application installers etc.  I also have a secondary hard disk which I installed a couple of months after I got my PC, E:, and on this are all my movies and tv shows and various other music etc.

If I were to install this version of Windows 7 via Jackson PA's method of WinRAR + setup.exe, will my files that are on my secondary disk drive remain untouched?

Rather than creating a partition or formatting the entire hard drive, is it possible to simply upgrade and keep all your previous files? I'm coming from Vista Home Premium 64-bit by the way."

Yes it is possible to upgrade to Windows 7 from your Vista installation. I would recommend you don't though. You can back up your files on an external hard drive, or if you have more than one hard drive (or more than one partition), you can format specifically that partition, rather than all partitions.

It's up to you! Good luck!"

I tested this torrent to see it for myself and it looked pretty decent! :D +1 extremezone!

,Kiwi12,2010-07-01T02:13Z,"Umm, a couple questions before I download this. First, it needs to be a DVD and not a CD right? Second, when it's done installing, does it keep the old windows files? Lastly, do all the drivers such as the internet drivers and stuff like that come up on their own? Are they included in the installation? The sound, network, and stuff like that? Please let me know, thanks.

Kiwi"
,Kiwi12,2010-07-01T02:24Z,"Hey before I download I have 3 questions...

1)When installing this do you need a DVD or a CD. In the comments people are using both words.

2)When installing do the files from the past OS (vista for me) go into a OLD WINDOWS file? Like does that file get made by itself? Do my programs stay installed or what? 

3)Also, lastly are the drivers for the sound and network installed when you boot from the DVD or CD?

Thanks in advance,
Kiwi"

 When you install,
 Choose CUSTOM installation, Not Upgrade. this way you have a full install. which  puts everything you have currently on your system into file  C Windows.old  You can access it after.   Disconnect from internet before it finishes. You MUST disable automatic updates before you re-connect Becuse if you don't the first that happens is that Microsoft downloads an update file  KB971033. If this file is downloaded, installs & runs, it will nullify your o/s.
To change it go to >CONTROL PANEL >
SYSTEM & SECURITY>WINDOWS UPDATE>CHANGE SETTINGS
Change from {Install updates automatically} to any other option of your choice.
I wish I would have known this before, because within the first minute I connected, MS downloaded that file first. I was lucky to catch it & delete it.
JUST be careful if you do download any updates from MS, that you don""t 
download KB971033."

,supanut2000,2010-08-12T01:51Z,"Omochao;
At least the loader uses bios trick to tell your copy of Windows that it is an OEM from like a DEL, HP, or other OEM brands.
Therefore, there is no way that Microsoft can blacklist OEM keys because they will detect a valid OEM certificate in the bios.
But my question is
If I install a dual boot between XP and 7, will I have to add 7 to the boot.ini manually? or will XP smart enough to detect another Windows NT operating system and add it to the boot.ini.
Also if I use a loader to activate Windows 7, will it kill my dual boot?"

,supanut2000,2010-08-13T03:49Z,"Here is how to use 7loader 5 by Orbit
1. Disable uac.
2. Run the exe file.
3. Once it's loaded, click select task button.
4. In the drop down list, select your computer's brand.
5. Click on install information 32 or 64 bit according to your system.
6. Click the option 2 button.
7. When the message box appears, press ok and then reboot.
Now you should have a genuine Windows 7.
About the torrent being watched by Microsoft, I don't believe that. Mostly it is a fraud. Frauds often scare users with scary warnings that isn't true at all eg the one mentioned here is a good example of fraud. Microsoft never tracks torrents, and they never care about torrents.
PS. I'm not sure if this loader will work for linovo users since MS had blacklisted the oem key 22tkd...if you use Linovo, then this loader might not work for you, but it could also works since the loader uses a bios trick."

Like what I said, if you follow my instructions on how to use 7loader correctly, then your 7 will be genuine.

Run virtual cone drive or another mount program. Then mount the iso you want x86 or x64.Start running the setup. Dont worry about your files all windows will do is move them to a new folder. Let it restart and the setup will continue from then onwards!

Hope that helps you"

Then once the extraction was done I clicked setup and followed what it popped up. Like if I should use Updates or Not or what Hard drive I should use. Then once you are all done with that stuff Windows 7 will 100 percent work but you will still have a windows.old folder. that is Windows xp. In order to completely delete that I installed unlocker and it removed it and freed some space. But before you do that take whatever files you need and drag them to your desktop or w/e. 
Windows 7 iso works great 10/10 extremezone.

"
,Hippiehomer,2010-09-10T21:30Z,"Straight forward and simply torrent and easy to install. I tried to upgrade it but it wouldn't work so I just did a clean install. Here is what I did:

Step 1: After downloading the files use ""Img Burn"" to burn the ISO files to a ""DVD-R"": http://download.cnet.com/ImgBurn/3000-2646_4-10847481.html

Step 2: Keep in mind that during a clean install you will be deleting every file including the Windows 7 torrent so you will have to use another ""DVD-R"" to burn the activators to, you don't have to use ""Img Burn"" to do this. 

Step 3: Unplug your internet or switch off your LAN button on your laptop to disconnect from the internet for the duration of the install. Insert the ""DVD-R"" disk with ""Windows 7"" burned on it, the installation screen will automatically open up if you followed the directions correctly. Follow the directions that adhere to your computer. Select ""Custom Installation"" to do a clean install, again all of your files will be deleted, back them up if you need to.

Step 4: After about 30-60 Minutes Windows 7 will be installed. Remove the ""Windows 7"" DVD-R and insert the DVD-R where you burned the ""Activators"" to when your computer has fully loaded ""Windows 7"" for the first time. A screen will pop up and you will have to MANUALLY open the activator. Follow the directions on the activator and you WILL have a genuine OS. Remember to do this as soon as you reach the Windows 7 desktop. 

Step 5: Congrats, you have done it ;) 

*Some computers such as a Dell will require a different method of installing a brand new OS. If you own a Dell which has ""MediaDirect"" you will have to insert the ""MediaDirect"" disk first and follow the directions to partition the drive. You don't have to do this but just in case anyone wants to know. I'm not sure about other computers but read your manual just in case. "

After a lot of tinkering I got a tool that made a booter(as in a small OS) for discs made from ISOs. Once I burned one disc with this program loaded in the front sectors it loads both set of discs (32/64 bit). That got me through the first pass of the disc, but upon reboot I had to change the disc to one that was created from the ISO sector for sector, without having the program appended to the front. I still am unsure why I had to go this route, but so far all is good, including updates. 

Before I started to install I ran SpinRite, then another hard drive program called Hard Drive Regenerator- Then I had to Partition a hard drive before using the very first windows disc that had the small os installed at the beginning. This was the ONLY way I could get Windows 7 to install on this machine and the bios had nothing to do with it, which rather surprised me.

2 weeks, so far so good. I fully expect things to be black balled soon, but I'm ready and keeping all important files on an external HD."

,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-04T08:04Z,"Thanks Frogie.

Turns out I had used v1.91 by Daz so I researched what the programmer said in another said he he claims it is FINE for people that already activated with his previous activators/loaders to go ahead and run v 192 - by Daz as it will make sure your computer has the newest technology from this programer. It appears v 192 by Daz came out in Mid September. Almost 5 weeks for me, it sure is good to read that another person has gone for a year running this stuff!

I have FULLY UPDATED by Microsoft, EXCEPT for that well known KB 97 update that has the sole purpose of trying to defeat these loaders etc. 

As fast as Windows 7 is selling LEGALLY I would think many will be able to get away with copying down a friend's Win 7 key (with permission of course lol) - I knew many that got away with using their friend's product keys, such as the OEM stickers on the outside of desktops. It seems Microsoft looks for the big players first, the serials being abused by tons of people first. As long as they keep selling Windows 7 at the record rates I would think they will have plenty of $$ to be happy, and lets hope a crack down might be the last thing they care about. After all, many people are like me and are unemployed and can not afford to pay for the program if I had too.

I have mistaken other version for this one, but the file size AND name tell me that THIS is the one I know the best. I hope all that have any activation issues, err say none activation issues, that they share their information here so the loader's programmers can get a heads up."

"" ubasolja at 2010-10-03 01:00 CET:
When I try to install this on a new system its been stuck ar ""Expanding Windows Files"" at 60% for like two hours, has this happened to anyone else?""

My Effort at Answering:

Ok, first make sure you have clean DVD instal discs. Burn them as slow as you can and VERIFY the data. 

Next if this same problem repeats with good disc burns you know it is not your discs or else 2 zillion users would not be on this torrent.

Next step is to remove install discs and examine your hard drive. Their are two great programs, very small in size that will scan the surface on the hard drive at a low level and you can regenerate a sector if you get lucky. Try SPINRITE and HARD DRIVE REGENRATOR- Actually Regenerator scans ans fixes sectors faster than slow SpinRite, but SpinRite has been around for something like 16 to 20 years I think. If you get a bunch of bad sectors on either of these two programs it is a sign your hard drive is on it's last leg. If you have anything on the drive you can save do it, but Im guess it is too late. The hard drive programs are non destructive. --- If you are burning a clean install from and ISO of the torrent above AND your hard drive is fine, it suggests a more serious issue.

Anytime a computer locks up there can be many reasons as to why, and sometimes serious ones such as motherboards and power supplies going bad.

If it is your hard drive remember they are pretty inexpensive these days (less than most versions of Windows 7! and the newer laptops and notebooks are being made now where a couple screws removed will lead you straight to them with no mess. Last- Make sure you don't have too much first/dust inside clogging up the air vents resulting in too hot of a hard drive after the machine is on for awhile.

Good Luck."

,melgail,2010-11-16T17:37Z,"Hi, having some problems getting this to work.
I've burnt the ISO to a disk using PowerIso at 4x like you've stated. 

Once I re-start my comp and try to have it boot from the CD, it takes me to a screen where it says Windows is loading files, then to the Windows 7 start up screen and doesn't move any further then that.

I've tried doing it from my computer, doing and upgrade from the disk and a clean install. Neither works. 

I don't know if it's a problem because I already have Windows 7 on my computer or not. I accidental updated this copy and now trying to do a clean install, still doesn't work.

Can someone help me? I've got a older dell."

You will need to use a newer version of the loader as it seems most of the product keys are no longer valid from the original loaders in this torrent.

Was only a matter of time...

A quick search for Windows Loaders can score you v1.9.5 which is flawless.

If you have attempted an earlier ""Load"" with a different program you will need the WAT fix also.

Run these as administrator (I made that mistake) if you haven't set your permissions yet on this fresh install.

,Sogeking,2011-01-22T16:27Z,"Im new with this, andi have a question. Can you update from vista to 7 with this? or do i need to uninstall vista and then install this?"
,jtom1,2011-01-22T21:02Z,@sogeking basically you download this. Then burn it to a cd or dvd matters by what player your computer has. Then you put the disk in your computer and restart the computer. Your computer would start the installation automatically and it will remove vista. So if you want to save your stuff put it in a flash drive or a disk
,pique3,2011-01-22T21:11Z,Is there anyway to do this with linux ubuntu? I want windows due to games and other things which I use.

I've burnt it to cd using brasero but when I try and boot using cd it just flashes for a while and then loads up ubuntu after a few minutes.

1) I have one hard drive with 3 seperate partitions.
1 has my current OS 'vista ultimate' and other 2 are games and media shizz like that.
If i install w7 and wipe Vista ultimate, will it only wipe that partition or will it wipe out my other 2 aswell?

2) What is the difference between x86 and x64?
I have an AMD 955cpu 4gig ram and 6950, will my pc be compatible with x86?

,Firedog118,2011-01-28T19:22Z,"@benboi.ph
I upgraded from Windows Vista Home Basic, and I had Lightscribe and stuff, like you. DON'T worry. First of all, you are given the choice of a ""Normal"" install where it keeps everything on your PC, or a ""Custom"" install (I did this) where it wipes everything. When I first turned on the my PC after doing the custom install, I didn't have any drivers, but they're all free. So here's the steps I took to solve it:
1. Click the Windows button in the bottom left of the screen.
2. In the ""search files and folders"" area, type ""Device Manager"".
3. Click on the first search result.
4. Go down each item in the list, right click and select ""Update..."".
5. This will fix all your driver problems.

Then,
1. In the same search bar, ""Windows Update"".
2. Select the first result.
3. It will automatically scan for every update, and you'll get a lot, including Lightscribe and many other programs that you already had. Including about 30 Language packs, which I don't see any reason to install unless you want or need them.
4. Problem solved.

Of course, if you do a normal install, you won't have to go through any of these steps."

You DON'T need an activation key, simply skip that part and it tells you that you have 30 days to activate Windows. Then when you've then managed to sort out your PC, use one of the Activators included in the download.
I haven't activated mine yet, so I can't tell you which ones work, sorry."

@Damp_  x86 is the 32 bit version good for single core cpu and older systems.
In your case it doesn't really matter, x64 allows for higher ram ammounts of 4 Gig or higher to be recognized/used by windows. 
@ zeeevil remove wat or NOWAT is a must use tool for windows 7. it removes the software that makes windows check for genuine validation completely and thus opens the possibility for updates without trouble.

,Butterbatter,2011-03-05T20:40Z,"Thank you, renton10. Your answer was both clear and correct. Indeed, as renton10 has stated, if you have an OEM code then it will be ok. Mine was fine, as was a friends. We both had OEM-included codes and SP1 installed correctly. renton10 FTW"

,ivcdawg,2011-04-04T22:02Z,"Instructions/Notes for the N00bz:

1) Download the .iso
2) Mount it using Daemon Tools Lite
3) Install it
4) DO NOT enter a CD KEY (not needed); simply deselect ""Activate online"" and click ""Next."" 
5) Load ZLoader and follow the steps (it will instert a master CD key for you)

Also, I concur (agree) about the "" kb971033"" windows update.  You can safely download ALL of them EXCEPT  kb971033 as that one will invalidate your Windows.  I accidently downloaded it and had to reinstall my OS (no joke).

1) Go to Windows Update (bottom right corner of task bar)

3) Select ""hide update""

This will prevent you from accidently installing it like I did.  The other updates, to my knowledge, are fine.

If you can find one get a good activator for windows 7 / vista, one activated check if it has given you an OEM activation code ie your code should have OEM in it this means it is a manufacturers code generator and if black listed would blacklist all their legitimate customers you will not need to worry about anti- piracy updates ect as you will always be confirmed as genuine good luck and happy huntting""

Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit has been running very smoothly for the last few months; it was pretty buggy at first but after some updates its pretty much sorted itself out.
I followed another persons instructions earlier and made sure that I had ""OEM"" somewhere in my product ID so that I am able to download all of the updates (even the ones I'm told to avoid) and I haven't had a problem with that method.

Thanks extremezone and friends for making Window$ affordable for the masses"

1. launch system repair
2. start windows normally

if I select system repair it freezes on a black screen with the curser in the centre. If I start normally it just loops back to the 2 options screen.

Did I do something wrong? Please help!

First of all I would like to say that this is an AMAZING download. It works perfectly and now I have Windows 7 Ultimate OS running perfectly on my laptop. 

Ok now I would really like to address some of these noob questions. 
1. Yes you can just run it from the download if you have winrar (This is what I did)

2. It works when installing to a new computer. Or freshly built one.

3. ITS FUCKING VIRUS FREE

4. To officially activate this you must use Hazar 7Loader 1.6.1d or Daz's Windows 7 Loader 1.7.0, if you dont your Windows 7 will remove its self after 30 days.

Hope that helped!

Thanks so much extremezone "

 This works as tried by myself on 7 Ultimate Build 7601.
 Uninstall Remove Wat/Loaders etc. Uninstall Update KB971033. Open elevated command prompt(Type cmd in search box, right click, Run As Administator). Type the following, EXACTLY ""slmgr -rearm"" (without the "").
 Hit enter.
 Close Cmd prompt. Reboot TWICE. This should remove the Non Genuine notice. Now set your desktop background. (Right click desktop, select Personalize, etc) Go into updates and HIDE KB971033. That should be it.
 Check in System. Should say Windows is Activated.
 I'm not saying do this instead of using Remove WAT....this is an alternative method, that's all. And it worked for me. "

There are 2 ISO files in this torrent, one is a 32bit version and the other is a 64bit version sizes 2.3GB and 3GB respectfully,  You only choose one of them, so it fits fine on a 4.7GB DVD
 (((Make sure you burn at slower speeds so there are no errors)))

ISO files convert to instillation disks either by burning them or mounting them to a virtual drive.  In this case you must burn it to a disk so it can be bootable.    


  (a USB flash drive might also work for some people) "
,Charlie117,2012-06-03T08:02Z,Can I update to SP1?
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-06-19T09:23Z,"This works fine, use the new v2 loader to activate.But it seems you do not get the option to update to SP1 with this version, how can we fix this?Then again why update to SP1 when this gets all the updates and works fine anyway?"
,Grave___Digger,2012-06-21T16:17Z,"Still using this since June 2009 (3 years) and it works GREAT!!! 

Aren't updating through Windows Update though... I'll wait for Windows 8 rather than updating to TONS of ""useless"" updates..."
,MariziLocky,2012-06-26T08:42Z,HEY!! :D this worked perfectly but I can't seem to connect to the internet...nor can I use my Fn key on my laptop to turn up my brightness or turn on my wireless adapter thingy. Example...on my laptop FN+F6 and F7 control the brightness...I simply cannot do that and FN+F8 controls if my wireless is turned on or not...doesn't work. PLEASE HELP!!
,MariziLocky,2012-06-26T08:49Z,"I've recently red the previous comments. But when I get to the stage after it has rebooted and shit, the username, password, time zone, etc...it doesn't even ask me where I am: Home, Places...etc IDK! It doesn't even give me that question!! SOMEONE HELP. I'm on my mac laptop too, I think this somehow has to do with the fact that I can't connect to the net!"
