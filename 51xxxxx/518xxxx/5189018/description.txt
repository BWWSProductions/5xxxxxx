Beat the Boots is a collection of bootleg recordings by Frank Zappa which were originally distributed illegally but were released officially by Rhino Entertainment in 1991. The recordings were available as individual CDs and as an LP or cassette box set. The eight discs included span a fifteen-year period from September 30, 1967 ('Tis the Season to Be Jelly) to May 21, 1982 (two tracks on As an Am).

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)

Say "thank you" by seeding... just seed, it is not harmful to your health:-)
