,drewkrew,2009-11-28T18:32Z,"Will try to allocate more bandwisth to you my friend... got a poor BT BROADBAND line, 8MB ADSL but it keeps lagging right down causing poor upload speeds...

Am doing my best lol!!!"

,mr_hacker,2009-12-06T21:24Z,"Hi. Thank you for making me able to watch this season of Ben 10 alien force. I had no idea that it was out until I looked it up and there it was 10 episodes out.

I would love it if you put out episode 11 too... and episode 12 when it comes out. It will be out in not a long time now.

I am so excited to see what's going to happen next!"

,mr_hacker,2009-12-28T12:47Z,"Great! I have already been able to download busy box, but I want to see trade off first... since that comes before?

Some people say that episode 11 is the alien swarm movie, but that can't be right since in episode 10, Kevin is still stuck in that messed up form and in alien swarm... he isn't...

Alien swarm might be episode 11 or something... as I figure that Kevin might get cured in the episode trade off..."
,mr_hacker,2009-12-28T12:48Z,woopsy... I did mean that alien swarm might be episode 12... and trade off episode 11...
,starout100,2011-05-28T20:43Z,hmmm al right cool only seeds!!!!!!!!!!
