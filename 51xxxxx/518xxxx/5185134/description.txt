    * Convert MP3s, OGG, FLAC and WMA files into other formats with       
      the Audio Converter                                                 
    * Create playlists and music mixes quickly and easily to suit any     
      occasion                                                            
    * Synchronize with iPods / MP3 players effortlessly and convert       
      tracks on-the-fly                                                   
                                                                          
    The standard version of MediaMonkey is free for personal use,         
    however, the more advanced Gold version adds a range of               
    functionality for more serious collectors. Some of the added          
    features included with MediaMonkey Gold are:                          
                                                                          
    * File Monitor - Automatically updates the Library any time you       
      modify, add, move, or delete a music file (within specified         
     directories), saving you from doing so manually.                     
    * Custom Filters & Views - Allow you to set up subcollections of      
      music (e.g. Kids Music, Classical Music, etc.) that have            
     different columns, nodes, and playback rules.                        
    * Advanced AutoPlaylists - Allow you to define a playlist based on    
      almost any criteria. For example, if you wanted music for a         
     party, you could have an AutoPlaylist that includes 100 Songs in     
      which Bitrate>=128 Kbps, Tempo= fast/veryfast, Year=1990-2000,      
      Rating>=4 stars, Genre=Rock. Advanced AutoPlaylists are also        
      especially useful for synchronizing with a Portable device as       
      they allow you to quickly choose which subset of tracks to          
     synch.                                                               
    * Auto-Conversion - Converts tracks on-the-fly from an unsupported    
      format as they are synced to a portable device or burned to a       
      CD/DVD. In addition, it levels volume on-the-fly, which is a        
      huge benefit for most non-iPod devices, and CD/DVDs.                
    * Automated Organization - Allows you to set up custom rules for      
      re-organizing tracks in the background.                             
    * Virtual CD - Allows you to keep track of what CDs you own and at    
      the same time see which subset of tracks from those CDs are         
     copied to your hard drive. Instead of tracking your CDs and          
     tracks separately, the virtual CD function gives you an              
     integrated view.                                                     
    * Unlimited MP3 encoding - Allows you to encode MP3s in an            
     unlimited fashion.
