DESCRIPTION:

There's little doubt that Bryan Adams devotees will delight in this 15-song, 55-minute offering from the raw-voiced singer-songwriter. More surprising is the likelihood that those with little interest in his work will also find much to admire here--surprising insofar as Adams, who despite a lengthy career and numerous hits is essentially a journeyman artist, adapts easily and impressively to the Unplugged format. The addition of some unusual instruments (mandolin, Irish pipes and whistles) and a string section conducted by Michael Kamen and composed of young players from Juilliard adds texture and interest to songs like "18 Til I Die" (with a fiery solo by one of the violinists) and "When You Love Someone." There are occasional missteps, and Adams's songs, while catchy, are hardly the world's most original. But by and large the singer, his band, and the supporting cast make this a very enjoyable ride.

Each episode of MTV Unplugged features artists of the pop or rock world laying down their amplifiers to present their songs acoustically, without the technological adornments associated with modern music. Many artists take the opportunity to present their songs in unfamiliar arrangements or to perform covers of songs that influenced their careers. In this particular episode, Canadian rocker Bryan Adams performs songs from across his career, stripped of their arena rock trappings.
