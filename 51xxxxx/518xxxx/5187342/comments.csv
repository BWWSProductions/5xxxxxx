considering your username and that you accuse me, I will leave the onus on you to prove your claims. Now, the fact of the matter is, and for a lot of data which you can happily examine, I would refer you to Lord Monckton and his film ""Apocalypse, no!"", where he lays out that Al Gore lied about the warming. He refutes in detail this carbon trader and mass murderer. So, if you wish to lay down an accusation, my suggestion is that you find a discussion forum somewhere, open a thread and invite me to discuss. Otherwise I don't want to hear from you again."
