Actor, writer, and comedian Dylan Moran has been making a
mark in comedy since the age of 20, when he tested his
skills at stand-up in the early '90s. This release encapsulates
all the sharp and witty sarcasm that has made Dylan Morans
style so distinctive. Recorded live during the incredibly
successful WHAT IT IS tour.
