,ilsennodipoi,2010-09-14T19:13Z,"I despair of peoples stupidity. Here someone has packed a 715 Mb file into a 722 Mb rar-file. The extra size while obviously making the packing effort futile is not the main problem. It also requires people to have a rar-unpacking utility (remember that people have different operating systems and this might be a hassle), it obscures the true identity of the content, it makes it impossible to download individual files (not an issue with this particular torrent but my beef is with stupid rar-packing in general), it also means that if you want to watch the content and seed at the same time you have to use twice the disk space meaning that people will prefer not to seed to save hd space."
,santana,2010-09-15T00:14Z,Thumbs up to ilsennodipoiÂ´s comment. What is it with you guys and .rar?!
,iamjew,2011-06-26T12:36Z,"Choice torrent. BUT
There is a place reserved in hell for every person who shares rar-'compressed' files. The only significant result of your misguided endeavours to conserve data (I'm assuming that's what you're going for) is to piss the living fuck out of people. If you are going to try compress/archive stuff, both of which are stupid ideas especially for this torrent, use a less retarded format.
Jesus!"

Thanks for the content though."
