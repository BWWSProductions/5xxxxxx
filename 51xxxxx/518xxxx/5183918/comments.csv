,Kanano,2011-04-23T22:07Z,"Yeah, don't bother with this piece of shit torrent. I had phenomenal speeds for a bit, up to 250 - 300 kbs. Then I hit 6.9% like everyone else and it completely stopped. The E.T.A is now on infinite, and when it's not on infinite, it's on 3 years or higher. It looks like 4 people have the entire torrent, but not a single one of them is seeding. THANKS Mila, and every other fucktard who downloaded this and then immediately stopped seeding. You guys are obviously well versed in that whole ""sharing is caring"" thing. 



If you want a better Lady Gaga discography torrent, go here:
