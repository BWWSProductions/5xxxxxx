Thank you so much for your sharing, I will seed like a msungu, in case there are more expat kids feeling nostalgic.
I see you haven't received a great deal of feedback for your torrents but there are a few people out there who appreciate your efforts."
,ripp1916,2009-12-16T15:03Z,"tooth, I am curious, anonymously of course, where is your place, what is your age? 
It may just be the sweet wine i've had tonight but you seem to have the same taste."

Thanks for the comment. My location is a little obscure. You can 'feel' my taste and sometimes you can even 'hear' me but unfortunatley you can't see me. Gimme your email addie and I'll drop you an email. Deal?

You say you're English-Jamaican. Here's a test for you: can you get me any album by Sanchez THE reggae artist? I've combed the TPB and I can't get anything on him...the closest I ever got was some porn from some guy with a similar name!!"

Sanchez album... none found sorry.
But my search didn't come out empty handed VA-Reggae_Hits_Vol.1-37 has 17 Sanchez tracks and a few others ft. Sanchez and 280 seeders atm. I'm selectively downloading it now :)
