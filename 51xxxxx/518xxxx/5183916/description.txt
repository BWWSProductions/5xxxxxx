Motley Crue: Live At US Festival San Bernadino.05.29.1983 mpg file. I'can't find the torrent for the this file so I'm seeding 
it again. It's a classic early Crue concert. The Crue is playing some of it's TOO FAST FOR LOVE & SHOUT AT THE DEVIL songs. 
It's Right before their second albulm SHOUT AT THE DEVIL came out. IT"S SOME FUCKING CLASSIC SHIT!
It's an mpg and (not)super quality but still have good enough 4 such
an old concert to have in your collection.
