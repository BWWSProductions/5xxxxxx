,neocorpse,2011-07-04T18:11Z,"I hope all of you running your pathetic little mouths get sent to prison and brutally ass raped while having multiple large cocks shoved down your throats. srredfire was just trying to warn us about possible legal action assholes.
You people should get off mommie's computer, go back to school and learn spelling and grammar you fucking waste of flesh troll cocksuckers.
Don't you fucks have better shit to do? Jesus H. Christ! Thanks for the heads-up srredfire, I was thinking of grabbing this but if it'll result in possible trouble I'll pass."
,Werm,2011-07-22T01:29Z,"thanks for the warning Srredfire. They are still tracking this after all these months at the demon, too. Don't need any more notices from the goon squad."
,PlatinumTiger,2011-07-22T02:09Z,"@neocorpse well his site is called piratebay for a reason and most of the sharing of files on here is illegal so people who are commenting saying thanks for the heads up, the name of the website should be your warning"
,4LoKo,2011-08-08T16:41Z,If I want to watch a movie I will watch it for FREE... Fuck the Police!
,Dr_Science,2011-09-12T05:42Z,"I have been trying to digitally backup my dvds that I own by dl-ing them here at pirate bay.  if the fed want to come get me I can simply show them my copy of the dvd that I bought for three dollars at walgreens.

but thanks for the warning."
,kane1314,2011-10-07T20:43Z,You could get charged (arrested) for downloading this? You think the fuckers would put their time into actually trying to catch real criminals and not threatening some young guy who just wants to watch a movie for free.  
,DreaD151,2012-03-20T15:38Z,i swear to god just dont seed or limit your seeding to 1 they cant trace all ips and if you know what your doin find the mofos ip thats watching and flood the old ports or do something jesus movie btw is a 10/10  jesus it was underrated.....
