,moshster,2009-11-26T23:07Z,Why would anyone want to go back to WMP 11?  WMP 12 is more stable and has improved DLNA and media library.
,ElgarL,2009-11-26T23:12Z,"It all depends on what you mena by improved?

WMP 12

Removed ID3 Tag editor
No support for NAS storage...
...unless you allow EVERY PC to index the drive and make a FULL copy of everything on it to the local drives.

Simply WMP 12 will not work for many users. In fact it will not read ANY media on my NAS drive unless I configure it for offline access and make TWO copies of everything."
,ElgarL,2009-11-26T23:14Z,"Just to add. I love every other aspect of Win 7. I even like the look and feel of WMP 12. It just doesn't work on my network, whereas WMP 11 works flawlessly."
,hplp20,2010-01-20T19:40Z,I tried opening it from the Administrator account as well as run it by clicking Run as administrator. Still says admin rights check failed. What do I do?

Thanks for posting this, will give it a try."
