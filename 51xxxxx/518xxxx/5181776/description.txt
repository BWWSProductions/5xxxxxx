Updated Auto Installer to remove WMP 12 and install WMP 11.

This torrent replaces the earlier one (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5179780/Windows_7_Downgrader_to_WMP_11), which had a bug preventing the Double click Fix from being installed.

You can run this over the original and update to the latest fixes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To return to WMP 12 after installing this, do the following...

Open Control panel
goto 'Programs and Features'
then 'Turn Windows Features on or off'
Find 'Media Features' and expand the entry
Untick 'Windows Media Player' (Also uninstalls Media Center as it relies on WMP).

Restart your machine

Go back to The same place and re-enable WMP and WMC.

Windows will reinstate Media Player 12.

Install elevated.
