    Rollercoaster Builder is a logical puzzle game. Your goal is to       
    build a Rollercoaster from one side of the screen making your train   
    able to collect the stars on the way, and reach the other side        
    without crashing. There are five levels, and all of them have five    
    stages, so you get 25 missions all together with constantly raising   
    severity. After finishing all the levels you can see your actual      
    High Score, which you can share online with others. You can replay    
    the game until you reach the perfect state and collect ALL the        
    stars. You can view a "replay video" after each finished stage.
