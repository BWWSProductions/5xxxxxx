,VarikasTD,2009-12-16T18:25Z,"Murlok, you rock! I had tried another PowerDVD torrent that was supposedly trusted but it had rootkits in it (avast and antivir alarmed constantly. I eventually just reinstalled the OS); yours was totally clean, thanks!"
[V],Murlok,2009-12-18T00:09Z,"VarikasTD  I lost my VIP twice since some guys reported me for that kind of stuff.Rule 1 not know how to use cracked apps do not download them!
If in doubt use http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5191178/Sandboxie.v3.42.WinAll.Incl.Keygen-CRD%28Murlok%29

Thx for comment anyway :)"
,BluRayPro,2009-12-18T04:29Z,"CyberLink PowerDVD Ultra 9 is a nice universal player with Blu-Ray support that I?ve used a lot in the past. That being said, there is a superior universal player called ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 also with Blu-Ray support. It can even play Blu-Ray M2TS with DTS audio which is impossible with PowerDVD. 

After discovering ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 I uninstalled PowerDVD. I suggest trying them both.

,ton1164,2009-12-18T16:26Z,thank you for Cyberlink_PowerDVD_Ultra.9.0.2320.
,topgundcp,2009-12-18T21:49Z,"Even though it works perfectly and thanks to Murlok.
However, I found this version has a bug that if you open a DVD stored on Hard disk then the MENU becomes inaccessible. Any body has the same problem ???"
,VarikasTD,2009-12-19T20:26Z,"Hi Murlok,

Sorry for the confusion, I meant YOUR torrent was CLEAN and the other was not. I like your releases. :)"
,nooob22,2009-12-29T13:20Z,"@stormprobe it seems you are right...this is no Ultra version since it lacks of the MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) feature which should be included in an Ultra version.
@Murlok please rebrand your torrent or release a proper version, thanks! "

My Translation/Install:
================
1. Ran setup.exe
2. Ran PDVD9U.Activator.exe 
3. Ran CyberLink.2320_R1(TaRe45)_DVD091117-01.exe
4. Ran PowerDVD9_Language Pack.2010_DVD090515-01.exe
5. Executed Offline_activ(x86).reg for 32-bit {use Offline_activ(x64).reg For 64 bit of OS}
6. Started PowerDVD9, activated by means of a corresponding supplied keys.
     (i.e. PowerDVD 9.0 Version Ultra and Ultra Advance Audio Pack)
7. Copied all the Skin .dll's to the app installation folder .....\Skins

Note: Did NOT install PDV9 Rus.exe

For the life of me I can't figure out how to get the additional skins to appear. So I did a test and 
renamed one of the supplied skins to BlackSatin.dll (renamed BlackSatin.dll to BlackSatin_ORIG.dll). 
The result was that I could see the new skin in the Settings preview window but once exited, it still
defaulted to the original if PDVD is restarted (no DVD selected). Anyone know how to make the Skins 
work properly ?  Not sure if it will make any difference anyway, as the controls seem to stay the same."
,Sailor420,2010-03-05T07:12Z,"Well after installing this at least 10x, which ddi work in all cases with exceptions.

As I mentioned I could never get the Skins to work, not a big deal.

But one thing that does effect my normal usage of PDVD9 is that the Next/Back buttons do not work when playing from the HDD. This was the reason for me installing it so many times. I finally tracked it down to the 2320 update. If you install the update let us know if you encounter the same traits I mentioned. I need the Next/Back buttons to work before creating a disc image to check my video editing.

Whats strange is that the created ISO image works perfectly if mounted with  DVDFab's NEW Virtual Drive (freeware) or similar VD tool http://forum.dvdfab.com/showthread.php?t=3248 ... the Next / Back buttons work find playing a DVD or ISO .... but do NOT work when playing IFO/VOB structure from the HDD.

PDVD9 crashed on me a few times as well, reboot needed. But I thing the install was bad, didn't clean the registry after uninstall

THX for the upload Murlok, I just use it without the 2320 update.
