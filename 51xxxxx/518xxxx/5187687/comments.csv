,dmc081,2010-03-14T11:45Z,isn't the size needs to be 632.81mb? cause thats what the original is on the trial
[V],thethingy,2010-03-14T16:57Z,"^^^, dmc081 your confused, go back under your rock and have a sleep, when your refreshed look on the microsoft website again."
,Arctic1972,2010-05-08T13:31Z,This software is compromized. It`s not approved when you trying to register it at Microsoft.
,hasbeenhonshu,2010-05-10T02:37Z,"This file downloads fine, burns to DVD fine, installs fine - and that is the end of fine.

I tried both techniques for activation:

1) The first method ends up with the robot on the other end of the line telling you to hold on and a customer assistant needs to help. You will not have the chance to tell anything or body that this is for installation of one computer.

2) The second method is absolute malarky as the mso.dll file is already in the prgram files/ common files/ shared/ office12 folder and no where else so you cannot bloody well copy it into that folder.

Now I wanted this to work and after five hours I got spit, so I either did something wrong in the list of instructions which can be interpreted in various ways or nobody has got this program to activate. Please respond if you have successfully got this program to activate with the provided methods.

Thanks"
[V],thethingy,2010-05-25T12:59Z,"hasbeenhonshu, You replace the dll file you fool, the dll file has the same name but its diferant, i wish people would read instructions b4 moaning"
,jmk13,2010-06-10T08:41Z,"Thanks heaps, worked like a charm using the mso.dll method. "

,Evenol,2010-08-03T17:10Z,"Hey thethingy. Awesome torrent tbh! Works like a charm.

Just wondering, can I use Windows Update to get the new updates for Outlook 2007, and add the dll. file after again?

Because I got an error message when I had updated it with WU. So I had to uninstall and install it again, and now I haven't tried to update it yet incase the same happens. But I haven't tried adding the dll. file after I have run WU. Hoping for an answer. Best regards, Evenl."
,jack28vs,2010-09-03T16:28Z,"Looks like Microsoft has caught up. Just tried to do the phone activation and the voice said ""you seem to have been the victim of piracy!!!"" when I entered the eight sets of six numbers. 

Yeah right - I'm the victim!! LOL

I'm going to try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5158216 now"
,jack28vs,2010-09-03T21:26Z,"Update -

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5158216 worked perfectly.

Thanks thethingy!!"
,justine.justine,2010-10-11T17:01Z,Where do I copy the MSO.DLL file FROM? It is nowhere to be found...??
,cmo999,2011-02-27T04:45Z,Would not install.  At about 75% I get an error message saying that it is missing a source file.
,Wayne78,2011-03-08T21:07Z,"Thanks for this. Works very well, very well indeed."
,spacerace,2011-09-24T23:22Z,"thethingy Since you have placed this Torrent, MSHIT has officially Black Listed the Activation Via Phone. (Not your Fault) But seeing how there is no Outlook 2007 PK included & you can not find one on the bay. Could you or anyone add a valid PK (needed to Activate with Valid serial.) Actual Instructions...MSO.DLL

1. Install any Office 2007 app. 

2. Enter the Serial (not a trial serial).

3. Copy the mso.dll to;

C:Program FilesCommon Filesmicrosoft sharedOFFICE12

4.Replace file when prompted

5. Open the Office 2007 Application you have just installed.

6. Click Activate by Phone. Pick your Country.

7. Fill all of the empty boxes with zeros so it looks
like this: 00000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000 

9. Click Activate. and it will tell you it's activated.
Really once again Thanx for all your commitment to P2P. "
,neurypra,2012-03-14T13:37Z,"the second method on piratebay isn't working, any other links?? Thanx"
