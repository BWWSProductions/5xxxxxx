Presently based out of Atlanta, Georgia, USA and Miami, Florida, USA, Torche have been playing together since 2004 following the disbanding of long-time sludge veterans Floor. The band has since gone on to release two full length records and has toured with Mogwai, Kylesa, Isis, Jesu, Boris, Pelican, Harvey Milk .

In early 2007, Torcheâ€™s â€œS/Tâ€ CD/LP was remastered and re-issued with a bonus track in the states by Robotic Empire and in Europe by Rock Action (Mogwaiâ€™s respective label). In 2007 they also released â€œIn Returnâ€ CDEP/10â€ on Robotic Empire. The bands new full length, entitled â€œMeanderthalâ€ is out now on Hydrahead Records.

This tape is released by Ricky from Torche's tape label RCP, exclusively distributed by Hydrahead. 

Before TORCHE were recording their masterpiece of an album, Meanderthal, they were completely unorganized and quickly trying to scramble for material to put the album together. This recording, engineered by Torche's own Jonathan Nunez, documents the band pre-Meanderthal showcasing seven rougher, rawer, heavier and slightly different versions of tracks later recorded at God City with Kurt Ballou. An essential for any serious Torche fan... and the unserious ones too."
