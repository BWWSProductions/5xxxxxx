,jiveclive,2009-11-28T23:16Z,"I lost a wife once. It was at a mall in Annapolis, MD. USA. I searched and searched and searched for her. More then three hours! With other people helping me. But it was no use. We didn't find. 

Finally I gave up and decided to go home to celebrate. And there she was. She had been home already for almost two hours. Worse day of my life.

,Hatchet_Harry,2009-11-29T08:45Z,"Great torrent, V-10 A-10
Great movie too"
,godswallops,2009-11-29T11:23Z,"A:10 V:10 M:9

Been waiting for this - excellent work, thanks."
,weemikey,2009-11-29T13:42Z,cheers bo the wee murlok!
,societymike,2009-11-29T16:42Z,"wow, that was a GREAT movie!

M - 10
A - 8
V - 6.5

I had to give it a realistic quality rating, those above that said 10 for a/v must have watched it on an iphone screen. watching it on my big screen you can see it was low quality. However, it's very watchable, but probably worth the wait for better quality."
,tippeetom,2009-11-29T17:56Z,"thanks, A7 V8. not bad quality but i will probably re-download when dvdrip comes out

Thanks murlok been trying to find a copy of this for ages"
,patrickeeee,2009-11-30T01:18Z,"Thanks for the up, Murlok. "
,Phatfish,2009-11-30T18:43Z,"Better than I thought it would be but still pretty weak plot and some corny shit going on. Really good acting and decent cinematography makes it entertaining though.

Thanks!"
,Hatchet_Harry,2009-11-30T19:31Z,"I've watched this on a 50"" plasma and it's a great avi. There was no artifacts to speak off, considering how small the d/l is! The sound is only 2 channels but there was still plenty of bass. Can't wait to see what Murlok does with a 5.1 version."
,iray8t,2009-12-01T11:51Z,"Great movie. A bit along the plot line of Gran Torino, but *much* darker.
Video: 10
Audio: 7 - if only because there are a few, but crucial inaudible passages... but that's probably also true on the master copy.
This film could really benefit from English subs. But none are to be found for the moment on any of the usual sites."
,3_3_3,2009-12-01T23:10Z,"great movie, streamed perfectly to xbox"
,totoro777,2009-12-02T22:16Z,English subs anyone???
,wrileys2,2009-12-04T00:23Z,"V=9
A=7
Very watchable, a bit hard to understand if you're not British, but good movie..."
,MrNicePenizzz,2009-12-07T15:14Z,""" ... a bit hard to understand if you're not British, but good movie ...""

What a nonsense, you really dont need to be from the Uk to understand the message of this movie. This is pretty universal and therefore one of the strongest points why people will like this.

Will buy it 4 sure !"
,shiatt85,2009-12-21T15:18Z,Hi thanks very much for the altra fast download murlok. Its downloaded in 51 fob files. I'm new to all this so can someone help me so i can convert it and put it into 1 file please?
,Xvon54nt4cruzX,2009-12-27T10:36Z,"shiatt85 open 1 of the files with winrar, extract it, then watch your film, you may need VLC media player or similar to watch. :o)  "
,shiatt85,2009-12-29T19:58Z,thanks 4 the advice Xvon54nt4cruzX it worked and i converted it with convert x to dvd and burnt it to disc. THANKS AGAIN MATE
,laz9,2010-02-11T12:41Z,I am an american and I speak english....It is my native tongue...So why are other Americans asking for a movie that is in english to have english subs????...Other than being deaf I can not think of any reason that an english speaking person needs english subs for a movie that is in english.....lol....Thats funny stuff....hahahahaha
