Thanks for the post, but plz give some more info on this torrent. Is there 6 channel audio? Aspect ratio? etc.."

There certainly is :)

Also, video res is 720*288 @ 25fps - it's a DVD rip."
,LSmok3,2010-01-03T00:40Z,"Hi, I just finished downloading this and had to go and download the CCCP codec pack for the mkv format. Having installed it, unfortunately I have very serious problems with the audio: the whole film is totally distorted, with tons of white noise and nothing can be made out. Is there a setting I have to tweak somewhere that will sort it out or is anyone else having the same problem? Appreciate any help with this, it looks good and I'd like to be able to hear it. . . "

Not sure what would cause that - Get VLC mate, shouldn't have any problems, nice player too:

,LSmok3,2010-01-04T22:08Z,"Yeah, VLC seems to fix the problem and the film plays without any trouble; however, before I tried it I went on a forum for mkv troubleshooting and was advised that Vorbis is highly unsuited to anything other than 2 channel audio, so you might prefer to try using a different codec for anything like that in future to avoid issues. 

Thanks for the up, btw. Great film. "
