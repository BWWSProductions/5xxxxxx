By the way, the track ""Girl Girl Girl"" was replaced by the immortal ""Da Da Da - Ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nich - Aha Aha Aha"" on the USA version of the album (I still have the cassette!), so you can always find a download of that hit and replace it.

And you can actually find album cover art (just the front) at Google Images.

Thanks for the nostalgia rush, and great job of transferring from vinyl!
