,Zephfire,2010-01-19T18:52Z,"cloclo82:
what i know, you cant install it on a none jailbroken iPhone.

but jailbreak is really easy and you can restore your iPhone so it is not jailbroken anymore."

Vet inte tyvärr. Fungerar på min. Har själv 3.1 och har inte uppdaterat den ytterligare för jag läste något om problem så fall."
,honningfisk,2010-02-21T01:42Z,"Can't make it work on my jailbreaket iPhone 3 Gs.
I have got the program to iTunes but when trying to sync it says  cannot install becuse of unknown probleme (0xE8008001). This happens after 8 minuts of installing...

Is it because it is the version 3.1.3 ?"
