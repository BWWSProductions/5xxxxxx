and yet another release! :)

Another custom tag from me, this basically  means the same as my [complete+] but for oneshots (i.e. a oneshot + some form of bonus content, in this case a parody oneshot/ sequel based on the main one). This is just a small filler release before i do my main release for tonight, for the main release im currently considering Battle Angel Alita if i don't get a req for something else. :)

As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. Nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. Credits pages and possibly some fan art could be included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.

summery (From baka-updates manga who in turn attribute it to ADV)

A mysterious creature has fallen from the sky and landed right at young Yuina's feet! Branded as the master of this new angelic being, Yuina is forced into an otherworldly pact, one that will take her beyond the clouds and into battle against a new and yet hauntingly familiar evil, one that patiently waits in the shadows.
