,molebasher,2009-11-29T15:43Z,many thanks for your continued hard work. will continue to seed to at least a ratio of 7.0 on all new torrents and if anyone needs seeds on the older ones let me know. will get them back on and seeding when requested. i dont check this site that frequently so please send any requests for seeds to my e-mail (molebasher@hotmail.com) and will sort them out. that'll give dimlan a break and let him continue feeding us such excellent torrents
