To some, Jethro Tull will always be associated with Ian Anderson's flute playing and more rocking, arena-worthy moments. Like Led Zeppelin, Tull was all about balancing their sonic mood swings, as they could effortlessly transform between being loud & proud rock & rollers to more tranquil folksmen in the blink of an eye. 

The 2007 compilation, The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull is quite self-explanatory, as the 24-track set focuses solely on the "unplugged" side of Tull. But some of Tull's finest moments were acoustic guitar-based,including such early classics as "Mother Goose," "Skating Away (On the Thin Ice of the New Day)," and "Fat Man" (here's a fun game to play: the next time you watch the movie Boogie Nights, try to spot the scene that uses the latter song). And while the never-ending title track from Thick as a Brick is primarily a rocking prog number, its intro is certainly one of Tull's finest acoustic moments, and is included here. However, The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull isn't just about the early-'70s era, as it includes selections from all eras, including such forgotten or oft-overlooked tracks as "Jack in the Green," "Weathercock," and "One Brown Mouse."

If you Like Tull. You would love this one.
