Jean Amoureux founded his first children's choir at a holiday camp in 1946 under the name "l'Alauda", which would eventually become Les Petits Chanteurs d'AsniÐ¸res after several name changes. In 1947 he organized the choir with the name "Patronage of Gresillons". In 1948, the choir had a new look and another new name: "Les Rossignols de Saint-Jean" wearing a uniform similar to the scouts. 

The choir made its first television appearance in 1951, and later performed its first major concert with Les Petits Chanteurs Ð° la Croix de Bois under the direction of AbbÐ¹ Maillet. Many of the boys fell ill during its first overseas concert to Canada and the United States in 1957, plunging it into debt for the next three years. The choir also changed its name again to "Petits Chanteurs de l'Ile-de-France". They faced legal prosecutions and disaster until they regained their popularity and success in 1960. 

The choir was reaching new heights. They would go on to win The competition "l'Ange d'Or" several times. they made many television apperances and sound recordings with stars like John Williams, Nana Mouskouri, France Gall, Michel Legrand, and Sacha Distel, and every summer toured in another country including Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, England, Ireland, Jersey, Austria and Germany. 

In 1968, the city of AsniÐ¸res began supporting the choir and enabling the development of the music and diverse social and cultural activities. The choir became known as Les Petits Chanteurs D'Asnieres en Ile-de-France. 

In 1970, Jean Amoureux started a new musical project with members of Les Petits Chanteurs D'Asnieres en Ile-de-France, called Les Poppys which became a huge success. Other spinoffs from this choir were "Abracadabra" in 1983-1984, the "New Poppys" in 1988, and "Mercredi Libre" in 1992, none of which achieved the success of Les Poppys. 

In 1996, the choir became known as "Les Petits Chanteurs D'Asnieres et Les Poppys" or "Petits Chanteurs de l'Ile-de-France".
