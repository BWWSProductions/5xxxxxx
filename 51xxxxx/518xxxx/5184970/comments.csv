,freebird2898,2010-04-11T08:00Z,"This contains some of the cream of goa trance... For those who think goa is just psycho shit, well give this a shot.
You may find its actually very well developed and intricate music. "
,karan129,2010-05-28T11:39Z,"there's a naming error in the torrent. track #29 should be Analog Pussy - Go Wacko and not Analog Pussy - Solipse Technology. Sorry about that, had tracks 2 & 3 from their album mixed up."
,dyslexicdesktop,2010-09-27T07:04Z,"Must say, nice collection. Shoulda slipped in some 1200 Micrograms though. ;) haha

Thx for the upload M8"
,karan129,2010-10-10T04:32Z,"Thanks :) Well 1200Mics is more psy, Israeli full-on style, so it wouldn't really go here."
