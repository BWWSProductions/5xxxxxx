Thanks a lot"
,maemond,2009-12-25T08:47Z,Do you have a collection of 2008 to current songs?  I have a cavs unit and the hard drive failed.  So I lost all the songs on there and Cavs wants me to re-buy them ($900 or so).  So I have to resort to other methods to replace my collection.  I have all the older music up to about 2007.  So whatever you have would be most appreciated.  Thanks.
