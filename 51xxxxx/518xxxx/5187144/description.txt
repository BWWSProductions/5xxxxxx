The Chinese Burn EP was the first shot at a comeback by Curve, who spent much of the mid-'90s in limbo. While they were away, Garbage popularized a sound that was remarkably similar to Curve's fusion of drum loops and shoegazing indie-pop. In light of Garbage's success, Curve has decided to delve deeper into dance, as Chinese Burn attests. Six of the eight tracks are mixes of the title track, all of which are quite different from each other, but not necessarily compelling. "Chinese Burn" itself is a strong comeback, a tight exciting rush of sound, but the other two tracks are standard-issue Curve. Still, the EP bodes well for the forthcoming full-length comeback.
