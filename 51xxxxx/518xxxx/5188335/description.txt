    â€œNirvana headlining at Reading in 1992 was something you had to see, and if you didnâ€™t see it then it was something you pretended you saw.â€ --Kerrang (October 2003)

   â€œThe staggering energy and intensity radiating from the stage never let upâ€¦ Cobainâ€™s ravaged pop songs coming off like some dream marriage of the Sex Pistols and the Beatles, borne on bracing waves of distorted guitar noise.â€ --Rolling Stone (October 29, 1992)

   Ranked #1 in Kerrang Magazineâ€™s â€œ100 Gigs That Shook The Worldâ€ and voted as â€œNirvanaâ€™s #1 Greatest Momentâ€ by fans in an NME poll, Nirvanaâ€™s historic August 30, 1992 headlining appearance at the UKâ€™s Reading Festival is one of the most bootlegged concerts in the annals of rock n roll. Now, fans have an opportunity to own a pristine copy of that entire performance -- color-corrected video from the original film with audio sourced from the original multi-track masters. 'Nirvana: Live at Reading' will be issued in a limited edition CD+DVD Deluxe Edition as well as DVD-only, CD-only configurations on November 3, 2009, followed by a 2LP version on November 17, 2009.

   While the showâ€™s centerpiece was a performance of nearly the entire 'Nevermind' tracklist, also noteworthy were early performances of three as yet unrecorded songs which wouldnâ€™t be released until 2 years later on 'In Utero': "All Apologies,â€ â€œDumb,â€ and in its first ever public performance, â€œTourettes." The career-spanning setlist also reached back to the bandâ€™s 1989 Sub Pop debut album, Bleach, for â€œBlew,â€ â€œAbout A Girl,â€ â€œSchool,â€ â€œNegative Creepâ€ and first single â€œLove Buzz" (DVD only), and even further back to the mid-â€˜80s for â€œSpank Thru.â€ Other songs from the Reading set would appear in studio form on the Incesticide compilation later in the year: â€œAneurysm,â€ â€œBeen A Sonâ€ and â€œSliver.â€ Additionally, the band played a pair of beloved covers by two bands that helped shape the formative Nirvana sound â€“ â€œThe Money Will Roll Right Inâ€ by Fang and â€œD-7â€ by The Wipers.
