,ariesgirl,2009-11-28T00:05Z,"Hello Twenty ,

great to see you stayed on .
Cheers Tam"
[V],twentyforty,2009-11-28T07:04Z,"vicerock, PLEASE, do not move my torrents to ""Handhelds"" category. Please.
I have no idea why you have done it...
I just have moved in from ""downed"" mininova, I do not need anyone to tell me what to do, especially without my consent. I have 300 000 downloads every month, I expect to be found by my ""audience"", people who are lost in this mess.

As the file-name says, [PC Mac XboX PS3 ipod] where ipod is on the last place, it is possible to play such file on ipod, it is good, ipod compatible encoding and that's all.

I DO NOT encode for Hanhelds exclusively and BTW, I will done it myself, right?

@Tam:
I am glad you've found me. I could stay here, IF moderators do their job properly.

Nice to see familiar people."

,moshster,2009-12-06T11:57Z,"Looks like right category to me too.  Anything that is targeted for consoles and portable devices should be in handheld.  People should know by now that handheld foramts can be played on consoles too but not necessarily the other way round, so handhelds is the right category."
