Release Date: 27 November 2009
Release Length: 01:28:52
Storyline: 'Shorts' is set in the suburb of Black Falls, where all the houses look the same and 
everyone works for BLACK BOX Unlimited Worldwide Industries Incorporated, whose Mr. Black's BLACK BOX is the ultimate communication 
and do-it-all gadget that's sweeping the nation. Other than keeping his parents employed, however, Mr. Black's BLACK BOX has done 
nothing for 11-year-old Toe Thompson, who just wants to make a few friends...until a mysterious rainbow-colored rock falls from the 
sky, hits him in the head and changes everything. The Rainbow Rock does Mr. Black's BLACK BOX one better: it grants wishes to anyone 
who holds it. Before long, wishes-gone-wrong have left the neighborhood swarming with tiny spaceships, crocodile armies, giant 
boogers...and outrageous magical mayhem around every corner. But it's not until the grown-ups get their hands on the Rock that the 
trouble really starts. Now Toe and his newfound friends must join forces to save their town from itself, discovering along the way 
that what you wish for is not always what you want.
Eleven-year-old Toe Thompson is the designated punching bag for the bullies of the suburban community of Black Falls, where his 
and everyone else's parents work for Black Box Industries, makers of the do-it-all gadget that's sweeping the nation. But during 
a freak storm, a mysterious Rainbow Rock, which grants wishes to anyone who finds it, falls from the sky. Suddenly, the neighborhood 
that Toe already thinks is weird is about to get a lot weirder. As the Rainbow Rock ricochets around the town - from kid to kid and 
parent to parent - wishes-come-true quickly turn the neighborhood upside down in a wild rampage of everything from tiny aliens to 
giant boogers. From Robert Rodriguez, director of "Spy Kids," comes a magical fantasy adventure told through a series of shorts that 
each brings to life the sometimes wonderful, often terrible, and totally out-of-control wishes that become far more than Toe and his 
neighbors ever imagined.
