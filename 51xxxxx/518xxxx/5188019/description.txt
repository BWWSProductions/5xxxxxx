The two CD set to accompany the programme. This CD set includes all 30 re-recorded (not live) tracks played miscellaneously throughout the 'playing the piano _out of noise 2009 world-wide tour. Ripped directly from the limited edition programme, booklet and CD set in FLAC.

Includes CD cover, named and numbered tracks.

This is not a breach of fan-hood, I am simply giving to the fans what they may not have had the opportunity to have! These re-recordings were not released as a single or album, so they are very limited in their existence. I hope that some people who saw Sakamoto live can now hear the songs they experienced at the show!

I hope you buy Ryuichi Sakamoto's new album 'Out of Noise' which is out now.
