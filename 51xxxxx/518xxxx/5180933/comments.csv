,_Ghost_Girl_,2009-11-26T21:18Z,"russian text, english ?"
,tibrusjer,2009-11-26T21:20Z,"?
It should work properly.
I played through the first level without any problems, then I made this installer."
,mrcunninghamster,2009-11-26T22:38Z,"I wouldn't normally say this but for gods sake people, please give a little back!"
,M4rkboy,2009-11-26T23:23Z,"Ok listen. As a vista 64 bit user it works fine, of course theres no multiplayer but if u want it for solo campaign it works fine, for me so far."
,jimsy89,2009-11-27T13:21Z,"Hey, installed and its work fine. I have installed it on vista. but after 5-6mins in the whole thing just crash or something.  Someone have any ideas?
NB.  dont comment this if you are not sure.
thanks:)"
,tibrusjer,2009-11-27T13:25Z,"Ghost Girl: I'm not sure if it's on Russian, the only version I've tested is the English one.

Maybe if you change the ""config"" file or something."
,jimsy89,2009-11-27T13:37Z,"The game is in english, i have played it before.  its works perfect.. but its just crash after 5 min in the game:/  its so sad"

Many thx

any chance of doing an easy one that works for Borderlands as ive been waiting for one that is easy and has no hassel but havent found it yet"
,gamato,2009-11-27T15:50Z,"Can't get halfway through the first scene because it crashes every couple of minutes.  Updated my drivers, but it didn't make a difference."
,tibrusjer,2009-11-27T16:44Z,"I'm not going to release many easy install torrents, since it's hard to get the .reg file to each game.

But I'm gonna try to release as many as possible to the hard to install scene releases.
__________________________________________

Yeah, I've heard of that crash thingie, but I'm sorry. There's no way I can help you since my L4D2 works flawlessly and I have nothing to try fixing it with.

But try to search for a new crack or something, may help."
,gamato,2009-11-28T01:53Z,"So . . . uninstalling the program also introduced a problem:   Now all my text is bold.  All filenames, all websites, etc.  Probably one simple setting that can fix this, but I don't know it or why the uninstaller would do this.  Ideas?"
,silvermax2k2,2009-11-28T04:08Z,"The game installs, and runs (install was very easy too) However the game randomly crashes anywhere from 3-10 mins in. "
,Greyn,2009-11-28T06:28Z,"same problem as Jimsy and silvermax. . . getting random crashes about 5 min into gameplay. . . it says it is due to DEP, but I have disabled it through command prompt and it still crashes. I'm using vistax64 Help please?"
,mark.taiwan,2009-11-28T06:28Z,I have experienced the same problem as silvermax2k2. disabling multi-core rendering and v-sync doesn't work.
,Chaosxx,2009-11-28T08:49Z,Do you guys know how to read? >.>
,mark.taiwan,2009-11-28T09:24Z,"To anyone deciding to try this torrent: uninstalling the game messes up your fonts, now almost all the text in my web browser are in italics. Still trying to fix. :p"
,Superuploader,2009-11-28T10:59Z,"Still crashes when i kill the witch. Probably random too, but i killed the witch before it happened.

Anyone know when the release of the fix is coming out?"
,SDWILLIA,2009-11-28T20:43Z,"Yes, it did the same thing for me.  Messed all my fonts, so I just did a system restore and it cleared everything up quickly.  I got to play the game twice for about 4 minutes each time, kept crashing.  Don't waste your time!"
,kg00668,2009-11-30T06:46Z,"I installed this game and it crashed several times, so I uninstalled it... After doing so it changed all my fonts on my browser / computer to bold / italicized, which fonts were changed by the install and is there a better fix than just restoring? (mine is turned off at the moment) 

Thanks to ANYONE for help!"
,rmbowie,2009-11-30T08:38Z,"Better be click & play all the other fucked up on me, can you run with steam? as a none steam game?! I do that with F.E.A.R. 2 np if so your the man:) "

,tibrusjer,2009-12-05T07:34Z,"Should work with everything.
I'm running Win7 and works. Can't see why it should be incompatible with XP."

,kecskegida,2011-09-21T19:54Z,"It's fucking buggy or I'm gay, coz i can't run it normally. 

It's okay that I can't play multiplayer, (I didn't actually wanted) but I can't play in single mode. Exactly I can be in game for about 60secs, and it escapes. 

So could you answer me, pls? I really want to play this game..."
