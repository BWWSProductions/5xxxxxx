,Kronman79,2011-03-26T22:12Z,Thanks Alot!!!
,cdbox1234,2011-08-04T21:21Z,thanks for uploading this in flac. i dont want to sound like those people who complain on torrents but the log file from these albums show that the selected output for the flac files is  128 kBit/s. these flac versions of the explosions in the sky albums are available to download at other places too. can someone please upload their discography in actual lossless format. i registered to this site specifically to make this comment. thanks
,qu13tcave,2012-01-05T01:07Z,"thanks, thanks, thanks for this FLAC! 

BTW cdbox1234 mentions the log files show this is really 128 kBits/sec. It's true the log files claim 128kbps through 320kbps. So I ran all the FLAC files through Audiochecker 2.0 to verify.

It reports every track except one, is CDDA. Track 6 on the bonus disc is MP3.

Download with confidence!"
