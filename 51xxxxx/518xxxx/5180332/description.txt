Christmas comes but once a year - and this time it's coming to Bikini Bottom! Living at the bottom of the ocean, naturally SpongeBob hasn't heard of Christmas. When sandy tells him about it in 'Christmas Who?' he is determined to spread the holiday joy and manages to get all the residents to write letters to Santa - except scroogy Squidward who is sceptical about the whole business... Just one of nine episodes in this hilarious collection brimming with Yuletide cheer.
