,SummerSouvenir,2009-12-15T20:04Z,"If you look I do have Roy Wood & Wizzard - I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday.
As for ""Another Rock n Roll Christmas"" I was under the impression this was done by Gary Glitter, which is on my complilation. 
I purposely left out the well known Christmas songs, which can be found any where. I wanted to list the rare songs, instead of the traditional boring songs, which tends to make people doze off.
I plan a volume 2 next year of more Christmas rarities, & I repeat ................. rarities.
Thank you for your constructive criticism, however, I am quite pleased with these songs.
Perhaps I should have named it The Ultimate Christmas Rarities, but most likely you would have found fault somewhere."
