,ghostchildnn,2009-11-30T19:45Z,"daMouse is talking shit!  Anyway, thanks for the up :o)"
,Sballs,2009-12-01T18:42Z,"Only now did I notice the cover art on this extended cut.  Why the hell do they have a giant gate hovering over the pyramid?  Maybe that is supposed to represent Earth's glyph?

Oh, and SG-1/Atlantis were great.  Universe is even better!"
,Otaku1,2010-01-10T23:06Z,Thank you _mungki_ quality +1.
,darksniper88,2010-02-04T21:48Z,"Stargate universe sux =/ 

too much drama and lame cast, eli is decent.

All this mushy mushy who-slept-with-who-drama love love doesn't fit into stargate category imo"
,Terratari,2010-06-04T00:10Z,"Stargate was a great Emmerich movie.
Especially with Kurt Russell.
In the serie he was replaced by Mc Gyver (Richard Dean Anderson) and Stagate became Gyvergate.
North American appearing aliens in mostly North American appearing forests combined with lame acting.

daMouse is absolutely right.

However, the subs included with this are missing a great deal of dialogue that's in other versions.  I can't seem to find one online that matches this release, so this release is somewhat incomplete."
,Temper013,2010-11-25T05:22Z,"Guess I spoke too soon.  Although this sub has the English parts as well, all of the Alien dialogue is included as well.
