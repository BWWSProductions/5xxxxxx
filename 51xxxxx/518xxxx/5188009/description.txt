i did not make this just uploaded it. it goes very nice with the last thing i uploaded (sneek v0.1). after you get a working nand emulation, you can use this program to install/uninstall the wads onto the virtual nand. it is very handy even if your not using it for nand emulation purposes. it can pack/unpack wads. and edit many things with a wad, also a great wad organizer for pc. after a full blown version of sneek is released, between this and sneek, you will never need a wad manager again.



ShowMiiWads is a 'Wad File Manager' for Windows.
It displays information about wad files, edits them and give a preview of the Banner and Icon.

ALSO: i forgot to put a common key in the folder. but there is an option to just make one in the program. so dont forget to do that. (wont be able to pack/unpack/edit wads without it.)
