Release Notes:

When Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo sang lovingly about rock bozos Kiss,
we forgave him as his band created two of the best albums of the
decade. A fair exchange. So it's with great regret that we pass on news
that the Californians now make Gene Simmons and co seem like
Baudelaire.

Well, not quite, but since the five-year gap between their second and
third records, Weezer have become both prolific and a near-parody of
themselves. While 2002's Maladroit breathed life into the notion that
Cuomo could re-establish himself as one of the great rock songwriters
of his generation, it was followed by the dreadful pop-punk of Make
Believe and last year's garbled â€˜red albumâ€™, their third self-titled
LP. This is a band in decline and, as if to prove it, they've made
Raditude.

Recorded with a mix of other songwriters including Jermaine Dupri,
Jacknife Lee and the All-American Rejects' Nick Wheeler, this is a
strange album indeed. Let us not forget that Rivers is smart guy, a
Harvard graduate no less, so hearing him sing for half an hour and in
clunky terms abut the myriad joys of "partying all night" like a
17-year-old is fairly perturbing. The Girl Got Hot, the tale of a
classmate from high school who, duh, "got hot", is the worst example of
this douchebaggery. This is a band better than appealing to the basest
of FM radio power-pop desires, surely.

There are a few good moments â€“ particularly the single and first track
(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To, which borrows A
Town Called Maliceâ€™s bassline to tell the story of an anxious teenage
love, and Love Is The Answer, a rock/classical-Indian fusion which
features sometime Jai Ho singer Amrita Sen and was written for Make
Believe before being recorded by Sugar Ray and resurrected here. Lil
Wayne crops up to for a guest rap too, on the self-explanatory Can't
Stop Partying. But these detours aren't enough to rescue proceedings.

It's the songs reused from Cuomo's Alone II demo compilations that are
by far the best things here, and it's the sensitivity in these tracks
that made early Weezer so great and, mainly, whatâ€™s missing elsewhere
on Raditude. Itâ€™s an album seemingly designed to garner royalties from
future films in the American Pie franchise; the sound, almost literally
one assumes, of a band in a midlife crisis.

Previous release nuked for stolen from torrents, here is a "proper"
including scans etc. I think it has different bonus tracks too, but I
can't be arsed to look.
