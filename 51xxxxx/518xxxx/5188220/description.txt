Making Movies is the third album by British rock band Dire Straits, released in 1980.

The title of the album comes from a line in the song "Skateaway" and the unreleased song "Making Movies". Rolling Stone ranked the album #52 in their survey of the "100 Best Albums of the 80s". Making Movies was the biggest selling album in Italy in 1981 with one million copies; in Europe the album sold 3.8 million copies.
