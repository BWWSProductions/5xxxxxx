can anyone who has it working generate a serial number, (username?) and license key for this ""host id""? 
Host id = 3856-2861-3069"
,emptinessispower,2009-12-02T18:35Z,"my apologies, but it's kind of annoying to keep going back to the celemony site trying to remember which version# of which ... version (studio, editor, etc) ... is which; is this the new one with DNA? thanks of course for your effort regardless mister uploader, but i don't think i'm alone when i say DNA or bust  =D"
,numerouno1,2009-12-07T17:42Z,"torrent works fine, keygen also.

ONE problem though is as soon as I used the keygen I had symptoms of the ''Virut'' virus which is nearly impossible to remove, it infects .exe files so virus scanners can become the virus themselves and it even infects other viruses. I think i've somewhat removed everything after a day straight of trying and using every scanner, reg edit, advice I can get my hands on but i'm still doubtful as 99/100 you need too reformat and reinstall windows too get rid of it.

Not sure if it's anything too do with this torrent and if other people are fine then maybe it was another issue.."
