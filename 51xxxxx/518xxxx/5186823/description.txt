"Most of the songs contained on this compilation appear in radically different forms to the original versions.
COAST IS CLEAR being written especially for the session (the day before) so it's still in it's
embryonic stage and ARMS OUT which only gets aired in FaÃ®t Accompli 12" #1.

We would like to thank John Peel & Alan Moulder for their support."
