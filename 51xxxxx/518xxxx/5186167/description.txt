This is a pack i just threw together. it is a pack for making custom wads (Channels)for the Nintendo Wii. the wads included are Base wads for the purpose of editing. they are compleatly legal, and can be installed as is. (they are functioning forwarders/full channels)

WHATS INCLUDED: 

CustomizeMii v1.1 - PC app for editing wads, allows replacing of images with a few common image types, same with audio, can also replace the wads exicutable file with ANY .dol file. yes thats right any homebrew app. works great. has many features and very easy to use. built in banner brick protection. even beginners can use!

Legal Base Wads - these wads contain no Nintendo code, and are created from a scratch (not by me) from a Homebrew channel base. meaning they are legal to distribute. but i included them because they work good. 

WADS INCLUDED: (most with video preview!)

Backup Channel -video Preview @.com/watch?v=xE_EgdCRV1I
