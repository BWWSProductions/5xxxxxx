Email me if you are looking for an album in Lossless/FLAC (even obscure ones). I'd be willing to send you a link to it if you would share the album on publicbt/thepiratebay after you finish downloading it. My email: centroids1@gmail.com

Matisyahu had been working on his third album for nearly two years, making it the longest time he has ever spent making a record. The follow-up to Youth had been delayed several times before its release. First scheduled for early 2008, Light was pushed back numerous times because Matisyahu continued to tour off and on since the release of Youth. The new album's release date was set for April 21, 2009, but on March 3, the release date was pushed back to May 12, 2009. Then, once again, he pushed the release back, this time to Summer 2009, ostensibly because Matisyahu decided to record more new songs. That date had already passed, and in a message from Matisyahu on Twitter the album is due to release on August 25th. On May 27th, Matisyahu's FaceBook page stated that the album was going to come out on August 25th. On June 23rd Light was made available for preorder on iTunes, with the single "One Day" available for download at the same time. Eventually, the official release date of August 25 was settled on, and stands, pending unforeseen setbacks.
