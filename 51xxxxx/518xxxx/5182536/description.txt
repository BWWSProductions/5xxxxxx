The Biggest Loser Where Are They Now (USA season 8 special) 

Hundreds of lives changed. More than 18,200 pounds lost. Thousands inspired. Over the past 5 years, 206 morbidly obese Americans have made a commitment to transform their lives on The Biggest Loser.

And step by step, mile after mile, pound by agonizing pound, they've not only changed themselves, they've inspired millions. But no one said it would be easy. From the gym to the scale theyâ€™ve faced incredible challenges both on campus and at home and proved that The Biggest Loser isn't always about what you lose, it's about what you gain. 

Tonight, The Biggest Loser packs up from the ranch and heads out across the United States to visit more than 40 former contestants to see what's happened to your favorite players and some of your not-so favorites including the youngest, the oldest, the heaviest and the sickest. Theyâ€™ll reveal secrets from the ranch, share tips to leading healthy lives at home. 

And discover who kept it off, who gained and watch as one trainer confronts a past winner who has packed on all the pounds again. Tonight we finally answer the question everyone's asking: Where are they now and what do they look like today?

This special aired on Nov 25, 2009. The resolution is 528x352 and while the quality is not as good as a scene release due to my capture and encoding methods it is quite watchable in my opinion.
