[V],twentyforty,2009-11-29T10:01Z,"Yep. Now is up.
There is a lot of ""doubles"" and very often if I try to up here some TV show torrent, message pops-up telling: ""torrent already present"".
It comes from ""past tense"" when people upped my name-not-to-be-spoken torrents on many different sites.
However, many of the torrents have been gone for good. If I have something, I'll bring it here, just need feedback from people (like yours)."

Wasn't sure what site (if any) you would be using. Glad to see that you have a new home, hopefully, for a while.

Cheers
