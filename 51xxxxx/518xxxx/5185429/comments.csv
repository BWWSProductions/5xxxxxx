Plz explain a bit more about this sp3 xp pro as u say x64. I have x64 sp1 but can't update to sp3 and I can't find stand alone xp sp3 or sp2 x64 bit. thx."
,hoodiboy,2009-11-29T21:06Z,"This is Win XP SP2 x64. 

x64 means its 64 bit. 

MS has not released SP3 for x64 XP. I don't think it ever will..This OS is perhaps one of the better OS made by MS.. "
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-08T02:06Z,32bit version is too crappy that was why it needs sp3.
