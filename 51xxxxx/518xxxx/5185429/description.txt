This is a Windows XP x64 SP2 Professional version (64bit) which is updated upto Nov 2009. In my opinion, Windows XP x64 SP2 Pro is a rather underrated OS - its one of the better OS released by MS.

In our edition no Tools like Nlite was used. Our aim was to create a version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup. So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size and perhaps a bit longer installation time. But we feel that this will be worth it - I have been running an earlier one for over 3 months in my home system. Its still running well. 

You can enable automatic updates if you have the guts to do it.. it will work..
