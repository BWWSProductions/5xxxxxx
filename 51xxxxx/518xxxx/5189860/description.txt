[ about CD ]

These psy-trance innovators have become one of the biggest electronic bands on the planet. Twice ranked among the world's ten best DJs by the bible of the scene, the UK's DJ Magazine, the Israel-bred, LA-based duo bring a frenetic rock energy to the form. Their explosive show, featuring guitars, live drums, intensely passionate vocals, and an ambitious multimedia backdrop ranks among the genre's most unpredictably joyous events. Their recordings continually venture where other electronic acts fear to tread. The follow-up to 2007's "Vicious Delicious" marks a return to their metal roots. Guests include Jonathan Davis (Korn) and Perry Farrell (Jane's Addiction, Porno For Pyros, Satellite Party).

What do you get when you combine Israeli Psychedelic Trance, five gigantic sharks, Perry Farrell, and a little bit of Korn? Infected Mushrooms' 2009 album Legend Of The Black Shawarma, of course! Infected Mushroom is an Israeli Psytrance and Electronic outfit formed by Erez Eisen (also known as I.Zen) and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the city of Haifa, in northern Israel. This is their seventh album. Their live shows are considered by devotees as life changing. This album is in the vein of Prodigy's Fat Of The Land and Pendulum's In Silico.
