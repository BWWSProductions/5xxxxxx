,ninjadrive,2009-11-29T12:26Z,"Nope, just install and update."
,UltimateBomberBoy,2009-12-04T01:00Z,"Hey, Ninja. Thanks for the Kontakt 4.0.2 download, but there's a problem: I'm getting missing samples, and I did everything right. Is there a separate download for the samples, or was this supposed to come with the download? Help me, please."
,ninjadrive,2009-12-05T12:05Z,"This is the sampler only - the library isn't included, sorry. Maybe I should add it to the description. I don't have the 47 gb library but I may be able to find it for you."
,UltimateBomberBoy,2009-12-05T21:26Z,"Awesome. Thanks. Tell me when you've found them, 'cause I'll need all the help I can get."
,ninjadrive,2009-12-06T13:38Z,"I didn't manage to find the Kontakt 4 library on it's own (though you might be able to find the Kontakt 3 library) but there is a Komplete 6 torrent here on TPB. The library should be included there alongside Massive, FM8, Absynth 5, Reaktor 5, Battery and Guitar Rig 4 Pro. I haven't downloaded this so I can't tell if it's working or not but hopefully it does. And of course, the Kontakt 4 sampler is also included so if you're looking for the library you can just download Komplete 6 instead of this torrent.

,domination777,2010-05-25T16:43Z,"Thanx for the upload!
Too bad that You have to have the Activation Code!
You donÂ´t need to register, but it goes into demo mode automatically....hmmmm?
I installed it, updated....and then when I start the application, it works for about five minutes....then it goes into Demo Mode and says that I have to activate it through the Service Center!!!???

So, does it work or not?
It says ""License: Full""
Do you have an Activation Code, because itÂ´s NOT working without one!!!!!"
,gagext,2011-01-16T03:57Z,"i installed it & every time i try and open it, it instantly says ""Kontakt 4 has stopped working""
if you know the problem can u email me @ gageishere@gmail.com"
