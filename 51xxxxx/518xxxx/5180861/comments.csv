Help?"
,mdubbya,2009-12-06T22:26Z,"Bit of a luddite, I managed to read the nfo file but still cant launch the programme? I launched the FD programme but then dont I need a serial number to get the the product key stage of install?? Also I've tried running the fd8 keygen and it fails to initialise.  Can you help?"
[V],Alia_Erenel,2009-12-11T00:45Z,Thank you :) !

,Teshi,2010-01-09T18:58Z,"The .nfo file was pretty messed up. Openable, but barely."
,hammer4hire,2010-01-26T20:29Z,Awesome copy aoloffline - works like a charm - thx!
,Scorus,2010-01-31T09:40Z,"If you can't open the nfo, use notepad. 

Great torrent"
,fatestar,2010-02-03T07:00Z,Bad torrent. Keygen does not execute and thus the program is worthless...
,margaretMS,2010-02-06T22:52Z,"The software installation works OK, but the Keygen does not.  I downloaded the following Final Draft 8 (for a MAC)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5110419/Final_Draft_8_%28Mac%29
The Keygen from this download will work.

Thankyou!"
,hattedone,2010-02-08T06:03Z,Doesn't work on vista ultimate 32 bit.  Installs but gets a memory error when trying to run it.  The keygen does run though.  Are there any working copies of this anywhere?
,fatestar,2010-02-12T08:36Z,"MargaretMS is correct. Download this program and then go to
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5110419/Final_Draft_8_%28Mac%29
and download that keygen. Follow instructions in this torrent and everything works fine!
Thanks!"
,justagrunt,2010-02-26T02:02Z,Can someone help me maybe.When I downloaded this it dwnlded as a windows media file...It wont run and...Yea.So any help would be mucho appreciated...P.s i kinda suck at computers.
,mictrmbl,2010-02-26T13:54Z,"Thanks aoloffline! Install & Activation a breeze.
Much appreciated :)"

,YER221,2010-04-22T07:06Z,does this work on Windows 7 OS?
,YER221,2010-04-22T07:14Z,"didn't work for me. must activate online, then error message came up"
,Tidy_Cat,2010-04-23T22:18Z,Install exe wouldn't install the .dll. Don't bother downloading unless you want a bunch of folders with Final Draft templates in them or if you want the keygen (which does work).
,firstindianblue,2010-05-01T09:59Z,"IT'S A GREAT TORRENT. INSTALLED ON WIN XP HOME PERFECTLY. KEYGEN IS PERFECT. 

MORONS - STOP COMPLAINING/WHINING AND TRY FIGURING OUT THE SIMPLE INSTALLATION PROCESS!!!"
,jamesrob,2010-05-19T15:27Z,"I am using Windows 7 32-bit.
I Installed FD8 and generated the key, Chose ""Manual Activation"" put in the challenge code and pasted the response code... all using the Keygen that came with the program... it all works flawlessly 100% perfect. thank you"
,nukepineisland,2010-06-09T20:34Z,Thank you my Friend.
,JustMe84,2010-06-16T06:51Z,Couldn't activate this as  it said I needed a response code and I have no idea where that is!!
,Enariel,2010-06-26T22:36Z,Thank you! WORKS! Just be careful while following instructions! :)
,Enariel,2010-06-26T22:43Z,"People! ITS simple!

1 - installation
2 - It asking for key = Use keygen
3 - select Manual activation
4 - now its asking for response = IN KEYGEN PROGRAM in ""challange"" window type in numbers that are given you by Fist draft programm under ""challange category"" (I dont remember correct name it might be another one but idea is same)put them into ""challange"" window of keygen and it will automatically generate you response numbers copy them and past them into ""response code"" of Final Draft program!

Don't blame uploaded for your fail to pay careful attention! "

,Nathan12,2010-08-22T08:58Z,"Ok there is something very odd and very frustrating about this program.  I'm not sure if it's the program, the torrant or my computer.  Here's what's happening.  I install the program just fine and I activate it.  However when I try to use the program the pages are only 3 inches wide and hold only 24 lines.  Also everything is sort of crushed into the right side of the page.  The words go to the very edge of the page.  Can anyone tell me what the hell is going on?  I've used earlier versions of this program (not on this computer) and they have worked fine.  "

,Nathan12,2010-08-23T04:17Z,Figured it out.  I had a HP photo Printer set as the default printer which made Final Draft think that the pages were only 5x7.  Sorry for any confusion.  If I knew how to delete my comments I would.  Works torrent works great!

,inVested,2011-04-01T17:17Z,"Enariel: Thank you so much for the instructions, but you COULD shave just a little off your attitude. We're all intelligent here and we ""pay careful attention;"" we're just new to the process..."

,neurolux,2012-04-27T02:23Z,"I'm a complete noob at this. This is my first time downloading anything from here, so please excuse my retardation. I downloaded it. Started it. It asks for my customer  number. I looked thru all the files I downloaded, couldn't find it. I found out I have to use a keygen. I looked thru the files I downloaded, couldn't find keygen. Then I find out I have to download the mac version and use THAT keygen. So I do that. I open the keygen and I see it wants a challenge code. From here I find out two different things. Someone says just to enter ""challengecode"" as the challenge code. I do that, hit calculate, and get a response code. Great, but I still don't have a Customer Code. The other thing I find out is that I have to get to ""manual activation"" in FD8. I could not figure out how to do that. My only options on FD8 are to enter customer code or enter demo mode. I enter demo mode and look everywhere, but I don't find any way to get into Manual Activation. So now I'm stuck, and it's not for lack of trying.
Will someone please help this idiot?
Thank you."
