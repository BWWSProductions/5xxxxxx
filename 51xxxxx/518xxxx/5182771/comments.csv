,DR-NL,2009-12-31T00:03Z,some more info: there are 28 wallpapers. It's worth downloading. Some wallpapers are a bit well... I have no reason to use those as a wallpaper...

,neofaith,2010-02-20T16:53Z,my laptop monitor is 1080p
,daktoch,2010-03-08T21:50Z,"Hawaii501, what do you think a scan line is measured in? Puppies? Gumdrops?

No, it's f**king pixels. 


For added fail, read the description; ""Resolutions: 1920 x 1080""
