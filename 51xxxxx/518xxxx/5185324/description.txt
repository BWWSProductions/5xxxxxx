as the japanese site of Illusion is offtenly inaccessible to europeans, I bring you the demo of the new Illusion game-. Real Kanojo. Google it for more details.
Remember to switch to japanese before installing or use applocale.

This is my first upload, I have many years of leeching, guess it's time to move up...

The file is an exe, a self extracting installer, as dloaded from the japanese site. It's clean. I hate the pricks that spread infected stuff for 15 cents, but I know they exist and I always take care. You should too!
