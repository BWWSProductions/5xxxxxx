But have you done anything with ?Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (2009)? album? For example retagged them? Start and end of all flac-files are missing. If so, maybe you will have to remake the torrent.

,Mr.Cheese,2009-11-22T12:06Z,"As I have found out it is probably the tags that is behind the problem. A change of a dot, comma, change of lower-case to upper-case letters or vice versa. Please make a new torrent 
"
,sradams777,2009-11-22T16:17Z,"I did retag the flacs but I can't make any changes that you can't do yourself...I guess I don't understand what the problem is. I checked Sgt. pepper and it seems correct to me. If you tell me exactly what to fix, I will do it and remake the torrent."
,Mr.Cheese,2009-11-22T17:32Z,If you have retagged the files the only way is to create a new torrent. and seed the new one. Make a reference here to the new one and after some days remove this faulty torrent.
,Mr.Cheese,2009-11-22T17:35Z,PS. I Hope you haven?t retagged the other files. If so we might get huge problem to get the missing files. Then you might do a torrent just for ??The Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club?? Band album.
