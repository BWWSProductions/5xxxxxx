This is the first 62 issues of SoftSide magazine in PDF format. SoftSide was a magazine running from 1978-1984 that covered primarily the trs-80 when it began. Later coverage was added for the Atari 8-bit line as well as the Apple II. The last few issues also had coverage of the Commodore-64 and the PC. 

I am still looking for the last few issues (after issue 62 - which is labled issue #47 on the cover). If you have access please email thomas.mybay@gmail.com so I can finish this collection for everyone. Thanks.
