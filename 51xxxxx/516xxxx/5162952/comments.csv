Thanks to everyone helping with their upload speed on high.  My connection isn't that fast, so you're helping a lot.  Got about 10 peers near 30% already."

,zeeowl,2009-11-17T17:56Z,"Well... 55 people have downloaded it so far with no complaints.  Human nature dictates that it's probably working for all of them.  Humans usually complain when things are going wrong, and say nothing when everything is fine. :D

Are you having problems, or just asking pre-download?  I can guarantee that the Mac version works fine.  Can't speak for the Windows version as I don't have access to a PC (and don't want to :P)."

,savvage,2010-02-05T01:51Z,"right so i finally got around to registering my name with Piratebay so i could leave a comment,and about time since ive been downloading from here for years! 

i just finished this torrent last night and tried it out this morning and everything seems to be working fine. its my first time using cinema 4d so was only messing around so far but presume the rest all works properly. i got the licence keys from the comment page of another pirate bay torrent for cinema 4d, all the keys worked but there was none for the body paint part, but cant complain really ive been using blender  for ages and already im hooked on cinema,its so much easier...many thanks to the uploader who ever you are.

so anyway im running windows 7 64bit also. just said id comment here so if somebody has the same setup and wondering whether it will work, a few people seemed to be having trouble with it, i must be lucky!"
,firemepoo,2010-02-10T16:54Z,"hey, been using c4d for a long time, and this is by far the best torrent version out as of yet. 
one problem, when i get asked for the keys, i enter them all, but next to bodypaint it says ""included"" so i assume it means included with with the whole package, so i install it.

i can open c4d and everything works fine, accept i cant find bodypaint 3d!!
im using osx leopard. any help would be hot!
thanks "
,firemepoo,2010-02-10T19:00Z,"yo zeeowl, cmon man, everything else works, just cant find the launcher for bodypaint.

,khchan3501,2010-03-05T06:43Z,"to all those who said you can only open the NET render client
i finally realized that during the installation, it have a place to let you put the serial key(s) in, so you HAVE TO copy and paste all the keys given from the note instead of just click on next, if you input all the keys in it lets you choose which application to install, but if u missed this step and just click on next, it just lets you install the NET Render Client and nothing else"

,pawnoir,2011-09-10T02:47Z,"Works perfectly.
If you want Bodypaint 3D (serial is missing):
1. install the soft with the serials included
2. update when asked (a window will pop-up)
--> that will install Bodypaint 3D
BUT the soft will no longer work
3. put the Cinema 4D application in the garbage (using appcleaner, appdeleteâŚ)
4. reinstall the soft as if it were for the 1st time
You will notice that all serials are already written
Now, you have C4D R11.5
// Macbook Pro (Intel) 10.4.11"
,desotodeson,2011-09-28T18:12Z,"All works perfectly for my mac - Intel- Leopard v.10.5.8.
