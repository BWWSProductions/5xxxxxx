I'm sick of the crap you lot are calling Hardcore these days.

Take a listen to this mix, don't listen to the mixing it's 
awful. Don't listen to the audio quality. Don't listen to 
anything except for the music itself. 

Put it on your iPod, in your car, on your hi-fi at home, 
just sit back, and listen. Listen to what Hardcore 
should really be about. Fast beats, mental sounds, the
sort of feelings that make arenas full of thousands of 
people jump around like fucking lunatics.

If all you listen to is the shitty trance remixes most DJ's
and producers are putting out these days, you have no idea
what it felt like to be bouncing about next to a total
stranger back in the day. Talking to people you have never
met before in your life and will never meet again.

Hardcore was never about the money, it was about pure
enjoyment. Modern producers have taken that away from the
scene, pumping out rubbish releases one after the other. 

It's time for the ravers to take it back to the good old 
days. There's a lot of upcoming talent in the scene, taking
back what Hardcore used to be about. Don't let the big cats
at the top push you aside. Keep striving for the rush that 
made you love Hardcore in the first place. If you manage a
release and it doesn't make you rich, so fucking what? 
So long as one person, one single, mental raver enjoys it, 
that's what it's all about. 

Regards,
