Dub War were a four piece metal band from Newport, South Wales, UK. Formed in 1993, the band offered an innovative mix of metal, punk, and ragga, inheriting the punk-reggae legacy of The Clash and Bad Brains.[citation needed] Their lyrics were thoughtful and idealistic drawing comparisons with the former, though musically they were closer to the hard rock sound of the latter.[citation needed] Fans consider the band to have been pioneers of a new genre, 'ragga metal'.[citation needed]

They released only two albums via the metal label, Earache Records. They were 1995s Pain and Wrong Side of Beautiful the following year. The Dub War experience was short-lived as the band split in 1999. This separation resulted from disputes with their label.
