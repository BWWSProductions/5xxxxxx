  From Recorded Books:

  In Cat Chaser, Leonard is at his best with a splashy, fast-paced romp on the beaches of Florida and Santo Domingo. 

  The last time George Moran had seen action was as part of the Cat Chaser platoon in Santo Domingoâ€”securing the island paradise for democracy. Now, maybe, life is too easy for the ex-leatherneck. Not only does the beachfront motel George owned provide him with a place to live, but it also gives him a little spending money. Then he falls in love with the wife of a Miami millionaire and drops square in the middle of a dangerous con more deadly than sniper fire. With the stakes high and his heart on the line, George is bound to get caught in a nasty blast of crossfire.
