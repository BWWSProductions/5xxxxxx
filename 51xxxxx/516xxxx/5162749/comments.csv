This post has nothing to do with Cat Chaser, but PirateBay doesn't seem to have a ""contact member"" option.  Anyhoo:

LOVE your torrents, and appreciate all the effort you put into them.  So, THANK YOU!

Frank Muller narrated Rice's Vampire Chronicles, but I can only have the first four of his narration of them.  Do you know if he did the later ones?   You seem to know your way around Muller's oeuvre...

Thanks again,
LustmordLady

ps-- If you want the vampire chronicles I do have of Muller, I'll upload them for you."
,neshaminy,2009-11-15T23:14Z,Your uploads are always appreciated.
[V],FerraBit,2009-11-16T18:27Z,"@LustmordLady - thanks for the feedback!
Only the 4 Rice recordings (and they are great!)
See the list of Muller recordings: http://www.bitchen.com/muller/audlist.html

@neshaminy - thanks again!

Thanks to the seeders.
Peace Pirates"

@LustmordLady - ""PirateBay doesn't have a 'contact member' option""... You can PM etc on the forum!"

,s_gautama,2012-07-16T16:30Z,This download IS SPAM.  It is one of those chopped-up recordings that the publishers upload to foil pirates. Every minute the recording skips around to a random section of the book.  You can't listen to it.  STAY AWAY.
