One question: the 2 first ep is in one
file, but the english subs i have found
are separated...

Has anyone found the ""right"" 
english subs for this one?
Please post a link.

Peace and Love!

,PhilLesh12,2009-11-17T21:43Z,"shaden667, there are 4 episodes.

The fourth episode aired last night and was posted by eztv a few hours later."
,phrozenstare,2009-11-18T17:16Z,"PhilLesh12 

how do you figure it is only 4 episodes?

entire series lasted 3 days (sun,mon,tues)with 2 new episodes a night which equals 6 episodes"
