,Xenon4U2C,2009-11-22T17:44Z,"Hello 80zforever .... You really have an amazing collection, thanks for all you have uploaded !!
But ... I am having trouble finding a few songs that I'm not even sure I have the names correct maybe you could help me, I didn't know where to speak to you so i hope you see this post ... lol , here goes nothing.
1. this one i only know some lyrics from , see how good you are...they go "" I had a dream and the dream came true, I saw a ghost and the ghost was you ... but it was only make believe ...""
Actually I think I'll make a mp3 sample with bits and pieces of the songs in question, that should be a lot better. I'll try and post one in a few days. thx"

I think that's a Thompson Twins song called ""Oumma Aularesso (Animal Laugh)"" from their first album, ""A Product Of...""

[V],80zforever,2009-11-26T00:07Z,"JonYo, I don't think that's The Thompson Twins song. Oumma Aularesso lyrics are different. I am sure this is an italo-disco song I might have heard a while back but just passed. I am not positive though. A sample of the song will help for sure."
,fizdude,2009-11-26T15:30Z,"Hi 80zforever, your uploads are amazing thank you so much! We've been grabbing gem after gem thanks to you making them available.  I was wondering if you perhaps have these 2 albums: Red 7 - When the Sun Goes Down (1987) & Spoons - Bridges over Borders (1986).  I've been searching for a while now for a download somewhere, but no luck.  Would love to add them to my collection.  I'm hoping you can work your magic.  Good luck and thanks again.
Fiz"
,JonYo,2009-11-26T23:51Z,"Oops, I made a mistake.  I meant the song ""Make Believe"" by the Thompson Twins, from their first record, ""...A Product Of"".  I'm pretty sure that's it."
,JettBlack9,2009-11-28T22:02Z,"not heard of this...I'll give it a shot.
Thanks 80zforever."
