,needaname,2009-11-16T07:05Z,Thanks again EZ
,yorkyellowfish,2009-11-16T07:36Z,.MKV? why this format.....
,finalfantasyhero,2009-11-16T07:36Z,"1.46 GB = 3 * the normal wait.  Damn, and it's slow atm for me.  

But thx as always."
,finalfantasyhero,2009-11-16T07:38Z,Yeah .mkv?  Anyone know if that works on PS3?
,yorkyellowfish,2009-11-16T07:40Z,.MKV does not work with PS3
,Chaoticfist,2009-11-16T07:43Z,Thx eztv.  When u get the chance can you upload the smaller one.  Cant be downloading these large files on 60 g cap.  I love you man keep it up.
,finalfantasyhero,2009-11-16T07:43Z,"Dammit, i'll look elsewhere for Avi or MP4.  First time i've seen EZ do .mkv.

Thx yorkyellowfish.

,elax666,2009-11-16T08:17Z,"Noooooooooo! .mkv? Sh*t, sh*t, sh*t, if PS3 can´t read mkv, I´m f*cked. I hope it´s just a matter of time be4 eztv adds the smaller file. I hope, I hope, I hope....."
,xler8,2009-11-16T08:17Z,hey... new to this! always use eztv for my dexter! wats mkv? will it work 4 meeeee? i need to watch my dex!!! 
,xler8,2009-11-16T08:19Z,oh yes! and the size! tooo big. normally 1/3 of that.
,_GKG_,2009-11-16T08:23Z,"Folks, watch out for Media Sentry people ... I recently received a notice for having Dex 4e6 on my download ... updated my blocklists to the newest version, and will use Tor once the AVI shows up ..."
,GTA_VC_IS_BEST,2009-11-16T08:44Z,why isnt this in avi for fuck sake!
,finalfantasyhero,2009-11-16T08:51Z,"Lot's of people prefer .mkv for 720 HD on their PC's.  However, i want it on my PS3 without all the hassle of converting etc so i can watch it on the big screen.  

There'll be an AVI eventually, it's just painful waiting for one lol."
,Chaoticfist,2009-11-16T08:57Z,"Not trying to seem impatient.  Just been wqanting dexter all day lol.  But i do appreciate what eztv is doing.

Cant wait.  Just so tired. Going to wait 30 mins then go to bed."
,Oxymuss,2009-11-16T09:41Z,"EZTV's .avi torrent;
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5165108/Dexter.S04E08.HDTV.XviD-SYS.avi"
,BodyOil,2009-11-16T11:04Z,I stream .MKV´s via PS3 Media Server all the time. No problem at all! 
,tahqa,2009-11-16T14:47Z,"All you need to play this on PS3 is mkv2vob, it converts the file in less than a minute and you're good to go. Aren't these files always .mkv anyway? Can't believe people are acting all stunned."
,That80sGuy,2009-11-16T18:22Z,"From what I can gather, the MKV file is normally the high definition broadcast. It can be converted to mpg. by downloading the program MKV2VOB. That's what i use."
,pioneer911,2009-11-16T18:41Z,hello! why wont my downloads start? .It worked fine earlier. wrong tracker? whats the one that works? I`m a noob btw ; )
,danibo,2009-11-16T22:13Z,"Thanks!!

Leave it in MKV and keep up the big size (=better quality)

Leave the ps3 for gaming people :)"
,samueljackson,2009-11-16T22:24Z,"Mate, don't use Tor for torrenting.  That's not its function.

And thanks to eztv for all the uploads!"
,DaymanAhhhaahh,2009-11-17T01:10Z,Thanks eztv!
,iridris,2009-11-17T13:10Z,Why is everyone complaining about MKV?  Every HD episode of Dexter this season has been MKV...  If you don't want MKV download the regular SD version.
,tahqa,2009-11-17T14:58Z,"Aren't all 720p HD uploads .mkv? For some reason I see 'HDTV' in all TV show torrent titles, but it seems only the ones that say 720p and are .mkv are truly HD."
,Helchez,2009-11-19T05:34Z,If you want to watch it on your PS3 just download mkv2vob. It muxes mkv files quickly.
,colt45joe,2009-12-17T04:36Z,"yea, everyone.. if you want to watch this on the ps3, use PS3 Media Server, or mkv2vob. both work amazingly well. "
,firexninja,2012-05-18T06:18Z,thank you!
