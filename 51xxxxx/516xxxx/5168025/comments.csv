STFU & GTFO! Go spew your inbred hatred on one of the Chan sites. F'n loser. "
[V],big_dad_e,2010-07-17T04:51Z,"No you inbred, I\'m not Jewish.  But you are obviously a Neo-Nazi.  Now strap on a bomb and go blow up a church, temple or mosque.  BTW your 72 virgins are all men like yourself!"

Peace be with you. I forgive your false witness against me. Again, I'm not Jewish but I don't hate them. You should pray for peace instead of war. God bless. "

08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

Learn how to create a torrent and put some booty on the table for the rest of us instead of your asinine comments. "
,odain81,2010-09-20T04:30Z,thanks man...you rock. i just wist there were more seeders the leachers in the world!
,odain81,2010-09-20T04:30Z,than* sorry
,Enrix,2010-11-05T12:13Z,"Looking forward to download the season, seems like the down speed doesn't want to rise at all, nothing to seed in that case. "
[V],big_dad_e,2010-11-05T23:45Z,"It's a slow download, current stats: 
Seeders 407 	Leechers 697 	Completed 36353	 "
,Wu_Tang_Ninja,2010-11-06T13:33Z,"Great upload thanx, I'll seed :)"
,theoriginalphantom,2010-11-21T16:09Z,"Thanks for these big_dad_e. Ignore the haters mate, they cant get heard elsewhere due to the fact of a subnormal intelligence level.
As for the speeds, well they may be slow but patience is a virtue so they say.
Thanks again for the time and effort put in to share with the rest of us."
,jobaloon,2010-12-06T09:48Z,"DAMN! not to be unappreciative. i'm grateful, but it's so disappointing not hearing the songs at the end (during the credits) that give a nice sense of 'finale' and transition out of the show....
ya feel me??"
,HooglyBoogly,2011-04-06T14:20Z,"Thank you, big_dad_e.

Fantastic work with this upload. This is a great tv series."

,chumzy,2011-06-25T03:35Z,"Cuts in after the HBO screen and cuts out before the credits, could have mentioned this?  Now I have to find and download a different copy.  "
,snowbirds,2011-07-19T17:25Z,"Thanks big_dad_e for uploading all 6 seasons!  I've watched the first 5 and they were flawless.

For some reason, with season 6, the special song they select to close each episode is cut off abruptly along with the credits.  This actually ruins then endings for me.  :(

Thanks anyway for the upload."
,aqw212,2011-08-13T22:53Z,This is Season 6 PT2 PPL!! Season 6 PT 1 is a totally seprate set.
,captaincarisma,2011-09-26T20:06Z,"because of you i showed my girfriend entire season, she never watched this show among alot of other things from having a closed minded upbringing, thanks your the best! and only one i trust on here,  will you have the new dexter final season?"

[V],WildcardSearch,2011-10-24T18:45Z,"@aqw212: this is the full season. I can verify that so why damage a great uploader with lies?

big_dad_e's torrents are impeccable, give him a try before listening to spammers."
,asteink,2011-11-20T01:59Z,Episode 2 goes out of sync about halfway through. No biggie just putting it out there. Great rip.
,hppiefrk,2012-02-28T23:20Z,"big_dad_e, i think i love you.....
