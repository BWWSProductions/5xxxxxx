Dream Wolves was a comic book series running from 1993-95, 2000, created and self-published by Daniel Presedo.  It is about a female werewolf and comes with an ADULT rating due to erotic content.

Although this is the second Dream Wolves series this is Presado's definitive vision.  After a down turn in the comics market Presado placed Dramenon Studios on hiatus and went into the computer industry.
