You heard it right people. the Level D 767, with a non-volid crack by komunitta.


i am NOT a WoS member nor will i ever be. bunch of assholes over there.


Anyway...this komu crack just replaces a few .dlls and makes the plane compltely working and flyable.


it *MAY* crash your fsx first time picking the plane, just load it up again and itll be fine.




Dont forget to seed!
