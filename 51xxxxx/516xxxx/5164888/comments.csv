,future737captain,2009-11-20T06:58Z,wackoo what gpws? the sounds should work just fine. 
,aarque,2009-11-20T12:39Z,"futuredude, first I appeal to someones intelligence. If you are too obscenely obnoxious to see the big picture and just want to be the cool fatcat uploader, you aren't helping the community much. I would so rather have you think about your actions than compare dick sizes, but I realize you are probably just going to keep adoring yourself. Do you ever bother to read the TPB forums or research theses things? It's clear you keep coming back to your torrents too wallow in the glow of your own reflection..."
,resist777,2009-11-27T12:38Z,i still get the panel initialization failure notice.
,joejccva71,2009-11-29T02:03Z,"Downloading now, will continue to seed for others."
,future737captain,2009-11-29T08:27Z,"aarque just shut the fuck up and go back under your bridge, troll.


resist777 then you did something wrong may have missed a step. i have this and am using the same crack so backtrack and go thru it again systematically"
,orbital9,2009-11-30T06:12Z,"Works very well.  Great upload, thanks Future!

If anyone is having an issue that has Acceleration installed and crashes when they use the ""Ground Call"" button after loading an IFR flight, it's a known bug in the final version of the product.  You can get around it by either:

 1.) Uninstalling Acceleration and using FSX updates Service Pack #1 & #2, **OR**
2.) As soon as you click ""FLY"" and load into the sim, SAVE your flight, quit FSX, reopen it, and LOAD your flight.

Either one takes care of the problem.  Another known bug for people with Acceleration installed that you cannot get around is the FMC will lose it's PERF INIT settings after you start the engines and you will have to enter them again.  The only way around this is to program the PERF INIT into the FMC after the engines are started."

,ti_eagle_22,2010-03-23T06:53Z,"holy f*** I can't believe the crap I'm reading on this guys uploads? I don't see any of you uploading decent software hm?. I just want to personally thank you, future737captain, for helping us simmers alike who really enjoy using payware products but are generally students and can't afford the cost or simply choose not to because if it's available, what's the point?

THANKS! Keep up the good work :O. "
,ti_eagle_22,2010-03-23T08:19Z,"hey could you please e-mail man? ti_eagle_22@hotmail.com

,brunofazio,2010-07-04T09:23Z,"I did all the steps but when I load the aircraft it goes crazy!!! making spins, going up and down!! what is that?? help me please!!"
,irikimoss,2010-10-10T06:41Z,"orbital9 you are quite right my friend, I avoid the ground call by starting APU so I don't have the trouble of restarting FSX. I also fill in the PERF INIT after the engines, those 2 bugs are solved and I can peacefully use LVLD with Acc. There is one 3rd bug, but that one will solve itself automagically :) 

cheers all \o\"
,DVA8452,2011-03-02T23:06Z,"It works!!!! Just run the installed, follow the directions in the crack/patch, then fly! It does crash FSX the first time opening it though. Just restart it, then viola!!! Have fun :)"
,DVA8452,2011-03-02T23:26Z,Cant get the Repaint Manager to work. I go to install one and it comes up with a loading sign.
,poopoo812,2011-05-16T08:10Z,"I finally got this shit working. I was pulling my hair a year ago trying to install this, came back to it and it works 100%! LNAV works, AT works, plane flies smoothly and everything. Just follow the instructions and to find your volumeid, just type in ""vol"" into cmd. Make sure you put the files into C drive, and running the 767 installation in Flight One Software folder which you created. Also replace the crack files with the patch"
,BAARERBIER,2011-08-04T21:08Z,please 737captain give us a better installation instructions.
,harrydoucette,2012-03-11T16:23Z,i dont think this is working in win7 64bit. keep getting bad licence file and kicked out of fsx. anyone have a 64bit version?

,danionow,2012-07-09T01:07Z,Req: FSDT GSX please !! :D
,VirtualFlyer,2012-07-19T05:09Z,Wondering if anyone has come across a release of the fix that overcomes the fmc data loss and engine start issues when this aircraft is used with acceleration expansion pack installed in fsx. There was some beat fix back in 2011 but I cannot seem to find any official fix release anywhere. I know you can uninstall acceleration but then I will loose some nice items in some sceneries I have so a fix would be great if anyone has it.
