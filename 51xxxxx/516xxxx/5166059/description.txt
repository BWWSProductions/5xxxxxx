Oh god, this was overdue. So many great tracks were released in the last 2 months it's not even funny! Of course, I couldn't fit them all into one mix. But I tried. (So much so that some of the mixes are a little crowded. My apologies.)

The mix is called "Magnet". Don't ask.


If you're into vocal progressive house, you'll love Nobody Seems To Care by 16 Bit Lolitas and Shik Stylko's Many Dayz in the beginning. The middle is a little more techy starting with Gregor Tresher's amazing track Awaking Life Inside and ending with King Roc's A Pocket Full of Prose. Then, a little bit of the Underworld sound with Downpipe can't hurt. Quivver's RustleDust is a heavenly track, and don't miss Josh Gabriel's and Dave Seaman's monstrous Heyaah, too. There are also some classics: most notably PQM's You Are Sleeping and RidgewalkersÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ Find feat. El.

If you like what you hear, become a friend/fan of me on Facebook.
