,LordXAX2103,2009-12-17T22:34Z,"I have a problem.  I know exactly how to install it, but when its done isntalling it says everything is successful but it really isnt.  Usually they grey out and have a downloaded symbol next to them and they show up under the installed tab, but theyre not doing that this time, nor do they show up in game.  This has always worked jsut fine before all i can figure is that the new patch they came out with last night screwed this up somehow I dont really know.  Maybe I am doing something wrong can anyone help?"
,LordXAX2103,2009-12-17T23:36Z,"For whatever reason, it WILL install the patterns, but that is all it will install.  It doesnt seem to want to install anything else and I've tried everthing including restarting the computer to clearing out the cache folders in the download directory of the game.  I don't understand why im the only one that it's being a bitch to unless its from the new patch.  This sucks big time."
,eskimique,2009-12-18T17:55Z,"Same here, put all in my download folder, installed with launcher installer but in the game nothing shows up. All was working fine until i installed the newest patch...."
,Kickyourq,2009-12-23T19:28Z,is this the actual game??
,Asagrim,2010-01-02T22:35Z,"I have downloaded this one. I extracted the archive, and there are 16 corrupt sims3packs. 

Though file size exactly matches to the byte with good ones, these do not have an icon in the download manager. This is not a game version issue because i tried those 16 with 1.0, 1.27, 1.66, 1.79 and the most recent, 1.82. 

All other packs beside these 16 corrupted ones did successfully install even with version 1.0

The corrupted ones are:
TableEndEgypt
Thanksgiving_Fullset
tvModMin
amhairfauxhawk
BedSingleAsian
bedSingleEgypt
CarPriusV
computerNaszaKlasa
DresserMediumStorybook
DresserTallAnC
Halloween_Fullset
lightingFloorVictorian
RefrigeratorFanta
sculptureFloorNaszaKlasa
sculptureTableNaszaKlasa
Riverview

If you are telling me that these don't work because i idiot need WA for them, then please explain my why Riverview falls under the same category, which doesn't require any update at all, and why have i been able to install riverview - and 3 other - from another torrent right after installing the game, so with 1.0?

Even if i would need WA for them, they _should_ have icons, but they don't."
,Viper666.,2010-02-09T11:55Z,"@Asagrim

they were all tested here and worked. Also you seem to be the only one complaining.

Could be a problem with the latest patches although i doubt it because its only content from their store."
,Dawnight_04,2011-01-06T15:23Z,"Wow, thank you so much for this!!! I've been looking all over for those and I'm really glad I found it here. :D Thank you so much!!!"
,SolutionXxX,2011-08-09T22:05Z,"PLEASE HELP:I did everything right,and installed the stuff,and in launcher it shows in the installed content tab that it's installed. But,when I go to the game,objects,clothes ,etc. are not there. When I go to the launcher again,the installed content tab is empty(Downloads tab shows the content) What's wrong?"
