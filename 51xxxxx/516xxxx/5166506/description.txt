From Library Journal
The title of HTML and Web Design is somewhat misleading, as the bulk of the book focuses more on advanced technologies such as Java, PHP, ASP, and XHTML. Although the first three chapters do cover HTML basics, tables, and forms, beginning designers will be better served by Virtual Classroom, owing to its clear, in-depth coverage of HTML. The video lessons on the CD-ROM are a fantastic addition, building on concepts introduced in the text and providing an alternative learning method for auditory learners. Recommended for all libraries; larger libraries might consider HTML and Web Design as well.
