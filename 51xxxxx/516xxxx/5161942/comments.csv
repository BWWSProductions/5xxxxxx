,happyass,2009-11-29T07:53Z,Just an odd question but why do movie company's sell new or unreleased movies in other countries before they sell in the U.S.? How is it that other country's have them first?

,sixsixtysix,2009-12-28T06:39Z,"@happyass: it's all about distribution rights. if someone is from another country, sometimes that will get it first or some high-bidder pays more for first distribution. its all industry garbage set to maximize profit (i.e. can charge different places different distribution fees). this whole world wide network is/was supposed to completely level the field."
