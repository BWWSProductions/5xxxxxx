-Normal type is readable, but the light gray text when reading lyrics is a bit more difficult
-The edge areas (incl. Play button, FF buttons, shuffle, album display) look more like they are in ""negative mode"", and actually look more ascetically appealing when screen is viewed negatively (ctrl+cmd+opt+8 Try it out!)
-The top right buttons to close, minimize, and expand look ""eh"", probably for the same reasons above
-Categories (i.e. Name, Time, Artist, Album have too much of a shiny appearance
-White on black looks great though. Its mostly the places where the color is gray that there's the most distaste. 

Cheers! "

The referenced tutorial torrent, while a nice touch, currently has NO SEEDS.  As such, I cannot get a copy of your much lauded publication.

Any help available here?"
,zogulusnig,2009-11-16T22:55Z,"Color me retarded.  Sorry for the alarm.  There aren't any 'published' seeds for this torrent, but I am finding enough via PEX and DHT.

Thanks for the effort!"

Question, I trashed the font but now there's no font at all. It's just blank where the song info and categories should be. How can I replace instead of remove it?"
,ScathRaven,2009-11-26T20:36Z,I trashed the font as well and now i don't have any text. Can you help?
