VRUL, what's wrong with you?  Calling someone an idiot for basically saying thanks for an upload - so what if he calls it a movie? At least he's being appreciative.

Also, if you're going to insult someone for their grammar perhaps you should look at your own:

'Series' has an 's' and there's no apostrophe in '60s'."
