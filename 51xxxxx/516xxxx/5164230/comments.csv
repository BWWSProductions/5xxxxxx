,ExhamPriory,2010-05-01T22:46Z,"badluck why the hell would you guess whether or not it is real and possibly ruin it for everyone. grow a set you asshole. or were you just aching to use some stupid line you either spent way too long coming up with or heard it from someone else and just HAD to use it. FYI doosh, as stupid as the dumbass is, he DOES have a law degree (among other degrees) so congratulations, you are not just lacking cleverness but you are also stupid! ;)
