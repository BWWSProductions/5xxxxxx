Note: Friday November 27th will be my last "early" 64k upload. 
Starting with Nov. 30th and on, I will upload the 128k vbr 
mp3's in the evenings. If you listen a day late, you'll be 
fine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,
you'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will 
be doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending
schedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.

I have also started work on a "how-to" of ripping audio and 
creating torrents from it. It's looking like it will end up
as a multi-page pdf with graphics and I will include the 
(virus-scanned) tools that I use. I want to have it done 
before my partial retirement - it's going to be fairly 
in-depth.
