,XSYLUS,2010-09-01T03:11Z,Episode 14 is missing.  The episode you have labeled as Medea is actually Target and the episode you have labeled as Target is Supernote.  Anyone know where I can get Medea?

,Mattofsweden,2011-04-18T23:39Z,"For a proper DVDRip of both seasons, check this link. The links all work currently. It's a pain in the ass to download, but sooo worth it.

If I had the bandwidth (ADSL 0.4Mb/s upstream :S ) I would have seeded it. If you have, please retain original file names, create a archive filename representing the scene release and upload/seed it.
