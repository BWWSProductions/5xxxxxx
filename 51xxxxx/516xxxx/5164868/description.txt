These are actual calls of people calling IN to resolve various customer service issues. The only problem is that the phone numbers they are calling have been hijacked by RUDE customer care misfits like Junkyard Willie, Jim Bob the Inbred Hillbilly and Blade the Drunken Rocker. Their motto is simple: The Customer is always WRONG. Unsuspecting callers get fed up, then scream, yell and raise hell! It's been said You can't find good help these days ...but it was never THIS bad! Treat customers like this at your work and you'll be out of a job!
