The audio is WAY too quiet on this. I have my TV volume at 100 and my attached stereo at full volume and I can hardly hear most of the movie, as it is a lot of dialogue. Wait for a better rip if you are going to be watching this on TV."

I agree.

Nobody seems to mention it, but English subs are hard-coded:

,vitorgatti,2010-01-09T21:14Z,"@chmacka, subtitles are hard-coded only when another language than English is spoken.

And for who is looking for subtitles, I tried one made for FxM's DVDRip and it's synchronized.
