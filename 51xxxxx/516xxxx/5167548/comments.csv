,ice_vampire,2009-11-24T16:11Z,"In Impostazioni avanzate di Windows Firewall (categoria Regole connessioni in entrata) non compaiono le due voci Daemon Tools Pro...quindi non riesco a ""bloccarle""...di conseguenza tutto quello che segue è inutile...

...qualche soluzione???"

,esounds,2009-11-28T23:16Z,"OK, I followed the steps, now when I start DT using the starter I receive this error

Any help would be appreciated.

TY."
,colt45joe,2009-11-30T08:58Z,"mkay, i followed all the steps except for the windows firewall step because i use a program called comodo for firewall. 

Thing is though, comodo never detected the program trying to access the internet or anything.. so i dont understand why esounds gets that error. 

so, im not really sure if this is working or not..  it says ""evaluation period: 20 days left"" at the top.. is that normal? i'm guessing it will freeze/stay at 20 days if it is working.... will have to see tomorrow. "
,la_cross37,2009-12-09T09:50Z,"how to view the installation notes

1: if you don't have adobe reader go to this site http://www.adobe.com/ --> click get adobe reader --> click run

2: use adobe reader to open ``DaemonTools Pro - Installation guide [NavarTek.org]´´ in your downloaded DAEMON Tools Pro Advanced (this torrent)"
,XscarecrowX,2009-12-14T23:45Z,This shit doesn't work
,golephish,2009-12-15T00:11Z,Thank yOU!
,hellfire2121,2009-12-15T15:49Z,The number of steps needed to get this working is ridiculous.  Whatever happened to just copying a crack to the installation folder?  Surely someone has a clean crack for this software?
,sarkons,2009-12-16T07:41Z,"Works like a charm, thanks man. "
,sarkons,2009-12-16T07:41Z,"Works like a charm, thanks man."
,SintLouis,2009-12-19T22:38Z,"It doesn't work anymore. The version is outdated so you can't pick ""Advanced Trail"" anymore. Does anyone know if it's possible to bypass this or something?"
,ShadowMastr,2009-12-19T22:39Z,"This is not working any longer. Instead of coming up with the evaluation period is over message, it comes up with invalid version, and just keeps going back to the enter your email screen.

I will try this crack method with the newest version that it wants you to download, and see if it works..."
,SintLouis,2009-12-19T22:42Z,"It's unlikely that the same crack would work on the new version... Why do you think they make new versions? To delete bugs? No. To block these cracks. 
I really hope it's going to work, but I think it will. Could you post your results here as fast as possible shadow? I'm quite curious"
,ShadowMastr,2009-12-19T23:09Z,"OK, I downloaded the latest version which is 4.35.0308, installed it, it asks if you are doing paid or trial, when you select trial it doesn't ask for email anymore, it just goes on and installs.

I followed the crack instructions from the after it's installed part, and it all seems to be working ok, guess I'll have to wait a few days to see if the counter still counts down or not. Shows 20 days left, but the purpose of the crack files is to make it think the date never changes... so we'll see...."
,ShadowMastr,2009-12-19T23:24Z,"ok, after further testing it does not work. It booted up a couple times, but after awhile since you can't connect to their server it tells you there's a problem connecting and it won't run until you connect to their site. bummer...."
,SintLouis,2009-12-20T13:16Z,"I word: FUCK :'(

Well, I guess we'll be using the lite version until there is a new crack.."
,SintLouis,2009-12-20T21:25Z,"Everyone, stop seeding. It's a total waste of your internet. It doesn't work anymore"
,Spare1446,2009-12-24T23:29Z,Is this compatible with Windows 7 ?
,airwolf_b,2009-12-27T02:07Z,"I followed the instructions, but there is a new version out and disc-soft.com doesn't support this version anymore and it will not validate the product. I have tried running a few different ways and always get the same error. ""discontinued or invalid product version"""
,xald123,2010-01-03T23:09Z,to clarify for all you morons this is whsat we like to call a beta version (evaluation copy) meaning after a certain amount of time it stops working because they want you to now buy it after trying it for 10-20 days depending when you bought it so this was a trial copy that the trial has run out on
,xald123,2010-01-03T23:10Z,you know if any one was thinking of complaining anymore
,j_pizzle,2010-01-04T02:01Z,"just to let u no daemon tools does not work on win 7 i have it and it says that your os is conflicting with daemon tools and it will not run 

i gona see if maby theres a newer 1 out there"
,gallar,2010-01-07T11:47Z,"so, anybody try to use the virtual date application`?

my date is now stuck at 05.01.2010 and the clock seems to have stopped at 16:00.

,anoniempje112,2010-01-23T16:18Z,"yes i have an idea...

,BrimCat,2010-02-14T20:18Z,"Not sure why people are still saying ""thank you"" for (or even seeding) this. 

It WAS a great upload... but now it does NOT work. It's 14 MB of wasted bandwidth, now."
,xtremflow,2010-02-19T00:33Z,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT ONLY HAVE COKIES AND ADVERTISING FROM LOEIM AND MAKE YOUR HOME PAGE ASK.COM THAT SHIT IS THE SAME THAT YOU DOWNLOAD IN DAEMON TOOL PAGE WHY YOU LOST YOURMITE DONWLOAD AND PUT A TORRENT OF THE SAME SHIT

,BrimCat,2010-02-20T19:46Z,"You obviously haven't d/led and installed this, shiva. The product is expired and won't go passed that part of the installation. Find another copy, as this one is no longer useful."
,Crazy Bastard,2010-02-26T23:05Z,"This version is not cracked, am i right?

is there a cracked version up?"
,Cgoff87,2010-03-16T08:07Z,It doesnt work. DAEMON tools requires your e-mail then they're supposed to send you a verification code that you use to access the trial. After getting in then you crack the software. DAEMON TOOLS DOES NOT SEND VERIFICATION KEYS FOR THIS TRIAL ANYMORE!
,sarcastos,2010-03-16T17:20Z,"Your all idiots, read the comments before you download and you'll have no reason to look as fucking retarded as you do. fucking americans."
,sickduck2,2010-03-22T22:02Z,"@j_pizzle

Yes it does work with Windows 7, don't spread stupid shit around without verifying it first.  I'm running it right now."
