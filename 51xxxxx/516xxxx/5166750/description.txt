This is my first torrent. I'm not really sure if I made it right or not. I hope I did, but if I didn't I'm sorry. There is no problem with me seeding it, because it's been on my computer for 2 years now and probably will be on there 2 more. I hope this torrent works, and I hope everyone enjoys this great series.
