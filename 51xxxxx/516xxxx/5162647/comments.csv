,mym8,2009-11-29T20:21Z,any one got five ?
,capitanqueso,2009-12-31T04:53Z,"Thanks, You really need to put the rip group (ie FOV, BiA, etc) cause the sync on subtitles changes from a file to another, It'll be appreciated. Thanks."
,maubs,2010-01-04T04:27Z,Where is episode 5? Don't leave us hanging!
,uffesnuffe,2010-01-06T03:14Z,"Episode 5 seems only to be available from shitty sites that charge you for the download or demands that you register and enter birthdates etc and then claim that you do not fit their profile. (Of course I enter false dates in such cases). 
Has anyone done a better research than I, then please post your findings here."
,uffesnuffe,2010-01-08T23:00Z,You can forget my comment above now. A friendly soul has uploaded episode 5: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5268914/collision.S01E05.HDTV.xvid.avi
