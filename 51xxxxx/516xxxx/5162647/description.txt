Remember that movie Crash? It was about a group of strangers thrown together by a freeway pile-up. It told a surprising, often uplifting tale of prejudice and stereotypes. Well, forget that, this is ITV, the spiritual home of proper car-crash TV.

Spread over five nights this week, it begins with the detective (Douglas Henshall) opening his investigation into a pile-up on the A12 in Essex. From the photos on his wall we know who will live and who will die.

We then go back to the day before the crash and meet the people whose destinies collide.

It really is an accident waiting to happen.

Among them are acting brothers Craig Kelly (from Corrie and kicked out of Strictly at the weekend) and Dean Lennox Kelly (Shameless) playing brothers for the first time, Lenora Crichlow (Being Human) and a raft of top-notch talent including Phil Davis, David Bamber and Sylvia Syms.

Most have something to hide.
