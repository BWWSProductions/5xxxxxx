This is a conversion from this bluray rip "http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5132965/Up.1080p.Bluray.x264-CBGB" to a WMV file so I can stream it straight to my Xbox.  I hope this helps those that dont know how to stream HD videos to xbox with an encoder.   (mine kept getting out of sync)




Bolt - 1080p - Video codec=WMV 9 - bitrate 7000 kbps - Audio code=WMA Pro - 192 kbps.




enjoy!
