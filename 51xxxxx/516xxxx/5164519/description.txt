About this:
When Sam pilfers a box of Lewbert's "deeply meaningful stuff," the kids discover he once had a happy life with a woman named Marta. Since he seemed happier with Marta, they decide to track her down and reunite the two. Meanwhile, Spencer is partnered with Chuck to track down a burglar who has been stealing television remotes throughout the complex. Marta and Lewbert reunite but little did the kids know, Marta is a domineering psychopath who spawned Lewbert's misfortune. In the end, Spencer discovers Chuck was stealing the remotes and calls the police, but Lewbert takes the blame so he can be locked up away from Marta.
