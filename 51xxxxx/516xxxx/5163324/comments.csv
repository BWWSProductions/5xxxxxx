,kutuztov,2010-12-13T06:12Z,"@NotSoPrettyRikki 

Uh, yeah, it installs the files so you can browse it like a website."
,JohnTesh,2010-12-31T09:04Z,"@NotSoPrettyRikki (and any others suspicious of exes): scan it, scan it again on virustotal and then extract it safely wherever you want with 7zip.

@kutuztov: uh, yeah, shut your pie hole. last time i checked exe files just might maybe perhaps be able to carry malware."
