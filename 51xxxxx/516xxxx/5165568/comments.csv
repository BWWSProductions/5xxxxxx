[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T17:05Z,"angel40204 all have right to his opinion  but  do you really think a Group Like Imagine would release a bad movie only to give some more shit?
I think not! You verdict will stand for you! No Scene group would ever put a 1Gib on  and drag their name in dirt.So my friend sale on I don?t know who you belong to.:("
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T17:06Z,Thanks for help me seed :) This is a good release!
[V],neon,2009-11-16T17:52Z,sources say this is the best release so far with very good video and better audio than the others so thanks murlock i'll give this one a go. 
,joseMD,2009-11-16T17:59Z,Can somebody make and show screens from this release?
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T18:12Z,"joseMD You have that at the .nfo take a look and
to you my friend Trusted catsout  I hope you like it :)"
,jiveclive,2009-11-16T18:36Z,"Ok, Murlok, I read the comments. I'm gunna dl and if I like it I'll seed at least 1:1 but if not, I am gunna ask for my money back. If you have confidence in your product, I know you will agree to these terms.

Aw, nah man. I'm just messin' with ya. But it beats bitching at ya, don't it? 

Well, there you go then. :)"
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T18:48Z,jiveclive  LOL
,darkgurl,2009-11-16T19:14Z,"sample looks good! i'll hepl seed it when i'm done, but my upload speed seems to cap at 64k/sec :o("
,lordmichael,2009-11-16T19:26Z,"Many thanks, however from the sample I prefer the original Russian video without the re-encode. Is it an easy matter to mux Imagine's audio with the original Russian video? The run times seem to be different so possibly not..."
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T19:55Z,Thanks for help me seed :)
,DrChandra,2009-11-16T20:48Z,"this is very good. great audio and video for a cam but the stass version that's only 733MB is actually better than this 2.1GB version.
and it's a 2.5hour long movie. but the stass is still clearly better. this one has processing artifacts and perhaps a frame rate conversion issue. the stass is just clearly better"
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T21:14Z,ProfessorSocks I seed about 900kb/sec and I hope the convertX is from me also mate :)
,DrChandra,2009-11-16T21:24Z,"correction, the stass version has significant audio sync issue. as much as 1 second in the middle. this one is much better. so it's a tradeoff"
,leinadgrothesk,2009-11-16T21:55Z,please seed...please... i've got like 200 up and 27 downspeed..c'mon... thx to murlok for the copy!!!
