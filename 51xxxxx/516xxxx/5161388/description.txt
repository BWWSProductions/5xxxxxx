| SOUR has been releasing good quality drum'n'bass, jungle & oldskool rips to |  
|    the internet drum'n'bass public since summer 1999. Originally a small    |  
|       operation, we have now reached levels of international acclaim.       |  
|                                                                             |  
|  SOUR is dedicated to both the availability and promotion of music to the   |  
|  public, and our rips are intended to reflect these ideals. Specifically:   |  
|                                                                             |  
| . SOUR is dedicated to the promotion of new music that is currently         |  
|   available to buy. If you like something you hear, you are obliged to      |  
|   attempt to purchase an original copy.                                     |  
|                                                                             |  
| . SOUR is dedicated to the promotion of old music that may no longer be     |  
|   available to buy.                                                         |  
|                                                                             |  
| . SOUR is dedicated to the expansion and infiltration of drum'n'bass        |  
|   worldwide! We provide a service where none is available, specifically in  |  
|   many remote countries where traditional distributors can not afford to    |  
|   target. Also, the availability of drum'n'bass in an easily accessible     |  
|   form expands the potential for real world sales to people who may not     |  
|   otherwise have considered buying drum'n'bass.                             |  
|                                                                             |  
| . SOUR is dedicated to the expansion of the online and offline real world   |  
|   scenes. With more listeners enjoying what they hear, clubs and venues can |  
|   only expect MORE people to attend events; DJ's can only expect MORE       |  
|   people to pay to see THEM.                                                |  
|                                                                             |  
| By accident of today's current real world distribution arrangements, many   |  
|   artists will find that SOUR releases IMPROVE their real world sales;      |  
|  especially for items only on vinyl. This is the basis upon which SOUR      |  
|                                 operates.                                   |
