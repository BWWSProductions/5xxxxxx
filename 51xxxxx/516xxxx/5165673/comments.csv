,Mav55th,2009-11-20T07:24Z,No audio.  Vista with Media Player 11.  Do I need a different audio codec?
,Uvall,2009-11-20T08:15Z,The file is using 5.1 audio.  Try downloading and installing AC3Filter.  It is a free download and will let media player play the 5.1 audio.

,futurehillbillies,2010-02-07T14:50Z,I downloaded the AC3filter. Can't figure out what I've done wrong but I'm still not getting any sound. Any suggestions?
,squallloire,2010-04-13T22:19Z,"@futurehillbillies: Goto http://www.videolan.org and download VLC media player. It's free, lightweight, and will play pretty much any video file with audio without needed extra codecs installed.

@aust77: Some of us buy the things we like once we've downloaded them. It's called supporting the industry when it does good ;)"
