Calling TalmudTimmy:
-------------------
From Infowars: ADL Calls Alex Jones â€œConspiracy King,â€ 
Insinuates He Should be Removed from Society

...The ADL has launched a new purge against its political enemies in the form of a major report that equates skepticism and distrust of government with â€œa 

toxic atmosphere of rage,â€ which is threatening to boil over in the form of violence, specifically targeting Alex Jones as â€œThe Conspiracy Kingâ€ and 

inferring that people upset with Barack Obamaâ€™s policies are potential mass murderers.

The tone of the ADLâ€™s hit piece basically implies that Alex Jones and his ilk are such a threat to the establishment that they should be removed from 

society, which ironically is exactly how Hitler dealt with his political enemies in Nazi Germany. The ADL is allegorically pinning a yellow star on 

â€œconspiracy theorists,â€ Oath Keepers, Tea Party protesters, and anyone else who dares express dissent in response to the financial looting of the country 

or Barack Obamaâ€™s big government agenda...
