This CD,timed to mark 70 years since the Second World War began, is full of musical curios representing a plucky Britain under siege. It is jammed with spirit-raising jollity tinged with a raw ache for peace. Typical is Vera Lynns Its A Lovely Day Tomorrow, all fleapit Wurlitzer and tea dance shuffle, yet still hopeful. Theres boisterousness, represented by Flanagan & Allen, Glenn Miller and the Andrews Sisters, but the songs that sound best outside their historical context are slowies such as the Ink Spots Whispering Grass and Marlene Dietrichs Lili Marlene.A great nostalgic trip down memory lane.
