,datora,2010-09-27T03:57Z,"so, what's teh fcuk? This one replaces your other Yankovic torrent?  would've killed you to make a note in the description?  damned shame to rip this @128 bitrate.  that's so 15 years ago.  seriously, weird al puts out some quality sound and this just clips the shit out of it. looking to replace several stolen CDs of mine and this ... do not want."
