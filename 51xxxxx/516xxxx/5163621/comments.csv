This is a superb album -- great music for having hot sex! I'd love to have the FLAC version for my very own. Thanks to whoever might be reading this, from kimeesteres in the Netherlands."
[T],kimeesteres,2010-03-10T02:50Z,"I finally got it! I'm now seeding from the Netherlands. Many thanks to the three seeders (two U.S., one Italia) who patiently downloaded to me over a two-day period. Happy listening, everybody!"
[T],kimeesteres,2010-03-18T23:14Z,"This is a -great- remaster, and I am seeding it from the Netherlands, but if you want it, you'll have to be VERY patient. The feed is as slow as molasses. As in, days to get the full file!

Maybe if we caught a couple more seeders, the download rate wouldn't be so low...?"
