As has been stated, the Diverse rip goes out of synch when played on a standalone media player, like a portable hard drive connected to a TV, but perfectly in synch when played with VLC on a computer. The Diverse rip is the best quality, and that includes the 720p rip, if you aren't using your TV's media player. I would have preferred to play the Diverse directly through my TV, but burned it to a DVD to resolve the synch issue. It's the only choice if you want to use subtitles. The subs don't synch well with the altered audio on this version."
