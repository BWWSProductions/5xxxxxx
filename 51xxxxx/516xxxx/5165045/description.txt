Hey.

If any of you tried to grab Diverse's rip of this film (@ http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5086082/Frequently.Asked.Questions.About.Time.Travel.DVDRip.XviD-DiVERSE), and tried to play it on a standalone DVD player or PS3, you would have noticed Sync issues.

This is a transcode of the file that repairs the audio sync by modifying the audio bitrate. The video is a streamed copy, so the excellent quality of the original should be unimpaired.

I have tested this file in both a PS3 as well as a Philips Divx Compatible DVD player, and sync was spot on.

Have fun!

P.S. For those of you who haven't seen the film, its a great british sci-fi comedy in the vein of the Hitchhiker's Guide...
