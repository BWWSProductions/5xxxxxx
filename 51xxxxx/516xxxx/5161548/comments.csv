,eddboy876,2009-11-15T04:38Z,"This is such a terrible show, yet I still watch it. Explain to me why? :\"
,zen-TAO,2009-11-15T06:33Z,"Thanks!

But: I really need to say this.
Although I have only seen the first 6 episodes,
I think that this show really, really must get a
grip on it self. Othervise I dont think it will
be a 2nd season...

Peace and Love!

,raider56,2009-11-15T13:15Z,"I'm with you eddboy876! I watch this crap too, but don't know why. Maybe i'm waiting for a scen with Amanda Tapping? Love her! Maybe I liked Stargate SG-1 and hopes this one will add up to that? Or maybe it's so little good Sci-Fi so I have to watch wathever I get? But I have no idea what this show is about yet. They better get a grip... or get canceled. And what's up with all the sexscenes in some one elses body? Creepy!"
,kadaver123,2009-11-15T14:05Z,"this episode was crap, the open ending wtf. timelines and shit. what happens in next episode, they fixed it without us showing. nothign happens with all the feelings that were outed, eli loves chloe, his mother got hiv and so on. none of which they know of cause they went thru 3 time travels."
,tonyhawkseeriad,2009-11-15T14:40Z,There is no bette Stargate than SG-1. For me O'Neil was the heart of the show.
,elazard,2009-11-15T15:32Z,i lol so hard at the people who think sg1 is better than this jesus sg1 was the worst show ever
,martinfromdublin,2009-11-16T22:02Z,Anyone having issues with the tracer(s)???
,martinfromdublin,2009-11-16T22:03Z,Anyone having issues with the tracker(s)??
,capnpat,2009-11-17T22:28Z,"thx as always eztv...i echo snivel...u da shitz!
@jahnee...get a life, would u?  complaining about eztv's work here is like complaining to mother nature for providing a sunny day!

...pretty sure no-one would agree with you that the non-720p versions are crap...those of u that want to d/l the 720p versions - great...but for the rest of us, we're just fine with the (ahem) ""lesser"" version.

...and yes, I realize ppl like u only post comments like that to get a reaction out of others, so consider ur efforts successful this time.

,Alexandru_I,2011-01-01T11:57Z,"hey man, great job. but do you know where i can find episode 9 from season 1? it seems it's missing from here, and i don't trust any other uploaders (plus it works slow as shit from them). thank you."
