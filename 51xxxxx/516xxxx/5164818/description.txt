SIBERIA 
Accounting for around 10 per cent of the worldâ€™s dry land, Siberia is famous as a brutally cold place. Yet it is home to a diverse range of habitats and animal life â€“ including musk deer, camels, gazelles and the extraordinary Siberian salamander, which can spend years encased in -40Â°C ice and still survive. Exploring from the frozen north to the southern steppes, this is the real Siberia.
