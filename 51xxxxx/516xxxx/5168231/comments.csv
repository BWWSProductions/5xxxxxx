,cbath,2010-03-26T23:12Z,"Thank you -- this is the ""Special Edition"" release, which is as close to David Fincher's vision as we're going to get.

""For the first time fans are able to purchase and admire a complete restaurated and revised version of the workprint which was created in 1991. This Special Edition had, beside a runtime of additional 30 minutes, new sequences and a fascinating view on the difficulties which occurred during the cutting of the movie. This version also provides the viewer with a combination of exceptional and unreleased optical effects and some recently completed digital effects which were essential to integrate the new material into the movie.

This Special Edition gives the unique opportunity to see the lost work of an exceptional director. Theatrical version:110:09 min
Special Edition: 133:28 min ""
