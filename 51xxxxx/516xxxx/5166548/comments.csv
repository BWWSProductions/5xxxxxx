,plhnt,2009-12-10T05:43Z,Hey HolyRoses. Love the stuff you've got and have for a while now. I noticed you include some tutorial like torrents for the Handheld stuff...what about this Highres stuff? What are you using for that? Are you starting with Blu-Ray and then converting it with ???? Thanks a ton. I'm about to test it extending it to my xbox360 w/ Win7 MediaCenter.
,plhnt,2009-12-10T07:58Z,"Sorry, but when you say before, are you talking about a certain tutorial? Are you using a DVD? I agree, it looks awesome and I have a pretty big DVD collection so want to mimic it if I can. Thanks again. "
,plhnt,2009-12-11T00:27Z,"And are these Blu-Ray or just DVD? Just a fun little fact for you. I tested out Partly.Cloudy.x264 and A.Christmas.Story.x264 on win7 Media Center and worked like a charm. So did xbox360. I also tried it out on the iPhone 3GS and you probably already know this but it also worked 100%. And it looked AMAZINGLY clear.  Thats why I want to try and copy however you are doing this....I only need to convert one copy and I'm done....I dont need a copy for the 360, and then another copy for my iPhone, etc..."
,plhnt,2009-12-14T07:53Z,Definitely Confirmed. Cloudy and Terminator Salvation 720p both played on the 3GS. Also was able to transfer a 1080p trailer and get that working as well. Apple doesn't officially allow it yet (not syncing anything over 480 x 320 through iTunes) but the hardware can handle it. Just have to use and app called FileApp to get it on the iPhone without iTunes. TVout doesn't work doing it this way though but I'm sure there is another way to get that working. That's insane you can get a Blu-Ray source down to 1.5 GB. That must take forever. I can get a Linux Virtual Machine setup easy enough for the encode-handheld.pl encoding but I have a feeling doing it this way would easily double the time it takes. How long does it take for a typical start to finish of a movie? Thanks for the info. and the torrents. 
,appletvdude,2010-03-08T03:11Z,"No, you can go up to 1280x720 @ 24FPS or 960x540 @ 30 FPS.

There is a hardware hack out there called crystal HD that'll allow you go up to 1080P on the ATV, and I hear that it works well.

Biggest problem with anything higher than 720p on the ATV is that it's not supported due to hardware limitations (to go higher, you have to 'modify' your ATV with something like Boxee or XBMC then you can play any video format, but the high def really puts the ATV at it's limits since the decoding is done by the built-in processor and not the video processor).

I've not gotten this one yet, but I'm sure it'll play fine on the ATV like all of your encodes do.  Thanks!"
