        Auction Auto Bidder is now better than ever With Version 5.0!

        Auction Auto Bidder 4.1 was already by far the most sold sniper
        software on eBay, now version 5.0 adds a ton of features to an
        already superior software!

        What's new in 5.0?

        Â· Bid group support (group several auctions of an item you want,
          and the software will automatically attempt to win one after
          the other in the group until one of them is won at your maximum
          bid or less, and then cancels the bids on the other items in
          the group, this prevents you from having to wait and see if you
          are outbid and then find another item) 
        Â· Built in tabbed web browser (open multiple web pages and switch
          between them in a single click)
        Â· Favorites menu allows you to add your favorite pages such as
          searches, sellers, or any other webpage 
        Â· New easier to use interactive items list with one click access
          to all options 
        Â· Powerful list filter option allows you to apply one or more
          filters too see only the items you want 
        Â· Fully supports using international eBay websites 
        Â· Ability to leave notes for items 
        Â· Three view modes (list & browser, list only, browser only) 
        Â· Auto Scroll (automatically scrolls down pages and goes to next
          result pages to allow hands free browsing) 
        Â· Now detects when "Place Bid" button is pressed on auction page
          and the program opens the bid dialog 
        Â· Auto sign in now works on ebay.co.uk and other international
          English eBay websites 
        Â· Displays lock sign in status bar when displayed webpage is over
          a secure connection 
        Â· Ability to bid as little as 1 second before the end 
        Â· "Frequently Asked Questions" added to Help menu 


        What's the catch? Why is this superior software being sold for
        about the same price as the competition?

        There's no catch, the fact that Auction Auto Bidder is by far the
        most sold sniper on eBay is what allows this superior software to
        be sold for such a low price! But this low price may not stay
        forever, depending on the success of this new version, the price
        may be increased.

        No hidden fees or monthly costs, only a one time purchase price.
        Guaranteed to not contain any spyware and adware.

        Bidder is the best, you will then need to come back to this
        auction page when you are ready to purchase the software.


        Why snipe (bid in the last seconds) rather than use eBay's
        proxy-bidding?

        Â· Win items at a lower cost since no one will have time to outbid
          you, if you bid a long time before the end, eBay will email the
          previous high bidder to let them know they've been outbid so
          they will most likely come back and outbid you causing the
          price to increase, this software prevents this and often pays
          for itself on the first use 
        Â· Increase your chances of winning since people wont have time to
          outbid you 
        Â· You can decide to remove your bid up to the last minute since
          it is only sent to eBay in the last seconds

        Also works as a fully featured web browser optimized to make
        browsing eBay faster & easier.

        Very easy to use
        Auction Auto Bidder is so simple to use that anyone, including
        novice computer users can be using it within minutes without even
        having to read instructions, thanks to the user friendly
        interface and wizards which make installing and setting up a
        snipe as simple as entering your maximum bid! Auction Auto Bidder
        will automatically retrieve the item details and do the rest.

          allows up to 4 users in the same household)
