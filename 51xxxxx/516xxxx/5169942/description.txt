Here's a few E-books from conservative writer, journalist, and political commentator, Bernard Goldberg. In this torrent there are 3 out of 5 books written by him. Found all 3 of them on eMule. The 2 missing books are listed below. If you have the missing E-books (not audio books), please send it/them to spacehole.swords@gmail.com. I will update the torrent as I get more and more books. Once again, it all depends on you. Oh, and please seed if you like the books.

THE BOOKS: Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How The Media Distort The News (v1.0)
           Arrogance: Rescuing America from the Media Elite
           100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (and Al Franken is #37)


WHAT'S MISSING: Crazies to the Left of Me, Wimps to the Right: How One Side Lost Its Mind, and the Other Lost Its Nerve

NOTE: Also, if anyone has "110 People Who Are Screwing Up America" and feel like sharing, it would be much appreciated if you could share it with me. I'll be sure to include it on this collection.
