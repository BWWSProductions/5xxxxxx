Mose Allison - Autumn Song 
Year: 1959 (Prestige)
Label: OJC (Dig. remastered, 1996)
Total time: 35:00

Recorded in Hackensack, New Jersey on February 13, 1959

Mose Allison recorded six albums as a leader for Prestige during 1957-59, an era when he was better known as a jazz pianist than as a folk/country blues vocalist and masterful lyricist.  On this CD reissue of his final Prestige date, Allison (in a trio with bassist Addison Farmer and drummer Ronnie Free) performs seven instrumentals ( including "It's Crazy," "Autumn Song" and "Groovin' High" ) but it is the three vocals ( "Eyesight To The Blind," "That's All Right" and Duke Ellington's "Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me" ) that are most memorable.  One realizes why Allison was soon emphasizing his vocals; he was a much more distinctive singer than pianist although his piano playing was actually pretty inventive.  This is an excellent all-round set. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG
