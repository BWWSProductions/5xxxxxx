,LJE111,2011-10-30T02:03Z,"Many thanks for the great up!!

Also wondering where to get the English subs for this. The DVD comes with English and Spanish subtitles but I didn't see them in the downloaded files. 

I love Amit Goswami and i think he is brilliant - but I can only understand about one of every three words!

Please help. :-D"
