,TVClassicFun,2009-11-27T19:43Z,"In advance, that's for all your efforts on this series. And now with it ending after 19 years, you get to take a break before grabbing onto another project. Since 'they' are going to start at the very begining and showing the original season 1 starting in March, 2010, but they've been on VHS/DVD for years no need to cap.
May Kamen Rider have a run like this!"
