,BPirates,2009-11-14T16:25Z,"Must be fake, it isn't even out on mac yet. Besides, how is the DMG 11GB!? Call of Duty MW was only about 6GB with the crack. This MUST be fake."
,c1derz,2009-11-14T19:04Z,"Bpirates, it's about 11G on windows too, and it's a cider port, not a native mac version, so it's very possible it's working."
,bigdaddyrob2g,2009-11-14T20:11Z,Yes this is working. the game is 11 gigs. Its Huge. It works on my mac book air and 2 year old imac.

,xxnewfolderxx,2009-11-15T09:53Z,"To the people saying its a fake.
If you would use like 30 seconds of your time  and google ""modern warfare 2 cider"" in google you would see that there is a working wrapper. And since wrapper requires a installed version of the game( which is probably weights a lot more than 11gb), this looks very legit.
To got1t0r, this torrent is only on this tracker and everyone except the seeder have approx. 29%.
So clearly your friend is imaginary."

,Stiffler01,2009-11-18T11:00Z,"there is only one seeder and that is bigdaddyrob2g the uploader of the game.

,Stiffler01,2009-11-18T11:01Z,the upload speed you have is logically the transfer of all data before 74% so thats why.

,millhouse9,2009-11-19T23:07Z,downloading at 700k/s...91% done...hope this works!
,blackdiamond00,2009-11-19T23:10Z,"heey bigdaddy, can you play online with the multiplayer???"
,andrik55,2009-11-19T23:12Z,"i see from the vid that we share the same interest in some games. AKA AOE 3, Halo, Prey and Splinter cell. Prob got them form the same torrents too llol"
,bigdaddyrob2g,2009-11-19T23:46Z,you cant play mutli player unless you use a hacked server or buy a legit serial number.
,babeslay9,2009-11-20T00:06Z,The god damn second seeder ditched... it's gonna take me 12-14 hours or so from 92%. Rob could you please get another seed going? Just one more would make life so much easier.
,babeslay9,2009-11-20T00:10Z,and rob haha we know u have at least four macs... or so you did. i remember the comments on ur XPS SL release ;p
,wjlee91,2009-11-20T00:12Z,"lol even if he does, it's still the same internet he's using"
,babeslay9,2009-11-20T00:16Z,...or he could just run one from a friend's house or something
,andrik55,2009-11-20T00:17Z,yea dude just limit the upload speed and the download speed to like 1 meg and your router should take it
,wjlee91,2009-11-20T00:29Z,notice that i've said that twice through these comments

At present, there is no working multiplayer fix for MW2 in existence (though I'm sure it's being worked on).

Once, and if, it comes out it should be fairly trivial to apply the fix made for the windows MW2 to our Cider port.

The poster of this torrent can't apply a multiplayer fix and upload it for everybody if it doesn't exist. So don't give him grief about not providing it.

Although, it's actually not unlikely that there'll never be a working multiplayer fix for this game, since it's a Steam game. But keep your fingers crossed."

1. Download and install Steam via Crossover. If you need it dl it from this torrent.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4971142/CrossOver_8_Pro

2. Right click on the MW2 icon, hit show package contents. Open the ""Contents"" folder than open ""Info.plist."" If you have x-code installed it will open in PL Editor, if not it will open in Text Edit.

3. Scroll down about three quarters of the way until you see the line that ends in ""iw4sp.exe.""

4. To get multiplayer to correctly launch, change ""iw4sp.exe"" to ""iw4mp.exe,"" than save the plist.

5. Login Steam, put your windows key code or find a cracked iw4mp so you can play without a key.

6. Launch CoD MW2 and you'll be running in MP! To change back to single just change the iw4mp.exe back to iw4sp.exe.

,imabigkid,2009-12-02T05:24Z,"Hey guys I'm going to be nice and NOT be one of those who come in here and go OMFG THE GAME WORKZ THANKX and leave. I'm going to try to help as much as I can k?

First off the game WORKS.

I am on a Macbook Pro With a 2.2GHZ Intel Core 2 Duo and 4GB of RAM and GeForce 8600M GT 128MB NVIDIA.

How to Install :

First: go here : http://www.unrarx.com/
Download it.

Second: Once you are done downloading the file should be a UnrarX format..if not open it with UnrarX and it will take about 10-15 minutes to extract!

Please note SAVE the download and do not delete it because if the game crashes and something happens..you can always re-do these steps!

Third: Once you are done extracting it will say ""OK"" in the bottom and no activity should happen on the UnrarX! Go into the folder where your download was and you should see a new folder called ""Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"" drag and drop this ENTIRE folder into your Applications Folder!

Fourth : Click on the icon inside this folder!

Five : Follow the instructions below if you run into problems!

Six: Happy Gaming =P

So those are MY SPECS and it works great with no lag in fact the optimal performance the game detects for MY specs are HIGH settings but I usally turn it down a notch to Medium to get no lag  at all! 

Now the download is bugged...but with patience you can play it.

How I solved the black screen :
Now I am not sure about the other people who played the game and got a black screen but what I noticed so far is you don't get the black screen if you play in ""Recruit Mode"" When I tried Beginner I got the black screen with only sound =( so try that. Also before it launches the game it will ask you ""Do you want to set optimal Performance bla bla"" click NO

Also in game for Video Options > Advance Options > Anti Aliasing> 2x  (try this also and see if that helps)

Some people said that when they exit the game with Control+Option+ESC the game will never work again and you have to re-install. It won't the first time you click it. What I did when this happened to me was I simply rebooted and clicked on the icon again, and BAM it worked again!

As for ATI chip-set..I am not sure if the game will run on it =S but this game should run on NVIDIA.


Good luck guys,
imabigkid.
Cheers! =)"
,imabigkid,2009-12-02T05:44Z,"In regards to the top where I stated ""Also before it launches the game it will ask you ""Do you want to set optimal Performance bla bla"" click NO""

First try and click yes and then do all the other stuff I said above and change the screen resolution to whatever you screen is.

Just a correction =)

Cheers!."

1. If COD modern warfare isn't in applications already move it there

2. get steam FOR MAC not the windows version that runs through crossover,,

http://snow-leopard.ning.com/page/steam-for-mac (havnt tried this one but it should be the same)  

3, Download http://www.qurlyq.com/7j3 (u have to fill out survays but just write random stuff)

4, UNRAR all of the files and replace the files in applications-->Modern WarFare 2.app (rightclick show package contents) /Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activision/Modern Warfare 2 

5, Then go to applications/modernwarfare2/contents/info.plist (open in text edit) then about 3/4 of the way down change 
c:\Programme\Activision\Modern Warfare 2\iw4sp.exe
to
c:\Programme\Activision\Modern Warfare 2\iw4mp.exe

change the iw4sp.exe to iw4mp.exe then save

6, Finaly go into your mac version of steam and login to your account, then go to file --> settings --> friends and change your nickname to somthing with a space in it, i was sanjeb and now i am sanjeb 123, so yer,

7, NOW this is very important, go to MY GAMES tab on steam and click on add-non steam game, then click browse, then at the top pull down menu click z:\ then navagate to applications then to your cod modern warfare 2 folder 
applications-->Modern WarFare 2.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activision/Modern Warfare 2/IW4MP.EXE and then add it to the games list, then just open it from in steam and it should be running,,

Depends on your specifications on your MacBook.
I recommend setting your quality to the lowest setting (640xsomething) and closing all other applications, including Airport so you do not get the IWNET error. And disable shadows and dynamic lighting and all those other unnecessary graphic settings."

Gus stop saying the hole ""if you don't got Nvidia graphics card then it don't work cause I don't have Nvidia graphics"" I have ATi and i can play it.

For those with ATI download Crossover games. When it is done downloading (With this torrent you should have Cod 6 folder when done downloading)
Go in the folder, instead of just double clicking the app just right click and go into ""Show package content""
Content/Resources/Transgaming/c_drive/Programme/Activison/Modern warfare 2

From there you should see two things one says ""iw4sp.exe"" or ""iw4mp.exe"" click on iw4sp, crossover should show up and install it into a bottle. then you should either see a blank box or one with mw 2 either way it should work. enjoy playing everyone. Questions?"

,kolarius,2010-09-02T10:57Z,"I would love a detailed way to get the past the ""Steam must be running to play this game"" error.
I have installed Steam from http://store.underpowered.com/about/ . Then i open that, log into my account, and while it is running try to open the COD MW 2.

It says ""Steam must be running to play this game"" straight away. Then i close Steam completely and open COD MW 2 and the title screen opens then pauses.

Also i got the IWNET error, but how are we supposd to turn of the internet and play multiplayer? This doesnt make any sense,
btw i have windows xp service pack 3

thanks in adnvace!"
,xtrmnt,2010-09-16T14:14Z,"The game is pretty smooth for me. fps rate according to atmonitor is 8-65 fps, @ 720x640. But all players are blinking (yes, as if they have flashing lights in them). Can anyone help me?

,hellolol,2010-10-28T05:02Z,"people r supposed to blink

,Hshin,2010-11-24T00:57Z,"Saw this playing on someone's MBP, 9600M GT motherfrakking beast, not your whiny little 9400M or even 320M. This is 9600, better performance even than HD5470 in most current laptops. This Cider port simply brought the MBP to its knees! Then the MBP guy showed it to me, it was running under performance mode, not power saving. Then he booted into Boot Camp, under XP the game runs like it's on fire. At least 500X faster, no lag, no stutter. 

So I just wanna say, whoever ported this, and whoever downloaded this... My heart goes out to you mang. You deserve a medal for braving the stupid.

My advice. Get the PC version. It's only 5GB. And if you have it hard for Mac, then get the wrapper from some forum (use google), wrap that fucker in, and save yourself all this shock and awe that wil surely come later when you discover the jaw-dropping awful framerate."
,hallow,2010-11-26T21:04Z,"SOLUTION FOR BLACK SCREEN PROBLEM AND DISAPPEARING ON DOCK PROBLEM: UNPACK WITH UNRARX. THIS WILL FIX ALL PROBLEMS. DONT UNPACK WITH ANYTHING ELSE. AS SOON AS YOU CLICK THE ICON IT WILL START

ALSO DONT HAVE YOUR INTERNET ON WHEN U PLAY IT, OTHERWISE U WILL GET AN ERROR"
,MacDean,2011-04-12T19:22Z,PLEASE SEED GUYS.. JUST SEED. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS GAME ON A MAC.. SO PLEASE SEED!!
,patiodude,2011-04-22T00:27Z,"This is quite discouraging, and I don't appear to be the only person with this problem: The download was quite fast, less than 24 hrs, but when I mounted the .dmg and copied the file to Applications, it launched, and only the audio worked. The screen was entirely black, no matter if I was in safe mode or not. I could probably play the game through entirely, but only with audio. If anyone knows a solution to this problem, please speak up.
