,Pervie_Priestess,2009-11-22T10:20Z,"This was a good movie, content wise. Video was pretty clear though I must point out from the perspective you shot the film, it cut off all the original subtitles to the movie. If you've got the time and patience, you might wanna try to replace them.  

To clear out a great amount of the noise I used VLC player vs. the KMP player I started out using. I tried playing around with both audio adjustments to no avail. If anyone figures something out, plz post back. And though that helped some it still had moments when the noise was overwhelming. 

Overall, it was still a worthwhile venture to watch. 

Video: 9/10
Audio: 5/10 (cleared out 7/10)"
