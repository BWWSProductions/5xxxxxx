Shirley Bassey -You Ain't Heard Nothing Yet (1985 HTV)


This came off a Woolworths retail VHS so don't expect too much on the high quality meter. Try and concentrate on the performance of DSB ;-)

Also enlosed DVD covers (from VHS artwork) which I've tidied up. If you print off as is (don't resize) they will print nicely.

HTV Television 1985.

Added bonus of Shirley Bassey Sings Bond.

Yes, pretty poor show from this ill-thought out album. Vocals are OK but the music is truly awful.

Only uploading it as I like her version of Nobody Does it Better and so people can hear how NOT to arrange/play great Bond music even if the accompanying singer is great.
