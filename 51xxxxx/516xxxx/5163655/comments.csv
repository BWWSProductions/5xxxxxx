Video: 2012 CAM XviD-CAMELOT
Audio: 2012 (2009) ENGLISH CAM XviD-MAX
search for 2012 CAM (ENG) Mixed Sources
Check out the sample. The guy did a good job at mixing them and it's synced up right and looks and sounds decent enough to watch. These other versions are not even viewable."

If you really want to see the movie i would say stop bitching and just download it.
If you want to see it in better quality, than either go to the cinemas and see it or wait, cus they will upload a better one as soon as its available."
