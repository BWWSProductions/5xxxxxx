The most prominent liberal on the radio (Rachel Maddow notwithstanding) is Thom Hartmann. He's a best-selling author of 18 books for good reason. If you had to upload just one radio show, it really should be him in my view. He's intellectually head and shoulders above the others. And people stand to learn the most from him, his strident polemics, and his insightful debates."
