'Making Winter Days Longer' is sorced from 320kbps whenever possible.  Continuous 60 minute mix made in Peak, split up into separate tracks, sent to iTunes w/AAC compression.  The lyrics are included wherever possible.  If you've heard my other comps, you're sure to enjoy something on this one.

As always, Seed & Enjoy this or any of my other torrents.
