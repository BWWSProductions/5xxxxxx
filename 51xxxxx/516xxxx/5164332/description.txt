My two friends of the now infamous BSBTRGDClub just released their latest album, Leopard Hexagone !

It's been quite a few months that they've been teasing us, with previews -- the amazing freezeman, the gosh-its-so-melodic flute de pan ! --  of that incredible album.

Really this latest release from these two Montreal madmen is an incredible masterpiece. Moreover, these guys are so generous that they're giving it all for free. 

So really plz

GIVE SOME LOVE

BOOK THEM,

LISTEN & LISTEN

& SHARE.
