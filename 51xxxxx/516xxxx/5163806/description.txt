Riphead was a short-lived Ohio thrashing death/grind band that formed from the ashes of the band Ton.  Other bands the members were involved in over the years include Halomachine and Warface (Ohio).  They went on to form Onenemy with a new singer after their "He Who Angers" era singer left, but not before this singer laid down some vocals on a demo in 2008 on the songs that would eventually become Onenemy songs.  After this band imploded, Ton went through s short-lived reunion, doing some rough recording, but now the main members of Riphead have asked back the singer from the "He Who Angers" era and they are now called NATIONAL COLLAPSE.  Look for a demo uploaded soon.

Enjoy this piece of metal obscura.  It was uploaded by the band themselves to spread the music that was never released in a widespread fashion.
