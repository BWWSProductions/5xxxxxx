The Sugababes came into the Live Lounge and performed their new single About A Girl and covered Florence and the Machine's Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up).

It was the first time that they had performed live as the new look babes... The girls talked about filming together in L.A, appearing on Xtra Factor and how they want Olly and Jedward in the final!
