Hi there..

Well. Since I first uploaded some of Larry Norman's songs for those who haven't got the money, or a credit card, to get them from elsewhere, I've received mails with thanks and blessings. Of course totally undeserved, because the only One worthy of thanks and blessings, is the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Yeah. Amen.

But because of these mails, and because I myself have been so blessed by Larry Norman's ministry, and absolutely because I have seen with my own eyes what impact they can have on people, I have collected from various sources 45 albums (Yes, I have also bought some of the albums in shops and sampled them in good quality.. :-), plus I've added some videos, and some lyrics and cover images, and decided to make them into this torrent.

This is by no means a full discography, but it's anyway a bigger collection than any of the torrents I've seen with the label "Larry Norman Discography"..

I hope and pray you'll help keeping this music alive by seeding it further for those who want or need to hear it without paying a fortune. But if you are able, you can buy his records from (preferably)

since you then help to feed the poor, cloth the naked, and nurse the sick and much more.. Which you also can do in other ways than buying Larry's records.. You know.. Which is what Jesus really, really wants us as Christians to do.. Which reminds me of a video included here called "Larry Norman Shares His Heart" (Thanks to "TheCannyShark"), and it's well worth watching to see and hear what Larry said in the year 2000.. ..at least I feel so.. :-)

Love from Verifire.
