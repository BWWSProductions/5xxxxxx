Movie REviews :

This is, rather incredibly, Mr. Mukhopadhyay's first film, and it exhibits the passionate, more-is-more abandon of an artist 

bursting with welcome (if exhausting) enthusiasm onto the scene. - Nathan Lee, New York Times Top Critic.

Herbert narrates the kaleidoscopic saga of Herbert Sarkar (Shubhashish Mukhopadhyay), an idiot savant in Calcutta who incites the 

wrath of the International Rationalist Society with his successful business enterprise, "Dialogues with the Dead."

Rife with allusions to classic Hollywood and to directors from Satyajit Ray to Jean-Luc Godard, Mukhopadhyay's debut feature is an 

astounding, encyclopedic parable: part magical-realist fable, part allegory of cultural imperialism. Shot in flashy reds and 

twilight blues that recall the Technicolor of MGM musicals, this wittily self-reflexive film features a remarkable lead performance 

by Mukherjee as the film's visionary madman.
