,crackfiend76,2009-11-23T04:12Z,So do I have the option of not installing/burning the swedish subs..thereby having an intact movie with no subtitles?
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-11-23T14:24Z,crackfiend76: You have to select the Swedish subs for it to show so you don't have to remove it.
,recstar,2009-11-25T21:49Z,"I have no sound on my dvd, I have burned it twice with the same problem. Im using nero to burn the video_ts file, i never had a problem before so i dont know. any suggestions?"
,Barkingspyder,2009-11-25T21:51Z,"I appreciate the upload, but I do not understand why it is first in a .rar format which decompresses to a .zipfile, which then becomes a .iso file.  That's an awful lot of time and drive space wasted.
"
[T],l_c_f_c,2009-11-26T07:10Z,"recstar: Sorry but I don´t know what could be wrong but try burn it with clonecd or something like that instead and it should work. 

Barkingspyder: There's no zip file? It's rar archives and inside that an image just as all other scene releases."
