This is the first time I've tried uploading a torrent so if I make a mistake please let me know so I can fix it.

I started reading this book, then realized I did not have enough time to read it before it was due back. So I decided I would scan the book so I could read it any time I wished. 50 pages in I decided to stop scanning because I feared damaging the book so I picked up my camera and started photographing the rest. If the some of the images are blurry this is the reason why. After I finished I decided to upload the book here for everyone to download and read.

I don't expect there to be much interest in the history of Switzerland but I figured I'd upload it anyway just in case someone might be interested. If there is interest in European history here then I will post more books. The next 2 books I will be scanning are The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire by David Pryce-Jones and Sweden: The Nation's History by Franklin D. Scott.

Update: Currently 110 pages into Sweden: The Nation's History. Should have it done in about a week or so. All pages are being scanned so the image quality will be higher. :)
