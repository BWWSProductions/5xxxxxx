Lavasoft Ad-Aware Anniversary 2009 Professional Edition 8.0.0 is the latest version of Lavasoftâ€™s industry leading anti-spyware solutions. Ad-Aware 2009 allows you to combat the growing threats and latest advancements of malicious spyware and malware.

Ad-Aware 2009 protects you from spyware that secretly takes control of your computer, resulting in aggressive advertising pop-ups, sluggish computer activity and even identity theft through stolen private information. We give you the tools to detect hazardous content on your computer, clearly identify their threat level, and then give you the control to remove unwanted content, so that your private information remains right where it should - under your control.

Lavasoftâ€™s advanced Code Sequence Identification (CSI) technology roots out deeply hidden malware and then searches for similar codes in order to identity emerging variants. Ad-Aware 2009 thoroughly scans your memory, registry, Hosts file, hard, removable and optical drives for known data-mining, aggressive advertising, parasites, scumware, keyloggers, trojans, dialers, malware, browser hijackers, and tracking components.
