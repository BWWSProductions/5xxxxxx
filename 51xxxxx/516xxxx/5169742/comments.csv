Its spanish - Solo Quiero Caminar (Just Walking)"

He must be 'tarded.
The exact same torrent on btjunkie is supposedly out of sync, be warned. There is a resynced version there though."
,dearghoul,2011-01-01T08:39Z,"Horribly out of sync it is. It can probably be resynced with vlc, but I hate doing that with a passion, it's too fussy getting it right. I'd sail on over and try the resynced one on btjunkie, I'm downloading it now meself.
This video is also very weird, with a kind of nasty horizontal pixellation throughout, very ugly."
