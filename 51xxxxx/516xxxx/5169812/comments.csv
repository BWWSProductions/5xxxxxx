,Kykk,2012-03-29T01:42Z,"Thank you so much, johnefp. You and everyone else who uploads these classic movies otherwise unavailable to most of us. I don't care too much for the new releases, whether or not they will be released they'll be available one way or another. But these old classics can be so hard to find, so anyone uploading old movies by Kazan, Ford, Wilder, Lumet, Bergman and so on, Kudos. You Rock!"
,mtlpnk666,2012-07-04T07:34Z,R.I.P. Andy Griffith. Can't wait to see this film.  Thanks for the upload!

,yobar23,2012-07-08T15:37Z,"Thanks so much for this fine upload, johnefp.  This movie kicks ass, even in this day of media saturation.  I had forgotten about it until reminded by Andy's passing."

Thanks johnefp. You have introduced me to a new dimension of Andy Griffith. It seems his talent was misapplied by someone, somewhere along the line. Most people know him as Matlock or  as Opie's dad. I will continue to check out your rare films, and of course, to seed.
