,tisemann,2009-11-13T19:22Z,"Left 4 Dead 2 is actually supposed to be wave 5. So if you're on iXtreme 1.6 or 1.61 and can't get it to work, get out your good ol' activation disc."

,tisemann,2009-11-13T19:42Z,"I did some abgx360 checking. Seems to be wave 5 after all. But it's detected as wave 4 in abgx360, so this one's going to cause some confusion..."

,swoto,2009-11-14T16:52Z,If I'm already banned does it matter if I convert it to wave 3 or will my Xbox play wave 4/5? I'm running on extreme 1.5.1 please tell me
,projectsw1,2009-11-14T17:09Z,pleas seed while you download people!  I should have had this by now
,projectsw1,2009-11-14T17:10Z,"swoto > I too am banned and pan on wave 3 patching this game to play it, I think it will work"
,partio,2009-11-14T17:18Z,I heard that if you convert this as wave 3 it will work. You can do it example with 360 Wave Pathcer program. It's simple. But if you are not live banned this might be bad way to play game.
,k.1109,2009-11-14T19:21Z,if i have 1.61 will i b able to run wave 5?
,halo37253,2009-11-14T22:49Z,"well its your fault from getting banned. You cant blame MS, just because your to broke to buy the game, so you have to mod your console and steal your games using the internet. by doing so you void your terms of service and get kicked from using some futures. atleast you can still play games after you are banned. you can always get a new xbox for cheap and mod it again when its safe. "
,saada245,2009-11-15T00:21Z,I have IX1.61 on a BenQ and this game works perfectly just under abgx the verification doesnt pass all the way. If u are banned u have nothing to lose.

For those concerned about getting banned, I've been playing burnt copies of games on an xbox live account for over a year now, and i've yet to be banned. It's simple really; don't play them online. Just because joe-blow across the street says he's been playing a burnt copy of halo 3 online for several years now doesn't mean it'll work for you. If you really are concerned about getting banned for social or economic reasons, don't risk it."

,klvsa,2009-12-25T04:32Z,"krimson23 if you xbox is flashed with ixtreme 1.6 .. wave 4 discs will not work for you. 

Make yourself an activate.iso disc. pop it in your xbox and after the screen comes up take out the disc and insert a wave4 game. your console will now read the wave4 disc but you'll have to do this every time you want to play, i'm not sure how safe you are regarding xbox live. "
,Jccarvalho,2009-12-28T01:46Z,"wtf?? why so many doubts about the game waves??? just burn the activate.iso and it's done, you can play all waves even wave 100.

make sure that you download a good copy of the activate.iso software. then remember to burn everything to the first layer only. takes forever to finalize the disc. insert the disc in your xbox and play it. then the next disc you insert should play without any problems. "
