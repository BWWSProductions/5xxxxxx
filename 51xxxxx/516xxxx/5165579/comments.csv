,wooks79,2009-11-16T19:34Z,"Hey Akamaru and all in the PS3 team, hopefully you recognise my ID from on here and demonoid, as I always tried to thank and seed as much as possible.

Anyways, with Demonoid down is this the best place to get all your releases? If not please point me to the right place!

...also is there a PS3 team rip of The Crow at all?  

New PC for me in march so will be able to contribute properly then :)"

,XAlucarDX454,2009-11-17T02:42Z,awesome!! i was trying to get a copy of this awhile back but could only find Chinese audio thanks crazy amounts of much
[T],Akamaru-,2009-12-18T05:58Z,FUCK YOU CMCT! GO ELSEWHERE!
,steadygettingblown,2010-02-04T11:23Z,"I was just talking about how I'm such a hard core fan of the Chinese or mandarin language than the English versions because of the emotion and soul that gets left out of the movie because of crappy actors doing crappy dubs and I told my home girl that there was one film that I though was so well englished dubbed that it actually made the film a better work of art and looked for it and here it is up'd by my homie Akamaru! So I don't care if I am a month or 2 late for the action but FUCK YOU CMCT your a dumb fuck that needs to learn from people rather than sticking to your own retarded views on shit, so when people say it should be this way or that way you say ""yes I believe your right"" and then shut the fuck up!   
And thanks again Akamaru, your the shit homie"
[T],Akamaru-,2010-02-05T06:52Z,"Thanks for the kinds words Steady, long time no see. let me know if you need a hexagon invite it's were all the team uploads movies now. hit me up bro, either send me an email or send me a PM on the noid."
