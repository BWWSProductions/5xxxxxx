,hayjude99,2010-11-03T07:15Z,Um if there really is every album by The Beatles in mono (as The Beatles Mono Box Set) does then I'm pretty sure it would take up more then 708MB.  If it really is all the files then the compression must be so high that the quality is bad.  If not then let me know but for now no DL
