Format:        DVD5 NTSC-USA
Lang.:         English
Discs:         1
Image:         ISO
Genre.:        Action
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works. 


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.



Game Description:

Teen Titans is based on the cartoon of the same name. Players control the five team members: Robin, Cyborg, Raven, Starfire and Beast Boy and can switch between them at any time. Each character has a unique set of powers and moves. In addition to the standard combos, in co-op modem characters can perform team moves together for added damage. There are power-ups to be found through the game which speed the world slow it down, increase your attack, etc. The game is set up as a series of levels and after completing a level, each heroes' abilities are upgraded.

The Titans receive a video game in the mail, but find themselves trapped inside when they try to play it. They must battle their way through many enemies, including bosses drawn from the show, to escape.

There is also a multiplayer mode which works something like a four-player fighting game. This can be played against bots or with other humans. In addition to the Titans themselves, you can play as the bosses from single-player or more than a dozen other characters from the show that are unlocked by finding hidden items in story mode.
