,peachkeen,2009-11-17T11:19Z,Is this version compatable with Us versions of the game? I tried a different one and I keep getting error messages about regional codes not matching up. 
,ngermana,2009-11-17T23:37Z,I'm going to cry if this version doesn't work for me lol
,nXr77,2009-11-18T04:44Z,Anyone try installing this to see if it gets the same update problem as the other one?
,samoframbow,2009-11-18T06:46Z,real deal? thanks if it is. i heard people are having trouble dling because of the region compatibility. i've found a few good tips and i'll share which one will work for me
,jerebratt,2009-11-18T06:47Z,None of the ones uploaded seem to work...unless you know how to tinker around with regedit.
,D_O_M_O_N_A_T_O_R,2009-11-18T10:08Z,Does with work with mac aswell?
,jojojo812,2009-11-18T11:17Z,"This game doesnt work good at all. I installed it and its says that i need to update my sims 3. If you downloaded the sims 3 from pirate bay you need to replace the TSLHost.dll in the sims 3/game/bin with the TSLHost.dll from the mounted image. When you installed all of this and you put the crack in the Sims 3 WA, you start the game and i think everyone wants to start a new family, so you make a family but you cant choose there life wish. You just can't, you even can't chose there quality, if you want to choose there is nothing.

So i recoment to wait with downloading, only if you know how to solve this problem.
And if you know how to solve this please tell, because i want to play it without anything strange in the game.

PS: sorry for my bad english"
,Icebird(NL),2009-11-18T12:30Z,"For US Sims 3 players, try this:

Go to Start
click Run and type in ""regedit""
open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARESimsThe Sims 3
double click SKU
Now change the value to a number between 1 and 7. Mines worked in 2

These numbers represent the region codes. Essentially you can change the region code for your Sims 3 game like this. I don't know which number applies to this WA EP so try each number one at a time until the install of WA works.
"
,jojojo812,2009-11-18T12:56Z,"Yeah thats how you another way to install it, but mine works to.

But i still have the problem with choosing the quality?s of my sim, and i found another problem. You can?t see the skills, not even when you trained them."
,baalika,2009-11-19T01:24Z,"Id like to confirm that this works. I messed around with the cracks and update versions too and i managed to get it installed but the game went fubar and crashed when loading the city.

Reinstalling the sims 3 (restarting etc.) and not touching any updates or cracks and then installing this solved the problem. Im using afaik all the available dlc perfectly as well.

Thy for the upload."
