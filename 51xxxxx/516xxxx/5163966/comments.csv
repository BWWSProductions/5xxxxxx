,snugglz,2010-03-04T06:56Z,"Thank you for this very awesome download. Do you possibly have the few torrents that are missing from your description? I would love it if you could post ""Golden Pillz - The Luna Remixes"", ""Some Have To Dance, Some Have To Kill"" & The 2004 Re-Issue Of ""I See Good Spirits And I See Bad Spirits"". I have purchased every one of their albums over many years, but was never able to locate these. Thank you in advance."
