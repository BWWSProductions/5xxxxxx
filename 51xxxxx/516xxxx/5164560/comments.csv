,indiaman,2010-03-27T09:53Z,"You have mentioned that David Suchet as Poirot is a favourite among The English,Australians and Americans.I beg to differ.He is the best even in India as is Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes,Stephen Fry & Hugh Laurie as Jeeves and Wooster,Colin Firth as Darcy in Pride and Prejudice.And we are forever indebted to England for giving us these immortal characters."
