,Sugarsweet,2009-11-15T02:51Z,page 39 of the pdf it says clanrats can take spears/shields for 1[]2 pt/model.. is that a half point per model then? 0o
,Elrond89,2009-11-15T08:59Z,"yes, it is 0.5 points per model"
,Tananjoh,2009-11-22T13:17Z,Kinda bad to say it is complete when it isn't. I wanted the whole one :(. But we all make our misstakes.
