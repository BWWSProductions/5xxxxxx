By the way it took me 15h to unpack the folders on a amd athlon 64 X2 dual core processor! not 1h 30min as it said %D.

Please help with the missing zone problem!"
,venom_er,2009-11-27T18:55Z,"Ok finally i got it.
May be it was due to my anti-virus.
Anti-virus (Eset) deleted all Zone files i switched to other anti-virus and viola the problem is solved.
Also make sure to have some excess space in the drive you are installing the game files.

BTW great game works like a charm.
@gansuk thanks a lot :)"

can anyone send me the ui.ff file?

,tusantshaq,2009-12-07T18:19Z,"Works fine on NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX, Intel Core 2 Duo 6700 @ 2.6GHz, 4GB of RAM. 

Took some time to decompress (over an hour), but was worth it. It would take several hours to download some of the bigger releases.

Played ~6 single-player missions so far. No problems encountered at all.

I am using NVIDIA driver version 6.14.11.8250 (as seen via Control Panel > Display Properties > Settings > Advanced > Adapter > Properties > Driver)."
,NotSober,2009-12-08T20:09Z,"theres nothing wrong with the campaign, iv completed it and know others who have aswell. the issue is with specops, found out how to fix it, go to main/image take file hud_aa12.iwi and make a copy of it, then rename to hud_g36c_mp.iwi. this should get past the crash."

,NotSober,2010-01-02T02:48Z,"@torrentpirateer after seeing ya game folder, theres .tmp files still remaining when there shouldnt be, this means the pre-compressor failed for some reason. common causes for this are not enough ram or not enough free disc space."

2. A black screen with white loading bar comes and its stuck there for hours and an error message pops on the desktop which has nothing on it or says the same error as the first

my spec is :
Core 2 Duo
9800 GT 512MB
Windows 7 OS
4 GB Ram

first restart the computer, then as the game itself is 10 gb once it is extracted keep about 30 gb of free space in the disk drive where the setup is taking place(I myself had kept 30gb free) and while the setup is taking place do not keep any program working these are the precautions i took and i rectified the faults occurring I finished the game and it worked well"
