,surfstu,2009-11-17T20:14Z,anyone else care to comment on how this might work?
[V],Colombo-bt,2009-11-18T01:38Z,"I had no such problems. If you use Vista or Seven, try clicking the right button on the startup file and in Properties -> Compatibility, choose Windows XP SP3 or you can uninstall everything and redo the steps on the setup file. The only thing that comes to mind."
,Dughwheat,2009-11-21T23:03Z,"I'm getting the same problem as surfstu
even still after redownloading and installing everything and trying the compatibility trick. 

P.S. I'm on vista"
,hasbeenhonshu,2009-12-10T10:44Z,"I have experienced the same problem as surfstu and I am also running Vista Home Premium. The following message is returned when I try to run Dreamweaver.exe either in XP Compatibility mode or not: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Dreamweaver CS4\en_GB\Resources.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains and error.

Note: The instruction in the English Readme.txt file to select the ""paid"" version is non sequitur as you cannot proceed without entering a product key if you do that so you must select the trial version which the Spanish version of Readme.txt got correct.

Sure would be nice if this worked."
