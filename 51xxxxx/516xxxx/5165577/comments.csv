Well to answer that question. I like to have the artwork present on my iPod or my MAC screen. I'm sure that lots of other people do too. What most uploaders do is to present artwork with out a ""watermark"" or as I like to call it ""scent markings"". I think they are only put on so the uploader can see their name in lights.

I could find and download the correct, unadulterated artwork and replace yours, but it takes time and a modicum of effort.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your uploads except for the dumb logo plastered over every single piece of artwork !!!"

Thanks

[T],mrsjs,2010-03-02T17:17Z,"Yeah , in the current Art 50% opacity means nothing thats why i put 100% or without opacity .. 

thanks

,ugottahaveheart,2010-12-13T06:34Z,Thank you. I will certainly support the artist. She should be the biggest thing out there. Compared to Amy Winehouse (who Paloma sounds like) Paloma is 10 times better. She puts winehouse to shame.
[T],mrsjs,2010-12-16T20:59Z,"welcome :) .. yes her voice is good though only listened 1 song of her :)
