In this landmark work of narrative history, Margaret MacMillan gives a dramatic and intimate view of those fateful six months in 1919, after the end of â€œthe war to end all wars,â€ when the Big Three (President Woodrow Wilson, British prime minister David Lloyd George, and French premier Georges Clemenceau) met in Paris to shape a lasting peace. Those days saw new political entities (Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Palestine, among them) born out of the ruins of bankrupt empires, and the borders of the modern world redrawn. Much of the world then sketched out was embittered through grievous faults whose troubles haunt us still.
