This zip contains all files necessary to get Android 2.0 (aka Eclair) running on your Dream (T-Mobile G1, etc) or Magic 32B (T-Mobile MyTouch3G, etc) devices.  All packages ARE ALREADY SIGNED, so no need to worry about that.  Basic instructions are provided, but if you can't figure it out DON'T ASK HERE.  If you don't know who to ask already, then you shouldn't be trying to install this!!!

Some of these files (the large ones) are available at http://code.google.com/p/android-newreco/downloads/list so feel free to exclude them from your torrent download and get them there instead.

Enjoy!
