2006. Through the last three years they grew and transformed from being just another name in
CopenhagenΓÇÖs underground into the band they are today. Scarred by Beauty plays Headlining

Europe lined up. They have played along side with multiple established names such as:

The individual members of Scarred by Beauty are all active and dedicated musicians. Singer
Jonathan Albrechtsen is also the singer of the Danish trash sensation Hatesphere, who picked

charisma that shines way beyond the stage to every member of whatever audience he
performs for.
Guitar player Daniel Leszkowicz, only 18 years of age, is also a member of the Danish tech
metal band Vira, who took DK by surprise with their latest two EPΓÇÖs. Vira is an active metal

All in all Scarred by Beauty is the culmination of four talented minds, that finds inspiration in
each other and with the release of their latest EP ΓÇ¥We SwimΓÇ¥ there is no doubt ΓÇô Scarred by
Beauty is ready for more.
