,Maerleon,2009-11-14T09:41Z,Ty very much!
[T],verifire,2009-11-14T14:31Z,"@alderbaran: Jesus said to the scribes and pharisees: ""If you'd believed Moses, you'd have believed in Me, for it is about Me he has written.."" Gospel of John.. As for dutch subs: search and you will find. Maybe at amazon, maybe as torrent.. :-)

@Maerlon: I'm sure you're welcome.. *:-)"
,jessup,2009-11-14T15:58Z,"Thanks very much! Do you have the hole collection? would be great to see the collection up, thanks in advance."
[T],verifire,2009-11-16T18:34Z,"The whole collection.. Well, I do, more or less.. But some of it is crap. IMHO.. So I tend to check the stuff I upload for inaccuracies and flaws.. Take the ""Jesus"" movie in this series for instance. It portrays a ""Jesus"" where there have been taken so many ""artistic liberties"", that He (oh Lord, forgive them) winds up as a dude that's lusting for women, confiding in men His mission on earth like He's struggling with keeping the goal of the mission and so on.. That is a movie that really makes me ill, physically. No joke.

Glad they've made ""The Gospel of John"" now to take it's place..

That's actually a movie REALLY worth watching. Not implying that you haven't.. :-)

Along with ""Abraham"" and a couple more, they are the only really good movies in the ""Biblical Series""..

Would you really like me to upload crap? :-)
And sorry if I offend someone, but that's my opinion on much of the so called ""Christian"" movies. Good for nothing but downhill racing..

I try to upload sound, really Biblical movies if I'm to upload at all. If there's no value for your everyday life in them, I don't upload them..

R U OK with that? :-)"

[T],verifire,2009-12-28T21:28Z,"Yo' welcome... :-)
