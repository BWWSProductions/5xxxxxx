The wonderful movie Victor Victoria has un unforgettable scene in it -
one of the most memorable in movie making history for its human impact.
It's the "restaurant scene" featuring Miss Julie Andrews and Mr. Robert Preston.
Hard out on their luck, they have to act completely desperate for a meal -
"at the Ritz" for that matter! taking the risk of their vey lives!
Then again there are two (or one more at least, certainly, great songs of all
time). Then again, the music in the opening credits is "to die for". We thought
we'd bring just these elements to you, in a maximum bitrate conversion using
DivX author (altough it came up with only a 640 X 480 - lovely enough and easy
for many ipods to use too perhaps)and we gave it a whopping 192k audio bitrate.
Except of course we have a French audio channel alternative too in just one
clip - the Restaurant scene" and it was only monural at the source Im afraid so
it came in at 128K given the music content in the background.

Along with the complete restaurant scene, the two most unforgettable (included
here) songs (scenes) I refer to are:
"gay Paree"
"You and me"

Also the theme music is included showing the opening credits clip.

With these clips, you are better able to select to view only what you would
enjoy for the moment, much like the DVD and with similar video and audio
quality, I might venture to add.

So who needs to download the DVD instead, huh?
