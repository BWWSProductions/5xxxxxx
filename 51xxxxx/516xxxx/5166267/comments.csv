,Ezio1486,2009-11-17T14:47Z,OMG there are so many files there
,husksolow,2009-11-17T17:42Z,How do you unrar these?! Do I have to change the name of every file to rar?
,Sparkypk,2009-11-17T23:06Z,Just unRAR the first one. Each of them are parts to each other if that makes any sense. RAR's can only have a certain amount of space per RAR so they have to break it into parts.
,Ezio1486,2009-11-18T13:39Z,So It's simple right?
,Ezio1486,2009-11-18T13:42Z,Why itsn't just an ISO? and a crack
,Dropastone,2009-11-19T15:45Z,Just open winrar navigate to the file and extract.
,Flummig_Badboll,2009-11-19T22:39Z,Thank's Man!!!!!!
,stervendehoerenkachel,2009-11-21T17:27Z,"Took some time but it finally arrived, lots of leechers.
Next time post the ISO file, not everybody has the space to store the ISO as well as the RAR files so they just throw away the rar files when finished, this costs seeders.
Works great and looks really nice, thanks. :)"
,SteXDudE,2009-11-23T16:42Z,"Im downloading now,and seed this torrent just a lil a bit to finish"
,moogles,2009-11-24T19:35Z,"i dont understand, after i extracted the files to an ISO, there doesent appear to be an crack for the the game. also it keeps askining for the second disk."
,3dgreek,2009-11-25T17:10Z,strange torrent...either VERY slow or reasonable speed. Spikes of upto 200 down for half hour that then drops to 3 or less for an hour and then back up. Quite strange
,skrufen89,2009-11-30T17:06Z,What program do I need to unrar these?
,BananazCortez,2009-12-01T10:18Z,"This works great thanks!-unrar first rar file & it automatically creates an iso file (you have to use a drive formatted to NTFS for files above 4.4gb) .Mount iso image with magic iso or similar virtual drive software--install game, OPEN iso & copy exe from razor1911 file into where ever you installed game (C:programfiles/...) & you should be smashing bricks no probs! Thanks for the up."
,xiIix,2009-12-05T06:25Z,"Jesus christ guys, you're acting like you've never seen a release compressed into a bunch of rars. All you need to do is right-click ANY 1 of those files and then click ""extract here"" - Uh-ohhhh, you're jumping through hoops and crackin' safes now, better not download this horrible, terrible release."
,MrBuckee,2009-12-06T12:14Z,Whhaaat!! WinRar has extract these now 4 hours!! Do I do something wrong??
,peterschm,2009-12-09T15:06Z,"I'ts already going on for 11 hours.
Is there something wrong?"
,peterschm,2009-12-09T15:07Z,I mean downloading the .torrrent file...
,MrBuckee,2009-12-10T14:44Z,"Why it keep asking that do I want to remove game when I am installing it??

I have mounted ISO and tried then install, but no it always ask same.. ""Do you realy want to remove this program"""
,Robin9876,2009-12-17T10:22Z,"Have you burn ISO to dual-layer disk or something? Because ISO is 4,8G and it dont fit to normal dvd-r disc....."
,fuzzilla,2009-12-17T20:28Z,"I was a bit confused about the .rars but pretty easy install afterall. works fine, thanks"
,Panos75,2009-12-19T13:36Z,Thank....
,xiIix,2009-12-24T08:58Z,"""markkay at 2009-12-11 13:41 CET:
you all a bunch of idiots. problem tho when i try start up the game. fails. stay black screen then stays error white screen then dektop. btw iam runnin win7 64bit.""

Are you fuckin' serious guy? Who's the idiot now? 64bit Windows is about as compatible as my fucking cock with a majority of popular software. This game only runs on 32bit Windows, just like 80% of all the games out there. Nice choice of OS asshole. Maybe next time you'll actually read the system requirements before coming on here and calling a bunch of people morons when you're actually one yourself. 


MrBuckee: there are literally over 10 different reasons it could be taking very long for it to extract. If you want help, you need to give us more information.

peterschm: What did you expect? 5 minutes? An hour? Some of these torrents might take days, it all depends on the torrent, where it's originating from, your ISP, DNS servers among the swarm, how many heavy seeders there are, how many people are leeching ect. ect.. When all those things are good, torrents fly and you download fast, when some of them are shit, it's slow as fuck. For instance, the 80GB High Definition version of Planet Earth here on The Pirate Bay. I downloaded that bad boy in less than 2 days. That torrent is being held up by a couple seriously heavy seeders, and I hit download speeds of over 2MB/s. Unfortunately, most torrents these days hover around 60-200kB/s, which means that 4GB torrents can take a couple days."
,venom1200,2009-12-25T10:42Z,"well, i downloaded this torrent without a problem and it took me about 6 hours.

i unrared it, mounted the .iso, and installed the game. now i'm stuck with the crack..? where is it? i want to play the game and it tells me i have the wrong disk inserted. how about some help here? thanks"
,Tunt3maton,2010-01-04T20:17Z,xiIix: Seems like you don't know anything about 64bit OS.
,ptv83,2010-01-20T08:27Z,"works fine on win 7 64 bit.... xiIix, hey dumbass.. you got it backwards, 32bit programs work 100% on 64bit xp, vista and win7.  
.. but 64bit programs don't work on 32bit OS.... lol.. the only thing you need specific 64bit for is DRIVERS... lol

.. let me guess, you're one of those idiots who hit's his monitor when his computer locks up, and calls his case the ""hardrive"" or ""cpu"" .. LMAO .. you don't know shit dude... this is why is quit the computer service business.. i got tired of idiots like you."
,Tarmo31,2010-02-02T06:33Z,"But this is not the rar file and it will not open the rar

,tbdt07,2010-02-10T21:47Z,"can anyone help me?
i have downloaded,unrar it and mount it whit deamontools. when the cd run i can only inport images, show images, copy disc and open folder. not istall it that way so i open the foler and try the laucher and setup file in there, but i cant get it starting to install."
,adaptnz,2010-02-13T03:01Z,"dont be put off by all the noobs on here, installs fine if you know what youre doing 

for all the noobs:

1) OPEN winrar

2) in winrar, open the lego indiana jones 2 folder, you will see a list of files.

3) double click first file on the list, this will create an ISO file (game cd)

4) use powerISO or similar program to mount the ISO (if you dont know this much you shouldnt be here in the first place)

5) open my computer, right click on cd drive labeled LEGOINDY2, click explore

6) open folder labeled Razor1991, copy the file inside to your desktop (this file is for playing without the disk, which you dont have)

7) go back into main folder and run setup, install the game

8) open the folder where you installed the game eg c/program files/lucasarts/legoindianajones2


9) delete LEGOindy2 file from this folder and replace it with the one you put on your desktop

10) create a shortcut to this file and place on desktop

run the game

leave a comment here saying ""thank you mr adaptNZ, it works!!!1""

:)

thanks to the uploader

@ tbdt07 - try using powerISO instead of daemon tools (its free, google it)
"
,tbdt07,2010-02-13T18:55Z,"after i mounted it whit power iso or deamontools and i try to run the setup, it just pop up a black window for half a sek and i gone a gain. nothing more happens"
