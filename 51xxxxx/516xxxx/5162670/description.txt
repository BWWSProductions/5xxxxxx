Shotei Ha'nevua, or "The Fools of Prophecy", was an Israeli musical group selected as Israel's "Band of the Year" in 2005.[The band described its music as a fusion of dub reggae with hip-hop and dance music, with an eastern Mediterranean flavor. 

Shotei Hanevua broke up on August 12, 2007. Singer Avraham Tal started a solo career. Meanwhile, the majority of the band continued to play together under the new name "Pshutei Ha'am".

"every time I listen to one of their songs on the radio, I get that foolish smile upon my face - the smile you get when you are IN LOVE... they sound so good that it's almost impossible not to enjoy" (The Stage)
