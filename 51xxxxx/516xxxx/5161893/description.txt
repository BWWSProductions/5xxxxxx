The new O&O DiskStat, working together with O&O Enterprise Management Console 2, is a great help for analyzing the usage of hard disk space on servers and workstations across a network. With just a few clicks, youâ€™ll be able to detect the hard disks that are heavily occupied, and the data being saved on them. In no time at all, youâ€™ll easily see where valuable disk space is being wasted by the storage of useless data, or recognize just the opposite: too much storage capacity containing far too little data. Factors like these are responsible for unnecessarily driving up your IT costs but now, thanks to O&O DiskStat 2 Server Edition, itâ€™s easy to avoid and reduce their negative effect
