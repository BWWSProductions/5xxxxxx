According to release info...
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
This time round it's a really nice TS of 2012.......many thanks to ELEKTRI4KA (Not camelot as it wasn't theirs anyway) Awesome video bro,probably one of THE best videos in a looooong time. The audio is our own and is pretty decent .......better than whats out now anyway. Still did some work to the video as it was a touch dark in places and also over bright in others so we tried to get the balance right ;-) And not like these scene wannabes you can use our encode or audio............enjoy :)
