,siegfried0,2010-08-25T08:24Z,"This movie sucks.  It's just more hollywood hate propaganda about holocaust conspiracy theories and torturing and killing goyim.

,lostspoil,2011-04-28T20:30Z,"@FRivera.. you have obviously no clue what so ever... it is spelled Inglourious Basterds and not inglorious basterds.. well I mean.. at least the original title is spelled inglourious (for what ever reason.. ).. so yay in a way the uploader spelled it ""wrongly"" .. have a nice day!


thx for the upload!"
,dirtymoe,2011-06-12T21:54Z,@lostspoil .... wtf are you talking about  FRivera was correct.  runner3000 is a moron.

,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-07-31T22:17Z,Thanks fer the upload. Download time was about 20 minutes. No problems here. I'll come back later to do a little minireview on the download/movie.
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-08-01T03:53Z,"I'm back. Here you go:

Using VLC Media Player in fullscreen mode, no syncing problems. E'erthin played perfectly.

Audio: 8.5 
Video 7.5 (fer its size and length, it was pretty goddang good!)

Movie: I enjoyed it. Funny, entertaining, time-occupier. I'm glad I got to download this. Really great rip. The resta yall will basically have to evaluate fer yerselves.

In case yall haven't figured it out, the movie is spoken-English and has subtitles ONLY in certain parts of the movie when a foreign language is spoken, ya know, like when it came out in theaters. No duh.

Thans to the uploader and to everyone who seeded. Have a good one."

,navpers_05,2011-10-14T10:08Z,"Inglorious Bastards was a movie made a couple decades ago. Inglorious BasTERDS is a remake by Quentin Tarantino...all this can be verified by simply looking above at the fuckin cover art ....jesus, people these days should educate themselves a little."
,uberjewber,2011-10-26T15:51Z,"Just so you guys know, Universal is watching this torrent. Just got busted on college campus even while using encryption because Universal contacted my campus. Be wary. Pirates Ho!"
,blucexxree,2011-12-22T02:26Z,"@uberjewber From what I hear, they need to be part of the swarm to monitor that sort of thing. I don't care....as long as they seed.
 As for the guy spamming holocaust-denying nonsense...Oh, nevermind. There are ""no planes"" theorists out there. What's one more fruitcake?"
