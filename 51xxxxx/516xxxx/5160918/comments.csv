If you don't mind, I would like to reupload this torrent in a proper way.
I don't give a crap about lawyers and music production libraries, I just liked soundtrack in this game game back then. And with this weird format this torrent will likely be forgotten and dropped as soon as you spot seedeing"

It's your decision. What should i do if i mind? Beat you? :) If you think that it'll come more popular with reuploading it without storing in this ugly archive format, you should do it. You may even upload files directly on web somewhere. Thanks."
