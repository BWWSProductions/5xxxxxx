,ciscoman,2009-11-14T04:07Z,why can't i connect to trackers???
,TOMG1,2009-11-14T04:18Z,I'M HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.....
,k9dog,2009-11-14T04:28Z,Why you guys can't connect isn't easy to answer without knowing how you are trying to connect. The trackers are using various ports than web browsers and these ports must be open to the outside world. Make sure your firewall isn't blocking your the needed ports. Consider if you ISP (Internet Service Provider) is blocking ports. Try with various trackers.

,ciscoman,2009-11-14T04:37Z,"nothing to do with my isp or any other thing...havent had this problem at all before...might be something to do with eztv site as this file still aint even on there, yet is here...anyways i'll keep trying"
,ciscoman,2009-11-14T04:39Z,"also...these 2 trackers say ""eztv.tracker.piratebay etc. so thats why i gather...will try and add other trackers"
,ciscoman,2009-11-14T04:42Z,"got it now...was the 2 trackers not working...try add these and all good
