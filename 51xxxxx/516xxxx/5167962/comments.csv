,XenoSilvano,2009-11-27T07:07Z,What a disappointment it's not 320kbps
,donaldinoduck,2009-11-28T05:13Z,"With all due respect to Bubanee .... below info for those looking for a 320 Kbps rip !!!

NoFS ( or nos1977 ) has uploaded the 320 kbps rip here at TPB.
Small info for those who are yet to discover his uploads; NoFS is a VIP uploader here at TPB and all the albums are extremely well seeded ( and are ripped at 320 kbps - specialization :Hip Hop AND R&B !)

Rated R

,07713,2009-11-29T23:43Z,"can i just ask something as a newcomer, what is the the difference between 320 kbps and something else?"
[V],bubanee,2009-11-30T07:54Z,"well 320 is the highest MP3 CBR setting o.k
192 is classed as a little above average.... 

now the other known MP3 is VBR...
it's not classed as numbers it's classed as VBR V0 which is the highest setting for this format there is one higher but not needed...

V3 is considered average for this formatt so V2 V1 which no one really uses and V0 for VBR

192, 224, 256 and 320 for CBR... i recondmend 256 and 320 for CBR

V2 V1 if you come across it and V0....

make sure there from CDRips of verified/Trusted Uploaders.. you'll be right"

,ankurgow3,2010-09-28T13:37Z,Great Job
,XenoSilvano,2010-11-10T18:00Z,"@Slybacon19 - I was being informative, Bubanee never mentioned about it being lower 320kbps so I'm informing people.  We're not in the 90s anymore internet speed and broadband have evolved."
,XenoSilvano,2010-11-10T18:09Z,"I meant memory before.

Have you guys listen to what 190kbps or 320kbps sounds compared to flac or CD. Ok some people may say that the difference is minuet but it isn't, lossless music has more body to it (especially on a professional sound system).

I've never uploaded anything onto a torrent before but one of these days I'm gonna start uploading my own stuff, there are things that I life but that I can not find on pirate bay and I'm sure there are others who also like it like me."
