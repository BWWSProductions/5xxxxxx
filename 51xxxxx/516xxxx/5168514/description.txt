FRONTLINE: A Death in Tehran
Aired: November 17, 2009

FRONTLINE investigates the life and death of the woman whose image remains a potent symbol for those who want to keep the reform movement alive in Iran. At the height of the protests following Iran's controversial presidential election this summer, a young woman named Neda Agha Soltan was shot and killed on the streets of Tehran.

Her death  filmed on a camera phone, then uploaded to the Web quickly became an international outrage, and Soltan became the face of a powerful movement that threatened the hard-line government's hold on power. In A Death in Tehran, FRONTLINE revisits the events of last summer, shedding new light on Neda's life and death and the movement she helped inspire.
