"Who'd Have Known" is a song by British recording artist Lily Allen from her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You. Written by Allen and Greg Kurstin, while interpolating Take That's single "Shine", the song will be released as the fourth single from the album in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2009.[1] Contemporary critics complimented the song and Allen's warm vocals, while the music video portrays her as a groupie of Elton John.

The music video for "Who'd Have Known" captures Allen as an obsessed fan of Sir Elton John. It starts off with her character lying in bed, watching Elton John's concert on television, while DVDs and magazines portraying him are scattered through her room, with a big poster on a wall.[8] John, portrayed by an actor, receives a letter from the singer declaring her love, accompanied by a picture of the two of them, but ignores it. Upon exiting his home, he gets in a car to discover that Allen is in fact the driver. She kidnaps him and takes him to her home, where she ties him to a chair.[8] There, she plays the piano, drinks wine, skims magazines, hugs him, makes him eat and draws a portrait of him. Afterwards, she puts a telephone to his ear and makes him say "I want you to know that I have fallen deeply in love with Lily" to an unknown receiver.[8] Afterwards, they both sit on the sofa, watching John perform at the piano on TV. As Allen falls asleep, he manages to wriggle free from the tied ropes on his feet. The video ends with John taking a final glance at Allen asleep before escaping from the building.
