Release Notes:

Arctic Monkeys today released Ã´CornerstoneÃ¶ and a collection of B-sides
from the Josh Homme co-produced Humbug sessions. The Cornerstone EPÃ†s
title track is a modern power ballad, featuring a strong vocal
performance from Alex Turner, who is on a quest to find a new lover
that will let him call her by his exÃ†s name. ItÃ†s a pick-up strategy
that has disaster written all over it, but you canÃ†t tell from TurnerÃ†s
expression in the video. Ã´CatapultÃ¶ is a nifty track that wouldnÃ†t be
out of place on a Last Shadow Puppets album, and Ã´SketcheadÃ¶ is a
pretty good vocal imitation of The FallÃ†s Mark E. Smith circa 1985.
Ã´Fright Lined Dining RoomÃ¶ highlights a heavy beat and an interesting
approximation to a heavy metal guitar riff, making it difficult to
choose a favorite.

'Cornerstone' is available on 7", 10" and digital download.
