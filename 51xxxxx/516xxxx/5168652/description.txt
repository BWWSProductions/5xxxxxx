Note: This has sluggish playback performance in iTunes or Quicktime.  Use VLC to playback on a PC.  Corrected in future HD releases.

Another HD test using appletv profile.

Maybe I'll find a real AppleTV tester with a feature length film.

Please leave feedback if this plays for you and on what platform.  Like it, dislike it, etc.

Plays fine on popcorn hour and VLC.  I suspect plays fine on ps3 and xbox 360.  For 1.5gb seems pretty swell to me.

--------------------------------------------------

Comparison (secret_myth vs HolyRoses):


SM release = 2.22 GiB, this release 1.5 GiB.  Part of SM size though is attributed to 2 audio tracks.

SM has the video encoded at 2198kb
HR release is is at 1664kb.

SM release appears to be post processed and brightened.

SM release is more detailed which is to be expected with 534kb more of video bitrate.  Some of this detail may be coming from the brightening as well.

SM release is using cabac and trellis which would lead to better encode.  (these options cannot be used on AppleTV)

SM release has more grain in the picture, look at the background noise (the extra noise could be from the post processing via brightening).

HR release plays on old computers! 2.4Ghz pentium 4 with 512mb plays this.


These two pictures are believed to be the same frame.
