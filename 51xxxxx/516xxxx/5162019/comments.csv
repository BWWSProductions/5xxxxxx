,Shorazomee,2009-11-17T14:50Z,"Hmm indeed the  instructions aren't the best ever (or at all detailed really) but lets see if i can  clear that up. 

Ok lets go.

First i recommend either creating a new folder on desktop (easy to access) or under C/user/---- or something, name it PSP just to be neat.

when you unrar the files you get a alphabetically organized set of folders. As a little hint, this order is the order you install them in.

Now in each folder you have a second and third etc.- like so C:\....\PSP\GEN----\PSP\GAME\update

now, considering the fact you most likely have CTW 5.00-m33-3-6, you might know where to put these files, if not, dont worry. Just copy the first (A4) folder contents (meaning the whole PSP folder inside it) to the root of your psp.

Heres my root: Q:\
Now you will have Q:\PSP\GAME\UPDATE\####

now start you PSP and go to games, mem, and then start it

I'll fninsh this later i have to go to school lol"
,Shorazomee,2009-11-18T00:02Z,"Now i have yet to fully test this, but in theory when you unhook your psp from the USB, go to games, memory, and under that should be PSPTM Update ver x.xx(AKA 5.50 GEM-a) click x. Then press x again. It will take you through the update process. 

Now do the same thing for 5.50 Genb1 (deleting the gen A. For b2, i'm kinda going by the directions in the torrent. now its not too clearn, so i did this for b2 and d1. But basically just wipe out your psp and backup everything on your mem stick. Once that is done you can go through, putting the files in as done before for b2 d1 and d2. be sure to do what the readme says on the gen b2/d1 part. swipe it out clean both times, jjust to be safe.
