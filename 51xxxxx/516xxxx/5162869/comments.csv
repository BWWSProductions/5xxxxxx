Also, this is the EDU version. Anyone have the whole retail version?"
,ArtskydJ,2009-11-20T23:16Z,"This is the whole DVD (~700 MB). There was a Mac CD, but I did not get it. The education version is fine. ONLY the education version has Data Logging. I do not have the retail version. I do not think that the education version are very different except that (as I said before) the education version has data logging."

The cost of the upgrades has been doubling, so for the 2.1 update I'm sure will come soon, it will cost $160 per person, and again will not have ANY cheaper upgrade path for existing users.  FUCK LEGO CORPORATION! Profiteering whores!"

This is the educational Version and  - sadly -
it doesn't include the new retail models. "
,ArtskydJ,2009-12-11T00:00Z,On mindstorms.lego.com you can get the instructions for free.

The disk is software needed to input complex programs into the NXT brain, which is needed for many projects such as those involving multiple sensors fo the same type or those needing distance or sensitivity values other thanmthe default values inside the NXT's internal programming system. You can also control how much a specific motor turns for a specific input, which is useful for some more advanced projects."
