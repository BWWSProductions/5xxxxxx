,BubbyCSG,2009-11-15T06:16Z,Downloaded this last night... installed and tested this morning... It Actually works
,TunaCRO,2009-11-15T08:50Z,how can i make faster downloading?
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-15T09:39Z,I'm trying to get as much speed out there as possible.

,WadCutter,2009-11-15T19:19Z,"Quick download for being so new (and popular). 
However, my Avira AntiVir Personal did detect ""Setup.exe"" as having ""TR/Dropper.Gen Trojan"".
I am did another scan using Spybot S&D, which called it ""Win.32.Agent.wsg"".  Since I wouldn't open the Setup.exe, and the ISO has no startup, I could go no further with the install. Thanks anyway."
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-15T19:55Z,@wadcutter WTF? As sad as it is... I havent even put out a full copy yet... so I dont know what the hell you're on about
,epigram,2009-11-17T06:15Z,"Hey, I downloaded it and all and now that ive gone to install it a message comes up saying the parameter for a .bik file isnt right. What does this mean and is there anything i can do to fix it?
Cheers."
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-17T08:50Z,Epigram..... No you haven't.... still not a complete copy sent from me yet... try again in a few days
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-17T08:51Z,Its laughable the amount of crap that gets said on these things... I used to take comments seriously on Torrents I was thinking about downloading... right up until I started UPloading this one.... ahh too funny
,WadCutter,2009-11-17T20:27Z,"Hmmm. My apolopies, BuddyCSG. 
After further investigation, looks like I mistook your torrent for a similar one. Like yours, the one that I completed (100%) contained 2 files. 
However, I see that your torrent contains 2 ISO's, where the one I completed contained a single ISO and a Setup.exe file. As it turned out, the ISO was corrupted in the completed download, so it was a wasted effort on my part.
Again, my apologies.
I still only see one (1) seeder on your torrent. Thanks for hanging in there. 
Nice effort on your part."

,BubbyCSG,2009-11-18T08:20Z,Hey Wadcutter.... no problems... 
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-18T08:21Z,now if only I could figure out how to get more upload speed out of my connection.... everyone would be sweet :)
,SharkyMouth,2009-11-18T10:30Z,"hey guys, this isn't working for me, I downloaded and installed fine but when i try to start the game up it breifly shows the modern warfare 2 start up banner then says that steam needs to be running for me to play it, even though steam is running. I'm sure this has something to do with me not understanding the instructions ""4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on DVD2 to your
installation directory and overwrite "" I don't know what this means, i tried opening the skidrow file on dvd2 but all it is is a banner advertising skidrow. Please help! I would be very thankful."
,SharkyMouth,2009-11-18T11:28Z,i have found the files in dvd 2 but i don't know where to put them... do i do this after i have fully installed the game or during the installation? if after the installation where is the installation directory. Sorry for being such a clueless retard... i just need this properly explained. I'm seeding this 10 hours a day 
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-18T12:24Z,Ok the files from dvd 2 need to be copied to something like c:/program files/Activision/Modern Warefare2. Copy and replace the two files (iw4mp and iw4sp) then just run the game from the desktop icon...
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-18T12:25Z,and thats all done AFTER you install the game :)
,Dutchkip,2009-11-18T23:03Z,ME LOVE YOU LONGTIME BABY

,BubbyCSG,2009-11-20T11:10Z,try copy and replace the files. it hasnt said anything about steam to me and I've already completed it on all levels from recruit through to Veteran
,BubbyCSG,2009-11-20T11:10Z,Although it wont allow you to run the multiplayer part of the game only single player

,dkim6613,2009-11-21T04:13Z,i clicked on start single player but it says it needs steam running to play this game. this torrent is fake.
,alphageko,2009-11-21T06:18Z,"yo dkim6613 you'r more retard than me, i just did it and it works fine. just install cod, take iw4sp from SKIDROW folder, cut it, go in c:/program files/Activision/Modern Warefare2(or smthing like that and paste/replace, it works fine."

,Bigbucks9912,2010-01-01T18:08Z,"I've started to download the torrent and the download speed is a whopping half megabyte per second! Thank you Bubby for that!

I will post back to tell you guys if this is actually MW2 and not a disguised Modern Warfare 1.
Also we'll see if it works. So far, so good. Thanks, BubbyCSG!"
,Bigbucks9912,2010-01-02T16:04Z,"Yes!!! It works! Thanks, Bubby! Just mount both ISO's with something like PowerISO or WinISO on different virtual drives and when setup asks for disk 2, point to the second virtual drive. Then replace the executables! It's easy! Hooray for Bubby!"

,Jansen101,2011-03-30T18:38Z,"Regarding skidrow files iw4mp and iw4sp.

You won't find them in the folder you extracted from/into:

> mount CD 2 
> open the folder 'computer' 
> right click on the image of the CD (named disk_2) and click on 'open' 
> be overwhelmed by finding the SKIDROW-folder and the needed files within 
> copy and overwrite into the folder you installed the game in 
> Enjoy!"
