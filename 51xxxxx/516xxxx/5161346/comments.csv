i am getting ""unable to connect to tracker"" in bittornado, using it from the console; that just means the tracker is busy, right?
firewall should allow me to connect out.

never started a torrent from the console before."
,number-g,2009-11-14T02:34Z,"actually the exact error is ""Problem connecting to tracker - timeout exceeded""

i will check again in the morning; if not i might need someone to hold my hand here if they want the film ..."
