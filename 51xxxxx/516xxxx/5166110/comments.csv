,Joewee,2009-11-24T16:24Z,"What I did is just copied the 2 files from the previous version of Navigon 1.2. One of 
the files was the map of virginia the other 
one was eng-USA_Sarah_def_tts.sar which
is the text to speech file. The Text to speech
now works fine. If you don't know how to do
this rename the extension on the ipa files on both to zip extension. Open both and copy the 2 files into the 1.3 version from the 1.2 version. Change back to an ipa extension and install on
your phone."
,thevoiceover,2009-11-25T13:39Z,"joewee, i did the same thing on mine and it seemed to work fine for a few days and then the app crashed when giving me voice instructions on the local toll road. I still think the tts was updated and we do not have the same version. Does anyone have the correct good ones from 1.3? "
,Joewee,2009-11-25T20:41Z,I have been still using it with no crashes. Still working fine going on about a week.
