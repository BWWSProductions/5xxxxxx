The Long Good Friday is a truly great look at very interesting characters
indeed. The best ever performances by Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren.
A great mobster flick with Irish flair.Figure in an IRA connection and the New
York mob, and you have a prescription for riveting suspense and the greatest
action story unfolding. Its simply the very best mob movie ever made. Get your
hands on this one at the store too when prices have dropped from our efforts to
get the industry on side with reasonable pricing models! (five bucks a DVD
and we'll take all you can make! "literally").

By the way, we are launching a single folder with a dozen Poirot (David Suchet)

DVDs from Columbia House DVD club (we buy almost all DVDs exclusively from them -
great deals!, for donation to the local library).
