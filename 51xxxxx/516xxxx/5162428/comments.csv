,rippervanwinkle,2009-11-15T08:38Z,"Unfortunately this is a truly horrible rip.  The audio is very low bitrate mp3 and the video has HUGE black bars top and bottom and also small black bars left and right. The aspect ratio looks shitty as well.

,mrizzo2,2009-11-15T21:34Z,This is a re-release of a Criterion Collection DVD movie that with a lovely picture and great sound quality although we would have preferred the opening theme music be at a better frequency range and we did try to improve on it. We uploaded this before with no compliantsat all despite many downloads. Perhaps you folks have a glitch or something that youve encountered for yourselves.

Thanks for the upload, Rizzo.  (You might not want to put your full name on a film you are allowing to be pirated.  Just FYI. ;)"
