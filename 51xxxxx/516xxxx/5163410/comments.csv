,Mohammed1984,2009-11-16T05:07Z,"When I want to Install the game by running Setup.exe on the CD I Get this:

Extracting file failed.  It is most likely caused by low memory (low disk 
space for swapping file) or corrupted Cabinet file.


What's that mean????
Please Some body help me, I Love This Games.

,GylleMads,2010-04-23T16:17Z,Can't save either
,foxoscar,2010-09-18T21:28Z,Also having issues with saving.
,foxoscar,2010-09-18T22:44Z,"I think I've found the fix to the issues with not saving. Download SQLite Database Browser (2.0b2 was the version as of this writing), load it up, and open the ""config.hdb"" file located in the directory where you installed Madballs. Click the Browse Data tab, and from the drop-down, pick bv3Vars. Scroll down to the 82 line, double click where it says ""false"" and change it to true. Make sure you click ""Apply Changes"" as well... it's not automatic. Save the file, and load it up. I also enabled ""d_profileInfo"" (line 11). When you're playing a game, if you bring down the console (`), it should show info of the profile.hdb being updated."
