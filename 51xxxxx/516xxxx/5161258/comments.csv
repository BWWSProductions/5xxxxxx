Whooohoooo!  "

,Temptation,2009-11-14T05:21Z,"the real hero are actual Russians like Gorbachev and like-minded reformers in the Soviet system who had the courage to voluntarily dismantle their collapsing empire after realizing that retaining the Soviet empire's brutal iron grip on its satellite and client-states would have required the use of great violence and full scale war that could have easily led to a third world war and the inevitable use of nuclear weapons, and perhaps the destruction of human civilization as a result.

If anything, imbecile Yankee cowboys like Reagan and his gang of insane NeoCon war-mongers did everything to encourage a third world war with their reactionary policies that left a trail of death and destruction in the Third World which was used as a battle ground for the power struggle between the US and the USSR, leading to scorched earth policies that saw the deaths of millions of brown people murdered and slaughtered and tortured in the most barbaric way, with full American support and even active American intervention, from Indo-china, to Central America, to South America, to Africa, to the Middle-East.

Unfortunately, I doubt very much that America will behave in the same civilized, restrained, moral, and frankly, realistic manner that the Russians behaved when they were faced with the choice between continuing on the same path of brutality and sustaining empire while bankrupting their country and impoverishing their citizens or giving up their empire, and facing the consequences, which would include a diminishing of power and privilege for their country and empire, and more importantly, wealth and power and privilege for the Russian elites. 

Today, the American empire faces the same choice as the Russians did, and despite the Hope-and-Change bullshit spewed by slick con-artist Obama, it should be apparent the American elite show no desire or even inclination of altering their disastrous imperial policies.  All Obama has done is changed the belligerent tone of Bush and the NeoCons but the core policies are still the same, as is the fundamental belief of the American ruling elite that they have the right dominate the planet using military power and slaughter thousands and even millions of brown people for policies they claim are in the good interest of everyone.  How convenient .. one should ask the people who have to face American and Israeli smart-bombs and missiles and drones what they think of American ""benevolent"" empire.  But of course, these are the lowly brown people of the third world, and their opinions, and even lives, don't count much for most people in the racist West.

After all, we're talking about the racist, vicious, brutal American elite, truly one of the most greediest, vicious ruling elite that have ever existed in the history of the planet.  After all, this is a country with an incredible arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, and the only country racist and insane enough to use nuclear weapons.  Do you really think when push comes to shove, and given the increasing resistance to the American empire by people and races who have long suffered the vicious, brutal policies of the American empire, i.e., the Middle-East and Latin America, that the American ruling elite will voluntarily relinquish the brutal, vicious grip of the American Empire over the globe without unleashing an orgy of death and destruction on people resisting the American empire.  

The Russian case was really an anomaly.  No great power or empire voluntarily relinquished its grip on others without resistance and without facing military defeat.  This is why I say that despite the most WEstern and American propaganda against Russia and Russians, the Russians actually behaved in a far more moral, civilized and realistic manner than Americans are capable of behaving in.  When you combine the predatory nature of the American elites, and frankly, of every set of elite that exist in every country or ever have existed, who tend to benefit the most from imperial policies but who make others below their lofty perches of power and privilege pay the price "

We all face the prospect that, if Russia were ever attacked, its strategic nuclear warheads could be launched by a computer system designed and built in the late 1970s.
