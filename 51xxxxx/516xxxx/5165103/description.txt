My kids are big fans of the show but DVDs and merchandise are IMPOSSIBLE to find so I put this collection together for other parents in the same boat.  I made these with my TV Tuner card so the quality isn't perfect but it's plenty watchable.  

Captured with HVR-1600
cleaned up with IVTC and motion-adaptive cubic interpolate deinterlacing in AVIDemux

All files are in XVID with a quantizer factor of 2

Roughly 3 and a half hours worth all together.

Enjoy!
