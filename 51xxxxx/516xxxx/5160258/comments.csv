,tauffen,2009-12-02T00:59Z,I'm a little dumb for this. Could anyone tell me how do I fix the part 12 using the recovery data?
,Not_a_Cat,2009-12-06T09:55Z,"There seems to be a problem with 2 rar files: 12 & 20 ...  :(
Sadly, this makes the file ""VTS_03_2.VOB"" to be corrupt...
Is there any posibily of please uploading only this file individually?
Thank you in advance"
,disimagery2,2010-08-06T10:58Z,"to fix the corrupt rar files [disc 3 parts 12 and 20]-
open each one w/ winrar, use 'tools' > 'repair archives'... selct 'ok' when asked...each file has a recovery record and should repair.
after this, delete the original 'corrupt' files and then replace w/ the new 'repaired' files [be sure to rename- take off the ""fixed."" part at the front of each file] and retry the unrar."
