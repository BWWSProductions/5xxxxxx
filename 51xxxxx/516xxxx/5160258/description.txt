ABOUT THE BOXSET:
One of the most acclaimed Japanese directors of all time, Hiroshi Teshigahara distinguished himself in the sixties with a series of sinuous, atmospheric, and daring films. 

Teshigahara found his spiritual partner in novelist and screenwriter Kobo Abe, with whom he collaborated on these Kafkaesque portraits of identities in peril, films that 

captivated mainstream audiences while also touching the edges of the Japanese avant-garde. The existential ghost story Pitfall (Otoshiana), the shocking, erotic fable Woman in 

the Dunes (Sunna no onna), and the sci-fiâ€“tinged nightmare The Face of Another (Tanin no kao) are among cinema's enduring enigmas and rarest pleasures.

DISC ONE

PITFALL
http://www.criterion.com/films/827
1962, 97 min.
When a miner leaves his employers and treks out with his young son to become a migrant worker, he finds himself moving from one eerie landscape to another, intermittently 

followed (and photographed) by an enigmatic man in a clean white suit, and eventually coming face to face with his inescapable destiny. Hiroshi Teshigaharaâ€™s debut feature and 

first collaboration with novelist Kobo Abe, Pitfall is many things: a mysterious, unsettling ghost story, a portrait of human alienation, and a compellingly surreal critique 

of soulless industry, shot in elegant black and white.

DISC TWO

WOMAN IN THE DUNES
http://www.criterion.com/films/826
1964, 147 min.
One of the sixties' great international art-house sensations, Woman in the Dunes was for many the grand unveiling of the surreal, idiosyncratic worldview of Hiroshi 

Teshigahara. Eija Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle that resides in a remote, vast desert; when he misses his 

bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night in the home of a young widow (Kiyoko Kishida) who lives in a hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one 

of cinema's most bristling, unnerving, and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday Sisyphean struggle, for which Teshigahara 

received an Academy Award nomination for best director.

DISC THREE

THE FACE OF ANOTHER
http://www.criterion.com/films/828
1966, 124 min.
A staggering work of existential science fiction, The Face of Another dissects identity with the sure hand of a surgeon. Okuyama (Yojimbo's Tatsuya Nakadai), after being 

burned and disfigured in an industrial accident and estranged from his family and friends, agrees to his psychiatrist's radical new experiment: a face transplant, created from 

the mold of a stranger. As Okuyama is thus further alienated from the strange world around him, he finds himself giving in to his darker temptations. With unforgettable 

imagery, Teshigaharaâ€™s film explores both the limits and freedom in acquiring a new persona, and questions the notion of individuality itself.
