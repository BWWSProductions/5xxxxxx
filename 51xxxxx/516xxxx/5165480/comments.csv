,chuchunesme,2009-11-16T18:08Z,Even if its not perfect I'll say thanks for the honest effort. If your going to complain about the quality of something then maybe you should take an HD camcorder into a theater and make us a R5 quality copy? 
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T20:17Z,you beat me not bad :)
,f2theox,2009-11-16T21:13Z,"in all honesty, to me it seems like most samples are worse than the actual rip of the whole movie. Check the full download before judging just from a sample ;-) thanks for the upload! Greatly appreciated!"
[V],Murlok,2009-11-16T21:49Z,"Copy comment from my torrent of
DrChandra    correction, the stass version has significant audio sync issue. as much as 1 second in the middle. this one is much better. so it's a tradeoff 
 so trust the uploader here This is a good one and worth 1 more Gig :)"

,bloodhungry7,2009-11-18T21:15Z,"This movie was fucking awful!!! Prolly the dumbest think to date next to the new hallowen and the new final destination, these films should all be locked away or burnt and the actors and ppl involved should be scalped, hung, shot, dissmembered, drown, and fed to the cannibals in iraq! How the fuck does a limo jump through a crumbling building like its a fucking dirtbike not to mention the RV thats broke in half,on fire, and also does a massive jump after being hit by a flying volcanic rock that wouldve incenerated the whole fucking thing! Also our world wether on the verge of ending or not would never be able to get all the countries to come together id be all out anarchy, and its obsurde to think that anyone would live through any event portrayed in this movie!! Anyone who likes this film is a fucking idoit and belongs in iraq with those fucking retards!!!!"

,PeonyG,2009-11-23T13:31Z,"How much jitter does this have in it lol. I know no one in the theater is smart enough to run A/V to a laptop from the projection system without getting caught or have the know hows to do it...

So is this another video camera in the audience recording a movie with peoples heads in the way randomly and idle chit chat in the audio?
or is it worth the bandwidth to download?"
