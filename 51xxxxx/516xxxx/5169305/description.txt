Collection of Sabretooth solo adventures.

Sabretooth (Victor Creed) is a Marvel Comics supervillain created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne.  The character first appeared in Iron Fist #14 (August 1977).  Sabretooth is a mutant who possesses bestial superhuman abilities, most notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman senses.  He is a vicious assassin responsible for numerous deaths both as a paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure.

Creed is Wolverine's long-time enemy, although conflicting accounts have been given as to the origin of their feud.  It is also known that he and Sabretooth were victims of the Cold War supersoldier program Weapon X, and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and tried to make his life miserable.  While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite and embraces them.
