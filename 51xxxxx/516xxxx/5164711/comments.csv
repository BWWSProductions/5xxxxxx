,Backpackeren,2009-11-16T06:48Z,come on with the english version!!!!!... all the countries that makes language sync should be shot!... WTF is that about?? first of all it looks so stupid that voice and lips is not in sync. second of all the voice dosent fit with the actors real voice
,maximus3333,2009-11-16T10:04Z,55% and all the seeds have gone anyway now!
,maximus3333,2009-11-16T10:11Z,"Can now update on this. The sampple is working at 55% and both the sound and video are outstanding.
If the main file is as good it's a cracker. Oh yeah, and in English.
And there is now 1 seeder!
Thanks

Course that's only the sample"
,maximus3333,2009-11-16T11:30Z,stass seems to be having problems seeding his own torrent so it is going to be slow. Those who are downloading are going to be downloading chunks from each other. Let's hope we have ALL the chunks.
,stass,2009-11-16T12:49Z,"Its eng, not german, and i seed now, so download!"
,maximus3333,2009-11-16T13:29Z,"I never thought you wouldn't, stass.
Thankyou. and this seems to be the best version around right now. 
I must confess though I was confused  after extremezones post why a guy in Sweden would upload a movie in German?
HeHe"
,stass,2009-11-16T14:53Z,"maximus3333 Its in ENG, not german"
,maximus3333,2009-11-16T15:03Z,"Yes. I know it is. I've already seen the sample. And already said in my second post that it was in English. There was a claim that it was in German. I did not believe that because I know you are, I believe, Swedish. So it seemed silly for someone to post a link to film in German which he probably can't speak or understand.

But if you are posting, 2 now, and the tracker isn't finding your link, it's because you've 'hidden' the file or deleted it. Why would you do that.???
Please seed.
I've downloaded 566mb and already upped 1gig!!"
,DrChandra,2009-11-16T16:37Z,"by far the best version outthere and the only watchable version. it appears to combine the excellent video of the camelot video (that had awful audio) with the good audio from the other version. this is it. never mind the liars who say it's german. it's english.
as cams go this is a 10 overall. as good as it gets"
,Mandoofism,2009-11-16T17:24Z,"stuck at 96.8% the end is near
great quality"
,maximus3333,2009-11-16T17:56Z,"685mb and 98.2%. Looks like I might be first to start seeding though my ratio is 1.7.

I will leave this for a while to seed."
,Mandoofism,2009-11-16T19:20Z,nvm dont waste ur time on thyis its so badly out of sync ;]. someone will comment saying use vlc to adjust it but might as well wait for a real release done right.
,FORJCME,2009-11-16T21:46Z,OUT SYNC
,emjay_67,2009-11-16T21:59Z,"Very good copy. Downloaded in 14 minutes on my T1. English definitely and in perfect synch. Quality is about V8 A7, very watchable. Burned perfectly with cucusoft. Thankyou very much to Stass."
[T],minifrepper,2009-11-16T23:37Z,"Out of sync yes. The sound are also bad. Very sharp and unpleasant.

The video are lmore or less ike the other best ones so far. But not as good as the Russian."
,anewman,2009-11-16T23:39Z,Its a good copy. At the beginning though I realized that the audio does not match the movie itself. It takes a few for it to actually match up. Other then that its a good copy like I said. V8 A7
