Is this any way to run a government?

As the Clinton administration claims significant progress in its commitment to streamline the federal government, FRONTLINE investigates the one agency that is arguably the most resistant to reform - the Department of Agriculture. This program focuses on excesses, abuse and mismanagement in the USDA. Not much has changed in a decade and a half; a lesson for all those who think more government and bureaucracy is wonderful !
