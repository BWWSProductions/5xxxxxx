PlayStation-Ready Movie Trailers
November 19, 2009


This is a collection of movie trailers for this and next week
premieres and just latest trailers. Everything in HD 1080p where
possible, all ready to be copied and watched on your shiny
PlayStation 3. Seems that including trailers only for this
week premieres is not enough, because the torrent is downloaded
and watched on Saturday, when it'd be better just to stand up
and go to the nearest theater. Also a little rebranding :)

XBox 360 owners - please, try this and tell whether it shows!
