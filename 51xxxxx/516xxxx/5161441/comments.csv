[V],mothergoose56,2009-11-14T05:17Z,"Holy S**t. My dedicated O&A system died mid re-encode of the 128k file!! It's getting no power. No O&A from me until I get something back up and running.....

After two problems in the am, and needing to get two replays for an intact show - THE DAMN COMPUTER DIES. On Friday the 13th no less. I'll yank the drive this weekend and try my other (more powerful but not-fanless) mini PC and I hope be ready for Monday. 

I haven't missed a live O&A show since I began ripping it myself in April of this year. Almost got me today but not quite. "
