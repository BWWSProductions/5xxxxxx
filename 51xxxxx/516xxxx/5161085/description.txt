This file is the same frequencies that Dr. Len Horowitz talks about as being found in the bible and heal the body including regenerating and renewing your DNA.  There are 9 frequencies each having a different function in the body, releasing guilt and fear, energy, healing, unification, intuition, restoration of the spirit, etc.  These are very powerful and I am always buzzing and feel euphoric after listening to these.

I made this myself with the addition of Buddhist chanting and music, and with added Loons.  The best way to enjoy this is with the phone off the hook and lying down.  If you do not have the time for that (how busy we are these days) then I sometimes have the headphones on when on the computer.

Use with Headphones or loud (not too much) without.
