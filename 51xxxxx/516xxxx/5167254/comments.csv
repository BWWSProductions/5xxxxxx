,could_do_better,2009-11-17T22:45Z,"Thanks for the up! Been looking forward to this for ages. I did rather balk at the size, until I saw the run time!

Could you please confirm the resolution - 720x204 seems less likely than 720x304. A typo, or just the widest screen movie ever?"
,smartdumbnstupid,2009-11-18T00:44Z,Is the 720p version out yet from ViSiON?
,WTFsht,2009-11-18T19:37Z,Good quality. Thank you!
,WTFsht,2009-11-18T19:38Z,Resolution is 720x304.
