,city89,2009-11-22T13:09Z,Looks tight! Hope it really is cracked! Thanks so much for these :)
,andrewdee,2009-11-25T18:53Z,"this is the demo without crack
and although it does not generate a beeping sound there is a loud hiss or some other background buzz or sound it  needs a crack"
,gyaradon,2009-11-29T04:44Z,"I noticed that background noise, too, but I think it's just bad software design. Anyway, I was decidedly underwhelmed by these apps."
,bdeppenbrook,2010-01-06T17:40Z,These are demo's. The hiss is what Syntheway uses in demo mode. I have a torrent for Syntheway Strings full version uploaded & there is also a Syntheway Magnus Choir torrent on here too.
