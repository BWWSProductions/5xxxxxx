Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane is a 2007 zombie film by director Scott Thomas.

The film involves a Boeing 747 airliner infested with zombies of the Dawn of the Dead remake variety, capable of moving quickly and leaping. While seemingly playing off of the concept of Snakes on a Plane, the film was in production at the very same time as Snakes on a Plane and was developed independently.

The film was originally titled Plane Dead, but the title was changed at Montreal's 2007 Fantasia Festival screening. However, in spite of a successful screening there and at other festivals, the film did not gain a commercial release and was issued directly to DVD in unrated form.
