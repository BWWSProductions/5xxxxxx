Synopis: A girl in her twenties tries to bring a little light and levity to her life that she finds inadequate, futile and lacking in the intensity that she requires. She decides to give her love--not to the most seductive guy, nor the most deserving or most admirable one. No, they don't need her. She will give her love to just anybody.
