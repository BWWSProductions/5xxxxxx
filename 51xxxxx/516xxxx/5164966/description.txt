Juvenile is one of the greatest southern rappers of all time, the diary of a Soulja album was never released I dont suppose, but Ive collected these songs over the past year, all this is pretty new or brand new, just like 3 older songs out of 46. I did make this myself out of all the new tracks I had, these are Juve's best work to date in my opinion. Everything should be tagged and there is album covers for 1 & 2, please let me know how I did, keep in mind Im not a Dj just a music lover!



I will add the track list on here when I get time tomorrow
