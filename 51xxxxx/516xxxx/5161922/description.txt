These are the unabridged audiobooks to the All-American Girl series by Meg Cabot. Narrated by Ariadne Meyers.

I have split each book up into their chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  In the original torrent, they were split up into two mp3 files, and I  broke those mp3 files into smaller ones, one for each chapter.  I then made them into m4b files, which is what is in this torrent.

As far as I have been able to tell, there hasn't really been anything wrong with these files from the beginning. But, if you find something the matter, just comment and I'll try and fix what is wrong.

Enjoy.
