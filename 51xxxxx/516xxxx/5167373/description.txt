Canadian melodic death metallers Thy Flesh Consumed with their brand new CD, Unrepentant.

Support this band because they endorse this release and the previous ones.

From Peter himself:
"...put that album online, please add the cover and links to our website and myspace, that's all I ask.
We live for extreme music and intend on dying while playing/listening to extreme music. If people are going to support our mania, then they are going to support it. You can't get blood from a stone...Like I mentioned before, if it weren't for the internet and file sharing, I wouldn't know about all of my favourite bands, bands that I proudly buy CD's and shirts from."

Enjoy it. Ripped in 320CBRMP3, of course.
