_____________________________________________

Recorded Live At The Scene Club in New York City, 1968 

featuring Jim Morrison, Johnny Winter, Buddy Miles
_______________________________________________________

According to Johnny Winter he never actually appeared on this after hours session 
at Steve Pauls "Scene Club" in 1968.It's probably Jorma Kaukonen instead of him. 

Basically the session is based on one of those times in the 60s when someone left 
the tape machine running without the full knowledge of the artists, mind you, 
they were so stoned they wouldn't have cared anyway. "Bleeding Heart" is probably 
the 'best' track on here if i were to make a choice. It's taken at a funky pace.

This recording has been issued and re-issued under various guises and titles 
under Hendrixs's name both on vinyl and CD.("Woke up this morning and found myself dead" being the most famous) Even came out as a bootleg back in the 70s. 

The sound is of typical poor bootleg quality and the musicianship is well below par with screaming obscenities being hurled from Jim Morrisons corner that would make the likes of Marilyn Manson blush.(on "Uranus Blues" Well, what more do you expect with a title like that?? 

The whole session turned into something of a joke inspite of Jimi trying to inject some seriousness into it.Like the original LP i think the CD should carry an 'advisory" label because it's as obscene in places than the vilest rap record today. 

Not for the faint hearted.
