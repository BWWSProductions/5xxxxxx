Synopsis
Controversial tabloid favourite, radio DJ, writer, ladies' man, and now Hollywood star, Russell Brand, goes back to his comedy roots in this live stand-up show. Fresh from his scene-stealing turn as a pretentious rock star in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, Brand brings his unique, often surreal, observational musings to London's O2 arena as part of his 2009 SCANDALOUS tour.
