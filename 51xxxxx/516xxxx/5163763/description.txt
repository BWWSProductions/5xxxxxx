This is a BBC documentary about those Muslims who fought and died in the service of the British armed forces. For those not familiar with the term, "Tommy" or â€œTommy Atkinsâ€ is generic and affectionate term for our soldiers dating back to the Victorian era.

The programme focuses mainly, though not exclusively, on WW1 with simple and excellent reconstructions based on letters written home. It is well researched and well acted and truly wrenches the heart. It is hard to imagine the horror and brutality of the trenches. Cold, damp, rat infested, mud, rain, snow and grey skies with no sun were terrible for everyone. I canâ€™t help though but feel more sorrow for those who came from bright warm and sunny places as these would have been harder to endure.

At around 3,000 dead and 16,000 wounded their casualties are slight for WW1 (British loses susained on 1st July 1916 alone were 19,000 dead & 40,000 wounded), but they were there and highly regarded for their courage, Ã©lan and discipline.


BNP members, racists and other extreamists would do well to watch this.
