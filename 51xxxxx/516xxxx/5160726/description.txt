I really hope you all enjoy this torrent as i have put many hours into compiling all of this for you. I put all the painstaking effort into this torrent because of a comment request on my exclusive K.O.D. torrent and am more than happy to accommodate any other requests you may have to the best of my ability, as well please comment on the quality of the upload, what you liked or didn't like and anything else you may want to say

thank you as well to my loyal downloaders,
