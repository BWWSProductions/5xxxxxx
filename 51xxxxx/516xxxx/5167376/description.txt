Windows 7 Pre-Activation Kit v2.7.0 for Windows 7 (16-11-09)

New Windows 7 activation toolkit. Just get yourself Windows 7 releases from GRP or WZT, choose one of the activation methods and youâ€™re good to go. Read instructions first.

this pre-activation kit is appropriate for systems with
a BIOS mod or systems that require a bootloader to activate.

when the script runs it first checks if the system is activated
if not it installs a certificate for the OEM present in the BIOS
then checks if the system activated, if not then installs a 
bootloader with an Acer SLIC and installs an Acer certificate
then reboots the system.

note: bootloader is zsmin v0.97, keys are installed with DISM


[contents]

miso.exe - extracts .iso
sha1.exe - performs checksum on .iso
oscdimg.exe - creates the bootable .iso
imagex.exe - deletes the unactivated images
Make_x32_DVD.cmd - script to make the preactivated x32 .iso
Make_x64_DVD.cmd - script to make the preactivated x64 .iso

=================================================================================================================

[directions]

place an un-touched offical Windows 7 RTM .iso in the
Pre-Activation_kit directory

if you want logos automatically installed accroding to the OEM info 
in your BIOS then place logos folder, logos.vbs and OOBE.cmd in 
$OEM$$$SETUPSCRIPTS


if you want to install the product key via a script
place key.vbs and SetupComplete.cmd in 
$OEM$$$SETUPSCRIPTS

the scripts will ignore the commands to intragrate the
keys into install.wim

should be used in conjunction with a custom ei.cfg to 
avoid OOBE asking for a key, but will make a single edition
install dvd.

pre-made ei.cfg's can be found in the ei.cfgs directory 
pick one and rename it to ei.cfg and place it in the
pre-activation_kit directory. it will then be copied
to the DVD.
