,Bevelaqua,2011-10-28T19:51Z,"I need English subs, heard the show is violent and good!"
,nellypaal,2011-11-01T00:39Z,"Does ANYONE have any plans to upload the FX screening of this with hardcoded English subs?  Or, a link to some good subs for this torrent would be awesome!"
,Bevelaqua,2011-11-01T06:45Z,"Absolutely agree! Word is that this show is as good as The Shield. No english subs appear on the internet, so please upload the FX one! I'm literally jonesing for a good, gritty cop show after The Shield and The Wire ended, help me!"
