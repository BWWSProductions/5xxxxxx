The original motorcycle-riding, two-gun hero known as The Vigilante stars in this mini-series set in 1940s Las Vegas!

Greg Saunders - a.k.a. The Vigilante - hits Los Angeles to appear in a Western shoot-'em-up. But when his sidekick, Stuff, runs afoul of mobster Ben "Bugsy" Siegel and is killed, The Vigilante swings into action. This gritty tale contrasts the glamor of Las Vegas and Hollywood with The Vigilante's old West justice. 

Written by James Robinson, with art by Tony Salmons and Bret Blevins.
