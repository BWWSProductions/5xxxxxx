,deejus,2009-11-22T07:56Z,Anyone know if the upcoming movie covers past chapter 8?
,TokiWartooth,2009-12-06T16:20Z,"@deejus
this is a limited run comic, it ends after issue 8"
,jadd6810,2009-12-12T07:20Z,Marvels website says the shelf date as January 13 2010
,t_webster,2009-12-19T20:27Z,Thank you!
,DragonArm,2009-12-25T02:48Z,"yeah, they delayed it."
,pspaddict,2009-12-29T22:52Z,The release date of these issues have been murder! Some issues were separated 4 months apart. Now we gotta wait for that elusive issue 8.
,kingkratoz,2010-01-04T17:55Z,good graphic novel! i hope 8 is to released soon!!! thanks for the upload man : )
,DragonArm,2010-01-13T08:17Z,"delayed again, February 17!"
,deejus,2010-01-29T09:35Z,"It's obvious that they're not going to release it till the movie is out, to ensure no one knows the ending till they see the movie. Standard marketing tactic."
,deejus,2010-01-30T09:49Z,"Scratch what I said. The New kick-ass is out! It's included in a comic pack. Get it and seed!

Issue05 is poorly scanned, it's a shame. All the rest are top quality."
