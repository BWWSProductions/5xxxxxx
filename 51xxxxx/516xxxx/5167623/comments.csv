,evilmonkey99,2009-12-17T10:18Z,bullshit! Spoken language is SPANISH!
,evilmonkey99,2009-12-28T11:54Z,"Thank you webchella! This video has English and Spanish subtitles as well as the english commentaries. 
I found out that even though Windows media player plays the video, it doesn't recognize the different audio and subtitles that are available. You need to use a different video player to change the audio or subtitles. I use VLC Player.
Thank you again!"
