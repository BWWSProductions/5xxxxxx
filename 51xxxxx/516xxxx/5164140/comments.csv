,dcj1978,2009-12-11T04:34Z,"A 400 meg DVD rip?  I see you're ""trusted"" but, anyone test this yet?  An hour and a half long movie should be more than 400 megs I'd think."
[V],MKVGuy,2009-12-13T04:56Z,"no one have complained yet, you too can trust the file from a 'Trusted' user, plz go ahead with the download.."

,nikflickz,2010-01-29T20:39Z,"@dcj1978, don't worry.. i've downloaded one of his uploads.. transformers 2, its about 2 and a half hour and 400mb.. so i guess 400mb for a 1 and a half hr movie sounds reasonable :)

a=10
v=9.5

MKVGuy's a genius :)"
