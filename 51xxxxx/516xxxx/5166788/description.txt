so there's already an HD 720p HBO of this, and it seems better (higher bitrate) than what i have so i'll skip the HD and release this instead. 

Video codec - XVID
Video Bitrate - 1000kbps
Audio Codec - AC3
Audio Bitrate - 64 kbps

complete from pre fight video presentation to post fight interviews and comments.
