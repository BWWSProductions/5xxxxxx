,thinkinmansjoker,2009-11-18T04:55Z,can you still upload your HD version? i would rather download your version since it includes the pre-fight video presentation.. thanks!
,apsandhu,2009-11-18T16:10Z,thanks for this and thanks for the HD link....
,mgicptato,2009-11-18T18:53Z,"@joker my chillin's video has the pre fight and post fight as well, only difference i see is that he used AVC 4.0 high profile and AAC stereo audio, i encoded using 4.1 high profile and i kept the original AC3 5.1 audio. my video bitrate is lower than his' cause my audio bitrate is at 384kbps. so they're almost identical and his torrent should have a lot of seeds by now i would thnik"
,mgicptato,2009-11-18T18:55Z,"i meant ""mine and chillin's"" at the beginning"
,mgicptato,2009-11-18T23:08Z,someone broght to my attention that the audio doesn't come on with windows media player. but it works fine with media player classic or VLC
