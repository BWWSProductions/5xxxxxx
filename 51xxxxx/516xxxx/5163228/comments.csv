,wazz62,2009-11-15T18:17Z,"Nice download, though followed file placement instructions though cetain gauges are blank. Any ideas?"
,Ivantav,2009-11-15T18:47Z,Only FSX?
,future737captain,2009-11-15T19:39Z,"Wazz62, you have to put the gauges that are inside the airbus gauge folder into the main fsx gauge folder. you cant only put the gauge folder in. hope this helps."
,future737captain,2009-11-15T19:40Z,oh and Ivantav no this should work for FS9 too...thats what it was originally designed for
,Ivantav,2009-11-15T20:27Z,"Thanks, future737captain!!

,future737captain,2009-11-29T08:25Z,resist777 youre supposed to put the contents of the folders in the main folder.
,future737captain,2009-11-29T08:25Z,"so eg: gauges folder for the airbuses, take the shit inside the guages folder and paste them in the MAIN gauge folder."
,mdognwa,2009-12-02T02:28Z,"Very good! Thanks! They sure do have great A330 models!

,runningdeer,2010-07-25T15:24Z,"Great package, for me...TYVM.

Easy install, planes work fine with the exception of sound. Engine sounds are there for a short time, then disappear after a moment or two. I can still hear ambient sounds from the cockpit.

Anybody have any ideas to help me with the engine sounds? 

Thanx uploader. "
,runningdeer,2010-07-25T16:01Z,"I found a fix for engine sounds disappearing.

I used a third party aircraft sound addon, and applied sounds from a A321 to all the aircraft in this package. Sounds awesome and seems stable.

I used Flight 1's Audio environment - ""Airliner edition"". 

There is also a patch (178mb) for this package but I haven't tried to apply it yet. By the way, I have FSX/deluxe/with serv pack 2 applied/Vista32."
,runningdeer,2010-07-25T16:35Z,"There is a patch for this airplane package.

Any way to get the serial? (needed to install)"
