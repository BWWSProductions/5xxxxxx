This Side Up is a Michigan-based snowboarding movie by "Fresh Air.". We spent the last winter filming at all of our local spots as well as a few not so local places in order to bring our viewers a video that they can relate to.

This Side Up features: Alex Cato, Andy Chamarro, Dean Ferrari, Erik Zimmerman, Jackson Kimball, Joe Mango, Josh Nelson, Justin Allen, Scott See, Tommy Young, Trevor Jacques, and Trevor Rhoda as well as a ton of local friends and some friends we met along the way.

Thanks to our sponsors: Rome SDS, Lib Tech, Bent Metal, Neff, Von Zipper, and Forum

Thanks to everyone else that we may have forgotten that made this all possible.
