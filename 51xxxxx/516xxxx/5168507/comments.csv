I live in the USA, and ran this on top of the Razor1911 version of Sims3, and it worked perfectly. I originally installed the Sims3 for my girlfriends daughter, and she has ""saved games"" on it. I mounted the rar file using Damon Tools Lite, and let it go... I entered the serial given in the comments section earlier (thanks to whoever posted that), updated the version automatically, and copied the crack into the WA bin file... NO PROBLEMS AT ALL... Still have the saved games and all. I just wanted to add my ""two cents""...have seen a lot of bad stories about getting this up to work, but it worked perfectly for me. Thanks again to extremezone... your efforts, time, generosity, and skill is VERY much appreciated!! Thanks much, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.

,PopotePR,2009-12-10T22:19Z,"Solution for update and regional for install The sims 3 World adventure :D

The latest update should be 2.0.86.002002 so if you have that, then World Adventures should install without problem.
If you are having the updating problem, and cant install WA, then try this - it worked for me. ^^

Go to Computer, Local Disk C, Program Files, Electronic Arts, Sims 3, Game, Bin and find ""Default.ini""
Open the file and scroll to the very bottom (the last line) where you'll see ""GameVersion."" Replace whatever you have with 2.0.86.002002 and save.
Next, find ""skuversion.txt"" and again find ""GameVersion"" (should be the first line). Replace whatever you have with 2.0.86.002002 and save.
Try installing World Adventures again.

second you have to do this:

1) Go to Start, Run (or press ""Windows"" and ""R""), and type regedit to open the Registry Editor.

2) Then they have to go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SOFTWARE / SIMS / THE SIMS 3. On the right you'll see a file called SKU, and make you double click in the window that appears replacing the hexadecimal value by 2.
Important: For those who are going to Win Seven ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/WOW6432Node/Electronic Arts / Sims / The Sims 3"", in ""The Sims 3"" do right click, they ""look"" and there write ""SKU"", press on ""Find Next"" and replace in Hexadesimal number of ""SKU"" that appears to them (409) for ""2""

i do that and that work for me :)"
,Mirmei,2009-12-10T22:59Z,"The game works perfectly for me, almost. 

After I had played for couple of hours and my sim came back from a trip, I noticed how all her relationships had been removed. Everything was gone. When the sim interacted with other sims the ""relation-bar"" turned red and there was no sign of what kind of relationship they shared. It's kinda frustrating, but the problem disappears when the sim goes back abroad. Has anyone else noticed something similar, or is this just the first sign that I should get the real thing?"

everything worked perfectly up until the point where i had to copy the file thats named TS3EP01 to the other game bin.. if that makes sense?

it gave me an error message that says: There is not enough space on Sims3EP01.  You need an additional 10.8 MB to copy these files.

does this mean that i do not have enough space on my computer, or did i do something wrong?  i'm not really sure what copying this file does, but when i tried running the game without doing this it just gave me error codes or told me that something went wrong during start up and to look at the Log for more information.

i will also admit that i have been messing around with copying and pasting different things to these bins, S3Launcher, Sims3, TS3, Sims3EP01 (i have no idea what im doing lol) because i got frustrated and went on a little rampage, so it may be messed up to the point where nothing will work anymore. :(

any help or information would be greatly appreciated, please and thank you for your time."

Can you help?"
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-01T16:51Z,"@ iloveapplejuice: I'm currently downloading several patches and files for this game and plan on following your guide to get this game up and running. I am hesitant, however, because you claim that your game is crashing...? Have you found a solution to this problem yet and if not is it just an occasional crash that could be helped somewhat by constantly saving? Please comment back to help clarify. Thanks in advance."
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-01T17:00Z,"@ all pirates: Does anyone know how to get this expansion and the core Sims 3 game to work without 'any' problems. I also would like to install add-ons and the 'nude' patch. I also anticipate other expansions to come along and would like to avoid having to reinstall everything and start from scratch when that occasion arises. I guess what I'm asking is there ANYONE who has dealt with all of these issues, has their game running flawlessly, and has the foresight to keep it running on future expansions? To anyone that can give a foolproof guide to these issues your help would be much appreciated by myself, along with the pirating community. BTW: I have already read several forums so I'm not looking for a 'wise' remark, just an easy guide for 'everyone.' Thanks in advance. "

For those who only load about 1/3 of the loading bar and then the game shuts down, try to upgrade your graphic card. 
Especially if u have a Nvida, if u dont upgrade them most of your games wont work to install or upgrade."

Install Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED

Download & install the sims 3 World Adventures RELOADED. While installing you will get a prompt to update click yes for update. Let it finish the update and install.
Crack with files provided in world adventures RELOADED. After you install WA RELOADED make sure and uninstall or block access to EA Update Manger.

BTW: I burned both Sims 3 and WA to a disc. & I don't know much about region codes but don't think it should be a problem. If it helps im from the south eastern part of the US."

I'm a noob at this but I've goten pretty far by myself. Someone please help!! 
My brains are going to exploded because I can figure it out. I don't think it's my graphics card because this computer is new with the newest Windows. And I hope my graphics card isn't the issue because the Sims 3 was working just fine on here today AND yesterday.

,arshie,2010-01-14T03:04Z,"I fixed it guys :D
I did this to fix mine:
(if you have the Sims 3 and WA installed, uninstall them both)
1. Install Sims 3 Razor MAXSPEED version NO CRACKING. Mount it.

2. Update the game to .631

3. Install Sims 3 WA. Make sure to mount it as well. Double click it after mounting and click ""run"" When it asks for update, allow the update to proceed.

4. After the update, continue to install like usual. Make sure you DO NOT DOWNLOAD the EA Download manager.

5. After everything is installed, get the crack for Sims 3 WA. Take all the files from the crack and copy them into the Game/Bin/bin folder of Sims WA. Overwrite the files if it asks.

6. Run the game. 

It should run fine because this is what I did. Now I play the game perfectly, with barely any lag ;D"
,arshie,2010-01-14T03:07Z,"Oh!!! And you'll need to download this update:

,arshie,2010-01-14T23:49Z,"""dope_hat""
you aren't the only one who knows how to set something up. Maybe I posted it because I was proud of myself for figuring it out and because I wanted to help others, just like you posted your instructions.

Hey everyone, I was having the loading problem, I could get the game to start but it was crashing and going back to desktop. I tried EVERYTHING and coulden't get it to work, but I Finally found a way to make it work. I hope that this is the solution for other people too.
1-Install the Sims 3 game (was the razor1911 final maxpeed), without installing the download manager.
2-I downloaded a patch called: Sims3_1.8.25.003002_from_1.0.631.00002
from http://www.patches-scrolls.de/sims3.php
and patched. (didn't crack)
3-Installed this torrent, and didn't install the dowload manager again.
4-As i coulden't get a patch to work, and when it worked i still getting the problem, i did a manual updating (got in the sims 3 WA foder/game/bin opened the Default.ini and changed at the bottom of the page the GameVersion to 2.3.33.003002 and saved)
5-after that i put the crack.
The game is working now, and dont sems to have bugs, and it was the only way, I was about to give up. see ya
ps: sorry for any english mistake, i hope that I can get understood"

,shunger,2010-02-06T20:14Z,"There's a simple solution to the problem with the game not starting because of the update. As AlphaStewart said, you have to change the version number in the 'Default.ini' file.

If you are having problems changing it go to desktop and rightclick and create new text file.

Now copy the content from the 'default.ini' file in the sims 2 WA folder to your new text file. 
Change the line that says 
Gameversion = 2.something 
to 
GameVersion = 1.7.9.002002

Save the file as Default.ini 
(make sure to change the file type to .ini, and not just rename the file to ""Default.ini.txt"")

Now go to Electronic Arts/Sims 3 world adventure/Game/Bin and delete the Default.ini file that is already there, and move your own file to the folder. 
Now click 'TS3EP01.exe' (which is the overwrited cracked one) and it should launch the game."

Hey, in your previous post u said: 

""Download Sims 3 razor 1911 Final Maxspeed, and World Adventures (Multi 9) ....

Does this mean I don't have to crack the original Sims 3 installation? Thanks for the help"
,Stack8907,2010-02-08T21:48Z,"O.K. I figured it out.

For those who are having trouble try the following:

1.) Completely uninstall World Adventures & The Sims 3 both.

2.) Reinstall The Sims 3 (do not install the EA Download Manager & do not patch or crack.) Use the keygen provided

3.) Do not open The Sims 3, Next install World adventures. It will say ""The Sims 3 must be updated in order to install Sims 3."" Click yes to update. Once updated, the install will proceed. (do not install EA download manager. again) use the serial code: 

2PXF-EYDN-L3CH-AL3A-MRLD
or
F33K-HVX5-8KR2-E8KP-6RLD

4.) Do not open World Adventures. Go to the crack directory on this iso and copy/paste into the C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin directory (there is another bin folder inside of the first bin folder but do not put the crack files in this one.)

5.) Right click the TSEP01 file that you just copied into the \bin directory and select ""Send to - Desktop(Create Shortcut)"" Use this file to start the game. You can rename the file if you like.

6.) Enjoy!
Let me know if this works for you... "

,melgail,2010-02-08T23:51Z,How do you unistall the games without having to re-download them
,Stack8907,2010-02-09T00:01Z,"@melgail

The files you need are on the image file. Mount this image to a virtual drive (if you burned it thats ok too) and click start/computer. Right click the virtual drive (or DVD drive) that you have it mounted to and click Browse. when the window pops up you should see a Crack folder. they are in there. After you replace the files and for some reason you still can not play then follow my directions above.

To uninstall:

make sure the image is mounted and go to control panel/add remove programs and wait for it to load. It may take a while before you will see it in there but It will be in there."

I would not install it on a external hard drive. U can have the image file on the external hard drive and mount it from there but install it to your C:\ drive. If the files were properly extracted then the crack folder will be within the image.  "

,Stack8907,2010-02-09T00:49Z,"@melgail

Well first off dont copy the entire Crack folder. Just copy the contents of the folder to the install directory. If you all ready have the images downloaded you wont have to re-download them. you can use them over and over. Just uninstall the games and try again. Just follow my steps that i posted previously...thats pretty much a walk through. I dont want to have to go into deeper detail than that.

,ohhman327,2010-02-14T05:08Z,"finally got it all to work.  

first you need a clean install of your sims.  that means delete all ea folders but your saved games.  delete the prog files and the my document folers.  

clean your registry with ccleaner or some other reg cleaner.

install your sims 3 core game either by reloaded or who ever.  do not install ea updater yet.

then get your custom install content you want.  riverview, Toyota prius, etc. install those via sims launcher.

then install this sims3 wa. it will ask to update during install do so to continue. this time install your ea updater.

when install finished run ts3 install from http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=344611
install the missing folders that it detects.

follow these steps for modthesims
http://www.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=382520
to move your riverview to the right folder

then get latest sims3 crack from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5338123/%5BFTL3%5D_Sims_3_World_Adventures_2.4.7_Crack

run the game via sims3 launcher it will ask to update via ea update do so.  u can browse the installed content tab to see all ur custom objects and riverview

play game enjoy!"

it gave me an error message that says: There is not enough space on Sims3EP01. You need an additional 10.8 MB to copy these files.

does this mean that i do not have enough space on my computer, or did i do something wrong? i'm not really sure what copying this file does, but when i tried running the game without doing this it just gave me error codes or told me that something went wrong during start up and to look at the Log for more information.

i will also admit that i have been messing around with copying and pasting different things to these bins, S3Launcher, Sims3, TS3, Sims3EP01 (i have no idea what im doing lol) because i got frustrated and went on a little rampage, so it may be messed up to the point where nothing will work anymore. :(

,bkhoury,2010-05-03T18:16Z,It works theres nothing wrong with neither of the torrents. HalowPT helped allot. What you have to do is download the sims 3 itself install it insert keygen and follow the steps but dont apply any crack or install the EA. After installation dont play the game. Download the World Adventure one and it will update automatically then after installation download this file Apply This Patch - http://dlh.net/cgi-bin/dlp.cgi?lang=eng&sys=pc&file=sims3wa228002002_from_2086002002.zip&ref=ps and then install it. Later on downlaod this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5206780/[FTL3]_SIMS_3_WORLD_ADVENTURES_2.2.8.002002_CRACK and place it in the Electronic file in local disk c in sims 3 world adventure file and if it asks you to opy and replace chose that. Then it might update itself which theres no problem with that. Then you can finally play with clicking the shortcuts on the desktop or just going to the original file and clicking the crack!!! Hope you enjoyed and have understood more. For further help contact me on my email bkhoury02@gmail.com
,Xenous,2010-05-04T21:20Z,"A lot of people have been experiencing an ""Error: Invalid File"" window when trying to patch the game. Allow me to explain why this is, and how to fix it.

You see, the Sims 3 patcher is very strict. It will only patch the files if they meet the EXACT specifications that it expects (In other words, a file that is by default 4.25MB MUST be 4.25MB or the patcher will come back with this error). For this reason, cracked game files will cause the patcher to throw its toys.

If you want to avoid this bug, do the following.

1. Mount and install The Sims 3 - World Adventures.
2. Run the patch NOW.
3. Backup your TS3EP01.exe and TSLHost.dll files.
4. Obtain a crack for your version of the game, and overwrite the files.
5. Play!

Hope the explanation cleared things up for those having trouble.
3. Obtain cracked files"

1) Uninstall both the base game and WA, back up your CC and savegames and select yes when it asks you if you want to keep your CC etc

2) Install the Sims 3 and don't install the download manager. Don't patch or crack the game.

3) Install World Adventures and again don't install the download manager, don't patch it or crack it yet

4) Crack your game using this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5206780/[FTL3]_SIMS_3_WORLD_ADVENTURES_2.2.8.002002_CRACK -  it gets rid of the verification error when you start the game

1: if you've already downloaded the sims 3 relaoded version. do a clean install. & download this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4915142/Sims_3.from_RELOADED_to_RAZOR_release_patch_GTI

2: replace both downloaded folders & this will patch the game to 1.0.612.00002 or something..

3: now you are able to download this patch to get up to date to 1.6.6:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168758/The.Sims.3.Update.1.6.6-BAT

if its not letting you patch due to region code, then you only need to adjust your regestry.

4: do a clean install of sims world adventures and replace the cracked files.

then it should be workin.

this method took me a long time to discover as ppl fail to write that you need to patch sims3 and must get the reloaded to razor to be able to patch.

hope this helps.

1-Installed The Sims 3 AND EA Manager
2-updated the game through the launcher
3-copied the crack I got in http://jogosforpc.blogspot.com/2010/06/sims-3-atualizacao-1122733.html (it's in portuguese, but still)
4-played for a while (a couple of hours, until all the exp. were finished downloading)
5-removed the crack, just in case (restored the backup).

6-installed world adventures.
7-let EA manager update
8-crack
9-played for just some minutes
10-removed the crack

then did the same thing for high end loft stuff and ambitions, and everything is running ok(just the first loading of my savegame for each expansion installed takes a fucklong time)

the only bad thing now is that I can't get Riverview to work anymore. It was working w/o any expansions, but now it won't appear. I was tired of that city anyway.

Sorry if its a little too easy but there are those out here who have no clue what they're doing. Just follow my directions exactly. Don?t skip anything because if you do, you?ll most likely get an error upon installing or playing the game. 

First off, if you have The Sims already installed on your computer, you need to do a clean install. Before doing this, make sure you have backed up and CC or Mods you want to keep. You can't just go to uninstall it with add/remove programs to do a clean install. You have to follow ALL of the directions here http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?titl..._Uninstall

,kiyaquriaee,2010-07-28T23:57Z,"Download Sims 3 Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/...l_MAXSPEED . Run the set-up by mounting the image found in the MAXSPEED folder. I used daemon tools to do this. Google it if you don?t have it. Use one of the serials in the NFO and install the game. DO NOT CRACK THE GAME AND IGNORE THE FINAL VERSION PATCH FOLDER . If you update the game with the patch given in the torrent you will have to do a complete clean install and start over. After you have successfully installed the game do not start it and DO NOT CRACK IT.

Go here http://www.simprograms.com/the-sims-3-pa...he-sims-3/ and download ALL of the patches starting at the very bottom of the page. The version you should have is 1.0.631.00002. If you have 1.0.632.00002 you didn?t listen and installed the patch given in the torrent. Start over from the beginning. If you have the correct version, update to Sims3_1.2.7.00002 by clicking the download here link next to it. Run the file when prompted and the Game Launcher should open up and begin the update. Do this with the rest of the patches given one by one. The next one would be 1.3.24 then 1.4.6 and so on. You choose all of the patches that end with 2. 

After you have all of the patches up to 1.12.7 STILL DON?T CRACK OR PLAY THE GAME. Go ahead and upload the World Adventures RELOADED torrent. Open the file and extract the first RAR file(which is an .iso) to your desktop. Mount the image (on your desktop) to daemon tools and autorun. Install the game and when it asks for a keygen, open up my computer, click BD-ROM Drive (F. NOTE: Sims3 should be mounted in Device 0 AND Sims WA(SimsEP01) should be mounted in device 1 at the same time for this to work. Open the Crack folder and click rld-s3wk.exe. This will run the keygen. Type in the key and complete the install. DO NOT CRACK OR RUN THE GAME.

,Stack8907,2010-10-02T21:33Z,"For those who are having trouble try the following:

1.) Completely uninstall World Adventures & The Sims 3 both.

2.) Reinstall The Sims 3 (do not install the EA Download Manager & do not patch or crack.) Use the keygen provided

3.) Do not open The Sims 3, Next install World adventures. It will say ""The Sims 3 must be updated in order to install Sims 3."" Click yes to update. Once updated, the install will proceed. (do not install EA download manager. again) use the serial code:

2PXF-EYDN-L3CH-AL3A-MRLD
or
F33K-HVX5-8KR2-E8KP-6RLD

4.) Do not open World Adventures. Go to the crack directory on this iso and copy/paste into the C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin directory (there is another bin folder inside of the first bin folder but do not put the crack files in this one.)

5.) Right click the TSEP01 file that you just copied into the \bin directory and select ""Send to - Desktop(Create Shortcut)"" Use this file to start the game. You can rename the file if you like.

Restart computer......
You must patch you're base game to 1.7.9
first install the 1.2-1.3-1.4-1.6-1.7.9
You can find the patch at Simprogram, remember don't crack it.......
Install The Sims 3 WA and then crack TS3 WA don't crack TS3 base game......
Play it.....

,lilkimmy2468,2011-03-14T03:17Z,"@Stack8907 (comment on pg. 14)
I have followed all of your steps exactly in fully uninstalling and reinstalling  both The Sims 3 and The Sims 3 World Adventures and everything else.

The only thing I did differently was that when I placed the 'TSEP01' shortcut on the desktop and tried to click it I had to update the game again or it wouldn't play. I didn't remove The already installed EA Download Manager (which I used to update the second time) and have come across the same problem where the game starts and loads and when I get to the game screen (where I pick out a saved game or new game and try to play it) and I get the message ""We are unable to verify that your disc is a valid copy of The Sims 3 World Adventures. Please contact customer service.""

So does this mean that I have to follow your steps again and uninstall the EA Download Manager as well? If so do I download it after the crack and all of it is done or not?"

1)Install Sims 3, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE EA DOWNLOAD MANAGER, AND DO NOT UPDATE VIA DL MANAGER. GO TO SIMPROGRAMS AND DOWNLOAD EACH UPDATE INDIVIDUAL ALL THE WAY FROM 1.2 - 1.3 - 1.4 - 1.6 - 1.7.9 AND THEN PROCEED TO CHAGE REGISTRY OF SIMS 3 WHICH IS EXPLAINED BELOW!!!:
IF you are getting the error message before the install wiz even starts stating the game copy is not within the same region you will need to edit your registry for win7 users go to run and type in regedit and go into HKEYLOCALMAHCINE - SOFTWARE - WOW6432NODE - SIMS - SIMS3 - Proceed to edit the file type labled ""SKU"">double click and change the value to ""2"". That should get rid of any regional code error some are getting.
2)Install World Adventures.
2)Install Ambitions, WHEN IT ASKS TO UPDATE, DO IT!
3)Install Late Night, WHEN IT ASKS TO UPDATE, DO IT!
As for any other errors I'm not sure! If anything it's most likely a problem with your hard drive or video card.

Hope this helps!"

Steps needed to get these games to work.
*I used Razors Sims 3
*Unzip the file
*mount and install the original file (the .iso)

You will need to install every patch that's listed under worldwide ""PC"".  your current version after installing the sims 3 razor torrent is 1.0631...... so if you look carefully you don't have to download all 20+ patches. If you look and read carefully it says download patch ""previous version"" TO ""new current version""... (if you don't get this then your on your own or just download each patch seperately.) You should eventually have the current version to 1.22."".....""
*after each patch for sims 3 is downloaded go to gamecopyworld and download the crack similar to the patch update.
*once you unzip the downloaded file from gamecopyworld, you will have to copy and replace the two files ""tslhost.dll"" and the ""crack"" ( I think it's called ""TS3W"")  to the the original installed game. I.E. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin"" (mines x86 my friend was just program files.) 
*test and see if the game works completely, if not then you did it wrong, re-read and carefully do everything over again."
,cza247,2011-06-17T17:51Z,"Installing the Expantion etc.
*mount and install
*use keygen, or find key
*DO NOT INSTALL EA DOWNLOAD MANAGER

download and install the patches manually again 
*then go to gamecopyworld and download and install. the crack similar to your patch update.
*replace the crack and .dll file to the game bin.

,Solracx,2011-08-19T06:53Z,"For anyone wondering just like me, the installer automatically was in English, to change that you need to edit and add a line to the setup.ini file in the ISO. To do it you will need an iso image editor like MagicISO or similar software, here's how:

1. Unmount the iso if it's mounted.
2. Open the iso with an ISO image editor (ex. MagicISO).
3. Once open look for the setup.ini file.
4. I advise making a backup of it just in case (rename it to setup_.ini or copy to another location).
5. Copy setup.ini to your Desktop for easy access and open it with Notepad.
6. After [Startup] press Enter to jump a line and add this following text line without the quotation marks:  ""EnableLangDlg=Y""
7. Save the file and close it.
8. Again with the ISO image editor (ex MagicISO) delete the setup.ini from the iso image and replace it with your edited one from the Desktop.
9. Finally click on Save in the ISO image editor to save the changes made to the iso image.
10. Enjoy multilanguages!"

You can Install World Adventures if you have town life. They are completly different packages. Town Life is a Stuff Pack and World Adventures is an Expansion Pack.

And those who have problemes with cracking or updating if you have the original TSW3.exe and the xxx.dll (sorry don't rember) just put it back in the Sims 3 / game / bin dir, install the WA start the TS3 Launcher click on update at the bottom than apply the crack again on the TS3 base game.
And if Expansion packs works as the Stuff Packs (sorry I have no Expansion Pack Installed) than you don't need to crack WA becouse the base game crack kills the cd authorisaton If they work different than simply apply the crack provided in the iso."
,Piszi,2011-09-13T16:45Z,"Ok Guys, I tested it. 
If you have the latest version of Sims 3 which is 1.24.3.xx for Windows than you don't have to crack the Expansion and Stuff Packs you only need to crack the base game with the latest crack. I advise to update all stuff and Expansions with the Sims 3 Launcher before you apply the crack on the base game and always make a copy of your original uncracked TSW3.exe and TSLHost.dll to be able to receive updates in the future.

Notice:
But if you have an Original Copy of Sims 3 base game than you have to crack Packs becouse the authorisation will fail."

I think it is an ISO file. You don't need to unRAR it. Install Daemon tools it will create for you a virtual cd/dvd/bluRay drive than mount the iso file in to that drive and thats it. 
Or if you have a Full Nero MM Suit it has an image drive which is the same thing as Daemon tools.
Or you can unRAR it with winRAR to a folder and than run the exe
Oh I see it is cut in 54 rar files first you have to unRAR them by selecting the r.00 or .rar one than right click and extract here.
Hope this helps."

,A.Y.R.E.N,2011-10-27T16:05Z,"Now, this one is a hell of frustration to get to work, I must admit!

BUT after hours and hours of messing around with it, I figured out how to get it to work.

On page 7, Matthew posted a comment: ""mine works perfectly...

Here is What i did:

Reinstall Sims 3

Then Directly install world adventures, i didnt crack it, or patch it, clean install of Sims 3""

And this is actually what helped me A LOT!

1. Install the Sims 3 (after you're done with the installation - DO NOT crack, patch or update it! Don't do anything at all with it.) Sidenote: you don't have to have a freaking MAXSPEED version of the sims 3. I have 'The Sims 3 v1.27 patch crack + store items [Hirya]' version.

2. Install 'The Sims 3 World Adventures-RELOADED'. During the installation of this expansion, it will ask you to update The Sims 3. Click 'yes', it will update your game and you should have no problem at all. Then, continue installing WA.

3. When you're done installing it, CRACK it. And crack WA only, DO NOT do anything with your base game.

4. Enter the game through the TS3EP01.exe (you can send it to your desktop to create a shortcut, too if you want).

5. You should be able to play!

This worked for me. I was also one of these people who got the 'disk authorization failure' error all the time. But when I installed everything this way, it worked like a charm and there were no errors at all.

Also, if there are any other expansions you would like to install - follow these steps as well. Just like when installing the WA expansion.
And I'm telling you, you don't have to do anything with your base game once it's installed (no cracking, patching, updating)! Whenever you're installing whatever expansions, use the method you used with WA (:

I installed WA, Late Night and Ambitions this way and everything's working alright so far.

I installed the sims 3 basic from razor1911...played it for a while then downloaded the sims 3 world adventure from here.

Now when I was installing it, it was asking me to update the sims3 but I could not update it. so I followed the below proceedure:-

1.) Completely uninstall World Adventures & The Sims 3 both.

2.) Reinstall The Sims 3 (do not install the EA Download Manager & do 

not patch or crack.) Use the keygen provided

3.) Do not open The Sims 3, Next install World adventures. It will say 

""The Sims 3 must be updated in order to install Sims 3."" Click yes to 

update. Once updated, the install will proceed. (do not install EA 

download manager. again) use the serial code:

2PXF-EYDN-L3CH-AL3A-MRLD
or
F33K-HVX5-8KR2-E8KP-6RLD

4.) Do not open World Adventures. Go to the crack directory on this 

iso and copy/paste into the C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The 

Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin directory (there is another bin 

folder inside of the first bin folder but do not put the crack files 

in this one.)

5.) Right click the TSEP01 file that you just copied into the \bin 

directory and select ""Send to - Desktop(Create Shortcut)"" Use this 

file to start the game. You can rename the file if you like.

It worked fine but when I travel and come back then the game refuses to save. It sayes error 16!! kindly let me know what should be done..."

The crack for the expansion pack is in the iso itself, you have to go to daemon and edit the file to see the special folders such as the helpspage and the crack folder. Definitely the hardest game I have ever cracked and I have Battlefield 3, FEAR, MIRRORS EDGE, under my cracked resume ahahaha."

pleeeaaassseee
help!"
,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:46Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!

,xSanguinex,2012-05-23T02:00Z,Won't let me install due to a regional code error. I'm from Canada...
,xSanguinex,2012-05-23T02:03Z,Figured it out. Changed the Sims 3 regional code setting to 2
,aperson101,2012-05-24T19:32Z,"Can't install due to REGIONAL CODE ERROR! Help! I'm in the USA. I've got a retail version of the base game, and I've pirated Showtime, Late Night, Outdoor Living Stuff, Ambitions, and Pets, and they all work perfectly fine. But it won't even let me install this, due to a regional code error! How do I fix this?"
,BumbleBee25,2012-06-02T13:40Z,"I read through the while thread and I see a number of people have posted how to change the regional code to 2 or 7. I did that via the Regedit and the game still won't run/load due to the same error...? Any other suggestions?

I also tried to change the default.ini in programme files, as was suggested, but my pc won't let me save the change for some unknown reason. 

The problem is I bought this game legit at a retail store and had the same problem. I don't understand why these suggestions aren't working for me when they worked for others...?"

1. Go to RUN.
2. Type in regedit.
3. it will come up so click it.
4. Then go to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE.
5. Go down to SOFTWARE and open it.
6. Go down to Wow6432Node. Open it.
7. Then find classes and open it and then find Sims( the file not the game) and open it.
8. Then open The Sims 3 (not the game, the file!).
9. You will see a file called SKU. Open it.
10. Then type 7 in the Value Data space. "
,lawyer123,2012-07-20T21:19Z,"Apparently because there's some computer illiterates here I am going to write a basic installation guide.

Basic: must have Sims 3 base installed(legal/pirated doesn't matter)

must have DAEMON tools or similar mounting software.

IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST ADD ON:

You must crack it, this involves an extra step in the installation. Simply follow the instructions.
(note, update when asked, it can't hurt)
1: install and unrar.
2. right click the ISO file, and hover the mouse over, open with....select daemon tools.
3. Use keygen for the serial.
4. Install.
5. Drag the crack folders to the SIMS 3, not the world adventures bin folder, then run the game through the WORLD ADVENTURES exe., not the sims 3 Exe, you will now run all future add ons/SIMS 3 through the world adventures exe.

IF THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST ADD ON:

Easy, follow steps 1-4 above, then run the exe. of your first add on. World adventures should be loaded there.

Region errors I believe are covered in comments below. If it says write error, not enough space, etc...You are a computer braindead and should proceed to go back under your rock.*

*Clear out your harddrive of your p0rn, random bu11sh1t errata..etc.

"
,lawyer123,2012-07-20T21:22Z,"If you do not do the above you will get a disc authentication failure, which is essentially EA catching you pirating."
