,ft1pp,2009-11-18T21:39Z,"HELP!!!! MAN SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!!! I TRYED ALL MP CRACKS AND WHEN I START MP AND WHEN I SEARCH SERVERS, COMPUTER CAN SEE PLAYERS BUT I CANT JOIN IN ANY SERVER (my comp FIND 15 GOOD GAMES) HELP PLEASE!!!!"
,NanoEntity,2009-11-19T18:52Z,"You can only find players that have same version as you.
So in other words you can only play with people that have the cracked version.

Retail players already updated there MW2 version, so your kicked out of that pool of people to find peers to connect.

Also there is a Ping Search besides the MW2 version match.

So the game Will Search for Peers with 1.0.159 + Ping under 100ms or so to connect out of the 5000+ games being hosted lol

So thats why it will take over 5-10min to find a game.

Most people play Ground War/ Mosh Pit, pretty much instant MATCH if you look for a game.

Just tested it on v 1.0.159 and I can find Games/MATCh;s fine in Ground War/Mosh Pit, and Play.
I suggest you go to gamecopyworld and download lv 70 profile editor so it unlocked all the game types. "
,razbija,2009-11-26T17:17Z,"I am all done like you wrote the tutorial, all I did but I get into the game and find a type of game and then wait and wait writes ""We must found 7 players and then search for a long time and could not find players please help"

,nexo33,2009-12-02T03:22Z,"@NanoEntity: I've the same problem like most of the people here: when i enter in the lobbies it search for other players but never find one. I wait for more than 10 min and nothing happens. I also went to 'GameCopyWorld' but i don't know exactly what should I download to solve the problem, indeed I've found several things like cheat ocdes but no way to find level 70 profil editor [(only: EASY ACCOUNT - LEVEL 70 HACK) is that what you mean?]. Can you maybe paste the direct link here pls. I had also a look in 'Teknogods' but they don't have the solution yet. If someone can help pls......

@vladdis: what do you mean with a patch to 1.0.166? how to do that?

Thx ppl "
