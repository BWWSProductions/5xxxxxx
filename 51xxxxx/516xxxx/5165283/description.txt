SYNOPSIS: Silent as a painting, the movie shows us day-dreamer Hermie 
and his friends Oscy and Benjie spending the summer of '42 on 
an US island with their parents - rather unaffected by WWII. 
While Oscy's main worries are the when and how of getting laid, 
Hermie honestly falls in love with the older Dorothy, who's 
married to an army pilot. When her husband returns to the front, 
Hermie shyly approaches her. (Pay attention to the famous, mythical, 
mythological sound score by Michel Legrand, that you all know for sure).
