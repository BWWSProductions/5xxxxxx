Please seed this absolute classic directed by David Lean.  Think about it, how many bad movies did David Lean direct?  "
,thermangroat,2010-04-13T17:51Z,I downloaded this Ok. It plays on my PC but when I burn it to a DVD using BurnAware  it won't play on my DVD player. How can I fix this ?

The download is in a 'Video TS' folder, and already in a DVD compatible file format to start with - In Nero, you need to go in expert mode and under 'video' choose 'Burn DVD-video files' and this will show you a structure on the left 'Audio TS' and 'Video TS'

Add the contents of the folder in the same 'Video TS' folder, do not include the folder, put all the files within and burn away!"
