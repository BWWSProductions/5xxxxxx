This is a complete copy of the company "FIREPOWER" main server computer, 6 years of records. These people ripped off Australian people for around $100,000,000, maybe a lot more. How much they took from other countries is not known yet.

The product they tried to sell the whole planet is simply a mothball containing a chemical called nepthaline

This chemical stoppes your engine smoke for a while but destroys it eventually and they knew this.

I am sick of looking at it so here it is for all you private investigators around the world to have a go at.
