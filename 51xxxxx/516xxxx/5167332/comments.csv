Also, its very annoying that you try to advertise your site in the mp3 file information.  Being obnoxious is not a good way to turn someone on to a site."

See dude its you kinda people who always comment shit and always comment this is best that is but always download free music never buy any album .. I don't advertise i just put my tags so that people may know who's rip it is . Got it now !
