From Wikipedia:

Remain in Light is the fourth studio album by American New Wave band
Talking Heads, released on 8 October 1980 on Sire Records. It was recorded
at locations in the Bahamas and the United States between July and August 1980
and was produced by the quartet's long-time collaborator Brian Eno. The album
entered the Billboard 200 in the US at number 19 and peaked at number 21 on
the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Remain in Light: 
"Once in a Lifetime" and "Houses in Motion". The record was certified Gold
in the US and in Canada during the 1980s.  The members of Talking Heads wanted
to make an album that dispelled notions of frontman and chief lyricist 
David Byrne leading a back-up band. They decided to experiment with African
polyrhythms and, with Eno, recorded the instrumental tracks as a series of 
samples and loops, a novel idea at the time. Additional musicians were frequently
used throughout the studio sessions. The lyric writing process slowed Remain in
Light's progress, but was concluded after Byrne drew inspiration from academic
literature on Africa. The artwork was crafted with the help of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's computers and designing company M&Co.. Following the 
album's completion, Talking Heads expanded to nine members for promotional concerts.  Remain in Light was widely acclaimed by critics. Praise centred on its 
cohesive merging of disparate genres and sonic experimentation.  The record 
has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s 
and the best albums of all time. It is often considered Talking Heads' magnum opus.
