,akaskypants,2010-02-26T20:55Z,Dude. This is the best collection I've ever found. I need more seeders though so PLEASE seed for me. I am in love with Tegan and Sara and I need the music videos. :) thanks again.
,Lazajam,2010-06-27T09:56Z,"It is past 2 AM and I'm doing my weekly Tegan and Sara creeping and THIS IS WHAT I FIND?! After this incredible collection is done downloading I'm thinking about pulling a Henry David Thoreau with a small radio and this monstrous playlist on repeat. I do have to say -- the Orange Demo IS in circulation.. as far as I know it is two demos: Proud and This is Everything. Find it with our friends at [dot] ca!

This is amazing and I will most likely seed this until my processor fails.

And I should note - the Plunk songs are on the ""Play Day"" EP, and ""Under Feet Like Ours"" was in fact not recorded by Tegan and Sara, but Sara and Tegan.

AND - a cover of a Steel Train song done by Tegan and Sara is coming out on the 29th of June (2010)."

After a more comprehensive analysis, I have discovered that there are a few things missing. The three songs from The Bridge School Collections (Walking With a Ghost, When I Get Up, You Wouldn't Like Me), the music videos for Alligator, Speak Slow, and Feel It In My Bones, the acoustic version of Feel It In My Bones, and finally, all of those crazy Alligator remixes.
If we want to get nitpicky -- their DVD ""It's Not Fun, Don't Do It"" is not included. And I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning but a song that no one has ever heard entitled Left Me To Wonder is also not included -- but I don't think anyone has ever expected that.
This was a great torrent! But lets try and support Tegan and Sara by buying their music too! "
