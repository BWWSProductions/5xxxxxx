,Arg_the_pirate,2010-01-12T05:05Z,How do you use the .sub files with this movie? Are you expecting everyone to just know how to do this?
,Arg_the_pirate,2010-01-12T05:17Z,"Got it working. Install a program called VobSub, have those subtitle files in the same directory as movie, and play. Shows automatically.

Too bad it doesn't matter, because the supposed English subs are actually Japanese ones, as meluckee reported."

These work. Download them. Kudos to meluckee."
