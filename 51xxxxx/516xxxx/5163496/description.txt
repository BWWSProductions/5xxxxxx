"You Know Me" will be the second official single from British singer-songwriter Robbie Williams's eighth studio album Reality Killed the Video Star. The song will be released on 4 December 2009.

Ken Bruce premiered the song on BBC Radio 2 during his show.

The music video for the song was released on Williams' official website on 6th November 2009. In the video Robbie Williams falls asleep and wakes up dressed as a rabbit in a waistcoat, exploring a fantasy world that seems to be based on Alice in Wonderland. After he finishes exploring the fantasy world he dances with a group of women also dressed as rabbits however this time he is wearing make-up to complete his transformation.

The video was directed by Phil & Olly (aka Diamond Dogs) and shot on a specially built set at Shepperton Studios over 2 days.
