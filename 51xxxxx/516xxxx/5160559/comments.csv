,unpocoloco,2010-01-04T21:32Z,"My last comment was for the older HDTV rip without added Russian speech that for some reason dont show up on piratebay although it does on isohunt.. have no idea about the quality of the one with added russian but i guess the video is untouched being a MKV, if so, its still the best image ive seen ever."
