Hoping to inspire someone to upload the 2011 v6.92 image! :)"
,andvil01,2011-01-07T04:31Z,"Leetnub, I've heard its hard to copy this on a DL disc.  Did you get it to work in your vehicle?"
,Leetnub,2011-01-07T04:39Z,"I'm out of DL discs at the moment, so I won't know for another day or two.  I'm using a burned 6.62 at the moment with no issues. (Singapore-made Verbatim disc burned at 2.4x)"
,jickpics,2011-01-07T09:07Z,anyone news on this working yet? i heard you cant use your nav unless you revert back to a original disk if it doesnt work.
,Leetnub,2011-01-07T22:01Z,If it doesn't work you can always revert back to your old disc via this method: http://www.civinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=How_to_revert_to_a_previous_satnav_version
,wastedvampire,2011-01-08T01:26Z,"Downloaded after a few days. Toasted into Verbatim DVD+R DL 2.4x. Loaded into vehicle, software downloaded but having dvd disc error upon start-up. Will be reverting to old version. :(  "
,wastedvampire,2011-01-08T14:54Z,"After careful prying, I found out that the head unit recognizes the version but the serial number that was recognized was still of the old version. I think this must be the reason why it's saying disc error on the satnav system. But I might be wrong."
,johnniknox,2011-02-06T04:11Z,i'm having the same problem your running into with the map download. the head unit downloads the map fine but won't load after the reboot. do you know of a way to fix this serial number issue?
,bfb052,2011-03-10T03:04Z,"Many thanks to Leetnub, I just bought a 2007 CRV few days ago, downloaded this DVD from another site, ran into ""disc error"".  I was about to take it into Honda dealership as the GPS suggested (and looked like a fool) when I saw your post on revert method.
Once again, many many thanks to Leetnub"

,nite82hawk,2011-04-05T18:26Z,So did anyone get this to work yet??  I tried it and everything looked liked it installed ok then got an error message.
,irie_cat,2011-04-05T22:01Z,"I have the same problem. It proceeds to load then error message. I am downloading 6.62A right now, hope it works."
,Cohan,2011-07-25T23:02Z,Which part of the world does this map cover?
