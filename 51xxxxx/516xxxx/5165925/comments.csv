I'm Damjan from Serbia. I am new in this... ""world"" if I can call it that way :D

I've been lately downloading (and seeding of course :D) Frank Zappa from torrent that you've uploaded and I am searching for more TQMP music. Can you give me some web sites where I can find more music in .flac format? On TPB there isn't much (or I don't know to search 0.o).

Please, anyone, email me @ damjan992@gmail.com

THANKS !!!"

,damjan_bgd,2009-11-18T00:45Z,"Yes, i know that. I can find my self around :D :D :D It's just that I encounter so many bad files like music in 128kbps. When I found out 'bout .flac 2-3 weeks ago I was so... happy :D :D :D

I am now only searching for music in .flac or buying original CD-s. Now, when I listen .mp3 even @ 320kbps I see what rubish it is compared to .flac. I realy need quality music. I will help TQMP with their project soon (my CD-DVD ROM has thorn apart :D).

Do you (TQMP) have any web site or forum ?

Sorry for bad English..."

Damjan there is no website for TQMP now. The TQMP project was started by Breezin you can contact him for any details. Just search ""breezin"" or TQMP and find a torent he uped, you'll find his contact in every torrent description.
