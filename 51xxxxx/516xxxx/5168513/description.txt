This is John Coleman's explosive book We Fight for Oil - A History of US Petroleum Wars (2008) which provides a clear, concise and easily understood guide to the long running conflicts America has with nations having crude oil deposits all around the world. A history of U.S. oil wars is a work-in-progress which began when US President Wilson landed U.S. troops at Tampico. The history of U.S. involvement in Persia (now Iran) and Mesopotamia (now Iraq) centered round the quest for oil and control of it as a vitally-needed natural resource. With this in mind, the reader may well come to the conclusion that news from U.S. (and British) sources has to be taken with a large grain of salt. Oil diplomacy is governed by commercial and eventually, military considerations. Thus every U.S. President since Woodrow Wilson has formulated U.S. foreign policy to take care of oil interests. Therefore this book affects or should affect everyone, because modern international power is economic, just as all wars are economic in origin. Remember this the next time American sons and daughters are called to fight for their country. If Iraq did not contain huge oil resources, would the U.S. be bogged down in that country today? Fear of domestic shortages of oil seems to be the driving force at play. American strife over foreign resources has become the major factor in international affairs. We Fight for Oil examines these issues in detail and exposes major players that operate behind the scenes and constantly push Americans in endless wars - all in the name of oil and new world order. 225 pages. A must read for everyone.
