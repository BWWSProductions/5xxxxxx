Black Market Militia's self titled debut was one of the hottest joints to drop in 2005. The group consists of Killah Priest, Tragedy Khadafi, Timbo King, Hell Razah and the man responsible for putting it all togetherâ€¦ William Cooper. Cooper now continues the Black Market Militia legacy with the release of his long anticipated solo album Beware The Pale Horse. Though this is Cooper's debut, the list of guests is long and solid with verbals from Kool G. Rap, Ill Bill, Nature, Blue Raspberry, 9th Prince and more. Black Market Militia fans won't be disappointed as Killah Priest and Hell Razah lend a hand with Cooper handling the bulk of the production. This is no one trick pony, Beware The Pale Horse picks up right where Black Market Militia left off.
