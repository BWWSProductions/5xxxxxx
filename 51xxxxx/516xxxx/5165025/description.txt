The Guard S03E04 â€“ Boom

A fisherman hooks a human leg, which brings Davidâ€™s ex back to town; Tina goes partying which leads to a bad situation.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The broadcast was HD but because of my conversion method, it is not as high quality as scene HD releases so I have labeled it as WS instead of HDTV.

This episode aired Nov 13, 2009 on Global.
