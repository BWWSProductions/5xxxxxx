,griiid,2009-11-15T17:36Z,finally!
,TheSpenner,2009-11-15T23:56Z,"The alien subs are NOT hardcoded.

YES this does have the alien-only subs on subs track 4 though.

Nice! Thanks. "
,TheSpenner,2009-11-16T00:37Z,"^^^ whoops ^^^ I'm mistaken, there is NOT an alien-only subtitle track, I got the alien-only subs separately from allsubs.com"
,sparrow6666666,2009-11-16T10:31Z,"Thanks,does anyone know if any other HD torrents out there have the alien subs hardcoded in english?"
,matthensley,2009-11-16T12:44Z,"its all subs.org       fuck wit all subs.com is a fukin car hi fi modding site, hi how would you use them cunt/."
[V],GoodFilms,2009-11-16T18:24Z,why do you want hardsubs?
,baretoof,2009-11-16T19:37Z,"the only problem with this is that alien subs are not hard.

you see people like me that use windows media center to stream to 360, cant have subs...

I usually dont care... but in this movie, if u dont have subs for aliens, then its a big waste of time!"
,griiid,2009-11-16T20:06Z,"so how does it works, can you get the alien subs on this or no in this file?
thanks"
,matthensley,2009-11-16T20:18Z,"hardon subs produced by drunk uploading motherfukin aliens,wicked ye i wat hard coded subs too ther wicked"
,matthensley,2009-11-16T20:21Z,"has this got fukin subs or what is a 8gig dload just to find out, lets get info about the torrents down"
,sparrow6666666,2009-11-16T21:10Z,As baretoof has said us 360 users cant watch subs unless there burnt in which is a huge pain as its rare to find those torrents. Shame because there are a lot of good foreign films out there. Anyway i see there are a lot of torrents around now but anyone have any idea if one of them has subs burnt in.
,baretoof,2009-11-17T00:55Z,"sparrow... i found this one with alien subs burned in the video... however its avi & only around 3.3 gigs..so its not a 1080p 8+gig :)

it should do though..

,TheSpenner,2009-11-17T03:07Z,"HARDCODING SUBS: Download mkv2vob (http://www.mkv2vob.com/showthread.php?tid=1), a simple GUI that will hardcode the subs, creating an MPEG file.
1) Browse to select the MKV file for Source.
2) Configuration tab - select Always Encode Subtitles. Also helps to select Overscan Compensation - which moves the subtitles a little above the bottom margin of the screen.
2a) If the subs are from a separate file (ie downloaded from allsubs.org or elsewhere), have it in the same folder as FILE.mkv, named FILE.srt, and select ""Load subtitles from file"" and it'll be used.
3) Back on the Add File tab, click Add File to start the process."
,sparrow6666666,2009-11-17T03:53Z,"Cheers Baretooth  but was hoping for at least 720p.  TheSpenner, unfortunately harcoding the subs means recoding the video and my aging system would take the whole day and most likely not  be up to the task.Thx anyway guys."

,daz87uk,2010-02-20T13:27Z,You only need VlC to play MKV unless you have a crap graphics card that doesnt play HD. If you have the crap graphics card option and codecs dont work and you still get lag.... your pc is crap. simple answer.
,kithylin,2010-02-22T05:00Z,"@ Zoran123: It's not that your ""monitor"" is slow, 1080p movies take ALOT of processor, 3ghz dual core or higher. You don't have enough cpu, and/or your system isn't configured properly to offload part of the rendering to your video card.

google ""offload x264 media player classic"" try that."
,superman101,2010-03-02T22:12Z,"The alien/African subs are not included in this torrent. Go here:

http://subscene.com/s.aspx?subtitle=District+9+720p+BluRay+x264-METiS-English-NonEnglishPartsOnly&includeall=true&includeall=true

The third file on the list is the subtitle file you need; download it and unzip it then tell your video player to load that subtitle file. You now have the alien and African subtitles.

It's called a Blu-Ray disc. That's why they were invented, not because they give better video but because they can store more space which translates to more pixel information which ultimately results in better video. If you had a Blu-Ray disk you would have 25 to 50 gigs of space."
