Episode 140 - Masking with the Vanishing Point Filter
Sunday, August 23rd, 2009 â€“ running time 16:03

Deke McClellan guest hosts to demonstrate gradient masks using the Vanishing Point filter.

*** Last week's project using the Vanishing Point filter
We focus on the sign, "lynda.com/deke" and learn to make the lighting look more realistic rather than flat. Deke uses a white Drop Shadow with the blend mode "Screen" with an Outer Glow.

*** Linear gradient masks
We get a recap of last week's work in the subway scene that used the Vanishing Point filter, and Deke shows us that the job isn't done. We need to use masks to fix the reflection of the wall artwork. In this example, use a linear gradient in your mask. The black area hides parts of your layer, and white invokes opacity.

*** Gradients turned to masks with Vanishing Point
With just a linear gradient, mask still doesn't look like it has the right perspective. Delete the mask we tested with. Therefore, we will apply the masking in Vanishing Point using a separate pre-made gradient image. Create a new layer, then launch the Vanishing Point filter. The existing grids will show, and paste in the gradient image. Drag the gradient to the desired position. Apply the changes, and fill a new layer with black - this will merge with the gradient, and will become the mask.
