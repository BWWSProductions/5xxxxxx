The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady is a 1963 jazz composition and album by bassist and composer Charles Mingus. The piece consists of a single six-part suite performed by an eleven-piece band. An intensely emotional work, it displays Mingus's skills as musician, composer and band leader.

Written as a ballet, the work borrows from Ellingtonian and Latin sources, but creates a unique orchestral style that Mingus called "ethnic folk-dance music".

The orchestrations (described as "one of the greatest achievements [...] by any composer in jazz history" by Allmusic) are rich and multi-layered. Mingus's perfectionism led to extensive use of studio overdubbing techniques.

Track A features the tuba virtuoso Don Butterfield playing a contrabass trombone.

The album features liner notes written by Mingus and his psychotherapist, Dr. Edmund Pollock.
