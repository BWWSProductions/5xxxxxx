A special edition of the album was released with two bonus tracks and a DVD, which included four music videos.

Spektor decided to work with multiple producers on the album. She says she thinks of creating an album like a class so she wanted to have ΓÇ£multiple professorsΓÇ¥. She also felt the multiple producers would allow them not to worry what the single or big hit would be. The most notable producers include David Kahne, who produced her last album Begin To Hope and Jeff Lynne, former member of ELO and The Traveling Wilburys. Although Lynne has an expansive musical background, Spektor did not know of his work when she originally met him.

Far entered the official UK Albums Chart at number 30 It also sold 50,000 copies in its first week, entering the US Billboard 200 number three. In the Canadian Albums Chart, Far debuted at number 16. The album has spent nineteen weeks on the Billboard 200, and currently sits at #198.
