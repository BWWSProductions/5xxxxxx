Amazing band. The songs feature the haunting synthesisers, the strong rhythm guitars and the snappy drumming, all highlights of any decent post punk outfit. What is noticeable is the way the sound changes between sessions, with the last session taking place after the bandâ€™s ill-starred attempt to break into the American market and out of its narrow college radio scene. The former prominence of the guitars has been muted and the synthesisers dominate. They had morphed into not the same band as had stunned me in 1981 with â€œRemembrance dayâ€.
