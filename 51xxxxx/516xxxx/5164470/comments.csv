,keddyfish,2009-11-18T04:45Z,"Um somedouche, can please try to stick to your own torrents, and not spam mine, thank you."
,keddyfish,2009-11-18T14:37Z,"Ok, I have changed the torrent details to your liking. Now stop spamming my torrents. I have already contacted ThePirateBay and they have agreed to suspend your account, if you spam my torrents again. In other words, your IP has been logged."
,keddyfish,2009-11-18T14:40Z,"And by suspend I mean all your anonymous torrents will go down the drain, including this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5163632/South.Park.S13E13.720p.Dances_with_Smurfs-CtrlHD_(uncensored)"
