The english subs for the non english parts are hard coded while the full english subs are not. So just turn off the soft subs and you are left with only non english parts with english subs.

Anyone know if there is a PROPER out there somewhere with a higher bitrate? This one is rather low. I was hoping for a 7.95GB 720p rip to get the bitrate up."
