In an easy to follow, step-by-step manner Jake does an excellent job of demonstrating the correct procedure for rebuilding the Type 4 engine.

You will be taken through the complete teardown, where Jake will show you the location of those hard to find screws and nuts.

Jake makes the job easy by putting each procedure in the proper order.

During the reassembly Jake points out the many differences in the type 4 to the type 1 motors and draws your attention to details that could otherwise be overlooked.

Jake emphasizes the need for cleanliness and proper torque of all parts.
