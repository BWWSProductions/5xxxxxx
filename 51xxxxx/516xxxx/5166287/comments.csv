,Verosu,2010-01-26T17:37Z,"Hey guys. Sorry it's taking me forever to get back to you. Currently I've been experiencing hard drive issues, it appears that not just one, but both of my external drives are dying. I keep getting I/O errors on one and the other just seems to choose when and for how long it with stay detected for.

So, for now I don't really have much to go on but it if you keep making a list of requests I'll hopefully be able to get to them soon."
