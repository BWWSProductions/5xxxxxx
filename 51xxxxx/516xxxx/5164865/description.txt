Hello,

I am looking for some who owns an AppleTV unit to do some testing.

I am also looking for someone who has purchased an actual HD movie from iTunes in 1280x720 format.  I need to know the specs of this movie.  If you own such a movie can you run mediainfo on it and paste the text results of it?

Thanks,

-HR
