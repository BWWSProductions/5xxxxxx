,chillin69x,2009-11-15T00:26Z,"yeah, how about we either read the posting or click the number of files, and check for the words ""serial.txt""

Yes, serial included. And works!
Much praise to you"
,wadkcaj,2009-11-15T00:46Z,Thnx pal!!! Serial works!
,jimohio,2009-11-15T04:05Z,"Just download the trial version from Parallels web site, install, and then add the following serial:

GC956T-XQN1ZM-MG0JC0-3B3JRT-XZTW2T is working and shows fully activated with the latest copy of Parallels Desktop 5.0 for Mac from the official website."

Don't post serials, you stupid noob.  You ruin them."
,LeLoupNoir,2009-11-15T06:58Z,Thanks !!! It's multilanguage ?
,zogulusnig,2009-11-15T08:03Z,"I had a slight problem after upgrading from Parallels 4 to 5:  My Windows XP SP3 Bootcamp partition would not boot up.  It would only go to a Blue Screen of Death noting that I had encountered a ""IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL"" error.

After digging up the official fix for the problem at the Parallels website (link below), I followed their instructions and all was fixed.  You just need to start your virtual machine using a single processor the first time, let it install the new Tools data, then you can revert back to your normal setting for every subsequent boot.

,sundazed,2009-11-15T18:48Z,@jimohio: you are a fucking moron. Don't post serials here. Fuck off and have your brains examined.
,albinoz,2009-11-15T19:49Z,"Works licence, but not working parralles?
Have blue screen of death because of incompatibility with bootcamp snow leopard drivers? I do not recommande for v4 users on MacPro? Works on Core2Duo with  single Pross for debug , but not on macpro? Beleve me, I was test this alll this afternoon?"
,zogulusnig,2009-11-15T19:57Z,"ALBINOZ - See my comment above.  I had the same problem, and was about to my wits' end before I thought to Google the exact phrase of the BSoD error along with 'Parallels 5'.

The link above to the Parallels knowledge base article SOLVES this problem conclusively.  Also, the basic instructions are insluded in my post."
,zogulusnig,2009-11-15T20:01Z,"For reference, my testing machine was an eight-core 2.8GHz Mac Pro desktop, running OS 10.6.2.

After starting the first time using only one processor, and installing the Parallels Tools onto the Bootcamp partition, I was able to quit Parallels, and restart it after changing the configuration back to the full 8 processors without the BSoD appearing.

Everything works flawlessly now."

The answer to your question is within your question. INSERT A CD TO INSTALL WINDOWS. If you dont know what that means, then kill yourself.

If you have any idea what that means, but dont have a copy of windows, then take yer arse to this link and download one of your choosing!
