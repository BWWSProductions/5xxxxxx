,roges,2009-11-13T10:37Z,"What delightful chit-chat we have attached to this torrent. VTV has gone to the effort to acquire this television episode and make it available to us, (if it turns out to be genuine {0} ) we should politely offer our thanks. {1}
 There can be many reason that determine the rate of a torrent, but so far I have been unable to prove that sexual orientation is one of them, (if anything, with the ""Pink Dollar"" homosexuality would lead, on average to a faster download.)

I hope some of this is helpful to someone

{0} As he has a green skull it almost certainly is genuine, so a pre-emptive thank you.
{1} It seems that it is true that you should never argue with fools, as others will no longer be able to tell you apart"

Thanks to the uploader who took the effort to supply those without American TV access with the TV shows they so like."
,Scorpicore,2009-11-13T13:24Z,"Well, there is something ""wrong"" with this torrent. But it is nothing that VTV can do anything about.

Im DLing it at a rather slow rate, but it has to do with me only connecting to north and south american seeders atm.."
