,toblakai,2009-11-13T20:23Z,"Sura 4:34 - Women's Rights in Islam

""Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great. ""

on another note... why do you hide your nick? :)"

,aemalkawi,2011-04-05T22:41Z,"toblakai;

your problem is that you only take the part that fits your point and discard the one that if shown will not support your point, i have 3 things to show,FIRST since quran is in arabic then your translation of sura was somewhat deviated, because if you replace the word (scourge) which is never used in islam even for captives, and put instead (strike slightly) there would be a big difference, I think you changed it in purpose, and actually it is forbidden to hit the women as to cause PAIN, that you will find it in the explanation of sura that Muhammed _peace upon him_ said. because the quran is a type of poetry that Allah sent then it needs an explanation, just like most of poetries of William Shakespeare which can't be understood directly from reading it and then you may misunderstand the poet, "
,aemalkawi,2011-04-05T23:09Z,"SECOND,,,,, as it needs explanation so what is the explanation of (in charge of women), or I mean in charge of them at what????   Men are in charge of women in specific cases only (if you read it in arabic it will be more understandable, because only one word was used in arabic instead of that sentence and I find it to hard to find a replacement), however, Men are in charge of women in directing them to right and in taking care of them _by working and providing them and their kids a good life_ so if you think again you will find that this sentence are an order for (more responsibilities on) MEN instead of women oppression "
,aemalkawi,2011-04-05T23:10Z,"explanation of (made one of them to excel the other), it means the things that found in men that give them different functions and abilities from women,    so what are they????  the strength and capability of working harder and supporting the family and the personality that fits leadership among men, and since I'm a medical trainer then I found that  this was true from two perspectives, 1-in physiology and anatomy it is scientifically proofed that men are more stronger in muscles and bones and that is related to the male hormones such is steroids(testosterone) which many bodybuilders actually used to take it as a to get bigger muscles,,,,,,,, 2- in psychology it is found that male personality are more fitting to leadership, in addition it is found that women personality are more directed toward the love of being taken care of and for example molly coddle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and these facts although does'nt apply to all cases but it is the  rules (85% of people)"
,aemalkawi,2011-04-05T23:29Z,"(because they spend of their property) >>>>>>>> in islam even if woman works and have money it is conserved for her own desires do what ever she wants by them,,,,,, and men are supposed to  provide the family main needs such as food, home, colthes, travel.....etc    , so again this sentence also are a positive point for women's side

but now the next sentence is extremely different in meaning form arabic original text (it is translated in a way that the not the right words where used), so instead of (So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded) the nearer translation for original is (((So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard)))>>>>> so to make the original arabic meaning understood,  (devoutly obedient) means obedient for allah by following islam teaching,  the other part of this sentence means that the righteous women keep and protect what allah asked them to protect in the absence of their men, which include their house dignity and their own dignity as though to protect herself from allowing another man  on to herself in husband's absence, .................................."
,aemalkawi,2011-04-05T23:46Z,"instead of (As for those from whom ye fear rebellion) a more appropriate translation is (But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance) >>>>>> this sentence talks about the women who disobey the husbands in things that is against allah wills (eg. she wants to wear a dignity compromising clothes) or things that can put him in the position of being the female as if he is a slave,,,,,,,and I don't think that any man even non muslim would accept that his women deal with him as if his a boy, and please don't say no because I watched a lot and alot of american and other foreign movies that actually represents your community by the point of view of the author, which means that the author knows that this is unacceptable so he show that response as a normal response in a movie without making that a main event (so it is just a normal response and not an author's own perspective)
"
,aemalkawi,2011-04-06T00:15Z,"next is how to deal with that women IF she prefers to stay with you and you do so,
but the translation (admonish) could mean (warn), but the best word to translate the original arabic is (preach) which means to speak to them politely and advice them by the good words,,,, but if they still persisting on their arrogance then comes the next step which is to keep away from sleeping with them,_BUT NOT banish them, this is a mistranslation_  in order to make them feel guilty,,,,,,,, the final and OPTIONAL and rarely reached _because most people has divorced before this time_  stage is that if noway to correction of mutual respect relationship then you can strike her with something that CAN""T CAUSE PAIN AT ALL in order to show her that I'm still loving you and want you BUT I'm angry and don't want to complete our life this way, so the aim of free of pain striking is showing that I really can't accept that.................... the end of the ayah (((but if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them)))>>>>if they stopped their arrogance and obeyed you by stopping that then never oppress them, ..............."
,aemalkawi,2011-04-06T00:40Z,"and just an important note: these previously describe steps of how to deal with an arrogant women is not a pure orders, they are options allowed, meaning you are allowed to deal this way but you are not obligated

THIRD and final most important thing is that to show you that quran EQUALS BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN here is another sentence from quran Surat Al-Baqarah ayah 228 : ((((((And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them [toward men], according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and leadership].))))) >>>>>> this ayah show that in islam the women have rigths from her man just as equal the rights he has from here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, so after this ayah I think you should have totally understood that women rights is preserved from 1400 years ago and islam never made difference between woman and man except in responsibility which actually is point for woman's side and this responsibility is exchanged for good relationship from woman toward man, thats it

*****I have memorized the whole quran in ARABIC (the original language) and it's explanation as shown by prophet Muhammed_peace upon him_ in order to know if there were any real orders for crime or women oppression and I was totally convinced by the mercy and the morals taught for public unity and morals for maintaining a good relationship between married, and that was the big difference between me and you is that I have tried to understand and read everything not just single part

I wish you find the right road for you

Best regards
Ahmad"
