It is the twilight of mankind, and its fate, along with that of the universe, is destined to change forever!  Set hundreds of years in the future, DC's super-heroes - Tommy Tomorrow and the Planeteers, the Star Rovers, Star Hawkins, and Space Cabbie - are brought together as the key players ina conflict of intergalactic scope.  One of these players is the key to a new dawn... a dawn that means the end for all of mankind! 

This three issue prestige format mini-series written by Howard Chaykin and illustrated by JosÃ© Luis GarcÃ­a-LÃ³pez attempted to bring in all of DC future science/space characters, many originally from the 1950s and 1960s, into one series.  It was another radical revamp of DC characters, including Tommy Tomorrow, Star Rovers, Star Hawkins, Space Ranger, Manhunter 2070 and Space Cabbie.
