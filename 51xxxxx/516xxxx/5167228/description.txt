Day four of the Live Lounge Tour, and we're at Dizzee Rascal's studio in South London.

Dizzee's treasure hunt showed up some very proud items - not least a letter from Archbishop Desmond Tutu inviting him to take part in a new book.

Dizzee perfomed number one singles Holiday and Bonkers, and a cover of Dirty Cash (Money Talks) originally by The Adventures of Stevie V.
