,Pzer0cool,2009-11-16T06:11Z,"Dude, you really need to start using www.lookpic.com for the screenshots. They don't delete pics, and it's basicaly made just for that."
,d_archangel,2009-11-16T09:49Z,"You're the greatest of all encoders, ever. Noone does what you, many still use that shitty old xvid codec. Just one question: how come you put romanian subtitles for all the films you release? I'm from Romania and I'm really glad you do that."
,d_archangel,2009-11-16T09:56Z,And something else: are you a group or just one person? As one person must be petty hard to do all this.
