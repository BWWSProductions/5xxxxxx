Working Crack for Apache Havoc
(At least for me)

Includes three patches:
ahpusa		from FlyBoyF22. Thank You!
e_aph11eallcrk	from eminence, suggested by gp2805183. Thank You guys!
e_ah11dcrk	from eminence.

This is how I did:
1)	If You haven┬┤t done so already, download Apache Havoc from FlyBoyF22
	here: 	http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3949825/Apache_Havoc.
2)	Burn or mount, and Install
3)	Install ahpusa. Game don┬┤t load correctly.
4)	Install e_aph11eallcrk. Game still doesn┬┤t load correctly.
5)	Now the strange part. Place a DVD in your CD/DVD-reader. For some strange
	reason the game will run fine now. The DVD can be ANY DVD (burned,
	original, movie, game, installation, ...) as long as it isn┬┤t empty.
6)	Enjoy!

I used e_aph11eallcrk, but You may need to use e_ah11dcrk instead. Read the release-files included in the zip-files.

N.B. this is only a re-distribution of the patches. I am not the one to thank. And if You get problems with viruses from them I am sorry, but I am not the one to blame either (I didn┬┤t get any problems).

I suggest You also download the sequel Enemy Engaged - RAH-66 Comanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum from Big_dude here: 	http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5142690/Enemy_Engaged_-_RAH-66_Comanche_vs._Ka-52_Hokum_(PC).

Then you also should visit www.eechcentral.com, an information portal for the game with A LOT of great mods.

At www.simhq.com and it┬┤s forum You will find much information.
