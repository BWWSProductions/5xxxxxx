I remember listening to these when I was younger, sure brings back some memories... My PC crashed and when I went to download these again, the torrent was down to 0 seeds.  Finally, there was 1 seed and I was able to get these again.  All I did was add album 50 and change the directory names so you would know what order to listen to the episodes - thank you to the orignal ripper.

Albums 0-15 are from the remastered Gold Audio series - I haven't been able to find the original versions, but the main difference between the two is that parents were complaining about how dumb Harlow Doyle, Private I was, so they made some changes.  They also changed the intro's and outro's a li'l'.

You can hear the latest episodes at Odyssey's homepage, www.whitsend.org - enjoy.
