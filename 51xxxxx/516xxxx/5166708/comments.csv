,ibigfire,2009-11-17T22:51Z,Thank you so much.
,ibigfire,2009-11-18T00:50Z,"If you seed first, I will after. ^_^"
,basiclt,2009-11-22T07:59Z,Can you please seed this?
,zeldaboy,2009-11-25T16:55Z,"Ok, I have all the files on my HD, yet the availablility in my torrent client is only reaching 95.5.

The client seems to think I am missing chunks of a few files--yet when I open them, they play fine.

This is a huge torrent, and I've only uploaded 273 megs so far.  Sorry about that...

I will be seeding the 95.5 percent that the client is accepting until those files available are in the swarm.

I'll seed what I can while I try to figure out why this last .5 doesn't want to seed..."
,zeldaboy,2009-11-25T18:46Z,"ok finally got it seeding at 100% I'll keep seeding it as long as possible.  Check out the Screwtape Letters torrent I put on here too, you'll like it.  After this has more seeds I'll put on some more music too."
,basiclt,2009-12-03T23:20Z,I'm sorry but do you seed for 5 hours and stop?  I haven't had activity on this file in a week and it was only a couple hours.  I'm just trying to get 50.
,ibigfire,2009-12-11T13:53Z,"Please continue to seed.  You seem to be the only source for this torrent and I'm worried that you'll forget about us, or your computer will crash or something, and I'll be stuck at 71.8% forever."
,zeldaboy,2009-12-26T11:34Z,I'm seeding again there's 2 other seeds now I lost my connection for a little while.
,JoshuaPtr,2010-01-24T02:07Z,Hey thank you for having this torrent. I would really appreciate if someone could seed this for me just for a little bit. I'm at 99.8% with 0 seeders. Thank you.
,JoshuaPtr,2010-01-24T02:10Z,I'll be happy to seed this if anyone can help me finish downloading it. My brother and sister love these and I'm planning on sending these home to them as a gift.
,JoshuaPtr,2010-01-24T02:23Z,Sorry zelda I see everyone asking you don't mean to be a pest
,lfollmar,2010-01-26T21:09Z,please seeed.  i've halted at 25%.  
,ibigfire,2010-04-12T12:25Z,"Would appreciate a reseed, I never was able to get that last 0.02%..."
,turbokid,2010-08-02T10:48Z,seed please
,zeldaboy,2010-08-29T09:02Z,"I had to format my HD and lost the files.  I see there's one seed now -- also, all but 2 of the files will play all the way thru with the .02 missing ... thanks for continuing to seed everyone."
,murkle,2011-02-05T00:27Z,Anyone able to seed? I'm stuck with .2% left.
,harvestmoon292,2011-05-25T22:01Z,it says i uploaded 106 gb's so that should be good for a while
,zeldaboy,2011-06-21T17:55Z,I think I'm going to reseed this plus 2 extra albums since there aren't any seeds left for this one...
