,martian_neighbour,2009-11-16T03:03Z,For fucks sake !! why are you uploading this in an MKV format?. this sucks so bad !! most people have divx/xvid compatible dvd players. DAMN DAMN DAMN!!
,coldfeet,2009-11-16T03:15Z,MKV.. Because its HD you moron
,cipher_phinx,2009-11-16T03:33Z,for those who wants xvid format...try this http://www.dot.mininova.dot.org/tor/3151807
,cipher_phinx,2009-11-16T03:34Z,"without the ""dot"""
,Fatal87,2009-11-16T04:16Z,"Simply use mkv2vob to convert to a PS3 compatible format, easy as fuck."
,chillin8,2009-11-16T05:03Z,"Easy,,, Anti-.... I'm still seeding"
,mgicptato,2009-11-16T05:17Z,"for the one whining about an xvid/divx format, if he encoded it with xvid, this won't look this good and would defeat the purpose of being 720p and high bitrate"
,Default23,2009-11-16T08:39Z,"Been waiting for this fight, Great upload !
Unfortunately its a little too large for me at 4GB but the link by cipher_phinx is only 511 MB, gonna try that! "
,ProAnthGonz,2009-11-16T17:09Z,"Wow 1539 leechers and 2 seeders. People need to seed, since this is the only HBO version of this fight on the entire internet. All other smaller files are xvid versions of the SKY commentary of the fight. My computer jitters and frame rate goes way down when I play this with WMP classic any suggestions?"
,ProAnthGonz,2009-11-16T17:10Z,All other smaller size versions on the web are SKY SETANTA commentary presentations of this fight this is the only HBO. I will seed.
,mgicptato,2009-11-16T19:35Z,well maybe i'll release a 700mb xvid of the fight for those whose computers can't play this back properly
,iComet,2009-11-16T22:59Z,"What the hell!
The only 720p 5gb torrent on the entire internet is being Leeched by over 1700 and seeded by ONLY 6 people??? Come on guys!!! SEED PLEASE! I'm only getting 20-50-kB/s and I'm only at 32% after 9 hours! ;-(
Has anyone tried playing this on a PS3 yet?

Also, does this include the little intro movie, entrances, anthems, interviews, and credits?"
,chillin8,2009-11-16T23:23Z,"yes, Comet it does include intro movies, interviews,anthems, credits. etc....and to all who took the time to say thankyou...i appreciate it very much, i hope you enjoy this fight in HD..."
,ProAnthGonz,2009-11-16T23:43Z,"yeah Ive been stuck at 22kbs and 33.1% for hours now. 4 seeders! Wow I promise i will leave this seeding for a couple weeks when I get it completed.

Yeah not everyone can play MKV smoothly on there computers no matter which media player or ccc pack etc.

Do a dual-release MKV and one XVID/DIVX"
,mortification,2009-11-17T00:39Z,"Great upload,,, Thanks chillin8.. "

,iComet,2009-11-17T03:06Z,"@ProAnthGonz
Is it http://www.worldboxingvideoarchive.com ?
They have the 5gb 720p torrent as well but it's only if you've seeded at least 1gb, etc, etc. ;("
,sti3,2009-11-17T15:05Z,ProAnthGonz isn't that the crazy 60fps one?
,sti3,2009-11-17T15:05Z,antidentite I'm at 67% and it's still moving...
,iComet,2009-11-18T03:25Z,"About 30 people and I are almost done with 93%!
Once finished, me and others should continue to seed for the rest? You shouldn?t have a hard time downloading now because of only 1 seeder ;D
2900 leechers, and only the author is able to seed so far...? wow"
,chillin8,2009-11-18T04:05Z,"It looks like people should have this file within the hour..Please don't forget to seed people, SEED UNTIL U BLEED!!!..would really appreciate feedback on the file after viewing, thanx in advance...peace."
,thinkinmansjoker,2009-11-18T04:43Z,does this include the pre-fight video presentation by HBO?
,chillin8,2009-11-18T05:03Z,"@ thinkinmansjoker,,,yes, this includes everything in the main event,, intro clips from hbo, national athems, entrances, interviews etc......."
,makoy222003,2009-11-19T13:34Z,"CHILLIN....

,chillin8,2009-11-20T04:01Z,"@makoy,, yes it can play vlc or media player classic, you haveto make sure you have the proper codecs installed,,, k-lite codec pack(full)version, works really well..."
,makoy222003,2009-11-20T05:04Z,"tanx a lot...
it can burn..
and play in dvd player???"
,HansTek,2009-11-20T16:34Z,"It's from HBO PPV, but not a full HD rip.
but it's nice so far though.
I give it V8A10."
,chillin8,2009-11-22T03:11Z,"For the one who want to burn the file to a dvd, you can try convertXtoDVD,,, but reformatting the mkv file to dvd will lose some quality, cause your going from hd quality to standard quality (dvd)...."
,pvnrt4,2010-01-20T02:30Z,thank you
,mynameisbins,2011-05-22T12:01Z,can you lower the size?
