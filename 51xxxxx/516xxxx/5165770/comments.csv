,burakpad,2009-11-18T02:39Z,downloading right now and feedback when i'm done.
,chikatila,2009-11-18T03:33Z,"Should work fine, I've tested it on several machines. Though any comments are welcome, it's my first torrent on TPB :)

I've almost completed initial seeding, so there should be more seeders in about a hour or so."
,burakpad,2009-11-18T16:04Z,"it works...
confirmed torrent..

thank you very much..."
,playmaker2000,2009-11-20T04:31Z,hey guys...i had disk but my computer was just off on requirements needed....and its a pretty desnt computer...so i guess my questions is what r the reqmnts for this one
,ratt2k,2009-11-21T05:31Z,its work 100% and virus free.  thanks to Chikatila
,chikatila,2009-11-23T19:06Z,"Not stolen - it's a repacked version, can't ya read billymayscocaine2009? :-/"
,iXi_,2009-11-24T18:25Z,Any reason why it's repacked?
,chikatila,2009-11-24T20:45Z,"iXi_: To download less and store less on your HDD perhaps? 
Compare the original version size: 6.84 GiB (7345449242 Bytes), mine is 5.08 GiB (5450933413 Bytes), so it's almost 2 GiB less to download and store.
Also, there is in installer integrated, which shows progress of the installation and applies the crack automatically. No need to mount\burn DVDs or whatsoever, just run setup and enjoy."
,damn9090,2009-11-27T12:10Z,"When I try to play a match in any game mode the match doesn't start. The referees just stand there.

Any solutions?"
,pswii60,2009-11-27T15:47Z,"Hey Chikatila, thanks for the torrent it works perfectly, was really easy to set up also. Although the game itself has quite a few terrible glitches, which isn't your fault of course. 

@ damn9090, I am experiencing the same issue but I found a work around for it. In the menu go to game modes, then situation. Set up a game for yourself and play it for a few seconds, then exit and go back to playing a quick game and it should work again. That or you can just play a game from the start through situation mode, since it goes straight into tipoff without introductions. You will probably have to do this every time you open the game again though. "
,chikatila,2009-11-27T21:13Z,"Thanks for your input pswii60.

I'm sure there'll be some patches for those glitches and I'm pretty sure they could be applied to this version."

,madmhack,2009-12-10T21:51Z,no need for the crack..just click the setup and automatically it will install..my only problem is when your playing the it has no commentator on background audio..
,Who_R_U,2009-12-11T01:27Z,when i run the nba 2k10 application it says wrong cd
,chikatila,2009-12-11T04:20Z,Who_R_U: Are you sure you installed exactly this torrent? Because this torrent comes pre-cracked (e.g. the crack is applied automatically) and should work from the box. Try to re-install it and see if it helps.
,madmhack,2009-12-11T15:12Z,"pls help chikatila..ive installed and play the game is there really no commentator in this game? like in psp game of 2k10??

,srags,2009-12-17T00:49Z,how to crack??
,chikatila,2009-12-20T02:51Z,"srags: the game is already pre-cracked, just run setup and install the game and that's it.

2All: The game is really buggy and it's not my fault, dudes. If there are any patches that are fixing those glitches - I'm 99% sure you would be able to apply'em on my re-pack as well, as it has all the registry keys of original game in place."
,osmaye,2009-12-23T00:12Z,"downloaded fine and works.

problem is my computer sucks >.> the game is really laggy, no point playing the game"

,Mejustme55,2010-02-03T23:15Z,"Hello all!!!! and thanks for the torrent !!!!
So I explain my problem
Ive done all the installation and I ve mount the image. I install the file in my programs files.
And of course the application in my programs files cant work, it says me that I didnt insert the good cd.
But the problem now is that when I ve opened the file with daemon tools where the file "" crack"" is, I cannot play the game because when I open the nba 2k10 in the crack file, , I can only see a black screen for 1/4 of a second and it s closing automatically.
I really want to have fun like you my friend but Im a novice in computers.
Would anyone have the amability to help me about it? it would be very nice and usefull
Cheers to all

Edouard ,Paris ,France."
,chikatila,2010-02-04T03:24Z,"@razzie_3: your PC has a very low-end graphics card, GeForce 6150SE nForce 430. So the only way for you to get rid of the lags is to buy a new graphics.

@Mejustme55: I'm sure you're talking about some other torrent 'cause this one is pre-cracked and is ready to use, you just need to download it, run setup, wait 'till it installs the game and that's it - go play right away. No need to mount anything, no need to copy cracks or whatsoever."
,razzie_3,2010-02-04T06:10Z,tnx chikatila........

,yesterdead,2010-02-25T08:48Z,i have installed this on my pc... but when i tried to play it... it just wont run... what could be the problem...?
,chikatila,2010-02-26T00:20Z,@yesterdead: What are your PC specs? Are they above minimum required to run the game? http://gamesystemrequirements.com/games.php?id=1018
,yesterdead,2010-02-26T09:02Z,"@chikatila... my pc.. core 2 quad..2gig ram..1gig vidcard.. and lots of disc space...DirectX 9.0c... did it pass the Minimum System Requirements..?

thanks for the response... appreciate it..."
,chikatila,2010-02-27T03:35Z,"@yesterdead: What OS? And what do you mean by saying ""it just won't run""? Does it display any error messages or something? And last but not least: are you sure you downloaded exactly this torrent? 'Cause there is a bunch of people that downloaded some other NBA2K10 torrents but coming here to complain that they won't run. Mine torrent should run just fine. And if it's not on your PC - we'll try to resolve it."
,yesterdead,2010-03-01T01:15Z,"@chikatila..... yes..... im very much sure that this is what iv download...... my os is xp...... what i meant by ""wont run"" is i had this game installed on my pc and automatically an icon for this game will appear on the desktop after installation......but when i double clicked to play...... my screen just turns black for about 2 seconds and returns to desktop without any error message........ 

thanks for the response...... i hope i explained my problem well......"
,chikatila,2010-03-02T01:21Z,"First of all, I suggest you to update your DirectX: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3 and install VC++ Redist that might be required by the game: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en"

,Thragrash,2010-08-05T13:43Z,"I had RELOADED version in my previous computer. Got new one and re-leeching and re-installing stuff. So i downloaded your version as it's smaller. 
Strange thing is, that my previous RELOADED version didn't hang at start of quarters (or did really rarely) nor had this weird  'dead zone' around basket, where from all the shots are airballs. Wonder if you are using different crack or some other modifications?"
,Thragrash,2010-08-05T14:02Z,Wanted to add that you have done very nice work though and making 'dumbusers' life significantly easier :) Just wondering why are those annoying bugs in this release so active compared to version i had earlier.
