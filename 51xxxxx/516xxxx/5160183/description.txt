new option to force widescreen dvd selection.

recognizes "flip video stream" for audio processing.

fix minor bugs that may or may not of been there in 4.8 ;-)  more bugs may appear.

Limited testing, give feedback.

May provide more accurate syncing when syncing audio processed externally via a52dec or dtsdec (100-200ms).  Compare encode with 4.8 using DTS processed audio and 4.9  DTS processed audio using -M.  In 4.8 audio adjust with VLC and use -100 to -200 delay and see if it matches 4.9 audio.

A lot of work went into retooling, hope it worth it.

NOTE: you will have to have an ffmpeg that accepts piped input.  For a while there it was broken in SVN, but it appears fixed again.
