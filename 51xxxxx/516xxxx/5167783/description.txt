I'm making this torrent in response to another one I saw that had some (faulty?) GEN-B2 and above upgraders. I could not get them to work correctly so i did a little searching and found some better and easier drag and drop upgraders.

Now this is only for the FATS (1000) and Early Pre-V3 Slims (2000) but i thought i'd upload it just to get a better guide out there seeing as alot of players still have m33 and can't very well play 5.50+ games without getting someone to mod them, when its a waste of time if you'd just update :P 

Very CLEAR instructions inside but if you have any questions shoot.
