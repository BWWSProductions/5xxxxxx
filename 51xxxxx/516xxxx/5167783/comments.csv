,sinzan,2009-11-18T05:00Z,Has there been any progress with running homebrew with GEN? last time I upgraded I couldn't launch snestyl I than quickly went back to 5.00m33-6 I'll stay there too unless there's perhaps a 1.50 kernal for GEN
,Shorazomee,2009-11-18T05:09Z,"I have snes9x (i think thats the name) homebrew working on it. Works perfectly, and even a few sound issues are gone (had no sound with mario games) Though i can suspect that most homebrew things wont work, because most things need to be upgraded to match the 5.50 system. Just so happened it worked still."
,sinzan,2009-11-18T18:40Z,"well screw it then whats the point of ""upgrading"" IF I can play all the new games on M33 as long as they're patched. GEN seems more like a downgrade IMHO No homebrew=BSnogo    "
[T],swebarb,2009-12-16T19:01Z,uh isnt 1.50 kernel support not working in Gen ?
,iNo1,2009-12-18T04:15Z,"Shorazomee, I have a PHAT (old a crap; probably the first off the line) I'm using your instructions and got B(full) installed. I run B2 and I get the msg ""I need work....please wait...."" then ""done with success"". the prog just closes. the psp doesn't reboot and the FW says 5.50 GEN-B (Full). Instuctions are pretty simple. Can't see how I'm screwing it up! Any ideas?"
,iNo1,2009-12-18T07:30Z,"I restored backup to m-33 6 then used XGen v2 to go straight to B2, then continued to D2 using instructions. "
