**********MARCUS MILLER**********


This is a really masterpiece recorded at the Paradiso, Amsterdam 17 october 2007.
It was free to watch at the web site http://www.fabchannel.com until the record companies said that they want money from Fabchannel. The record companies are not involved at all with this video except that they own(????) the artists. They really wants to kill the good stuff, even if they not are involved. The record companies greediness must be counteracted.

Both Marcus Miller and Keith Anderson have linked this video (from Fabchannel) to their own home sites. Those links are dead now.

A friend of mine has recorded this with a chain of: computer, television, dvd-recorder and one week later it was gone from the web.
Sorry for the "auto chapters".

Please download this masterpiece and seed it to the world!!!
