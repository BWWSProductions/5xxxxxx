Fanedit Synopsis:
The whole â€œIâ€™m-a-cop-and-today-is-the-last-day-before-I-retire-and-I-really-should-just-sit-behind-a-desk-like-everyone-tells-me-to-but-thereâ€™s-just-this-one-case-that-only-I-can-crack-so-Iâ€™m-going-to-investigate-it-and-in-the-process-rediscover-my-love-for-police work-and-maybe-I-wonâ€™t-retire-after-allâ€ cliche is really over done. Morgan Freeman in Se7en is the one notable exception.

There really wasnâ€™t anything wrong with Robert Duvallâ€™s or Rachel Ticotinâ€™s performances, but the whole police side of the story is unnecessary and, quite frankly, uninteresting. None of it really serves to further the plot except for the one scene with D-Fensâ€™ mother where we get a little more background on him. The audience doesnâ€™t need to see how the police catch up with D-Fens, just that they do.
