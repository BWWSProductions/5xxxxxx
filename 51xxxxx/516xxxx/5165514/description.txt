He was born in Kenya on the 31st of August,1957 and moved with his family to Gore in Southland, New Zealand when aged 12.

=====================================================================================

The music was copied from the original CD I bought from Luke. Unfortunately by the time I listened to it, it's got scratches on the surface, so the quality of the last two tracks isn't that good as the rest, it's echoing so to say. However there's no chance to get the album in the web. Therefore in order to appreciate his work, you can download them too. Nevertheless, it's up to you.
Hope you'll like it=)
