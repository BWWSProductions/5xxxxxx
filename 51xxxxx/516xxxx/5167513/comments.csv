LOL!!! You are such a dork, dude. 

BTW, you should know that you're on a Swedish website. You know, SWEDEN, a country full of atheists, gays and, worst of all, LIBERALS."

,merc_ury,2009-11-20T05:36Z,"It was the Clinton Administration that decided that EVERY American should own a home.  Fanny & Freddy were happy to put out loans to banks who then loaned out the money to off shoot companies that gave homes to people w/out the ability to pay for them to include, but not limited to, the jobless!

Default housing loans started the economic spiral.  Blame Clinton - not Bush."
,Halbermunken,2009-11-21T23:06Z,"Umh no. Bush got the country in much greater shape than he handed it over to Obama.

""America has a strong economy and a surplus.... Now is the time to reform the tax code and share some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills."" 
--George W. Bush, nomination acceptance speech, 3 August 2000 "
,SpunkyPenguin,2009-11-30T11:14Z,"""Blaming Clinton is like when Bush told us that he wasn't interested in oil... it's not true but Republicans love to believe it anyway.""

BTW- STFU merc_ury if you don't know anything don't say anything. People who have ACTUALLY researched our economy's current problem all know it stems from Bush's administration and saying otherwise is just plain ignorant."
