The Summer Obsession is a punk rock band with members hailing from Jacksonville, Florida and Salt Lake City, Utah. The album you will be downloading is currently their ONLY album, so call this torrent a Discography if you will. They are a tremendous band with a very unique lead singer. His voice is quite original, and I'm sure you will enjoy this album as much as I have.
