Benny Hill The Ultimate Collection(mp3 320kbs)ICM369 
____________________________________________________

Benny Hill was primarily a comedian, but he was also a credible singer who charted 
a string of U.K. novelty hits beginning in the early ΓÇÖ60s. 

The Ultimate Collection gathers 23 of his Pye and EMI recordings from 1961-71, 
all of which are humorous songs rather than comedy recitations. 

Hill covered a lot of ground, touching on rock, folk, country, and ethnic styles 
while delivering rapid-fire double entendres and silly puns, some of which were 
recycled more than once. 

The collection concludes with ΓÇ£Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West),ΓÇ¥ a number-one hit in England and an enjoyable send-up of Western story songs. 

Although there are funny jokes throughout, many of HillΓÇÖs compositions can stand on their musical merits alone.
