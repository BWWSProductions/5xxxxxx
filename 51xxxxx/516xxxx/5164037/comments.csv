Audio = 3"
,drewkrew,2009-11-28T18:51Z,"VIDEO: 8 (minor frame rate stutter from time to time)
AUDIO: 3 (poor sounding with light distortion constantly throughout)

There are better versions of this out there, otherwise it's perfectly watchable. 
If you are thinking of re-encoding to DVD disc i'd use another copy to base your disc from though..."
