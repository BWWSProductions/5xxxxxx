Storyline: In 2009, Columbia Pictures' and Sony Pictures Animation's "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"
will be the most delicious event since macaroni met cheese. Inspired by the beloved children's book, the film focuses on a town where 
food falls from the sky like rain. Bill Hader will voice Flint Lockwood, a young inventor who dreams of creating something that will 
improve everyone's life. Anna Faris takes on the role of Sam Sparks, a weathergirl covering the phenomenon who hides her intelligence 
behind a perky exterior. James Caan plays Tim Lockwood, Flint's technophobic father. Andy Samberg plays Brent, the town bully who has 
plagued Flint since childhood. Bruce Campbell plays Mayor Shelbourne, who figures out that Flint's invention can put the town, and more 
importantly himself, on the map. Mr. T plays the by-the-rules town cop Earl Devereaux, and Tracy Morgan takes on the role of Earl's 
rule-breaking son, Cal.
