Powered by AutoActive Technology

ExpeditionTM PCB, powered by AutoActiveÂ® technology, is an integral part of the tightly integrated Expedition Series. By combining ease-of-use with advanced functionality,
Expedition PCB offers designers the leading technology for the creation of todayâ€™s most complex designs. Expedition PCB includes interactive and customizable multi-pass
autorouting controls for design challenges such as differential pair routing, net tuning, manufacturing optimization and microvia and build-up technology.
CAM Output Manager

CAM Output Manager provides automated and customizable creation and distribution of manufacturing data that results in increased quality, accuracy and design throughput.
TeamPCB

TeamPCB allows multiple designers to work simultaneously on the same PCB layout design. For PCB designs that are too large or complex to complete in the desired time frame, TeamPCB enables collaboration across geographically dispersed or functionally organized PCB design groups, to maximize productivity and dramatically shorten design times.
RF Circuit Design with the IFF/Agilent ADS Interface

With the IFF/Agilent ADS Interface, RF data that is designed, simulated and verified in Agilentâ€™s ADS product can be directly imported to and exported from the Design CaptureTM, DesignViewTM and Expedition PCB tools, ensuring that the databases are synchronized and data integrity is maintained.
