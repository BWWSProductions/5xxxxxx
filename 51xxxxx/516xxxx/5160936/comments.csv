doesn't like license file


The following FLEXlm errors were found:
    Server C:\ProgramData\mgc\mglicense.dat: Invalid (inconsistent) license key.
 The license key and data for the feature do not match.
 This usually happens when a license file has been altered.
Feature:       mentorall_s

If you're having trouble with license, you need to edit the mknodelocked.src to modify the HOSTID=your_host_id before you run the script.  You can edit the ISSUER=user_name entry; but works fine as is.

""your_host_id"" is your mac address, I believe.  You can find it two ways, open a cmd prompt window, via StartButton/Run/cmd.exe, then type in: ipconfig /all
Find the line for Physical Address and use the 12 character address (don't include the dashes).

The other way to find your host id is to run LMTOOLS.EXE, go to the SystemSettings tab and it is shown as the Ethernet Address.  You can copy/paste this into the .SRC file.

Thank you, you guys rock!"
