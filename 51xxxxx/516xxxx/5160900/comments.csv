,sannlo,2009-11-20T13:07Z,but don't i need a CD key to install the game??
,regulusphoto,2009-11-24T16:21Z,"Great download!
But, there's one thing... When I tries to connect to Battlenet it says that there's a problem downloading a file to my hard drive and that I should check the space... 
(I got 14 gb free space), what should I do?"
,chichislover,2009-11-26T02:07Z,its a cool download but I have that chapter 6 not loading problem. if anybody can help me please do.
,avi_benny,2009-12-01T22:32Z,"It doesnt accept the latest patch and it doesnt play the more recent maps, like DotA etc. Not worth the download, although I like how easy it is to install."
,valksss,2009-12-03T20:43Z,"so do i have problem whit 6 chapter
want help fast cous i want to play this game very much"
,Majiq1,2009-12-04T19:48Z,"I have the Chapter 6 problem too. I downloaded this torrent and 2 others, and have had the same problem with all of them. It plays the human campaign up to Ch. 6 but 6 won't load, I just get a black screen"
,EvilInDeed,2009-12-06T06:30Z,"I wouldnt complain about there being a chapter 6 error, unless its a .exe of a compiled rar and it just unpacks to the designated path... You could always ""google"" the issue and try to resolve it that way... Seems like a good upload, been looking for WC3 for a while now. If chapter 6 ""loads"" but doesnt show a cinematic / play then it might just be a DX issue..."
,AmunD_NoR,2009-12-08T13:46Z,"Awesome!! It works totally perfect, w7.
I think i was downloading at 500 kb/s! :D
The battle.net online thing doesnt work, but u can play in LAN, and thats awesome!

Brings me back memories..."
,VIP_ISO,2009-12-25T16:21Z,Just use RameRanger to play online. Google it.
,Romatolol,2009-12-26T23:37Z,"For those having an issue with Chapter 6 not loading, go to http://www.engamers.com/2009/12/01/download-patch-warcraft-3-the-frozen-throne-1-24c/ and download the ""Patch Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne Upgrade 1.24b to 1.24c English ( War3TFT_124b_124c_English.exe )"" patch. Run the patch and it should work afterward, at least it did for me."
,Darthnoob009,2010-01-04T17:38Z,"@VIP_ISO maybe you wanted to say GameRanger
The game is running good for me thnx for the upload!"
,Khono,2010-02-01T06:08Z,Ugh... I got this because my CDs are messed up and I wanted to play Undead Assault 2.  I've got my own CD keys so I needed only one thing: to not get the latest patch.... but this exe of the game comes pre patched.  :'(  At least it was fast and I only waited a few hours!  Thanks seeders!
,Khono,2010-02-01T06:11Z,Nice.  You even included an uninstall feature and it was super fast.  Great job!
,lordof7,2010-02-04T19:57Z,what the hell? Exe file? I sense virus:?????
,xDevilWearsxPradax,2010-02-14T23:28Z,"Thank you so much, And thank you seeders xD 480kb/s ^__^
Btw is this the game plus the 2 expansions or is it just the two expansions?
Cause the download says Reign Of Chaos and Frozen Throne but not Warcrat III"
,xDevilWearsxPradax,2010-02-15T03:12Z,"Haha slightly retarted comment a second ago xPP
Sorry nvm ^-^"
,Prince.of.the.sand,2010-02-15T06:22Z,"quick question:
where is a good place to download warcraft maps like dotA
2: are there any aditional campaigns?"
,SDemir,2010-03-05T17:19Z,"RED THIS FOR COMPLETE CAMPAIN USE.

To play as other races you need to complete the humain campain, but you cant play the 6th chapter.
So i've found this cheat to skip to other races
When playing a humain chapter press enter and typ this
motherland (Race) (chapter)

Example:
motherland undead 1

And you will jump to the undead chapter 1."
,yyywww111,2010-03-14T11:55Z,"Downloaded in 40 minutes

Installed in less than 2

Took less time than my old retail copy, and has ALL the files.

I love you anon"
,tOliver,2011-05-20T01:56Z,"In response to Romatolol:

I've downloaded the patch but when I try to run it I get an error - Registry error loading key 'Warcraft III\InstallPath'
The system cannot find the file specified.

Is there a specific place I should be running the patch?"
