Drops of Jupiter is Train's second album, released in 2001. The album's title is derived from "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)", its first single which was very popular and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

As an album, Drops of Jupiter is difficult to classify within a single genre, though many in the industry put the album in the Adult Contemporary Market. Indicative of Train's style, the album contains elements of country, rock, and indie rock. Besides "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)," two other singles were released from this album: "She's On Fire" and "Something More," both of which achieved modest success on the Adult Top 40 chart.

It has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States and is their best selling album to date.
