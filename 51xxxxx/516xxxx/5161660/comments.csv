,retarded_player,2009-12-01T13:03Z,"Damn. I got an angry letter fro my ISP telling me to remove all copyrighted material (Stargate.Universe.S01E08.720p.HDTV.x264-SiTV.mkv). It seems MGM tracked it.   though i don't know if they just do it by random and i was simply just unlucky.
Anything i can do to prevent beeing tracked in the future?"
