"Only from day to day
The life of a wise man runs;
What matters if seasons far away
Have gloom an have double suns?"

In the middle of the fourteen unsurpassable and frighteningly good tracks on Cry Of A Dreamer thereâ€™s a trilogy of poems by John Boyle Oâ€™Reilly set to music by Sean Tyrrell.  On the inner sleeve there is another short lyric of Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s.  In many ways it sums up the variety of moods on the fifty-five minutes of this disc which is at once romantic and dreamy, full of loss, longing and desire, yet also scathingly realistic. 
A potent and innovative amalgamation of an assortment of indigenous musical styles, from Cajun to Folk to Blues to Irish traditional â€“ to everything in between â€“ Cry Of A Dreamer is held together by astoundedly accomplished musicianship that is rooted in the heartfelt traditions of honesty, integrity and a compassion and understanding which can only be discovered by experiencing life openly and at first hand as opposed to reflecting upon in it an ivory tower. ~ Sean's website

U.S. debut album by Irish troubadour Sean Tyrrell sounds like a long-lost gem from the vaults of an Irish folk catalog.  In fact, itâ€™s a brand-new album by a current artist who happens to be profoundly steeped I Celtic tradition and untempered by modern musical influences.  The release â€“ which was named Irish album of the year by Folk Roots â€“ includes such lovely tunes as "Coast Of Malabar", a traditional lyric with music by Tyrrell; a trilogy of ancient poems that Tyrrell also set to music; and such varied fare as "Isle Of Innisfree", "Mattie", and the title track.  Featuring Davy Spillane on Uilleann pipes and low whistle and Mairtin Oâ€™Connor on accordion, among others, "Cry Of A Dreamer" is a feast of traditional Irish music.
