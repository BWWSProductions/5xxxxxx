,soyab0007,2009-11-18T08:30Z,"cannot play online game with this version bcoz it says not a correct version
plz reply me if it is working for u or not"
,fleetkid,2009-11-20T17:00Z,"Single player works fine. 

But download only if you are ready to see a big Cricket Revolution logo swish around after each and every ball, every ball... i had to delete the game 4 overs... 

and the controls... you have to press the arrow keys successively (one after the other) and not simultaneously... that mostly ruins the concept of timing... "
,paks4u,2009-11-21T02:30Z,Best thing about this seed is it's DL speed. I wish Every One acts in the same way and Seed the way this torrent was seeded.getting 130kbps DL speed on 1.5Mbps cx. Gonna seed it for some time after i download   
,khanasif,2009-12-01T07:39Z,"working fine on single player. its a nice cricket game. controls are bit different from EA cricket but now i'm enjoying variety of shots. Third umpire and lbw decisions are so accurate, much better than EA games. All the best Mindstorms!
Any patch for multiplayer??"

,djmachismo,2010-03-27T21:28Z,"This game works perfectly well, if you have windows 7 the game will not work and the computer will crash. Fix it by updating your graphic card driver. I did with mine and it works like a dream. Before you think about complaining that things dont work do some soul searching. Thank you Pratik911 wonderful upload. Also look for the download link by awolfman to install original player names for all the countries."
