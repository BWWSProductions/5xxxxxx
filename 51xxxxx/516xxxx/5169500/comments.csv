,totonebadass,2009-11-19T15:43Z,after watching the first two episodes i wonder if it was worth the trouble...
,totonebadass,2010-02-15T13:32Z,"after watching all season, i can confidently say that it was not a waste. :)"

,BoonDockSaiNt30,2010-02-23T15:58Z,"Ok, hope isn't a loss. Thanx I will DL and comment when done watching. "
,solutioN-Ghost,2010-03-15T16:19Z,"dude, stuck at 75% and in a low speed. between 1- 11 KB/s :@

,totonebadass,2010-04-14T15:09Z,"take it easy dude, i'll start  re-seeding."
,totonebadass,2010-04-14T15:11Z,altough I just tested the download and I got connected almost imediately to 120 of 251 seeds and 266 of 691 leechers. so I think it's a problem with you. Are you firewalled ? Maybe you need to forward ports.
,grandtheftautoman,2010-05-09T16:07Z,haha i have all supernatural movies in season 1 whitout S01E20 and S01E13 is all i have but need seasons 2-3-4-5 add this out on piratebay i check this every day plzz

,1kaz16,2010-06-03T19:10Z,what format is it in because vlc nor real player can play it
,Yelal,2010-06-22T13:35Z,"I'm hoping this is also a nice serie.
I've watched Chuck - Dexter - Merlin - Legend of the Seeker - Spartacus and Robin Hood, and I'm looking for more series!! 

Can anybody help me with this? I seriously like magic stuff~

Kind Regards,

Yelal!
U can PM me."
,totonebadass,2010-08-04T21:20Z,"Don't mention it. It's avi format,if mplayer/smplayer or vlc can't play it then mostprobably the torrent has not been downloaded completely...
:)

Check the status in your torrent client."
,totonebadass,2010-08-04T21:23Z,"if u stil need the rest of the seasons leave a message and i will check back and upload them.
cya

or if u have demonoid account, go there, they're already uploaded"
,totonebadass,2010-08-04T21:26Z,"these comments take a lot of time to appear or my network is $%^& or the piratebay has problems....

if u stil want the other season i can upload them, or go directly to demonoid and get them from there."
,casper32693,2010-08-06T14:27Z,thanx totonebadass. i read all the comments on a torrent before i usually download them and you said i could find these on demonoid. but i intinally looked on demonoid for this torrent and couldnt find anything. anyway thanx bro
,totonebadass,2010-08-07T19:24Z,"That's weird, i don't remember exactly where i got this from. Anyway just searched demonoid for 'supernatural season' and found all seasons, one by one and all bundled. And they're pretty seeded."
,totonebadass,2010-08-07T19:27Z,"By the way i didn't mean exactly this torrent, i meant season 1. No matter where it came from. Anyway if u need'em i can upload mine, i got a pretty good upload speed."
,Kristallskarva,2010-09-13T19:56Z,"Is it just me, or is the sound crappy? "
,kiwovo,2010-10-12T02:17Z,"shitty torrent.. beware..
no subs works with these files wasted 8 giga ffs!"
,kreed1,2010-10-18T02:34Z,"man i hate people who cap their upload speeds thinking that it will increase their downloads .So keep on seeding and allow maximum upload rate for the good of everyone.p.s your downloading and uploading bandwidths are are not dependent on each other..they are impartial
SO SEED GOOD"
,masterx5,2010-11-08T01:44Z,"Anybody have found the sub for this torrent ?
Everyone i tried didn't work... they all are shifted..."
,embmmusic,2010-12-16T20:08Z,"kiwovo - there are no subs in this torrent, that's probably why they don't work. And nowhere does it say in the description that subs are included so it's through your own stupidity that you wasted an 8 gig download.

Great torrent, fast download, brilliant series!"

,OMGnigga,2012-02-14T09:54Z,"The files are in freaking .AVI containers, if you're expecting SUBTITLE tracks on an .AVI you're an EFFING DUMBARSE... why can't you people use your brains? Since when do .avi's have soft subs that you can turn on and off... NEVER.

Decent DL on this, way better then the freaking smallville torrent which is going an amazing .5kB/s Let's just hope this show is any good"
,OMGnigga,2012-02-14T09:58Z,"re-read comments, you guys are effing idiots. One, WHO THE HELL uses VLC or Real Player, you're an IDIOT. Two, subs are shifted boo hoo, then open up the sub file and reshift times OR use your effing media player to handle shifting... oh wait, you're stupid and use VLC/RealPlayer LOL... get a brain first then go get CCCP... google it dumbfucks"
