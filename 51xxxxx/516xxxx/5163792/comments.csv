No one has finished downloading this yet, and I'm at 82.7%.

Once it's done downloading I promise I'll seed for as long as possible. ;)"
,GeckaWeot,2009-11-27T22:48Z,"^ Same, could you reseed it? 82.7% (407 MB) is the magic number of unhappiness.. I'll seed once I get done, but that entails being able to be...ya know...done."
,Kecleon,2009-11-28T17:56Z,"Sorry guys my internet has been slow and buggy. But we have someone on 99.7 percent as I'm writing!

And this torrent is new."
,Kecleon,2009-11-28T18:03Z,"All of a sudden 50% of all the Leechers turned into seeders!
This torrent is done!

Next torrents:
Pikmin 2 OST (151 MP3 Tracks)
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon 2 OST

I hope they won't turn out to be as big as this torrent."
