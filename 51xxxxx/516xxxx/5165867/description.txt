From wikipedia:

Wax Tailor is the alias of French trip hop/hip hop producer, Jean-Christophe Le Saout. He started in 2004 with two EP's (Lost The Way and Que Sera / Where My Heart's At). The first album Tales of the Forgotten Melodies he released in March 2005, mixing hip-hop, downtempo and trip-hop. This album became one of the best selling electronic releases of the year. The second album Hope & Sorrow released in April 2007 was also very well received by audiences. It was nominated for the French "Victoires de la Musique" and US Indie music award.

After being a host on a French radio in the Paris suburb of Mantes-La-Jolie, JC Le Saout started the French Rap band La Formule in the 1990s. He created his label Lab'Oratoire in 1998 and produced records from La Formule as well as Break Beat compilations and a collaboration with the Swedish band Looptroop. He began work on the Wax Tailor project in 2001, first appearing on a remix of Looptroop & La Formule's "Breathing Under Water". Wax Tailor's first EP Lost The Way was released in 2004 and features contributions from Charlotte Savary, Marina Quaisse, and Big Dada rapper Infinite Livez. Other musicians who have appeared alongside Wax Tailor include North Carolina Hip-Hop duo The Others, Ursula Rucker, Sharon Jones, Voice and A State Of Mind.

His third album "In The Mood For Life" was released on September 22nd, 2009.
