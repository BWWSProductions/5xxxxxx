I jumped way ahead because I realized there was no way I'd get through all the fantastic blues you've laid on us here and found this. Great. My fave is Rio, I think with the Weir(d) Brothers. 
""you're in the groove, Jackson.""
And Utopia -- damn, now i'm going to have to dig the two i have out and have a Road night. 
Thanks for all this great music and now  comedy. "
