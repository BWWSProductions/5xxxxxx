,papasmurf2413,2010-04-26T05:58Z,"Whenever I convert a movie, It makes the movie 32 minutes long... I'm not too clear why its doing that. I'm putting it from AVI to mpeg for my iphone... Any suggestions? I have all the codec and formatting set to ORIGINAL but its getting pretty frustrating... It just cuts itself off from converting and its done at 32 mins."
,papasmurf2413,2010-04-26T05:59Z,Not to mention it says time remaining is 231232321:44:23.... =/
,moksha77,2010-05-02T09:31Z,"Thanks jmb2012! It worked very well a few times, then I wanted to convert a file, started it then realized I did not change the aspect ratio, stopped the program, changed the ratio, then I wanted to start it again, after 2 seconds it says ""Finished"", and there is a 0 KB file. I tried everything; rename, reinstall, nothing work. What the hell is this? Any help? Thanks!"
,bankrobber.ent,2010-05-10T04:59Z,i got the free trial version for some reason? it only changes 20% of the file. how can i fix this ?

,listenherenow,2010-08-02T07:14Z,"I am going to try this - I just need something that can convert the torrents people keep putting up back to the old school divx.   My player willnot play the mp4 stuff and whatever else they keep switching to. LOL
"
,listenherenow,2010-08-02T07:28Z,"LOL - fast download - all set up in fact - looks to be working 100% so far . 

  There is no direct option to divx though. my player  plays teh ones called ts though which appears to be mpeg2  - I am trying this out now. 
       see how bad I can fk this up. LOL.  "
,listenherenow,2010-08-02T11:04Z,"ts apparently is not for divx players. 

  doesnt even show up on the player now at all. It does play with nero showtime on the cuputer however.  very well - I wonder what the heck it is for though? The file is still 1.32gigs. "
,listenherenow,2010-08-02T11:32Z,"I see you say in here - covert to DivX - but there is no option listed in this program to covert to DivX that I have found. 

  I am trying windows media mpeg4 - on the off chance that it's different from what the hell I started with. LOL "
,listenherenow,2010-08-02T13:22Z,"windows media mpeg 4 - No Dice - so I have wasted several hours of my life here so far. 

  I am going to try again - wissh I could fine teh Dvix option - this is killing me - I really thought I had it that last time - only plays audio though and reports video codec not supported. "
,listenherenow,2010-08-02T13:31Z,"I see under Mkv - and then by useing the drop down box  I can see Dvix 5 2000 kbps - ; Audio Mp3 - 192 KBps 

    I am keeping my fingers crossed on this one since it seems to be the only one with the Dvix Option.   
   If this one doesn't work I am going to bed.  LOL "
,listenherenow,2010-08-02T15:33Z,"That one will not even be seen - doesn't even play on the computer. 

  I don't get it. 

   I will try something else later - any help at all here would be appreciated though. 

  Thanks.    "

,DamnitAugustus,2010-08-26T23:20Z,"Wow, this works great. I don't know what people are whining about, I converted an mp4 to avi so I can burn a dvd easily. : P the video and sound is just as well. 
So yeah, just ask for help if you're having trouble, don't assume it doesn't work. Yeesh."
,bavage,2010-09-05T00:36Z,"@listenherenow.  underneath ""browse"" is a button called ""edit"" click it to choose divx/xvid video compression i had the same prob as you ""listenherenow"" doing this will allow the vids to play on old divx compatible dvd players"

==Review========
excellent torrent. Simply install the program... then click on the ""Help"" icon and input the serial provided.

Seriously... to anyone having trouble installing this... you may as well give up on torrents right now! This has to be one of the easiest installs I've ever seen hahaha

,listenherenow,2011-11-16T09:19Z,"The VOB is the one you need to select to play on a reg player. works perfectly. 
To: Scorpion_002, DamnitAugustus, Diazafan.  

   Seriously, i was talking about features on the converter that you had not even tried yet. i am betting you are having some issuses now with certain features correct?   so you spoke too soon. 

  so Far I have no issuses that have not been able to be resolved EXCEPT FOR MKV files. 

  does anyone know why when a MKV file is selected to be converted the thing will just opop a 9.3kb fole up in the destination folder and say it's finished?  instantly. will not convert a MKV file to anything but a 9.3kb file that is unreadable.   i am attempting to convert a load of MKV files to AVI and it will not do it. 

  please, before you answer try one out.  you will see what I mean. 
"
,PKCMVA,2012-06-24T06:34Z,"Will only allow original or preset frame sizes.

Just that alone is a big FAIL!

Free converters have that option, why not ones you pay for?"
