These are the audiobooks to the series Mercy Thompson by Patricia Briggs. Narrated by Lorelai King.

I have split each book up into their chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  In the original torrent, they were split up into two mp3 files, and I  broke those mp3 files into smaller ones, one for each chapter.

As far as I have been able to tell, there hasn't really been anything wrong with these files from the beginning. But, if you find something the matter, just comment and I'll try and fix what is wrong.

I've made each book into an .m4b (audio book format) file. These are actually smaller in size, and they work perfectly on your iPod.
