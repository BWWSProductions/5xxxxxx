what if everyone that have been download a huge torrent file on piratebay give one week at least of seeding at half your net connection speed all day long ??? i think it's a great idea and everyone would be happy. i know it's a huge responsability but some user give us a lot of oportunity to have some thousands of dollars software, i think that piratebay would be a better place..."

,FluffyBeast,2009-12-22T20:28Z,"to all the guys wh osays it doesnt work because of their graphic cards on their macbook pro
this is your solution:
Buy a iMac
Bioshock is a game only made for intel mac's (iMac)
not for macbooks :) so everyone who download this and has a macbook, stop your download :)"
,FluffyBeast,2009-12-22T20:29Z,"btw, i'm gonna dwnld this soon... first my limit of downloads need to be set on 0, this will happen within 5 days, so then i'm gonna download :) hope this works

i didn't mean the macbooks are a piece of shit... i just wanted to say that Bioshock is a game made for iMac's only and not work on Macbooks :). that's it.

,DarkVOX,2011-01-23T04:44Z,"Works great on my Macbook Pro 15"".
Loading is a bit slow, but the Crack's work perfectly, and very little lag when using maxed out options.

Only issue is when you Quit to Finder, its VERY slow doing so, and then my computer lags for a bit.

It speeds back up after a minute or so."

,BexRock,2011-08-14T09:14Z,"to get to work do this: 

Open BioshockMacDLDVD.dmg. drag the bioshock logo into applications (will rake about 5 minutes to transfer) 

Then open Bioshock.1.0.NoDVD.Crack.dmg. When the dialog box opens, open Bioshock Crack box. It will then ask you to find the Bioshokc folder (which will be in Applications remember) 

Once this is successful, open â€˜Bioshock.1.0.1Update.dmgâ€˜ this will unzip the file into the folder which contains all the dmgs. its called Bioshock.app. You must copy this into the bioshock folder in applications, overwriting the original Bioshock.app that is there. 

You have now updated the game, but you now need to use the crack, or it will ask for the DVD. 

Lastly, back in the folder with the dmg files, open â€˜Bioschock.1.0.1.NoDVD.Crack.dmgâ€˜. And do the same process you did for the first crack (remember, open the file and find the bioshock folder in applications) "
