Reviews from Amazon

"Points to the over-reliance on financial models and quantitative techniques as what ultimately brought down the financial markets. Sure, many of us feel that we have heard enough on this topic-do we really need another book about the financial mess and how it all began? Yes, we do. . . Triana's impressive knowledge and experience allows him to dig deeper and go beyond the mere musings of his published peers."
â€”Risk Management Magazine

"Readers of this book may make quite a lot of noise. . . Some will cheer out loud; others will yelp as cherished beliefs are torn into. At times, the book is deliberately incendiary. Triana is trying to stimulate debate. . . On the whole, this is a good read."
â€”The Financial Times, July 23rd 2009

"...calls for a return to "good old fashioned commonsense decision making"."
â€”Daily Express, June 4th 2009

"This book explains how it is that theoretical finance can fail dramatically in the real world."
â€”Finanace & Management Faculty, June 2009

"The book is fizzing with ideas"
â€”The Economist, June 29th 2009

" Trianaâ€™s book will ruffle a lot of feathers, but it also will make many readers think hard."
