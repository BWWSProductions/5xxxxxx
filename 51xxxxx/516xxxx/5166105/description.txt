Odin the All-Father is gone, and death goddess Hela is stockpiling souls for the fight to take his place!  The mighty Thor leads Asgard's finest to rescue the dead from a fate worse than death, while Thor's brother-in-arms Balder battles giants to rescue his beloved Queen Karnilla!  The God of Thunder and the God of Light - which one will lead Asgard into the face of coming dooms?

Written by Walter Simonson and illustrated by Sal Buscema.
