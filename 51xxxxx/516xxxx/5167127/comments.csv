QuickBooks Cash Register Plus 2010

Product Number: 388-539

@wakbokaya: 2010 Canadian Quickbooks? I tried my luck on Multicurrency and finally managed to generate a working serial, but couldn't get past the activation. Never have had time since. The US versions have kept the same serial scheme so it's easy for me to make serials. Activation seems to be the same too. But Canadian is totally different and thus very time-consuming. And time is something I haven't had and won't have for the foreseeable future. I posted the serial I had hoping someone else might crack the activation on it. Guess nobody felt like putting some time into it :("
,wakbokaya,2009-12-04T06:57Z,"No problem Beast_iND.
Thanks anyways for all the effort you put into cracking them though.
I found this work@ for the 06 CDN version and maybe it could help you into cracking it.

I said in my very first pos here that I WOULD NOT provide support for POS9 or CRP2010!!! What part of NOT is hard to understand?

These use a different activation system and I will not invest time into figuring it out! If you have a business requiring a POS or CRP setup, you also have the money to invest into the software. And for your customer's sake, you shouldn't be using cracked software anyway otherwise you might be responsible for the next case of stolen credit card numbers.

What ""sgypsy"" is trying to say I think is that, he just wants the regular Premier Product code, he doesn't want to be using the accountant version and switch from it.

When you have the regular Premier product code, then you have the option to choose which Premier Edition you want to use, like Non-Profit or Professional Services.

just wondering if you have a solution for the Australian ver of QuickBooks Pro 2009/10 QBi series? I have run your current crack and it runs fine but you cant enter the Validation Code as this version wants a 20 didget number in 5 number groups. Any help or idears would be Great Thanks"
,Beast_iND,2010-01-08T18:45Z,"@mark143: I just played around with it and was able to activate payroll in the Pro edition (if I remember right) but I wouldn't recommend it because QuickBooks then calls home ever so often to update tax-related files.

The way I did it is the same as activating the software itself. Ran the crack, then when the crack displayed the instruction, I ran Quickbooks. Went to the payroll menu and somewhere in there, it allows you to activate it.

Since I no longer have it installed on my box, I can't tell you exactly where to click but like said, I wouldn't recommend using that feature on a pirated copy.

@asap_88: I bet the Australian version uses some weird system like the Canadian and UK versions used to (numbers looks like 38427-16359-97012-000004). My activator officially supports US-versions only, sorry! I've never managed to figure out the activation scheme used on non-US versions."
