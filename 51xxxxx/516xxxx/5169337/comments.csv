,hobowithashotgun,2009-11-19T09:33Z,fast dl works perfectly thanks will seed.
,smavrakis,2009-11-20T04:09Z,Does this work with the patch? Does it work for any character or on a new game only?
,lastmanstanding,2009-11-20T09:49Z,"yea I want to know too, does this work with 1.01a/b patch?"
,smavrakis,2009-11-20T21:44Z,"Well it worked fine on my unpatched game, dunno about the patch though. Doesn't have to be on a new game either. Thx a lot, will seed."
,yelloo,2009-11-20T23:51Z,Thanks Murlok.
,seos,2009-11-21T00:32Z,"works great for my unpatched v.
thx m8"
,BibJib,2009-11-21T15:23Z,seems to be working just fine for 1.01b
,valedor_one,2009-11-22T19:44Z,"What happens if you already have several of these, legit? 
Does it mess up your online profile if you use these cr@cked ones?"
,-SPQR-,2009-11-27T15:55Z,"thanks!
I have a registered preorder collectors edition with all add-ons registered.
I patched in ALL of these DLCs even the ones I already had, works like a charm so far.
gotta love the chest at the camp!!!"
,Danorum,2009-11-28T15:38Z,"Didn't expect this to work, but it actually did.

Thanks al lot:)

But i had hoped that more of the add-ons were side-quests instead of just items (I think that only warden's keep and the stone prisoner are side quests)"
,-SPQR-,2009-11-28T18:04Z,"WARNING!

The Storage Chest was GONE the next nightwhen I entered my camp - including everything I had put into it...

Strangely the AddIns.xml had changed size also (bigger), so I copied the one from this release back over it, but that didnt help either.

so... this really sucks. I hope it will ""surface"" again  :)"
,-SPQR-,2009-11-28T19:01Z,"According to this: http://social.bioware.com/project/463/

I might currently be in some kind of instance of my camp where the chest doesnt spawn. so I may get lucky the next night when I enter camp... :)"
,ken_drummer,2009-12-01T19:02Z,Anyone know if this works alright with the SKIDROW release?
,chadderbocks,2009-12-04T18:47Z,"I completed Warden's Keep but I couldn't access the items from Asturian's Painting, but everything else in the DLC seems fine."
,chadderbocks,2009-12-04T19:11Z,Sorry about the earlier comment.  I was able to complete Warden's Keep.  
,khratos,2009-12-08T02:17Z,"Ok, so I did the SP quest and the follow up with Shale's memory.. now, I did WK too and supposedly it still shows up on quest log as something along the lines of ""This is the first piece of the puzzle, see if you can find out more info on Soldier's Peak"".. Also, I cannot travel to any other areas other than the DLC contents. I can't go back to redcliffe village, forest areas, ozrimmar, or any other place. Any advice on how to fix it? Or is that how its supposed to be?"
,Bengonga,2009-12-12T04:18Z,"heyo '-SPQR-' ur in kingsage ,world4 too? "
,Coralian,2009-12-13T06:20Z,"So the Da Updater is stuck at like 99%-ish but all the DLC's say they're installed, is it safe to close it? (It's been like this for like an hour."
,schlixx,2009-12-14T14:29Z,"LISTEN UP PEOPLE
if you are having problems getting the dlc to install like i did for fucking weeks heres what u need to do. BOTH stone prisoner and wardens keep will not work once installed, that much is obvious, to activate them in game they require AUTHORIZATION, most of you probably know this, but like me did not know how to do that as the XML file does not mention authorization anywhere in them, well i finally figured it out. above wardens keep and stone prisoner items in the xml file you must find the entry for STATE- it will be set to 2, change this to 1 for both items and hurrah they will work, hope this helps all of you."
,wrathofall,2009-12-15T02:50Z,"Thanks for the tip, but what files do we look for and where are they located? Also, any new reports on the chest operation? Does it return or do you loose all your stuff? THANKS!
