I took this video of Animal Collective performing in the 'Sco at Oberlin College on my birthday, september 10th, 2007. The video was taken with my handheld DV cam, and the audio is from the mic on the camera. that said, the audio is actually surprisingly good, and the video is up close and personal. the show was only about 350 people. there's an hour of it, then my battery ran out. enjoy!
