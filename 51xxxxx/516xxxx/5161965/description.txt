For years before the release of their debut CD AUDIO, the Blue Man Group had been dazzling audiences with theatrical performances that featured their unique music along with their zany yet focused visual presentation. Onstage, the trio (augmented by additional instrumentalists) plays a percussive, almost tribal brand of instrumental music that involves both ancient instruments such as the cimbalom, and Blue Man-invented items including the Drumbone and the Drum Wall. With a combination of Ennio Morricone-ish guitar lines, overwhelming percussive thumping, and a combination of acoustic, electric, and electronic sounds, the music of the Blue Man Group suggests some alternative universe where pop as we know it has a slightly skewed character.

When Blue Man Group was composing AUDIO, they discovered the incredible depth of DVD 5.1 Surround Sound and decided to release both a stereo mix and a surround sound mix. Although a traditional stereo mix would prove to be a quality medium for Blue Man Groupâ€™s first venture into recorded music, the 5.1 Surround Sound mix would truly capture the range and magnitude of their unique sound.
