The Saw Doctors are one of the most successful bands ever to come out of Ireland. Taking their name as a title of false importance, The Saw Doctors have built up a cult following in their homeland where they have 18 top 30 hits including 3 #1 singles. They have also built a loyal following in the UK and in the United States. They held the record for Ireland's biggest-selling single of all time, "I Useta Lover,"[1] which topped the Irish charts for nine weeks in 1990. The following year brought another #1 record, "The Hay Wrap", before a seventeen year #1 drought was brought to an end on 17 October 2008 with their cover of "About You Now"...all covers are included
