The second video is about how every product that you buy in the future will have a computer chip in it. The video shows the process of RFID technology being put into place worldwide and how it will be used for total control. This leads into the third film where the RFID technology is used in microchips that are implanted in the flesh of humans. This video also covers the topic of creating new humans through technology. Part four of this documentary has various Hollywood movie clips that bring parts 1-3 together giving examples how movies show us the future and what is planned for us.

The U.S. in NOT better that was Hitler, because:


* Hitler was a creation of the monetary power.

* Obama have opened a new strategic front in Yemen.

* EE.UU. is the only one country That have used an atomic bomb. They have used twice, in two cities defenseless (Hiroshima and Nagasaki).

* U.S. is the only country that is at perpetua war. Since the end of World War II, its soldiers and mercenaries are on one or more wars in other countries.

* U.S. has military bases in over 100 countries. 

* U.S. meddling, explicitly warns and threatens many countries. 

* U.S. has led coups and bloodshed in many countries (Honduras is the last). 

* U.S. has caused more death and destruction q any other country in the history of mankind. 

* U.S. has a nuclear arsenal (and conventional) that could destroy the Earth, making it uninhabitable. 

* U.S. is a morally bankrupt, and now economically. Its citizens are literally starving, have no social security, but the military budget exceeds that of the rest of the world together. 

* U.S. receives orders from Israel. 

* Israel is a mini U.S. which is also at war since 1948, when they stole the Palestinian territory, expelled Palestinians d 4 million and now have those who are caged in 2 camps: Gaza and West Bank. 

* Israel and the U.S. will drag the world to the final disaster. 

* The proliferation of atomic weapons (and conventional) is a disgrace, but Iran is entitled to one ten-thousandth of what they have U.S. and Isarel. 

* Iran has not invaded or threatened any country. The Iran-Iraq war was started by Iraq and promoted by U.S. ...
