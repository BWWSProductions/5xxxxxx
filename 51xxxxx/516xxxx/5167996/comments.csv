,Shadow_Jedi,2009-11-21T06:46Z,This show is/was crap! Thanks for wasting yours and everyone else's time by dropping these crap bombs!
,Shadow_Jedi,2009-11-26T04:46Z,"@big_dad_e...well man, I've been waiting close to a week to get one of your famous insults and thus nothing! I was hoping to get what you dished out for other people who gave you shit be o'well. Just BSing anyways. Your downloads have finally allowed me to get into Sopranos and have saved me upwards to two hundred. Green skull was well deserved. I was just wanting some bashing because I was in an odd mood. Thanks for your hard work and your Soprano attitude:) Happy Thanksgiving!"
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-30T01:53Z,"@ GO-jets, You're welcome!
@ Shadow_Jedi , Fugetaboutit!  We all get in those moods, smoke a few bong hits, or eat some Cannabutter, or drink some GreenDragon.  :-P
@ Everyone, If you don't upload torrents, that's cool, but give back by seeding.  Peace."

You sound like you're about 11.
This show will stay with you for the rest of your long life and it's not about mafia, it's about reality, one, that obviously you just can't fatom.
Burn it so eventualy you can have some point reference.
Bad english, I know.
Cheers"
,Shadow_Jedi,2009-12-22T00:34Z,"@ asobier: You obviously didn't get that I was just showing my appreciation to big_dad_e in an odd way... If you view his previous posts his short-fuse bombs that he drops on people give me a kick. Being a Yankee myself, mate, I know what the lifestyle is about and this is how my fam rolls. As for the age comment; with a Master's degree I'm doing quite well for eleven so thanks. At least big_dad_e got the humor so you can go eat a shit covered cheerio, mate. Thanks again big_dad_e and I puff when I can and if I could it would be 24/7. Happy Holidays."

Ha ha!  You're funny!  Nice username, you neo-Nazi.  We all know how much you enjoy your swine:http://www.imagebam.com/image/d0752586974553"
[V],big_dad_e,2010-07-17T04:52Z,"No you inbred, I\'m not Jewish. But you are obviously a Neo-Nazi. Now strap on a bomb and go blow up a church, temple or mosque. BTW your 72 virgins are all men like yourself!"
[V],big_dad_e,2010-07-18T06:24Z,"israelis_r_pigs
Peace be with you. I forgive your false witness against me. Again, I'm not Jewish but I don't hate them. You should pray for peace instead of war. God bless. "

,bahurupia,2010-09-12T15:13Z,"I never watched a single episode of The Sopranos.

Amused by the recent JerseyMania that has swept over the Trashy Reality Show genre, after hearing several people, offline and on, assert that it all started with The Sopranos, I downloaded the first episode out of curiosity.

Since then, my life has been Officially on Hold. I am now Epically Behind on everything from laundry to returning phone calls and emails to work, because this show is television heroin.

A word of caution to those with slower connections.

If you did not watch The Sopranos when it was on HBO, pace yourself. 

Resist the temptation, if you can, to binge-gobble those first few seasons all at once, faster than you can download, and find yourself like me, staring impatiently at utorrent & jonesing for your next fix!

Thank You, big_dad_e, for your generosity in bestowing this magnificent gift upon earth residents. :)"
