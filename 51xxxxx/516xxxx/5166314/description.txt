Central coast bass urban adventures where we seek out small bodies of water and see if there is fish. I am going to try for bass but if I don't catch any I am going to catch something. This time we head to a ground water replenishing pond and have a good time.To download all our shows check out centralcoastbass.com please seed for your fellow fisherman, we can't do it alone. Enjoy.
