,jstn2009,2010-05-12T13:25Z,"when i try to patch the file, it says ""Can't open File!"""
,En3myx0fxG0d,2010-05-20T04:37Z,"install the application. don't bother trying to enter a key yet it won't work. when done installing use keygen, If using Win7 or Vista right click the keygen choose ""run as administrator"" to patch, choose the .exe file in program files/beyond compare. patch should be successful. after that start the program you should get an error and it will ask for a key. Now generate a key now it should work. also I used the prof edition option in the keygen. "
