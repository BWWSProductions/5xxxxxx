Notable changes:

    * File views now support "Open" and "Save As" dialogs on FTP sites.
    * Improved Data Compare support for detecting multi-line cells.
    * Changed confirmation dialog button order to match Windows (Yes/YesToAll/No/NoToAll/Cancel)

Beyond Compare allows you to quickly and easily compare your files and        
  folders.  By using simple, powerful commands you can focus on the             
  differences you're interested in and ignore those you're not.  You can then   
  merge the changes, synchronize your files, and generate reports for your      
  records.
