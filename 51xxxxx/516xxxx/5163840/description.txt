This is a re-launch of this concert torrent, if youve downloaded this video
before, please feel free to join this torrent instead as its multitracker
enabled and you only need download a jpg images of th dvd cover we've since
added as a souvenir. Great quality video and sound!

Mr. Andrea Bocelli exemplifies the supreme spirit of the men of Italy in the
sense of genuine idealism that is at the core of their sense of being. I am
hopeful that this greatness will once again see its due on this earth as these
men have a desire for legitimacy in their midst in respect of what they will
allow to prevail ultimately that will be an example to all.

This concert has some true greats including a supreme "Ave maria" rendition
at the very start of th programme. The choice of conductor is not to my liking
I must admit as th mechanical movements are dissonant to the material at hand,
as such i suggest that this element of the programme be overlooked and the
genius of Bocelli focussed on exclusively instead. ta!!
