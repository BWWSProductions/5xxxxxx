This is the fifth audiobook of the House of Night series, Tempted, by P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast, read by Cassandra Morris. They can't seem to keep a narrator for this series, can they?

I wasn't the one who split this up, so I'm sorry for what's wrong with the book. You'll understand once you listen.  As soon as I find a better copy, I'll upload that as well.

Also included the ebook.

Enjoy.
