,80xing,2009-11-16T11:58Z,2 out of 3 stopped at 90.7 for me the only one that worked so far is the first one
,viddyo,2009-11-16T23:40Z,"No problem here, wush, and thanks for your efforts.  I sorta figured you were watching for everyone's shares to reach up in the 70-80% range so all of us could complete at once and re-seed effectively.  Thanks again, from the bottom of our Stern-lovin' hearts!"
,INEEDASTUPIDUSERNAME,2009-11-19T15:19Z,Yes. Much Thanks!

Anyone have these to upload??"
,HBbearsmash08,2010-11-24T09:45Z,Anyway you can post a 2009 complete torrent?
,lordofthelefthand,2011-10-16T22:27Z,Awesome!!! 2003-2005 would be the tits.
,exarro,2011-11-12T18:50Z,"how can you call this ""complete"" when you're missing 2 whole months of shows? this is, however, the most complete collection of shows from 2006 that i know of so thanks, i guess."
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-01-24T01:53Z,"because i didn't realize they were missing from the torrent? dick.

On the WDM Network our 2006 collection is complete but by the time i noticed it was missing files I wasn't going to repost and re-seedthe entire thing again.

There are 46 shows missing which you can get off the Vault at our place."
