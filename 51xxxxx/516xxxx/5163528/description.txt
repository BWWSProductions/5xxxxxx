Excellent picture and sound quality. 
Embedded and external subtitles, including English, French and Spanish
The latter two are the embedded ones addtionally, for your compatible DivX
player.

Please check the net for any compatible subtitles if you should need them.
You can also download an excellent program from Denmark, on the Internet
(its either free or donation supported I would think - its worth paying
something for)called "Subtitle editor". You can use it to make any improvements
to exisiting subtitles on the net, or to create your own for your community.

This is a re-launch of this torrent with an added jpg image. If you've
previously downloaded this movie from us, kindly join this multi-tracker
torrent instead, to help us seed to all fans of the great Mr. Humphrey Bogart
and the lovely Ms. Ingrid Bergman. With thanks!

Casablanca is one of the greatest movies ever made. it is a tale of chivalry.
the ability of a man to sacrifice what might have been his own happiness
potentially, for the happiness of the woman he loves, together with the man she
prefers to be with in actuality. A lovely movie that should be in every
library, The lovely song "as time goes by" has become a classic favorite from
this great period of movie making history.

The industry has long overpriced movies such as this (including The Sound of
Music especially), and other than getting a break at Columbia House on these
titles now and then, theres no way to see a reasonable way to share this movie
than through this extra quality conversion for this torrent launch.

After 70 years, I think this title belongs in the Public domain, however
Id pay five bucks gladly for a real DVD on the shelf! (I bet you would too).
In the meantime, this is as good as it gets!
