In the year of 2009 the Happy Productions crew is taking it back to 1983 !

This years movie is a tribute to the eighties, and so the movie is called â€Stuck in the eightiesâ€. This season we got some good shots from locations such as; Oppdal (NO), Colorado (US), Salt Lake City (US), Folgefonna (NO), Tahoe (US), KlÃ¤ppen (SWE).

We had a real good time during the takes for the cut scenes in this one, as you'll probably figure out for yourself. The story line builds up to the last part in the movie wich will show you the potensial of norwegian skiing and snowboarding.
