,ListenToMyMusic5,2009-12-08T02:21Z,"I tried that, but the .torrent file was too large as it has to store a hash for every single file. And I used zip archives since not everyone uses rar.

When I tried to upload the torrent file there was just a white screen, it's some error on tpb with large .torrent files."
