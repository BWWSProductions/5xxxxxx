*   Powderfinger are a rock band from Brisbane, Australia. The band formed    *
*   in Brisbane in 1989. The current band members are Bernard Fanning         *
*   (vocals, guitars and keys), Darren Middleton (guitars and vocals), Ian    *
*   Haug  (guitars and vocals), John Collins (bass and vocals) and Jon        *
*   Coghill (drums).                                                          *

*   Golden Rule is the seventh studio album by Powderfinger. Powderfinger     *
*   commenced writing in January 2009 and gave themselves a tight deadline    *
*   in which to come up with the new songs before working once more with      *
*   friend and producer extraordinaire Nick DiDia (Neil Young, Pearl Jam).    *
*   After making all of their previous albums far from home they decided      *
*   this time to record at Studio 301 in Byron Bay, and mix at Studio 301     *
*   in Sydney. DiDia has previously worked on the hugely successful           *
*   Powderfinger albums 'Vulture Street', 'Odyssey Number Five' and           *
*   'Internationalist'. Musically, this album is a departure from             *
*   Powderfinger's signature sound - whilst still maintaining their knack     *
*   for producing classic rock songs - unusual instrumentation, dramatic      *
*   angular structures and dissonant strings nestle between harder riffs      *
*   and experimental harmonies. There is a sense of adventure on this album   *
*   that is mostly a step in a new direction, but simultaneously a deferent   *
*   nod to the past.                                                          *
