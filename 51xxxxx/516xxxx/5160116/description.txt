E.S. Posthumus is an independent music group that produces cinematic style music. It is a form of epic classical that fuses intertwined drum rhythms with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean Philosophy which states that "music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements". The E.S. is an acronym for "Experimental Sounds" while Posthumus is a word that represents "all things past".[1]

According to the group, E.S. Posthumus was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. E.S. Posthumus' music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios; being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows.

E.S. Posthumus also wrote the 2007 AFC Championship theme for CBS titled Unstoppable.
