Jossey-Bass - Smart Questions - Learn to Ask the Right Questions for Powerful Results


Smart Questions offers an entirely new framework for creating solutions. Drawn from the authors' many years of research and field experience, the Smart Questions Approach reveals how the leading creators of solutions in almost every profession and walk of lifeâ€”including business, government, education, and even in familiesâ€”think and approach their assignments. The authorâ€™s holistic thinking approach shows how to use three â€œfoundationâ€ questionsâ€”focusing on uniqueness, purposeful information, and systemsâ€”which must be explored for every problem. These three questions, an essential starting point for exploring problems, in turn lead to other key questions that will ultimately create effective solutions.
