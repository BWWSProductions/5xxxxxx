Monster shows Steppenwolf trying to conquer the FM market the same way they had dominated the AM market, only instead of short rockin' hits, they began here to lengthen the tracks and inject social and political content into the music. Thus we have such tunes as "Draft Resister," "America," and "Fag." The title track was a hit in an edited version while "Power Play" became a staple of their concerts. This was the last studio album put together by the original five members. Better than average. ~ James Chrispell, All Music Guide
