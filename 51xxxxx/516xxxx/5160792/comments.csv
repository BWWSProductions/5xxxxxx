,dhn_dhk,2009-11-19T16:53Z,How to extract please.
,viderbit,2009-11-20T10:17Z,"Please dude, tell us how to extract it.
Rename of exe to rar - no result ?!?!
DOS archiver - no result ?!?!

You are joking with us...."
,ashok_satapathy,2009-11-23T20:50Z,"In the 12 part RAR archive the first part is missing.
Though there is a file named ""RADAR10.5.001.part01"", surprisingly it is an .exe file.
Executing it in DOS shows message ""program too big to fit in memory""
Renaming the extension from .exe to .rar also do not work.
Double clicking on any of the file shows message ""The archive is either in unknown or format or damaged""
Please post a comment on how to fix it."
