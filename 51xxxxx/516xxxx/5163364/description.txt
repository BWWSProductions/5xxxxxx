Your intention for this fanedit:The Intention was to put the Movie back into chronological order the way i saw it fit best. I eliminated all the scenes that traveled to far back in time. I wanted to Follow Freddy (Mr Orange) through the whole movie since the movie is based after him. I thought i achieved a much more fast paced movie.
