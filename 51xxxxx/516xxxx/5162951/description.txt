Alien Worlds (2009)

Scientific evidence shows that life may exist on two planets that orbit a red dwarf star. The search for planets beyond the solar system which are like our planet Earth.

The program follows leading astronomers embarking on an exciting visual journey using CGI animation, to explore strange worlds that seem like figments of imagination. Planets with iron rain and hot ice? Planets with diamonds everywhere? Planets with endless oceans of gas?

As the National Geographic reveal it gets even stranger still. Imagine planets with abnormal orbital patterns and planets with no pattern at all that drift alone in the Milky Way. There are even planets, called planemos, that have, in essence, been kicked out of their solar system. Some are so bizarre scientists could never have predicted their existence nor their characteristics. Naturally it begs the question: could life exist on these planets?
