Just a heads up to everyone else who wants to download thisâ€¦ from the description, I was expecting it to be the National Geographic version of the Aurelia & Blue Moon episode.  It's not.  Ignore 1st paragraph of the description. It doesn't apply (nothing about planets around red dwarfs in this).  The rest of the description is fine.  It's nearly all about various weird extrasolar planets.  Very little discussion about alien life, except a few bits about microbial life.

Here's a link to the official page for this episode:

Good quality video & sound."
