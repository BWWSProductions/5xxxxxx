The True Image Home installs silently and doesn't ask for reboots even if the first time you launch it you must anyway reboot to get it working....

If you, like me, don't love silent stuff running under the covers, you can open the Trueimage201.exe archive using winrar.

You'll find two files: one is the .msi True Image install package and the other is the silent script.

Open the script with notepad or another editor and copy the ""pid"" key (serial).

Then launch the .msi install file and paste the key when prompted.

I installed it on a Win7 image running on Parallels Desktop 4.0 in Snow Leopard 10.6.2.

I encountered problems in creating a backup because True Image hangs when it opens folders to select and save it.

But Acronis and other partitioning/backup tools don't like Virtual Machines.... so I'm sure is not an issue of this release or a Sanpork responsibility... ;-)"
