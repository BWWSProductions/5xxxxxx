,irishman1874,2010-01-19T23:37Z,thanks for th upload
,Hegemon54,2010-07-04T04:55Z,"VIRUS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,Coop_cola,2010-07-14T15:51Z,AVG found virus in the reading booklets so it\'s a bummer you can\'t use them because some goofy bastard decided to insert them with virus or malicious spyware.
,AJSaK07,2010-11-30T12:54Z,"Well I've just removed the virus with my Anti-virus, and everything is fine not problem at all, just use a good AV like Microsoft Security Essentials, and you will be fine.

Happy Descarga Amigo :)"
,rootsy7,2010-12-04T23:48Z,is this latin america spanish
,Swirl78,2011-04-14T08:48Z,Does anyone know if this is Latin American Spanish or European Spanish?
,amigo121,2011-05-16T01:50Z,To those of you who wanna know whether this is Latin American or Peninsular/European Spanish: ALL Pimsleur courses in Spanish teach LATIN AMERICAN Spanish.
,.hailey,2011-05-31T05:41Z,"thanks, "
,Tulkoju,2011-07-12T13:31Z,"Which files exactly have a virus?
Avira Antivirus doesn't find anything.
Please let me know what you've found before consider sharing this with anyone else."
,arkansawdave,2011-09-22T03:02Z,"I would assume this is European Spanish, because in the very first lesson, you learn the word for Spanish is ""Castellano"".  If this were Latin American Spanish, they would have taught the word ""Espanol"" to mean Spanish.  And I have updated AVG Anti-virus and it's not finding any viruses anywhere in these files.  I believe they are safe and virus free."
,arkansawdave,2011-09-22T03:51Z,Oops.....cover says it's latin american spanish
,YOUNGSUMMA,2011-12-23T06:40Z,IM DOWNLOADING NOW. I HOPE THERE IS NO VIRUS ATTACHED!!
,YOUNGSUMMA,2011-12-23T07:38Z,downloaded......so far so good!!! 
,boogenitez,2012-01-13T16:05Z,"Any further info on if there's actually a virus in here? I've been looking for this, but reeeeally don't wanna deal with that nonsense. "
,tcmona77,2012-02-07T03:25Z,i have a mac... so will us mac users still get a virus if there is one?? 
,tcmona77,2012-02-07T03:26Z,and this is latin american spanish right?
,Saloux,2012-02-09T01:12Z,"Awesome! =D thanks!!! and yeah I was worried that there were viruses in it too, but there is no ""reading booklets"" as Coop_cola said, so the admins must have deleted it or something. either way its taken care of! =3"
,pookeywookie,2012-03-19T04:39Z,Does anyone know where the ebooks to this is
,big1mate,2012-04-09T20:31Z,thanks for the up load
,VietItAll,2012-05-28T13:54Z,"Download was virus free for me.  Win7 Pro 64bit.  Up to lesson 8 and it's enjoyable.  Agreed on ""Castellano"" vs ""Espanol"" for the word ""Spanish"" even though this says it's Latin American Spanish.  Thanks for the upload and I'll keep learning more Spanish every day!"
,MiaLanski,2012-06-02T19:57Z,"Thank you very much! This works absolutely GREAT. One question, can you suggest how I can get the books for the lessons?"
,Timm129,2012-07-19T20:56Z,"Hello all,
I'm a little concerned about downloading the Ilivid program it wants me to do first.  Is there another way to get this file???

Thanks"
