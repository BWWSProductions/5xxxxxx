,ericv1984,2010-03-19T04:44Z,Gotta love when the uploader doesn't seed it himself.
,curfewz,2010-08-06T18:40Z,"A/V different per episode.  Show is so awesome, you wont care about A/V.  Watchable."
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-09-24T09:21Z,Love this show. I hope the quality is decent.
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-09-27T12:26Z,"Yeah, quality is difference on every episode. Watchable. Isn't there an actual DVDRiP out there though somewhere??"
,PeterSteele,2010-10-21T16:33Z,"If I remember correctly, there isn't as of yet, a DVD set of the seasons because the people involved have to get copyright agreements for all the songs used in the series.   Doesn't make sense to me being as they could obviously use the songs for the show itself, who knows.

Regardless thanks Adnox."

anyone got a solution?"
,nerd1337,2011-09-25T12:47Z,"Yeah, the solution is to remove your ghey-lite codec pack and install the combined community codec pack instead."
