In days of old, if your army had to take on a huge stone 
castle, there was only one option: bunker busting siege 
weapons like the giant crossbow known as the Ballista 
and the fearsome Trebuchet! These weapons hurled rocks 
and flaming kegs to cause mayhem and smash through 
walls. Today the siege tradition continues, with our 
military using high-explosives to blow the bad guys 
out of their foxholes. First, Gunny let's loose massive 
boulders from an ancient trebuchet catapult against an 
enemy castle. Then he gets his hands on some old-style 
gunpowder and recreates the big bangs that were used 
to bring down enemy bunkers, all the time instructed by 
committed experts who revel in the history of these amazing 
weapons. Gunny also visits today's bunker busters--military 
engineers who bust under, over, and into enemy strongholds.
