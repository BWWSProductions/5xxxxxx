,PTT_team,2009-11-16T04:09Z,"The P2P network was missing...
But it seems that the spectacular FXG is alive and kicking!
So this may be the Christmas Coming in November!
I have checking FXG accounts for all the sites I frequent every week since September, has been difficult these days ... for our BitTorrent family!
The Novel TPB, Demonoid has been down, Axxo is missing in action and the one who was always, in times of crisis,stood by our side, FXG, maintained a deafening silence...

The sun shines on the horizon once again people ... xD"
