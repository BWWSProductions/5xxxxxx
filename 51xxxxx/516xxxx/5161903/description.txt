Here are wanted updates for The Curse of Monkey Island - Game soundtrack:

01 - Intro AP - Updated long version from intro cutscene
02 - Prisoner - Updated for smoother track changing between track 01 and 02, usable only in updated version

--- Splitted

--- > Older version

--- --- > Intro Part 1,2 - Splitted version of older release (cut in the middle between voice and music part)

--- > Newer version

--- --- > Intro Part 1,2,3 - Splitted version of newer release (cut 3 times - voice, music, voice (3rd part start with Fire!))

Splitted version of newer release needs updated 02 - Prisoner for smooth track change too.

Splitted older version just "requies" old 02 - Prisoner

NEWS - Following theBillo request, I rerecorded two additional pieces Wally's Crying and Stan. You can find it in New songs directory. Add it to your CD2 directory. For smooth track change, I also make some edit in Beginning, Swamp in and Crypt, Skull Arrive, you may replace it if you want to listen to this without hard track changes. 

Feel free to add any comment or request to this album.
