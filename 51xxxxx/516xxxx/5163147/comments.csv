*Run the .exe.
When it's done it restarts the computer and it's activated. So simple, so good :)

,Runtime_Error,2010-08-11T10:08Z,"The crack works depending on your motherboard.
I've used this crack 8 months ago on one home brew system and it's still activated and able to do updates.
I've also a home brew system that the crack activates and when you update, it says not genuine.
And also EVERY Dell system I've installed the crack on still says not genuine.
So it all depends on your system, You'll have better luck with it working on most home brew systems, other then OEM."

,kevvvbot,2011-03-10T06:46Z,"Help! Computer keeps restarting after activators!
I've used these activators before in the past and they've worked, but now it's doing something funky...

Purchased the new Apple 2011 15"" MBP (quad-core) and bootcamp'd it using a Windows 7 64-bit install dvd.
First thing I did was pop in its Mac OSX disk for the bootcamp drivers. Haven't done any windows updates yet (I know to hide the 1033 update).

Went ahead and used the 'Windows 7 Loader 1.6.9 by Daz' default install, but after the Apple restart BAHHH sound it just keeps restarting and restarting and restarting.

Managed to get back into windows desktop reading the 'How to recover Windows.txt' that comes in the Notes folder from the torrent on a different computer.
I've also tried the other 2 activators, but it keeps reverting back to the restart/restart/restart behavior!

Has anyone else run into this restart behavior on a bootcamp'd MBP? Any solutions? HELP!"

,notalegend,2011-05-11T16:08Z,"@kevvvbot I had problems using the activator on a MacBook Pro. I chose to repair the boot record as the activator was causing a slow start and did not really work all it did was remove WAT and the watermark my Windows still remains unactivated. To remove the activator and hopefully solve your problem do the following:

1.Boot from Windows CD in Bootcamp
2. When the Install Windows screen comes up choose instead to repair windows from the bottom left.
3. Choose to user command prompt
4. Input the following commands pressing enter after each one:

bootsect.exe /nt60 all
bootrec /fixmbr
bootrec /fixboot
bootrec /rebuildbcd

This should hopefully work. Unfortunately I don't think the activators work too well with MBPs and you're best best is to find a pre-activated version and run a clean install.

I hope this helps."
