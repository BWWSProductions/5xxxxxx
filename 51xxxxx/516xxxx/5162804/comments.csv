,soundscape,2009-11-15T15:38Z,the bigger hard drive cost like $60 if you do it yourself and banned or not it allows you to install 24 of your favorite games right to the hard drive for faster load times.

If your console is banned you can't install games to the HD...thats why he is complaining.

,handlez362,2009-11-16T01:51Z,Can someone explain how to do this?
,chonomey,2009-11-17T20:54Z,"So pretty much if one have a banned console there's no point upgrading the hard drive right? 
Screw this upgrade then...I have a mod console with a 120gb hdd and was looking to upgrade to 250gb so now I'm not gonna be able to do it!! I do play online sometimes and haven't get banned. "
