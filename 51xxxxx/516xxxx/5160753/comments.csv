tested it with skidrow crack before I upload and it worked fine. 
Make sure you press the INSERT button first, then NUMPAD1-4. You will hear a SOUND for every keypress.

(these are not instructed, but you can also try;
copying the trainer to game folder and;
running the trainer first, then the game.)"
,Ortzinator,2009-11-14T23:09Z,"i did press insert and i did hear the enabled sound, and i did run the trainer first, but i didn't have it in the game dir so i will try that"
,Ortzinator,2009-11-14T23:48Z,"the game crashes when you run the trainer first and if you run the game first, it crashes when you push insert"
[V],C3NTURiO,2009-11-15T12:52Z,"that sounds interesting. i use razor1911 release with skidrow crack, so have no particular solution for that at the moment. sorry. 

but you may try to manually re-apply the crack I use. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5156373/ 

also, you can visit the original author's website (SI Cheats) at the URL on the torrent's comment to check if there are other people encountered similar problems and reported it."
