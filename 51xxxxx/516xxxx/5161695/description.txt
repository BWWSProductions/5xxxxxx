Clerks Season 1 Episode 1 - 6( Every Episode) 


Clerks is an American animated television series based on Kevin Smith's film of the same name. It was developed for television by Smith, Smith's producer Scott Mosier and former Seinfeld writer David Mandel with character designs by Stephen Silver.

A short lived series which was around for only a single failure bound year, but still its cringe worthiness made it endearing.
