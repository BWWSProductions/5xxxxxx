,Alohano,2010-08-03T03:22Z,"I downloaded the torrent and installed on my pc effectively.  But I do not want to open it or get started until I know what the deal is re the activation codes and/or patches.  If anyone has successfully installed this program and knows, please let me know.  

I will gladly help anyone to the point that I have been able to get to."
