This is NOT my Save. I am uploading this file for those who, like me, downloaded the RELOADED release and found that because of the stupid Games for Windows Live that even with an account it would ask for the serial for the game which I could not provide. The game would then proceed to not allow you to log in to your Windows Live account without the serial meaning that not only can you not submit scores online (which is no big deal) but you also can't save the damn thing.

Follow the instructions included with this file and you can enjoy the 100% save or just the ability to save.


There is probably another way around the whole not being able to save issue but this was the solution I found after surfing around for a few minutes.
