,giacaman,2010-07-06T21:41Z,"how i can open the file after downloading the torrent!! its Iso file? says insert dvd to burn when i try to open, i dont need to burn i just want to watch it in my pc!"
,XGamer95,2010-08-04T23:23Z,"@giacaman This is an ISO file that is meant to be burnt to a DVD and played in a DVD player. If you want to watch the movies on your computer, look for a DVDrip. If you sort by seeders when searching ""transformers revenge of the fallen"" (remove the quotes) it should be the first one."
,XGamer95,2010-08-04T23:25Z,Please seed guys. I promise to seed when it's finished downloading!
,LastFx,2012-01-07T22:09Z,excellent quality for being compressed to a DVD5.
