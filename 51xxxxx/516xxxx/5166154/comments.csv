Could this be a new protection or bad rip?"
,sleepless49,2009-11-26T10:40Z,Had the same problem with several downloads of this game - any ideas ?

otherwise it freezes in the language menu"

,LuckyMartin,2010-03-13T12:15Z,"Anyone knows what helps me?

When I start the game I only get a green/black lines screen immediately?"

Thanks very kindly to the uploader!"
