The new Rogue Trader RPG. Not my own scan, harvested off other P2P. 

Has an ugly watermark on the cover and inside-front (because I used trial software to fix the page order in two-up reading mode), middling scan quality, and haphazard alignment. It is, however, what's available. A more polished PDF will doubtless surface eventually.

Meanwhile, enjoy. In the grim darkness of the 41st millenium, there is only war- and swashbuckling pirate accountants!
