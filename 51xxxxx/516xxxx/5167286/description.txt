Graphic Design Portfolio-Builder - Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator Projects

As the first Photoshop and illustrator guide to focus on building a design portfolio, this book fills a hole in designers' bookshelves. Each chapter contains a lecture and project on a graphic design topic -- from logo design to magazine layout.

Self-paced, self guided instruction is all well and good, but at the end of the day, most people could use a little feedback - especially when they're ready to build a design portfolio and hit the job market. Not to worry, this book provides actual instructor feedback along with the self-paced, individualized instruction in Photoshop and Illustrator that designers need. Written by the faculty of New York-based, accredited online design school Sessions.edu, the book uses the school's trademark project-based curriculum to teach essential design concepts with Photoshop and Illustrator. After a brief intro to the world of graphic design, the Sessions instructors provide quick "refresher course" chapters on the two programs. Then, armed with Photoshop and Illustrator basics, readers tackle a series of projects involving logo design, magazine layouts, illustrations, poster design, digital imaging, book cover design, packaging design and more. Best of all, readers have access to all of Sessions' online content and instruction-which means they can participate in real classroom instruction. They can even get expert feedback from Sessions.edu faculty by posting their work on the site.
