Her magical new album, Sentir, is her most mesmerising accomplishment so far, and will surely find a place on many a record of the year list in the coming months. --Sunday Times 

Each of her albums has its unique character. This new one is her most interesting yet, benefiting from a wide range of influences brought in through her accompanying ensemble. --Scotsman

The young Israeli singerâ€™s explorations of the links between flamenco and her ancestral Sephardic Jewish tradition have been marred in the past by her over-strident vocal delivery. Here she teams up with in-demand Spanish producer Javier Limon, who coaxes a far more sensitive performance out of her. Delicate arrangements make for a subtle and satisfying meeting of Middle Eastern, Balkan and Spanish elements. --The Telegraph
