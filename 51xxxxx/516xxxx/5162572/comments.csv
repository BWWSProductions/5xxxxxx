[V],Murlok,2009-11-15T01:03Z, Trusted djDEVASTATE2009  thanks to you and this is the best audio  so far :)
,ToxicHalo,2009-11-15T03:02Z,I must be listening to a different audio from all of you guys cos' this one still sucks as far as my ears are concerned. It's just a exact copy of the piss poor audio that everyone else has. Murlok has just ripped someone elses shite copy and put it up in his name.
,EnemyDrone,2009-11-15T03:31Z,Yeah I agree same crappy audio..What the hell is everyone hearing exactly. 
[V],Murlok,2009-11-15T11:05Z,I have not ripped it I just uploaded a release said to have to have THE BEST AUDIO SO FAR.
,mkbarin,2009-11-15T19:16Z,The best so far 
,DrunkPollock,2009-11-15T20:19Z,"Well the sample sounded much better than the full movie. So my bad, still shitty audio. "
