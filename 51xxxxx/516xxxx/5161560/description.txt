When he arrives in Bangkok he quickly runs into a series of unfortunate events which leave him broke and helpless. Luckily he is taken in by a traditional Muay Thai camp owned by Apidej and his grand daughter Katoon (Julaluck Ismalone) and he is given a chance to make a living out of fighting professionally.
