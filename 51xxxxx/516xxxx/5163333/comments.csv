,masterjomo,2009-12-04T15:32Z,I have benn torrenting for years and have used this site off & on. I just now registered just to leave you this comment. I downloaded your file because it was the smallest h264. The video & audio quality are great for being compressed so small. It takes courage to upload anything on these sites & i wanted to say thank you for your time & effort. Great job my friend!!
