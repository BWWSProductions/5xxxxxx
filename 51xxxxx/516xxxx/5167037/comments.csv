,fredfan,2009-11-19T19:34Z,"Is an archival, uncompressed encoded version in the works?  Here's the conversation we had on the guestbook prior to this upload regarding compression and transcoding/encoding:

""Monday, October 12, 2009 07:05 PM ( ...)
Anyhow, has anybody noticed that there isn't a FULL-SIZED, UNTOUCHED, & ENCODED version of Saving Private Ryan online anywhere? This is one of the most popular movies of recent times with incredible staying power. It was even treated with enough respect not to be cheapened with a sequel. CAN ANYONE IN THE FRED CLAN GIVE THIS FILM THE DJ RESPECT LEVEL IT'S DUE?
[hjsn1]:
We can and will. Gonna be a wait for it. I will put it up uncompressed and with both discs if I can get it that way.
[hjsn1]:
If I have time I might even put up a compressed version too for people that want it that way but the movie is 169 minutes long so thats gonna be a lot of compression.
[hjsn1]:
Actually, why don't you guys tell me what you want. Go to the ""contact"" page and let me know. I will let you guys know what the outcome is.""

Anyways, thanks for the move in the right direction."
[T],hjsn1,2009-11-21T03:15Z,"fredfan: Elaborate on this? ""FULL-SIZED, UNTOUCHED, & ENCODED?"" "
,fredfan,2009-11-21T20:21Z,"hjsn1:  Well, it looks like you've uploaded the djfred DVD9 version we're going to see for this movie (THANK YOU!!!), so this all may be a moot point, but here's what I meant by that:

""Fullsized, untouched..."":  meaning that nothing (save trailers and FBI death threats) has been removed from the commercially released disc, as per DJFred's sacred methodology.  This is why folks come to him:  The files (and most of the structure linking them) found on the disc are the ones found in the torrent.

""ENCODED"":  Part of keeping files the same (NOT similar) is encoding rather than transcoding using a shortcutting lazy-man's one button push tool.  Fred discusses this at length in his tutorials and many torrent comment sections, and since there is so much on the net already on this vital subject, I'll let the uninitiated Wiki and Google.  

Here's a sample discussion on the subject Fred held on his ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" torrent:

Ganddi::: can you please explain your method of dvdfab plus shrink cuz if you are talking about what i think your talking about, Then please go ahead and download a DVD9 version of my movie and do yourself a shrink and youll see the quality you get compared to my releases.

Your method is called Transcoding my method is Encoding Completly different way it encodes the DVD to what you want in quality.

This is in no way an argument its merely a discussing as to why your method beats mine..
My door is always open to discussions, & finding new ways of doing new things. But i do believe you might have it wrong.

 VIP djfred500 at 2009-07-19 00:28 CET:
In the link below i have discussed why i leave DVD9's as they are and not shrink them. It might interest you.

aromero1203 at 2009-07-19 22:43 CET:
Id prefer encoding ive used freds method and dvd shrink and i see a difference id prefer freds way the dvd shrink leaves little obvious parts of the movies where you can definitely tell its been transcoded

 VIP djfred500 at 2009-07-20 06:42 CET:
aromero1203:: yes there is a reason why you can see in some parts of the movie and you cant others..

When Shrink does it work or any transcoding software for that matter, it perfectly distributes the bitrates throughout the DVD even the Menu..
Being able to control all that will result in better DVD's at the end.."
[T],hjsn1,2009-11-21T21:29Z,"I understand the terminology but what I was asking was how a movie can be Fullsized, untouched and encoded......If its fullsized and untouched it doesn't get encoded. 

And by the way, djfred and I use the same method to Encode movies so you can expect the same quality. 

Also, you don't have to quote everything I say. I know what I said and I did it. Thats not a very good way to get what you want. I could understand the first part where you asked if ""an archival, uncompressed encoded version in the works"" but you don't have to prove to me that I said something where I didn't argue the point. 

And you're welcome."
,.BlackIce,2009-12-21T10:46Z,"So could someone tell me how I can burn this?  I'm used to burning just the video file to a DVD.  Not sure what to do with all the files.  Help would be appreciated, one of my favorite movies of all time."
[T],hjsn1,2009-12-21T15:53Z,".BlackIce: The easiest way to burn this is to download ImgBurn, put it on ""write files/folders to disc"", then drag the VIDEO_TS folder in the white area of the ImgBurn window you have up then keep hitting ""OK"" til it starts burning."
,.BlackIce,2009-12-21T17:54Z,Thank you very much for your help hjsn1.
