,designzz,2009-11-13T23:40Z,"does this one has the music?
And no weird text in game like the others??"
,pulsarboys,2009-11-14T05:29Z,"Qn: ""does this one has the music?""

Ans: You mean the music track, if so it does not have the music tack in it or at least I am not sure. It is the original dump file for MWF2. If you just meant the music, then of course, it is there.

Qn: ""And no weird text in game like the others??""

Ans: What text are you speaking about? You mean the subtitiles? If so, you can switch it off in the game."
