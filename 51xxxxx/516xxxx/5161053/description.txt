Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (also referred to as simply Modern Warfare 2) is a 
first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Officially announced on February 11, 2009, the game was released worldwide on November 10, 2009. It is the sixth installment of the Call of Duty series, and the direct sequel to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, continuing along the same storyline.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was released in conjunction with two other Call of Duty games: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Mobilized for the Nintendo DS, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex, a port of Call of Duty 4 adapted by Treyarch for the Wii console. In addition, a comic book series based on one of the game's characters will also be produced, entitled Modern Warfare 2: Ghost.

The game sold approximately 4.7 million copies at launch in North America and the United Kingdom, making it the biggest launch in history across all forms of entertainment.

Gameplay
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Campaign:
========

Similar to previous games in the series, the player takes on the role of various characters during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective can change from one character to another between missions.

Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the HUD, which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives require that the player arrives at a checkpoint, while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. The player is often accompanied by friendly troops, who cannot be issued orders. Laptop computers containing enemy intelligence appear throughout the campaign, and can be collected to unlock game bonuses.

Mission settings in the game include Afghanistan, Rio de Janeiro, Siberia and Washington D.C.

Note:
=====

This release is fully tested. I have installed and played the entire solo game. No problems whatsoever. It was a great experience.

You can play solo and co-op single player, but not the multi-player. For playing multi-player game, you need to have a valid STEAM account. If you insist on it go grap it for $59. 

This is a reloaded version. You get to enjoy the full version of the game. I only take the credit of compiling the files to make it into a STEAM-free version. Credit for the content goes to the original uploader.

Enjoy!
