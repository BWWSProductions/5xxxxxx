,turnipbed711,2009-11-25T12:26Z,nice dude. episode 3 is available but can't get any of these outside the us for some stupid reason. any chance you could upload any more?
,crazydon,2010-06-12T17:04Z,Thanks man.  Dethklok is the ultimate metal band.  Anyone know where one could get the rest of season 3 though?  Doesn't seem to be a lot out there.  Thanks!
,scy114,2010-07-21T07:08Z,crazydon- the reason there's not much of season 3 out is because we're still in the middle of the season being released.
