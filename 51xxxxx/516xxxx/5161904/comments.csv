,zeeowl,2009-11-15T17:02Z,Wow!  174 seeders after only 1 day!  Thanks for helping out everyone.  Guess I wasn't the only one who had trouble finding this. :P

I just tried iSerial Reader on my PowerMac G3 running 10.4.9, and it works fine."
,zeeowl,2009-11-17T18:05Z,"Yup, I love the new interface in iSerial Reader.  Much more user-friendly.  I wouldn't go back to SerialSeeker... and couldn't even if I wanted to. :D"
