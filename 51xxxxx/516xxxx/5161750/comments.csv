,iPlunder,2011-03-23T09:02Z,"I just registered so I could tell kingdomzz and all these other assholes what a stupid bunch of cocksuckers they are for putting all that ASCI BULLSHIT in the descriptions.

GROW THE FUCK UP and post a NORMAL description that is actually useful to others, or DON'T POST AT ALL!

Your ASCI crap looks like a 3-year old got hold of your keyboard!

I don't give a fuck about all you flamers, 'cause I'm sure there's MILLIONS of people who agree with me!

Thanks for posting, but I'll download from someone who can post a REAL description, not some CHILDISH BULLSHIT!"
