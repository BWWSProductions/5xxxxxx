Love. Honor. Power. Fear of death... People live for all

kinds of reasons. Life becomes the ultimate battle when

all you're living for is revenge. Joshua (Oscar winner

Cuba Gooding Jr.), a hard-nosed collector for a ruthless

mob boss (Miguel Ferrer), lives in a world filled with

brutal violence and beautiful women. But when he finds

himself in the middle of a power struggle with the most

dominant drug lord in the business (Harvey Keitel)

Joshua knows that one false move could cause everything

to come crashing down. Packed with intense action and

gripping suspense, this explosive tale of vengeance shows

how just one wrong turn can lead to a dead end
