Hey Guys! So we finally finished our first community playlist. I know a lot of you guys have been anxiously waiting for this one and have been much more excited about this rather than the monthly Indie/Rock playlist I upload. Have really been enjoying everyones selections and I hope you guys enjoy it too.

For those of you who have just come across this or not sure how it works... This playlist was put together by the members at www.BlalocksIRP.com each member had the opportunity to post one song they would like to be included on the list. Once the list surpassed 100 tracks I uploaded it here. I am now accepting submissions for the second community playlist. You can submit your song here:

Much thanks to everyone who submitted. Looking forward to the next one and sharing the December Indie/Rock Playlist with you guys.
Be on the lookout for a best of 09 playlist soon as well!
