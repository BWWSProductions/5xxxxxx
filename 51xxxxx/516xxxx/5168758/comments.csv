[V],Murlok,2009-11-18T19:08Z,I you like it you can always help me seed:)
,Derc,2009-11-18T20:21Z,@Murlok: Thanks for sharing! I will help seed for a couple of days. I am wondering if this will work with the US version considering the region check in the reloaded expansion release prevents US from using it?
,gamergames,2009-11-18T20:45Z,It dont work for me! i have a error. The Gameregio is not for this update. please help!!!
[V],Murlok,2009-11-18T20:55Z,Derc  donÂ´t know not play Sims but its a scene release and not big so take a go at it:)
,Derc,2009-11-18T21:06Z,"Yes its done and I am about to try it, Ill post back after i try it. I actually dont play this game, my wife does LOLOLOL... so she should be happy. It is her favourite and I'd like to try the expansion for her when we get a working multi. My main goal here is to get the crack and update together... so she dont scratch her disc. I will wind up buying the damn exp anyways as its her favourite."
,Derc,2009-11-18T21:12Z,"Okay I've tried it on hers, Got the (wrong region code error) :/

US version will not work with this.
DAMN.

I will however help seed a few more copies."
,Derc,2009-11-18T21:19Z,I am wondering... If I can use this crack with the US official patch? I'll bet the version numbers are different. :/ ???
,Derc,2009-11-18T21:39Z,"Well apparently this is not intended even for US release. The Official site is only listing patch 1.4 for US. This is 1.6.6. My region code is ""1"" btw. If it has anything to do with NTSC."
[V],Murlok,2009-11-18T22:02Z,Looked all over the web and .nfo the same so canÂ´t help you but think this is from Germany so try code for that country but not know sorry:( Maybe better I delete it if nobody know how to use it:
[V],Murlok,2009-11-18T22:44Z,I found the  1.6.6 Patch here  http://www.patches-scrolls.de/sims3.php maybe use this and  and after that use the crack and the crack is as I see USA/English Thats it .
,Derc,2009-11-19T03:39Z,"@Murlok: The problem as I am reading from the official forums, The official patch is shit again! LOLOLOL way to go EA! Another patch for Sims 3 that is crap... Simmers are having to delete files to get it to work and thats IF you get it to work provided mister ""X"" simmer is followed correctly. Most are saying the 1.6 patch is messing up their game to violent desktop crashes or even worse ""BLACK SCREENS"" Some is due to a much needed driver update for the game, others because they have to delete certain files to get this to run anywhere descent. Then they still need the Driver update. 

@Murlok: I agree with your location for the update, however, EA has taken down the official update due to these problems again. So the site you linked is the correct update... I have my update for Vampire: the masquerade/bloodlines from there... but ea has admitted the update is junk. Even though the update in this torrent is for UK/??? the update is the problem in the first place... My wife is on the original release and Ill leave her to that , she begs me not to ruin her game as it is playing fine without any updates. AND KEEP IN MIND... hers is a real RETAIL copy. I'll keep the cracked files and try it on my pc tomorrow, I'll just delete the game anyway, and yes I have done a complete backup on hers to try it, she is just ""nervous"" as this is her baby of games. LOLOLOLOL... I'll try on mine tomorrow."
,ab5191,2009-11-19T04:48Z,does this work with Razor1911's Sims 3?
,JHomer51,2009-11-19T06:02Z,"Sorry but I felt like I had to comment. I did a clean install of the game. I ran the 1.0.631 to 1.6.6 update patch. Replaced the original TS3.exe with the one provided here. Ran the game and it worked perfectly. I don't get why all of you are saying that this version is not compatible. Maybe everyone should try doing a clean install of the game like I did. It worked for me... Anyway, thanks to whoever did this."
,Derc,2009-11-19T18:32Z,@JHomer51: Which version do you have? Razor1911? RELOADED? Or a retail version? Mine is the US retail and this is incompatible to the region I bought mine in. (US)
,JHomer51,2009-11-19T23:40Z,"I believe I have Razor's release. But I guess for those of us who care having the latest patch it's irrelevant now as another patch was released yesterday which fixes a save issue. And to be honest, I feel like this patch makes the game run slower in my machine :("
,mega921,2009-11-20T12:47Z,doesnt work with Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED 
,VELiUX,2009-11-20T14:52Z, Nice Works! :)
,ab5191,2009-11-21T03:11Z,I think it will work with Razor1911's one as long as you don't use Razor's crack and update it through the uncracked Original.
,ModernTerms16,2009-11-24T21:49Z,"Yeah hey, I am trying to install the latest update for sims 3, but it won't let me. It just says  update error: invalid file found.

Help! What do I do?
Btw, I have Razor1911, how do I update it through an uncracked Original."
,pistol-mike,2009-11-27T05:00Z,4 ppl wit the region code error u can change the region code just go to registry editor then hkey_local_machine then software then sims then sims 3 then double click sku and change the value to 1 or 2 for most ppl if still dont work change from 1-7 until it dose good luck:-)

,blondyblond,2009-11-29T11:40Z,"Is this  the patch + crack for sims3 world adventures?
Cause I've got version 2.0.86.002002 (pc)have error code 16 by saving my houses etc.
I'm from Holland and got the dutch languages by sims 3 WA or is it only for US/english?"
,lxl3lindxl,2009-12-01T11:25Z,"Patch say's I don't have the game installed.

I downloaded Razor, used MagicISO to extract the files to a document folder, then extracted the update file and got 2 out of it, and since I haven't done any patches or updates so I figure I need to click update Sims3_1.6.6.002002_from_1.0.631.00002 but it just brings a popup saying:

""The setup has detected that no version of Sims 3 is installed""
""This update requires that a previous version of the application be installed.""

what am I missing?"
,ModernTerms16,2009-12-04T02:54Z,"OMG!!! I frecking got it to work! 
Just reinstall the game and update it. (But you have to have the EA Download manager).
Thanks For this update! =)"
,brianthegamer,2009-12-04T20:08Z,"don't download this, didn't work for me, download Razor1911. it worked for me in vista."
,Dubiousmiles,2009-12-09T04:10Z,Can you Just Mount It Or No?
,YasRod,2009-12-10T05:23Z,"I GET AN UPDATE ERROR: INVALID FILE FOUND MESSAGE WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE ITS DONE ISTALLING.. HELP N E 1 PLEASE, I HAVE GameVersion = 1.0.615.00107"
,Samuelio,2010-02-14T10:23Z,"Right, someone help me..
..i've downloaded the sims 3 off razor1911 maxspeed.
..i've downloaded this update.
..i've downloaded world adventures.

How to install this update? anyone?"
,Magiskmolekyl,2010-02-28T19:02Z,"Need just a little help here!

So I've installed Sims3,Sims3-WA and Sims3 High end loft.
Got the problem where EA is not sure about the validity of the disc, or can't verify it?
My original Sims3 is from the store, and the rest is from PB.
Could anyone give me a short breifing on how to fix this?

Thanks"
,tonusa14,2010-03-03T18:35Z,"okay so i downloaded razor1911 maxspeed and When i try to play it it says invalid disk... so this patch is going to fix that? and also i downloaded the torrent and i dont understand hoe to use it, its just a list of r files??????"

,Lilochiic,2011-01-31T16:01Z,"guys.. you have to extract the r files using winrar
after you've done that, you should get the  file to update."
,Julielzm,2011-06-28T12:21Z,"I get the same problem, it works up until I try to enter Sunset Valley. Anyone know why?"
