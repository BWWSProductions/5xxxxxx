very good movie and quality.

In 2012, the United States economy collapses. Unemployment and crime rates shoot through the roof. The imprisoned population becomes so vast that private corporations buy the prisons and run them for profit. In Terminal Island Prison, Death Race, a gladiator-like fight-to-the-end competition is held to raise funds. It becomes the most-watched television event around the world.
