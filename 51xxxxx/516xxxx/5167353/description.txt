Contains two complete Guy (ã‚¬ã‚¤) adventures!!

Guy is just one of those misunderstood, lovable fellows who just happens to be one of the fiercest soldiers of fortune youâ€™re ever seen â€¦ and his alter ego is even worse! Thankfully he has his sexy partner to keep him in line. They could however, be the only thing that can battle Dr. Vail and survive!

A simple salvage operation turn into a nightmare journey to the Prison Planet Geo; where evil warden Helga has built an illegal empire based on slavery and exploitation. Dr. Vail, also a resident of Planet Geo, has discovered a new process to turn the inmates in vicious monsters. The appetites of the monsters and Helgaâ€™s own insanity transform Geo in a literal hell but Guy and Reina know just how to handle itâ€¦
