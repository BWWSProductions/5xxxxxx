Who would of expected that from an 'underground' torrent site? with all those 9/11 documentaries and info on Demonoid and they ban me over these?  Not so much as an email... I did nothing but support them, but fuck them now... The next time I connect to their server it will be in a million session DOS attack.. *jk* I wouldnt waste my time on their POS tracker thats always breaking anyways...

My Message to Demonoid:

fuck you demonoid, fuck you in the ass. 
You can all go eat a bowl of dick."
