,28336x,2009-12-09T03:04Z,Hey guys I'm a big fan of Jak and Daxter. This is kind of a cry for help from you guys if you can help. I've looked for weeks for a way to put all these PAL torrents into play with my ps2. Do I just burn on a DVD at 4x speed and play it on my PS2? I don't have a modchip thingy and cant find a proper download of swapdisk. Any help on how to play this on my PS2 after the download would be appreciated to the maximum. 
,gamerguy1,2009-12-09T10:27Z,sorry 28336x you are out of luck:(either get your ps2 chipped or buy an original swap disk cuz these are the only way that you gonna get to play this game.If you can't do either of these then go and buy an original dis of this game.i am sorry but you have to do one of these ways:(
,28336x,2009-12-09T20:16Z,"Thanks, gamerguy. I'll wait till next paycheck so I can order the swapdisk's online. Have fun, good seed."

,odin1904,2010-01-24T19:03Z,"question, I have hd loader for my ps2, Is it possible to download this, and put it onto the hard drive? or do i need to have it modded with a chip? i can now copy any game onto my ps2 and play, but have to have the original to do so, so if i can download then burn then copy would be awesome.save money on renting it."
