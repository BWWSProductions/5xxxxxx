,80sSlashersRule,2010-08-07T14:37Z,"there is a ton of confusing shit about this series, they have different names in different countries."
,spt84,2011-01-26T13:54Z,"Yah, Zombi 2 is not a sequel. The movie called Zombi is actually the one called Dawn of the Dead (Romero) outside of italy. 
I guess nobody trademarked the title, or maybe they can't?"
