Nylon Pink is an edgy pop-rock band formed in Hollywood California in 2007. United by a mutual love for Guns N Roses, fashion, and all things pink, the pop-rock duo, who are Kaila and Kitt.E.Kat embody the Hollywood lifestyle, blended with a dose of anime and rock and roll.

With Kaila singing lead vocals and Kitt.E.Kat on bass guitar Nylon Pink just launched their new single â€œHello Dramaâ€ which is a fitting lead single as it is also the brand name for their newly launched jewelry line.
