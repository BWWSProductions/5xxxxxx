,7even11,2009-11-23T04:48Z,"thanks i was thinking to upload this for a while so good thing someone else is seeding it. i really couldn't find it on public trackers so after i finally managed to collect all episodes i shared them here.

i also have better quality of season 1...  will seed it soon enough. i will post link to that torrent here in description or something when i seed it."

,7even11,2011-06-14T12:38Z,"Yes, all episodes are in just the order might be different (air time vs. dvd order).

And once again if you download this then you REALLY need to get that other torrent (and seed it) because quality of these first few episodes is really low which the other torrent replaces.

See the other torrent too - it constantly has low number of seeders. It is here:
