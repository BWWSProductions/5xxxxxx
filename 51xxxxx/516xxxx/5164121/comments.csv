[T],V413HAV,2010-02-06T10:30Z,"Hey DUde, I Respect Your Uploads, But All Your Torrents Are Fake. You Are Fooling People Over Here. Majority Of Your Albums Are Re-Encoded Including This.

Guys, This Is 124 Re-Encoded Tracks. This Is Fake.
I've Checked In Adobe Audition v3.

All Tracks Are 15Mhz Freq.

FAKE! FAKE! FAKE!"
