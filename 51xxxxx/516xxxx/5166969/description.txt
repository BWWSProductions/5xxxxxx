D tour
premiere November 10, 2009

Pat Spurgeon is a drummer with Rogue Wave, an indie rock band thatâ€™s toured the world and released several critically acclaimed albums. Heâ€™s passionate about his career as a professional musician, and heâ€™s determined to not let anything stand in the wayâ€”not even a serious medical condition. Pat was born with just one kidney, which began deteriorating when he was in junior high school. He received a kidney transplant, but after 12 years, just as Rogue Wave starts to take off, that kidney begins to fail. D TOUR follows Patâ€™s search for a living organ donor and the myriad challenges associated with finding a viable match.

At age 41, Pat is faced with the possibility of having his lifelong dream of touring with a rock band vanish. Dialysis again becomes part of his daily regimen, raising the question of whether he couldâ€”or shouldâ€”even continue touring with Rogue Wave. After much soul-searching and discussion, the band members make a business decision to keep Pat on, adjusting their travel arrangements with a focus on his health. With so much time devoted to â€œdoing a D,â€ or dialysis, Pat begins referring to the bandâ€™s tour as the â€œD tour.â€

Dialysis does not cure kidney disease, and Pat is put on the national registry list to receive a kidney if and when one becomes available. In 2006, the chance of receiving a kidney from a matching donor is twenty-to-one and the wait is expected to be six years. Finding a living donor could shorten the wait, but finding the perfect match, especially within the U.S. health care system, proves to be an urgent, difficult and often emotional experience.

Featuring live performances from Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie), Nada Surf, John Vanderslice, The Moore Brothers and Rogue Wave, D TOUR chronicles Patâ€™s experience coping with his condition, and his fierce resolve to go on with a â€œnormalâ€ life despite living with an uncertain future.
