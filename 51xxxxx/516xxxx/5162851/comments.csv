because whatever u use to burn the dvds cannot convert the audio on its own, even with the right codec. what i can think of would be to use some thing like vlc to create an audio track in .mp3 format or .wav if u have a large enough hd. then add the new audio track when u burn it. most burning programs allow u to add a second audio track or even dub over the audio."
