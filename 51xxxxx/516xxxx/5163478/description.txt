Shirley Bassey -Live in Cardiff (BBC 1993)


This came off a BBC retail VHS so don't expect too much on the high quality meter. Try and concentrate on the performance of DSB ;-)


Also enlosed DVD covers (from VHS artwork) which I've tidied up. If you print off as is (don't resize) they will print nicely. There's a cover also for An Audience with Shirley Bassey (1995) which I uploaded previously http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5143496
