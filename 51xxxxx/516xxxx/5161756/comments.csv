Great DEViSE release, equal specs but smaller size than ViSiON's."

,3test,2009-12-12T17:52Z,"Thanks for the upload Raymond!

The quality is great. I only have one problem though. The video won't play (windows media player 11 on windows xp sp3) with the srt present. If I remove the srt file then it does play. This does not happen using the media player classic though.

I've tried downloading other versions of the subs but none of theme seem to work with this avi.

Is anyone else having this problem?"
