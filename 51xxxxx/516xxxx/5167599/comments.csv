,trickdaddy0024,2009-11-18T04:19Z,Keith Olbermann absolutely killed Sarah Palin today on her book of LIES!!!...After watching her lies after lies...I am confident that she wont win any trips to the White House in 2012...I dont care what Dumb Limbaugh says...She CANT win...Not on Substance anyway...END
,trickdaddy0024,2009-11-18T05:10Z,Just listening to Dumbo and Dumb Blonde interview ( thx Jho)...Dealing with Dumbo you can never get a real interview...I mean with the Hannity softball questions and this guy shaping the question to direct dumb blonde to the CORRECT answers...I cant stand someone just flat out lying...Dumb Blonde said the Republican Primaries were blood baths...Really...I recall John Mccain was taking extras naps while Obama and Clinton duking it out...But why is she over analyzing the questions? We remember she can see Russia from her house...END
