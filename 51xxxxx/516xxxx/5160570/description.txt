Release notes:

The wait is ova - for one of the most hotly anticipated new albums in recent
history, as multi-platinum, award-winning Def Jam recording artist Rihanna
announces the completion of her fourth original studio album, Rated R, scheduled
to arrive in the physical and digital marketplace on Monday, November 23rd. The
"Russian Roulette" video, directed by Anthony Mandler, will premiere in
prime-time on ABC.

"Russian Roulette" was written and produced by fellow Def Jam artist Ne-Yo,
whose long track record with Rihanna includes the #1 hit "Unfaithful" (2006,
from A Girl Like Me), their Top 10 duet "Hate That I Love You" (2007, from Good
Girl Gone Bad), and #1 pop/ #1 R&B "Take A Bow" (2008, from Good Girl Gone Bad:
Reloaded). In addition to Ne-Yo, other producers and writers on Rihanna's new
album include the team of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, Chase & Status,
Stargate, Justin Timberlake and more.

Rated R is the long-awaited follow-up to Good Girl Gone Bad (May 2007), which
contained the non-stop string of hit singles that began with the MTV VMA and
Grammy Award-winning global #1 hit "Umbrella" (featuring Jay-Z), then "Shut Up
and Drive," "Hate That I Love You" (featurÂ­ing Ne-Yo), and "Don't Stop the
Music." Good Girl Gone Bad spent 98 total weeks on the Soundscan chart, earned
cumulative sales of more than 36-times platinum in at least 20 territories
around the world, and spun off the CD+DVD package Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded
(January 2009) - which continued the string of hits with the #1 "Take A Bow,"
and the #1 "Disturbia."

Good Girl Gone Bad was the third album release in less than two years by the
21-year old Barbados native Rihanna. It followed-up 2006's RIAA platinum A Girl
Like Me, which contained the back-to-back hits, "S.O.S." and "Unfaithful"; and
her RIAA gold debut from 2005, Music Of the Sun, featuring the world-wide smash,
"Pon De Replay."

Enjoy!
