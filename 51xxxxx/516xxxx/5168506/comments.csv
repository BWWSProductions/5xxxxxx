Much appreciated as always.

A bit OT but is there any chance you could grab a series thats shown on Canadian TV if you have time? It's called Great Canadian Parks and its about various canadian national parks. I think it shown on TVO at random times. No prob if you cant though. I'm just grateful for the stuff that you do cap for us! :)"
