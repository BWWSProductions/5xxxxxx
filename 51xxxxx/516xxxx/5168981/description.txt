Lolz Rebirth

Korean Manhwa made by Woo.

The story is about a Vampire named Deshwitat Rudbich who gets back from his exil in limbo there heÂ´ve been for over 350 years.
Now he seeks to destroy the man who killed him and his beloved.
And thereÂ´s a lot more crap in the story, but I dont intend on writing it all down here. 
Go to wikipedia or something...

IÂ´m seeding this for a friend, so after he get it down, someone else will have to take over.
