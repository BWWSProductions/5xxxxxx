This is the â€œsequelâ€ to Flutter of Birds (flutter of birdsï½žé³¥é”ã®ç¾½ã°ãŸãï½ž), but it doesnâ€™t follow the same characters!

The miracle happens againâ€¦ in another country.
The son of an Englishman and a Japanese woman, our main character is Shinâ€™ya. Having grown up in his fatherâ€™s native land, he wanted to visit the homeland of his mother, who died when he was young. White snow covers the town of Kuramachi. His other hometown, the last trace of his mother. That is where his father and mother met and were married. And the time comes when Shinâ€™yaâ€™s wish is granted. His aunt Miyu says sheâ€™ll look after him at her church.

In his motherâ€™s hometown, Shinâ€™ya injures his leg and goes to a clinic. As Shinâ€™ya stays in the small, snow-covered town, waiting for his leg to heal, he encounters various young women. His encounter with the girl in the clinic who likes to read, Narumi, becomes one heâ€™ll never forget.
