Sid Meier is an authoritative designer of some of the leading Role-Play games. What does it take to become one of the most feared, successful, and revered pirates of history? Here's an all new version of the classic Pirate role-play scenario that'll shiver your timbers as you yell ahoy! Confront enemies on board ships, in seedy taverns, on the ramparts and even at the Governor's mansion. Wield weapons - or anything within your reach - as you fence against foes. Engage in fierce naval battles fighting single enemies or multiple ships.
