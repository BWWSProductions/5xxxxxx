,Solon_Poledourus,2009-12-06T22:09Z,"For those of you who have issues with this game crashing - Almost every professional review mentions that the game has ""stability issues"", and tends to crash. So it's likely not the fault of the uploader or a bad torrent, it's just an issue with the game itself."
,alby711,2009-12-09T22:18Z,is there a crack file that i need? i don't see any folder in the .iso files or in the .nfo file.

,P503C,2010-02-08T00:31Z,"Way to rock Groo, and brandsy too for the serial. This is a great, solid torrent. "
,ScorpioNovem,2010-02-28T06:12Z,"Ok sry, but there are some dumb ppl posting these comments.
Read the description guys!

You need to ""mount"" the .iso files with deamon tools (google it!) or burn them on a disc.
(If it tells you ""insert disc 2"" mount/insert disc 2, d'oh!)
The serial is in the .nfo file, I recommend using ""DAMN nfo viewer"" for that (google it!)
Slap on the update and find a crack (Google it!, or use the link Pottu mentioned ^_^)
If you still can't make it work get the original, ya scurvy dog!

Thx for the upload Groo!"

,Arrgh420,2011-04-28T03:45Z,"TorrentTester44:  They are the ISO images for installing the game.  The CD1 is the first disc, and halfway through the installation you need to unmount it and mount the CD2 image.  Worked fine in Alcohol 120."
,takinglemonsback,2011-05-22T04:56Z,"Great torrent, works fine.

,poo4532,2011-05-30T04:32Z,"Blazing fast dl, installs just fine, fun game.  Only problem I had was the installer crashing when I clicked on the button to change directories.

,TheTrueLM,2011-06-02T13:24Z,"That Pottu kid is a dumbass.

For all of you who are having trouble with the ""Please put the CD2 in"" msg, you will need the nocd crack for Sid Meiers Pirates!

Go to http://www.naxpgaming.com/gbw/dl.php?file=SidMeiersPiratesv1.0NoCDFixedexeEng.rar and click the download file link.

When it finishes d/l, extract the only file in the d/l into the default Pirates! directory. Then in order to play Pirates!, just click the desktop icon that the install wizard placed.

Trust me, this is the easiest way to make this torrent work, seeing how the uploader is a complete fail and didn't put a crack in this upload.

Good luck to everyone having problems. I'm thinking i'm gonna have to start making youtube videos showing how I make these stupid torrents work."
,shadowrun_lucas,2011-06-02T15:53Z,"Works like a charm, thanks.

Long live TPB"

,gotdeadmansluck,2012-05-17T16:19Z,Wow really simple to install just Mount smp-cd1 run autorun.exe when it asks you to mount CD2 just go into Daemon Tools and mound smp-cd2 onto the drive you mounted smp-cd1 then just resume the install when finished open the update in the download folder with Winrar double click the file then update and play so fucking simple no need for the stupid assholes and they're bullshit links :/
,DACreech,2012-05-27T06:34Z,"This is how I succeeded in installing this game and it is working very well.

I used Power ISO to mount CD 1. It asked for a serial number. brandsy posted RLD2-HAT3-HVT9-E598-A7F6-GQRE so I used that.  Then it asked for disc 2. I used Power ISO to mount CD 2 and clicked the pirate icon to finish install. I had to click it a couple times but it worked and I tested the game. It works like it's suppose to.  Thank you Groo the Wanderer for uploading this game. And thank you brandsy for sharing the serial number."
,AustinH69,2012-05-30T17:47Z,I don't see how someone got 2mb/s. I'm getting 2.5 kb/s. Might be the torrent. Might be my iPhone's internet(lol).
,cactusX,2012-06-01T11:50Z,"This game's fkn awesome. Thanks!
