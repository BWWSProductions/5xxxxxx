Please give LPCM audio, we are almost in 2010! MP3 is bad for the brain! The brain needs to listen to full wave lenghts and not shorten waves such as mp3.

You could easily add LPCM to this fine video, see how many people are downloading the HD version with good video, good audio is also welcome.

Please consider this. Thank you for your attention."

You are talking out of your ass. ""MP3 is bad for the brain""? Today's mp3 encoders are tuned to perfection, it's hard to ABX them against the original so long as the bitrate is high enough. ""Full wave lenghts""? ""Shorten waves""? Compressing audio doesn't shorten the wavelengths... in short, eat a dick"
