,Xaiando,2010-09-26T17:44Z,If you want to burn with subtitles i recommend stuff like mkv converter and such where you can add and remove subtitle to make a permanent avi file with a subtitle burned onto the image. And then burn it onto a dvd :)
,Giselly,2010-10-14T22:21Z,"where is the serial number? I dont think its written on this page, someone please let me know!"

,Rox0rsmybox0rs,2010-12-01T02:11Z,"Will this program allow me to burn movies onto DVDs? Because I had a program ""Easy media Creator"" It did the job but also screwed up a  few  movies when I burnt it on a dvd. What it did was put it on the DVD but no sound but when I played it in VLC player It played fine. I don't know much about all of this and I am trying to learn."
,Goblikon,2011-05-06T20:06Z,"For anyone who's curious, scanned with Avast and Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. All clean."
