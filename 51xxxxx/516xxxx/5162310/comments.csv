,dusty-2011,2011-10-01T20:36Z,"Actually, this version is terrible. The sound is ok, but the video is of terrible quality. Everything is extremely overexposed (too light / brightness too high). This may look acceptable when viewed on a cheap screen with a bad black level, but on a decent screen it will look terrible. I suggest you download Heat [1995] 720p BRRiP x264 AC3 - ExtraTorrentRG instead, if you have a decent monitor / TV.
A: 8. V: 4."
