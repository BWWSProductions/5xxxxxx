I select all the files (except Readme.txt of course), then rightclick-> 7-Zip -> ""Extract Here"", then after a couple of seconds get the error: ""....\[Wii]Harvest_Moon_Animal_Parade[USA]\wii-hmap.7z.001, Data error in 'wii-hmap.iso'. File is broken. This is with the 7-zip program. WinRAR won't even open it. Any ideas?"

,mabeman,2009-11-18T09:15Z,Just using 002 fix didn't solve the problem but got it working when updated my ios249 rev 10 to rev 14 and then used loader with 002fix. Might be shit ios but with that all my games works (now including animal parade) :)  thanks to all
