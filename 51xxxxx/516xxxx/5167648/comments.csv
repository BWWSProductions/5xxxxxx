,kithylin,2009-11-21T22:49Z,"Quality's good i just wish bricktophd that you'd start releasing videos in actual 1920x1080 resolution instead of this 1920x1080 stuff, it looks okay, but Have to manually force aspect ratio to 16:9 to get em to play on PC/Windows on a 1080p hdtv @ 38"".

It works, but it's annoying, and NOT NATIVE."
,kithylin,2009-11-21T22:49Z,meant some of your other videos that are 1920x900.
,kmind85,2010-01-28T03:11Z,"Thx for all your hard work bricktophd! ps3-team is the shizzle. ! have looked everywhere and i cannot find a m2ts 1080p copy of ""Into the blue(2005)"" .I was really hoping you could help me out with that!

Thx Again and keep up the great work!"
