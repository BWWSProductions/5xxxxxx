,0doktor1,2009-12-14T08:10Z,Works like a charm!
,BluRayPro,2009-12-18T04:32Z,"CyberLink PowerDVD Ultra 9 is a nice universal player with Blu-Ray support that I?ve used a lot in the past. That being said, there is a superior universal player called ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 also with Blu-Ray support. It can even play Blu-Ray M2TS with DTS audio which is impossible with PowerDVD. 

After discovering ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 I uninstalled PowerDVD. I suggest trying them both.

[T],ADHDerby,2009-12-19T12:49Z,"For playing high-definition content, TotalMedia Theatre 3 is a great player, but it is'nt if you want to watch a DVD on an high-res screen with with the SimHD Plug-in. SimHD is ArcSoft's upscaling technology, turning standard-definition multimedia files and DVDs into high-definition ones, and it's very bad compared with CyberLink's TrueTheater technology.

If you can't play Blu-Ray M2TS with DTS audio, try update 2320:

* CyberLink PowerDVD is now optimized for ATI Radeon HD 5000 series graphics cards.
* Includes DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD with lossless output, for extra high quality Blu-ray playback via High-resolution Audio with 

HDMI HD-Audio pass-through.
* Now supports TrueTheater HD with CUDA on NVIDIA ION platforms.

Issues resolved:
* Noise during LPCM DVD playback."
,BluRayPro,2009-12-22T00:00Z,"ADHDerby:

I just installed PowerDVD Ultra 9 2320 and tried playing Casino Royale M2TS with DTS and the audio stuttered and was unwatchable.

Would you really want PowerDVD Ultra 9 or TotalMedia 3 for anything other than High-Definition content? I've always just used VLC player. I guess upscaling is a good reason but I've never tried it."
[T],ADHDerby,2009-12-23T17:51Z,"It's the main reason why I use it. The TrueTheater effects (TrueTheater HD, TrueTheater Lighting and TrueTheater Motion) are top notch.
About the stuttering: have you installed the latest audio drivers?"
,moncho5,2009-12-29T04:23Z,Thanks a lot ADHDerby.  No problems at all.  Good job.
[T],xxThugxx,2010-01-04T16:08Z,Yeeeeah thanks for this ADHDerby works perfect :D now i can watch HD with hardware support on my shitty intel gpu lol
,Hyperion888,2010-01-04T18:29Z,"Thanks for the upload, works great!

No fucking around with serials and cracks.

Although, it is keen to  go online (like just about all apps these days).

I  know its a dvd /blu ray  type player but  it can?t play ISOs or RMs.

Still a great upload, Thanks"
,mick449,2010-01-17T00:11Z,cheers mate  great upload will seed for a week yours was the only one i could find with no bullshit.thanks.again better than paying for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,visibility,2010-01-20T22:46Z,"Thanks for the upload but this did not work for me. I kept getting an error on startup stating that my graphics card (on my fairly new W7 system) was incompatible. I checked with the Cyberlink website which stated that my graphics card *was* compatible. The downloadable compatibility checker also gave it the green light. I uninstalled it and tried ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 as suggested, which worked like a breeze."
