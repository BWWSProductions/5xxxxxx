Preactivated Recompressed Setup:

* Installs the Ultra Version, pre-activated with Advance Audio Pack
* The MoovieLive and Movie Remix features are disabled by default :)
* Doesn't install the Google Toolbar & Cyberlink's RichVideo Service
* Pre-registered version -> No annoying Registration Reminder popups
* Sets the cursor hide time in Full Screen to 1 second (default = 3)


===================================================================================

Note about virus warnings: If you get a trojan or virus warning then it's a false positive! - I've added nothing!! You get exactly the same warning when you install the trail version because it's exactly the same setup. I only removed and modified some files to disable MoovieLive/Remix and RichVideo and to make it pre-activated!

To anyone who doubts me: Here's how to check the Digital Signatures:

- Extract Setup.exe with 7-zip and open the directory where you extracted the files
- Right click on an exe file, select properties, select the Digital Signatures tab
- Double click on the Signature and read the "Digital Signature Information"
- If the Digital Signature is OK, it means that the file isn't altered!
- Click on the "View Certificate" button for more information

===================================================================================


Install: Just run Setup.exe and you are done, it's activated and registered!! *

Download and install updates without losing activation and registration info:

* Note to Vista & Windows 7 users: They removed the registration info from the registry, it doesn't register during the setup. Just enter a phony name + email address, register it and the register reminder won't popup anymore.

*    This comes in handy if you selected "Don't ask me this question again" and
     want to re-enable or disable TrueTheater Lightning and Smart De-interlace 
     when playing High-Definition content.

**   Enables/Disables BDRegion, PDVD9LanguageShortcut and RemoteControl9 from 
     running at startup.
     Don't disable them if you're planning to use a remote to control PowerDVD!!

***  Run this one if you selected a visualisation that crashes PowerDVD

**** Disable_Visualization.bat totally disables the Visualisation plugin, run this 
     one if PowerDVD crashes when you play audio files or if you never use it.
