Description:

â€¢ On the day of James Kirk's birth, his father dies on his ship in a last stand against a mysterious alien vessel. He was looking for Ambassador Spock, who is a child on Vulcan at that time, disdained by his neighbors for his half-human nature. Twenty years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker inspired by Capt. Christopher Pike to fulfill his potential in Starfleet even as he annoys his instructors like young Lt. Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever even as the new version of it is just beginning.

â€¢ When the Romulan mining ship Narada attacks the Federation starship US Kelvin, Captain George Kirk substitutes his captain, who is going to meet the Romulan Captain Nero in his vessel to negotiate a cease fire, in the command of the US Kelvin. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife that is in labor; while she delivers their son James Tiberus Kirk in the hospital shuttle-craft, George Kirk crashes the US Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk grows up and when he meets Capt. Christopher Pike in a bar fight, he is invited to join the Starfleet. Meanwhile in Vulcan, the outcast Spock grows-up discriminated by his half-human condition. They meet each other in the Starfleet Academy, where Spock accuses Kirk of lack of ethics, cheating a test of command. The trial is suspended with the information that Vulcan is under attack and the Federation starships head to Vulcan, including the recently commissioned USS Enterprise. Kirk, who is a stowaway, foresees an alien attack and advises Captain Spike; however, the Enterprise is damaged and when Captain Spike travels to meet Captain Nero, Spock assumes the bridge and has a serious friction with Kirk after the destruction of Vulcan. Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded in the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by an old Spock that explains to him that Captain Nero blames him and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova. Spock explains that he had failed with the creation of a black hole with red matter to consume the supernova and Nero is seeking revenge. Now Kirk has to find a way to save Earth, the next destination of Narada. Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
