thanks thanks"
,fatshinobi,2009-11-20T03:04Z,damn why were the special features taken out? They have deleted scenes! Thanks for the upload anyway.
,acidstorm1,2009-11-20T05:54Z,"Thanks for the upload. BUT, you really should list more information about the data itself. This will play on my PC, but not my DVD player.

I'm assuming it's because it's PAL format. Doesn't matter to my PC but to my DVD player it renders the burn in-operable."
,NosTraDomus,2009-11-26T01:45Z,"this is PAL format.

If anyone is thinking about uploading anything, please include info, detail, or just basic info...like PAL or NTSC ....avi or .ISO

this is PAL format."
