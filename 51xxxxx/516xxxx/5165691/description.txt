The subject of occupation is current.  A comparison of "It Happened Here" with the recent television series "Jericho" is recommended.

   A further exploration of how "newsreel" footage was used in the depiction of war is in "The Victors" (1963)  by Carl Foreman  and currently available on torrents.  For me it is quite telling the difference between what Hollywood stars did in "The Victors" as compared with any crop of Young Lions today.  It's not only telling, it's disheartening.  "The Victors" is one of the great anti-war films.
