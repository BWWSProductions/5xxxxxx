Hits, released in 1998, was the first greatest hits collection of Phil Collins studio recordings.
 
The collection included fourteen Top 40 hits, including seven American #1 songs, 
spanning from the albums Face Value (1981) through Dance Into the Light (1996). 
One new Collins recording, a cover of Cyndi Lauper's "True Colors", also appeared on the collection and was a popular song on adult contemporary stations. 

Hits was also the first Phil Collins album to include four songs originally recorded for motion pictures (all of them U.S. #1 smashes) as well as his popular duet with Philip Bailey, "Easy Lover" (an UK #1 hit).

The album reached #1 in the United Kingdom and #18 in the United States. On 4 August 2008, it became the #1 album on the New Zealand RIANZ album chart.

There are other greatest hits compilations of Phil Collins songs. Most recently, a collection of Collins more 
romantic songs were released on a two-disc compilation titled Love Songs: A Compilation...Old and New.
 
A live collection, Serious Hits... Live!, was released in 1990. 1999's Turn It On Again and 2005's The Platinum Collection were greatest hits collections by Collins' original group, Genesis. 

Finally, Collins recorded many of his most popular songs as big band recordings on the album A Hot Night in Paris with The Phil Collins Big Band.
