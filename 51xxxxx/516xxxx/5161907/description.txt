American Pie is the title of a 1971 music album by Don McLean, best known for its title track about The Day the Music Died. The third track, "Vincent," is a tribute to the famed artist Vincent Van Gogh.

The original 1971 LP is dedicated to Buddy Holly[1], and was reissued in 1980 minus the track "Sister Fatima".[2] The original United Artists Records inner sleeve featured a free verse poem written by McLean about the late William Boyd, also known as Hopalong Cassidy, along with a picture of Boyd in full Hopalong regalia. This sleeve was removed within a year of the album's release. The words to this poem appear on a plaque at the Hospital where Boyd died.
