It wonâ€™t help. You canâ€™t get out of the way, you canâ€™t dig a hole deep enough to hide. The end is coming, and thereâ€™s nothing you can do about itSo why read this book?Because you canâ€™t look away when not just the religious fanatics are saying weâ€™re all going to be destroyed but the scientists are in on the act too. Hereâ€™s what theyâ€™re saying:

â€¢ Weâ€™re a million years over due for a mass extinction.

â€¢ The sun at radiation minimum is acting much worse than at solar maximum, and one misdirected spewing of plasma could fry us in an instant.

â€¢ The magnetic fieldâ€”which shields us from harmful radiationâ€”is developing a mysterious crack.

â€¢ Our solar system is entering an energetically hostile part of the galaxy.

â€¢ The Yellowstone supervolcano is getting ready to blow, and if it does, we can look forward to nuclear winter and 90 percent annihilation.

â€¢ The Maya, the worldâ€™s greatest timekeepers ever, say itâ€™s all going to stop on December 21, 2012.
