In Illustrator CS4 One-on-One: Mastery, the third and final part of the comprehensive One-on-One series, author and industry expert Deke McClelland teaches how to take advantage of the wide array of dynamic effects in Illustrator CS4. Deke explores Live Trace, which converts imported images into vectors, and Live Paint, which defines interlocking shapes. Deke also covers the liquify tools, envelope-style distortions, Kuler and Live Color, symbols, and 3D effects. And for the first time, Deke addresses two of Illustrator's least-known features, pictographs and actions.
