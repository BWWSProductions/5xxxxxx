Swiss DARKSPACE are actually one of the most talked about band in the underground scene...

Formed back in 1999 they released one demo and two albums in numbered and limited editions (500 ex). 
The two albums, titled "Dark Space I" and "Dark Space II", were packaged in some truely beautiful hand-made digis by the band themselves and then distributed by "Haunter of the Dark".
They quickly went sold-out and their search became a tough headache for many fans who had to pay unsane prices in order to get them through collectors markets.

Their cult status became obvious when in coincidence of the release of "Dark Space II": the band in fact decided to organise a sort of secret/private concert to showcase the new album.
A few hours after having made announcement for this though they received a vastly higher demand for admission passes than they expect and than the place could afford to take in. 
Maniacs where travelling to their Darkspace base in Bern from northern Germany and even Finland !

It's hard to describe Darkspace music: isolation atmospheres and a sort of terminal spirit disease rule their whole production and aesthetic.
Chris Bruni from the Canadian magazine BWBK dared to call them "the black metal equivalent of the Eraserhead soundtrack" and we think this definition is as perfect as enigmatic.
