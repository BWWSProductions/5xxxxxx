,_GKG_,2009-11-16T12:06Z,Watch out for Media Sentry ... they recently sent a notice for suspected Copyright-infringement after someone d/l S04E06 of Dexter ... better use some current blocklist to ensure they can't get any info ...
,pieszbob1,2009-11-16T12:17Z,"Yah use PG2 and toss this list in the lineup too!

http://www.iblocklist.com/list.php?list=bt_level1

Seems to be downloading slow :("
,pieszbob1,2009-11-16T12:18Z,Also PG2 is blocking a LOT of IPs for this torrent!
,torrenti,2009-11-16T12:19Z,Why are these always added with trackers that don't work?
,pieszbob1,2009-11-16T12:21Z,"Add these trackers:

Always speeds up my downloads!  Long list of open trackers and what not!"
,microcuts69,2009-11-16T13:06Z,"fuck so damn slow, i usually get speeds of about 900kb/s for this atm im gettin 1bout 9kb/s"
,elax666,2009-11-16T15:18Z,That?s what I?m talking about eztv. U rule my tv-show world as always!
,cmiller99,2009-11-16T15:49Z,i just dont get it. why add a torrent that doesnt work? i have added the trackers mentioned but still no download. normally rock solid from ez but this one is a dud for me
,Spetsnaz420,2009-11-16T21:18Z,"Why is it that I am constantly having to add trackers just to get any seeders at all. Maybe adding well known trackers to the torrent so we don't have to, is a good idea."

,coolndeep,2009-12-31T06:29Z,This is kinda strange... but the Audio in this SYS release is reall low.. I mean if I look at the bitrate it says around 130kb/s which is enuf for 2 channel audio.. but it is not loud enough for sure even if u play it on full volume! Just to let u guys know...
