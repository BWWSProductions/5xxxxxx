,mcdeltat,2009-11-17T15:48Z,"Scatattack...did you notice that the volume is called 'Redemption'? Have you also noticed how many of the characters are trying to put things right to make amends for what they've done in the past?  Seeking 'redemption' some might say...

If the show has been totally about Sylar getting his body back, have you missed Hiro on the verge of death? Peter saving the world 1 person at a time? Noah trying to actually help people? That wierd carnival? Claire at college? And how all of these things are slowly weaving together?

I admit the series hasn't been overly thrilling so far, but that's no reason for posting bullshit :) I have faith that the writers are going somewhere, afterall, series 1 and 3 were damn good, right?




thanks for the upload"

,vardman,2009-11-18T00:55Z,"Because, Thebrokenone - while I admit, he's not bringing his opinion across in the greatest of ways... he has a point. The show has continuously strode downhill.

Maybe he just has a ligering hope that it will one day be good again..."

Use this tracker instead:  http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce"
,RealIolo,2009-11-19T05:56Z,Thank You very much velvet!  That solved my problem.
,Occam1,2009-11-19T10:26Z,"@ scatattack and others
So let me get this straight, you have a beef with the direction of the series but, instead of writing to the producers, or stop watching it, you download it anyway and then you whine and grizzle like spoilt brats, as if you had some right. 
For fuck's sake!  You are getting this for NOTHING and you are getting it within hours of it being shown in another country!  Stop being such petulant wankers.
Thanks to those who upload these - it is much appreciated by those of us who aren't complete dipshits"

,BlueLionheart,2010-04-08T06:09Z,"You know I am actually getting tracked and harassed by NBC Universal because of this torrent right here? They contacted me through email with a cease and desist order for copyright infringement! How STUPID is that?? They show it on regular TV, for FREE, I watch it on regular TV, FOR FREE, and whether I record it with my VCR, or download the same episode later, what is the difference? Rather than track down REAL criminals, I am being harassed by NBC themselves to, BASICALLY, stop following the show. Well, you know what, NBC? You've got it. I have been sick and confined to bed and can't even walk because of it and the ONLY thing I had to look forward to were the few shows (quite literally 4 shows) that gave me inspiration to get better and hope for the future. And you would take that away from me? You are so caught up in your legality and nazi gestapo tracking crap that you would willingly harass the people that love and support your show? If you had any conceivable IDEA how much Heroes merchandise I've purchased over the years and how loyal I've been to this show... 

Congrats, NBC. I'll never watch it again. And Thank You for showing me the evil error of my ways. "
