The First ever complete replacement suite for Windows Aero for Windows 7 (and possibly Windows Vista... has not been tested on vista or 64 bit software)

If you are running Windows 7 and your hardware is not compatible with Aero or you don't like how much ram it uses try bAreo.

Current preAlpha contains:

WinFlip (A Flip 3d Replacement)
ViGlance (A Taskbar window previewer)
Transparent Taskbar v2 (Supports Aero Snap, Shake, etc.)
Transperent Windows
17 Themes!!!! 
UXTHEME Patch

And a simple to use interface

Please I just developed this application, let me know what you think and if it works

I mean it's only 18MB so just test it for me and let me know if it works, what OS your using ETC.


I will only seed daily from 10AM to 10PM Arizona Time (No Daylight savings time in AZ) So if you download and you are not receiving anything be patient this is my first Pirate Bay Release as well as a new program I just developed so demand I assume shall be quite low. ITS WORTH THE WAIT IF YOU NEED IT

Enjoy and happy downloading!!!
