I donÃ‚Â´t have the dvd, I am looking for it too

This DVD was produced using pictures and video material, collected on several trips to the crater lakes of Nicaragua. It contains unique footage of cichlid behaviour in the wild. See Amphilophus zaliosus hunt for prey in Lake Apoyo; amaze at the spawning and broodcare of cichlid species in Lake XiloÃƒÂ¡; observe the strange altruistic behaviour of Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, helping out the large predator Parachromis dovii; and more, much more.
