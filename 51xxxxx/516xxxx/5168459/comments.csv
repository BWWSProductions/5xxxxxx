300 leechers?
Fucking SEED, man!
I want these! I started 2 days ago and haven't even reached 10%!

PLEASE SEED!"
,hendrikk,2009-12-09T07:55Z,"It took me 2 weeks and 5 days to get, so please wait until after that time to talk about bad seeding"
,kidage191,2009-12-25T18:05Z,"Hey all...
Please Seed as i am only downloading the first 2 seasons, none of the movies or anything, but im hoping to get them done in the next 4-5 days...

I will download the rest at the end of January and seed for a long time if this can happen :) "
,hendrikk,2009-12-26T02:59Z,I will try my best
,m12345678,2010-01-03T03:46Z,"First I'd like to say thanks to whomever uploaded this and secondly i'd like to extend thanks to those who have faithfully seeded. 

As of writing this there are 100 seeds 3350 leech.
"
,m12345678,2010-01-03T03:48Z,also if you need alternative trackers to help speed things up copy this hash and plug it into google then find the torrentz site and copy the lists
,Mythicism,2010-01-04T23:55Z,"Thanks. I downloaded it in 8 hours. So it is a pretty quick download of you ask me. (2,3MB/s on average and with peaks up to 5MB/s= about 40Mb/s)"
,FieryAxel123,2010-01-22T12:11Z,"This is a nice torrent, but..does Anyone know where to find the seasons themselves in japanese with subs?
or even just the first season."
,ruby198,2010-02-21T19:34Z,"will seed after downloading,this is great :))"
,anat0myy,2010-03-03T05:53Z,"awesommeee.

unlike the 514 other assholes leeching."
,gino_j14,2010-03-04T06:05Z,mine's going so slow... no faster than 5kb/s... I don't have a bandwidth limit or anything... what the shit....
,hendrikk,2010-03-05T06:36Z,"If you have many torrents on standby, they will automaticly slow down the downloading on other torrents. hope it helps gino_j14"
,gino_j14,2010-03-18T05:20Z,"thanks for the input, but this is the only torrent i have going... and now it's like 0,5kbps... does anyone have an updated tracker list or something?"
,ashwin11,2010-04-18T10:48Z,gino_j14  I get also 0.5 kbs come on seed 
,hendrikk,2010-04-18T12:10Z,"have you tried what I have writen in the description?? It can help. And one more small thing, I have been seeding for 5 week from what bittorent says, and have uploaded 233GB. So I'm not the one to blame. (don't take this in an angry tone, and I know you are speaking to all of the seeders)"
,trapt87,2010-04-29T22:04Z,thanks! i miss this show.. it got dumb after season 2
,call_me_nobody,2010-05-16T21:58Z,"wasent it suposed to be more episodes? or is this only when tai and his friends was small?

btw is this the journey to get the medalions or is it the whole thing? with tai & friends and davis and hees friends?"
,call_me_nobody,2010-05-18T13:45Z,15 kbs??? u gotta be kidding-.-  it says it is completed by midt july-.- C'MON SEEEED GOD DAMNIT
,hendrikk,2010-05-20T20:35Z,"You know ""call_me_nobody"" there are 267 files in this torrent and about +/- 50 episodes in each season. This is all the episodes so far (that I know about). This is the full deal (so far, I think). But remember I found this on ""monova. com"" so if something is ""missing"", then don't blame me. I will begin too seed again, but have you copyed the trackers??"
,call_me_nobody,2010-05-26T07:33Z,"@hendrikk ok cause the episodes i know about is

1 Digimon Adventure
2 Digimon Adventure 02
3 Digimon Tamers
4 Digimon Frontier
5 Digimon Savers
6 Digimon Cross Wars"
,call_me_nobody,2010-05-26T07:33Z,and yes the trackers comes with the torrent
,call_me_nobody,2010-05-26T07:35Z,"and im now on 56,5% and layin on 0.5 to 10 kbs"
,hendrikk,2010-05-26T23:33Z,"Ok, this torrent is missing ""5 Digimon Savers"" and ""6 Digimon Cross Wars"" but it has ""Season 5 - Digimon Data Squad"". I got some connections problems, so I can't seed so much, sorry, hopefully I can repar it soon."
,bananacrammer,2010-06-07T15:03Z,"The problem with this torrent is probably not everyone is seeding ALL the episodes.  I'm downloading the same first four episodes of season one, one from this torrent and one from a torrent just of the season one episodes (same files), and this torrent has more seeders and leechers, but is going hella slower."
,YiffyFox117,2010-07-17T07:43Z,"Fucking awesome! It took me about a week with only client that PB suggests. (Bit Tornado) Use uTorrent if you want to get a better speed. Out of the last three seasons, 3 is the best, followed by 5 and last is season 4. nnThe real reason why I downloaded this is for season three... `cause Renamon is fucking HOT! (Yes, I just said that. You got a problem with it? Then take it up with my lawyer!)"
,SaatananRunkkari,2010-07-22T13:54Z,Bullshit!
,BryanSweet,2010-09-02T05:23Z,"Thank you! Downloading now :)

,simgamer,2010-11-29T12:19Z,Can Anybody Tell me if the digimon frontier series is in english or some other language
,hendrikk,2010-11-30T11:19Z,"""This torrent contains every Digimon Season with english dub."""

,GlorisSan,2011-02-22T16:29Z,I see there's a bit of trouble with this torrent... I'll seed it as long as I can but I'm only going for the feature-lengths.
,d-beezy,2011-02-23T18:17Z,"I tried downloading the entire file and it sat in my downloads for 8 months.

I cancelled the download and downloaded the torrent one folder at a time.

Finished in 2 days.

@hapiscalin

Digimon has 6 seasons.

@hendrikk

Do you plan to release Xros Wars if/when it's english subbed?

I'm seeding this by the way."

http://www.bakabt.com/145794-#comm403572

http://www.bakabt.com/details.php?id=156840&viewcomm=403573&comment_editted=1#comm403573

Bitcomet isn't whitelisted(lol whatever that means XD) for these torrents so you have to use a different client, i recommend VUZE, finished downloading season 01 in a day(also seeding it at the moment), season 03 on the way.

THANK GOD FOR TORRENTS AND BLESSINGS TO ALL OF YOU GENEROUS PEOPLE OUT THERE!"
,evilbunny6009,2011-05-05T08:10Z,"And by Jap dub/Eng Sub of season 01 and 03, i mean the complete seasons in Jap dub and Eng sub. to avoid "
,evilbunny6009,2011-05-05T08:12Z,Confusion LOL
,zazally,2011-05-05T13:00Z,Thank you for this amazing torrent hendrikk everyone please keep seeding so this torrent will never die this brings back so much childhood memories haha
,crispyman01,2011-05-12T07:00Z,"I've only downloaded 15.4 mb so far and my up rate is 65, but my down rate is only 33 kbps :( how sad."
,crispyman01,2011-05-29T06:17Z,"Great up, but the english movie was broken and when repaired in vlc, it was only 14 minutes long. other than that, excellent video and audio quality."
,Phrebbie,2011-05-31T17:15Z,"This torrent is missing a lot of episodes from most of the seasons. 

Episodes from Digimon Adventures:
103, 112, 117, 118, 125, 126, 127, 128

and more from other seasons, I mean, it's pretty many episodes missing. Kinda sucks."
,Altaadela,2011-07-23T16:15Z,"ok, so when my ratio gets to 5 im gonna set my upload to 1kb/s, im sorry to all those who seed properly but when i cant even have my ratio below 3 thats when i am worried, especially when i am at 5%"
,nickguyatt,2011-08-01T15:10Z,I've only watched the first season so far but for TV rips they were pretty good. Plus great series lotta fun.
,Schyts,2011-08-05T11:28Z,"Does anyone know where I can get digimon with Swedish speech?

,Lilhisty,2011-09-27T06:59Z,"I hear both good and bad reviews on this, making it kind of iffy. But hey, Its worth a shot, ill let people know once its done downloading. :)"
,P-NoyBoy,2011-12-07T06:56Z,"So for some reason the videos can't play even though I have the right codecs. very few can play such as the later videos on the first season and some, if not all, of the movies. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Other than that, great quality and everything"
,APPL,2012-02-21T11:50Z,"Im gonna go ahead and rate this torrent:

The Video quality for the earlier movies (1-7) is about a 6. Audio is about a 9
(of course this was the 90's we are talking about)

Movies 8-9 are about a 8 for video and 9 for audio.

and the last movie, doesnt work for me, I have all of the codecs for winamp, but it just doesnt play.

and the quality for the Seasons are excellent 

V:9
A:9

(Watching this again reminds of when digimon was the shit, way better than pokemon. Its too bad it ended.)

Props to the uploader. Thanks Dude

"

,ryoslayer,2012-06-16T12:48Z,Seeding! =)
,Shadow416,2012-07-17T08:57Z,"season 1 was perfect for the most part.
season 2 was near perfect until the last 3-4 episodes that was such a piss off lol audio cut outs in important scenes. And even worse terrible ending on the last episode due to the audio cut out at the end cuz it jumps to credits :(.

I'll be back when i watch the rest of the seasons

Thanks for the fantastic upload man. Will continue to seed."
