This program is still in beta, but works fine on my 64 bit copy of Windows 7-it should work on Vista x64 as well.  I tried other RAMDisk programs out there, but none of them were designed for anything past XP and ended up crashing my PC.

I'm going to use it to run XP in a VirtualBox totally in RAM...it works well with PortableFox too.  Remember back in the day when everything you needed to set up a RAM disk came with the DOS? aahh...
