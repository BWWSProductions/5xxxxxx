Im confused"
,zeldaboy,2009-11-17T08:55Z,"The program makes a portion of RAM act as a regular drive, so you can store whatever files you wish in RAM.  It uses your system's memory to emulate a RAM drive. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramdisk for more info.

I wish I had the dough for a solid state drive..."

,kanocode,2011-01-02T04:02Z,Well if I manage to load this up today I will seed for the next couple of days.
