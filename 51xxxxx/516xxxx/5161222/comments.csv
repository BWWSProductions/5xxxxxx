as for the usb stick thing. Microsoft just pushed out an update to the dashboard, you need this to play the game! get it before you play, always do so offline. you can download the update to a usb stick, update, use your activate iso if you have a lite on, pop in the game and play =)"
,hughes29,2009-11-17T10:56Z,just done the dashboard update and the game works perfect thanks
,brianthegamer,2009-11-26T07:27Z,does anyone know if this can be played on live?
,syfrett5,2009-12-05T08:41Z,Use abgx360 to check if it will go on xbox live undetected .... when u run the program and after you lauch the iso u wanna check ..... all the colored words on the black screen have to be green... if it yellow it may be able to fix it ... but it depends what version u got and if it is fixable
,Hosseal,2010-01-09T11:33Z,"Do I need to make dashboard update if I want to play offline? When I make a test by XDVDMulleter it says that the video file is broken, invalid or not present. What should I do?"
,Sniperzoo_PC,2010-02-14T15:16Z,"what files do i burn (iso?), and with what program?"
