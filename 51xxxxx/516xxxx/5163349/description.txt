MTV's reality series follows newlyweds Travis Barker (drummer of Blink 182) and Shanna Moakler (former Miss USA) as they lead their far from average lives. With Travis' punk rock style and Shanna's all American beauty, these sweethearts are living proof that opposites really do attract. Travis and Shanna juggle the rock n' roll lifestyle, parenting and marital bliss all while keeping true to their free spirited ways.
