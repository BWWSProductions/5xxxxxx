[V],-jonny-,2009-11-22T17:21Z,the tpb tracker went down months ago. there are a number of working trackers in my torrents.
,Dumbbanus,2009-11-29T05:57Z,link to 1080p version please?
,funnyname,2009-12-01T03:03Z,"for me the 'Magnet Link' doesnt work. DHT is not enabled for this I suppose.
I download via the torrent link ('DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT')
The result is perfect for me:
V : 10
A : 10

thank you -jonny-. Please support the 'Magnet Link' if possible."
,maolain,2009-12-03T11:54Z,What does the magnet link mean anyway..is it any quicker.??!

,BuckRogers71,2009-12-07T10:16Z,"Hi -jonny- Hi All,
Could anybody help please : )

I use to downloaded HD movies and never had problems, Great Quality(720p/1080p) no errors no pixels. But from recent days i have problems with the movies, with a lot of pixel interfering, particulary the last ones like Moon, A Perfect Getaway and Gamer (also Galaxy Quest), does anyone have a similar problem?
How can i resolve this? codecs... 
I have K-Lite Mega Codec Pack 3.5.7.

Thanks and Regards."
,poolshark1520,2009-12-08T04:17Z,Does this have hard subs?  I'm using WMC and VLC and there isn't any .srt file so I'm guessing.  Any help would be great since it's such a big download. Thanks.
,mparker20,2009-12-11T19:42Z,Why is NOBODY seeding this???  SEED PLEASE!
,Metalepsis,2009-12-19T22:52Z,This movie is great! Really makes you think about what price we would pay for clean energy on earth. Original and thought provoking. The subtiltles are in english and chinese. If you like this you should also check out matchstickmen where sam rockwell and nicolas cage plays two con-artists. Thanks -jonny- for a fine upload. 
,djchri,2009-12-25T18:50Z,"Anyone having problem playing this? It stops in the middle of the movie after 16:.....ish. I am using VLC, tried Zplayer and others, same thing happens on both.
This has happened on the my 2 latest DLs in .mkv format. Help anyone!!!!"

,Nerte,2010-01-07T12:03Z,"Subtitles DIRECTLY IN THE VIDEO. Wow, the guy who ripped must be really idiot. Otherwise it would be excellent.

Fail. Why would anybody ruin the watching experience like that? I want external subtitles so I can move them out of the damn picture little lower!"
,scott_karana,2010-01-13T22:57Z,"Nerte, you're the idiot.
MKV files are ""containers"", which store softsubs in multiple languages as well as raw video feeds.
You can do whatever you want to them, since they're software subtitles.
Get informed before making stupid accusations."

A shame? Well, welcome to 2010, the new decade. A singel Blu ray-disc contains minimum 50GB of space and soon everyone will have them. Your whining is the same as it was when DVD came out and you couldn't play pc-games if you didn't have the player.

8 reasons you'll love this movie: 
1) You are as scientifically illiterate as Sarah Palin. Even NASA complained about this movie. Moon advertises itself as ultra-realistic, and starts off by ignoring the fraction of Earth's gravity there is on the moon. NASA asked the director why they would harvest H3 (sunlight) from the dark side of the moon. He replied, knowing it was too late to change the entire movie, ""they don't want to disturb the wildlife on Earth by harvesting the bright side"". So, the logic is: Loose 95% of profits because of an absurd environment consideration while enslaving and murdering countless human clones to save money. 
2) You think a secret, gigantic conspiracy involving systematic cloning, brainwashing and murdering people below the surface of the moon in a facility larger than the actual base they need manned, is NOT a million times more expensive than replacing the one guy there every three years. For that reason, you accept the plot of the movie as ""realistic and intellectually challenging"".
3) You think it's only fair that the Nazi Overlords responsible for the Auswitch policy for its Moon branch, would let there be a simple and easy way for the clones to get back to Earth and make them and their employees face life in prison for mass-murder. They would also let there be a way to make a regular phone call to anyone on Earth. 
4) You're willing to accept that in the future, technology has moved on, but picking up and shipping a small H3-tank once in a while, can't be done by a robot, even though that's doable today. The only robot in the movie is busy being a mechanic, chef, doctor, psychologist and hair dresser, so it's no way it could have the intelligence to drive out to the computer-driven (!) harvester and pick up a small container. Therefore, there has to be a guy there, to make this self-proclaimed super-realistic, intellectual masterpiece of a movie possible.
5) You like watching paint dry, as long as it's accompanied by the same awful piano arpeggio stuck in a loop for two hours, because it makes you feel intellectual about watching something that isn't mainstream Hollywood. Like in any film school project run by a bipolar, self-loving douche, this movie turns slow pacing into an attention-whore effect to cover for the lack of actual content, successfully arousing all the pretentious sci-fi retards out there to the point of intellectual climax. 
6) You like watching two hours of behavior so absurd it can't be related to or understood in any way because it's desperately trying to fake originality, realism and depth the way a 5 year old would change the color of a car: with a bucket of paint and a brush.
7) You think a background as a partying asshole with a constant tan, bleached hair and shock-white teeth, doing nothing but spending dad's cash, in this case David Bowie's cash, until you're 40, sounds promising for a new director-writer. 
8) You think the following reviews are just biased by typical Hollywood action movie consumption mentality, because these papers always hire 18 year old football jocks to write for them:

San Francisco Chronicle: ""'Moon' aims high, misses badly. (...) Moon is boring. Agonizingly, deadeningly, coma-inducingly, they-could-bury-you-alive-accidentally boring"".

Wall Street Journal: ""I won't pretend to understand the movie's deep meaning - if it has one"".

LA Times: ""Ground control to Major Tom: Moon orbits an idea, but it doesn't go anywhere"".

New York Times: ""Ground Control to astronaut on the Moon, ignore our plot"".

Washington Post: ""Storywise, Moon fails to live up to the promise of its premise. There's plenty of atmosphere, but little gravity"". 

Variety: ""The story stretches a bit thin"". "
,xylolz,2010-02-25T21:10Z,thanks
,idrone42,2010-03-01T04:46Z,"paxe: because star wars wasn't made to be realistic, moon was. star wars is coherent and follows it's own rules, moon doesn't. but, of course, who cares if you're fine watching pretty moon shots and nothing else. "
,dkadc,2010-03-12T00:45Z,"Why is this RAR'd?  Why compress a compressed video file?

Sorry for being a newbie!"
,czejenesku,2010-03-22T01:54Z,"idrone42 - i wonder what kind of intelligence you have? and what would you say about 2001 space odyssey - moon has the same mood as 2001 and requires the same thing from a viewer - attention, intelligence and understanding. i can see your point on one way but there has to be something in 'moon' if it is considered in top 50 scifi movies of all time. for me its the best scifi film in years - sam rockwell is awesome, kevin spaceys' voice unrecognizable but brilliant and its a great debut for duncan jones, eager to see what he will do next. by the way the music is done by clint mansell so i recon that you also didnt liked his soundtrack for requiem for a dream or 'Pi'... i know you would prefer a scifi like serenity or something.... i see that hard sci-fi (the type of sci fi this movie represents) is too demanding for you: so dont even start to read Rama or Foundation, you wont understand it"
,idrone42,2010-04-19T01:51Z,czejenesku. you're an idiot. shut the fuck up and go play with your dolls.

_um, last I checked, the so-called 'dark' side of the moon is 50/50 light/dark. Same amount of light in the eastern hemisphere as in the western numbnuts.

Someone so smart should have thought about that.


I suggest you go watch some Hollywood explosions... I think you will find those more intellectually stimulating."
,darius2025,2011-01-05T07:14Z,"As someone thoroughly into hard sci-fi.... this is one of the BEST (not kidding) sci-fi movies I have ever seen.  Especially if you consider the fact that we currently have the technology to pull this off.
Havn't seen this version yet but this is a must-have for my collection.

btw... Rama and Foundation series' were frekin' great.

M - 9.5"
,drkstar,2011-04-09T06:02Z,"Rotten Tomatoes score: 90%

I'd take that score over the random mouth-breathers who score stuff on imdb. Even though that's a fairly good score, too.

So some idiot wants to pick out one scientific inaccuracy that supposedly makes this movie so bad? Go online and read the full transcript of the Q&A the director had when they screened the film for NASA. There were plenty of scientists impressed with the level of detail. Anyway, it is called science FICTION. Moron.

And in a further display of your ignorance- H3 is sunlight? H is the periodic letter for Helium, shit-for-brains. And it's found in the regolith (fine sand) throughout the moon's surface. In no greater concentration on either side. It's extremely rare on earth.

Before you start bashing a fictional movie's science, maybe you should actually know what the hell your talking,you ignorant fuck.

Oh, and your quote from NASA is more fictional than this movie is.

,HellFrog,2011-05-19T02:12Z,"@drkstar, I concur idrone42 is a f-head but one note ... H = Hydrogen, He = Helium.  I know you meant well ;-)  Long live quality Sci-Fi (not that shit they put on the SyFy channel)"
,AgentWax,2011-08-10T08:12Z,Excellent share!!!  LOVE this movie.  It's definitely one of those movies you have to watch more than once in order to fully understand what is going on.
