,bloodyjimbonney,2009-11-17T03:31Z,I've been at work all day.  Thanks goose
,VastLite,2009-11-17T10:20Z,"I hope this means no more stereo 24kHz usenet rips. Your rips are by far the best, none vorbis ONA samples out there (that aren't 12 hours long) so ""thoughts and prayers"" for your computer resurrection. I know you know this but we all appreciate your hard work and expertise when it comes to these up's. I look forward to your guide and hopefully we can start churning out shows as good as you do in your inevitable absence (Curse you RL!). But, at the moment, there is no substitute for genuine goose! My love for the show supersedes the audio(phile)fag in me. So I greatly appreciate this availability (none-the-less) which is better than nothing (and could be a lot worse (wma anyone?)) oh, and ""RAPE!"""
