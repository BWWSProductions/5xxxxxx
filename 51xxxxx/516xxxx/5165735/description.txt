Note: I lost my O&A machine last Friday. Dug out the backup this
weekend however it's got some bad RAM. I'm picking more up 
today, hopefully in time to catch a replay. I might not get them
up tonight, but as long as I get my rip I'll post my 64k and 128k
ups at a later time. Fingers crossed O&A faithful......

Note: Friday November 27th will be my last "early" 64k upload. 
Starting with Nov. 30th and on, I will upload the 128k vbr 
mp3's in the evenings. If you listen a day late, you'll be 
fine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,
you'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will 
be doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending
schedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.

I have also started work on a "how-to" of ripping audio and 
creating torrents from it. It's looking like it will end up
as a multi-page pdf with graphics and I will include the 
(virus-scanned) tools that I use. I want to have it done 
before my partial retirement - it's going to be fairly 
in-depth.
