Apparently there were two versions of this movie made in 1998.

This one has subtitles and is divided into four episodes.

Unfortunately it is in the .mp4 format.
This type is easily played by the better players, but when it comes to displaying the associated .srt subtitles it's not so nice.
Normally a series of episodes in the .avi format will automatically 
pick up the associated subtitle file. Howver with this combination
it is necessary to search out and select the desired file to display.

That is a small inconvience.

My wife and I prefer the earlier uploaded version of Tess even though
it does not have subtitles.
