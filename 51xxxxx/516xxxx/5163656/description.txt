Microsoft Sudoku is a version of the popular number puzzle game that is specifically designed to play with a tablet pen. You can also draw the values with a mouse or play it with the keyboard by using the arrow keys to navigate around the Sudoku grid and the number keys for setting the values.


You play Microsoft Sudoku like you would play the game on paper with a pen or pencil, except with a few extra advantages:

- You can write possible candidate numbers in a cell with your tablet pen or
  mouse, and then easily erase them when you deduce the correct number.
- You can play an unlimited number of unique games at three different levels of 
  difficulty.
- You can easily undo incorrect entries that you have made.
- You can use hints to help you solve puzzles.
