It is important to remember that you do not have to install each individual patch, you only need to install the latest.
So if you do a fresh install of GTA 4 you DO NOT need to install patch 1.0.1.0 and then patch 1.0.2.0. You just need to install the latest patch.
You should also remember that you will not be able to play online unless you have the latest patch installed.
