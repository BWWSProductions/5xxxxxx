,kf59,2009-11-17T22:57Z,"Thanks Buddays! I'm a long-time listener and so on... Since WNEW in NYC. Now I d/l and seed like a mad man so I can hear R&F in the car. I'm up to October '08, but somehow I can't find anything until like June of this year! I'm gonna miss the election, the Phillies winning The Series and ( I've heard rumors ) Black Earl quitting...

Can anyone help a big-ass brother out? I would pay for a compilation or if someone would post the missing months I would be sooooo grateful!

I can be emailed kfree2 at yahoo dot com"
