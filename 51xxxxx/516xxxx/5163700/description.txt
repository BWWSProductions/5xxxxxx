Shotei Ha'nevua, or "The Fools of Prophecy", was an Israeli musical group selected as Israel's "Band of the Year" in 2005. The band described its music as a fusion of dub reggae with hip-hop and dance music, with an eastern Mediterranean flavor. Shotei Hanevua broke up on August 12, 2007. Singer Avraham Tal started a solo career. Meanwhile, Gilad Vital and Roi Levi continued to play together under the new name "Pshutei Ha'am" (Simple People).
