,computerguru92,2010-01-04T23:36Z,i recently deleted a file that apparently contained a virus and was unaware of it. will this torrent bring back the virus infected file so it can be delt with properly 
,istist,2010-01-15T12:09Z,After a harddive crash and an idiot whom was supposed to rescue all our homevideos botched it up even more using a shit recovery program and then re formating the hard drive and putting back 149gb of mess on a 150gb harddrive i thought IÂ´d never se the  videos of my daughters birth again.....but this program really works....unfortunatelly it canÂ´t restore a disk thats been reformated but it can piece together info and salvage what already was extacted wrong.  I will be purchasing this product just to show my respect to the makers but thanks for this great torrent..../a firm believer of try before you buy!!!

,ruleoffire,2010-11-23T03:25Z,"Having an issue, wonder if anyone can help. Oddly i can get this to run fine on vista, but not on my xp machine which is where i really need it. It starts to open the program then gives me a windows error/crash report. Tried doing the install rather than the portable.exe and same thing except no error report.

Any ideas? I can give more details if needed."
