,Babygeorge,2009-11-21T01:27Z,"What a beautiful collection...

THANK YOUUUUU from Colombia!!!

=)"
,JackVanhouten,2009-11-21T23:56Z,Thank you very much for this wonderful collection of recordings.
,pinco84,2009-12-31T13:57Z,"Thank you very much, Glenn Gould is always welcome. And, about connection speed, I'm impressed: your torrent saturates my 5 Mbps connection.

Not to seem too picky... Don't you happen to get the same collection losslessly compressed? :D"
[V],n0b0dyh0me,2010-01-01T11:49Z,"you see pinco84... you're not downloading directly from me and there are a lot of seeders and leechers... this is the reason why you download so fast :)

with full bandwidth from me you would not reach 30kb/s

About the collection with optimal compression I don't know... I downloaded it from eMule as you see it now...  :)"
,gospelman,2010-01-07T21:55Z,"Thank you very, very, very much. What an unbelievable job."
,moksha77,2010-05-12T18:59Z,"Thank you, this is amazing! "
,svidrigailovjones,2010-06-22T00:32Z,"thanks but with 320 kbs you might as well have gone for FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) I am not trying to be critical, but such an incredible collection deserves a FLAC distribution. check out Exact Audio Copy. Glenn Gould is dead, but his music should live forever. -Love to all the nobody's, and a good home is hard to find."
,mhikl,2010-12-01T20:03Z,What a wonderful collection. Namaste n0b0dyh0me.
,cantrip,2011-03-14T16:05Z,"WARNING: Disc 37 of this collection has a loud, potentially ear-damaging noise in certain tracks! This is not the uploader's fault, not the original ripper's fault...it was a mistake in the manufacturing. I own this set and had to wait for a replacement disc from Sony to remedy the issue. Save your ears! Skip tracks 26, 28, 30, and 31. Otherwise, a great collection...thanks to the uploader and ripper for saving me the time necessary to rip the 70-ish discs of this collection I hadn't already ripped myself!"
,kristo_th,2011-08-06T19:27Z,thanks for maintaining this torrent - very hard to come by any of this ...
,netrek,2011-09-10T11:59Z,THANK YOU!!!
,Nmbrs123,2012-05-09T17:44Z,"This is such a great torrent but I'm really disappointed in the Two and Three Part Inventions and Sinfonias Disk, I'm not sure if it's you are the manufacturer but they totally mislabeled the BWV and the composition's title... The correct title of the composition is the one that played before the song you're listening to :(
But thank you for the torrent, everyone please continue to seed from this awesome man :D"
