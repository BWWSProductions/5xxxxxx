After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
                  
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	                  
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	                  
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                  
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce                  
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce                  
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce                  
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce                  
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

There's no need to introduce Glenn Gould I guess...

I've found on emule The Complete Original Jacket Collection (80CDs) and I share it here. Enjoy. I've renamed all the albums according to the attached list which came from the original share.

In the original share two albums were named as CD49 and CD20 was missing...

I've decided after listening the minor chords on the first tune of one of those albums, named in A-major, that this was an error, and so I renamed this album as CD20 (where the first tune was named in C-minor).

Let me know if I made some mistake in this operation.
