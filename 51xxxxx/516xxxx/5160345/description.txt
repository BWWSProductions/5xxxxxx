Here are a few of your requested records along with two of my own picks. I am not sure who was the guy desperately looking for Blue Rose record. Anyhow found the lp and it was in very good condition. Luckily you're around to get it. By the way Nuns album is the courtesy of Brad as I had this only on tape. Thanks a bunch Brad!
