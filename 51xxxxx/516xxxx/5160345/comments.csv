,rtrifunov,2009-11-13T11:53Z,"It's unbelievable how many fabulous albums you have posted in such a short time, 80zforever. I've requested from you 3 albums in the comments for your 84. 4 rare 80s albums torrent, and then figured that there is 85. Magnificent!
The albums I can't find and can't order for the reason the pay-pal system doesn't work in my country are
Latin Quarter - Mick and Caroline (1987)
Latin Quarter - Swimming Against the Stream (1989)
Gary Wright - Who I Am (1988)
I need them for an anthology of 80s rock I'm trying to make, and that wouldn't be possible without all of your posts. Thanks, I'll download everything you upload and try to seed as much as I can.
From all the albums you've posted, I like Stabilizers and La Marca most. This music really inspires. There are so many extraorinary, though forgotten bands. 80z rule.
Thank you for the music. You're unbelievable."
,synfinity,2009-11-13T12:37Z,"rtrifunov, I have just uploaded 6 Latin Quarter albums including the ones you are looking for, so enjoy! 80zforever: you have uploaded some truly great albums, keep up the good work, hope you don't mind the Latin Quarter upload..."
,rockaway99,2009-11-13T14:53Z,"Thanks 80zforever!

Urgent - Timing was one that I've been hoping for for a long time."
,rtrifunov,2009-11-13T14:57Z,"synfinity, I've found the Latin Quarter torrent you've uploaded, thank you very much, I was trying to find these albums for a very long time.
Please, seed the torrent for unleast a week or two, so that I can download it. Thanks again."
,bigjoe,2009-11-13T18:06Z,The Distractions!!! You always put up those forgotten gems! Many thanks indeed!
[V],80zforever,2009-11-13T18:36Z,"someone08 so it was you! you can take it off your wish list now.

synfinity thanks for posting Latin Quarter for rtrifunov as I would not have. If an album is cheaply available or recently re-mastered, I normally wouldn't post it. I'd like to see more re-mastered releases, so I try not to discourage bands/labels from continuing to do so.

@rtrifunov, Stabilizers record is truly amazing. I was always lost as to why there was no follow up to this stellar record.

@rockaway99, I have all the records you listed in vinyl. as time permits I'd rip and post them as many other waiting in line lol. 

@bigjoe, I posted The Distractions to see if anyone would remember them! apparently you're as oldy mouldy as I am hahaha.

Cheers guys
"
,someone08,2009-11-13T19:30Z,"80zforever, yes it was me having Blue Rose on the wish list since some months ago. I appreciate very much your effort done for me. So once again many thanks to you. "
,erikphnx,2009-11-14T00:33Z,Awesome 8 of them! Many thanks to 80z for posting them and thanks to those who requested them. I look forwards to checking them out and helping to seed these.
,Kraftvox,2009-11-14T01:53Z,Thanks Brad & 80zforever for Nuns - Rumania. I've never heard this recording before. Thanks again. Someone should post a list of 80s band names so we can see what is out there. It seems everyday I find another band I didn't know existed. It has to be finite.
,sparksie,2009-11-14T08:15Z,80z As allways THANKS for the great music this past week good to see a little Canadian content. a request her and it's a little off topic but looking for Cafe Jacques if you have great if not can you point me in the right direction Cheers from Edmonton
,Spurge42,2009-11-15T03:43Z,Don't know how you do it 80z. I'm suspecting you have a time machine and you duck back to pick up some requests  :D   Thanks 
[V],80zforever,2009-11-15T05:41Z,"@sparksie, I think they have their International LP, not positive though. I'll post it i happen to find it.

@Spurge42, hahaha actually I am stuck back in time and just visit the present to post music! cheers"
,rockaway99,2009-11-15T19:01Z,"Thank you so much for all the awesome albums you've posted. Here's 5 more form my lengthy wish list if you get a chance to upload them -

Aerial - Maneuvers
Blue Northern - Blue Northern
Doug & the Slugs - Music for the Hard of Thinking
Leyden Zar - Leyden Zar
Paul Dean - Hardcore

Thanks again."
,taz1962,2009-11-15T22:34Z,Hey great torrent I was wondering if you could help me with a couple of bands I'm looking for one is Aerial - Up in the air and as well as any Fist albums Thanks once again
,rtrifunov,2009-11-16T00:36Z,"Hey guys, I know Gary Wright - Who I Am (1988) is not rare, but it's unavailable to me.
I won't request anything else, I've found everything I wanted and couldn't dream of here.
Pay pal DOESN'T work in my country.
Please help, anyone. Thanks in advance."
