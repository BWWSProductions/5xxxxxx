Edit; Sorry for the last one. Don't know what the fuck happened to it.


' ... We are the one's we've been waiting for ... '


"Beware of the bearers of false gifts and broken promises. Much pain but there is still time. Believe. There is still good out there. We oppose the decievers. Conduit is closing."


That was the only message that was decoded so far. And there is one more but it's not tht important really. Something that was sent to space, a code by us telling bout how we communicate, how our DNA strands are and how do we look like, so on one of the crop circles -according to what they say- they replied us back and left a message after leaving it. Look ofr the title 'Two most important crop circles.' onif you're interested


The largest crop has also appeared on Netherands which reminds me a bit of 'Vitruvian Man' figure of Da Vinci, or 'Mothman' as they say. Well so far I can say butterfly effect or butterfly has been used to describe 'Soul' or 'Psyche' which If I need to symbolise such a thing, could mean 'Spiritual Evolution of Humankind' , well. Get ready to hear a lot about this enormous, huge humanbug spinning around...




You may also want to check out this. Spontaneous Evolution a book by Dr. Bruce Lipton & Steve Bhaerman ( Swami Beyondananda ) too has something super synchromystical going on with this beautiful Human Butterfly Crop Circle.. and this is how it goes..

From '94 to '09 , all the crop circle images are in one pack! I must say they started to appear pretty often in 2009. Have abolsutely no idea why.


There are many many theories about crop circles so I didn't wannt to put any ebooks inside the rar pack I made. I wanted everybody to have an objective, clear thought and give criticial thinking. Even if for not, man-made or not. It actually worth just to check how beautiful sacred geometry can be applied to our precious nature.


But still, if you still want to kill some time to try to decode a cosmic message these two might help you;

With this, you can combine them or seperate to understand what they belong to.
