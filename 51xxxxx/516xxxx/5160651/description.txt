Intuitive new interface
The new tabbed ribbon-style interface puts all the functions at your fingertips. You can always see what functions are available and everything is so self-explanatory you will probably never need to consult the manual. Includes elegant Vista-style buttons in Windows XP and very cool transition effects when you switch between photos in full-screen editing mode.

Quick-Fix Tools
All the common operations you need to perform on your photos are now available in the Quick-Fix Tools tab: One-click color and contrast optimization, photo straightening (if the camera wasnâ€™t straight), red eye correction, cropping, rotating and more â€“ all with a couple of clicks.

Editable objects
You can add additional photos, text boxes, geometric shapes, arrows and more to your images. And now you can save them in a new file format that lets you go back again edit the objects again later without having to start right from the beginning.

Powerful new screen capture functions
The screen capture function now uses the latest technology from Ashampooâ€™s award-winning Magical Snap 2. It includes full support for capturing Windows Vistaâ€™s transparent Aero Glass effects and capturing on multi-monitor systems. You can also capture free-style shapes as well as the standard rectangular objects and fixed shapes, and apply cool drop shadow, edge and shape effects automatically while capturing.

Quick 5-star rating system
Every photo displayed in the Organizer has a line of 5 stars under it. To rate your photo you just click for between 1 and 5 stars. You can then sort by star ratings to quickly find your favorite photos.

Emailing multiple photos and movies
Now you can email multiple photos in a single PDF file, which many people like a lot more than mails with a whole list of separate photo attachments. You can also press Ctrl+E to mail one or more photos or other media files quickly. And of course Photo Commander will resize your pictures for you to make them easier to send.
