An album that always puts a smile on my face :) Besides, it has a perfect balance between bluegrass and pop. And doesn't sound as something recorded 35 years ago at all.

Great album all in all, pleasure to listen to.


Ripped with EAC secure mode.

If you don't like FLACs - it is easy to convert them to MP3s -
