This makes two RARE Beatles sets I am checking out that you uploaded. Please upload and more rare albums of the Beatles (English) OR any Beatles Documentaries on DVD or CD. Actually more Beatles on DVD would be real cool to see seeded. 

Cheers."

,gigshaft,2011-05-08T21:27Z,"Thanks for posting this!

I realize this makes me thick, but the each of the CDs seem to be in one uninterrupted .flac file.  Can someone tell me what software you use to separate out the tracks?

All help appreciated.  Thanks!"
,gigshaft,2011-05-08T21:41Z,I revise my previous plea for help.  XLD for OSX seems to be working great.
