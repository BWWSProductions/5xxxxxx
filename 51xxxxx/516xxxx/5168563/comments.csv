[T],dexto,2009-11-18T21:01Z,"===========================

Guys, the reason why there is no PROPER crack yet is because the Executable thing hasn't been unlocked yet, It will get unlocked and open to steam on 19 November (tomorrow).

Give it 15+ hours to get a PROPER working crack on torrent or Direct links.

,Derc,2009-11-19T03:26Z,"2. Install the game using the setup provided.
3. Launch the game with the Loader if you don't want to startSteam aswell. Also you may get some error message but that's ok

WTF? I call bullshit.. this is the same as AiTB's upload and the loader is shit. Nothing works, even tried to load on a LEGITIMATE steam acct. still crashes with error."
,Torx8,2009-11-19T14:45Z,"the game files are real and genuine, it's the revolution loader that is outdated compared to l4d2's files.. so when a new crack is out you can still use this release by replacing the crack."

,K-Style,2009-11-21T18:12Z,"I don't think you have to move your game to C drive, just extract everything inside the crack to the game directory, it will work then. My game is in D drive  and I'm using windows vista anyway."
