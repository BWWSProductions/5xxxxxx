Seven Swans is a folk rock music album by Sufjan Stevens. It includes songs about Abraham and Christ's Transfiguration, among many others. The album is softer and sparser than other albums by Stevens, relying more heavily on his trademark banjo and melodious voice.

Seven Swans was received well by critics. The Guardian called it "a record of remarkable delicacy" and Spin magazine said it sounded "like Elliott Smith after ten years of Sunday school".

The album was released on compact disc and vinyl LP; the vinyl was released by Burnt Toast Vinyl.
