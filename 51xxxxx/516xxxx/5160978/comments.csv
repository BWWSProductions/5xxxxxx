,coolwavepic,2010-02-01T02:31Z,How do you add that line of code for Win7??
,Mitch_Bainwol,2010-04-03T11:55Z,"Works great, tried a preset no problem (FLV 480p).

Installed under XP x64 SP2, yea.

The next version of CS is CS5 and Adobe sez that it will only work under an x64 WINOWSUCKS/MAC OS.

Sadly, this version doesn't contain the SoundSoap plugin."

just right click on the keygen.exe file and ""run as administrator""

,taskmasta,2010-05-12T20:34Z,Followed the directions perfectly but it keeps asking me to verify account. I'm on Windows 7 64bit. It worked fine when I had XP 32bit and it didnt ask me for the verification mess.  Anybody else have this prob?
,joelsnug,2010-05-19T03:59Z,"@taskmasta I have Win 7 64bit as well and it's asking me to verify my account when I try and use any of the premade formats, any thoughts?"
,vue02,2010-06-08T04:42Z,"Install the SqueezeWebInstall exe first, next.. next.. agree.. when it gets to the Registration and activation page.. run the keygen abd click Patch..
Then copy the company name from the keygen..
and click generate to get the serial..
next next.. skip email shit.. next.. next.. and install..
Then you install that ffdshow
Not sure about that CORE10k file.. works for me without it

Thanks
