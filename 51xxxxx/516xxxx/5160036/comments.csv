,Rawrexe,2010-01-06T20:03Z,"suvomania my torrent has a more complete discography

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5257479/LINKIN_PARK_Discography__The_HighestQuality__Mostly_Complete_

Live in Orlando isn't official just like Splitting the DNA and Under Attack but those I named were fanmade and Live in Orlando is just someone who had a ""good"" recording, Minutes to Midnight (Regeneration) isn't Linkin Park, It's grey daze and some other bands. 

Thanks for the upload, it let me get a HQ of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation :D (named you in my torrent )

Hope that helped!"
,Rawrexe,2010-01-13T17:14Z,"Updated it. Check:

,cbesta11,2010-04-26T05:19Z,"good disco.... except there's a HeD PE song in there called I Just Want Your Company,,,that's not even the title of they're song anyways :P"
,7Blacker3,2010-05-13T04:32Z,"Good torrent, my only issue is there's a few songs in here that aren't remotely connected to Linkin Park -- One of them being ""My Reason"" -- That song was spread through Limewire under Linkin Park's name. It's by Spiritfall, not Linkin Park.

Other than that -- 2 points, some good hard to find tunes in here."
,pesmaniac,2010-05-13T16:53Z,"Thanks suvomania!!
