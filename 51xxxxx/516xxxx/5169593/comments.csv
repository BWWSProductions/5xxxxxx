I started this DL @ 10:00 PST it finished 1:11:00 hrs later... not bad at all from my perspective here in Canada... the start was a little abrupt, that OK, but the end finished poorly... I really wouldn't mind seeing the credits... that way I know the show is over til next week. yours is by far the earliest UL... Cheers... Keep up the speedy work! 

This is an awesome show!!!

Thank You!"

,Squidgi_deE,2009-11-22T07:25Z,"Well, that's how it ended on television... I say, get it all but the commercials... ""what you missed, the show, credits, and next week on gLee"" Nobody said anything else so rest assured you didn't miss anything ^_^"
