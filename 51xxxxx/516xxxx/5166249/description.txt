Sharing the sadness and emotional vulnerability of Joy Division and the daft electronic drive of Hot Chip, Alt Altman aka Digits makes some of the most life enriching pop music I have heard in quite some time. Itâ€™s rare for me to be drawn to music with such an emotional quality, but I find myself returning time and time again to Digitsâ€™ perfectly nonchalant songs. The Toronto musicianâ€™s brand of electronic indie pop has a strange sense of isolation, often bordering on loneliness, but his music has a way of expressing more than that, reveling in a kind of diffident awkwardness. Altmanâ€™s lyrics steer the music for the most part, resting alongside his dainty guitar chords and soft electro synths, but it is his bass lines that add life and colour to the songs, adding a bouncy adolescent energy to counteract the musicâ€™s overall shyness.

Altman started Digits in March, 2009, and released his debut album Hold It Close on September 24. The album can be downloaded from his bandcamp page. A couple of the tracks are free but I recommend that you pay the little bit extra and download the whole album.
