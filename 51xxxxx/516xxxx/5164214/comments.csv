Do I need special codecs or just a different player? cheers for the great work guys."
,spunkster,2010-12-01T18:32Z,"Jimmer44 - try VLC player. It plays everything and is the player of choice among pb users. If it still won't play, get CCCP for free (Combined Community Codec Pack), which is a high quality package that has all the filters you'll ever need."
