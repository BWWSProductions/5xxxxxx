,[KranK],2009-11-21T04:59Z,"Hey man thanks a lot for this, I've been listening to a lot of of dubstep lately and was looking around for some more artists to listen to.  Maybe a Dubstep Party Collection 2 in the future? :D"

,duBodner,2009-12-01T15:15Z,"Yeah I guess I can make chill mix, will take time tho. 
thanks for the positive feedback!"

,duBodner,2010-01-20T01:06Z,"ah I know what you mean he's one of my favorites, I have a bunch of more of his tunes , contact me on farshys@gmail.com if you want some. 

Or if I'll actually make a second collection soon as people ask, I'm working on one, won't be all new but some really good stuff. "
,rastagid,2010-01-26T07:05Z,raw dude... thx
,stevieb,2010-01-31T11:53Z,"Nice post , Thanx :D"
,duBodner,2010-02-03T18:09Z,"ok I started collecting for the second torrent about a month ago, and I have too many ready , too many that I heard and must find and too many tunes to check out ( about 800 ). So basically I'm going to make 3 new collections, each of  20-35 tunes, with mixed artists ( won't put like 10 tunes of the same artist in same collection ) so it'll be more interesting. will be up till this weekend.

,don139,2010-03-09T20:36Z,"peace im 16 y o
and im into dnb since end 2008
and into dubstep since beginning 2009 =)
i really like this sample ive got it like one week after it was up

but ive got one question to all ya junglists warez-guys and dubheadz out there

how do you sort your music ?

because i use itunes and do it like this:
example on this torrent
1. load all files into itunes
2. mark all loaded music
3. name it to ""dubstep party collection""
4. change album artist to ""various artist""
5. search in google for ""dubstep party collection"" and take a funny or cool pic for cover

so i have all the music from this torrent on one album and not so many separate icons in itunes

but im not as happy as i want with this method
how do you manage this better ??? "
,duBodner,2010-03-12T00:38Z,"ah good question. I don't have a good answer tho, since I keep it the same as I downloaded so I could still upload 'em all w/e I can. Except I put 'em all in one big folder. What you SHOULD do is get a free 1-2 hours ( depends on how much files you have , I think I'll need 4 with breaks ) and sort 'em out by Artists folders, in the artists folder into EPs/Albums/Sindles/and/or-Years . Thats what I do with my hiphop collection. And simply create a playlist of your own, or a playlist that contains this collection ( have to pick it one by one tho )."
,Coltuca,2010-03-22T19:50Z,hell yeah dude! this is DA SHIT =)
