Following in the footsteps of previous failures Dick Tracy and Flash Gordon, secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine) arrives in Alphaville. It's a technocracy ruled by a gravel-voiced central computer called Alpha-60, that has regimented humans into strict classes and split the city into zones of night and day, cold and warmth. Alpha-60 also has ambitions to conquer the rest of the world -- Nueva York, Tokyorama -- and rule all under its cold eye of logic.

Lemmy contacts his immediate predecessor, Henry Dickson, and discovers he has become a hopeless drunk in a seedy hotel; Dickson puts him on to Professor Von Braun, aka defector Leonard Nosferatu (horror icon Howard Vernon), the brains behind the superbrain Alpha 60. Lemmy finds himself embroiled in a weird romance with Natasha Von Braun, the mastermind's daughter (Anna Karina) and plays semantic games when interrogated by the all-controlling computer. But when Lemmy's had enough, he lashes out with the power of poetry and a .45 automatic and single-handedly brings Alphaville to its knees.
