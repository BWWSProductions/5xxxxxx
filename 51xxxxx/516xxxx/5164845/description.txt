This is a converstion of this torrent - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4754194/Bolt_1080p_BluRay_x264-1920(No_Rars)


I converted it with AVS Video Converter 6 with the highest WMV settings because I have no idea how to stream an .mkv file on to my xbox without the audio and video unsyncing.   Haven't had time to watch it but it looks great (the parts I checked).  I just did this so it could stream straight to an Xbox without encoding. Hope this helps someone.

(and if you know more about mkv files and know exactly how to stream it to your xbox perfectly...i would DL the above mentioned torrent)


Bolt - 1080p - 9000kbps - wma pro - 384 kbps



have fun!
