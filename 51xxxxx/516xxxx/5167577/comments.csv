,everton1980,2009-12-02T02:26Z,"nlx, i do apologise obviously i have had an unexpected problem when downloading the torrent it said missing files and stopped, however its downloading just fine now, the first comment you can ignore as i got the film i was trying to play mixed up so its thankfully not a codec issue. thanks for the upload, i will comment again once complete but im sure through researching the list of films you have uploaded it will be of good quality, angry person pirate had a point, you are obviously providing a cracking service. sorry for the mix up.
