A zombie comedy about finding the meaning of life. A blind philosopher, a children's TV show star with a shotgun, a nihilistic hero, a brain in a plastic bucket and a forest crawling with undead woodsmen... 

This is only one of two torrents on this film available. The video is the same but I added an English subtitle file that actually works and is perfectly in sync with the video. 

Enjoy.
