Mixed in Key is Windows and Mac OS X software which analyzes MP3 and WAV files.

are harmonically compatible. Designed to quickly analyze music files, Mixed In Key 
shows which tracks can be mixed together without a key clash and also detects the 
BPM.

Mixed In Key takes your mixing to the next level by showing which songs you can 
mix together without a key clash. It works with all CD decks, Ableton Live,

How-To Guide for Harmonic Mixing 
 
Harmonic Mixing is an advanced technique used by top DJs all over the world. 
By mixing tracks that are in the same or related keys, harmonic mixing enables 
long blends and mash-ups. The goal is to eliminate key clashes.

Harmonic mixing consists of two elements: knowing the key of every song that 
you play and knowing which keys are compatible.

To get started, use Mixed In Key software to analyze your music. Launch the 
latest Version 4.0, click "Add Files" and Mixed In Key will automatically 
scan your MP3 and WAV files.  It will detect the key and BPM of every song. 

Harmonic mixing helps you achieve a 'live mash-up' effect and encourages 
creativity. You'll discover unusual song mixing combination's, like The Beatles 
vs. Jay-Z, or you can simply enjoy flawless DJ mixing, like Armin Van Buuren, 
Paul Van Dyk and Sasha.

With harmonic mixing, it's essential to know the key of every song you play. 
Mixed In Key software scans your entire music collection (MP3s and WAVs) to 
make this easy. When scanning is done, Mixed In Key displays your results in 
the Camelot Easymix notation (e.g. 4A, 6B) or Flat/Sharp notation (e.g. F minor, 
B-flat minor). 

To use harmonic mixing in your DJ sets, subtract one hour, add one hour, or stay 
in the same hour as your last song. If you're in key of 4A, your next song can be 
3A, 4A or 5A. You are simply subtracting or adding one hour.
By using this method, your mixes will be harmonic. Because it is based on music 
theory, harmonic mixing works for all music genres.


*The First Mix
To help DJs learn harmonic mixing Mark Davis created the Camelot wheel (see image),
a visual representation of which musical keys are compatible with each other.
On the Camelot wheel each musical key is assigned a keycode number from one 
to twelve, like hours on a clock.

For the first mix, we recommend mixing two songs that have the same keycode, like 
8A and 8A. This will sound like a professional mash-up made in the studio, even 
if you are mixing on live DJ equipment.


*Create Interesting Mixes
Get creative! You're in control. Using the Camelot method, you can move around 
the Camelot wheel one step at a time. With every mix, you can change keys.

For a special effect, mix between the inner and the outer circle. 
Try this: Stay in the same hour, but change the letter. 
For example, you can mix from 10B to 10A. If you are in 10A, your next song can be
10B (change letter), 9A (subtract one hour), 10A (same hour), or 11A (add one hour).


*Camelot Easymix method
The Camelot notation makes harmonic mixing easy. On the Camelot Easymix Wheel 
(see image) musical keys can be seen as hours on a clock. For example, 4 o'clock 
corresponds to 4A or 4B. The A letter represents Minor keys. The B letter 
represents Major keys.


*Moving Around The Wheel
Most professional DJs move around the Camelot wheel with every mix. 

For a perfect mix, choose a keycode within one "hour" of your current keycode.  
If you are in 8A, you can play 7A, 8A or 9A next. If you are in 12A, you can 
play 11A, 12A or 1A. This mix will be smooth every time.

You can also mix between inner and outer wheels if you stay in the same "hour."  
For example, try mixing from 8A to 8B, and notice the change in melody as you go 
from Minor to Major.


*Approach to Harmonic Mixing
We recommend going clock-wise or counter-clockwise around the wheel, changing key 
every couple of songs. For example, we may play: 10A > 10A > 10B > 9B > 8B > 8A > 
7A > 6A for a 100% harmonic DJ set. It never gets boring because there is a music 
progression happening during the entire mix. Your audience will love it as well. 
This is the method used by top Mixed In Key DJs such as Pete Tong, Deep Dish 
and thousands of others.   


*Summary
Scan your files with Mixed In Key Version 4.0. Use the Camelot Wheel to pick 
compatible tunes. Mix them on your favorite DJ equipment. Result: Harmonic Mixing.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
