Are you going to be 'hanging out' any where else once TPB shuts down? I know things are going to stay operational for a bit but since their announcement at TorrentFreak http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-tracker-shuts-down-for-good-091117/

I love this VIP system. I will miss it.

I wondered where everyone will go?"
,namez,2009-11-18T18:58Z,"thanks RH.. RIP TPB tracker but the magnet links will work just fine I hope.. Has anyone found propellerheads record key yet. it would be much help, and thanks in advance. I will post in request page too"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-19T05:33Z,"@hanzman 
I don't use adblockers, and can't give advise about it. At the forum you can find more info or ask for help.


@brianxxx
The last months there are many rumors about TPB. The old TPB tracker might be dead, but TPB isn't."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-19T07:39Z,"@namez 
As far as I know there's no Propellerheads Record Key, but there's a Propellerheads Record Key.

At the forum more people see requests, so it's in your own benefit to post requests there."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-19T07:40Z,"@namez 

CORRECTION: As far as I know there's no Propellerheads Record Key, but there's a Propellerheads IGNITION Key."
,xpc_55555,2009-11-19T09:43Z,thanks 
,brianxxx,2009-11-19T16:35Z,"REPOSTING THIS TO CLEAR UP MY MISTAKE - 

WOW...I checked my info and made sure I was right before posting my thoughts. 

I apologize. Glad to see no one is going any where. Sorry guys. But hey, blame Torrent Freak and not me. They made that article current, the date shown is 11/17. I was genuinely worried.

I love this place. Been a long time member, I always seed and try to be constructive and add in a positive way.

I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GLAD I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEW! "
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-20T00:00Z,"@brianxxx 

You just asked a normal question, so no need to apologize. I know you've been here for a long time and always try to provide some usefull info for those who need it. TPB and uploaders appreciate that very much. :)

BTW: The forum is a usefull place for all kind of help and info."

any help will be deeply appreciated! it's not just for me but for million people out there!"
,JrJester,2009-11-20T20:08Z,"RobbingHood - Thank you, however when using this it's not keying any songs.  It only finds bpm's ... I've uninstalled and installed a couple of times.  The crack for the VIP code works GREAT!, but the program isn't keying anything.   Any help?

Has anyone got the keying to work?"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-20T23:41Z,"@FuckSholihin

,digweedJ,2009-11-28T06:31Z,"robbin hood...... hi

help me out man.... or any1 who has down loaded MIK.....

when i unpacked the fles there is no VIP code to activate MIK...
please post it thx"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-29T02:31Z,"@digweedJ 

I guess you've noticed the fix by now .....


NOTE:
****
Too bad it seems like indeed there's a bug in the fix causing the analyzing to fail. 
Hopefully it'll be fixed soon, but don't expect anything cause obviously the app is quite hard to crack.

(In case of a definitive fail the torrent will be removed later.) "
,therecordyou,2009-12-08T04:21Z,is this working with propellerhead record ?? 
,VirtualMark,2009-12-16T01:45Z,"I have applied the fix but the program just crashes. I'm using windows 7 64bit. I think its a problem with the fix, as if i run the program without the fix i just get the activation screen, but once i've appliec the fix it won't run without crashing. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

,hex87,2010-04-29T19:00Z,"FOR x64 PEOPLE:

You need to find CorFlags.exe program, i think that it's part of Windows SDK.

When you have it execute it with following parametars:
CorFlags.exe /32BIT+ """"

this will force MIK to run in 32 mode"

Please remove this torrent as the main function of this program is calculating the key. To calculate BPM there are enough other, free programs."
