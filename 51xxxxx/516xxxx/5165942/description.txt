crazy plan to confess he uses too, so Red can't hypocritically kick Hyde out, who intends to move in

home, hoping to see Midge naked, soon joined by Hyde and Eric and believing Bob killed her... A 

literalism makes Donna fear Eric already lost interest in her, Jackie convinces her she's boring. Red 

won't open the door because he didn't pay the paperboy in weeks, so Kelso opens but is mistaken for the 

cheap bastard and viciously haunted and robbed in his place. Feeding Midge's birds proves traumatic for

then regrets it. Donna's consolation attempt is mistaken by Kelso for making out... Red is sued by Earl

While the whole basement bunch meanly joins in with the school-wide ridiculing of poor Kelso, who made

nuts', Eric worries only about Donna's expected jealousy when he is seen in the diner with his lab 

partner, school slut Shelly, and when Donna is confidently cool about it feels offended, yet Jackie's 

assurance Eric is too girlish to cheat on her no longer holds when panties are found in Eric's car... 

Meanwhile Kitty has found out about Red's heart condition and puts him on a strict fat- and fun-less 

diet, funny for the kids until...
