,rocketero,2009-12-08T08:16Z,"thanks InDeNd7, it worked for me on vista x64 machine."
,rocketero,2009-12-08T09:06Z,"I also installed it on Windows 7 x86 or 32bit for those who don't know what's an x86 architecture, it worked fine. I used the Keygen and used a bootable windows Vista ISO, as this is the only way to run a keygen and not get virus. If anyone don't know what's a bootable Windows ISO, do a search for ""VistaPE"" or ""LiveXP"""
,tux76,2009-12-21T01:37Z,works fine for my Win7 64bit .. thank you !
,chadnan,2009-12-24T07:22Z,Thanks...
,XorLogic0110,2010-01-03T08:40Z,"I downloaded the installer from their site (although had to go through some stupid forms), but the keygen works great! (win 7; 32bit) 

Thanks."
,chera64,2010-01-12T07:01Z,"Nice Job!

I used the serials of 32bit version of Windows (from InDeNd7) for my 64bit linux and it worked fine!

Thanks,"
,life6is6grand6,2010-03-19T17:29Z,thanks alot. your keygen really saved my ass.

Upload it to Virus total and see what I mean."
,vibe666,2010-06-30T16:28Z,"live ISO's aren't the only way to run (potentially dodgy) keygens without getting infected.  google for ""sandboxie"" and you'll have everything you need. ;o)"
,InDeNd7,2010-07-04T18:31Z,"Wow!.. I just left my torrent without looking even since I made it!... :)
Nice go ppl...
