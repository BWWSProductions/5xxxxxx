thx."
,Delerio,2010-01-08T04:23Z,"thecatintheroof.

The Xbox360 is region locked. Wich means you can only play games from your region. This is a PAL game for exampel and PAL does only work for Europe. I dont know for sure but I would think you belong to the NTSC region. I know thats the one for north america anyways. Also if you see a torrent marked RF, that stands for region free wich means it will work on any Xbox 360 no matter the region. Hope my messy answer made sence and look into wich region you belong to."
