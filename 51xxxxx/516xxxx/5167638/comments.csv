As I see, too many files are not included into the DVD1. How can I do to finish the installation and make the game works? Thanks."

Thanks again."
,micasloko,2009-12-28T00:05Z,"As nobody answered, follow the solution for the fking problem:
Well.. I checked the 2nd DVD, and I found the files that was not in th 1st DVD.
So, I used the MagicISO to put all the files of the DVD2, transfering to the DVD1. After this, I saved the job.
Thats all. It worked. Easy and simply.
Thanks."
