This fix allows you to open hyperlinks made in any ms office application, with vlc player.

I was tired of VLC not opening my hyperlinks. For exemple, I made a powerpoint presentation with a hyperlink to a *.mpg movie, but every time i got the message that there was no program associated with the mpg file. (just a side note: My standard player for everything is VLC) I had two choices, either switch back to lame old windows media player, or fix the problem. So I fixed it =P

The program adds some keys to your register, so all MS office applications know that VLC is the boss.
