With new found motivation and dedication The Lineage is back from their almost 3 month disappearance from the scene. With a new lead vocalist and a progressive new style they are ready to show the local scene what they've got. Be ready for a heavier, more technical, and melodic sound with more leads, solos, and vocal work than ever before. But don't over look the new catchy rhythms because they have never hit harder. The Lineage is looking to get their name out and hopefully go national very soon.



If you like the music show the band some love buy their EP, get some merch, go to a show, add them on myspace, or spread the word.
