The Last Days of Animal Man is set a decade or so into the future.  Buddy Bakerâ€™s life is going well.  He and his wife are still together, Buddyâ€™s stunt double agency is getting work, and heâ€™s defending the city of San Diego from crime with his alter ago of Animal Man.  When a villain named Bloodrage attacks the dedication of the new Southern Coast Sea Levee, though, Buddyâ€™s powers start to falter, shutting down one minute and then working the next.  Are Animal Manâ€™s powers fading away?  And what will happen if they ever go away entirely in the middle of battle?
