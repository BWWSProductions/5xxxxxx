                                Release Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  This is a really good movie. It is shot beautifully, the acting is first-
rate, and Monsieur Richard's story is very engaging.
  I've hardcoded the English subtitles into the video stream. I ripped them,
then editted out the English, and any French that seemed unnecessary (we
all know what "oui" means, non?). It seemed to me that virtually all new TVs
and widescreen LCDs are 16:9 aspect ratio now, so instead of encoding the
movie strictly to its 2.35 AR then hardcoding the subs over top of the image,
I shifted the image up, left a black bar on the bottom and rendered the subs
inside their own field. The file itself has been coded with a 1.78 AR, which
will fit perfectly inside the AR of a widescreen monitor, but the movie is
still in its original 2.35. The audio stream is clean 5.1, spoken in French,
English, and accented English (per orginal).
  I can't say enough about this film, it is so much more than a "sports
flick" or "hockey film". Some of the best CanCon out there.
  Should recode to NTSC compliant DVD for those so inclined.

PS
I forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of "Man Alive" (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.
