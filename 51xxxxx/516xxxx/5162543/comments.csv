,Danux01,2010-01-26T23:57Z,"OILFAN79 : Copy and save everything between the two
==========================
lines in the description. These are the subs from the DVD I editted for this torrent. Save as a substation alpha file (.SSA). If you use Windows, use Wordpad, save the file as plain text, ANSI.
Let me know when you've copied it so I can remove it from the description."
,OILFAN79,2010-01-27T03:33Z,"you can delete the text i have it saved but when i go to save it, it saves it the rocket.ssa.txt"
,Danux01,2010-01-27T03:44Z,"Did you try renaming it to 
YourName.ssa
? Also, I don't know if the formatting on this webpage changed the format of the text (i don't use Windows), you may have to edit it manually - there should be one line per one subtitle statement. For instance, the first line of subtitles should end :
...!Effect,What a sorry sight, what a tragedy!
NOT
...!Effect,What a
sorry sight, what a tragedy!
Just use your delete key at the end of each line to fix it, if it needs fixing."
,OILFAN79,2010-01-27T06:11Z,"thanks for all of your help, i downloaded a program called subtitle workshop that converted a.txt. to .ssa.

e93eb91fb0d573a6950006bd8004d31a
if someone else gets this first let me know i have many more"
,Danux01,2010-01-27T09:03Z,"No sweat re:help.
Appreciate the offer to Home.eu, but will pass - it's important, IMHO, to use sites like TPB exactly because they are free to everyone. I realize the admins at the other tracker are simply trying to ""protect"" themselves, but open sites like this are where the social and socio-economic shift is occurring.
Just saying, because some stranger is likely to claim the invite you've posted."
