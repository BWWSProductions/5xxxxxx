Regarding producer Andy Johns, bassist Michael Anthony states:

â€œ He is a great engineer and a great producer. He really was like the fifth member of the band. He was out in the studio with us, making suggestions and everything. He knew when we had a take. He would say, 'Play it as many times as you want, but that is the one right there.' He would go outside and have a cigarette and say, 'Let me know when you guys are through goofing around because this is the take we are using.'
