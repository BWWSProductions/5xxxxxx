,kludge420,2010-02-05T21:14Z,Ugh! Why do people make MKV's? Makes the whole thing worthless. Stop packaging up perfectly good avi's into a shit format that has numerous problems.
,tonyppe,2010-02-08T00:31Z,An AVI is not a format.. MKVs hold true surround info and can also hold subtitles that allow you to turn them off. MKVs are usually better quality and are true 720p such as this. I dont know the specific differences but from all the vids I have found MKVs are always better!
,simpledood,2010-04-12T20:18Z,"Thanks for posting this!

And @ Kludge420, 'shit format' (you mean container) with numerous problems (Not only do I fail to see the mass complaints of MKV on PTBY, but never have I had a problem with them, let alone numerous problems with them). So I guess what I'm trying to say is Cool Story Bro!"

,b3tito,2011-08-27T06:32Z,thank you very much for episodes and thank you so much for subs too!
,punkrock_scotty,2011-10-21T11:25Z,"@Kludge240 I agree bro. MKVs may look better, and hold subtitles (not that subtitles should be included) but I can't do shit with an mkv, especially seeing as I use my ps3 as a media centre, and they can't play mkv, but they play .avi perfectly. So just use avi, i don't mind waiting the extra couple of minutes to download uncompressed avis if it means i dont have to spend half an hour converting mkv to avi"
