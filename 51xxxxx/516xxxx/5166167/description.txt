Britain has a big problem. The dead are returning to life and attacking the living. The people they kill get up and kill â€“ and itâ€™s spreading like wildfire. Curiously, there are a few people left in Britain who arenâ€™t worried about any of this â€“ thatâ€™s because theyâ€™re the remaining contestants in Big Brother. Cocooned in the safety of the Big Brother house, theyâ€™re blissfully unaware of the horrific events unfolding outside. Until an eviction night when all hell breaks loose. 

Kelly, (Jaime Winstone) the production runner working on Big Brother finds herself caught in the impossible position of trying to fend off the walking dead alongside the remaining housemates, Davina herself, a host of former Big Brother housemates, her producer boss Patrick (Andy Nyman) and boyfriend Riq (Riz Ahmed).

Over the ensuing days, in a cruel reflection of the game show they thought they were entering, the contestants fall victim, one by one, to the hungry masses outside. Staying alive requires teamwork â€“ which is tricky when youâ€™re a group specifically selected by TV producers to wind each other up.
