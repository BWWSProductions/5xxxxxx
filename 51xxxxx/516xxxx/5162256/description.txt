Who can it be knocking at my door? Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more. â€“ Men at Work

If those lyrics ever rang true, it was with this movie. Yam Laranasâ€™ â€˜The Echo" takes you on a fright-filled journey with a horror film that is finally able to deliver the goods. The Echo (Sigaw) is both "intense" as well "frightening" and when youâ€™re not "jumping out of your seat" you can easily find yourself squirming with anticipation of "whatâ€™s to come."

Iâ€™m a huge fan of horror movies and not to many of them really win me over. "The Eye" as well as "A Tale of Two Sisters" is two of my favorite horror films, as well as two of my favorite "Asian Horror" films and "The Echo" easily rates right along with them â€“ itâ€™s that good of a film.

As of late "The Echo" has been getting a lot of praises during itâ€™s current run on the Film Festival circuit - Official Selection: Screamfest L.A. (2005), Winner: Best Editing/Best Sound, Metro Manila Film Festival (2004), Winner: Best Cinematography & Visual Design, Young Critics Circle (2004), Winner: Best Editing/Best Sound Young Critics Circle (2004), Winner: Best Supporting Actress Iza Calzado, Gawad Urian (2004) â€“ and I have to say, they are all well deserved.
