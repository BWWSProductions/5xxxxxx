[T],keka_umans,2009-11-14T08:55Z,the quality is all the same... there is usually only one or two original files just depends on what people do to it
,CapQuebec,2009-11-14T09:26Z,"Not working for me too, I also received a wmv file, VLC andMPlayer are showing a few seconds of random colors, DIVX Player and Quicktime Player with the latest mention it is DRM protected, torrent is downloaded 100%. Big waste of my time."
,CapQuebec,2009-11-14T09:32Z,"*Latest Flip4mac with my Quicktime, forgot to write it"
[T],keka_umans,2009-11-14T13:01Z,"dont know what you guys are talking about with the .wmv file this torrent contains ""Stargate.Universe.S01E08.Time.HDTV.XviD-FQM.avi"" google it is real i already watched the entire episode"
[T],keka_umans,2009-11-14T13:04Z,altho then again only like two of the commenters bother to share their own torrents.....so lets ignore them
,redsn0w,2009-11-14T18:50Z,"There's nothing wrong with this torrent, video came up perfectly using VLC Player. Thanks Polarina."
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-14T19:25Z,i'm a bit late with the response but thanks for the info on those sites keka ;)
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-14T19:33Z,"this is not a wmv file, i downloaded this and got an avi just like i should have gotten
this torrent is GOOD
those of you that downloaded a wmv obviously accidentally downloaded the wrong torrent
there were a lot of BAD torrents out yesterday before this one finally came out
there seem to be some people out there that just want to cause harm and are trying to use torrents for popular tv series to do so, even pretending to have a connection to big time uploaders like eztv (like chacha4 for example)
if you know how to fuck these people back, please do so for all of us who can't
or better yet, let everybody know how to fuck these people up electronically so we can all kick their asses together :)"
,Polarina,2009-11-14T19:34Z,You're all welcome! I hope you enjoyed it. :-)
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-14T19:49Z,"sure did polarina
many thanks
usually i get this from eztv but for some reason they were really late yesterday so you saved the day ;)"
,redsn0w,2009-11-16T00:01Z,Thanks!
,petzar,2009-11-17T11:11Z,Very good quality. Thank you very much. seeding as we speak. This show is great.
