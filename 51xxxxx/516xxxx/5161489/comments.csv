you better than eztv!!!"
,Xcel432,2009-11-14T06:23Z,"Nothing at all against EZTV, but I have to agree with Ciscoman... The number of peers to seed ratio on EZ's ups is just out of control, makes getting the file ""early"" a little rough, 

VTV has a better seed/peer ratio and the files DL allot smoother....

Thanx VTV!"
