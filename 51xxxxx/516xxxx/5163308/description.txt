Ganggangsullae is a kind of circle dance performed by women and popular on the southwest coast of Korea. It is listed as Korean Important Intangible Asset #8, and is listed by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The 3 performers on this recording, ë°•ìš©ìˆœ, ê¹€ì¢…ì‹¬, and ë°•ì¢…ìˆ™, are designated holders of this Intangible Asset.

The lyrics are pretty random, lots of references to farming, family and courtship. Below are the lyrics to track 7 (Uh-ung taryeong):

Worried the only son might get sick/ For what do we catch a frog?/ Caught a frog to make soup for a precious son who is thin and weak/ On the mountain out back, a crow builds its house in an old tree/ Look at the samll boy, holding a steel hammer/ Just blinking his eyes.

Sorry for not including track names here. There are 23 tracks and I don't feel like writing them all out.
