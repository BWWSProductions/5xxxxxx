,crepesdrapes,2009-11-22T22:53Z,"Thanks excellent as usual,Realy do appreciate the hard work that you do."
,Vern666,2009-11-28T08:04Z,"Thanks for the upload. FLAC iz da bomb.

This is a censored version of the CD e.g. in Bad Romance, ""Bitch"" is chopped off to ""Bit"". Maybe there is no uncensored CD. God damn Wal-Mart to Hell."
,acfreema,2009-12-03T09:15Z,"joires, your tone is unacceptable.  has it ever occurred to you that no one had to upload this for you to download it?"
,Lichen_King,2009-12-03T10:03Z,"Yeah censored version, can anyone upload the uncensored in FLAC or Apple Lossless?"
,Assistman,2009-12-21T13:23Z,"Bubanee,i want to know if this cd is taken from the fame monster deluxe version.And what version is?International,US,Japanese?"
,dilpill,2009-12-28T06:50Z,"Unfortunately there hasn't been a CD release of most of the uncensored tracks, so we'll have to wait a while for FLAC versions of those...

iTunes Australia did release uncensored versions of Monster and Dance in the Dark however."
,riplikethat,2010-01-14T04:04Z,"Censored songs? What a bunch of cunts. These motherfucking religious cunts who want to censor every piece of fucking media out there need to die out and join the fucking fossil age FAST.

Too bad it won't happen until we are all dead. But after I am dead and if there is hell, I will go around shoving my cock in their asses as their punishment. "
,groove420,2010-03-05T19:57Z,"Downloaded this last month, today got a letter from a lawyer's office, they state the name and hash of this torrent in the letter, and my ISP and IP. They want me to pay $1200. No this isn't B.S, seriously I'm looking at the letter right now in hand. How can I block these bastards with high confidence in not getting anymore of these letters wanting big bucks from me?. Thanks for any ideas, and thanks for the music bubanee.
I only download from VIP or Trusted members on PB anymore period."
,Dooovde,2010-03-25T21:11Z,@groove420 all you need to say is that your WIFI connection must've been hacked into and someone living near you did this and not you. Might help to wipe all evidence if you can.
