,romeo57,2009-12-19T15:10Z,Can this work on a desktop computer?
,theREALdideron,2009-12-23T08:24Z,You suck ass! This thing fucked up a perfectly good instance of Vista along with the copy of 7 I wanted to try out. Had to reformat both drives and reinstall Vista. I definitely don't recommend this to system builders!
,slobinh,2010-01-17T21:32Z,"LOL @ theREALdideron
some System Builder you are.

When you do something petty, like upgrade and OS and run some haxor software on it..... 
Maybe, just maybe you should consider doing a backup 1st.

and btw, theREALdideron is just called Dideron"

Can I phone Microsoft (for technical support)  and give them my fake product ID safely though?

Thanks!"

Will it work on my 7600 build?"
,MaxWhite,2012-06-09T10:04Z,"@vicki_v

Yeah, it supports both.
You can tell by the amount of updates it will start downloading as soon as it's activated.

the first three days you're going to be rebooting the computer alot.

but i haven't gotten a  ""pirated copy of"" message yet, and i've downloaded C# and C from the microsoft wwebsite(something only activated users can do) so it thinks it's genuine."
