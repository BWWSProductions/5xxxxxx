,patchesonhat,2009-11-15T01:26Z,Its the real deal...Thanx OP. good movie too. 
,Tryst49,2009-11-15T04:43Z,Look for the green or mauve skull & crossbones. Sign of a trusted uploader.
,Bombardem,2009-11-15T06:18Z,"the skulls have been hacked a couple times recently, so caveat emptor"
,AB2ZZ,2009-11-15T08:35Z,"I don't want to look like the dumb one, but I am new to .rar how do i put it on disk?"
,Bombardem,2009-11-15T21:42Z,"Download WINRAR or some other utility, I like 7Zip myself, extract it and it becomes a normal .avi or whatever video file. Then use ConvertX to put it on disk."
,ohshow,2009-11-16T04:08Z,Video and audio are both great!
