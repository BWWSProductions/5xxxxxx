The patch doesn't work for me, it says error, when I double-clicked on the exe. I have the RELOADED version of the Ice&Blood by extremezone: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5150766/Sacred_2_Ice_And_Blood_RELOADED, and the Fallen Angel (12.7 gb) by circlensess: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4462201/Sacred_2__Fallen_Angel. Both of them are UK version, so I had no problem to play with 2.64.0.0 patch. Do I need to download the bigger (about 19.98 gb) size of Fallen Angel? If so, then the Makan747 or the circlensess?: http://thepiratebay.org/search/Sacred%202/0/5/0"
