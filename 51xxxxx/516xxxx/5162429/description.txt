A short 9 track instrumental album originally conceived for the short film, After Dark. The music changes tone from Sound Like's previous EP, The Critical & The Denial (also available for free download). After Dark brings a soundscape of electronics and dark ambient noises.


Sounds Like is an Irish musical group with revolving members. The main interest is in making the music they want to make, and not what they are told to make. The music is made available for free to try and promote a new system for the distribution of music, as the current one is failing dramatically. Sounds Like will return with a new EP that blends the sounds of the two previous EPs.

The band can also be found on Facebook, though you'll have to search there.


Please enjoy the music and share as best you can. It is all free to reproduce and can be used without restrictions (within reason) as long as the appropriate author is credited.



Relax, sit back and enjoy!
