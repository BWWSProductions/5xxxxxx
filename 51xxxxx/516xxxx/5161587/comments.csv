,kilatonka,2009-11-14T19:38Z,"hello
what software are u using to rip films from disk

cheers"
,supermansaleen,2009-11-14T20:56Z,"Well I use a variety of programs, but Transformers 2 was a unique case in that DVDFab was used to make the rip, after of course, using AnyDVD to remove the copy protection."
,rune4000,2009-11-15T10:43Z,How do I burn a film this size to a dvd? 
,eddievalentin,2009-11-15T11:04Z,"rune4000, mate u need a Dual Layer DVD, or a DVD9. ItÂ´s an ISO file so itsÂ´ easy as pie."
,rune4000,2009-11-15T11:07Z,"Thanks eddie, just what I thought. Cheers."
,supermansaleen,2009-11-15T13:05Z,"You can squeeze this on to a regular DVD too with something like Nero, but I don't recommend it at all. Spend the extra few bucks for Dual Layer DVDs"
,jawman,2009-12-30T19:27Z,"please seed!!
thanks :)"
,jawman,2009-12-30T21:19Z,"i don't know why I set my up speed to unlimited when other cocksuckers don't seed for shit. my up speed is 140kB/s and my down is only 40kB/s on a 7.54GiB file.
people, don't cap your uploads unless you're going to cap your downloads by that much. fully seed the torrent so that your share ratio is >1.5 before you remove them."
,supermansaleen,2010-01-04T23:16Z,"I know how you feel jawman...being the uploader of these torrents I do the best to keep them all seeded, but with only 220k up I can only do so much once I get the torrent fully seeded. It really sucks, I just noticed with Unleashed I have a share ratio of 8.94, uploaded just about 70 GB and only have 3 fucking seeds"
,MoviesR101,2011-07-08T14:12Z,"@supermansaleen - Thanks for the up! I would think DvdFab is all you need to to a clean rip? DvdFab removes all copy protections, no need to use AnyDvd or anything else?"
,supermansaleen,2012-07-06T02:27Z,"DVDFab didnt seem to remove the copy protection, not sure why."
