It took me some time to crop the original video file to standard aspect ratio (the original was 4:3 and had huge black areas beneath and above the motio picture), so I hope you will enjoy this edited version... The Sicilian is a crime drama writen by Mario Puzzo, diredted by Michael Cimino and starring Christopher Lambert. 

There are Serbian subtitles included as a separate file in this torrent.
