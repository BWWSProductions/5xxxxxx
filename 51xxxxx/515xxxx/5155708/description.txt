This collection was designed for the Smashing Pumpkin fan who became lost in the confusion of the Zeitgeist era. There is a lot of unreleased, unheard, and hard to find material floating around that really helped to shape the entire period, and I've contained as much of it as possible.

A new era is coming now with plenty of great music on the way, and I hope this collection can pay tribute to the last two years of beautiful, highly misunderstood and under rated music.

If you find yourself enjoying a lot of this material, please go out and buy "If All Goes Wrong", the 2 disc DVD set. The documentary shows off a great vibe of where the band was coming from at the time of the reunion, and where they are headed. The performance included is live from the Fillmore, one of the highlights being their
jam session "Gossamer" which at around 35 minutes is absolutely epic. Here I've only included the previous unheard clips from songs "Corsage in Flames" and "Orpheus Descending" and 1-2 other gems like the live version of Death From Above - the rest is for you to explore on your own.

If you'd like to support the band in another way you can also go to livesmashingpumpkins.com and purchase soundboard quality tracks and full shows from the 20th Anniversary Tour. Songs that were played include; Bodies, Soma, Galapagos, Cupid de Locke, I of the Mourning, Crestfallen, Mayonaise, The Beginning is the End is the Beginning, etc.


The band will be releasing a 44 track collection [11 four track EP's] entitled "Teargarden by Kaleidyscope"  which will be available online FOR FREE over the course of the next couple years. As a result, I've included a live teaser EP featuring some of these new songs performed during the Spirits in the Sky tour with such friends as  Kerry Brown, Linda Strawberry, Mark Tulin, and Dave Navarro to name a few, from their Cellar Door performance on 08-26-09.

UPDATE:  The first Teargarden track has been released. It's A Song For A Son. Download it now from smashingpumpkins.com!


SUPPORT THE BAND. SUPPORT THE MUSIC. ROCK THE FUCK ON.


Long Live The Mighty SP.

P.S. - I'd also like to thank the many tapers who made some of the bootlegs included in this torrent possible. Without you, we would have no documentation of some parts of this very interesting era in the band's history, for you do not get nearly the credit you deserve.
