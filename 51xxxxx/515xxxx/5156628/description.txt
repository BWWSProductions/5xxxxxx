This is Season 4 of MTV's The State.  It has been transcoded to be compatible with Ipod Classic, but will play nicely on your computer with any current freeware media player (like VLC, or MPC-HC).  
Here are the specs on the transcoding
Video : Codec H.264, 320 x 240, Quality Based = 20 (~400 kbps), 20 FPS, Baseline Profile, Level = 3.0, 1 Pass encode, X264 Encoder
Audio : Codec He-AAC V2 48 kbps Nero Encoder (It's all talk, so low bitrate is fine)
As a bonus, included are two audio tracks.  The second audio track is the commentary.  Simply select the second audio track in your media player to listen to it.  
*Note Itunes 9 will be needed to listen to the HE-AAC audio.  Any current media player like VLC will have no problems with the file. I will be releasing the rest of the series and the extras as time goes on.  Check my username for updates.  Although each file is only 80 MB, the quality is good enough for most screens, especially an IPOD.  It is almost the same quality as the DVD on my 22" LCD. Please help seed, I will seed to atleast 1500% and occasionally afterward.
