Compiled by Brian Hopper it features unreleased recordings from the musicians who unintentionally created a Canterbury Scene; Caravan, Mike Ratledge, Brian & Hugh Hopper, Zobe, Soft Machine, Kevin Ayers and the mighty Robert Wyatt. These historic recordings capture the genesis of musical development and range of musical experimentation from within this unique scene. The tracks come from a variety of sources such as quarter inch reel to reel tapes, compact cassettes, acetates and reference discs.

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
