[V],-jonny-,2009-11-12T18:14Z,you've already asked for oceans
,soniqeve,2009-11-13T11:56Z,"thanks jonny, you're the best!

is there a chance for any classic bond movies beside goldfinger sometime soon?"
,oamyoh,2009-11-15T20:03Z,Nice to see some Christmas related movies at the end of year. Hope some other classics like A Christmas Story (1983) or Black Christmas (1974) will be uploaded as well.
,RDeadOne,2009-12-04T03:56Z,"Awesome quality torrent, but subtitles are hardcoded and cannot be removed."
,bumjeans,2009-12-28T16:20Z,Looks awesome.  But the original mono soundtrack should be included as the 5.1 is truely terrible - very echoey and reverb!
[V],-jonny-,2010-01-24T15:03Z,The subtitles are NOT hardcoded.
[T],Jonzee,2010-11-28T16:36Z,"Some players will display the subtitles thinking they are part of the video file.  I have the same problem when I use media player classic sometimes, KMPlayer may help?"
,loudog4330,2010-12-02T04:28Z,Thanks man! My mom loves A Christmas Carol and this will help her out a lot. If anyone can find Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol that would be awesome also!
,SiLENT_RiP,2010-12-19T01:49Z,"@loudog4330: Mr. Magoo version is available on TPB.
