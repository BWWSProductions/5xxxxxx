,suisenbenjo,2009-11-10T17:52Z,I know graphics aren't everything but this game is pathetic even for rockstar. 
,DaNtsu,2009-11-12T22:17Z,uhm what.. how old is this game?

,sauehue11,2009-11-18T15:32Z,"want 2 download this game, and were happy as a MF when i saw it, because heard a lot about it. but is the graphics poor generarly or do it have something 2 do with the upload?"
,scott_ehm,2009-11-19T05:56Z,"Works fine. Great game :) If you like Thief and other stealth gizames, you may like this. It seems a little less demented than its predecessor, but has a bit more story going for it, if that matters. Hide from small children. Prolly buy it soon, Rockstar is pretty solid."
,andyy,2009-11-19T13:24Z,"I simply have no idea what im doing wrong on this torrent. I download the file, mount it with daemon tools, install it and copy the crack over. still it just wont work for me. I've tried downloading several times incase some files was missing, but nothing.. I also keep getting messages that the crack is a trojan but I even turned off my Anti Virus so i could copy it over.. still nothing. If somebody could help out here I would be really pleased.. :)"

Sorry for my bad english."
,Torgard,2009-11-28T23:51Z,"Just to get this straight for you people :P

This game was released for the PS2, PSP and Wii in 2007, I think.

And now, the PC version was released November 6th.

And the graphics, well duh, Rockstar were never really ahead on the graphics, so this is their result for 2007 PS2 graphs :/"
,Torgard,2009-11-28T23:52Z,"Oh, and thanks for the upload :D
Been waiting ages for Rockstar to release this to the PC

game works flawlessly for me :)"

,Neverb0rn,2011-09-23T12:41Z,"btw it does seem to hang up on install about 3/4 through when it hits the audio files like the earlier comment says but if u wait 3-4 mins it keeps going. just be patient. i guess thats what the previous commenter meant when his next comment on the hanging up issue was ""nevermind"""
,Psythik,2012-03-23T16:49Z,"Is this the uncut, AO rated version?"
,metalmaniac420,2012-05-18T23:27Z,"yup this is the uncut version! im on the 3rd level. you dont need the activation code, after you mount the .iso and install the game go to my computer and explore the virtual drive to find the crack file, then just drag and drop that in the main directory where you installed the game to replace original icon. Then your good to go massacre folks! oh and yea the game hung up during install of audio and movie files but IT WILL finish! 100% working for me, thanks great stuff!"
,rosenrotvosa,2012-05-22T20:45Z,"Awesome upload. Installed flawlessly, runs like a charm. Thanks, AiTB. I look forward to more PC games."

I did everything from mounting the iso to installing the game and i did copied the crack file from the virtual drive and pasted it on the main directory folder where i placed the files but when I open the application it shows that the cursor loads but doesnt continue to the game, i tried uninstalling and re installing no success"
