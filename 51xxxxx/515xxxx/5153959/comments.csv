,Loginer,2010-01-22T23:28Z,"Just a bit of input. The game runs just fine with the OR2006C2C.exe that's unpacked by default (one AV found a heuristic result on VirusTotal, but I'm sure it's a false positive). 

However, there's a .rar file in the folder which contains another executable with the same name. I assume it's an alternative crack, but unlike the first one, this one loads a lot of other, suspicious instructions from advapi32.dll related to starting services and writing registry keys. I'd suggest you all stay away from that one, as it may contain a trojan.

With that said, thanks for the upload."
