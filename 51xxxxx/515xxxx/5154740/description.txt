These are the first ten books of the "Left behind" series, by Tim LaHaye & Jerry B. Jenkins (Leftbehind.com/01_products/browse.asp?section=LeftBehind). The .lit files are open by "Microsoft Reader" (http://www.microsoft.com/Reader/), the .pdb ones are intended to be open by PalmReader. They are included in the "Left behind iLumina Edition" software (http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?isbn=0842373233&p=1016568). The latter is ideally compatible with "Windows XP".
