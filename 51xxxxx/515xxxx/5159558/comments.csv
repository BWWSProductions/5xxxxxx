,lysandra,2009-11-15T00:08Z,"Gambit, the pirate bay tracker went down and eztv doesn't use any backup trackers.  If you check to make sure that your torrent program has DHT and peer exchange enabled, you will probably still be able to connect but it will most likely be very slow and go offline completely for hours at a time.  Hopefully the tracker will be back up soon."
,lysandra,2009-11-15T00:15Z,"I just tried adding http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce and utorrent found hundreds of seeders, so try that.  I can't give you details on how to do that since I don't know what torrent program you use, so you'll have to google."
