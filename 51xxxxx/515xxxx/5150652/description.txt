Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

11/06/09 Rundown: Ant Out, Sharon Osbourne vs Susan Boyle, Mars 
Knows Stuff, Bill Burr and Doug Stanhope in-studio, Dumb Intern 
Evan, Big A, Pat From Moonachie and Dr. Steve in-studio, Yoko Ono 
on Jimmy Fallon.



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
