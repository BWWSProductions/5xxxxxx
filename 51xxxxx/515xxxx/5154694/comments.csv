,fhunter76,2009-11-09T18:15Z,Can anyone confirm that Warden's Keep and Stone Prisoner actually work with this release of the DLC?
,Melted_Igloo,2009-11-09T19:00Z,i dont think the new areas show up for anyone that isnt authorized
,TiLLseed,2009-11-09T19:14Z,"These are exactly the same files as posted in a previous torrent, so yes, they're cracked and working.

,Vegasbob,2009-11-10T02:31Z,"Anyone have a link for WHERE this content is supposed to appear? Other than Stone Prisoner And Wardens keep I understand those are quests and how they are started. But after I added this to my game only some of the items popped into my inventory. BD Armor, Memory Band, Lions Paw, Helm of the Deep, Lucky Stone, Keepers Ring, Embri's Many Pockets, The Edge, Amulet of the War Mage all appeared in inventory or I already had them. I have heard some of the others must be purchased from a vendor but anyone know a bioware link with details about when/where you get them? "
,Squigibo,2009-11-10T15:13Z,"Yes, all DLC's work and confirmed.
They show up on the main title screen, hit downloadable content, then click on the top tab ""Installed"" and they show up there."

,Kissekotte,2009-11-11T14:32Z,"I can't even see the text from the conversations. That's annoying. I can't see a damn text. I would be happy if someone could tell me what's wrong?

And all my NPC's in the game got a really weird name like Dr00f_Alistra , something like that..

,thority,2009-11-12T05:29Z,"this is weird
the updater wont allow me to install the first and the third .dazip file. it just crashes along with the whole system. im on xp. any ideas how to fix this?"
[V],matimike,2009-11-12T14:28Z,"works perfectly, thank you Groo great job"
,Cloako,2009-11-12T18:37Z,Worked like a charm. Thanks.
,rusky-22,2009-11-12T18:57Z,"This worked great, I have the SKIDROW version and updated with the patch, and installed the DLC and works great. Great upload thanks so much.  I thought id never get to play the DLC's so again thanks a bunch. :)"
,TheRealMoot,2009-11-13T04:47Z,"Worked great! Thanks! I completed both off the DLC packs and can safely say they are not worth that much money; They're both like an hour long! Dragon age is awesome, but the DLC is a total scam. So I didn't buy them... No problems found in the Any of the DLC packs and all the bonus items work just fine! Thanks for the torrent."
,CommandoRick,2009-11-13T05:11Z,can anyone tell me if this works with a purchased steam copy of the game?
,ketchupm,2009-11-13T08:24Z,is it working
,jazzan0va,2009-11-13T20:19Z,Ohhhh yeah its working!!!! Thank you!

,11western,2009-11-15T21:31Z,"I d/l'ed this and got all dazips? What agebin , dauploader,etc.
please help this looks like a cool game!
thx"
,RhymesMatter,2009-11-16T01:32Z,So many ppl said that it is critical that you install the DLC to 1.0 version of the game and then patch to 1.01a if you want adding that the patch is a total troublemaker to many ppl as it prevents from starting or if applied before the DLC it doesn't function correctly!is this all true or what?
,kenryoku_one,2009-11-16T06:49Z,Thank you
,Protke,2009-11-18T16:07Z,"Does this pack just put these new items in your inventory, or does it make you actually WORK for them (as it should be)?"
,evilhyde,2009-11-18T19:28Z,Can't get Warden's Keep or Stone Prisoner to install.  All the others work fine but I get the error:  Couldn't load manifest file (could be bad dazip archive).  I'm using the SKIDROW DA (no patch) and running Windows XP.  Anyone know a fix?
,Flowjah,2009-11-19T04:25Z,Working great. Thanks!
,KracKils,2009-11-19T16:50Z,"Unable to get the map icon for Honnleath to show up. I've uninstalled reinstalled etc. Tried before and after patch. Able to talk to the guy at Sulchers pass and get the control rod but after that I'm sol.

Originally had the same difficulty with Soldier's Peak but uninstalling the DLC and reinstalling it fixed it.

Any ideas on how to resolve the issue? I've been browsing tech forumns trying to find a solution for a few days with no luck."
,ToedragBackhandShelf,2009-11-22T21:49Z,"After installed the DLCs, how come all the new items are in my inventory before I even complete the quests? It kind of defeats the purpose of play the DLC quests if I already have the items. Is there any way to get around this?"
,MinorityWhore,2009-11-24T00:00Z,"I installed the SKIDROW version of the game and then did as said in torrent to install the dlc's.
i havent patched becaus last time i did that i couldnt enter the game anymore. once inside the game i can see the dlc's under installed content but i dont get any items in my backpack and i cant use any of the content. since i see the dlc's are installed i guess i should be able to use them.. what should i do?? i rly dont wanna risk reinstalling the game once more if the patch should mess things up again.."
,origin478,2009-11-24T13:12Z,Which of the files is Warden's Keep cuz thats all I need.
,mrpras,2009-11-24T19:52Z,"I had the same thing, DLC installed fine and then I had many of the items already.. There's a simple solution to this, just destroy them straight away and then carry on playing as normal..

Kinda obvious right? Sure it's a workaround but hey if you want it to work properly, go buy it and bitch about bugs to bioware :)

Great game :)"
,rsborl,2009-11-29T18:20Z,"hey u dumbass noobs, the reason why u get those items as soon as you install is because they're bonus items not associated with a quest, for example some of the items you get for having the collector's edition right when you start the game

this pack includes all those freebie items, including the collectors edition items

for the quest-related items you dont get them after install


so if u destroyed the new items u suck noob"
,nikrusty,2009-12-03T07:30Z,"nice torrent, but dude always put an NFO in it. I need to search again for this link to know what was in it. And how to install it"
,Hoowaa,2009-12-03T19:33Z,"I agree with rsborl. 

OMG, are you people really this stupid? The items you get in your inventories are MEANT to be there. They are freebies... wow I can't believe you actually thought it was a bug and deleted the items LMFAO..."
,Hoowaa,2009-12-03T19:39Z,"Groo_The_Wanderer

Can you upload the new DLC? It's called Return To Ostagar"
,Hoowaa,2009-12-04T01:00Z,Nevermind my previous post. The Return To Ostagar DLC isn't out yet.
,rmbowie,2009-12-04T21:01Z,works great :)
,FTL3,2009-12-09T03:06Z,"DRAGON AGE LATEST PATCH 1.02 + CRACK HERE:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5204883/%5BFTL3%5D_DRAGON_AGE_1.02_PATCH___CRACK_WORKING

Balance

    * Daggers now apply 0.5 points of damage per additional point in dexterity and 0.5 points of damage per additional point in strength, as originally intended. This increases dagger damage for high-dexterity characters.
    * During combat, mana or stamina reserves now correctly regenerate more quickly when reserves are low. This allows players to occasionally use an talent or spell in the later stages of lengthy fights.
    * When exploring, mana and stamina now regenerate more quickly at higher character levels. This reduces downtime between fights.
    * The spells Force Field, Crushing Prison, Cone of Cold, and Blizzard now have shorter durations and/or longer cooldowns. This ensures that combatants can no longer stun-lock each other by repeatedly casting the same spell.
    * The cooldowns for several low-level sustained abilities are now shorter. This ensures that players are not penalized for accidentally deactivating them.
    * Certain battles were not scaling properly, resulting in excessively difficult fights. They now scale as intended.
    * Enemy corpses now drop health poultices and money more appropriately, resulting in less clutter in the player's inventory. 

Gameplay

    * In rare cases, enemy corpses were selectable when they contained no loot. This no longer occurs.
    * Party members whose combat tactics were set to defensive behavior no longer stop attacking after using a spell or talent.
    * In rare cases, combat tactics conditions could fail to determine whether a character had enough mana or stamina to use an ability. This no longer occurs.
    * The Rally talent no longer repeats its audio effect if it is active during certain conversations.
    * The Rally talent no longer deactivates upon area transitions or conversations.
    * The Shimmering Shield spell now deactivates when the character is out of mana. 

Plot *Spoiler Warning*

    * Promotional downloadable content items now remain in the player's inventory when standard items are removed at the end of the dwarf noble origin.
    * Repeatedly talking to Duncan after gathering the vials in the Korcari Wilds but not the treaties no longer provides duplicate experience.
    * Leliana's personal plot can now be completed if the player substantially increased her approval (through gifts) before talking to her.
    * During the siege of Redcliffe, enemies are no longer able to spawn in locations that would break the plot.
    * Bann Teagan no longer disappears when he is supposed to be accessible during Urn of Sacred Ashes. 

PC Specific

    * Controlling a summoned creature (like a ranger's pets) during certain special area transitions no longer results in odd behavior.
    * Creating a character in a custom module did not create a folder for saves. This could result in corruption of main campaign saves. This no longer occurs.
    * In some cases, the class icon was set incorrectly for characters imported from the downloadable Character Creator. This no longer occurs.
    * The options menu now includes a setting to automatically download previously purchased content that is not currently installed.
    * After installing new downloadable content, the game now always reminds the user to restart the game.
    * The icons for some promotional downloadable content items were missing. They now appear correctly.
    * The screenshot upload GUI would stop working from time to time on the client. There was a memory override that was fixed. It is a client fix. It doesn't affect the other problems we have seen on the server. 		"

,Rusery,2010-01-09T20:48Z,I actually feel kind of bad for this game because its so damned good. I feel i should buy it and support the game and its releases. On the other hand you try and look into the future and see all the money that you would otherwise sink into this game and its mind boggling especially with the expansion(s)/add-ons coming out. GO GO PIRATING!!! Thanks a ton Groo!
,calvn,2010-01-11T07:34Z,"@ManchesterUtd4ever

save the game before you speak to the man behind the barrier and if it bugs out just reload and try again. its a known bug. i didn't have the issue i just read about it.

its not an issue with the installation so need to reinstall."

so my question is can i still install and use these dlcs keeping in mind i have 1.03 or would it be trivial to do so because i can simply go onto awakening and skip all this?( im still going thru original atm ) "

if so, is the installation procedure the same as the one listed above in the install instructions?

also, does this torrent work for Dragon Age patched to 1.03 without the expansion? in the same way as above?

thanks, guys."
,Makeswell,2010-06-15T22:33Z,"if you patch to 1.03 then install this first, then patch. also, if you install Awakening, then, because Awakening includes patch 1.03 in itself, then you must install this before you install Awakening.
