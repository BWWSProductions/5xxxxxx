About the Series

A Short History of Ireland started on 27 March, 2006 and ran for a total of 240 episodes, taking an historical journey spanning the Ice Age, the arrival of Christianity, the Viking era, Brian Boru, the Norman invasion, the plantation and the famine through to the creation of the Irish Free State.

Written by Dr. Jonathan Bardon OBE, QUB, each programme was read by local actors Frances Tomelty, James Greene and Richard Dormer, who interweave eye-witness accounts, letters and diary extracts from the times with the historical facts.
