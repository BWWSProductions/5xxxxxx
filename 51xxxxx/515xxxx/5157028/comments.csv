I got annoyed with DivX not playing some types of movie format so tried VLC and have never looked back!
What you got to loose? ;)"

Just checked to see how many torrents you have uploaded, seems like none.  Just another leechers who would rather complain then download the correct codecs.  You can always purchase the DVD if you are not happy with the way morphaeus08 uploaded these.  You should be happy that he took the time to upload these in any format for people like you.  Cheers Morphaeus08 for uploading these, much appreciated."
