,00110001,2009-11-20T21:41Z,Thank you. I can confirm that this works for single player. not sure if MP works. will update later.
,DofusOctopus,2009-11-21T15:07Z,"You are killing our chances of being respected pc gamers by downloading this ... IW will never respect us and continue to take away the advanced services ... like dedicated servers ... 

go and buy this game and make an impact on them ... so they get off there asses and do something about there server system ... 

Its a measly ÂŁ30 in stores ... 

They will keep updating the game and make it harder to crack (multiplayer) 

I did it for 2 days and thought fuck this (BUY IT)"

seriously, if the game was cheap, i'd buy it. but i refuse to pay $60.00 for a 5-hour campaign and limited MP. i bought left 4 dead 2 and mass effect and other games i liked but these call of duty games are just cash cows. don't tell THIEVES that they are stealing, they already know that, dumbass."

then the game companys win.. 

by making & passing buggy ass half made games full of cd key checks & other annoyances 
that effectively ruin the experience accusing their own *legit* customers as being thieves that they actually sell the shit too..

in other words fuck you

arrrrrrr
