Acrobat has been bought a few years ago from Adobe, and now it's known as the Adobe Acrobat Reader. Are you looking for the PDF editor, not the reader standalone? I've seen a Pro version of it, but it's some hundreds of MB, quite difficult to make it Portable..."

It depends what you want to do. Usually people edits the files using Word or similar, and create the PDF file using a virtual PDF Printer. Sometimes it happens that you need to modify a PDF file, and for this there are some programs that help you to convert it back to Word format. Some of them also don't care if the PDF file is password protected too..."
