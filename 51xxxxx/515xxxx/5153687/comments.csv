,jersson,2009-11-09T05:17Z,Ive tried all vers of Diskeeper 2009 (latest) but noone works. Any chance you might do a portable one that works ???

I've tried already, but DK 2k9 is too deeply tied to the system, no way to make it work. Out of my capabilities. Let's hope in someone else better than me to this... :o)"

I gave up all other defraggers when I found my performance did not really improve from one to the other and having read soooooooo many articles on the MINOR improvements between which company you choose.

Auslogic's defrag has done a great job for me. Been using it for 2 years. Barely any footprint, fast, does the job. Might be very easy to make that portable too.

I have not bothered using anything else after all my benchmarking showed minimal improvements using something like Diskeeper or PerfectDisk - which was my favorite."
,brianxxx,2009-11-09T17:24Z,ALSO - just for advice...putting my pagefile on a separate hard drive or separate dedicated partition will do wonders at keeping your C -system partition from getting messy. It barely ever needs to be defragged any more.
[V],NoExcuses,2009-11-09T17:29Z,"Well, they are already delivering also a Portable version of their program. you can get it at this link:

Free, and Portable too... :o)"
