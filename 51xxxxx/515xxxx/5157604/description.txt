This is a proper decrypt for DAO DLC which will enable Warden's Keep, Stone's Keep and the other items that require authorisation.

Just copy the .bat and .exe to the folder with all your .dazips, and run the .bat.

Remember to change all My DocumentsBioWareDragon AgeSettingsAddIns.xml authorisation variables to 0.

Enjoy!
