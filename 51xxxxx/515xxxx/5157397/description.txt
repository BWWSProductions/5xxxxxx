Storyline: Until now, Brad and Kate had always managed to avoid spending Christmas 
with their family by escaping to exotic lands to enjoy heavenly vacations. But this year, they failed. When they 
arrive at the airport, all the flights have been canceled. Even worse, a television news crew interviews them, 
revealing to their family where they are. This time, there's no way out and no excuses. Brad's father is waiting 
for them at his house. So is Kate's mother. And Brad's mother and Kate's father. Four family Christmases, the same 
day! Brad and Kate expect the worse... and they won't be disappointed. They will be spared of nothing. In between 
humiliations, the secrets each one of them had carefully kept from the other, the hard feelings and impossible 
situations, the couple will live through a day that might be the last their relationship can stand.
