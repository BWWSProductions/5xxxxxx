Junkopia

Chris Markerâ€™s 1981 short film Junkopia is now available for viewing online at Ubu.com. Thanks to Nate Lavey for the heads-up. Notable are the foregrounding of the sonic elements that were always present in Markerâ€™s films, yet often took a more subliminal position in deference to the commentary, which here is explicitly abstained from, as the add-on â€œframingâ€ of the film provided by arte points out.

This style of sound painting recalls Holgar Czukay and David Sylvianâ€™s Plight and Premonition and Biosphereâ€™s Substrata â€“ ambient atmospherics integrating radio wave sampling that Markerâ€™s otherworldly sonic backdrops predate by a long shot (watch La JetÃ©e someday with your eyes closed :>).
Junkopia Owl

Commuters from the East Bay to San Francisco will be familiar with this no manâ€™s landscape in Emeryville culled from the floatable spare parts of the city, washed ashore. The animal forms, such as the watchful tinfoil owl above, receive their due attention, as is so often the case in Markerâ€™s productions, whatever the scale.
