,ashwinn,2009-11-12T12:46Z,great movie..please upload whiskey mit wodka with english subtitles
,epicmaster,2010-05-14T07:06Z,will try
,chordata,2010-05-20T21:02Z,"Note: This contains ""hard"" subtitles, which are burned on to the video and cannot be hidden or erased. Download only if you are sure you always want the English subtitles. (Good of the uploader to suggest this in the title; it's worse when people burn hard subs and don't even mention it.)"
,Flashman34S,2010-06-25T16:09Z,"I'm bilingual in German and English, and the subtitles are fairly poorly done. Entire sentences are omitted and the nuances of others are lost.

The video is a bit pixelated at times, but the audio quality is fine."
,skilld,2010-07-01T09:30Z,"good movie 10/10 overall
very deep and depressing i dont recommend it if u cry over love storys this was all doom and gloom for 3hrs other tahn that i loved it, great acting and them speaking in german makes the movie seem more legit and makes u really feel like you were in the last days with hitler and germany.
quality = 10/10
movie plot= 10/10"

Seriously, this is an excellent movie and I recommend it to everyone.

Don't think that because a family member of yours was killed there you should study the subject?"

An article about this in german:

05.05.2009
Constantin Film verschickt massenhaft Abmahnungen an private Filesharer im Internet und fordert 800 Euro Schadensersatz. Die Telekom und andere ISPs sollen anhand von IP-Adressen die Kundendaten herausgegeben haben."
,WayofWyrd,2011-01-12T19:44Z,"I've downloaded the movie, and both parts played fine on the computer - quality looked excellent.

But I've got another problem, and hope someone could help me out:

I have tried burning the film unto a DVD-R, so that it could be watched on a regular TV/DVD-player. I've already done this with other movies downloaded from thepiratebay.org (which had the same fileformat as this one), and it worked fine, but when I burn out this AVI-version of 'Der Untergang', it won't play on my external DVD-player.

Basically, I'm using the Nero StartSmart Essentials software, choosing the 'Make Data-DVD' from the menu, adding the AVI-video-files I want to burn out, and finishing the next basic steps. When playing the DVD-R in my DVD-player, I get up a menu on the TV-screen where the different film-clips are listed up - when choosing the movie-clip I want to watch, then choosing enter/play, all the movie I've burned out using this technique will begin to play, but not in this case of 'Der Untergang'. What's the reason for this? It really annoys me, and I've already made a few useless DVD-R's since it doesn't work out the way it should.
I'm not a computer-expert, so I hope someone can tell me what's wrong..."
,jakeou812,2011-01-14T20:44Z,"@Durian555 Go ahead and watch all their stuff, but don't pay for any of it. They took down a bunch of cool parody videos on youtube. If I really like a movie, I will buy it, even if I already have a downloaded copy, but when they pull that crap they wont get a cent from me. When Metalica helped to shut down napster, I downloaded all their crap, and burned it to give to my friends and family so they'd never have to pay for a Metalica CD again."
,maddys_comm,2011-01-31T19:19Z,"good movie...though in german but with eng subs...
