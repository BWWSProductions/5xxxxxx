,Gugle,2009-11-09T11:34Z,"I know that many of you do not care about what others think about the movie, you are just interested in quality, right... I know, and I respect that... BUT... HOLLY SHIT, this movie is crap. Do not waste your time and bandwidth. I did not listen, and I wasted hour and a half of my life."
,Gugle,2009-11-09T11:35Z,Wondering how this crap got so many seeders...
,unidogma,2009-11-09T21:55Z,Dont bother - Silly slow crapy acting just spoils this movie and ruins any chance of take off right from the start!!!
,billyt123,2009-11-10T01:20Z,crap movie - download and enjoy the pain
,HumZ_,2009-11-10T02:53Z,"I hurt my brain by watching this movie, terrible :/
really like the ending, not .. what even happened? "
,N8tHeGR88,2009-11-10T08:31Z,Very cheaply made movie that sucked horribly and made absolutely no sense
,NerdCore47,2009-11-11T00:34Z,"Wow. This movie is painful to watch - the acting leaves a lot to be desired, but still worth a watch - if you love B Sci-fi, that is...."
,sleeper31204,2009-11-12T01:24Z,"yeah this is good quality ut it is such a horrible movie, i skipped through just to check it out and got no more than half way through it and deleted it. a 10 v 10 m -32  "
,frigidcoldbreeze,2009-11-13T06:15Z,"""80 mins of people standing around screaming and dying"" 
LOL nice one flamemc. laughed my ass off"
,perryl,2009-11-13T08:12Z,"i dont see why so many people hated this movie. when the actors werent talking it was pretty good. 
A: 7 was kinda quiet in some parts but that could have been part of the movie.
V: 10 looked fantastic on my screen.
M: 5 worth the watch if you like to see people die, lol. it was decent, definatly a great idea, special effects were good. but i think after effects they couldnt affford real actors so you dont get very good acting, still worth the download if you like to see some gore and killing and that. 
80 mins of people screaming and dying is inaccurate, its more like 50 mins of people screaming and dying. the first 30 mins is all building up to the story. "
,Neutron407,2009-11-15T08:21Z,"calling this film a ""B"" rated movie would be giving this movie props... fuck that this movie was madd gay and stupid. its an ""F"" rated movie. too cheap!"
,DustiFinga,2009-11-26T19:57Z,"The Crapout

Here's the plot:

It's Crapmas Eve, the city goes to crap, and the few remaining tenants of The Crapwood find themselves crapping their pants in their crappy buildings' crappers. And they are crap. Mothercrapper.

Tag line:

What the Crap?


Quotes: Crapuel Crapson: ""I'm tired of these mothercrapping crappers taking a
crap in my crapper.""
Crap Craple: ""Crapply my dear, I don't give a crap.""

Tivia: There is so much crap in this film, the production team had to ship in crap
from 47 different countries.

Goofs: In one scene we clearly see piss. This is obviously wrong, as it should
of been crap."
