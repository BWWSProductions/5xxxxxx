,gearofwar,2009-11-14T21:41Z,"And once again, for the 6th time, SpandauBaby makes the world a better place."
,vandergraaf100,2009-11-14T23:58Z,I only got into this kind of music about ten years ago and friends have always told me Id barely scratched the surface...........how right they were! Nice one Spandaubaby cant wait for prt 7!
,Faergens,2009-11-15T14:19Z,"Thank you! Very very nice collection. Any particular reason you have organized the music the way you have? It's just that I have found artist/[year] album/## songname.mp3 to be a very simple and effective way of organizing digital music. Anyway, just a suggestion, and looking forward to the next one!! Thanks again... "
,grubtrot,2009-11-15T21:09Z,you have given us life
,tr98101,2009-11-19T21:05Z,"I just registered here specifically to thank you for all of this stuff.  Amazing, and very, very good quality.  Don't skimp on the Zeuhl!  Thanks!"
,FaceFlap,2009-11-22T18:24Z,"Awesome stuff!! just came across your collection, i cant believe how many bands i've been missing out on / never heard of, ive been struggling to find any new prog stuff for at least a year now, you've just made me (and a couple of my friends) very happy people!!
cant wait for the next part :)
rest assured i will be seeding this for a very long time!!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-11-23T00:34Z,"Thanks so much everybody!  I'm really digging your comments and they make it worth doing all the encoding and tagging I've been doing!  I think there's some amazing music so far, the next one will be along soon so hang in there and I shall get it done.  Got some good stuff coming for F section next.  Just been working on putting a collection together these last few days for an awesome guitarist who I saw last month playing live in a local rock club.  I think he is very underated as a musician and that people should hear his guitar playing more!  Shall be uploading this guitar player shortly but part 7 of this collection is on its way, when I have time amongst work and stuff."
,wurzeline,2009-11-23T01:15Z,"@spandaubaby:Thanx so much for your wonderful work making this collection. reminds me of times I think I was too young to really understand the music the ""bid boys"" listened to. carry on.

@alltheothers: please seeeeed on and on and on, for I will...."
,gumball77,2009-12-02T02:34Z,"I've been seeding the last three parts for two weeks now...I think I've done my part. So- PLEASE, where is Part 7???  This has been such a great series of torrents, I'm DYING to see what you come up w/ next!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-06T00:35Z,"@gumball77: Yeah sorry about the wait, been extremely busy.  I have done most of F section part 7 now, I just need to finish it which includes the tagging etc..  Just sit tight and I will deliver it soon, we've had trouble just recently and as far as I know now Mininova is no more :-(  I was using this site and Mini to distribute the torrents as far as possible but I guess now they have removed all the torrents over there...  I can only have this one to host the torrents on, I was getting lots of leechers and seeders from Mini, this could well mean that after all my efforts so far, this torrents won't have it's full potential as a ""Popular"" torrent.  There's not much I can do really, I shall continue all the way to the end but if anything does actually happen to Pirate Bay then I will have wasted my time and might as well just go and headbutt a wall somewhere instead.

I need to find somewhere else to put these onto really otherwise a lot of people will miss out on all this music probably cos they don't know about these torrents.  I have lots and lots of really great bands coming up in the future, it is a big project to me and I can only do this alone, I don't have anybody to help me!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-06T00:47Z,"ahh hahaha lol sorry forget what I just said about Mininova, they have brought it back up under a different name now and called it Torrentzap.com

I need to sort my torrents out on there now, they seem to be there as they were on Mininova but Part 6 is missing so it needs putting up in my name :-)"

,Faergens,2009-12-08T23:05Z,"You can upload to Isohunt.com as well. It's one of the largest, and you might just spread this stuff around as much as you can. It's pure genius! "
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-09T05:33Z,"@Faergens:  Thanks, I shall have to see about getting them on iso hunt really, you have a point there!  I was just adding up the total now I have seeded for the first 6 torrents of this collection and right at this point now have reached just over 271 gigabytes of total upload size.

I'm obviously gonna seed these as much as possible, when I make a new part I also obviously seed that one on its own first and then when it is established that there are other seeders I go back to sharing them all again."
,subversivelemmings,2009-12-13T15:50Z,"I have the utmost respect n deep appreciation for all the time n eneries u are putting into this series.
Ive been immersed in such music both listening as well as creating n performing for over 34 years now n I am learning of incredable musicians I never knew of thru your efforts n loving it!!!! I love researching n sharing the wealth of interesting musical diversity w others n its wonderful to meet (well in a sense) another kindred spirit who does too. Thanks so much for the musics"
,subversivelemmings,2009-12-13T15:54Z,"Curious, if u have any Ensemble Nimbus n earlies 3 Ensemble Raye releases?"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-13T19:07Z,"@subversivelemmings:  Thanks for much for your valuable comment.  I am glad you are enjoying the music, I am trying to get the next part done now, it's just it takes time and as I lately I have been very busy with work.  I do apologise to anybody who is waiting for Part 7, please bear with me and I shall get it finished.  That band you mentioned they sound good but I'm sorry I don't have them otherwise I would have uploaded."

,vandergraaf100,2009-12-15T13:29Z,Thanks markc138 im on it!
,gearofwar,2009-12-16T00:37Z,All the best things in life require waiting for. It just makes it all the more rewarding!
,gumball77,2009-12-16T03:28Z,"Hey Spandau- Just know that I appreciate your efforts!  I don't know much about torrents, to be honest.  I'm still seeding the last two parts, but it takes up a lot of space on the hard drive and I wish I could do more but I can't.  Is there anything else I can do to help?  I don't mind seeding; I just wish I could do it better!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-16T19:00Z,"@gumball77:  It sounds to me mate like you have a problem with disk space.  I think really what a good idea would be is to buy an external hard drive.  Just get a USB 2.0 one and then you can fill it and have lots of room!  Thanks so much for seeding these, there's more to come yet!  I have seeded probably not far now from 300 gigabytes for these 6 in total and that's just the start!  I hope to try and distribute these bands all over piratebay because I think there is some seriously cool stuff to listen to.  I have a ton more shit yet but it's just gonna take time yet to get them converted into mp3.  Yeah so get an external and then you can put all kinds of files onto it and it will solve all your problems."
[V],bubanee,2010-01-07T02:21Z,just read your comment on me gaga... how you been buddy i see you got a bunch of loyal peeps waiting for your releases... hope all is well for you and yours in the new year.. i'll check out some of the songs... i can tell they'll be to full on for me... you take care and all the best for your uploading my friend.. bubs
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-08T21:26Z,"@bubanee: Thanks mate :-)  These seem to be doing really well now.  I keep putting them up every now and again.  I'm having some fun with them.  Some people really adore this kind of music, there's all sorts of jazz and fusion and stuff that's mixed into the music.  I was thinking at one point about maybe moving these to demonoid seeing as though they're back but I changed my mind, maybe it's best really to keep them here because not everybody can get onto demonoid because they all don't have accounts.  At least I have an old account on there, maybe it wouldn't be as popular.  Shame that Mininova changed like it did.  I hear now that TPB has moved it servers to Ukraine or something so they can't touch them."
,dagseoul,2010-01-28T11:33Z,"I'm at around 60% downloaded and the going is slow.  can some folks with more than me seed, i will return the favor.  i have tried to seed spandau's torrents 3:1.

thanks for the help."
