,irgoto,2009-11-13T16:49Z,No noctural you ass.. u need's a cd key.. and a acive steam account
,NocturnalDominion,2009-11-13T16:59Z,"There's no need to be so arrogant. I figured that if someone can figure out how to install this with no Steam or cd key, maybe there was a multiplayer workaround. Asshole."

,Spartan117nomad,2009-11-13T20:00Z,can sombody tell me how to get Spec ops mode of MW2 working please i will apreciate :)
,.dot,2009-11-13T21:05Z,"@Spartan117nomad: Start the game, choose Spec-Ops and play it. Idk what your problem is, works fine for me."
,cdx873v,2009-11-14T11:25Z,buy the game if you want multiplayer. it'll be worth it if you really like it
,ansfav,2009-11-14T12:13Z,"Guys, i just finished playing the campaign

...""SoCruel""...

my campaign ended in me(soap) throwing up a knife to the general, and we were evacuated by Nikolai...

then the credits rolled. and after is a group picture of 141, and below it is a link to ""special ops"", so i decided to rest for a while.

and when i relaunched the game, i saw the campaign saying i'm only 50 percent!

is that right?
or do i have to play the special ops first?
please help!

and one more thing, can this played thru local area network (LAN) multiplayer? because everytime i start from the shortcut of MP and thru the main menu it directly crashes, saying:

""Could not start process 'iw4sp_ceg.exe'
(null)(0x80041002)

Please answer intelligently. Thank You in advance!

,mythbuster420,2009-11-14T14:46Z,ok well this guy FTL3 ( for the loss 3 ? ) onjly has cracks uploaded.. I am thinking something fishy is up w/ these cracks.. has anyone tried the game without and then with this crack? whats the diff? it seems fishy all he has is cracks uploaded.. and not even a changelog? na i will pass
,Flagrama,2009-11-14T22:47Z,"@ansfav
50% for one playthrough is correct. I don't know how exactly the percentage works, but I think you need to collect all intel, and probably play through the other difficulties."
,scoper156,2009-11-15T04:24Z,This game works on my macbook pro ! yay!
,mythbuster420,2009-11-15T05:06Z,"After adding that crack update  the game wont even load now.. It says ""filesyscheck."" something wont load.. now i am having to reinstall the game.. DO NOT install that crack update "
,RiPlay0069,2009-11-15T13:09Z,"I download this cr*ck and the Skidrow original cr*ck. (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5156373/Call.Of.Duty.Modern.Warfare.2.PROPER.CRACK.only.-SKIDROW)

The size and hash of cr*cked files are exactly the same as original Skidrow cr*ck.

The uploader just delete SKIDROW.exe and add FAH.exe, version.txt and Instructions.txt

So I think it's not an update cr*ack but maybe it works."
,Zrules,2009-11-15T16:30Z,"I hate when people say ""if you want to play mp, buy the game"". This is where you get games for free and many mp worked in the past. People from the underground like tunngle/hamachi got many game mps to work so I don't know why we have to waste $60. It is a good game but you can get it for free dumbshits."
,xiIix,2009-11-15T22:02Z,"Hey mouth-breather, some of us like to support things we like, because we aren't cheap punks who think they're so cool because they can get shit for free.

Believe it or not, the scene existed before you kids got your dickbeaters on a keyboard. It was a way for us to be able to make sure we like things before we throw money at them. And throughout the past 15+ years, almost every nfo has ended the same. ""If you like it, BUY IT!""

If you want to be a scumbag, by all means, go right ahead. Those of us who have an I.Q. which exceeds that of a dimly lit light bulb; understand what it means to purchase the things we enjoy."

I recommend everyone here starts folding, just not under this jackasses name.

,FTL3,2009-11-15T23:44Z,"Please report it, you half-fucked pirate hypocrite. Besides, it folds under anonymous.

 xxbassplayerxx at 2009-11-14 03:54 CET:
Seeding now. Thanks for the up. I'm going to try to get this going on my gaming PC.

@Ginger, you can't play pirated games online unless you're playing on cracked servers and well... the multi in this game is so much bullshit that there are no servers.

Otherwise I would have purchased the game. This is just so I can play SP.

And a big FUCK YOU to Infinity Ward for fucking over the PC community. That's why they can't have my money. It's kinda funny because they were all sorts of concerned about pirating, then they go and fuck us over so no one wants to buy it any more so we all download it...

Thats bull, because there was a key generator for MW1, I think we`ll have to wait a few days for a key generator for MW2 :) Enter this key code in your Steam account and you can go online, I suppose"

Really? REALLY?? Wow, so this guy is trying to get other people to use FAH. What an asshole. He's trying to get other people, who may not use FAH to use the program to help fight/cure diseases. Yeah, report him right away. We need fewer people helping a good cause, and more people, like you, who choose really stupid battles to fight. Douche."
,mythbuster420,2009-11-20T01:05Z,"stfu dick.. If someone wanst to fold then good for them.. But someone DLing cracks then jsut repacking them and adding a gay ass FAH.exe is gayer than that blonde dude from Queer Eye.. I dont fold and never will so fucking come kill me you asshat.. Stanford has way more money than I do to pay there electric bill and way more PCs to fold on.. And TBH I am not even slightly convinced that folding does a damn thing to ""help find a cure for disease"".. If it did then they would have built super mainframe PCs to fold on themselves..

,fed250,2009-12-29T17:10Z,Does anyone know how to uninstall the FAH program?  you can't do it through the control panel and there is no uninstall option after you install the software.  I searched the registry for anything labeled FAH and even all the programs under that name and the only thing that comes up is the actual install software and instructions.  Nothing wrong with folding I just want the option to uninstall it if I want to.

from the store...
and the last...



it's SKIDROW version..

steam usually sucks... MW2 costs 29 dollars so in my country (Philippines), it's almost 1,300 Pesos..

so i usually the SKIDROW version for only 300 Pesos..


SAFE, EASY TO INSTALL, FAST



but the worse, contains 4 disc, take me 30 min to install... nah !!  ^_^"
