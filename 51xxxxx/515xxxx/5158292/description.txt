

Richard Pryor: Live in Concert was the first of Richard Pryor's filmed concert performances to be released theatrically. It was produced and distributed independently.

"Probably the greatest of all recorded-performance films. Pryor had characters and voices bursting out of him .... Watching this mysteriously original physical comedian you can't account for his gift and everything he does seems to be for the first time." Pauline Kael, from her review of "Richard Pryor Live in Concert". An audio version was released in 1978 titled Wanted: Live in Concert. The film and its copyright are owned by Gary Biller.

J.Mark Travis was the Producer of this Movie.
