,kingofthefire,2009-12-10T03:01Z,"Hmm..

I put in Itunes fine then when I try to sync it says that the file cannot be played on this Ipod.

Help???"
,cefca,2009-12-17T01:02Z,so this is a useless conversion since it doesn't work on any of our devices
,Endtrend,2009-12-21T03:07Z,"If you have this problem:

""I put in Itunes fine then when I try to sync it says that the file cannot be played on this Ipod.""

... then convert the file again (H.264, 640x480)  with software like AVS Video Converter (good torrent avail on PB). It worked for me!"
,makani42,2009-12-24T02:45Z,"This looks like you squeezed a widescreen image into full-screen. 640x480 is not iphone or psp sized either. This is a waste to download unless you want to see everything squished, which re-converting doesn't fix."
,xlsmarty,2010-01-01T00:55Z,"THIS MOVIE WON'T SYNC TO MY IPOD TOUCH!!!!
