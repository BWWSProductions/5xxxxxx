,bendlein,2009-11-08T12:06Z,"Love this series,thanks eztv your the best."
,expatriate,2009-11-08T13:24Z,"Aluc, I think you have to consider this series as being seperate from the books and just happening in a world that looks like the one we know from the books.

I agree that the plotline of the series cant hold a candle to the original, but if you look at it without comparing then its decent entertainment."

,libertaswv,2009-11-09T02:54Z,"The books are ridiculously derivative garbage used as a vehicle to peddle the hack author's far (and i mean FAR) right-wing ideology....but the TV series is great! First time i've ever been grateful that a TV series deviated wildly from it's source material.

The first season episode 'Cursed' is something of a mini-classic, imo.....Looking forward to more of the same - Thanks uploader! 

Very grateful to the EZTV crew....You really do set the standard."
