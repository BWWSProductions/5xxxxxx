Product Description (from Amazon)
The New York Times bestseller: the Nobel Prizeâ€“winning economist shows how todayâ€™s crisis parallels the Great Depressionâ€”and explains how to avoid catastrophe. With a new foreword for this paperback edition. In this major bestseller, Paul Krugman warns that, like diseases that have become resistant to antibiotics, the economic maladies that caused the Great Depression have made a comeback. He lays bare the 2008 financial crisisâ€”the greatest since the 1930sâ€”tracing it to the failure of regulation to keep pace with an out-of-control financial system. He also tells us how to contain the crisis and turn around a world economy sliding into a deep recession. Brilliantly crafted in Krugmanâ€™s trademark styleâ€”lucid, lively, and supremely informedâ€”this new edition of The Return of Depression Economics has become an instant classic. A hard-hitting new foreword takes the paperback edition right up to the present moment. .
