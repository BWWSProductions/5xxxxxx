After not seeding for a few days, I thought I'll upload something. Here's a PS2 game called Echo Night: Beyond. After making an image out of the disc, I burned it to see if the image was made properly. It isn't perfect (it makes some ticking noises), but apparently it is working.

This game is really creepy. I think it's pretty damn good. So if you like it, please seed it.
