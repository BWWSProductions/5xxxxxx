,loylachick,2009-11-08T21:06Z,YES! Thank you RangerXXX finally someone posted a legit copy =) Better late than never! VLC said it was still broken BUT it was able to play it all. Thanks again! 
,Traziz,2009-11-09T13:55Z,"You dont have to play on VLC, I fixed the index's and posted on a couple of NG's with an .nzb and on qemist.info.

It will play no problem on Media Player. But it should play on VLC, dont know why it said there was an error as like I said I fixed all the index issues."
