Finally you can have all your favorite Brad Neely animations on DVD. I went through the trouble of getting his cartoons from online to DVD so you don't have to. The DVD contains the following content by Brad Neely:

-Baby Cakes

-America, Now

-Professor Brothers

-Other Miscellaneous Videos

You will find all 52 uploads from TheRealBradNeely 's page. The DVD has a menu set up where you can easily navigate to each episode you want.


You will need some DVD burning software to make this DVD. I recommend Nero 7 to everyone.
