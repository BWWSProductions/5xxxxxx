Fawlty Towers is the best of comedy that thre is to be found - British!
It ranks with "Yes Prime Minister"in its popularity among many if not most
and is bloody great entertainment for which there can be no acceptable
substitute of resempling quality.

This entire collection of ALL Fawlty Towers episodes from the complete DVD
collection is in efficient DivX format to save downloading time and bother.
Great picture and sound, and you could even downlod yourselves a software
converter (if needed) for your video ipod, perhaps!

Pick and choose from the episodes on the torrent file, or go for all
at once, its all the same (you can simply activate one episode at a time
while going for the whole nine yards). speaking of which, we do have German
and French subtitles as a courtesy, however the humour is likely to be all
lost without some basic English literacy. Thanks for seeding to everyone
thats wanting to be intitiated or to enjoy this whenever they wish!! ta!!
