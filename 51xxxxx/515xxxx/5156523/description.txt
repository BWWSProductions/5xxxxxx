Well here we still are and with a new volume filled with great material. 
This one has put up a good fight to be born. Getting all the footage from the 0110 concert was not easy. 
Not easy at all. A lot of people had a bit of it but no one had the full thing. 
But we made it and here on Vol08 you can find the full broadcast of the dEUS gig on the 0110 event.
A BIG THANK YOU for ALL who made it possible. Remember that Via and What We Talk About were not broadcast and also Youth Against Fascism 
was not broacast in full.

This is the full tracklist for Vol08

01 - 1995 dEUS vs X-Legged Sally At Roxy
02 - 1997 MCM Buzz
03 - 2006 0110 Antwerpen
04 - 2008 Spraakmakers-Tom Barman-Nick Cave
05 - 2008-04-03 The Architect-LuxXL
06 - 2008-04-16 The Architect-dewerelddraaitdoor
07 - 2008-04-20 VPstudioconcert-Belgiannews
08 - 2008-04-21 VPstudio-rodeloper-21042008
09 - 2008-07-04 Les EurockÃƒÂ©ennes de Belfort 2008
10 - 2009-02-22 Humo's Pop Poll

I find this volume very interesting not only because of the 0110 but also the Nick Cave interview is a nice piece, 
the Roxy footage is GREAT! Great version of Via. The tv coverage is nice to watch a pitty i don't understand a word :-)
but the interviews should be nice. Les EurockÃƒÂ©ennes shows a cool band on stage and finishing with Humo's, even if it is only one song, 
it is a nice touch for a volume 09. What do you guys think? Footage of the summer shows should be on air soon. 
So, can i ask for someone to record it and deliever it or produce vol 09? 
Does anybody have more old material that is considered relevant to produce more volumes? 
It would be great if we could do 10 volumes of it. Who's up to it?
Meanwhile enjoy this one.

P.S. - I see and were also told that are people stuck dowloading previous volumes, specially vol04. Can somebody help? Please?
oh and there is no cover yet for this one but expect one soon.
Cheers
