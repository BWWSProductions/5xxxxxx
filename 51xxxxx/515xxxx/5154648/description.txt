From the post-apocalyptic battlegrounds of the 21st century comes 'Going Postal'. 
The first musical release from world famous children's author Psychosapien, Going
Postal is a harrowing account of the downfall of mankind.  Working it's way from the 
dawning of the last days of humanity, all the way through to the bitter wastelands 
that have become a home to the last few survivors of the apocalypse.  
With enough rad-free rations to last a lifetime, PsychoSapien will be beating 
the drums for a long time to come.
