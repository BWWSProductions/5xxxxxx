I had all of Harlequin's first 4 albums and was hoping someone would put them on here.

I'm hoping you have ""One False Move"" & ""Harlequin"" as well."
,Piotr65,2009-11-12T22:20Z,Cheers! Thanks very much for this one. Is it possible to up this one in flac? If not I'm still appreciative of this upload.
