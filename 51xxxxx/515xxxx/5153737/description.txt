hi, this is Jonny from plastered.

this is the first pre-release of what will be a full album (in May 20th) called "Everything, Bleeding Through"

If you would like to support me and this project, and help propel it deeper and quicker to the full release date, please pay for the pre-release here: http://plastered.bandcamp.com/

along with purchase will come some (hopefully) entertaining pieces of work.

thank you, and enjoy.

please give this away at any scale that you please. give it to your friends, your co-workers, your extended family, your family. (that is, if you like it that much).

peace out.
Jonny
