Spotmau PowerSuite 2009 is the ultimate Windows troubleshooting tool. It is a bootable CD that you can use to solve just about any problem you may experience with a Windows computer.

This indispensable suite of tools also allows you to carry out many other system maintenance and repair tasks such as cloning or backing up your hard drive, partitioning and formatting drives, encrypting or permanently erasing data you don't want others to find, recovering lost passwords, removing spyware popups and toolbars and optimizing your system. This is one tool no Windows PC user should be without!


Spotmau PowerSuite 2009 consists of two components. The first is a backup and recovery tool called WinCares which runs under Windows and plays a vital role in protecting your computer from disaster. You use it to back up your registry, partition table and device drivers so that they can restored in the event of a problem. It can also carry out other tasks such as restoring deleted files that can be done from within Windows itself. This makes Spotmau PowerSuite 2009 an essential utility even if your PC is working just fine at the moment.

The second component - and the most important reason for buying this product if your PC won't work - is a bootable recovery CD that runs by itself. You use this to restore the partition table and Windows registry from backups previously created by WinCares, and recover from several other common boot-up errors. As long as your computer can boot from CD - usually just a simple BIOS configuration change is all that's needed, if that - you can run this tool suite and solve the problem with a few clicks of the mouse.

If your system is so badly damaged that it can't be repaired, Spotmau PowerSuite 2009 includes tools that will let you copy your irreplaceable files to a safe location such as an external hard drive, so that you can reinstall Windows.
