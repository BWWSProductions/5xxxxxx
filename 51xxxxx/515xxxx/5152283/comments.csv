,hakke70,2010-01-11T09:06Z,"Spent 3 days downloading this. File must be somehow corrupted. Won't play with any of my computers, tried 5 different players capable of handling .iso files. Annoying to say the least."
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-03-16T09:07Z,why y dont include russian audio and greek subs?
,mam12006,2010-09-26T15:36Z,"For Those who can't play the iso file. If you ar runang Win XP you won't even open the iso file.

Search the web for iso 2.0 or 2.5 version and install the little file. Something magic wil happen. You'll be able to watch the movie."
,mam12006,2010-09-26T15:43Z,If you are running XP you'll need to search for iso 2.0 version

,TonyTheCat,2012-03-26T00:53Z,"Thanks , greatly appreciated . As long as I don't get to 80 or 90 percent of this done then it gets removed from the server or deleted . It's fairly shitty thing to do with a file this large . Also as long as BDjava is included I'll seed for a couple months after to help . "
