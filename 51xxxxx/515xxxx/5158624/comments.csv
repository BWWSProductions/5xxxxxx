,trapdog,2009-11-16T11:32Z,"Piratebay is blocked by you isp yet you write the comment on the web page???? well there are restrictions being made on users who's bandwidth use is excessive and are using specific protocls used by torrent programs, utorrent is coming with an updated release to help control the downloads.  As for waiting for tv shows like this on mininova, well simply go to eztv.it and get the torrents directly there, this is simply a republishing of the original"
