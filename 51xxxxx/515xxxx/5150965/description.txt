 Powershot Pinball's a collection of 8 games - from the classic 
 to the fantastic. Games range from the traditional Streets of 
 New York to the exotic scenes of Island in the Night. Two 
 dual-player games - Jungle Harmony and Pinball Ruins put an 
 imaginative spin on this classic pastime.  Players get hours of 
 bumper-bashing fun from the four traditional tables: Streets of 
 New York, Factory, Shipwreck, and Bay. The non-traditional games, 
 Island and Island in the Night, spin off the traditional pinball 
 approach not only with their exotic landscapes, but also by 
 awarding points for hitting palm trees and drums, for destroying 
 bugs, and for getting into tunnels and barrels. In addition, the 
 "tilt" feature of the traditional tables is replaced by a periodic 
 volcanic eruption.
