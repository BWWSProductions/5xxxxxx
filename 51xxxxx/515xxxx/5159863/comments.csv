,sribop,2009-11-13T01:37Z,Is coming up blank in CDisplay for anyone else?
,sribop,2009-11-13T01:43Z,"Argh! You have the image files inside a folder within the archive. The display app doesn't know how to deal with that.

Use a RAR utility like 7zip (Windows freeware) to extract the image files, create a new archive of those with the extension .cbr, and you'll have a functional file."
,Godgoth,2009-11-13T04:08Z,"Yep i confirm to make this work, open it with a rar program, take the files out of the folder move them into a new folder, then make a new .rar file with those files. Once they are compressed into rar
take that .rar file and rename the extension to .cbr
Like Walking Dead 67.rar into Walking Dead 67.cbr"
