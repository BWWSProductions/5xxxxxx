Acclaimed by critics as Jamie Cullum's strongest album to date, 'The Pursuit' finds the Essex-born crossover jazz pianist in eclectic mood. This follow-up to 2005's 'Catching Tales' was recorded at his home studio as well as in LA and features self-penned material alongside tracks written by Cole Porter amongst others.
