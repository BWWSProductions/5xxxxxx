,smegfest,2009-11-13T07:10Z,Sorry but what else is needed? It is a document containing 8 pages of proxies. What else do you need to know?..
,M1nt3a,2010-01-05T02:22Z,"I don't know if this is correct, but I think you have to specify the proxy type (ex SOCKS, etc.)

I downloaded this, and I don't think the proxy type is listed, unless every port number has a corresponding proxy type and I'm just a noob."
