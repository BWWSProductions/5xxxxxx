,RDaneel2,2009-11-20T01:20Z,"ACS:Law have entered the anti-piracy revenue generation scheme previously inhabited by Davenport Lyons. They write to alleged file-sharers demanding payment of hundreds of pounds or face legal action. However, those same individuals can point the finger straight back, since ACS:Law are copyright infringers themselves.

After I saw: ""...fine of £500.07..."", I knew I should either ROFLMFAO or ask where the 0.07 came from. "

I love John's first 3 albums... back when he had something to say and some interesting guitar riffs. This is the most bland, low-energy, cliché lyric, piece of crap ever. It's going to be a hit at dentist offices around the world."
,iKhaos,2009-11-23T03:38Z,"Great album, great quality."

,capnjack3,2012-03-30T22:53Z,"@BaronVonWatermelon


How the hell does a douche bag like you get anyone to listen to you?  

John mayers a legend bro.  Any legit musician would tell you that.  Go to hell you fricken failure"
,capnjack3,2012-03-30T22:56Z,"and by all accounts john mayer shreds better than SRV.  He's a bigger SRV fan than all a yall posers.  Graduated from berklee university bitches- one of the most well known music schools.  He's playin with pino paladino and steve jordan!  Any critic of john mayer is an ignorant douche who probably, unlike myself, has no musical experience other than die hard fanaticism for old artists they probably know nothing about"
