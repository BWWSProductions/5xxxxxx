The film starts at a Chicago airport. A group of soldiers (marines) have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the soldiers leave, one soldier remains and makes his way towards the exit. The soldiers name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth Pena) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesses return.

Edy then travels to his store, a small neighbourhood supermarket. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.

Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friends Johnny (Luis Gusman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of softball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Hector (Alexander Bautista), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Hector, and Hector stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Hector, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back the they make their way to Edys store.

Upon arrival at Edys store, Jesse gets a warm welcome from the staff and neighbours being something of a war hero to those around him. Edy, Jesse, Johhny and Ozzy head back home to celebrate Christmas. Jesse is given a warm welcome from his mother as others begin arriving.

Jesses sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress. Jesses Brother Mauricio (John Leguizamo) also arrives, along with his wife Sarah (Debra Messing). Sarah greets Anna and it is evident that she is not exactly comfortable around her in-laws but she is making an effort, even speaking a bit of Spanish. However, the topic drifts towards children and Anna makes it very clear that she wants grandchildren, but Sarah is a very business driven woman and isnt ready for kids, this causes some tension between Sarah, Anna, and Mauricio. After things settle down, everyone sits down and begins to catch up and each persons story is brought up: Jesse has just return from a three year tour in Iraq and is being prepared by Edy to take up the family business; Roxanna is waiting on news regarding a new TV deal; and Mauricio and Sarah are both in finances and making a great deal of money, but dont have time for much else. The conversation moves towards Jesses experience in Iraq, but its obvious that he does not want to talk about it (important later). Soon after, Marissa (Melonie Diaz), her son, and her boyfriend Fernando (Ramses Jimenez) arrive. Marissa is Roxannas best friend from childhood, and Jesses ex-girlfriend. It is evident that Jesse still has feelings for Marissa and vice versa, but there is much tension in the air.

After everyone has arrived, they all sit down for Christmas dinner. Everyone is digging into an abundant pile of food, chatting away, while Sarah sits there with a look of awe on her face as she has never experienced the holidays with Mauricios family. Edy is about to give a toast to everyone but gets a call, it seems that Edy has been getting a lot of calls, and often runs out when he does which gets Anna suspicious that he is having an affair, and cheating on her again (there was one previous incident in the past). Well, when the phone rings during Edys toast, he stops to answer the call, and having broken the last straw, Anna proclaims that she is divorcing Edy. At first eve"
