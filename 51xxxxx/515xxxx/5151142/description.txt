I got this in a trade a few years back.  It's a great comp DVD, quality varys but it is very watchable
overall.  All the info listed here came from the DVD menus, I have been a baby's fan for a long time 
but only a casual one so I don't know anymore info than what I got from the DVD menus.  If anyone 
has any insight into when the material was preformed can let us all know?  Thanks - Rock on!!!
