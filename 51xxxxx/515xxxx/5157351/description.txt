After Many Years...Flyleaf has Finally released a new album. Memento Mori is by far better then their first album by my opinion. Included in this Torrent is the actual 14 tracks and also all the extras from The pre-order exclusives and also the extra songs from Amazon, Walmart, and Rhapsody when you buy the album from those sites. This is not my first Torrent, but under this name it is. I lost my login info from my last name, but here is an awesome torrent for everyone!!!
