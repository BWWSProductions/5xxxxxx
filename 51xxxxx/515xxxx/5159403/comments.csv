Go sleep! you dont know anything!"
,monster.x,2009-11-17T00:42Z,"it seems the last 4 minutes of video are corrupted; since that's only the credits it's not a very big deal, but enthusiasts might skip this version for another one.
other than that i can only recommend this movie"
,latexink,2009-11-19T04:27Z,Thanks for the up
,graffinius,2009-11-19T17:13Z,I'm only getting audio from this dl.  No video. Any help?
,heretic576,2009-11-22T03:34Z,the file is 4.4GB. that means it won't fit on a single layer DVD. i hate when that happens.
,closetmonsterrr,2009-11-23T00:13Z,"SSSSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.................. =[

,Polygen,2009-11-25T22:09Z,"Downloading for 17 hours and average speed = 25kB/s  :(

,mixxxir,2009-12-24T02:05Z,Subs hard coded! Pass on this one!
,namtlade,2010-01-07T13:58Z,"Subs are NOT hard coded. You can turn them off. Looks perfect quality but haven't had the time to watch through yet. And yadam is wrong, this is 720p."
,mleezy,2010-01-29T00:50Z,"FYI at first i thought this was a dud--it wouldn't play on my mac. it would hang up forever when loading in VLC. quicktime x with perian had audio but no video. finally, i tried mplayer and it worked just fine."
,the_toasted,2010-03-02T18:04Z,"for those who complain about the big size (which is absolutely normal for a 720p film though)

,teroan,2010-05-19T21:07Z,"Quality is superb, except 20mb oversize for DVD5 (wtf?) and video will freeze in the credits about 2 minutes before the end.



Fix for those who wish fit this into DVD5 by removing the bugged end credits: Get MKVtoolnix 3.4.0 and run ""mkvmerge"". Add MKV and go to ""global"" tab and ""enable splitting"". Select ""...after this duration"" and set value to ""01:15:41"". Hit ""Start muxing"" and wait..."
