Rod Stewart - Never A Dull Moment

This is a 1998 Mercury remaster.
For some reason, when the log was compared to those collected by freedb,
none of the tracks could be confirmed as accurate.  However, the test CRCs and copy CRCs all matched when I ripped this.   This is probably a different pressing.


From Wickipedia:
Never A Dull Moment is a 1972 album by rock musician Rod Stewart. It became
a UK number-one album (for two weeks) and reached number two on the US Album
chart the same year. The track, "You Wear It Well", co-written by Stewart and
classical guitarist Martin Quittenton, was a smash hit (another UK No. 1; in
USA No. 13), as well as "Twistin' the Night Away", a song originally recorded
by Sam Cooke.  Other guest musicians included Ray Jackson of the band Lindisfarne
on mandolin, Spike Heatley on stand-up bass, Gordon Huntley on steel guitar, Dick
Powell on violin.  "Mama You Been on My Mind" is a cover version of a Bob Dylan 
song. Stewart's version is one of the songs featured in Nick Hornby's book 31 Songs.
