This a laymans attempt to visualize string theory. Having been thinking and imagining how a physical body could be created by multiple waves intersecting, tonight a made a little thingy in MS Paint.

I hope physisists as well as laymen will enjoy and shoot out new ideas based on this. The universe could be expressed in mathematics alone, but that would be boring and left-brained. Just as personalities are different, so is the multitude of possibilities to understanding the universe.

Mathematics excludes people, instead of bringing them together. Just like priesthoods in all forms.

Spread the word, spread the information, spread the data, share, share, share.
