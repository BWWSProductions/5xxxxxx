,Aftro,2009-11-10T14:43Z,try a re-installation 
,andrazf1,2009-11-10T16:35Z,i tried it about 5 times and no success:(
,urza4315,2009-11-11T04:58Z,"andrazf1: Play around with your video settings, try changing your screen resolution, turn antialiasing off, or changing the texture detail. It worked for me."
,Aftro,2009-11-11T19:01Z,"every time i try to start the game i get: ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix the problem""

i reinstalled it once but i still get the error, when i try to launch it from the launcher nothing happens also when the Nvidia PhysX driver tries to install i get: ""The currently installed version of the drivers is newer than what you are trying to install, aborting the installation"" but nothing may this cause the problem?"
,urza4315,2009-11-12T02:59Z,"Aftro: Try downloading and installing these.

,Mockfrog,2009-11-12T17:15Z,The opening movie (after you press new game) goes black for me as soon as the voice over starts talking. The audio remains though. I've installed the game twice but no change.
,Aftro,2009-11-12T19:25Z,"have you read the note?

Want to play :)
,Mockfrog,2009-11-12T22:09Z,"@aftro

Yes, I saw that. You don't have to place the files yourself, there's already a path for them if you just unpack it in the root directory. It hasn't helped me with my problem though."
,Aftro,2009-11-12T23:13Z,"@wingman92: There already is a Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 that comes with the game, try installing that.

,Arbitor9,2009-11-13T16:03Z,"I've installed the game, but cannot get past the launcher for DA. I click the play button but nothing happens. When I use the shortcut provided by tptb I get the ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix the problem""

I have installed the downloads suggested by others, although some of them did not work saying they were not compatible with my computer. any suggestions?"
,Japacino,2009-11-13T21:57Z,"Best as always Shroo, But i should say this game does Not deserve 9.5/10, LOL Believe me I suggest ""The witcher"" and ""The witcher 2"" to be released later... Enjoi this Fine Release!!! cheerz"
,0wesly0,2009-11-14T11:03Z,ok normally everything i dl from you works fine but i have fooled with this over and over and have done everything i could think of to get it to work followed everything said on here as well. tried all the little links to this and that but nothing works i cant get it past that dang config error
,lethalfizzel,2009-11-14T12:17Z,"the config error stems from the patch as som elements were made using newer visual c++. The fix that has worked for most people is downloading the more up to dat visual c++. But the most effective way is to get rid of the patch which i unfortunatley don't know how to do, seen as we don't have the original copy on cd"
,lethalfizzel,2009-11-14T12:19Z,one more thing the error IS NOT from the torrent its a novice mistake by bioware.
,lethalfizzel,2009-11-14T15:07Z,"after installing visual c++ several times, i've practically given up. stupid patch. i'm reading up on how to change the manifest files manually. if anyones got a fix please share"

,desidj,2009-11-17T08:22Z,Thank you shroo...guys it's working fine.All i needed to do to correct the side by side configuration error was to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) for which the link is given below by Aftro...and thank you Aftro as well for the help...

,freydalsp,2009-11-21T20:57Z,"just a couple of updates since my last comment:

1) the vitality 1.01b patch does seem to work- no problems so far. not sure about the dlc on the tptb website, but i'm guessing it should also work.
2) I downloaded the video files from 4shared, but I still had that 'missing character' issue. Someone on here said something about putting the directory into 'program files',  an that seemed to solve that problem."
,cousland,2009-11-24T22:10Z,"where am I supposed to put the folder to fix the no intro and no character in character creation error?

the path for dragon age is F:/dragon age

PLEASE someone tell me!"
,cousland,2009-11-24T23:47Z,"the file you guys put up is only 30MB...what the...?

maybe that's why only the first 7 seconds play in intro cutscene and there's no character in the creation screen...btw...there are no textures in that file...just intro movies...did you do something wrong?"
,Aftro,2009-11-25T18:42Z,"The 30MB file uploaded is the missing intro movie from the game which is causing the invisible character at the character creation screen.
Just extract the file where you installed the game
e.g X\Games\Dragon Age"
,cousland,2009-11-25T21:31Z,"I did that but it didn't fix anything!

intro movie is still missing and I can't see my character on creation"
,Aftro,2009-11-25T23:05Z,"Well try again or extract them and copy them manually in the required folder.
I didnt manage it the first time either"
,starblade312,2009-11-27T10:09Z,hi i am having a problem i have 1 of ur games installed and i try to play this game and it say that the side by side something is wrong and idk what im doing wrong
,McDowelstick,2009-11-27T16:31Z,"even if you managed to copy the video files from that 30mb download to the correct folder, the intro movie would still be missing. 

this is because a file called game_introduction.bik, which contains the intro movie, has been left out from this torrent and the extra download.

but on the plus side, you can still see your character in the creation if you skip the intro movie as soon as it starts to play. 

apart from the missing intro, this ripped version of the game works and plays fine. so i guess we should be happy with that."

i'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but the uploaded file would be a lot bigger than 30mb if the intro video was included in it. and apart from the missing intro this rip seems to work and play fine.

Else than this little issue, this game works fine. Too bad it got so little seeders, took 21 hours to download it.

Keep up the good work ;) ."
,vyperxii,2009-12-13T16:52Z,"thx tptb for the great works as always :)

but i am still having problems with the intro and char creation parts after the package :P

i have found this:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5159796/Dragon_age_Origins_Character_Creator

which seems to have the missing video and a working char creator which you then import into the game proper  ( coincidence?!) think has to be installed in the C drive though.

i have used it and works fine, but if anyone can integrate it into the retail would be great! probablly just need to know what files to copy across... am no good at stuff like that though :)

anyway, was just a heads up on the problem, and a possible sol'n 

cheers again :)"
