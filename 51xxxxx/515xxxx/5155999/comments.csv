,awudu,2009-11-12T14:55Z,"hey man, I just tried to install again and copied the file in the cracked folder to the installation directory and now it's registered.

The first one I did. I extracted the files from the rar but for this one that worked. I opened the rar, runned the setup from there, and copied the file from the crack folder to the installation folder and it worked..
Thanks. This is better than Nidro PDF which you can only convert document from Word to PDF or from PDF to Word."
,awudu,2009-11-12T14:57Z,"I think there's a new version.. V4.05..
When you go to Help, check for updates. You get this...


""A newer version (4.05) is available for download from
http://dl.filekicker.com/send/file/227390-O8JL/InfixSetup.exe

Please close InfixPro before attempting to install the upgrade. ""


Do you think the cracked file will work with the new version?"
