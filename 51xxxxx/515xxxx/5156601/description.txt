  ??? Law enforcement agencies around the world face a common challenge  ???
  ??? in their fight against cybercrime, child pornography, online fraud ???
  ??? and other computer-facilitated crimes: They must capture important ???
  ??? evidence on a computer at the scene of an investigation before it  ???
  ??? is powered down and removed for later analysis. "Live" evidence,   ???
  ??? such as active system processes and network data, is volatile and  ???
  ??? may be lost in the process of turning off a computer. How does an  ???
  ??? officer on the scene effectively do this if he or she is not a     ???
  ??? trained computer forensics expert?                                 ???
  ???                                                                    ???
  ??? To help solve this problem, Microsoft has created Computer Online  ???
  ??? Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE), designed exclusively for use  ???
  ??? by law enforcement agencies. COFEE brings together a number of     ???
  ??? common digital forensics capabilities into a fast, easy-to-use,    ???
  ??? automated tool for first responders. And COFEE is being provided   ???
  ??? at no charge to law enforcement around the world.                  ???
  ???                                                                    ???
  ??? With COFEE, law enforcement agencies without on-the-scene computer ???
  ??? forensics capabilities can now more easily, reliably, and          ???
  ??? cost-effectively collect volatile live evidence. An officer with   ???
  ??? even minimal computer experience can be tutored in less than 10    ???
  ??? minutes to use a pre-configured COFEE device. This enables the     ???
  ??? officer to take advantage of the same common digital forensics     ???
  ??? tools used by experts to gather important volatile evidence,       ???
  ??? while doing little more than simply inserting a USB device into    ???
  ??? the computer.                                                      ???
