Like when the squirrel grabs an acorn and just as it happens the song Money goes ""Money, It's a gas.  Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.""  Also the other version stopped around the 45 minute mark with the climatic ending of the last song synced perfectly with the impala jumping into the water to save itself from the ever hungry hyenas.  Not sure how the original was done (with a record or cd) but thanks anyways."
