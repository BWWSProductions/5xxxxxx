Travel Channel Julian&Camilla's World Odyssey
http://www.travelchannel.co.uk/J%2BC/

A documentary travel series presented by Julian Hanton and Camilla Andersen. It unravels unscripted travel plans and all the bizarre encounters made along the way, such as masked Mexican wrestlers, Thai transsexuals, Indian gurus, Jamaican conmen and Peruvian Alien Worshippers. 
Cheapskate traveller Julian and his laid-back companion Camilla explore the more bizarre aspects of our world, as well as capturing the feel of the traveller network. Interviewing other travellers and getting to the bottom of each countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sub-culture.

The series switches between the fun and lighthearted moments travellers treasure; and the insights and experiences that lie beneath a country's facade, which travellers remember
