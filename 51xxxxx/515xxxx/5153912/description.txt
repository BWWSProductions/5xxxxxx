This is "The Beatles-Complete Christmas Collection 1963-1969 Plus Bonus Outtakes" by the Beatles.  This is one of the better bootlegs out there since the Christmas recordings really aren't on any official Beatles releases.  These are all of them in one place and in decent sound quality.  1992 Yellow Dog Records, YD 031.
