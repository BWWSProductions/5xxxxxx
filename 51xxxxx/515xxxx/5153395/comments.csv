,betoman,2009-11-17T01:30Z,"Peers......Feel free to leave any comments about the video. Please keep on seeding, even if it's for a while."
,betoman,2009-11-24T18:09Z,I will be deleting this torrent by the end of this year. I dont see why I should share when no one else does. Good luck to whoever completes it.

,S1nthet1c,2010-04-20T23:57Z,"All right... At this point, I haven't even finished DOWNLOADING this file, and I've got an UPLOAD ratio of 1.655! I've managed to upload 13.6 Gb of an 8.65 Gb file.

Some more seeders would be nice; I've been working on this file for over a week, now."
