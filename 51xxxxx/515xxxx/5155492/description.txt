Here are 94 pages from the BBC Series Planet Earth coloring book titled "Wildlife Wonders." The names of the animals and habitats pictured are displayed in the file names for easy access. Images were scanned at 150 dpi and saved in .gif form. They can be reprinted without quality loss at 8.5" x 11". Good for teachers who are doing animal-themed units or for parents on a rainy day. Note: Unlike in the "Cool Creatures" and "Awesome Animals" coloring books, a number of the animals in this version were drawn so large that they spanned both coloring-book pages. They were scanned as separate images.
