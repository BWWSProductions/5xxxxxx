Ana Vidovic presents a varied programme & plays it all with energy & authority. The opening Bach prelude is as fast as you'll hear on guitar, while the rest of the suite is played with distinct flair. 

Special mention should be given to the pieces composed by Sulek & played with deep feeling & fine phrasing. Moreover, Ana Vidovic's playing of the Walton Bagtelles is a revelation & should establish her in the guitar world. 

Her guitar tone is appealing, neither overly bright nor too bass laden. The recording is high quality. A must for all classical guitar fans.


Enjoy and Seed!!
