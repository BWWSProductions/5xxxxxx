,tommcd,2010-03-14T14:33Z,Thanks a lot for this. This young woman is an amazing guitarist!! Highly recommended for any classical guitar fan. I think I will purchase a copy from naxosdirect.com. Or perhaps her new album of Torroba's music from Naxos. She deserves the royalties.

,tommcd,2011-04-29T08:11Z,"After downloading and listening to this, I have purchased both of Ana Vidovic's CDs on the Naxos label (this one and her recording of Torroba's music).  They are both excellent and highly recommended. They are also very inexpensive and worth every penny!"

Thx :-)"
