,tgcleader,2009-11-16T00:53Z,"I got a question, I downloaded a Microsoft Office 2007 that said ''Microsoft Office 2007 Prof Full English ISO'' which was 3GB and it included all the Microsoft Office version. So I wanted the Professional one so I installed Professional Plus and entered a key for it and itr gave me a green check mark and after I installed it I copied MSO.DLL to the location you stated but it never asked me to replace MSO.DLL cause it was never there. Also when I open up any Office program it never brings up an activator and just lets me use Office normal. So I tried to find a help tab and the only one I found was on Microsoft Office Publisher so I cliocked it and clicked Activate Product it said my product was already activated. So des this mean that I dont have to worry about activating my Microsoft Office 2007 Professional Plus? Or is this an older version and has not been updated with SP2 and eventually will say my product isnt activated or my  copy is a pirated copy or what cause I dont know if SP2 asks you to activate it or not cause I have never used an office with SP2. Please let me know thanks."
,somina.ar,2009-11-24T21:15Z,Thnx! Works Great :D
,Raventhorn,2009-11-25T22:45Z,"lol
@tgcleader
if a product already says its activated, dont worry about activation.
apparently your downloaded version already 'cracked' itself or was pre-activated (just like some downloaded/preinstalled windows versions)

If i were you, i'd seed that iso, have fun and die old."

What i did was after downloading the program.
I opened the file where i downloaded this file. right click on the MSO.DLL file. and selected COPY.

From here, I opened MY COMPUTER. Opened PROGRAM FILES. Opened COMMON FILES. Opened MICROSOFT SHARED. Opened OFFICE12. Then right click, and selected PASTE. It will ask you if you want to COPY AND REPLACE; DONT COPY; or COPY, BUT KEEP BOTH FILES. Select the bottom one  BUT KEEP BOTH FILES. It will rename the file as MSO (2).DLL. Right click on the original MSO.DDL and then go back one file, so your into MICROSOFT SHARED File. and right click, select PASTE. Now, go back into OFFICE12, and rename the MSO file to MSO.DLL. Reboot your computer. once up and running, select Outlook2007. To check if it is working, Select Help, then Activate, it will, or should say it is already active.

,ptcruiser70663,2011-05-28T07:49Z,Someone PLEASE tell me where I can find the mso.dll file!~!!!!
,kikman1968,2011-06-08T18:45Z,Ok i am not a noob or something and i have searched any location i could possibly imagine just to find this deam mso.dll file. Please guys take the time and tell us where in the world is that file? Is not in the iso and its not in my hard drives after the installation. I just dont know.
,jrock84,2011-08-17T19:24Z,"@ ptcruiser and kikman: 
 I'm pretty sure you don't need to locate the actual mso.dll file in your computer, just copy the MSO.DLL file you downloaded from here and paste it into this folder:  C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\OFFICE12. It should give you three options: 
1. Copy and Replace 
2. don't copy
3. copy, but keep both files. 
Click option number 1 (Copy and Replace) and thats all."
,gera.castillon.97,2011-08-27T01:55Z,"hey! please help!!

I have done the part of pasting MSO.DLL on OFFICE12, and I replace it but when it is coping it, appears something that says that the action can´t be completed because another program opened a folder or one of its files
Then it says:Close the folder or the file and try again. 
and appears the name OFFICE12

I dont know what to do! please help"

,tarumba,2012-05-25T06:33Z,"Hi! it didn't ask me to replace any files. none of the files in office 12 had that name. They had similar ones, though."
,tarumba,2012-05-25T06:43Z,"I completely understand if you don't have time to help me with this, but here goes...

I am trying to install project 2007. When I tried to install it over the phone, it told me I had to exchange the product, so i installed this activator. That .dll file, however, does not match any of the files I've got in the location you indicate. I have MSOXEV.dll, msoshext.dll and MSOXMLMF.dll, which should I replace?"
,Leejhooker,2012-06-19T10:51Z,"Forgive my ignorance but how do I ""turn off the internet""? Is that something I'm authorised to do and do I need some sort of password for that? I have friends playing WoW and will not be happy if their internet goes down, u get me?!"
