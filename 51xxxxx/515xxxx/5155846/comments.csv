,ilaalhok,2010-05-04T22:53Z,serial is dead...
,MDeity,2010-05-08T04:46Z,"Serial is NOT dead.
You must install both 7.0.1 and 7.0.1a updates.
As with any program downloaded this way (torrent), you should not register the product.

When the program asks you to register the software select the third option ""Don't display this again"" and click ""Continue"".

Good upload props to gerti_id."
,Oregone,2010-07-19T18:20Z,"This is not working. 

There are duplicate files in this torrent, exact duplicates. 

When you do setup the very first thing it asks is your name and serial number and the included serial number is not accepted. You get no opportunity to install the first file nor can you install either of the two updates the OP mentioned.   

The OP should look into this torrent and re-upload it, this one cannot be used. "
,TitioFoda,2010-09-02T14:01Z,"Yes the serial works and there is no duplicated files.

You only need to select ""install as individual""  (not business) and it will work.

I've installed the program and all updates."
