Assemblage 23's seventh album is another hit album and is considered Tom's best album ever. Introducing new elements such as electro-house and post-punk, and many other surprises including A23's first guitar riffs [Impermanence]. 

Review:

"Compass is the uncompromising presentation of Tom Shear's biggest strength, the composition of dreamingly beautiful ballads, relentlessly catchy tunes and club hits that will draw all the party animals to the dance floor. He is a real master of his trade, and on this newest work, he has achieved the feat of sticking to the sound all Assemblage 23 fans love and hope for, while still creating a powerful and exciting new vibe. Listening to this album and discovering 'Compass' in its whole glory is pure fun; it fascinates and electrifies. All this combined makes sure that 'Compass' is not just a treat for Shear's big fan base but will also excite all those who have not yet discovered the fascination of Assemblage 23. The single 'Spark' has already proven a strong and promising harbinger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but who would have thought that Tom Shear might surpass this benchmark in such a glorious way. For all those who love straightforward but also sophisticated and substantial electronic music, this album is not to be missed! The very limited deluxe edition comes complete with a bonus CD, including 3 new tracks, and two remixes."
