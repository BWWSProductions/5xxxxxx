Anyone who saw Strictly Come Dancing last Saturday will know that the magic of the Bee Gees burns as brightly as ever.

Their TV appearance was a huge success and to celebrate their return, the Bee Gees have created a unique album of some of their greatest hits â€“ and itâ€™s absolutely FREE inside today's Mail on Sunday.

The chemistry between Barry Gibb and his younger brother Robin and the rapturous applause from the audience threatened to eclipse the performances by the competing couples on the BBC1 programme.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday shortly before their appearance, Robin said: â€˜This will be the first time weâ€™ve done national television as a band for eight years.

'But Iâ€™m not nervous because Iâ€™ll be with Barry. Iâ€™m always comfortable working with him. It feels natural. It will be a magical moment and it will feel like Iâ€™m back in the saddle. Hopefully Barry will feel the same way.

â€˜Strictly has taken on a life of its own in this country, and rightly so. Iâ€™m not an expert on the dancing, but I am a fan and I hope everyone enjoys watching us as well.â€™

Their comeback was, however, tinged with sadness, because it was the first time they had performed without their brother Maurice.

He was Robinâ€™s twin and died in 2003, aged just 53, from complications following an operation to correct an intestinal blockage.

The surviving brothers were so grief-stricken that the Bee Gees temporarily disbanded. It has taken them until now to process both their personal pain and the effect it has had on their professional endeavours.

â€˜Losing Maurice was an emotional tragedy for both of us,â€™ Robin added before the Strictly performance. â€˜It was so sudden, and he hadnâ€™t been ill beforehand. He was too young to die.

'It was awfully sad for us and itâ€™s still hard to believe. Barry and I had our different ways of dealing with it. Barry couldnâ€™t face being a Bee Gee or making music. I respected that. It took a few years for us to break through that emotion.

â€˜Thereâ€™s not a day that goes by that we donâ€™t think of Maurice. Itâ€™s still sometimes hard to believe it has happened but it has brought Barry and me closer as brothers.

â€˜We realised we had to enjoy what we had, and the good news is weâ€™re through the emotional breakwater now.â€™

So much so that last month, Barry, 63, and Robin, 59, announced that they were reuniting to honour Mauriceâ€™s memory and mark 50 years of making music together.

During that time they have sold more than 200million records and become prolific songwriters for some of the industryâ€™s greatest artists â€“ including Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand.
