,PoliteMan,2009-11-13T09:10Z,"Cheers catsout,a great upload,top quality.
You know,some people!! All new torrents take time to establish themselves and it is always made harder by the ammount of leechers before the seeds build up.
A little patience is all that is needed and at the end of the day it's free.
As for Housezz,he's a prat.
Thanks again for the quality torrent"
