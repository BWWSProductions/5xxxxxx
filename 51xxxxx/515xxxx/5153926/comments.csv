,LukeScooto,2011-07-10T00:08Z,"I honestly dont know. I use whatever the default settings are for Handbrake or my other backup copying program called 123 COPY DVD 09 Gold. It works ok. Between the two I can copy almost everything.  And i use DVD43 for the copyright protection. Simple stuff but it works great for my dvd rips. My only complaint is that Handbrake takes alot longer lately to rip, especially for an Ipad right as opposed to a Ipod Touch rip. Any tips would be appreciated."
