  From Recorded Books:

  Novelist and lawyer Sheldon Siegel exposes the ruthless world of law 
practice in this electrifying courtroom drama. Crackling with energy and 
suspense, Special Circumstances places you in the center of an explosive 
murder trial where politics and greed clash with truth and justice. 

  Fired by Simpson & Gates, one of San Francisco's most prestigious law 
firms, lawyer Mike Dailey quietly opens his own practice on the wrong side of 
town. He takes on his first client when police arrest his best friend, a 
partner at Simpson & Gates, for a brutal double murder. As Mike frantically 
digs for evidence, he discovers the firm has a lot to hide-and his friend 
conceals a dirty secret, too. In this brilliantly paced, sharp-witted 
thriller, Sheldon Siegel reveals both the pitfalls and safeguards in our 
criminal justice system. 
  Frank Muller's dramatic pacing keeps you on the edge of your chair from 
the intriguing first chapter to the stunning conclusion.
