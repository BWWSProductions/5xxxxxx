> The INFERNAL AFFAIRS trilogy has been heralded as some of the best cinema to ever come out > of Hong Kong. Going deep inside the world of the HK police and triad societies, the lines  > are often blurred between right and wrong. Featuring excellent performances from some of  > Hong Kong's best actors; it is easy to see why Martin Scorsese has chosen to remake this  > series with his upcoming film THE DEPARTED. This is crime cinema at its best.
