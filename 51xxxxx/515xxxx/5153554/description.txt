Following the rise of Oliver Cromwell (Richard Harris) to power as Lord Protector and in the process the bringing of King Charles I (Alec Guinness) to trial and execution. Thus Cromwell laid the seeds for the more democratic Great Britain of today. If ever there was a man ahead of his time, Cromwell was that man!

This amazing story is told in an epic and lavish style in director Ken Hughes' CROMWELL with world class performances from Richard Harris and Alec Guinness as the noble, but doomed, Charles I.



Enjoy and Seed!!
