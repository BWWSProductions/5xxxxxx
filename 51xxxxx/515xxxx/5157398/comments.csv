,Estlin,2009-11-12T16:29Z,"OMG, Platinum Blonde! I remember this great album and Mark's pseudo-British accent. Last I heard, he was a roving DJ at several clubs in Toronto.

Thanks for the memories! (Also, did you manage to dig up the 4th Floor EP?)

[V],80zforever,2009-11-12T17:55Z,"erikphnx, you're one damn loyal follower!

Estlin, yes indeed that's a great record. I wish bands today would still make music like that but....  and no luck with 4th Floor so far. I must be buried somewhere. we wil see."
,rockaway99,2009-11-12T18:12Z,"Thanks alot 80zforever!

I remember seeing Platinum Blonde about two weeks after this album first came out - they were opening for Bryan Adams. 

There are many albums by somewhat obscure Canadian bands that I would like to suggest for you to post. Is there a way I can send you a list?

Thanks again."
[V],80zforever,2009-11-12T22:18Z,rockaway99 why don't you just put the names here in the comments? Also check my older torrents as I have posted lots of obscure Canadian bands here. cheers
,rockaway99,2009-11-12T22:29Z,"Did you notice I used the word ""many""? I have quite a few on my wish list, so, I'll start with 5 - 

Gary O - Strange Behavior
Sharp Edges - Slice of Life
Union - On Strike
Urgent - Timing
Prototype - Prototype (the guys who did ""Video Kids"")

Hopefully you have some of these.
Thanks"
,rtrifunov,2009-11-13T11:25Z,"80zforever, the music you posted inspired me in an incredible way, you gave me a wholy new perspective of the 80s music, which has the deepest sensibility of all times.
Please, if you can and when you can, post these fabulous albums
Latin Quarter - Mick and Caroline (1987)
Latin Quarter - Swimming Against the Stream (1989)
Gary Wright - Who I Am (1988)
I know that these are not that rare, but I can find them, and can't order them, 'cos pay-pal system doesn't work in my country.
Thanks in advance, thank you for the music."

[V],80zforever,2009-11-15T05:39Z,"mikeyten, that;s very nice of you! cheers"
,mdsqdfvr,2009-11-16T06:57Z,"80zforever, I didn't think I'd be signing up for a pirate bay account this late in the game, but it is your actions that have swayed me.  I cannot overstate my gratitude for the great music that you have provided, and was wondering something:  Its a long shot, but is there anything that you would like to see in your collection?  My 80s music archives are no where near as extensive, but I wanted to offer something.  Again, many thanks..."
[V],80zforever,2009-11-17T06:35Z,"mdsqdfvr, thank you so much for your comment. it's very encouraging to see people noticed the reason behind my massive posts; i.e. to re-introduce bands either totally forgotten or obscure. And thanks for your offer, for now there's no record on my wish list or that I don't remember it, but anyhow thanks for your kind offer. Cheers"
,projesman,2009-12-22T15:07Z,Thanks for the Platinum Blonde 80z....awesome stuff!!  Keep up the great work.
