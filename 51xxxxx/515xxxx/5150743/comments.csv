So i try to load it up and it says the file cannot be located. So then i explored the so called location of the files and the folder in the program files is empty. Nothing has been installed at all. I have retried to install like 5 times and same thing keeps happening. Can i get some help Please??

On a side note the autoplay will not come up in the 64-bit because it says there is an error in the XML files, so i have to start from the setup option within the disk file to install. However, there is no error in the XML files on the 32-bit laptop."

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5204883/%5BFTL3%5D_DRAGON_AGE_1.02_PATCH___CRACK_WORKING

Balance

    * Daggers now apply 0.5 points of damage per additional point in dexterity and 0.5 points of damage per additional point in strength, as originally intended. This increases dagger damage for high-dexterity characters.
    * During combat, mana or stamina reserves now correctly regenerate more quickly when reserves are low. This allows players to occasionally use an talent or spell in the later stages of lengthy fights.
    * When exploring, mana and stamina now regenerate more quickly at higher character levels. This reduces downtime between fights.
    * The spells Force Field, Crushing Prison, Cone of Cold, and Blizzard now have shorter durations and/or longer cooldowns. This ensures that combatants can no longer stun-lock each other by repeatedly casting the same spell.
    * The cooldowns for several low-level sustained abilities are now shorter. This ensures that players are not penalized for accidentally deactivating them.
    * Certain battles were not scaling properly, resulting in excessively difficult fights. They now scale as intended.
    * Enemy corpses now drop health poultices and money more appropriately, resulting in less clutter in the player's inventory. 

Gameplay

    * In rare cases, enemy corpses were selectable when they contained no loot. This no longer occurs.
    * Party members whose combat tactics were set to defensive behavior no longer stop attacking after using a spell or talent.
    * In rare cases, combat tactics conditions could fail to determine whether a character had enough mana or stamina to use an ability. This no longer occurs.
    * The Rally talent no longer repeats its audio effect if it is active during certain conversations.
    * The Rally talent no longer deactivates upon area transitions or conversations.
    * The Shimmering Shield spell now deactivates when the character is out of mana. 

Plot *Spoiler Warning*

    * Promotional downloadable content items now remain in the player's inventory when standard items are removed at the end of the dwarf noble origin.
    * Repeatedly talking to Duncan after gathering the vials in the Korcari Wilds but not the treaties no longer provides duplicate experience.
    * Leliana's personal plot can now be completed if the player substantially increased her approval (through gifts) before talking to her.
    * During the siege of Redcliffe, enemies are no longer able to spawn in locations that would break the plot.
    * Bann Teagan no longer disappears when he is supposed to be accessible during Urn of Sacred Ashes. 

PC Specific

    * Controlling a summoned creature (like a ranger's pets) during certain special area transitions no longer results in odd behavior.
    * Creating a character in a custom module did not create a folder for saves. This could result in corruption of main campaign saves. This no longer occurs.
    * In some cases, the class icon was set incorrectly for characters imported from the downloadable Character Creator. This no longer occurs.
    * The options menu now includes a setting to automatically download previously purchased content that is not currently installed.
    * After installing new downloadable content, the game now always reminds the user to restart the game.
    * The icons for some promotional downloadable content items were missing. They now appear correctly.
    * The screenshot upload GUI would stop working from time to time on the client. There was a memory override that was fixed. It is a client fix. It doesn't affect the other problems we have seen on the server. 		"

Boot Camp doesn't handle transferring large files such as this iso correctly from an NTFS drive, and some data was corrupted. Either install MacFuse/NTFS3g on the Mac side and transfer the iso from there to the Win partition, or install Macdrive or something similar on the Windows side to transfer the iso from the NTFS partition.

1. Download torrent.
2. Open up the folder and you see a ton of .rar files. Extract the first one.
3. Download Daemon tools trial (just google it).
4. Open Daemon tools.
5. Click Add Images (top left corner) and find the .iso, where you extracted the .rar file.
6. Follow Instructions - use one of the serials from the ReadMe that was downloaded.
7. After installing, if you can't find it, use the My Computer Search function and locate the Skidrow folder.

It can run too fast on dual-processor systems, making everyone bounce around hyperactively. Can be fixed by pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL, going to ""processes"", right-clicking on daorigins.exe (which is probably eating 100% of the CPU), selecting ""Affinity"", then making sure that only one CPU is selected (e.g. CPU0). You have to do this each time you run the game (including after crashes). "

In order for us to get great games like these, we have to support the developers who make em.

Law of commerce:  If there's no profit, shit closes down.  

Also, though games are cheaper to make than movies, games take many hours of highly talented graphics artists.  You see new actors every day, but great game developers take time.  Hence by the # of terrible games out there."

,xXLuneXx,2011-02-05T21:10Z,"This is one AMAZING Torrent, here is why:

-Really easy to work your way through the download and installation process.
-Game works 100%, no viruses.
-Online network with EA is enabled, so it's like you actually have the full game except for the actual case and disc. 

-If you want all DLC's for the game download this torrent here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5865764/Dragon_Age__Origins_-_Complete_DLC_Pack_%5B20_September_2010%5D

If any of you need help here is a clarification:

-First get uTorrent, Winrar, and Deamon Tools Lite.
-Download Dragon Age Origins here by using uTorrent, and if you want, download the DLC's also.
-Once done open the containing folder from the download on uTorrent of Dragon Age. 
-Open all the files in there that are Winrar Archives with Winrar (Drag a box and open ALL of them with Winrar).
-Extract all of them to your desired folder (Drag a box and extract all of them). 
-Now open up Deamon Tools Lite and click ""Add File"" browse for the Dragon Age Origins that you've just extracted using Winrar.
-Now you should have the Dragon Age Origins image mounted on to one of your C-Drives. 
-Play the virtual CD of Dragon Age Origins from your C-Drive or from Deamon Tools.
-Launcher should pop-up, then install Dragon Age.
-When done installation, re-open the Dragon Age Origins file that you extracted all together into your desired folder with Winrar, and find the file SKIDROW, extract that, take the contents inside of it and copy, paste, and OVERWRITE into your Dragon Age, Bin_Ship folder found in your Program Files(x86).
-Launch the game, and play.

Thanks again for the amazing torrent! "

and i followed each step that xXLuneXx gave too, which was a good help.

any quick responses?"
,zysronnorsyz,2011-06-27T22:40Z,"@vauveli 
he didnt double tap he typed two different comments
@gaiam
did you unmount the disk on accident?
other than that does your pc meet the requirements?
and lastly if those conditions are passed and it says your ""missing #####.dll"" or some other file try googling it and finding a download you'd be amaized at how many people come up with the same problem. but make sure you scan everything from everywhere if you dont trust them or if less than 50 people say their great or if more than 10 people say its got one... lol
but yeah recap sytem requirements 
mounted 
file missing
otherwise... after those things... well you might have effed up or (as once happend to me) the file wasnt compleated like it said it was
one time i started loading it as soon as it said it was done stoped the download and everything
couldnt figure out for the life of me why it didnt work... kept trying and trying and trying and nothing then i was like eff it maybe i missed something opened up the downloader found the link and a couple of seconds later i got a system message saying it was done tried it again after looking for an answer and it worked just fine..."
,Alferow,2011-06-29T18:31Z,"Downloading now, Will update how it goes, Hopefully will get it working like normal :).
