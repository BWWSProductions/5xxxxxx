Dragon Age Origins-SKIDROW 

From the Makers of Mass Effect, Star WarsÂ®: Knights of the Old Republic, and 
Baldurs Gate comes an epic tale of violence, lust, and betrayal.

The survival of humanity rests in the hands of those chosen by fate. You are a Grey 
Warden, one of the last of an ancient order of guardians who have defended the 
lands throughout the centuries. 
Betrayed by a trusted general in a critical battle, you 
must hunt down the traitor and bring him to justice.

As you fight your way towards the final confrontation with an evil nemesis,
you will face monstrous foes and engage in epic quests to unite the disparate peoples of a world at war.

A romance with a seductive shapeshifter may hold the key to victory, 
or she may be a dangerous diversion from the heart of your mission. 
To be a leader, you must make ruthless decisions and be willing to sacrifice your friends and loved ones for the 
greater good of mankind.
