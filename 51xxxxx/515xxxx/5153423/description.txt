this is a great album, the real album is the first 14 tracks and the rest are just kinda a collection of unreleased, unheard or off older mixtapes that he had out. If you dont think Wale can rap listen to track #35 its over 10 minutes long and he uses like 10 different beats (jackin 4 beats) but he rips all that shit
