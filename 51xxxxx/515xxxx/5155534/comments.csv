http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/s6_e07.htm

However, ""Known Unknowns"" is Season 6 Episode 7.

An easy and honest mistake, as the first episode of the season was a 2 parter (i.e. the first episode of season 6 includes 601 & 602, as they premiered on the same night).

As a preemptive strike against those that would disagree and especially those that would insult me for my accuracy, let me just say that you are subhuman filth, and no one will ever care what you say or care what inconsequential excuses for notions pass through your tiny, preposterously inadequate minds."
,zimboptoo,2009-11-10T05:15Z,"chair_tard: Fox notates this season differently on different parts of their site.  In the recaps section, the episode Brave Heart is called ""606"" or ""s6_e06"" (thus counting the season opener as two episodes), but in the On Demand episode streaming section it is called ""Season 6: Episode 5"" (thus counting the season opener as one episode).  Here on tpb, the latter convention seems to have taken hold, and at this point it makes a lot more sense to pick a standard and stick with it rather than bickering about which one is the most pure and correct.  If the producers of the show can't make up their minds, then who are we to judge?

Honestly, a lot of confusion would be put to rest if uploaders would put the episode title in the torrent title along with the season and episode numbers.  But I'm not one to criticize the wonderful people who get this stuff up mere hours after it airs. "
