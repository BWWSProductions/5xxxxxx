The Charlatans (known in the United States as The Charlatans UK) are a British alternative rock band. The band's line-up is comprised by Tim Burgess (vocals), Mark Collins(guitar),Martin Blunt (bass),Tony Rogers(keyboards)and Jon Brookes (drums and percussion).                                                                               It's easy to forget that The Charlatans command a special place in music history, especially since recent albums have failed to perform as impressively as they might in commercial terms.
But Tim Burgess and co were at the forefront of the indie scene in the 90s and have consistently contributed some terrific music to the genre, whether it has been embraced by the masses or not.
Featuring 18 tracks, the album chronicles some of the bandâ€™s greatest moments, from their breakthrough hit Indian Rope in 1990 (which now appears on an album for the first time) through hits such as North Country Boy, The Only One I Know, Impossible and, most recently, Blackened Blue Eyes.
The ensuing collection provides a wonderful nostalgia trip that is certain to evoke some terrific memories (it certainly did for me!).
Who can forget the early, organ-driven hit The Only One I Know (a regular feature of any indie club night), which borrowed its distinct hook from Deep Purpleâ€™s Hush, or the adrenaline rush of How High, with its screaming organs and chant-along chorus.
