,Team.O,2010-08-04T11:31Z,"There is NOTHING wrong with this torrent. The .IMG files is Garmin map -file, it is N O T  DVD image file.

There are locked and unlocked Garmin maps. I.e so some of the maps needs to be unlocked before you transfer them to Garmin device (S60v3/v5 device, Garmin device etc.), some are already unlocked by the person who have added the torrent. This map, however, seems to be locked.

There are several methods to unlock the Garmin map(s), you can find more info about unlocking map(s) for example from:
http://www.noeman.org/gsm/#gps-navigation-systems
http://www.symbiantalk.net/index.php
http://gpsunderground.com/forum/forum.php
and
from PirateBay (search for example Garmin + jetmouse)

After the map is unlocked, all you need to do is transfer it to your Garmin device, for example to memory card.

No need to burn DVD, unless you want to make backup of it.

For this file ?
thx"
,north070,2011-04-02T23:02Z,"My Garmin(720s) told me that it did not support this map.
Nothing about not opening maps, just not supporting.
I have used guidelines that i found here about how  to install this.
So if someone have a clue about this, i would be happy !!"
,andybandy,2011-07-15T12:32Z,"Hi feikki80 and Team.O! 

What tricks do I have to do after I try to open this with mapsource?
It says that I need a 25 digit code? Is there a keygen or something or is this completely wrong?

I would be grateful for any answers! anyways thanks for a great torrent!:)"
