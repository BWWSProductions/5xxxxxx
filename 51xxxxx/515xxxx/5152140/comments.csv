Around 1935, a class of school children from a small village makes the trip to Zagreb. The story, based on a novel by Croatian writer Mato Lovrak, begins with the preparations for the trip and is focused around a group of classmates, two boys and a girl, who used to be best friends. After an incident their friendship ended and the boys are now competing for the attention of the girl and other classmates. One relies primarily on his honesty and intelligence while the other tries to accomplish his goals by bribery. During the visit to Zagreb, the teacher is suddenly taken ill and children have to get back to the village all by themselves. On the train, without the teacher, discipline is hard to maintain and consequently two groups form around each of the boys. Soon the train gets stuck in a snowstorm, the heating fails, the pupils are running out of food and some of them get sick. The children are forced to resolve their conflict and unite in order to get home safely. With the children?s help, the train crew finally manages to get through the snow drift and make it safely to the village. Mate Relja, Yugoslavia, 1976, Croatian, 85 min, fiction film, DVD-ROM
