Don't talk stupid. I have gained skull and crossbones because my software can be trusted. I believe the purpose of your statement is malice."
,eusarsn,2009-11-09T18:16Z,"You can say all the nice thing about your this crack, but now I have tried it 2 times. Means two complete new installations and this cracks after completeion asks for reboot ...and thats it...

After that the computer is dead I mean cyclic boot and No recovery works

So I am left with no choice but to say that this does NOT work, rather it spoils it totally"
[T],No_Religion,2009-11-09T22:06Z,"@ eusarsn,

possibly doesn't work on some Dells or Macs. 

Will work on any ordinary PC."

,DoragonMama,2009-11-13T02:28Z,"I tried this activator and my computer (homemade PC) rebooted fine but it still says I have 30 days to activate.
Seems it didn't work for me but didn't do any damage or anything.
If it matters I have Win7 RC1 installed.
Although the music made me jump out of my chair =p"

,mexikan_boi,2010-01-30T23:36Z,"It works!
Load windows like normal, and it's probably best to turn off your anti-virus. 
Then run the exe and wait a little bit for it to load.
Then click on ""Activate""
Wait for the program to finish installing the files and everything, and it will come to a point where it says ""Please wait""
This is where you need to restart your computer.
When you are booted up again, relaunch the exe and this time when it finishes, the program will get past the ""Please wait"" and will ask you to restart (I again turned off my antivirus before I launched the exe, just to make sure).
Once you restart, your copy of Windows will be activated :)
This worked on Windows 7 Professional, retail. 
Thanks No_Religion! ^_^"

But when i was going to activate it on my 2 other computers nothing happens, i install the program and restart the computer and everything seems to work but when i am looking on my system is still says you need to activate windows ???

So microsoft can kiss my ass if they thinking im buying another serial from them !!!

Anyway must say this is virus free and works 100% activated my windows within 4mins restarted system and checked and low and behold...windows vista is activated LOL

A bit of advise. I bought a new computer without operating system (ASRock computer, cost 320 EURO). I installed my old Win Vista SP1. It works fine, but the f****ng updates takes many hours! Next time I definitely download Win 7 to get around hours of update! "

But I am having trouble using this activator.
I am trying to activate widows 7 ultimate on my mac (Via boot camp) and when ever I do, it will do its thing then restart, but when it restarts it is never able to load windows again. Stays at a black screen right before the windows logo. (I have left my computer along thinking it was a slow restart.... for 3 hours)

I have tried 3 times (Yes, re-installing windows on the mac).

anyone got any advice?
Thanks in advance. "

Thanks"
,nismodrifter,2011-10-30T00:21Z,"Works 100%. 

Install windows
Run the activator.exe
When it says ""Please wait"" restart your computer via start button
After rebooting, run activator.exe again
It will then complete the process and say ""Windows is Activated""

This was with windows vista home premium.

Thanks!"
