                Hard Disk Sentinel Pro v3.00 Build 3736 + Activator



Hard Disk Sentinel (HDSentinel) is a multi-OS HDD/SDD monitoring and analysis 
application. Its goal is to find, test, diagnose and repair disk drive problems, 
report and display SDD and HDD health, performance degradations and failures. 
Hard Disk Sentinel gives complete textual description, tips and displays/reports 
the most comprehensive information about the hard disks and solid state disks 
inside the computer or in an external enclosure (USB / e-SATA). Many different 
alerts and report options are available to ensure maximum safety of your valuable 
data.

As hard disk sizes are constantly increasing, data stored on them are more and 
more valuable for the user of the computer (and this is especially true for a 
company or office). Serious problems can occur upon a hard disk failure.

Hard Disk Sentinel can monitor hard disk status, including temperature and 
S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology, built in most 
hard disks today) values for each hard disks. Also it measures the hard disk 
transfer speed in real time which can be used as a benchmark or to detect 
possible hard disk failures, performance degradations.

Hard Disk Sentinel can be used to prevent serious damage or data loss. It warns 
the user before a problem may occur and this gives opportunity to backup important
and valuable data.

HDSentinel is the perfect data protection solution: it can be effectively used to 
prevent HDD failure and SDD / HDD data loss because it has the most sensitive disk
health rating system which is extremely sensitive to disk problems. This way even 
a small HDD problem can't be missed. The Professional version has scheduled and 
automatic (on-problem) disk backup options to prevent data loss caused by not only 
failure but by malware or accidental delete also.



Features of Hard Disk Sentinel Professional:

Easy to use interface:
All information are displayed in the main window of the application. 
Quick controls allow easy navigation to access all hard disks, partitions and 
different information. Intuitive user interface elements display information by 
using green/yellow/red color to indicate the level of problem. Detailed text 
description and context sensitive help guides the user thru the features and 
options.

1. Install > 2. Configure > 3. Stay protected:
Just install, configure alerts and backup functions and your system is now safe. 
You'll be notified about the problems - but if everything is correct, Hard Disk 
Sentinel just sits on tray and displays current status. The data is protected 
24 hours daily, 7 days a week.

Backup:
Wide range of automatic backup methods are available: to backup data to local 
computer, to a LAN server or to a remote server by transferring files via FTP 
(or even by e-mail). It is possible to use 3rd party tools to create archives 
or burn CD/DVD media. Hard Disk Sentinel Professional can manage power status 
of remote computers in the network, so it is possible to automatically power 
on and shut down remote computers, for example a backup server.

API Interface For Developers:
With the API it is possible to query detected hard disk information from the 
software. This way 3rd party software can log, display or otherwise process 
detected disk information including temperature, health and so.

Remote Monitoring:
Hard Disk Sentinel Professional offers extensive remote monitoring capabilities. 
Hard disk status can be checked remotely by a web browser, even by a mobile phone 
or a PDA.

Instant S.M.A.R.T. analysing:
Hard Disk Sentinel can communicate with IDE, Serial ATA, SCSI and most USB HDD 
and SSD to detect their status and temperature. Disk status are displayed 
immediately as you launch the application, there is no need to analyse disks 
for a long period. It displays the current and maximum temperature for the 
hard disk. It reads all general and vendor-specific attributes and monitor 
their values. For advanced users, all raw data are displayed also including 
power-on time and number of read/write errors. Hard Disk Sentinel interprets 
the performance and fitness related S.M.A.R.T. values and displays the 
calculated Performance and Health percentage, total power on time and 
estimated lifetime remaining.

Hard Disk Hadware Tests:
By using Hard Disk Sentinel, it is possible to start hardware hard disk self tests.
These tests can be used to effectively find all hard disk problems because 
built-in hardware methods are used to verify hard disk components (for example 
heads, servo, internal buffer in the Short self test). The Extended self test 
also verifies the complete disk surface, finds and repairs all weak areas and 
re-allocates the possible bad sectors. This is not possible with the 
software-based disk surface scan methods (for example, by using scandisk).

Seek Noise Test:
Seek Test - to verify hard disk noise, seek time performance and temperature. 
Longer tests can be used as very deep and intensive stress-tests for the disk 
system and useful to verify if additional cooling is required.

Enhanced Disk Tests:
Surface Test - to verify hard disk surface with intensive disk testing methods 
to reveal and fix disk problems. Surface reinitialisation resets all sectors to
factory default states. Different destructive and non-destructive tests are 
available to re-fresh the condition of any hard disks, solid state disks or 
even your pendrives or memory cards.

Logging:
Hard Disk Sentinel logs all degradations in all SMART parameters and issues 
alerts in such cases to maximise data protection. For example, if a new bad 
sector is found on your hard disk, you will be notified.

Alerts:
Hard Disk Sentinel has wide range of alerts upon different problems. It can 
send e-mail (with e-mail->SMS gateway it can be SMS warning to your mobile), 
network message, can play sound alerts and so.It can execute various tasks 
(automatic panic backup or any configured external applications) in case of 
a problem.There is an option to send daily emails about current status.

Shutdown:
Offers option to shut down the computer on hard disk failure, HDD overheat or 
health degradation. This option can be used in combination of the alerts to 
prevent further data loss.

Hard Disk Details:
Detects and displays every information about the hard disk, from the revision 
number and buffer size to all features it has. The maximum available and current 
transfer modes are also displayed.

HDD status in Windows Explorer:
View the current health status and used space in Windows Explorer or in any other 
application, so you'll always know the amount of used space for each partitions 
and the disk condition.

Information on demand:
Current hard disk temperatures and health are displyed on the system tray and can 
be displayed in a small status window, the desktop itself or in a sidebar gadget 
(under Windows Vista or newer operating system). Average and maximum temperatures 
are logged for all hard disks and these informations are displayed in graphs for 
statistical purposes.

Hard Disk Performance:
Logs how much data were read from or written to the hard disk. Displays current 
transfer rates for both reading and writing and estimates the maximum available 
(theoretical) transfer rate for a particular hard disk.

Hard Disk Partitions:
Displays partitions for each physical hard disks and type and usage informations 
about them so you cannot run out of space. Hard Disk Sentinel sends this info 
automatically in alert/status messages.

Acoustic Management:
Offers option to control the acoustic level of IDE/S-ATA hard disk. 
It is possible to increase performance or make the disks more silent. Unique 
feature: control the acoustic level of your external USB hard disk (if your USB 
enclosure is equipped with proper USB-ATA bridge chip which supports this feature).

Clock Synchronization:
It offers option to synchronize the PC clock with an atomic clock via NTP (Network
Time Protocol).

Improvements:
Hard Disk Sentinel is constantly improving. More features will be available soon.
If you have any idea which can be useful, just let us know.



What's new in Hard Disk Sentinel Pro v3.00 Build 3738:

- Disk surface test functions (*) (accessible from File menu or by quick button) to 
  test hard disk and solid state disk surface with different read and write  test 
  methods. Destructive and non-destructive tests are possible and many settings
  are available including complete simple read tests, disk re-initialisation (**),   
  data area refresh (**), industry standard data-destruction (**) and so to help 
  disk diagnostics and repair. Temperature and data transfer speed is measured and 
  displayed during the test to analyse disk operation and slowly accessible regions. 
- Disk Contents Inspector allows to check stored information on the disk (*). 
- Detection of both SATA and SAS disks configured to RAID arrays on HighPoint 
  1xxx and 2xxx series RAID controllers (SAS only if applicable, for example by 
  the 2640x4 controller).
- Detection of new USB drives, SATA multipliers, external enclosures, SAS drives. 
- More SSD specific information and attributes displayed for various SSD devices 
  (for example OCZ, Corsair, Super Talent, Intel, Samsung, Crucial and so). 
- Added detection of new SSD devices. 
- Verify results online: compare details of a drive with reports received online, 
  to check if the drive is better or worse than average ("globe" with HDD icon) (*). 
- Right click over list of logical drives to hide drives or select button sizes (*). 
- Displaying highest temperature ever found in the entire lifespan of the disk, 
  option to reset measured highest/lowest temperatures. 
- Configurable tray icon font (Configuration -> Thresholds/tray icon). 
- Option to prevent disks from spin down (Configuration -> Disk control). 
- Hard Disk Sentinel API: 3rd party software can get disk information from the 
  software for further processing (*). 
- Many user interface fixes and improvements. 
- 150+ new hard disks in database. 
- Various minor bug fixes and improvements. 
- Fixed: random seek time test resulted errors on some disks over 1 TB. 
- Improved support for ARECA RAID controllers with STORPORT drivers. 
- Added Bulgarian language support - thanks for Georgi Nenov for the translation. 
- Added Greek language support - thanks for dancer_69 for the translation. 
- Added Swedish language support - thanks for Ulf for the translation. 
- Added Russian language support - thanks for Andrey Nikolaev for the translation. 

(*): available only in registered Hard Disk Sentinel and Hard Disk Sentinel 
Professional (**): available only in registered Hard Disk Sentinel Professional. 



System Requirements:

- Windows operating system (Windows 95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, 2008, 
                            Vista, Windows 7, Windows Home Server)
- Pentium or compatible CPU 
- 32 megabytes of system memory
- 15 megabytes of hard disk space
- System administrator account (in service mode, it is possible to use without 
  administrator rights and without even user logged in)
- One or more hard disk or solid state disk with ATA (IDE or Serial ATA/SATA II), 
  SCSI, SAS, USB interface. USB hard disk support depends on the USB-ATA bridge 
  chips. Other type of external disks (USB or IEEE 1394) are NOT supported because 
  the hard disk controller chip in the external enclosure does not support the 
  detection of S.M.A.R.T. information.


Note: RAID arrays usually do not provide S.M.A.R.T. informations. However, 
      standalone hard disks connected to standard RAID controllers (for example 
      motherboard integrated RAID controllers, like NVidia, Intel RAID) provide 
      this information most of the time. If you have good or bad experiences or 
      compatibility problems, please let us know. 

Note: The software can read and display all such information about hard disks 
      inside the arrays if the RAID array is controlled by a compatible RAID 
      controller card. It is also possible to manage these drives like standalone 
      drives.

Note: hard disk controller drivers can also cause incompatibility problems and 
      this case not all hard disk information may be displayed. 
      For more information, please check the compatibility page and for some 
      solutions, please read the information in the F.A.Q.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
