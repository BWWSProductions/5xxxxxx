Release Notes

Michael Jennings is a reverse engineer and what he does is technical jobs for certain 

companies and as soon as he is done, his memory of the work he has done is wiped out. Now 

the longest he has been contracted is 2 months. But now billionaire, James Rethrick offers 

him a job that would last 2 years, maybe 3, and he promises that he will probably earn 8 

figures. Michael agrees. Before beginning he turns in all of his personal effects. And when 

the job is done, his memory is erased and he learns he made over 90 million dollars over the 

three years. When he goes to claim it and his personal effects, he discovers that prior to 

the erasure of his memory he waived his rights to the money he earned and that the items 

that were given to him were not the ones he gave when he began. Later he is arrested by the 

FBI who say that he committed some act of treason and murder. It's while he is in custody 

that he escapes using some the items that he was given. He later meets with a friend who 

gives him some information that helps him understand what is going on. And at the same time 

Rethrick for some reason wants him so he is being pursued by Rethrick's people
