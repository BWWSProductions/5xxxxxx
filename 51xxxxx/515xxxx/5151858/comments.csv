serial and instructions work
the program itself sucks though: very few and crappy channels, most of them dont connect or have no sound

anyway, good upload, thanks aelfred"

,Balatago,2010-07-21T09:28Z,"Very many thanks. Although I'm seeding I'm not able to download! Prompted with ""Invalid Torrent File"" - Balatago"
,philjacksymo,2010-07-27T19:33Z,Contained a virus when I installed it.
,doorgunner,2010-09-03T10:33Z,"@Balatago, ""Invalid Torrent File"" is easily re-validated using UTorrent"
,doorgunner,2010-09-03T12:19Z,This is the 2nd Super Internet TV Premium I have downloaded.  Neither S/N worked.  I think they are wise to us...
