It says 'mounting image' then nothing. Just goes away. 

any ideas?"
,Orphen22,2010-01-02T00:08Z,"OK ignore my comment, I think I got it working. Had to convert the files to ISO.

Installing now :)"
,Orphen22,2010-01-02T00:18Z,"and just got an error at 53%

""A problem occurred when trying to transfer the file I:\Support\en-us\readme.txt"" from the media

Do you want to retry to copy the file or cancel the installation.

Clicking retry does nothing, mounting the 2nd disk does nothing."

,EngineerMan,2011-06-25T09:01Z,"For all those using DT Lite or any other DT program, if you have issues with drag and drop procedures working, listen up.
1. Open DT.
2. Have an active virtual drive.
3. Right-click on it in interface.
4. Click mount.
5. At bottom select all file types.
6. Find your image and/or bin files.
7. Select and open.
8. Watch and behold it working finally.
9. Be happy."
