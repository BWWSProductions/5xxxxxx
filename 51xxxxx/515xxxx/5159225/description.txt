Release notes:

Following the success of his Songs For My Mother album, Ronan Keating has
recorded another special set of songs, this time Christmas-themed, entitled
Winter Songs. A mix of traditional and modern festive classics, including tracks
from artists such as Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell and Sugarland, along with
the likes of "Silent Night" and the beautiful "Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas", these 11 songs evoke special memories of winter and Christmas for
Keating. The album also includes two brand new songs: "Its Only Christmas" and
"Scars".
