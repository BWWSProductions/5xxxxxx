Should seed (:"
,cassn,2009-11-25T19:29Z,"Actually I just noticed that at about 1:04 in Take It Slow it actually skips for a few seconds.
So far that's the only problem I've come across.
I'll let you know if I find any more."
,xXEscapingMyFateXx,2009-11-27T08:36Z,"@cassn i don't think it skips, it might just be the one time you were playing it because mine are fine, and i checked with adobe audition and there were no gaps of any sort."
