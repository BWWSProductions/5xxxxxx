Here's The Rundown ..

If You HAVE TO See This Joint Right Away, Its Watchable and The Audio Isn't That Bad (You Can Use VLC To Mess With The Video Levels)

... If Your Gonna Gather The Family Up To Watch This On The Telly, Quality Is A Bit Iffy, I Would Suggest Waiting, But Thats Me ;)

My Ratings Are As Follows

V-5
A-7

...An Again THANKS MovieFOX .. Good Upload!!"
