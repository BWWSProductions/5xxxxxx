Trailer:

From Hungarian director GÃ¡bor Koltay comes this epic retelling of the history of Hungary. Beginning after the death of the nation's founder Istvan, the film follows the ascension of King Laszlo I to the long vacant throne in the 11th century AD. From there the film is a barrage of battle sequences, political conspiracies, and loves stories as Hungary rises to its position as a mighty European kingdom. Produced to coincide with Hungary's 1,000th anniversary, Sacra Corona was funded by the Hungarian government as part of the national celebration.
