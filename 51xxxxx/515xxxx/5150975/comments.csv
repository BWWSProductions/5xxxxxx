,lkfr,2009-11-15T18:07Z,"@hayesy316 Science is never a completely done deal; ""scientifically proven"" is an essentially meaningless phrase. He may or may not be wrong on that one point, but that does not make him disingenuous or inherently wrong about everything else."

This isn't a question of scientific epistemology. When you make a specific historical claim regarding the number and strength of hurricane activity linked to increased atmospheric carbon concentration, the data either proves you right or wrong. Hurricane activity has been declining over the past 30 years. Gore either doesn't know this, or doesn't expect you to know this."

,AardvarkFirefly,2011-04-30T18:43Z,"Anytime anyone makes generalized assertions like these, you just know you are hearing from the best minds that can be found - not on a scientific site exchanging valid views and findings, but when perusing pilfered intellectual property - exactly the place where anonymity guarantees the most ignorant of opinions will be published - and ignored by 99.9999% of the world.

I love it when you Internet SMEs express your ignorance by trying to convince the rest of us that you know dick. If you have an opinion that can hold water, why don't you take your arguments to the scientific/social forums where it is openly discussed and your feeble claims would be immediately debunked - that's why.

Posting your nonsense in a forum where the subject matter was found because we sought it out to judge for ourselves is a waste of time (you excel at it, we are sure).  You are so deluded that you think you are doing the world a service and we want to hear from you - except like everything else, you are wrong because we do not want to be told by unqualified sources what their silly opinion is.
