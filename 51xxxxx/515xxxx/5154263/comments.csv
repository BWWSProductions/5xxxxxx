eztv has the wrong tracker URLs in all their torrents.
Change it in your bit torrent client to this one:

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce"
,stinto,2009-11-09T09:29Z,thx a bunch
,boneyard09,2009-11-09T09:50Z,"@Velvet
I have never had to change the tracker before, looked on the forums and uTorrents site on how to do this with no luck.

I see the trackers changing but no place to edit :-/"

,aelfred,2009-11-09T11:01Z,"Thanks eztv.


In utorrent right click the dexter torrent select properties in the general tab you will see a list of trackers copy and paste the link http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce , thats it for those who do not know how to add a tracker in utorrent."
,aelfred,2009-11-09T13:18Z,Just a quick point this appears to be a mix of episode 6 and episode 7 ? Does anyone else find this. Is this correct and should be a mix of a previous episode? 
,aelfred,2009-11-09T13:23Z,*mixed with an old episode?

,cmiller99,2009-11-09T15:06Z,"thanks eztv

newbie question, whats the reason for the need to add a proper tracker?"
,almona,2009-11-09T23:29Z,thanks!!!
,xler8,2009-11-10T00:43Z,"Ah dex! 
perfect again eztv! thank u so much!"
,oOAcuraOo,2009-11-10T02:32Z,THx dude!
,feather22,2009-11-10T06:34Z,EZTV is a deity.
,domdomtom,2009-11-14T09:37Z,"Guys I would definitely change your trackers.  I got an e-mail sent to me from my ISP saying they got asked by whoever makes dexter (something entertainment, I forgot)  to tell me to remove the computer that downloaded Dexter from my network.  Of course I have a wirless network fully protected but some idiot keep hacking in.  But yeh, it's either a tracker getting IP addresses or one of the leechers.  Either way, not good."
,domdomtom,2009-11-14T09:39Z,"Basically it's not worth it. if you're in America, just go to the dexter website to watch it!"
,jawelles,2009-11-15T13:16Z,"Hey EZTV! My torrent hero! I'm waiting till the season ends! Could you make a torrent at the end with al the episodes in one torrent?
