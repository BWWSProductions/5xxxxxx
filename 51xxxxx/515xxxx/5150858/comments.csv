,dewey320,2009-11-16T02:39Z,wonder if this would work on my 2008 Toyota Sequoia Platinum?   Are there differences between the toyota and lexus dvd's?

,iatype,2010-02-19T04:08Z,There is a Nav Gen 5 9.1 on demonoid that works great.  This one will never produce.
,ciscotech2012,2010-03-18T02:05Z,"finally after days the download has finished but there's two files... which one do you use to write the DVD?

has anyone gotten this torrent to actually work? we used each of the files seperately to burn a DVD but neither works. we tried 3 dvd burning apps and 3 different dvd dual layer manufacturers.

sometimes the application will say at almost the end of the burning there is an error and the app cannot read the source file. tried redownloading the torrents to make sure it wasn't a file issue.

if you got this torrent to work please take two seconds to register with piratebay and post a comment including all the steps you used to get these files to burn a dvd, include the application you used (and any settings) and dvd burner and dvd disk type and maker.. thanks!"
,unreal1171,2010-06-13T17:44Z,i have a ls430 2006 does this cover it or know where to find it? i dont think its covered here.
,heintzr57,2010-07-07T06:36Z,"I FIGURED IT OUT! You must change the booktype to DVD-ROM
when you burn. Works Flawlessly now. 

Make sure you change booktype to DVD-ROM regardless of whatever burning program you use or else you will be wasting lots of discs like I did! Thanks for the torrent!
ENJOY!!!"
