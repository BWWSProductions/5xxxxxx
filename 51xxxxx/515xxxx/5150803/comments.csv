,Sithlordmike90,2009-11-24T06:48Z,Did you finish the download? And did it work(I hope anyways) I tested my rip and it seemed to work fine for me so hopefully its working for everyone else too.
,hxh103,2009-12-21T06:25Z,"anyone confirm to be working?

thanks sithlordmike90 for the up. also a suggestion, maybe use wii scrubber and compress to a zip to make size smaller for next time."
,Sithlordmike90,2010-01-19T18:22Z,I was planning on scrubbing it but I got lazy lol I had already made a rar file with it in there
