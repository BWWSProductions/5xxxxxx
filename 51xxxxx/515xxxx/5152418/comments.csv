,helgi.mos,2009-11-11T12:32Z,Thank you very much! I can not live without this utility. 
,zogulusnig,2009-11-24T22:31Z,"For anyone that is interested, you can DL this utility from the source:

http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/

Then use it's installer to uninstall any previous version.  Make sure to check the box in the uninstall settings to delete your preferences as well.

Then, in the terminal, do this:

cd ~/Library/Application\ Support
rm .com.stclairsoft
touch .com.stclairsoft
chmod -w .com.stclairsoft

That will delete at reset the invisible reg file.

Now you can register with the Macmofo serial from Serial Box or KCNS.

Not to poo-poo this torrent.  It's just an alternative."
,TheArchiver,2010-06-24T17:30Z,@ zoguslusnig : why not but serial box doesn't have a serial for the current version (4.3.8).
