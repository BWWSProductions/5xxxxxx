I've been using this app for years, as the open close dialog boxes just don't do the trick.  You'll wonder why they didn't install it in the OS

DESCRIPTION

Default Folder X... Recently rated 5 mice by MacUser UK and 4.5 mice by Macworld, Default Folder X attaches a toolbar to the right side of the Open and Save dialogs in any OS X-native application. The toolbar gives you fast access to various folders and commands. You just click on the buttons to go to your favorite and recently used folders, manage the folders and files shown in the list, and make changes to your settings.

Default Folder also fixes a number of problems in Open and Save dialogs, rebounding back to the last selected file, putting the path listing back in the top menu, and correcting bugs in scrolling column views.

WHAT'S NEW
Version 4.3.3:

# Corrected a bug which could cause Default Folder X to use excessive amounts of CPU time when a file server was mounted on the Desktop under Mac OS 10.5.
# The shift key now works in the menus for Finder Windows, Disks, and Favorites to reverse the order of the menu items.
# The installer now automatically starts Default Folder X after installation, and provides a tip on how to get started.
# Fixed a bug that could cause Default Folder X to stop working in Carbon applications when running under Mac OS 10.4.
# Safeguarded against possible errors which might cause a file dialog to be reset to have a zero width.
# Enabled Default Folder X in Jing.
