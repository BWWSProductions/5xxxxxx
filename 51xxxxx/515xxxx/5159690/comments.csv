,jdbjdb,2010-02-12T21:21Z,How to I convert this file to burn to DVD?  I normally use Imageburn and/or DVD Shrink for creating ISO files.  I am not familiar with this file type.  Any help is much appreciated.

Let's change this upload speed; there are 7 100% seeders and they are not even giving enough download speed- I'm ranging from 14.00 to 16.00kB/s"

Which dvd ripper program did you use by keeping the menu and getting rid of the extras?

Thanks!"
