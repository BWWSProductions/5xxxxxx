 Food, Inc. lifts the veil on our nation's food industry, exposing how our nation's food supply is now 
 controlled by a handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of consumer health, the livelihood of the 
 American farmer, the safety of workers and our own environment. Food, Inc. reveals surprising - and often 
 shocking truths - about what we eat, how it's produced and who we have become as a nation.

 I removed most of the extras including the DD 2.0 soundtrack, the celebrity public service announcements, the
 ABC News docu on the subject and a couple of other short docus, the trailers and the previews. Kept were the 
 DELETED SCENES (37:41@2602), a RESOURCES text page, and THE BOOK text page.
