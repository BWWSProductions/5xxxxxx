Isn't this backwards?  Shouldn't ""Yes Minister"" be seeded before ""Yes Prime Minister"", given that the former precedes the latter?"
,nokilli,2009-11-11T11:14Z,"And then it uses the search function, and then it sees that, yes, Yes Minister was indeed seeded before Yes Prime Minister.

So all is well, thanks for the very excellent up."
,goeratpb,2009-11-13T19:55Z,Thanks - loved these when they were new and will enjoy some nostalgia. Unfortunately the sound (at least for the first episode which I just checked) is ÂŤ'orribleÂť. I can see it's 128 kb/s MP3 but ist sounds like 20 kb/s...
