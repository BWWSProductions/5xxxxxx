Initially based in Deolali, India, the company are later sent to entertain the troops in Burma.

Sgt. Major Williams (Windsor Davies) is an old soldier who's been lumbered with the job of looking after "a load of puffs".

Among the "puffs" he has to keep his eye on are Gunner 'Lofty' Sugden (Don Estelle), Gunner 'Gloria' Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes), Gunner Parkin (Christopher Mitchell) and Gunner Graham (John Clegg).

The concert party is commanded by Colonel Reynolds (Donald Hewlett), who is assisted by Captain Ashwood (Michael Knowles).
