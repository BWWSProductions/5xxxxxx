what kind of movie file is it?"
,tkdb13,2010-06-17T04:20Z,"Kind of a pain to figure out how to play it properly, but if you're looking for an actual subbed version of this movie (as in actual translations of the Japanese audio rather than just direct captions of the English audio), this is the best I've found.

For those who have problems getting it to play, I found the best way to do it was to open the VIDEO_TS.ifo file with Windows Media Player. Media Player Classic could also play it, but for some reason I can never get softsubs to work in MPC. I couldn't find a way to get it to work at all with VLC."

,objectinspace,2011-07-03T22:29Z,"The quality of this is not very good. It looks like it's been recorded in a cinema, or at least digitised from dirty film, which is not something I would expect from Studio Ghibli. I strongly suspect this was ripped from a badly pirated DVD.

Other torrents also seem to have this problem, e.g. the video in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6384626/Princess_Mononoke_%5BDual_Audio%5D_%281997%29_HDTV_720p_-__650MB_-_YIFY is the looks like the same video as this upscaled to 720p (although it claims to be HDTV). At least that one isn't a 4GB download though.

I was planning on buying this movie, but am hesitant to if this is the quality of the commercial disc too..."
