+12 trainer is working fine for me.I haven't tried other trainers yet but they are all working and if in case you see message >> CAN'T CREATE c:/windows/system32/sc.dll << then do it manually by copying the file provided in above
folder.


WARNING : Do not select all cheats at a time as this might
cause the game to crash down.Just select what you need at that time..


ENJOY!!!!
