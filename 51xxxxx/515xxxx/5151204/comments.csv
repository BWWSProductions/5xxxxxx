,Gorkas,2009-11-26T17:55Z,Works fine..   I did install this one first with keygen. And then i installed the newest premium version right on it 7815 without having to enter any key. And it seams like i got the new one registred this way. Keygen might work with a fresh install also.
,pompomboy,2010-03-19T16:01Z,Thanks - Win7 ok - Run keygen in Sandboxie - then upgrade to 7856
,waskeer,2010-04-07T17:23Z,Mcafee won't allow extraction of keygen citing it as a Dropper virus. :(  Anyone else run into this?

I'll not disable antivirus."
,waskeer,2010-04-17T15:31Z,"Tried this on two different machines with the same result. The keygen IS a virus... ""Backdoor bla bla"". Does anyone have a keygen that works on build 7795 and up??"
