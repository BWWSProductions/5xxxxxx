GRID.exe - System Error
The program can't start beacause d3dx9_41.dll is missing from your computer . Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem .

Most of times when u see errors like this (... .dll) u have to install the directx in game's folder but I couldn't find it 
I even tried to 1.2 crack and 1.1 but it doesn't work after u install patch 1.3 
Help plz !"

After you installed the patch and overwrite the 1.3 crack you have to Download this .dll file :
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_41

And copy it in your system folder

----------------------------------------
-Where is the system folder ?

go to : C:/windows/system

That should do .
you're welcome mates !"
