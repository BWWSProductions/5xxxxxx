This whole series is big.

In all there are only four episodes with English subtitles, in Season 1.
The first three seasons are all black-and-white shows and are smallest in size.
For these, show times run about 50 minutes.
The last two seasons are color and run from 50 minutes to 1 hr. 40 min.
These color ones had four kinds of subtitles--all in Scandanavian languages.
I left these out because of space considerations. Pardon.
