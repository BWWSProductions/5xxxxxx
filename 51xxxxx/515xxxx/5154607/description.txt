Travel Channel Julian&Camilla's World Odyssey
http://www.travelchannel.co.uk/J%2BC/

A documentary travel series presented by Julian Hanton and Camilla Andersen. It unravels unscripted travel plans and all the bizarre encounters made along the way, such as masked Mexican wrestlers, Thai transsexuals, Indian gurus, Jamaican conmen and Peruvian Alien Worshippers. 
Cheapskate traveller Julian and his laid-back companion Camilla explore the more bizarre aspects of our world, as well as capturing the feel of the traveller network. Interviewing other travellers and getting to the bottom of each countryΓÇÖs sub-culture.

The series switches between the fun and lighthearted moments travellers treasure; and the insights and experiences that lie beneath a country's facade, which travellers remember

Poland

Excited about their very first European Odyssey to Poland, Julian and Camilla land in the city of Gdansk. Julian starts to learn Polish very quickly as he admits that he finds the Polish ladies very lovely. While visiting fairytale castles in the area they find dedicated medieval fans dressed up as knights and about to engage in mock battle. Dressing up and joining in, our travellers take opposite sides and it doesn't take long before Julian is firing the canon at Camilla. The battle ends and they make up over a morning shot of vodka. Moving south, the medieval theme continues in the town of Torun. Finding even more people dressing up in period costume, Julian challenges the knowledge of a man dressed up as Nicholas Copernicus, who was born in this town. Famous for gingerbread, our presenters visit a gingerbread factory and bake and eat replicas of each other.
