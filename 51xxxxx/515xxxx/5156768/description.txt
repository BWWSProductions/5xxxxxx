OVERVIEW:

Pirates of Silicon Valley is a 1999 film based on the book Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine. It is a made-for-television docudrama written and directed by Martyn Burke which documents the rise of the home computer (personal computer) through the rivalry between Apple Computer and Microsoft.

EDITS: I have recolored the movie, from another torrent. It took about 8 hours for the process to finish, but here it is. I recolored it because the color black was very faded, and colors wouldn't seem as bright as they should.

WARNING! This is a low quality video. It is from 1999 VHS tapes, after all. Don't go ratting me out for bad quality. I tried to improve it.

I have a somewhat lower than normal speed connection. My max seed speed is 50 kilobytes per second. If you don't seed, this torrent will die, and this recolor would have been useless.
