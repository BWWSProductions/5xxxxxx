,norbpx,2010-12-30T00:34Z,"The 1.4 update has some great improvements, but unfortunately we can't use that patch, because it needs v1.1c to be installed. I searched everywhere on the net but just can't find the 1.1c patch.
Can somebody pleeeeeease upload 1.1c or post a link if you know where i can get it?"
