,elielCT,2009-12-15T16:57Z,"im the ONLY seeder bcuz its such a huge file no1 has yet to finish... when my comp is down there are no seeders :0( unfortunatley.. 

i will be breaking the torrent into 5 (for each disk) to resolve this problem.. however, many things goin on in personal life... im tryin to seed as much as possible, this one is set with first priority in my tor client...."
