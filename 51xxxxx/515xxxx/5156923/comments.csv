,Beta_Tron,2009-12-01T18:42Z,"You are very welcome, I've also had a rough year. 

Thank you to every seeder for making it a fast and easy download. 

At first I couldn't find it on the pirate bay so I bought it, and the same day Uploaded it for all of you!  =)"
,Jason_H,2009-12-01T19:24Z,"Same here. I was some what suprised too, I felt that somebody would have bought and loaded it up, so I was planning on buyingas well, then I saw yours. Good timing I guess. Again, thank you."

Cheers again."
,Lightitup2924,2009-12-23T01:25Z,"Hey thank you Beta_Tron and all the seeders, only 1 leecher and fully downloaded in 10 seconds, great Christmas present indeed!!! I made an account after about a year and a half of ghost lurking and downloading (but i always seed :-D) just to say thank you to all the brave pirates who stand in the face of the law to make the world a funner (and cheaper XD) place, I've had a very tough year out of work and moving back in with the relatives and if it wasn't for this site and all you wonderful uploaders it would have been a very boring year indeed, although I plan to buy the album with my Christmas cash because I love supporting Adult Swim. Meaty Christmas to all who support this website, and down with WMG the biggest opponent in the war on free sharing (and down with FOX networks for the many cease and desist letters I've received for seeding) Seriously, supporters of TPB make the world a better place, I love you guys :') "
,Lightitup2924,2009-12-23T01:30Z,"BTW if it wasn't for this album i never would have known who Neko Case was, I google Imaged the name. OMG SO HAWT XD"
,Lightitup2924,2009-12-23T01:36Z,"Sorry bout so many comments but you guys should check the video on adultswims website for Ill be home for christmas. The lyrics are so much funnier idk why they changed it for the album, in the video its ""Ill be home this christmas passed out on the floor, theres a real good chance I pissed my pants, get some new pants out of the pant drawer"" instead of the football lines in the beginning of the album version, idk why they changed it cuz its not censoring, he still talks about jerkin to porn XD oh well just lettin you guys know cuz the lyrics in the vid version were so funny i almost pissed MY pants, thanks once again Beta_Tron for this great album! Meaty Christmas Y'all! "
