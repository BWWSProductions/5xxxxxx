Mark Rappaport - IMPOSTORS (1980)


LANGUAGE: English
SUBTITLES: None


SYNOPSIS: Impostors is a low-budget, hard-to-figure independent film by director Mark Rappaport. The actors intentionally parrot lines in an emotionless fashion as the story about two seemingly murderous, vaudeville magicians unfolds. Chuckie (Charles Ludlam) and Mikey (Michael Burg) borrow from models like Peter Lorre characters or the Marx Brothers in their antics. Their assistant Tina (Ellen McElduff) is of a dual sexual persuasion, apparently. One of her liaisons (Peter Evans) turns out to be a bit of an imposter himself but a lot can be forgiven because of the cash that comes with him.
