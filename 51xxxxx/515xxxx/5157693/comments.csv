You my sir are an officer and a gentleman!"
,boxorats,2010-05-22T23:18Z,"This is a great torrent. Thanks very much! This is one of the best TV shows ever made (natch) and the torrent files look great (or at least, as great as it's possible to be given the way they shot these BBC shows in that era!) - I own the DVD set but have it stored in another country at present, so I can confirm with reasonable authority that the torrent looks really as good as the DVDs do."

I think the fact that a 30 year old political satire still has this many seeds shows there are still a lot of people with taste on tpb."

,domifanvcr,2011-05-29T02:59Z,This show is brilliant.  I once used an epsiode in my Psych Stats class at Uni.  The one where Humphrey shows that any survey can be made to get you the answer you want - I LOVE IT!!
