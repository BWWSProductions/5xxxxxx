Better known as One Summer of Happiness, Hon Dansade en Sommar was the most popular and financially successful of Swedish director Arne Mattson's romantic films. Based on the novel by Per Olof Ekstrom, the story revolves around the romance between college graduate Goran (Folke Sundquist) and farmer's daughter Kerstin (Ulla Jacobsson). Their plans to marry are stymied by the opposition of a local clergyman (John Elfstrom). Only after a devastating tragedy occurs does Goran realize the folly of allowing others to make decisions for him. Though Arne Mattson could have spent the rest of his career turning out Bergmanesque exercises like this one, he decided to switch creative gears and concentrate on Hitchcockian thrillers.

his film was mentioned by a 1954 Memorandum of the New York State Education Department, written with regard to New York State Law 1954, Chapter 620, which added definitions of "immoral" and "incite to crime" for motion picture censorship purposes. The Memorandum cited this film as an example of a film about which the ED's Motion Picture Division had been "beset with inquiries and applications for reconsideration of motion pictures which heretofore have been regarded as contrary to the present provisions of the statute." It stated that One Summer of Happiness "contains a scene where a boy, nineteen, and a girl, seventeen, spending a vacation together, swim and embrace in the nude."

The 1951 film Hon dansade en sommar (She Danced a Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness) depicted scenes that were at the time considered too sexual, but by today's standards would be fairly mild. This film, as well as Bergman's Sommaren med Monika (The Summer with Monika), caused an international uproar, not least in the US where the films were charged with violating standards of decency

Sommaren med Monika is a Swedish 1953 film directed by Ingmar Bergman. It sparked controversy abroad for its frank depiction of nudity, and along with the film One Summer of Happiness from the year before, directed by Arne Mattsson, it started the reputation of Sweden as a sexually liberated place. (While Sweden is relatively sexually liberal in many regards, much of the concept of "Swedish sin" is largely exaggerated and was perpetuated by the film industry, not least by the so-called "Schwedenfilme" produced in Germany.)
