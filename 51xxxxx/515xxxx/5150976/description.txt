I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the lord
But you donâ€™t really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Halleluuuuujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Halleluuuujah

Well maybe thereâ€™s a god above
But all Iâ€™ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody whoâ€™d out drew ya
And itâ€™s not a cry that you hear at night
Itâ€™s not someone whoâ€™s seen the light
Itâ€™s a cold and itâ€™s a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah (x12)
