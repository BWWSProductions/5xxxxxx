Trinity was an elite college at the University of Bridgeford for over 900 years, catering exclusively to the rich and powerful. But for the first time in its illustrious history, the school is going to open its doors to students from a wider variety of social classes.

The eight-part series follows the new students' journey as they realize that Trinity College is not quite as it seems.
