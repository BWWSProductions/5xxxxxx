,GetBusyLiving,2009-11-13T18:28Z,THIS COPY IS SHIT WHY WOULD YOU SUBMIT THIS YOU CUNT
,CubeIce,2009-11-13T19:14Z,"extremezone - I am not happy with the quality. Glad you had a sample, so i could decide on not downloading the rest. Your Spanish uploads are always of good quality, but your english ones are not - Why is that mate ?"
,unidogma,2009-11-13T20:39Z,"PLEASE REMEMBER TO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF LEAVING THE AUTO FOCUS FUNCTION ON CAM VERSIONS. Focus has already been done, turn it off any the video will improve lots ;)!!"

,Crossfire,2009-11-14T00:03Z,Kinda funny that pepole lke to watch movies in bad quality
,oscarthebrown,2009-11-14T02:28Z,"Hello, So anyone here, (some uploader hopefully) who knows why rar files are used? I mean...why? Even when it just means i have to use some codec app. to translate and compress so my media program plays it, it still wastes time. Oh...and most uploads are in avi or somthing similar, usually avi...i just don't get it...and also the quality is good, a7 v7...cheers extremezone...fuck the man...and all you leechers, if u cant seed buy a tpb hoodie or somthing..."
,d-pad,2009-11-14T03:05Z,"so is this pan&scan to 16:9 or sidecropped?
original ar is 2.35:1"
,syndre,2009-11-14T14:19Z,"The volume is set at ""48""...
...and its in stereo!




(message pops up approx. eighty-nine times randomly during the movie"
,showspawn,2009-11-14T15:16Z,"First off, let me say that I am not a big supporter of RAR files. However to answer your question why they are used. Yes it is a compression file system, but that is not why it is commonly used on TPB. It is used on here because of its amazing ability to use a file recovery algorithim that is capable of keeping large files intact when transfering over ""not so perfect"" methods of file sharing, or very long distances such as Torrent sites. By creating ""multi micro versions"" of itself, there is less chance of the file being corrupted, missing data, or simply tampered with via free agent spyware. SO, as much as we hate RAR files, they actually do perform a much needed service sometimes. Then again, some uploaders should be more selective of when they use it. It isnt needed for every file you upload. Educate yourself uploaders and downloaders alike. LONG LIVE THE PIRATE BAY!!!!!"
,syndre,2009-11-14T16:38Z,"@showspawn: 
good guess, but not even close. 
The ""scene"" guidelines require the ripping group to pack avi's into 14mb files because that is the max file size you can post on alt.binaries

It doesnt really have anything to do with the fact that it's a .rar"
,syndre,2009-11-14T16:42Z,"I'd actually rather see scene shit in their original rar packaging, with an sfvs..  

That tells me that the torrent uploader didn't fuck with the group (IMAGiNE's) rip."
,doomjack6,2009-11-14T20:25Z,so is it a cam version again or not?
,pentagraham,2009-11-15T00:14Z,"is this a cam or no? also if its a rar.....just unpack it stupid. if theres a lot, just ctrl a, right click, unrar. dumbshit."
,MikeCock,2009-11-15T02:18Z,Looks horrible on my HDTV.  Wait for DVD rip if you care about quality.
,davedengl,2009-11-16T09:27Z,Be patient. Will be released on DVD on December 15th.
,doomjack6,2009-11-16T12:03Z,"ok, then i wait :P"
,Samoz92,2009-11-16T17:25Z,"Screener, dvdrip or T5..? :p"
