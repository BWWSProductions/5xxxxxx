Thai Massage Manual : Natural Therapy for Flexibility, Relaxation and Energy Balance (A Step-by-Step Guide to Traditional Healing Techniques)

Thai Massage is one of the ancient healing arts of traditional Thai medicine, the others being herbal medicine and spiritual meditation. The term â€˜massageâ€™ conjures up images of something quite different from Thai massage, which even at its most basic, is a very complex sequence soft tissue pressing, stretching, twisting and joint manipulations. Thai massage has been in a process of constant evolution for over 1,000 years. It is not surprising, therefore, to find many subtile variations in the techniques used by different practitioners and even greater differences are apparent between the styles of bodywork characteristic of the North and South Thailand. The techniques presented by Maria Mercati in this book are essentially a â€˜pot pourriâ€™ of those taken from various regions of the country. Beginners will find them flowing the harmonious and very similar to what one could expect to receive at the hand of a Thai master. Maria Mercati has trained extensively throughout Asia to become one of the worldâ€™s acknowledged teachers and therapists in traditional Thai Message, Tui Na, acupuncture and Indonesian massage. This best-selling author has created a unique whole body Thai massage which is shown here for the first time.
