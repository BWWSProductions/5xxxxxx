This was because i'm in the middle of a devourse with my wife and
i'm still living with my parents and i have a bad internet connection
It's a USB internet stick so i'm still not been able to upload large
videofiles.

As soon as i'm settled on my own i will be back with more uploads!!!

With very special regards to all my fans outhere...
