Finally found a working copy of RevisionFX DeNoise 1.1.5 + Serial.

This plugin is awesome at removing video noise, it actually makes the footage look smoother while retaining all the detail.

Intelligent algorithms ensure the footage looks incredible.

Definitely should be in every After Effects users toolbox.
