Cambridge University entrance exams (STEP papers) in Mathematics. All these are unavailable from the official site because they are too old.

Six questions should be attempted in three hours. Calculators may be used for the papers up to and including those set in 1996, but not for those set in later years. Some topics included in the 1987-97 examinations are no longer part of the STEP syllabus.
