Two crew members are stranded on a spacecraft and quickly - and horrifically - realize they are not alone. Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined."

A: 7
V: 8

The audio slipped in and out of sync from time to time. No biggie. The syncing problems could also be caused by my p.c. 

Thanks for the up raymond!!

,leechtroll,2009-11-10T07:15Z,"A=6 definitely not DVD or Region 5 quality, really sounds like a higher quality CAM audio
V=8 at times picture quality is pixelated (resolution lessens) 

Movie=7 different that's for sure

thanks nonetheless. Personally I'd wait for proper DVD rip to enjoy this film as theirs heaps of sounds effects and special effects"
,Kooblukhan,2009-11-10T08:15Z,"ya honestly wait for a proper dvd rip.  picture is passable, but the audio is very scratchy and oddly flat and off pitch, voices and sound effects sound completely unnatural.  Watched the first 20 min and turned it off because as leechtroll says, theres lots of great sfx and the movie kinda depends on the atmosphere created by them.  Nothing worse than being jarred out of a tense moment by the constant reminder you are listening to a poorly recorded audio track.  Looks like it will be a good mood-movie though.

A-4 or 5
V-7

If you are fine watching cams, go for it, otherwise..."
,bigfunk21,2009-11-10T08:57Z,"Holy shit, bad ass movie, Honestly wait for dvdrip for better sound and then watch this shit at like 1 in the morning pure darkness loud ass hell with the bass up.  I felt like i was on the ship, crazy movie. we need more shit like this, best that came out this year i think. thats just my opinion though."
,Hatchet_Harry,2009-11-11T17:32Z,Sounds like Alien with half the cast removed.

,equazcion,2009-11-11T23:58Z,"Video is barely passable, audio is terrible. I had trouble understanding dialog a lot of the time. This is clearly not a DVD rip.

To the uploader: If this is not a DVD rip, could you edit the title of this torrent to remove that claim? Perhaps replace it with ""R5"", which is more likely?"
,shinobiung,2009-11-12T13:32Z,"I dont know what these people are watching, but it looks like a dvd rip,

A = 8  

V = 8

Movie sucks because the main hero character looks like a pheodophile and Denis Quaid looks nothing like his younger self, Cung Le might as well played him :P. But movie was entertaINing because of Cung. And this movie is much better than alot of the crap in the top 100 at the moment."

,Kooblukhan,2009-11-12T21:46Z,"I wonder if those scammer comments from ppl like tangabqq is from a program that takes excerpts from previous comments or if it is actually some jerk doing it manually...  
Also an R5 is not just a DvDrip Crimacabre, as evidenced by the quality of this copy as opposed to, say, a dvd released commercially in the states..."

,Phatfish,2009-11-13T11:33Z,"Ok lets put thinks straight....

A - 5
V - 6

Totaly watchable but it feels more like a R5 rip.
Sound is better than a lot of other R5 cam recorded sound. I had no problem at all hearing the dialoge.

As far as movie goes its not that bad. I enjoyed it. However its not a masterpiece either.

And howabout being a bit thankful for the effort you guys?
How about:
""Thank you for the upload mr./mrs. Raymondhome!"

,jengiscan,2009-11-14T14:05Z,good quality picture.....really fucking terrible sound..so bad I didnt really know what the fuck was going on.....the plot was taken from every sci fi movie you have ever seen.....ultimately in one eyeball out the other type of film....thanks for the upload though.

A bit of fun, I DID enjoy the movie, but couldn't help thinking ""Sean of the dead"" with an American accent... But hey, ALL zombie movies should be made a bit tongue in cheek, unlike some messy remakes,,

Thinking of Shaun of the Dead, I now have a certain Queen tune stuck in my head"

,dlarrym,2009-11-18T09:31Z,"Crimacabre....NO R5  DOESN't mean its a DVDrip at all. R-stands for region code and the 5 designates it originated in either Russia or somewhere in Africa. If i was in Russia, any DVD i purchase is region coded R5. This info is give to us because many DVD players won't play DVD's that are NOT from there own region.   My point is just because It came from Russia, or is ""R5"" this is not a reflection of its quality... I SWEAR in my life this is true. Rather then argue this FACT.... If you think your right, I DARE you to goto the address below and read up on this FACT:

The subs really suck though.
The best English subs are 'DoNE' but aren't synced with the IMAGINE version of the film.
Best solution if you need the English subs and are not hearing impaired: Download the FXG version of the film but dump the subs since they're for the hearing impaired. Get the DoNE subs in English from either opensubtitles.org or moviesubtitles.org. No sync required."
