Brazilian singer Rita Lee's bossa nova tribute to the Fab Four is a well-chosen set that occasionally veers towards the sublime, as on her interpretation of "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds," and "Minha Vida," her Brazilian version of "In My Life." "All My Loving" becomes a sultry love letter, while "Here, There, and Everywhere" only adds to the swooning romanticism of the original.
