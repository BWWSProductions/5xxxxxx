,helpfuld,2009-11-17T09:52Z,Apologies for not seeding for long over last two days. But have not installed utorrent which seems to upload abit faster.
,helpfuld,2009-11-17T09:53Z,"Woops,.... But have NOW installed utorrent which seems to upload abit faster. "
,helpfuld,2009-11-17T10:00Z,"Can anyone advise, would the upload be any faster if i run both Bittorrent and Utorrent programmes at the same time off two diff ports?"
,BeppertjeBep,2009-11-19T00:58Z,"@helpfuld...
Maybe if you download nothing yourself for 1 day
and upload only this torrent, we can help you seeding ....."
,helpfuld,2009-11-20T12:32Z,"BeppertjeBep,.... Thanks, but i'v been trying that. Regardless of if I have downloads active or not, with just Utorrent running I cant upload more than 35 - 40 kb/s. But i have found that with both Utorrent and Bittorrent clients running at the same time I am now getting combined speeds of up to 55 kb/s. Many are at 85% now, hopefully I'll be able to get lots of people up to 100 % by the end of the day, fingers crossed. I just hope people wont hit n run. "
,BeppertjeBep,2009-11-22T17:56Z,"Hurray !!
It's working !!"
,flannybhoy7,2009-12-11T14:47Z,"Please seed people stuck at 81.2% was getting an awsome speed last night, then went to bed and got up and it was stuck."
,flannybhoy7,2009-12-13T21:31Z,Come on helpfuld im still at 81.2%

,djrikstar,2010-06-26T17:05Z,"I've downloaded this but i cant get it to work.. I've tried extracting the rars but it keeps saying corruption or something on the RAR 37..
So i used power iso to extract videos which are in .mov files which even my quicktime wont play them they should??
And when i run the app thing it runs then at menu it says script error and close itself down..
Plus there is no iso to mount..
PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP?? I BEEN TRYING FOR HOURS.."
,sere11,2010-08-31T08:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, I like it!"
,Beepboxx,2010-10-19T12:12Z,"@ dirikstar  I use 7-Zip to extract the files from the .iso file to a new folder. You should see all the files for a DVD, or just open the .exe file that runs the video app. 
Tried using just Quicktime but get blacked out videos. App works fine.
Seed when you can, takes forever to download."
,Beepboxx,2010-10-19T12:20Z,"Thanks, excellent video quality. Also contains .cpr files to work with, worth the long download.
Seed - thanks again"
,Balazar86,2010-10-28T18:20Z,"It works just fine.  I ran it on win7 x64.  Just mount or burn the iso, disconnect from the net and start the program.  It will time out and let you continue without registration.  once you get through that part you can reconnect to the net again."
,gaysexisfun,2010-11-13T21:56Z,"Nice, you don't even need WMP. i was thinking which program i was gonna have to use. i didn't start watching it yet because i don't want to get off the net just yet. i'll do it late tonight when i'm bored. but right now i actually want to work on a song i'm creating."
,suppjunkie,2010-12-15T20:13Z,"So Im only getting audio... but the audio Im getting is in spanish? Can someone help with this please, I used WinRAR to extract the files, I have the latest version with quicktime but I can't get any video and it's in the wrong language.

Thanks for any help"
,suppjunkie,2010-12-18T23:09Z,any1?
,Yezhik,2011-03-27T20:06Z,Please seed :D
,Banksno925,2011-04-28T05:04Z,Great upload. I was having a problem because the quick time I had was newer version. I uninstalled and reinstalled the one on the disc. logged off internet and opened file and it works perfect. Thanks and I will seed for a few days.
,eittt,2011-06-17T17:36Z,"Instead of disconnecting your internet everytime you run the app, you could add this to your hosts file or similar: 127.0.0.1 www.askvideo.com
Of course, you wouldn't be able to browse the site unless you #comment out or remove the line again."
,joofcorn,2011-07-12T00:58Z,Hi..  lttl problem here. How can I get it to work without registering it?
,sorout,2011-08-07T19:54Z,"Anyone knws why am I not able to play these videos???? i get the black sceen, no audio... but the bar keeps on going... anyone?"
,terrentz,2011-12-27T04:56Z,"This is INSANE, hello. What part of ""Spanish"" don't people grasp? After deleting all the files then re downloading the torrent and all from scratch, all the video files are still in Spanish. I don't get it, + someone's already mentioned it but got no answer. Common why is it in Spanish, why don't more mention bout it? Is it really the same files? Thx."
,OGFresh,2012-03-21T01:36Z,Terrentz i'm guessing your the one not grasping. 
,OGFresh,2012-03-21T01:49Z,"@djrikstar use winrar and just extract part 1, the rest should follow suit."
,OGFresh,2012-03-21T18:31Z,"Well... It downloaded just fine, You forgot to mention it can only be run on a screen resolution minimum of 1024x728  sigh. I'll seed for a bit though."
