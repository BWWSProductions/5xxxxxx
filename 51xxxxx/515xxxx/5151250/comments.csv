,jrontherim,2009-11-07T11:19Z,Any chance you plan on uploading seasons four and five?
,dmitrit,2009-11-07T15:30Z,"Maybe down the road a bit because with all due respect I do have other things to do than buy seasons of NNF for other people. But, on the other hand, I do want those seasons for myself chiefly. If I do purchase more NNF I will most likely make a torrent out of them as well. I'm not sure if that helps, but let me say that if people download and seed this torrent it might convince me to purchase the other seasons sooner. (And besides, I figure it's 61 hrs of phenomenal content that has been inaccessible for a couple years, it better satisfy people for a little while anyways, lol)"

,madman359,2009-12-02T12:29Z,Finally! Excellent torrent but that was such a long download. I'm seeding the hell out of this one. Please upload 4 or 5 if you have them!!
,dmitrit,2009-12-02T13:44Z,"Ya, I know, I try to seed 24/7 but I gotta take some breaks every so often and my bandwidth isn't that high... Any seeding is a tremendous help so thanks! I'll see if maybe I can get seasons 4 and 5 up within a few weeks, but again, don't get your hopes up too much."
,noaudio,2010-02-07T04:53Z,seed
,dmitrit,2010-05-16T16:27Z,Season Six up now!
,Tee.Fil,2011-04-10T23:09Z,"Fantastical. I'm considering buying the seasons, but funds are tight. I'll start with season one, and in anticipation download the rest until I can afford it. Thanks for the upload, and I'll seed for as long as I can."
