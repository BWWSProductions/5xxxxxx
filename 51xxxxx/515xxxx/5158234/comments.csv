,antimoron,2011-08-30T19:40Z,"One of the WORST MOVIES I've ever seen. Don't waste 80 minutes of your life and don't even download it ;) I did only because it was listed on 4chan's ""100 GREAT MOVIES"" list, maybe I just got trolled by them this time, because other movies from the list, except for maybe 2-3 were great or at least good so far.
