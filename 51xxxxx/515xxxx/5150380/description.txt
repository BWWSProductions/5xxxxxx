Six albums in, Duncan Sheik deserves credit for shrewdly repositioning a career that could have been relegated to one-hit wonder status. That hitâ€”the ubiquitous '90s mainstay "Barely Breathing"â€”bears little resemblance to anything on Whisper House, an album that sees Sheik continue down the musical theatre path after penning the book to the incredibly successful, Tony-Award winning musical Spring Awakening. In fact, songs from Whisper House will anchor an upcoming musical of same name.

The focused purpose actually benefits the album as a wholeâ€”Whisper House is a cohesive statement, both lyrically and musically. Heavy on atmosphere, the album evokes stark imagery from its collection of macabre, melancholic stories of a haunted lighthouse by the sea. "Secret places, stolen gazes, soft exchanges / All you ever dreamed," Sheik sings on "How It Feels," a lyric that fittingly describes the childlike curiosity that permeates each song.

Two of the album's standout tracks, "Take a Bow" and lead single "Earthbound Starlight," typify the album's strengths: moody, melodic vocals seamlessly set against gorgeous instrumental arrangementsâ€”featuring piano, bells, horns, clarinets, trumpets, cellos, guitars and more. Sheik essentially creates a kind of literary chamber pop. And those vocals are also quietly impressive, especially on "I Don't Believe In You", but he wisely employs singer/pianist Holly Brook to provide back-up vocals (though she takes the lead on the stunning "And Now We Sing"). The two create a harmonious unity not like Damien Rice and Lisa Hanniganâ€”their voices compliment, and indeed enhance, each other's. Even better, the ethereal timbre to Brook's voice fits nicely into the world Sheik's created on Whisper Houseâ€”a world that never escapes the feeling of being a soundtrack to a film or play you haven't seen, but a world that's worth visiting nonetheless.
