This is Dennis the Fox's extremely rare 1975 alt/psych/rock album Mother Trucker, of which only 1000 copies were originally pressed.  I've been searching for this album ever since hearing Piledriver (track 7) on DJ Shadow's Funky Skunk mix and I'm sure I'm not the only one and even though Mr Fox's myspace says it's been reissued on CD I've not been able to find a copy for sale anywhere.  I finally found this version throughit's a recording of the original vinyl so there is a bit of hiss and crackle but overall the quality is pretty good.
I'll seed this for as long as I can but I'm limited in both bandwidth and hard drive space so if you do download this please reseed.
This is a rare gem of an album.
Enjoy!
