,n-t0wn,2009-11-08T16:09Z,"I believe the data steam users preload is just worthless junk for every1 else because on the release date all these 6.7 gigs have to be DECRYPTED by steam. unless you have the decrypt key you are SCREWED.

and even after the release this data will be useless because you still wont have the key.

same goes for all these MW2 releases here on tpb. wait for the scene grp releases. they'll be the only one that actually work. everything else is worthless junk."
,raviraj87,2009-12-11T17:36Z,"I need help :P . I'm using Windows 7(x64). I have ""Left 4 Dead 2 - Razor1911"". But when I run the ""setup.exe"" it gives me the message that ""This version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using....."" .
I think may be this ""setup.exe"" is for 32-bit OS. So can any one upload the setup for 64-bit OS so that I can atleast install the game..... Please!!!!!"
