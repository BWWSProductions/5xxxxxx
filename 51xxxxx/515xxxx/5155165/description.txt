David Baerwald and David Ricketts seemed to appear from thin air in 1987 with their victorious debut titled Boomtown. The album depicts the hopeless struggle of two close friends to overcome their obstacles and reach their goal; which is, complete an artistic work of tender and stirring compositions. Plagued by alcohol and drugs (Swallowed By The Cracks, A Rock For The Forgotten), and bending under the burdens of daily existence (Being Alone Together), David & David delayed their ambitions. Failed relationships also enter the picture: `Ain't So Easy' pits affection against possession, and earthly pleasure temporally cures the trials of survival in `All Alone In The Big City.' The only optimistic cut is the final `Heroes' where David & David vow to bury their past failures, and concentrate on the venture ahead. The result is the majestic Boomtown.

Musically, Boomtown is sensuous and intense. Their ability to create dramatic compositions (Welcome To The Boomtown, River's Gonna Rise, All Alone In The Big City) is superb .These cuts bring to mind the percussive rhythms of Peter Gabriel and the romantic sheen of Roxy Music's Avalon. The CD is produced by Davitt Sigerson who also worked with and The Bangles and Tori Amos. Boomtown is a triumph - the stunning surprise of 1986
