Abnormal Playing For Pussy CD


Scandinavias fastest and funniest punk band. This is their first album. A mix of Nofx, Turbonegro, Black Flag & Rancid.

Having sold over 15000 copies of Playing For Pussy we took a long break to concentrate on drinking beer and talk bullshit. In late 2009 Abnormal reunites. We felt so sorry for all the chicks who have to listen to all that boygayband music so were gonna shake it up! HappyTom from Turbonegro has hailed them as the best punk band in scandinavia
