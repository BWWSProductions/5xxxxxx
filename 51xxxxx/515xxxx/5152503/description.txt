Good Hair (2009)



In the movie SCHOOL DAZE, Spike Lee staged a dance number in

which two bands of African-American college students debated

the merits of "Straight and Nappy" hair in song, and now

comedian Chris Rock and filmmaker Jeff Stilson have extended

the conversation to a full-length film in this witty documentary

with serious undertones. Rock says he was inspired to make the

film when his young daughter asked him, "Daddy, how come I don't

have good hair?" and he and Stilson examine black America's

obsession with their hair. They visit the Bronner Brothers

International Hair Show, an annual trade show for the African-American

haircare industry which includes fierce competitions among stylists

from around the country and demonstrations of new hair products and

techniques. Along the way, Rock also talks to a number of

African-American luminaries about their hair issues (including Maya

Angelou, Reverend Al Sharpton, Nia Long, Raven Symone, Ice-T, and

Paul Mooney), researches the dangers of many common hair-straightening

treatments, reveals the surprising expense of regular hair "relaxing"

and weaves, and ponders what the pursuit of straight hair says about

African-American cultural identity. GOOD HAIR received its world

premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival
