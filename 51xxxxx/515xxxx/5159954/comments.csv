,HamHamHam,2009-11-14T07:01Z,"I was just wondering if you know anything about/ would be able to make the beyond the sword crack work with version 3.19?  I want to play online, but have to update to version 3.19 to play online, which breaks the crack."
,uwcheese,2009-11-14T09:01Z,Haven't tried that one yet
,mars89,2009-11-15T00:38Z,"When I tried to install the first crack it said I didn't have enough free space, even though it's a 52 mb file and I have over 200 gb of free space. Maybe I am downloading to the wrong location, anyways think you know what's going on?"
,mars89,2009-11-15T00:40Z,nvm I'm a dummy. THANKS YOU FOR THE TORRENT!!=)
,mars89,2009-11-15T00:56Z,"when I install the crack I get errors, pretty sure its because i couldn't change unknown to read and write the permissions, could ya help me out?"
,uwcheese,2009-11-15T01:04Z,"Make sure you do Step 7 and free up permissions before applying the crack.

What do you mean by unknown?"
,bankstarr,2009-11-15T16:03Z,"first, wanted to say thanks for your hardwork!

ive just followed all your steps and im not sure if its working properly or not.  when i try to open CIV4 it says to insert the cd, but i can open Beyond the Sword and play it...  not sure if it was intended to work this way or not.  i havent opened warlords yet either.

also, when trying to play, does it matter which expansion you open?  is it gonna be the same game?

thanks for your help!"
,bankstarr,2009-11-15T16:05Z,"UPDATE: warlords gives me the same message, to insert the original CD..  im assuming this was all designed this way by the game devs so that beyond the sword is the only one you open to play since its the newest release?"
,SpudsBM,2009-11-21T01:25Z,uwcheese maybe change the name of the torrent it sounds like you include the games/expansions as well.
,uwcheese,2009-11-21T03:28Z,"Hi bankstarr, installing Beyond the Sword renders the previous two titles unusable.  This was stated in the instructions.

Thanks SpudsBM. Title changed."
,nwood1,2009-11-21T09:18Z,"I did all the steps (especially changing the access to read & write) but whenever the UBCrack runs for both they say error

what do I do?"
,innes2,2009-11-23T03:36Z,"uhh i have the same problem where i try to run update 1 (step 4) to hard drive and it says ""Space is needed"". I have 30 gigs left... WHY"
,innes2,2009-11-23T03:37Z,"but good torrent,, thnx"
,cybae0804,2009-11-26T03:34Z,"ATTENTION!! if u already have WARLORDS INSTALLED, you have to reinstall that game in order to use this crack for warlords. it seems like the original game works w/o reinstall"
,cybae0804,2009-11-26T03:43Z,"ATTENTION!! HOW TO FIX THE ERROR! 

when u see the error message with the list of files, u have to change the setting of those files to read&write for everyone, staff, admin.etc

if there's a lot of files to fix, you can just 
1) go to the app that u are about to patch
2) show package
3) get info on contents folder
4) change the setting to read&write
5) gear button
6) apply on enclosing files
7) try cracking again
IT SHOULD WORK

and for warlords, i had to reinstall"
,brennus17,2009-11-27T22:02Z,"Mars89: How? I'm having the same problem as you.

Two questions: I don't want the big civ4 folder in my applications folder, but I want an application launcher/bundle there... how do I do this?

Also, the problem with Mars: When I get to the first crack (step 4), it says I don't have enough space. This is crap. I have more than enough space, this is obviously a mistake. How to fix it?"
,CalebPoo,2009-12-06T14:39Z,where is the sharing and permission thing .... i cant find it so when i do step 8 and 9 it cant chance it even if i write down my admin pw. gets errors... -.-
,bearcat09,2009-12-15T18:29Z,"i am running snow leopard, when i go to download step 8 it gives me an error- then it lists a bunch of files. any ideas?"
,villiepbay,2009-12-15T21:04Z,"Hey, when i try to install from civ IV cdr (step 1) it says ""Resource temporaily unavaliable"", what to do?"

,lamplover,2010-01-14T20:42Z,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!
,uwcheese,2010-01-21T00:34Z,"It seeems you all are having permissions issues.  MAKE SURE YOU PERFORM STEP 7.  If you get an error, do step 7 again.  It should fix these issues."
,12amstroll,2010-05-04T02:38Z,"I have downloaded and successfully played both Civ 4 and Warlords, but I'm getting the message -- ""no software could be found to update. Press other to locate your software"" -- when I try and install Beyond the Sword. I attempted clicking the Civ 4 icon, but it did not work. Any tips?

Thanks."
,archaeopteryx1,2010-05-11T10:10Z,"did not work from step8 on. Does it not work with Snow Leopard? An extract from error message below. Or have I done smthng stupid?

,SmackSmackPoke,2010-05-19T04:39Z,"Doesn't work for me. I've tried about six torrents of the game and nothing works, although I had the game installed until a few days ago just fine. A crash wiped out my machine, and I can't get Civ IV again. I initially installed it on Leopard, but I'm using 10.6.3 now.

The same errors happen regardless of the torrent I try. I drag the Civilization IV folder from the mounted cdr/dmg, run the CiV IV Update 1 and 2.pkg files and it says ""Installation succesful - updates installed."" But when I try to go to the next step and run the Warlords installer (or even just open Civ IV) it gives me an error message in English, French and German that says ""Please insert the original disc."" I have even used Disk Utility to burn a DVDv of it and it doesn't help. 

Any ideas?

Much thanks for all the efforts!
"
,SmackSmackPoke,2010-05-19T04:55Z,"Oh, and when I run the NoDVD and NoCPU crack, it says ""Check with the developer to make sure Civilization IV NoDVD & NoCPU works with this version of Mac OS X. You may need to reinstall the application. Be sure to install any available updates for this application and Mac OS X."""
,SmackSmackPoke,2010-05-20T14:25Z,"I wish I could delete/edit comments. Don't worry about what I said before. Skipping step 6, I was able to somehow get Civ IV running again, so I can have games just as I used to. No glitches or anything noticed so far.

The only problem is, trying to install Warlords I get a message ""Civilization IV does not appear to be installed correctly. The installation of Civilization IV (located at /Civ4GameFolder) is not valid. Install Civilization IV again to fix this problem.""

Uninstalling the game to try again is the last thing I want to do after all this trouble. Anyone else been able to proceed after a similar message?
"
,poneee,2010-08-01T00:35Z,"wow thanks!!

it's didn't work at first place.
but, after doing what you've said, it worked,esp after doing what {cybae0804} said. it works great!

thanks again
"
,k00shball,2011-02-02T02:52Z,"I've followed each step to the letter, but when I get to step 8 and apply the crack on civ IV executable (the one when you click it says you need to insert a CD), it says ""you cannot apply patch to this file""....Anyone know why? or am i just an idiot and putting the patch on the wrong file?"
,bhavukful,2011-03-18T17:01Z,can i play online with it
