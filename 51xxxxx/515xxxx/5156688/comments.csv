,.dot,2009-11-11T14:30Z,"Ok, inside this torrent is a patch you can execute. If you have the Rzr1911 Steam release you copy these files (if they are RAR files extract them before) to your CoD:MW2 install dir and then u execute the patch, wait till its done and you are all set.

""Release Notes

1. Extract RARs
2. Copy patch to install dir and execute it
3. press patch
4. Have fun!"""

,Hi-5,2011-03-15T18:37Z,"Torrent is checked and is clean.

Scanned with Norton, Kaspersky, Avira, and avast, and tested with Sandboxie. Only Norton detects the patch, which is obviously a false positive. Also the torrent is from a VIP and is here since 2009-11-10. 

Suggestion: besides online scanners also use some decent scanners and Sandboxie. "
