NOTE: The torrent and avi file say *The* History of Christianity, but the official show page on BBC,  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtr8, and various other sources show that the name is actually *A* History of Christianity.

The BBC announced today a major new six-part religious series for BBC Four ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A History Of Christianity.

Presented by Diarmaid MacCulloch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one of the world's leading historians and Professor of History of the Church and Fellow at St Cross College Oxford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A History Of Christianity will reveal the true origins of Christianity and delve into what it means to be a Christian.

Intelligent, thought-provoking and magisterial in its scope the series will reveal how a small Jewish sect that preached humility became the biggest religion in the world.

Most Christian histories start with St Paul's mission to Rome, but Diarmaid MacCulloch argues that the first Christianity stayed much closer to its Middle-Eastern roots.

The series has been commissioned by Janice Hadlow (whilst Controller of BBC Four) and is being made by the BBC's in-house Religion & Ethics team.

Richard Klein, Controller, BBC Four, says: "A History Of Christianity is engaging, stimulating and, above all, informative, offering the ultimate guide to the origins of the biggest religion in the world.

"It also demonstrates the BBC's commitment to offering landmark religious programming."

Executive Producer Jean Claude Bragard adds: "It's a privilege working with Diarmaid MacCulloch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he is the leading international authority in the history of the Church."

The films are produced and directed by Gillian Bancroft and Sian Salt.

A History Of Christianity (6 x 60-mintues) will be shown in autumn 2009 on BBC Four and then repeated on BBC Two.

The series is a BBC co-production with the Open University and Jerusalem Productions.
