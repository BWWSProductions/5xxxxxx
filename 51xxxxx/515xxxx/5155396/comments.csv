If any of you can't get the patcher to work (won't launch), you need to use the patcher from the zip file, as the one which appears in the torrent directly has become 'non-executable' (it had in my case).  Or you can make it executable, whichever you prefer."

,iphonerulez,2009-12-11T04:47Z,Other commenters were right.  It does require a serial number for burning DVDs.  Only the encoding for file conversion works with the patch.  It's back to Popcorn 3 or Toast for the time being.

,lopiko69,2009-12-24T17:38Z,"sorry for precedent comment, the patch does working after 6-7 times....   but its not a fake, its working!!!"
