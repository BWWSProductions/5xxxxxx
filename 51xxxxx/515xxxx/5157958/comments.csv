Btw, did you decide not to continue capturing and uploading CBC's The Nature of Things with David Suzuki?  The show is currently running a three part series on Darwin that looks quite good."
[V],Ekolb,2009-11-12T17:47Z,"Actually I decided not to capture this particular three part series purely because it's more like a drama with actor playing darwin. It was also presented by PBS Nova as well, and it didn't feel like a documentary, but more like a show.  But once  this finishes I will start capturing again. Sorry :("
,Temptation,2009-11-13T14:36Z,"ah, ok. thanks for replying and letting me know.

Actually, the PBS NOVA program on Darwin was a completely separate production.  It was called Darwin's Darkest Hour, and despite it being a docudrama, it was actually quite good, with excellent production values, and quite informative.  I guess you didn't capture it because it was a docudrama rather than the usual documentary?  I would have liked to have a good copy of it to watch again... I think a lot of people would have enjoyed it.

It is a strange coincidence that The Nature of Things decided to do something very similar to the PBS NOVA program, ie., another docudrama on Darwin.  I watched part 1 of it and it is very similar in content to the PBS NOVA one, although as I said, it's a completely separate production with different actors, etc.  Also, being Canadian, it looks a bit cheap compared to the American one, which had excellent actors and had excellent costumes and sets that recreated England at the time of Darwin.  It also had wonderful photography of Darwin's explorations in South America and various islands.

Anyway.. I guess it's up to you whether you decide to capture particular episodes or not.  If you ask me, I found both the PBS NOVA's and CBC's The Nature of Things series quite worthwhile viewing.  The latter also had Richard Dawkins, among other preeminent scientists, commenting on evolution.  So it wasn't just like a feature film or drama.. there was definitely some informational and educational content in both programs.

Anyway.. sorry for going on.. thanks again for doing what you do and uploading and sharing these PBS and other educational content.  It's definitely appreciated.  

cheers."
