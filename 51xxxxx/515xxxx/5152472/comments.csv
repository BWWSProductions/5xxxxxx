,dj_mm,2009-11-10T09:50Z,"Same here! Fully registered, ""never expires"", or in Dutch (for I have chosen Dutch as language) click blue question mark in upper richt corner, choose ""over"" (""about"") and next to all modules the following messages are shown: Ontgrendeld: ""ja"" / verloop tijd: ""verloopt nooit"".

Thx a lot uploader!!! ;)

@ ChattChitto: without a doubt you're one of the very best and trustworthy uppers, but some other uploader can always be a helping hand adding some more value to your releases. Consider it this way :)"

,pflowers,2009-11-15T23:23Z,Works great. Thanks
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2009-11-20T23:53Z,"Thanks. Works fine! Just ""Open"" it, and it automatically opens DVDFab then does the registration job all by itself. I like that!

Notes: It apparently also works OK with later versions of DVDFab such as 6.2.0.5. So it looks like all that's needed is this key. Presumably the software can be downloaded from anywhere reliable, such as the DVDFab website itself."
,fredpc,2009-11-25T20:48Z,Yes this will register the newer version but it will only register as 6.1.2.5 not 6.2.0.5
,ton1164,2009-12-12T03:58Z,thank you for DVDfab 6.1.2.5 key.
