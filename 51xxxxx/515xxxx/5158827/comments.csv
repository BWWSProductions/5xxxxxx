[repeat offenders] and if you keep it up i will remove you totally from the start of seeding.. and you can drop somewhere back in the pack *

good enough for me to provide good enough for you to give to others

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!

it's not there for show....

Thankyou to everyone else and sorry for the message
