The Singles Collection is the second greatest hits album from American singer Britney Spears, in honor of her 10th year anniversary under her contract with Jive Records, her record company since 1997. The release follows her previous greatest hits albums, Greatest Hits: My Prerogative which was released in 2004. The compilation was released in many different formats including a one disc edition and an international deluxe double disc. An Ultimate Fan Box Set edition will be release two weeks after the standard on November 23. The American version includes only one new track titled "3" and the Japanese includes a cover of "It's All in the Game".

"3" was released as a single in September 2009 and became Spears's third number-one song on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.
