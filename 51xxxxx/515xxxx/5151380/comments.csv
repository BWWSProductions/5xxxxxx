,Aztech786,2010-01-17T18:46Z,Whats the difference between this and normal 700 mb
,SlonUA,2010-01-19T20:45Z,"it's not remix.
it's origin distro contain all staff. 
700 mb version is simple distro for CD."

,gnetix,2010-02-23T06:10Z,"Could someone please tell me how to use this disk? I got so far as to install KDE desktop from boot, but I don't know all of the commands. Is this the proper way to use this? And thank you uploader for this disk. Oh, the reason I ask is because I am a total noob to linux and after booting this disk I only get command line screen. No desktop. As I said, I did get to KDE desktop, but it doesn't look like the other desktops that I seen around. Thank you to anyone who will help."
