,Xerxes.669,2009-11-19T14:23Z,"Riiiiiight.  As noted in other comments.  The ?uthor forgot to choose the correct extension and the video doesn't f**king play.  Please change the extension to .m2ts and ""boom"" it works in your PS Three, or in my case, the PC.
If you are using shitty vista, make sure to go into control panel, folders and options, and click show file extensions before you change the end of the file to .m2ts.   Cheers !  "
[T],bricktophd,2009-12-02T23:17Z,Sorry every1 i didnt realize that i erased the ext. when i renamed the file.Just put m2ts at the end it will fix the problem
