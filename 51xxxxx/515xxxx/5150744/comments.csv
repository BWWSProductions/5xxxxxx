Also I can't buy traffic live, but I don't know that is because of the app or navigon...

DO DOWNLOAD! It maybe just is me.."

,banibanan,2009-11-19T23:06Z,"What does the uploader mean by ""original""?

Has he bought the app, and then uploaded it to tpb?

In order to install cracked applications you HAVE to have a jailbroken iPhone.

There are guides.

In cyda, add this source:
http://cydia.hackulo.us

Accept the warning.
Now, in packages, press ""hackulo.us"" and install appsync 3.1

Done!"
