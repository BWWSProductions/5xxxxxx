One of the better known "how to" films of the era, this film focuses on how a woman should undress for her husband. The elegant young woman is Elaine Barry, the then wife of move heart-throb John Barrymore. The other woman, Trixie, is a large, heavyset woman, who is the complete opposite of Elaine Barrymore. The film I saw seems to have been re-cut with scenes films in the late 40s or early 50s, showing a man with a camera, a peeping Tom, or paparazzi photographer climbing on rooftops to get the candid shots of the two celebrities. The premise of the film is to show the right, and wrong way for a woman to undress before going to bed. Elaine is cool and collected and takes care of her clothes once she removes them. Trixie, on the other hand, grunts and huffs and throws her clothes down once removed. A funny film to be sure, and a most definite period piece.

This film is believed to be in the public domain, and can be found on the DVD set called "Sex and Buttered Popcorn."
