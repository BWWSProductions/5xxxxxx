,lamiersi,2009-11-16T21:20Z,"The link by FTL3 does not seem to work. For anyway, for analysis:
arma2.exe MD5 sum : 117979a54089765ac913e40483ab58db

You can search that with hash search : http://www.virustotal.com/buscaHash.html

Which will show Result: 12/41 (29.27%)

Those 12 scanners seems to classify it by heuristic; i.e. none really knows exatcly what Trojan it has, if any.

For the original patched arma2.exe the score is 0/41 (md5 is 4c93c05dc717911c04e9f3ca9f2bfab6 )

By looking at comments from other FTL3 submits, there are lot of such heuristic 'positives', but couldn't spot any mention of real trojan/virus in his submits.

At least it didn't install anything on my VMware sandbox run (in which it almost immediately aborted since no Arma2 installation present)

,lamiersi,2009-11-16T21:27Z,"And a bit more analysis: 
FTL3 scan can be searched with the hash he mentioned:
96c18b2ee5c1292f7c4c6cdafcd84470e329babe6e83dc6d11ad2142191bc14c

From:
http://www.virustotal.com/buscaHash.html

Although his scan shows md5 a4475ca75efde05245cf0134a152b676 for the zip, where I get 46b6db027ee582809154da77ba859206

Could be explained by F-Secure's note about ""File is damaged"" -> perhaps his upload failed

Anyway, probably not a trojan, just some (12) virus checkers getting worried about some heuristics patterns they spot.
