This 6-CD Audiobook of Joe Schreiber's Star Wars: Death Troopers is a pretty damn impressive production, but it's mastered in a puzzling 84-track format when there's only 44 chapters plus an Epilogue.  So I've taken the chapters that were 2 or 3 seperate tracks (in one case, SIX tracks) and edited them together to make a more clear-cut one-chapter-per-track format.  All the tracks are also correctly labeled by Chapter title, taken from the printed hardcover edition.

I also have the original .wav files I used to edit, but I'm probably not gonna be uploading 4gb worth of Audiobook files anytime soon, sorry.
