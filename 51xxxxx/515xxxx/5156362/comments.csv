,Lorddemon,2009-11-13T05:15Z,Seed speeds are slow!!!!!!!
,robrthfx,2009-11-17T00:05Z,"Great upload! ""I"" used this key VCFQD-V9FX9-46WVH-K3CD4-4J3JM maybe the other keys will work but I didn't try. Thanks a bunch!"
,Gregorikos,2009-11-20T08:22Z,"Windows Vista are awful! Windows 7 are like Vista. Windows XP are faster and reliable more than all other Windows versions.
The 64 bit version is 26% faster than 32 bit version in my 64 bit computer with Intel Quad Core 3,4GHz (s775 12MB cache).
Thank you very much about that!!"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-20T09:25Z,"thats so true,, i use xp on my new windows 7 samsung because 7 switches its self off at random intervals without any warning or for any reason and checkdisc runs each time the laptop starts telling me my ""new"" harddrive is faulty when it works just fine,, and you need to wear ear plugs with windows 7 because the fan s constantly running at full speed because 7 needs all of the system resorces just to display the desktop."
,Bagelmagic,2009-11-25T05:42Z,"I've had this version of XP for about two years now and the reason I came across this torrent is because I was looking for a torrent that this user created but is no longer seeding that supposedly upgrades it to 7 x64.

In other words, I would never get this, OS if I had the chance to do it over. Sure, it runs fast, but XP is becoming outdated and people are unwilling to write drivers for it (especially the 64 bit version) these days. I would suggest to anyone wanting to try this to install it on a separate partition because you're going to have tough time finding drivers now, but even more so in the future."
[V],thethingy,2009-11-25T08:24Z,xp is surported by ms for another 5 years!
,coltgcup,2009-12-22T15:03Z,"will this OS be able to download updates?
? thanks"
[V],thethingy,2009-12-31T02:58Z,it updates just fine.
,billa_19,2010-01-09T17:48Z,"I´ve used XP x64 for a couple of years now and haven´t been any problem to get programs working for me. Use Google and you´ll be fine. 

As far as I knew, Microsoft had intentions to stop supporting XP after this year but that was a long time ago they said that. So if they will support XP for another 5 years, thats not just great, it tells me that they more or less thinks that Windows 7 is a little bit of a failure like Vista was.

Someone who agrees or disagrees with me?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-09T20:23Z,"netbooks are still sold with xp, and ms has got to support them for 5 years, there will be security updates for xp for years to come as it still has a 85% market share"
[T],stevekasian,2010-02-08T00:16Z,"Fuck Microsoft. I wish they would release a service pack for XP that actually did something other than plug security holes. How about fixing all the stupid little annoying things that are wrong with it, like the fact that whenever you add a favorite to your favorites list by dragging and dropping, or edit an existing favorite by renaming it or something, it always ends up at the bottom of the list when you go back to it? WTF?? It's been that way for 3 generations of fucking XP!

And how about adding a feature that lets you TURN OFF the goddamn Information Bar for ActiveX notifications?? Billions of people complaining about that.

How about fixing the Files & Settings Transfer Wizard so that it imports not only the links and favorites themselves, but also the registry keys that designate the sorting order in which they appear? Why the fuck do I always have to export and import registry hives to get the job done??

And what about the biggest, most annoying blunder of all: Make a goddamn IE6 Skin for IE7 & 8!! WTF is wrong with these motherfuckers?? So many people out there want their IE to look and work the same as it always has, for fucking decades. And nobody as MS will allow it. It's like they get off on FORCING themselves and their preferences on the world. Wait a minute... what am I saying? Of course they get of on that. They've always gotten off on that.

And why dont they....  oh shit, I could go on forever. I give up.

Microsoft: FIX YOUR SHIT!"

,brendanspurious666,2010-03-29T11:31Z,how do i make a bootable dvd out of this?? its is not working.
[V],thethingy,2010-03-31T18:40Z,"^^ there is a iso burning tool in the download to make it bootable, just open active iso, select the xpiso, click burn. the other torrent has a key installed that is now not genuine, this torrent has a list of keys for you and a key changer."
,Jedor,2010-04-02T01:41Z,"Thanx for this.

What's ""WindowsServer2003.WindowsXP-KB914961-SP2-x64-ENU""? What is it for?"
,Jedor,2010-04-02T22:21Z,"Okay never mind. It's Service Pack 2 of course but who cares? This is SHIT! First of all it refuses to format the disc before installing. Secondly it won't install the following files: cmnicfg.xml, ipcfg.xml, osinfo.xml, potscfg.xml, pppcfg.xml - resulting in a completely unstable OS refusing to upgrade to SP2 and also refusing to install an antivirus-prg. PIECE OF SHIT!!! I hope it hasn't damaged my PC further. Thanx a lot!"
[V],thethingy,2010-04-06T19:15Z,"Jedor, piss off back under your rock you little fool, you havent burned the dvd properly thats why files havent installed you little troll"
