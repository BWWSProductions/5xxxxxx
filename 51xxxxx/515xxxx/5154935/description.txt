However, his plans seem to be thwarted every step of the way. Quinn has taken a renewed interest in Dexter's nightlife.

She decides to concentrate on her pursuit of the Trinity Killer as well as delving into her father's checkered past - investigations which Dexter fears might lead her to danger - or worse, the truth.
