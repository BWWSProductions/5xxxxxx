SolSuite 2009 includes the Ribbon, a graphical user interface composed of a strip across the top of the main playing area. Ribbon interface is a part of the new Microsoft Fluent User Interface that replaces the menus and toolbars used since the version 2008 of SolSuite.
The Ribbon is a way to enhance usability by consolidating related commands so that they are easier to find. Commands are organized into groups and related groups are organized on tabs. One need not look through multiple levels of hierarchical menus.
