Proloquo2go is a TTS (Text to Speech) application for the iPhone/iPod Touch. You basically type it, and it speaks for you, in case of a situation where your tongue stops working or something stupid like that. Other than that, it's basically useless! (Other than to impress your friends with your shitty app!)
