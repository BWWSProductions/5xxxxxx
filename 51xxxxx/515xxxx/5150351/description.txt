One of the most anticipated films in these parts for about a year now, Pavel Ruminov's Dead Daughters has shown a remarkable ability to divide audiences.
Those who like it like it a lot while those who don't generally despise it... Why the split?
While the film has some definite weaknesses it seems likely, from the sheer vehemence of its detractors, that a good degree of the backlash comes from stymied expectations. Ruminov is a director who frequently name checks Sergei Eisenstein and Kiyoshi Kurosawa in conversation and that latter influence very definitely shows in his own work so that segment of the audience coming to the film looking for an American style teen splatter fest very definitely departed disappointed. Dead Daughters is far more arthouse than grindhouseâ€¦

Dead Daughters is a stunning film on a technical level. Ruminov has an incredible eye and clearly loves the post-industrial landscapes of suburban Moscow. He shoots his adopted home - he is originally from the country's far eastern coastal city of Vladivostok - with an eye that captures the beauty of decay, employing a heavy color filters throughout and very often shooting at night with only natural light sources. The film simply looks gorgeous. And as good as it looks it sounds even better. The sound design took months to complete and it shows. Audio is likely the most important factor in establishing mood in film and Ruminov very clearly understands that using audio effects and music to build tension, establish his environments and - frequently -convey information to his audience without having to place explicit images on the screen. What you feel is often more effective than what you see and Ruminov plays that card exceptionally well without playing the low end cheat of simply ramping up the volume to make people jump. Technical skill, however, is pointless without an active imagination and a wealth of ideas to back it up and Ruminov has both of these as well. The central premise is solid and the film is littered with impressive set pieces spiced with a mordant sense of humor.
