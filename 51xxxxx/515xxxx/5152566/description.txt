This one-off creation of the Blackadder team was made for the turn of the millennium and includes all those people who have had recurring appearances in other Blackadder series including Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and Miranda Richardson. 

The plot is basic with Blackadder and Baldrick building a fake time machine so they can win a bet, only to find that it actually works. It is unfortunate but you just get the feel from this film that the team were not at there best when they made it, some of the jokes fall a bit flat and some of the performances are ropey at best. There are some good jokes scattered throughout the piece but I just couldn't get off the feeling that this was an opportunity wasted. 


Enjoy and Seed!!
