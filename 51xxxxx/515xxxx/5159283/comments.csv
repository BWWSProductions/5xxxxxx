Sorry about the poor seed rate but I am having difficulty with the delibrate attack on the Bit torrent trackers mostly by Warner Bros studio's which is targeting legal uploads and they should be taken to task for breaking the law themselves.   I will not be seeding any more until this deliberate Denial of Service attack is ended in the courts."
