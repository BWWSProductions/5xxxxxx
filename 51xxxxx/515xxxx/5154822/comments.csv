,benotdes,2009-11-13T05:00Z,"I've downloaded the program but it asks for a license key. Anyone has a valid license key or a way to crack this software?

Thanks!"

,benotdes,2009-11-14T01:31Z,"Hi rustyrivers. You can use Stuffit to unstuff the archive as for the files I opened them with disk utility and Toast Titanium. Still, you will need a license key to activate the software..."
