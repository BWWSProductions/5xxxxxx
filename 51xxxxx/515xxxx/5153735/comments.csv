,Shufei,2010-09-21T03:08Z,"It should be noted that this is the old British cut of MĂÂ¤dchen in Uniform (1931), from the Janus Films collection.  (They are the chaps who brought us I, Claudius.)  This is the original version of MiU, starring Dorothea Wieck as the delightfully dominant Fraulein von Bernburg and Hertha Thiele as the cherubic Manuela von Meinhardis.  Made in the Gotterdammerung days before Hitler's rise, this film was the first to feature an all-female cast and was innovative on several artistic fronts as well as thematically.  It's reguarded as a classic bit of lesbian art, a celebration of adolescent emergent eros and protest against conformity.  (For which, good tzuhalem, please tag this with ""lesbian+interest"", if you would be so kind.)"
,Shufei,2010-09-21T03:09Z,"The condition of this Janus edition is jolly poor compared to the newer edition, partially restored, which may easily be found on Yo*t*be.  Certain scenes have been stitched back together with an even more jagged continuity.  (Especially regrettable is the final heartbreaking duet between v.B and M.)  The audio is indeed problematic, rather gritty and flat.  But these issues are all with the reel copies; the British version is just that poor.  Yet it's sad that even the best copy lacks certain scenes; this is what we have handed down to us...  Watch this here and on Yo*t*be to compare.  Never fear, however: the famous KISS is still there in all its luminous sensuality...  ;)  Great thanks to tzuhalem for bringing this underappreciated gem to TPB."
