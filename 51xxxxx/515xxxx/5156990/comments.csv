Not working on Windows 7. (missing .dll)
Don't bother getting it in such case."

thx for the upload"
,yo236,2012-02-13T04:08Z,"after downloading ,first of all scan the folder for viruses  . extract(unzip) the file that is displayed as daemon tools image using right click(its actually a zipped file, but shown as image file), to any folder of ur choice ,then click on the game launching app.then its ready to play,only afterclicking on OK in the game window.  very good game with good experience of racing and crashing.
