My Cousin, The Emperor is the latest endeavor from prolific Brooklyn-based via North Carolina singer-songwriter Jason Reischel. The quartet self-released their debut album A Long Way From Home on October 20th, 2009.

Following two national tours and two albums as a solo artist, Reischel has re-imagined his sound, bringing together a taut ensemble of fine young musicians. Previously known as The Populists, over the past year, My Cousin, The Emperor has brought their self-described brand of "irony-free parlor music" to venues all over NYC.
