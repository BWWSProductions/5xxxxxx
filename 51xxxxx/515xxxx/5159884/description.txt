This torrent contains two archives, both CONTAIN THE SAME ISO file. One of them is self-extractable(no additional software needed). It's the one with .exe extension. The other one requires you to have a zip-extracting software. Just choose one of the files.



DVD Disc ID Utility for PS2 | CD to DVD | patched with ESR
-----------------------------------------------------------

This software is used for reading PlayStation2 game disc's ID(DNAS).

It comes as a data CD ISO, but I have converted this one to a DVD, and patched for use with ESR, so it pretends to be DVD Video now.

Uncompress/unpack, then just burn the ISO using any software like ImgBurn on a DVD-R(recommended for PS2)/DVD+R/DVD-RW/DVD+RW.

Insert the DVD into an ESR-enabled PlayStation2 console, wait until it loads, then swap it with your game disc and press X. It will show the game's ID, so you can write it down.

I did not write this software.
