,Crystalmyst,2009-11-18T16:13Z,"This show's gone on for so long, because many people think it's a decent show. As do I. Although there are a few short comings (Lipsyncing for example), the show is quite reputable. If you don't like it, no need to question it's popularity. There are others who are vastly different to you in this world :)"
