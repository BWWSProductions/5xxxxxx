,Libava,2009-11-12T19:06Z,"Download's fast - amaizing! - Thanks!! 
I wish we could have all your movies downloaded with this speed ;) - is it possible?
for example, I'm trying Resident Evil - and it's ""crawling 4 days in a row for me.... only 1 seeder has 94%, no one with a 100% and seeding :(((((
Fachman, when are you moving to a better internet, eh?.... need financial help with that?.....LOL!!!
As for the Quality, I haven't watched the whole thing yet, just jumped through - seems fine to me, so don't bother listening to a$$holes :-)))))
.
Anyway, please resume Resident Evil, will ya?!"
,Libava,2009-11-12T19:10Z,"yadam2001: of coarse it's not ""real"" HD, look at the size!.... now compare to a ""regular"" DVD quality with such compression.... get it?? - so don't swear for nothing , you bugger ;~))
Peace!>>"
,yadam2001,2009-11-13T18:13Z,this movie don't belong here u dumbass !
,Libava,2009-11-14T04:46Z,"eat shit.... from your own arse.... and then dog's, cat's, horse's, cow's..... you monkey's blurp.... and then get screwed by a sick dick...."
,yadam2001,2009-11-15T12:57Z,"Libava, shut the fuck up u stupid mother fucker!"
[T],fachman,2009-11-16T00:52Z,"yadam2001: The section says, high res movies. So according to you 1280x528 is not real HD, well maybe someday you will be able to set standards, but so far others decided for you and me that this resolution is HD, so I am afraid you are just showing everybody how rude and uneducated man you are...
Libava: dont go to his level, you just encourage him."
,yadam2001,2009-11-16T14:20Z,"i'm not saying the resolution is not ok but the quality is not ok, compared to other version on tpb, never mind sorry about that!"
[T],fachman,2009-11-16T18:47Z,"yadam: you certainly have right to have your opinion for the quality, but you should to express it in more understandable and polite version. I do not know how the others look like, but I do know how the 1080p original looks like and I would not miss it when i will delete it. After all you will not find anything even close to this quality with this file size."
,yadam2001,2009-11-17T08:48Z,"exactly, the file size make the quality less good."
[T],fachman,2009-11-17T16:33Z,"yadam2001: 90% of quality at 10% of size, not a bad deal, dont you think??? You would prefer 93% at 20% or 95% at 30%???"
,sreegesh,2009-11-27T13:17Z,"fast download speed,amazing pic quality,best resolution,best 6 channel audio sound ,thanks for this upload"
,HD-LOVER,2009-11-29T01:45Z,"Thanks for all the effort fachman, i wonder if you have in plans to make Rome from bluray?"
,Barroquecore,2009-12-02T10:23Z,Awesome. Don't mind any of the trolls.
[T],fachman,2009-12-03T23:30Z,"Thank you very much for your opinions those good and those bad. It is certainly lossy compression so it is completely ok that some people see artifacts.  My goal in 720p is to provide the highest possible quality at the given bitrate, not quality at all costs. What differs me from many others is that i am using my own modded version of x264 and what you will receive is probably the best you could find, but i am continuously improving my method, so if you are unsatisfied with the FASM17 performance you can find FASM18 version under name:
Terminator 4 Salvation DC 2009 FASM 720p BRRip x264-MEDiC

If anyone is interested whats the difference you can visit this site

My current project is in 1080p area. Its goal is to provide BETTER quality than the BluRay Source at 2-3GB !!!! This is something noone has ever tried before so I guess I will be the first :)
I believe this will shut the mouth of every skeptic over there or open it very wide ;-)

I need your opinion on this. What would you prefer? Small size 720p or super duper 1080p?"
,cititechno,2009-12-06T00:19Z,"Thanks For All The The Hard Work fachman 
i downloaded all the 3 matrix and 3 terminators but already downloaded salvation

,sg3707,2009-12-09T03:53Z,"Hi Fachman....
Thanks for your great uploads. Please don't get disappointed with some peoples harsh comments. You are attempting what no one else has done or properly understand. 

My suggestion is that what ever you upload(720p or 1080p) do it on a regular basis so that people can follow your torrents. I am sure quality would be great on them"
,BiT_ByTeR,2009-12-23T12:36Z,"This is not HD.

""I am being the target for many angry TROLLS""

You seriously wonder why?

Your wasting peoples time."
,jakemo40,2010-01-04T20:28Z,"If u don't like the Quality go out and buy it, your getting it free so shut up!!!


Great seed!!! thanks!!!"
,GreyHaven1,2010-06-06T23:52Z,"I fucking hate stupid ass people that are so goddamn ungrateful. If you want it in true HD buy the fucking movie, retards. Otherwise, deal with 90% quility for free. Fucking Trolls..."
,Odenothus,2010-07-13T04:49Z,Thanks for the hard work Fachman. Great Upload and a Great Movie. Keep it Up.nnNothus
