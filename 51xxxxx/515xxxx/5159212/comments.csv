absolutely crap review by someone who didn't get the move and can't write"

I'd recommend this torrent over the 720p or 1080p moviesbyrizzo torrents of Reds. I didn't download much of the 1080p one (however it doesn't seem to be as good as the 720p version) but even though this is a 480p encode it looks better on my 51"" TV than the moviesbyrizzo 720p version as it's nowhere near as blocky."

A 9/10
V 7.5/10 

An extra few hundred MBs per DVD probably wouldn't have gone astray, but it's still quite watchable, and I guess given it was uploaded in 2009 when 700MB rips were still fashionable....."
