This recording of the Mozart violin concertos is quite simply the best available. Although these pieces have been recorded many times, Mozart comes alive in this rendering by Perman and Levine in a way rarely,if ever, matched. By way of comparison, one may think of the earlier readings of Stern, Szeryng, and Oistrakh. The last mentioned are, in their own right, outstanding and will always remain within the repertoire. However, there is a suave and grace about Perlman's performance that sets it apart, not to mention the beautifully recorded sound by DG. Get it!


Enjoy and Seed!!
