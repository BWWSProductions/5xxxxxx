,jay_haych,2009-11-13T14:55Z,FAKE!! Its Disneys Cinderella
,jay_haych,2009-11-17T18:16Z,i take it back. dont know what happened before. i downloaded half of it and tried to check the quality and it really was cinderella. saw that people were still downloading so i tried again. at 100% it was rifftrax titanic. sorry all. 
,Zerp271,2009-12-06T16:55Z,@Jay_haych: What the fuck?
,captainronito,2009-12-06T22:09Z,"Yes it is the real movie with rifftrax added.

It is the best sounding ever!

You always clearly hear the dialogue,
 and the riff track isn't too loud. 

Actually, the dialogue audio actually slightly quiets a bit when riffing happens.

Truly terrific work!

I would love to know what software was used to put this together.   If the creator ever reads this I hope he posts a reply.

Great work!  Thank you!

,captainronito,2009-12-24T12:51Z,"That's 3 silly Americans.

Thank you"
,meow_is_meowing,2009-12-25T19:07Z,how's a: & v: ?
,ibraholli,2010-01-02T00:02Z,i love when people get upset that they didnt get the movie they wanted with out the RIFFTRAX audio. They should be ashamed of them selves for wanting the origanal. all the movies they riff ARE HORIBLE to begin with and thats why their riffed. Word to the wise if it says rifftax it means it is being made fun of dumb asses!!! I love the ms3k guys and hope they never stop riffing movies that need to be riffed!!!
,marxm,2010-01-07T09:44Z,I agree with you ibraholli but what I find much funnier is that some guy actually went through the trouble to find and download Titanic and watch it as a serious movie.
,1argonaught,2010-01-18T18:31Z,"Ha Ha Ha!!! 
  marxm and ibraholli both of you seem to be AmErIcAn,  and like I said full of the OTT. 
 What are you both looking for searching hear if you dont like this movie?. Oh yeah captainronito, thats three silly americans. LOL."
,captainronito,2010-01-23T23:21Z,"1argonaught

We are looking for Rifftrax-ed movies.  

NOT the original versions.

Rifftrax-ed movies have Rifftrax commentary as you have discovered 1argonaught.

These are movies happen to either be bad,
or at least sensational in some way.  
Movies that are fun to make fun of.

We don't really want to see Titanic necessarily. We mostly want to see it be made fun of.
Our goal is just for some good old American/Aglophone sacarcasm. 
A type of humour non-Aglophones famously  have trouble understanding.

Two of the three Riffers, Mike and Kevin, have been doing it for 20 years.  (I suddenly feel very old) They have many, many, fans.

But this is all just the boring stuff. 

YOU 1argonaught really wanted to see Tatanic? 

Really?

That's funnier more ways than one.

,Paivan,2010-01-28T22:17Z,"So what kind of person sees ""Rifftrax"" before the movie in the name of the torrent and doesn't even begin to wonder what it means? 

It's not like it comes after the movie name, or even only in the description, ITS BEFORE THE NAME OF THE MOVIE."
[T],Skymocker,2010-07-20T05:47Z,"I never thought I'd watch titanic again, but this is some especially good work by kevin, mike, and bill.

don't forget to donate to rifftrax!!"
,murdkipz,2010-09-12T15:45Z,"Thanks for posting this.


On a side note, how fucking retarded was that ""1argonaught"" person? They made a mistake and then started throwing around racist remarks to cover up their own stupidity? It's just sad that there are people out there like that"
,tizzleh,2010-11-16T07:15Z,This is one of the funniest Rifftrax I've seen. Very good. Audio is good as well. Thanks for the U/L
,truemonkeylord,2011-06-17T20:10Z,"captainronito

It's anglophone and you didn't need to seperate and actually the amerians are more famous for not understanding sarcasm or dry humour then anyone else. "
,R0tten,2012-05-10T02:53Z,"Lol, you know you fucking fail at life when you don't know what ""Rifftrax"", ""MST3K"", and/or ""Cinematic Titanic"" mean before you start downloading something, and then you come back in the comments, bitching about how you couldn't enjoy the movie because ""there were people who wouldn't stop talking"" in it.

It's always fun finding these sheltered idiots. There's always at least one on each download.

Anyway, thanks for the download, bro!"
