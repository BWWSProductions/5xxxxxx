From IMDB: A satire on America's very own drive of a world changer: One year after world war ii, Captain Fisby is sent to the village Tobiki in Okinawa to teach the people democracy. First step is to build a school - but the witty folks know what they really want. They tell him about their culture and traditions - and persuade him to build something they really want: a teahouse. Fisby has a hard time to break this to his superiors

Starring:  Marlon Brando, Glenn Ford, and that guy who played Col. Potter on M.A.S.H.

Source was a DVD and not VHS.
