this is the best site for torrents but this sorta shit really makes it slip ya know.."
,arkie3,2009-11-12T19:19Z,"is it pal or ntsc or RF
and does anyone know the password?"
,AndyBaines,2009-11-12T19:28Z,"Seriously guys..?

All the info on this torrent will explain both your questions...

GAME NAME: Tornado Outbreak
...and the region info in the title and info being different would suggest to me this info is a mistake and is for another upload.

PASSWORD: www.X360SOS.com
Would suggest to me the password is ""www.X360SOS.com"" and due to the release being tagged by them too I would assume that this information is still relavent.

I don't comment often other than ""Thank you"" but this just really bugged me, sorry.

Thank you though Markuf for the up."
,arkie3,2009-11-12T19:39Z,"the torrent says its hasbro family game night not torn
ado out break and the password is not www.x360sos.com"
,cncfrost,2009-11-12T19:56Z,We need the password. It is not www.X360SOS.com
,cncfrost,2009-11-13T04:24Z,Really?! A Password needed? WTF Markuf!
,cncfrost,2009-11-15T22:45Z,@AndyBaines..did you figure out the password? Have you played the game yet? I don't comment often other than a fuck off and mind your own business. You should talk shit about things you don't know. 6-7 gigs is a lot to commit to download without being able to use it.
,matiiferxp,2009-11-20T22:44Z,"i just wanned to confirm that the password is:

www.360SOS.com

,DJR0D,2011-02-20T08:40Z,How many can confirm that this is the REAL Hasbro Family Night. It says disclauncher.exe in the abx with no achievements when the game DOES have them. Doesnt say Hasbro anywhere. Can someone confirm???
,DJR0D,2011-02-20T12:16Z,Torrent works and all.  But no pic comes up when u put it into the xbox...says play game with no pic. So it wont let u install the game to ur harddrive to play. Lame. All my games are installed to the HDD. So i guess that was why there was no verification of the name of the game in abgx.
