Greetings to pags 2, demonoid and other torrent sites hiding this little gem!


Please notice that the ISRC codes in .CUE sheet are invalid and makes EAC puke.
Search and replace the ISRC codes to "HU ..." or something, instead of "H2 ..."
(First two must be a country code)

Also the filenames are a bit messy, but the sound quality is excellent.
