,Golfe,2009-11-22T20:53Z,Will this fit every languages in the car? Have a norwegian car and dont want to upgrade the software to another language... Any major difference from recent version in the software or is it only a map update?  
,Golfe,2009-11-27T09:09Z,"Downloaded it, tried it, does not work..
Burned it with Poweriso 4.6, Nero max speed and Nero 2.4x. 
None of them works.. Its a .nrg file wich is a Nero format but I get ""error reading disk"" in my car. (CR-V 2007 currently running ver. 3.23, downloaded from PB)
Anyone got this working?"
,Golfe,2009-12-01T15:05Z,"Strange, there have been several downloaders, but still no comments. 
Has anybody manage to get this working?"

Burned it with Poweriso 4.6,  2.4x on Verbatim DL DVD+R

Same for me disk burnt successfully but Navi won't read it."
,Golfe,2010-01-07T19:58Z,"The DVD label is wrong. Should be like APN2_69105 or something.
Managed to update the software in the car but navi cant fint the dvd. Now i cant use the old dvd either so I have no navi anymore. Thanks!
Upload real image with original label, not ""east.nrg"" or what it was."
,windstar1,2010-01-07T22:05Z,"Not a problem to get back to the old version.
Insert the disc don't bother with the error.
Press and hold ""Menu"" ""Map/Guide"" and ""Cancel"" together until You hear a beep.
You are now in the dignostic Menu. Be carefull with the buttons if You don't know what You are doing!!!
Then press ""Version"" on the touchscreen and then ""download"" Wait until the operation is terminated (few minutes) Navi will reboot and You are back to Your old software"
,Golfe,2010-01-07T23:06Z,Thank you for your tip! Will try that tomorrow! Really hope it works..

You saved my day. I'm back to version 3.23, but at least it is working.

Do you know if there is any difference between 3.23 and this (non-working) 3.31 version exept from the maps? Speed camera, etc? New functions?"
,windstar1,2010-01-08T11:56Z,"I don't know what is new apart the updated maps and POIs but Speedcamereas are not in.
In the meantime Ver. 3.33 and even 3.40 are out"
,Golfe,2010-01-08T14:30Z,"Ok. Thank you for the info. Let's hope someone will share the new releases with us, then.. :-)"
,windstar1,2010-01-14T10:49Z,Seems like with version 3.31 Honda introduced a copy protection checking if the DVD was burnt or pressed. If it was burnt You will get the read error after loading the disc. So 3.23 is the last working version actually
,Poldo_xxx,2011-06-23T23:34Z,"don't work, burned with IMGburn"
