,dinosnore,2011-01-05T07:03Z,FYI This is a scuba-DIVING risk awareness DVD...not risk awareness in the work place or corporate body.
[T],scuba-doo,2011-08-28T22:23Z,"acctually it is general risk awareness but made by SSI (scuba school international)...no spceifi to diving. During the SSI OWcourse, if you are mother toung eglish (by standards) you need to watch it...

but tbh it is the dumbest thing i have ever seen, but it saves SSI from americans taking them to court because of some stupid shit."
