 Quality wise both video and audio look and sound really decent, definitely the best copy around so far.

Two crew members are stranded on a spacecraft and quickly â€“ and horrifically â€“ realize they are not alone. Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. Itâ€™s pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They canâ€™t remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraftâ€™s shocking, deadly secrets are revealedâ€¦and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.
