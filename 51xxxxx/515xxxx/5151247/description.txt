:
The story of Divinity 2: Ego Draconis takes place in Rivellon, a magical and 
timeless world populated by humans and fantastic creatures. Once beautiful, 
Rivellon is now shattered by the apocalyptic wars of the past. The war seemed to 
be over, but the peace was deceptive.

Players begin as a Dragon Slayer, hunters who travel the countryside, determined 
to rid their lands of dragons.
