,Zakafein,2009-11-07T13:37Z,oh and thanks chatbars :)
[T],chatbars,2009-11-07T14:10Z,"Ok setup does not seem to be deleting compressed files after installation (funny, it was working fine before i uploaded it). After installation just go to data\Win32\packed and delete all .tptb files.. The current folder should then be 5.8gb in size.."
,Zakafein,2009-11-12T12:49Z,hey dude seed plz.. i don't usually say this for slow dl speed but everyone is stuck at 45%....

,Filmkonyn,2009-11-12T22:58Z,he keeps asking to place original cd... any answers??
,Chiva$,2009-12-01T12:46Z,"first of all thanks to TPTB for the realease of another great game!

about the releases of this game, last spring the german version was released in germany, at 3 november the first english version was released in australia and at 5 January of 2010 it will be released again worldwide...

on to this torrent, the latest release had the wide problem of the neverending loading screen (at game start and further on to the game, dua do as it seems random anti-piracy implemented cd-checks), and no fix has been found yet...
has anyone playing this rip stumbled upon the bad loading screen?"

,risakczex,2010-01-26T23:37Z,hi please can u help me chatbars i have winxp but when i run setup.exe select my folder and press (i) for install it copy but i took screen shoot and it says Freeman_1.tptb-Freeman_7.tptb but i have all this files and when it install it create folder named tptb and this folder have like 20.7mb why? thanks for reply
,GabE48,2010-03-10T19:22Z,hi for me the setup.bat cant extract the game :( pls help
,Neversin,2011-01-22T04:48Z,"The setup isn't extracting the game. You'll see the file load up the word ""FREEMAN"" slowly top to bottom, and then it flashes info for a quick sec and does it again (7x for the 7 .tptb files). Afterwards it'll say ""Sweet!"" etc. as if the installation was finished. Game Directory is a whopping 21.5MB.
I've extracted the original download with Winrar, 7-zip, and Freearc with the same results, also forced the torrent to re-check files. No success... any Solution?"
