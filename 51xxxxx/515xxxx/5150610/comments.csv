,Quantum12,2010-03-04T18:52Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."
,Infinitee44,2010-03-24T10:47Z,"Quantum, great post. Very fit for the times.

However, you picked the wrong thread to post in.

In fact, this isn't even a forum.

Blasting people with info at random when they're not looking for a change of perspective will do more harm than good.
You can only offer information, you cannot force it down peoples throats through the commentary section of a windows 7 ebook.

P.S. Thanks for the upload, malestrom.

Knowledge of the most uptodate GUI is power in this age.
Just a shame microsofts got such a strangehold on the industry when there are much better and free OS's out there that no one could be bothered to learn to use.

All ahead on opensource operating systems.

~Thanks again."

,liberaltrash,2010-04-07T00:39Z,"Quantum12 you are a fucking moron!
Using YOUR logic, I will wait for YOU to develop all of the greatest applications, then uses at my free will FOR free. I will smoke your weed for free, screw your old lady for free, and eat all of your food and drink your booze for free.
Why? BECAUSE WE DO NOT COMPETE!!!111
What is YOURS is MINE - it is EVERYONE'S!!!

Fuck you are stupid! Capitalism MAKES the competitive edge a benefit for all. If you do not want to work hard and ADD your talents and sweat to the ""Village"", then you can sit on your fat ass o0ut in the cold and starve!

,Sirbaba,2010-04-30T06:06Z,"i agree with liberal trash. whilst mankind is sinful (aka not perfect) we cannot possibly have a system larger than a small village in Asia or Africa. people start sub cumming to sloth and the hard workers pay for it, capitalism causes the unmotivated to work competitively. and besides you have to think, if every man was given a fair share of money and resources EVERYONE would be poor. sadly the poorer peoples make up the majority of the population, and like with seasons (without winter there is no summer) there cannot be happiness without sadness. I'm sorry, but the idea of communism working in a large scale population is very naive, it is just the way this world works."
,SSHunter,2010-05-05T03:45Z,"The comments toward politics are completely unnecessary in these comments, but since there was such ignorance spread, I though that I would put out my two cents. Capitalism is, and will always be a very corrupt government. People make money only at the expense of others. Communism is a failed government, people will never be motivated on a large scale to provide more work for the same pay. Socialism is the only true and pure government, of course you will need extensive anti-corruption measures, but it works much better for everyone. Instead of corrupted and mass controlled banking, insurance, and health-care, people will be able to choose the career they want and get paid dependently on how hard and/or the amount of education required for their department. 
Thanks for your time,
Hunter"

,MangyCheshire,2010-06-20T06:41Z,"Ok.. ok.. wait a second. Liberaltrash, do you realise you are the world's biggest hypocrite and loudmouth? You bitch about people stealing and liberals and them socialist commies on.. the pirate bay. Ok, let's take a step back here and analyse this. You are here to pirate. You wouldn't have found this page unless somewhere in your search terms you put ""Windows 7"". Hence you yourself are stealing someone else's hard produced material. I'm sorry to use a 4chanism but.. lolwut? Also, I suggest you look up the term dualism. You suffer from it badly. Everyone is someone else's enemy, you good little sheeple you."

By downloading here you have already lost the moral highground you aspire to

,derpnhurp,2010-12-22T12:35Z,"Unfortunately,  not the disclosing of source code I had hoped.  Nothing in this but the brochure reading found on the box,  with some fluff.

I appreciate the torrent regardless,  and will share it with whomever I think might need to understand the incredibly basic.  

To paraphrase the book:[...  How to change your desktop background,..... How to turn on backup and system restore ...]

Disappointed in the content but appreciative nonetheless.  Thanks malestrom_HH"

,Galahad56,2011-02-13T12:39Z,"@Quantum

Yeah communism works really great man, just look at all the successful countries in the world that are communist - America, UK, Australia, New Zealand...hang on...

Actually dude Capitalism IS healthy like many have posted in response to your post. Capitalism rewards the hard working people who are bothered enough to get themselves into a career path that will earn them a comfortable living. Not to mention how the west has long had free access to information. China is only realizing now and adapting towards a capitalist society now. - Just you watch.

All those developing countries are elevating themselves from poverty because they are adapting towards capitalist/democratic ideologies.
