1. Go to your ""My Documents""
2. Find a folder called ""My Games"" 
3. Make your way through Folders in ""Borderlands""
   folder until you reach ""Config"" folder.
4. Open up ""WillowEngine""
5. Scroll to the bottom line in the file and add semicolons
   in front of the entries like below or just copy and
   replace:

[FullScreenMovie]
StartupMovies=2K_logo
StartupMovies=Gearbox_logo
StartupMovies=NVidia
StartupMovies=Loading
SkippableMovies=2K_logo
SkippableMovies=Gearbox_logo
SkippableMovies=Attract
SkippableMovies=NVidia

with:

[FullScreenMovie]
;StartupMovies=2K_logo
;StartupMovies=Gearbox_logo
;StartupMovies=NVidia
;StartupMovies=Loading
;SkippableMovies=2K_logo
