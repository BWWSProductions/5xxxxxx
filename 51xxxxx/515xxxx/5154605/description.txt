Works great with Tiger - not sure about Leopard. Make a bootable cd copy of this using Disk Utility (Burn).

NOTE: If DiskWarrior has been installed onto your hard drive, you will not be able to do repairs with it from a disc or another drive. You must search the drive you want to do repairs on and delete any preference files regarding Alsoft or DiskWarrior.

WARNING: DO NOT USE this version to use on 10.3 or earlier - it will render your operating system useless.
