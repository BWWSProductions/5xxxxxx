James May continues his quest to show what is possible with old-fashioned toys by using them on a scale never seen before. James joins forces with Edwina Currie to build a full-size bridge from nothing but Meccano. Top engineers pitch incredible designs, but the project soon careers out of control when the Meccano does not arrive and James realises the structure will take longer to build than he imagined. A last-minute accident also means that James's bridge may never see the light of day.
