,Vader--,2009-11-13T19:46Z,Please deposit your password shite elsewhere. Markuf- your supposed to know better!
,Bonez86,2009-11-13T20:03Z,the pass is probably www.x360.com like all the x360.com releases...... do your homework before you blast the uploader. 
,LaBe1,2009-11-14T00:18Z,"I got the download, tried both passwords, neither worked."
,LaBe1,2009-11-14T00:19Z,"the correct pass is: Capital Letters Count!!

www.X360SOS.com"
,LaBe1,2009-11-14T00:26Z,It's Region Free! YAY!
,Bonez86,2009-11-14T06:16Z,SWEET!!! thanks Labe1 !!!
,singh0918,2009-11-14T15:03Z,none of the passwords are working!.....SHIT
,singh0918,2009-11-14T15:10Z,"never mind, when u copy password from LaBe1 make sure u paste it on a notepad or something first"
,CaliGamer,2009-11-15T19:04Z,Hi all i have a question i have ABGX360 my xbox is banned so i dont have to worry about playing the game when it comes out. sooo here is my question how do ppl play before the games comes out because ABGX always fails me before release date. Someone please help me solve this problem
,akforce,2009-11-15T19:05Z,what do i do when extracting and it says needs new volume
,christian_sese,2009-11-16T04:01Z,"CaliGamer having the same prob, but i didnt get banned on xbox live. i think the only way is to wait, especially with ban waves left and right its better to just wait till abgx360 can verify the iso's so your safe.

I prefer to wait lol"
,prophecy21,2009-11-16T08:57Z,"the password is ""Assassins Creed 2"""
,briley,2009-11-16T12:44Z,"Passworded you stuipid wanker, ffs piratebay, bring bk demonoid"
,briley,2009-11-16T12:47Z,Do your home work (just seen that) do you understand the files i have wasted because the uploaded could have just left them with out one.
,briley,2009-11-16T12:49Z,abgx wont save you any more wait 4 nu firmware and do your own if you want to stay safe online
,briley,2009-11-16T12:49Z,I.E. rent and rip
,briley,2009-11-16T13:36Z,comes up with wrong password after exstracting uploader is a rite cunt
,briley,2009-11-16T16:53Z,"tried every password possiable and so far ""Assassins Creed 2"" is the only one that does any thing but it still says wrong pass word when it reaches 0054xs.r54, so i am sry if i seem rude but why is there a password is the first place and now it seems theres more than 1, you must be talking the piss"
,leggman7,2009-11-16T22:01Z,"The password is ""www.X360SOS.com"" as has already been noted. Also its region free. It failed Steath and Verification when I ran it through abgx."
,leggman7,2009-11-16T22:09Z,"Sorry, was using an old version of abgx. With the most updated it passes the stealth."
,requaz,2009-11-16T23:40Z,"again as stated password is www.X360SOS.com make sure to copy and paste it into notepad, then copy and paste it again to the password to make sure it works. Ran iso through abgx360 and the game is region free, passed everything except online verification (obviously)"
,hansolo1210,2009-11-17T00:16Z,"Why cant I extract the iso file, whenever I unzipped the file , not seeing the iso file to burn?"
,christian_sese,2009-11-17T02:19Z,"i give up, the guy write the password twice and most of the idiots still dont understand they are even creating their own passwords impatient idiots.

obviously if you fucking extracted the iso properly it would show up as an iso if it dont you have not extracted it properly

i give up"
,nemesis323,2009-11-17T05:01Z,noob!
,CaliGamer,2009-11-17T15:57Z,so are you guys say i need to wait for abgx to put the game up for patching? because since my live is banned i dont care so i just wanna play but abgx failed this torrent. When i mean torrent i mean ISO. is there another patching system or somethinh that patches before release date??
,jesaug205,2009-11-18T11:58Z,"I used the password: WWW.X360SOS.COM (all capital letters), no problem then, works like a charm! GJ Markuf! =)"
,DiloSSS,2009-11-19T17:37Z,good! hope it work! ;)

Please help guys i want to play this game btw i have an xbox 360 elite if it makes a differnece"
,ji_mestone,2009-11-20T15:45Z,"I'm having problems with the password.  I used WWW.X360SOS.COM (all caps) and it starts to unzip it, then about half way through it stops saying there's a problem with the password.  I've tried www.X360SOS.com and www.x360SOS.com like I've also seen on here, but those don't work immediately. 
Anyone else having this problem?  HELP please!"
,dsanger34,2009-11-20T16:22Z,the password is slightly incorrect. the x in it should be capitalized.
,ji_mestone,2009-11-20T16:27Z,"I tried that - the only password that even starts to unzip the rar is WWW.X360SOS.COM (all caps, including the X).  Anything else doesn't work at all.  But it still stops unzipping at about 50%"
,ji_mestone,2009-11-21T00:08Z,"My bad...I'm a dumbass.  www.X360SOS.com worked.
Thanks for the upload!  You rock man!"
,Torka,2009-11-21T11:23Z,"Hey.. when i burned this in imgburn( controlled in abgx first ) and put the ""x360sos_ac2.rf.dvd"" file in the imgburn it says play dvd in the xbox when i start the ""play dvd"" a screen with the xbox loga shows and nothing else happends.. is it something with the firmwire or have i done something wrong ?"
,lavan92,2009-11-21T22:19Z,I am having the excat same problem as Torka. I burned the ISO with Imgburn and when i try to start only the xbox logo comes up and says trying to read media. some help would be really appriciated
,Fenopy,2009-11-22T03:20Z,"@lavan92 & @Torka

The Game is WAVE 4.
You will need either 1.51 iXtreme firmware (Hitachi Only) or the Activation disc (Activate.ISO) which is included with your abgx360 Download.

It should have told you this when you stealth checked it. Which it needed."
,lavan92,2009-11-22T10:53Z,I am abit new to ABGX360 so how can i find the activation disk? and yes i probably have iExtreme 1.4 or lower. Can i still make this game work on my console?
,guyver51,2009-11-23T04:15Z,"DL game extracted files using password WWW.X360.COM extracted 99% then message tells me CRC failed r70 wrong password, dont understand why a password in the first place. just wasted one and a half days for this pile of shit"
