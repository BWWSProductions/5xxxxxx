"First Train Home" is a song by British singer/songwriter Imogen Heap, and the first single off her third solo album Ellipse.

Imogen Heap revealed a story behind the creation of the song in a few interviews. She claimed: "I was trying to project manage my studio, and the house and moving in never having done anything like that before is EXTREMELY stressful. [...] I was so stressed out. So my friend rang me up and said â€œI never see you anymore, why donâ€™t you come down, youâ€™re not making the record yet â€“ come downâ€. So I went down to Brighton and all the way on the train I was making phone calls, and I wanted to just be back home working on it. [...] So we went out this festival â€“ it was good â€“ but being around music made me even more jittery like I should be doing more and getting home. I didnâ€™t really have a good night really. I was trying so hard to be into the night and they were all nice people and everything but I just wasnâ€™t into it, but I just couldnâ€™t escape and I couldnâ€™t get home and it was too late and lived three hours away. So I was stuck [...] Literally, you just want to scream and slap everyone around (not really slapping everyone around - joking), but you know you just donâ€™t want to be there. Panic attack set in. Cold sweats. And I just wanted to get on the first train home basically. I did eventually â€“ got the first train home, stayed up all night and wrote the song on the piano at home really quickly. Whatâ€™s lovely about it is that I recorded the song in the studio which is directly underneath the dining room where the piano is. And then yesterday [says very excitedly], I filmed the video for it which is where I wrote the song!"
