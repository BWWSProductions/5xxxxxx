Think Tree is an industrial band whose time period seems to be the late 1980's and early 1990's. Though they are mainly from many areas of the United States, they based themselves in Boston. They released two albums on Caroline Records, 8:13 in 1991 and Like the Idea in 1992, and their video has been promoted on MTV's 120 Minutes.

Peter Moore and Will Ragano from Think Tree went on to form Boston based band Count Zero http://www.count-zero.com while Krishna Venkatesh went on to form El Dopa.
