                Universal Document Converter v5.0.909.4130 + Crack



Release date: 2009, Sept 08 (2009-10-08)


Universal Document Converter is the most complete solution for the conversion of 
documents of any type into Adobe PDF or graphical files. The underlying basis of 
Universal Document Converter is the technology of virtual printing. As a result, 
exporting Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Excel tables, Microsoft PowerPoint 
presentations and Autodesk AutoCAD drawings into a chosen format is not any more 
complicated than printing on a desktop printer.

Universal Document Converter can assist you in preparing documents to be published
on websites, protect them from unsanctioned copying and changes when sent by email,
save tons of time while preparing PowerPoint presentations, and also simplify the 
process of sending materials to the printshop or publisher. In addition, you will 
be able to cut expenses on the development and implementation of a corporate 
document flow system.



*Product Overview:

Export into 8 formats. 
Documents of any type can be exported into Adobe PDF or graphical files in 7 
popular formats: TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PCX, DCX, GIF or BMP. 

Work with multipage documents. 
Several documents of various types can be united into one multipage file.

Universality. 
The technology of virtual printing makes it possible to convert documents of any 
type, including multipage reports, technical drawings and commercial posters, 
into a chosen format.

Practicality. 
The direct export of a document into a graphical file (instead of printing and 
scanning a paper copy) economizes on expendable materials and time.

Ease of use. 
For exporting documents of any type into Adobe PDF or graphical files all that is 
required is to print them using the printer labeled 'Universal Document Converter'.

The advanced algorithm of quantization. 
Advanced algorithm for image quantization makes it possible to produce the highest
quality copies even when converting them into a black and white format.

High resolution. 
The ability to export documents with a resolution up to 2,400 DPI enables you to 
save all elements of design of advertising materials and the minutest details of 
drawings and electronic diagrams.

Automatic margin cropping. 
The function of automatic cropping of empty margins makes it unnecessary to edit 
graphical copies of tables and diagrams before placing them in presentations or 
text documents.

Economy of system resources. 
Low consumption of system resources enables you to export documents of practically 
any size which can contain hundreds of pages.

Flexibility in configuration. 
The flexibility in configuring the program makes it possible to choose the 
optimal ratio between the quality of documents copies and the size of output files.
For example, for publication on a website the smallest possible files are needed. 
On the other hand, for preparing documents to be sent to the printshop, files are 
required that are high resolution and compressed without quality loss.

Quick configuration. 
A profile library (collection of settings with optimal conversions for standard 
conversion tasks) makes it possible to configure Universal Document Converter 
with two clicks of the mouse.

Remote usage. 
Compatibility with Microsoft Windows Terminal Services and Citrix makes it 
possible to use Universal Document Converter from remote computers.

Scalability. 
The possibility to share Universal Document Converter over a network and use it 
from workstations allows for a significant increase in speed for the conversion 
of documents.

COM-interface. 
The presence of a COM-interface simplifies the compatibility of document flow 
systems with Universal Document Converter.

 

*Fields of Application:

Document Sharing and Archiving.
Exchanging documents in the Adobe PDF format protects you and your clients from 
any technical difficulties. 

Presentation Creation.
Documents converted to JPEG or PNG graphic formats can be easily inserted into 
your PowerPoint presentations without any problems. 

Web Publishing.
Publishing presentation materials and product catalogs in the Adobe PDF format 
offers clients all needed information in a reliable and change-protected form. 

Preparing Layouts for the Printshop.
Converting documents into the TIFF format guarantees high printing quality and 
simplifies work with printshops and publishers. 

Corporate Workflow System Deployment.
Universal Document Converter reduces your expenses on the development of a 
corporate workflow system.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
