[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-09T03:25Z,"@jersson 

Updating to Acrobat 9.2 when using 9.0 + patch won't work, and most likely updating will screw your Acrobat.
Seems like Acrobat Pro Extended 9.2 + Crack (just a .dll file) is already on TPB, and the Pro version probably will soon follow."
,karated,2009-11-09T13:44Z,"Does Not Work

I converted a  few pages from Web to jpg. All watermarked. From text to pd also watermarked as unregistered version.

I think crack does not work.
I am pretty sure RobbingHood could make it. 

Thanks anyway"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-09T16:00Z,"@karated

Obviously you've missed the install notes in the Readme.txt file, so here are the install notes once more:

After install copy the file udceng.exe from the crack folder to: 
*\WINDOWS\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\3"
,karated,2009-11-12T18:11Z,"Thanks RobbingHood

I followed your instruction carefully. It does not work. Watermark remains there. I have Windows 7 home premium 64 bit. Probably it does not work with 64 bit OS. 

I even tried with another computer with same OS. same problem ... watermark remains on output files.

,dirk928,2009-11-15T22:38Z,"After following instructions...didn't work for vista 64 bit, either."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-17T06:41Z,"It's working for me, so maybe it's an pc issue or maybe it's because I'm stupid. "
,h2oteanu,2009-11-18T18:15Z,"I do not know who is stupid with this matter but RH certainly is not.

With x64 OS the path is:

...\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3

It works just fine. Thank you RH"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-19T05:46Z,"@h2oteanu

Thanks for helping the poor :) 
x64 users just said it didn't work, so I wonder which path they used .....

Path OS w32x86: *\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\3 

Path OS x64: *\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\x64\3 "
,nirushan456,2009-11-19T07:18Z,"Working perfectly with Win XP SP3. No more Watermarks. Great upload, Thank you RobbingHood "
,karated,2009-11-19T16:55Z,"Thank You very much RobbingHood for your foloow up, thanks h2oteanu

Now it works

As  you clarified the path to X86 and x64 are not the same.

,NightF0x,2010-02-18T05:50Z,"Thanks for the up!

This program is kinda irritating to use but seems to get the job done. "
,DoktorD1313,2010-04-16T00:16Z,"@ The guys with Vista and 7 who can't get it to work...

You need to put the cracked file in: *\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\x64\3

*\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\3
Does not work...

Check your directory..

Working great on my Vista and Windows 7!

,gokuman,2010-04-25T08:19Z,"Thank you RobbingHood, and DoktorD1313 for the correct path for Windows 7. I was trying for 15mins trying to find out where to put the crack. Thanks."

,stark17,2011-09-21T17:27Z,"Im getting a runtime error everytime I try to install this program. Worked great with my previous laptop (windows xp) but i cant seem to make it work with my newer one, which is windows 7. 

Reads, ""Runtime error (at 142:1294); Access violation at address 003C6225. Read of address 0B4946DC""

It's kind of frustrating because this is one of the best programs I've used. Converting my files is a necessity for me. Any help will be very much appreciated."
