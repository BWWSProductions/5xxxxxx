When Selina Kyle embarks on a mission of grand larceny in Rome, the last person she expects to team up with is the Riddler.  But when a host of Gotham's other villains arrive on the scene, including the crazed Cheetah, Selina will need to think fast if she's going to survive!

Written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Tim Sale.

This story takes place during the events of Batman: Dark Victory, between Valentine's Day (when Catwoman leaves Gotham) and Thanksgiving.
