This is all of the studio recordings that I know of by The Process, a punk rock band from Ukiah Ca, active from the early nineties until the early 2000s. I also included two concert recordings I happened to have.

Included are;

End Times-the only full length cd.

The High Performance Ammunition 7"

The 50' Jesus 7"

The Process side of the process/Mickey and the Big Mouths split 7

An early version of Little Stiff from a comp called nothing to believe in.

The two Process tracks from an industrial strength records sampler

An audience recording I made of a show they played at the Phoenix theater in Petaluma 2/1/97.

A recording of a set they made at the Demon Lounge in Ukiah with people from the audience coming up to sing, because Dr. T was'nt there, and Ethan Schee playing guitar, because Bubba had left the band. Ukiah people might note that at least one of these songs has Jake Cash who is in All Teeth now doing guest vocals.

enjoy, and if you have more, let me know.
