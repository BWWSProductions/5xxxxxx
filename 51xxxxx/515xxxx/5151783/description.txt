What would you guys do without me? Max Bemis fans delight! Before the website was taken down, I was able to download Max Bemis' FULL set recording at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, CA and this torrent is the result of his complete set.

I've split up the set into individual tracks.


Here's the track listing:

 
1. show starting
2. Alive With The Glory of Love
3. Baby Girl, I'm A Blur
4. Woe
5. That Is Why [song starts at 1:30]
6. Total Revenge
7. Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too
8. About Falling
9. Ahh, Men* 
10. I Want To Know Your Plans
11. Spores 
12. Belt
13. A Walk Through Hell


** This was the first time Max Bemis ever played this song to the public. =]


I have the video of this performance.
Feel free to download it and seed it, here:
