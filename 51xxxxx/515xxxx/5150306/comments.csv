,jersson,2009-11-06T17:26Z,I find two of these but the first one seems a later vers ? Am I right ?

Looks like they are throwing out a new version every few days. This one should be the latest (for now)..."
,jersson,2009-11-06T18:58Z,"How do you choose your uploads ? By demand, request or what you find interesting ? Could you make a portable vers of any appl you find or are some appl more difficult than others ?
All your uploads seems to be working so fine so you are a real pro, that's for shure"
[V],NoExcuses,2009-11-06T20:19Z,"@jersson
I normally pick up all the proggies that I find interesting, and the good ones I try to make them portable. Sometimes someone asks me something that I don't know, and I try also with them. Not all programs can be made portable, specially if the programmer doesn't want to, and some of them can't be converted even if you use Thinstall or similar."
,cyberman65,2009-12-25T12:46Z,works perfectly just upgrade to pro download newest version and upgrade again
