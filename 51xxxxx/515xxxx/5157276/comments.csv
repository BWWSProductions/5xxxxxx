,themadhellion,2009-12-07T06:33Z,Not fail...I got it to work perfectly.  You just need to export the .srt file from the zip and load it into your media player along with the movie.  I use VLC media player.
,EvilPoP,2010-04-11T06:25Z,"I don't understand how to load it into the movie. I have VLC.
Also, is there a way to embed them into the video so I can have subs automatically when I play the movie?"

NOTE: these are apparently for the 2:18 length version of this movie, but there are also 2:12 and 2:26 versions floating around. Kind of annoying."
