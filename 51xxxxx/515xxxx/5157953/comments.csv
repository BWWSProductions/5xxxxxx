,bookolla,2009-12-16T16:11Z,"odus: No it isn't corrupt. It's not a virtual image like some .img files but a Garmin map archive which also has a .img extension.

You open it with programs like MapSource or QLandkarte or transfer it directly to a Garmin GPS device."

,bookolla,2010-01-09T18:20Z,"FoCal87: Can you install this on your Symbian v60 phone? Not unless your phone has a reader for the Garmin map format.

There are some unofficial readers for this available such as QLandkarte, I don't know if Symbian v60 has one."
,almararn,2010-02-09T20:27Z,Installed this in my Nokia 5230 Symbian S60v5 and it workes great.  Had to install Garmin Mobile XT for Symbian v5 first.
