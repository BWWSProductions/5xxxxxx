This is a cracked version of Garmin Iceland's 2009 GPS map. Or "Garmin ï¿½slandskort v. 2009" in the original language. See this website for sales documentation: http://garmin.is/product/kort/islandskort.shtml

The torrent contains a single gmapsupp.img file. To use it simply mount your GPS as a USB drive and drop that file into a "Garmin" folder on the device (creating the "Garmin" folder if it doesn't exist).
