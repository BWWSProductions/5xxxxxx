Hello, it's a half-hour odd of Kenickie playing their pop hits of the day in front of a live audience, some broadcast engineers from Steve Lurpak's Evening Session, and some guy with a battered old camcorder.

Quality is poor - amateur recording notwithstanding, this was captured and badly encoded by a clot nearly a decade ago and flogged on CDRs via Ebay before they stopped allowing such things - but acebestness is high.

(That is until our intrepid cameraman gets spotted and asked to turn off the camera by some dreadful boor who figures that Kenickie would surely have glossy Hollywood films made about them in a similar fashion to Abba, Village People, and there would be no need for crummy Video8 footage in the future.)
