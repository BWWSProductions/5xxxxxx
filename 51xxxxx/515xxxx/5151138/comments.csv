I know how to make the crack work.  It's exactly like The Battle For Middle-Earth 1,2 & Witch King (also by EA).

Create a new text document named ""Options"" and paste this into it:

AudioLOD = High
HasSeenLogoMovies = yes
IdealStaticGameLOD = High
Resolution = 1280 720
TimesInGame = 1

Close the document and change the .txt into a .ini 

Now take your Options.ini file and put it in My Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Data foler (and this also works for the Zero Hour expansion as well as ALL the Battle For Middle-Earth games).  

And that's it.  Oh, and feel free to change the Resolution values to, say, 1920 1080 or whatever your monitor will handle.  
Note that the Middle-Earth games came out long before widescreens were invented and in-game, only support 4:3 resolutions so they show black bars on each side of the game, but can be ""tricked"" into playing in widescreen mode by changing these values.  

I just tried this for the hell of it and be damned if it didn't work.  (Hip Hip Hooray!)  "
