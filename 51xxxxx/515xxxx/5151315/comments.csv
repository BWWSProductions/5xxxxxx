,castanatm,2009-11-07T09:55Z,"HELP PLS:
Since last month, or so, i can't DL ezTV torrents. I didn't had any problem before. The DL won't start at all. Anyone knows what could be the problem?

Other torrents from the TPB work just fine.

TY "

You can go to http://www.torrenteditor.com/ and edit the torrent, just change the trackers (or add this ones):
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce"
