[T],kriss_kringle,2009-11-14T15:24Z,"Dude,you're an idiot.Plain and simple."
,nardysenior,2009-11-23T06:44Z,are the subs just for Italian speaking parts or for the whole movie
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-11-25T15:46Z,Well if you would use KMPlayer which I recommend in the description you won't have any audio problems.Who knows what shit codec pack you have and what old player for movies.
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-11-26T13:16Z,Well it's definetly from your computer because part 2 works fine on mine otherwise I wouldn't have uploaded it in the first place.Check your codec pack .Maybe you need an update.
,23joecool,2009-11-27T02:21Z,where to get ENG subtitles for this version's Italian speaking parts ? 
,T-Fish,2009-11-28T23:16Z,"english forced subtitles (only for the italian parts)
can be downloaded from opensubtitles.org

http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3590602/the-godfather-en"
,23joecool,2009-11-29T08:08Z,"YES, i tried about 10 different files, but only found one that was working for the version i mentioned:

The.Godfather.Trilogy.BRRip.H264.AAC.5.1ch.Gopo

if you have the same version, could you send me a link to download it directly ?"
,T-Fish,2009-11-29T17:11Z,"i did post the link, didn't i? :p
there are two subs, the one you want is this one:

The.Godfather.1972.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264.dxva-EuReKA.ENG_Forced.srt 

Eng-Forced means its only subtitles for the non English parts.
you can find subs for part 2 and 3 from the same scene release on that site as well. all 3 match perfectly fine with gopos release."
,gunukhan,2009-12-08T23:18Z,"dear gopo thanks for all your rips especially godfather,deer hunter and raging bull.too good.when u get some free time please consider my requests as there are no decent rips available.

[T],kriss_kringle,2009-12-09T15:44Z,Gunukhan if all the movies there have blu-ray releases I will look into it but at the moment I already have a list of movies that I will rip so if you have a little patience I will make a couple of them.

,the_toasted,2010-02-24T23:11Z,"i haven't finished downloading it yet, but it's sad to see how everybody keeps crying about various things, but nobody appreciate his work.. and that it's for free.


and if it really was sooooo bad, why are there about 150 seeds and download with a stable 900+ kb/s :P"
,kiNosabi,2010-02-25T00:27Z,"This an awesome release, amazing quality!!!!

Thanks!

I found the forced Eng subs for part I & II, but can't seem to find them for Part III. If someone could post the link that would be very kool!

thx"
,dizzlekrew,2010-04-07T03:21Z,will this work on the ps3? like will he subtitles be there or will i get none at all? anyway to make it work? ive downloaded alot of movies and most work but i cant remeber if any had subtitles when ppl were speaking a diff language. but a rating 1-10 A/V would be nice
,Black-Filter,2010-05-05T01:36Z,Bad quality.
,Sig69,2010-05-30T04:58Z,"Hard coded subtitles...  THANKS A BUNCH!@!!!

Audio is screwed as well.  If PowerDVD 10 doesn't even play it then it is crap."
,FileError420,2010-06-08T02:02Z,"Incredible quality! Ultra fast download.

Thanks so much kk!"
,FileError420,2010-06-08T02:06Z,"PS: The subtitles are NOT hard coded, they're from srt. files. Check your settings, sig."
,roshant,2010-06-13T05:41Z,"English subtitles
SUBS: Use the files ending in ""forced.srt"" if you only want subs for non-english parts. 
Part I: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3590602/the-godfather-en

,nittany,2010-08-13T07:49Z,"Thanks for the upload, but it is annoying that this did not include forced English subtitles for the non-English speaking parts.  

The .srt files that comes in this torrent provides subtitles for the entire movie in some weird foreign language.  

I like it when people share movies the correct way, not make it a hassle and then when you complain they say ""it's free so don't bitch"" well if you are going to share something, do it the correct way or don't do it at all."
,LightTheRebellion,2010-08-28T19:35Z,"I have a novel idea: Why don't you kids just shut your cunt mouths the fuck up before you get tied to a fucking radiator and skull-fucked until you die?

nittany, it's called fucking Romanian. Learn2read, you ignorant douche. Go ahead and buy the fucking movies while you're at it, you fucking prepubescent anal wart."
,wyup,2010-10-16T19:35Z,"I am sorry but I don't like this movie, however good it may be. I feel uninvolved with the characters, I can't appreciate how genious this movie is. I expected cinematic art but I can't watch more than an hour. And I can appreciate all other top movies in cinema. This feels like an average one for me. I can't feel the greatness of other movies like it or not.

Then, for the quality, the restored version is as good as it gets, bearing in mind the dark photography and grain from the master, it has good contrast but a low dynamic range. Sound is good and clear.

However subtitles are not in english! Thanks for the upload."
,tonecool,2010-10-23T20:10Z,thank you!
,spunkedunken,2011-02-26T15:18Z,"Good torrent, don't mind the whiners and trolls."
