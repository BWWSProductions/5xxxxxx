Completely updated every year (unlike most of the competition), Frommer's Maui features gorgeous full-color photos of the pristine beaches, colorful undersea life, and lush rain forest vistas that await you. Personally researched by a local expert, and written in an honest, personal voice, Frommer's Maui is the premier guide to this fascinating island.

It's all here, from thrilling whale watching to the spectacular sunrise at Haleakala National Park, from a mile-by-mile drive along the Road to Hana to mule rides on neighboring Molokai. No other guide comes close to matching our coverage of the island's beaches, golf courses, and adventure outings, with personal recommendations on the best outfitters, dive sites, and snorkeling spots.

Our candid and in-depth hotel reviews, all based on recent personal inspections, will help you find the perfect place to stay: a lavish high-rise resort, a family-friendly condo complex, or an intimate B&B on its own private cove. And our restaurant reviews, all personally written by one of Hawaii's leading dining critics, are simply second to none. Whether you're looking for romance or family fun in the sun, Frommer's Maui is the only guide you'll need. You'll even get a free color fold-out map that makes trip-planning a snap!
