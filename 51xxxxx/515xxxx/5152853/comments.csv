I am speechless at how generous and efficient you are with all this 80s music! 

I mean... you are like the genie of an 80s lamp conceding music wishes ...

,Kraftvox,2009-11-09T21:14Z,Thank you for all of the great postings. One the rarest recordings I've looking for from the 80's is Nuns - Rumania (PVC) 1986. It is a recording by the infamous S.F. Punk band from the late 70s. This recording sounds like a cross between Berlin & Blondie. If you come across it could you please post it. Thanks again.
