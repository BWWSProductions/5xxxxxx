You might have missed the whole point -- it's not about making you ""feel"" ""good"". It's about stopping the mind-games that keep you propelling yourself towards ""good"" ""feelings"" in spite of everything else. A noble cause."
,Mikagon,2010-10-16T23:47Z,"hah.. it's funny how your comment spreads out your affection towards desteni instead of trying being objective towards my subjectivity. Just because they lost it's touch doesn't mean i'm not following them. I just happen to find something that fits my being more and fills my absence of seeking my own truth. And if i need to objective, you are way too misinformed to make that judgement about desteni. Guardians watch you, but who's gonna watch the guardians? Right.."
