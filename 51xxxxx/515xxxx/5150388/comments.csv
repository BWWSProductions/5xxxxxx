Now that magnets are the way most people begin their DLs from TPB, you don't always see that option to pick individual files at the beginning of the DL.  

Hopefully, fewer people will be scared off of this because they shun dual layer large downloads if they know it.  It may have been a better idea, therefore, to offer them as two different torrents because of this.  Still, thanks for this tempting offer."
