,77BiOhAzArD77,2009-11-21T12:01Z,Note-Tried updating to 1.55 firware and DS hung at loading screen.Have 3 R4 cards-2 are running 1.18 and wont work on any higher fw-the other is running 1.20 and wont run on anything higher.Strange as i got them all from the same supplier but thats how it goes i guess-so if you update to a newer firmware PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU BACKED UP your current firmware :-)
