Introducing Windows Server 2008 R2
Microsoft Press | Copyright Â© 2010 | 200 Pages | Library of Congress Control Number: 2009938603 |  PDF


Windows Server 2008 R2, or simply R2 for short, is the second release of Windows Server 2008

This book is targeted primarily at Windows server administrators who are responsible for hands-on deployment and day-to-day management of Windows-based servers for large organizations. Windows server administrators manage file and print servers, network infrastructure servers, Web servers, and IT application servers.

They use graphical administration tools as their primary interface but also use Windows PowerShell commandlets and occasionally write Windows PowerShell scripts for routine tasks and bulk operations. They conduct most server management tasks remotely by using Terminal Server or administration tools installed on their local workstation.

Covering every aspect of Windows Server 2008 R2 in nine chapters and approximately 200 pages is clearly an impossible task. Rather than try to cover everything, weâ€™ve focused on what is new and important, while giving you the context from Windows Server 2008.
