,nerull69,2009-11-09T00:20Z,I wonder how many of you dummies think this is the new one.....  Now as you are reading this you realize I am talking about you.
,27scoob,2009-11-09T00:40Z,That comment was shit what if someone was trying to download a good copy of the orginal to watch or turn on some new people to the movie then that would make this a good upload and make your comment exactly like I said .... shit... thanks to the uploader for keeping this p2p thing going...
,nerull69,2009-11-09T18:01Z,"I was not talking about the people trying to download the original.  I am referring to the probably 300 or so that think this is the new one.
Reading comprehension scoob; you must have been absent for that class.  And now your dismissed."

,QoMSoL,2009-12-06T08:26Z,Unfortunately the image is corrupt in a couple of moments during the film. Not typical for a SecretMyth release. Gonna have to find another one though. Thanx anyway.
,asadkuyt,2009-12-12T09:31Z,"Good rip but crappy video on at least a couple of occasions. But thanks anyway.
