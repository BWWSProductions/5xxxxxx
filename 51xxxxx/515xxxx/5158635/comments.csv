,bullseye[0],2009-11-15T16:25Z,metalberka the rips are compressed files thats why they are smaller. So when you are installing the files they are de-compressing which will take awhile depending on your PC's processor/memory. Be patient and let it take its time.

seemes that you have not extracted the game properly, update your winrar or use 7z to extract the game, do the hash check in u torrent to see if there is no broken parts. these simptoms mean that some files have not extracted properly, you could also try disabling your antivirus, because some extraction, conversion tools sometimes do get recognised as viruses (false postive)."

I have also individually opened and checked each frearc file and the way the rip is scripted works and extracts ok. Just that it seems strange that in the  \main\sound\music dir only one file (emt_mx_airport_dining.wav) is in wav format - maybe that's the way the game is or for some reason you packed it differently.. This is the only music wav file in the wav.tptb arc file all other music wavs are in  the mp3.tptb arc file.

Great work guys, you have out done yourself with this one, P.S people complaining about how slow it is to download just give it a rest, no one cares, it will download when it downloads, it would take twice as long to get if it wasn't ripped so you should be thanking TPTB not having ago at them. If you want to game that badly and can't wait a few days go buy it."

i too have the same problem of missing voice. i have unzipped and installed it four times already. i use 7-zip, and during the unpacking, i had shut down all my antivirus and firewalls completely. so any external interference is ruled out. i can't seem to solve this problem any way. please help me. you seem to be technically very sound, considering the kind of compression you achieved. i just need your help. please reply asap.

anyone else if you can help, please do. i'll be highly thankful.

regards,

,imp16,2009-11-26T16:01Z,"the problem is sorted out on my 6th try!!! thanks anyways everyone...

btw, the performance on my pc is really bad. i have played even crysis comfortably at high settings but in this one, it seems to freeze for 3-4 secs everytime i turn or move. my pc is as under:

core 2 quad q6600
nvidia 8800gt (112 shaders, 512 MB GDR3 with 256-bit interface)
2 GB corsair xms2 ram at 800 MHz
WD 250 GB, 32 MB buffer, 7200 rpm HDD

the settings i used are very normal too... resolution around 1300 by 700, 2x AA and all details to ""extra"".

ideas, anyone??"

,Kepler101,2012-02-03T08:53Z,"Thanks for the upload  Shroo Single player works perfectly!

I have a question though. Since this seems to not have multiplayer installed is it possible to Merge this with another Multiplayer rip? Such as this one [ http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5581582/ ]

I should have bypassed all of this by downloading a full Rip but I didn't think I would need Multiplayer at the time and decided to get this smaller 6GB Rip."
