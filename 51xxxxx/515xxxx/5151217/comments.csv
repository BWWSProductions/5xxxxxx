,darksniper88,2009-12-05T14:02Z,I actually appreciate this 720 release so please seed if you have it ^^ ty uploader!
,tonydepp,2010-07-08T19:31Z,anyone care seeding this? plzz :( been 2 days at 20kbs but no 0 seeds n i gt around 1 gb left!
,raterillo,2010-08-31T22:32Z,"really 720 vertical resolution or is ""720"" that ends up beeing only ~500 vertical resolution?"
,osriccc,2010-11-30T23:16Z,"Please, if it's a 720p rip, keep the size around 2.5 Gb. 4 Gb is fine for 1080."
,jadasneez,2012-02-18T17:28Z,"@osriccc Go buy the movie and reencode it yourself, 720p at 2gb looks like crap on big tv's. 

A lot of people prefer 720p in a DVD5 size and 1080p in a DVD9 size..."
