People are living their lives remotely from the safety of their own homes via robotic surrogates â€” sexy, physically perfect mechanical representations of themselves. Itâ€™s an ideal world where crime, pain, fear and consequences donâ€™t exist. When the first murder in years jolts this utopia, FBI agent Greer (Willis) discovers a vast conspiracy behind the surrogate phenomenon and must abandon his own surrogate, risking his life to unravel the mystery.
