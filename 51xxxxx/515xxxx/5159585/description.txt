Again, just like Cha-Ching, had to search high and low for this....many tracker sites claim to have an active torrent for it but I constantly came up with zero seeds...so here it is in all its glory, the latest single from Hedley's latest effort, "The Show Must Go", due out next week, Nov 17....can't wait....awesome band...and Canadian to boot!!!
:)
Rock on guys!

...and I guarantee i'll be seeding it for a while...well...at least until the whole album arrives for our listening pleasure...
