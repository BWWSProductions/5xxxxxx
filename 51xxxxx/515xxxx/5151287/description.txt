"Rain" is the upcoming second single from Mika's second studio album The Boy Who Knew Too Much to be released in the United Kingdom.[2][3] The song was produced and mixed by Greg Wells and features the violinist Owen Pallett.

â€œ ["Rain"] is an unapologetic '80s pop record. I bumped into producer Stuart Price while he was working with The Killers at Olympic Studios. He helped me program this. It reminded him of ABBA and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. â€

The music video for "Rain" was filmed in Epping Forest in Essex and premiered online on 16 October, 2009. It was directed by Nez Khammal.[2] The video is set in a dark enchanted forest with Mika waking up in a colourful tent. He is soon joined by various strangely dressed imps and creatures who dance around him at first but chase him out of the forest amid exploding fireworks.
