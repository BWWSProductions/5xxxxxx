OK...to all the people that don't get why big files are broken down into tiny little RAR files...

YES...you do need RARs guys! 

One big ISO that gets downloaded and gets corrupted. So what if you have the hash code? Corrupt is corrupt and you have to download the whole damn 11GBs all over again

OR

use hash checks to see which small RAR file is bad and just download that one tiny file!

Would you want to re-download 11GBs or just 1 RAR file 100MB in size???

RAR is THE way to go. Get it now????

Download a huge ISO if you choose do but do not complain when others upload BIG files as multi part RARs. IT MAKES SENSE."

Torrent protocol has included property validation for every piece of data you downloaded. In case of hash check failure you should re-download _4_Mb_ piece, that all.

May be your wires sucks and you'd have to do it several times so what? 100Mb of wasted data for 11Gb torrent the worst you can count on and suck my ass if this is a bad deal.

RTFM of torrent protocol and go be stupid somewhere else."
