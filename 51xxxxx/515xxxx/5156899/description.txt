Proper Notes:
Razor 1911â€™s version is still having Steam intact. Why they choose to keep Steam intact on the release is a good question

Modern Warfare 2 is set five years after the conclusion of Call of Duty 4. Despite the efforts of the Marines and the SAS, the Ultranationalists seize control of Russia and declare Zakhaev a hero and martyr. Meanwhile, Vladimir Makarov, one of Zakhaevâ€™s former lieutenants, begins a reign of terror against Europe by staging numerous terror attacks. The game begins in Afghanistan, where US Army Ranger Private Allen helps take a Afghan city from an army of militants. Impressed, General Shepherd recruits Allen as a CIA operative and places him in Makarovâ€™s organization as an undercover operative. However, Makarov is one step ahead. He kills Allen, exposes his identity as an American, and turns him into a scapegoat for a brutal terrorist attack on a Russian airport. Meanwhile, Soap and Roach infiltrate a Russian airbase to recover a lost ACS module.
