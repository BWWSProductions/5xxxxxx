Comprised of a previously released EP and 4 new acoustic tracks, Lies succeeded in recasting GN'R into a band with more depth (and, unfortunately, venom) than any other L.A. group. The first half, the "live" tracks, (actually studio with overdubbed crowd noises) is a nice snapshot of the band's embryonic period but nothing more-they hadn't yet developed their memorable style. The 4 acoustic songs are the heart of the record-the lovely, generous "Patience" sets a gentle mood, but the rest of the record is unremittingly dark. "Used to Love Her" is simply a cruel (and old) joke set to a countrified shuffle. A smoldering "You're Crazy" is superior to the version on "Appetite", displaying the paranoia and selfishness of the song more successfully. But it's the scabrous "One In a Million" that defines this album. Murky and ominous, it presents a picture of a character (who may or may not be Axel) as he came to the big city and confronted his hatred of others and, ultimately, himself. Even more disturbingly, the song ends without a resolution-the hate remains, the demons fought to a draw, no winners. Like the rest of the album, it's an exorcism of raw emotion. Not easy to listen to, but extraordinarily powerful. It showed no other band could have shaped such ugly dramas into such compelling music.
