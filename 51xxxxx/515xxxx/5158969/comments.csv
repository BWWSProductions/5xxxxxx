[V],Kuthumi,2009-11-21T06:21Z,"We should be in the 'second half of the month' now, and this torrent still has only been seeded to 67%.  Early viewing reveals that this is an old vhs rip with sound in only one channel. "
,vdMerwe,2010-06-11T20:48Z,I would definitely snatch this (if only because it's shot in Montreal) if the other user comments were more promising.
,The_Rowdy_Man,2010-08-20T16:30Z,"Yes, that is likely correct, this is an old old copy of a copy and is not of high quality, only for those interested in obscure Canadiana!"
,btfan13,2011-10-18T06:11Z,"Thanks for posting this.  I DL it in less than 15 minutes from good seeding.

The quality is not as bad as some are making out but obviously, it's from the actual 16mm film judging from the tail end of the video.  Not the same as the DVD quality version but still good enough.

Love those 70s films, hair styles, hippie like clothing and the pot-head like characters from back then. lol"
