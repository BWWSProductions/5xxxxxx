Band - Blunt Object
 
Album - Edgeless

Record Label: Ward 69 Records  around 2001- 2003 

With a metal sound which pushes towards the nu-metal genre, Blunt Object produce a sound which seems to have obvious influences such as Machine Head and Mudvayne. These days bass is boring, all bass lines just playing along with the guitar not even sounding good, Mudvayne the only band in the nu-metal genre that is complicating their bass lines which gives their songs a raw edge. Blunt Object incorporate some slap bass in their songs which does go along with the guitar but makes it sound uncomplicated but interesting Mudvayne bass line. Vocally they sound a lot like Machine Head with the melodic vocals and deep screams, they variate their sound of the vocals a lot which is good. Another band out of Australia which we'll see get more recognition.
