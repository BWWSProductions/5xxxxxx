,awudu,2009-11-20T00:07Z,"It's a good torrent. it comes with Adobe Flash Player 10 ActiveX
How I wish it had JRE 6 update 17..

Anyway thanks for the upload AiTB.."
,Sexipaperman,2009-11-20T04:05Z,"@Ouzotime Of course they don't. People start realizing how to use torrents, and they're instantly computer experts. Because it's difficult to find Bittorrent and use it. (or if you use a linux like real nerds then a bittorrent client comes with it) 
and you people need to learn how to SEED. haha."

Did you have Windows 7 already installed? If So, go back and install XP first. If that's not an option, After installing XP (if it installs correctly for you) Repair your Windows 7 install to ensure that the boot files are created properly."
,856yt76,2009-12-06T04:31Z,any news on windows update?
,BuckNaked69,2009-12-07T09:34Z,"@penguinsrule
When setting up a dual-boot between vista/7 and XP you have to install XP first and then Vista or if you're doing it on two separate HDDs (rather than two partitions) you can pull it off by switching the boot sequence between the two HDDs but that's a royal pain.  But if you're trying to pull this off on a single drive you MUST install XP then Vista."

,sdkid,2010-01-01T04:02Z,"Downloaded it.
Used it.  
 It does NOT pass windows validation.  Genuine Advantage tool generates a message saying the CD-Key used in the install has been deactivated due to illegal software copying."
