This is the same copy from Xvid/Imagine I just converted it for everyone who doesn't know how.


Some of the quality gets lost during converting; it doesn't look 10/10 on a computer but it looks perfect on an iphone. If you know of a better converting software than WinX please let me know.


I'm working on downloading then converting the most popular torrents & always open to movie suggestions.
