Extract these files only to the drive you want to install matrix.
Dont try to install it on a different drive other than where extracted installing files are located.

16. This m60run icon you have to click to run.
17. All the other Matrix6.0, matrix running files will not work including the one in the start menu.
17. So make a shorcut of this Icon after pasting on the desktop to run matrix.

Caution	: Never Update or instally any service pack for matrix or Rhinoceros from internet the software will stop working then.

Important	: When you will scan zip files with antivirus they will show trojan but it is not a virus it is just the crack file to run rhino and matrix. So you have to be careful when virus scanning. If you will scan with antivirus you will notice that file name "GVSMAT3D.6.0.SR2.part14" & "GVSMAT3D.6.0.SR2.part1"  will show virus and will be deleted when scanned with anti virus. It is not virus it is the crack file. I have Mc afee anti virus and this is what happened to me. Solution is write these installation files on a DVD and keep them safe or Make an ISO image file with Nero or Magic ISO and save it.


â€¢	Once your matrix is installed itâ€™s fully functional and will never have any problems.

â€¢	To my best I tried to explain it in best possible manner 

â€¢	If you are not able to understand anything ask help from your friend or someone else who is a computer geek.
â€¢	These files work they just do.
