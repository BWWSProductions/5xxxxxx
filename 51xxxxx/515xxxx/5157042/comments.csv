,lucaricci,2009-12-04T14:13Z,Hi..most beautiful program..but render don't run..it seems to start but the program crash! why?  HELP ME !!!!
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-07T16:46Z,i downloaded but works fine with me just try to uninstall and install it on a different drive and try it. Do you know where I can fine some lesson on matrix
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-07T17:33Z,"Lucaricci I am sorry I downloaded the programme so that I can learn the software. As  I didnt had 5000$ to pay to GIA or any other institute to learn it, for the software that I dont even have. The software itself is way too expensive. I downloaded from various places and this is the only one I found that actually works if any particular function is not working then I will suggest to try installing on a different computer and see if it works there. Or simply uninstall and install on a different drive. Rest till now I didnt experienced any problems. I will like to ask you do you know if I can download gemvision matrix lessons from anywhere. Cheers. Remember when u will scan will antivirus the crack file can get deleted so u have to look after that and take care of the part14 rar file it has the crack file they also tend to get deleted by anivirus. I have mc afee it does it then I have to restore it again. Whenever it is quadrantine by an antivirus you have to restore the filed. It is a issue"
,pe82,2009-12-09T01:03Z,"Hello,
I follow the steps but I get this error:
Component 'Comdlg32.ocx' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid.
Am I missing a file on the computer? I dont know the only thought I have is that I had Rhino Installed previously, would that cause this to happen? (However Rhino is also pirated).
Thank you"
,pe82,2009-12-09T03:18Z,"Found the solution. After I reinstalled Rhino and all its components. The same problem came up again. But the solution is to right click on the file m60run and make it run as an administrator. Im using windows vista btw.
Well thank you for this awesome upload, great program."
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2009-12-09T19:27Z,"PE82 if you had the installation instructions carefully then on the first place you must had not any problems still read the point number 16,17 and 18 it is mentioned there
16. This m60run icon you have to click to run.
17. All the other Matrix6.0, matrix running files will not work including the one in the start menu.
17. So make a shorcut of this Icon after pasting on the desktop to run matrix."

,vampirian,2010-01-29T01:34Z,"I have a newer version of rhino , it's original, no need to crack - but it won't let me install the older one and the patch failed on it - what can i do to get matrix to work w my newer Rhino"
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2010-01-31T15:41Z,why do u want to use the newer rhino just use the one came in the torrent and make sure you dont update anything and follow the instructions strickly to make it work
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2010-01-31T15:42Z,unistall the original rhino you have the newwer one and install the one that came with the torrent.
,vampirian,2010-02-04T22:41Z,"thanks but I didn't have to, I had forgotten to run it as administrator.  All is well."
,sheepear,2010-02-05T01:19Z,"I installed the program exactly as instructed and the program works really well....except that it crashes if you try to render with Matrix's built-in V-Ray.  

It seems like somebody else has commented on this problem as well.  Has this been the experience of most users of this software?  Does anyone know of a solution?

I appreciate any help that can be provided.  Cheers!"
,raggybaggy,2010-02-06T01:27Z,"I installed as per instructions. some problems with patch instructions but finally worked. Then comdlg32.ocx problem. I re-installed but got to patch and cannot get it to patch. Skipped it and re-installed matrix and no comdlg problem but it cannot connect to rhino and rhino cannot register licence. I tried all solutions on mcneel wiki including missing rgistry entries, download fixes etc.
I still keep trying to patch but get 'patch unsucessful' everytime no matter as administrator or not.
PLEASE: anyone have some ideas"
,raggybaggy,2010-02-06T05:11Z,After un-installing rhino then re-installing rhino and another dozen or more attempts at the patch it finally worked and the full matrix-rhino program opened. Now just need to learn how to use it.
,londonbridgeinnewyork,2010-02-09T13:57Z,raggybaggy look the above comments i have posted the links for the gemvision matrix tutorials you can download the video tutorials from there. use auto downloader

,zipwax,2011-02-11T08:26Z,"There sure as hell is a virus in that crack. Don't let anybody tell you differently! Folks, any EXE that you run while you're administrator can do ANYTHING it wants to your system. It can mess with your OS, it can delete important files, it can copy your files and start sending them out over the net, it can start uploading and downloading illegal stuff and get you in serious trouble. That said, even most virus writers aren't that clever or ambitious so it probably won't. If it was really just a patcher program, it would simply open the old file, rewrite it, and close it. But it's not just doing that, so the antivirus program squawks about it and the people who put the virus out here lie about it. That said, it's my advice to ONLY run this on a box that is NOT on your main network, or is heavily firewalled, on a machine you don't have any important files on, and on a machine that you will eventually scrub clean again. If you can do that, by all means, install this. It does actually work. Most of the issues people describe here would be solved if people only ran AS administrator. merely being an administrator doesn't work as well. Good luck."

,thecynic,2012-03-14T19:45Z,"March 2012.
This upload DEFINITELY works.
I was having trouble. I had a brain-wave. Maybe it was because I was ONLy installing Matirx and I had different version of Rhinoceros installed (4.0 SR7). Sure enough installed the WHOLE PACKAGE exactly as per the instructions from this amazing upload (Thank you uploader) and it works perfectly.
I was a little confused as to why there were two different cracks (one in ""M"" folder and one in ""R""). After much googling I can give the benefit. The crack in ""R"" is for ""normal"" Rhinoceros. The crack in ""M"" is for those with a Revo Milling Machine.
Now all I have to do learn how to use it ... anyone invented a knowledge-torrent yet?"
