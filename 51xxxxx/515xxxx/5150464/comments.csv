So If you are downloading this, do not press stop button when your files are at 100%, let it seed, that means, a green arrow pointing upwards, and if you are busy during day, setup a scheduler under preferences, to seed all night.

,veerenski,2010-03-18T06:41Z,"To play .mp4 videos use VLC player. 
You can download it from here:

http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

Try the Fluctuation meditation.
Play any Osho audio or vide using VLC player
and play Osho music using a winamp player by
playing a song list at the same time you play
discources or videos.

Set volume for music much quieter than for
discource. Discource voice level should overshadow the volume of music when voice gets loud.

What happens is your consciousness is going to
fluctuate between hearing a discource and music
and pretty soon you will be able to see how your
mind flickers.

Plus, when you listen to discources with quiet music background, it is much harder to get totally distracted by the mind trips because music in the background brings your attention to it.

Just don't play any aggressive or complicated music. Ethnic music works also."

[T],mailtooo7,2010-07-15T18:51Z,"The reason why the torrent size is so small is that it only includes the 8 torrent files.

If you know email me  mailtooo7 at yahoo.com"
,veerenski,2010-08-08T00:03Z,"Not exactly a good idea to put torrent on the web
hoping to get a better speed for several reasons.

1) You defeat the whole purpose of torrent, which
is meant to distribute the information to the max.
number of people at the max speed.
The torrent download speed is as fast as swarm
peers are. If swarm peers limit the upload rate,
max. number of upload slots, and are slow, the
net result is slowing down the download speed.

So, if you want to maximize the dl speed, just
seed this torrent from a high bandwidth connection. It will be an equivalent of having a
fast web based download site.

There is basically no difference in speed if you
seed it vs. providing the collection via files.

2) If you provide the contents via web server,
not a good idea. Because you will have to zip
the whole thing up. Otherwise, you'd have to
provide hundreds of individual files separately.

The advantage of torrent unzipped version is
that as soon as you download even a small
part of the torrent, you already have some MP3
files which you can begin to play while torrent
is being downloaded.

If you use the zipped files, you can not start
playing any of them unless the whole zip is
downloaded, which means downloading the
whole torrent more or less.

If you download via torrents, you can set a
priority for different files to low or high.
If you want do have some MP3 files downloaded
completely as fast as you can, just set their
priority to ""high"" and the rest of files to ""low"".
That will get you the high priority files downloaded before the others get completed.

Basically, it is not a good idea to deliver the
MP3 in zipped format. First of all, it does not
give you much compression, so no gain in sight.
Secondly, you can not start playing some files
until the whole zip is downloaded.

3) Bandwidth sharing.
If you provide the content via web server,
yes, you CAN gain a fast download speed
assuming your sever is fast enough to serve it.
But that is only true for as long as your serving
bandwidth is higher then the download speed
multiplied by the number of users.
If you serve to 10 people or more, you'll choke
your server. Because users do not share bandwidth like with torrents.
With torrents download is done from MULTIPLE
peers. So their aggregate upload speed defines
your download speed. The download speed
multiplies by the number of peers and seeds
in the swarm.

So..."
,veerenski,2010-08-09T01:53Z,"Ok, you can look at web seed (also webseed) and see if this is something you are looking for as far as download speed goes.

But...
You have done your part and it is all working, and that is about ALL you need to bother about. That means you have an alive heart. You don't need to pump it up with some speed acceleration to speed things up for OTHERS.
You are not Jesus Christ, are you?

So...

Things are more complicated technically and there are some issues you do not even realize at the moment I bet. Just do not worry about it. Everything is just fine as is. Nothing to be done on your part beyond taking care of yourself."
,veerenski,2010-08-21T02:36Z,"Actually, one thing CAN be done and that is for people to keep seeding and not just download and go away, even if there are not that many people downloading.

Osho represents a very valuable material for all sorts of purposes and for everyone who feels in ANY way connected to him, just keep seeding, if for nothing else but out of gratitude for all those things you learned from him and all those eye opening things you realized as a result.

One interesting fact. I have observed recently that on some kill, kill type of game torrent there were 6000 seeders!!! And that is a complete garbage of a material, utter zombification type of thing.

Now, compared to Osho seeders that is about 1000 times better and that is among people who hardly care the others exist.

Quesion: Do people who are interested in knowing That Which Is there is less steam available and LESS support then between the zombies and biorobots?

Osho once said: out of 1000 people only one will get interested in investigating what IS, and out of those only one out of 1000 will go to the very end, and this is EXACTLY the proportions we are seeing here. Out of 6000 people seeding violence, only six are seeding consciousness.

Finally, yes, there ARE reasons NOT to seed, such as you don't like the material, you do not have access to computer and a few other reasons. But if you think of it, there is hardly a reason NOT to seed. It does not cost you ANYTHING. Just start a torrent program and use your computer without even bothering about it. It won't take your resources. You don't have to seed every Osho torrent out there. Just pick the  ones you like or those that do not have enough seeders and take care of those.

Another interesting fact, just as expected, the people with high speed connections happen to seed the least. They just download it for themselves and go away in a matter of hours if not minutes. And those people with slow connections, who spend days and weeks to download one large torrent tend to seed the most. That is why download speeds are slow.
The guys who can afford it the most and who can contribute tens if not thousands of times more seem not to care for anything other than their own skin.

Remember this:
""My way is the way of the HEART,
and not the way of 'perfect' ...""
[replace dots with your occupation]

I have seen plenty of people downloading at a rate of 8 megabits. If at least 10 of those were available your download speed would go up tens of times.

So...

Some people spend lots of time to make this all available with no conditions of any kind and you DID get the benefit out of it. Why don't you return the favor by contributing a little bit of your own energy and resources? What is so hard to comprehend?"
,PI22,2010-09-03T01:52Z,"Sorry veerenski and mailtooo7,
But after more than a week of unsuccessful listening to all of these torrents, like in May again I have to conclude that none of them are seeded. A pity.
All the best to you."
,veerenski,2010-09-03T04:13Z,"ALL the torrents are seeded, and seeded better than they ever were. Those, who seed, can not possibly control the situation because it takes about 50 megabits to seed a large torrent because there are at least 10 people downloading.

It all depends of COOPERATIVE effort. Not a single individual can possibly satisfy the bandwidth for all the torrents so that downloaders go at their maximum speed.

It is all up to YOU, people. If you limit your upload speed, the max. number of upload slots, or your connection is slow, there is only that much that you can do.

But...

No matter what, there are ""guards"" minding it all. They are there to make sure you all come to the end and will be able to complete. It is not THEIR responsibility to make sure you do it in the shortest possible time. It all depends on you and people like you. Interestingly enough, whenever you see someone from Sweden, Norway or USA, they come fast, really fast. But as soon as they download it for themselves, they just go away, disgusting as it is.

Finally, what is the hurry? You see, things with Osho torrents are organized in such a way that you have an opportunity to review enough of material to keep you busy until you download some large torrent. You are given the best of the best in Remastered versions and Fluctuation Meditations. Just listen to that instead of being greedy, trying to download the whole world of Osho. It will crack your scull into pieces.

Just relax. If YOU are slow in terms of speed, download the smallest torrent. No matter which one you take, it will take you years (EARS!!!, like Osho pronounces it) to realize what you already have. You don't need the whole universe when you deal with Osho. It is just like an ocean. You can taste it from any place in the world and it will taste exactly the same. He keeps telling you the same thing from all sorts of angles and standpoints.

Finally, learn to appreciate and if something does not work for some reason, go investigate it deeply. Who knows, may be YOU are screwed up. You never know, you never know.

Good luck now. And remember one thing: ENJOY!!!"
,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T21:56Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his 'teachings' led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984.  He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
,veerenski,2010-09-28T09:34Z,"Question:

Why do we have over 30 people seeding THIS torrent, which contains nothing but the pointers to other torrents, and we do not have enough people seeding the actual torrents?

Are you greedy about your bandwidth?
Well, vast majority of you do not pay a penny for that bandwidth and seeding the actual torrents does not affect ANYTHING you do with your computer.

So, this thing is not only irrational. It is simply insane.

One more time: what are you doing here, wasting away around Osho? What do you expect to happen at the end?"
,veerenski,2010-10-02T08:27Z,"The most effective download strategy.

When you just download a large torrent containing many files, the download will pick random blocks from random files, which will require you to download the whole torrent before you actually have a single piece, a single chapter from a book fully downloaded.

What you do instead is this:

1. Select the Files tab in your torrent program.
2. Click ^A (Control-A) to select all the files.
3. Right mouse button click on files and select ""Low Priority"" from a popup window.
4. Then select a single file or several files you would like to complete first and do the same, right mouse click on those files and select ""High Priority"" from a popup.

What this does is to make sure you will first download the files with Hight Prioirity. So they will get completed first instead of randomly downloading blocks from different files.

Then watch your download and keep setting the High Priority for next batch of files you want to download.

Note on MP3 listening. You can start listening to MP3 files even if they are not fully complete. You can do it either via going to File tab on torrent program and double click on any file that has at least one dark blue block, which means it has been fully downloaded and saved to disk. That will automatically open your player and will start playing whatever blocks that file has downloaded up to now.

Another way is to right mouse click on a torrent in a Jobs list, and select ""Open Containing Folder"" option from the popup menu. That will open an explorer window and from there you can navigate to one of files and double click on it to play it."
,veerenski,2010-10-02T08:50Z,"Effective seeding strategy:

The basic idea is to maximize the upload speed so your torrent program shows the same seeding speed as your upload speed of your provider connection.

If you see too many torrents and too many slots on some large torrent, your seeding speed will degrade. Because there is overhead with servicing each upload slot. On a typical machine, the most efficient bandwidth utilization happens at about 8-10 upload slots. A slot is a connection to a specific downloader. Each torrent has a number of downloaders or a number of slots.

So, if you are interested in seeding many torrents, then limit the number of upload slots for each torrent by right clicking on a torrent in Job list, then selecting Properties choice from a popup menu and setting the ""Number of Upload Slots"" to 1 or 2, depending on a total number of torrents and slots are there.

Do not limit your upload rate. It will only decrease your upload performance. Each upload slot should go at the max. upload speed for best efficiency. The only criteria is total number of upload slots.

This way, you will utilize your upload bandwidth to the max.

Periodically check on all the torrents you are potentially interested in uploading and see if some of them have less than 4 seeders, which means they are not well seeded and download rate will be way too slow.

If you see some torrents that have more seeders than downloaders, those torrents are probably seeded enough. You can either pause or stop them and go check the other torrents.

Basically, the lowest reasonable number of seeders per downloaders should be 1 seeder per 1 downloader. Less than that will make downloads very slow."
,veerenski,2010-10-03T16:57Z,"Note:

If you do not speak Hindi, there is no need to download the

I'm surprised off all the experts out there, no one has yet proposed how to get this torrent placed on a super fast server or some so that downloaders are not dependent on my uploading speed which is usually 200K/sec.

Hi. It is good to travel if you have any interest and have a clue of what you are looking for and can afford it.

As for seeding and torrents, sorry, I disagree with the way it is packaged in video and discourses in Hindi. It is simply an unnecessary overhead.

But you did do a good job generally and it was pretty smart to package it as it was.

Not to worry, I know what I am doing and things are working just fine, thanks to you to a large extend.

As to fast seeding, do a search on google for web seed. But there are some problems with that approach. I do not have time or desire to get into it right now. Basically, I suggest you do not worry to be a single seeder. Torrent program, as was said before, was specifically designed to distribute max. amount of copies with min. amount of resources.

These torrents are seeded not too bad even right now and there are no reasons to believe it is going to get worse.

Again, it is a cooperative effort. Just trust. No need to ""carry the weight of the world"" on your shoulders. BG (Bodhidharba) told me once:
Why do you even bother to help all these people? They get exactly what they deserve. No matter how much you give them, they'll still shit on it. I do not exactly agree with his position. But it is something to pay attention to.

You are right.
It is amazing how it works. I am forever surprised when things like this happen.
At critical times, all of a sudden, things work.

So...

What we have here is a message received from Zionazis from someone, who signed it as Vivarto, which is a sannyas name.

There is a sannyasin Vit Vivarto and you can do a search on him on http://oshosearch.net site.
Or google for him.

It was a ZioNazi threat. And those threats you need to learn to pay attention to because their slogan is:

""We never forgive,
and we never forget"".

The contents of that message was unquestionable a ZioNazi threat, a trademark signature.

I know these suckers. Had to deal with them on quite a few occasions. So, when they tell you things like they told me, you better pay attention.

Because that is a final warning...

They do not like to repeat their warnings.

The next step is a cemetery in their game.

So, we had to do some things, just to make sure.

Here is his ""message"":

Look. This is very simple:
It is one thing to be an idiot you are.
But it is a totally different thing when you try to get into someones face.

Do I have to explain?

Ok, the first thing is this:

""Blink leading the blind are BOUND to fall into a ditch"",

and that is about ALL I need to say...
But, knowing who you are I will explain:

1) This is not your private kitchen to dictate who is to do what here.

2) Torrents, once released, belong to no one.
They belong to ANYONE who is willing to bother about it.

3) If you have some kind of a ""mission"" related to Chandra Mohan, shove it up your output hole. I could care less.

4) The very fact you are trying to dictate something to others means what?

You see, you sound exactly like that Vivarto ZioNazi, fabricating crap and of the lowest grade.

Are you Vivarto?

Do you have GUTS?
Because that is what Osho says:

In order to know That Which Is, the MAIN thing is you need GUTS.

Get out of my way and never, under any circumstances, cross my path.
Because I do not like animals of your kind.
You stink too much and my nose in sensitive.
