Here's a sidepack from me as I've mentioned and described in my previous torrent.

The ultimate emoticon pack for emoticon lovers and user, compiled, collected and packed into a rar by me. Gathered from various and the most humorous artists, websites and forums. Enjoy ;D

An emoticon is a textual expression representing the face of a writer's mood or facial expression. For example, :), :(, and :D. They are often used to alert a responder to the tenor or temper of a statement, and can change and improve interpretation of plain text. The word is a portmanteau of the English words emotion (or emote) and icon. In web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called emoticons as well. Examples of widely known emoticons are the smiley face :) and the frowny face :(and also the googly eyes face 8) and the wink face ;)

The use of emoticons can be traced back to the nineteenth century and were commonly used in casual/humorous writing.

Did you know the first time they were invented and used was back in 19 september 1982? IN TELEGRAPHS! ;]
