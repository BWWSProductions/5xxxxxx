FLAC sound is the only way to go nowadays, mp3s just dont cut it anymore. Help spread the word!

There are far too many uninformed, ignoramuses here on pirate bay still ripping their cds using 320kbs MP3 which is pointless unless your computer has like 200 gigs of ram, a number very low by today's standards. You can buy massive amounts of external harddrive memory for chump change.

Heres to seeing all of the music on PB available in FLAC! This is the only true way to listen to your music! "

I had been looking for this in stores since long but mine being a small town, couldn't find one! And, I don't like the quality of MP3s as they generally distort the sound. Gonna burn Audio CDs using these FLACs. Thanks again!!"
,eddie864,2011-02-28T05:03Z,"Flacs might sound better (although I dunno if they do) but I do know that my music player, phone and car stereo won't play flac or ogg.  That leaves the various less common formats and mp3's that they do play.  VHS won over Betamax yet Betamax was better. "
