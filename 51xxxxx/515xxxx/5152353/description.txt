Original Air Dateâ€”7 February 2000

Kitty sends reluctant Red over to invite the Pinciottis for another scrabble evening, but his accidentally seeing Bob without his never before mentioned hair-piece gives them all a focus, except brain-dead Midge. Jackie plans a grand party at her posh home, so she wouldn't even invite 'lowlifes' Fez and Hyde, but Kelso not only falls to live up to her high society fantasies, as Donna expected, the simple gentleman invites his friends anyway- and thirty others, reasoning the more, the merrier, even Hyde and the popular school floozy Kat Paterson, who ignores her lover blatantly in 'cool' company. Donna encourages Eric to loosen up, but such company as Timmy who 'sets the mood' by dropping his trousers makes even him go overboard: Jackie's absurd classy teenager party dream turns nightmare, and the bitch blames poor Michael, whose attempt to break it up proves disastrous in itself...

While Red grudgingly accepts to be best man, Kitty is so disappointed Midge didn't ask her as one of the three bridesmaids - she never was one- that when Leo, whom Hyde subcontracted as photographer, hits the sack with bridesmaid Holly, Kitty grabs her chance, and the green-gold dress. After the fire Kelso gets bitched at by both his lovers, but ends up proving his romantic value to Jackie.

Original Air Dateâ€”28 February 2000

Kelso and Hyde are amazed to see a steamy car contains a couple making out: Fez and Steven's ex Patty. Neither admits it, but Jackie is jealous too, as Fez used to court her in vain and now pays her no attention, so she takes it out on Michael for not writing her poems like Fez does for Patty. Kitty wants to spend time with her baby boy, so Red, who realizes at that age no boy wants to be seen with his parents, tells her 'we pay his bills, we own him' and forces him, enthusiastically encouraged by eternal liar Hyde, to join her at a pizzeria, where crazy kid Timmy cries out aloud 'Eric is on a date with his mama', and a Woodie Allen Movie, torture because most scenes contain sex or drugs.
