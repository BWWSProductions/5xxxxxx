,Ci2USH,2009-11-14T00:25Z,"NEW FLASH .... IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS GAME OR ANY OTHER BURNED COPY YOU PLAY... NOTHING IS STEALTHED RIGHT NOW TILL c4eva COMES OUT WITH HIS NEW FIRMWARE iXTREME Lite Touch.

It is simply MS has teamed up with ""punkbusters"" and now can detect you drive being modded.... So regardless on what and when you play online if the system goes online you will for sure be banned, no questions asked.

I went and paid for COD 6 and played online and have not played a burnt game in over 6 months with current firmware being 1.6 on my system and no bad copy (according to ABGX v1.0.1) and sad to say I got the ban hammer last night.

So I pulled some strings last night and found out no matter what if you have a FLASHED DRIVE AND PLAY ONLINE, EVEN IF ITS LIKE ONCE A MONTH YOU WILL BE BANNED FOR SURE.

so Happy Gaming and Happy Pirating"

,sammaful,2009-11-15T04:06Z,"@ Ci2USH
the problem is not with the firmware as c4eva has also already said that the current firmware is undectable the only way microsoft could detect the firmware is to put the disk drive in recovery mode whic wold make the tray open and close 2 or 3 times so you would know they were remotly testing your firmware the problem has been with abgx v1.01 
as stated in xbox-scene.com there was corruption in there online database so some of the games went patched proberly even if you did patch them properly this problem has now been resolved with v 1.02 released this week
also it doesnt matter if you havent played any copys in months the nand chip records information about the games code and reports what youve been playing back to microgay and if the files dont match there database they flag your console and watch it over the course of months to see how many violations are made then when a dash update comes they do a ban wave or in the current climate a flood lol
is ok to download these games at the moment and wait for abgx verification which im gonna do but also wait for the new firmware aswel"

,ChappoIan,2009-11-25T01:57Z,"Am I the only one having the stutter problem?
Is there anyone else having the same problem?
Is there a solution?

I will explain how to get this to work:

Option 1.
Upgrade your iXtreme firmware to iXtreme 1.61 (So you will be able to play wave 4 games)

Option 2.
1.  Upgrade your iXtreme firmware to iXtreme 1.5, 1.51 or 1.6
2.  Burn the activation disc that came with the firmware. (If you got your xbox 360 flashed by someone else, ask him to give you a copy of the activation disc).
3.  Put in the activation disc and play it.
4.  Eject the activation disc and put in Assasins Creed 2. It should work.

With both options I would not recommend playing on Xbox Live. Even when it should be save with iXtreme 1.61.

BUT IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN HELP ME WITH THE STUTTER PROBLEM?
I USE iXtreme 1.61 AND WHEN I PLAY THE GAME IT STUTTERS, DOES WEIRD STUFF AND THE AUDIO LAGS!

So, is there anyone who can explain me how to fix the stutter, lag problem?
Or is there anyone having the same problem?

Thank you!"

You should just open one of the files using winRAR. I know it doesn't do it by itself. One way is to double-click, open file with existing program and chose winRAR.
