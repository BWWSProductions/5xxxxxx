    your dvd drive)

how do i install? it asks for a steam activation key.."
,.dot,2009-11-10T19:26Z,"The Rzr1911 release is NUKED, you still need Steam running and be logged in to a valid account for this to work and Valve will stop this soon.

Go for the SKIDROW instead!

,.dot,2009-11-11T13:56Z,"@AceGames: Well, at the time i wrote this the Rzr1911 release needes u to have Steam running and be logged in into a valid Steam acc.

And i know myself what a bother it is when u discover that you have either downloeaded a nuked or otherwise failed release when all you really wana do is play.

This happend to me many times (eg. dl a release that turened out to be nuked or needed like 4 progrs running to play) so all i wana do is help some pll here.

So, i dont know why my postings offended you, this was clearly not my intention.

BTW: Here is your non-Steam patch for the Rzr1911 release: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5156688/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_Razor_Release_NO_STEAM_PATCH-ReUni"

,nitro4004,2009-11-12T16:29Z,"Razor releases are really starting to piss me off. Especially with the bullshit they tried to pull with the Borderlands release and the fact I've noticed a few of their releases actually having trojans in them. Not something I have full trust in anymore, that's for damn sure. I'm going to give the Skidrow release a try first instead of this (I have both downloaded, thank God for unlimited bandwidth.)"
,FTL3,2009-11-13T15:28Z,"FTL3 presents the an updated crack by SKIDROW:

This update fixes some issues with the previous SKIDROW and razor1911 cracks with regards to STEAM and bugs. For most people it would probably seem the same. Enjoy!

Note: this crack doesn't require steam.

,xiIix,2009-11-15T21:40Z,"Nitro, Razor1911 has been around for 15+ years, and I've never, ever, not once seen a trojan ion one of their releases. Antivirus software these days do byte by byte checks, and some of the cracks that are used for releases will trip that and throw a false positive. Crackers are sick and fucking tired of people yelling trojan when in fact there isn't.

If you've downloaded a release from a well known group that has been around since the beginning, and your AVS flags the crack as a trojan, it's a false positive. Go ahead and analyze it. You'll never see it access internet."
