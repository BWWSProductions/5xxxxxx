Performing live at Poole's Lighthouse Theatre, Jethro's brand new show is packed with side-splitting observations on life and hilarious sketches.



Jethro takes a look at life, as only he can, and shares the benefits of going out with a homeless girl to his experiences at a deaf and dumb dance. Discover the true meaning of ram raiding in Wales and find out what Denzil Penberthy's been up to - from meeting a sniffer dog to having an out-of-this-world sexual experience.



This latest portion of the daft and barmy features Jethro at his belly-laughing best!
