Thirty years in Spider-Man's future, New York is a relatively safe zone, although it is under control of its Mayor. Super criminals are a thing of the past, but the authoritarian government utilizes a merciless police force, "The Reign".

The series has been compared to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, a comparison which Marvel has also quoted when promoting Reign.[1] As well as the thematic similarities between the two stories, both of which revisit aged heroes after the end of their careers, The Dark Knight Returns is also acknowledged within the pages of Reign by the inclusion of a character named Miller Janson (the name reflects Dark Knight Returns creators Frank Miller and Klaus Janson).
