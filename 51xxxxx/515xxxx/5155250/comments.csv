,Mantuxsaz,2009-11-14T12:32Z,"Hello Guys! I'm not certainly sure if the game is working, but i might be able to help some of you.

Richyman4ever ->>  Your xbox firmware is too old i guess. All you can do, is to flash your xbox 360 with new firmware, or repatch the game by yourself. I'm not quite sure which wave this game has, but it's probably wave 4, because all the new games uses it. I don't know which firmware your xbox has either, but you should repatch to wave 3, if you can play a bit older games, if it still doesn't work, you'll have to repatch it again to wave 2. How to do it - it is plenty of quides in google. Just search for it!

P.S. - Don't try to play patched games live. Otherwise you'll get banned.


anthony073 ->> I don't know if it works for all Xbox cansoles, but when it asks to update, select no. Then go to xbox dashboard, and start the game manually (just click on ""play disc""). It should be worth to try, anyway you won't lose anything, so give a try. I'll play my games like that. :)


Good luck to you guys, for further help - just make a post here, so i'll try to reply as fast as possible. ;) "
