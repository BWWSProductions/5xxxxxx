,Majick,2010-01-12T08:25Z,"Surprisingly good quality for the size, just a slight blur to it, not sure if they're the shortened version, if so it's not really noticeable, totally worth the DL.

A: 10
V: 7

Tyvm for the up! Will seed!"
,thepolice911,2010-05-22T00:07Z,"The Quality is fine for portable devices, however some muppet has cut several scenes out of every episode. Some are are unwatchable as you can't follow the plot (and I know the stories well). Look else where. No seeding as I've deleted it already. "
