MysteryQuest - S01E08 - Jack the Ripper
Airdate 11/11/09

In one of the earliest documented serial murder cases, five prostitutes in the Whitechapel district of London were found brutally murdered with throats slashed and bodies mutilated. All the deaths were attributed to one man: Jack the Ripper. Never solved, the accepted theory is that the killer was a local madman. Now, 120 years later new evidence indicates two surprising new theories: the killer might have been a woman, or the killer was not English, but American. MysteryQuest's team of experts heads to London to follow these leads and examine the evidence first hand.
