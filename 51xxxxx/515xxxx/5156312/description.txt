This week's Indie Music Show takes you to a Goth fashion show at Crash Mansion in New York City. While Goth may be considered to be an alternative lifestyle there are a lot of interesting designs on display.

Providing music for the event were three bands; Pillow Theory, One False Move and Swear On Your Life. All three bands rocked and it is worth watching the show just for the music even if you aren't particularly drawn to tattooed girls in latex.

Unfortunately technical difficulties prevented me from getting good footage of One False Move, so I apologize to them and will be sure to do a shoot with them in the near future to make up for it.
