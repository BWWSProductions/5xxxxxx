,armygreen,2009-11-30T13:25Z,"Great up, but I just finished downloading myst masterpiece edition and installed and it's not working.  It starts up and I get sound and the cursor, but no other visuals.  I've opened it in all windows compatibilities and it doesn't work in any of them.  Does anyone have any ideas about fixing this problem?  I'll post any info you need to help."
,hooptie,2009-12-01T07:47Z,I had the same problem.
,DragonBice,2009-12-06T02:50Z,Same problem as the two other guys. Please help us fix this :\
,DragonBice,2009-12-06T14:39Z,"I know how to solve the problem now :D

You have to DOWNGRADE QuickTime to the version that comes with the torrent. Go to control panel ---> Add/Remove programs ---> Select QuickTime and remove it ---> Install the version from the torrent.

Do that and it should work fine, no need for any compatability modes or resolution changes."
,unknowndeviant11,2009-12-08T05:36Z,"That's rather awkward; never got that far. Sorry for that, guys."
,DragonBice,2009-12-08T14:30Z,"Well, I just finished MYST (it was a lot easier this time around than when I was like, nine-ten years old^^) and I started with RIVEN. 1st of all, I had to put RIVEN in compatability mode for Windows 95 (unlike MYST, which is kind of weird...) to be able to start it once installed. However, I encountered another problem while trying to save my game; I hit ""Save Game"" and the RIVEN closes. In the ""Readme.txt"" file, in the ""Troubleshooting"" section, there's a line saying: ""Due to improvements made to the game, saved games from the 
CD-ROM version of Riven can not be used by the DVD-ROM version."". I have no clue whatsoever if this has anything to do with the problem at hand though. Does anyone have any thoughts on this or am I the only one experiencing this problem?

/Bice"
,DragonBice,2009-12-21T07:25Z,"OK, I know of a way that would probably get rid of all problems with running RIVEN (and alot of other old games) on ""newer"" PC's.

1. Download and install Virtual PC 2007
2. Download and install Windows 98 - !! ON THE VIRTUAL COMPUTER CREATED WITH VIRTUAL PC !!
3. Install RIVEN on the virtual machine
4. Play, have fun!

In most cases, you don't have to do this but I had problems with saving my game and my problem was quite rare and I couldn't find anyone (and I certainly looked) that had the same problem and fixed it with success. If you have tried everything and still experience problems, this is a good last resort option."

Any clue?
HELP PLEASE >."
,L-jakim,2010-06-27T15:22Z,"@Colapse, I don't claim to be any computer expert of any kind, definitely not Macs. But are you sure you've mounted the iso file (With Daemon tools/magiciso) when you try to run the game? Because that should function as a virtual DVD being inserted."

,MerseaParadise,2011-03-14T21:27Z,"USELESS TORRENT. REQUIRES SERIAL NUMBER. 
Do NOT DOWNLOAD
Do NOT SEED!"
,MerseaParadise,2011-03-14T22:16Z,"COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. DOESN'T WORK. DON'T DOWNLOAD, DON'T SEED!"
,zacrilege,2011-03-16T14:33Z,"MerseaParadise: Did you read any of the readme files? Or the comments? Or the instructions in the description?  This torrent works fine and comes with everything neccessary to play these games.  If it's not working for you, then you aren't following the instructions carefully enough, or haven't tried any of the many options that other users have mentioned.  I realize the irony of this comment being more of a waste of my own time, but I don't think you should discourage others from downloading this; moreover, if anyone has enough of a desire to play these games (as I did) they will find the determination to get them to work (as I did)."
,kibbles0515,2011-04-16T06:29Z,"Some notes: if you are running Mac OS X, you'll need to download Riven X (to play Riven).  I'm not sure if Myst will work, but I can't seem to get Exile to work; it refuses to detect the disc image."
,denbal87,2011-05-01T05:35Z,"@DragonBice
You are right! I couldn't get Exile work on my vista, but it worked when I installed an XP with Virtual PC! Thanks!"
,Estariae,2011-05-19T09:45Z,"@kibbles0515
In the instructions for installing on a Mac, you have to copy the ""data"" folder into a new folder named ""Exile DVD"" that needs to be in the ""Myst III"" folder you were instructed to make.
The path should be:
 /Myst III/Exile DVD/data

and NOT
/Myst III/data

Hope it helps"
,MadTogger,2011-05-24T14:41Z,"I had the same issue as a lot of people when trying to play MYST, black screen, hand cursor & sound only.
Tried lots of different fixes that didn't work but finally found one that did.

Take a look at this webpage:-

http://www.mystcommunity.com/board/index.php?/topic/29165-myst-masterpiece-edition-on-xp-help-please-black-screen/

Look for post #13 by Joyrock. Don't bother following all the instructions about compatibility tab etc, didn't work for me, just download the attached file.

Open your Windows/System32 folder and rename QuickTime.qts to QuickTime.qts.old and then copy the QuickTime.qts from the attachment into the System32 folder.

That is all I needed to do, nothing else and it works fine now.

It has something to do with iTunes using the newer QuickTime but even after doing this fix my iTunes is working perfectly.

Bear in mind that when iTunes updates this .qts file may get overwritten.

By the way my OS is Windows XP Pro SP3"

You are incorrect this torrent works fine if you follow the instructions and advice...

Thanks Unknowndeviant for this I have this game on order at present but wanted to remember what it was like I have 3 and 4 already.

I am having a little bother saving my game and it does seem to crash when I try to get to channel wood just after entering the code into the safe and lighting the furnace can anyone help with either of these problems please

Thanks "

It works!"

,jscherfjr,2011-08-20T19:52Z,"First off, let me say . . . great upload.  This is amazing.  I just recently started reading the books and wanted to replay the games.  A huge shout-out to unknowndeviant11.

Other than that . . . is anyone else having a problem with Myst freezing up when you get to the light-house to enter the code?

I tried different compatibilities (only thing I could think of) but that didn't work.  Any suggestions?"
,osetinka,2011-08-23T10:34Z,"Hey, if anyone has any problems running it on windows 7, run it in 256 colors. thats what i did and i works great"
,malachai32,2011-10-19T20:23Z,Installed all three and they seem to run OK under Windows 7 x64 without a compatability mode. Had to install QuickTime from the first Myst game though. Thanks for upload.
,malachai32,2011-11-02T14:11Z,"Spoke too soon. It locked up when I pulled the levers in the clock tower. I had to install the QuickTime files in the QuickTime 4 patch by following the link on this webpage:

,a_of,2012-03-14T19:08Z,"Thanks.
I played the original Myst and then Riven several years ago. So many good memories.
I wanted to see how Myst III is. Let's check it."
,TucoTruths,2012-06-27T14:48Z,"Thank you for sharing this.

I'm running Win7 64 bit.  MadTogger's suggestion worked for me.  The only thing I had to do differently was drop those two files in the c:\WindowsSysWOW64 directory rather than the system32 folder.

Clock Tower hang up no more.  "
