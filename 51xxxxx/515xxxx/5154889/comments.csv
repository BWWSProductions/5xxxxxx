,w1sl0,2010-03-02T20:11Z,"lol, some fucker from microsoft given me activation code, thx "
,stromam,2010-03-11T22:15Z,"definitely works, just like the instruction file says"
,ahammelo,2010-03-19T05:45Z,"Works great!! Just follow the instructions - the license code is written in the instructions, but you need to call the automatic Microsoft activation centre. When they are asking for your activation ID - just continue and use the help function the voice is offering - No problem at all!!

Just switch off the ""send number"" function on your cellphone if this worries you

Thx!!!!"
,w1sl0,2010-03-19T10:23Z,"it is not automated in all countries ! dont be surprised... but no problem, they still give u activation code"
,Wundermutt,2010-06-02T03:59Z,The chick on the phone says the activation key is invalid.
,rum.police,2010-06-10T11:17Z,Key no longer active. Phoned through as advised. Message - Key no longer valid
,YoItsLittlejohn,2010-09-29T23:15Z,"So the installation went great and it worked great for awhile, but I didn't turn off automatic updates after installing. An update came through that made the visio invalid and close every time I opened it. So I deleted Visio and went to re-install using the same files from you that I used last time and it throws an error half way through installation and closes. Is there a way that I can undo what the update has done?"
,lacacalac,2011-02-11T02:10Z,The phone activation number is no longer valid. Any alternative way of completing installation? Thank you so much for all your effort.
,ItsPete,2011-09-28T23:48Z,"thingy, this worked perfectly. I'm running Win 7 Ultimate, and have a legal version of Office Pro 2010 installed. I followed the instructions and copied the mso.dll to both locations. After opening Visio I was not prompted to activate. I clicked Help, Activate Product and was pleasantly surprised to see a popup that the product was already activated.

GREAT work!"
