IWork '05 Installer complete with code. Includes "Pages" and "Keynote".  It's compatible with both Panther and Tiger, haven't tried it with Leopard, but it should work.

iWork contains two great applications for creating stunning, media-rich documents and presentations with ease. iWork includes Pages, a powerful word-processing application, and Keynote version 2.0, a flexible application for producing presentations, interactive slideshows, and more. iWork gives you the tools to express yourself with style.  

Note: Just started using Transmission as my torrent client and I really like it - much quicker than BitTorrent (sorry) and easy to understand.
