Looks like this one doesn't like to run as Portable, not 100% at least. If it doesn't work for you, forget the Portable part and use the installer and crack."

windows 7 64 bit.
working portable , didn't need installation .
Thank you very much NoExcuses ."
,bobamango,2010-01-01T23:01Z,I installed the program and got the crack but when it's scanning it stops and says a file is missing and quits out. NoExcuses did you miss something or is it a seeder that messed it up?
,gileswade123,2010-01-05T19:13Z,"Do not let it update, if it offers to update the software then press cancel otherwise it will no longer be a registered version.

Ohh and thankyou very much by the way :)"
,donkeydick121,2010-01-24T02:30Z,Great software. Really takes care of your system. Haven't tried the portable yet. No problem with updating as it stays registered (so gileswade123 is wrong). I have two other Malware programs installed but this found 24 infections that the other two didn't !!

But please excuse me for I really do not quite understand the difference between aso3'portable' and the aso3setup.exe . Still thanks a lot as this works really fine. I chose to install with the setup.exe as I really didn't know what the aso3'portable' was. The crack worked perfect and aso3 became a registered version.
Still I cannot rate aso3 as a excellent utility software because some utilities does not work. There is a tool called the 'Driver Updater'. It detected 3 outdated drivers on my laptop but it was not able to update and install the updated drivers.
Still aso3 is a perfect all-in-one utility software. It is a improved version of the previous aso softwares. This is a file worth downloading. So NoExcuses(...excuse me for this long comment...), very many thanks for the upload."
