,nofx98,2009-11-12T14:30Z,Oh yea i forgot to tell.it's tested on Acekard 2i with akaio 1.5 firmware
,Roms_FTW,2009-11-17T03:40Z,"Uhhhh does this work on M3DS REAL?
or not? i want to play so bad"
,nofx98,2009-11-19T14:41Z,Didn't try with that one cuz of i don't own one.it'll work okay with latest firmware i think but it has a CP in it.You can't play it with friends on WFC.You can fix that with a patch or download the already patched rom from piratebay
,meccoy,2010-01-07T12:51Z,it dosent work on M3DS real or so it seems anyway can only start the game once and play untill the first dialog with the redheaded girl ends in the beginning after that its just a blank white screen if anyone knows whats causing this please help me out
,meccoy,2010-01-07T13:28Z,"nevermind my last coment 
M3i Zero & M3DS Real System V4.7c X (Europe/USA/Asia) should do the trick, 
thanks yall anyway,"
