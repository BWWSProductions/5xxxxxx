,jrzy7783,2010-12-07T05:16Z,Downloading this because Solaris was awesome.  Thanks for the upload.
,farenaza,2011-03-12T17:01Z,Can someone explain to me how can I download subtitles pleaseee? All tarkovsky movies have been downloaded without subts... Thanks to the good samaritan!  
,2big_2fail,2011-03-24T02:12Z,The way I use subtitles is as follows: Give the subtitle file the exact same name as the video file and place or copy it to the same folder. Make sure your video player has subtitles enabled. Good luck.

Great upload! Just one problem, i donĂÂ´t find ESP or FR subs. Does anyone knows where to find them? three hours of russian translated into english in this kind of movie is simply impossible ;)
Thx in advance!"

,m.nt83,2012-01-30T22:01Z,"though i am using the last vlc version and could detect the subtitles in the video menu, they are not showing up during the movie. does anyone knows how to fix this idx subtitles ? srt works fine but i couldn't find french language..."
,tylerdean,2012-05-22T00:31Z,Was this filmed in mono? Because I'm only seeing one audio channel here. I'd hate to miss out on the stereo effect if it is available...
,weezzle,2012-05-22T12:51Z,"@tylerdan, it's in the description:

Naturally this rip has the original mono audio track, which is better than the new remastered 5.1 audio track."
,dream7184,2012-06-01T10:01Z,Excellent movie. Thank you. And the subtitles work just fine with VLC anyway.
,cebo2,2012-07-10T01:51Z,Thanks a lot!!!
