[T],kriss_kringle,2009-11-12T17:34Z,"Stop trolling man.Like I said,the links you're giving are for a bluray.This is a BRRip.How hard is it to read?"
[V],-jonny-,2009-11-12T18:18Z,so what is the difference then?
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-11-12T18:31Z,I have to explain to you because you don't seem to get it. There are dvds and dvdrips.There are blurays and bluray rips.In a bluray rip you have a much better quality than a dvdrip and you can also burn it on a dvd and watch it on a HDTV.I hope I made myself clear it's no rocket science man.
[T],zeromancer,2009-11-13T00:30Z,"stop trying to defend yourself kriss. jonnys link is to a BD rip too. get with the program and stop uploading BD rip with a bit rate of 1300kbps, the quality is shit. keep it above 4000, or better still above 6000 for a 1080p rip."
[T],kriss_kringle,2009-11-13T03:00Z,BDRip at 7.97 gb??Are you kiddin' me?

,Widowlicker,2010-02-08T19:47Z,"Thank you very much for this great movie kriss_kringle. I love your list of torrents.
A good thing someone stopped with those stupid old fashioned rar's and low avi-resolutions.
Thumbs up for your work on this.

Video 10 / audio 10 / movie 10

I already had bought the commercial version of Fearless on DVD some time ago. No directors cut. 
But that was an English spoken one. Now I have this movie in the original Chinese language.
I cannot buy this version in my home country. Now I have it in my collection. Again, thanks for this.

Thanks for seeding people. Of course, will seed as well. "

Looking good anyway."
,Douglas_Quaid,2011-09-28T02:18Z,"Yeah right what...? BRRip just means the source was a blu-ray, nothing more.

Thanks for the upload kriss."
,snowbirds,2012-04-29T07:19Z,"careful y'all.   one of those subtitle links is a trojan.  I don't remember which one I clicked, but it downloaded an .exe file, which Malwarebytes is flagging as a trojan.  

Don't open any subtitle that comes in an .exe file. 

Subtitle should be .srt

good luck...."
