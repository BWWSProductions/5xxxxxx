Thanks.   Had a right job getting this.   I had to piece this together from various sources.   
   And while you are here I must thank you for your Muddy Waters At Newport upload.   I'd managed to lose my copy of that album.   So it was nice to be able to find a copy so readily.
   Keep up with the good uploads.   Cheers, bro."
