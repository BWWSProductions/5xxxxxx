,garthbartin,2009-11-11T18:08Z,"Religion is fail. It's an archaic belief. 

You can't argue with the geniuses of our time modern technology. 

Religion believed the world was just a few thousand years old. Carbon dating and geology has smashed that to pieces.

They thought the Earth was flat, guess who was right there?

They thought the heart was the center of emotion (because emotions seem to cause pains in your chest) scientists believed the brain was the center. (because they had dissected dead bodies and studied both the heart and brain)

Religion (and everybody in general) believed that flies came from rotting meat (because wherever there was rotting meat there were flies)  a scientist proved otherwise through an experiment so simple a 10 year old could have done it.

Listen to us and do what we say or burn in hell for eternity doesn't sound like encouraging freedom.

Science is logic and reason, religion is stubbornness and faith.

Maybe when there are actually some seeders for this I will dl simply so I can make more fun of religion."
[T],verifire,2009-11-12T12:04Z,"I've always enjoyed the liberty of speech here on TPB, but sometimes wish I was at liberty to speak what I really felt, and succeed in doing so..

I've put up so many things, including this torrent, that explains - step by step - how flawed the anti -christ ""retorics"" are.

I've provided modern science and loads of things that ought to draw those who see it closer to getting a more humble heart, but some people just repeat the same, old claims every time I put something up.

At least the words ""retard"" and ""moron"" have more or less disappeared, but only to give way for the ""learned approach"" in the above ""comment"" from ""garthbartin"" and his likes. 

They reveal nothing new, and in fact only discloses that they haven't kept up with the recent (and I mean like the last 50 years) research on this area. They're stuck in a mind-warp, and are really not to blame. It's their company or their choice of what to watch and what they want to think that rules them, and sometimes not even that. They are ""Systemites"", in lack of a better word to sum-up, and need to go out on a limb, both intellectually and physically if they are to catch up. I suggest starting with going down my list of uploads and actually downloading some research TO WATCH IT! I promise: If they do, nobody will mock them for being retards. Not in our camp..

,Lagomare,2009-11-13T01:56Z,"One shouldn't be surpriced that the facts listed in this book is carefully chosen. Interesting enough there are other scientists that have a lot of other sorts of facts they want to tell us about.

Why not read some books of Bart D. Ehrman, born in a christian family, still an active christian? He is also a respected scientist. ""Jesus interrupted"" is the one book that I find especially interesting. I won't tell you what it says. If you want to know, you will be able to find out. If you don't won't to know, I will not be able to make you.

A few words about me. Please not believe that I am a atheist. I am indeed not. Neither do I hate christians. I find it to be very important though that the truth be known - All the truth and not only the convenient parts!"
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-14T12:19Z,Thanks m8!  Keep it up!
[T],verifire,2009-11-16T23:35Z,"@big_dad_e: Sure will. :-)

@Lagomare: Here's the bottom line in the ""Christian"" Mr Ehrman's book: ""Misquoting Jesus"", as described in uploaded e-book:

""Ehrman recounts his personal experience with the study of the Bible and textual criticism. He summarizes the history of textual criticism, from the works of Desiderius Erasmus to the present. The book describes an early Christian environment in which the books that would later compose the New Testament were copied by hand, mostly by Christian amateurs. Ehrman concludes that various early scribes altered the New Testament texts in order to deemphasize the role of women in the early church, to unify and harmonize the different portrayals of Jesus in the four gospels, and to oppose certain heresies (such as Adoptionism). Ehrman contends that certain widely-held Christian beliefs, such about the divinity of Jesus, are associated not with the original words of scripture but with these later alterations.""

So he's certainly very much a ""Christian"". Only ""He did it hiiiiis way.."" When the divinity of Jesus is taken away from the perfect plan of God, then what's left is a mockery, an empty shell.

Luckily, we can all draw our conclusions, but unfortunately some draw the wrong ones.

Which remind me of a true story, it happened in a Christian group I was associated with once upon long ago. I remember one man standing there, and I quote:

""If they could prove to me that Jesus never existed today, and that I have been believing a lie for the last twenty years, I would still remain a Christian, because my life has become such a wonderful life since I started following His teachings""."
[T],verifire,2009-11-16T23:54Z,"Oh, and would you believe it: With a little bit of imagination and seeing it before you, so to speak [which is an ability most people ""grow out of"", sadly], it's IMPOSSIBLE to say that Jesus ""deemphasized the role of women"". Among those who followed Him both before and after the Crucifixion were many women! Mary, for instance, the sister of Martha, was so devoted to Jesus thet nearly every time she is mentioned, she throws herself before him, or anoints Him, or sits at His feat. Sinners and tax collectors kept close to Him, it says. What does that tell you about how lovable He was/is?

And the Mary that seven evil spirits had come out of, Magdalene, was actually the first one to see the risen Jesus. Really touching scene there in the end of the Gospel of John.., :-)

True enough, the book of Ehrman says ""the early church"" did so, but that's pretty much out on a limb too. All you have to do is watch ""the Case for Christ"", and you'll see that that claim is actually not substantiated by any means even today.

Only things to add are for instance when a husband sometimes thinks he's entitled to respect no matter how bad he behaves. In stead he should treat his wife with the respect she's entitled too, and then she'd naturally respect him back..

Things like that are actually described (prescribed?) to perfection in what Ehrman calls a flawed book..

But please, believe what makes you useful and happy. I use the Bible to let God's Holy Spirit make me able to do that.. So I won't rely on Mr. Ehrman. I trust you understand my stand.

Love, V."

,ctk8086,2009-11-25T05:56Z,"you seem awfully gung-ho about defending this book.  i believe that says more about you than it does about this book.

it's nice that you check out the works of noted atheists, however my main point of contention is simply this- there have been historians and scholars who disclaim the bible even though there are some historic places that have been found to actually exist.  the reasons for that have never been based on reasons of proven fact.  your defensive claims are coming off as very petty and also logically false.  from reading what you are saying here and what this book claims:

place exists in bible
jesus exists in bible
jesus performed miracles in bible
place in bible discovered by historians
therefore because place actually existed, every claim made in the bible is true.

it completely ignores the WHY of why these people criticize the bible, its claims don't follow the scientific method and the people defending it don't use the SM in making their case.  they also very rarely use second and third seperate sources in defense.  they only use one source, a book written by men and whose seperate books were VOTED upon and included and excluded for political means.  which is why it is probably such a big hit in conservative circles.  they don't like implementing the scientific method either.   they also tend to not use second or third outside sources and do things for political means instead of the betterment of everyone."
,]eep,2009-11-27T03:49Z,"thanks for the upload. Looks very interesting (me like politically incorrect, like; you can speak the truth even if it is inconvenient).

@ctk8086: if you say: 
""your defensive claims are coming off as very petty and also logically false. from reading what you are saying here and what this book claims:

place exists in bible
jesus exists in bible
jesus performed miracles in bible
place in bible discovered by historians

then you are either misunderstanding or falsely accusing of faulty logic. Which is either sad or despicable. 

It should read:
improbable eyewitness story recorded
unknown places, animals and civilization mentioned
[your place in eternity mentioned]
interwoven the future foretold in history (immediate, close, far)
prophet killed by law if even 1 prediction fails
[your rescueplan executed]
place found and dated
animal remains found
civilization found
eyewitness accounts cross referenced
old manuscripts found and dated
[make your choice]

What archaeological facts are showing is that the written down eyewitness accounts as written in the bible are reliable. This is the a search for truth that is permissible in court as well as in science. However it only shows probability, not fact. As eyewitness accounts usually do. 

Of the miracles performed by Jesus there aren't  any physical and tangible remains that could be dug out somewhere. Of Moses however there are visible remains. Those are even 1400y older, but are kept secret in Arabia (the only ones more rabid in covering up archaeological truths than 'scientists' are muslims I guess).  And then there's the remains of the ark in Turkey which is even older. Or the human footsteps that have been found in dinosaur footprints which are older still. Or the Tyrannosaur thighbone that contained soft bone-marrow tissue. But in your view that wouldn't count as evidence does it? Because it's not accepted by the ""scientific community"". Or needing a 'new' explanation.

And if all that isn't good enough as evidence there is even better proof. The bible says so anyway, there is ""the more sure word of prophesy"". If you can research the age of a manuscript (say Isiah) that can predicts 200y ahead with accuracy the name of an emperor of an empire that didn't even exist then, the way it conquers the supposed unconquerable city including the exact date, casualties etc. So something really, really REALLY unlikely. An you can verify the place, date name by finding an ancient chronicle and you can verify the old prophecies too, you have something way more sure than a few eyewitness accounts. 

BTW, the same prophet (and other) made even more prophecies even more accurate about Jesus (>600). So these eyewitness accounts also verify those prophecies leaving us with a very strong case for the truth.

But if you don't want to believe it, you don't want to believe it. The problem is you either want to believe in God or you don't. If you do you want to find out the truth. If you don't you are probably fitting the facts into your world view. Its a shame a lot of christians are doing the very same thing however!

,sandshreder,2009-12-22T19:49Z,"I love how atheists hide behind things like ""science is truth"". well unfortunately the science in the text books is not always accurate or true. in addition it is sometimes a complete lie. moreover any science that may contradict evolution is often left out of textbooks completely. There is a movement in the scientific community to hide anything that discredits evolution. Lets look at some facts...

evolutionists tell you that DNA mutates and we have these improvements in Biological functions.
the FACT is there has never been a mutation observed that was not harmful to a biological process or function.

Now ask yourself these questions...

How did natural selection develop (over millions of years) ears to hear with when life did not and could not know sound existed?

How did natural selection produce eyes when it could NOT know light existed?

How can the first Male and female sex organs develop in two different organisms at the same time AND work together for the first ever mating process? you want me to believe two similar organism just happened to evolve with two different sex organs that just happen to work together to create off spring?

It's true that you shouldn't cast or throw your pearls for dogs and swine, but it's also true that deciding who's who isn't quite as easy as that.

While I do appreciate your thanks, ""sandshreder"", I don't think that ""atheists.. not worth.."" etc. If anyone is to be considered not worth it, I do really think that it should be based on more than simply: ""You don't believe there's a God behind this? Go away.""

,Veovis,2010-04-30T02:07Z,"Ugh, more nonsense and drivel.  It never ceases to amaze me how deeply these religious nuts can bury their heads in the sand of cherry-picked self-affirmation.  A little intellectual honesty goes a long a way in separating out wishful thinking from what can actually be demonstrated as reality.  And in a world where the benefits and honesty of secularism are becoming more and more numerous, more and more apparent, the sheer silliness of these nonsensical religious beliefs also becomes more and more apparent.  Thank goodness we are now living in a time when people can point out how ludicrous these myths are without being burned at the stake.  No wonder religious adherents are in such a panicked frenzy to make sure the masses keep believing in their nonsense.

Anyway, I say to those who pathetically still try to promote religion: keep peddling your hot air.  I hope more and more people _do_ read the bible itself, as well as these loony-toons books talking about its truth and inerrancy.  For any thoughtful person who values truth over wishful thinking, the conclusion is easily reached that the bible is merely the mildly poetic myths of bronze-age goat-herders.  For anyone who wants to see why posting these religious texts online will hasten their demise, search for Thunderfoot's great (semi-viral) video called ""The Internet: Where religions come to die.""
