,Knurk,2010-05-12T23:46Z,"I have no problem with the sound whatsoever, I believe these are just the normal 720p episodes that were put online right after the episodes were shown on tv."
,malrf,2010-06-06T22:36Z,"This isn't HD or 720p, just a normal dvd quality, or normal tv-rip"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-06-18T23:34Z,"Bullshit. The quality is great and definitely HD.

,slyjonas,2010-07-18T15:25Z,I only get speed of 5-15 kB/s. Does everyone have it this slow?
,Bauer84,2010-12-10T22:04Z,"This is NOT 702p, i would not even call this HD. seems like ordinary TV quality to me. the 5.1 sound is also not very good. this one, is REAL quality http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5854381/Breaking.Bad.S02.720p.BluRay.x264-CLUE

the ONLY reason watch this one, is that i cant find any subtitles for the 720p release :(("
,daddyKk,2011-03-17T11:02Z,"This is NOT the 720p version!
Just a tvrip or dvdrip, no more!
Poor sound & image quality...

Normaly, an episode in ""real"" 720p quality = 2,18Go
Here, an episode makes hardly 1Go, Half of real HD720p!

Complete season 2 in 720p = 28Go, this one is only 14Go!
Wtf!"
,WhiteSquall2,2011-03-31T18:09Z,this one has nice quality !!
,ParasiteX,2011-10-12T14:01Z,"Too all you retards calling this good quality... SHUT THE FUCK UP..
Ok the actual quality is shit. It's fucking worse than tvrip and dvd rip even. So do not download this shit stain.."
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-03-25T06:21Z,johncroc... you probably have the audio track set to surround sound in VLC or whatever you're using.  HD rips usually include them.   You need to switch to stereo if you're using headphones and itll sound fine.   Plus with VLC you can boost the volume to 400%.
