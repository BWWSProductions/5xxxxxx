Queen-Complete Kampuchea Concert (2 CDs-FLAC) [tntvillage]

This must be from a very low generation tape, as the sound is superb. This recording showcases Queen in their prime, at the absolute peak of their powers. Most of these renditions of songs are leaps and bounds above the ones heard on Live Killers and, if officially released, could perhaps be up there with the greatest rock live albums of all time. This is essential listening for any fan of rock music.

I'D LIKE TO THANK XUNCAT FOR UPLOADING IT TO MIND WARP PAVILLION
THESE ARE THE INFOS FROM HIS ORIGINAL UPLOAD
Queen - Complete Kampuchea Concert
Live in London, UK, at Hammersmith Odeon, December 26, 1979

Bootleg

Label: Gipsy Eye 137/138
Material from this show has also been released on the bootleg "Crazy Tour". It is, however, incomplete and the sound quality is inferior to this one.

Audio Source: Audience recording

Sound quality: EX - EX+ for an audience recording. 
True lossless files (ripped in burst mode, but that does not affect quality unless there were ripping errors - I have spotted nothing sounding like that in the files). The tracks are expertly mastered, with nicely balanced frequency/amplitude ranges. Quite audible crowd presence that enhances the live feeling without interfering with the clear sound of music.

Lineage: Aud ? > ? > Silver Bootleg > CDR (X) > WAV (EAC) [burst mode] > FLAC (Level 8)

Artwork: Front and back artwork included, 160 DPI.

Number of discs: 2

Total Running Time: 113:51 (70:47 / 43:04)

Info: A classic Queen performance, one of their best! Includes Brian's one time performance of Silent Night during his guitar solo.
