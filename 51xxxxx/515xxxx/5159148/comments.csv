Not sure if it is just my wii though because some of my previous burned games that used to work give me this error. My understanding is that NeogammaR87 betta needs to be used to work on for modchip users. I haven't found how to use this yet though. Will try NTSC version and see if it will run without needing that.

,Bstyles,2009-11-18T12:56Z,"OK... working from DVD Wiikey v1 1.9 with a dashboard 4.1.  PAL of course. This game runs perfect when booted from NeoGamma r8b7. So even with wiikey you will need to softmod your wii. Easy enough, all you need is SD card and this guide. 

http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/16970-new-3-1-4-1-softmod-any-wii.html

within this site you will need to register for the links to work but it is hassle free. I followed the guide today and was playing in no time. I did steps 1 , 3 and 5. Then just launch the game from the NeoGamma r8b7 channel that is created. This bypasses the update on the disc and playes fine. I let the disc update run also just cause i was curious and my wii is still fine. Game still freezes if booted the regular way. But playes perfect from NeoGamma r8b7. Game saves are fine also. READ the guide carefully. It says several times you risk bricking your wii but is safe if you follow every step. Even if it is just 1,3&5 like i did. Take the SD card out after step 5. I am not booting from usb or hard drive. I am using a DVD burn with wiikey v1. Just you need to do all of these steps to softmod NeoGamma r8b7 on so you can boot from it. Enjoy!!!

even my g/f thinks it was worth the 3 nights of burning and research. "

If you have a chip modded wii still follow steps. One of the options of Priiloader (one of the programs u install following directions) is block update from disc. 
This is a must have option! Plus neo gamma is always a plus.
after install disc loads fine from disc channel.

Upgrade Wasabi DX firmware to 3.0 BETA. 
http://www.wasabi.net.cn/downloads.html

After you have upgraded your Wasabi DX modchip to 3.0, download http://www.wasabi.net.cn/BCAfix.zip

Unpack the New Super Mario Bros rar's and touch the .iso image with the BCAfix. 

Burn the touched iso image, insert the disc. The disc included 4.2 update which I had to install (do not install if your Wii is NTSC, if you have PAL it is fine to do that). After the update has completed, your Wii restarts and you can play New Super Mario Bros without a problem :) "

I need som help, pleeeeease...

I use NeoGamma R8Beta15 and placed the included .wip-Patches in SD:/NeoGamma. Now to the first question. Where do I enable ""Search patches""? I thought it was in the Neogamma config menu, but NO...

Where can I find ""Search patches""?

And the second question is if I have to set something else in the Neogamma settings to get this game to work? When playing from a record it hangs after a couple of minutes with an error screen and if starting from an USB harddisc I get the error screen immediately when starting the game.

Anyone who knows how to deal with this???"

A Dos windows appears and tells you its OK. Then burn the file you fixed slowly to a DVD, then it will work.

,drewkrew,2010-01-26T18:06Z,">madmonkey

""Error 002"" is caused by a game requesting to load under a different IOS to what your soft-mod wii is actually trying to run under.
If you are using PreLoader try modifying the hacks: IOS RELOADING - enabled to disabled etc etc

""Error 001"" can often be rectified by burning the iso disc image to DVD+R instead of DVD-R or by changing the installed cIOS revision. Some cIOS revisions have different DIP settings that affect DVD+/-R issues

Hope that helps ya....
