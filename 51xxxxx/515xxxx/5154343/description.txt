Many esteemed filmmakers, including Orson Welles and Terry Gilliam, have tried and failed to launch mammoth adaptations of Miguel de Cervantes' seminal novel Don Quixote de la Mancha. In his feature Honor de Cavalleria, writer/director Albert Serra scales down his approach, with an avant-garde adaptation of two sequences from the book, done in an understated, minimalist style. The primary crux of the motion picture explores the dynamics of the ongoing relationship between Quixote (Lluis Carbo) and his diminutive sidekick Sancho Panza (Lluis Serrat). The story sees Panza searching for a laurel crown for Quixote and helping Quixote dress in armor. The two men later bathe in a river, and four men with horses spirit Quixote away. Honor co-stars Glynn Bruce and Bartomeu Casellas. (AMG)
