,sjh999,2010-12-07T17:35Z,Great manual a couple of tricky bits mostly worrying about damaging the unit. Only had 1 red light on the ring of death and this fixed it. Thanks for the upload cost me ÂŁ8 for the stuff to fix it as already had the torx bits but a bit better than the ÂŁ50-90 Microsoft charge. Thanks again
