Browncoats rejoice.  The show Fox ripped from the fans comes to us in the form of an interactive, imaginative game.  A table-top RPG.  All those wonderful "What if"s you may have had buzzing through your head about person X or situation Y can be played out rather than simply thought.  It's a shiny new toy to play with.  And we're gonna get it nice and dirty.
