Jimi Hendrix Experience Smash Hits(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
______________________________________________________

Smash Hits is the first compilation album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. 
It was released in 1968 in the UK and the following year in the United States. 
Containing nothing but the band's biggest successes, both editions of the albums 
have proven to be long and popular sellers. 

Reissued and remastered in 2001.

The UK version first appeared in April 1968, only four months after the band's 
second studio album, Axis: Bold as Love, and while they were working on their third. 

Containing their first four (hit) UK singles (and their respective B-sides) in addition to four standout tracks from their (hit) LP Are You Experienced, 
Smash Hits became exactly that - a #5 album in the UK and one that had a long chart life. 

It also marked the first appearance on album of "Burning of the Midnight Lamp", five months ahead of its placement on Electric Ladyland.

In the US, however, things were done a little differently. 
Jimi's then-record label, Reprise Records, felt that a greatest hits collection was far too premature (as he hadn't had any there yet) and waited until mid-1969 (and, coincidentally, the break-up of the original band once Noel Redding suddenly quit) to issue a different compilation with the same title. 

Now with Electric Ladyland in the mix, there was more to choose from (and also a "hit" single, his only one in US). There were also tracks that had been elbowed off the UK edition of Are You Experienced in 1967 to make way for "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze" and "The Wind Cries Mary". 

As a result, the US version of Smash Hits - which reached #6 in its territory - although only including one "smash hit", is more balanced and more representative of the band's career, yet still failed to include any tracks from Axis: Bold As Love, and only two from Electric Ladyland. 

However, the UK (612004) and Japanese mono editions include the mono mix of the rare 1967 B-Side "Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice". 
It is also available on CD on The Singles Album.

A Japanese vesion was released in 1969, with a Fish eye photograph cover by Karl Ferris, Jimi's personal photographer/designer. In 1997, Experience Hendrix Inc. 
compiled and issued Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix, which currently stands as the definitive Hendrix compilation. 
However, this compilation was reissued and remastered in 2001. 

Neither the UK or US version contained tracks from the acclaimed 1967 album Axis: Bold As Love.
