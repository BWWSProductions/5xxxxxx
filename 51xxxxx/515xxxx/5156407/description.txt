UK Indie Rock sensation Noush Skaugen is currently in the US on a songwriting adventure collaborating with some of the best known songwriters in the country. Some of her planned stops include New York, Nashville and Los Angeles. On her way through NYC she stopped to play a set at The Bitter End. It is the only show she plans to do on this trip so when her people asked me if I would want to come out and video the show I jumped at the chance.
