This brasilian contemporary documentary proposes a new cinematographic writing by fixing a camera to a raft and, thus, translating into images and sounds sensations related to the slow and the routine of the vessel.

It's directed by Marcelo Pedroso ("15 Cents", "KFZ-1348", "Pacific") and produced by SÃ­mio Filmes.

No dialogue.
