,Rathyas,2009-11-15T06:31Z,"Drublue - Childish, inexperienced noobs need to stay off of this site if you think that every little thing you download has some sort of virus in them. Keygens, patches, cracks, etc., are almost 100% of the time picked up as a Trojan/some sort of virus. By what? By shitty Antivirus software. There are no viruses in this download, whatsoever. Get the hell off of this site if you're that incompetent and ignorant."
,Rathyas,2009-11-15T06:36Z,"By the way - Thanks, RobbingHood, for another great upload. "

,-stick,2009-11-15T20:55Z,"Works fine for me.

drublue: Shut up. You know nothing. There are no trojans here. They're called false positives, and are common with keygens. Get over yourself, and toss your computer out the window. No one likes you, and you type like a mouth-breathing retard. "
[V],RobbingHood,2009-11-16T02:15Z,"Nobody needs to worry cause this torrent is 100% clean, except for the usual troll comments. :D"
,lotrman,2009-11-16T13:11Z,I know that keygens usualy gets detected as trojan but when I downloaded this torrent I found several viruses inside it and it did not work so I would recomend not to download it.

Good for you; congratz and enjoy it. :)"
,DDLB,2009-11-28T17:26Z,"Can it be that the trojans/virus who are mentioned are false positives?

I will check this torrent myself."
,DDLB,2009-11-28T17:46Z,"No real virusses NOR trojans were found.
I've used AVG, Antivir and the one and only NOD32 te scan in the RAR-file.
Only the crack gives a message but if you are a regular user of TPB this is nothing new, I guess...

Like George Clooney would say: ""this is bonafide""."

,markinthecity,2009-12-01T10:11Z,"Vista users have to open an activator and a patch by >Run as administrator< 

Hey RH ! Are those plugins installable ? Cause I've been struggling with opening them up for a while.
Installing Magic Bullet Editors I get a message every time >The module ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Magic Bullet....................dll failed to load. Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug it to check for problems with the binary or dependent .DLL files. The specified module could not be found.<

I can't even see that in my programs' list of my computer. I can't handle installation the other plugins as well. 
Anyhow, my appreciation for the upload of Movie Studio.

3. if this WOULD be a virus why you on here then ? this is a fucking pirating site be happy you get it for free! its ridiculous if you dont like it just go away ^^

anyway thank you RobbingHood for this great upload ;)"
,axerine,2009-12-19T01:19Z,"Thank you. Works great after i tried to put out McAfee (that is a horrible program!). 

With Windows 7 you have to execute the patch as an administrator. Otherwise it will keep asking for a serial.

Again thank you!"
,peepy39,2009-12-20T22:05Z,awesome.  downloaded in less than 5 minutes with a shitty connection.  the slowest it was at was 800kb/s

Im using windows 7 (Unfortunately) but I'm testing out all the  Video editors. I just got to Sony Vegas and its asking for a serial. What do you propose that I should do ? "

*an error has occured while patching the file(s)!*

so...what am i doing wrong?"
,warlordll,2010-01-05T06:41Z,*Update* patch working but a new problem has been found....the activation / auth code does not work at all even when i generate a new one? any ideas what to do next?
,authoriseduser,2010-01-05T12:05Z,"RobbingHood, I downloaded this about 6 months ago and burned it to disk and then loaded it and worked great.  Then I got a new quad-core computer this Christmas (got rid of the old machine) and put 6 partitions on the hard drive and installed 3 operating systems.  Now, I can't get Vegas to install - the activator doesn't work right for some reason - but it worked 6 months ago for me.  Have any ideas what is going on?  Thanks in advance."
,authoriseduser,2010-01-05T12:39Z,"I should add that I just installed it on the primary partition (which has WinXP on it) and the activator worked just fine.  But when I go to the second partition (which has Windows 7, 32-bit, on it), the activator does not work.  Any ideas???"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-01-07T06:40Z,In case of problems with the activator try the (new) keygen included in this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5258584/
,lolz125,2010-01-18T07:31Z,"Thank you so much!

for the people who need help with this all that you need to is install it normal get the activation put in the 86x installation files (I did that not sure if ya need to do it, files usually found in ""My Computer"" and run the activation as an administor."

,thatguykalem,2010-01-24T01:23Z,"Hang on a sec, how do I get the Keygens to work? I've moved them into the Vegas Movie Studio folder in my Program Files, but I'm not sure what to do with the 'activator.exe', or the 'patch.exe' files. I've run them both, but they don't seem to do anything.

Halp."
,defiancee,2010-01-27T18:46Z,In Windows 7/Vista: use run as administrator to get activators to work.

Thanks, RobbingHood!"
,xskballerx,2010-04-04T12:13Z,"Sadly it does not work for me..

Ran as admin to install...

Ran as admin to run keygen...

Patched...

At the end, it says ""The number you have entered is invalid""

Odd thing is that with the keygen... Machine ID does not match with the installation Machine ID it displays..."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-05T08:14Z,"This is working fine for me, so far.

The only issue i have is that it doesn't have many supported file types. The only video files it's letting me import are .WMV's, i know for a fact Vegas supports many more video formats than that, so i either must have done something wrong, or i just need to adjust some settings."
,stealthisalias,2010-04-24T19:14Z,"I'm having some trouble with this, I downloaded and installed it fine but whenever I go to open Vegas it says ""Vegas Movie Studio Platinum has stopped working""  how do I fix this?  (I am using windows vista)"
,DrkNinja,2010-05-05T05:41Z,"@Drublue: What a nub. Only a nub would call a keygen, which is an illegal program that alters a legitimate program/the comp's registery, a virus. 

Let me just say that if this was a REAL virus from a REAL hacker you would have never have had the chance to even send us a comment back. A hacker who is truely skilled can crack your god damn ""firewall"" (which is probably jus his anti virus) in a good 5 seconds flat. "

i am new to downloading this stuff, but i really need vegas for a project. I downloaded this and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5258584/ and then after registering it says i need to enter an authentication code so i do off the DI keygen program and it justs says it doesnt work..what do i do?"
,Kipani,2010-06-30T12:57Z,"Using Windows 7 Ultimate running as admin, when installing the patch and the activator, it makes it so the program doesn't open at all.

,qqshoe,2010-07-15T04:56Z,"I think I fucked up, and I think I know where I fucked up, but I\'m going to ask for verification.nnInstalled Vegas 9 (works marvelously by the by, thank you!) and then installed all the plugins etc. The only plugins I\'m having trouble with are the NewBlue ones. After I installed them all, I ignored the cracks folder because I confused it with a keygen folder, and figured that if it asked me for a serial number, I\'d go to it. Dumb move on my part. Anywho, I started Vegas 9 and played with the NewBlue effects a little bit and noticed the watermark. Then I noticed that it said I was using the trial version of the FX. So I closed Vegas 9, and went to the Cracks folder and replaced all the .dll\'s in C:\\ProgramFiles(x86)\\NewBlue one at a time with the matching ones in the Crack folder. Then I double clicked the Serials Registration Entries thing (although admittedly I have no idea what that is or does) that was also in the Cracks folder, and then I opened Vegas 9. Still says I\'m using the trial version.nnI figure where I went wrong was opening Vegas 9 before I replaced the .dll\'s, but I\'m not sure. Any help is appreciated. nnP.S., What DOES the Serials Registration Entries file do?"
,qqshoe,2010-07-15T04:59Z,"Not sure why my comment is all messed up, I\'m new (not to torrenting, I\'ve been using TPB for ages, but just recently made an account). Sorry about that."

,florian00777,2010-08-14T14:46Z,"U stupid fuks , Ill be very clear OKĂ ! 

When  you download this torrent , scan it !! 

Cause i did that and u know what came out , 
''2 infections''   Discription of the infection :
2 TROJANS  ready to infect your computer. !!! i healed it and deleted the file at once , ! thanks! Robbinghood , good luck with your sad sad life . "
,qqshoe,2010-08-15T07:26Z,"That's because most anti virus software says that Keygens are viruses, because they're illegal. Goodness gracious, a simple google search could have told you that. I can personally vouch for this torrent. I can also say that every time I have ever downloaded a Keygen, AVG has ALWAYS declared it as a virus, and I have always ignored it because I know better, and to this date my computer is still virus free.

It goes without saying that not every virus warning you see is just your anti virus mistaking a Keygen for some malicious software, so stay careful. "
,wise5,2010-09-04T09:21Z,"look people, i maybe be a new member to the pirates but i've been d/ling for some time from then and here's a trick for you to learn, anyone on here who's name has a jolly rogers by it , whether it's blue, green or pink, can be trusted not to put any bad uploads on the net EVEN THOUGH anti-virus programs say their files have a virus in then *sigh* and exactly what do you think a keygen is,  it's a mod to the program, a CONTROLED virus in a way, to unlock the whole program, if you use game trainers and what not that is sort-of what a keygen it a trainer. so save us the drama and don't download it of your scared that your anti-virus is screaming that it is a virus.

Oh and thanks RobbingHood for the upload."
