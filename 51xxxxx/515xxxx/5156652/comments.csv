The first disc has the titles all stupid, and all of them have the artist wrong (all ""Various""? Come on.) Fail. It should at least LOOK legal."
,frontman1,2010-03-27T16:10Z,"ok listen scraps2pont0,

if u new anythin about lord of the rings youd realize that these track titles are the names of the scenes in which they appear....they are excellently titled and easy to associate with the track....stfu"
,teo829,2010-04-01T04:35Z,Scraps2point0 stfu you unappreciative son of a bitch
,Blackshadow93,2010-04-26T18:55Z,"@Scraps 2.0 If you haven't even uploaded any torrents of your own, don't bash other people's, at least they're getting the music out there"
,Fabbie,2010-06-12T01:13Z,How about some seeding? That would be great
,Scraps2point0,2010-07-03T04:36Z,I meant that the ID3 tags weren't there. >_>
,Scraps2point0,2010-07-03T04:40Z,"Some of them, anyway. Otherwise, it is a pretty good torrent. And since it has the most seeds, yeah."
,cloudlime,2010-07-04T00:28Z,"He does make a point in that if a user decides to share something with the rest of the world (via torrent), especially music files, they should be tagged in such a way to benefit both those who care about ID3 tagging and those who don't. It best to keep things simple. If it is a motion picture soundtrack such as this, the uploader should try to fill in the correct artist(s) and track title, including the name of the album of the songs. The tracks should have the same titles as the retail release. There are no requirement to these things, but uploaders should keep in mind that the more a torrent resembles the actual retail release of whatever it is, the better it is for the p2p community. It raises a standard of what is generally viewed as acceptable torrent quality. Thus, future torrents become even more badass than past ones. But despite all these things, there is no requirement that I know of that says an uploader must make the torrent, or in this case the make the ID3 tags, as perfect as possible. The fact of the matter is you're getting this shit for free. Yeah, it's fucking cliche, but no one ever really stops to think about what it means. Were you to even receive the .midi version of Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings score, and the midis had randomly generated numbers for file names giving you no indication of what the fuck the original song titles were, and everything was bunched up in big fucking mess, you still wouldn't have the right to complain about the torrent quality. When you download a torrent, you are taking something. Users can give back by seeding to other users, but then those users are just taking something as well. I don't mean taking from the RIAA or the MPAA, I mean taking something of value without leaving something of equal value in its place. Telling you to see is big fat fucking cliche, I know, but by seeding you pass on the debt you collected from that torrent to other users, who in turn pass it on to other users and so on. This is how pirates remain neutral. 

But when I see some fucker complaining about torrent quality, I can't help but think about how deep in the negative they must be. The timeless phrase of ""beggars can't be choosers"" applies to this situation pefectly. The uploader determines the torrent quality, not the leacher. One bitchfest about torrent quality is the equivelant of leaching 25GB without seeding a single byte. It's a serious offense. Be grateful that you even have place here on the grand Pirate Bay ship, whereby you can loot and plunder as you will without nary a cost to yourself. 

Here is wisdom, do with it what you will"

,manyfiles,2010-09-24T08:45Z,"Here is some wisdom. Sharing is great for the benefit of all. Criticism is great for highlighting fuck-ups.  These are almost facts wherein the assertion of what is great is congruent with some type of causal link.  Otherwise, there are no rules. cloudlime's lecture sounds great, but it seems like bs to me.  It sounds like another pirate trying to inject morality into a place where there is none.  If you're going to be a pirate, then be a pirate.  If you want to share, like Robin Hood, then share, like Robin Hood. But all we are doing is taking from one system and injecting into another.  So don't try to bullshit about how debt begins with taking from the torrent and not the RIAA or MPAA or even neglecting to mention the artist who is part of another system of compensation and who is not receiving compensation from those outside the system.

Of course, it is human nature that somone will try to concentrate power to a system someplace, even when they are taking from some other supposedly tyrannical system, then complain about those who don't follow their rules.  Isn't this obvious and ironic?

There's nothing more annoying and pathetic then people bitching about other people bitching. It's like a dot criticising a line for his lack of perspective.  Why not kill yourself and break the cycle?

In fact, I shouldn't even post this acknowledgement of my own inability to escape human folly. I should simply do what I normally do, and ignore you incognizant, uncreative, simple-minded folk.  Let this be a lesson to you all. "

Well don't dowload it then..."
,tih0008,2011-03-21T16:53Z,i thought return of the king has 19 tracks?
,Nennussen,2011-07-31T17:19Z,"Well, this was just a lousy tagged torrent. "
,techdestroyer,2011-08-12T17:49Z,This is great! Thank you :D
,kdozu,2011-08-31T15:05Z,"I'm not a big fan of incorrect tags, but I can fix those myself so that isn't really a big deal. This seems to be missing some tracks, at least for the soundtrack for The Return of the King."
,adolelizon,2011-10-11T08:16Z,actually its not missing tracks in the last disk track 1 has 3 tracks in all then track 2 has 2 tracks look carefully and you'll see the different tracks
,adolelizon,2011-10-11T08:20Z,would also like to include that when downloaded all tracks are in order even on the return of the king disc.
