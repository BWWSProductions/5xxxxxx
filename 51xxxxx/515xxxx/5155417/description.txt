Melvin Rhyne - 14 Albums - Jazz Organ

Melvin Rhyne rose to fame when he recorded four albums as a sideman with the jazz guitar giant Wes Montgomery during 1959 - 1963 (including Montgomery's first and last album for the Riverside label).

Fortunately, Rhyne survived long enough, after some lean years, to return to the major-league jazz scene and record some CD's of his own. Rhyne (born October 12, 1936, Indianapolis, Indiana), a largely self-taught pianist, was an important part of the city's jazz scene. He played with the then-unknown Roland Kirk during 1955-1956, and soon switched to organ. He also had opportunities to back a series of blues (including T-Bone Walker and B.B. King) and R&B artists. Rhyne was part of Montgomery's group for most of 1959-1964. In 1969, he moved to Madison, WI, and four years later he relocated to Milwaukee, where he remained active if obscure for the next two decades. In 1990, he emerged, recording with Herb Ellis and Brian Lynch. Mel Rhyne went on with more recording sessions and has shown that he is an excellent soul-jazz and hard bop organist in his own right.
