,putteH_,2009-11-07T20:27Z,"Yeah well thanks. I will download it and try. If it is not working, well so be it. I least have the game on my computer when the game really is released"

,sonidinos,2009-11-07T20:47Z,"I am downloading it from dream-tracker.net with 750 kb/s speed,they probably use seedboxes.Sign- up is open."
,geekUSA,2009-11-07T20:48Z,"I downloaded this from a private tracker in less than 30 mins and that key works!!!!! Just played the single player campaign for like 30 seconds, works GREAT!!! "
,JVDx,2009-11-07T20:51Z,"thats bullshit geekusa, im trying myself right now.."
,simkas,2009-11-07T20:55Z,"So, is this really a proper english version?"
,Stealthpro101,2009-11-07T20:58Z,Is this Torrent legit? 
,sonidinos,2009-11-07T21:00Z,"I am downloading it from dream-tracker.net with 1 mb/s speed,they probably use seedboxes.Sign- up is open.The torrent is freeleech!!!"
,ilefx,2009-11-07T21:01Z,"somebody have the game installed ??
"
,Stealthpro101,2009-11-07T21:05Z,VIP's are trust worthy right?
,JVDx,2009-11-07T21:06Z,"when i try to install with that key, this happens:
using your key:

this message pops up:
http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h240/JVD_me/mw2installwithkeyresult.png

oh and i use the russian torrent"
,geekUSA,2009-11-07T21:16Z,"JVDx is full of SHIT

First of all don't use the russian torrent
and secondly,
where the fuck do you live, on Easter fucking Island? ""This code cannot be activated in your region""

Get the fuck out of here asshole, like I said that key works perfect if you dont live on Easter Island"
,JVDx,2009-11-07T21:20Z,"pff if it really works post screenshots then!
nobody will believe you if you swear at me like that.
dont post lies or post pics that its true."
,LaGgY_42o,2009-11-07T21:22Z,"Key dosent work in the EU or US, tryed my EU and US VPN's and both say it cant be activated in my region. What region does the code work in?"
,JVDx,2009-11-07T21:32Z,"ok looks like i bypassed the cd key activation
http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h240/JVD_me/mw2installing.png

but after that, i get this:
http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h240/JVD_me/mw2steamerrorinstallation.png

server too busy!
hmm"
,sonidinos,2009-11-07T21:47Z,"I am downloading it from dream-tracker.net with 1 mb/s speed,they probably use seedboxes.Sign- up is open.The torrent is freeleech!!! "
,LaGgY_42o,2009-11-07T21:49Z,"your not gonna be able to install this or extract the files untill the encryption keys are released, and those are only released when the game is released."
,JVDx,2009-11-07T22:06Z,"i bypassed it by installing PacSteam, which i downloaded from a u tub e tutorial.
the tutorials name was something like PacSteam Installation Tutorial.

oh and if you get any errors saying failed to load blablabla at mw2, you can skip that by going to start> run> path to steam exe -install F: , where f is the drive letter of the mounted image.
then you get to the You are about to install mw2 screen, then the required diskspace and etc, press next, it loads files, then it fails.

good luck and let me know if you get any further"
,anonymous2122,2009-11-08T00:11Z,"I'm sure I recognise that error from when steam determines you don't have a licence to play the game (ie. when you used a cracked client to download a more recent game)

Obviously not the case for a 'retail-bought' disc as there is no purchase trail on their system, but worth bearing in mind.

One other thing, I would strongly recommend to everyone to use a clean, new steam account to test this, as Steam could try and ban everyone who tries this... Just a suggestion, hope it saves someone a bit of hassle. 

When I get it in, I'll try it with Steambuster (like Pacsteam) and hope I can make a breakthrough..."
,JPeterson,2009-11-08T02:00Z,According to this post cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54269 there is no way to decrypt this game. Before Tuesday at least.
,JPeterson,2009-11-08T02:32Z,A simpacked DVD copy like this has never been cracked before the release date.
,xMrAx,2009-11-08T03:31Z,There should be a way to crack it since people with early release of the pc version are able to play. Anyway please seed. I have upload almost 200GB and I'm only downloading at 200Kb/s.
,bihael,2009-11-08T10:18Z,"i get the same error as JVDx, server too busy... remember fear 2? there was a workaround with some small programs..."
,bihael,2009-11-08T10:20Z,"http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/how-crack-f-e-r-2-project-origin-readnfo-tl-252525/

this is it, but if someone can actually reprogram those files, we would still need a crack..."
,JVDx,2009-11-08T10:24Z,"as far as i know there arent any ppl yet who can play mw2 on pc. im getting the product cannot be activated in your region error again.
still hoping for a crack to come out tho i doubt it."
,ilefx,2009-11-08T14:52Z,"http://wwXw.badongo.com/cfile/13661765

maybe 

This can be working "
,alfa00,2009-11-08T15:12Z,"@ilefx:no it can't work because we need the key for decrypt the game,the file that you have  posted contain only the fear 2 key,but for the mw2 key we need to waiting the release day for rip it from steam."
,ilefx,2009-11-08T15:58Z,"with wrong data because are crypted files
but extracted

if you licke to see and test

,MYLZ,2009-11-08T21:48Z,"Using Undeadpatch cracked steam so you didn't have to insert a key, though it says at me:

Modern warfare 2 cannot be installed yet, because it is not released yet.

I tried this with / without internet connection, also I tried to put my computer on 19th November 2009, nothing worked.

But as it gives this message offline aswell there has to be something in steam or in the files which prevents us from installing .. Maybe someone can crack this?!"
,MYLZ,2009-11-08T21:49Z,"http://i.mavrev.com/i/093111590143.jpg

There's a pic of it :P"
,5uperdude111,2009-11-09T13:09Z,"Guys you won't be getting any further than the ""server is busy"". IW and steam have locked this up tight and won't be unlocking the game until 11.10.09. Some people might have managed to unpack some of the files but you would be missing .exe files. People are still working on a crack so be patient! Mean while...you just have to sit there and wait. >.>"
,rugburn11,2009-11-10T00:08Z,"Well it looks like Western Canada will not be able to get Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 for PC ...i called a few stores and checked the website of Bestbuy and FutureShop.
They will not have any till Thursday November 12
