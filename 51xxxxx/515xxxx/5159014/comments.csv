I would loove it if I did not have to use Little Snitch!"
,miknos,2009-11-15T08:49Z,I said use LittleSnitch just in case. I am not using and works fine.
,lappe,2009-11-15T22:01Z,"ok, I just hoped someone knew which host adresses to block, as I would hate it if Coda suddenly stopped working during a projects :("
,miknos,2009-11-16T12:21Z,Just disable updates.
,lappe,2009-11-17T23:53Z,"OK great!
Thank you for your replies!"
,zoratium,2009-12-03T08:14Z,"I have downloaded Coda 1.1 and Transmit previously. Several of my websites got hacked by and almost all my index.php files were replaced by some kind of javascript. 

I have since suspected Coda or Transmit that was downloaded from TPB to be the culprit.

I downloaded and ran LIttle Snitch, also downloaded from TPB by miknos. Whenever I open a site in Coda, it tries to connect to my web server randomly via TCP ports 33000-56000.

Does this happen to anybody else? This seems very weird and is highly suspect. I'm also suspecting that my NSLookup or the thing that resolves the domain names is also jacked by Coda. "
,zoratium,2009-12-03T08:15Z,I am worried about this download because of my previous experience.
,miknos,2009-12-04T23:53Z,"@zoratium:

 This torrent has +25 and no negatives. I think you're the only one experiencing this very strange problem."
,miknos,2009-12-05T00:37Z,"@zoratium:

btw, I downloaded the original dmg from developer's website. The .plist file won't hijack your computer."
,ipv6freely,2010-01-03T03:03Z,"Works wonderfully, thanks!"
,ipv6freely,2010-01-03T03:05Z,"@zoratium: I can vouch for the software being safe, too. I downloaded Coda from official website and just added the .plist from here. "
