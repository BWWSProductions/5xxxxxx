Hi everyone!

This is a copy of windows 3.11 I have uploaded. It also includes a copy of the graphics drivers (as a .7z) that are already installed with windows 3.11(in case you want to change them for whatever reason) and a copy of DOSBOX which you need to run windows with. 

I have seen other copies of win3.11 around but they dont have the graphics drivers already installed / or are in swedish.

The purpose of this torrent is 2 fold. 

Firstly to allow you to see how far microsoft has come with the windows OS and 

Secondly to allow 16 bit emulation for some very old games.

For example Star Wars Chess (installed in this version of windows 3.11) cannot be played on 64 bit OS's. So if you are running windows 7 64 bit and want to play an old 16 bit game that requires windows to run, you cant play it. 

A good example is already included. Star Wars Chess cannot play with just DOSBOX - it needs windows to work, so booting up win3.11 first gives you a platform for these old games.

Please enjoy. Comments welcome. First Torrent ever uploaded :)

Kind Regards

PS Note : Instructions - 
Install DOSBOX.
Extract the Win3.11 to the root of your C drive (it is already in a win311 folder)

Run dosbox
Type:
mount c c:win311 (there is a backslash here between the : and the win311 - for some reason its not displaying)
cd windows
win
This will run windows. Hope this makes it easier to use :)

Sorry I forgot to install sound drivers on this torrent. Rather than do it for you I will provide instructions instead.

First download this torrent with the win3.11 setup files. 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3392923/Windows.3.11.and.MS-Dos.6.22
Next extract the files to the win311 folder you already have up and running under a new folder called setup.
IE you now have a setup directory inside the win311 directory with these files in it.

Step 2
Boot into win311 and then go to the control panel and then the drivers applet.

Step 3
Add the "creative labs sound blaster 1.5"
Browse to the setup folder and hit OK.

Step 4
Choose Port 220 and interrupt 7.

Step 5
Reboot and enjoy windows and Star Wars Chess with sound. 

Sorry for not including sound to begin with. I dont normally bother with game sound as my Amps are pumping out MP3's too loud to notice :)

PPPS
