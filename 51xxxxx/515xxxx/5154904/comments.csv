Yes the sample is good, but the sample is not representative of the whole movie.  Most of this movie is low light scenes, and these scenes look like crap. They are heavily pixilated and noisy.  The audio is also bad.  It is hard to understand what people are saying half the time, and there is a hiss during the quiet scenes.

All in all this is like a good quality cam.  It is watchable, but I stopped watching because I am excited about this movie, and I want to wait for a copy where I can see clearly what is going on and understand what people are saying.

thanks for the up."
