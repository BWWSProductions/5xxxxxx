,Maelbox,2009-12-12T00:19Z,"I haven't downloaded it yet, but I'm guessing woseu is a private server. Because you pay through an account, even if you have the game, you can't play on the actual servers.

Therefore, you need to find a private server. If I were you, google Fusion private server (I think that's the name, I did this a while back before I deleted the game, tightass parents) and there should be tutorials on how to set up the IP address. 

IIRC, there is a text folder somewhere that will allow you to change the host from Blizzard to the private server.

Anyway, hope I helped."
,badboy67,2009-12-14T16:24Z,"Thank´´s a lot Maelbox , i will try it out"
,MusicIsMagic,2009-12-22T09:11Z,"Ok, here is a little guide. 
When you have installed / patched the whole thing, you should have a file called ""realmlist"" in your installation folder. As a default, it's WTF -file, but if you right-click it and then select to ""open with program.."" --> Choose notepad, and it will change into text -file. Now erase everything from the text file and replace it with the realmlist of the private server, for example ""set realmlist logon.woseu.com"" (without the "" marks, of course). 

After this you should be able to log in with the private server account you made on their website. And remember, you can change that realmlist any time you want to, when you change server. 
And one tip, when you change from one private to another, always delete your Cache folder. It will gather information about the server you play on, so you might have ""wrong"" information from server X, and when you go to server A the items looks like server X items all though they are not. 


Hope this helps the new guys."
,pianoman27,2009-12-31T10:44Z,"it works.when  you finish updates go to the installation folder.it will be a file realism.wtf.open it with notebook and change the ip and you are done.

,samories,2010-01-04T21:27Z,"@ Slicura >
This release is suppose to NOT be updated since its vanilla. If you update you will not be able to play on vanilla servers, And when it would be better to have downloaded a later version from the beginning instead of this.

@ TwistedTorrent >
You will have to be logged in as an administrator, since you are having several account on your computer. This is not a game issue its your OS."

This is BY FAR the best ORIGINAL STYLE realm I could find!!!

NO INSTANT 60
NO BOOSTED LEVELING
NO DONATION PERKS

THIS IS AS CLOSE TO HOW THE ACTUAL GAME REALLY WAS - AWESOME SERVER!

Been leveling for a while and I've found no game breaking bugs.

The community is close, friendly and FUN to be around! Seriously they put shame to the retail client players.

(BTW I've played the retail version since launch - I wanted to come back to a point where the game was at it's best - CLASSIC!)

if you are looking for a 1.12.1 Realm i just can advise you to this one:
www.mc-wow.eu
www.mc-wow.eu
www.mc-wow.eu
(promotion at 25.3.2012)
(first 1.12.1 realm >with pathfinding"
,Stakan002,2012-05-01T11:36Z,"Vanilla-Exuberance.com is a pretty nice server. Features the aspect of WoW from when it came out. Some oldschool gamers who created and develops on it, they are in beta mode atm so the rates are upped but I think they'll bump it down to 100% blizzlike (1x) rates when they are done with beta.

Seems like a nice server. I got 30-50 ping there all day long, it's hosted in EU I think... Anyways, check it out if you're interested in blizzlike 1.12.

Thanks for the upload btw! :)"
