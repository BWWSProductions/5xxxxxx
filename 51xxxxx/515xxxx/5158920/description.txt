Co-founding member, principal co-songwriter, lead guitarist and co-producer of Aerosmith, JOE PERRY, will release his fifth solo CD Have Guitar, Will Travel on Tuesday, October 6th.   The hard driving, ten-song, in your face, collection features Perryâ€™s trademark rock and blues ferocity, as well as the CDâ€™s first single, the blazing â€œWeâ€™ve Got A Long Way To Go,â€ set for release later this summer. Recorded this past spring at the BoneYard, Perry's state-of-the-art home studio, where Aerosmithâ€™s Honkinâ€™ On Bobo and Just Push Play were recorded, Have Guitar, Will Travel is entirely written and produced by Perry.
