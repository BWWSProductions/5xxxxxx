Scary As Hell Edition...that what this fanedit is !!!

The movie has already been mutilated in USA (They remove the true ending to give the movie a happy ending. In the european edit she never leave the cave, just hallucinate that she does.)

For once, we got a good horror movie (and that rarely happens) and you maim it!!

How arrogant are you  to believe you can make a good movie by editing somebody else's work.

Make your own movie,( You'll see how difficult that is!) stop desecrating other people's work."

""She is responsible for the group getting lost in the cave and she also by accident kills one of the girls. For this she has to pay a great price.""

This is actually not the case. Juno's demise is the result of Sarah finding out that she had an affair with Sarah's late husband. It's personal and has nothing at all to do with the accidental death of their common friend. 

If you believe otherwise then you really need to see this movie again and pay attention to the intro and later on, the necklace.

I enjoy fanedits a lot, but I will not be downloading this one, as I feel the movie is excellent as it is. European version of course, not US - as always.
