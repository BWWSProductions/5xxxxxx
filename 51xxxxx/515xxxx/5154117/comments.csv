,timmage,2010-11-02T19:08Z,"OK. Since it seems that people are having problems with some of the games, I'm g0oing to tell you how to play them. Note, this applies ONLY to the games that, when you attempt to run them, bring up a small blue box with coding in some language and then give an error screen.

That error appears because your computer;s locale is not set to Japan.

To set the locale to Japan, in Windows 7/Windows Vista, you can change it in the Clock, Language, and Region section of the control panel.

Once in there, under Region and Language, click on Change Location.

In there, click on the tab that says Administrative. You want to click the button that says ""Change System Locale.""

In there, set the locale to Japanese(Japan), and restart your computer.

This does nothing to English programs, I have my locale set to Japan right now and I'm having no problems with anything.

VOILA! You can now play all of these games.

Enjoy your new games ;3"
