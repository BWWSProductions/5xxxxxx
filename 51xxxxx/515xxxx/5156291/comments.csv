Picture quality; very good.

Sound quality; the movie har 2 soundtracks:
Russian DD 5.1 and English DD 2.0. The Russian soundtrack is very good. The English soundtrack is VERY bad, hardly bearable, actually, on my more-than-decent 6.1 sound-system. A lot of the time, you can hardly make out the dialogue. The sound is muffled, boxed in, ond badly compressed. Too bad, cause 2Lions-Team usually deliver the good stuff. If you're Russian, however, don't think twice; download."
