Straight out of Inverness and Mabou, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Mike Ryan and Bruce Gillis have been making music together for nearly a decade. Included in this torrent are their works together from three bands.

Billy's Flick - Unexpected (2004)

Deadline Sunday/Riley - Deadline Sunday EP (2006)

Holdin' Up Grants - This Way EP (2007)

This collection is a must have and please if you may, seed generously because it's not everyday that the musicians themselves approve of their work being shared throughout the world.

Your seeder,

Nigel MK
