,nekroto,2011-07-31T01:48Z,"ahh man god damn it
i downloaded ~10 korean movies, checked all of them were good... and this was the last one. failed cuz of hardsubs. yeah i know it's my fault, now i see it's written in the description hardsubbed but.. i dont understand, they have separate files for subitles, yet they hardsubb... especially on this non full screen ratios, when u have big black bars and you cannot place the subtitles there.. i guess i have to find another release."
