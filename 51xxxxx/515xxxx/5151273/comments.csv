Just ignore the negative quality scores he or them is trying to deceive you. Don't Worry about it.

All my torrent uploads are pre-tested and work fine."

[V],Big_dude,2010-11-04T19:34Z,"get yourself a modded ps2 or with fmcb with esr

or you can use swap magic with ps2 to boot backups, you most likely will not get this working
at all on a ps3 fyi.

read my describtions if your confused."

,Aletheran,2011-04-04T04:05Z,"Thanks for the UL

I got 1 problem though:
I can play DC 1 just fine, but when I try to play DC 2, it will boot, but then it comes up with a screen saying: Reading Memory Card (PS2) and it just stays like that...
Tried booting without the mc and then insert it when this screen comes up, or when the screen comes up removing te mc and putting it in again (tried both slots) but all still gives the same screen...
Besides this game, I never had this problem before and as I stated I can play DC 1 just fine...
I am using USBExtreme to play.

Any1 know how to solve this?"
,samljer,2011-04-05T23:27Z,"Why would u think it smart to put both games into 1 rar. most people looking for one or the other can choose what part of the torrent to ignore.
now im forced to download double for shit i dont want.

This torrent should be either in 2 files or seperate, this is just silly."
,xmaster408,2011-08-25T18:20Z,I totally agree with samljer
