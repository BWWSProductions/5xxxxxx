Regarded by many as the first Japanese progressive rock group, the Far East Family Band featured the keyboardist and future new age composer, Kitaro. A keyboard-dominated space rock band, the Far East Family Band played extended compositions that brought comparisons to Tangerine Dream and early Pink Floyd. Nipponjin (1975), the band's second album under their new name (the trio changed their name from Far Out to Far East Family Band following the release of Nihonjin which appeared on the Denon label in 1973), featured re-recorded material from the previous The Cave Down To Earth (1974) as well as Nihonjin and was produced by Tangerine Dream's Klaus Schultz. The band's synthesizer-drenched sound had much to do with Kitaro and Schultz meeting during a trip to Europe. One of Japan's earliest prog bands, Far East Family Band became hugely popular in Japan and also achieved considerable attention in Europe. The group went on to release two further albums, Parallel World (1976) and Tenkujin (1977), but it is Kitaro who enjoyed lasting fame for his legendary Silk Road albums. Digitally remastered, numbered limited edition of 1,000 copies only in a unique card wallet.
