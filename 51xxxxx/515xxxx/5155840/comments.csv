ie the tag says 480p, which is the resolution for DVD, not usually Bluray.  
Just a guess.  I'll post once I find out myself."

,smokkapi,2009-11-12T18:38Z,"Terrible movie, Its not supposed to be funny. Wasn't even slightly exciting. 
The storyline sucks bigtime, It made me kinda mad actually. Not even a good movie for kids, Since its about war.
No humor, No storyline, No movie.
Animation was ok, But thats about it.
French commercial bullshit."
