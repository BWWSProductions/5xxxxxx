ash Optimizer is a handy solution for web-masters, web-designers, Flash professionals and everyone who has ever come in touch with Adobe Flash technology. It can reduce your SWF files size up to 60-70% thanks to advanced algorithms of vectors, shapes, morphing, Z-buffer, fonts, embedded video and other optimizations. Unlike any other similar software Flash Optimizer manages to optimize not only a separate part of your Flash movie, but the whole SWF, including curves, zero-objects, applying ZLib optimization and many other advanced techniques.

Flash Optimizer provides the simplest user interface and two types of compression configurations: simple and profound, allowing you to customize more than 50 separate options, reaching the optimum compression with minimum quality loss. Flash Optimizer brings a significant power into hands of Flash users, allowing everyone to save traffic, time and finally money!

Since Flash Optimizer 2 you are presented with the new greatly improved and simplified user interface which is now separated into 2 tabs that offer advanced functionality on a separate file compression and batch SWF compression.
