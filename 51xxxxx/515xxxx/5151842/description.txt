Angel - Season 5

This is probably more for the slightly obsessed fans than for anybody else...

This is a high quality x264 DVD Rip of the final season of Angel that is (I think) better looking than the Xvid versions I have seen so far (no huge blocks in backgrounds, correct colors, more details, etc). That said it is about twice as big as those versions, but it also contains audio commentaries when available* and the audio is untouched Dolby Surround (2 ch) in English (no subs). Image size is 1024x576 (anamorphic) and the average bitrate is 2100 kbps (probably overkill but I wanted Fred to look her best).

Like I said, you'd have to be slightly obsessed :)
