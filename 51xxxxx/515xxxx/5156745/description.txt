------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ripped from NTSC VHS tape. CBC's 1979 rendition of the life of Louis Riel,
and his leadership of the Metis, in the Canadian rebellion during the 1870's
and 1880's. Made-for-TV movie, about 2 and a half hours long. There are a
tonne of famous Canadians in this flick, it's kinda neat to see them in an
unfamiliar setting.
  Apparently, you will not be able to purchase this movie new ever again; my
understanding is that, after it aired, a number of Canadians complained that
it really misrepresented quite a few aspects of the people and events. I don't
know whether or not  a better video of this time in Canada's history has been
made. Probably "Canada : A People's History" is fairly accurate.
  This file should recode to NTSC-compliant DVD for those so inclined.

PS
I forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of "Man Alive" (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.
