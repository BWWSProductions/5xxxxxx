You need X11 to launch this game.

RecWar [Recreational Warfare] is a cool Windows game. I have converted it to Mac OS using CXSkin Wrapper.

RecWar can be played multiplayer. There are 3 options (and 1 single player):

- You and your partner on 1 Mac.
- Online
- You and your partner on 1 Mac Online :P

There are 3 modes:

- FFA - free for all - shoot everyone.
- TDM - team deathmatch - you and your teammates kill enemies.
- CTC - capture the cow - classic CTF. There is no limit to 2 teams ;) Max 11 
teams!!!.

You can find in game files a map editor, but I didn't convert it to mac. But ofc, you can run everything on windows, make a map, and put it into mac game files.

But... Try it yourself ;)
