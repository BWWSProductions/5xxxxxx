,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-11-09T20:42Z,"OK, I'll put up a review here (coming from someone who would give the first Manhunt a 9.5)
Summary: 90% of the game sucks hard...

Graphics (2.0): OK, this just goes beyond me, I installed M1 after M2 AND NOTICED that M1 HAS SLIGHTLY BETTER GRAPHICS THAN M2!!!??? So I went to the game's folder and noticed that the models and the maps aren't bigger than 200mb in size??? WHAT! (one point for the gore)

Sound (8.0): greatest part of the game, good environmental sound (duh, rockstar), bad voice acting.

Gameplay (4.0): Sucks, combat doesn't look as good as it should be, and executions are hard to pull off.

Story (7.0): looks a little half-baked, sorry Manhunt fans... (IMHO M1 story is MUCH BETTER)

Replayability (5.0): no extra costumes, no cheats..., only replayable if you actually liked it (not my case)

Bottom line: clearly a step-back in the small franchise"

"
,Wumpus108,2009-11-16T06:10Z,"Worked just fine for me! No problems. And pretty fun game too. The graphics are fair if you turn up everything. Looks good except the character textures, but environments and lighting is pretty good. "
