Les Liasons Dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos
Translated by PWK Stone
Adapted by Polly Coles
Directed by Clive Brill
BBC Radio 4 1992



In 8 parts of approximately 30 mins, broadcast late evenings from 20 July, 1992.

Diana Rigg as the Machiavellian Marquise de Merteuil with a splendid supporting cast.

Unlike the Christoper Hampton dramatization, Polly Coles' adaptation for radio stays with the epistolary format of the original book. An ideal format for radio.






The Vicomte de Valmont is determined to seduce the virtuous (and married) Madame de Tourvel, who is living with Valmont's aunt while Monsieur de Tourvel is away for a court case. At the same time, the Marquise de Merteuil is determined to corrupt the young CÃ©cile de Volanges, whose mother has only recently brought her out of a convent to be married to a former lover of Merteuil. CÃ©cile falls in love with the Chevalier Danceny (her music tutor) and Merteuil and Valmont pretend to want to help the secret lovers in order to gain their trust, so that they can use them later in their own schemes......................
