Red Wire Black Wire is a Brooklyn based 5-piece that creates music with the immediacy of a DJ and the subtlety of film score. Formed at Wesleyan University, their music combines dense but precise layers of synths, guitars, strings, and pounding drums. Eschewing irony, singer Doug Walters focuses on the melancholy; critics have compared him to Robert Smith and Frank Miller. Red Wire Black Wire effortlessly fuse electronic and organic counterpoint to create catchy, textured, and revealing compositions.
