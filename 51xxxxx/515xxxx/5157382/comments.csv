,BigDet,2009-11-11T13:27Z,Will this work on neogamma r8
,Fuck__You,2009-11-11T18:31Z,"yes with the right settings. just use usb loaders and get with the times man. no one wastes disks any more. then you have to worry about your dvd drive breaking too. and you get slower loading speeds off disks. and i have only heard of 2 games that could not run of usb. sam and max, and some other one. and there is also more of these torrents, with better seeders man. people need to look arounf before they download. lol."
,Ariba78,2009-11-11T19:46Z,does it work on chipped wii on dvd?
,Fuck__You,2009-11-11T20:19Z,not at the moment. use a usb loader....
,Noizine,2009-11-12T04:43Z,Is this legit? I thought this game wasn't supposed to be out yet...
,Cfrogboy91,2009-11-12T10:21Z,"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M SO EXCITED THANK YOU LONG LIVE THE FUCKING PIRATEBAY ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!

,Simpfan,2009-11-12T17:19Z,"I have tested this on my Pal Wii with Wiikey v2, and firmware 4.2E, but it's not working. All other backup games works perfectly. When I insert the burned dvd-r, an error pops up immediately, and the disc must be ejected out, and can't be used. :( I hope there are some version I can play normally like my other games on my wii with wiikey v2 without problems. I must have this game, it's so cool."
,wietzek,2009-11-12T19:41Z,"at Simpfan
you can also go and buy the fucking games nerd"
,Fuck__You,2009-11-12T23:27Z,"ya, buying a game is the way to go. but new games dont currently work off backup disk, Nintendo implemented a new form of copy protection, it affected both usb loaders and disk loaders. people quickly patched for usb loaders, you have to wait for an update for disk loaders. google it people.  "
,toja92,2009-11-13T09:51Z,Do you really think this game is as small as 357MB?
,crook16 ,2009-11-13T22:47Z,"its only 350 mb?

aww man you can only fit so much game in 350 megs i thought it would be huge like they announced 

hopefully im wrong and it helps that its 2d...."
,wiinoma,2009-11-17T04:52Z,"@wietzek

If that was the fucking case, then take your own advice and gtfo out of here because your looking for your own ISO downloads too apparently or you wouldn't be in here in the first place. "

I made it myself, and tested it myself, so I know it works. cIOS revision 14 is a must have. I used NeoGamma R8 beta 12, but R7 may work (I haven't tried it)."
,tgcleader,2009-11-22T13:24Z,its not 357.25 its only like that cause its compressed and when you extract it it is 4. something GB just like some other ones are.
,Shlonga,2009-11-29T16:44Z,If your getting slow connection goto wiiwolf dot blogspot dot com. I have links there to download it from rapid-share!
,UngodlyLG,2010-01-05T00:03Z,I copied the iso file to the USB disk with WBFS Manager 3.0 but it dus not work on the SDUSB-Loader_v1.4.
,12scrappydappydo,2010-01-05T02:22Z,Can anyone help tring to install homebrew but my wii wont reconise the sd card it just keeps telling me how many blocks i have availible? please someone have mercy on a dimwit
,1nuk3d1,2010-01-16T11:06Z,"its a smaller size cause, from what ive read else where, they use filler to make it 4.7gb on games that arent dual layer"
,bendoveru,2010-02-02T09:10Z,"Great upload yo.. First Super Mario Bros i've gotten to work.. But yes this is confirmed working an a 3.1u, neo gamma r7 / cios 14....  nice man.. i will upload for awhile :)"
,apzoeiruty,2010-04-23T23:51Z,"Thanks !

"
,dennis96411,2010-12-31T05:52Z,I heard you got arrested...
,gio5660,2011-05-09T00:42Z,"Nice compression. File size is 4.37GB after extraction. 
Works fine in Dolphin.
Thank you uploader!"
,bobbiann0405,2011-11-24T17:21Z,"I am a noob, lol of course to this sort of thing, lol 26 female in nursing school, just figured out to do all the homebrew shit, now, which one of these torrents do i put over for wbfs? I extract them and theyre all the same email me and let me know mark_lovesbobbi @ yahoo"
,bastard_no1,2011-12-01T22:02Z,"works in usb loader gx running (i think, waninkokos) ios249 d2x v6 rev 20006, block ios reload set to on."
,The_Loko,2012-01-26T23:11Z,"Thanks! 1,2 mb/s dw."
,Kepler101,2012-02-13T10:18Z,"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS TORRENT????
I LOOK ON THE PEER LIST AND EVERYBODY IS AT 0.0% LOLOLOL SEED YOU DAMN LEECHERS."
,bruh16,2012-03-10T14:43Z,"I've come to say the file worked well at my Dolphin emulator. Yep, 350 MB is too few for a Nintendo Wii game, but actually it was compressed. Upon extracting you'll have an 4,37 GB .iso file."
