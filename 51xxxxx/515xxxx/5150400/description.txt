If you want to learn how to take advantage of the NEW features of Windows Server 2008 R2 and you need to get your servers upgraded to Server 2008 R2, then this course is for you!

This over six hour training course introduces you to Windows Server 2008 R2 and teaches you
"Whatâ€™s New In R2". You will learn to use some of the hot new features that are available in Window Server 2008 R2 and Iâ€™ve put together some batch scripts that will allow you to get a headstart on the new features NOW!

Course FAQs

"Am I qualified to take this course?"
    YES! If you have a working knowledge of Windows Server 2008 and networking,
    or you have watched any of our Server 2008 training courses, then you will benefit from this course!

    **Note: This is a specialized course that requires some knowledge of Active Directory, IIS and Hyper-V.
"Do I need any special equipment to complete this training course?"
    NO All you need is a computer with Internet Explorer and a media player;
    however, working hands-on with Server 2008 R2 may enhance your training experience. The software I used in this course includes Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit Edition, but you could also use Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit Edition, as well. Here some of the hardware components I used in the course demonstrations and scenarios:

    Computer 1 â€“ For Running Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V
    - 1 Intel Quad Core Processor with VT extensions - 2.4 GHz
    - RAM - 4GB
    - 3 250GB Hard Drives
    - 2 Network Interface Cards


    Computer 2 â€“ Running VMware Virtual Machines for the Domain Controller and Web Server (both Server 2008 R2)
    - 1 Intel Dual Core Processor
    - RAM - 8GB (minimum you could use is 4GB)
    - 2 250GB Hard Drives
    - 1 Network Interface Card

    NOTE: The two machines are connected by a 4-Port Linksys router running DHCP 
"Will this course prepare me for a Microsoft Certification Exam?"
    NO This course will show you how to take advantage of the new features in Windows Server 2008 R2 and was created specifically as a supplement to our current Server 2008 training series. It does not provide Microsoft Certification Exam coverage.
