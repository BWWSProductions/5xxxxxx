A PERFECT RIP @ 192 kbps, STRAIGHT FROM MINT CONDITION VINYL! 

INCLUDES ORIGINAL ALBUM ART!

VERY RARE!!! 

Kiss Kicker plays perfectly from start to finish 
(unlike my previous upload of this torrent, which came from a record that had a few scratches on it). 

I was finally able to track down The Fontanelles vocalist Steve "Spit" Spingola, who so graciously sent two perfect copies of this record to me, which he had been storing in his basement. Now, I will share it with all of you because this rare, great music needs to be heard!!!

-------------------------------------

The Fontanelles were a band formed in California, USA in the late 1980s. 
Their song "Kiss Kicker 99" was featured in the movie "Hobgoblins", which is a movie that is perhaps best known for being shown on episode #907 of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Kiss Kicker 99 Lyrics
---------------------

why work for something
when you can steal it?
it's always been my philosophy
a little of this and a whole lot of that
i want it all
cause then i want some more

kiss kicker 99

kiss kicker
99 girls 99 boys
boot licker
99 reasons to live
kiss kicker 
99 girls 99 boys
boot licker 
kiss kicker 99

why live for something
when you can kill it?
it's always been my philosophy
you shove and get shoved and ya
shovel more shit
i want it all
& then i want some more

kiss kicker 99

(chorus)

you live and let live 
or you live and let die
oh I want it all
'cause I want some more
kiss kicker 99
(chorus)
99 reasons to die
