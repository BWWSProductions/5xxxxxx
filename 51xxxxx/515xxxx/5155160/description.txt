'Up To Now' collects some of the finest moments from Snow Patrol's lengthy career. This warts and all compilation not only features some of the band's biggest hits including 'Run' and 'Chasing Cars' but delves back into their beginnings when the band were just a fledgling indie act signed to Jeepster Records. Tracks from their five studio albums as well as Gary Lightbody's side-project, the Scottish super group The Reindeer Section, sit amongst three brand new songs as well as live tracks, b-sides and their much sought after cover of Beyonce's 'Crazy In Love'.
