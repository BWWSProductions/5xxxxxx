Adrienne Wilmoth Lerner, Chiara St. Pierre, "Climate Change"
Greenhaven Press | 2009 | ISBN: 0737947662 | 234 pages | PDF

This is an excellent book. I particularly enjoyed reading the sections concerning specific situations around the world, eg the impact of rising water on Venice, Italy. The breadth and scope of the book is fascinating, enlightening and thought-provoking. It is very readable and I highly recommend for anyone (not just students or scientists)interested in the impact of global climate change as well as international responses to this pressing environmental crisis.
