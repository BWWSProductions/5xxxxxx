This is, of course, a reissue at a cheaper price of the Karl Bohm recordings of the Mozart symphonies made in the 1960's with the Berlin Philharmonic. The sound is warm and spacious and the orchestral playing immaculate. 

Bohm shapes the performances lovingly; allegros are never forced; the adagios have never sounded more beautiful; the minuets are charming and the finales, while never rushed, have plenty of excitement. As one would expect for a close friend and associate of Richard Strauss [also a great Mozartian] the orchestral textures are clear and do not at all show the 'muddiness' one might expect from a 'big band' like the Berlin Philharmonic. Also, I was continually amazed by Bohm's felicities of phrasing. Nothing sounds exaggerated and there are none of those clever 'original touches' delighted in by some conductors - 'touches' that become increasingly irritating on repeat listenings. 

A different sound to 'original instrument' Mozart - of course - but these performances from forty years ago do not sound in the slightest bit dated 
and can be recommended without reservation.


Enjoy and Seed!!
