I enjoyed your Rare Hits vol.44 and found some nice tracks on there I hadn't heard before. Do you by any chance have complete albums of some of those groups: Privates Lives, Telekin, Incandescent Luminaire, Foreign Press, Jullan? Judging by these songs they could be very good...

I've been looking for an album also by Icehouse as well, its strange because its there most popular. Primitive Man (1982). You must have this one (it has one of my all time favs Hey LIttle Girl and its b-side). No rush, since I'm enjoying all this 80s swank. Tah."
[V],80zforever,2009-11-12T17:52Z,phavonic both Privates Lives and Jullan have full lps. I am sure I have already posted Private Lives in one of 4 rare 80s series. Now Telekin and  Incandescent Luminaire are one single wonders but Foreign Press had like 3 to 4 singles. Cheers
