,hamidmp3,2009-12-06T17:01Z,"this is Great. Thanks alot. 
unlike other torrents,  all episodes have good quality in this one."
,theluckynumber,2009-12-09T16:30Z,"Download speed looks good for now, but it seems there are no complete seeds!!

If i get the whole thing, I will seed for at least a month."
,assmunch3,2009-12-10T05:07Z,torrent seems to be dead. everyone stuck at 9.8%.
,theluckynumber,2009-12-13T19:10Z,"yep..its dead!! But instead of loading through a torrent, I just stream the episodes on Ninjavideo.net and save the divx files after they are done streaming. Quality is better than most torrents and it takes about 5 minutes for one episode"
,UCBDisco,2010-05-01T05:10Z,"Please seed. I can't stand the quality of the other torrent. It was as if they used a camera and recorded it off of the television. It's just plain awful.

And why are there no seeders if this version of the entire series is in such better quality? What the crap? split0o0, why don't you get back online and share this file so more people can seed it instead of that other crappy other torrent?"
,pdmayt1,2010-05-11T20:51Z,"I'm seeding what I have, I encourage other to do the same.  The other torrent is absolutely horrendous. Please seed, don't let it die! "
,Hugo N,2010-05-15T03:46Z,Please seed split0o0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,pdmayt1,2010-05-16T21:56Z,I have about 1/3 and still going...i am uploading at 500kbps
,Hugo N,2010-05-27T17:38Z,Uploader should be banned for not completing his UL.......
,pdmayt1,2010-06-07T00:44Z,Well I got 53.7% and I seeded over 60 GB but I think despite my best efforts this torrent is officially dead. I will no longer seed.
,Crucible65,2010-06-29T16:41Z,I am in the same situation as pdmayt1 and my ratio is currently 3.014 .  I have only been able to download 51mb since February 2010 and I suspect most of that would be wasted data.
,NotEnoughTime,2010-09-10T04:07Z,SWEET JESUS!! SOMEONE IS SEEDING!!!:DDD
,thundahchunk,2010-10-10T07:20Z,I've been stuck at 96.7 percent for about a month. There's 1 seeder that comes on for maybe an hour and then leaves for days. Can this person just super-seed?
,chefadam,2010-10-21T10:34Z,All i need is .1 and i will seed. Stuck at 99.9 thanks! 
,dodo_ns,2010-10-21T18:34Z,Please seed......... Stuck at 99.9. I'll seed after I'm done :S
,chefadam,2010-10-22T05:55Z,WORD! ITS CAPS LOCK DAY! I HAVE 100% AND WILL SEED!!!!! THANKS!!!!!!
,chefadam,2010-10-22T06:15Z,uh oh! i just copied and pasted file to my folder and it dissapeared from seeding and started downloading all over again. Can any one tell me how i can seed this from the folder i copied into and what the heck happened. Thanks and will try to seed when i can figure this out.

,916er,2011-04-14T18:16Z,Good lookin split. Great quality..Malcolm in the middle is my favorite show and if i had the option i would buy every single season on DVD but You cant because of some bullshit music rights or somthin gay like that.. anyway thanks again!

,DaleJordanGee,2011-05-12T13:21Z,"this is one of the best torrents around, no shit."
,JHD1995,2011-06-02T08:16Z,"This torrent is fantastic.

Seasons 1 & 3 are presented in a cropped 4:3
Seasons 2 and 4-7 are presented in 16:9

All episodes are very good quality, much better than the quality of other torrents.

Season 1 are DVDrips
Season 2-7 are PDTV widescreen (with an exception of season 3) rips from UK channel Sky1 and US channel Fox.

Overall I'd rate this 9.5/10

Thanks for uploading."
