The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set is not for the faint of heart. This
four CD box set of unreleased tracks, alternate versions of well known
songs, and rare concert footage is a cornerstone of any Hendrix
collection. This box set is no place to start if you are not familiar with
Hendrix. I would recommend his first three studio albums for any type of
Hendrix indoctrination. This set, however, is a good place to complete
your collection or at least to explore his legacy a little deeper.

Engineer Eddie Kramer was in charge of the project. He is a familiar
figure as his posthumous Hendrix production credits go back to The Cry
Of Love in 1971. The tracks sound terrific as he re-mastered the sound
with modern equipment which gives the music a polished feel. He also
presents the tracks in chronological order which is always welcome with
projects this extensive.Disc one finds three unreleased tracks. â€œTitle #3,â€
â€œTaking Care Of Business,â€ and â€œHere He Comesâ€ may not be of the
quality of Hendrixâ€™ first album but they certainly present his musical
vision circa 1967. The gems of this first disc are alternate versions of
such classics as â€œPurple Haze,â€ â€œFoxey Lady,â€ and â€œThird Stone From
The Sunâ€ which give a glimpse into the creative mind of Jimi Hendrix.

Disc two presents some excellent live tracks. â€œFireâ€ is taken from a 1968
concert at Clark University in Massachusetts. It is a frenetic version that
shows just how technically sound Hendrix was as a guitarist. â€œThe Wind
Cries Mary,â€ from a 1967 Paris concert, shows Hendrixâ€™s softer side as
he provides subtle and melodic improvisations. â€œBurning The Midnight
Lampâ€ from September 5, 1967, is just Hendrix squeezing every possible
sound from his guitar.

Disc three is dominated by alternate versions. It is nice to hear â€œHear My
Train A Cominâ€™â€ as a formative track as it was a concert staple. â€œSpanish
Castleâ€ and â€œRoom Full Of Mirrorsâ€ show subtle differences from the
recognized versions. Live versions of â€œLittle Wingâ€ and â€œVoodoo Childâ€
come complete with feedback and all sorts of distortion that only Hendrix
could produce on stage.

Disc four is a feast of unreleased material. â€œCountry Blues,â€ at over eight
minutes, â€œLover Man,â€ â€œCherokee,â€ and â€œSlow Bluesâ€ all make their
debuts. Hendrixâ€™ early producer, Chas Chandler, did not approve of Alan
Douglasâ€™ changing Hendrixâ€™s material and even taking writing credits
during the twenty years that he controlled Hendrixâ€™s catalogue of music.
When Jimiâ€™s family won back control in a court battle, Chandler turned
over a treasure trove of unreleased material to them. â€œIn From The
Stormâ€ and â€œSlow Bluesâ€ close out the set as they were recorded at the
Isle Of Wight Music Festival, August 30, 1970, just prior to Hendrixâ€™s
death.

The Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set is a valuable addition to the
Hendrix legacy. Not only does it expand the music that Hendrix left
behind but it also solidifies him as a genius of the guitar who forever
changed the use of that instrument and rock music..
