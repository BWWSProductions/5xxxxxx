1st person war simulator.

The squad medic lies moaning, bleeding out halfway back down the hill. Do you risk crawling the twenty metres on your belly to administer a field dressing? Dilemmas of choice are what sets Operation Flashpoint 2: Dragon Rising apart from the current glut of other first-person modern war fare. 

If you crawl back, you could wind up a target yourself. So do you call in your only howitzer strike against the machine gunners and riflemen pinning down your squad? It's a valuable resource, and even if you use it, your medic might be dead by the time you can get to him. Perhaps it's better to just make a panicked sprint for the trees while your squaddies lay down covering fire, to try and flank the entrenched enemy positions and then move on, leaving you without a medic mid-assault? 

Your choice.


If like me you installed the latest update (released 5/11/09) and it stopped your game from working. This will fix it.
