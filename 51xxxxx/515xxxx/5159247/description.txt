This is the Audiobook to the eighth Queen Betsy/Undead Series book, Undead and Unwelcome, by MaryJanice Davidson.

I've made each book into an .m4b (audio book format) file. I've also included the pdf file for the book. 

On a sidenote, I have absolutely NO IDEA where I downloaded this before.  I checked the normal places, and it's not anywhere. Strange.
