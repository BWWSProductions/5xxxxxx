Well, after mistakingly uploading a game that was already uploaded by someone else (Echo Night: Beyond), here's a game that wasn't around until now: Attack of the Saucerman.

As with Gex 3, the disc must be like 8-9 years old, yet it's still working (or at least used to work). There's something weird, though. In the original disc, the title song ("Attack of the Saucerman") was not working correctly. But when I burned the disc image, the title song on that disc is working properly. But now, the original disc that I made an image of is no longer working. What's up with that?

Also, I tried the image on ePSXe. I tried all of the sound plug-ins, but apparently the music is not working. So, if you want to hear the music, it seems that you must have a modded Playstation in order to hear it.

This is a very rare game, so if you like it, please seed it. If you have something to say, don't hesitate to leave a comment.
