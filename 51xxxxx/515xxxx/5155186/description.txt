Needless to...  This fourth entry in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise reunites the original stars: Michelle Rodriguez, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and of course the bad dude himself, Vin Diesel. Needless to say, there's going to be a lot of speed and demolition, especially in the fantastic opening truck hijack executed at amazing speeds by Dominic (Diesel) and his sexy partner in crime, Letty (Rodriguez). When Letty gets killed, it's revenge time, with the path of the bad guy leading Dominic back across the border to Los Angeles (where he's still wanted by the law) and into a high-stakes street race in which he's teamed up with his old nemesis, undercover fed Brian O'Conner (Walker). As in the original, Brewster makes a foxy love interest for Walker (she's Dom's kid sister), but there's not much time for kissing: there's races to be won, huge accidents to cause, and shady smuggling plots to foil. Fans of the series should be too busy digging the NO2-powered action to notice if there's anything missing in the storyline, which caterwauls along with gleeful abandon and disregard for logic, sanity, and speed limits. Directed with a sure hand by Justin Lin (TOKYO DRIFT), FAST & FURIOUS features loads of hot babes, and Diesel is as ripped, raging, and gravel-voiced deadpan as ever.
