Once again, thanks for seeding all of my previous torrents <=D

This is a discography containing all of John Lennon's major releases and then some! From the experimental music with Yoko Ono to the posthumous Milk and Honey album. Also included is the complete John Lennon Anthology containing outtakes and alternate versions of his songs and finally I have recollected all of Lennon's singles in one folder to avoid having to unnecesarily upload the several compilations available! All the mp3's are of various bitrates but in very high quality and each one includes the respective album art. Hopefully this material will be enough to satisfy the most die-hard of Lennon's fans!

Please help seed and enjoy!
