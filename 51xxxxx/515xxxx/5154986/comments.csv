,darrenc7394,2009-11-15T20:31Z,Followed instructions as it doesn't work. Game start screen loads & offers mic test or start game & pressing either option just freezes the game and goes no further.
,darrenc7394,2009-11-15T20:32Z,Does anyone know where to get this game that works on N5 card ?

,actionjackson2117,2009-12-20T15:22Z,"I forgot to add, you need to backup your old moonshell menu put it in a folder on your desktop. Then delete the old moonshell menu on your ds. Now drag the contents of DSTT ysmenu I gave onto your ds and it should work, well it did for me. The only other thing is, some games might not work so you might have to delete the DSTT ysmenu on your ds, then drag the old backup copy of the moonshell menu back onto your ds in order play some of the game that don't work with DSTT ysmenu. Hope this helps"
