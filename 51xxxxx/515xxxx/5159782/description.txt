PlayStation-Ready Movie Trailers
November 12, 2009


With this torrent I intend to fill an empty space in PlayStation Network
caused by Sony, and located in "Movies" section (happy american viewers,
that's not about you). Every Thursday, the day when PSN is updated,
I will create a torrent with every interesting movie trailer released
that week, in shining 1080p HD (and 5.1 sound if possible). Every file
was tested on PS3. Of course, it can be viewed on PC as well.

XBox 360 owners - please, try this and tell whether it shows!

Probably PSP/iPod version will follow.
Next week batch will be released Nov 21.
