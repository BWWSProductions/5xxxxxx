,100bugs,2010-01-16T09:43Z,"I downloaded the trial version from Paragon's web site (file smaller than the one in this torrent) and unlocked it with the keygen in this torrent.

NO PROBLEMO... 
and i know i didn't get any ""extras""..."
,100bugs,2010-01-16T12:43Z,"This is an awfully slow backup software!
Here is the test i did:

1- I started a full backup with paragon (pagefile.sys was excluded).
   (--> image size will be 208 Gb)
2- 20 min later, i started the same full backup with acronis true image (no exclusions at all).
   (--> image size will be 199 Gb)

note: At this point my quad cpu is loaded at 30 % only so both prog are running at full speed.

3- 2 hours 45 min later, acronis is finished but paragon is only 27% done."
