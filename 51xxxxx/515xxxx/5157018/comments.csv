,tibrusjer,2009-11-11T15:52Z,"Thanks, I do hope it works for everyone.
Gonna upload system requirement."
,unknowndeviant11,2009-11-11T17:38Z,"Out of curiosity, is STEAM included in this release, tibrusjer?"
,tibrusjer,2009-11-11T21:46Z,"No, sorry but it isn't.
If you want to download steam go to www.steampowered.com

Remember you need to buy the games if you're gonna play through steam.

You also need an account that can easily be setup through the guide in Steam. It's free but do not include any games."
,unknowndeviant11,2009-11-11T22:38Z,Most excellent! Don't care for Big Brother to watch me [illegally] play SP through Steam
,unknowndeviant11,2009-11-13T03:03Z,"Great download--only one negative: text displays as  glitched letters, can't read anything. Video and gameplay works perfectly, but cannot read any of the text, at all.

Any ideas?"
,unknowndeviant11,2009-11-13T03:04Z,"Ah, well. Too good of a game to scam...probably buying fairly soon here."
,tibrusjer,2009-11-13T11:14Z,Try changing the resolution :) May help.

,tibrusjer,2009-11-14T12:12Z,"Unknown:

Go to the options and change the resolution to something higher. Then it will fix itself.

Download WinRAR or 7-zip and open the first file with it ""open with""
It does of course not work online, this is a non Steam version and you'll need the Steam version with a valid CD-Key to play online."

,tibrusjer,2009-11-15T17:21Z,"You could try to update you DirectX, PhysX and graphic card driver..

Don't know if you need PhysX but it's better to be on the safe side :)"

,blackxz2,2009-12-05T17:47Z,"Update: The whole game was extracted from the 001 file. Is this correct? Did 7-Zip extract all the files in one go? I'd appreciate and answer soon please, I'm trying to free disk space."
,blackxz2,2009-12-06T14:30Z,"Also, I looked up Tech specs for the game, and it said the game was 16gb? And I tried to extract the 002 and 003 files, but it didnt work...

,OneUp-,2010-07-05T10:29Z,"Thanks for this, tibrusjer, great game!

I was just wondering if you knew how to get the in-game music to work. I know for some people its a pain in the ass, but I tend to enjoy the background music, but I don't hear any on my game, which made the credits awkward :P

Also, where is the ""miles"" folder that comes with it, or is that some special bull that steam added?

Big thanks for uploading!"

Thanks!"
,tibrusjer,2010-08-09T04:57Z,"It would be nice if you could give more info about what graphic card you have and driver..

Anyhow.. it says that this can be the solution.

Start ATI catalyst center

Of course, this only works if you have an ATI graphic card."

You may try another crack, it may have reverted the crack somehow. The Steam file you say it asks for is the file it authenticates with Steam and that's never a good thing with pirated content :)

I used 7zip to compress the files and it is recommended that you open the .001 file with 7zip and extract it wherever you desire.
______________________________________

This release isn't supporting multiplayer, but the multiplayer content is in there so if you have another crack or a multiplayer fix it should work here.
______________________________________

It is strongly recommended that you update your 
videocard driver
DirectX
Visual (something something I can't remember)
______________________________________

By following these steps the game should work probably (as long as you actually have the hardware to run the game).

I will not release Black Ops No Install 'cause of the horrid PC port."
