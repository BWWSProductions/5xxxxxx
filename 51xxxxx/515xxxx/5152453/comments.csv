,ferrari29,2009-11-15T04:19Z,Ok i couldnt get it to work at school! i host a match but when my friends try connecting it gets stuck at a black screen that says connecting but never connects! anyone know why?/
,jaug1337,2009-11-20T22:24Z,"make sure the school has LAN enabled and try playing with a LAN cable and turning the firewall of is a idea.. But since you are at school, it might be a problem. LAN cable is your only solution :)"
,mindslayer,2009-12-20T16:01Z,hey i extracted and started playing but i dont know why but my perks don't level up like comando i kill a stalker but it didnt count in the requirements. and when its chaging maps the game freezes and i have to restart my computer. do you have any solution to this?

and regarding the crash when changing map is something to do with the settings, they were adjusted after my pc, try to fix them around to adjust them so they will work generally after your own pc :)"

,HD4890,2011-07-02T13:56Z,"At first we couldn't get this working at school, it just gave a black screen with ""Connecting"" as DimDum explained. Eventually I stumbled upon a modified kf_revloader (try to google it) and we got it working. It was from some site that offered the same type of lan edition for download. Hope this helps.

Me & my schoolmates thank you Jaug :)"
