,Keithuk,2010-11-20T16:16Z,"Well I've tried to install this on WinXP SP3 and Vista 32bit. It installs but when you copy ATHris_VIVID_register.exe and crp32dll.dll in folder and run it its gives ERROR: can't initialize Crypkey, ATRis Technik or Vivid Workshop probably not installed. I copied CrypKey6.exe to the folder with ini but I get the same error."
,hamsventure,2010-12-09T05:38Z,"Hi Keithuk,
NOTE:  If program say can't find ARTis or VIVID, paths below are for English Windows only, for other language Windows paths are different.

       for VIVID copy ""ATRis_VIVID_register.exe"" and cryp32dll.ll to or simillar existing folders:

        ..\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\WorkshopData\0\

		Run ATRis_VIVID_register.exe to generate Site Code

NB: when there is cryp32dll.ll clash in the destination folder, click ""Yes"" to overwrite and follow the other steps in the installation instruction.  Spent one full day to figure this out as I also had the same problem."
,over-raid,2011-05-04T03:00Z,"good, I have a problem I did everything but the program starts and the loading is not out there help"
