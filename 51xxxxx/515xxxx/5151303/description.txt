Synopsis:

â€œ6.66 Death Happenâ€ is about the deathâ€™s mystery puzzle when the cycle of oneâ€™s life gets interrupted. Usually it begins with the birth and ends with death. And after death people will get rebirth once again. But in this case the death will get another death. This is rather unusual as people do not get two deaths continuously in the lifeâ€™s cycle.

Crime reporter Dao (Susie-Susira Angelina Nanna) has to uncover strange and unexplainable incidents in the next 24 hours. She received news from the hospital that her father (Yodchai Meksuwan) has been miraculously resurrected from the death after being dead for more than 15 consecutive years since the departure of her mother.

She experiences few incidents that are related to death such as feeling wanting to die and is determined to find out the truth about it. Joining her is an old-time police friend, Wut (Jason Young) who is interested to discover the truth about her fatherâ€™s resurrection story. Both are battling the power of death and she may as well become the next victim...
