,axello,2009-11-07T11:28Z,"""1. This is Steam version of the game that requires
online activation/key, both will officialy be possible
at the day of the release (10th November), you will not be
able to install this until the official release date unless
some1 provides some kind of workaround, crack for it,
its here for those who want it.""

Seems shit, even though its the real version"
,JVDx,2009-11-07T11:29Z,"thanks for the upload, looks real enough.
and its true about the steam stuff, hopefully some crackers will be able to do something :P"
,millz1987,2009-11-07T11:43Z,this is real i tried installing it and it started installing steam in russian so i scrapped it and went to steam website and downloaded english version then went bk to install cod6 then it went straight to asking me for a serial key if i could bypass all tht maybe theres a way b4 release date if anyone knows how to do this let us know 
,JVDx,2009-11-07T11:50Z,"i really have no idea how to bypass it, but perhaps with a cracked steam? you have special steams which allow you to download all games from steam for free, perhaps try it with that. ( no idea )
keep up the seeding, downloading at 1mb/s avg."

,PrikoloJs,2009-11-07T14:42Z,"""Mbb15u"" 
U can't install it until 10 november, not play it until 10 november. READ NFO !!!
"
[V],Mbb15,2009-11-07T15:10Z,"@PrikoloJs 

ok but not play is the same as not install because you cant play the game ive you havent installed it "
,JVDx,2009-11-07T15:42Z,"i dont think changing the bios date will make it work, because you need to activate the key through steam before installing it.
tho there has to be a way to bypass it..
ill mess around, its finished in 15 seconds."
,JVDx,2009-11-07T15:59Z,"well its real, like expected, and its russian.
heres a picture from me to prove it.

,h3ll4b0y,2009-11-07T18:52Z,"look people! there are no serials till the date of the release, so either you don't download it and wait for the ENGLISH release, or you download this in russian and won't have to spend one more day to download it at the day of the release and wait til there's a crack available, come on people be happy those russian got it for you already"
,h3ll4b0y,2009-11-07T18:58Z,"okay okay maybe there will be serials or cracks, but i don't think steam will accept any serials before the date of the release right? that's normal"
,JVDx,2009-11-07T19:14Z,thats why we need some1 who can bypass that steam crap and install it anyway ;)

and you cant play this yet."

als jij een crack hebt zou je het kunnen spelen, otherwise is het een kwestie van wachten op een crack."

je kan beter wachten tot reloaded of razor oid een release uitbrengt met crack/patch."
