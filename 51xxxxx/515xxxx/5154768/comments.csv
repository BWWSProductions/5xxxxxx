,Metallist666,2009-11-13T23:41Z,Is it english version?
[V],thethingy,2009-11-14T02:23Z,it's english. You can change the language when installed though.
,frank989,2009-11-14T07:16Z,will this torrent work on Windows 7?
[V],thethingy,2009-11-14T17:52Z,yes
[V],thethingy,2009-11-15T03:41Z,download majic disc (free) or power iso from pp and mount the images or use winrar to extract the files from the images.
,donatello81,2009-11-15T17:00Z,"Hi

When I run the Enterprise file (Setup) it says that ""Setup is unable to proceed due to the following error: 
To install and use this product on a computer, the computer must run at least Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).

But how can I install Service when I don't have installed the main program, Enterprise?"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-15T19:05Z,"you need to be using microsoft windows XP service pack 2 at least to install office 07.

,donatello81,2009-11-15T19:09Z,"Thank you, I will try that!"
,donatello81,2009-11-16T20:36Z,"Hi again thethingy.

I downloaded and installed the new Windows XP you told me. But now I have another problem. The language in Windows XP is now set on english and I need swedish. Is the swedish language included in this version? I installed it once again but I could not choose the language.."
,donatello81,2009-11-17T20:18Z,"I fixed the problem on the control panel.
Thanks for the download!"
,i555007,2009-11-18T09:41Z,"None of these office 2007 work after slecting the setup.exe i get ""setup cannot find the required setup controller file....
or if i select excitable i recive an error 1713 setup cannot install!

My OS is XP pro. 64 bit.

as you can see my spelling sucks i really need Microsoft office!"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-18T14:47Z,"all of them work just fine.

follow the instructions.

install office enterprise first,, that contains all of the office setups. you only use the one setup for all of them.

then install the plugins because you cant install a plugin until you have installed office enterprise.

with xp when you mount the iso or put the cd in that you burned from the iso the setup starts automatically,, you only need click install.

if yours does not autostart then open the cd/iso and click on the only setup.exe that is in the first window. "
,i555007,2009-11-18T19:48Z,"Instructions:

1. Open the 'setup.exe' file and type one of this serial codes:******* ***** *****

2. Folow on screen instructions, select the components you want to install and... ENJOY using fully licensed Microsoft Office 2007!


Not very helpful... I just says the same thing every time, then says DEP has closed this program, windows audio device graph isolation.

Burn a CD? I'm installing from my hard-drive, instructions don't say anything about burning a CD, nor do i have a burner anyways."
[V],thethingy,2009-11-18T23:44Z,"hello,

i think you have installed a trial or other office that has not uninstalled properly. if so use this to fix the problem;

this is like the simplest thing there is to install!"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-19T01:51Z,"and youre quote;

is not from this torrent so try downloading this one and following the instructions for this one"
,i555007,2009-11-19T02:18Z,"nope fresh hard drive, ran the install off the link 
and it came up with one office 2007 so i removed it
but still has the same setup error "
,i555007,2009-11-19T02:24Z,"just had an idea, I have a hard drive from a old system that I'm copying files from, that hard drive has office XXXX on it could that be the problem? "
,i555007,2009-11-19T08:11Z," I downloaded this torrent among two others here, none worked so I downloaded one from 
http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/125149069/office+2007?tab=summary
It installed fine, no errors "
[V],thethingy,2009-11-19T16:48Z,"good for you!, why download 3?, anyway this works 100%"
,i555007,2009-11-19T19:50Z,"Well, because I needed a ?working? copy "
[V],thethingy,2009-11-19T20:18Z,"this one is an unmodified microsoft cd, you dont get more ?working? than that."
,nykohchyn,2009-11-20T16:07Z,"I cannot believe how easy this is. All the problems commented upon by others scared me, but once I got the Magic Disc figured out, it took me no longer than my processor was capable of to do this. YAY! You made my day!"

,maurysep,2009-12-18T21:18Z,"did i have to install the service pack?, i have windows 7 ultimate 64 just installed on my laptop and office 2007 is working just perfect"
[V],thethingy,2009-12-19T14:23Z,"not if u dont want to, the service packs add more features to office like saving as pdf and allows the ability to open and create open sorce office files, usefull but not nesasary."
,jko081264,2010-03-17T17:58Z,"Hi people, i've installed windows 7 recently and afterwards i've installed office enterprise 2007. When windows is been updated and you'll start outlook you'll get the message that office isn't legit."
[V],thethingy,2010-03-17T18:51Z,"jko081264, downloade the genuine update like an idiot, dident you, stop posting that same statement on all my torrents.

fix the problem with this;

,sweaterpuppies1,2010-09-11T22:59Z,What is the sha1 hash of this iso? I would like to confirm with Technet that it is official iso.
,sweaterpuppies1,2010-09-14T04:13Z,"Anyone interested
sha1: e851bb92de9a1146d26b88d56e8a0b000760e7bf
md5: 76f8b8c6c1e30582649f75c8ab64c876

Doesn't match any of the Technet versions, probably just an older revision. thethingy is a trustable guy."
,soltotake,2010-10-24T23:26Z,Okay I have installed the software and now windows update has security updates for all the applications then 2 updates for it in all then one update that is for system help with common features should i download and install them?
,cesar5654,2011-01-05T17:40Z,im trying to install this but it keeps saying that.....nevermind i got it to work!
,tophtml,2011-03-22T02:49Z,"Thanks for this GREAT upload.  Easy to unpack and install.  When the activators are figured into the equation, this is a vastly more desirable download than Office 2010."
