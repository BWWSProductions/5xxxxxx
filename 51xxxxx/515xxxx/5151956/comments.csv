Video Q is Very Good! Not grainy or blocky like many seen around. I'd say 9.5

Audio is also Very Good. Could have been a bit louder but very crisp quality non the less. 9

As Far as the Show? Come on, it's Monsters vs Aliens!!! The Most Excellent Animation, Writing & Actor Voicing Humor Yet... 
Doesn't get any Better! 10 of 10
Hope they make many more!
Great Download!
