She has been playing in different friends' bands since she was 14 in England and in France. Her first support show was for Steve Vai aged 15.

Orianthi was also Michael Jackson's lead guitarist and was present on all rehearsals for his This Is It tour before his death. In regards to being handpicked by Jackson, she stated:

â€œ I donâ€™t know exactly why he picked me, but he watched myvideos and loved them. He had his choice of guitar players, but I came in and played the â€˜Beat Itâ€™ solo for him. Afterward he was so happy he got up and grabbed my arm and started walking up and down the stage area with me. He said, â€˜Can you play once for me?â€™ He hired me that night. I wish he was still around. He made me believe in myself more, and I learned so much. Going into it, I thought it would be all about playing guitar solos. But the majority of it was playing chords and funky rhythms. â€ 

She played and sang at Jackson's memorial, globally televised live on July 7, 2009. She appears in the film Michael Jackson's This Is It, which chronicles the rehearsals for the tour. Her hit single song "According to You" was the Single of the Week on iTunes on October 27, 2009
