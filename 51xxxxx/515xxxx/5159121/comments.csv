so I suggest you go get dvddecrypter from another location then using the one in this torrent."

false alarm,there isn't any virus on the SetupDVDDecrypter_3.5.4.0.exe,I used my Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 (Fully original not cracked) to scan the SetupDVDDecrypter_3.5.4.0.exe and found out there are no threats

If u don't believe me,here is a screenshot to prove it
