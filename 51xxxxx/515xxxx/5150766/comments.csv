,alexxx713,2009-12-15T23:48Z,IS THIS A EXPASION OR A GAME???
,Darkraider41,2009-12-29T19:47Z,"I just downloaded this torrent and tried to install the expansion. I followed the instructions but when I tried to update, it said that the language was not the same as what I have installed. I'm running the USA release of Sacred 2."

,Wisher_SiD,2010-06-21T15:40Z,"It seems like RELOADED missed a few files essential for ice and blood and also some bug that affects the game on windows 7...here is the link to the fix:
Just copy the cracked content (pak folder) to your gamefolder...
P.S. It should also fix Dragon Mage character,but it didnt work for me :\ "

,kithylin,2011-02-11T21:17Z,"Just so you know this is the UK version of the expansion and it WILL NOT INSTALL if you have the US version of the game. While running setup.exe after mounting the image it comes up saying ""The language version of this patch is not compatible with the installed version of Sacred 2.""

I just wasted 2 hours downloading this... sigh."
,rajeevrn,2011-03-03T13:49Z,"dear extremezone,

can you please reupload Kings Bounty: The legend...the other torrents dont work or have very few seeds and slow speed...thankyou"
,FernFrond,2011-04-30T00:39Z,"i Have the UK version and all I did was clean install the regular game to get rid of the previous crack i had for 2.34 and then i installed all the updates from 2.12 to 2.4 then applied the crack. THen you have to get a sacred 2 blood and ice reloaded fix a different torrent file to put into 
""pak"" and when asked to replace say yes. THen you have to restart the game to havet the dragon mage load. It's a cool class, but i might stick with my warrior for now."
,daniels22,2011-07-25T15:28Z,"Hello!

The 2.65.1 patch doesn't work for me, it says error, when I double-clicked on the exe. I have the RELOADED version of the Ice&Blood by extremezone: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5150766/Sacred_2_Ice_And_Blood_RELOADED, and the Fallen Angel (12.7 gb) by circlensess: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4462201/Sacred_2__Fallen_Angel. Both of them are UK version, so I had no problem to play with 2.64.0.0 patch. Do I need to download the bigger (about 19.98 gb) size of Fallen Angel? If so, then the Makan747 or the circlensess?: http://thepiratebay.org/search/Sacred%202/0/5/0"
,chazaka,2012-04-12T01:11Z,"So i got dragon mage to work and the game hardly if ever crashes with one exception and heres how. Windows 7 btw.

Install sacred2 from reloadeds torrent but only discs one and two do not install the third for ""elite"" after this use the right patch from this torrent to patch your game so that you can install ice and blood. 

install ice and blood. then use the reloaded fix for it. 

go to your appdata/local/sacred2 and delete Options.txt

put a new textfile in that folder called optionsCustom.txt and pus this in that text file

settings.usePhysHW = 0
render.d_patchPhysics = 0
video.detail_physx = 0

save that and you should be able to play full game with even dragon mage and it should rarely crash if ever."
,tchness,2012-04-25T20:13Z,is this the UK version?
,igadoter,2012-07-11T11:30Z,thanks to uploader..I managed to install this on my non-english version ...but now of course it is english-only...also thanks to @chazaka....
