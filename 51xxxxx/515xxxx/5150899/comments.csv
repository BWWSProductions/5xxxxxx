,share00,2009-12-02T03:14Z,"why is the description written in a language other than english,,, but the movie is ENGLISH ...

write the fuckin desc in the SAME language that the movie is in"
,Nlmichiej,2009-12-05T14:21Z,@ share00: primarily because the 2Lions-team puts these movies online for Dutch people (hence the Dutch subtitles). And if you look just a little bit better you see an English description too...
