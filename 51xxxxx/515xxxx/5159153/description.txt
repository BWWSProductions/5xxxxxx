Here are the audiobooks to the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. The First book is read by Ari Graynor, and the last two are read by Natalie Moore.

I've made each book into an .m4b (audio book format) file. These are actually smaller in size, and they work perfectly on your iPod. I've Also included pdf files for each of the three books.

For some reason, I couldn't make it so that there was only one m4b file per book, it just would let me.
