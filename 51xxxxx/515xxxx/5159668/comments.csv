[V],Morck22,2009-11-12T23:05Z,"Nooo, sorry you dont understand it, sorry....

Its a rip from PAL but not region locked.


So Region Free at all.

No way to change PAL to NTSC."

,Blaze1992,2009-11-13T01:04Z,"You seem like a complete noob.

What the uploader means to say is that the Game itself is actually PAL, but will run every console, whether it is NTSC, PAL, NTSC/J etc because it is not REGION LOCKED to only PAL i.e. Region Free"
