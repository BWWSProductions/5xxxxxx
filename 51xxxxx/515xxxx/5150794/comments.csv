,Dutch_Watcher,2009-11-09T23:41Z,"This movie isn't a movie and it sucks hard.
Chris isn't funny. You (almost) only see black people, which is also not funny (because I don't get that). Even worse, this version has the text ""Property of Roadside Attractions"" continuously onscreen.

,blessed364,2009-12-05T01:15Z,a10 v10 I think it was a great movie. Very educational. It gives you insight on what color people go through 2 look good. He's letting out our secrets in a documentry.

,blackbeauty1,2010-01-01T23:30Z,"Fuck you RiggyRiggs you racist white fuck I wish I can see you so I can fuck your shitty ass up you are blessed I can't get to you, And Dutch Watcher you sound stupid writing that comment first of all its a black movie about black people DAH thats why you almost only see black people. I watch alot of movie where i only see FUCKING WHITE PEOPLE. Ignorant ass fucks."
,blackbeauty1,2010-01-01T23:34Z,RiggyRiggs news flash theres a whole lot of stupid white movies did your mama direct those?
,GreatnessJ1,2010-01-17T09:54Z,"""You almost only see black people"" You do know that is a documentary about the issue of 'good hair' versus 'bad hair', right? Like y'all know that this isn't supposed to be a straight up comedy, it's actually about an issue that we, black people, as a community struggle with. Seeing these ignorant comments on this movie torrent, is like seeing someone post something like ""They're almost always in space - and space is retarded"" on a Star Trek torrent. Good to know the internet is still overrun with morons. "
,ashleysmashley007,2010-02-07T22:50Z,"@riggyriggs...
its obvious tyler perry didnt direct or produce this one.. it doesnt follow the same plot as every other movie he has created thusfar.. no one gets married, no one dies, no one cheats and there is no obvious moral to the end of the story.. this is just a documentary which from what ive seen so far is pretty dang hilarious being half black i get some of the stuff he is talking about.. its hilarious. unless you can relate to this somehow you wont get it."
,djbiggins,2010-06-26T21:54Z,"im a white boy and i thought the film was ok, what you colord people have to go through for great hair is unreal, oh and dont forget us whites have had some pretty awful hairstyles that are still in use even today e.g. the bowl cut and my favorite the mullet

and to those above with the rascist comments, i say no need for it dudes 

black, white, yellow, brown, we eat, we shit, we bleed, we sleep, we reproduce, we are all the fucking same"
,d.d.dudes.dad,2011-01-24T21:32Z,Colord(sic) people.  Really?  Good vid about afro hair and the challenges.  Shut up.
,Liensrii,2011-07-13T10:54Z,"Personally I think this movie is GREAT!  This is coming from a white girl.  I work with cosmetics and I think ANYONE white or black should watch this movie.  For ONE:
It details Sodium Hydroxide which is basically Lye (The ingredient they used in WW2 on the Jews as torture) and Sodium Hydroxide is it MANY products that both White and Balck people use.  MAINLY BODY WASH!!!  Lye is TERRIBLE for you skin and if you get it on your skin it burns right through to the bone.  Even though the products of body and hair wash use other ingredients to break down the lye compound of the Sodium Hydroxide so that it's not LETHAL...it still has the ability to damage your skin if used constantly.  

All in all a great educational film and it is pretty funny.  Chris Rock, regardless of the rep he has as a racists is pretty well educated.
