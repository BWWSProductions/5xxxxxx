,smokkapi,2009-11-12T18:23Z,"This is the worst animation movie I've seen for ages. The storyline sucks, Its obviously not supposed to be funny. Not even exciting. Even if I was just a kid, I would still say that its a terrible movie. Its french I think, Kinda figures.
Good quality, But what does that matter since the movie is crap."
,lucinho,2009-11-12T22:11Z,"i have a problem with the audio, everythings fine but theres no voice when the guys are speaking, i dont think its a codec problem because til today ive managed to see many other movies with the stuff i have, so please help, i really wanna see the movie"

,sentient1,2009-11-16T01:14Z,"larabail- ""IM THINKING THATS ALL U KNOW UR UNCLE BYE U REDNECK INBRED SISTER FINGERING MOTHER FUCKER""

,jbr4353,2009-12-14T06:26Z,"why does everyone have to make fun of rednecks? we do not hurt anyone and, yes, we do even have bachelor of science engineering degrees. 

@ larabail  go back to high school and learn some common sense and get a few english lessons. then go to college and take calculus 2 and then you can have an opinion. 

due to all the good comments, i'm going to check this movie out. thx for the up cgaurav007"
,TauTau154,2009-12-16T07:35Z,"Great upload, got it in about 30 minutes, over 600 kb/s.  A & V: 10.  BTW I didn't really like the movie (SPOILER ALERT KIND OF) because I expected Christopher Walken to have a big cartoon movie, but it wasn't so...he gets five minutes and he's done with the movie...but other than that, it's a pretty good movie.  I'm just a fan of Walken and was disappointed by that fact.  :-P "
