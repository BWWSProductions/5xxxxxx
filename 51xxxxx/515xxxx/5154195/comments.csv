,microbee,2009-11-11T10:50Z,"My apologies for the slow upload, there are a shit load of leechers. I will seed 24/7 for a month, should be several hundred gig.

If you download this torrent please seed at least 10 gig, that will be 1:1 sharing.

Cheers."
,Christley,2009-11-28T23:15Z,"i sure hope this one doesnt have hardcoded english subs, cause then i will freak out"
,stakamaka,2009-12-12T06:47Z,"Spokemon language English even for 12th one?
Not even released yet.. hoped for raw."
,Black666Widow,2009-12-28T13:36Z,download finished in 2h. seeded 10gigs and continuing
,tibrusjer,2010-01-08T13:07Z,"I'm sorry to bother, but it seems to be a codec problem with the second movie.

Freezes always on the same spots.
Tried VLC and MPC to run but the same thing happends.

Wouldn't mind a link to another release.
Thanks!

PS: Besides that problem, thank you so much!"
,Movieguy26,2010-01-09T03:53Z,SEED!!!! There's 99 people sitting there with all these movies. Start pumping out the bandwith! GIVE BACK to the community will ya!!!! my god
,wordondastreet,2010-01-19T20:15Z,"Yeah, confirming that the 2nd movie (The Power of One) is really messed up. It will freeze really frequently. Don't bother downloading that one."
,microbee,2010-01-22T05:18Z,"Yep, Power of One is a shit rip. I had problems at first but now it runs fine. Not sure what I did exactly but probably this:

Windows 7
Windows Media Player Classic Home Cinema
Shark007 Codecs pack

Should work fine with that combo."
,justin2268,2010-03-04T08:12Z,Can we get some more seeders please?

,hellowren,2010-03-20T07:57Z,"do these have the pikachu shorts in them? if not, does anyone know where I can get a collection of all the pikachu/pokemon shorts from the beginning of the movies?"
,Devil_Spawn,2010-03-23T15:48Z,can you still download with more leechers than seeders
,microbee,2010-03-30T13:26Z,"Yes, it includes Pokemon 2000. It's ALL the Pokemon movies ever made.

It also has the Pikachu shorts at the beginning of the movies."
,leetality,2010-04-05T20:53Z,@Squigoth Yes it has the 2000 movie (Power of One) but it's messes up for most and skips frames a lot.
,knufje,2010-04-06T23:59Z,"thx for the upload, but will you guys say that it is extremely childish for an 18 year old to watch these?"
,strahlfort,2010-04-13T03:53Z,"this doesn't have the pikachu short movies at the start of the first and second movies btw. a little disappointing, especially since the uploader claims in the comment section that they are included... but hey, guess you can't complain when you get it for free..."
,freedomgreek,2010-04-21T23:34Z,Can Someone Give me Links For Greek subs for This movies ? i have look but find only for one movie .... THnQ

,Link_Life,2010-08-18T21:16Z,"VLC won't play any of these for some reason. Just gets a bunch of errors saying it can't play, say, the files ""Pokemon,"" ""1"", ""The"", ""First"", ""Movie"", or ""(1998)"". Yeah, I don't know. They play in everything else though, and sync to my xbox for TV watching, so it's all good. Thanks for the upload! :D Will seed at least 1:1."

,oktsme88,2011-03-19T21:26Z,"I've had problems with the 4th movie, Celebi: Voice of the Forest. I only get sound, no video. Same problem with another source on PB. Anyone with the same problem? Thanks for the rest of them. They work fine."

,Korkemannen,2011-05-04T14:06Z,"Can someone please tell me where to download a better version of Pokemon The Power of One? It lags every minute and is at this point unwatchable.

Anyway thanks for the torrent, you're a genius my good man."

,snowolf69,2011-09-09T19:32Z,"Children of the 90's say WHAAAAT!
I still have the first movie on VHS but no player :(
I almost cried with awesome watching the first movie again. Guilty pleasures FTW!
Done in 7 hours and long-seeding."
,snowolf69,2011-09-09T19:34Z,"V:4-7 A:3-8

Quality increases with the newer movies but hey, I don't have a VHS to Digital machine so I'm not complaining."
,call_me_nobody,2011-09-21T04:56Z,power of one freezes a few houndred times during the movie
,mojo5040,2011-09-22T21:48Z,"its stuck at 99,9% 

movie 4. 99,6%
?

anyone else?"
,Fireskrit,2011-10-21T11:05Z,"Yeah,I agree with call_me_nobody.. Second Movie ""Power of One"" freezes pretty much every few minutes, impossible to watch. Plus ""The First Movie"" isn't too great either. Not disrespecting the upload, but I do have both on video and even they are better quality than this. Just wondering what's been used to convert the files to dvd format because they've obviously lost A LOT of quality."
,SH1NYo4RCAN1NE,2011-11-04T23:00Z,PokĂŠmon ftw! 
,.Br0sef.,2011-12-07T23:22Z,"Would you be able to get the newest one that came out in theatres on December 3rd and 4th?
Oh, and A: 10 V:10.
Great upload!"
,.Br0sef.,2011-12-07T23:27Z,"Oh, and regarding anyone with the ""Power of one"" movie problem, the only other source I could find that has a working one is this one; http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/4927862/Pokemon__Movie_Collection_(11_Films) 
Just delete the extras and you should be fine.
BTW, the quality on it is at least 720p. Enjoy."
,yelloo,2011-12-21T20:31Z,Thanks microbee.
,LuddeZz,2012-01-04T11:03Z,Its very bad audio on pokemon 10! A: 3
,Chromish,2012-04-17T01:03Z,"The quality on this torrent is Rhyperior; almost Swablu-ray! I also find that the Mew-sic and audio isn't too Loudred or soft to hear. The file size isn't Gastly either. Make sure you Seedot this, or I'll Pichu to it!"
,Pikamoo,2012-04-21T03:43Z,"Very great torrent. I've had no problems with any of the videos as of now. They're good quality, and small file sizes.

I highly recommend this torrent to you all."
,Sam021,2012-06-06T01:35Z,"It took me 1 day and 17 hours to download. Not bad considering there are a lot of leechers. I will Seed 10GB (already at 3GB) and I would want to ask everyone to do so, giving the possibility to people to download it at a fast speed. 
The quality is good, not perfect but good. Pokemon 10 (rise of darkrai) has bad audio quality in my opinion. Other than that, thanks a lot microbee. "
,jaketrek,2012-07-11T21:47Z,"If you upload at least how much it was, then you are paying it forward, but its better to upload twice as much as you download. right now I have horrible internet so I have downloaded a total of 25 gigs, and uploaded a lousy 6.7)=... tomorrow I get charter, and my upload will rape at 4 mbps! instead of a lousy .5. Hell ya!"
