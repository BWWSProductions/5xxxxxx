Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56 

11/09/09 Rundown: Opie's Hornet Story / Bees, Uncle Paul, Ant's
Movies / Bad Movie Discussion, Football, Joan Baez, being "PC", 
Racist Movies, Fedor, Sharon Osbourne's Susan Boyle fallout. 



Note: I was planning on "retiring" in December - but I will 
still do 128k vbr ups in the evenings for those that want them.
We're looking good on someone doing early ups for those used to 
having the show early too, so it's all good.
