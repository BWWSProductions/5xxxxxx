I bet it's just you, there are 76 comments for this same torrent on demon0id and nobody mentions audio problems with tremors 2."
,lilkiss,2010-08-13T09:53Z,thanks for this old skool movie one of my favs
,deathtrooper30,2010-09-06T18:34Z,That buzz is from ur dumb ass turning ur speakers up on that crap music they put out now days.
,Wufmix,2010-10-02T22:05Z,"I get the same buzz, and it's not because of volume. The second movie is the only media I'm getting this buzz on, it's not on the other movies, or an other movie or audio on my computer. However, it's not constant throughout the movie. You can hear it at around 3:53-4:00 minutes into the movie, and various points throughout.

So a couple points off of Audio for Aftershocks, but great quality for the others~

Always been a fan of tremors, and it's great to see these high quality videos available. Thanks for sharing!"
