well this is my first torrent and after watching Rip a remixers manifesto, i say fuck intellectual property lets all share.
after dowloading alot of stuff from here is just natural that i give a little something.
plus i havent see this bad boy anywhere so enjoy.
its just the.gog samples from the steven slate library, dont ask me for the wav's or the interface i just have this samples, but is enough if you have drumagog.
you will see what i mean.
please enjoy and keep sharing.
