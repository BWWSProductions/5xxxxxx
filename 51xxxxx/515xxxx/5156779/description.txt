***The Killers - Live from the Royal Albert Hall*** - 2009 - 320kbps


Rather than filming one of their massive UK arena shows earlier this year (the band sold out an incredible 150,000 tickets in just two hours of going on sale), The Killers chose to film at the Royal Albert Hall, a venue with which they fell in love when they played an exclusive launch show for their million-selling (UK) third album, Day & Age, last November. This beautiful and historic room, built by Queen Victoria in memory of her Prince Albert in 1871, now holds a special place for the band. As, indeed, does the venue hold the band in its heart ∩┐╜ an image of The Killers is painted within its corridors in a graffiti installation alongside other previous artists to have famously played there, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Hendrix, Clapton, Sinatra and Pavarotti.

'The Killers ∩┐╜ Live From The Royal Albert Hall' features tracks from the band∩┐╜s three studio albums, Hot Fuss (2004), Sam∩┐╜s Town (2006) and Day & Age (2008) - including huge hit singles Human, Spaceman, When You Were Young, Read My Mind, Mr Brightside, Somebody Told Me and All These Things That I've Done - as well as rarer tracks including a cover of Joy Division∩┐╜s Shadowplay and fan favourite Sweet Talk (from the 2007 collection of rarities, Sawdust)
