I met Danni Rosner at the Future of Music Conference during the annual Pho dinner at the Nam Viet restaurant in Washington DC. I had a nice little Jack Daniels buzz going that evening and met her when I ducked outside to smoke a cigarette. She was standing there chatting with someone holding a CD in her hand so I said hi and mentioned I was a writer which scored me a copy of "Piano Actress", her new album.

She asked me if I wanted to come see her perform live in New York and, after checking schedule, I realized that I was going to be in the city that day. I had been wanting to do some video in a small venue anyway and it seemed like a good opportunity to test my cam in those conditions (low light, questionable acoustics). I pitched the video idea to her and she thought it would be cool too.

There are supposed to be like 5 million bands on Myspace and so many of them have no video or really crappy videos shot by somebody's friend at a live show and that is their only representation to fans. A good video can be like a digital business card for a band, winning new fans and opening doors to venues. A bad video does the opposite. I wanted to be able to produce a good, low cost video option for unknown bands without a whole lot of cash and this film and the associated music vids are my first attempt to do that.

Danni's new album "Piano Actress" is available on her website and through Amazon and iTunes. If you go to her website now I am pretty sure she still has at least one free song for you to download.
