,CaptainEO27,2009-11-08T16:57Z,are you seriously going to download 50gb of rar files? go to mjtorrents and get all the MJ stuff you need.
,Grizzly Adams,2009-11-30T12:32Z,"Yes, what an insane torrent. 48GB of what? Anybody who's such a fan that they're gonna downloaded 48GB obviously is gonna have quite a few of these files already, but because you make it .rar you don't give them the option of deselecting what they already have. Plus, who's gonna unzip 48GB and then keep seeding a 48GB rar file? All up you'd be using 100GB of space.

I'm also thinking this is actually probably 48GB worth of Steven Seagal movies or something like that. "
