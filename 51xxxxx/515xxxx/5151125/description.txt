In Swedish with embedded subtitle tracks in English, Norwegian and Svenska.

This is a great movie offering from Sweden although it will depress you to
view it in its entirety if you have any sensitivity on the issues that are
raised in it.

You may be familiar with some of the history of the great Irish spirited folk
who were sent packing from Britain and headed to a lovely land today they call
Australia. It is my sincere view and hope that the future leadership for the
world will in fact come from this continent island as I think our best
successes have been achieved there in a way that best guides the most human
spirit we see having survived such similar evolutionary factors as to make them
special for our purposes here. The point is that harsh treatment and insanely
cruel standards of justice have often been applied in times of great economic
depression or in areas devoid of real spiritual guidance in favour of religious
fundamentalism of the extremist variety.

This movie speaks to the issues of harsh justice in the grief that befalls a
fine young couple that you see above. The man is quite Irish spirited as we
understand the genre and the lovely wife with him is in fact well meaning and
well intentioned for him and grief is all that we see come in this tragic tale
of cruelty that seems to find little to comfort those suffering in the
circumstances of near starvation conditions and the extremely harsh penalties
meted out in these conditions as I refer to above here.

The Swedes are a warm humanistic people who give the Irish their spirit in
what all admire as Christianly beauty. Thats a great enough legacy to always
consider that they are family roots to those of us that come from this spirit
and in this respect this movie is greatly interesting to view to avoid mistakes
that have known to befall the great spirited folk that come from this world.
