,PirateRED,2010-02-04T15:45Z,"Thanks for the great release. Always the best size/quality ratio.

I just got one complaint. The audio in both vid and your Law Abiding Citizen ups are 200ms late. (-200 adjust)
Thanks again."
,Zirgon,2010-08-21T19:03Z,Why did I get no audio with this torrent?
,Zirgon,2010-08-21T22:23Z,"nevermind. It comes with audio. I just had to merge the audio with the video. Usually they would be in the same file, no???

Anyways thankyou for the upload!"
,dzver666,2011-01-23T04:49Z,Audio is out of sync by little but enough annoying to ruin watching an excellent movie...
