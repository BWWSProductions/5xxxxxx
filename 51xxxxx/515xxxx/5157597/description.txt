Storyline: When 9 first comes to life, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans

roam the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them 
no good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the
