Here are the SS.bin, DMI.bin, PFI.bin, and video.iso files you need to patch Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. 

1.) Open your ISO image in ABGX

2.) Click the "Manually Patch or Extract Files" tab

3.) CHECK the 6 boxes on the left

4.) Click the "...'s" next to Patch Video, PFI, DMI, and SS and navigate to the ones you downloaded with this torrent.

5.) Click the "Autofix" tab and select Level 3

6.) Click the "Misc" tab and select your Region Code and change SplitVid to: "Add it if it doesn't exist or isn't valid."

7.) Click LAUNCH!


This will patch your game CORRECTLY for Wave 4. WHICH MEANS YOU NEED 1.61 on SAMSUNG OR BENQ or 1.5 ON HITACHI.

I included instructions in the torrent as well.
