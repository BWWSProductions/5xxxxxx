,JTyler1990,2009-11-07T02:08Z,video file isnt there to patch... i unzipped it but when i click the file to patch the vid it will not find it
,Haroldm,2009-11-07T02:31Z,the video file is in there. make sure you navigate to the correct directory and make sure you have all the boxes on the left checked.
,Marques777,2009-11-07T08:16Z,i just got console ban today and i think i forgot to patch the files is that the reason? or is it just because the game isn't out yet ? should i be safe after i do this?
,Haroldm,2009-11-07T16:39Z,I'd say it's because the game isn't out yet. These files are so you're able to play the game correctly as some torrents of this game have some wrong data. The only way to be *safe* is to wait until the game is out and then run it through ABGX and stealth the ISO.
,JTyler1990,2009-11-08T01:47Z,"i have all the boxes ticked and through my documents i can see the video file but when i want to load it into abgx via (...) it doesnt come up. 


one other thing so if we dont patch the game and play after released am i still safe? or should i patch?"
,Haroldm,2009-11-08T02:03Z,"Ummm ok at the bottom of the ""open"" box that comes up click the drop down arrow and select view all or something like that.

and no, you're never ever 100% safe but I would DEFINITELY stealth patch it after it comes out. "
,JTyler1990,2009-11-08T02:07Z,"ooo yh lol found it... abgx says not correct game partition or something in red writing.

Also have you any tips on flashing xbox's? thanks :)"
,Haroldm,2009-11-08T05:06Z,"yep it says that because abgz doesnt support Wave 4 yet. And yeah, google ""JungleFlasher"" and ""JungleFlasher"" tutorial for everything you need. There are tons of vids you can watch and JungleFlasher even has a kick ass guide built in."
