If the ripper hadn't wasted space putting ""J.S. Bach"" and seven character code numbers and a second superfluous track number, like so ""BWV1055 - 01 "" , in every track's title perhaps there would have been room for each track's actual title. Also the albums are called ""Bach - The Keyboard Concertos"" Vol 1 and 2 respectively.
