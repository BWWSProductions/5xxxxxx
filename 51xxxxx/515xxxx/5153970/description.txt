Alice, 32, a writer recovering from a psychological

breakdown retreats to a remote Victorian house to

convalesce and focus on finishing her screenplay in time

for a fast approaching deadline. Shortly after her

arrival, mysterious noises and strange happenings cause

her imagination to run wild, sending her on a twisting

and terrifying pursuit to find out what is behind the

endless mind games. Frightened but intrigued, Alice

gathers the courage to go down into the cold, dingy attic

where she finds a shoe box filled with mini-dv tapes. The

terrifying secret that lies within the tapes will unravel

Alice's dark past
