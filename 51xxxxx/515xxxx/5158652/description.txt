PLOT Minase, a high school student, finds a book of magic in an isolated room of his school and starts practicing black magic. This dark sexual magic seduces him and some of his friends by giving them extreme sexual powers which they use to charm the girls at school and make them perform all the dirty acts they can think of. Intrigued, Minase delves deeper and deeper into the craft, not realizing the evils that approaches.
Eventually, he discovers the origins of the book and of the chilling incident that took place twelve years ago on the night of the Walpurgis. He decides to stop using the book and struggles to free himself from the dark hold it has on his soul, but the book seems fated to fall into someone elses hands; someone who will use its powers to wield an even darker magic over the students.
What sort of indecent acts of extreme perversion are in store for the unsuspecting students?

Though this was the first Bible Black series it is in fact the sequel to Bible Black Origins which was later released.
