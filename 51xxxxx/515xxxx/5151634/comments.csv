garbled and not synced"
[V],bob5695,2009-12-21T19:09Z,"the problems you describe are on YOUR end.
if the problems were on the files i would have them too.
how about trying to update your audio card driver or something?"
,luckyduc9,2009-12-23T10:27Z,"No, there no problems at my end, unless, by that, you mean the download has been interfered with in some way. This isn't the only film I've burned; either before or after, but this one is the only one with a problem!"
[V],bob5695,2009-12-23T14:52Z,"so many people have downloaded the files and you're the only one complaining...
what can i say...
well, perhaps you could explain how is it that the files play just fine on my end...
perfect sync and clean audio...
i'm sorry, dude, but there's not much i can do..."
,necromasta,2009-12-27T13:35Z,hey luckyduk9 did you try watching the movie from the actual file itself to see if it was possibly a simple error in the burn.
,Maverick2504,2010-01-13T11:24Z,"Please seed! The quality is awesome when i preview, so please seed... I'll keep on seeding at max speed at least 4 two months after the download is done... So please seed... Thx in advance... ;-)"

The problem is probably the drivers from your sound / an encoder that fails or something went wrong with the burning proces.

Tyvm bob 2 great rips.

Keep up the good work!

ppl who don't appreciate it shouldn't complain"
[V],bob5695,2010-06-19T23:08Z,you're welcome.
,madcow180,2011-01-26T12:27Z,"Hi, actually there is a problem with the audio, if you are using ConvertXtoDVD to burn; unless the box ""do not fix audio discontinuities"" is ticked, the audio will be out of sync. I would not have it ticked usually for any other burns. "
[V],bob5695,2011-01-26T14:17Z,"please notice the following:

- the files, as i present them, have no audio sync issues

- i obviously cannot predict if audio sync issues will arise if someone decides to convert the files to a different format, using a given software, with given settings

- as you said, there will occur audio sync issues if you ""tell"" your software to fix audio discontinuities. my assumption is that this setting will have your software trying to fix something that doesn't need to be fixed in the first place, as proven by the fact that no audio sync issues will arise from not using that setting.

- i appreciate that you've shared your experience with the convertx software, as there might be other downloaders converting the files with that same software."
,dielaughing,2011-07-02T06:07Z,"""do not fix audio discontinuities"" .. I was beginning to wonder if I was wasting my time reading this, but I then saw ConvertXtoDVD... I too use that simple to use app to crap about 5 hours of video per DVD.. so this ""do not fix audio discontinuities"" .. never saw that box to tick before, but now that I've read this thread, I'll be sure to notice any audio anomalies when using ConvertXtoDVD and try and find the troublesome audio fixer that's not fixin a damn thing :)"
