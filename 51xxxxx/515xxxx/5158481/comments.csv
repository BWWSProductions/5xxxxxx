,jdawg7979,2009-11-13T16:03Z,"I'm currently still seeding 4 of your rips, but I was wondering if anyone knew where 
I could find a 1080p Queen Of The Damned? Or atleast 720"
[T],bricktophd,2009-11-14T00:09Z,the Da Vinci code was posted on demnoid by a  different uploader and the site is down sorry
,HeWillSeeTheBigBoard,2009-11-17T17:58Z,can you do the latest Watchmen?
,terriers,2009-12-09T22:36Z,"I downloaded this, and the resolution is no better than my 720p copy. It appears the 720p has been blown up to 1080p, with adding any more detail."

Nice share! just hope people crop movies, will save a lot of size.
Oh! and there is no subs.

Cheers!"
,naughtygirl,2010-02-15T13:27Z,What's the running time of this movie?
,naughtygirl,2010-02-16T14:46Z,"Nevermind.

I figured it out.

3800000 (3.8mbps)
 448000 (+ 448kbps)
4248000 bps

= 531000 B/s

4291792943 / 531000  = 8082 seconds = 134 minutes"
,raterillo,2010-11-12T15:44Z,"""This is meant for playback on a PS3"" so that means this have those horrible black bars and this is no real 1080!!! (I guess)"
,Zane54,2011-01-04T20:15Z,if you're using vlc then don't bother with this torrent.  it plays for crap on vlc.
