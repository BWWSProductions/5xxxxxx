These pieces are well played by P. Szabo and the recording is excellent, therefore it's a no brainer. If you enjoy 18th Century Classical Music, then these works are worth including in your collection. I find them in the same category as Boccherini's, but I would not say they are as grand as Haydn's. Anyone who enjoys the Cello should consider this set. In comparison to violin concertos and string quartets, the cello has far less solo pieces written for it, therefore one should explore these well written cello pieces. Bravo............


Enjoy and Seed!!
