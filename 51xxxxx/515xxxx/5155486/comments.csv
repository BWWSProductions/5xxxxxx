Thanks"
,robrthfx,2009-11-12T21:03Z,I'm going to try this and XP x64 SP2. I am attempting to dual boot both 64 and 32 bit version of windows on my laptop. I would say for now great uploader!
,billyboya,2009-11-13T09:38Z,"Thanks for this!
Can someone explain what these files are what I'm supposed to do with them?
I got the iso burned and started the installation with no problem. Serial # worked fine. But now the installation is asking for the CD labeled ""Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3""

What do I do next?
Thanks! I'm a complete newbie!"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-14T02:02Z,"""Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3"" is the file you burned to disc,,,, you will only be asked for that if you are turning on features that are stored on the disc,,, or you are half way through the install procedure and have removed the cd."
,Swe_Military,2009-11-14T08:48Z,"Crappy disc - get question asking for sp 3 disc - the disc are in and  I havenÂ´t changed anything.....

thethingy tried but failed....:)"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-14T17:45Z,"the iso is not crappy its straight from microsoft,, burn it at a slow speed like 4x or use thetool in this to put the files on a bootable usb;

check the iso in a vm machiene you will see it works just fine."
,APOniLORD,2009-11-16T21:52Z,"@ thethingy

is this black edition? hmm sorry for the question"
,robrthfx,2009-11-17T00:09Z,Great upload once again! Installed flawlessly and I am now dual booting 64 and 32 bit versions of xp!
[V],thethingy,2009-11-21T09:29Z,"it's not the ""black"" one it's the genuine microsoft one."
,Sopolias,2009-11-27T03:45Z,"There is no such thing as a ""black edition"". Geez, after almost 10 years of XP I thought that people learned what these stupid ""ultra-mega"" editions were.
Thanks for the upload, might as well try it."
,radianceofshadows,2009-11-27T18:53Z,"Yesterday I installed this OS and everything ran great, I updated drivers and so on.

But this morning I go to turn it on and it won't boot. It says the ""press any key to boot cd"" thing etc

I'll try repairing the installation but does anyone have any idea whats wrong? Is it probably just the CDR that I'm using?"
,radianceofshadows,2009-11-27T19:07Z,"Nvm, it ended up restarting but said that the copy is not genuine :|"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-27T19:25Z,"why do people download windows genuine advantage when they know full well they havent bought xp?

ignore the virus warning,, install it and youre troubles will be over."
,radianceofshadows,2009-11-27T19:59Z,"I entered in one of the different keys and now its running well, I guess WGA was in the updates or something.

Thanks for your help and the upload btw, I really appreciate it."
,radianceofshadows,2009-11-27T20:03Z,"Btw if I buy a copy of Windows 7 an update my PC, will it work fine?"
[V],thethingy,2009-11-27T20:08Z,"more than likley but why buy windows 7 when you can download it for free;

,k4nm4n,2010-01-16T11:32Z,Thank you for this unmodified  installation. 
,jamoecw,2010-02-22T18:29Z,the oem editor says the code in the code.txt is invalid.  figured i would change my oem version to something other than a black listed one since you included software for it.
,rcnsit,2010-07-03T15:50Z,"Does your torrent contain the activator for it ?
I mean,will I be able to use it as a 'permanent' installation as M$ would have blacklisted the keys by now ."
