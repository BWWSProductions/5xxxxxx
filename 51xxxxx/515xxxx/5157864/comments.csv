Thanks uploader thanks Air..."
,emodude5,2009-11-12T17:14Z,im seeding right now :P i wont seed after 2:00 becasue i go to sleep :)
,johan_musik,2009-11-12T17:20Z,"I hope this is a working version. If it is you are my hero emodude5! A lifesaver to the musician with less money, but a burning passion."
,Reiichi,2009-11-12T18:35Z,Thanks very much!!! I will seed as much as possibile for such a amazing software!
,emodude5,2009-11-12T21:28Z,"@johan_musik

yeah its working im making a trance song with it now , and its AWESOME"
,emodude5,2009-11-12T21:55Z,i dont know why its slow guys :( i know many of you are angry because of the connection :( i have 24mbit and its so slow why is that? do i need a new network card that supports 24mbit?
,johan_musik,2009-11-12T23:34Z,"Emodude5 of course you need a network card that supports 24 Mbit, but I actually think you have that. Nowadays network cards supports greater speed then that. And when you say that you have an internet connection that has the speed of 24 Mbit, is it also the up speed? Usually the upload speed on a 24 Mbit account is from 1-3 Mbit.  That might explain why you think you have a slow connection? 
And soon my download is ready, exited to check if it is a working release. Sorry emodude5 if doubt your word, but I have seen a lot of fake versions of this vst rompler. If it is working properly then you are a legend. I will write back some comments about the installation, if there were any problems or anything remarkable.  Do you or someone else have any of the new expansions to the nexus 2 vst? If not can you authentic version that you buy at refx store?  I will seed this if its working!"
,driverralf,2009-11-13T13:58Z,"It Works absolut PERFECT !!!!! 

Thanks very much !!!

so now it""s time for the Nexus 2 Expansions ???

,johan_musik,2009-11-14T22:17Z,I think we whait and see what happens in the expansion case. There might be people that know someone that already has these expansions and are willing to shere these. We just have to keep our eyes open.

,twh89,2009-12-24T11:46Z,"I have a big problem! I had Nexus 1 before, and I'm pretty sure I know what I'm doing. But it seems I must be doing something wrong. I followed the instructions, extracted the .rars, mounted the .iso, installed Nexus 2 to my VST folder, and copied the ""Nexus Content"" folder to the same location. I'm now trying to use it in FL Studio, but it's not finding any content and nothing appears in the ""library"". I thought maybe Nexus 1 was interfering somehow, so I completely uninstalled it, but nothing changed. I was looking at the content folder for Nexus 1, and it seems the one for 2 is quite lacking in comparison, with no license files or anything, only presets. So I don't know if I'm missing something, but I desperately need help as soon as possible! Nexus is one of the main components I use in production, so I can't really do anything now until I get it working. If you could please help me, I would VERY much appreciate it. I can be contacted directly at twhancock@ymail.com. Otherwise I will keep checking here. Thank you for your time"
,Marko90_bg-SERBIA,2009-12-25T00:55Z,"you need  total removal of nexus 1 ( leave only nxp files), repeat installation from instructions, then import expansions (It worked for me)"

how to make a nexus work :)

make this directory exist ::
C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 9\Plugins\VST\NEXUS CONTENT\SAMPLES\ROM

then do a system search for all your *.nxp *.fxp fes

copy them (or cut them if you has no space, and make sure u have enough space for twice the amount of files during copy..) into that folder

open flstudio right click on a new instrument track and choose more goto the bottom of that list and ""fast find""

the nexus 2.0 (or greater than) that u already had installed(i hope you cant be that stupid) will appeer. F it :), then close that window. set new instrument nexus and let it load.
curse the hackers u failed to put a  proper info file lol. good work anyways xD"
,gunmaker,2010-11-10T22:10Z,teezy theres no file space. that is error
,gunmaker,2010-11-11T00:29Z,"the reason i failed to install nexus was because i had overlooked the file instructions WITHIN the text, i was blindended by the ""no cracking action required"" at the bottom of the page"
,bobitipbob,2010-11-18T20:50Z,TANKS FOR THE NEXUS
,bobitipbob,2010-11-18T20:54Z,"HEY WHAT`S UP?
I CANT DOWNLOAD NEXUS BRO
CAN YOU HELP ME"
,Eastcoast_pirate,2011-01-21T06:57Z,Works perfect I don't understand how you guys are having issues.
,LittleRaabe92,2011-02-19T02:13Z,"EVERYBODY READ THIS IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE ON INSTALL!!!

Okay, so... I figured out a way better way to install this and it worked PERFECT with no problems. If you have installed this already by mounting the Image I suggest uninstalling and doing it my method, Which is listed below

Instead of mounting the .ISO to a virtual drive, Extract the .ISO and you will then see all the content of the download including the ""Nexus 2 Setup"", ""Nexus Content"" ""Installer Data"" ""Autorun"", ""Itructions"", ETC.. 

After extraction of the .ISO file, there will be instruction to install.

The instructions read the following:
Installation:

1. Install Nexus 2 Setup.exe
2. Copy ""Nexus Content"" folder to the location of your choice (normally same folder as Nexus.dll)
3. Load plugin and it will auto-scan your harddisk(s) for the content folder
(Plus Extra Notes)

This worked like a charm for me.

Also, in step in in the Instruction it says to Copy the Nexus Content into the folder which contains the ""Nexus.dll"". Now, for me, the ""Nexus.dll"" was located in Program Files/Steinberg/VstPlugins. Thank you."
,emodude5,2011-03-24T17:59Z,"OK guys listen if u cant install it or u have problems let me do it for u ok, mail me at neverlandranch@aol.com and gimme ur msn so we can chat and i can do it for u , laterz"
