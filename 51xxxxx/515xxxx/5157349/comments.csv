i was just wondering if part 2 will be up before christmas as i'd love to print off a copy for my bf. let me know as i can buy a copy from coles if you're too busy. i know what its like with uni exams (and post-exams!)  "
,htothill,2009-12-10T06:52Z,How long is it likely to be until part 2???
,hamishbindrinkin,2009-12-10T16:29Z,"you've done a fine job with part one, looks real good. suprised more haven't jumped on this considering its only released in Australia thus far"
,1qaaq12wssw2,2009-12-12T18:47Z,"when will the rest of the book be up as i finished downloading this torrent less than 2 hours ago and i am already half way through part one.
plus wouldnt it be easier for you to scan the whole book like you have done for the diagram pages rather than typing it out???"
,justinekaram,2009-12-18T05:32Z,not sure if anyones interested but coles has the book for $25
,1qaaq12wssw2,2009-12-18T22:36Z,we want to download it from here as its only released in australia atm justin uk and usa dont get it until mid january and some of us just cant wait

,IndiaTorrent,2010-04-08T03:06Z,"hi,
Thanks very much for the first part but i am dying to read the second part......
Please help me by uploading it...
It has not been released in india and it seems is not available on the net as well............
If anyone can help me with that...
And if you dont have time for typing just use the OMNIPAGE software works awesome.
It can convert scanned images to Word or other tpe of files to should only take about an hour or so for you to convert the whole book..............

Will be waiting for your release..."
