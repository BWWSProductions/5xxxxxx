Nine Inch Nails is an American industrial rock band formed in 1988 by Trent Reznor. Nine Inch Nails has released eight major studio releases, as well as numerous remix albums, singles with extensive b-sides, music videos, and tour documentaries. Nine Inch Nails has also contributed to numerous film soundtracks as well as the soundtrack to the video-game Quake.[1] The majority of Nine Inch Nails releases are labeled with "Halo numbers", a sequential numbering system that applies to most official Nine Inch Nails releases.

Initial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails in 1988 were to release one 12-inch single on a small European label.[2] With the addition of future singles "Head Like a Hole" and "Sin", many of these demo tracks would later appear in revised form on Pretty Hate Machine in 1989, co-produced by Adrian Sherwood and Mark "Flood" Ellis. In response to pressures from TVT Records for a follow-up to Nine Inch Nails' commercially successful debut, Reznor began recording the Broken extended play in secretâ€“the EP was released in 1992.[3] Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 in 1994 at #2,[4] and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in the United States.[5]

Five years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next major album, The Fragile, a double album that debuted in September 1999 at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week.[1] Another six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth, which also debuted at the top of the Billboard 200.[6] In 2007, the band released Year Zero alongside an accompanying alternate reality game.[7] Reznor announced in late 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major album independently. The last Interscope release from Nine Inch Nails was a remix album based on material from Year Zero.[8] The first Nine Inch Nails album released independently was the instrumental Ghosts Iâ€“IV in 2008, followed two months later by The Slip.


Halo numbers

Halo numbers are a system by which official Nine Inch Nails releases are chonologically ordered. They correspond to the sequence in which the releases were made, and are named by the word "Halo", which precedes the number on the release. For example, the fifth Nine Inch Nails release, Broken, is identified with the phrase "Halo Five". Halo numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of The Downward Spiral. Promotional-only releases do not have their own Halo numbers, although the promotional singles for "Piggy" and "Hurt" were both labeled as "Halo Ten," a title later officially used for Further Down the Spiral. A U.S. promo for "Into the Void" is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the Things Falling Apart remix album.
