Not Bad not great"
,The_Redneck_Juggalo,2010-03-04T05:16Z,Id say its pretty fuckin great. Its almost 3 gigs. This musta taken forever to put together.
,FearMindKiller,2010-04-26T03:21Z,too bad the bit rate is awful
,Esever,2010-05-13T23:32Z,"I apologize for the bit rate. It was the best I could do. I just figured it would be easier to get all the songs from one torrent versus looking around for bits and pieces.

So basically if you're looking for these songs with an awesome bit rate, go buy the CD's.

To everyone else that appreciates the torrent, You guys are very welcome."

,pigbenis111,2010-06-26T23:53Z,"Dude, You F*@king rock out with your c*@k out. I've been looking for all of the imported and rare stuff. HERE IT IS!!! Thanks bro!!!"
,keravnos,2010-07-03T13:32Z,Rip for Year Zero can't decide which CBR bit rate it's in :\
,keravnos,2010-07-03T13:35Z,"Scratch that, everything except The Fragile and Broken can't decide on its CBR bitrate, on With Teeth everything except Getting Smaller is either 128 or 160 kbps... Getting Smaller is 320. Do yourselves a favor, get your NIN fix from a different torrent."
,Dalemite,2010-07-04T05:29Z,"Don't listen to these posers.  Unless you have a $4000 preamp that runs on vacuum tubes, you can't tell the difference between 160Kb and 320Kb...unless you're a cat.

Keep up the good work."
,alejandro70,2010-11-11T01:46Z,GRACIAS  1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

,hettinger,2011-01-12T07:52Z,156 Seeders but only 200kbs.  Not one person can let the upload just flow?  Come'on peoples.
,stvescot,2011-06-26T06:26Z,Epic. Thank ya sir!
,fuckjews,2011-07-23T09:48Z,thanks for the upload
,IndoctriNation,2011-07-29T20:19Z,"I see all these comments about: 'awful bitrates' and the like... But does it really make a difference? I mean, when you listen to it on the pc, do you really hear the difference a song in low bitrate vs one in high bitrate? For as far as I  know, higher bitrates only tend to take up space on your drive..."
,christo7,2011-08-15T23:42Z,"I'm no audiophile by any means but the bass and percussion are usually louder and harder with higher bitrates. I only tend to notice the difference on my layman's speakers if I play a 128 and a 320 of the same song back to back, and the difference is only slight and pretty much only applies to music released in the last 15 or 20 years. "
,halvlitern,2011-09-03T20:15Z,Thanks so much
,jd777,2011-11-13T20:18Z,Thanks for a fantastic collection of music! :-) The best discography i've seen. Thanks Esever
,poot,2011-12-19T03:19Z,What is this dubstep remix trash. Way to waste my fucking time. Label this correctly.
,STFUuNoob,2012-04-18T09:14Z,Poot: That has to be the dumbest fucking comment I have ever heard. You clearly know fuck-all about Nine Inch Nails.
,UhOk,2012-04-30T01:53Z,"If you really can't tell the difference between a CD and a 160kbps mp3 file, then you have no ears. The cymbal hits sound like shit, any time the EQ is peaked there's a ton of artifacts, and the overall quality is more muffled and indistinct than a higher bitrate.

192kbps is the ""peak"" of quality, above which you can't especially tell the difference between an mp3 and a CD. But, in any case, there's no reason to ever encode below ~192kbps VBR. There are tons of free programs that can do it.

I mean, if this is all you can get, go for it. But the sound quality, even through my really old speakers, sucks. Like I said, if you really can't tell the difference, then you have to be partially deaf."
,UhOk,2012-04-30T01:55Z,"Also, who doesn't have enough hard drive space for >160kbps files anymore? What, are you playing these on a Rio Diamond mp3 player from 1999? Do you have a 2gb hard drive? Jesus, my computer isn't even that good and I have 1.75tb of hard drive space.

Seriously, good on you for the effort, but this torrent is majorly disappointing, and needlessly so."
,Treth-Husky,2012-06-23T23:43Z,"Ya know UhOk, you've made your point. If you can't appreciate the fact that it's even here it then delete it from your music library and move on with your life. No body really wants to read your never ending bullshit. "
,Treth-Husky,2012-06-23T23:43Z,"On another note, thanks for this lovely collection =)"
