,Phorat,2010-01-26T08:12Z,"Sentry, Schmentry.  Use PeerBlock if you're worried about getting ""the letter.""  I have always used PeerBlock (PeerGuardian before that), and I've never gotten ""the letter."""
,PhilLesh12,2010-01-26T08:18Z,"If you ever get ""the letter"" just ignore it.

They are phishing.  They go after the dipshits who freak out about getting a threatening letter and actually respond back.

They send out 10,000 letters.  They go after the idiots who respond."
,Phorat,2010-01-26T08:32Z,"Thanks for the insight, Phil.  I had never even thought of it that way, but it makes sense.  I have lots of friends who've gotten ""the letter"" (some, more than once) and they did nothing about it - and nothing happened.

Nonetheless, PeerBlock appears to be working, cuz I've never heard squat, even though I've DL'd torrents that were verified as ""marked."""
