,bigfishboy,2010-01-25T16:29Z,Why do you upload in such HORRIBLE QUALITY? 500 MB at LEAST for an hour long program. EVERYONE knows that. This looks horrible
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-25T17:20Z,"@bigfishboy: Sorry for saying, but STFU, please.

How can you be so obvious? Torrent is up just 18 minutes and top peers have 82.2 % of the file.

Next time, dwarf, at least wait for file to get out, then make your calls.

Get lost."
,lovernothater,2010-01-25T18:38Z,Oooh Ive been waiting for this all day. The file is worryingly small tho. We shall see 
,lovernothater,2010-01-25T18:43Z,Pretty nice. Good old MP4. Thanks...But I would ike the mkv version too
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-25T18:46Z,"@lovernothater: Obviousely, not for this one. BTW, I have Big Love sitting whole day, but, I supose, it is to hard to say a words ""Please"" and ""Thanks"". Just look tagging and encoding tme (it's written in file itself and cannot be tampered with - toolchain get UTC time from Internet based atomic-clock).

,youface,2010-01-25T19:53Z,"V:9, A:9. I say, thanks for the compact encoding. Great quality for a 200MB/hr encode - good color & contrast, very low block/edge/motion artifacts. Very watchable at 1024x768, as good as some 350MB/hr encodes I've seen.  Starts to suffer at 1680x1050.  Higher CPU usage than an equal-sized XVID, but that's not a problem.
I don't think I'll bother with a 350MB version."
,bigfishboy,2010-01-25T19:55Z,"Twentyforty, no harm intended. Yes, I hadn't seen it yet. I was refering to the horribly small file size, which in this case, obviously translates into horrible quality video. An hour program less than 200 MB in ANY format is poor quality. Why even upload in such low quality is all I wonder. I don't get it. Most everyone has HD TVs. We want the MKV and if not, at least make it watchable.

ALL THAT TO SAY: I am sorry for judging before viewing AND I am THANKFUL for your uploading.

I am just trying to express my desire for acceptable quality, and this does not meet mine personally. You and others may disagree freely. Thank you again for sharing!"
,greyspace,2010-01-25T20:08Z,Good quality for such a small file. I've been waiting for this since last night. Thanks!
,jaybee2003,2010-01-25T20:10Z,"@bigfishboy ""Why even upload in such low quality is all I wonder.""

If you would read you would understand. For ""portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch)"" at the top of the page.

Thx for u/l "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-25T20:36Z,"@@bigfishboy: It is accepted, it sounds like apology if I'm not wrong (but I doubt I get things wrong, as from your first, premature comment).
Look guys, whoever you are, I am first to know and to be concerned 'bout quality.
But, you should click on my nickname and from many torrent get informed - who this guy is, what he is doing, why - and ask yourself  ""am I on right place at all"". Rest assured, if you read even a little bit about, many of your ""questions"" will be answered.
But, I am sure in one thing: Every fool can put bit-rate at 1200 or higher and get half or more Gigabytes file, with small caveat - other people should pay for every byte in it.

One hour of TV show at decent quality can squeeze in 200 MB just one guy, who doesn't get payed, even only few people bother to say plain Thanks. I know him quite intimately.

I went TPB when ""mini went nova"". OK? There I have 300 000 downloads on slow months, 600 000 on normal... when mini-star crushed-in, I have hit OVER ONE MILLION downloads that month only.

So, do not bother to judge too loudly A/V quality. I know all about and my fans knows too.

Just whenever you want came to visit me, see if any of you can find something needed and say ""Thanks"" afterward, or simply go away."
,lilars26,2010-01-25T21:21Z,"Thanks 20/40,great show but I don't know why anyone would want 3 wives.
Boy,lots of strange people coming out of the woodwork.I think the quality is great.If other people have a problem with it they should go elsewhere.I think that some of them have another agenda.
I salute the small file...salute. "
,lydonit13,2010-01-25T22:07Z,"First, thanks twentyforty for sharing.

I do enjoy these discussions about file sizes and formats because it helps me decide how to encode my files.  I think the purpose of this upload is portability, hence the 480x272 resolution.  Those looking to watch this episode on a 40""+ TV will probably want to wait for the full standard-def or even a high-def version.

Regarding formats, a lot of manufactures are making DVD players with ""built-in MPEG4"" capability.  These players can play a XviD encoded file without any re-encoding.  S04E01 and S04E02 were available in XviD.  I think that's another reason some people were hoping for this episode as XviD."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-25T22:26Z,"@lydonit13: Thanks for thanks. Can you imagine that I have considered all ypo've said like zillion times.
About formats, you either got things wrog or you twist the facts.
Just look what I wrote about several times (but haven't bothered to find exactly where, since I am sure that beginners and laymans should do before get involved in discussions over their heads):
JUST A PART OF TEXT:

PROS & CONTRAS:

1. Quality

720p Matroska (.mkv) has 7 times bigger picture (frame-size), BUT 10 times higher bitrate (3680 compared to 368) and 2 or 5.1 ch. audio.
File of 720p is 8.38 times bigger. XviD is roughly 2.8 larger than my H264. In turn my H264 encodings are bigger than some XviD encodings, especially ones from Polish ""tvyoyo"" which existed and tagged their encodings as ""XviD asd"". XviD asd was (is) totally inconsistent as method, and their encodings vary from ""phantastic"" to ""unbearably low quality"", what is big problem in collections of TV shows people tend to keep.

Judging from that one might say that small-sized H264 sucks, but in trying to relate such data anyone would stumble on objective/subjective valuation principle and probably get wrong conclusion. Subjectively many things could be better or worse for some, but not for others - we always judge things from ""our perspective"". Such small frame size has disadvantages by nature: In crowded scenes, for example, man's face could occupy/get only 8 square pixels what is same amount for ""characters"" or ""sprites"" in old computer games. However, it wasn't that bad, right? 

Mathematicaly speaking, regarding all these factors, small-sized H264 is de facto 37% lower than 720p in quality, picture-wise. I am very proud of audio quality, where uniqe and proper downmix bring advantages over 128 kbps MP3 tracks in XviD.

2. Compliance

Sub-format restrictions (literary - 'cause ALL advanced and nice features of libx264 (H264 codec) must be disabled)) brings wide compliance with myriad of devices; from computers to iPods and clones, PS3 or Xbox - devices which almost all households have.

Matroska (720p .mkv) is playable only on some (fast) computers which graphic card/abilities may provide non-shaky playback and connection to TV via HDMI.
Number of standalone devices which accept unaltered .mkv is - negligent.

3. Costs

By nature and by design small-sized H264 generally targets totally different crowd/audience, majority (still over 72%) of people with slow Internet connections, bandwidth restrictions or - traffic limitations.

Download of one 1120 MB large 720p costs around 2.2 $.
Download of one 133 MB ""big"" file I encode costs 24 cents - or nothing.
For example, most people (as I had in past) have free traffic limit (mine was 10 GB). In such limit one can ""sqeeze-in"" 76 (SEVENTYSIX) episodes of beloved shows every month, but ONLY nine matroskas. XviD is better, but 28 shows per month is not everyone's cup of tea. Especially if one CAN follow almost all episodes - instead to pick up few which may be good - or not.

So, in point 1. (Quality) 720p and XviD are clear winners. It should be, it must be.
However, everything is a matter of balance. Single factors are only a sign of short-sightedness.

In point 2. (Compliance) small-sized H264 is a clear winner. Even the number of XviD capable stand-alones could not be compared to growing number of PS3/Xbox/iPod devices and their clones. Not to mention computers, because any computer is technically capable for both formats (XviD and H264). Not so for Matroskas.

Point 3. or ""Costs"" is so much in favor of small-sized H264, and only objections will come from people with high-income, fast connections and Flat-rate, where traffic isn't the issue. Target audience are pople who need to save on Intrnat traffic or have slow connections which almost surely causes slow upload speeds/abilities from their side. It brings, lets say, some ""disadvantages"". Downloads are slower than they should be, for many reasons. ...

See?"
,mirooev,2010-01-25T22:38Z,"twentyforty, this is my first time downloading one of your files and I wanted to say thanks. I don't know anything about the techo stuff but I know it played very well on my laptop with VLC and the small file size is great. I'll definitely be downloading more from you. Thanks!"
,courage1,2010-01-25T22:54Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5307872

There's a ""normal"" XviD release up now"
,lilars26,2010-01-25T23:11Z,"Yes normal 495 MiBs and put out by everybody's faouirite trusted uploader 
""Anonymous""and you always know what you are getting from them.Right?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-26T03:44Z,"@lilars: Know what, my friend... XviD can be done as [micro] ten times till now - as I did with Dexter and True Blood and Weeds. And it would be better looking XviD of 275MB than  they think is possible. XviD guys always came after offering their apologies. 

But, as you can see, no one asked and on 2376 downloads I get fistful of thanks, tons of shit and 435 seeders. Now, compare that tomorrow with ANY other show from at least dozen uploaders. You'll be devastated, as I am from day of my arrival. 

Did anyone have ever asked himself ""Why this guy do this in first place?"". .. More likely ""Maybe we pay him too much."" Or ""We have demands."", ""We have rights."" and ""It looks so easy, I can do it too"". Well, some things never change...."
,bigfishboy,2010-01-26T05:43Z,"twentyforty: Thank you for explaining again. Also I did not see the line in the description about for 'portable and mobile devices'. For that, I apologize.

Simply put, this is not the quality I need but it is perfect for what it is stated to be for. On my 42' full HD connected to a Popcorn Hour, this looks like a I'm watching pixels more than video. Anywho, I am sorry for the confusion. Consider me a retard and forgive me :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-26T07:33Z,"@bigfishboy: But you continue to speak rubbish. Now many of us and me are sure that you need to either get your eyes checked or pay a visit to some shrink.

Man, get a grip, Popcorn and Plasma ARE EXACTLY my home setup and many of my fans...
Stop speaking nonsense, you have nothing more to say.
Go home, wherever it is... and consider my acceptance of your fogy apologies revoked."

Firstly, just FUCK OFF! Seriously!

20-40 does what he does for many reasons and is an EXPERT!!!!!

I have looked at your comments and you bitch and then apologise and then explain why you are bitching and all to try and save yourself (BTW, way too late) from sounding like a complete dickhead.

20-40 has explained numerous times to other idiots like you (& I include certain moderators on this site - you know who you are) what he does and why. He explains nearly everything in in every file. Can you read? Or is that just too hard and you JUST know better anyway?

So you prefer bigger file size as that is the ONLY way you can get quality. I watch the encodes from my PS3 (no conversion on my end required) via HDMI on my 32"" LCD. Quality is perfect.

Finally, and with all sincerity - FUCK OFF and never come back!

Jon


@20-40
As an individual who is a fan of the only encoder (20-40) that I have come across who understands that not everyone has lots of cash and bandwidth and download allowances to burn,
 I wish to apologise completely and unreservedly to you on behalf of bigfish-smallbrain-boy. I'm SORRY!

He is obviously an idiot & a whiny bitch and I'm sorry that you you felt you had to expalin yourself to him. He wasn't worth the time/effort.

A huge fan

,lilars26,2010-01-27T19:22Z,@bigfishboy  you are an idiot and a liar.I just watched this on my big screen Sony and it played great.If you are seeing pixels then you should check the warranty on your t. v. You definitely have a problem.
,bigfishboy,2010-01-27T23:09Z,"I am so glad you all have no idea what you are talking about.

Someone who says this looks good on a 'big screen sony' needs their eyes checked.

And Jon4fun, who the f*ck do you think you are? It doesn't matter. You are an idiot. This uploader did his thing and it isn't what I was looking for. Then your retarded ass had to say a lot of stupid sh*t and then SUCK twentyforty's DICK afterwards. Nice, but you got jiz all over your chin. Just cause I said what I thought, you jumped on me almost as fast as you get your mouth around twentyforty's stick. Have fun with that, ass."
