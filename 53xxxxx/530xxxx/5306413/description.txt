Dr. Banjo (aka "Pete Wernick") has a great website for all things banjo.
He has a list of the 100 songs every banjo (and bluegrass) player should know. 
Check out his website here: http://drbanjo.com/

I compiled an album of all the songs he lists done by various artists. For most of the songs, there are at least two versions. 

Enjoy
