Summary:

 Freestyle BMX: Featuring Brian Foster & Joey Garcia is an extreme freestyle
 BMX simulation using officially licensed Schwinn and GT bicycles. Competitions
 involve performing tricks (aerial jumps, bar spins, back flips) throughout
 various levels -- the idea is to rake in a sponsorship and enhance your bike.
 After a trick has been executed, a letter appears at the bottom of the screen;
 once you spell out the complete word, you move on to the next level.

 Featuring 3D visuals and accelerator support, there are 12 levels in all, each
 with its own unique textures and environments. There are outdoor courses in
 which you'll leap white-picket fences, basketball courts and indoor
 half-pipes. After completing a level, you can use your winnings and go to the
 local bike shop. Here, you choose from a variety of tricked-out bikes, each
 with its own weight and performance specifications.

 Released as part of Activision's Value Software line, Freestyle BMX: Featuring
 Brian Foster & Joey Garcia also features time limits and scoring for
 individual tricks. In order to make use of the 3D acceleration, you need a
 video card that supports Direct 3D.
