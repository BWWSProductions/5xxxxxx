Both are same.
Don't watch linked first, my bad.

Apologies."
,agent1su,2010-01-24T20:56Z,hey deltapan is s01e00 and s01e01 the same for caprica
,agent1su,2010-01-24T20:57Z,the time is now for all battlestar galactica fans so say we all keep em coming
,mac_intel,2010-01-25T08:50Z,"The EP numbering for season 1 is going to be all screwed up.

S01E01 is the same as S01E00 that was out last year.  Only a few scenes with titties were cut for tv broadcast. So if you have E00, you don't need this one.

Some sites are already calling the pilot E01/02 because it is two hours long, which could make the first new episode of 2010 E03-Rebirth.  The lame E01/02 shit has already been done before with Warehouse 13. Hopefully it won't happen here.

Anyway, because of SciFi re-airing the pilot from last April and calling it E01, we now have thousands of people downloading the same shit they leeched and watched last year."

Thanks EZTV! You rock!"
