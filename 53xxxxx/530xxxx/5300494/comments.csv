Van Diemen's Land (the movie) is an independent film made by film makers, who received absolutely no financial support from commercial or government sources at all, and made this film using there own funds. I'm aware that the film makers haven't broke even yet, and therefore no-one except the distributor has been paid as of yet.

It might be ok to download films and music of large, powerful studios that can soak up the loss of revenue from piracy. This however is not one of those films. Van Diemen's Land is made by a group of passionate film makers, who have made a difficult film the best they can with limited resources. I think its time they got paid.

Please, if you value independent films and if you like this film please buy an official copy of the DVD. You can order it online here...

And you CAN purchase this dvd from anywhere in the world via the magic of the postal service. And as for the region problem... I can play DVD's from any region with a little digital hocus pocus, therefore so can anyone.

And you're right all promotion is mostly good but it just doesn't always pay the bills. And yes, actors should get normal jobs, there's no doubt"
