If you're weak minded

If you like having imaginary friends

If you believe in a 2000 year old myth that has been recycled at least a dozen times before the ""christ"" myth was created

If you want to teach your children intolerance and hatred toward people that are different from you

Watch the original Zeitgeist first

,Bwalker,2010-01-26T10:16Z,Yip. You sound like the epitome of tolerance.
,internationalbrigade,2010-01-26T15:38Z,"Yes tolerance is important. 
Tolerance for pedophiles. 
Tolerance for Heroin dealing Muslims. 
Tolerance for the willing victims of belief in myths which predicate the ignorant and vulnerable into the service of the amoral manipulative self-serving controlling elite. 
Tolerance for those who seek to subvert the minds of children into a murderous creed built on a condemn and convert approach that relies on submission to an imaginary friend whose capacity for depravity knows no limits.
Tolerance is good. But should we tolerate those who target children with such cynicism?"

Visual Bible Stories for Kids SHOULD be the correct title, and if they can't get THAT right...well fuck me...and by the way, I'm not 9yo, so don't try."
,KOBKED-X,2010-01-28T06:15Z,"Interesting torrent, If you want to brain wash just use Shock Therapy  , around 2000v should do it..or better yet, just let your kids watch TV. TV is Great, all the christian morals, all the GOD ON OUR SIDE killing sprees in the middle east..

Oh ya don't forget to teach em t oturn thier cheeks, so the priest doesn't have to adjust his Angle when Fucking them in the ass...Ya, the Bible..So well thought of..by child molesters...on second thought, I'll pass this one like a turd..and flush..."
,metaliica,2010-02-13T13:19Z,"FUCK YOU religous nut case!!! brainwash your children to believe in some shit that came from when we humans where dumb fuck ups who didnt even know why the grass growed, from when we needed an explination on why the sun came up!!! stupid son of a bitch fuck whore!!! just die religous fuck up!!!"
,Tamarind777,2010-04-10T08:32Z,"Hmmm...let's see, you call the Bible story brainwashing when you do the same and worse with your religion (evolution). Just look at what you believe:

1. From first grade you teach them that, ""Billions or years ago..."" That's not brainwashing? They don't even know what a billion is! I have proof of this. I subbed for a first grade class and this is the junk they want me to teach a bunch of third graders. It was actually on their work sheet.

2. Life came from rocks. Where in the world, or on that planet you're from, do you ever observe this happening? Life only comes from life. Check it out. That's science. Ever heard of the cell theory? Try reading some real science sometime.

3. That over time a frog can turn into a prince. Last time I checked, this was still a fairytale. According to you, it's science. Yes, you actually believe this and don't even know it. The science books teach that the ""kiss"" of time will turn a frog into a ""man."" Yes, that if you give a frog enough time, it could give rise to something else, which could be a man (prince).

4. That a carrot and the blue whale share a common ancestor. That is science? That is voodoo science at best. Might as well wave a dead chicken over a sick person and hope he gets well while you're at it. Yes, the science books say that every single life came from one macromolecule. This would mean that every living thing would be related if you go back far enough. This is not science but your religion. It takes faith to believe this garbage, because you don?t have any way of testing or observing any of this. Try looking up the definition of science. It means ?knowledge which is derived through observation, testing?? How do you do this with your religion? Can you observe any of it? If you can?t, then it?s faith.

5. That a fairytale is true. Yup. How does your Biology and general science books begin? ""Billions and billions of years ago..."" In other words, ""Once upon a time..."" That's what it means. Again, that sounds like a fairytale to me.

I could go on all night with the lies and garbage atheists and evolutionists believe. You're hypocrites and liars and there is a God who will soon judge you, and guess what? He does NOT ask for your permission to do it either. In fact, you don't even need to believe in Him for Him to judge you, so go on with your foolishness. The Bible says, ""The fool has said in his heart that there is no God.""

Don?t accuse Christians of brainwashing kids. We teach kids they?re made in the image of a loving Creator and that they have a purpose in life, that their actions and words are accountable, so they should be careful what they do and say. You teach your kids that they are nothing more than glorified monkeys with no purpose in life, that they can do anything they want, as long as it?s legal. Yes, kids, do as you like, because one day you?ll die without any hope at all. In fact, the only hope you have is to become worm food and fertilizer. Yes, one day a flower will grow and bloom as a result of your dead body. That is your hope. The Christian hope is a promise from God Himself, that one day soon His Son Jesus will return to take His children home and destroy this earth, eventually recreating it like it was in the beginning in Eden, where they will live forever without any sickness, sin, or death and destruction, not even so much as a splinter. I?d rather hold onto that hope any day than what you offer."

God bless!"
,NagaPower,2011-01-04T04:23Z,Thank you @Tamarind 777 for ur comment
,i6789,2011-04-12T08:17Z,Jesus is alive. I was hindu but jesus changed my life. He always helped me when I was in great troubles. He is my friend and my dad. The ones who tell that it is brainwash is totally wrong you people are brainwashed by your ancestors who pray to idols and think it is GOD. Known the truth and try to find true GOD. Who ever tries to find GOD can always find GOD. The Second coming of jesus christ is very near repent and confess your sins . PRAISE THE LORD
