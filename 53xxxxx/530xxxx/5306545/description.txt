           The African-American son of a Compton minister and the         
           Caucasian daughter of the mayor of Los Angeles enter into      
           a forbidden interracial romance in this contemporary           
           hip-hop-infused retelling of William Shakespeare's Romeo       
           and Juliet. Reverend Q may be a man of the cloth, but          
           when his son Rome (Nate Parker) begins dating rebellious       
           blonde beauty Jewel (Lindsey Haun), father and son are         
           driven apart by bigotry and hatred. Does Jewel truly love      
           Rome, or is her devilish grin actually an indicator that       
           the spontaneous 16-year-old is just playing games by           
           dabbling in the forbidden? Later, when Rome and Jewel          
           abscond to Los Angeles to elope, spliff-smoking DJ/drug        
           dealer Mercury sells his soul in order to return from the      
           grave and track the two lovers down. Will Rome and Jewel       
           actually exchange vows, and why has Mercury entered into       
           such a dire pact in order to destroy their romance? As         
           the journey gets under way, passions flair and old             
           grudges threaten to drive these star-crossed lovers            
           toward a bitter and tragic end.
