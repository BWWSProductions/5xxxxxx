Heartland S03E13: Quarantine

In this episode, an unwelcome visitor called Strangles visits the ranch. Strangles is a highly contagious and serious infection that affects horses, and when Pegasus comes down with it Tim has to face lingering emotions from his past. And Ty and Amy's relationship become strained as they tirelessly work to combat the disease.

This also couldn't come at a worse time for clients Victoria and Linda, respectively the owner and trainer of a dressage horse that Amy is working with.

Lou meanwhile is at her wit's end, trying to contain the damage that Strangles may have on the dude ranch.

And Mallory wants to get to Calgary to see Badger's art exhibit but with the disease spreading she finds it hard to slip away.

This episode features guest stars Joanna Douglas (Samantha on "Being Erica") as Victoria and Debra Lynne McCabe (Yvonne Castle on "The Border") as Linda.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Jan 24, 2010. According to the CBC website, the next episode will air on Jan 31, 2010.
