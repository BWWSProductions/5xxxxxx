...CD Rip Created By - Dbpoweramp (Did you miss that in the Descript page) Tell me what do you use.. no point telling me not to use EAC unless your going to tell the Full story

well if your talking about previous uploads i find EAC very usefull and easy and can play with command lines... there is 3 programs i use.. EAC, Dbpoweramp and Mediacoder.. and guess what i ain't changing a thing.. and if you have noticed lately with the last fair few torrents i've been use'n DBPOWERAMP  

and if your talking about this torrent i suggest you read the description page next time..

Anyway buddy... EAC is very good it also depends on what settings and what CD Drive you use too.....  "

,TripleAAABattery,2010-01-26T13:24Z,eac and dbpoweramp can create 320kb cbr too -_-
[V],bubanee,2010-01-26T14:47Z,"@ Jainmehul... fair enough you use 320cbr... constant.. you create it with a ripper.. good for you! but what is your point really... are you just another person coming along to tell me that i should use 320cbr 'stereo' 
as far as i'm aware i don't have any problems with the way i rip music.. you see i'm happy with the way i do things.. just like you are.. since your going on about perfect rips.. well i thought i'd look into some of your 354kbps rips turns out you used one of my torrents that i made with EAC using this --vbr-new... you took the whole folder and Trans_coded a VBR into your Audio not MP3... but thats fine of course in your eyes. i see that you did correct yourself and settled on 320CBR in the end... firstly here's a tip... hydrogenaudio forum go have a read.. i'm over the arguments actually i had enough of them on mininova... you wanna be the best that you can be.. for yourself find a happy medium... matey i'm here to help these days and basically where as a few months ago i would of told you to fuckoff... oh and another thing superfast and accurate don't go together.. anyway i'm off to grab one of your 320cbr songs and check the shit out of it....

[V],bubanee,2010-01-27T07:21Z,sorry buddy i honestly thought you were being a smart arse... 
[V],bubanee,2010-01-27T10:06Z,no no no.... don't think like that please.. we are all uploaders.. we all do our own things.. and since your just starting your only going to improve in time.. you will get familar comments from the same people.. and you will come across dickheads too screaming this and that... but as long as your happy with the way your doing things... 'sweet' my advice to you is look around at some of the 'high end' uploaders and if you see things as in the way they do it.. and you like it.. learn from it and apply it to yourself little bit here a little bit there... myself even.. i hated seeing CDRips with no Covers and besides a handfull of people doing it i came across a former uploader named 'skirgsk' and i thought sweet i'll do that too... we all follow each other in way or another.... any probs give me a yell... or even at forum 
[V],bubanee,2010-01-27T12:16Z,"your welcome buddy, Cheers!"
