,Superman169,2010-02-28T08:05Z,"You have to turn the 6 channel audio into 2 channel audio for it to play on xbox 360, i dont know about the ps3 at least this works for me on my 360, i use MediaCoder Audio Edition, its free i suggest downloading a secretmyth movie with the instructions in it, its really easy to use, sorry Mr Kringle for mentioning another uploader on your page you are still top knotch and awesome keep em coming and i""ll keep downloading them thank you very much.

Is there any chance you may be able to up some brrips of any comic book movies would be sweet thank you again"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-03-08T23:01Z,As far ass comic book brrips go almost all of the known ones have been made by other encoders and the rest are not worth it because they are terrible.
,blue3lf,2010-03-23T17:18Z,"i have a problem and i haven't been able to find a solution.

after downloading and playing the movie i immediately noticed the scenes are all over the place. as soon as i play the movie it's some random scene and the audio doesn't match, the movie is broken up and the credits are rolling at several different places throughout the movie.

i used utorrent to download it. i tried force check on the torrent and it completed successfuly. seriously wtf.. i've never had this happen before.. i also downloaded another movie and that was fine.

anyone have any idea what's wrong because i can't find anything on google"
,blue3lf,2010-03-23T17:37Z,nevermind i finally found the problem.. if you use media player classic you have to check the mp4/mov checkbox in Options > Internal Filters and that will make the movie play correctly
,JoeScar2008,2010-05-13T04:49Z,Thx...Man
,sbflow,2010-05-13T14:31Z,"i have the same problem. when i watch the movie , the scenes are in random order. the beggining of the film is in the middle!  any suggestions?
 i have vlc player and km player, and media player of course. none of them fixed the problem."
[T],HaUnTiNg.SuMMeR,2010-06-10T15:18Z,thnx... lookin for since a long time.
,chris[mufc]150,2010-06-30T16:40Z,"What I waste. I tried KMPlayer, VLC and media player classic and nothing helped. This file is messed up :S"
,chris[mufc]150,2010-07-01T18:40Z,Actually never mind my previous comment. This version of the movie ( the extended cut ) is supposed to be like this. More like four episodes than like a whole movie. I apologise to the uploader for my previous comment. Peace!
,cheo2010,2010-07-27T18:54Z,"Thanks, great work."
,bragazar1710,2011-07-13T11:35Z,thanks.

,LucyWoof,2012-02-18T12:59Z,"Missing beginning of movie, otherwise OK."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-04-21T14:14Z,"@LucyWoof:

The uncut extended version has something more than the theatrical version. The scene from the beginning of the ttheatrical version is included in this extended one but it's ....not the beginning scene !!!"
