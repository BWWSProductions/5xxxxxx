,TPBRools,2010-01-24T00:25Z,lol @ RIggsta. Why bother? Why waste resources on such a lost cause?
,darkmemc,2010-01-24T08:16Z,"what you mean hope for America? If you´re talking about north america, I dont think tehy nedd any help, but, South America really needs...
and I dont think it´s a lost ´cause... the are human beings like we, hope such a disgrace like that never happens again, and dot happens with us too, ´cause I dont wanna hear some kind of person saying something like that... "
,darkmemc,2010-01-24T08:17Z,"nd I mean, north america doesnt need any help ´cause it´s the richest country, they dont need external help and this kind of thing doesnt happens there"
,LOLTOAST,2010-01-26T15:02Z,"@darksomething: Dude, ""such a disgrace"" is going to happen again; it was a fucking earthquake. Mother nature and all that, yeah? It's whether or not your country is prepared for one, clearly Haiti was not. This whole idea is nice and all, but the UK has already sent millions, and we get reports saying fuck all is happening. "
,co30op,2010-01-30T02:07Z,"If I have to see another red cross give $10 to Haiti commercial or hear football commentators interrupting the game talking about how this player or that player is doing it for Haiti I might shoot myself.  

If they want to raise a certain amount of money for Haiti or help pay the $651,957 salary of the CEO/Director of the Red Cross the should say once we get X amount of $'s we will stop the commercials and you'll never hear about it again.  I guarantee you that money would be raised in under an hour. "
