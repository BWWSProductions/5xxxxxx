3.If you haven't play japan games download east asian language pack (i think there's  such on piratebay) and go to langauges option in control panel then you click advanced(most right). You will have to select japan for non-unicode langauge programs (or you might get blue screen). From there choose the folder of the lg pack (sorry for the change of description).Other alternative of this is applocale.

I hope you enjoy and seed!!!
Also if you like the game buy it (if you have money and not from pirate site).
