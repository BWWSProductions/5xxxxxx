,Bacara,2010-06-12T06:14Z,"pleasee seed!
i've tried getting this from a million other sites and have gotten like 97% of the way on one, but please i need the whole thing! such a classic game and ost!"
,NAME3456,2010-10-24T07:53Z,"Okay seriously, someone seed.  Me and a few other people have been waiting for days at 79.1%. The only other flac of this I can find is a pay-to-download site, and I'd sooner fornicate myself with a rusty pipe.

Also, I registered just to post this, and was about to smash the keyboard with my head if my user name was rejected one more time."
,NAME3456,2011-01-16T07:46Z,"And STILL waiting.  Admittedly I haven't been running it nonstop but every time I check everyone's still stuck at the same spot.  79.1

And there's always -at least- 3 other people trying to download, sometimes as many as 12.

If you have the whole thing, fucking seed for god's sake.  This torrent isn't dead and forgotten despite not having seeds for an indefinite amount of time."

People hosting either nsf rendered mp3 files or recordings straight from the game. This looks to be the official Japanese OST in .flac format, which would be wonderful."
