,Spurge42,2010-06-12T12:10Z,"They're your standard mp3.  There are other files, notice the small size, these don't play. This is how I received them, don't know what they are. Must be for something specific."

The file you are attempting to play has an extemnsion that does not match the file format. Playing the file may result in unexpected behavior. Do you want the Player to try to play the file?

Media player classic faults to a possible missing codec.

Spurge42, what do you use to play these files? Have you even heard them?"
,Spurge42,2012-01-03T10:39Z,"The mp3's play, there are files that are very small in size, bytes, they don't play. I don't know why they are there, sorry, I just copied everything that was given to me. All files are there though, you'll notice, the small ones are duplicates of the working ones. I thinks it's a Macintosh thing that did this."
