It's a Featurette if you'd bother to look at it.


Avatar.Featurette.Creating.the.World.of.Pandora.1080P.H264.AAC2.0.mov
Format                           : MPEG-4
Format profile                   : QuickTime
Codec ID                         : qt  
File size                        : 1.54 GiB
Duration                         : 22mn 55s

Notice the DURATION? 22:55 as compared to 1.54 GB. That certainly sounds like HD content to me."

,Abezethibou,2010-04-16T23:31Z,"Interesting ""making of documentary"" - tho' could have been bit more in detail and longer. Quality superb."
,Cycsplague,2010-11-05T01:33Z,You know... somehow I see a movie that is over 2 and a half hours long and in 1080p to be more than 1.54G. At least quit lying about your torrents to inflate your image on TPB. Get user-approval through continually releasing true good content.
