,nautiluss,2010-07-04T21:38Z,Can they be used on websites or are they copyrighted?
,snapped,2010-07-07T05:56Z,"Well yes these would be copyrighted or like sold as a royalty free license. So to be able to use them legitimately one would have to purchase the license. Please can the uploader please specify where the images come from. For example the folders that just say Hirespictures do not say where they are from. Please tell us, so if we need to get the license we can.  "
