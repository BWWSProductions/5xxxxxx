,GoldStandard,2010-01-31T03:31Z,"True. All US presidents for instance, including Obama, are or have been related to the Queen of England.
You might say that if you start including cousins x steps removed etc then we all are, but I did a fair bit of search on my own family (Scandinavia) and although there have been some successful characters, we are nowhere near monarchs.  Maybe I'm the exception? Or maybe only family members are allowed to rise to high positions. 
What really pissess me off is that the TRUE King of England lives in outback Australia whilst these bastard offsprings from a cheating queen is allowed to reign.
