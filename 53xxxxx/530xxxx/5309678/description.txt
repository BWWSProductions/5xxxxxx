More Than Alot is the debut album by Chase & Status. It debuted in the UK album charts at number 49 on 19 October 2008 and entered the UK dance album chart at number 2. It was preceded the week before by the release of the single "Pieces" featuring vocals by Plan B. On 5 October 2008, this made number 70 on the national singles chart and number one on the UK Dance Chart. The album also includes a collaboration with UK garage rapper Kano on "Against All Odds" and the hit "Take Me Away", which received considerable play time in the UK club scene throughout 2008. While the album maintains the duo's drum & bass roots, two tracks ("Eastern Jam" and "Running") display Chase & Status' ability to produce dubstep tracks with commercial success. "Eastern Jam" has since been remixed with collaboration from hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg, culminating in the 2009 single "Snoop Dogg Millionaire".
