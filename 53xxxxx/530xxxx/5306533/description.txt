One of Bennett's several novels set in The Potteries. This
one was published in 1910. It charts the rise of Denry Machin
(The Card), who, through luck, guile and cheek escapes his
poor background to become Mayor of Bursley.

Bursley was based on Burslem, now part of the Stoke on
Trent Connurbation. 

I hope that the BBC is planning to do more of Bennett's
Five Towns' novels. They are good hearted and good fun.
