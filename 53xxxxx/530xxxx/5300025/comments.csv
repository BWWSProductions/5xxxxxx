,BasilBrush,2010-01-22T21:14Z,"The title says ""1.3Km Sprint Freestyle""."
,BasilBrush,2010-01-22T21:18Z,"I think your right, I got the title from Digiguide - they're often wrong. I should have watched the programme more closely."
,BasilBrush,2010-01-22T21:21Z,"I've removed the word ""Team"" from the title but it'll appear in the torrent folder name."
,skifan,2010-01-23T04:10Z,"Any chance that you could do torrents of the upcoming FIS Marathon Cup races - the Dolomitenlauf on 1/24, the Marcialonga on 1/31, the Tartu Maraton on 2/12, the Vasaloppet on 3/7? FIS says that these races are airing on many national channels in Europe...

Thanks for everything you do!"
,Spartanus,2010-01-23T06:38Z,"It's no problem, I just renamed the file - I just wanted the torrent here on PirateBay to be named correctly.

Thanks A LOT for your releases!"
