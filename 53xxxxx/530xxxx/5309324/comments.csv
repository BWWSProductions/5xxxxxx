[V],bubanee,2010-01-28T06:56Z,320 songs in the check list folder i got... so far... i can't find any doubles except the .txt in the folders. feel free to let people know if there is any doubles... shouldn be though.. and it has come to my attention by a friend that some are from 1979.. but i guess we can call these extra's... :)
