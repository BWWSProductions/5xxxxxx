Ratatat Remixes Vol. 1 is a self-released remix album by the Brooklyn indie electronic rock duo Ratatat. It includes performances from hip-hop artists Missy Elliott, Kanye West, Raekwon and Ghostface. In an interview with Glide Magazine, Ratatat member Mike Stroud acknowledged both the marked departure from their instrumental first album Ratatat and perceived dichotomous nature of their sound by saying â€œEspecially with remixes, we approach it a bit differently than our other music. Itâ€™s something we originally did for fun, thatâ€™s now part of what we are.â€
