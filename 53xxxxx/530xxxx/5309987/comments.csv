,PainSled,2010-01-26T21:38Z,"Season 6, Episode 11: Remorse
Season 6, Episode 12: Moving the Chains
- IMDB

im not saying it's fake(I haven't downloaded it yet(1 to 279 atm))
but the name is not correct."
,brokenbakfiets,2010-01-26T22:57Z,Looked up a transcript and compared it to the italian subs provided with this torrent. This torrent definately DOES NOT CONTAIN EPISODE 12. It has been misnamed as painsled suggested. This is Episode 11 with seperate italian subs.

no, the name is not incorrect, some state that the two hour episode ""broken"" was in fact two episodes (#1 & #2), so remorse can be either #11 or 12"
,PainSled,2010-01-27T05:32Z,"I have now seen it, and it is Season 6, Episode 11: Remorse..."
