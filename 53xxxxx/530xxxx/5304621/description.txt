Hi Everyone


The Quran, the last revealed word of God, is the primary source
of every Muslimâ€™s faith and practice. It deals with all the
subjects which concern human beings: wisdom, doctrine,
worship , transactions, law, etc., but its basic theme is the
relationship between God and His creatures. At the same time,
it provides guidelines and detailed teachings for a just society,
proper human conduct, and an equitable economic system.

Note that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad in Arabic only.
So, any Quranic translation, either in English or any other
language, is neither a Quran, nor a version of the Quran,
but rather it is only a translation of the meaning of the Quran.
The Quran exists only in the Arabic in which it was revealed.

These are the translations of the meaning of the Quran
