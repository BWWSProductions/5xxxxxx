plot:
How did a controversial, ultra-radical organization become the largest animal
rights group in the world? For the past 25 years, Ingrid Newkirk and People 
For the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have tirelessly attacked one of the
pillars of civilization: mankind's use of animals. Ingrid and her supporters
are driven by the single-minded conviction that humans must not use animals for
any reason - not for food, clothing, medical experimentation, or even for 
entertainment. Ingrid works 18-hour days and lives in a one-bedroom apartment
with little furniture. She publicly hopes that mad cow disease will ravage the 
country; she believes a cure for AIDS is not worth the life of a single monkey; 
and when Ingrid dies, she wants her body dissected, eaten, and made into 
clothing - as a statement of solidarity with non-human animals. Having obtained 
unprecedented access to Ingrid and the activities of her organization, 
I Am An Animal thoroughly explores PETA's unconventional ideology and its militant
and extreme tactics. To understand PETA's staying power and how it became the most
successful radical group in America, the film follows several present day actions
in addition to examining past controversies. At its core, however, I Am An Animal
is an intimate, provocative profile of one woman's private war on behalf of animals.
