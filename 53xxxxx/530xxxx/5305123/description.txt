SutartinÄ—s Party
It is one of the most vibrant projects by the composers Linas RimÅ¡a and Linas Paulauskis which combines sutartinÄ—s (ancient polyphonic songs) with electronic music and some jazz elements. Composers notable for their daring crossover experiments are always keen to transgress the standards of different genres; they look for unexpected blends and transformations of folk music, popular opera repertoire, the work by contemporary composers, etc. SutartinÄ—s Party reveals unique modes and entrancing rhythm of polyphonic folk music through interaction with different sub-genres of electronic dance music: house, trance, bigbeat, triphop, dub, etc. Ingenious music alchemists perfectly combine ancient ritual music with scamp amusement; the production also incorporates traditional dance, elements of performance art and visuals. This lively, intoxicating synthesis of genres has become one of the most wanted products of the Lithuanian music export.

SutartinÄ—s (glees) is a unique form of Lithuanian folk music â€“ ancient multivoiced songs and instrumental tunes, which polytonal counterpoints, unusual sound of parallel seconds, syncopated rhythms, ritual dancing, and trance-inducing atmosphere through endless repetitions. And thus, would it go well with different varieties of electronic dance music? Testing out this compatibility was a request of the Berlin new music festival MaerzMusik and initial idea of the SutartinÄ—s Party project formed for this occasion. (By the way, the very word â€œsutartinÄ—sâ€ comes from â€œsutartiâ€ â€“ to mach, to agree, to be in harmony.)
Traditionally the vocal sutartinÄ—s are performed only by women. The variable line-up of SutartinÄ—s Party always includes a group of sutartinÄ—s singers, who sing in an authentic manner and perform traditional dance movements. The debut performance at MaerzMuzik in 2003 featured singers` group Trys Keturiose led by Daiva VyÄinieniÄ—, who is the most competent specialist in sutartinÄ—s singing. For the following tours and until now, this tradition has been represented by singers` group SaugÄ—, the leader of which, Loreta SungailienÄ—, is Lithuania`s favorite folk singer and hostess of populas TV shows. They also recorded for this debut album of SutartinÄ—s Party, which comprises tracks composed in 2003-2007.
