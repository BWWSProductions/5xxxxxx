Description: Microsoft Pinball Arcade is a collection of seven licensed tables that represent the evolution of pinball in America. A state of the art physics model and realistic graphics make for the most authentic pinball simulation on the PC ever.

The appeal of pinball is universal, it pits man against nature in a struggle to keep a solid steel ball from rolling downhill towards the inevitable. Now, for the first time ever, you can trace the evolution of a pinball by playing seven of your all-time favorite pinball tables on your PC. The widest variety of tables, realistic ball physics, and add up to wickedly fast action for correct and prospective pinball wizards.

Features:

* Seven real tables. Features seven real tables licensed by Gottlieb and exactly replicated like the original arcade version.

* Superb physics model. Stellar flipper, bumper, ramps, ball and tilt physics give players the sensation they are playing the real tables. Ball reacts to environment with absolute precision.

* Superior graphics. Perfectly rendered and beautifully modeled tables look like real photographic images. Table design is seamless.

* Real arcade look and fell. The tables are exactly replicated from the original arcade classics. Feels like real arcade pinball, without plugging quarter after quarter! Full table view increases the arcade ambiance. So authentic that a supple wrist or table nudge can boost your score.

* Complete evolution of the pinball classics. Tables represent the evolution of pinball through the 20th Century. Tables for each decade portray the different milestones in pinball history.

HINT: For ambient background music from the decades, this release includes the game's original audio CD tracks in Ogg format -- at VBR quality 6 (nominal bitrate 192kbps) and therefore are very close in quality to the original WAV files. Play the corresponding track while you play a game or recreate the audio CD -- an InfraRecorder project is included for your convenience. Look for the music files in the folder marked "CDAudio".

Alternatively, insert any audio CD in the CD-ROM drive and start the game. Choose a pinball game (except for "Haunted House" or "Cue ball Wizard") and start. One track (but only 2 thru 6 correspondingly) of the audio CD will start when you begin the game.
