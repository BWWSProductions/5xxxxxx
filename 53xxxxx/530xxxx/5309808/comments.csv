Without the content, the movie is ruined, and not worth watching.  With the content intact, it's a great cult film.  What is this, Blockbuster Video?  This was never meant to be shown to children.  It's about the end of the world.  Jeesh.  What a waste of time.  It's like watching _Y Tu Mama Tabien_ without the sex, which Blockbuster edited out, leaving a 20 minute film that made no sense.  Stop this practice!"

I wonder if you can help me - I would love to be able to look at one of the paintings of the Virgin Mary and child, but they all seem to contain Christ's cock and balls. I wonder if you could edit these out for me, either by pixellation or perhaps leaving a smooth, rounded nub? Or maybe even we could insert a picture of Mickey fucking Mouse."

Wha? '...Could have contained...' well it does, or did, thus the edit. Also, '...which is presentable for...' Should that line be '...which is NOT presentable...' if it were presentable, what's the point of the edit? You do not make the sense your edit implies.

As for FilboidStudge, you got a fuckin' good laugh out of me. Ha, bloody funny. And given the vibe of this, and you're cool comment, do you reckon this is a catholic re-adjustment of actual truth? If you meet fear, just pretend it doesn't exist. And how for the folly of God, be 'StormChaser' by title and upload, self-hack to PG13? Is it so parents can threaten there kids saying: 

""this will happen if you don't believe in God, but there will also be violence and sex, which you don't get to see now because God is giving you a chance. And it's a-ok to get buggered by the Father, to avoid crisis""

Something ain't right here. Don't forget that God's get moody, and at least Zues got laid, often.

So my final point is Amen to the films, to translate, it simpily means 'so be it', if you don't want your kids to know sex and violence, turn off the power. It'll be so much fun to send them into this war driven humanity, bathed in innocence and ignorance, for the sake of Christ, I hope you don't have a daughter. On second thought, can I adopt her?

Edit the news...again..."

,Twilight99,2011-04-10T20:47Z,"I'm still looking for this movie (and it's made in 1990). I had a bad VHS-copy in the early 90's that I watched over and over. I loved this movie, and nobody else had even heard about it. And yes, the nudity and stong language in an itegral part of the movie. Editors should be spanked."
