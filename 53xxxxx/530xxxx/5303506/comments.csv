it seemed to work fine, until I run the application : the window of the application appears, then disappears right after... any idea why ?"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-26T19:30Z,"open your host file with notepad at 
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
and post in a coment what appears after
#	::1             localhost"
,braibs,2010-01-27T10:22Z,"I don't have the ""# ::1 localhost"" line, but I guess it is not important as it is a comment.. Anyway what I have after is :

,braibs,2010-01-31T18:06Z,"Thanks again for your advise :-)
In the meantime, I installed Audition instead. I works fine for what I had to do."
,wetWeasel,2010-02-10T16:43Z,"I'm not quite sure what this will do that Audacity won't do (and do for free I might add) but I'll have a look and see.

Download was fast and complete. scanned clean of malware installed easy, and it loads the audio file. 100% good.

Once again thething comes through with a great torrent."

,rtaghavi,2010-11-07T21:39Z,"can someone explain steps 5 & 6.

for step 5 I go t the folder but when i open it I have hundred different entries none of which say:

""127.0.0.1		activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		3dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		3dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		adobe-dns.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		adobe-dns-2.adobe.com

127.0.0.1		wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
127.0.0.1		activate-sjc0.adobe.com""

do i just copy and past these into the ""hosts"" file or am I supposed to replace certain ones?

For step 6 where am i putting the dll file exactly? "
,ako1101,2012-04-05T04:20Z,"I'm amazed on how easy to install the application and it works flawlessly. 

Another great torrent from thethingy."
