The password is "Wiiso.com" (Make sure the "W" is capitalized and it's not in quotations)

Can play with USB Loaders but may freeze in some areas of the game (It runs faster with a USB)

Can play with disc and doesn't freezes in any parts (but runs slower in cutscnes and opening doors)

So hope you goys have backward compatible Wii's like I do! :)
