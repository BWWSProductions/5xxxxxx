,LiLStenly,2010-02-09T09:05Z,"If you trying to get the patches, instead of installing my rip, you need to download and install them one by one in actual way, that I described in the info.
1 Spore
2 Patch 3
3 Galactic Adventures
4 Creepy And Cute
5 Patch 5
Appy the battery crack for patch 5 to play spore... use netshow mini image with poweriso or windows virtual cd to play galactic adventures.
Thats are the instructions to play the game and to obtain everything.
So in my rip I did exactly that thing and you don't have to do it.
Still when you already got the game and don't want to remove it, then you will have to install the rest in that order I mention up in the comment here."

,Mandusin,2011-07-01T12:49Z,"Thank you very much, works like a charms and believe it or not this installation fixes the ""No animation / no asymmetry bug"""
,Mandusin,2011-07-01T14:17Z,"Yeah about my previous post, Spore core game does work like a charm ( you don't even need to mount the .iso) Galactic Adventures however do not, since I'm pretty sure LiLStenly didn't try to screw us I'd like more info on how to run this game...

I myself have never worked with Virtual CD, I've used Virtual CD 10.1.0.13 demo version and the game doesn't recongise mounted image and (like most people here) returnes me message that CD isn't inserted - Quit

I doubt I'll get a response if you do however see this post I ask you to provide me with some address on which I can IM you.

Thanks. "
