,trini_skippy,2010-01-24T14:45Z,@adamken---> just load it with neogamma but first set region to force PAL.
,SmoothCrim,2010-01-24T20:51Z,omfg. Can u at least tell us what version neogamma and ur wii is? the information above is uselesss

,Stlouiscowboys,2010-01-24T21:25Z,"its been a while since i dusted off my Wii to play a game, but this works 100%.  If I remember right im using Neogamma 7.  I didnt think I would like it until I played it.  Its just pure fun, like the good old days of fighter games, only with more eye candy.  "
,SmoothCrim,2010-01-24T21:39Z,pls seed. also can someone check for me. Is the website Wiiso still up? Because it seems that the site is always down for me

,vjhggjh,2010-01-25T23:12Z,"Could someone help, as I get a black screen after I ""pushed any button"" at the main screen.
Could it because it's a PAL wii? Because that would be the first that was a problem."
,wiiS360,2010-01-26T03:25Z,PLEASE HELP ME!! I Just Hacked My Wii and i have home brew channel [if thats needed] and installed the DVDX. Do i need to get the Backup Launcher Channel? Do i burn this to a Disk or something?
,elma1337,2010-01-26T19:12Z,"go to http://gbatemp.net for tuts

do you have hardmod or softmod ?

anyways i recommand Neogamma R8 BC1 to load the game with after burned to disk ;) but you probably need to get some cIOS files first ...

Like I said go to the above site and search the forums :) "
,MattSwizz,2010-01-27T13:58Z,"this game isn't working for me, which is weird because i've downloaded several games from the uploader and they've all worked, any tips on getting it to go?

,elma1337,2010-01-27T17:44Z,"got NTSC or PAL ?

,MattSwizz,2010-01-27T19:44Z,"actually i'm NTSC, i've never had this problem with an NTSC game before. is there any specific settings i need to use?"

,Frtipachi,2010-01-29T05:03Z,"Download, used imgburn to convert rar to iso file, but this new iso file is not recognizable by Dolphin.  I guess first i should ask is this compatible with Dolphin, and second if it is can anyone provide me with help.  "
