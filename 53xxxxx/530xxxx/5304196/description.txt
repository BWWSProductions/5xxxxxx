I don't know why a Hollywood production needs two white actors to play Chinese, but that's what happened in 1963 with this episode.

The guest stars are Bethel Leslie and William Schallert.

Bethel actually got to play 2 roles: An old woman (in unconvincing age makeup) and her beautiful daughter.  She nails the younger role however, and really does look Asian!

Bethel did such a good job here that next season Richard Boone hired her to play different roles every week in his anthology series "The Richard Boone Show".
