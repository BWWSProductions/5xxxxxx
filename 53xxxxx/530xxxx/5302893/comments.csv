I've never seen this before, and I've only waited for it for about 2 minutes but that should be enough time to connect. All past cracks have worked. I'll go back to v2 if need be."

I have a fix for this 'steam disconnected error' everyone click my name its much simpler and u can use any of the 175 cracks."
,whatalegend123,2010-01-25T11:50Z,"thanks for all your work 50c3nt.
Its working great for me even after the newest steam update.
Dont allow gameoverlayUI.exe or something like that to run or it will not allow you to connect to the servers.
IT works like a treat,
Dont trust the BlazeyM post above most likely it is a virus as he is not a trusted uploader and the file is to small.
Cheers 50c3nt"
,dannybest559,2010-01-25T18:26Z,i get patch mp.ff is different from the server when i try to join game
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-25T18:39Z,"@Shadow9111: just try to search another match, It's working fine. Read the hydra500 comment at the bottom

@HMVinyl: this is the complete command list
http://bashandslash.com/images/stories/cod6/tweaks/console_mp.txt

@Drebin891: it's working fine, just run mw2, wait for the steam box appear in upper right corner, go to windows (alt+tab or alt+esc) and in the task manager kill the process called GameOverlayUI.exe (as say whatalegend123). return to mw2 and play

@BlazeyMc: that trick is already included in my instructions

@whatalegend123: thank you very much, working much better now, cheers"

,whatalegend123,2010-01-27T14:36Z,"@geezma you have to make sure that you have copied all of you call of duty folders across to the zero gear servers folder,not just the iwmp.exe.
@k2pikachu have you installed steam and have it running in the back ground.make sure you set your status to offline,
@everybody if you edit your filewall setting to always block gameoverlayUI.exe then you wont have to stop the process evertime."
,Messerschmitt,2010-01-27T17:01Z,"Greetings,
Can anyone let me know if I need steam running if I have MW2 and this patch/crack? 
Thank you"
,aggmann,2010-01-27T19:00Z,"Okay, this is fucking irritating. I am able to join maybe one of every fifteen games I try to connect to, without getting a ""patch_mp.ff"" error.
But everytime I connect to the game and spawn, every other player instantly leaves the game, leaving me alone in the session. This has happened everytime I try to play. 

So, is there a way to stop the frequent patch_mp.ff errors ( I can only play 1/15 sessions I try to connect to ) and how do I fix this problem with everybody but me disconnecting? Is it somesort of bug?
Please answer quickly, I haven't been able to play a single session."
,whatalegend123,2010-01-28T02:26Z,"@Aggman are you definately updated to the latest patch,try this and dowload the file thats recommended. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1074310"
