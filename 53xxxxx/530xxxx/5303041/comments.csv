[T],YourGreatestMember,2010-01-28T02:20Z,"@ dardar6t9
- Watch your mouth son, I have uploaded in excess of 10gb on this torrent and yet its not even got anyone to 100% for some reason."
,dardar6t9,2010-01-30T03:10Z,"I'm not your son....my father died recently...and freedom of speech is everybodys right,fossil...3 days to get to 67% and had 800mb uploaded off me.....screw that,I have limited my upload speed to 1kbs. I usually leave it at unlimited but this download is bleeding my bandwith dry"
[T],YourGreatestMember,2010-01-30T15:52Z,"@ dardar6t9
- I called you ""son"" metaphorically, i used it in such a way to empasaise that you were acting like a child. 
- If you don't like the torrent DON'T DOWNLOAD IT. You are getting this for free stop crying like a baby at slow download rates.
- I care not about your freedom of speech, there is a difference between freedom and immature, rude and childish behavior. 

I have a 2000% return on this download, giving me a ratio of 20:1

I don't know whether it's uTorrent or certain leechers but it seems to be giving new peers the the same stuff as what's already been distributed.s giving the new peer'

You limiting your upload rates makes the download even slower, because I would be having to distribute the parts you have out again, not allowing me to give the needed parts out."
,dardar6t9,2010-02-01T03:59Z,Thats life....only doing it for the kids anyway.....chances are it will be a load of rubbish series anyway. I prefer to read or work on projects rather than watch the garbage they call Audio/Visual entertainment anyway. :)
,adaptnz,2010-02-19T01:16Z,"Thx for this :)

A-9/V-9"
,Squrl,2010-03-26T21:53Z,"Had never heard of it before and figured I would try it.  Awesome Show and the quality is superb.  Thanks. 
PS Download speed was good too.  If you don't know if you want it get it anyway."
,jointheunc,2010-04-09T18:40Z,"

,aniaki,2010-05-27T14:36Z,"Someone should tell that idiot ""dardar6t9"" that if he sets his UPLOAD to 1kbs, it will also SLOW down his DOWNLOAD. The minimum upload speed it 10kbs to get unlimited download speed.


@YourGreatestMember, thanks for uploading this :)"
,sasblack7,2011-04-01T13:43Z,"@YGM, when will you re-upload with the full season?"
