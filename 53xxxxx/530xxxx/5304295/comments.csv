,pinshot,2010-04-17T18:30Z,"i really HATE that this 1080p rip is 4gig. its the most stupid thing ever. people who download in 1080p want the higher quality. This rip has the quality of upscaled DVD! 

just because it says 1080p DO NOT THINK YOU ARE GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR BLU RAY QUALITY because it is FAR from it.

,Blee__Raw,2010-05-15T05:54Z,will this work on x-box 360? I know mp4's work on it
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-11-16T10:10Z,"I have to agree with pinshot here, this is merely a upscaled DVD, please do not mislable things as bluray because It's just lie's, the 720p version found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5939769/From_Dusk_Till_Dawn_1996_720p_BRRip_x264-HDLiTE is much better quality and smaller file size, if you want the REAL bluray 1080p try here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5554848/From_Dusk_Till_Dawn_1996_%5BBluRay%5D%5B1080p%5D%5BENG__POL%5D%5BSub._POL%5D"
