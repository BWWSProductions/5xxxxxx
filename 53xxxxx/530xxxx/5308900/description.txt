Here are the subtitles for the Avatar TS going around with the Cyrillic language as a default. I came up with the subtitles from both my memory (I've seen it three or four times in the theater) and a script that's floating around on the internet. I strongly believe these are the most accurate subtitles available.

File is in SRT format.
