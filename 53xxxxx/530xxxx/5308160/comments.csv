How I Did It :

Note : You may want to Little Snitch it just to be sure it doesn't try contacting Autodesk. :)

1. Install Mudbox with the trial serial (all 0's)

2. After Mudbox installs, quit it, and run the crack.

3. Ignore the serial the crack gives you, and just continue running the crack.

4. It should do its stuff, and complete.

5. Close the crack, and run Mudbox to see if it worked. 99% It should work that way.

6. If it didn't work, try installing with the serial the crack gives you.
