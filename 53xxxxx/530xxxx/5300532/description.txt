I found this on demonoid;P

This package installs all the NTSC-U SEGA Genesis (16-bit) NTSC rom set as well as a pretty launcher and program for managing and playing the ROMSET.
THIS REQUIRES .NET FRAMEWORK V3.5 SP1 | (INCLUDED IN DOWNLOAD).

Windows 7 has everything you need, older versions of windows, you MUST install .NET 3.5



CHANGES
The SEGA Loader has a few new features based on user feedback:
* Added High Resolution Box Art
* Added Console button to educate users on the SEGA console
* Added Zoom link to open Box art in full screen
