It's two .exe files, which of course raises flags in my head, and the uploader doesn't exactly go out of his way to explain what it is, exactly.  I'm gathering it's just an all-in-one Genesis (MegaDrive) pack with its own emulator gui?   It says ""rom set as well as a pretty launcher and program for managing and playing"" So that's what I'm guessing, but I've never heard of anything like that before.   Well...I guess I'll post after it finishes."
