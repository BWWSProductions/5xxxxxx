,LetThemEatCake,2010-01-27T07:17Z,"Ya Sorry, Its being seeded from another computer which is obviously not working at the moment, bandwidth is not free where I live so Im messing around with some options. If I can't fix the problem in the next few days the failed torrents will be re up'd. Unfortunately patients is needed.
Hopefully shit will be all good soon :)"
