@khiljee,
Buddy, 720p Movie file can be accommodated within 2 GB file size, ONLY If the MP4/H264 etc codec used there for encoding purpose. Those codec indeed gives High Quality but, The Files having those codec are not playable on most of the standalone DVD players. But, On PC, those movie files Rocks! (Which SecretMyth Does.)

But, This is an AVI file so, If an encode on 720p/1080p of AVI format mostly have the filesize above 1.5 GB rather I'll say 2 GB. But, The plus point of that, they are playable on most of (Almost all) standalone DVD players.

Thats why AVI/MP4 does make difference in filesizes. ;)
