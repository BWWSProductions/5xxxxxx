Monty Python Sings(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
____________________________________


Monty Python Sings is a comedy album of songs written by the 
Monty Python team.

The song "Oliver Cromwell" was never released prior to this album.
It also contains a new recording "I've Got Two Legs," which had 
previously only been released as part of live recordings, and the 
previously rare single version of "The Lumberjack Song."
 
The album also has the complete version of the "Medical Love Song" 
and "Henry Kissinger," which each had a verse cut out of its 
appearance on Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album.

Amuse yourself for hours. Wind up everyone who knows you by singing 
Eric the half a bee repetitvely for days. 

This CD is so funny, even better than I thought it would be. 
I recomend having it in the car so other road users think you have a 
mental disorder due to uncontrolable laughter on the road!
