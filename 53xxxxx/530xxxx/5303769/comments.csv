,TheDSFSTeam,2010-01-24T10:02Z,"Im not trolling,  these are all old games.   they are exact copies.  and i have tested them myself"
,Strikefear13,2010-01-24T11:29Z,What's your excuse for all the 13mb xbox 360 games that were just removed from the site?
,TheDSFSTeam,2010-01-24T13:19Z,I have never copied xbox games and i called my friend who does do it and asked him why they were such a small file size and i found out i was doing it wrong.  i took them off until i can do it right.
