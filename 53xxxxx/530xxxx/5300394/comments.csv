Is it the M2ts, and whats the deal with that? "

(I know this is pretty late to be commenting!) It's not the M2TS...it's the bit rate. It's something like downsizing 25 Mbps to around 2 Mbps bit rate (in this particular case, around 2300 Kbps). The quality suffers, of course, but you wouldn't really notice it unless you're watching on a *really* big screen (something above 40 inches). The magic is ""AVC"". MKV is also very good for this sort of work, and I personally prefer MKV."
