,Daker9,2010-01-23T23:51Z,"This is my first attempt at uploading a torrent.
This is a great program and I have been using it for about 6 months now.
I love how well it works on my home LAN.
Enjoy and feel free to leave a comment if you like.
No RARS Easy crack :)"
,Daker9,2010-02-01T12:47Z,"If you like this torrent lease seed for a while. So far about twenty folks have helped themselves to this torrent and then kill the seed. 
I shouldn't have to be the only one.
See for a decent ratio please?
Thanks"
