,bbnchuck,2010-01-25T11:34Z,The audio and video speeds up at every song the songs should not be that fast. I know that for a cause i seen it 3 times at the movies opening day plus i have the Home Made Conversion found here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5273410/Alvin_And_The_Chipmunks_The_Squeakquel_-_Home_Made_Conversion_%28M witch is still the best version out for audio.
