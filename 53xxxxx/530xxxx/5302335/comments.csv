Thanks for this upload!
Please Help!
I'm unable to launch this game using any usb loader it just displays Now Loading for about 5 secs then freezes. I'm able to run older and newer games wo problem.  "

I assume it's an IOS-reloading game, which can't run on USB Loaders as the communication to the USB ports is lost during the IOS reload command :-(
Should work from Disc Loading tho...

Thanks!
