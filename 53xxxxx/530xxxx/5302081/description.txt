We face many serious problems today including excess debt and worldwide economic depression, peak oil, nearing peak coal and minerals, climate change, soil and fresh water depletion, collapsing fish stocks, and species extinction. All of these are symptoms of a larger unifying predicament, namely that the human species is in serious overshoot.

If you are seeking a deeper understanding of our predicament I highly recommend this October 2009 seminar by the Population Institute titled "Population Growth and Rising Consumption: Whatâ€™s Sustainable?â€.


I found these talks very helpful for building an integrated understanding of what is going on.


The talks include:
Population and the Environment: Whatâ€™s Sustainable? (William R. Catton, Jr.)
A Pivotal Moment: Population, Justice and the Environmental Challenge (Laurie Mazur)
Economics and Limits to Growth: Whatâ€™s Sustainable (Dennis Meadows)
Peak Economy (Richard Heinberg)
Managing without Growth: Slower by Design, not Disaster (Peter A. Victor)


Each talk consists of a ppt/pdf presentation and a video. When viewing the talks you should open one window with the video and another window with the presentation.


I have only included the ppt/pdf presentations in this torrent. You can get the videos quickly without any need to share from here:

If you prefer to also get the ppt/pdf presentations without using this torrent you can get them here:

I posted this simply to bring your attention to an excellent seminar. I will not be offended if everyone gets the talks from the above links and no one downloads this torrent.
