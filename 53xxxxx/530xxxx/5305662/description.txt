                    Costume drama. Alf throws a party to celebrate  
                    moving into a cottage of his own. He entertains  
                    his guests with a new song, and its haunting  
                    words have a profound effect on all of them.  
                    Edmund rebels against his parents; Thomas and  
                    Margaret have their first marital tiff; and  
                    Dorcas's plans to prepare Minnie for marriage  
                    and motherhood backfire terribly. How will  
                    harmony be restored? And what are the contents  
                    of the odd parcel that arrives at the post  
                    office, which Minnie wants to keep a secret?
