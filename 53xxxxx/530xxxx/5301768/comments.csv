From your short description I'm guessing this is the newer Russian zone. Not to mention this game has a monthly fee to access it and would have needed to pay for the full version first to get an account.

This would be good for archival purposes but in no way will allow you to play the game for free other than to create a trial account. You need to clarify a lot of this for us in your notes."

It downloads directly from the official website http://www.lotro.com/, both the regular and high resolution versions, so just download it there instead."
,AH6194,2010-09-30T02:11Z,"@beano311 What? ok so what will happen if I download this and install it, will it be as normal as the one from the official site, or will it not work at all, please respond to this as quickly as you can, so I don't have to download this from scratch."
,AH6194,2010-09-30T09:43Z,"It's Russian, why didn't you write that in the description. Is there a way to turn it to english? Please any response will be appreciated."
