Jack Johnson - En Concert

=Forward=
This is a 1080p rip of the BluRay version of Jack Johnson's En Concert. Included are both 5.1 and stereo DTS audio tracks, multiple subtitle languages, and chapters. The grainy effect on the video is part of Jack's and the directors vision for the film, and not symptomatic of a poor transfer. A sample file is included.

=Description=
In the summer of 2008 Jack Johnson took a trip through Europe playing everywhere from historical venues to classic outdoor stages making it the biggest tour of his career. The film is a collection of live performances with Jack's quartet along with special appearances by G. Love, Ben Harper, Mason Jennings, Neil Halstead and Matt Costa. Through weathering the stormy nights in Newquay to surfing on a river in Germany, to playing the packed house in London's Hyde Park, the film takes you on a trip and captures the connection between an audience and an artist on an international stage. This is more than a compilation of performances, this is an intimate look at Jack Johnson, his life on the road, and the unique dialogue he has with his fans. 

=From the Director=
All of Jack's profits from the 2008 tour, and this release will be going to fund the Kokua Hawaii Foundation and the Johnson Ohana Family trust which will provide continuing endowments to Jack's favorite environmental charities.
