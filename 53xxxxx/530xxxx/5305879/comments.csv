For those of you that really care about quality, download the samples and compare.  Watch in original size.  Big difference."

And you say all that shit but... which torrent is more popular? Your bitrate is too low for 1080p, and extra audio tracks are a waste of space."
,Triplepost,2010-01-30T23:57Z,"LOL - What a paranoid oaf.  I have never voted on torrents. 

Oh and yes, MySiLU's transfer is inferior in every way.  Might as well download the DVD rip. 

And if you noticed, this is a music concert.  Some people actually care how it sounds.  Multi-track and stereo tracks are mixed different.

And leave out chapters and subtitles?  Unfinished and unpolished.  Just like you.

McDonalds sells millions of burgers a day, guess that means that they taste better then Ruth's Chris steaks, huh?"
