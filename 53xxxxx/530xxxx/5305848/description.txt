Discogs Profile:
Founded in 1988 by Thomas Fehlmann, to release Detroit-influenced dance tracks by himself and his friends.

In 1989, Fehlmann made acquaintances with the good doctor Alex Paterson of The Orb, whose dayjob was A&R for E'G Records. This led to Teutonic Beats licensing tracks by Marathon and a compilation (Teutonic Beats: Opus Two) to E'G.
