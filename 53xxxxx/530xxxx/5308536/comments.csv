Thx"
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2010-01-29T17:44Z,"It is the same good copy that is already out there. I have watched it several times before this one. Thank you Intslacker, I could never seem to get the subs to work. Now I don't have to guess what was going on and what was said, I can read it. LOL"

,intlslacker,2010-01-30T13:46Z,"Yes 5h, this is a cam.  In fact, I said that in the description.  ""Yes I know it's the same TS [CAM] copy of Avatar floating around everywhere..."" but this is for people like BoonDockSaiNt30 who don't like screwing around with subs.  I admit it's not great a/v, but it's what's available, and since I'm not personally going to go sit through this movie with a video camera, I'm just hoping it helps out others.  Waydos, I encoded it with 128kbps cbr mp3 via lame codec, 900kbps Xvid via ffmpeg, subtitles are from a file I got from the internet and ONLY cover the Na'vi parts.  And to everyone, Please go see this movie I guarantee that while you may enjoy watching this for free at home, you will appreciate the movie much more if you see it in the theater."
,adell1979,2010-01-31T16:14Z,I can't burn this torrent because the file is too big for the DVD. Is there a way to split it up into 2 parts?
,intlslacker,2010-02-01T02:29Z,"Splitting is super easy here's a simple guide for you using virtualdub.  http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/cut_avi_with_virtualdub.cfm

,adell1979,2010-02-01T16:25Z,Thank You!
,adell1979,2010-02-03T15:31Z,"Hi, I do have one more question. I went to Virtual Dub and one of the instructions is after you open the file to go to the video setting and select direct stream copy. I know this is stupid but I can't find where to select the video and audio setting! I tried to email the webmaster of that page but they won't email back. "
