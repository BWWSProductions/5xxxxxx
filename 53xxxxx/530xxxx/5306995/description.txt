 Influenza pandemics, triggered by bird or swine flu viruses, have the potential 
 to kill millions of people. The influenza virus has existed for millions of
 years as an innocuous intestinal virus of wild ducks. What turned a
 harmless waterborne duck virus into a killer? In an engaging multimedia
 presentation, Dr. Michael Greger traces the human role in the evolution
 of this virus and suggests what society can do to reduce  the likelihood 
 of such potential catastrophes in the future.
