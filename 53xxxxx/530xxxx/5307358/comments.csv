This is mapsource... so dont need install from garmin website...

Or do you mean check updates??"
,PlatinumAzz,2010-01-25T20:08Z,"Yes, download an erlier mapsource (google). This is a new mapsource version that you cant unlock maps."
,jurijvm,2010-01-26T08:50Z,"If you're having problems sending maps to your device, remove the tile ""Badajoz, Spain"". If not, tell us, so we will download this version :)"
,FrasseDaMan,2010-01-26T11:01Z,"The new install package for CNEU NT 2010.30 will install MapSource 6.15.10 and MapInstall 3.13.4.
Both of the new applications have enforced high encryption locking with digital certificate files.

Circumvent by making a backup of the working set of MapSource.exe and MapInstall.exe before updating. Then put back your old and working EXE-files to your Garmin directory.

Now you can use JetMouse KG again even for CNEU NT 2010.30 & CNNA NT 2010.40."
,zorza100,2010-01-27T00:24Z,"headsup:
1) copy not only mapsource.exe and mapinstall.exe, but all files named mapsource and mapinstall to a backup directory (this is the .exe, the .dll, etc)
2)To install, go to \IMG direcory and run the setup for your language.
3)badajoz spain not working.

,Arlen_Ness,2010-01-28T05:45Z,"It asks to run this:
run Setup.exe in the Windows subdirectory to begin
the update process.
then comes up with:
Select the region you would like to install on your GPS.
there is nothing in the drop down box.
Step by step simple instructions would be appreciated as the read me text file in teh download doesn't work.. cheers in advance."

,testogel,2010-01-28T14:28Z,"Tnks, working perfect, convert .gmp files to .img using proper tools and y can still use MapSource 6.13.7, then use jetmouse kg to unlock."
,nbarch,2010-01-29T12:19Z,"The new version of mapsource requires an unlock code (Jetmouse KeyGen) and is also incorporating a new Digital Signature, may be linked to GPS firmware.
We need Jetmouse to look at this!"

,brianxxx,2010-02-01T16:45Z,"2010.40 version is out and it corrects a lot of mapping mistakes in the previous version.

,Hackeenrek,2010-02-01T20:39Z,"doesn't work for me, when i try to install mapsource i need a 8-digit product key and the jetmouse keygens are much longer.

where the f*ck can i find my product key or a product key generator, i have downloaded already a few garmin city navigator releases but none of them include a mapsource key or tell how to find a mapsource key..."
,stambo98,2010-02-03T10:17Z,"You can add Badajoz, Spain after removing. Transfer the Europe map set to flash drive, transfer only Badajoz,Spain to flash drive (rename previous transfer !), use GMapTool to join Badajoz,Spain to Europe set."
,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-04T00:32Z,City Navigator Europe NT 2010.30 Revision B is now available at myGarmin.
,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-04T00:32Z,"@Hackeenrek
Don't try online registration. Use Utilities, Manage Map Products... Ctrl+U. Select Unlock Regions and then Add... button."
,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-04T00:45Z,"@natzori and all others
Try the patched MapSource v6.15.11. Unlock with JetMouse works and creation with BADAJOZ included works.

Search for it at GPS Underground or Noeman GSM among others."
,petar2258,2010-02-04T18:26Z,"install 2010.20, backup folder Garmin where is located mapsource.exe and mapinstall.exe

,emisaki,2010-02-06T10:55Z,@FrasseDaMan What do you mean with City Navigator NT 2010.30 Revision B is now available at myGarmin? 
,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-07T15:39Z,"Garmin MapSource v6.15.11 special.

Works well with JM KG unlocked CNNANT 2010.40 & CNNEUT 2010.30.

,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-07T15:49Z,"@emisaki - About CNEUNT 2010.30b:

City Navigator Europe NT 2010.30b is a new release with some corrections for lane assist additions (JCV) and language details.

The ones with a lifetime subscription of City Navigator Europe NT can download the new 2010.30b from their myGarmin account. 2010.30b was released around Feb 03, 2010. Hopefully someone will share that release also.

However, there's still the problem with highway A4 in northern Italy classified as urban road 50 km/h."
,emisaki,2010-02-09T12:59Z,Let us hope that someone will upload it City Navigator Europe NT 2010.30b
,iamsougly,2010-02-10T12:41Z,"install 2010.30 and than install 2010.20, it will overwrite map source 6.15.10 with 6.15.7. Than you can use BADAJOZ from ver. 2010.20"
,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-10T23:05Z,"The BADAJOZ map part in southern Spain works perfectly in CNEUNT 2010.30. The problem is with the MapSource version that's not compatible with CNEUNT 2010.30. Legitimate users receive a GMA digital certificate for CNEUNT 2010.30. Trying to avoid the need ot a GMA file by using MapSource v6.15.7 makes the BADAJOZ problem to occur.
Users unlocking with JM KG v1.5 should use MapSource v6.15.11 special patched version.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5343176/Garmin_MapSource_6.15.11_Special

There's also the newer release of CNEUNT 2010.30b.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5351614/Garmin.RMU.CNEUNT.2010.30.b

I'm waiting for a torrent of CNEUNT 2010.30c that was released by Garmin 8th of February. That one should correct the problem with northern Italian autostrada A4 classification error (50 km/h).
