,xJ3izzaros,2010-06-24T15:25Z,Does this game works?
,Vaugith,2010-08-22T03:43Z,This isnt working for me. Installer quits when 99% complete.
,Netot12345,2010-09-20T09:33Z,"Torrent is working fine. ISO format, includes latest patch, latest noCD, and some unofficial tools. Started and played a bit, works fine. As perfect as it gets. Thanks."
,Mornx,2010-09-26T17:20Z,"does anyone have a solution to the 99% installation cancel problem? trying on win xp pro 64 bit here with daemon tools

ich would really like to get it to work"
,miki811,2010-10-05T09:41Z,"Works fine on my machine with GF FX5200 128mb Windows XP 32bit
---------------------------------
1.Install Full game
2.Run Update and Crack the game
3.Mount CD3 and Play"
,matancur,2010-10-12T18:01Z,"Hey guys, it install nicely, no trouble there, but it won't start, it just starts loading and quits, doesn't get past a black screen before doing so. There's no sound, no nothing, it just quits after a couple of seconds :S.

I tried playing unpatched/uncracked with Daemon Tools, gave me the quits and after I patched and cracked, same thing.

What gives?

Got a C2D laptop with a Nvidia 8600 GS if that helps.

Thanks in advance."
,matancur,2010-10-12T19:45Z,"Nevermind, I got it."
,Breyvan,2010-11-07T21:18Z,How come i get a message saying there are no previous versions of beyond goos & evil installed and how do i fix this problem cause it wont install
,Zait12,2011-01-01T16:08Z,"Those who get the message ""you don't have any previous game installed"" are doing it wrong.

The .exe named ""beyond_good_evil_v1.01"" isn't the installer, that's an updater. You install the game by running deamon tools or similiar on BGE_CD1.mdf/mds.

Sadly, I have the ""stops loading at 99%"". Windows 7 64bit."
,Zait12,2011-01-03T22:04Z,"Hey again. I noticed that my problem wasn't that it got stuck at 99% but that it deletes the files.

After running through the 3 ""cds"" while checking my installation folder repedetly, I notice that the files are created and grow in size. When the installation is done, all the files are deleted.

Copying it during those seconds when it's done installing but hasn't deleted the files didn't give anything. Could try with cutting it out instead of copying but I'm bored of retrying.

If you manage to fix this problem somehow, post a comment. I'll check often."
,sunaadh,2011-01-27T20:52Z,"Windows 7 64 bit. Have the same problem as others - 99% installation and then WHAM! no setup, no game, nowt. If anyone could fix this please comment!"
,kyraz0,2011-01-30T23:27Z,Well for me it worked on windows 7 once I put it on winxp compatibility mode.
,Crebblez,2011-03-04T06:55Z,Same problem here with the installation not finishing. Ubisoft used a copy protection (Tages) that is incompatible with x64 OS's. The installation aborts when it tries to install the DRM and deletes itself completely. Even the original retail discs will not work on x64. Gotta love Ubisoft. The only work-around I am aware of is installing on a 32 bit OS and copying the files over..
,NoScrub,2011-03-10T13:20Z,"Guide to using this torrent if you're using Win7 64;
1.Mount the first CD using your ISO tools program
2. Go to the CD and explore it
3. Right click 'Setup' and go to compatability
4. Let windows choose to use Windows XP S.2
5. Install and profit :)

Good luck."
,Crebblez,2011-03-12T08:02Z,@NoScrub Tried it again using your method and no luck. Still cancels out at the end and uninstalls itself. :/ 
,NoScrub,2011-03-13T20:08Z,"Yeah sorry I realized.
I personally have not found any way of fixing this.
I've changed/added a registry.
I've installed it on another computer and copied the whole directory over to my main computer.
I've tried changing what OS it opens from.
Hell i've even installed the TAGES that Ubisoft applied to it.

Sorry people, if you have a 64bit OS this won't work. You'll have to buy it from GOG or Steam :("
,mcon1964,2011-03-18T10:39Z,"I found a way to get this to fully install on my
windows xp laptop.When I got to 99%, I got an
error message saying wrong disk inserted and 
the options abort, try again, and continue. I 
just kept clicking continue (it came up several
times). Finally, it came to the screen that gives
you the option to create a desktop icon. The 
same error message came up again, then I
switched to cd1 (I use daemon tools) and
clicked continue again. This time the game
finished the installation. Then I used the update
installer. The game worked ok. My laptop is
5 years old and the first time I ran it, I set the
screen resolution to max but had a major 
slowdown problem. Then I used the settings 
application to change back to 640 x 480 and
that solved the problem. Strangely, I don't have 
slowdowns on other games from 2003, so go
figure. I have a Windows 7 64 bit computer as
well and I will try to install it on that. If I can 
get it to work, I will let you know. Hope this
helps:)"
,Ackquirta,2011-04-14T21:03Z,"[(Minor Spoiler)]

I can install and run just fine, but when I'm supposed to get the 2nd triangle key from the bots it wont come down from the shute.
I can't find any solutions anywhere else so now I'm askeng here. Any help would be appreciated."
,bluepc,2011-04-30T11:24Z,"Awesome Game. 
Works on XP 32-bit! 
For anyone with trouble with 64-bit / Tages you might try the wog.com version.
No need to buy the ""hd"" release."
,vaijiro,2011-05-30T11:53Z,"For everyone with x64 system, search for Beyond Good & Evil [GOG] or go to http://www.gog.com and buy it for 10 bucks:)"
,a1s,2011-06-23T23:54Z,"I'm not 100% on this, but this might not be a working game. My CD emulator claimed that none of the 3 disk images are well... disk images. (I have used MDFs before so it's not format incompatibility.) Consider choosing a different source."
,sansyeux,2011-07-15T06:42Z,if only a pirate brother could hook up another broke pirate on this matter with a gog rip/version ...but oh well.i will wait two weeks and see if i buy it on ps3.why isn't the hd version on pc dammit =
,GrimeyMike,2011-07-16T05:34Z,Super Quick D/L over 1.3 MB/s Thanks... hope all works well will try to remember to come back and comment.
,GrimeyMike,2011-07-16T05:37Z,"whoops I posted on the wrong page, I haven't begun downloading this yet..... uh disregard the previous comment... sorry but thanks for the up if I do decide to d/l."
