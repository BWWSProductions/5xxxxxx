Wellington, 1957, Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) lives with his domineering mother (Elizabeth Moody). To his mother's dismay, Lionel falls for a local shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita (Diana PeÃ±alver), and while snooping on the two during a visit to the zoo, Lionel's mother is bitten by the Sumatran Rat-Monkey. The animal's bite slowly turns her into a ravenous zombie. Lionel is horrified, but, ever the dedicated son, is determined to care for her.

This movie is the funniest, and goriest zombie movie I've ever seen. It's awesome. You should download it purely for the awesome priest.
