In the game of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, players will return
to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have
a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients
in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team
to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Rons romantic entanglements
as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the
Half-Blood Prince.
