Here is Conan O'brien's first night as host of "Late Night" replacing David Letterman. 

This Torrent contains the full first show.

His "cold open" for this premiere is just as good as the one for The Tonight Show was even if it's ending is a bit "unsettling" in light of what's come to pass.

Enjoy it in all it's spectacular 'transferred from VHS to AVI' glory and...

>>>>>>props go to Fitty wherever he or she is for being not only a BIG fan but one that was SMART enough to tape it and post it on TPB originally.


 >>>>>>>>>>> ENJOY THE SHOW !!!!!!
