                    Who Killed Alec the Dwarf?               
                    Sitcom set in the world of a group of    
                    sixth-form students living in Abingdon as they  
                    enjoy a final romp with adolescence. The gang  
                    decide to perform a radio play for their  
                    general studies course, written and directed by  
                    Ollie. However, the power goes to his head and  
                    he ends up sacking them hours before it's about  
                    to go on air. Can Matt save the day?
