Nerdy college student Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg) has survived the plague that has turned mankind into flesh-devouring zombies because he's scared of just about everything. Gun-toting, Twinkie loving Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) doesn't have any fears. Together, they are about to stare down their most horrifying challenge yet: each other's company. Co-starring Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, get ready to "nut up or shut up" in this double-hitting, head-smashing comedy.
