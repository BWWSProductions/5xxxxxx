Okay, for all of you who were searching for a proper, high quality rip, here it is.  

Every radio station from GTA Liberty City Stories in its entirety, every cut scene, even the ambience, it's all here, tagged with artwork, converted directly from the game data.  It won't get any better than this.

Made possible with a copy of the game, and the following guide:

If you don't like this rip, or you'd like the radio stations separated by track, feel free to take a crack at it yourself.
