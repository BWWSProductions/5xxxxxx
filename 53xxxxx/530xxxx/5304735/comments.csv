I actually uploaded it FIRST, so yeah, the whole series is there."

,PisstreeKeedas,2011-01-08T03:16Z,I was just wondering if there's anything wrong with episode 2 because it lags heaps for me and skips a lot of bits. I'm using VLC and Ep1 worked fine and ep3 works as far as I can tell. Is anyone else having this problem? But great upload anyway. I don't really like the way the subbing as been done so I'm watching it in English.

,fuzzeh,2012-07-13T13:06Z,"I ran into the problems with ""lag"" on VLC as well, and its the only player I have that can play the subs correctly. Also, I am too stubborn to install another media player. It seems the problem lays in codec's frame rate being set to something like 9000. I dont know how to change or limit the players max fps, but I do know how to convert the video file in real time to fix the lag. This is not hard, it takes a few seconds to set up and the settings are saved in a profile. 
1. in VLC press CTRL+shift+o
2. add your episode you are having trouble with
3. ***on the play button click the drop down arrow*** select convert
4. check display the output
5. click the button with the screwdriver and wrench 
6. select MKV encapsulation
video codec tab-> 
check keep original video
set frame rate to 25
Audio codec-> check keep original
7. click save and then start
On the next episode that lags, all these settings will be saved so you will only have to do steps 1-4"
