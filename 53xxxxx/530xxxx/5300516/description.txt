Juliette Lewis's First Album.



Some more music I have not seen here. This is my second Torrent uploaded, I've been coming here for years but just recently discovered how to create torrents and share them, and am doing so as much as I can, I love to share.

TO ALL, I know its stupid to put this in description, but all my torrents are 100% safe, I have absolutly no motives other than to share, so I'm hoping you all will notice and give me a Skull of some sort so people know that my torrents are safe.

"I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.â€

â€œA bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog.â€

-J. London
