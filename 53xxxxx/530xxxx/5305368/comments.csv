An early Herzog step...

Short (13 Min.) Documentary style story of a man who is rescued from an island that once housed a leper colony and how he's better for it even if he won't talk to anyone as a result.

Surreal and often very funny, thanks to the constant repetition of the lines of dialog. This is the place where you really can see the Herzog style coming into being. There is wonderful local music, portrait like shots of the characters and haunting images of the landscape. Like the rest of the early Werner Herzog films I watched in this sitting its more a sketch than a real film, but at the same time its a pretty good sketch.

Worth a look"
