Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

WDTV users change extension from .m4v to .mp4

Apparently there is a sync problem with MP4 for WDTV Live with the latest firmware.

It is discussed here 
http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=8778
and here 
http://community.wdc.com/t5/WD-TV-Live-Firmware/1-0-17-MP4-Audio-Sync/td-p/6146

and suggested to rollback firmware to revision 1.01.00

PS3 user may need to rename to .mp4 also if you are playing from USB device.  Should be fine if you are just streaming with the .m4v extension.

Apple TV user ensure running firmware 3.0.1  Use custom iTunes movie sync option "Automatically include the 10 most recent movies along with selected movies."

Note:

Contains extra subtitles and commentary tracks.  These can be muxed into the MP4 on a MAC with Subler.  With Subler make sure you make each new Audio Track a unique name and select English.  For Subtitles do the same thing, other than change language for the others.  Or on a PC you could remux the whole thing into MKV if you want everything into one package.

Main MP4 is just under 4gb for PS3 FAT32 compatibility.
