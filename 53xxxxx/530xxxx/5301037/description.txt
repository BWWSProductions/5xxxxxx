A nail-biting psychological thriller, that never lets you go. Set in New York
State, the story center's on juvenile murderer, Eric Poole, who at 18, is
released from jail having served his sentence for the murder of a young girl.
Russell Crowe plays the hard-bitten detective who put him away and who is sure
that Poole is a potential serial killer who will re-offend. He makes it his
mission to keep Poole under surveillance as he sets off on a seemingly innocent
road trip up-state. But all is not as it seems as Poole soon finds himself on
the run with a young girl who has become obsessed with him and may or may not
have been witness to the first murder.
