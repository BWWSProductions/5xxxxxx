Kaspersky deletes main file as a false positive.

I switched Kaspersky to 'Block Network Traffic' then 'Pause Protection', to install AIFF...
AIFF... installed and batch coverted to mp3 really fast. Brilliant!

I LOVE YOU!! been tryin to find a program just like this!  :-)"
,PetFin,2011-01-30T02:27Z,"Better option than above, go to Kaspersky (or whatever)> Settings>'Threats & Exclusions' and point to the AIFF MP3 CONVERTER folder, and exclude it, if you prefer.

This is a bit neater than the previous.

(Just do this when you know a file is safe)  :-)"
