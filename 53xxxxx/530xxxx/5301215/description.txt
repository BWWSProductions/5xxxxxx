we have a much improved line-up in a 6.88GB CDG offering (or 4.8GB zipped)  which makes the older versions obsolete, and with many great additions plus better versions substitutions too. 

The complete 6.88GB cdg offerings is our best yet! unzipped cd+g and rar zipped
7.5GB Divx versions can be found on the net. These versions are vastly improved from our previous collections. The DivX offerings are improved with 1100k bitrate and are individually compressed into rar files for you.

We have taken "a bit of licence" with the particular range of songs
we have allowed into this category of Spiritual selections, such as "the 
greatest love" and we have as well "The prayer" (of "Andrea Bocelli/Celine 
Dion duet" fame)

We have two servers designated for our launches so please stay in while we 
get the seeding pattern to a high enough speed to do justice to those that
support these great efforts to preserve quality music tastes in our communities.
