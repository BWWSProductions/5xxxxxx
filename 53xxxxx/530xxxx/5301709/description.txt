Celebrity competition hosted by Myleene Klass and Alan Titchmarsh in which chart-topping popstars are taught to perform like opera singers. The remaining seven contestants are working hard to stay on the show, under the tutelage of mentors Katherine Jenkins and Rolando Villazon. The stars will perform live in a bid to win public votes and impress the panel, which this week includes Meat Loaf and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. After the performances, viewers have the opportunity to vote for their favourite singers. Who will be going home today
