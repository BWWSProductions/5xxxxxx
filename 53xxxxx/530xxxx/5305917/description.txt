Searched everywhere till i eventually found this game. I could not believe how hard was to find it, and the game rocks. Only oneventually which sucks as those links might die at any time. 
It's an old game, but hell of a fun. I've had months of fun with the rubiks playground part of the game, solving the puzzles on extra hard in as many ways as i could. 

So, whoever is for a hell of a fun and likes to solves puzzles, you won't regret this game. Plus i hope it spreads around so that if i ever lose it again, i can find it :)

Cheers
