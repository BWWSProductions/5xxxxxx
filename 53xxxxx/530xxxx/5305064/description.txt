This week's episode notes:

Thereâ€™s really not much we can say about this episode except, â€œSorryâ€. Sorry it was a week late due to illness. Sorry it was even recorded in the state of mind we were in. If you would like to hear a few minutes of Seven nearly dying, please feel free to keep the podcast running past the end music. Consider yourself forewarned, its probably not for those with a weak stomach.
