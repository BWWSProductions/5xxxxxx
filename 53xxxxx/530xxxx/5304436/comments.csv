,elrewesh782005,2010-01-27T21:21Z,"To All who hate islam and say that they are terrorists,
First islam forbidden  us to kill innocent people and who do that will go to hell
Second if muslim kills innocent people and make terrorist attacks that's doesn't mean that this is islam
Third America used Nuclear bombs to Kill innocent People in japan is that's mean that all Americans are too bad ?? "
,ojaideadhead,2010-04-08T01:33Z,"The killing of infidels is taught in the  Quran..
It is a religion of intolerance...just like Christianity
All religion is a danger to the planet. Think for yourself.....There is no hell....free yourself from the tyranny of religious tradition  and oppression.
Be followers of truth and not men..There is a higher power that is not interested in whose side you on, or who has a bigger God or Savior..
Think logically.... "

You are deceiving non-muslim people, using Al Taqqia
You tell: First islam forbidden us to kill innocent people and who do that will go to hell. 
But you do not tell that islam teachings say that ONLY muslims are innocent. Kafir (non-muslims) are by birth INNOCENT, halal to be killed!
Your second statement is also a big lie: Read the horror stories in Sahih Bukari and in the Sira!
Your third statement: Muslims ALWAYS are fingerpointing to the history of the West to justify their autocraties. This will NEVER justify their blood sheds."
