The Eagles are, without a doubt, one of the most influential American bands of all time. Direct from L.A., these musicians brought together various influences and melded them into a sound that established a new musical direction in both rock ... Full Descriptionand country. 

The songs on this "best of" compilation cover the Eagles' early years (pre-HOTEL CALIFORNIA) and they pack a wallop. From the spooky, Native American-influenced "Witchy Woman" to the mournful folk-rock gem "Desperado," the collection is almost a primer on how to write a country-rock song. Whether it's the opening guitars driving the beat of "Take It Easy" or the lilting melody of "Best Of My Love," the Eagles' tight harmonies, smooth lead vocals and masterful musicianship enable THEIR GREATEST HITS to play like a jukebox in country-rock heaven. 

The songs are also stylistically diverse: The Grammy-winning "Lyin' Eyes" is pure Eagles pop; "One Of These Nights," with its slippery bass line, is a Steely Dan-like rock-jazz track; "Tequila Sunrise" has a steel guitar and Latin beat subtle enough to lull any hangover. The songs' themes range from anger to bliss, with longing in the forefront and an outlaw sensibility in the shadows. Not too traditional to turn off rock and folk fans, and not so slick that country aficionados would bolt, the Eagles' repertoire is solid, memorable and expertly produced. Lyrically ("...don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy...") and musically, these are songs that have become a vital part of the musical lexicon.
