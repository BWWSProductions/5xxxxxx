This is all my Comedy Central videos . re coded to play on PDA or IPOD or phones. All in AVI Xvid codec.  

There are 50  clips of approx 30 mins each ,so about 25 hours total size 1.5 gigs

If you need to  re code any of the videos I recommend using one of the best  FREE
Video/audio  converter called Format factory . it is very Intuitive to use.

Enjoy and............


please........ when you have finished downloading to just leave it seeding a while longer to keep it alive for everyone else. You can always set your torrent to upload at a limited speed. Something is always better than nothing.
