Sandra never had a lot of money. Early on in life she was in a horrible car accident that 
resulted in her losing her memory and landed her in an orphanage. Now, as an adult, she has 
decided to answer an invitation to participate in a Million Dollar Quest! It seems exciting at 
first, involving trips all around the world, but it begins to get a little freaky as numerous 
Hidden Object clues in the competition seem linked to her amnesia and lost childhood memories.
