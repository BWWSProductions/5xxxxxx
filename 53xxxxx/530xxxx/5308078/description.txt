"There is a place, a whole world that belongs only to the cats. A hidden world known as 'BANIPAL WITT' where the sun changes creatures from the outer world into monsters. Travel there as two young children set off on a fanciful trip with a desperate group of feline engineers to save BANIPAL WITT from the evil-sorceror cat, Buburina, whose very touch turns ny living thing into a balloon! With this talent and the monster dog, Papadoll, Buburina hopes to control all of BANIPAL WITT and only Toriyasu, Papadoll's former owner, has any hope of returning Papadoll back to normal. But can they rescue Papadoll and defeat Buburina before the sun rises?"
