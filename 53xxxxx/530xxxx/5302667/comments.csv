It shows Quicken 2010 R2 version after installation. R5 is available at present moment, but I can't update to it - got message ""Oops! Quicken was not able to install the update. Please restart your computer and try again"". Restart doesn't help. I have downloaded QW10R3Patch.exe and QW10R5Patch.exe manually from Intuit's site, but result is the same.
Does anybody have upgraded successfully to R3 or R5 from this version? "
,FuzzySPb,2010-02-04T07:41Z,Problem with update to R5 was occurred only on one PC. I have successfully updated to R5 on another PC without any problems.
