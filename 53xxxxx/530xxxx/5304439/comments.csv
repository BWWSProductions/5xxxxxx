Eurosport starts coverage of the Winter Olympic on 12th Feb at 4:30pm GMT with various preview programmes.

The Opening Ceremony is on 13th Feb and will be shown on Eurosport and BBC2/HD at 1:45am GMT. You should hopefully have coverage of the event from your public TV service.

As there's a lot of stuff - to much for me alone to do - I'll probably be helping out with some of the BBC coverage at the torrent site thebox.bz"
