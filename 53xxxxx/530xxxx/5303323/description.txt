BBC R3 - Bruce Stewart's 'Speak Low'
Piano played by Bruce Stewart
Directed by Sean Macglochlin
Broadcast May 6, 1996
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya
working together in New York in 1944.

Brecht is as angry as ever.

Another excellent cast. I doubt that many
playwrights get the chance to play a piano
in a production of their own play.
