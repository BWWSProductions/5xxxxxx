Most people's view of The Home Guard is a more serious less
bumbling version of what the BBC TV programme 'Dad's Army'
presented. And some of it was. But that is not the whole story. 

There were other groups formed under the same umbrella. 

These broke into two strands. One was farmers and labourers
working remoter parts of Britain who were enlisted, trained
in sabotage, demolition & assassination, provided with arms
in underground dumps, and sent back to their day jobs. They
would have been activated should Axis forces have landed, and
would have formed the backbone of armed resistance should the
government surrender.

The other strand was a politicised group, similarly trained, who
would have gone into action should it look like the Halifax persuasion
was going to take power and sue for peace. They were to take out
key people and potential collaborators [such as Mosley]. Michael Foot
said that his first job would have been to kill Halifax.

A problem with empowering secret armies is that they sometimes get
ideas of their own.

This documentary is part of the story. Over the next few years
we should get much more of it.
