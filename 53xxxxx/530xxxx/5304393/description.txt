Paul McKenna's I can make you thin 6 disc dvd box set

Sorry to any one downloading my first post of this when I deleted it.
New to making and posting torrents and compressed it better this time so over half the size of old one. Quality is nearly as good as the old raw avi. also made it so you can download a single file and not have to get the whole rar file if you just want a part of it.
