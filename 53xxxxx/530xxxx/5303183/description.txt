Paul Evans visits the woods of England and Spain
that provided the timber - 3,700 trees, each possibly
over a hundred years old - for a 72 gun war ship.

In the Battle of Trafalgar, 27 of Nelson's ships
were pitched against 32 of the French and Spanish
coalition force. A lot of trees.

How were the trees chosen for ship building? What
carpentry went into making a 3000 ton wooden ship
with multiple decks and many masts? Paul Evans looks
into this complex form of naval engineering.
