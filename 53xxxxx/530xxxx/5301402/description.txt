Soul Ride is a single-player PC snowboarding game which emphasizes
purity, realism and extreme backcountry terrain.  The runs are drawn
from geological survey data of real-world mountains.  The action is
based on a meticulous simulation of snowboarding physics.  The
gameplay is straight out of the old-school arcade.  And every move
the player makes is recorded on a virtual VCR.
