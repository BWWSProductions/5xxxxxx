Dr Bell and Mr Doyle - The Dark Beginnings Of Sherlock Holmes: Following the â€˜deathâ€™ of Sherlock Holmes, Doyle finds himself reflecting on his old friendship with Doctor Joseph Bell, as well as his long-gone romance with fellow student Elspeth Scott, the victim of a killer he and Bell failed to capture.

Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes is a BBC television drama series originally broadcast in 2000 and 2001. It was inspired by the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based the character of Sherlock Holmes on his tutor at the University of Edinburgh Dr Joseph Bell, and that Bell did occasionally do forensic work for the Edinburgh police. The series exaggerated the similarity between Bell and Holmes for dramatic effect, with Doyle acting as Watson, and included several scenes from the books (the assumption being that these would later inspire Doyle's fiction).
