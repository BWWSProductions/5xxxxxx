A U.S. Navy captain and his crew are just beginning to enjoy 48 hours of leave when they receive word to immediately return to duty. On a top-secret assignment, they must disguise themselves as Nazis and infiltrate a severely damaged Nazi U-boat. Once on board, they are to steal the Naziâ€™s top-secret decoding device and sink the sub before the Germans catch on to whatâ€™s really happening. Their mission is more dangerous and frightening than anything they could have ever imagined, but one which has the power to turn the tide of battle.

â€œU-571 is exciting!â€ says Newsweek. Filled with incredible explosions, raging fires and speeding torpedoes, this suspense-filled, action-packed film sets a new standard for high-impact entertainment and features an impressive all-star cast.
