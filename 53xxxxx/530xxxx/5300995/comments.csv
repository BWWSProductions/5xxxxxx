anyway, thanks for the up."
,oyvind09,2010-01-23T08:35Z,Indeed you were the only one upping it. But you might as well not have bothered. Watching an episode 2 minutes at the time? Pointless and useless.

Cheers anyway mate, especially for making episode 8 available when no one else did, since those of us outside the U.S can't watch them on the website. Much appreciated."
