,nicehs,2010-03-02T10:09Z,"hm.. not all sure how this works, but.. Ive tried using this in all possible ways now I think. at best it increased the time I had left on the trial to 60 days somehow.. also after I did that I have to click a button when booting for Windows to load, some weird error :S am I doing something wrong then maybe? 2008 server

,krytenthesmug,2010-03-06T19:55Z,"Does not work with Windows server 2008 R2 Enterprise.  Just says ""No key available, enter one of your own if you have one"".  (!)"
,iamadonut,2010-03-22T20:18Z,"Works great with 2008 server standard. Haven't tried it with Enterprise yet. No real need to use Enterprise anyway unless you want to play with virtualization and even then - so what. Reading about it is just as good. Why create more than one pain in the ass at a time if you're just learning 2008 Server anyway. Otherwise, if you're trying to pirate 2008 server for a live business purpose: you're a fucking idiot, but I digress. 

Thanks for file, I am very happy!"

,vivatpb5776,2010-10-03T15:28Z,"Running Windows Server 2008 Enterprise Edition in VMWare. Attempted to run the .exe and the app stopped working. Tried twice with the same result. Cannot blame this on the app. Since this is for training purposes, I am just going to follow the steps with this url and bypass the activation.
