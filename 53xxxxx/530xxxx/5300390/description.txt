Product Description:
You ARE Samus with Wii control! By moving around with the Nunchuk and aiming Samus's gun with the Wii Remote, you'll do more than look through the eyes of Samusâ€”you'll experience a quantum leap in first-person control. Fire on the run, grapple enemies and yank off their shields, or manipulate machinery with movements of the Nunchuk and Wii Remoteâ€”it all adds up to a level of immersion only possible on the Nintendo Wii, and the best first-person controls on any platform, period. ** Corruption is everywhere... Dark Samus, Samus's longtime nemesis, is corrupting entire planets by launching enormous seeds called Leviathans into them. Samus must travel to multiple planetsâ€”each with unique alien landscapes and dangersâ€”to fight the corruption and track several other bounty hunters, all the while fighting the spreading Phazon that threatens to take over her body completely. As it corrupts her, it also grants her incredible powers... ** Enter Hypermode! Samus will employ a never-before-used device called a Phazon Enhancement Device (P.E.D) that harnesses the Phazon within her and puts her into a state called Hypermode. In Hypermode, Samus can destroy Phazon impediments and annihilate enemies with superpowered weapons...but it drains her health to use it, and she risks utter corruption if she doesn't empty her Phazon meter within a certain time frame. You'll need to carefully balance your need for ultimate power with the inherent danger of corruption.
