In Bob Rafelsonâ€™s STAY HUNGRY, trust fund baby Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) gets some lessons in life when he falls in love with a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Eschewing the dull path carved out for him by his wealthy southern family, the easy-going Craig teams up with an ambitious real estate developer in Birmingham, Alabama. In an attempt to wrest a piece of property away from its owner, Craig poses as a member of a seedy gym. But this rich boy soon finds himself taking a genuine fancy to the colorful collection of characters he meets thereâ€”in particular, bodybuilder Joe Santo (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his first major screen role), who is training for the Mr. Universe title, and spunky blue-collar babe Mary Tate (Sally Field), the gymâ€™s receptionist. The film, based on the novel by Charles Gaines, is lighthearted, unlike Rafelsonâ€™s austere earlier classics (FIVE EASY PIECES and KING OF MARVIN GARDENS) but deals with many of the same themes, such as dysfunctional families, restlessness, and rebellion.
