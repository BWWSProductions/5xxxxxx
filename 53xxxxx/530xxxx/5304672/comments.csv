,sistromo,2010-01-24T19:27Z,"It's just one of the many superstitions that people have entertained throughout history (and before.) Admittedly, it seems to be more intolerant and deleterious than most. Like the rest, however, it will become quaint, obsolete and ridiculous before entering a well-deserved oblivion. It's just a matter of time."
,hielo999,2010-01-24T21:18Z,"The religion of pieces.   Little bloody pieces.

Little bodies, blown up or cut up, into pieces.  All in the name of islam.  

Let them all burn in whatever hell they beleive in."
,kellys_eye,2010-01-25T01:11Z,"In the interest of fairness I have read the text.

The question *is there any factual basis* is not answered therefore I must assume that Islam doesn't have any factual basis - much like any other religion, so don't feel singled out.

If zakaat is so good why isn't it used to pay for your unemployed followers?  Man-made taxes, whilst 'burdensome' are abused by your unemployed followers yet you fail to discourage this?

*Islaam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil.*  Define 'evil'..... your own words state ""to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge"".  When did we last hear of Isalmic forgiveness?

Islam fobids superstition - errr, aren't ALL religions based on this, Islam included?

There is also a lengthy list of *don't do's* most of which are instinctive to civilised people and encompassed by most other religions anyway.

There are also lengthy, additional, rules for Islamic women to follow making them second-class citizens within their own religion.

Overall the text does NOT answer the questions *Why do Muslims think Islam is true* - it only pontificates what YOU believe are the 'good' points about Islam.

Whilst the 'decadent' and 'infidel' west (led primarily by the USA and other contributing nations) are scraping away the debris of Port au Prince, the notorious Muslim Bin Laden boasts of planning forthcoming terrorist attacks against us - probably the innocent public.

Tell me now - who are the civilised amongst us?"
,elrewesh782005,2010-01-27T21:21Z,"To All who hate islam and say that they are terrorists,
First islam forbidden  us to kill innocent people and who do that will go to hell
Second if muslim kills innocent people and make terrorist attacks that's doesn't mean that this is islam
Third America used Nuclear bombs to Kill innocent People in japan is that's mean that all Americans are too bad ?? "
