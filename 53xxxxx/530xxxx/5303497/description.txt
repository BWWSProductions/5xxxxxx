Saturday, 23 January 2010

[sebaygo1]





Tarpley talks about the possibility of an anti- Wall Street shift in Washington. Democrats looking for some economic populism windowdressing in the wake of the GOP victory in the MA Senate race. Bernanke's reappointment not looking so secure now. Obama might fire Geithner to achieve a similar symbolism.

Hour 1 ends with an update on the Icelandic debt situation.

Hour 2 begins with an appearance by Phil Berg, still persuing the Obama birth certification issue.

Later in the second hour, Webster talks about the public's attaction to populism during a depression, and expounds on the important differences between economic populism [real] and cultural populism [fake].

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
