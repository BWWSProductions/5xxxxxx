The full show, commercial free, can be downloaded at http://tarpley.net/world-crisis-radio/ make sure you use the ""download mp3 (right-click, select 'Save Link As?')"" link, and not of any of the other mp3 links on the page."

Thanks for the heads-up.

Are the files at Tarpley.net uploaded the same evening as the broadcast?

If you want the source from today's (20100130) show, there's a clean comm. free source at http://tarpley.net/world-crisis-radio/ that would be good for your next tarpley torrent. "
