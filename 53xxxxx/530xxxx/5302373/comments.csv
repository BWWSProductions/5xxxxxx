At first i couldn't get it to work. It complains that the name is not long enough or that the number is not long enough (note: you fabricate a name and fabricate a number). But then after i fed it the minimum characters, it generated a key! 

The program will ask for all three values to complete the registration.

I installed in win7/64bit. English localization was the default for me.

Installed in WinXP.
Key did not work first time around, had to keep generating until one worked.

But now for the Keygen, You have to set your computer clock back to 2009, Dont really know how far you got to go back but i just went back till march 1 2009 and it installed just fine. Restarted my computer and set my clock back up and to the real date and it seems to work just fine. Havent used it to much yet though cause i just installed it but so far so good. Thanks CORE and zurera for puttin this out there. "

Hope it helps"
