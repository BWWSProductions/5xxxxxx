No Gods, No Guilt is the audio version of Out of God's Closet read by the author himself. It is available in MP3 format. 

In this exciting book, Out of God's Closet, a former faithful Roman Catholic priest-become-psychologist shares his inviting journey through agnosticism to atheism and The 21st Century Golden Rule. Dr. Uhl's Journey was quite unique. Yet he clearly shows most of us how to get free and drop childhood prejudices and myths. This can deeply enrich individuals and families throughout our pluralistic society.
