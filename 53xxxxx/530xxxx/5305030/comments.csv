,WestHustle,2010-01-24T19:53Z,sorry my ignorance but how do i seed?! im new here!!
,MoonDookie,2010-01-25T04:41Z,"@WestHustle
seed:
    A computer that has a complete copy of a certain torrent. Once your client finishes downloading, it will remain open until you click the Finish button (or otherwise close it.) This is known as being a seed or seeding. You can also start a BT client with a complete file, and once BT has checked the file it will connect and seed the file to others. Generally, it's considered good manners to continue seeding a file after you have finished downloading, to help out others. Also, when a new torrent is posted to a tracker, someone must seed it in order for it to be available to others. Remember, the tracker doesn't know anything of the actual contents of a file, so it's important to follow through and seed a file if you upload the torrent to a tracker."

and replace your existing one, restart then open hosts and check it has saved/copied over correctly. other hosts fixes;

Next I ran the installation the way you say to in the instructions and it still kept asking for a new cd key/ licence thingy. I then uninstalled it again and did the clean install thing, deleting all adobe programs on my computer. 

I'm now trying to install it again but when I attempt to, a message appears saying:

i do have a minor issue though, and im not sure if its the program or something to do with my computer.

i did everything in the directions, and PS opens just fine - no issues. although when its open and im working on something, the selection tool and some other tools are erratic. like if im using the polygonal lasso tool, and i click on a certain part of the canvas, it will randomly select another area. also when i hit EDIT on the top toolbar, the box that comes down with the possible selections is off center and to the right. i can take a screenshot if you need to see it.

just wondering if you had a solution to this. is it my screen size? thank you! xoxo"

There is a virus in keygen, but I do not think it is very harmful. I did not run 'Activator.exe' because I was not able to find it. However it works with a serialnumber. Be very careful to follow the instruction and I recomend to turn of internet connection during the installation. And of course, DO NOT REGISTER!

,ishis,2010-02-24T02:27Z,"


When at first you don?t succeed:

I have 3 computers and an older Compaq Presario R4000 running Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit is the one I use to test installations. 

My first attempt was unsuccessful...I was left with several nagging questions about why the install was not successful?all of which related to my limited understanding of what I am doing. 

Since my Compaq was still in one piece after completing the install I decided to address some of those doubts by attempting to install this program on my main desktop running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. I mention the bit program because one of those doubts was noticing that it was the Windows 64 bit driver that installs when you update ?cameraraw5? from the supplied update files which I  didn?t think should be happening on a 32 bit OS. 

I also realized that no matter how careful someone may be in writing out the steps to be followed sometimes it is invariable that what is a simple understanding to that person may not be shared by the person following those steps. A case in point would be Step 5 pt 2: Go to C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc and open the ""hosts"" file with notepad and check it matches the above, if not correct it. 

I believe I would have understood this step better had it read: Go to C:\windows\notepad and open notepad with Run as administrator and then in Notepad go to File?Open? and navigate to C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc. Then in the bottom right hand corner of Notepad change Text documents (*.txt) to All Files and then click on hosts and then Open. If the text does not look the same copy and paste the text from my example to the hosts file and then close Notepad saving the changes. 

In STEP 6 you are asked to: 1) Copy the AdobeLM.dll file from this folder. For the record I changed the capital A to a small a so as it would mirror how this file looked in the 3 folders you are asked to put it in. Perhaps it doesn?t make any difference but it is often the little things that cause the big problems?

When I turned the Internet back on and opened CS4 I was not asked to Register as I understand Register. I was asked if I wanted a 30 day trial or if I had a Serial Number to enter it now. 
The first time I simply continued without entering a Serial Number when I followed instructions and went to EDIT,PREFRENCES,GENERAL the AUTO UPDATE BOX was already unchecked. The second time I opened up CS4 I was again presented with the 30 day trial or Serial Number option. This time I entered a Serial Number which was accepted. The third time I opened up CS4 it opened directly.

When at first you don?t succeed?
I now have this on all three of my computers :)

Genuine thanks to the Uploader 

works perfectly! "

,BOMM2,2010-02-24T10:13Z,"@ jirahna-mo and others having trouble with the HOSTS file:

To save a file without .txt or .doc extension from notepad, put it in "" "" quotes. That is, save the the hosts file as ""hosts""

If you have tightened the security settings in Windows 7 and run DEP ? Data Execution Prevention for all services, then you cannot see or alter important system files i the System32 folder. In that case, log on with administrative priviligies, have Windows search in hidden folders, search for hosts, when found in the search window copy the file to your documents folder, alter it following the instructions from thethingy, then copy it back to it's original location and confirm overwrite of the original file.

,Marjul_21,2010-02-26T00:18Z,"HELP: 

I uninstalled the CS4 since the first time I ran it i did all the wrong things in installing it like:

* not knowing how to run as administrator (i simply thought that since im using the the administrator setting, i can do whatever i want like with xp coz its my first time using win7)

*installed in custom location. (yep, ive read the notes above but i forgot and i was rushing so i unconsciously did what i usally do and installed it in a different location.) it worked properly (or so i thought...), asked for serial, registration and etc., but i didn't know how to edit the registry at first so i didn't continue anymore and tried deleting it.


* I tried installing  windows installer clean-up but didn't know how to at first. ended up aborting it coz it wont run after i tried cleaning up all the program that was installed with CS4.


*tried rmoving the program physically, since it wouldn't appear in both the add/remove program list.


*tried reinstalling correctly (run as admin) after, restart, but errors occured, it seems that air & cs4 wont install (it says error) but is now appearing in add/remove programs selection. So I tried uninstalling after a proper windows clean-up first (since it wont appear if i uninstall first (ive done install/uninstall many times just to remove the program so im sure it happens)but this message appeared:


Done,  some problems occured while component is being removed. Please see below.
(but there was no details/list)

finally, It won't disappear from add/remove even if i restart the pc. i even tried system restore but its still simply there.

I really need help. if i can't install the program id rather remove it cleanly/completely from my system. but i would be really happy if i can install it coz i really need it..."

Done another attempt to uninstall following your directions in the Adobe Install and licence toolkit, but after using the windows cleanup tool and running both scripts, (also made sure hosts file was corrected before doing so) the program is still on my computer. The entire PSCS4 folder is still in program files and it's also still in my startup menu.

I followed the instructions EXACTLY, including DCing from the internet.

After taking forever to install, it says something like ""Install done, with errors"" and I don't know why. Paying no mind, I tried installing the updates and all of their installations failed. Finally, I opened all of the programs from the installation I could to see what was going on, and Photoshop was the only one that threw an error. It said something like ""File in application folder missing, please reinstall"" or some-such nonsense like that.

This has happened with every Photoshop torrent I have tried to install (two, to be exact :P), so I'm assuming it's a problem with my computer rather than the torrents I'm downloading.

,starlitewishes11,2010-03-14T02:36Z,"thethingy,

I too have been having the 130:3 error saying licensing for the product has stopped working. It only happens when I try to open Photoshop Cs4 64bit, the 32bit works just fine but I'd rather use the 64 if I can get it to work.

From reading some of the other comments/responses, it seems that the reason this occurs is because of a problem with the host file....when I was going through the whole process, when it got to the point where you were supposed to open the host file and compare it to the one in the instructions, they were NOT the same, but when i tried to make the changes to it so it would match, the comp. told me I didnt have permission to save that file. I saved it under a separate name on my desktop, but the original file remained the same.  Also, later when we are supposed to re-open the host file and copy the last line from it into our own copy, it looked the same as it had in the previous steps, no new lines at all.  I tried copying the last line ""adobe.activate.com"" from your instructions into my saved copy of the host file, but I'm guessing that didnt really solve anything because I am still getting the error msg.

New to torrenting programs, been mainly a movie-downloader but I need PS for my class, so I am trying to fumble my way around getting this program from you! :)

Any suggestions on how to repair this problem without redoing the whole process, or am I stuck using 32-bit?"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-14T05:53Z,"if ou read back in the commentsof this torrent the 64bit hosts has to be saved and accessed in a perticular way, via explorer address bar, once set do the error 130.3 steps in the toolkit and it will work"

does the fact that my program files folder in C: is split into two (program files AND program files (x86) have anything to do with it? i just treated them as one, adding the adobe.dll file into all applications, independant of which of the two folders the app was in.

Now I'm getting that horrible message ""setup has encountered an error and cannot continue...""After that, I used the ""Adobe CS4 Clean Script"" but it didn't fix the problem, Then I used Your ""Reset Registry"" torrent, and I'm still getting that horrible message...

,tripplesix,2010-04-22T23:00Z,"omigosh, there are too many comments to go thru all to see if my question has been already asked.

Greetings, thethingy.

I installed your Premiere Pro CS4 yesterday.  Now I want to install your Photoshop CS4.  Am I going to run into problems because there are some shared applictions in both of them (i.e., Adobe Air, Adobe Media Player).  Before I installed Premiere Pro CS4, i ran into problems b/c my computer already had Adobe AIR on it.  It had installed everything else and then said there were problems installing AIR (and i knew the reason was b/c it was already on there).  Is this going to present another problem for me??  Additionally, will this present any problem when I also install your After Effects, Flash, Illustrator and Soundbooth (each CS4)???"
[V],thethingy,2010-04-23T15:47Z,"tripplesix, you can install all of my adobe apps together with no problems, you just skip the hosts file steps as you have already done that and any apps like air that are already installed wont install. 

if you like all of them the master collection has them all;
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5287986"
,tripplesix,2010-04-24T00:26Z,"Thank you very much for your quick reply.  I thought about using the master collection but there are just too many apps in it and my main activities only involve audio and video.  So i'll just stick with these 5.
Thanks a lot for your help.  I will leave comments after installation of each."
,etindle62,2010-04-24T01:29Z,"hey, I'm having the same problem as a couple other people.  On page four, somebody had a problem with the instillation getting about 90% done and it would stop and give the message 

""Setup has encountered an error and cannot continue. Contact adobe customer support for assistance.""  

I'm getting the same problem.  Microsoft office isn't working, just like their.  I looked for an ms tool like that one guy said and couldn't find anything that worked.  I tried to set permissions back to default, system restore, and cc cleaner and nothing helped.  The only thing I did after the system restore was modify the hosts file.

Any suggestions from anyone would be greatly appreciated!"
,tripplesix,2010-04-24T18:58Z,"This was a great torrent.  Installed flawlessly... and opens (although I haven't actually used it yet) on Windows 7 64-bit.

I was curious about one thing though.  I downloaded 6 of your CS4 applications and all the other 5 installed in Program Files x86; but only Photoshop went into regular old Program Files.  I'm not worried about it; I'm just curious as to why that happened.

Nonetheless, THANKS thethingy!"
[V],thethingy,2010-04-24T19:52Z,photoshop is 32&64bit and on 64bit it will install both versions (for some bizzare reason) unless you chose specificly at the first setup to only install one

One thing I would like to add is for those who have problems saving the HOSTS file in win 7, try to change the security settings for the file itself by

right-clicking on the host file, 
selecting the security tab, 
click on advanced,
press change permission,
highlight the user you are currently logged on,
edit and check allow for full control

This should let you save the file with no problem.

But yea, I found the solution by reading about 10 pages of comments because every question that needs an answer is already answered, if not at least a million times,

No virus issues found (kaspersky) just a ton of ""do you trust this program"" etc etc... but no serious issues....

Word of advice if your antivirus detected a virus. It's what is known as a false positive. Ex: a program that is meant to act like a virus to generate keys, patch a file, etc. It IS NOT harmfull in any way. Hope that clears some things up. On a side note I didn't have to edit the hosts file to get things to work properly. I just went to RUN => msconfig and made sure nothing involving adobe photoshop etc started up with windows and made sure the program doesn't auto update or connect to adobe's websites.
