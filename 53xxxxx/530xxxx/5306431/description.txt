A SPECIAL THANK YOU
This is a book of truth and the value of truth is only realized by intellect after controversy. Many people have contributed to what is on the following pages. As stated in the dedication, I take no responsibility for its authorship. Part of what is written herein can be found in other volumes written or channeled by great men and women such as G. Patrick Flanagan, author of PYRAMID POWER and BEYOND PYRAMID POWER, Rita Gorman of the American Lung Association and many other authors whose works are found in articles such as Scientific American. Time Life Libraries and Encyclopedia Brittanica.

If it be desirous of you, dear readers, to explore individual avenues of the great cities presented in the bibliography, use it wisely TOT your enjoyment. The Kirlian Photography section of this book delves into the works of great pioneers such as Thelma Moss of UCLA, Dr. Lawrence Kennedy, Brooks Marshall and others.
Much of the Theosophical works were brought to light in earlier works published by the Theosophical Publishing House, who hosted such authors as Annie Besanc. C. W. Leadbetter and Madame Blavatsky. Another great contributor was Corinne Heline of the New Age Press now called Rondore.

I am just a channel for knowledge and truth and I have to deal with my own ego continually to keep my human nature curtailed by only seeking the divine nature in all I am privileged to share time with. In this the third publication, you will find new chapters and a conclusion not present in earlier volumes.
DEATH OF IGNORANCE was meant to destroy ignorance. I am sure that to all of the people that contributed to its creation, truth served as a bottom line for their motives.

Our next book is in the works. BIRTH. A NEW BE-GINNING. I can only say that it is all inclusive material of the past, present, and future with the goal to resurrect truth, after the death of ignorance.
 
Dedication
This is a book of life. Few people will ever know what it took to cover the following pages. I take no credit for its authorÂ¬ship. I was only an instrument for God to work through, as were the others around me. It is dedicated to Alan and Nancy, my closest friends and greatest teachers in learning the value of relationships.

Alan departed before its completion to assist from the other side. Bob and Laune gave me courage to finish after Alan left. Betty Lee Morales was a tremendous inspiration. Louise and Bruce completed the first printing.
The book would have never even been started if I had not met my wife Kim. The glorious times we had together, me working on the manuscript. her typing it and doing much of the artwork reaffirmed the wondrous marvels of God uniting two people with a common goal to serve mankind.

When Kim finished her pan which was even greater than mine, she left for a while. She gave so much, dear readers, to you that there was nothing left for herself. In dosing, you will find our love for you in every word, every drawing, and most of all everywhere. May God Bless.

For those searching for identity, "The Death of Ignorance.*' a new book by Fred Bell. PH. D.. unfolds man's spatial relation-ship from primal energy, to the stars and planets, to his personal pathway, through immortality. "The Death of Ignorance" is the most fascinating, illuminating reading I've discovered in 20 years! In language which is scientifically invulnerable, vividly descriptive (with lots of illustrations) Dr. Bell has succeeded in synthesizing knowledge of the ancients in all of the disciplines with space-age technology, with common sense and unmatched brilliance of undertaking.

For professionals and laymen alike. "The Death of Ignorance" brings into focus science, physics and metaphysics in a gripping style and lucidity. It's a book which appeals to youth - and to minds of all ages which Have retained the curiosity and daring of youth. It's an adventure into Tâ€”Iâ€”Mâ€”E. past, present and future: it's the type of unique insight which has shaped man's destiny.
