this is a MOD map from the FEG clan in Germany for Frontlines fuel of war.
it is a Solar Farm MOD.

this should include both the mod solar farm map files and the original solar farm map files (in case you loose or screw one up)

steps:
go to

program files/ THQ / Frontlines-Fuel of War / GCGAME / CookedPC / Maps / MP
                  to find map files.

-copy original Solar farm Map file and save it somewhere safe. (you will need it to replace it after it is deleted)

- delete original solar farm map file
- place this new solar farm map file (modded) in the same position

when you are done and want to play original solarfarm you will need to delete the mod solar farm file and replace it with the original.
so save a good copy of both in a safe spot.
there may be an easier way, this is just how i have been doing it successfully
