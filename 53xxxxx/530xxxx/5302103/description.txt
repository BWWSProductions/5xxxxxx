"In the winter of 1990 Morthond was created as a one-man project of Benny Nilsen. The idea was to make visual music without any moving pictures with coincidence as a main inspiration." (from "Karmanik Collection") 
In 1992 the name "Morthond" was changed to "Morthound"; the first release under the new name was "Spindrift". 
Morthound was disbanded in 1996 and Nilsen started out with his new project Hazard.
