Thanks for downloading my digital CD with my biggest failures, 
feel free to tell me where i went wrong with what song by sending
my an email to Dj_entertainer@msn.com.

Not all the songs are from my new thinking so some of them really suck 
but ill make re-edits as soon as you tell me which need it the most.

Now for you remixer haters out there i just wanna say that the reason i remixed 
some of these songs was not to get money or fame but because i didnt like something 
in the song and felt like i could change it

If anyone is going to remix my own songs (not my remixes) please ask me first by sending a mail 
to Dj_entertainer@msn.com or mychannel
if you take the time to ask then ill send you the Midi and FLP file


I would like to give a special thanks to:

Kev Willow
Basshunter
Dj Webster
Back In Full Force
Gothman
Dj Rosaly
Dj Krista
Armin Van Burren

And to anyone else ive forgotten....

Enjoy and laugh away....
