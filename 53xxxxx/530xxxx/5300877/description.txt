Here is a fix for the disconnected error when using version 1.0.175v2 in Modern Warfare 2 online. Copy iw4mp.exe to your mw2 folder (if using zero gear method, should be located at C:/Program Files Steam steamapps common zero gear Server).
You should now be able to join all cracked servers, and when you get to the lobby you will not get the "disconnected from steam" error. Enjoy!
