Tensions come to a head when Simon Trask's (the brother of the original Sentinels' creator, Bolivar Trask) anti-mutant group called Humanity Now, marches through San Francisco.  On the way to City Hall, they are stopped by several members of the X-Men and riots begin to break out.  As the X-Men try to quell the fighting all over San Francisco, Norman Osborn shows up.  Osborn's aim is to enforce peace by creating his own team of Dark X-Men to serve in much the same way the Dark Avengers did, and using both his teams to bring down the real X-Men.

Written by Matt Fraction with Brian Michael Bendis consulting.
