Also answer to your previously asked question about the second audio track (the annoying voice describing everything on screen), run it through Any Video Converter Pro and adjust the audio bit-rate slightly up or down and that will wipe of the second track."

Really looks 1080p! Dont let the 1920x800 res fool u, thats just the black cropped out from the bottom and top.

The subtites for the non-english link dont work though :("
