Batman: Child of Dreams is a manga series written and illustrated by Kia Asamiya, published in Kodansha's Magazine Z.  The English language version was released as a graphic novel in hardcover and softcover editions in 2003 by DC Comics.  Because of the way that manga is published in Japan, reading from right to left, which is now commonplace in modern translated manga releases, Child of Dreams was "flipped," which might have gone unnoticed had it not made Two-Face scarred on the right side of his body.

The series follows Batman as he travels to Tokyo on the trail of a lethal drug that allows the person who ingests it to shapeshift into anyone they desire.
