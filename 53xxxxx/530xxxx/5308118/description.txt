Wake Up Your Creative Genius


Being creative means dealing in ideas. The world runs on ideas. Good things rarely 
happen accidentally. Long before electric lights or television or heart surgery or 
even the wheel came to be, they existed as thoughts in somebody's mind.

When ideas are first formed, they are often considered to be of little importance. 
("And what will you do once you're up in the air, Mr. Wright? A waste of time!") But as years pass and an idea begins to be accepted, it can change our lives. Sometimes it changes the very foundation of our society.

Where do good ideas come from? You're probably not a mad genius working in a laboratory, churning out miracle drugs and magic potions for a living. But that doesn't matter. Many of the extraordinary inventions we use in our world today came from quite ordinary people.And those same ordinary people can get good ideas to improve their financial situation, their relationships with others, their circumstances at work and home, and countless other things. Ideas can come to anyone who's willing to seek them out.
