Any ideas how I can make this work (bedides buying a licence ;-)) Thx in advance

,rtfarty,2011-01-20T08:39Z,thanks for the download but can't get past the activation stage as previous downloader says...requires serial number...pls help !!
,rtfarty,2011-01-20T08:41Z,as previously said...requires serial number ?!
,blackdon,2011-04-06T18:30Z,Guys I just downloaded it. It works fine. Read the instructions before you comment. After installing the program do not launch it. Read the notes attached to the download first. Follow the instructions and your up and running. And as with all downloads - make sure you're disconnected from the internet whilst installing. 
,Fireozzy,2011-04-14T20:10Z,This is a fantastic torrent - works a treat. Any chance someone could do the latest version (Imindmap 5)? It'd be really appreciated :)
