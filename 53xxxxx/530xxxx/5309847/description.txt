BBC R4 - Ronnie Barker's 'Mum'
Adapted by Neil Cargill
Directed by Neil Cargill
Broadcast September 29, 2006
Coded from a digital source at 128/44.1

Solitary woman whose only confidant is her
dead mother is confronted by the shades of
her dead father and brother.

Adapted from a play staged in 1998 at the King's
Head, Islington. It featured Ronnie Barker's
daughter. To avoid the charge of nepotism the
play was originally credited to Richard Mervyn.

Something of a departure for Ronnie Barker,
better known for his double act with Ronnie
Corbett, and old lag Fletcher in 'Porridge'.
