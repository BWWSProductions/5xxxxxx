,BG174,2010-01-26T21:43Z,"Natz122, are you seeding?  I've been trying to download the torrent for a day or so, and I'm stuck at 2.2%.  uTorrent shows 77 leechers and 1 seeder, with 0.022 available.  

I loved episode 10, and I'm dying to see where the story goes from there.  Everyone who can, please seed!  

Thanks."
