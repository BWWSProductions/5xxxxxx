,hammeline,2010-01-26T10:42Z,Thank you very much for this great rip! But Vol. 17 ist missing. Isn't?
,Anon_I_Mouse,2010-01-29T00:37Z,"I didn't forget to do it, for some reason I just can't (?) do it; I've been trying for a week. Whenever I try to upload I get either done (showing a blank page), wrong Capcha code (when it obviously isn't) or Error 404 - page not found.

I've tried remaking the torrent, two different browsers, clearing all cookies, rebooting, with VPN on and off and from different IPs (UK, NL & USA). This is driving me round the bend. If anybody's got any suggestions I'd be glad to hear them. "

About vol. 17 maybe this is not the case but TPB gives strange errors when there are more than 200 files  in a torrent. Anyway, Maybe you could upload vol 17 on another site and if that solution works you could post here only ""the torrent with the torrent"" (see http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5333274/DCP_and_Minutemen_Week_of_27-01-10_-_Complete for an example)"
