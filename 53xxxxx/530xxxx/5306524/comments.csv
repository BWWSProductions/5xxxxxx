Please..."

Crazy, crazy nights"
[V],2nafish,2010-01-27T08:18Z,"Unfortunately I don't have ""Crazy Crazy Nights"" without the logos or titles. If I ever get it I will upload it for you. "
,kvestantin,2010-01-27T09:37Z,"2nafish! Can you please tell, do you have 3 videos of Kiss which you have uploaded lately (""Reason To Live"", ""Turn On The Night"", ""Rock Hard"") in even better quality? The original source from which you were making your rips?

The quality of your rips is good of course, but I'm looking for these videos in full DVD quality (video bitrate 6000-8000 Kbps instead of your 3000-4000 Kbps) - that's for my Monster Videography of Kiss... "
