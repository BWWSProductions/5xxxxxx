Xpand Rally Xtreme is a rally racing game that outstands for its incredible speed and its graphic engine, which is able to recreate quite beautiful landscapes.

You'll be able to race in two different tracks, both in arcade and simulation modes. The first one, Malaysia, brings you the opportunity to test your driving skills over asphalt and gravel while racing and jumping across groves.

The second one, Italy, offers a highly technical, quite large track, featuring narrow paths and multiple curves that will require all of your concentration and a very careful driving style. Just one little mistake and you'll be off the road.
