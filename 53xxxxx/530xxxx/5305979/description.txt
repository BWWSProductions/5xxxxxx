From Jon:

Some of you may remember that in September 2003, I finished and distributed an 18 disc set of live Joe Jackson material. Since then, I've improved my "studio" quite a bit and also have unearthed a few more recordings. There's also been two more tours.

I was recently listening to those discs and decided they don't really sound all that great. So I decided to "remaster" all of them and recreate some of them. I think they sound much better. And they are more complete.

As to why I ever did this:

1. I love raw live recordings.
2. I wanted just one disc from every tour instead of 10 of each in which the difference between the discs was one song.
3. My fanship of JJ is based largely on his constant innovation and reinterpretation of his own (and others) music. This set reflects that.

With special thanks to Jeff, Bjoern, John N., Gert, Maura, Carol, Bladerunner and especially Phillip (hope I didn't forget anyone), I was able to accumulate enough different shows from every tour that I think I had at least one version of every song played.

From there, I took the best sounding version of each song and created a master list. From the master list, I took as many songs as I could fit on an 80 minute disc, in order of songs I most wanted to have from each tour. Then, using Sound Forge, I blended all of the songs together so that they sound like one show with no breaks of silence, and remastered each song as
best as I could (not everything was salvageable - like "Moonlight" from 1983 - but I put it on anyway because I like the song so much) and balanced the sound levels.

I hope you will find it all worth it. It took me about two months to complete the original set and a month to complete this one, but I am very happy with the finished product. Now if only the record companies could have done this for me...

As always, these are not for sale - either by me or anyone who receives one. These are strictly for trade and personal enjoyment. I do not take it for granted the legal questions surrounding this and ask that everyone be respectful of JJ and his management and thankful that they allowed me to share this the first time (and presumably this time, as well).
