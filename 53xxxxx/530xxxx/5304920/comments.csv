[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-05T18:30Z,"Notorious upload and (Anonymous)uploader.
In 40 days the highest % is still at 15%.

Why don't you guys set high priority to the first episode ( Planet Erde - 01 - Von Pol zu Pol ) so we can see in about 48 hours if it is genuine.

I usually avoid torrents uploaded by Anonymous, it might have been a mistake to go for this one. will see.

[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-05T18:40Z,"If in 40 days was uploaded 15-16% then the whole alot will be downloaded in 200 days more(over 6 months! from now on). 
Think about it! Isn't it ridiculous!? "
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-05T18:48Z,"The uploader uploads about 350 MB per day, and he pauses the torrent most of the time!
I'm pretty sure he ""takes the piss out of us""."

,mehrum,2011-06-16T15:43Z,"Cmon, can't be I upload faster than I download!"
,mehrum,2011-08-26T17:04Z,"Superbe quality, perfect clear sound and breathtaking shots. German and english speaker are good, it even brings subtitle along.

It runs from my USB stick plugged in into my Samsung TV UE32C6710.

Yes I know, it takes a long time to download, that's why I'm seeding as much as I can but 100GB are not a piece of cake."
