Four hundred years ago, in the face of fierce opposition
from the NIMBY persuasion, William Shakespeare opened his
Blackfriars Theatre. This theatre's design was a radical
departure from those that had gone before - the purpose
built playhouse was enclosed within a building.

This concept transformed theatre - for audiences, producers,
playwrights, and investors.

This programme examines some of these changes.
