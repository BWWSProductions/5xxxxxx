Synopsis:
This is a story of six decades, three countries and statelessness. A story about the urdu-speaking community of Bangladesh. Filmed in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, the documentary examines one tragic aspect of the legacy of the partition of India.

The terms "urdu-speakers" and the more loaded "biharis" are used to refer to muslim people who originally emigrated from India to the newly created East Pakistan in 1947 and afterwards. Many of them, but by no means all, originated from the state of Bihar and were fleeing large scale communal massacres.

Three decades later, during the struggle for independence in Bangladesh in 1971, this community became embroiled in conflict. Isolated as collaborators against Bangladeshi independence, this moment was a defining one for the urdu-speakers and has had a devastating legacy.

This is a story about the 160,000 people from this community who live isolated in 116 "camps" or "settlements" in Bangladesh.
