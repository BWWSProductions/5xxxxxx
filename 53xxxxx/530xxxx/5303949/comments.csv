   It appears so!
Try a thank you...


'Cause I know how many of you HAVE downloaded this despite the fact that you have  never bothered to upload anything for yourselves...


I suggest you look up the meaning of reciprocation...


Do you really think I am here to pleasure twats like you?"

Ella is a true icon and I appreciate you uploading this gem. Keep up the great work and forget the ungrateful people out there. I appreciate you :)"

,neshaminy,2010-02-20T01:23Z,Very sincere thanks for this extraordinary set.  I notice the biggest complaints on Amazon are about the packaging and lack of availability in some countries.  Please accept my appreciation to you for solving both issues with elegance...  :-)
,ajb500,2010-03-04T09:38Z,Fantastic performace and great recordings. Many thanks as I was not able to purchase it from amazon because the postage was so expensive seeing as I live in Morocco. Once again many thanks for making it available to me. AJB.

Thank you so much princess"

I think you'll find that ""deer"" is correctly spelt ""dear"".   
And there should also be a comma before the direct address ""little deer""(sic).
And there should also be a comma before the direct address ""princess"".
Oh, and there should also be a comma after the interjection ""oh"" as in the  bizarre syntax you chose to use for that particular sentence.
And I think you'll also find the word you were seeking was ""precocious"" and not ""precious"".

Not a bad effort, though.   Unlike your non-existent uploads.


Anything else?    Or shall I just block your IP address from my computer.   That way, you won't ever have to download from me ever again anything else that you can't be bothered to come in and say thank you for without having to be reminded.   Understand? "
