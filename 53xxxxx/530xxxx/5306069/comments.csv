Word's search doesn't give me a simple list of all the instances a word occurs in the document. It only highlights them one at a time. It can be a real pain when I look for a phrase with the word I need, and I get 400 results. I need to click Alt + F 400 times. With the PowerGREP you've given me,I get the list I want, and it helps me work immeasurably faster. Thank you a million. And thanks for the work you did to make it virus-free. It installs and works wonderfully."
