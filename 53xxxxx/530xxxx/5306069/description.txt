This torrent is a ***CLEAN RE-POST*** of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4347444/JGSoft_PowerGrep_3, which contained a malicious rootkit.  I extracted the *ACTUAL* setup program from the wrapper executable, so this version should be (and is, to the best of my knowledge) CLEAN and VIRUS-FREE.

My computer became infected after running the original setup program, and it literally took 51 different virus/malware scanners and utilities to finally track the nasty little son-of-a-bitch down.  NONE of the major programs caught it.  The one tool that finally found and removed it was Hitman Pro 3.5, a program I HIGHLY recommend if you have a rootkit that evades detection by all other programs.

The original .exe *looks* like a setup program for PowerGREP 3, but it's not - it's a wrapper executable that contains the actual setup program as well as a number of virus files.  When executed, the virus installs rootkits in various places across the system, including the %TEMP% directory and the %WINDOWS%/System32/DRIVERS directory.

The rootkit then downloads additional virus files from malicious servers in France and Germany.  One of the many programs it installed was the infamous "Internet Security 2010" virus.  Joy.

I set up a VMware Virtual Machine running Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 and installed a number of free virus/malware scanners to try and catch the rootkit.  I then ran the infected setup program to learn how it works.  Here are some screenshots:

The good news is that the infected .exe extracts the *real* setup program to the %TEMP% directory, so I was able to copy it and run it independently to verify that it wasn't also infected.  I noticed that the extracted setup program contains a valid digital signature (security certificate), but the wrapper executable doesn't.

Anyway, I hope someone finds this useful.  Please let me know in the comments if you have any questions about this bad boy.
