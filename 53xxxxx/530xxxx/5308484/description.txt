Here are the songs best reflecting the career of Mr. Vic Damone
The "stranger in Paradise rendition here is the Broadway offering 
from Pocket songs rather than their "Judy Garland" version which 
has a varied pace from this original (although we have used that version 
before I must admit). Pocket songs offerings usually come in with 
great quality in any event. The "Legends brand" rendition in particular
was quite poor indeed we found for this particular song although they 
too have some great quality in their offerings too.


Our new lineup of Karaoke will soon be available and will be revamped
and even more comprehensive in the range of song selections, indeed!
