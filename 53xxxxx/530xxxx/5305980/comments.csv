,githugt,2010-02-03T12:10Z,"The Download in itself works, as of now-Its Installing-around 75%complete now..

I din't get the BLOCK part.
are we supposed to Block CS3 from Updating itself????"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-05T07:41Z,"@githugt
Adobe updater should search for it automatically (once CS3 is fully installed, reboot may be required), or search for updates after.
When it finds, download them, install, then block CS3 from updating again.
Enjoy:)"
,bobo99999999,2010-02-08T18:13Z,It works.  How do I block CS3 from updating again?  Thanks!

@thimage you can choose any apps prior to install or choose all then install.

,zjener,2010-02-26T19:59Z,"download great ...install great...everything works fine...BUT?! ...

Every time I start up my system (XP) there is ""Adobe Updater"". I have disabled it like you said grimreaper420....but still...?

What to do? "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-01T04:09Z,"@zjener at first don't disable ""Adobe Updater"" let it find the updates, download, and install them.
Once done block ""Adobe Updater"" through your firewall...if you see a few more updates in the future, unblock, and install them, then re-block.
Enjoy my friend:)"
,zjener,2010-03-03T11:57Z,"thank you for everything grimreaper420...

2. Mount cs3 with daemon tools

3. activate it by ""phone"" use the key gen to get the phone code by using the product code.

[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-18T19:11Z,don't post serials here adobe will just blacklist them
,ConstantFailure,2010-03-21T16:35Z,"Oh. My. God. This pisses me off!

I'm not good at all with computers, but I finally managed to start the installation. Now there's a tiny problem: 
None of the components, except for ""Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional"", will install. I've tried like five times now and it won't work!
Help?"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-21T18:25Z,"nice username ConstantFailure maybe you jinxed urself?  you didn't say if you burned or mounted it...try removing CS3 Master from your computer, reboot, and re-install ok"
,Chappy5th,2010-04-07T18:20Z,"I'm seeding, and downloading at about 256k right now, so not too bad. Will leave another comment on if it works or not."
,Chappy5th,2010-04-07T20:10Z,Comes up with an error saying that the installer is corrupted. I'll look into trying another DVD-R.
,Chappy5th,2010-04-07T21:03Z,Doesn't work for me at all. Tried 4 different DVD-R's and DVD+R's.
[T],grimreaper420,2010-04-08T01:31Z,chappy can i ask at what speed you're burning these DVD's at?
[T],grimreaper420,2010-04-08T01:58Z,"all i can suggest is to burn them at the slowest speeds if you're not doing that, installer corruption is a sign that you burned the ISO image too fast.
gotta go not sure if ill be back later...good luck:)"
,Lagavulin_B,2010-04-21T19:51Z,Virus alert
,soregrin,2010-04-29T00:02Z,it has a fuckin virus on the keygen!
,Davaidh,2010-05-04T09:46Z,"It all works perfectly, if you are knowledgable enough to follow the instructions! Thank you.
(and comments like 'its got a virus in the keygen' are beyond belief! Idiots shouldn't try this at home....."
,BuckSida,2010-05-12T05:16Z,"Hi Grim, Thanx for a *great* download package and instructions. I hope you can help with a problem. I burned an install dvd (4X speed and verified) and it loaded fine. First key worked great and it appeared to do a normal install (I didn't load all the programs, just Acrobat, DW, PS, ID, Illustrator). 

Got a string of error messages at the end showing that only Acrobat loaded. Tried to run Acrobat but got a message saying another CS3 component must be run before Acrobat will work. Well no others loaded so that was out.

Rebooted and tried to repair install from Control Panel but got kicked out because ""Creative Suite Master Collection is not loaded"" (you can see this in the error screen shot below). So restarted and went from DVD again. It looked like everything was working...took long as hell (as usual) but all errors.

I'm in the Grim Reaper's hands now. (-;  Thank you for helping starving artists!"
,BuckSida,2010-05-12T05:58Z,"Still hacking around. Acrobat and DW will open perfectly...until the error pops up ""Licensing for the product has stopped working - You cannot use the product at this time. You must repair the problem by uninstalling and then reinstalling this product or contacting your IT supervisor."" Yikes."
,BuckSida,2010-05-12T17:25Z,"Final update. Did complete uninstall for 3rd time. This time, rather than put in keygen serial at beginning I tried to install ""As trial version"" planning to activate with this or another CS3 keygen.

Didn't get that far. This version is simply not installing the main CS3 Master Collection component or fonts. Probably not an error by Grim, since this obviously worked before. Perhaps Adobe did something?  "
,BZERKON3,2010-05-25T22:01Z,LOL works fine idk why the keygen got flagged by some peoples AV i use ESET SS not shyt avg ty grim.....i didn't burn it to dvd just mounted with deamon tools and all installed OK did take over an hour though...
[T],grimreaper420,2010-05-29T08:06Z,"over an hr? yeah i believe it this is a serious program, CS4 also takes awhile depending on ur computer's hardware setup) if you have a Pentium 4, don't expect miracles.
Highly recommend dual core/core 2 dual/ quad core much better:)
haven't tested it out on Core i7's yet, or AMD's Phenom X4's but im sure it would be a flawless install. "
,astheysayinfrance,2010-07-05T12:17Z,"ok so far so good, download speed 1.1 Mb thank you seeders . i will update after install ta ta"
,astheysayinfrance,2010-07-05T15:35Z,"after the download used d-tools to mount .iso, started install used first key which was generated by the attached kay-gen, installed , restarted. working without any problems ... also ConstantFailure  just a suggestion if you are not good with computers buy the license and contact adobe customer services :)"

,luisrrjjcc,2010-10-01T23:57Z,"My OS is Vista WITHOUT any Service Pack, I tried to install CS4 and failed because it required SP1.

Can I install CS3 or does it also requieres SP1?

Thanks in advance for your help."
,kyrint,2010-10-04T21:40Z,i tried everything but not activate! After a 30 days it locked. I made a new download but still does n't work with the activations numbers. Can you help me grim. Thank's anyway
[T],grimreaper420,2010-10-19T23:10Z,"@luisrrjjcc  this is what I read, copy and pasted 4 u 
Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 3; Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise with Service Pack 1 (Service Pack 2 recommended); or Windows 7
therefore, yes it requires the Service Packs to install CS4, even CS3, and of course CS5.

Also, 64-bit edition of Windows Vista/Windows 7 required for Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.
Hope this helps:)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-10-19T23:15Z,"To everyone else having issues regarding activation/activating my torrent CS3 Master, you should not having any issues with the keygen I provided with CS3 Master.
When installing CS3 Master (offline), or when it prompts you to enter serial number, generate a serial number, enter it.
When finished installing, go look for updates, then block AdobeUpdater after. 
Enjoy:)"

,CompIlliterate,2011-09-02T11:18Z,"Hello Grim, I am installing on a new laptop Adobe cs3 master collection that I had on an old computer. Somehow the 2007 keygen that was on the disk is not there anymore. Yours seems to sound like it works, (1) is it still active; (2) Can I get some guidance? I attempted another site and seemed to have got a trojan. I am in need the activation authorization for Adobe Master Collection CS3. I used ser# 1325-1164-8142-5014-6410-3938. When I put that in, it gave me activation# 1753-9501-6915-4314-5883-1142-5727. I tried the phone authorization, did not work. What do I do now? Thanks."
,autod,2012-01-26T20:04Z,just wondering if this was still up and running?
,uniquefrk,2012-05-06T20:48Z,I guess fucking adobe figured some shit out recently. I'd used this thing several times in the past. but this time it stopped working just 1 day after installing. installed and worked fine for 1 day everything was working. today it wants me to enter serial and none of the serials generated by the crack work. time to upgrade to CS6...
