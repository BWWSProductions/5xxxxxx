PLOT:

The scene; a small village in Kwangtung province. The cast; a fruit
merchant, a pickpocket, a shipping foreman and their friends. This
motley crew travel through the town getting into fights and
challenging the local kung-fu masters. When their harmonious way of
life is threatened by a crime boss wanting to control Kwangtung, our
heroic group of fighters, The Ten Tigers of Kwangtung, must perfect
the martial arts skill known as Cantonen Iron Kung Fu and save the
day. The action never stops is this Old School hit.

RiPPERS NOTES:

Team GREiD are back to kick some Kung Fu ass in 2010! This time with
a nice old school release with GREiD quality starring Leung Kar Yan,
Wong Chung, Wong Hap, Phillip Ko Fei, Ma Chin Ku, Wong Tung,
Ting Wa Chung etc.
