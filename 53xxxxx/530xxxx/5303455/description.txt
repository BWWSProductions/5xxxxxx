/*

    This suite includes:

        Turbo C 2.01
        Turbo C++ 1.01
        Turbo Profiler 1.02
        Turbo Debugger 2.02
        Turbo Assembler 2.02

    Turbo Profiler, Debugger, and Assembler are preinstalled for you, in
    the READY directory.  The three 720K floppy images are included, but
    installing them without using real floppy disks is only for the most
    adventurous.  Have fun with that, if you wish.

    Turbo C 2.01 and Turbo C++ 1.01 will both default install to the /TC
    directory.  Since Turbo C++ compiles both C and C++, you may want to
    omit Turbo C 2.01, and install only Turbo C++ 1.01; despite having a
    lower version number, it's more recent.

    In the TCPP101 directory, INSTALL.EXE will get you going.

    
    0.001 2010-01-23

    I rebuilt the preinstalled READY directory, using subdirectories for
    installing the EXAMPLES, consistent with the TCPP101 default install
    choices.

    TD386.EXE fails with more than 16MB of RAM, but TDG16M.SYS will work
    around the problem.  So now I include TDG16M with the archive.  It's
    getting hard to find these old files.  Someone should organize a DOS
    perservation network.
