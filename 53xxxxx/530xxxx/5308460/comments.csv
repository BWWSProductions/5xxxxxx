,ivansama,2010-02-07T14:12Z,Why does it keep saying l don't have enough disc space? l have 5 GB worth of free space 
[V],thethingy,2010-02-07T14:19Z,"5gb is a tiny amount of free space for adobe apps, 20gb recomended. shrink your recycle bin, lose old system restores, uninstall old service packs and delete old files and try again."

[V],thethingy,2010-02-19T01:27Z,"wilhelm09, greatings if there is an error number then please post it,,if not what type of file is it???"
,builtokill,2010-02-19T07:37Z,"This is a great, clean download, Kaspersky Internet Security showed no threats. 
I just installed it on Win7, and i was not able to save the hosts file (if you have installed it personally you will know what i mean) in the system32\drivers\etc folder, so i had to save in my documents, and then copy and replace at the end. It worked fine, you may want to add that in the instructions .txt for everyone. Great torrent, I may download dreamweaver too!"
,cranjkuris,2010-02-26T02:03Z,"Hello there. I downloaded the torrent and followed all the instructions. step 4 of the updates would not load, and upon trying to start fireworks, i received this error message.

,lainey58,2010-06-02T00:03Z,"Dear TheThingy, I have recently dl and installed this torrent and I have a small question. I'm running Win7 and everytime I try to do something it says I don't have permission - even though I am the administrator (???) - so I did the ""host"" file part - which didn't work. Following your instructions and the instructions of someone below, I tried to change the file. The problem is it saved it as a TXT file. Is that okay? Will this still work??  I don't want to continue without an answer.
Thanks! "
,ixianda,2010-08-21T06:50Z,Working like a charm. Thanks for the idiot proofed instructions.
