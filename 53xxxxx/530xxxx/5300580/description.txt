These are two songs from Claudio Sanchez of Coheed and Cambria fame. The Prize Fighter Inferno is one of his side projects. These two particular songs, "Gears" and "Erizo Schultz," are from a special limited edition vinyl that came with the fourth issue of his Kill Audio comic book series, if you had a subscription. I ripped these from the vinyl myself. They are MP3s at a bit rate of 320kbps. I think they sound pretty good, though you can tell they're definitely from a vinyl album. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do. Please seed so everyone can hear these amazing songs.
