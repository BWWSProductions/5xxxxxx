Description
The Italian Job is a video game based on the original The Italian Job film. It was first released for the PlayStation in 2001. The game features a story mode based on the movie and a multiplayer mode where you drive Mini's through several different circuits in London and Turin.
Italian Job Mode is where you get to play the parts of Charlie Croker and his gang as they pull together all of the people and parts they need to pull off a raid as daring as the Italian Job. As you work your way through the game from London, to Turin and finally to the Alps you will open up new cars for you to drive in Free Ride Mode and new trials for you to conquer in Challenge Mode, Checkpoint Mode and Destructor Mode.

Notes
Depending on your Graphics Card the game may have some issue changing resolutions. On my GMA950 it would play a game in full screen then the menus would be in a window, when the game started again it'd be in full screen and it'd alternate. My NVIDIA GeFore 9400 didn't do that for some reason. Still totally Playable!
