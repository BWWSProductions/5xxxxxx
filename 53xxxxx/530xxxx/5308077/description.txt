                    Drama series. DS Ronnie Brooks, DS Matt Devlin  
                    and DI Natalie Chandler investigate when a  
                    homeless man is found beaten nearly to death in  
                    the park at the centre of a well-kept square.  
                    As they dig deeper, they discover that the man  
                    tormented some of the local residents, giving  
                    several people a motive for violence. A  
                    respectable resident of the square is arrested,  
                    but Senior Crown Prosecutor James Steel fears  
                    that the jury will sympathise with the alleged  
                    attacker and, by acquitting him, encourage  
                    vigilantes.
