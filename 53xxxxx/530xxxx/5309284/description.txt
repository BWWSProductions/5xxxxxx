With the support from most of her housemates, Snooki recovers from the punch. Ronnie's family comes for a visit and Sammi does her best to make a good first impression. J-WOWW gets tired of all the haters at the club and gets in a fight. Mike, Pauly and Vinny continue their schemes to hook-up with as many girls as possible, but Vinny may have crossed a line when he takes the boss' girl home.
