I still don't have any faith in the Republicans... all they do is apologize and miss countless opportunities to throw a wrench into this political machine.

Oh sure, they act like they have spines come election time, but that's not good enough for me. It's about time people stopped giving them chances.

Scott Brown... pfft. We'll see."
