                                  * STORY :


* Mass Effect 2 begins in 2183, not long after the events of Mass Effect. While on patrol for geth, the protagonist Commander 

Shepard's ship, the Normandy, comes under attack by an unknown assailant. The ship suffers extensive damage, forcing the crew to 

evacuate in escape pods. Joker continues to pilot the ship, despite it suffering extensive damage and the rest of the crew 

evacuating. Shepard reaches Joker, and orders him to get off the ship. Joker insists he can save the ship even though that 

obviously wasn't the case. Shepard drags Joker out of his seat and into a pod, but before he can board himself, debris slices 

through his suit. He suffocates and dies. His body is seen drifting through space. Commander Shepard's body is retrieved by the 

Shadow Broker, a secretive buyer of information, selling it to the highest bidder, who has been employed by The Collectors, an 

enigmatic and xenophobic alien race who serve as the game's primary antagonists. In the events of Mass Effect: Redemption, former 

squadmate Liara T'Soni is employed by Cerberus, a pro-human group, to get the body for the organization, before it is delivered to 

the Collectors. After this, Cerberus works to revive the Commander through a project known as "Lazarus." Two years later in 2185, 

Shepard is awakened aboard a Cerberus space station that is under attack, and aids Cerberus agents Miranda Lawson and Jacob Taylor 

in escaping. Shepard is taken to Cerberus' headquarters and granted an audience with the Illusive Man, who explains that Shepard 

was "upgraded" and asks for the Commander's help in combating a new threat which has been abducting entire human colonies. Shepard 

and his team are dispatched to the recently attacked colony of Freedom's Progress in the Terminus Systems to investigate. There, 

the group encounters Tali, one of Shepard's former squad members, and discovers that the mysterious insect-like Collectors were 

behind the attack. Shepard reports this to the Illusive Man, who then reveals what Shepard's previous squad members are up to. 

After receiving command of the Normandy SR-2, Shepard decides to begin recruiting a new team to discover the Collectors' plan.
