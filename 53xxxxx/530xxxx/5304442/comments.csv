[V],Subzero!,2010-01-24T18:04Z,"movies recoded to 10% , 320x240 iphone quality!
"
,AZkiller7,2010-01-24T19:04Z,"what's wrong with you Subzero? you always complain about everything, I've never seen Globe spamming your torrents even once. Lay down boy, this ain't a competition, you know why? because you're nothing but a casual ripper, consequently no scene rule applied to you. Let you tell you again LAY DOWN BOY !"
,AZkiller7,2010-01-24T19:17Z,"wow ! seems like it, i was actually uploading it"
,koora888,2010-01-24T20:35Z,hey Globe i already started downloading another version but came here just to say thnx for your effort anyways .
,koora888,2010-01-24T20:36Z,"btw , people shouldnt complain too much about vids quality , if u wanna full quality go buy the game or atleast download the full version and stfu."
[V],Subzero!,2010-01-24T21:58Z,"whats wrong with you pathetic idiots, ive just answered a question ""poncjusz"" has asked.
put mind in gear before opening mouth mofu's"
,igibouy,2010-01-25T00:30Z,So only the movies are changed??? How about the sound quality?? I've downloaded globe's MW2 and the voice quality sound on that game is just very bad. Can someone confirm the voice quality in this game coz this game has a lot more talking than MW2! thnks
,lelle22,2010-01-25T16:35Z,Haha right on Subzero! One idiot is bad enough but here we have two of em competing for attention.. Im with zero on this one...
,excor,2010-01-25T20:35Z,"globe is always nice, unlike you subzero. so, please gtfo and cry somewhere else. people who want FULL package will dl 14gb version. and this one is nice alternative as 3.74gb rip. Thanks globe."
,Mr-R-Man,2010-01-26T05:44Z,"Okay...To all of those complaining about the great TOeD answering a question of another member, who simply asked about video quality,...get a life!

That individual Subzero! has been ripping games for years, I have been a huge fan of his work, and have succesfully downloaded and played 30+ of his games in a good 3 years time. Once you can top the ammount of experience and contributions that he has done, then please STFU!

I know you may not remember me Subzero!, because it has been quite some time, but I still got your back from those years ago, helping all the great newbies get your beautiful RiP's!

,Mr-R-Man,2010-01-26T05:52Z,"And to all of those who think I am a TPB noob just talking shit, please reconsider...I am not...I have been on TPB since March-2008, long enough to know names, and remember people...Also long enough to contribute enough to gain a great deal of respect in the SB and TPB community, and all who have been here long enough do no my name, and that I am not spammer... To all who think I have done nothing to help the great file sharing world, then go here and see I am not a lyer or a noob, www.thepiratebay.org/user/Gremlin515"
[T],Knaster,2010-01-26T06:04Z,Mr-R-Man plz stop making an arse of yourself this aint a competition.
,Mr-R-Man,2010-01-26T06:18Z,"lol, who's competing?

PS- I do realize I forgot to comment on the games quality...

This game is great, the video quality is a small price to pay for a great title at such a small size. It took me a while to download but it is definetly worht it, I would download the 14+ GB version, but my bandwidth would make that take days and days. The voices are a little muffled, but again well worht such a great game at such a small size. I also forgot to thank the uploader, I gues I get a little heated when idiots run their mouths to respect TPB members; so thank you globelus. This is another great RIP from you, i will recommend you for a trusted skull soon enough, to show my dedication. :)"
[S],velvet.,2010-01-26T06:25Z,"User Mr-R-Man opened his TPB account today.
He has not uploaded any torrents yet, his sole contribution so far is limited to the comments posted above."
,Mr-R-Man,2010-01-26T07:45Z,"Ummmm, no Mr Velvet Fog. I actually have forgotten my passwords in different accaounts, I have been a TPB helper, still am a VIP, and have been on TPB for a great deal of time, you of all people should know ReadMan, or on the SB forums as R-man-o9, in the IRC as ready|man. So my sole contributions do not only lye there in the comments above...

Sorry to start an argument with all these lames, but I had to speak my opnion mate. And TOeD has been ripping games for a very long time, and I have been a great contributer to his seeding, because he is a good game ripper mate, so I feel the need to defend his statement...That is it."
,Yoni__,2010-01-26T17:59Z,Can I use saved games from this version with a proper version (realoded's for example)?
,rowanstar,2010-01-26T20:14Z,"This is great! I've been looking for this for a while. Come on everyone, SEED! SEED! I really need this."
,Yoni__,2010-01-26T21:06Z,"Can I use saved games from this version with a proper version (reloaded's for example)? 
VERY slow speed, 1-15 kbps, you will get the 14gb version faster with a good connection"
,nitesamba,2010-01-26T21:39Z,"the dialog sound quality is very bad; you can barely hear it
but the rest of the game is perfect
the video isnt beautiful but its good enough!

,namezaka,2010-01-29T04:30Z,The Citadel Presidium freeze is not relevant to the game's progression. You can skip that part and just finish the game as you wish (I did).

These instructions SHOULD work as they worked for me. 

My ME2 folder ""C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\Masseffect 2"".
Downloaded and installed these mods,following their instructions.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5312494/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_Pack_%5BPC___Multi6%5D
and
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5484229/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_-_Kasumi_Stolen_Memory
1.Before you can install YOU NEED TO TURN OFF gameplay feedback and autoconnect.Do so by starting Mass Effect 2 and going to extras > Options.
Then exit game.
2.Run the DLC installers (IT SHOULD AUTO FIND YOUR FOLDER,if it doesn't I'm sorry but i cant give u any advice, just make sure you put it in the same directory as me)
3.Copy ""giveme2entitlements.exe"" to ME2 Folder and Run it.
4.You should be able play with the DLC installed
