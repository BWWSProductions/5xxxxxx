,007hack,2010-01-28T13:55Z,doesn't work at my windows 7 64bit :(
,zingmars,2010-02-19T15:29Z,"Still have its disc laying around, downloaded because it's scratched.
anyway I remember being able to play the game normally on WinXP SP2, but on W7 Ultimate 32-bit I'm having camera problems, and at 1 point I take the milkshake, or w/e it is and it simply freezes. The character doesnt move at all. 
halp pl0x. No seriously, I wanna play the game for the memories of long time ago, but i can't because of this issue :/."

,Hackertje,2012-03-02T19:38Z,"Windows 7 works.
64-bit doesn't work, only 32-bit.
So if you have 64-bit, it won't work, but YOU CAN TRY IT."
