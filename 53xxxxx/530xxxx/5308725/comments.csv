It found lots of malware Spybot missed.
Now, I can surf the Net anonymously (with Ghostsurf) and safely (Spyhunter), all

You NEED to Shut down Spyhunter...that is why you are unable to copy and then paste....this is the fix"
,Zoemack1121,2010-06-11T02:13Z,"Got this program for good period of time however it got messed up after the auto-update to Version 4. Now, my Spyhunter is corrupted and would no longer accept the crack after re-installation saying...""folder is open..blah blah blah. 

Can you please also upload the version 4 of this with crack...maybe it will help me resolve my issue.

Thanks so much and I enjoyed this download so much! Kept my PC clean for a good amount of time."
,aslkvdv,2012-05-09T15:51Z,Thanks You. Great! 
,11zeeshha,2012-06-27T12:01Z,ok so the installation works fine but it says that i'm unregistered. to remove the problems i need to be registered but that costs money...so what's up? i thought this would be free to use? 
,11zeeshha,2012-06-27T12:23Z,Oh and it says authentication failed.
