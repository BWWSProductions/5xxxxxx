SpyHunter Key Features:

*Easy to Use
SpyHunter is an advanced technology designed specially for people like you, not 
experts. It is automatically configured out of the box to give you optimal 
protection with limited interaction so all you need to do is install it for 
immediate and ongoing protection.


*SpyHunter Scanner 
SpyHunter has been carefully engineered to be powerful and complete enough for the
most demanding technical professional, yet simple enough for a first-time computer 
user to safely and effectively utilize. With just a simple click, SpyHunter Scanner
will scan your computerâ€™s memory, registry, cookies, and files. Items found to be 
infected will then be listed for you. 

To find out more information about a specific object, merely select it. When you 
are ready to remove any infected files, all you have to do is check the box next 
to the item and hit the â€œStart Removeâ€ button. All objects that you remove are 
then placed in SpyHunterâ€™s quarantine area. Simple as that!
 
  
*Process Guard
SpyHunter contains an advanced Process Guard feature, designed to give complete 
control over which processes are authorized to run on your system, and allowing 
you to identify and stop malicious processes before they are even executed. Using 
Process Guard, you are able to allow certain processes to run, while blocking
those do might feel are malicious or unnecessary. 

A list of these processes is available to you to edit as you see fit. By selecting 
a specific item, you can recieve Windows information related to that process or, 
alternatively, you may select the "More Info" button to retrieve accurate and 
up-to-date information off the Internet.
  
 
*Registry Guard
In addition to Process Guard, SpyHunter contains a Registry Guard feature, 
designed to give you complete control over which processes are authorized to add 
auto-start entries to your Windows registry. This feature will identify and stop 
any processes that attempt to secretly auto-start malware by exploiting the 
Windows registry. 

Registry Guard works exactly the same as Process Guard, with a list of processes 
presented to the user to peruse, offering options that allow certain processes to 
write to the registry, while being able to block others. The "More Info" button 
retrieves accurate and up-to-date information from the Internet.
 
  
*Active X Guard
An ActiveX control is an object that is often used to extend different 
functionalities to Internet Explorer. These include browser toolbars, document 
viewer plugins, and a wide array of other add-ons. Many ActiveX controls are 
actually beneficial, but malicious programs frequently use ActiveX controls in 
order to embed themselves onto your system through browser security exploits or 
compromised security settings. 

SpyHunterâ€™s definition database contains a comprehensive list of malicious ActiveX 
objects, which will be automatically loaded to the blocked list. This file is 
updated continuously by our definitions team. SpyHunter will automatically block 
any ActiveX objects in the â€œDisabledâ€ list from being executed, while also 
offering you the option to manually add and remove certain ActiceX objects 
from the list.
 
   
*Network Sentry
The SpyHunter Network Sentry is designed to give you complete control over your 
system networking settings, and to prevent malicious objects from modifying and 
disrupting your Internet connection. In addition to HOSTS file protection, 
SpyHunter also offers an option to protect other Windows system files from 
unauthorized modification. These can be manually selected by the user, offering 
you a lot more control over what you wish to keep safe. 

SpyHunter also contains advanced functionality designed to prevent malware from 
hijacking your desired Internet Explorer homepage. Lastly, SpyHunter can be 
configured to monitor your DNS servers and notify if an unsolicited modification
takes place. This prevents tricky Trojan and malware organizations from 
redirecting you to a phishing or malware site.
 

*Scan Scheduler
SpyHunter incorporates an advanced Scan Scheduler feature, which allows you to 
run a complete SpyHunter scan at a pre-set time, even if you are away from your 
computer. Easy to access and use, the Scan Scheduler allows you to pre-set the 
scan time at daily, weekly and monthly intervals. If you opt for the daily scan, 
you can choose to run the scan every day, every other day, every weekday, or at 
any interval of days that you choose. If you choose the weekly scan, you will be 
able to select the day of the week that your scan will be scheduled for and for 
the monthly scan, select the day of the month that your scan will be scheduled 
for. Please note that your computer must be powered on at the time that your scan 
is scheduled to run. If the computer is not turned on, the scan cannot execute!


*Update
Spyware, malware, Trojans, and viruses are created, updated, and distributed on a 
daily basis. SpyHunter includes an automated Update feature (configurable via the 
Options panel) as well as a manual update method. Under the SpyHunter Update panel, 
the following options will be available to you:

Program Update â€“ which will check for new versions of SpyHunter.
Definition Update - which will check for new spyware definitions.



SpyHunter Options:

Automatically check for updates â€“ SpyHunter will automatically contact the Enigma 
Software Group servers to check for the availability of new program & definitions 
updates each time it starts.

Automatically download and install definition updates â€“ SpyHunter will 
automatically download and install any available definition file updates.

Start SpyHunter Security Suite on Boot â€“ SpyHunter will be configured to 
automatically load each time you boot your computer.

Start SpyHunter Scan on Boot â€“ SpyHunter will automatically start and begin 
scanning your machine each time you boot your computer.

Minimize Security Suite on startup â€“ SpyHunter will start minimized, visible 
only as a taskbar icon. SpyHunterâ€™s real-time protection features will still 
operate at full capacity.

Prompt if any important windows components are disabled â€“ SpyHunter will monitor 
your Windows settings and prompt you if a process attempts to disable the task 
manager or other important Windows components.

Prompt if web content is used on desktop â€“ SpyHunter will monitor Windows settings

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
