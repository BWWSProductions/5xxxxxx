Old Siam, Sir is a hard rock single from Wings' 1979 album, Back to the Egg. It was the A-side of the UK single and the B-side of the US single "Arrow Through Me".

Linda McCartney initially developed the main riff that evolved into this song. Paul McCartney then further the expanded that basic riffâ€”along with guitarist Denny Laineâ€”into a full song, recording an instrumental demo for it called "Super Big Heatwave". The unsubstantiated rumour that Linda played drums on this track is false; the drumming was handled by then-regular Wings' drummer Steve Holly.
