,aije,2010-01-24T16:21Z,I'm seeding but it's weirding out! It's going from 50kb/s a second down to fuck all then back up to 50. I usually seed at around 500kb/s. Don't know what's going on? I ticked the box for initial seeding. Dunno if I was meant to do that?

I have allowed maximum bandwidth and have restarted UTorrent a few times but can't get anyone else to get the full file to help seed. Fuck, it will will be next Australia Day by the time anyone's got it. Anyone have any tips for me? By the way, I put up two different torrents after this one and I am seeding them perfectly."
,terrenmcc,2010-01-25T16:07Z,Keep seeding - you're up to 99.6%.  Juuust a bit more mate. . . . 
,aije,2010-01-26T05:08Z,"Don't know what went wrong with the torrent - everyone stuck at 99.6%. I've gotta put the music files back into my library so I can sync it with my iphone. As long as a few people stay in the ""peers"" at 99.6% then everyone will still be able to download the torrent. Happy Australia Day fellow Aussies and Aussie wannabe's."
