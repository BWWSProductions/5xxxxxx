Game Description

If there's one thing you can count on in Hollywood, it's sequels. It's no surprise that Driver, the franchise known for riveting storylines and authentic racing sequences worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster, has spawned some additional installments. Driver: Parallel Lines continues the franchise's mastery of the action-driving genre. Follow T.K., a driver for hire with plenty of skills but zero conscience. Embark on 35 multi-path missions set in the New York underworld during 2 different eras, 1978 and today, both re-created through stunningly realistic open environments. Parallel Lines brings 80 customizable vehicles, improved character control, enhanced AI, a better-than-ever vehicle damage system, and online multiplayer for up to eight.


Directions


1. Burn using Dvd Decrypter (change book type to DVD-ROM if your burner allows it)
2. Make sure to use GOOD BLANK MEDIA (I recommend Sony or Taiyo Yuden DVD+R)
3. If game skips, try burning at a lower speed
4. Play on your PS2 equipped with either a modchip, SwapMagic, or a softmod (google it)
5. Enjoy!
