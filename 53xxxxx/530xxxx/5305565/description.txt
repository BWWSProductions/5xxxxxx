plot:
The storyline of this movie involves a series of motiveless murders 
committed by various New York residents: a sniper shoots people from 
a water tower; a father murders his entire family; and a cop (Andy Kaufman)
opens fire during a St. Patrick's Day parade. The only consistent pattern 
to the crimes involves the perpetrators calm admissions of guilt, explaining,
 "God told me to." While investigating the murders, catholic police detective 
Peter Nicholas (Tony Lo Bianco) is increasingly troubled by evidence of a 
Christ-like figure named Bernard Phillips (Richard Lynch) who appeared to each
of the killers and can't seem to shake the feeling that his own fate is somewhat
linked to this mysterious being. As he comes closer to the truth, his worst 
fears are confirmed.
