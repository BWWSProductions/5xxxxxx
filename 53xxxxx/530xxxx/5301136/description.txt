Here it is the Embraer Regional Jets, service pack 1. This is a full install and Feelthere/Wilco directs that the original be uninstalled before applying this "update." Many small errors were fixed and this version includes a "yokeless" VC.

Enjoy, be patient and if anyone has the B767 by CaptainSim or CLS to share here I would be really stoked. Also available is the CLS Piper Arrow and the new PMDG 747x, so expect those soon.
