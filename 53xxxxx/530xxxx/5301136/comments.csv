Maybe you didn't see my question. "
,aarque,2010-01-23T11:34Z,"I did not compare the before. Normally FSX is quite sparse in remote places. Most of Russia aside from the big cities is empty. For example, Baikonur, the largest and most active Soviet space port, is just gently rolling hills without vegetation. The Slovenia torrent is very large and when I perused it it did not appear ""typical"" FSX default. Perhaps you did not properly activate it."
,memphis100,2010-01-23T12:33Z,Thanks for your respons. I activated it the usual way(the way you mentioned). Did you rename the mesh bgl file in mpg as stated in that torrent and looked what happens?
,aarque,2010-01-23T15:26Z,"I saw ""Bikini Boobs."" Ultimately I see no difference comparing FSX with and without aradulo's torrent. I used Mirabor and Cerklje Mil as my test airports. Bottom line is that it is extremely unlikely that he would intentionally pack 4.5 gigabytes of fluff in order to pass a 45 megabyte porn flick; perhaps he was using the bit torrent protocol to pass state secrets or sensitive data but since I rarely if ever visit Slovenia in FSX I will allow it to remain until I find better."
,memphis100,2010-01-23T18:10Z,I agree. It's a pity aradulo doesn't respond on my request to clear it up. Thanks for your answer.
,aarque,2010-01-23T20:46Z,"and since the actual SLO for FSX costs $60, I doubt anyone else will be buying it and offering it anytime soon."

,aarque,2010-01-27T00:34Z,"Hey Poipoi, I wouldn't recommend DBS Airport GPS. I was on the beta and it is very tedious to install. Also you have to activate it after getting a counter-code from the application and emailing that to DBS. Which means rips or shares won't work. I suggest you try ""airport chart gauge v2"" which is free and available at Simviation:
