NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

This time it's a TS of leap year,now for the video we used LU's video as it's the only source out and the audio is again our own line audio.

The video needed alot of TLC and even now it's nothing special.......so please check sample first!!

Audio is direct and isn't too bad,we'd had better,but we've also had worse so .....also there might be a couple of spots that are like 50ms oss,but it isn't easy to sync when the video source isn't the best.
