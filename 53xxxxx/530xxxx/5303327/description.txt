The Castle - classic Australian comedy movie.

I've been trying to get a decent copy of the australian version of this for ages but remembered I had this copy that was recorded off TV.
However there is ghosting on this copy so you have been advised. This is still very watchable and definitely worth watching as it's hilarious. Not a copy to keep just to view. I've removed all the adverts to maintain continuity and reduce file size.

There is another copy on the bay but seeding is virtually nil

Format XVID AVI 640x480 25fps
Video bitrate - 768
Aspect ratio 4.3

Please be patient with downloading I'll be seeding as much as possible on maximum bandwidth but may inhibit the number of user connections to ten at a time.



Please help to seed this especially IF the demand is high thank you

Who am I kidding maybe no-one wants this LOL!
