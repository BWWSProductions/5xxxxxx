[T],renman,2010-01-24T15:11Z,Like I said don't get too excited by this as quality not great for keeping but OK for viewing until I can locate a DVD rip then I'll upload that
,Tamarind777,2010-01-27T21:54Z,"This movie is so well acted and funny. The video quality is about an 7 and the audio is about a 9, and I give the movie a 10. It's quite comparable to Napoleon Dynamite, one of those slow comedies. Very funny."
,Tamarind777,2010-01-27T21:56Z,"Mr. Hinter, get a free trial from Netflix and copy it using DVD Shrink. Netflix has it to be rented (if you're in the US, that is)."
