[V],mirrormaster82,2010-01-25T21:17Z,"And why wouldnt you trust me?I haven`t downloaded the movie yet but you asked for english subtitles,and as soon as my download completes I will download the subtitle.I have been downloading subtitles from this site for two years now and never had any problems...but if you don`t trust me than thats your problem not mine...lol"
,TPBRools,2010-01-26T22:19Z,"mirrdormaster82, I'm guessing you got beat up a lot at school too! lol"
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-01-27T00:11Z,No I beat up others and now I am reformed and law abiding citizen who helps everybody around..............LOL...............
,godswallops,2010-01-27T16:32Z,"mirrormaster82's link should have been: http://en.titlovi.com/subtitles/subtitles.aspx?subtitle=the%20secret%20in%20their%20eyes&language=

Unfortunately, these subs are for a short version of the movie, so they don't synchronise at all.

This D/L is fully 10 minutes longer.

Anyway, this D/L by .BONE. contains subtitles in both espanol (I think) and english.  Unfortunately, I have to figure a way of removing the first subtitle track leaving just the second one because my software for making dvd's only sees the first subtitle track.  

The included subtitles are in the .RAR file as a .IDX & .SUB pair (I hate these and much prefer .SRT)."
,godswallops,2010-01-27T16:34Z,"Damn... posting is broken when a URL ends with the = symbol.

Just use the link above and then add the =.

This was probably what made mirrormaster82's link fail for me too."
,godswallops,2010-01-27T16:44Z,"I just tried some subtitles from http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-52353 but no luck - they seem to be for a version that is 10 minutes shorter.

Anyone know how to extract a .SRT file from an .IDX/.SUB pair???"
,godswallops,2010-01-27T19:33Z,"Oh, by they way, this is an excellent movie. It really is hard to stop watching once started.

It deserves the nearly 9/10 on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305806/

Thanks again! :)"
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-01-27T21:39Z,Pirate bay can`t seem to let me write a link to the accurate english subtitle of this movie which I checked and it`s for the whole movie
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-01-27T21:43Z,"No luck,ok u go to the site 
podnapisi dot net
then u type ''The secret in their eyes'' or ''El secreto de sus ojos'' and it will show u two english subtitles,below the other subtitle it says it`s xvid-lap version and u just download it,simple as that"
,godswallops,2010-01-28T13:00Z,"Thanks, mirrormaster82 - the subtitles at podnapisi  are perfect. :-)

Note that the subtitles included by .BONE. are good too and I can use them with VLC. It was just that I had no way of selecting the right track when making a DVD."
,madmax03,2010-11-09T08:53Z,seed please... the download is slow..
