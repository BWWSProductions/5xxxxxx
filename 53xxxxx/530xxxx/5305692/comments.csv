,sdobson,2010-01-25T00:48Z,"Heavy Diamond, yes i was aware of the other fake one, i downloaded it, saw it was a fake and reported it.

But still, will see for myself and if it is fake i will report this one to lol but i hope its not a fake as i have been hyped for this, since i found out in July time"
,sdobson,2010-01-25T03:17Z,"Despite the 2nd of Feb release date, i can say, after 3 hours of downloading due to low seeders this is the real deal and not a fake like the previous.

V=10

,Grisle26,2010-01-27T05:13Z,"I don't usually leave comments, but I figure I should start so my ratings may be a little off.

A: 8 - Goes out of sync early, but comes back.

V: 8 - A Little pixelization and fuzziness.

M: 7 - Not as good as it could have been.  Writing was bad and the pacing was kinda strange, but definitely worth watching and much better than a lot of stuff out there.

Thanks for uploading it .BONE.!!! "
,Grisle26,2010-01-27T05:15Z,I was on the computer while watching it so I apologize for saying the audio comes back...I didn't even notice it was off the whole time.  Not really that bad...just a slight feeling of English dubbing.
