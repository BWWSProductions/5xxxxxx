,FlyingThor,2010-06-11T05:06Z,"GreatestfuckingMember my ass, constantly mislabelling torrents and fobbing people off with bullshit excuses about imaginary seeding. Sooooo fucking slow.....

Stop trying to be the first person in with uploads, this is not a full season, you're SGA pack you started seeding when you had a crappy upload speed, then came excuse after excuse after excuse, both here and on suprbay....I guess you had to call yourself greatest member cos most eveeryone else is calling you a muppet! 

Download from a professional guys, go to eztv's torrents, VTV or .BONE. much less hassle, much better quality and you won't be waiting a month for it to finish."

- No Problem

@ we-boy
- Only 10 Episodes have aired, this is Season 1 (up until new releases in  April)

@ madlulz
- It's not my fault there are alot of leechers around. (I have this now being uploaded from two addresses one on a constant 45,000kbps upload and one on a 5,000kbps upload)

@ houruoha
- This torrent is/was labled correctly, it was posted in January 2010, which was the end of Season 1 up until the new budgets came in to allow the continuations of the Series in April

@ axilleaszz 
- No Problem, some people just don't know how to configure there torrent programs correctly to get good speed :)

@ Trite2k3
- Thanks buddy for that.

@ FlyingThor
- I'm not at all mislableing torrents, they have been filled in correctly for all my torrents. At the time I didn't have a great upload speed and had limitations but now my speeds are more than satisfactory and my second address from where i'm seeding from gives a huge speed increase.
- The quallity is identical to what you get from EZTV as these are collabortaory works from his and other sources.

- If you don't like my torrents then DONT FUCKING DOWNLOAD THEM!"
,FlyingThor,2010-07-01T12:41Z,"Eh I think that was my point, I won't be downloading them you tool! Just letting the good people know that you are a mislabelling moron who thinks he's doing people a service by bringing already well seeded single episodes into sloooooow ass packs! 

Get over yourself man, fuck sake sure we all know the only reason you got your ""Trusted"" status was cos you gave out about not having it so much on Suprbay, and eventually found that if you gave Marlow some head he'd give you a purple skull! 

You be a joke! And by they way, EZTV is a seperate website you idiot, the torrents are uploaded here too under the name EZTV. Fucking moron."
,sidthefish1,2010-07-02T14:38Z,nice fast upload @ 1.2 but how annoying are them pop adds every so often with adds to future programs ....is that what you have to put up with in america ???? really
,Luweewu,2010-07-17T05:42Z,Thanks
,dedutch,2010-08-24T23:44Z,"thanks for the up!

@ FlyingThor

get a life, you sad sad man......."
[T],YourGreatestMember,2012-01-15T02:15Z,"@ FlyingThor
- You're calling me a tool that's funny. 
- It wasn't mislabled at all (Fact)
- People love packs hence why so many downloaded this (By my count it's over 5,000+)
- I got a ""Trusted"" status for providing trusted packs and downloads for people, you have one small upload so go cry elsewhere.
- I give perfectly good descriptions which clearly show there are 10 episodes in this pack.
- I didn't say EZTV wasn't a separate website, nor did I say that they don't upload them here... I know they upload them here and if you read I said that the quallity of these compared to his are exactly the same.

@ sidthefish1
- Yeah they get lots of ads, sorry about them (I'm not from America or Canada) but glad you liked this.

@ Luweewu
- No problem ;)

@ dedutc
- Cheers buddy, the kid doesn't even upload anything worthwhile just a leeching faggot.
- Psst, nice uploads ;P

@ CONNOR66
- You haven't uploaded a single torrent so shut the fuck up, it's labled perfectly good and if you read the description it tells you that there are 10 episodes in this pack."
