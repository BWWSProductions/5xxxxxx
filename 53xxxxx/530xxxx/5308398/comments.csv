Yeah Totally Insane That People would Whine and Complain, The Mere Fact That The Movie Was 100% Watchable and The Audio Was VERY Sufficient, Isn't Enough For You Guys!!

Thanks To Raymondhome and Imagine For A Truly Amazing Release!!

Just curious, though, since you seem to have several torrents of this film, is the audio significantly improved from this on any of your other versions? b/c I'm ready to watch this film again and again. "
